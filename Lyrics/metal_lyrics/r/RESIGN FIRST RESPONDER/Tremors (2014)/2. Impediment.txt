A logical mind is a closed mind and the adverse is so naive
If this is all for not then we are all lost

Purpose retracted
I swear these forces - they torture me and lead me astray
Until a mighty gust of wind blows them all away
For a brief moment
The calm before the downpour
I leave enlightened yet always return
Without motivation

I'm the biggest hypocrite I know
If I had the will to change I'd have changed years ago
Its just feels like I'm a rat in a maze
Destined to fail but asked to desperately try

How can I ignore the shreds of beauty in this world?
These sights and wonders are beyond my comprehension
My cynicism reduced to ignorance
But what of those without a hope
Who hardened their hearts?
Who hardened their hearts?
Extol the miracle of treacherous life and potential destruction

Orchestrated. Premeditated.
Guided, Hopeful.
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I to deny untenable love?
Limit reality
