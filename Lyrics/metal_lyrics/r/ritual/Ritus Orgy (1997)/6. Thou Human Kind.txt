I can clearly see the space, Iâve been always yearning to dwell. In a coexistence of ages and ages, there I might find out who I am. Riding my steed around by the obscure castle where the black dragonâs pirouetting, upon the towerâs tip, like the vulturian creature and its victim. Getting a hold of him right after Iâve taken my horseâs saddle off, heâs waving so far and gracefully. Gliding through the air as quick as the northern frost whizzes. I allow my desire to regale me over as I inspect my realm. His back and scales are so hard like natureâs cruelness. Nevertheless âtis beautiful watchich pauperized worms âneath me called âThe Human Beingsâ, though I had to die to be reborn. I used to be one of them, deprived my humanity because of my divergence to descry the purity of the light. I was trampled dead by horseâs hooves. However, I do not spare any minute as I hear my winged barasirâs tired though happy wheezing. And I have a goal to fly towards unknown hights, I tremble, I shiver. Suddenly I caught sight of her - my fay Thera, whose lips and gleaming eyes make me burn with fire. Sheâs giving me her palm, so tender that Iâm unable to give any testimony. Leaving my beast and dancing in the wind with her, upon the horizon which is getting further. In this whirl full of brightness (and luster), Iâm gently clutching your hands. Weâre getting closer more and moreâ¦ and finally Iâm kissing you (sheâs kissing me)
