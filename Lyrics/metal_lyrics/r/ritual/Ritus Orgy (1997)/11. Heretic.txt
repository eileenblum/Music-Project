Iâm back again in animal form. Donât be afraid to look into my eyes, because youâre me and I am you. We stay on the same level and I spit fire on them who are beneath me. I curse them with my bloody plague full of darkness. I scorn their scarred lives, thrusts on heart â¦ ? Let the light of their existence get dark. Iâm a heretic and I will always look like this in their eyes. Nevertheless, I ask whether or not to jump into deathâs embrace is blasphemy ? I donât want to be alive or dead, are we evil refusing that ? To be sure, nothing is worthy. The curse is signed with my name to make them understand that the world spins in another way.
