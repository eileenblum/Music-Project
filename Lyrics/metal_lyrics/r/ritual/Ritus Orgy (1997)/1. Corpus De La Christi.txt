In the stream of thoughts, you seek the truth of ages. Immense illusions of insidious shadows, are the only thing that you can see. Youâve lost battle with the Astral, but not the war of this world. Stir up the animal pulse beating in your heart, stop the circulation of the world, drown it in the river of fear and lies. Without hope - without despair. Youâre one of the kin of the revengeful and merciless, only depths of rocks can satisfy thee. In a deep of your own darkness, you implore yourself for the excuse. And wolves sing your anthem and follow your steps to the spaces where under stream of tears the temples fall down. And from the interior of Earth, you bring the paradise to the light.
