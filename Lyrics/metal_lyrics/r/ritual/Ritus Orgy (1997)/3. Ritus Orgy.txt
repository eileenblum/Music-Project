Iâve travelled through many countrysides, but still I havenât found what my soul is yearning for. Searching deep in the paradise and time like sand falls down from my fingers. My life is a neverending dream, Iâm waiting to be dispatched forever. Thereâs namely no-one who could ever be akin to me, Iâm yelling and awaiting my echo to disappear. Black colour justifies exactly the state of my soul. Afterwards Iâm looking at its mirrorâ¦ receive nothing but desolation. Iâm alone like a pit from pendulum, still dreaming. Dead and wandering in a world of mourning and melancholy. I expect no salvation from heaven. I try abortively to recognize my identity, in a labyrinth of enchanted kingdom. Mysticismâ¦ and nothing makes a difference.
