Deep in the full moon night when moonshine began ruling the time, roots of the ancient eras and ages were covered by cobwebs by midnight sorcery. Those are concealed with a fume of burning crucifixes, and began desolating their mysterious side of beauty. All of sudden the Wisdom tree rising up from the obscure doctrine grew over by moss and commenced desolating as a result of what a mendacious belief condemned with its vilified slanders, and hadnât let rise onto the light of Earth. The flame of concord was extinguished, the tangle of perfidious deeds encircled and hid all the knowledge-carrying branches as a venomous viper with its slippery body. That hideous wraith of stony looks, the rosary-twinned phantasm, its disfigured face - burnt by tears, its merciful arms are cleaved to thousands pieces. Dusty smile turned to an appalling gesture grown up from our unforgivable âsinsâ. Walking down within unpervedeable dark, heâs atoning and barying the burden of centuries. Potsherds of mankindâs fate will be rending his soles to blood day by day. The Era of truth has finally begun sowing its semens and its foetus will lead us out of this maze of sacrament. Away from the vanity of rejectable behaviour cursed by doom in the name of each of us. All our fingers have changed to claws and theyâll point at the path paved with eternal sorrow risen from all the Earthâs descendants that the soil was able to spawn (by blood) ... those will dominate forever on !!! Thee shall die â¦ I.N.R.I. !!!
