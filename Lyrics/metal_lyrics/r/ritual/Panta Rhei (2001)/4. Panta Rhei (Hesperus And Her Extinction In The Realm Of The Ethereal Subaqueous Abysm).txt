Its callingâs getting closer like the clouds that hide my planet with the unknown. Youâre my first and the last star that illuminates me stride boundly the path I predetermined myself. Youâre the first messenger of night that fills the empty space in my body entirely like in an abandoned sentiment devoted to a tree odour, which urges me to watch things others could merely dream of. Stay the same you forever are now, and even though weâve been succumbed to nothingness for so long, thus our declineâs becoming worse; theeâll stay an everlasting unattainable target of mine. Life is a neverending dream and one can solely await the coming of his surface dispatch. Then he will deceaseâ¦ and keeps waiting until another poor life enters again ???
