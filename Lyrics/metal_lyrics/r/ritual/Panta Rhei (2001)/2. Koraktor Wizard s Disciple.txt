Krabat, your lifeâs so similar to a stray little birdâs fate, you deflect thrusts with chill brittleness. Itâs thirst for vengeance and dispersing against all the others what dwells deep inside of you, not a wrath. Youâre unwanted and useless, but stars may have wanted thy death different, who or what you are supposed to defeat. You know. And nothing else consists in, as everythingâs an unsubstantial water bead stream that will flow down faster than tears from your face, itâll disappear earlier than it might obtain such a meaning ... can you feel the magic ?!?!?! Your love is reciprocated (riâsiprkeitid) back to thee because she feels the dark as well, she loves your black wings more than her life. A thought for that moment, the mysterious melody - a song of fate that still resounds in your ears. You canât avoid thinking of her, flying up to watch her innocence ...sheâs going to deliver you once. What for words when just one passionate look into her eyes means all. The eyes that reflect all the primest forest power, no matter how mighty the Mill on the black water is. But as the natureâs getting older, the ravage of time has moved farther. Thereâs another victim walking towards the Mill. The boyâs come full of hope to conceal himself before inhospitable mean grudging youth, but ... âItâs time to dig a grave, weâll see who itâll serve forâ. You know you vainly try to prevent all thatâs been lost damned before. You know how to break through the Art curse - âtis the Black Art that wrong hands carry. This book is called Koraktor and your life will be preserved save in ravenâs heart, forever - what an endless connection between two realms, the beyond and the Earthly.
