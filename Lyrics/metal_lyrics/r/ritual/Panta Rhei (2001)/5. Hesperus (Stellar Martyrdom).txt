Whatâs taking place inside of me, is an incessant struggle - not a battle of two souls, but a war of thousands of demons who know exactly what to conquer and how. Each vanquishes the remaining ones to rule continuously the very next moment, but Iâm always barely able to idly watch myself bleed ... when the flesh broils in its own gravy containing my past and future visions. And so we try to survive in the inner worlds of ours that will, once, forever disappear without our guilt. Time like sand falls down from my palms and the black color justifies exactly my comprehending which turns my bewaring sight away from the heaven â¦ There still is a strange wind blowing within the tree branches. Enchanting sun rays pervade them and the eyes are staring through ... Nature isnât dying, itâs just falling asleep, those fallen leaves remind me of the moments when I still had a hope deep inside of me. Nevertheless I know where I belong - in spite of all the acrid immaterial pain, now Iâm returning back to the nature as Iâve always been one of its constituents, perhaps more than a son. Panta Rhei tormentâs thenceforth â¦
