There are four years left as there are four riders of the Apocalypse rushing towards us. And he who foretold their arrival may have travelled through the time. When he will penetrate through the dust of Mars and hunger, misery and fear will spread their reign. The infection is creeping to unleash the war in black itâs tidingsing the plague, there will remain no stone in order, no soil on the dryland no sand on the ground â¦ only a painful choir. The spiral will turn over, because the core is half-rotten. And we must cut it out to provide roots for the new living. I donât believe he lies. Well, weâll wait till the seventh month. Weâll allow the gloominess of being to regale over us. And I as an emperor of terror will ignite the âEastâ, let it burn !!! And let the shattered walls fall down
