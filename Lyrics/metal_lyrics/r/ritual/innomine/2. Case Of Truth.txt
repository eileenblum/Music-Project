ThereÂ´s a wraith leaving the way of burning gates of dreams, it brings a redemption from the days of the CatholicÂ´s. White torn pieces between temples, ChristÂ´s dead body, itÂ´s lying on the stone table, itÂ´s splattered and bloody. Open the gates, (I wish), of stone temple. Let from the ways of all over the world, let rise the LordÂ´s power. For the glory of Dark empire, they drink cockÂ´s blood from a goblet. Then with the sword of their ancients they will crush the skull of the time. Case of truthâ¦ Open the gatesâ¦
