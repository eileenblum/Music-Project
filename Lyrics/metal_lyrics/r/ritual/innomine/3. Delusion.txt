In the smell of blood and sweat, you feel like time is dying. Rotten air of hundred vaults chases out an everyday dream from souls. Parched looks call the primmest power surviving in us, (you) hear the unreal voice of destiny, neverending time. YouÂ´ll never feel pain of the cold walls, you accept no transformation. The stack burns with flame of life, you perceive no consciousness. From the unleashed heat from the motionless bodies, in the heat, the day is lost. In diseased visions survives a fear, from the ash smoulders desperate grief. Perfidious crowd satisfied its desire for its avenge, this is your saviour - King of the Jews. This insanity still survives! This is your saviour - King of the Jews.
