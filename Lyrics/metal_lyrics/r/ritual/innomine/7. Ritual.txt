On the head of the Goat ia tiding sing sign, calling up the power of the obscure candles. Circle of stones stays here for the hundreds, silhouettes of the grey figures, swords in their grips. Wind in branches of the tree, mysterious rocks are illuminated by the Moonlight. Temptation of the Dark night calls up a might full of mystery. Stream of light raving about a rite without witnesses. The wish without order to the highest feeling of emotions â fully, how itÂ´s written in the bequest of ancestors. Ritualâ¦ (by the truth), theyÂ´re drinking from the goblet impiously free, from a cup filled with a faithful to themselves.
