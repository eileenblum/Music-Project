Look into my exes, thereÂ´s a gleaming insanity. IÂ´ve pleasure for the last case to give your soul to eternity. Hell calls for your body, but you have no saviour â your pretty neck your golden hair, thousand pins, youÂ´ve finished. I love your fear, but you hate it. Your innocent face will stain with blood. Wait, time will come, youÂ´ll taste my daggerÂ´s edge, in your heart. There are in my eyes deadly poisons, soon in my arms you will stare for the last time. Implore for me feeble in my embrace, youÂ´ll die with your pain on the altar in the Hell. Your eyes will spread and will flood by blood, grey shadows will cover your dead faceâ¦ hellish flames will swallow down your body, and then I will share your stony casketâ¦ with you.
