I transmit my soul, now Iâm a void stooge in the claws of a pretentious benefactor. Creator of thoughtless thesis and spurious doctrine. Iâm a miserable orthodox moron, Iâm degenerated with my absurdity. Iâve lost everything whatâs worthy of being honest. My tongue was torn out, my brain was knocked out, because they split my skull open with their cross. What is a word, what is a thought for me ? Though Iâm only a figure of this spiritual farce. And the really wonderful myths â¦ My body has already thrilled. Thinking about a clean soul, entering the precious heaven paradise. Fortunately, my hand is led by the saviourâs âtrue being lineâ. Oh, what a dull asceticism has clouded over me, this is gratefully my real form. However, hereâs my tragedy that Iâm too near-sighted to show characteristics of myself. Though I canât say âcause Iâm not. Iâm merely a fragment, sperm of fatality deformed by the what I so rapturously worship.
