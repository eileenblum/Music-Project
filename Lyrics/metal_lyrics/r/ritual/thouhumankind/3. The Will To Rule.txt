The will to rule that is the question, and those that assert the the âAlterâ is everything for them, only dissimulate. But they are the real hell on the Earth. The disgust, the brake of progress, doctrines about the divine beauty, eh, just a collection of lies, hoard of prophets (fuck, they suck)! Emptiness and dust fall out their mouth. No! Out of their piggish faces. For the whole-life fasting they voluntarily jump into the boiling cattle, and there makes them hot their own âLordâ. Whose bastard are you? Because you refused both youâre mother and even father, and accepted only abstractions. No, you ainât messiah, youâre nothing, youâre worse than nothing, youâre the evil one. I wonât live to see how the sin of the two millenniums will be redeemed, anyway, weâre the history of decline.
