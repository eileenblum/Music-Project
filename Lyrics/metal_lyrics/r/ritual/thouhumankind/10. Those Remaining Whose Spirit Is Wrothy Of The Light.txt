Emptiness everywhere, vast cool frosty plains. Perhaps weâre on the edge of this sorrowful millennium. All that is alive is dying, grief and lamentation echo far in the distance. Look! Over the horizon, there mighty winds blow which bring swirls of dirt and dust. That cover living contours (in the case they exist). This a panorama stirs up apprehensions and fear if those remaining whose spirit is worthy of the lightâ¦ Fire is flaming out of our mouths which will sear the blind eyes. And will ruin the supports propping up the celestial empire. Oh, lord - you whoâs embodied delusion into the form of sacrament, your days are numbered. Devil tore spurious vestment down from your body and threw that among the folk you poked their eyes out with your poisoned claws. Dying humankind, listen! As they tell you that you are made to subscribe the Devil, youâre subjugated to God. Lucifer, we know that we are the only ones who know our destiny. Luminous rays of wisdom are streaming from us. They are the veil which will cover the hoard. We shall pierce the horde, and it shall die.
