We have sussed out the situation on all this shit
That people are scared of death but don't want to admit
What could be more better than the great escape
On the road my strawberry jam remains are scraped

It's the fear of death just fuckin accept it

Just thinking about all these things that people talk about
Your death will come just face it or will you realize with a clout
Destruction of the earth or nuclear fucken war
When you die your soul remains - yeah right fucken sure

Its the fear of death just fucken accept it

What's wrong with death it's better than fucken life
We are all looking forward to the reaper and his scythe
We have no false hopes that after death we are still alive
For our own inevitable deaths we will fuckin strive

It's the fear of death just fucken accept it
It's too late it's too late it's too late it's too late
