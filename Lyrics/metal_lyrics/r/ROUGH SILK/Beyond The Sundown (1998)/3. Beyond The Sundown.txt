Beyond the sundown - you're just a beast without a name
beyond the sundown - life is more than just a game
beyond the sundown - mirrors rise and shadows fall
beyond the sundown - darkness rises after all

beyond the sundown - you need light and light needs pain
beyond the sundown - silence breaks and scars remain
beyond the sundown - it's your memory and the truth
beyond the sundown - there ain't nothing left to lose

I walk around in circles - I walk alone and blue
I talk to strange illusions - in need of something true
I've seen a billion faces - I've seen the prince of lies
I've seen a million places branded by the lord of flies

so I won't take your orders - so I won't take your smile
I'd sail across the oceans - I'd walk the endless mile
so all your secret sinners - thou shalt not live in fear!
I won't believe in answers - while somethings always near

beyond the sundown - I'd be you and you'd be me
beyond the sundown - every word was like a key
beyond the sundown - would you lie to me in vain?
beyond the sundown - just like here and now-insane?

beyond the sundown

beyond the sundown - I wouldn't be the one to blame
beyond the sundown - I wouldn't be your road to fame
beyond the sundown - you'd be just a waste of time
beyond the sundown - to break a promise would be a crime

and if I'd say goodbye today
would there be another way
would you cry just like a clown
way beyond the last sundown?
and if I'd leave without a word
-ain't that just a little absurd?-
would you give the king back his crown
and wait for me beyond sundown?
