(...the lonely road to mystery bay)

Well, the night was dark and the moon was pale
the saints were searching for the holy grail
i drove real slow in the ultrafast way
on the lonely road to mystery bay

well, it's the goddamned truth - no, it ain't no tale
when the bad stay hungry - then the good ones fail
i've seen too much - that's the price you pay
on the lonely road to mystery bay

suddenly the radio screamed
it was still switched off but, man, it seemed
like a kiss of yesterday
on the lonely road to mystery bay
and when the night is over
and they've swallowed your pride
and there ain't no place to hide:
recall - recall - recall - recall

...on the lonely road to mystery bay
...on the lonely road to mystery bay

recall - recall - recall - the fall - recall the fall

well, the radio ghost said: "it's time to go
to the reasons why and the grace below
it's not the aim - it's just the way
on the lonely road to mystery bay

well, what could i say - what could i do?
lightning flashed and so did you
as i woke up and the light of day
told me "welcome to mystery bay"

and when the night is over...
