I believe someone's blood is another one's wine
I believe someone's trace is another one's sign
I believe someone's love is another one's hate
I believe someone's soon is much too late

you look surprised - you shouldn't be, my friend
this world is full of cretins who still pretend
to sell tomorrow and a guiding light
I do believe in nothing but the night

someone's pleasure is another one's pain - glissando
someone's fire is another one's rain - glissando
someone's lightning flashed in vain - glissando
I believe - I don't know
I believe - life will show 
I believe - it's time to go
glissando

I believe someone's lie is another one's truth
I believe someone's dawn is another one's youth
I believe someone's gold is another one's grey
I believe someone's lust is the price to pay

you look surprised....
