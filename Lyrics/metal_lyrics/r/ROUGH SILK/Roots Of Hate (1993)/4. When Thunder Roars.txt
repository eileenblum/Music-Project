Destruction - pollution - intolerance - hatred and blood
the respect of nature's been slayed
and lies dyin' in the mud

we gods are left mightless now
as they praise their own shines
we only can send our signs

when thunder roars - in the night
their holy wars - should be fought just to save
this world from the grave of light

genetic creations - atomic sensations - they fly
to stars and horizons and reach for the sky

we watch them from nowhere
when they finally must pay fot their crime
we'll burry our tears in time

when thunder roars - in the night
their holy wars - should be fought just to save
this world from the grave of light

we - are standing together
and we - are one hand in hand
and we can't believe
this race we created
has got on the lose - begun to refuse
to try to understand

now
thunder roars - in the night
change your course - you can't win the fight

thunder roars - in the night
their holy wars - should be fought just to save
this world from the grave of light
