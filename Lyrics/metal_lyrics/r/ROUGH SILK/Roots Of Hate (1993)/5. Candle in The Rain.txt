Now that you're gone
i'm trying not to cry
and I'm asking my walls
why our love had to die
wise people say time
will heal every wound - someday

well, I tried to be a good guy
tried harder day by day
but on this bed of roses
the fire - the wire didn't stay

like a candle out in the rain
on the wings of a prayer we've been hiding our pain
our fading love - we tried to save but in vain
like a candle in the rain

maybe we should have tried
a little bit more
and maybe we had a dream
worth fighting for
but it's been taken away
the winds of change blew so fast
and passion didn't last

well, I tried to be a good guy
tried harder day by day
but on this bed of roses
the fire - the wire didn't stay

like a candle out in the rain
on the wings of a prayer we've been hiding our pain
our fading love - we tried to save but in vain
like a candle in the rain

when at night the winds blew cold
we used to lie awake and hold
each other tight but these days are gone forever
forever now

like a candle out in the rain
on the wings of a prayer we've been hiding our pain
our fading love - we tried to save but in vain
like a candle in the rain
