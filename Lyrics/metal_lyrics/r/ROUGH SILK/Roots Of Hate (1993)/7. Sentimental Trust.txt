He was a money - hungry - power - thirsty rich man's kind
taught to praise the business
and that's all he ever did

daytime - nightime - always the same
one day he realised
something's missing in his game

well - money makes the world go 'round
to have or have not - holy amount
but there's one thing you can't buy at all
whoever you are - without it you're small

sentimetal trust - sets hearts on fire
sentimetal trust - can't be drowned on greed
sentimetal trust - our dream's desire
sentimetal trust - tames cold and heat

another lad was just a shy shy boy
he wasn't too attractive
and always without joy

so he went to a whore to learn what loves means
but she couldn't give emotions
she only sold what's in her jeans

well - money makes the world go 'round
to have or have not - holy amount

but sentimetal trust - sets hearts on fire
sentimetal trust - can-t be drowned in greed
sentimetal trust - our dream's desire
sentimetal trust - tames cold and heat
