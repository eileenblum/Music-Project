Sometimes your mind is getting
out of control and your soul is on the run
pictures of destruction
are killing your hopes beat your heart against
beat your heart against the wall and lights are turning
into dark and rusty wheels but tears won't stay

ups and downs
there are always ups and downs
sometimes we act like clowns
sometimes we act like heroes in the night
ups and downs
always ups and downs
like kings but without crowns
there are always ups and downs

sometimes your mind is racing
up to the sky and your pride is flying free
pictures of construction
are feeding your hopes make your face like without
make your face like without fear and wheels are turning
but don't you feel too safe it's just like night and day

Ups and downs
There are always ups and downs
Sometimes we act like clowns
Sometimes we act like heroes in the night
Ups and downs
Always ups and downs
Like kings but without crowns
There are always ups and downs

So there's no need to give your
Bread away for stone
Sometimes emotions grow
Where feelings can't be shown
