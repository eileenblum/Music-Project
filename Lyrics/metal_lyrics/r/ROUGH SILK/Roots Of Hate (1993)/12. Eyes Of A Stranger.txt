They sell you sixty-nine and a thousand tales
just to make your fortune
in this kingdom made of glitter and tears
honesty on the run
afraid to touch the taken sun
and the lost light a candle

but don't forget you can touch the sky
(just follow your heart)

you can't get out - with eyes of a stranger
can't get out - you'll never stand on lies

so scream and shout
with eyes of a stranger you'll always be blind

silent scream in the night
parasites try to hide
behind success, glam and glory
passion dies - all these lies
oppression - fashion - blinded eyes
and the raped tell the story

but don't forget you can touch the sky
(just follow your heart)

you can't get out - with eyes of a stranger
can't get out - you'll never stand on lies

so scream and shout
with eyes of a stranger you'll always be blind
