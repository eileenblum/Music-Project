Nameless cross on the misty rain
reminds on hopes gone down the drain
you - who's burried at this lonely place
were proud to be a man as you lost the race

or did you cry in vain
did you scream for your mother but she never came

dead soldier - what was your age
as you died - were you still a child in the cage

you were food for the guns
missing in action like a billion sons
with no chance to get old
if you'd been a coward - you're a hero in my eyes
if you've been a cold killer who believed their lies
i'll pray for your soul

and so I bow my head
as I sit at your grave and remember the dead
who died for another one's pride

cemetary dawn - traces in the darkness
cemetary dawn - shadows of the past
cemetary dawn - faces of the pain will last

all them faceless gods of war
what the hell are they fighting for
losers &amp; winners - all the same
victims of that vicious game

or did you cry in vain
did you scream for your mother but she never came

dead soldiers - what was your age
as you died

cemetary dawn - traces in the darkness
cemetary dawn - shadows of the past
cemetary dawn - faces of the pain will last
