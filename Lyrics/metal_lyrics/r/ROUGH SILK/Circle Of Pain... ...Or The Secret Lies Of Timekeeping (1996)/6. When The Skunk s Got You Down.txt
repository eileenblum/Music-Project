you won't find no satisfaction, brother
when the skunk's got you down
'cause when you smell kinda funny
you can look as sunny as you want
the skunk's got you runnin' in and outta town
There are many kinds of resurrection
Or maybe, interattraction no, even Satan's protection
won't melt your crown
when the skunk's got you down
and you do the crawl
you're fucked up way beyon belief
and that's all.
