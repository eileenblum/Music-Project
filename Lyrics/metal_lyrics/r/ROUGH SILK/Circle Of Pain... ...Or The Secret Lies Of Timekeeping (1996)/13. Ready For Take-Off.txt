[Bonus track on the Japanese release]

I call and under
a red sky I run to you
life is like thunder
I come undone
and blue
and we never shall be satisfied
we'll be dancin' when our future has died
READY FOR TAKE-OFF
READY FOR TAKE-OFF
without a cause
READY FOR TAKE-OFF
cradles of never
wisdom is cruel
or lie? It's not forever
when I touch the fool:
we die!!!!!!!!!!
and we never shall be satisfied
we'll be dancin' when our future's died
READY FOR TAKE-OFF
READY FOR TAKE-OFF
without a cause
READY FOR TAKE-OFF
READY FOR TAKE-OFF
I knew to sing of
I knew to sing of
I knew a world to sing of.
