somebody's out there - calling your name in the night
somebody's out there - somewhere

somebody's out there with the cold winds of tomorrow
somebody's turning the wheels of time
the closer you get the deeper the night
the stronger you feel the more you need
someone to hold you tight
a place you can hide

you and I - invisible
whole life is such a miracle

somebody - somebody - somebody's out there
to name it all legends fall
to tell about it
somebody - somebody - somebody's out there
to blame it all - another wall
to lead me back to you

is there anybody out there - is he wise and is he real?
Does he pay attention when someone cries or what we feel?
Is he reading my nightmares, love affairs, against the wind cares
got to be older or bolder or on my way?

you and I - invisible.......
