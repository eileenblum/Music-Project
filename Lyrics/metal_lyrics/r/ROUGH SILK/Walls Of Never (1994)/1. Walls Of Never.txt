this' one's dedicated
to those who never give
to those who always take and break
to tears and pain they live

this one's dedicated
to those who never care
to those who always preach and lie
and leave you cold and bare

this one's dedicated
to those who make you cry
to those who take your dreams away
and always crucify

born in the age of fireworks
it's a case of do or die
pain causes a hundred reasons fly
walls of never

like a scream of hate in a silent movie
honesty seems out of date
triumph - testament - eliza
raise your glass for those who wait

cause this one's dedicated
to those who still believe
to those who sing and draw write
who try, protect and weave
walls of never...
