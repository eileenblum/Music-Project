maybe I'm a sinner - maybe I'm a fool
maybe I'm a prisoner of the everlasting rule
maybe I'm a looser - maybe I need a priest
maybe I've seen too much and coming of
the beast
some call me a traitor - some call me a saint
some call me a coward and what I'm sure
I' ain't

and I'll never go back to silence
and I'll never go back to war
and I'll never know what the reason is
and what to be fighting for
and I'll never be a warrior
and I'll never be like you
and I'll never kill tomorrows life
whatever you may do

I'm always gonna hate what you want

remain in silence - purple heart
whatching the nightfall - waiting for the start
give words of desire to my song
words of fire for my soul to carry on
so take me away from here
destruction, blood and fear

and I'll nevergo back to silence
and I'll never go back to war
and I'll never know what the reason is
and what to be fighting for

(I'm always gonna)
h8 what you want
