Yesterday I had a dream
I walked alone
in the shadows of mind
yesterday our lifes were cream
and reasons shown
were like seagulls left behind
and I'll never say goodbye
to sirens
don't leave me now - don't leave me now

in dark ages
we shall raise our hands
in the silence we shall rise
we got to turn the pages
try hard to understand
wake up - break them bastards lies

don't remember the cries in the night
don't close your eyes - nowhere to hide
don't look away - Don't leave me now

livin' on a timebomb tickin'
it's not too late to stop the flood
boat on a burnin' river
teardrops of blood
traces of the past so dirty
terrify me to the bones
they try to rule the world
made of shit and not of stone

don't you remember...
