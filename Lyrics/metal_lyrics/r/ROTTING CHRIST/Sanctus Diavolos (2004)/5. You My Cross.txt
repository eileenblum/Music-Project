Soldiers, prepare â prepare / Fight for our cause
Soldiers, prepare â prepare / Our cause is Heavenâs cause

Heaven / Graver summon me
Graven my rusty tomb
Heaven / Prophet show me
The omen of virtuous cross

Mortals, prepare / prepare / Die over the fightâs field cause
Mortals, prepare â prepare / Out cause is Godâs cause

Heaven / Graver summon me
Graven my rusty tomb
Heaven / Prophet show me
The omen of virtuous cross
The price to guard the virtuous cross

Heaven oh Heaven / Way to mayhem
Sins number seven / Welcome to Heaven

I will die for the virtuous cross
As this is asked to me from hyper force
I will die for a host in Heaven
It will give to my sins a shelter

Soldiers, prepare â prepare / Fight for our cause
Soldiers, prepare â prepare / Our cause is Heavenâs cause

Heaven / Graver summon me
Graven my rusty tomb
Heaven / Prophet show me
The omen of virtuous cross
The price to guard the virtuous cross
