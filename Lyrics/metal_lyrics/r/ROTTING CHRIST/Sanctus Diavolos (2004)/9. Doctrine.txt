Idealism / Materialism / Skepticism / Pragmatism
Electism / Fideism / Immortality of the rational soul

Free inquiry for the one that is the flame of life
Pure power to the spark that keeps the fire bright
Offspring of evidence ambiguity of reason
Reasons for what had happened but have no reason

Idealism / Materialism / Skepticism / Pragmatism
Electism / Fideism / Independence of sense / Perception

Onus for the existent, inheritance of a different purpose
Release of a man's estate tranquility on that cosmos
Setting the minds on the bright prospects
Awe the emotions of a luminous project
Reveal of nature becomes apparent
God proves with his act the existence of madness
Offspring of evidence ambiguity of reason
Reasons for what had happened but have no reason

Lawless wings of doctrine
I revive and search
Lawless wings of doctrine
I imagine, break all chains
Lawless wings of doctrine
I squatter and I confess
Lawless wings of doctrine
I produce and I create
