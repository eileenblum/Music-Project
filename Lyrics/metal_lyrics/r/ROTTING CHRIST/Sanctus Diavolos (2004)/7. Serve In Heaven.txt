Feel your sense that burns

Serve in Heaven or rule in Hell
Serve your instincts or reveal the sense
Inhale the fear or spit the distress
Blind on tear or behold the revenge

See your soul that melts

Enlight your soul with fakes / Foggy hopes so gray
Believe your senseless pain / Rise up the lambent flame
Feed your ignored will / Being ingratiate
Name the soul's existence
As a son without birth

As a son without birth
As a flame without blaze
Name your soul's
Existence as a dead that is awake
As a leaf that dying drained
As a dream that fades away
Serve in Heaven
Or rule in Hell

Feel your sense that burns
