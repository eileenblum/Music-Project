a deadly song is coming
meet the sound of waves
the blind wizard
stands on the highest rock

remembers all that's seen
and makes pessimistic prophecies
these are his latest hours
in the mortal world

atheron charon's beloved child
comes singing the march

the sun, the water, the land
the old man loses his sense
after the bright light
a yound soul released
an old body floating on the sea

the poorest side of the universe
among wild horizons
you'll feel the immortality
you'll step on the opposite bank

a body became a prison
an eternal soul
come to me
you will be able
you go everywhere
you see everything
