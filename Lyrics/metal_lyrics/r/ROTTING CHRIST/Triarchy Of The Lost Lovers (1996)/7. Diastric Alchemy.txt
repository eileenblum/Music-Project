carbonic meteorites
volcanoes throw cold
volcanic explosions
the universe's bond

priceless treasures
the explosion born
buried forever
under coal

surrounded by thorns
unwrought stones
amphoras and bones
those cultures that are gone

beyond all fantasy
somewhere in polar stars
never imagine
the mineral world

confused planets
alchemy
relightened stars/alchemy
stench of fumes/alchemy
a diastric alchemy

lave - refresh the cold
moon dust - above all
solomon - your treasure is held
wisdom - the universe's law
