all my dreams take me backwards
i can see a little child
his mother in black

Kissing the dead brother
(it's snowing still)

Kissing the dead brother
(it's snowing still)

in a pleasure touched by death
snow falls, cover the body
cold doesn't touch her
ice melts as the warm tears fall

in a lake of white
swans stare at their direction
sad they live
strange birds are coming

Kissing the dead brother
(it's snowing still)

Kissing the dead brother
(it's snowing still)

although early the night falls
tears turn to ice by cold
the snow covers his body
and the snow stops falling

[Whispers]

all my dreams take me backwards
i can see a little child
his mother in black

in a pleasure touched by death
snow falls, cover the body
cold doesn't touch her
ice melts as the warm tears fall

Kissing the dead brother
(it's snowing still)

Kissing the dead brother
(it's snowing still)
