Open me a gate
Through the red sky
Give me the power of two lions
The eye of the falcon
Your blood in my veins

What destiny will follow
Under your divine will
Into brave lands
I will drift

Semigod from your love with a mortal
woman
Half man, half god
I threw my soul
Into your world

One wise - eye God
Only sly evil eye
And the magic following me
Nothing can scare me
Nothing moves me
Nothing burns me
Nothing kills me
Nothing beats me
