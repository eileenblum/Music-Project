Let the silence talk
Let my fire walk
The path of despair
Confess your sins if you dare

I play with fear
Guilt is coming near
Challenge me
But don`t judge me

The tree of my pride
Has grown up so wild
I`m the one who endures
Ira incensus

All efforts in vain
My life is pain
I`m reaching the truth
And death is the proof

The last of my kind
I`m losing my mind
The pain has gone
But I`m alone

I fight on my way
The skills i have shown
Abandon, desert me
The secret is going to break me
I cry for me
Despair is all I see
The night is spreading
My life is ending
