Full moon - raise the rainbow
The sea experts - prepare the bow
An optical miracle - a moon as high as one

It buzzes around your ears
An easy day will follow the twilight
It must be the last full moon
It's near the promised time

Two thunders
High strain
Threaten the mankind
Among two storms

It's hot although it's midnight
The mothers died at once
Father itself the rainbow
Both sons will last no more

The thunder bears two mothers
The mother bears two sons
Echoes in the distance
All turn to sun's size
