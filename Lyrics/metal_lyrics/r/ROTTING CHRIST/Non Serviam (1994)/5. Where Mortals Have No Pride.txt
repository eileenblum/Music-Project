Ride this glorious night
All lords from beyond
Galaxial dust above the cosmic temple
Decisions have taken
Stars turn to dark
The chains are tighter
Slaves turn to blind

Bleeding knowledge wasn't enough
Universal deity stand so high
Unfair crime malicious war

The tormen's cries religious lust
Stones of snow
Massive jail
Masochits love
Slaves of ice
Twelve thrones / Around the temple
Twelve kings / Twelve sons
Twelve kingdoms / Twelve new planets
Where flames burn the flesh
Where ice cold the soul
Where mortals have no pride
