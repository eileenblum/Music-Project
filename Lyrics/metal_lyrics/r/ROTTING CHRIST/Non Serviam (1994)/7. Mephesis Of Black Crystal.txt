Nost I'm the Glory
The symbol of Lory
Bring me the crystal
Univerce i'm your lord now
Panthers around my throne
My daughter's blood
My palace appear
Mephesis of black crystal
Carry the charriot
I ride tilveria
The crystal in the right side
Winged plasma
You will never arise
Clean as the water
You'll see into my soul
The rings in my fingers
Each word each order
You'll never smell the flowers again
You'll never see the ocean
The crystallic orizon
I paint all the walls in black
