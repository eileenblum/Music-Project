Mystic passage in saveland
I saw all glory in black gold
The earthly dwelling a crypt of cold
I experience my-self into known maths
Escay of dawn
I'm alone
Transformed into stone
Saturn unlock avey's son
Volcanic explosion
Tartarus son
An unnature embryo
A horrific born
A gold bell, a black ring
The kiss of Musthmur
Bless him
Oh faithfull servant, oh faithfull beast
Flatter my will, follow my path
Revive my wrath
Romanian moon, the count rides moonlight
Call me to serve him, release him from grave
Onward to the mountains, the wild castle wear its black
With respect I obey the blood land
I kiss the ground my lips on red
