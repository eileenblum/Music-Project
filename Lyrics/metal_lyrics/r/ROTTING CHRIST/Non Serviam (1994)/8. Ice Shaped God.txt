Petrified shadows
Malevolent motives
Open the fifth gate of lent
Enter to a snowy fantasmagoria
Emerge from nowhere
No father no mother
An unnature utterus
The white seas with dead fishes
Without sense
Feeling logic
Completely cold
Crystalized the riversides the hills
Glacial Strength
From the glacial era
Torment in icefall
The ice shaped god
As lernaean hydra recover its plagues
Throw onself into a fight
Long for its predestination
Opposite to the hot rays
Into the propylaea of victory
Adapted to human form
Bodes ill for the country
The fall of man
