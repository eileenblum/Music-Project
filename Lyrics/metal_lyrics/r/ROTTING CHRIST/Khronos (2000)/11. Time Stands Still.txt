Time stands still
Like a sad young boy
Staring the ground
Making no sound

Time stands still
He refuses to walk
Talking through the lie
Just trying to die

Time stands still
But why move
When I am not warm
Till I taste blood

Time stands still
Like a small blond girl
Just playing dead
Her throat is red
Time the eternal meaning of pain / the only creature to stay
Silent emperor in my dreams / take my soul and strip it

Time stands still
Holding his breath
Begging for a death
But she is deaf

Time stands still
He can wait as I
Kill time and feel
Until you spill still

Time stands still
Like I wait for you
Like you are here
When dawn is near

Time stands still
Has embraced my life
Living in the ground
Doesn't make a sound

Time stands still
But why move
When you are not cold
Yet to unfold from a pill

Time stands still
And he knows I will
Wait till you you're shown
For the perfect dawn you feel

Silent emperor in my dreams

Time stands still
Like a sad young boy
Staring the ground
Making no sound or a kill

Time stands still
He refuses to walk
Talking through the lie
Just trying to die he will

Time stands still
But why move
When I am not warm
Till I taste blood from a kill

Time stands still
Like a small blond girl
Just playing dead
Her throat is red but she feels

Silent emperor in my dreams

Time stands still
Holding his breath
Begging for a death
But she is deaf and real

Time stands still
He can wait as I
Kill time and feel
Until you spill your thrill

Silent emperor in my dreams
