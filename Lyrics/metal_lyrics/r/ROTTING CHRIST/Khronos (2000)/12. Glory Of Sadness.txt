I was straight asleep / it was that night
I felt into it so deep / then I saw this light

You've been there /  I can only tell
Suddenly scare /  your fear I smell
Past dressed in blue / blue of silence
I wish I knew / the depth of ignorance

The wind was whistling / a great new song
I started wondering / saw before long

I sank into darkness / no strength left in me
I found nakedness / nothing else to see
The glory of sadness / death for death
The arrow of madness / the target is myself

Vague thoughts torture my head / you raise your  veil you raise your name
Always fight never fear / cold dark night the battle is near
I sensed danger caught in a trap / it took an instant the struggle was sharp
I remember what you had said / the challenger will prevail
I remember what you had said / the challenger will prevail

I was straight asleep / it was that night
I felt into it so deep / then I saw this light
Far beyond this world / a new one lies
A seret I've been told / I saw it with my eyes

You've been there /  I can only tell
Suddenly scare /  your fear I smell
Past dressed in blue / blue of silence
I wish I knew / the depth of ignorance
