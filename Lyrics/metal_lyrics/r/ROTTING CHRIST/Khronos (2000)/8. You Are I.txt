When you are sick / I'll be the cure
For your sadness / I'll be the laugh
When you cry / I'll be the tear
The carmine one / so full of fear
When you're down / I'll be the wings
That raise you higher and higher
When you're blind / I'll see for you
I'll see through me / It's strange but true

When you are sick / I'll be the cure
For your sadness / I'll be the laugh
When you cry / I'll be the tear
The carmine one / so full of fear

In a way I shall be unbearden your cross
And i a way you'll feel my pleasure
When I touch you my instant fear
When I am you I feel my death is near

When you are cold / I'll be the fire
That keeps you warm / cremates your dreams
When you sleep / I am in your dreams
Within your soul / and watch your sin

In a way I shall be unbearden your cross
And i a way you'll feel my pleasure
When I touch you my instant fear
When I am you I feel my death is near

When you're in doubt I'll be with you
I've barely fought since I first saw you
When you're weak I'll give you will
The shelter you seek sound to feel

When you hurt / I'll be the pain
The sweet and last / that falls with rain
And when you die / in your pale hands
I will lurk and I will stand
In a way I shall unbearden your cross
And in a way you'll fell my pleasure
When I touch you my instant fear
When I am you I feel my death is near
