Total darkness / I feel so empty
Death and silence / is this remedy?
Undying light / frightful laugh
Unspoken might / unequal fight

I was fast asleep / it was that night
I felt into it so deep / then I saw the light
Far beyond this world / a whole new lies
The secret I've been told / I saw it with my eyes

Dangerous eyes gleamed like fire
Unending lies unfulfilled desire
I had the intent to express my innocence
I am endless I am fearless
Too many answers only one matters
The downfall is imminent, ruthless ignorance

You remind me of times long past
Fear within me grew really fast
I feel so cold inside memory came to me
Matter of pride. Anger runs through me

So we have parted unseeing unchanged
Who's defeated? Who eliminated
Dangerous fire burns within me
I am endless I am fearless
The downfall is imminent, ruthless ignorance

[Chorus:]
My sacred path I follow you
I made on oath I fear and trust you
I have lived for a thousand years
I implore no more full of my own fears

Total darkness / I feel so empty
Death and silence / is this remedy?
Undying light / frightful laugh
Unspoken might / unequal fight
