After one of my thousand lies, you shall all die

Three thousand years
Waiting to be born
In my mother's womb
Searching for a soul
Silence, a gift of speech
Blindness, eternal vision
Time a trusted friend
God, my son to be born
My eyes have seen / spectacular darkness
My ears have heard / incredible silence
My mind has thought / remarkable nothingness
My truth lies in nothingness... nothingness

Trust me, I shall stab you in your back
See me, I have died in the past
Hear me, I scream my silent thoughts
I am the liar

After six thousand years I shall be born
In my mother's womb searching for a soul
Silence a gift of speech blindness eternal vision
Time a trusted friend God my son to be born

Three thousand years
Waiting to be born
In my mother's womb
Searching for a soul
Silence, a gift of speech
Blindness, eternal vision
Time a trusted friend
God, my son to be born

Trust me, I shall stab you in your back
See me, I have died in the past
Hear me, I scream my silent thoughts
I am the liar
