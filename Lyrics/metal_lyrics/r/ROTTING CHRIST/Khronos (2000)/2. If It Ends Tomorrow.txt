If it ends tomorrow / if it begins
It gives me no sorrow / no tears will fall to my lips
I don't know the feeling / I haven't felt this before
It is scaring / more than I thought more

On my last day / I felt alone
For you I pray / Your hope will betray (you)
In the desert land / I felt fear
You grabbed my hand / I need to be here

If it ends tomorrow / if it begins
It gives me no sorrow / no tears will fall to my lips
I don't know the feeling / I haven't felt this before
It is scaring / more than I thought more

So close to me / the younger must stay
Nothing more to see / nothing more to say
Coming to an end / before the night is over
Trying to pretend / the time is not over
Emotions hard and rough / I am getting old
Is it enough? / this isn't the goal
The cure I can find / only deep within me
No man can save me / no man can help me

Untouched / unexpected / unfulfilled / maybe forever
My soul has been taken away
Undying / unreal / unconcerned / it's now or never
My soul has been taken away

On my last day / I felt alone
For you I pray / Your hope will betray (you)
In the desert land / I felt fear
You grabbed my hand / I need to be here
