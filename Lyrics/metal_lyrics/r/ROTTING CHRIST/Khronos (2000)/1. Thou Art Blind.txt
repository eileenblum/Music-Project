When you die I hear my name hear my name hear my name

Try to complete myself again in your eyes in your gold
Everything embraces decay black as sea fool as I
Nothing can reduce the painful of death death as black
When you die, I hear my name cold blood

Try to add and to divide in your eyes black or gold
Everything to learn you hide rubypainruby bride

Try to count how many sins black old seablack or cold
Since I feel good I am clean bloody cold earth comes white
Nothing can reduce the painful of death death as black
When you die, I hear my name cold blood

Be the law art thou as pride / law of blind / law of blind
Truth is what for someone died / blood / crawled

Be the form that none will bind
The whole world will be your mind
Keep your search and you will find
To see all or to be blind
Learn to climb the holy stars
Learn to walk the universe
Learn to bless and to reverse
Be the mouth of every curse...flood...fold

Try to complete myself again in your eyes in your gold
Everything embraces decay black as sea fool as I
Nothing can reduce the painful of death death as black
When you die, I hear my name cold blood

Be the law art thou as pride
