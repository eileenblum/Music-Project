I am the one that lead you
I am the one that hurt you
I am the one that breaks you
Inside your brain

I am the one that crushed you
I am the one that rapes you
I am the one that conquers you
Inside your brain

I am the curse that hunt you
Before the death abandons you
Before your life start to fall
I am the curse you ever wish to throw
So o not cry and obey me
I as the fate am here to stay
To crush to rape to break you
I am the curse that abandons you
...I am the sin that opposes you...

I am the one that delights you
I am the one that calms you
I am the one that excites you
Inside your brain

I am the fate that leads you
To the eternal valley of pleasure
You desire me I know that
But you will never get me just for that
So cry and obey me
I as the fate am here to stay
To lead to calm to win you
I am the curse that abandons you
...I am the sin that opposes you...

I am the curse that hunt you
Before the death abandons you
Before your life start to fall
I am the curse you ever wish to throw
...I am the sin that opposes you....

Crush. Rape. Conquer you
Break. Hunt. Oppose you
Kill. Destroy. Obsess you
Kill. Destroy. Opposes you
