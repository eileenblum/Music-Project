Aclo Savaoth soth
The final chapter
Winds of chilling mayhem
Reborn through uman blood

Narahousa raped and disgraced
Singing ancient necropsalms
They tresspass with no fear
The mystical acheron

Marking the point of voris
In the dust of IBN Gazi
They wait in silence
The cryptic sacrifice

Transformed into the winged leizard
Floating in distant unkown zones
Learning the parallel of Y'R
To welcome the great whore of babylon
