Bleeding sky is tonight
Seperationof gods
Blasphesy's cries (inthe middle hill)
Divine ghost

Black the cross, bloody thorn
The horn shaped against the holy son

Infernal land
Scream the sky
It's tonight or yesterday
Blasphemy in godland
The holy land is offensed

Sabbatic light, the goatshaped
It's the final fullmoon
