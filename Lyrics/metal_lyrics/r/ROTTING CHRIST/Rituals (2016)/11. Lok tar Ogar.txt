[Bonus Track]Lokâtar ogar â Lokâtar I Menimus

Ashdautas Vrasubatlat â Afar Angathfarta
Lokâtar ogar Shara- Mabaj bot ob armauk
Amal Shufar, at rrug- Ambor mabas lufut
Kagh! Bin mog qâthazag cha !- Fit'chure! Lokâtar ogar

Lokâtarogar â Lokâtar I Menimus

Logreâgard Nor Kal â Gimbatul uruk hÃ¡
Bin mog qâthazag cha â Mirdautas na oras
Mabaj boto ob armauk- Ashdautas Vrasubatlat
Izg Lok-Narash- Ugh Izg kun Lok-Regar

Lokâtarogar â Lokâtar I menimus

[Translation from Orcish:]

Victory or death â Victory Menimus

Someday I will kill you - By the forge of my soul!
Victory or death humans - I have a world of enemies
Where there's a whip, there's a way - Liquor after war
Run! I will protect you! Fire ! Victory or Death

Victory or death â Victory Menimus

Where do you want me? â Find them Uruk Hai
Run! I will protect you! A Good Day to Kill
I have no enemies - Someday I will kill you
Arm yourselves! - .... Ready for orders

Victory or death - Victory
