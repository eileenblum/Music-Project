It's the day of coronation
As the years passed (we celebrate)
The ultimate unholy domination
A tribute to the serpent king

In front of king I stare
At the golden crown
Half dressed the colourfull lined skin

He bows as the crown
Adore the naked head
The serpent all time creeps

In the name of Serpent
In the name of King

At the throne serpent lay
Eat (ravenously) raw fleshes
Sarcastic pay for human tribe
Among the flames the sky eyes

Coronation of the Serpent
