In front of me, the red ocean
Where no limits, no motion below
A mystic way to underworld
For million years and more

So wild call me
To fall down
Its red waves await me
Show me where I belong

Painted in colours
Mesmerised in purple
I trespass with no fear
Frontiers and doubts

Above the highest
Teach me where
All powers come from
Tonight my voice will echo in Abyss

For years falling down
The doop I'm here for
The promises beyond
A new reality I adore
