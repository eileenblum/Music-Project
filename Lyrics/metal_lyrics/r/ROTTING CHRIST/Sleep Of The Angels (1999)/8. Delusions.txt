Take me in a heavy sleep
In adventures I've never seen
In a dimension before death
Mentally lost always have been

If none of us / return from death

There is so a weaving
To explain life
In a place
There is no life
What I adore
Is lost behind

All the figures feel like me
How can I feel as pain does not exist
Here knowledge meets nothingness
A lost dream, a psychotic feast

If none of us / return from death

There's so weaving
To explain life
In a place
There is no life
What I adore
Is lost behind

I have no advice
How I could
It seems so cordial
But in a way it's not

[Chorus]
Delusions: lead my like
Delusions: name all my life
With a picture of an empty heaven
A clear distinction

Between death &amp; joy
