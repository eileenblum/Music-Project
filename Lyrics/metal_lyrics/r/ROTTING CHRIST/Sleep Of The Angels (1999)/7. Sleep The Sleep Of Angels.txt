In the darkness
Of the years that went by
I see through loneliness
Only fear pain and lies

Fear can take my soul
Just like the odor of death
Changes me as a whole
Makes me hold my breath

Sleep the sleep
Of the angels
Let my eyes sweep
This beauty that excels

[Chorus]
Delicate silk all memories
Cuts through my brain
Can't see the mysteries
That made me so plain
They can't be seen
They can't be heard
Just like a sin
Always there to hurt

Another day has passed
Another night is here
Eternal end and start
I sense guilt coming near

[Chorus]

Uneven fight
Me against my wills
Under moonlight
Remains only my sense
You can break the spell
Tranquil my mind
I had been so blind

[Chorus]
