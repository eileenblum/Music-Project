The cold twilight
Was giving way
To that frozen night
When he started to say

Through you eyes
I can see
None of your lies
Convince me

The dancing shadows
I wait to appear
The omen that shows
You are here

[Chorus]
Away from you untrackable
And yet near you untouchable

A sudden fear came into me
The night is here it circles me

A sudden fear
Came into me
The night is here
It circles me

The silver of the moon
So intoxicating
I'll see them soon
It's almost scaring

[Chorus]

Undoing hatred
Reflected the gold colours
Golden fire and red
The black of death follows

[Chorus]
