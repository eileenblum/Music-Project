It's all the same
So dull so plain
I need the spark the flame
To drag me out my insane, of my insane

Only you and me
Face to fate
Come and lead me
To another place

A circle is my mind
A triangle is my soul
I move only behind
I must be reborn as a whole

[Chorus]
Only you and me
Face to face
Come and lead me
To another place
Where I can taste
The black of purity
Nothing more
Nothing less
Escape or seek a caress
After dark I feel
I smell the pain
I revive and heal
And this is my gain

It calls me near you
Some cosmic will
I want to hold you
The lust to feel

It's all the same
So dull, so plain
I need the spark, the flame
To drag me out of my insane, of my insane

[Chorus]
