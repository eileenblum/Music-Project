Clouds of guilt gathering
Into a sky of bitterness
Rain of tears comes from walls
I once cursed
Children of the one entranced,
Celebrating so blind
For the desolate feels none
Of his lost glory bat awe

Behold! the serpent's fear,
Forgotten emotion
Since the first fall of tear
Wisdom's failure knowledge
As the tree of life decomposes here

The seventh and the liar,
Underneath the innocence disguise
Fools! you who laid your faith
In prophecies of deliverance

[Chorus]
The world made end - never to be spoken
The world made end - cease of immortality
The world made end - a name revealed
The world made end - empyria drowns

No furious beast shall reign
Before the days of wrath
Wait for no lightbringer
As stars fade away
