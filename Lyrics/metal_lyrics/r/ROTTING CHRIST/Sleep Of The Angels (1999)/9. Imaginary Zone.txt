I am trying to explore
The mountain of mystery
I envy and adore
The myth and its history

I am in the house of dreams
A different dimension
Nothing is as it seems
An altered direction

[Chorus]
I can rest, I can't hide
Wondering if I feel like
Crossing to the other side
Is it different or the same
Yesterday or tomorrow
There is no difference
Joy or sorrow
I have no preference

For the time I wonder
That has long before flown
Am I remiss or a fighter?
I have never known

[Chorus]
