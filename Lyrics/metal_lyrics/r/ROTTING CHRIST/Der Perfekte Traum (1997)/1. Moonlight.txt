LONG SUPPRESSED DESIRE
LUST BECOMES RAGING FIRE
FEEL THE PAIN INSIDE ME
LET MY SOUL FLY FREE

I TRAVEL THE FOUR HORIZONS
THE SEVEN SEAS I CROSS
SHAPES, FEELINGS, ICONS
SENTIMENT AND PATHOS

[CHORUS]
FEEL, DENY, REVEAL REGAIN
TOUCH MY SOUL PART ONCE AGAIN
AND SEE INTO MY EYES
NEVER AGAIN WILL I DREAM
NEVER AGAIN WILL I SCREAM
ALL MY SENSES ARE SHARP LIKE ICE

DEATH WITHIN A CRY
NO AGONY, NO LIE
WHERE IS THE BEGINNING?
THERE IS NO MEANING

I DIVE INTO FEAR
THE BREATH OF NIGHT IS HERE
UNDRESS MY BODY AND MY SOUL
AND TEACH ME MY ROLE

[CHORUS]

YOUR HANDS ARE NETS OF GOLD
THAT TRAP ME IN YOUR WORLD
A WORLD OF LIGHT
A MOONLIT NIGHT

[CHORUS]
