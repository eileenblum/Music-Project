[Kreator cover]

Dark shadows lie

Over the city
Tonight someone will die
You can hear painful screams
The air is full of flies
Mayhemic legions are ready
To steal the human souls
Come into my vault and do like you get told

I'll eat your intestines
No matter if you pray of please
I'll bring you down to your knees
Tonight you're gonna meet your fate
You try to run but it's too late
I am here to liquidate

Time to raise the flag of hate
Destroy the earth is our only aim
To strike all down is the only way
To give 'em death and let them pay

The galleys of the underground
Sail on the sea of blood
All that we want crucify your god
The posers on this earth have no right to live
Torture is what we give
