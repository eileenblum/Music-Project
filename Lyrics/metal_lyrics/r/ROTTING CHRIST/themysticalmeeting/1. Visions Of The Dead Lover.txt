The old glory is failed
The old emperor in a lonely empire
Eternity so shiny
But followed by no one

Among the crowd
Princes 8 kings
Those who defeated
All lovers... of monarchy

The sky is mourning
Near to the sun... human blood
It's too late for nation

After this misery
A bigger one is coming
The promised centuries... recycling

The dog have died
Around the tyrant

Mythic sovereigns
In sea and land
Shout loud
But voices come back

The eagle has throwned
The beast has enough
The days of the omen
Visions of the dead lovers
