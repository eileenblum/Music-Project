We are all devils and make this world our hell
Exiled angels that wallow in sin and curse

Make your choice, wish you well
Serve in heaven or rule in Hell

A fool's paradise is a wise man's hell
Love delights, forbidden apples

Hale hellfire, burning spell
Our Heaven is their Hell

The Sons of Hell - The Sons of Hell

Heaven shine bright, but so do flames
I see the light, I see the shades

Pay the price choose your faith
Burn in fire or live your death

Your mind can make a heaven of Hell
A hell of heaven, a magic spell

Make your choice, wish you well
Serve in heaven or rule in Hell

Heaven - Fire - Heaven - Pyre

The Sons of Hell - The Sons of Hell

Make your choice, wish you well
Serve in heaven or rule in Hell
