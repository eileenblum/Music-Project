Hallowed be thy name, hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be the fire, hallowed be the fire

Hallowed be thy name, hallowed be thy name
Flames and pyre, flames and pyre

Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be the fire
Hallowed be thy name
Flames and pyre

Hallowed be thy name, hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be the fire, hallowed be the fire

Hallowed be thy name, hallowed be thy name
War and fire, war and fire

Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be the fire
Hallowed be thy name
War and fire

Eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth
Burn for burn and wound for wound
Love for love and guile for guile
Blood for blood and blow for blow
Eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth

"I care not:
It is an heretic that makes the fire,
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
But this most cruel usage of your queen,
Not able to produce more accusation
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
Yea, scandalous to the world."
[William Shakespeare]
