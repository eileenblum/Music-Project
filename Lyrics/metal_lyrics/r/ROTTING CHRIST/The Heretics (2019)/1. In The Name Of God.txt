"Since man cannot live without miracles, he will provide himself with the miracles of his own making. He will believe in any kind of deity even though he may otherwise be a heretic, an atheist, and a rebel."
[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]

Flames
in the age of hell
in the age of fire

War
in the name of God
in the holy empire

Burn the witch in pyre.

Death
in the name of God
in the name of fire

Love
for the grace of God
for the saints for liars

Fire
in the name of Lord
to impure desire

Lord
you the greatest one
blow up the pyre

"O Lord our God, help us to tear their bodies to bloody shreds with our shell. Help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded."
[Mark Twain]

In the name of God
in the name of fire

For an endless life
in the holy empire

In the name of hell
your soul inquires

The warmth on my face
is the hot of fire

"The world itself is the will to power â and nothing else! And you yourself are the will to power â and nothing else!"
[Friedrich Nietzsche]
