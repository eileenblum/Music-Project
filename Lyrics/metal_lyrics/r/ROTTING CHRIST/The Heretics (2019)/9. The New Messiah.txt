Hey, God intends to light your way with fire
Save my sinful soul and show the faith with pyre
Lord and liar

Pray! Fall on your knees and call my name Messiah
Shame, shame on you that feel and hate desire
Gods and liars

In the name of the God and the holy spirit
Pray for my sins please relieve my pain
In the name of the Son and the holy spirit
I obey you to follow my path of death

Blood of my blood
We are not one!
