"Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities."
[Voltaire]

Blazing up the fire, burn my sacred sins in rain
My beloved desires, die out and lost in pain
Wealth dreams and pyres disappeared in foggy day
Marbled old Messiahs betrayed me hard and loudly I pray

Gloria-Patri

Burning hopes and voices, calling loudly my name
Silent words and noises whisper loudly and say

Gloria-Patri
