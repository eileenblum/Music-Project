Pray for the earth, for the forest, for the fire.
Call all the spirits of the globe and desire
All power that comes from within.

Crimes in the name of the gods and the power.
Now, I feel that brightest hour
To come back to life after being dead.

Hail to the gods of fire and hail.
Hail to the gods of pyre and hail.
Hail to the earth, to the air, to the rain.
Thanks to the gods for the air I breath.
Gods of the Earth.

In our eternal touch with the nature
We see communions of life and death.
We see their joyous inseparable unity.
We learn that life is as beautiful as death.
