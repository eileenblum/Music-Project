Nocturnal fog cover the rivers
The poisoned water of Esgalduin
The cursed bride of Pyramis
Embody to the Nereid of Esgalduin

After the wind appears
The blood kiss on her lips
She wears the crown of beauty
Obsessed by the thirst of power

Taste the life of her victim
Bodies swallowed by the river
Her majesty in the emerald throne
Praidly haunt the nights of Arabaum
Engaged with evil
Slave of the most dark illusion
Oh oh my queen
