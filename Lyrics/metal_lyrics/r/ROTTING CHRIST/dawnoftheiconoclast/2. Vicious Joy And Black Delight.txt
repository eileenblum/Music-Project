Ancient soul in another skin
Shadows fall deep within
The mystic wood open at night
Vampires creep in dark light

Vicious joy and black delight
Behind each kiss a poison bite
Exposed to darkness once more
Proceeding in evil deed at gore

Concealed deep inside coffins
For ages now begins to raise
Spirally walking just like apes

Feasting their ultimate triumph
Baptized in the unholy catacombs
They drift await but sleep await
The cry of their victims
The lives they take
