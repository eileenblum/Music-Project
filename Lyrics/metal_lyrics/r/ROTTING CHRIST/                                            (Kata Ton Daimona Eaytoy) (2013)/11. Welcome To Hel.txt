[Vinyl And Digibox Bonus Track]Welcome to hel - Welcome to underworld
Obey my name - This is your scary world

[Chorus]

Don't fear the night's uprising
The anger of the Gods
Don't fight the wick with yearning
A battle that I have won

Welcome to hel - Welcome to my dark world
See how the flame - Burn your ultimate hope

All I see now - death and life
All I hearn now - Prays and lies
All i feel now - Wrath and spite
I swear to the gods - To kill and die

[Chorus]

Welcome to hel - Welcome to underworld
Obey my name - This is your scary world
