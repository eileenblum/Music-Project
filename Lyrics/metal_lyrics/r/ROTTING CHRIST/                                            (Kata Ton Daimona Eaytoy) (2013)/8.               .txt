[Chorus I]
Rushalka spirit wrathful
Rushalka ghost unfaithful
When you hear me when you see me
Then your life has no meaning

Is a swan's song, hear and die

[Chorus II]
Rushalka demon naked
Rushalka wood nymph unwedded
In river's bottom she will take you
And forever there she will keep you
Rushalka spirit wrathful
Rushalka ghost unfaithful
When you hear me when you see me
Then your life has no meaning

Look at me I am dancing - Hear me I am singing
Come here darling - Death is what you feel

[Chorus I + II]
