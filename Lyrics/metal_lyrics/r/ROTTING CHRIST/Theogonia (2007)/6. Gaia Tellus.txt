TERRA GRANDIS MARIS SPIRITUS EST
MATRIS STELLA AC CAELUM EST
IMPIUS EST
Earth, uterus of stars and sky
Mother of the highlands
Womb of ocean and arid sea
Let your seed create the barrows
Gods' dweeling so hallowed
And chain and gain the reign
Let your seed create the Cyclops
Monsters one eyed so robust
That crash and strike create
And offer this good to human race
For power and glory to gain
And offer this good to human race
For defiance and pride to strain

[CHORUS]
To dele and vanguish the sorrow
fullfill their vision to reign
Upon god's dweeling the hallowed
their existence to gain
TERRA GRANDIS MARIS SPIRITUS EST
MATRIS STELLA AC CAELUM EST
TERRA GRANDIS SPIRITUS EST
UTERUS MARIS IMPIUS EST
