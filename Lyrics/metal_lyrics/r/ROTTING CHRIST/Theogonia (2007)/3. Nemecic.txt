[CHORUS]
NEMESIS
NEMESIS COME BORN
COME BORN DARKNESS CHILDE
NEMESIS
NEMESIS LAST BUST LAST
BUST THE HOLY RITE
Is this the land where sun brightly shines
is this the existence of a heaven's sign
Is this the locus the hallowed focus
where grace love and harmony combine
Is this the stead where reigns the light
is this where hate bids
Hear those souls' cries do they beg do they smile
do they follow the endless long line
NEMESIS FOR THE ANXIOUS HEAVY
SPIRIT

[CHORUS]
Lay down their souls with holy fears
and waters the ground with dismal tears
Soldiers of grief prepare we are near
fight the pash with shields but without spears
Hold by the whispers that summer breeze bears
and reign the land where all the woes bear
Hear those souls' cries do they beg do they smile
do they follow the endless long line
NEMESIS FOR THE GENERATION FREE

[CHORUS]
