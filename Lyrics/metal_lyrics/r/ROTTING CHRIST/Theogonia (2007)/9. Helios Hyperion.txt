I am the titan (Helios Hyperion) ruler of the earth
lord of upper and under cosmos
I govern the weakness
in every cry of every man
I am the Cronus offspiring of earth and chaos
I teach you the art of war far in your sleepy subconscious

[CHORUS I]
And hype up the will of vengeance
And draw down to earth by spells and wickedness
The joyful color is for me
What does paint your soul with weaknesses
And break up your sacredness
And bless the impure with joy and rawness
Supreme victim is for me
What is haunt with tear and prayer
I am the Cronus offspiring of earth and chaos
I teach you the art of war far in your sleepy subconscious
I weep your weakness fluid that you are calling tear
And face the Angel that dread to dare

[CHORUS II]
And crush the tyrants iron head
And become a tyrant in his stead
Supreme power is for me
What it flows from anger
And look down on and snigger
The apathy of mind and bring them
The art of blowing up the teen
and be the fortune's stringer

[CHORUS I]
