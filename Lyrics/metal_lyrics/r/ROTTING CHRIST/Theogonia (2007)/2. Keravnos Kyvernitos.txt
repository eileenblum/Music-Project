Strike
thunder
sons of earth and sky
Clap
lighting
childe of a glorious night
Loud and proud
transform the entire range
And bear
and grant
yourselves in human race
Where their sun does never shine
And their lands are nude and bare
Strike
thunder
monsters one eyed
Bear
and grant
yourselves into mankind
Loud  and proud
transform the entire range
And bear
and grant
yourselves in human race
Where joy and lust dispel in air
And feel the breeze as frozen pale
And when the dews of night arise
Wet their souls with holy lies

[CHORUS]
THUNDEROUS UPRISING
THUNDEROUS UPRISING
Oh you sweet love in despair
LIGHTING RISING LIGHTING UPRISING
Unmask your face of sorrow and care
Sense the anxiety's fear
That shall never be quite till laid on its bier
