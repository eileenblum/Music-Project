Hey little kid come here, believe in us and be like us
Taste the sapor of the forbidden seed
Drown the awe breath, far in your azure deeps
Fear ain't your foe but you're ally to meet your dream

Show me your bound to show you the heart
To outdo your awe and brave become
Drown the awe in your azure deeps
Fear isn't your foe but you're ally to win

Whisper the reason that doubt yourself
To trace the path of braveness and strength
Bury the awe in your nightmare's shelf
Nothing to fear but fear itself

Show me your bound to show you the heart
To outdo your awe and brave become
Drown the awe in your azure deeps
Fear ain't your foe but your ally to win

[x2]
Phobos has just be born and sent to mortal's world
To kill human's immortality hope
Phobos has just be born the hidden awe of god
The awe for freedom and his throne loss

[Charles Manson's speech:]
You people have done everything in the world to me.
Doesn't that give me equal right?
I can do anything I want to you people at any time I want to, because that's what you've done to me.
If you spit in my face and smack me in the mouth and throw me in solitary confinement for nothing, what do you think is gonna happen when I get outta here?
