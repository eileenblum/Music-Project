Beyond inconceivable agony, to the dark tunnel of pain
I here your voice flickering, into the silent drop of rain
I here your cry of despair, the expectancy of escape
Please help me, help me, help me, get me out of here:

My words have been lost, my fright has brought
The unexpected, vision that shakes me
My limbs have frozen, my hearts beats so strong
Am I dreaming? How real the feeling?

Beyond the wall of truth I here myself crying
Searching for a exit on a foggy side of life
I need to find the line, I am forced to touch the sign

Where das salvation dwell?

My soul praises the light, surrounded by the night
My wishes perished, all hopes vanished

My body fades away, illusions painted in gray
Am I living or am I dreaming

Beyond the wall of truth I here myself crying
Searching for a exit on a foggy side of life
I need to find the line, I am forced to touch the sign

Before the dawn I am buried
Into the tunnel of death
I here your voice that begs
For an exit to escape
Before the dawn I am buried
Feeling so dull so plain
Your fate starts to fade
It's time to face the flame

[CHORUS]
It's time to face the flame
It's time to face your dream drowned in pain
I stare and then stare again
There is no place just counting days

My hopes have been lost, my heart beats so strong
I am not dreaming, true is the feeling
Counting the time - so alone, expecting the inevitable
Shredding my wishes scatter my feelings

Beyond the wall of truth I here myself crying
Searching for a exit on a foggy side of life
I need to find the line, I am forced to touch the sign

Before the dawn I am buried
Into the tunnel of death
I here your voice that begs
For an exit to escape
Before the dawn I am buried
Feeling so dull so plain
Your fate starts to fade
It's time to face the flame

[CHORUS]
