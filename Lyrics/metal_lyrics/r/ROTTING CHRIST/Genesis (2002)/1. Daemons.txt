Draw deeply thy breath
(ÎÎ±Î¯Î¼Î¿Î½ÎµÏ ÏÎ»Î­Î³ÎµÎ¹ Î³Î±Ï ÏÎµÏÎ¯ Î¼Î¿Ï)
Close thy mouth with right fore finger pressed
(ÎÎ±Î¯Î¼Î¿Î½ÎµÏ ÏÎ»Î­Î³ÎµÎ¹ Î³Î±Ï ÏÎµÏÎ¯ Î¼Î¿Ï)
Dash down the hand with a great sweep
(ÎÎ±Î¯Î¼Î¿Î½ÎµÏ ÏÎ»Î­Î³ÎµÎ¹ Î³Î±Ï ÏÎµÏÎ¯ Î¼Î¿Ï)
Expelling forcibly thy breath

Soul with virtues and minus
Emotions that battle with love and hate
Body with instinct and insanity
Sensation of pleasure mixed with pain

Feel the crude natural power
Give birth to what I had dig lower
Evoke the source of creation
Control the power of salvation

Lay down to the powers of universe
Internalize the harmony of universe
Destroy the naÃ¯ve paths of ignorance
Control the inner cries of desperation of vitiation

The purely major
The purely minor
Sign of expansion
Sign of paradox

Touch the joy of the absolute
Wear the mask of fighting rule
Swear the oath of macro
Turn the chapter of micro

Chase the inner freedom
Forbidden paths of liberation
Follow the voices the crush your mind
Beyond the unseen cries of a wasted life

The purely major
