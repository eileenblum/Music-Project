I saw the full face of the menstrual hecate
Four and forty virgins make the form of the gate
It is the key inside me, it is the glyph of the vision
To have a god within, under the name of legion

Love of night manifests infinitely eternally
Love of darkness signifies the enlightened life eternally

Into the divine water, deviation fulfilled
Wisdom is clear, all logic is killed
By the ancient way I project my soul
The task was given it is the death of all

My son has offered blood, his mother her tears
Full of joy they mingle, to feed the fear
Behold the moon is crowned, I raise thy sign
For the lord destruction is always blind

By bliss of pain I move the spirit
Into oblivion calls I will never hear it
An ancient voice calling from the mouth of hell
Beyond this passage there lies hole for my sell

I found him waiting in the name of dirt
Illusion's face my weakness is his strength
1000 daughters bind the runners of pain
Oh be merciful magic with the corpse of my brain

His tongue is nailed with the spikes of Christ
Divides the unity calls death for a life
Laughs at the ground that keeps the realm gold
Another still life for me to love for me to grow

[CHORUS]
Another life for me to love for me to grow in sadness
It is the key inside me to have a good within in the name of madness
