I am trapped within a fabled dream
The one that hunts at the edge of horror
What do I love there is no form no being
To witch I do not give my self alone

Awake from dreaming the truth is the known
Awake from waking the truth is unknown
Show me the dream that leads me to trueness
Show me the truth that releases me from madness

Awake from dreaming, awake from waking
Show me the dream that leads me to the truth
Show me the truth that wakes me from the nightmare

I am trapped within an unending line
The one that hurts the value of hollow
What is the sign, what is the omen?
To witch I have to base upon

The truth that dwells in the dark night of soul
Beware of every herald of the dawn
Find me the soul that truth doesn't dwell in darkness
Find me the herald to proclaim me the sadness
Find me the silence the light side of truth
Fill me with hopes with reasons with wisdom
Awake (me) from dreaming that truth is the known
Awake (me) from waking truth is unknown: the fear is the known

Law / reason / time / space blind us to truth
All that we know is that we know not
Law / reason / time / space blind us to truth
All that we know is that we know not

The truth that dwells in the dark night of soul
Beware of every herald of the dawn
Find me the soul that truth doesn't dwell in darkness
Find me the herald to proclaim me the sadness
Find me the silence the light side of truth
Fill me with hopes with reasons with wisdom
Awake (me) from dreaming that truth is the known
Awake (me) from waking truth is unknown
