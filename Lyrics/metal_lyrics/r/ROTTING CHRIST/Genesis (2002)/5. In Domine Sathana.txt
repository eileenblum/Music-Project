SATANI

Vital existence to those who claim indulgence
Being captured to the wasted bright of displeasure
Cordial existence to those who refuse abstinence
Trapped in the swinging hope of eternal pleasure

[CHORUS]

Unsullied wisdom to those who strikes the ingrates
Relieved from the pipedreams of a decadent power
Fulfilled desire for those who accomplish their sins
Escaping from the naked side of expurgation

[CHORUS]

They want you dead, your unsullied wisdom a lambent flame
They want the sigh of your existence, the star of sustenance
They want you alive, prophet and slave of the glorious one
They want you secret your fainting will for eminence
The shadow of the omnipresent, feed to your indulgence
Feed to your abstinence, feed to your ignorance
Cause:
OBLIVION DECAY AND DEATH
Three of my children without birth

[CHORUS]

Vital existence to those who claim indulgence
Being captured to the wasted bright of displeasure
Cordial existence to those who refuse abstinence
Trapped in the swinging hope of eternal pleasure
Unsullied wisdom to those who strikes the ingrates
Relieved from the pipedreams of a decadent power
Fulfilled desire for those who accomplish their sins
Escaping from the naked side of expurgation
IN NOMINE
SATANI
AVE
SATANI
