All I have dies by days
All I want has your face
All I see has your name
All I love dies in pain
All I aim is for you
Entire afflictions is sad but true
All I tell you is the truth
Dying off a way to ensure

All I dream is fading

All I dream off does fade
All I love hides away
All I live for makes me die
All I feel truth of lies
All I own lost too fast
Hyaline dreams that all disappeared like dust
All I touch begins to rust
Creaky castles in the sand
All I will my will knot
All I live with will rot
All I knew leaves my brain
All I aim dies again

[CHORUS]
Broken dreams that fades away
Like muddy footsteps in the rain
Dusty hopes frozen lies
Reveal the end so lost behind
Silent screams that wipe away
Seeking life in my brain
Broken hopes unending lies
Reveal from fog the rusty life

All I have dies by days
All I want has your face
All I see has your name
All I love dies in pain
All I aim is for you
All I tell you is the truth
All I dream off does fade
All I love hides away

[CHORUS]

All I love makes me die
Like deep blue painting in the twilight
All I touch tern to dust
Creaky castles in the sand
All I own lost too fast
Hyaline dreams disappeared to dust
All I live with will rot
Forbidden lust to be reborn
