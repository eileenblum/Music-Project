Aclo Savaoth soth
The final chapter
Winds of chilling mayhem
Reborn through human blood

Marking the point of voris
In the dust of IBN Gazi
They wait in silence
The cryptic sacrifice

Narahousa raped and disgraced
Singing ancient necro-psalms
They trespass with no fear
The mystical Acheron

Transformed into the winged lizard
Floating in distant unknown zones
Learning the parallel of Y'R
To welcome the great whore of Babylon
