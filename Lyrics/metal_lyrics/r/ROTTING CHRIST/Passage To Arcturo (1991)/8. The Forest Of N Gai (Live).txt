All powerful messenger
from the world of 7 suns to the earth
the forest of N'Gai, where we may come
the one who is not allowed to be called

It would be abundance
from the black goat of forest
goat with the one thousand infants
ITHAKUA will serve you
Oh father of million delights
and Zaar will be called from Arcturo

It's order of OUME AT TUIL
you will glorify Azathoth
and mega TSHATHOGUA TOGETHER

This was originally out in 1991, but was reissued in 1993 with some bonus live tracks.

Thanks to raksaza for correcting these lyrics.
