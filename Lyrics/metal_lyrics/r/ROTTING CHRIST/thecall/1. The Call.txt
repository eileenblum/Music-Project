I saw the lightness
The point of no the return
I Felt the power
The call of silente death
I face the silence
The awe of the Earth
And I regain
I fly and I serve

I show the pictures
The memories the names
I hear the quietness
The empty of outer space
I met my nightmares
My memories my pain
Itâs time to gain
my burning life again

Hollow like hallow
And follow the sorrow

Shadow with sorrow
And follow the hollow
