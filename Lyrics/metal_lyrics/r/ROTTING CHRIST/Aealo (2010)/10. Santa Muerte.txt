God bless - God bless - God help - God stead
Your dread - Your dead
Who died in the name of Revenge - revenge - avenge
Vengeance scream loud - your dead
Who burn young and died off
God bless - God bless - God help - God stead
Your dread - Your dead
Who crawl in the name of...
Revenge - revenge - avenge
Vengeance scream loud - your dead
Who rise in the nightfall
And under your cruel eye outworn
Are wondering why they died for!

God bless - God bless - God help - God stead
Your dread - Your deads
Who trail and kneel your law
Revenge - revenge - avenge
Vengeance scream loud - your dead
That enemies sword accept with awe
God bless - God bless - God help - God stead
Your dread - Your deads
Who blinded from your crown
Revenge - revenge - avenge
Vengeance scream loud - your dead
Who their hopes built up with straw
And under the threat of a hellborn are
Wondering why they died for!

[Chorus:]
Is this the holy thing to see and die
Is this what forbid my heart's delight
Then a dubious being and weak am I
Without caring if I live or f I die

Mortals face your holy dream tonight
The sky, the earth, the sea belongs to thee...

God bless - God bless - God help -God stead
Your dread - Your dead
Who blinded from your crown
Revenge - revenge -avenge
Vengeance scream loud - your dead
Who rise in the nightfall
And under your cruel eye outworn
Are wondering why they died for!
