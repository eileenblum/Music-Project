Thou on the cross, for you shall fight
Dead arch dead march embattle and fire

Thou on the cross, for you shall fight
Thou on the cross, for you shall die

Thou on the cross, for you shall fight
Thou on the cross, for you shall die

[Chorus:]
Soldiers be prepared, prepared!
Fight for our cause
Embattle cruel to waste your soul,
Our cause is heaven's cause
Soldiers be prepared, prepared!
Die for an absurd law
Sharp your arm that sharp your heart,
Be worth of our cause

For a voice like thunder and a tongue
To drown the throat of war
When the senses are shaken
And the soul is driven to madness
Who can stand, who can stand
When the souls are torn
To everlasting fire

[Chorus:]
For a scream like rumble and a tongue
That spit the curse of war
When the senses are ablazed and the
Soul lead the flames
Who can stand, who can stand
Thou on the cross, for you shall fight

[Chorus]

Dead arch dead march
Embattle and fire

Now I see the light
Light me a light, any kind of light
Will I ever see this green green
Landscape bright
Will I ever feel this spring
Breeze and delight
Now I see the light, now I see the light
