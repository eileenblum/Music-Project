Cast him down to the dungeonsÂ 
Similarities will overwhelm him there
Between reality and despairÂ 
And the cage within his eyes

Descend my friend
Cascade with unfeathered wings
The passage you took
Is frozen in time

Descend my friend
Cascade with unfeathered wings
The passage you took
Is red in the sky

Try and save his mourning face
Lift his chin and save his grace
A task was given against his will
This is why his feet stand still

Speak his tale of adventureÂ 
Whisper his tale of despairÂ 
For this lost cause once had a chance
A chance which was built on trustÂ 

Shades of whiteÂ lifting him nowÂ 
Waiting for death, free his captured soul
Shades of white,Â lifting him now
Its time to leave its time to die
When he closes his eyes
Waiting for death

Falling down
A silloette of angelsÂ 
Lifting him now
A new sensation
Falling down
