Its fair to say that we have failed
blame stops here but leaves a trail
A euphoric vision so maliciously twistedÂ 
He was fighting for the causeÂ 
now heâs fallen by the swordÂ 
beyond your understanding time stands still

Look now your hands are weakÂ 
Pathetic creature you created this
A self-destructive existence without logic
So expected this ending is sick
You are standing on those close to you
As you try to compute the sum of all fears

Our kind has flaws in every way
Time has given us nothing today
And now we suffer to balance the equation
What happened inside those eyes
A perfect world collapsed and died
A stranger to reality no defences

What just happened? Why did you destroy the day?
What went wrong? Was silence the only way? Â 
Was this the only way?

Genocide, starvation
And another soldier falls today
Holocaust? a terrorist?
Still mindless violenceÂ 
Due to human nature

Take their freedom, and take their willÂ 
Then you gain control right at your fingers
Lose the power and you cannot kill but the next one standing takes control
Â Â 
With death the only way
