Spending his days forever deep in thought
Of better times far away from horrid cries
They promised a life which had light in every sight
But never again will he see his childâs eyes

And now, the grand memory
Watch it light the fire

He fled this land, three long years itâs been since then
Performing tasks with his bare worn handsÂ 
And now his mind is set on leaving this cold land
To mend the aching bleeding heart in the sand

And now, the grand memoryÂ 
Watch it light the fire
â¦And burn in the night!

Weakened by the chances that the madness may return
he turns back to the darkness and all of which heâs learned

To find his path and belief is all itâll take
Shed the weakness and build a new memory
From now on crucial success is here to stay
Watch him live a life of beauty in each dayÂ 

I will search the distant waters
I will leave no stone unturned
To complete a chosen destinyÂ 
Or this face will forever burn
