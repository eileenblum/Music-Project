As the bird of prey watches (slowly)
Gazing down upon the hordes (scrutiny)
Desperate Lives scattered to the fringe
But not before the slaughter falls

A thousand years
A thousand choices
Whereâs it gone and whatâs become of it all
Slow beginnings, ending too fastÂ 
Here we waitâ¦ Slaughter falls

Raining down upon the masses
Falling spheres unknown to man
Societyâs lost, crumbling to pieces.
Evil force together with plans

Hidden beneath the surface secrets alight
Crying for salvation
Trails of spoken words
Never believed, war is conceived in the madness

I'm waiting till I've seen the one for me
The one that will cure the case for agony
I'm waiting till I change my views on life
In memory this world will be rid of the misery
Â 
Iâll be there waiting for scattered dreams
To unfold in this world

If we wait 'till the final hour
Than its all too late
All will be lost
We've got to wake

Democracyâs shot to piecesÂ 
Leaders leading a world of their ownÂ 
Workers engaged in the labor of living
Masses rendered impotent
