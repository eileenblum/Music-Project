The Demons are enclosing
Washing away your dreams
Time becoming still
Everything you thought youâd be
Confusing shades beliefsÂ 
All thatâs left is grief
A part of the earth you adopt
The emptiness must be stopped

Big surprise youâre leaving me behind
Now Iâll falling behind time

Strengthen my weakness
Craftsman of deceit
Weaken my strength
Sweetheart of betrayal
Weakness my strengthÂ 
Narrator of nightmares
Building my Weakness
Labourer of grievance

A world urbanised by guilt
Enjoying the failed state and destroying what makes us live
Enjoying what makes us die the ultimatums are rejected
Offerings without peace and a declaration without war

Trial and error your paths
New mistakes will cost
Hands upon your faceÂ 
A past you canât retrace
Looking at this picture
Knowing this moon wonât shineÂ 
As midnight comes callingÂ 
Your might is now fading

Big surprise youâre leaving me behind
Now Iâll falling behind time
Yesterdays verse will be sung todayÂ 
With a dark deserted soul I will fade away
