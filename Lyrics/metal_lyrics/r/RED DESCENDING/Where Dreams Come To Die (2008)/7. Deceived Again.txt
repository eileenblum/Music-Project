Heâs been cheated again
For this boyâs done nothing wrong
Deceived again
For he has been trying so long

This time its fate you has made a man
His world starting to decay

Heâs feeling the fever of been told its no more
The small boy disappears before his eyes
Heâs trying not to look backÂ 
But I canât imagine a future without me
Heâs trying not to look backÂ 
Living life as an eternity
Heâs feeling the fever of been told its no more

You tried me so many times
You failed me so many times
Surprised me so many times
You killed me so many times

This young boy's done nothing wrong
He's been cheated again
Deceived again he's nothing to blame

The fight is no more and his vision is grey
Against the odds, an opening mind
before your eyes thrown back in time
he's been trying for so long
this time it's fate that has made a man
