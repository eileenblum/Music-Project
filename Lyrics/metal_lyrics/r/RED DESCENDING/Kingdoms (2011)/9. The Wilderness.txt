Through fire and ice I struggle through a new day
When it's hot I'll burn when it's cold I'll freeze
And see the freedom, keep fighting till I say
We are tough we are strong we are not the slaves

And as the earth continues to change
The story moves on but we're the same
And through the sickness we beat all the odds
We climbed so high now we're our own gods

I've done all I can to respect the prophecy
Worshipped the sun who said to me what to see
Now we've come to realize our fate
Its up to us to find the truth

Before we find the liar we must cut back our desires
Burn it ail, pull it down, pave our way
How's mankind been so blind?
In time we'll find a single mind

Here's the day we repent our sorrow
Far away from the roar of the crows
Today is the day when we scream for freedom
Can you feel that this time it's not the same

The fallen ones have left us
With our axe in hand
And when destruction cursed us
We built from sand

The fallen ones have left us
On these barren lands
And when destruction cursed us
We took our stand

One day you all will see
What I foretold
I'm here to live forever
In this wild world

Lie awake in the wilderness,
See serpents in the sky
Lie awake in the wilderness
As time passes you by

I lie awake in the wilderness,
See serpents in the sky
I lie awake in the wilderness
As time passes me by
