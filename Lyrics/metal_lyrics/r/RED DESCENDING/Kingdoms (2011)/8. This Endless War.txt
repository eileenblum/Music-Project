Here I drown as seasons change
Tried to cope with anxiety
I can't see what is slowly killing me
The force of evil penetrates my dreams

Now I turn into insanity
The fire is alive and burns inside of me
Hope dead and buried of a life with any sleep
A mind-controlled disease will be my legacy

Violent raging thoughts save me from this endless war
Violent misplaced trust, stop me from misguided lust

Tear apart rationality
To find the key that lifts me off my knees
consequence that I'm fighting my beliefs
To understand this mind kills stability

I have not seen through this war
I've reached up to the sky but crashed and almost died
The journey's almost over I can see it in my eyes
Ten thousand needles piercing at my skin

This sickness over time has shattered my last fuse
Rage and brutality beckons my next move

Before I am dormant I will take you1 into my next world. Bastard!
And sleep will no longer be my downfall. Anymore!

As I watch this brain decay
As I run through obscured rain
Into darkness I feel the shame
And it crushes me again

And the reaper has seen my face
Seen it wither and waste away
Time forgotten, these endless days
This fading mind a cold embrace
