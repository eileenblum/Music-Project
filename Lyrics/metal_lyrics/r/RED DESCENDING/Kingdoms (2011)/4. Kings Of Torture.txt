The night is ours
Time has passed
We bleed the same
Bleed the same!

The dark night is ours
Night has come
We are returning
Before the moon

We have turned
To the grave
We punish ourselves
To the brink of destiny

To save our souls
To save our sons
Before we burn in hell

We are the Kings of Torture
We are the Kings of Pain
We are the Kings of Torture
We are the ones to blame

The night has challenged me
And through the act of 
ealousy I will live for eternity
And keep fighting the black disease

The more I stay awake
The more I feel I have to take
Was freedom such a big mistake?
Feel it leave without a trace

And though the water's still
We carry on
We find our will

With violence all around us
The thought is never ending
Never ending
With violence all around us

The violence, the power
The dark night is all around us
Dark night is all around us
The thought is never ending
