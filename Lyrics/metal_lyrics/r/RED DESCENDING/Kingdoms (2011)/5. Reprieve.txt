Until our time runs out and we all have died
Until your mind is gone and your mouth is dry
There will be resistance in your life again
To show you what was once your master plan

And though the journe's long
We know we must be strong
And rise above the setting sun
Through pain, grief and disease

Before the night is gone
We count the fallen ones
And sing to our forefathers' sond
Believe in this reprieve!

The breathing wind, has forgotten why
The beating sun, it no longer shines
The crushing clouds of yesterday's tries
Dry earth, rotting flowers, hear their cries!

Light the pathway until the sea grows
After tomorrow our march continues
My life is full now, I've seen the new crown
A great memento, wait till they see us!
