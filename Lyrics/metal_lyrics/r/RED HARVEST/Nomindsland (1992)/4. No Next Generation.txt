pulsing, floating, infiltrating, somethingâs wrong inside my body
emotionless, it burns my flesh, and I donât feel so good
this is it, oh I know it, it never crossed my mind
it would come to this end, now itâs done, I canât turn time
but hey! Who said Iâd live for, ever, although I thought I had
time to spend yet there will be, no more games to play, gameâs over
the mutated, highly contagious, man made virus, no cure to save us
in conclusion, no illusion, there will be no next generation
yesterday I walked the streets, to find another survivor
the only sound me heels against, the pavement cold and rainy
the neon signs still screams out, buy this, buy that! But none listens
thereâs got to be someone out there besides myself
canât be that Iâ am the only one left here
but thereâs none responding to my cry, is there anybody there?
the mutated, highly contagious, man made virus, no cure to save us
in conclusion, no illusion, there will be no next generation
war research death to earth, war research, death to earth
the silence complete now, except for a single, bird sings the requiem for
a world now eradicated, the epitaph will read:
this planets people solved their problems, like none ever had the guts to think of
final solution, total resignation now complete
a world without people, a world without life
behind drawn curtains I close my eyes thinking of all that were and never will be
again, and outside the planetâs left alone forever in orbit and itâs a worthy end
the mutated, highly contagious, man made virus, no cure to save us
in conclusion, no illusion, there will be no next generation
no more, no more, no more
