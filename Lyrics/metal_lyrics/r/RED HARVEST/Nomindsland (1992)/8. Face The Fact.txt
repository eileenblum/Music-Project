Demonic structure arise
Infernal death, toxic demands
Nature abrogate
Mental death is suicide
Entering realms of extreme reign
A date with fatal solution
The new era will come
Sadistic instinct in command
Fatality degree
The system malfunctioning
Entering realms of extreme reign
Riding hard to the final day
No control
Weâve lost our sight
Thereâs no way back if we wonât
Face the fact, today
