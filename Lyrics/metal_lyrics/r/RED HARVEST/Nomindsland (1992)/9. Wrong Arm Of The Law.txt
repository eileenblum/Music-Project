The battle will go on and on, youth who dare confront the lies
Heads held high, theyâre standing tall, against the uniformed fools in full control
Clear the area, go home, donât  you dare to speak our whatâs wrong
Front to front, eye to eye, the ones who dare and those who obey the lies
It ainât no crime to kill someone
In the name of order and control
It ainât no crime to hurt someone
As long as you stand on the right side
It ainât no crime to kick someone
When thatâs what you get paid for
Ainât no point in holding back
When youâve the right to make an all out attack
Mad arm of the law
Wrong arm of the law
Strong arm of the law
Mad arm of the law
The battle will go on and on
Heads held high, theyâre standing tall, against the uniformed fools in full control
it ainât no crime to kill someone
in the name of order and control
It ainât no crime to hurt someone
As long as you stand on the right side
It ainât no crime to kick someone
When thatâs what you get paid for
Ainât no point in holding back
When youâve the right to make an all out attack
Mad arm of the law
Wrong arm of the law
Strong arm of the law
Mad arm of the law
