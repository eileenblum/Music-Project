join my picnic in the dark
to find fungus in the park
as I eat and grasp and grawl
I see some changes in my world
suddenly, the grass begins the talk
and even the benches start to walk
I turn around and yell out of fear
I eat to scare the leaves away
acid, acid
I seek for shelter in a woorden house
I am chased by a shit huge mouse
I run up to the attic
I am pale with panic
I parachute through a window
and in my flight I see an angel
she helps me as I fly down
but I crush my head when I hit the ground
acid, acid
acid, acid
kills
