wake up people, this is the news
the world is trembling
too many leaders, too many fools
too many people, serve as their tools
how do you think it feels for us youth to grow up in this dump youâve made
how do you think it fucking feels to stand desponding as you do whatever you can do
to wipe all living off this earth
there comes a time when we got to, pay for all the things you have done
we will take the burden, pay the price for your fucking games
act like machines
think like machines â nothing at all
praise the goddamn technology
abandon your soul
abandon your mind
abandon your free will â and free life
on a golden plate you lay your own future, to be spoiled, then thrown away
to be ended on the industrial garbage heap
created by the use and throw away ideology
there comes a time when we got to, pay for all the things you have done
we will take the burden, pay the price for your fucking games
emotionless and preprogrammed
thatâs how it is in a machines way
wake up people, this is the news
the world is trembling
too many leaders, too many fools
too many people, to serve as their tools
how do you think it feels for us youth of today, to grow up in this dump youâve made
how do you think it fucking feels to stand desponding as you do whatever you can doe
to wipe all living off this earth
there comes a time when we got to pay for all the tings you have done
we will take the burden, pay the price for your fucking games
emotionless and preprogrammed
thatâs how it is in a machines way
