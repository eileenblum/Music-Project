Hello my dearest friend
Iâm glad youâve come to take me back again
To the place where I belong
To the place where the weak are strong
Iâve loved you since the day we met
I need you more than anything
But deep inside my fucked up mind
I wish I had the strength to leave your rotting world behind
Crackman, Crackman, Crackman, Crackman
I worship you in every way
Youâre the master, Iâm the slave
I kill so I can get some money
Iâm the bee and youâre the honey
Crackman, Crackman, Crackman, Crackman
Crackman, Crackman, Crackman, Crackman
