for damn too long Iâve lived my life, thinking, speaking as I was supposed to do
playing my part just for you, succeed in life, be one of us
straight forward on the safest line, well hell I got some news for you,
I want responsibility of my life
I wonât sustain your dogmas, or speak your words and claim them as my own,
just to please you, the authority
but itâs hard to raise your voice, with an Uzi in your back
I revolt, I disagree with the norms set by the old men
I speak up, I will be heard, words of change wonât be unspoken
all as one, Iâll be myself
one grey mass, I wonât abide
that is how, I wonât succumb
it should be
I know I have a different point of view, and I know thatâs not acceptable to you
you will do, the will hell I will
as youâre told, I will go my own way
oppress the thinking, they might think the wrong way
applaud the thoughtless, their guided easily
it was my belief that even the minorities, had a valid voice in our society
maybe I am wrong but I had an illusion of the perfect
an utopic dream of a world where I could dwell
optimistic people have a lack of useful information
distorted eyes canât see beyond the life which clouds the future of our lives
now you see, leave me alone
and now you know, I canât take no more
youâre too small, just leave me alone
and weâre too strong
lift the burden of an independent mind, off my shoulders, my dreams I resign
all you need, I kneel before you
is discipline, lick the soles of your feet, I close my eyes to the world outside
I will live my life, silent, obedient, now Iâm afraid to disgrace myself
in front of the righteous majority
my revolt seize to exist, to the approval of the old men
I remain forever silent, words of change remains unspoken
