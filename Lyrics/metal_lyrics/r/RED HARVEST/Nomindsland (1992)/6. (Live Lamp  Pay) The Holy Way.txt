dance for me, show me the pleasures I wanna see
slavery, masses hails me in ecstasy
controlling, pray! I own you oh yes I do
the cheater leads the blind, so come on and join, the Jesus rockânâroll
enter this world of insane, explore my psycho domain
give me cash, or thereâs no hope
just pay your god or take the rope
half man, half god I am
follow me to the promised land
but first youâll need the key, the key youâll get by paying me
hey! Come on and pray!
listen, hear the angels sin
I, the man you adore
you, disciples of mine
sinners, reform and pay my price
am-ex or check, Iâll accept you bet
all I want, you as an echo of my opinions
oh I hate, opposition the work of Beelzebub
cause I own, the exclusive rights to the spirit world
so follow me, hell isnât the place to spend eternity
fear of death, is what this fraud is based upon
religion, a lucrative business, religion
enter this world of insane, explore my psycho domain
give my your cash or thereâs no hope
just pay your god or take the rope
cause the lord has come to me, speaking in my dreams
fall down to your knees and pray and, join the Jesus rockânâroll
hey! Come on and pray!
listen, hear the angels sin
I, the man you adore
you, disciples of mine
sinners, reform and pay my price
am-ex or check, Iâll accept you bet
amenâ¦
