electric shocks, injections, filling me, with more drugs
lock me up, tie me down, this is the cure, that heals my mind
lost in a world of black, trapped within naked walls
is it my fear of reality, or the realities fear of me?
am I destructive, they say I am, am I a danger to society?
why do they keep me inside this cage, once you're inside there's no way out
cuffed inside these naked walls, an none ever hear my calls
I cry, I beg, I pray to be free, but there's no hope in hell for me
confined within, I live my life inside
lock me up die me down
change my will, change my soul
give me dope, punish me
hide me from reality
the cure
who is the fool I say, who is the ones who make all things blow away
and call me a lunie huh?
you are like mice, lost in the haze, inside a world built as a maze
you're moving on, you act so wrong, you think it's strange I'll never cope?
death, is your way
power, is your game
truth, you ignore
falseness, you obey
Iâm not the one who should be here, you are the ones, you are the ones
confined within, I live my life inside
lock me up, tie me down,
chain my will, change my soul
give me dope, punish me
hide me from reality
