White lines
Of life and lies
Trigger me up
Until the day I die

Too soon, too much, too far
Coagulation for my deepest scar

Another line
Just to boost my high
Sub zero tolerance
IÂ´m in denial [x2]

Feed me
Another line
Kill me
Just one more time
Give me
Just one reason to live
Is this
Not the season to kill

An adrenalin rush
For my darkest fear
As I touch the sky
I know the end is here
