Someone has found the Antidote
Someone has found the Antidote
To human suffering
Wipe us out - of existence

A denial
For a denial
As the table turns
The Big Eye is watching you

I am duality
Duality is a part of me
Come in intergalactic space command
Darth Vader rules the Vatican

A denial
For a denial
As the table turns
The Big Eye is watching you

There is one at the door
At the Gate
To Damnation
There is one at the door
At the Gate
To Damnation

There is always room for one more
Till the end of creation

Creation/damnation
