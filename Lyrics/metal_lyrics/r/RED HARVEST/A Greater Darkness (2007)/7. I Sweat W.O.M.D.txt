I give in - my long war
Against gravity
I think I'm done now
Reach down inside
And take as much as you need

Our Universe Is A Hologram

Who is The Freak?
Bury The Freak

Feels like talons
Are scraping the inside of my scull
I sweat Weapons Of Mass Destruction

The rain pours from a cloudless sky

Darkness gives life
To greater Darkness
Fears give life
To greater Fears

I sweat Weapons Of Mass Destruction
