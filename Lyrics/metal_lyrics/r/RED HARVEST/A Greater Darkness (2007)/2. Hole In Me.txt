There is a hole in the world
There's a hole in me
Treading On Thin Ice
Between the worlds

This is the sweet thing
Come on and taste It

Cold wind sweeps
Another kind of dust
How did I get here
When the metal door shuts
The light of day
Is gone

Splintered horizons
Composite realities
Watch me bleed
There's a hole in me
