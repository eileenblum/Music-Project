You're not the first
Surely not the last
To believe you have the answers
And are dead wrong

The Static Link
Between every thing
Is that no one knows
Anything

Distorted Eyes
Can't see beyond
The lies that clouds The Future

The clock is ticking
And when The Hammer Falls
It`s gonna hurt

Cherish the dark
In a ring of Fire
Reach For The Unknown
As The Pages turn
Cherish The Dark
In a ring of Fire
