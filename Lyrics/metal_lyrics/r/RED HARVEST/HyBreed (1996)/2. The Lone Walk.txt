Walk the bridge
Between worlds
Dive into the deep
Naked and alone
Wash away
What needs to be
Left behind
Nothing will
Remain
The same

We're moving in a spiral
Sun Dance in higher places
Remove the curtains
The long sleep is over

Walk the bridge
Between worlds
Under a star light sky
I touch the earth
Wash away
What needs to be
Left behind
Nothing will
Remain
The same
Again
