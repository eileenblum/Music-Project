Diziplin
Control
Law and order
Power demands obediance
I gotta put some distance between
the rest of the world and myself
I need some air
I need some space
I won't be sucked into the hell hole
You call life
Resist
No more sheep mentality
No more sheep
The sheep are gone
Resist
