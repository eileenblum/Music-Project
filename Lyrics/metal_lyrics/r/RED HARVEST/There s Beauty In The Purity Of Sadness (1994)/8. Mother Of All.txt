True hell
Is walking in a blind mans world
with open eyes
Greed feeds
Greed needs
Demand it all
Watch your mother die
It's the same old story
We've heard it all before
It's me myself and I which counts
I dream...
Remove the blindfolds
Before we kill the mother of all
There she goes
The mother of all
Quadrat architecture keeps the peace
Eyes inside a casual peek
A hasty look then the eyelids close
Won't watch our mother die
It's the same old story
We've heard it before
And deep inside of my depressive self
I bleed...
Remove the blindfolds
before we kill the mother of all
There she goes
The mother of all
Our mother is crying
and all her children too
Our mother is dying
and all her children too
