I do as I wish
Therefore you hate my face
I don't speak about saving this planet
While drinking another bottle
Words you preach
Empty words
How can you say
I don't give a fuck
Look at yourself
What have you done
Shivers in my head
You give me shivers all over
Shivers in my head
