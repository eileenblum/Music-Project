Radiation shine on me
let it come and change me even more
Transform us disintergrate
Reanimate us into art
The ancient ones
The long lost made us into art
An abstract substance of life
We're art and we melt
We're art and we're glowing in the dark
We're the firstborn
The last of the lost has gone
I live I glow
I'll shine forever more
I live I breath
My cells cannot die
Radiation shine on me
Praise the art
