Anarchaos Divine... 
Excitement pulsating 
(In Body And Mind)
I have set in motion 
Things That can't Be unchanged 

Anatomy Of The Unknown 
The more time passes 
The more rage I feel 
Closely Monitor 
An approaching disaster 

Bleed... Bleed you fucker 
Bleed for me 
Nothing is real 
Everything's a lie 
Everyone's infected
