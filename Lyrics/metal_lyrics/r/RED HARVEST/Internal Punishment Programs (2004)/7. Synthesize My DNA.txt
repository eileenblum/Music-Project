Push the wrong button 
And atoms split Magnetic 
oceans of solitude - Rise - 
The shadow whisper eternal secrets 

Energy split Molecules split , 
Numbers split Geo-figures split 
Stay in focus... 
Then push return!

As I fall to the field You seal my fate 
Synthesize My DNA 
Factory bastards 
S.M. DNA Electro Magnetic Pollution 

It's a global inferno Of toxic wastelands 
Your brain - is you
