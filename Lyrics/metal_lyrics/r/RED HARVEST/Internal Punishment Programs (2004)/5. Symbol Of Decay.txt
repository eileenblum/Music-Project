I have seen the light 
And it burned my eyes... 
Baptized in blood 
Through raging fire... 

I have seen 
All the things 
I didn't want to see 
I have become 
My worst enemy 

I am scurry 
Symbol Of Urban Decay
Scurry: Symbol : Of: Decay 
Symbol Of Decay

Cold water running Like 
Northern lights Sun everlasting warmth 
Eternal wrath Urban you!
