They are monitoring us 
Watching our every move 
The system is now dying 
But its Kontrol Mekanizm keeps it alive,
defending its existence 
Searching for the optimal solution 

Order - Diziplin - Control 
The shadow government runs it all

Dark actors are playing 
games Using psycho - Electronic-Technology Exquisit mind control 
To organize the masses Avoiding 
reality Toxic belief systems 
Drains life energy Away...

Release the fakking death grip It's brutality in its 
maximum as Wired entertainment... Kontrol Mekanizm...
