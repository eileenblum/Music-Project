New world disorder 
Meltdown of the human lap-top 
You are born into this world 
To protect and serve
Feed the golden vacuum of machinery 

Walking puke 
Living fake lives
You walking puke 

The road map has been drawn for you 
Protect the money flow 
Secure the power players 
The fall of Fate 
Esculates into a wall of hate 

I reject their fakking ways 
I reject every fakking thing 
they say M.O.A.B 
in the da house 
It's coming anyway
