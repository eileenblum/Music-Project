Have you thought about your life today and where it is going
Youï¿½re living in loneliness and running away from the truth
Will you ever come out of your shell and show your vigor
Or will you be living in solitude in your own world of damn lies

You believe the lies you live the lies
It burns inside like a hollowpoint expanding inside of you
You wait and wait for more damn lies

I thought I knew who you were
But you just put up a front
A front of deception and deceit
You have got to change
Or just rearrange your inner self
No one cares for you
How long can you last living alone and confused
The time has come to stop and look at yourself
What gives you the right to decide what kind of person I am
When you believe your own fucking lies

Youï¿½re so fucking vain
You think you know so much
Recycled rumors which turn you to hate
You canï¿½t see through the bullshit

[Solo: Ian]
[Solo: Wu]

Anger rips you open like a shotgun slug blowing out your back
Pain feelings are numb you start to realize that you were wrong
Lying a wake in your bed
Never sleeping after understanding the real truth
(Deceive, inveigle, obfuscate)
