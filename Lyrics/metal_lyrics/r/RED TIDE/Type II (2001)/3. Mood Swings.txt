[Spoken:]
Somewhere time was broken to allow for a million things to change.
Inexplicable turns and unexplainable shifts result in the unpredictable
ridiculousness of now, the craziness of this latest development.
The suddenness of an upside down world. The origin of this present
madness before me.

My eyes wide open
The world makes sense
I only blinked
A split second lost

Changing, deny all that was true
A new world to exclude the truth
Exclude the truth!

Is there something I missed
Between your mouth and my eyes
Between your eyes and my heart?
Something...

One day you will remember everything again
One day everything buried will rise back to the surface
This day there will be another change
In the blink of an eye
This day of realization
This day you will feel the pain

It was so precious
That it now decays
Pieces still rot away
And melt what once was
Down to nothing
