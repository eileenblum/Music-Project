It poured out of my veins
You watched it hit the floor
And you speak of truth [x2]
You donï¿½t know of truth [x2]

You saw my life drain out of me
Every drop that once bled for you
Iï¿½m trying to shut it off to stop my heart
But you rip more and more wounds

I never wanted to believe
I saw only my own dream
The fragile world you built for me
Shattered in my agony [x2]

[Solo: Wu]

Stop it all
(You stopped it all for me)

In this end
You made
Now I know you
But I donï¿½t know
Who I knew
I thought I understood what you saw
And everything that we were to do

But this is not the end
This is not my end
