A little less all of the time
And soon nothing is less enough
A conception of small that canï¿½t
Be seen or measured
Scarping away at the essence
Of everything and substance
Forcing a fit into a size

Impossible and incompatible
Where are you going

Your destination is far off
An infinite distance away
I canï¿½t see you making it there
I canï¿½t even see you now

[Solo: Ian]

Wasting away until nothing at all is left
Fighting to sustain a state of invisibleness
Leaving yourself behind again and again
You will disappear before your true end
Wasting away

[Solo: Wu]

Where are you going
I canï¿½t see you
Donï¿½t disappear
I wonï¿½t to see you [x2]
