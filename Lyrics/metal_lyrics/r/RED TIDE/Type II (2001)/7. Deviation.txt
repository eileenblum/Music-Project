Everything that I wanted
Just opened for me
Living out a dream
Made with your total honesty
More and more times
I spent it all with you
And I come to realize
That this is truth...

Deviate you run from me
Break the dream you helped me see
Sever ties created together
Build the lie

ï¿½The truth will set you freeï¿½

Honesty is buried under dirt of your repression
Bonds build by truth are broken by your deviation
Depart from the light into darkness of confusion
Despair the shooting pain as I hit your wall of rejection

Where is all thatï¿½s true ï¿½ What I gave to you

[Solo: Ian]

Behind your shelter is something you cannot take
A truth that is so absolute it will never break
Reflections of each other so strong we both feel
That nothing can ever destroy something so real

[Solo: Foley]
[Solo: Wu]

So now I ask for you to see. The truth in you thatï¿½s inside me.
And just like me you will find. Something so strong it will never die

It will not die
