There exists only one correct answer
Every detail led to this conclusion
Possibilities fall away one by one
Confidence soars and dizzies the soul
Opinions now give way to fact
Confirmation remains the final link
So intense and focused on one thing
That I missed everything

If I had opened my eyes
I would have seen your lies
I would have known what was going to happen to me
If you had opened your mind
Things would have worked this time
But now I donï¿½t know what to believe

[Solo: Ian]

When the past remained
You push it all
Far ahead
You show me the future I turn to you
You are gone

If I had opened my eyes
I would have seen your lies
I would have known what was going to happen to me
If you had opened your mind
Things would have worked this time
But now I donï¿½t know what to believe

[Solo: Wu]

I am spitting up your lies
And killing that part of you in me
