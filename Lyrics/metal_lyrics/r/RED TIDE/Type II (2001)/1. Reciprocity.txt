Hypocrite, liar, you are nothing but a fake
Plastic face, Full of shit, Full of Lies, you make me sick
You try to play god with your looks and personality
Standing on top of your ivory tower thinking you can't be touched
But!
You're going down
Bring you down Bring you Down
Look in the mirror
Are you truly content with yourself?
(Jealousy, Inadequacy, Insecurity)

[Solo: Ian]

When the demons
Come out at night
What do they say to you
Could you have done everything
You could have done
To be yourself again
Your guilty conscious is killing you
Day by Day
Until you fucking go insane!

Can you live your life as something you are not
Can you play this game forever
No one hears you no one sees you
There's no attention
Its coming to an end
You start the feel the pain from within
Drowning in your own lies
Suffocating from your own pain

No one falls for your lies
The game is now over
You're helplessly drowning
We send you to your grave
Your soul is now dead!

[Solo: Wu]

Insecure selfish bastard
Blinded by your own inhibitions
You're falling, falling down
You have become what you have most despised!
