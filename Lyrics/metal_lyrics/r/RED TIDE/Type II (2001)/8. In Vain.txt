Anger flows through me
Ignited by frustration caused by you
Every heartless word uttered
Another drop of my life on the floor

Every caring advance
Deflected by your shell
Every heart felt emotion
Forced back inside

[Solo: Foley]

Clinging to every word and hope
Only to find contradicted
Desperately trying to reach you
Destroying every wall to find another

{trip at the brain}

[Solo: Wu]
[Solo: Ian]

Held in a cage of your words
Lost confused and helpless
Feeling hatred for you
And disgust with myself

(ode to thrash metal)

[Solo: Ian]
