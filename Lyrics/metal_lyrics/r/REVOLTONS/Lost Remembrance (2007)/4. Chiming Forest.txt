At night time, when shades grow longer
Under an Autumn moon,
The Forest wakes up and
Grim and ghostly sounds out of nowhere,
They cleave the thick and gloomy air
Like a lightning in the storm.

Old trees withered and crooked
By the weight of years,
They seem to look at me.
I feel trod on by the power of this place
As old as the world.

Ancient voices without breath they flap
Flap in the air full of memories and rage.
Oh, please leave me alone
I feel caught... Oh, I am lost!

Candlelights in the darkness, Chimes in the air
And the voices are torturing me
Shrilling and whispering in my head.
Eyes in the darkness, Spirits in the air
And The Forest is calling my soul
Imprisoned in this cage of my mind.

I run blindly along the path
Melting into the darkness
I'm walking on this way
Melting into the damnation
Fumbling for a way out.

A cold wind is blowing on my face
The breath of trees on me
I hope the smile of dawn could make me free

A soft red light on the heights
And slowly the forest stills and freezes
No more sounds in air
Like after a sudden awakening

Trees were trying to speak to me:
Their voices so deep and damned
Thunder in my head.

There is a hidden gate
And they were telling me the way:
The forest breath so deep and damned,
Chimes in the air...
