Sleepin' on the warm shore
An angel and her pure soul
She holds the secret of secrets
And the evil man
Tries to gain the world control

Children of a new world, victims of human fault we are!
Nature seems to reign again, but a menace shows us new pain!

2008 and the earth's axis shifted: The lncredibile Tide!
So many lands will breath no more!
We are the children of the third world war!

The young boy and his first love
Hand in hand they run away
'Till the ashes of the old world
Show them they can rise again!

Children of a new world, victims of human fault we are!
A big tidal wave will rise again, are we ready for this new pain?

We will sail across the seas and oceans to defend Rao's secret
We will fight to defend nature from INDASTRIA to HYARBOR fields!
We are 3 friends bound by destiny, we are the ones who will!
We have to close this big circle, we have to rebuild this new world!

2020 and we are still fighting against world control!
A big crack watches us from under our feets!
Are we prisoners of this great defeat?

The highest energy will destroy the Sun Tower!
But strength and love will win over!
Look at 'The Giant' go down!

I'm flyin' I see you!
I'm flyin' you are with me!

2008 and the earth's axis shifted: The Incredibile Tide!
So many lands will breath no more!
We are the children of the third world war!

A big circle is closed by God's will!
