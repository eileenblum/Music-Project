He digs his hands into these ruins,
Trying to save the broken memories,
A man of sorrow in this society
Mesmerized by his insanity!

Every day in his mirror
He sees the inspiration that has gone,
Then he reads his words of gold,
Worlds of glory where he's been consumed....

"But I'm still strong
And I feel proud,
Closed in my world;
So here I am...."
