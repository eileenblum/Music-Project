Let me tell you about the land of the owls and darkness,
Where the woods hold a future-past gate,
Let me tell you about the red room, the giant and the dwarf
Where the innocence lost its soul: in the lodge!

One chants out between two worlds: Fire Walk With Me!
The right moment and the right place when the time of two worlds unite!

A white circle, scorched oil and red curtains show the way
Cause' every forest has its shadow and its hidden pain
Distorted voices of good and evil souls, nightmares of your past
To face with perfect courage to not to lose your soul!

The grey haired man enjoyed the one armed one's defeat
He's the evil ruler from the place where time can be turned back!
So when the pure soul faced its shadowself the circle was closed
And the mirror turned into the evil man!

One chants out between two worlds: Fire Walk With Me!
The right moment and the right place when Jupiter &amp; Saturn unite!

A white circle, scorched oil and red curtains show the way
Cause' every forest has its shadow and its hidden pain
Distorted voices of good and evil souls, nightmares of your past
To face with perfect courage to not to lose your soul!
