Patriarse, strange events took place
From the square to the poets house,
One man died, one went crazy
And everything began...

Don't keep me here, I'm not out of my head
I followed 'em through the people carelessness!
He's the master and he knows that Satan came....

Another time, another place,
When our lord was preaching on his last days (on earth)
And the procurator was washing his hands of the truth
As he gazed up at the moon!

The master's lover knows that Azazel's not a dream
Cause' our lord wants the devil to give them peace instead of light,
as the master (himself) gave freedom to the procurator!

One day having acquired the power of flight
She begins to avenge the master's ruin,
When the evil lord invites her:
You will be the great ball's queen!
Another place, together again,
And the master's book is back from the flames,
But Satan lies (in wait) while in another time
Our lord introduces the procurator to his creed!

Engaged by Satan, Azazel had poisoned the master and the lover
And he brought them back to life with
The same potinon used to kill,
So with Satan and his followers went to live together forever...

The master's lover knew that Azazel was not a dream,
So the devil gave them the peace, a new life to begin anew!
The procurator now is free: on the moonpath he will see!
