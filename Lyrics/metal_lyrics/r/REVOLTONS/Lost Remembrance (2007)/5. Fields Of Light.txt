Once many years before Christ, there was a man,
So while working the land beyond the river
Some man called him "we need your help!"

Hey Racilia I have to go!
They call me for the well being of us all!
Today I have to stop the only thing I love, with you...

With the greatest sadness, where he felt the Gods,
He had to leave his land, there was a ship for him!
He would fight the enemies of his land!

A simple man fought to come back to... to his field!

They, they said "he a tyrant", but they didn't know
The simple curly man had mind control,
Then they praised him "Oh Conquerer!"

After 16 days he said "No I don't want,
I don't want no honour, I want to live!
And I don't want no power!
I just want my life again!"

With the greatest joy, where he felt the Gods,
He came back to his land, his wife and his three sons!
Yes he fought the enemies of his land!

A simple man fought to come back to... to his field!

"Just tell me why you are throwing all these things away"

"Do you ask me why I do this?
Cause' the light the gods spread glows on my field!"

A simple man fought to come back to... to his field!
A man and his fields inside the light of the gods!
