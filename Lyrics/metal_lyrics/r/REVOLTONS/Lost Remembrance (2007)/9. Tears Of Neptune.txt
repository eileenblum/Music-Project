A tune of sadness
Is going to be sung
The wrath of a God,
Seeing the rising of a new land!

You keeper of this blue world, envied among the gods,
With your trident you show the power of who can touch the light!

And when the rock was rising up,
Out of the endless sea,
The poor God blessed it
And hated it in spite of its beauty!

Double feeling, angry waves, seven days within the storm!
Then he let the fading clouds give space to the new born!

Tears of Neptune...
