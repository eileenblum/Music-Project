Where is the angel I've always looked for?
Where are the symbols that simple people read?
Where are the people that only want to live?
Where is the light that once surrounded me?

NOW IT'S TIME for worlds inside of me!
Am I wise, am I poor or is it all insanity?
NOW IT'S TIME for worlds inside of me!
Inside worlds that only simple people see
NOW IT'S TIME for worlds inside of me!
A new light will permeate me
NOW IT'S TIME for worlds inside of me!
I am wise, not poor, bless me oh insanity!

The beast came down through my veins
Slowly and wise to the core
Inside the slave's soul that once I was
When I cried aloud on the devil's shore
Spending days in deep reflections
The broken wings of pain I've seen
This is the legend of who like me
Closed inside himself to run free....

Many times I fought for love
Walking wasted lands for nothing at all
Every time the chosen road ended into a wall!
The road was mine, I was all alone
Stars and planets smiled at me
Along the path that brings men to be
The inside road of glory to run free...

Now I smile at the rediscovered angel
The devil's shore is only a bad dream
New wings of freedom I can see
The lights of worlds inside of me!

NOW IT'S TIME for worlds inside of me!
Am I wise, am I poor or is it all insanity?
NOW IT'S TIME for worlds inside of me!
Inside worlds that only simple people see
NOW IT'S TIME for worlds inside of me!
A new light will permeate me
NOW IT'S TIME for worlds inside of me!
I am wise, not poor, bless me oh insanity!
