Time is running fast
And now there's nothing
He can do to relieve the fate
Alone in his world of tragedy
Strange thoughts ravage his repented mind

His hands are shaking
Frozen by a cold wind bearer of death
Black silence is the only
Sure thing at last
His body is shaking
Scarred by an eternal pain
Black silence can't be the only
Sure thing at last

The hour-hand is moving fast
And now there's nothing
He can do to relieve the pain
Alone in his cell of death
Strange thoughts ravage his repented soul
He raises his eyes to the sky
Begging forgiveness for his sins

The hour-hand is moving fast
And now there's nothing
He can do to relieve the pain
Alone in his cell of death
Darkness has closed in upon him
