Beg steal borrow desire
A child's heart seemed to expire
No denying a city's a jungle
Rats in the backyard

Big city, hopeless and rough
A child's life stone-cold and tough
Little sneaker, alley sleeper
Prince of the backyard

No career, no tomorrow
A child's day of hunger and sorrow
All dreams lost and decayed
In the dirt of the backyard

Kid from skid row
Tough heart, Hobo

Backstreet boy
Got no joy
But knows how to Cheat on you

Kid from skid row
Backyard, black heart
Kid from skid row
Tough heart, Hobo
