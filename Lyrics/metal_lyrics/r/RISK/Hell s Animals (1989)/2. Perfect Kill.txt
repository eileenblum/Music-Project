Rotten houses near the plant
Slag, refuse are all around
Acid water, plastic food
Tasty radioactive fruits

The ignorance of the statesmen
Leave the crowd between rage and despair
Contaminated bodies
Slow decay of blood
Don't brood over future
Industry rehearse the perfect kill
Perfect kill, perfect kill
Dead don't die, but remain
Near the heirs of their slaughterers

People want to demonstrate
Businessmen rule the state

They call them terrorist
And police rehearse the perfect kill
Perfect kill, perfect kill
Dead don't die, but remain
Near the heirs of their slaughterers
Fear of the dead
Perfect kill
Fear of the dead
Perfect kill
Fear of the dead
Dead don't die, but remain
Near the heirs of their slaughterers
