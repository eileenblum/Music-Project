Betrayal on an island of honourable men
No place to hide when the verdict is done
Vengeance tonight
You should be quiet
When blood will spill
Outrageous fight
They have decided to kill

Clad right in pinstripe; respectable men
Who's gonna stop the vendetta right now
Vengeance tonight
Machineguns ready to sacrifice
Outrageous fight
One's got to fall down
He pays the price

Showdown, time to die
You always gonna loose boy
Time to die

Under a blood-red Sicilian sky
Cruel execution Italian pride
Vengeance tonight
You should be quiet
When blood will spill
Outrageous fight
One's got to fall down
He pays the price

Showdown time to die
You always gonna loose boy
Time to die
Showdown, don't ask why
No matter what you choose boy
Time to die
