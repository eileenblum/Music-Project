Thunder is risin',
Let's break down the wall
Torture and fighting,
Just behind the door

Rape and death out there
The end of pain won't come
Gallows pole out there
Tyranny controls our world

Locked in for no crime,
So knock down the door
Shocked for a lifetime,
That's torment by law

Nations outcry let them out
Don't loose no time
Nations outcry let them out
Never say die

Cruel, no mercy
Persecution
Racial hatred
Actual facts in our time

Noble societies
Crush down the poor
We're the majority
We make'em sure
Thunder is risin',
Let's break down the wall
Torture and fighting,
Just behind the door
Locked in for no crime,
So knock down the door
Shocked for a lifetime,
That's torment by law
