Warrior, you can't survive
So far from home
In Russian nights
Rumbling gunnery far away
Break the silence
Of Russian nights

No winner nevermore
In such a senseless war
Heroes keep marching on
In Russian nights

Brothers in arms
Forlorn in the cold
In fever and pain,
Passion is gone
Neither fear nor manhood save you
You've lost your way
Now drop your gun

No winner nevermore
In such a senseless war
Heroes keep marching on
In Russian nights

Men at arms
Damned in Russia
Men at arms
Left in the dark
They join the ranks
Blinded they follow one man
Ready to kill, ready to die
A nation shouting a war cry

Men at arms
Damned in Russia
Men at arms
Left in the dark
Of Russian nights
