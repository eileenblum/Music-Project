Nights of truth, days of dread
Raven disappear
Crystal ball, gypsy's eyes
Want to find it out
Zodiac ritual
Try to show the way

Cross two bones, turn that card
Eternal mystery
Birth and death
What's in between
Gods of time and space

The secret of our destiny

Pendulum, work it out
Answer me right now
World's a mess, who can tell
How long will it last
Endless life, sudden death
Who has got the plan

Give it up tonight
The secret of eternity
Let me hear it now
The secret of our destiny

Give it up tonight
The secret of our destiny
Let me hear it now
The secret of our destiny
Come and give it up
The secret of eternity
Let us hear it now
The secret of our destiny
