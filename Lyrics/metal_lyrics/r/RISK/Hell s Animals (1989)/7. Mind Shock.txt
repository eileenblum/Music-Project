Seems that from my mind
I can't escape
It plays hide and seek with me
Voices in me say
If you were a man
You would get a stick and smash it down

Run. crash my head against blind walls
Run, crash my head against mind walls
Shock mental shock
Play on my nerves tonight
I got a shock, mental shock

I kill where I please, because
It's all mine in dark allies
I hunt the wildest beauties in town
Normally I rip up bellies

Destinies crumble, bodies run down
Where shadows suck up hungry flesh
Don't kiss me I fear disillions
I'd like my love to die

Run, crash my head against blind walls
Run, crash my head against mind walls
Shock mental shock
Play on my nerves tonight
I'm shocked, mental shock
Come on play on my nerves with me and die
