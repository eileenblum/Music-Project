Strange but the men
Who made the maze were blind
In vain we seek the way out now
They thought it all
Out many years ago
Nobody noticed the crack of doom

They ravaged mother Earth
To satisfy their greed
They forgot the future
And destroyed the seed

All those great dreams
By which we long live well
Are just illusions in the smoke of hell

What's conceivable
Should happen too
We got the power
We got the rule

Call it Insania
Tragedy reduced to numbers
Megalomania
Let the ocean freeze
Call it Insania
Stopped rotation of the Earth
Megalomania
All movements ends
