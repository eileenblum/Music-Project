Over the top of a wall - haunting
A daring palace rowers high
It's spires shoot up high, high into the sky
Millions of fires that don't want to die

How many silken virgins died - bad games
To keep a drowsy king awake
Wild orgies, festivals - endless day and night
Minions drink to you health, the master of might

Down the industrial districts - darkness
The day starts early for a slave
It's workman's destiny, downtrodden and distressed
Without mans dignity the rich remain the blessed

Wipe out
The might
We want
The revolution now
The crowd
Will fight
Together we we'll
Wipe out...

We'll join together now
A shinning on our faces
Make the road a chain of lights
Furious and armed
Turn things into monster
Let the armies clash tonight

Wipe out
The might
We want
The revolution now
The crowd
Will fight
Together we we'll
Wipe out...
