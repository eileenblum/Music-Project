Standin' in front of me
Just like a living child
I like you fair creature
A dream that I made real
Virgins silver beauty
You should worship me
The world need you artifact
Of eternity

And out of darkness
There came that hands
Perverting nature
Molding men

Dying generations
Barter love for their life
Praise the almighty god
Before you draw the knife
And now I feel the ancient pulse
The pulse of death and birth
It flows through holy hands
Last acts of a dying beast

You'll never find a hand
No place to rest your head
No tender voice
There's no mother

And out of darkness
There came that hands
Perverting nature
Molding men

I'll create your shape
Our character, too
A million times or more
DNS madness
They'll be perfect clones
Clones forever more
