Trouble all around us
To the right and to the left
Union wants to help - what a mess
Now the time is right
Raise your hands to fight
Get up and march along

Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Working hard all day
Many years of suffer went by
Come on to my side
Let us break their might
Demand what's yours, don't be shy

Strike - We're strong together
We've been on strike for something better

Social disease, crime's on the increase
It might be so tough - oh so tough
You gotta have a chance
Agree with out plans
Hit the road to show what the score is
Now the time is right
Raise your hands to fight
Get up and march along
Come on to my side
Let us break their might
Demand what's yours, don't be shy

Strike - We're strong together
We've been on strike for something better

Strike, strike, strike
Stand on your right

Most of us work hard, just for a living
But now there is mass unemployment
They shut down the mines
They cut off the lines
And wonder 'bout hate they create

They can't take our pride
They can't take our hate
Our patience is just running out
The young and the old
Will stand in the cold
If we don't stand up for our rights

Strike - We're strong together
We've been on strike for something better

Strike, strike, strike
Stand on your right
