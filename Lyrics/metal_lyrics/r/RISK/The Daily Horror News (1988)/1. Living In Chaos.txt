Anarchy
Ecstasy
Headache
Pierce me
Sidelong flowing stripes
Dazzling my eyes
Weary but I keep awake
Hack on the keys to find the way

What is behind
Password control
Data about
Atomic Assault
Target is near
Fear

Chaos, chaos
Living in chaos
Living under a spell
Now I got it - chaos, chaos
H-E-L-L
Now I do it - chaos, chaos
Log on password is hell

Chaos, Chaos
Living in chaos
Living under a spell
Now I got it - chaos, chaos
H-E-L-L

Started the countdown
Screen turns red
Can I stop the missiles or not
I hear a voice
No choice
