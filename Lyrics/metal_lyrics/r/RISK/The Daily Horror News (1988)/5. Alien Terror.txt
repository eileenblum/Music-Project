White glaring light
Doesn't need invitation
Starship in sight
Giant alien invasion

Its got no arms
No legs, its a thrill
Its got the worst intention
It's here to kill

Acid gun - ready to spit
A stamp and a rock instead of a walk
Alien terror
The world is in horror
We are the victims not willing to die

We are defenseless
Against a nature
Of vicious might

Our state is hopeless
A burning torture
Lights in the night
Rotten slime
Toxic
Scare
White blood
Attack
Roar

End up thinking
White hope is sinking
Take your last chance
Brake it's bad plans
