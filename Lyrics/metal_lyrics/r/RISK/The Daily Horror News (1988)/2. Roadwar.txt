Turn the ignition key last chance to pray
Speed up you fast battle car
No place for Sunday drivers, blast them away
Today we are all at war
Those that walk are game we'll chase
No speed limit at all
Two big rigs at a breakneck pace
Explode into fireballs

Fast attack
Laser check
Set the gun
Squeeze the trigger

The right of way goes to the dangerous guns
Skid overturn - the highway warriors dance

Roadwar - roadwar - roadwar - roadwar

Smile as the next victim comes into range
Cold-blooded black up the street
Look at this idiot driver in front
Let's vaporize him and scream
Hell-bent cycle gangs - duels to death
Turn them into white-hot heaps
Vent your frustrations by fighting and shout
On roads a road hog is free

Fast attack
Laser check
Set the gun
Squeeze the trigger

The right of way goes to the dangerous guns
Skid overturn - the highway warriors dance

Roadwar - roadwar - roadwar - roadwar
