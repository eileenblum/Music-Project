U.S.A. in trouble - had a rocket crash
Men and women died in hell
Everybody saw that on the TV screen
The shuttle rockets and explodes

In this world today some crazy men
Racin' cars an flyin' high
Stearin' bullets that were heaven sent
We all see their suicide

They need it, we want it all day
I need it, more than I can say

Check it out now
Speed kills, speed kills
All the untamed
Speed kills

Not for a cheap rate
Speed kills - speed kills
That's that proof mate
Speed kills

Supersonic beats out of stereo
For me on the verge of madness
Doesn't matter if it's fun or if it kills
Everybody wants to have a thrill

They need it, we want it all day
I need it, more than I can say

Check it out now
Speed kills, speed kills
All the untamed
Speed kills

Not for a cheap rate
Speed kills, speed kills
That's the proof mate
Speed kills
