[a) INVITATION]

...are you man or fool enough, to descend
into the sewerage? To pick your way through
damp narrow passages, where the walls are
covered in patches of green slime?
Millions of rats live in the world of musty
decadence, where the prince of drunkards is
waiting for you. Th disgusting stench of
fouling sewage will guide us through this
maze of darkness to the realm of the dull
knight!

Cheer up!

...and follow me down!

Welcome the the kingdom of rats!!!

[b) RATMAN'S DELIGHT]

Yeah, I'm the big star of the drain
Ain't nobody else
Mr.Daniels fucked me up
I just don't care, because I am the reign
I might be drunk but I say this again

[Bridge:]
I'm the Ratman
Madman
Everybody knows
Don't forget man
He's a fool man
Never come too close

I'm a cool man, dirty rat
Steady on the ball
Stoned again, I raped a cat
Spit upon 'em all

[Bridge:]
Stop, Shut up
No I don't
You show off
I don't care

[Chorus:]
Ratman... Ratman

Plans to kill me end in vain
Unless you send a flood
I'm always dealin' cheap rats bane
Because I know the cut
Put on my cape, creepin' subways at night
Lookout for something to junk and bite

[Bridge:]
Stop, be quiet
What do you want
You! Beware
I don't care
Stop, you cheat
I will get you some day
You can't win
Don't forget, I'm the king

[Chorus:]
Ratman... Ratman

[c) RATDANCE]

...and now ratgirls and ratboys
I'll show you a very exciting new dance
Come a little closer!
And don't step on your tails
You'll need 'em yet

Now, shake your body, gimme your money
Hiss and squeak, stamp your feet to the beat
Circle 'round, drop to ground, toss about
Show your nails, raise your tails
Crack your tip, like a whip

Ratdance... dance the Ratdance

Alright... not bad
But here is some more

Ratdance... dance the Ratdance

[d) DELIRIUM]

Takin' shelter
Just around the block
Waitin' for my time is coming up
Tossin' tournin'
Don't know what to do
Delirious, unable to die

[Bridge:]
I'm the Ratman
Madman
Everybody knows
Don't forget man
He's a fool man
Never come to close

Stop! Be quiet
What do you what?
You! Beware
I don't care
Stop, you cheat
I will get you someday
You can't win
Don't forget I'm the king

[Chorus:]
Ratman... Ratman
