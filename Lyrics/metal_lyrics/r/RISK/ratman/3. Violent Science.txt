Over fields of molten rocks
The sun is going blind
Mental silence, poison dust
The air is small and dry

This is the wasteland
The kingdom of rats
This is the deadland
Where sorrow for sorrow will cry

Ratscoat and crowskin
Shapes without form
Paralyzed faces
Their features are torn

There are no eyes here
There are no ears
Only their brain
Make 'em see, make 'em hear

Helpin' each other
They going astray
And then an odd inner voice
Start its say

Why, why
Violent science

Guilty - you create the bomb
You godforsaken fool
Crave for agony
Survival is your doom

Why, why
Violent science
