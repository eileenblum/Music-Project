When the day is done
I'm walking down the docks
Side by side with old companions
We sit down to watch the sunset
Over dirty rocks
We're sons of the ancient hunters
We are born for

Hunting game
Endless pain
There I want to stay

No more fish in the stream
The American Dream
Has destroyed the land of Indians
White man's money's ruling again
But we stand up to them
Talkin', smokin'
Visions will lead us the way
Goin' to

Mountains high
Eagles fly
There I want to die

I will rise and fall
Bury my heart
At Wounded Knee

They have slain my father's body
But his spirit is still alive
He rides across a sacred country
In freedom and eternal life
I will join him at his fire
Some day
It's my favorite desire
To hear the tale when he said

I will rise and fall
Bury my heart
At Wounded Knee
