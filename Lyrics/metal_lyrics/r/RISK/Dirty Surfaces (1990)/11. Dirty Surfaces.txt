You know that you have got
Whatever you want
But now all is worn-out
Wherever you go decays
And you can feel
The surgeon whets the steel

And now you want to break the hourglass
You can't hold the time of innocence
The sands are running out

Dirty surfaces
Lost paradise
Dirty surfaces
No way out

Black rain ashes and flames
Are heaven's tears
Go on with senseless pride
And digital mind
The world is a broker's gain
But nature cries sold out!

And now you want to break the hourglass
You can't hold the time of innocence
The sands are running out

Dirty surfaces
Lost paradise
Dirty surfaces
No way out

You know that you have got
Whatever you want
But now

You don't know what is knowledge or ignorance
You're convinced of freedom you don't have
Damned to live on

Dirty surfaces
Lost paradise
Dirty surfaces
No way out
