The maze of self is a prison
A senseless hunt for the past
The vultures took the decision
This treacherous kits of a needle
Will be the last

A look at a distorting mirror
I don't know where I have gone
It reflected a picture of horror
Transmutation had begun

You'll die every night
Lost in pain
Nine times crucified
Let me down

Iron wheels are crying loud
Leading down a stair
Every more, my mind climbs down
To find, below, despair

A horrid beautiful maiden
Ready to suck my blood
She wants an intoxication
Smiles and tears out my heart

You'll die every night
Lost in pain
Nine times crucified
Let me down

Iron wheels are crying loud
Leading down a stair
Every more, my mind climbs down
To find, below, despair

You'll die every night
Lost in pain
Nine times crucified
Let me down

Iron wheels are crying loud
Leading down a stair
Every more, my mind climbs down
To find, below, despair
