Dear who's listening to
I write these lines to send to you
Ain't no fairytale
From purgatory comes a mail
Dear unbeliever
I testify to you receiver
No more horizon
Where silver waters flow
And winds of velvet blow

Dear wasted years
Journey's at an end
Destination: Judgement Day
To where I went and cast away
No I haven't met
Though I wish I had
Long forgotten heroes
Of a faded unique century
I'm a hellbound soldier
Letter from beyond

Here I do confess
I went to far to certain death
Ain't no guarantee
I pay to you don't follow me
Shine, shine your light on
Blazing fire, violet haze
No more horizon
Where silver waters flow
And winds of velvet blow

Dear wasted days
Always on my mind
Absolution on its way
Promised but not yet replied
I'm a hellbound soldier
Letter from beyond

Kingdom come
Without return
Why me of all
All this is

Far beyond imagination
Much too far to see
Father it is your creation
Much too hard to be
Far out but got one illusion
This is what I want
Father read this testimony
Letter from beyond

Dear who's left behind
Nothing good out here to find
I broke a chain
Bound around a life in pain
Dear who's next to come
Await a cosmic vacuum, with
No more horizon
Right behind the border

Kingdom come
Without return
Why me of all
All this is

Far beyond imagination
Much too far to see
Father it is your creation
Much too hard to be
Far out but got one illusion
This is what I want
Father read this testimony
Letter from beyond
