Blood is red in everyone
Blood is red in you and me
Blood is red in all of us
Blood is red

He's black
She's red
They're white
And bad
Can you understand the meaning
These simple praying words
That we have to stop the bleeding
And accept as well the fact

Blood is red in everyone
Blood is red in you and me
Blood is red in all of us
Blood is red

And when the night comes
At the point of the sword
And the blood runs
In the name of the lord
And the heat's on
When the Klan is marching on

White hate
The black
And red
To death

And when the Klan comes
With the flaming cross
And the blood run
To the gallows pole
And the house burns
With their rage and guns
They gonna make'em run
Till the deal is done

Blackman
Sioux Tribe
And Jew
That's true
And the white man's still believing
That his veins are full of gold
And I often tried conceiving
Am I part of this injustice

Blood is red in everyone
Blood is red in you and me
Blood is red in all of us
Blood is red
