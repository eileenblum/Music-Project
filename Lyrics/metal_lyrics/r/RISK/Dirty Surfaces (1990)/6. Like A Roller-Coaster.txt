Late at night, guess what I do
Changin' place up to mainstreet, cause
When you will come to the alleyways
You gotta feel it
Check out the guy in his limousine
What is he good for tonight

Like a roller coaster
Gets me high and low
Like a highball shooter
Needs a nightlife show

Showin' off gutter lady, look
Some gotta hold up a liquor shop
Somebody's dying by crack

Suck it to me
Dirty bad town, your loudness
Suck it to me
Paranoid city, grandiose fair
Give it to me
Dirty bad town, your loudness
Give it to me
Red light city, dressed to kill

Suck it to me
Dirty bad town, your loudness
Suck it to me
Paranoid city, grandiose fair
Give it to me
Dirty bad town, your loudness
Give it to me
Red light city, dressed to kill

High heeled shoes, love for money
Cheap perfume keep its promise well
When you will come to the alleyways
You gotta see it
Heading for extremes, variety
Live it up downtown tonight

I don't tell no tale
I write it on the mirror
My advice for your eyes
Don't buy no ticket
You can get it if you want it
Just for free, come with me

Like a roller coaster
It's a prime time show
Like a giant wheel's turning
Get its high and low

Suck it to me
Dirty bad town, your loudness
Suck it to me
Paranoid city, grandiose fair
Give it to me
Dirty bad town, your loudness
Give it to me
Red light city, dressed to kill
