Eyes that never learned to cry
Eyes that never smiled
Child you never saw the light
But saw when people died

Berlin burned in nineteen forty four
After combat flight attack
World-war left so many starving kids
Childhood's gone and won't come back

Warchild
When will you laugh again
Warchild
Your world destroyed by men Warchild

Violent fights in Palestinian streets
Where children left there innocence
Born into a cruel and grown up world
Stones and rocks in tiny hands because
They have killed their brothers
They have killed their friends
One victim after another
No mercy, just revenge
Time this time
Somewhere an orphan is born
And I ask why
But I can't find an answer

Warchild
When will you laugh again
Warchild
Your world destroyed by men Warchild

They have killed a father
They have killed his wife
Their son keeps on defending
Tries hard to stay alive
Time this time
Another orphan is born
And I ask why
But I can't find an answer

Warchild
When will you laugh again
Warchild
Your world destroyed by men Warchild
