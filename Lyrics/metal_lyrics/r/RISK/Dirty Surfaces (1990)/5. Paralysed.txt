Days of sorrow and unspoken pain
No tomorrow I will die in chains
Hollow sighs descend whispering down
Ghostly eyes fixing the iron lung
Soon I'll be gone

On the bike, just you and me
And immortality
Leather jackets and tattoos
Born to Booze
No grief, no mercy, breath and bite
Unchained energy
Riding hard, fast and wild
We're the youth

I pick up speed, the cycle rears
It is the final fight
Metal bursts, machine explodes
My last cry
Through the dark, the ambulance
Pulsing out red light
Like blood out shredded arteries
Shall I die

Don't gaze at me
Set me free
And agree
To gods decree

No voice to crave
Please let me die
No hands to stroke
I'm paralysed

Doctor knows I can't survive
And doesn't let me go
Save me from a robot life
And break the law
Switch off the machinery
And don't call the nurse
I'll wake up among mysteries
Death or birth

Don't gaze at me
Set me free
And agree
To gods decree

No voice to crave
Please let me die
No hands to stroke
I'm paralysed
