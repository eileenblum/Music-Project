Who's not afraid
When it's time for a raid
And who keeps the city burning
I am the star
Of the Fantastic Four
In my own imagination
I entertain
All the bored and insane
And I fight their desolation
Day after day
Acting on open stage
For a real mad generation

I'm possessed by fire
Napalm in my veins
All my hearts desire
The world bursting to flames

I'm a rebel
Fire devil
No one's madder than I am
All I want is
Right and justice
I'm the Pyromaniac Man

Why don't you go
To my dynamite show
When I blow up a Cadillac's beauty
You must take heart
When I wanna start
The time fuse of an incendiary
Now you will see
How a little TNT
Beautifies a service station
What a big feat
When it bursts from the heat
With the sound of ruination

I'm possessed by fire
Napalm in my veins
All my hearts desire
The world bursting to flames

I'm a rebel
Fire devil
No one's madder than I am
All I want is
Right and justice
I'm the Pyromaniac Man

Panic in the city
And I show no pity
When I thaw a frozen nation
Flames so high
Like a burning sky
It's ,y new sunset creation

I'm possessed by fire
Napalm in my veins
All my hearts desire
The world bursting to flames

I'm a rebel
Fire devil
No one's madder than I am
All I want is
Right and justice
I'm the Pyromaniac Man
