Your brain is firmly cemented
All your veins are clogged with gore
All pictures engraved in your eyes, are
Just copies of a table of laws

As if you had never seen the sun
As if you've got no living heart, it seems
Without pleasure and without pain
You can't break up the gloom of your dreams

Don't believe in
Canting words
All you need is
Madman's verve

Turn back to ecstasy
Graceless and wild
Lord of insanity
Be by our side

Sick with desire, you are on the payroll
Half-dead and half-alive
You know wealth by eyeing in the keyhole
But the door will not open without a fight

Don't believe
In canting words
All you need is
Madman's verve

Turn back to ecstasy
Graceless and wild
Lord of insanity
Be by our side
Turn back to ecstasy
Go to extremes
Lord of insanity
Wake up the seed

I'm the guardian of the gate of the shades
The bolt is sliding out, it's groove
The lot that decides your fate
Will be cast tomorrow just for you

Don't believe
In canting words
All you need is
Madman's verve

Turn back to ecstasy
Graceless and wild
Lord of insanity
Be by our side
Turn back to ecstasy
Go to extremes
Lord of insanity
Wake up the seed
