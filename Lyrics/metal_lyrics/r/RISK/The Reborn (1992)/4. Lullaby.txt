Down by the hillside
They all came around
A strange kind of gathering
On holy ground

Demons and wizards
In the haze of the dawn
And angels flew over
To see the reborn
See the reborn

They all sing a lullaby
Hale in the cradle
And they hope it will never die
Spawn of the evil

They all sing a lullaby
Hale in the cradle
And they hope it will never die
Spawn of the evil

Asleep in the cradle
Still is the night
Fragile and innocent
Like china white

They called into being
A wild burning flame
Malice or hatred
Should be its name
Remember his name

They all sing a lullaby
Hale in the cradle
And they hope it will never die
Spawn of the evil

They all sing a lullaby
Hale in the cradle
And they hope it will never die
Spawn of the evil

They all sing a lullaby
Hale in the cradle
And they hope it will never die
Spawn of the evil
