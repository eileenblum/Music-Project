I see demonic armies
They fight the world to wipe it out
No swamp of blood the Good reveals
Can't stop their thundering chariot wheels

Justice and conscience
Fall to the sword
Rising generations
Follow and laud
The devilish foe

He's called Ravana, he was a king
Defeated by one mortal man
He rose from the burning guts of the Earth
Ready to be crowned again

Last warning
Warning, Warning
Ravana's return
Last warning
Warning, Warning
The world's gonna burn

The age of Kaliyuga
Tore up the flags of love and peace
The reckless way of modern life
Turned fear to panic and friendship to strife

Violent upheavals
Bloodshed and war
The master of evil
Open his jaws
The world in his claws

After one hundred years of a draught
The sky will create seven suns
When fire and storm have withered the Earth
Annihilation is done

Last warning
Warning, Warning
Ravana's return
Last warning
Warning, Warning
The world's gonna burn

Last warning
Warning, Warning
Ravana's return
Last warning
Warning, Warning
The world's gonna burn

And the spirit of the universe
Falls into stony sleep
And he's floating on the Ocean of Eternity
To reach his rebirth...

[choir]

Beyond the crest of the world
Two piercing eyes are gazing at you
Realms fall apart and anarchy
Grows up to civil war and misery

Ravenous nations
Live in luxury
But all their ovations
Just echoes of a threnody
A dirge in his ears

He's called Ravana, he was a king
Defeated by one mortal man
He rose from the burning guts of the Earth
Ready to be crowned again

Last warning
Warning, Warning
Ravana's return
Last warning
Warning, Warning
The world's gonna burn

Last warning
Warning, Warning
Ravana's return
Last warning
Warning, Warning
The world's gonna burn

Last warning
Warning, Warning
Last warning
Warning, Warning

No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more...
