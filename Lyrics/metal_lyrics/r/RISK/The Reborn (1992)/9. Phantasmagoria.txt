Shut in the darkness, I could hear a secret voice
It's one step further into paradise

But in the perfect circle
Of its woven wheel
A spider's waiting just for me
A demon in disguise

Phantasmagoria
Phantasmagoria

In blasted pain, I want my visions to arise
To dream once more I close my eyes

I sink into oblivion
Behind a wall of haze
I find myself there face to face
With a demon in disguise

Phantasmagoria
Phantasmagoria
Deep in euphoria
Phantasmagoria

Phantasmagoria
Phantasmagoria
Deep in euphoria
Phantasmagoria

Phantasmagoria
