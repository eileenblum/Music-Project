A blameless merchant wants a demon lover, anywhere
To feel his strange heart beating - what it broke?
Merciless generations, leaving chaos everywhere
The darkness comes again, and now I know!

The end is coming, I know the night, the night will fall
I see the black waste of the sky (the night will fall)
I feel the silence when all dies (the night will fall)

They haven't got the peace that a search in meditation finds
He doesn't cry out on the torture throne
Shadows appear today, possession of their anguished minds
When their souls are burned, ah, then I know

The end is coming, I know the night, the night will fall
I see the black waste of the sky (the night will fall)
I feel the silence when all dies (the night will fall)

Man all will be blinded, all resistance useless
There are no ways to peace, peace is the way
When the serpent rises over mountains and the sea
Spitting out its poison everyday

The end is coming, I know the night, the night will fall
I see the black waste of the sky (the night will fall)
I feel the silence when all dies (the night will fall)
