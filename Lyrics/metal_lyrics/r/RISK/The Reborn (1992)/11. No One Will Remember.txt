Once there was light and shade
Once there was time and space
I hear the echoes in the wind
I see the frozen lands
I tell forgotten tales
And listen to a violin

Who will remember
Love and hate
Faith and sin
Into a neverending night
Everlasting
Blackout the colour and it shows

Now its all gone and over
Without return
There is no now or never
Nothing will remain

No one will remember
Who left without a trace
The living to surrender
A lost and faded race
No one will remember
Man of flesh and blood
Everything did end up
When it came to the flood

Once there was life and fate
Once there were thoughts and pain
Where have the memories all gone?
Into a frozen past
On a timeless ocean
There is no light, there?s no sun

Now its all gone and over
Without return
There is no now or never
Nothing will remain

No one will remember
Who left without a trace
The living to surrender
A lost and faded race

No one will remember
Man of flesh and blood
Everything did end up
When it came to the flood
No one will remember
The living to surrender
