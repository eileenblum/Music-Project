Morbidity and evil
Misery and pain
Humankind will fade forever
Ravana calls

So let me tell you something
No soul's forever more
This world that you are living in
Is rotten to the core

...Be no more

Ridiculous creation
Cursed to be no more
Days in black will last forever
Your back's to the wall

The morrow and the future
Is locked behind a door
Your tainted mortal coil is
Rotten to the core

...Be no more
Be no more
Be no more
Be no more

Dirty nasty creature
No longer worth of being
All your brains are on the moulder
This is the fall

Thunder and lightning
Just like the prophecy
A better world to live in
Will never ever be

I'm not your guardian angel
Don't you know by now
Yes, I'm the horned and evil one
Rotten to the core

...Be no more
Be no more
Be no more
Be no more

No more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more...
