Time has come you can't refuse
Fight back, don't go running
Soldier of the Universe
Face up to the coming

Blasting thunder rises in the sky
And the last sun's got its evil eye

Armageddon, fight back
Armageddon, fight back

Final battle, last of all
In the fields of heaven, oh no, no
Shoot that arrow, cleave the sun
At last number seven

Sun-God fighter got his eye on you
And the glory to whom the glory's due

Armageddon, fight back
Armageddon, fight back

Armageddon, fight back
Armageddon, fight back

Armageddon, a galaxy's affair
Titans clashing, the challenge of the heir

Armageddon, fight back
Armageddon, fight back

Armageddon, fight back
Armageddon, fight back
