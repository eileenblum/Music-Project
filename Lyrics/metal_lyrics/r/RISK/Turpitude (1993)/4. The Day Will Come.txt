The air we breathe, the ground we take
And the mighty waters
The deal is done, but not yet signed
The life we live in rain or shine
Our sons and daughters
The trade is sealed but not yet payed

Ain't no silver lining
High on skies of red
The final gleam of hope
Buried on the fields of dread

A fall into a void, an emptiness
A darkened hole
All this is waiting, the planet has closed it's account

The day will come to pay the price
And we'll fade away
Should the sun refuse to shine

The time we share the stars to see
And the moon above
We are supposed to hold the key

Ain't no use in crying
Past the midnight hour
The final gleam of hope
Buried on the fields of dread

The day we have to sacrifice
In a certain way
Now we have got to give a sign
