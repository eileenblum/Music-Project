Warfare just right behind us
Nightmare in the neighbourhood
Are we quite unaffected?
Are we too blind to see

World is just a single tumor
And it grows, yes it grows
War! All got to shout it
But we're too deaf to hear

Guilty but not to blame for
Fighting in dead-end streets
Bloodshed on coloured T.V.'s
And we keep our seats
Shifting back to the middle-ages
More and more a dirty war
No! We should not take this
But we still ignore

We just don't care and we don't mind
We must be deaf and must be blind

Hellfire, it's getting closer
Roaring, we can't deny
The danger! But we still live in
Innocence and lies

World is just a single tumor
And it grows, yes it grows
No! We should not take this
Should not let it go

But we don't care and we don't mind
'cause we are deaf and we are blind
