See their eyes, see their lying eyes
Face to face, beware lest you believe

Hear them talk, hear those liars talk
Foolin' you, beware lest you believe

Back in the sixties they're killed JFK
Keeping the whole world in lies still today

Dead secret mission, they call it SDI
Don't ask no question
Don't even ask 'em why

Lies, takes and stories
No more excuses, we say

No not true
We all get deceived
No not true
So don't you believe
No not true

You've called him a friend but he had the nerve
Lies only lies, so he did not deserve

Accused politician, he took all we gave
But even the judge...corrupted and depraved
Lies, tales and stories
