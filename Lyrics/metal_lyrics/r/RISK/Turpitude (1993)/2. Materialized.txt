The thorus of reality
Sting your poisoned heart
Your desperate naked life
It's here but you just can't get it
In weird dreams, in truth indeed
Have you heard of...fear

Physically it takes you and never disappears
Strange and invisible
It's near, keeps you from moving
A silhouette...a shade of 

Fear - It's a personated instrument
Usurper on your mind
And came before your instincts are

Materialized
A vision too real
Materialize
Just right now

Emotions are intangible
Thoughts can get abused
You're frightened and abandoned
But it's here and you just can get it
An intruder?...an illusion

Fear - It's a personated instrument
Inside your shapeless mind
Appeared before your instincts are

Materialized
A vision too real
Materialize
Just right now
