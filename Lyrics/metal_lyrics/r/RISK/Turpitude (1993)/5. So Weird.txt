Just take a look around
Tell me what you see
The situation's running out
Out of our hands
I know you can't deny
The truth in what I say
The burning flames get much too high
It blows us away

And they believe in god
And set the world on fire
Sometimes it makes me laugh
Though I could only cry

It's weird - strange entirely crazy
So weird
It's weird - mad and totally dizzy
So weird

I'm not your man

If you could count to ten
Tell me what you'd find out
We all will be too much far too
Less skies and ground

Those who believe in god
Stop your fakes and prayers
Sometimes it seems to me
The madhouse forever stays

It's weird
