Sisters and brothers turn into enemies
They kill each other, their hate is merciless

They shoot down children, they even kill the aged
It terrifies me
No chance to turn the page

The turpitude of man is running high
And everything that moves is bound to die
Calling the order

Show no mercy, no quarter
Show no mercy

Ain't no mercy, mean slaughter
Show no mercy

A war releases a bloodstained destiny
Shells blow to pieces their homes and dignity

Once everybody walked on side by side
Now everything has got to run and hide
Call out the order

Show no mercy
