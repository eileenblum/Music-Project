All at once, all alone
Walls of ice, walls of stone

All around it's cold and bare
Deep inside, deeply scared

Violently dead wounded soul
Desperate and out of control
And I... CRY

Burning flames from blinded eyes
Brain in daze and frozen guise

Chained up mind dying of fear
Deadness 'round, so nobody hears
When I... CRY
