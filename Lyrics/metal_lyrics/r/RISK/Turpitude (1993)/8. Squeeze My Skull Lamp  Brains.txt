I don't know what to do and I don't understand
I'm awful disconnected, try to comprehend

No I don't like myself, the way I feel inside
All day just self-delusion, unable to decide
I'm shattered so confused
I wanna scream and shout
What's wrong, what's right, what's good or bad
Strictly down and out

All functions out of order
Senses running wild
An inner war, I started crying like a child
Overloaded and pressure rose up high
And made me feel like it squeezed my skull and...
Squeezed my skull and brains

My soul's a battlefield, conscience lost the fight
My head, my heart, my flesh and blood
Seemed to run and hide

All functions in a mess
Senses didn't lie
The inner war was lost as hard as I have tried
Overloaded and pressure rose up high
Felt like something squeezed my skull and...
Squeezed my skull and brains

Don't know what to do 'cause I don't understand
What's wrong, what's right, who's black or white
Need a helpin' hand...
