Weightless driftin' on a nameless tide
Wandering without any aim
Passing gates that promise hope and light
And takes me back to where I came

This trip got no direction
No way I'd find
Is this the point of no return

Lost and never found
I'm lost and never found
The exit of a hopeless ground

Moving on the winds without a trace
Falling an unending fall
Stranded on the shore of time and space
But still I'm lost beyond recall

Destination nowhere
It takes me to
Is this the point of no return

Lost and never found
