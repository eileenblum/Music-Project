It's silent and the ocean can tell
As no wind blows over it's surface
Something strange and rare is happening
Such silentness has never been felt
It's like the time stands still
And never have such earthly life forms
Felt such fear and thought so much
It's like the last thought of human race

And seconds after the nature
Gives it's sign of life and existance
But for the humans a certain death
The earth's surface quivers
And the water begins to stir
Winds of a strength which no man
Has ever believed existed
Waves high flows towards land
Thunder rumbles in the sky
While lightning strikes all over
From the centre of earth
Do enormous chinks open
And what's left of the human world
Falls down into the depths of darkness
While mountains high melts
And cover the last evidence of this age's flowers

After this everything is quiet
Only the cool breeze is left
To blow away the smoke
From the wasted landscapes
Everything of this age is buried
And becomes a secret that will never be known
It was malice and the only solution
