It's war - crushed in the sacred door
It's war - demons enter the holy hall
It's war - and angels from heaven fall
It's war - victory for the subterra lord

Flames... sky is red... it's been said

It's war in heaven, the temple is on fire
Red raindrops fall and there is claps of thunder
Like battle drums rumbling for the demonic lord
Angels.. with their harps crumpled around their necks
Use the last words to sing a song, like that would help
You are already dead!

The wind on earth getting stronger
As a new angel scream
And beg for mercy to a king that's already dead
Words from books of holy origin has no longer any power

Empty prayings and a request to a god that has escaped
Abandoned and frightened he hides somewhere beyond
He has left you all behind
The black flag sways on the top of the world
As the riders of doom rides up the heavenstairs
And find the path through the angel dust
To find and crush the sacred life source well
