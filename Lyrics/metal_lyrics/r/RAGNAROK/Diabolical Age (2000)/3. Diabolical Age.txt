An eternal darkness has come to us
All light on earth has ended
The new age has come... this is our diabolical age

An invocation to Antichrist, we hail!
Thou let us fall upon thee
And thou made us be as one
Times of hate, war and pain is now here
We have built something strong together...
Our diabolical age has come to be!

In a castle so deep we stand so proud and strong
We raise our blackhearted souls and greet
This everlasting and eternal age of darkness
This is our diabolical age

Face us, come into our souls
Feel the blackhearted darkness
Feel the hate, feel the masters of the diabolical age
Worship us, worship our new age

See the hate, see the pain
See our mighty and dark rivers
Where sacrificing blood flows in streams
We sacrifice for our new age
We sacrifice all we want and all we need
Do what thou wilt now

Oh, so darkly and proud
Oh, so black and hateful
Oh, so mighty and strong
Oh, how we hail thee
Hail the diabolical age.. Hail!
