Misery!
My flame is burning! It's burning higher
Look into my demon eyes. Watch me arise.
I'm a demon with thousand faces
Faces so cold as ice!

I am the face of madness and pleasure
I am the face of death and terror
"Say my name"... and you will die
mortal souls I take
makes me immortal.

Tragedies!
My flame is burning; it's burning higher.
Look into my demon eyes. Watch me arise
I'm a demon with thousand faces.
Faces so cold as ice.

I am the face of madness and pleasure
I am the face of death and terror.

You will be captured inside of me.
Living rest of your life in sodomy.
I bring your mind, your soul, your flesh and blood
Down into darkness.
...and take you in to a eternal maze

A demonic ablaze are streaming through your veins.
I seduce you into the night as I draw your soul
Into tragedies.
