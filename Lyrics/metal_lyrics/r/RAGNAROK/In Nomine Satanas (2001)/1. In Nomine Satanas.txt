I was born in the shadows of darkness
I was born in a blackened chasm
I was born by an angel
:the angel of hell!!
Am I the son of Satan
Am I the source of evil
Am I the only one with horns?
Am I the lord of chaos?
IF I seek will I find my strength
Oh, Satan take me where I can find my will
I turn the cross towards hell
Give me thy benediction to destroy all holy
In your name...

Infernus spiritus Tiamat
In nomine Satanas
Nocternus spiritus marduk
Dominus spiritus Satan

Ego vos benedictio in nomine
Magni dei nostri satanas ave
Satanas domini inferni

I spread my wings and fly into the night again
And create confusion and chaos for my unholy immolation
In nomine dei nostri satanas
I raise my horns into the night again
Take my hand and fly with me into the flaming hell

Can you feel his pride upon us
Can you feel his strength are growing
Rapture!!!
