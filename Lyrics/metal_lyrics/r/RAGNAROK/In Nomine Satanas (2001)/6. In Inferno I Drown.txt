Visions, that I never have seen before
Illusions, that I never have illustrated before.
Anger, that I never have felt before.
A night; that I never have touched before!
Something strong is growing deep inside of me
So dark and mighty, that it takes my breath away,
But still you're my ecstasy.

MY SOUL IS DEAD!

The demon within me...
The nocturnal beast...
The slayer of a thousand souls, 
Born in me.

Language, I have never spoken before
Through my eyes, a world that I never have seen before
The demon within me...
The nocturnal beast...
The slayer of a thousand souls, born in me
Hellfire succumbs me.

IN HELL I BURN!

Hellfire succumbs me. In hell I burn
Morbid demented. Ultimate mutilation
Incarnate... Arnageddon!

MY SOUL IS DEAD!
