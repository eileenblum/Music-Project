Something has died
So cold and breathless she lies.
The soil is covered by frost and the clouds are gathering
Above this beautiful corpse.

Night falls like leaves from a fallen wing of an angel.
Her eyes is pale like her face
And her soul has frozen to ice,
Like a light from a candle
Are dying from a storm at night.

The bane of life seems so sudden meaningless...
From every corner of her soul, she cries.
Still wonder how life would be, this life she'll never see.

The bane of life seems so sudden meaningless...

The soil is covered by frost 
and the clouds are gathering
Above this beautiful corpse.
From every corner of her soul, she cries.
Still wonder how life would be, 
this life she'll never see...

Capture in this beautiful silence.
Dead and forgotten.
Her beauty rest's in darkness...
