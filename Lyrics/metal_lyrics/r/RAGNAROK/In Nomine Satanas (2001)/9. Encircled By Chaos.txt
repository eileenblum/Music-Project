Rapture!
Death lord... Iak Sakkath!
Embrace me, as you command your black winged horde.
Bow down before the master!
Raise your horn in blasphemy
i am demonized

Scorn the throne of blessing, and make them cry for their salvation.
Raise your horn in blasphemy
I am demonized.
Bestial torment, vomit upon their cross and burn their book of lies.

Antichrist... rise and destroy the temple of dementia

Rapture!
Death lord... Iak Sakkath!
Embrace me, as you command your black winged horde.
Bow down before the master!
Raise your horn in blasphemy
A am Satanized!

The sky above me turns red like flames from hell
Raise your horns in blasphemy
I am Satanized!

Morbid Angel, rape the mother and child of holiness
Kill the son of god, and Jesus Christ dies
I am encircled by chaos!

After thousand of years... upon this chaos,
A child was born.
Born by madness.
Born by darkness
Born by blizzards
Born by flames,
Born Satanized!!!
