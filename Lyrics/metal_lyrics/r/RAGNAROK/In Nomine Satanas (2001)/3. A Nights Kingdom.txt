Wicked eyes, see how she so beautiful dies
Storm full skies takes her
Into the chaotic underworld.
See her eyes behind the shadow
In the thunderously silence.
See her grim and majestic violence

To fill her luscious fears,
To give us thy precious tears.
Give thy self to the mysteries of your night
Now... come inside!
There is no where to despair,
Victory is now here...

A blazed by the mist of terror,
She subsides into the great horror.
Accrue! And touch the black flame
Leather! For thy kingdoms underworld
Has once again opened.
Chaos is all
Chaos is never ending
Oh, lustful whore,
You are mine forever more...
