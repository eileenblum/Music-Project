Lord, take me as your weapon to do all evil
I will bring hatred where love was meant to be
Let injustice be spoken over forgiveness
Bring dissension where agreement used to be

So doubt in those who believe
And fear their hypocrisy

Darkness will conquer the light
Let happiness be overshadowed by pain and sorrow

I will let delusion rule instead of truth
Oh master,
Let me seek and find
The ultimate chaos
