Satan lord of the south!
Lucifer lord of the east!
Leviathan lord of the west!
Belial lord of the north!

Open the gate, Satan!
Open the gate, Lucifer!
Open the gate, Leviathan!
Open the gate, Belial!

Master...
I call upon thee, and take my soul to
The eternal darkness
Carry me through the darkest kingdom,
Through your infernal flames,
Into your realms of hell!

By Satan give me strength!
By Lucifer give me fire!
By Leviathan give me pride!
By Belial give me power to rule in darkness!

Hail me!
I am the one!
By malediction I have become, thy son
The son of darkness
I am invincible!

Open the gate, master Satan!
Open the gate, master!

Carry me through the darkest kingdom,
Through your infernal flames,
Into your realms of hell!

Hail me! I'm the one!
By malediction I have become, thy son
The son of darkness. I am invincible!
Watch my strength grow, as I get crown as Prince of darkness
Drink my blood, and become one of me.
MASTER, HAIL ME!!
