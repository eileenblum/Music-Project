Hark my son these words.
Cattle die and brothers die,
one day we'll die ourselves,
but this song of praise will never die
of he who has glory gained.
So fear not the coming twilight
when giants and gods collide,
for when once more the steel shines in our hands
then truly we are heroes beneath the heavens.

It's a fine day to die...
