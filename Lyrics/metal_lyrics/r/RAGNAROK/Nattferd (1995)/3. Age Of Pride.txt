In the time of swords and axes
In this Eeried Ogre time
When martial men ravage on earth
When the forest was dark and sombre
And the Northern fighting spirit was alive
Time of swords and axes
Age of pride
Swords shall be raised
For the ancient view of hate
I see the beast in the eye of them
Who suffer in the present time
This glorious and pathetic age
Let us crush the sacred temple
Unholy hordes whit evil mind
From the darkest age in time
Come back and fill the world
Whit malignant powers of ancient
The age of pride
Dreadful longships sailed the sea
They plumber and spread the fear
Whit combat harried horses they ride
For the sunset
Warriors whit a hope to see their gods of war
Their gods was their hope and inspiration
