The destiny of gods
Gods and demons
The big ending battle
Fight and evilness last in three years
Skoll swallows the sun
Hate swallows the moon
Blood squirts all over the sky
An extreme cold
Fimbulwinter in three years
Loke and Fenris tear lose
Midgardsormen search towards land
It was Naglefar to land
Heimdal blows his horn the battle has began
Holy and demonic powers
Are in battle
Surt sling fire over earth
A new world shows up
It is the age of Ragnarok
A age in darkness
Hordes from the dark side
Gather to the battle of the end earth.
