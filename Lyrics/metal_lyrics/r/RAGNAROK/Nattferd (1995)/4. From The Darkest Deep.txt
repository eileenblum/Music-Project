Demons from the darkest deep
Sent by the dark shadow
In order to destroy
The light of the weak
A dark hole is opened
In the cold winterland
Opened by the dark believers
Unholy forces in the blackened dark
They will see the heart of Christ
Ripped out and sent through the hole
The hole of darkness and sorrow
From the darkest deep
Comes the confined souls
Whit their Ice-bound hearts
The weak son of mother Mary
The feeble belief of a god
The son of the holy whore
Fall down in inhuman pain
God... in spiritual death
Weakness... in the holy horde
When they who believe in him
Laying on the ground to rot
