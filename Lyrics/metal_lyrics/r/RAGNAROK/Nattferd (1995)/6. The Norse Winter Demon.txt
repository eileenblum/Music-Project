In the north castle
Upon the high mountain
Hidden by the Old Norse wood
High above the northsea
In the frozen scenery of Northland
Is where the dark demon sleeps
The black coffin covered in blood
The blood of Mother Earth
Her life is weak
So weak that the demon feel
Her present loss
Twilight days behind the walls
Black ravens hover
And shadows whisper the return
Of the asleeping immortal
Demon in the north castle
The castle of doom
Demon sleeps... son be awake
The fall of gods cheap origin
Demon dreams...become true
Dreams of a blackened earth
A fire storm over the earth
It's the destiny of Mother Earth
