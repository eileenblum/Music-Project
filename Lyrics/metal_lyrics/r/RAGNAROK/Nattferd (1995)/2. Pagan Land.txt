Into darkness I'll go
To fight for the devil force
Now I am a demon
And a horde
Of northern darkness
I leave all glory
And join the hordes of evil
I'm filled whit hate
Pagan land
From the darkness side of life
This is the pagan land
From this land
Shall demons fly
Out in battle they go
To fight for the dark shadow
Shadow will raise
In the pagan land
So true and evil
The land of pagan rising
So I follow the dark side
And became a horde of the
Land of Christian death
