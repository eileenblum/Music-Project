Goat dead wolf
Prince black dog
From the sulphur battlefields
The night hunter emerges
Eyes have the flames from below
Death mask possession
For I am one with the master
I he master within
Tellus beware Your child has no future
Grant me my crown of horns so that the wings may grow out
Out
Spontaneous self combustion
Tornado of wildfire
Hyper diseased mega beast
Turningold to coal
I promise death unclean
My demons unleashed upon you
Gonna kneel before you die
Every home a slaughterhouse
