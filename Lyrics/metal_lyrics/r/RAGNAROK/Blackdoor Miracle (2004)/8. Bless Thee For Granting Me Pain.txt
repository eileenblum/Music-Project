Embraced by darkness
I hear creatures so lifeless
Laugh at me
I feel the wings of death
Reach out for me
I smell its breath a smell of evil
Cold air twist my skin
The pulse of infinity chokes me

Bless thee for granting me pain
For blinding my eyes
And cleansing my mind
...immortalize my soul

Mirror so divine
Show me my dreams
Drams of hate
Where the blood
Of my enemies is spilled
...make them real

As I scream in pain
My final scream
My being dissolves
And fills the emptiness
Now I am all
I am the hate in man
Blood spilled in my name
...in sacrifice
Feeds my hordes
To carry out my dreams.
