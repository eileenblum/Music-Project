Home from the crossroads
I was never the same again
He hides in my shadow
Like the savagery I carry

Abyss angel nobles the man giving wings
My bloody signature the Devil's knight

I could see in her eyes what she was thinking
As she came in &amp; found me dining with the king

Now!
Read a chapter to the flaming curser &amp; his pale apprentice

Wanna know what your daughter did?

Switchblade slut
Ugly dance
Demon fever
3-horned trance

Torture her, torment her lake her life
She's dreamt of it for such a long time

To die in pain Suffer
Razor tongue cunnilingus
Obscene nightgown death
Deep multiple river shining red in the skin

She folded her lips around my weapon &amp; took the shot

She was sweet but her taste was damn sour
My five winged heart sent her down below

Now the flames are licking her
The flames are licking her
