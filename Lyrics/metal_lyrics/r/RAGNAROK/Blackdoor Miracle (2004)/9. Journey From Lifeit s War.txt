Bodyless...
Senseless...
Poisoned veins...
Inhale the scent-inhale no more
Unconscious...
Mind silenced...

Exhale your death
Birth of fire
Close your eyes no longer a liar
Flesh forgotten now body of light
Ether betrodden earth out of sight

The ocean purple spirits of the past
Spells of vengeance on mankind we cast

Floating on a black sea
Drink the poisoned water.
Drowning, leaving life
Senses fading, emotions dying.
I enter a void a void filled with voices.
Seal the blackened surface - no return.

Fumbling in emptiness
Learn to enjoy it's infinity,
Becoming part of it joining evil voices
Inhaling the powers divine.

Can never again taste
The sweet pain of death.
My paragon realm
Among shapeless ones.
So cold,
So dark.
So endless...
