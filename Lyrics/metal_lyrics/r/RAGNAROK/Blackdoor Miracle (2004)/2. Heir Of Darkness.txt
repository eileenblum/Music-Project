The infinity of blackness calms me
I feed in its embrace
It makes me strong
Gives me powers beyond life
I'm in a womb-son of darkness
My throne be the womb
As my unborn soul is eternal

Mother eat the light
Raise me in forever black night.
And so I swear
Never to leave this dark
My kingdom of hate

Emptiness between the stars
Black nothing of eternal night
Granter of unlife-mother of silenced souls
Sator-Saturnus-Sathanas

I will never be born
Forever embryo of blackness
I inherit the hate
That dissolves the light and blackens the stars
In my kingdom of night
Beginning of time never was and never will be
For I was there
And forever am.
