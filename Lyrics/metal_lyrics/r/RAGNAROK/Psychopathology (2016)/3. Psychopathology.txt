Psychopathology - I'm inside your mind
I dig through your future and past - I dissect your soul

Psychopathology - Assessing your senses
Numbing your inner self - Strip you of all self-respect

Psychopathology - Exorcising the ghosts
From your terrible past - Or bringing them back to life

Sociopath - Antisocial behavior - Criminal mind
No sense of moral responsibility
No social conscience
No perception of what's right or wrong
No chance to make a sensible choice

Impaired - Dimnished
Weakened and damaged
Mentally - As well as physically
The cure is worse than the disease
A victim of trial and error

Psychopathology - I'm inside your mind
I dig through your future and past
I dessect your soul

Psychopathology - Assessing your senses
Numbing your inner self
Strip you of all self-respect

Psychopathology
Exorcising the ghosts
From your terrible past
Or bringing them back to life
