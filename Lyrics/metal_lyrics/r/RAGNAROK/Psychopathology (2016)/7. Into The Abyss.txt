Falling
The fires of Gehenna
Hellish demons
Eternal damnation
Soaring
Open wide the gates of hell
Primal force
Nature's core

Into the abyss - Into the abyss

Waiting - Satan's repossessing my soul
Longing for - Unity with the ones I love

Into the abyss - Into the abyss

Awaiting the condemned
Awaiting my descent
Carnivorous intent
My following awaits

My hell has been on earth
Time now to divert
Return my true identity
I will enjoy it splendidly

Welcome
You shall be my only son
The one I trust
The chosen one
Consolidation
Solidarity of souls
Community
Togetherness and unity

Into the abyss - Into the abyss
