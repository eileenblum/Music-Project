From the abyss
I come to possess your mind
I'm here to hunt you down
Feel the fear

I condemn you to loneliness
To slowly choke in emptiness

Kneel before my feet - Feel the anger in me
Taste the iron - Beg for your life

Cursed to feel eternal pain
You will never be the same

My creator - My curse
Your death - Suffering!

See the ghosts from your past
Cursed to feel eternal pain

You ripped me apart
Taking my creator away

I will never be the same
You will always be in my mind

My creator - My curse
Your death - Suffering!
