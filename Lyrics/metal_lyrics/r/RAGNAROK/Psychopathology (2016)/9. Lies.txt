Pain
Perpetual
Treason
Betrayal

Lies - They make you thrive
Lies - Spin your web of deception
Lies - Soaking me up
Lies - Like the sucker I am

Lies - They make you strong
Lies - While I grow weak
Lies - Making the charade complete
Lies - Making the irony come real

Ungrateful, backstabbing, treacherous...
Biting the hand that feeds you
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Smile and the world will laugh in your face
Bleeding me dry of honor and respect
While my anger multiplies

Pain
Perpetual
Treason
Betrayal

Lies - They make you thrive
Lies - While my patience grows him
Lies - Exploiting my naivety
Lies - My good hearted nature

Lies - They make you strong
Lies - While I grow weak
Lies - Pushing to the limit
Lies - Creating a killing machine
