I hate - Your betrayal, my strength
I hate - I seek to seal your fate
To feast on your entrails
Engorge myself in your embrace

Hate, pain, lies - Hate, pain, lies

Betrayal is your only friend
The lies that keep you all but safe
Striving for a better place
Positioning yourself
Deception is your only game
Optimizing your pursuit
Self-inflicting lobotomy
No empathy is left for you

I hate - I violate your faith
I take it upon myself
To straighten out the mistakes you've made

I hate - I trusted your intent
Your dagger is my mortal coil
Steel that pierce my very soul

Hate, pain, lies - Hate, pain, lies

A Judas of  the present day
The Brutus of my life
A sneak assassin in disguise
I won't back down without a fight
Trust has died a violent death
No compassion, no regret
I'll make you eat your lies
Removing your disguise

I hate - You will regret the day
The day you looked my way
Mark my words... you will pay

Hate, pain, lies - Hate, pain, lies

I am void of all my fear
Boldly go where eagles dare
Feeling strong within myself
Trusting in my own intent
Standing tall, spirit high
Watching as your vigor dies
It's hard to lie without breath
Impossible to stab when you are dead
