The eight of the seven plagues - Scourge of today
The eight of the seven plagues - Cursing us all

Endless war of good and evil
Between believers and heathens
Every story ha multiple sides
Every coin has but two

The eight of the seven plagues - Scourge of today
The eight of the seven plagues - Cursing us all

The irony of it all
The winners write history
We're supposed to learn from it
But we never do

Believe and you shall find
Your search for peace of mind
The lies that you are served
Will only see you purged

The quest for the light
Will lead into the dark
One second you are gone
...you'd think there was more to life

The eight of the seven plagues - Scourge of today
The eight of the seven plagues - Cursing us all

When everyone is brainwashed
Who are least in the wrong?
The propaganda of it all
The blatant lies

The eight of the seven plagues - Scourge of today
The eight of the seven plagues - Cursing us all

Hypocritical masses
The silent majority
No-one dares to take a stand
Do you accept to be led by the blind?

It's time to doubt authority
It's time to question what you hear
Trust yourself, head helt high
Being bold, running wild

Use your eyes and you will see
What history has yet to see
That it's gods themselves
That are the eight of the seven plagues
