Satan, Belial, Lucifer, Leviathan

His infernal majesty - Enthroned to rule the chosen ones
Who defines good and evil?
Who reaps what  you sow?

Infernal majesty - Indulgence and vital existence
Infernal majesty - Wisdom, integrity, hatred
Infernal majesty - Vengeance and sins of the flesh
Infernal majesty - Blasphemy, diabolical indignation

Who judges and stigmatizes?
The christian doctrine must go

The true prince of evil
The king of the slaves
Your name is Christ
King of hypocritical traits

Where the strong will survive
And the weak will be slain
In a world ruled by justice
That's where Satan will reign

Infernal majesty - The prince of darkness
Infernal majesty - Serpent of old
Infernal majesty - Son of perdition
Infernal majesty - The monarch of deities

Satan, Belial, Lucifer, Leviatha

Infernal majesty - Indulgence and vital existence
Infernal majesty - Wisdom, integrity, hatred
Infernal majesty - Vengeance and sins of the flesh
Infernal majesty - Blasphemy, diabolical indignation
