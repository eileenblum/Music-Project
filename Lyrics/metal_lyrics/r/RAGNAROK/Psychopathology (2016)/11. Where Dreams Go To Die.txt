Am I awake, or am I asleep? Am I... imagining...

Is it a dream, the visions I see? Is it... reality...

Where dreams go to die 
Where dreams go to die
Where dreams go to die
The nightmare is alive
Where dreams go to die - Fears grow wings and fly

A bestial murder
A terrible ghost
Demonic... possession

Inhumane torture
Excruciating pain
I have... been slain

Is it a dream,  the visions I see? Is it... reality...

Cold hands strangling me - Anxiety is choking me
I can't seem to wake - Trapped in the maze

Bony fingers hold me down
Violent force, putrid breath
Stench of death fills the room
A feeling of impending doom

Spur of the moment
Vindictiveness
No impact analysis

No sense of consequences
Rupturing the skin
Grinding the flesh...
vindictiveness

They are for real
the visions I see
It's my...
reality

Where dreams go to die 
Where dreams go to die
Where dreams go to die
The nightmare is alive
Where dreams go to die
Fears grow wings and fly
