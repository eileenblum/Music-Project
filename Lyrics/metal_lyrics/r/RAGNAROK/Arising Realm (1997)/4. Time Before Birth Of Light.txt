He was born when the sun was black
In time when the infernal forces was one and only
Time before the birth of light as the beast of world and master of evil
He is the spirit of hate now as the time before light
He was the ruler and creator in ages and he is still our master
We can still hear the anger of the beast
Hate more pure... than a water of an mountain source
In thousands of year he tried to conquer the new religion of glory times
He can feel its present weakness and the upcoming conquer of evil
Defeat is not a word of his world
He is always the master of all creations
Let his destiny fall upon us and the world is what it once was
The conquer of evil
