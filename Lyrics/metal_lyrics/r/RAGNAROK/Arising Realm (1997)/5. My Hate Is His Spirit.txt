In the twilight of the day do I see the sun disappear behind a bloodred horizon
I can feel the insatiable night consume all light
Emperor of the darkly time give my darkest gift
I have now entered your world
My hate is your spirit and your hope to conquer the world
A realm of vicious creations came from the mist and rised
The dark knight have entered
He is ferocious in his sight
a perfect murderer as he enter the world of mortals
this is the hour of darkness
welcome to the devilnight
