Blood streams in a dream
a dream of the christ's defeat
the dark horde have conquered
The christians burn in fire below the fullmoon shining in a cold winternight
The Christians certain death
our time is here
A bestial bloodwar...
We chase the Christians as the mighty wolf of the deep forest
Chase and drown their victims in blood
We chop them to pieces with swords tempered in blood
We let the blood flow to the ground
In the night can we hear the raven sing its song about the certain fall of christians
We kneel and worship our master and pay the homage to the eternal night
