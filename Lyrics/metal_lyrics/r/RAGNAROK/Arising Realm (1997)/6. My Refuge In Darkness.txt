A new world has opened
a world among the stars
I have now found my star and it will be my new home
until the end of my stargate vision
Among the star I rest now
it's the time of silent
Only the sound of falling stars break the silent
Only in my dreams exist this world
It's just wonderful to hover in the empty space
No feelings for humanity
a perfect world for me
I wish it last forever
This world made from depths of the darkest space of mind
Such vision of deathview
I search now for my death and meet the shadow world
