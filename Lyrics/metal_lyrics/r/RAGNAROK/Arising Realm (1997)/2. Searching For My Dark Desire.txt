When the night falls after another day of sorrow
do darkness draw itself deeply in to my soul and sin
From depths of my inner darkness is the unholy strength rapidly growing
The power of the dark demon is an eternal satisfaction
demon of my world give me the strength that you have
This moment of glorious defeat is an eternal memory
a journey... a learning of my inner self
Share your dreams with me
hate, sorrow and evil dreams
dreams I love with whole my heart
Draw me down in the devil's kingdom
into the sea of flames and the rivers of grief
Take my hate and draw me down
I can feel your glowing nails rip in my soul...
The wind storms within my thoughts
and blow out what is left of goodness
Water made from of tears of the grieve dead
fills my veins and make my heart totally black
The soil place my corpse and the flame increases
I see the gate of hell accomodate me
I see the mighty demon ready to embrace me
Embrace me... my diabolical shadow
I am the one...
I am one of them...
Join me...
join the eternal flame
My darkest desire is fulfilled
JOIN US !!!
