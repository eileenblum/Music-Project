Rushing through the sky, hunting the horizon, hunting towards the end
The eyes of a man suffers the rage of our infinite master
Power and passion, hate and sins, raise your fires from the abyss within

Fire sweeping the earth, ruining the soil, as the rage strikes upon you
Fire, bleeding fire, smoke burying breathing living remains, covering
your remains

Spirits from below rushing from the caves, setting fire to the sky
Turning ancient wisdom against the earth
Satan opening the gates, embrace the fires towards your skin

Rushing through the sky, hunting the horizon, hunting towards the end
The eyes of a man suffers the rage of our infinite master
Power and passion, hate and sins, raise your fires from the abyss within

Glory, spitting fire, never again
Raging Antichrist burning the earth - fire!

Fire sweeping the earth, cracking the soil, as the rages strikes upon you
Fire, bleeding fire, smoke burning breathing living remains, covering your remains

Enter the gates, see the force arising

Rushing through the sky, hunting the horizon, hunting towards the end
The eyes of a man suffers the rage of our infinite master
Power and passion, hate and sins, raise your fires from the abyss within
