Death, screaming without a sound
Wizards of madness, commanding beasts
May madness hunt you down
Raging through the dusty air

Fallen far behind, these symbols of God
Empty landscapes to fill with passion of the temptator
Apocalyptic dreams, awaking the depths
Suffocated dreamers, enlightening the portal

Through me, enriching the mind
The winds carving souls, eternal breaths of nothing
Through me, enriching the mind
The path, bright before you I stand

Through me, enriching the mind
Only I search out the key for the one to enter
The path, searching for the codes, may madness hunt you down
The path, bright before you I stand

Death, screaming without a sound
Wizards of madness, commanding beasts
May madness hunt you down
Raging through the dusty air

Through me, enriching the mind
The winds carving souls, eternal breaths of nothing
Through me, enriching the mind
The path, bright before you I stand
