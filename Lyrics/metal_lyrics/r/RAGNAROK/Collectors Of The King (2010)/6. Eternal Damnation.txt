So pure the passions, overwhelming the shattered remains, all lost for the once so giving
Searching further, far from the soil, there is nothing left, no light for the living

Reaching out in hope, stretching out towards blackened skies
Thunder hunting down your whispers towards the heavens
The eye can see the dooming of dreams, cracking through the false, the mountain overwhelming
With the angels seduced through unholy rites, your wounds are open and starving, terror upon you, feeding the terror

Falling from the sky, the ashes of heaven
The wind sweeping away the spirits of Christ
Lonely lies the prays, forgotten are the symbols of a brighter distance
Feast upon the slaves, the king of temptation... the king of temptation...

Hordes of demon possessed, crawling in masses, feeding the fires arising from the depths
Ravens swirling the empty landscapes, the dark lord harvest through the possessed

Fall for ruler of the earth, Satan

Masses of chaos, inflicting the eternal damnation
Masses of war, ending all
