Gasping in the night, stabbed by the horns
Moans beneath the pentagram, fuelling the spirit of the ritual
Shivers hanging from the cross
Blood streaming from the signs on your chest

Possessive hands coming forth from the night
Strapped before the signs of Hell

You're shivering, goose bumped shivering

Split your legs apart, riding the thorns, eyes white rolling in possession
For the shadow you shall spread, pulled to the horned, forcing penetration

Horned for the beast, for me the path growing stronger

Choke hold victory... choke hold victory...

Gasping in the night, fulfillment, stabbed by the horns

Screams beneath the pentagram, stabbed by the horns
Screams beneath the pentagram, hanging upon the inverted cross

Raw mercy laid down, occult madness and rituals
Goring glory rising the dead, mirroring future in my eyes

You're shivering, no escaping the spells, your shivering is the pleasure

Choke hold victory... choke hold victory...
