The rites of black candles and death, the scent of blood and incense
Through the smoke of the burning cauldron, I call upon Thee

Him who absorbs the light, Mephisto, I pronounce your blasphemic name
He who enjoys the stench of sulphur, Satan

I demand your powers to serve my will, I perform the evil dance
As thou danced before Solomon, o mighty Belial

Kingdom of God is open for me
I desecrate the holy gate in honour of Satan

I indulge in perversion and sin
Oh, great lord Lucifer, grant fulfilment upon my desires

My soul is the key to Satan's kingdom of magic

In honour of Satan, demons rejoice
In honour of Satan, I spill blood, the blood of man

In honour of Satan, demons rejoice
In honour of Satan, I spill blood, the blood of man
