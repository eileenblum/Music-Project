Can you hear me I am calling you
Iâll make you my sword of destiny
Sweat, lust, fear erecting you
Prove your veins go straight through me

A faithful soldier under my command
Ask no questions yield no ground
Your order is to do or die
Itâs not an option to fall behind

Out from the black â Possess me!

Fade into obscurity
Go beyond the black
Dive into your dark desires

I am the one who has come for you innocence
I am the one who has come for you mortal soul

Fade into obscurity
Succumb to my command
Surrender your will to my beck and call

You are my recruitment tool
To populate hell with fresh souls
Your rewardâs to serve me loyally
Youâll never bow down to poverty

[âFade into Obscurityâ is about succumbing to Satanâs will, and liking it.]
