Nocturnal hour
Around the pit of fire
Magic circle
Surrounds the demonâs pyre
Occult symbols
Traced in the barren soil
Arterial drainage
Flesh for the sacrifice

Manipulate your will
Show you the illusion
Knowledge from the kill
Demon of solution

Chalice of blood
Held high towards the sky
Mutilation
Consumption of the corpse
Words are spoken
For me to summon thee
Sacrificial
Core of the ceremony

Manipulate your will
Show you the illusion
Knowledge from the kill
Demon of solution

Necromantic Summoning Ritual

['Necromancy is the art of summoning a spirit or a demon. Medieval practitioners believed they could accomplish three things with necromancy; will manipulation, illusions and knowledge. This could be pretty useful as demons were summoned to cause various afflictions on others. It could be to drive them mad, to inflame them to love or hatred, to gain their favor or to constrain them to do or not do some deed. This could be very useful, indeed.']
