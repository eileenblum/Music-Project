My words will pierce through you.
My plotting will demolished you.
Control is an illusion.

All order will fall.
You will beckon my call.
Itâs I who stand tall.

Divide et impera.

The world will be taken in.
Youâll kneel for the king.
You can never win.

My omniscient rule.
Divine intervention?
I laugh in your face.

['This lyric is about talking shit behind peopleâs backs, making them insecure and creating conflicts. If you manage to tear the feeling of unity apart, itâs easier for you to take control and reign. Itâs better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven.']
