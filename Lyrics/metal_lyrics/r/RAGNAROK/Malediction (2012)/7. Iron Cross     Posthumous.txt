Infernal machinegun fire
Nocturnal winter dire
The Stalinorgan plays
A hellish serenade
Human remains lie scattered
All thatâs left of my brothers
A darkened sky decends
The hail of steel prevails

Iron Cross â Posthumous

Hear the sound
Incoming shell
Feel the steel
My fate is sealed

My blood is shed
Christ has fled
Feel the pain
See the stain

God is dead
For whom I bled
Satanâs real
Heâll cut me a deal

I grind my teeth
Get on my feet

A clenched fist of putrid stench
The corpses have ripened nicely
The eerie sound of tanks
Drawing nearer on my flank
Your God isnât here today
Satan has come to stay
Pick carefully the side
Of which you choose to fight

Iron Cross â Posthumous

I slip and slide
No way to hide
I run towards
The awaiting hordes

My path is stained
With human remains
Path of entrails
Iâm already dead

The honourâs mine
I stood my ground
I didnât give in
To anything

Ragnarok
Valhalla is my destiny
I found my soul
In Odinâs hall.

[âIron Cross â Posthumousâ is about the Norwegians who fought on the German side in World War 2. This was mostly young boys who had no idea of what they were getting themselves into. Most of them had no political conviction, but were adventurous or on the run from home. The remains of most of them are still lying in forest beds in the Baltics. Only some of their bodies were recovered and sent home. Their families got their iron crosses posthumous.]
