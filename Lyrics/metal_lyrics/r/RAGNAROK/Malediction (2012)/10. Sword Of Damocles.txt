As smooth as the gums of a toothless nun
My blade will slide between your ribs

As swift as the thoughts of a headless priest
My guillotine will sever your head

Unstable sexuality of a monk
My crossbow will split your skull
False promises of Christianity
My gun will separate your spine

Pride goes before a fall
The sword of Damocles
Uneasy lies that wears a crown
The sword of Damocles
Above impious hangs a drawn sword
The sword of Damocles
Impending doom is growing strong
The sword of Damocles

As easy as nailing a carpenter to a cross
My nails will pierce you palms

Treacherous sermon for the weak
My words will seal your fate
Lucrative promiscuity of a whore
My greed will be your ruin

As fierce as the anger of a wolverine
My razor rearranges your face

[The legend of the âSword of Damoclesâ is that a sword can cut both ways. Itâs good to have, enjoy and exercise power, but at some point you may find yourself in a position where the sword swings back at you. Pride goes before a fall.]
