Diabolous
Thereâs a demon in my view
Venomous
For those who are not of the worthy few
Satanized
Thereâs demon in my view
Treacherous
Your blood would freeze if you only knew

My demon, my friend, my lair
My demon, no burden, to bear

I will stay inside
I cannot be exorcised
You need me
As much as I need you

Iâm the one who whispers
Wisdom in your ear
Iâm the one who keeps your back
Straight and erect

I am your only friend
No one else will take the blame
When you show your face
And stand up for yourself

This is the ugly truth
The ego, your own pursuit
A man is a man
Is a manâs best friend

Subconsciously
Thereâs a demon in my view
Viciously
If youâre the kind who wonât follow through
Consistently
Thereâs a demon in my view
Ruthlessly
Heâll slaughter those who are crossing me

My demon, my ally, my peer
My demon, my keeper, from fear

I will stay inside
I cannot be exorcised
You need me
As much as I need you

Iâm the one who whispers
Wisdom in your ear
Iâm the one who keeps your back
Straight and erect

I am your only friend
No one else will take the blame
When you show your face
And stand up for yourself

This is the ugly truth
The ego, your own pursuit
A man is a man
Is a manâs best friend

[âA Demon in My Viewâ is about our inner demons. We all have an inner demon who chooses to show himself when we need him the most. He can show his face when weâre not up to being enough honest, mean, strong or tough. He comes to us when we are in need of survival or keeping up appearances. We need him and he needs us.]
