Heresy
How can it be?
That I am sacrificed for you
Lunacy
The irony
Iâve no use for the greater good

Mind, body, soul
Your will remains your own

Individual
Nowhere to be found
You better start thinking for yourself
Follower
Be a leader instead
Donât let anyone administrate your life

Dolce et decorum est pro patria mori

Democracy
But only for you
Iâm the one whoâs fighting for your rights
Gormandize
Larger than life
While Iâm the sacrificial lamb

Mind, body, soul
Your will remains your own

Sodomized
By the heads of state
The warmonger is never in the fight
Rearmament
Your own delight
Itâs high time you fight your own fight

Dolce et decorum est pro patria mori

['Why is always individuals sacrificed for the greater good? Why is it that great men are sacrificed so that lazy fat bastards can survive and live a life in luxury? Wouldnât the other way around make more sense?']
