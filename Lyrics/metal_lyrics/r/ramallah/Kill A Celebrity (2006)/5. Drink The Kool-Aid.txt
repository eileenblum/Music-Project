Here come the 757's.

If you don't ask why then you deserve to die
just like the millions that are ground under foot
by the powers-that-be and their policies
and a society that lets their bosses do as they please

And never asks "why?" even as the death tolls rise
until some 757's start to fall from the sky
and some more innocent die and STILL we don't ask "why?"
instead we fall in line and we drink up the Kool-Aid

If they shot Kennedy just imagine what they'll do to you or me
but you STILL believe...

So burn then coward, but don't you dare pray.
Burn then, for what's been done in your name.
So fucking burn then, you had your chance: now it's time to die.
Burn then. You drank the Kool-Aid, fool, so die.

If you don't ask why then you deserve to die;
(BTW) that little sticker of a flag on your car means nothing.
For the terror you've allowed in your name,
when the planes fall again, your prayers will mean nothing.

If they shot Kennedy, imagine what they'll do to you and me
but you still believe all their lies, HA!
That sticker of a flag on your car means nothing
When the sky falls again, your prayers will mean nothing.

So burn then coward, but don't you dare pray.
Burn then, for what's been done in your name.
So fucking burn then. You had your chance, now it's time to die.
Burn then. You drank the Kool-Aid, fool, so die.

Die then, sucker, but don't you pray.
Die then, fool, and burn for your shame.
So fucking burn then. You had your chance, now it's time to die.
Burn then. You drank the Kool-Aid, fool, so die.

Drink up. Die.

The hour's late and we're so far astray
but we refuse to see that the end of the party is near.
And all that hatred and rage we've made
is coming at us just like a jet plane.
