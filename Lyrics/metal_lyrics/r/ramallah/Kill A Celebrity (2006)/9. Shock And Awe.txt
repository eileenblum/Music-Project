A new millennium is christened in 2003
When tens of thousands are condemned to die.
While we danced and drank fine wine
They were screaming to an empty sky.

Why?

Kill my mother, kill my father
What am I left to do?
But kill your mother, kill your father
God make my aim true...

Is anybody even listening?
Does anybody even care?
'Cause the beat just goes on and on.
And the terror never ends.

Tens of thousands were condemned to die.

Shock and awe.
Fallujah.
Shock and awe.
Terror...

Is anybody listening? (Can you hear the screaming?)
Does anybody care? (Can you hear their screaming?)
Is anybody listening to the sounds of the innocent
suffering, suffering silently? No.
