From the darkest nightmare to the light of new life
he rose up to challenge the world.
Lost in the insanity of drugs, crime, and poverty,
this phoenix rose to righteously fight his war.
He spit at our illusions and he raged against the lies.
He knew he faced death but still he gladly gave his life.
Life.

What a beautiful rage.
What a noble crusade.
What a beautiful hatred.
What a noble life lost taken away.

If I only had the strength to stand half as tall for the truth,
maybe then I'd find my hope and faith renewed.
I wish I could face this world
with the same bravery and beautiful rage and noble hatred.

I wish I was as strong as you
in everything that I do.
I wish I was as brave and true
until the day I die.
