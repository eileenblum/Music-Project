Darkness so far away
From the night of grace
light of day

Our darkness brings today
There no reason to fray

you're such a pretty flower
but now you know that you're gonna DIE
So dry your eyes and wipe your tears
you're not the first to believe a lie
you're like a red red rose that hunny
I want to rip you from your vine
let me know when the lights go dim baby
what going through your mind

Darkness so far away
from the night of grace
light of day

Our darkness brings today
There no reason to fray

bye bye bye baby you're only young but you're gonna die
die die die my lady everything you ever loved is a lie

Maybe on the other side we can learn to lie
learn to lie of grace
I want to fly I want to learn to fly

Our darkness brings today
there no reason to fray

bye bye baby you're only young but you're gonna die
die die die my lady everything you ever loved is a lie

bye bye baby you're only younger but you're gonna die
die die die my lady everything you ever love is a lie
