Here I'm bleeding as I'm drinking and I'm thinking that I'm sinking to a brand new hell that is worse than the hell that I knew before and all I want is more.
Yeah, it could kill me but I'd eagerly die for one more...

Ha! And if I die today,
what have I really had to say?
Will I be saved?

There's so much more to say.
Oh God please
I need a little more time then I can fade

Do you want to know why I do dope?
I'm interested in why you don't, when our whole world is children drenched in their parents own blood.

And if I die today what will I leave behind?
Will I be saved?
And as I fade away I leave behind the pain and the hate and the lies of this place behind...
