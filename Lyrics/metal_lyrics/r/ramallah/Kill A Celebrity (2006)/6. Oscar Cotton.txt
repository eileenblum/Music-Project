If I could painlessly murder us all
then there would be no more children crying
to our deaf God up above.

If I could painlessly murder the world
then there would be no more children crying:
then there would be no more children crying at all.

I want to hide in an opium sunrise.
I'd rather fly than feel the pain.
I want to die in a heroine sunrise.
Go on and spike my vein...

So sick... there is a snatch of an old song
blaring inside my head but I know I ain't dead, no.
This can't be hell: I'm way too cold, I'm shivering.
The cold sweat is like broken glass;
isn't this a gas? Come and join the party!

Baby to his mother:
please smother me now.
Baby to her mother:
please smother me now.

I want to hide in an opium sunrise.
The world is burning...
I'd rather fly than feel the pain.
The world is burning...
I want to die in a heroine sunrise.
The world is burning me.
Go on and spike my vein...
