(Sugar plum fairy)

I read the news today oh boy
about a lucky man who made the grade
and though the news was rather sad
well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
he hadn't noticed that the lights had changed to a shade of gray
A crowd of people stood and stared
they'd seen his face before
nobody was really sure if he was from the House Of Lords

I saw a film today oh boy
the US army had just dropped some peace on the Middle East
a crowd of people turned away
but I just had to look
having read the book

I'd love to turn you on...

Woke up, got out of bed
wiped the blood off of my head
found my way upstairs and I did a shot
and looking up I noticed I was late
found my coat, grabbed my hat
I made the bus in seconds flat
I found my way upstairs and I did a snort
and somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
three thousand holes at New York's ground zero
and though the holes were rather small
we had to count them all
now we know how many holes it takes to make the towers fall

I'd love to turn you on...
