Daddy please
Stay away from me
Daddy please
I'm just your little girl
Daddy please
Do you see what you're doing to me?
Do you see what you've done
To my world?
Father
Father stay away from me
Father
Father I'm just a little boy
Father
Do you see what you're doing to me?
Do you see what you've done
To my world?
Not just my body
But you took my soul
I can always hide in a bottle
Once an open heart
Now I have a black hole
Now they want to call me a monster
I never heard a child
Pray to be a monster
I never heard a child
Pray to be a beast
I never heard a child
Pray to be a criminal
But here we are once again
My friend but here we are...
