The clock is ticking
On these terrible time
And human blood is flowing
Daily like water
The blood it never dries
How longs a man
To turn the other cheek
Before he rises
And returns the slaughter?
Rises and spits in your eye
Where do you run to?
When it's all that you know?
How do you turn your back
On your world?
We laughed and quipped
About a revolution
Now it's coming
At the point of a gun
And a suicide bomb...
This is the end, beautiful friend
This is the end
Looks like the party's over
This is the end, beautiful friend
This is the end, my only friend
This is the end
Unless we change the whole world
Now what we gonna do?
You do to me and I do to you
That's how it's gonna end
With a whimper, no!
