Not made for these times
This is the end my friend
I wasn't made for these times
(and) I want to fly away
To a simpler time
To a better day
Who am I to believe in?
Who are you to believe in me?
(I'm just) a junkie, a drunkard
A bastard, a monster
Hiding from my sins
A broken prophet
From a dead end street
But we live in such terrible times
I gotta speak my mind
'cause inhumanity is all I see
It's right in front of you
It's right in front of me
I testify 'cause I'm damned if I lie but...
Who I to believe in?
Who are you to believe in me?
I wasn't made for these times
And sometimes I'd like to
Tear out my eyes
And be blind
To this world that I see
