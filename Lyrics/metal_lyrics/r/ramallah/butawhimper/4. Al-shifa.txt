August 20 1998
Tens of thousands
Are condemned to die
While we danced and drank fine wine
They were screaming to an empty sky
Why?
Kill my mother, kill my father
What am I (left) to do
...but kill your mother, kill your father
God make my aim true...
Is anybody even listening?
Does anybody even care?
Why?
Cause the beat just goes on and on
And the terror never ends
Is anybody listening?
(can you hear the screaming?)
Does anybody care?
(can you hear the screaming?)
Is anybody listening
To the sounds of the innocent
Suffering, suffering, silently
Why?
