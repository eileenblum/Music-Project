When you are waiting for tomorrow
Wishing for a rainbow
You miss your today
You've got only yesterday

Spending years with no goal
Human box, with no soul
Men are wasting their life's time

Makes 'em change into damned
Time you lose is what you choose
Open eyes get in control
You'll try one time and no more
Get in touch
Life is a whore
Life is a war

No more days spend this way
No more lies in our lives
Time will never come again
Time fades, fades away

Pray to your God pray for time again
A chance you lost, sign of life
A chance you lost, made you cry
No judge shall show tears for you

Where do you run it's the end
Choice's in your hands
Master time tells you your rights
No excuse, mistakes in sight
