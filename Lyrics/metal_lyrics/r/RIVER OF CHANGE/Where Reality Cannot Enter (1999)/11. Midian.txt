The sulphur's smell
Creatures of the absurd,
lost in mazes absurds
a thousand bodies a thousand free souls

Heaven on earth
Holy land to castaways
Created by the will
By Baphomet's power;

MIDIAN, oh MIDIAN,
home of the light
underground's frozen walls,
MIDIAN, in MIDIAN,
to far away for the sight of the blind mankind

The repudiated tribe
Survives in freedom
Only driven by
Their instinct and desires

For this massacreted
Dreamers in freedom
Guilty to embody
The man's secret dream,
MIDIAN, oh MIDIAN
Welcome your son,
MIDIAN, oh MIDIAN
Into your frozen womb!
