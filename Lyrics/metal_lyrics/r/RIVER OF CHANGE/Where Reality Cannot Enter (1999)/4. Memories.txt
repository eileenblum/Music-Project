I remember the face of my father, my eyes
lost in his smile
I remember painted emotions on his face
They just grazed to the years...

The laughing and games with the childhood's
friends,
the wish to grow up and the secret impatience,
the salty taste of the pain,
the uncertain flight of my first love...

I remember an ancient, tearing pain,
a sorrow lost in time
the happy years, light hearted years...
I remember the fresh smell in the woods
And the sultry days in the summertime
I remember the icy fury inside of me
And the warmth of the open friendship

The sensation to be invincible
Inside of my heart invulnerable.
The life intense, the shining eyes
Emotions so strong to make me tremble...

I remember the death of my father
A sorrow lost in time, engraved in the eyes of
a child

My open eyes on the ancient horizons,
the howl of the wind, the twilight in red
the battle's echoes just ended in the blood
the look of the sad king lost in his dead men.

I remember an ancient grudge of another life
A sorrow lost in time
Reminiscences to the mist of the past...
I remember...
