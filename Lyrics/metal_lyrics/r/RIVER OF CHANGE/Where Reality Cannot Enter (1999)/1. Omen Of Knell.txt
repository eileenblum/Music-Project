Thunders and lightning all over the land
The sword is tightly held in the hand
The sight grew dim, the fog is strong
So far away sounds a horn

Chill and mud into the surcoat
It's just the fear that you still scorn
Come on my braves, we'll write history
What's fundamental is victory

Cuttin' blow gives me so much honor
Hundred times my sword brings the death
Deep in the wounds, I push the steel
I gaze the ground, the warriors I kill

Using the blood of the enemy killed
We'll get stronger each death we bring
Come on my blade give me what I need
The rage is on

Warriors and knights they're still fighting
Villages in flames and women that cry
Can you hear the stroke of the bell?
Listen with care it is an omen of knell
