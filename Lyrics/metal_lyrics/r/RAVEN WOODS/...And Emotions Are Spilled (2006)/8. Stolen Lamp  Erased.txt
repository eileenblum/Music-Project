Lost in seconds and never turns back
Easy to be told as hard to be stabbed

Disturbing brightness, a needless face
Step forward to
Empty crowd, just move to brace
They don't care
Voices floating in a broken tune
Pieces of lives seem impure

Where did I fail to escape, to find a way
What is that sound always at back
Once I had a friend, something to say
Visions are stolen, smiles erased
I just stand to be inside of them
But lost in crowd when I find am
Nothing is permanent to believe with faith
With fear I embrace the faint

Where did I chase a glimpse of fate
In this confusing day
From voices flying away
Once I had a plan, something to change
Visions are stolen, smiles erased
Imaginations that sneak into the mind
Causing need to penance, must be stopped
Losing a precious time once felt, a fright
Running out, feel again, stand to fight!

Matter of conceiving life...

Disturbing brightness, a needless face
Step forward to
Empty crowd, just move to brace
Life won't care...
