I 'm waiting here for my end
My life flows with my tears
From my face to my bloodied hands
And my hopeless soul is dark and cold...

Hearing the order of death, coming closer
With his pale wings like black mist
Landing  on my flesh
Irresistible pains are defeating my heart
Like a frostbite
The stars are getting darker
Now my hopeless soul is alone in the dusk...

Death is nearing,
His footsteps tremble the earth
Claiming that he owns me !
With his flaming horns and sharp eyes 
He seeps into my flesh 
A cold breath is flowing down my shoulders
As he's spreading the seeds of darkness
Coroding my soul, he burns and destroys

Darkness surrounds me
Death is growing...

And I' m leaving my flesh on the mass of pure water
My eyes are closing slowly...
Hearing the breathing of trees
With silent eyes they are watching my fall...

Now my soul is his temple
But he is my decay
