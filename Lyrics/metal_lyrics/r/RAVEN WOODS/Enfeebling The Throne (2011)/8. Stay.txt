I am reaching through deep silence
In to ocean of purity
My voice is to be lost then my dreams are for real

I am flowing in to deep silence

A trace is to be lost, may a memory will live in...
Shall we meet in the end?
Is that your step to me?
Is this my breath fading?
May this be so easy
To see, what it could have been

I am reaching through deep silence
In to ocean of purity falling
My voice is to be lost then my dreams are for real
I am flowing in to deep silence
A trace is to be lost, may a memory will live in...
