Devious, crusted shores of weakened funeral divine
Fallen fields by catharsis of clouds raining blood

Endarkened skies in light of their shrines
Endarken the souls, let them suffer and cry

Diagnostics of disease outcome
Collapse of epoch, unrested minds
Come, gather of unite the legions
Legions on my way of darkened sun

Taste the wrath of soils hunger for your flesh and blood
Spilled on the surface of your creation, fade to lust

For declension - of decomposition
We dispose to divest
Divest from the brightest shine - of your entity
Your era will fall
And my darkened sun - will rise again

Horrified, rebutted souls of blinded cruel spawn
Yet enlightened in holes of deception, buried alive
Lifeless, paralysed unconscious ecstasy through carnage
Carnage of the souls in dismay to be entwined
