Ov, my restless blood feeds my soil of darkened heart
Scumming fools they are - suffer for mercy of thousand lies
In to desperation they fall and subliminal verses of unborn
Follow your path of light, with breathless solace you will die

Untrod deific thoughts of one's stygian cruel divine
Existence chained and blind, forsaken to purify
Ov, my restless blood leaks on crimson thorns I lie
Behold, the lies of ones - will be disrupted one by one

Behold the lies of ones will be disrupted one by one
Behold the lies that bind you to pray one by one

Ov this huner, for purify I have sworn
With blood I shed my divine of crown...
Here I stand on thee, shapened my eyes to see
Altars of bloodthirsty - evoke in blasphemy

Driveling unconscious flesh
In war dismantled and crashed
Naked majesty of heresy
Abandoned to be erased 

Untrod deific thoughts of one's stygian cruel divine
Existance chained and blind forsaken to purify
Ov my restless blood feeds my soil of darkened heart
Follow your path of light with breathless solace you will die
