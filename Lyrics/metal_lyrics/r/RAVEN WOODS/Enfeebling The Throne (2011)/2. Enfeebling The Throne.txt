Accomplice of leecher's horrid era will fall
Dispose to bury the foretold stories of blindfold
Vastness of your being is your decaden catacombs
Worms of my plunder's mender - insanity in scream and shout
Enfeebling the throne

Retribution of the progeny unhallowed
Gathered to evince the darkened ways I have sworn
Of mist and smoke is the book of mourn
By arduous horizons of wisdom I step beyond
spawn of mine - enfeebling the throne

Disorder in well bounded exploitation
Subvert em all
Ecstasy in my veins of abomination
Crucify the soul
Let the flesh of those serpents blight
Crashed by a sign of mine
Therefore I am - enfeebling the throne

Enfeebling the throne

Emanating the mist from cup of remedy
Bringer of havoc for the great fall

Declaration for fools of belief, manifest of inner one darkened
Deafen the ears of lords, lords of praise shall fall
Congesting the souls - enfeebling! - Enfeebling the throne
