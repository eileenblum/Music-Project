Restless pale caress of death
In to faint sight of you I dwell
Of all that is to come
The rupture of life by day
My last breath for a cold embrace

Ashen soil of your merciness scarf unveils
Lays beneath my wings of grace

Of all that is to begin a life untreated mislead
My last breath of a fading trace

Withered my garden of silent harmony
Leave me in the conception of the chase
Of all that is to be left in percetion is
The great nothingness of faith

Now I am in your arms of velvet darkness
Upon the wings of mother soil
A cosmic journey I float in unconscious
Disappearing in dim light's rail

Come, give a hand to bring me up
I am already wandering in your fields
In search of broken pieces by an illusion

Dreadful hours of a decade in misery
Dalliance in malice masterpiece
Digging the holes for fall of mankind
Dreadful hours of a decade in misery

Come, give a hand to bring me up
I am already wandering in your fields
In search of broken pieces by an illusion
