Subterranean, my only will to live
of exempt human reeve
Subterranean, pneuma of darkest is
for thousands rising grim

Descent of a race harvest - intended by hands of gods
For you have misled, pray and prostrate
Spread the spawn of lies - obscure absolute rite
Subterranean rising - dismantling faults of divine

Opulence of your sermons are relic of bastard sons
Slaves of your path are victims of my darkened sun

Scorned I am, drown in to a swarm of lies
Blinded I am, confined igneous tar
Chained I am, to profane the holy one
The will I am, to erase your vile life

Upheaven - subterranean
Eclipse the myths disgrace
Rise from underground

Behold until I lay my eternal wrath!
For I am the one who come
To destroy your reckless path
Rising from underground
Behold until I lay my eternal wrath!
