Follow the raven in the mist
Flying by the wings darkened

Showing the way behind - haze
Diving in to deep woods - sharpened

Words of my waning bright
From the mask of wisdom
Are fallen in to cup of myths

Flowing through the lips of death
Grey, cold, shade on the legion of faith

Whispering the song of wrath
Demolishing the hope to fade

Surrender of heaven and hell
Licking the surface of fallen creation
Fetid breath of orisons
Venenating the veins of human existence
Follow me to the end of ways
Under the wings of mist we disappear to crash
Enemies, creation of gods putrefacted rotten flesh

Flowing thought the lips of death
Grey, cold, shade on the legion of faith

Surrender of heaven and hell
Licking the surface of fallen creation
Fetid breath of orisons
Venerating the veins of human existence
Follow me to the end of ways
Under the wings of mist we disappear to crash
Enemies, creation of gods putrefacted rotten flesh
