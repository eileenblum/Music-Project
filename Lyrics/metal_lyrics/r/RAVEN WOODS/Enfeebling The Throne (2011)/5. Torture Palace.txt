Run, cowards of feeble race, reptiles of hypocrites
Taste the whethen reap of my merciless death
Run, until you comprehend, your dead end is my bloodbath

Come, brazen disguise is your shameful ways to ruin
Cutthroat my hands are, dismantling your sins

You shall suffer, crippled and herded
Your pathetic existence shall suffer
Perished inside demolished sacred
Vanished in the mires of faith
Disavowed to retaliate

You shall suffer, drown by odious worms of dread
Your descent of existence shall suffer
Lepered by the pale caress of death

Dawn fades on the shores of unknown
In to purified insanity I have born
Veils on my dim of light are my burning wings of scorn
Enshrined ways of tortured palace
Are my thirsty veins of defiance

And the joy on desert of silence

Provokes burden hunger for blood of the clawn
My tortuous ways will subvert your preserved infirm crown
Come, my pleasured divine of clamours torture palace
We serve the overdrawn pain and you shall suffer

Dawn fades on the shores of unknown
In to purified insanity I have born
Veils on my dim of light are my burning wings of scorn
On enshrined ways of tortured palace
