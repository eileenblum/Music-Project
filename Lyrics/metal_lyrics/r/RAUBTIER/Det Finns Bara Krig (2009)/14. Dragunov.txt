[Bonus Track]Priviet motherfuckers I am Vladimir,
I belive in mother Russia and I persevere.
I was a Spetsnaz in the red army
and there was no better killer than me
But the Glasnost came and I lost my job,
and became a hitman for the russian mob
I shot and killed both pimps and tsars for Vodka, guns and kaviar.

Dragunov and Stolichnaya,
Smirnoff and Kalashnikov

I freelanced until 94 as a volunteer in the Balkan war
and then went home to Stalingrad for cars and women, ruble and blood.
So if you live in constant fear
just call and ask for ... Vladimir.
I do the business someone dies,
nastarov'je and goodbye!

Dragunov and Stolichnaya,
Smirnoff and Kalashnikov
