37 cents
No fucken sense in my head
Gotta find a way to get money

But don't wanna wind up fuckin' dead
Gonna punish some fucken fool
Because of my sick demented head

Incarcerated
Incarcerated
Incarcerated
Incarcerated

I found an easy way to get cash
With 20 stab wounds to his back
I pushed it in and I ripped it out

And I grabbed the fuckin' sack
I'm a long haired fuckin' freak
And I don't resent a thing

Cops are after me
And I really don't give a fuck
Because of pre-meditated murder
I ran out of motherfuckin' luck
