Common knowledge
Should be to see
The life around us
That there must be

There's gotta be
A better place
With all the light
In outer space

Boundaries unknown
Boundaries unknown

Why hide so much
They are misleading
I'm disappointed
In our mistreating

The shit they tell us
Is untrue
And covered up
From me and you

Boundaries unknown
Boundaries unknown

You look into the stars and they seem so far away
We should be much closer than we are today
Look at all the people with warped train of thought
Erasing the ideas for why others fought
I try to talk to people that all think the same
Our world is so barberic, that I speak in vain
Will all of our advancement go down the drain?
We are still so primitive and who is to blame?

In this universe, we're nothing but a dot
If we were gone tomorrow, we'd be easily forgot
Look at our surroundings, there isn't a fuckin' lot
Here is what we're lacking, we're rooted to this earth
With people's fuckin' blindness since the time of
birth
Don't let no one tell you to follow their religion
Compose your own theories, and make your own
decisions!

Endless span
Of possibility
In the outskirts
Of infinity

Develop your mind
Or be deprived
Of countless wonders
The rest of your life

Boundaries unknown
