Feel as if I'm wasting my time
You tell me your problems but don't listen to mine
This happens to me all the time
Being just friends isn't worth a dime

This happens to me again and again
Unless we have sex, you know we can
You tell me you love me, but just as a brother
I'm sick of this shit, so why even bother

Why must a girl fuck with a guy's head
And make him feel like he'd rather be dead
You'll fill my head with lies and truth
And we're just friends because of you

Just friends such a waste
Just friends show my haste
Just friends this really sucks
Just friends why can't we fuck?

Just friends such a waste
Just friends show my haste
Just friends this really sucks
Just friends why can't we fuck?

Just friends such a waste

You think we'd be the best of friends
Because our friendship should never end
I've heard the same shit over and over
My pride was high, but now it's lower
