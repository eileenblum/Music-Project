Rushed and pressed for time
Dreading to carry on

Tension blocks your path
Holding yourself back

Trying to cope
You're so closed-in
Corroded

When the smoke clears
Your outside world
Decomposing

Trying to think
All your thoughts
Are static

Imposing a threat
Out of control
You're frantic

Will you crack under pressure?
Will you crack under pressure?
Will you crack under pressure?
Will you crack under pressure?

Driven to your limit
Failing means you're finished

Problems lead to stalling
In the bottomless pit you're falling

Trying to cope
You're so closed-in
Corroding

Imposing a threat
Out of control
You're frantic

Will you crack under pressure?
Will you crack under pressure?
Will you crack under pressure?
Will you crack under pressure?
