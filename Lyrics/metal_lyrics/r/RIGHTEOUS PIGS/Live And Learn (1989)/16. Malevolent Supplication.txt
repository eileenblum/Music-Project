I hate you and hate me
I never liked you and I never will
I hope you die, I hope you die
I hope you feel pain, I hope you cry

No one understands why I hate you so bad

Showing ill will
Showing ill will
Showing ill will
Showing ill will

I hope you die a painful death
I know it's soon I'll hold my breath
Your attitude is pathetic
You never should have been

Showing ill will
Showing ill will
Showing ill will
Showing ill will
