Freeways bend like rubberbands
Buildings crumble turn to sand
From the ocean tidal waves
Millions killed, thousands saved

Knew about it 1000 years
Thought about it drank some beers
California was real close
Now Las Vegas is the coast

Dormant catastrophe
People are too dumb to see
It can happen any fuckin' day
California floats away...
