I'm the black fuckin' lord
And I am the king
The king of this castle
And this castle is this world

The whole fuckin' world
Is my playground
I can do as I wish
And do what I want

In a circular motion I walk
Laughing hysterically
Everyday I'm dying
With junk in my veins
Everybody says
I'm a penny waiting for change

Overdose
Overdose
Overdose
Overdose

I fuckin' think
Every man is
His own fuckin' god
So choose your death

The sight of your
Motionless, bloody body
With tracks on your arm
Is how you will die

Take my fuckin' word
I see it every day
A junkie is a man
Who will just fade away

In a circular motion I walk
Laughing hysterically
Everyday I'm dying
With junk in my veins
Everybody says
I'm a penny waiting for change

Overdose
Overdose
Overdose
Overdose
