Open wound
Bleeding trench
Victim of explosion
Suffering in pain lying frozen

Aching, throbbing, burning
Swelling, straining, hemmoraging
Crippling, piercing, stinging
Severe, intense-agonizing pain
You lie in your bed with your fractured skull
Pins and needles in your head
Your life is dull
Metal shaving planted deep inside your gut
Swollen gash, your flesh is raw, your throat is cut

Your body spasms
Your face is charred
Your lungs are punctured
For life you are scarred

Your skin is blistered
You're badly bruised
Your legs are twisted
The ones you once used
