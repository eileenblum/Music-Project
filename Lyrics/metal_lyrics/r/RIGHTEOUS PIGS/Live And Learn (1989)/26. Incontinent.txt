Middle aged man at 42
When you were younger
You snorted cake and freebased too
Didn't think what you were doing to your heart
Now it's over time to depart

You get high blood pressure
You're in your bed
Heart is weak soon you'll be dead
Your heart gives out it's such a strain
I'm glad you're dead and you felt fuckin' pain

Your wife wakes up and she is trippin'
Her ass and legs are drippin'
Piss shoots out there's no control
Shit oozes of your asshole
Urine comes of your fuckin' schlong
This is the real smell of death

You get high blood pressure
You're in your bed
Heart is weak soon you'll be dead
Your heart gives out it's such a strain
I'm glad you're dead and you felt fuckin' pain
Your wife wakes up and she is trippin'
Her ass and legs are drippin'
Piss shoots out there's no control
Shit oozes of your asshole
Urine comes of your fuckin' schlong
This is the real smell of death
