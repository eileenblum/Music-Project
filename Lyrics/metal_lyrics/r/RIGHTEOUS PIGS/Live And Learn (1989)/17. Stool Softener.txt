Doc prescribes me Tylenol Three
Because I fell and hurt my knee
I've been taken them a fuckin' week
Since then I've taken many leaks

Inside my stomach I feel a lump
I want to take a shit from my rump
I lie here and I'm constipated
Last time I shit is now outdated

Here I sit broken hearted
I tried to shit but I only farted
I miss the fuckin' burning sensation
But all I feel is constipation

I need to take some fuckin' Ex-Lax
Or become incontinent so my bowels relax
My fuckin' shit is hard as wood
I'd try to shit if I knew I could
