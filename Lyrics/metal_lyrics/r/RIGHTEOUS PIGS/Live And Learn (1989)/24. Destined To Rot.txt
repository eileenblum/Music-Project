When you see a hearse go by
You know you're about the next to die
They put you in a dirty white sheet
And bury you under six feet deep
Everything goes well about a week
Until your coffin starts to leak
Your teeth fall in your eyes fall out
Ants play pinochle on your goul (sp?)
Everything goes well so it may seem
Until your eyes turn slimy green
And pus comes out like whipping cream
You slap it on a piece of bread
That's what you eat when you're fuckin' dead

Destined to rot
Destined to rot
Destined to rot

When you see a hearse go by
You know you're about the next to die
They put you in a dirty white sheet
And bury you under six feet deep
Everything goes well about a week
Until your coffin starts to leak
Your teeth fall in your eyes fall out
Ants play pinochle on your goul
Everything goes well so it may seem
Until your eyes turn slimy green
And pus comes out like whipping cream
You slap it on a piece of bread
That's what you eat when you're fuckin' dead
