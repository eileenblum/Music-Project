Misery is yours
As you're sickened and stressed
You're feeble and you're weak
You suffer once again

You lie sick and tormented
Depression runs your life
The pain is so extensive
You want to self destruct

Weak and neglected
Poison infested
Broken down, pale and fraid
Your body functions fail

Helpless and confined
You are left behind
Your healthiness declines
Showing cancer signs

Helpless and confined
You are left behind
Your healthiness declines
Showing cancer signs

Weak and neglected
Poison infested
Broken down, pale and fraid
Your body functions fail
