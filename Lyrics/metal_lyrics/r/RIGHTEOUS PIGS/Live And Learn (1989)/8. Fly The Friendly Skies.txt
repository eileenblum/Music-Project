Mangled and disfigured
Scorched and water soaked

Ruined, wrecked and ravished
Crumpled burnt and shattered

Bent out of proportion
Crushed into contortion
Smashed and left in pieces
Nothing left intact

Casualty affects the human race
Air travel turns to a disgrace

Fly the friendly skies
Gruesome way to die
With the ground collide

Down the bodies come
Loss of our loved ones
Survivors there are none

On a hijacked plane
Dead if you complain
Bullet in your brain

30.000 feet
Thrown out with your seat
Soon the ground you greet

Casualty affects the human race
Air travel turns to a disgrace

Fly the friendly skies
Gruesome way to die
With the ground collide

Down the bodies come
Loss of our loved ones
Survivors there are none

Go through their wallets
We don't give a shit
Lets find the luggage
