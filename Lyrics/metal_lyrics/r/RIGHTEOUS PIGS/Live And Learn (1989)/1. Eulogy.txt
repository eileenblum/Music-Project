We are gathered here today
To mourn and share our grief

Confused and bitter, filled with guilt
Mental anguish beyond belief

Eulogy
Eulogy

Body filled with emptiness
Altogether hopelessness
He will rest on now forever
Life was taken from his severed-head

Requiem

And now in mourning
Resntment meets regret
Discomforting

We blame ourselves
With self disgust

Overcome our loss
We know we must
