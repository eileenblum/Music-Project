6 years in a hole
Caged up like a fuckin' rat
Prisoner under criminal law
There ain't no turning fuckin' back

Punish you for what you've done
You better run for shelter
Wrathful thinking has begun
It's time for helter-skelter

Subliminal messages put into my brain
And crammed into my head
I catch a rush inflicting pain
So savagely yet so quietly
I've drained the life from this wounded creature
Carressing her body so violently

Reassuring myself I gouged the baby
From Sharons bleeding womb
Poor Sharon Tate and unborn child
Forever to be entombed...
