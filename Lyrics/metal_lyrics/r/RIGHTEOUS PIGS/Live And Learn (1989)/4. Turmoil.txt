Crisis among the people
Directed towards removal

Public is infuriated
Their rights have now been violated

Uproar 
Rage
And fury

Survive
A violent
Frenzy

Thousands
Riot
In turmoil
Tired
Of being
Fuckin' loyal

Our army is overpowering
Bombardment is showering

Collision conquered triumph
Your laws are null and void
