Waiting for someone who steal all my fears
Or someone who fade my diseases
All of the wisdom I had through the years
Is not supposed to be real

I heard something whispering my ears
And heard that someone's calling me
I saw a little child on me
And I prayed 'cause fear is my agony
Crazy screams in the middle of the night
And shadows dancing on my bed
I'm trying to scream or make a noise
But noone can help me anymore

All the time they are trying to put us in a cradle of fears
Many things are not yet said and the truth will disappear

You are waiting a reborned Lord, and you don't know the truth
Everyone has Satan and God but they are laying inside of us

It's a lie
