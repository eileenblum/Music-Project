You want to see, the evil face
Look at yourself in a mirror, and tell me what's going on
Can you feel the flames? Running through your veins
Can you hear the broken glass screaming inside your head?

You, know mw well, and make me fall again
Agony that screams inside, I feel that I'll burn in hell
I've been riding and dying, living behind snake eyes
All these nights I could feel, that the devil is laying beside me

Show me the proof, of existence, of compassion and pain
Humanity sins are heavier than three days of resurrect(ion)
And i'm just a mortal soul, trying to understand your strange cause
Of war, of sorrow, of pain, of screams in vain..


Now I'm feeling insane, wake someone, whoever you are!
Pleave wake me someone and saveme from the dark!
Can you feel the flames? Running through your veins
Can you hear the broken glass screaming inside your head?

Hell's gates, open again
Are you prepared? To fall into the flames
World's sins, right now they all rebirth
Inside your heart and inside your mind

Remember, religions and faith are both drugs inside human minds
That makes them feel as an evil thing

They still point fingers at you
To keep hidding the truth
They still breake the rules
To make a war in the name of God...

They made a war in the name of God?
