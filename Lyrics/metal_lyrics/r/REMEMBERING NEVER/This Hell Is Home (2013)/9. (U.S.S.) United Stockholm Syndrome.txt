From the cradle to enslaved.
Selling false hopes.
We're now numbers, not names.
Terror is waiting right outside your door.
Safety is no longer optional.
Security vanquished.
Trapped on this island of prisoners.
Asylum- patrons smiling.
And waving their flags.
A nation that celebrates lethargic rats.
Breeding dependent vermin.
A parasite devoid of free thinking.
A social disease predetermined.
There are no conspiracies found.
Bombs were to ensure the buildings hit ground.
They sold you a reason for war.
Don't question the terrorist behind the white house door.
There is a reason the KKK turned into cops.
Every president deserves to be shot.
Populate prisons, impoverished choke.
Force our own hands to slit our own throats.
Enabler.
Clutch your keepsakes.
Spit hollow rhetoric.
They won't keep their eyes off of you.
Moving target.
Dead man walking.
Home is not here.
Itâs only a matter of time before they come for you.
Demon comes shiny new and smiling.
Suit/Tie.
Saying everything you want to hear.
You will know true fear and suffering.
