The wolves stare us down.
As if they hold precedence.
Their tongues and their teeth hold human prey as their residents.
Selling faith to the brainless.
An institute born of horseshit but weightless.
Denial isn't faceless.
Your victory is tasteless.
Pages plagiarized word for word.
You're not listening.
Every day I wake up I'm at war with God.
Absolve.
The wolves stare us down.
As if they're respectable.
Their tongues will never lead me home.
A lamb to the slaughtering.
Hold your lord.
Fooled by parables.
A feeble flock of parasites.
It's like you're waiting to die.
Pray to no white Jesus up in the sky.
Burn more.
