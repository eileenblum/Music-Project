A prisoner in your own skin.
Being born was the only ture sin.
Forcefed a bible.
And treated like a second class citizen.
A system instituted to ensure perpetual opperssion.
Equal rights have always been a selective fabrication.
Neutralize any threat to establishment.
Jim Crow may be dead but his Big Brother has never been more apparent.
A warzone they created with corrupt pigs.
Harassment and violence.
Assassination of JFK, Black Panthers and Malcolm X.
Four hundred year old lie.
Forced to accept this plight.
Crowded into poverty stricken conditions of living.
A concrete jungle with no escaping.
A race shut out of options.
No jobs.
No school.
No chance of advancing.
Imminet suicide.
Malt liquor riot.
CIA pushing the crack in.
We're run out of martyrs.
Amerika keeps gunning them down.
A single parent.
A trump charge prison.
No escape from this dead town.
This hell is home.
