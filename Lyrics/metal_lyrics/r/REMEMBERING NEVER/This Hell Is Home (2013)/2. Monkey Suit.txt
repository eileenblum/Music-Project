Punch the clock of my forty hour suicide.
These four walls torment me slowly.
Blinding me insane, sterile white.
Green eyed, white devil.
I'd spit in your face if you'd come to my level.
Unappreciative piece of shit, begging to be the next sucker.
Every day I'm hustling.
H-U-S-T-L-E-R
A suit dressed with a shit eating grin.
Smiles with a forked tongue, belly exploding.
This monkey suit will never define me.
I'm taking everything.
Nothing is safe in my eyes.
I've been to your house.
I know your secrets.
See you in hell.
Two weeks.
Burn motherfucker.
