Modern minds.
Modernize methods of life pacified.
So comatose, comforted so bright but barely alive.
Feed it into my veins to keep us all so sedated.
Help me improve me.
Turn my sweat into technology.
Kneel down to your material God's.
Crucified circuitry and the need to concede.
I'm so lost.
Lord, keep my numb.
I'm on my knees begging you for a new fix.
Lord, I'll sell you my soul.
Tie it off, shoot it, tomorrow I'll kick.
Feed it into my veins to keep us all so elated.
Help me improve me.
Turn my blood into technology.
Kneel down to your material God's.
Crucified circuitry and the need to concede.
I'm so lost.
Fuck time, I'll piss it all away.
I'm so lost.
Keep me distracted from the horror.
Help me improve me.
Turn my tears into technology.
Keep me warm.
