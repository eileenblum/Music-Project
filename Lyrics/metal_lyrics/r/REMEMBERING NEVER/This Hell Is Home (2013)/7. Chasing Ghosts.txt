From one mouth to the other.
We spit through the smiles on our faces.
A regret for every day break.
A body in It's final resting place.
We stay tied to our last words.
Each other through bitter prideful lips.
Our words carry stones.
Colliding bodies sinking in the undertow.
Our jaws shouted the words we never meant to say.
Spite infects the translation.
Slipping through the noose, shouting obscenities.
Damage done is irreversible once we're lowered in the dirt.
Chasing ghosts to the ends of the earth.
Misery is the river of the world.
Everybody row.
