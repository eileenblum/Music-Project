Sink or swim, abandon is closing in.
The bottom is a lonely place for fatherless children.
Not a day goes by I don't think of you.
Beloved pale horse.
Breathing down my neck, It's inevitable.
Not time for love, no time for pain.
We won't get through this together.
Things are going to get worse before they get better.
Never said "not a day goes by I don't think of you, son."
Trudging forward when everyone else has run.
Dragged through the mud.
This won't be my swan song.
No time for love.
This won't be my swan song.
Suffer, survive.
This won't be my swan song.
Marginalized.
This won't be my swan song.
