No love can satisfy this selfishness.
No companion can comfort me.
Attachment I detest.
We would love to think we have our shit together.
But you need people and I need results.
Your hell is solitude.
My hell is other people and their intentions.
Humans are fleeting and faulting at most.
Friends are disposable.
Acquaintances are as good as ghosts.
You are the means to justify the end.
Disassociate- no attachment ever again.
Rely on nothing/no one.
No one will help you get out alive.
Everyone will watch us fall by the wayside.
Love will only anchor your feet.
Compassion and attachment are left for the weak.
Love will only anchor your feet.
Compassion and attachment weâll leave for the weak.
