Dead set on indoctrination.
A cancer to morality.
Intelligence waning below the bottom.
A glorified cult.
Lead with open arms to the end of the world.
A false authority.
Stories press on from translation to translation.
Your natural world isnât so natural.
Your self importance is unnerving.
Pray as you will.
Embarrassed to admit that no one is looking out for you.
Everyone has a God for sale.
Model your morals to remain in check.
With out God's eyes watching.
Youâd be wild monkeys slinging each others shit.
Your faith means nothing more.
Than justification for believing the impossible.
The greatest enemy you have is yourself.
Dead set on indoctrination.
A cancer to morality.
How much are you willing to sell yourself for?
