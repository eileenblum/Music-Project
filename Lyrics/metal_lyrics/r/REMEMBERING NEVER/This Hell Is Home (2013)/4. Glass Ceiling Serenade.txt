I refuse to apologize for a lack of sympathy.
Your world is burning but you gladly warm your hands in the flames.
The facts are driven into your eyes.
You've seen first hand how this ends.
The damage done.
On your knees to be prey.
There is no discipline.
There is no self control.
You'll soon know misery and it isnât dying alone.
Drink yourself stupid just to pacify the rage.
The poison in your glass.
Or the victims slaughtered and served on your dinner plate.
Keep the couch company.
Glued to a screen.
Growing fatter and fatter.
Keep spooning your fat face.
The abandoned children of the red white and blue machine.
They left you stupid and hungry but they keep that glass ceiling clean.
Save yourself from this hell you made.
A regimen with no discipline is destined for failure
Your entitlement is sickening.
Blind eye shuts out reason.
You're a hamster on a wheel.
Bury your face in social distraction.
Sip your coffee.
Nothing is happening.
Your God's set you up just to hit the ground.
Time and time again all you have faith in is proven wrong.
