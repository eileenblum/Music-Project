Parade in bright lights
I wish you were holding my breath
Tonite is perfect for bloodletting
But I'm alone again
It looks like christmas time
Bite my lip and tears fill my
I'll carry on, I'm better off living without you
No one to pull me under, this time I'm pulling through
Everything beautiful dies
So I kiss it goodbye
Sever my life from yours
The parade comes to town
Everybody gather around
I love the way you smile in the nite.
