They're out for blood and they won't rest until aspiration is dead
Abandon fear to change
Sever concern for the way you're looked upon
Swallow all your shallow pride and decide
Never look back, never, never, never again
Pressed between the boundaries of ridicule
So inadequacy cannot be seen
Be strong, be cold, indifferent
Be bold, be daring
Never looking back
Take my hand and dive in head first into concrete
Throw your fists and bite your tongue
As I drown you in the water that I let you to
I'll sever the ties that lead to lies alone
And I'm never looking back for you
I want my words to shatter your former life
I want my words to open your saddened eyes
