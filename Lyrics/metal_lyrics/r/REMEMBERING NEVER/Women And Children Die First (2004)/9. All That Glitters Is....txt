These are the days
The days we speak with serpent tongues
These days we fall through the ice and drown
As you have done this time
The water fills your lungs and you suffocate (once more)
Suffocate tragically
Bleed for me
There is no forgiveness
There is no second chance
Destroy my opinion of you and your self-worth
With just one single word (no)
