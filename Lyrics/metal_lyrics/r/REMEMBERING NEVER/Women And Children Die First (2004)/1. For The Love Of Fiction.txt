The lies are hard to spread thin
But it's so easy to control
Weakness is your savior,
But there's nothing left to save
This is family tradition pass on in fear
Unconditional love for a fuckin' stranger?
Nails driven in me, for I have sinned
Your ambition bleeds on a cross
Security bleeds on a cross
Your hope bleeds on a cross
Your life bleeds on a cross
I'd kill for nothing, you'll die for anything
Easier said than done, so easy to take the fall
A scapegoat for all your insecurities
Excuse me;a hero;a man made god;
For all your insecurities
Walk that sunday tightrope
When the safety net fails who will you follow?
Another sheep has fallen 
Bleed your choices made, with security in mind
A scapegoat for all your insecurities
Excuse me;a hero;a man made god;
For all your insecurities
And when the last savior is destroyed
I'll dust myself off and just walk away
As you've taught me, as you've tought us all
A prayer for the dying, a prayer for you
The hopeless
