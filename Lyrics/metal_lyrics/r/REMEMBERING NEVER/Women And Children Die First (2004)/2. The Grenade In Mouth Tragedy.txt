This is an exaggeration of your mortality
This is an exaggeration of your morality
This is an exaggeration of you
Confines of tradition reject and disregard
The realization of a better way to simulate
To oppose the suffering
We can burn this bridge together
Learn to unlearn
All the harshness and bloodshed that consumes you
That consumes the earth
The torture that which ensues
Regret your death cycle that imprisons you
Spit back lies that segregate the truth for what it's worth
Only words won't kill your violent perspective violence,
Murdering everything that seems inferior
Your dissection is a small price to pay for a lifetime of ignorance
Tomorrow is just the beginning we'll burn this motherfucker down
Tomorrow we start again
We'll leave a path of human flesh as a sign of a better way
Vengeance now
We'll leave a path of human flesh as a sign of a better way
For a better day
