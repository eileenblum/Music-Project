The glutton feeds off you and I
Wasting my air
Blind and ignorant of his guilt and intention
unintelligent decisions you make
Realize they not only effect you
It will take a million truths to remove one brick
From the wall you have built around yourself again
Your false pride disgusts me, piggy
Fooled by neanderthal's lies
This tradition ruins your life
This will ruin you
Coward of cowards
Glutton of gluttons
Kill yourself
Glutton=consumer
It will take a million truths to remove one brick
From the wall you have built around yourself again
You and I take a life
