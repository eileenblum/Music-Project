and i can still smell you on my sheet 
and now i know what it feels like to be crushed 
and now i know what it feels like to be a novelty 
and now i know what it feels like to be drowned 
by someone you love 
its all over but im still choking on the lies [x2]
how can we go on living line after line 
i can only stich myself up so many times 
how can all this have happened in less than a day 
then again it wouldnt have been the first time you threw us all away 
i've waited so long for someone like you 
to fill my days with ruin 
every smile is a painful reminder 
of how i let you continue 
all the tears in the world could never stop 
all the heartbreaking wreckage 
you did that 
i love that i cant get enough but i'd be lying if i said that i didn't expect it 
you've past me twice but our eyes haven't met again 
you turned my world into remnants of blood in my sink 
will you pick up the pieces again? 
or let them fall to ashes in yor pretty hands again 
you walk all over me 
it's all over but im still choking on the lies 
you walk all over me 
the pain ensues 
knives can only go so deep 
you have penetrated the hardest heart 
and now i cant help but to return the favor
