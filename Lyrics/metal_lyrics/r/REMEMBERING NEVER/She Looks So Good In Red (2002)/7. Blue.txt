bat your eyes 1000 times 
ive dreamed of touching your face 
i never thought it could be this good 
ill never forget you 
not in a million years 
something about how good you look underwater 
like the dream ive had 
since you looked the other way 
but now you can only look up cant you? 
my angel 
you look so scared 
a few more bubbles 
a little more effort 
and you'll be home 
its only water i promise 
so you think they'll miss you 
say how they once touched your hair 
besides to brush the mud out 
how beautiful you are 
atleaste till they find you 
you'll always remember my wavy face 
and ill always remember that lovely shade of blue you wore that night 
that tag on your toe says " I love you " 
I loved you 
something about how good you look 
under the water
