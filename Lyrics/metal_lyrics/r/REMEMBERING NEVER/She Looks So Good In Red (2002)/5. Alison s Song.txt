I'd love to drown you in a sea of your own blood 
kisses to me and watch you choke on it 
how many songs do you wish to be written about you? 
this isn't the first and it wont be the last baby 
how well you fake a smile and some tears to match 
you wanted everything and more 
everything is ruined 
when i have you again 
your're mouth gets sewn up forever 
i'll never let you go 
Mrs. hardcore fashion show 
kiss your drama queen days good-bye 
those days are so long gone and this day so are you 
this is the last night your neck is not serrated 
this charade is getting older than suicide attempts 
say you love me 
say you love me and write it in your blood 
and you know what 
say it again 
se how fast your chest collapses 
we are all the lucky ones 
and i'll decorate myself with your insides 
and i can wear your face as a mask 
dont cry 
you just got what you wanted 
how cool you look now 
how much better would you look with your heart lodged 
inside the brand new cut in your throat 
your body is as blue as your hair
