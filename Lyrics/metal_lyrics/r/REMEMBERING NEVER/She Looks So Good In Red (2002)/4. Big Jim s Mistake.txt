lie awake 
things will be better the moment you cant wake up 
by the way 
when did you realize we're better off without you 
you'r lying tongue cant spit filth now 
my how the weather changes 
hiding your knives behind your back 
to strategically place them in mine 
when you get home...we are now severed 
the glass has been broken for the last time 
pulling your tongue til it rips from your face 
you've always been ugly but not as nauseating as you look now 
i hope you slit your fucking wrists to save me the effort of writing your suicide note 
your inspiration world of lies 
i see your failure in my eyes 
tears burn an open wound 
burn away the memories of you 
tip toeing to avoid your selfish sob story 
after everything we've been through 
we've got to crawl...crawl back on our knees 
you left with everything you ever wanted 
you left us and now you get two thumbs up 
you're gettin two thumbs up 
you get an F for effort 
no more sunday migraines 
your eyes will forever sulk with all you've burned down 
you think your're so cool now 
cause she left you now 
and left you crying to yourslef 
and i cant help but laugh because you brought this on yourself again 
in this clip theres 13 ways to say your're sorry 
well there's nothing you can say to repair all the damage you have made 
all in all you'll never follow through with it 
won't you share your revelations 
your're ugly and no one likes you
