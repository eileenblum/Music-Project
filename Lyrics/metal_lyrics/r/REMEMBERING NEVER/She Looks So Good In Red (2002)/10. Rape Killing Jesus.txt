I will never sleep again until i rest in pieces 
i place the blame solely on your hands 
for no reason or a purpose 
i'm plagued with endless callousness 
just one sacrifice can't justify the raping of my life 
you've cut my wrists 
you've done the dirty work for me 
you've taken it all 
you've taken everything 
my tears have burned cleen 
dry and sear holes in my flesh 
i want to leave this place 
i have nothing left 
cut my throat one thousand times 
to be with her once more 
when all was said and done 
you killed two birds with one stone 
no omore perfect memories 
no more fucking tears 
no more memories 
my own tears will be thoughts of you and your perfection 
the sound of her voice is comfort to my ears 
i've got one bullet and the barrel aimed at your heart 
i'm killing you like you've killed me 
cut my throat one thousand times 
empty salt through your hands 
to make you feel like me 
my last wish 
to see your dead fucking body
