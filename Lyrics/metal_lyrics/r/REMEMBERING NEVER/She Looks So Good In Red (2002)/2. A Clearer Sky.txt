weights bear down pulling me under 
i look around 
shadows are staring at me laughing at me 
letting me know where i stand 
air is taken away from my lungs 
from emotions that form quite slow 
and the pit of darkness consumens my every way 
im scared but trembling keeps me sane 
where along the path did i take so many wrong turns 
how did i end up face down crying letting pillows catch my tears? 
how did i even build up a tolderance to deal with this? 
depression is something i dont miss 
can i keep from falling into deeper parts of this hell on earth 
exposing my true colors to the world withering from these wrists 
now the air has gone cold and lifeless 
someone had put thier hand on my head 
the sensation i'm feeling is real 
cant explain the new way that i feel 
so refreshed i could conqure the world 
pack my bags cause i'm through with with this girl 
show me heaven im through with this hell 
and to think i would die for no reason at all 
stressing because of you 
now im leaving good-bye 
the grey sky has gone blue 
this time i'll remain true...to myself 
for the longest time i was lost willing to kill the pain at any cost 
pushing me relentlessly to the edge of it all 
now my feet are touching the ground 
the doors have opened wider and i can see you at a distance 
you're weeping [x2]
i cant see you 
i guess i could care 
ask you whats wrong 
but i wont 
ill let you wither in your place from the look on your face...you seee a clearer sky 
cause we're through with all of this 
ive had enough , enough of you 
ive had enough of this 
tearing down these walls that block my progression 
this poison we brew called love 
broken hearts - broken neck
