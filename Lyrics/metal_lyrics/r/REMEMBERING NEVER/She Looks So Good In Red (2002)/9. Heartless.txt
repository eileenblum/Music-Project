to swallow my pridewould be too easy 
but i need your magnifying glass heart to find the ounce of respect i once had for myself 
after turning my days and nights to ruin 
i should cut your throat like the rope that tied my hands 
well whose hands are tied up now 
whose hands 
knowing your breathing 
everyting we had then 
the very thought of you 
makes me want to cut my fucking throat 
die forever 
ill never step out of this room til the sun goes down for the last time 
i cant look into your beautiful eyes again 
i thik i'll stay where the movies are bad and the endings are long and drown you out 
your face cuts so easily 
too late to take back the heartless words you said to me 
things that brought us together now tearing us apart 
i'm removing the life from you which you so call a heart 
i wait anticipating the moment you choke on every word
