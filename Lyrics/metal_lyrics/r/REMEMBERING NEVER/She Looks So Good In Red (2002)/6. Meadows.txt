i pictured a place that is and always will be heaven 
to the eyes ears nose and mouth 
but most of all my dying heart can soothe and regain its love and affection for all 
but especially you 
there's a special place knowing no end 
to me myslef and whatever i become 
this thing inside that ticks away 
ticks slower with each comming day 
but this place reminds me i am loved but not wanted here 
eyes sulk with the burden of never-ending tears 
i am loved but not wanted here 
pain is only the beggining which binds us all together 
the meadows somewhere will appear and everything will be all right 
will be all right 
i am loved but not wanted here 
eyes sulk with the burden of never-ending tears 
this place reminds me 
it reminds me there's a special place knowing no end 
to me myslef and whatever i become 
this thing inside that ticks away 
ticks away slower with each comming day 
this place reminds i am loved but not wanted here 
eyes sulk with the burden of never-ending tears 
i am loved but not wanted here 
you are not loved or wanted here
