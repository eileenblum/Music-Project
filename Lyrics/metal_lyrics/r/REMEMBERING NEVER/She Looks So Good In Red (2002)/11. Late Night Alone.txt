you got me up all night hating myself 
and everything is not going to be ok 
you got me up all night hating you much more 
and i cant help but throw us away 
these are the last words i scribble down 
my last chance to hurt you once more 
when i turn to you 
you couldnt recall my name 
you got me up all night cutting away myself 
and its getting better 
your words have become my poison to help me through every step of the way
