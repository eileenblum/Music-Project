eyes like an angel 
blood runs like a whore 
you put your hands on my chest to push yourslef 
oh so higher never looking back on the holes you left 
no matter how many big words that you use 
i have something for you 
under my bed and i'm playing our song 
its not enough to feel you from the inside 
i want to see it 
the halo on your head was held on by horns 
you'll never see me comming 
now you might as well do it yourslef 
you've tried before a thousand times 
im sure you could try just once for me, will you please? 
i know you're scared and you should be 
kind of like the words you said 
the night you decided you were too good for me 
in a world where friends means enemies 
and love means murder 
your last breath will fog my knife 
you told me everything but the truth 
but why should you change for me or anyone 
they know the likes that come from that gap 
what i wouldn't do to taste your blood
