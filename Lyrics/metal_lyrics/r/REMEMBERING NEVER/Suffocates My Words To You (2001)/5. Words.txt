Last night I dreamt of you, things were going so damn great.
Now I question ethics when the bad things in life are supposed to educate.
Those words were more than just break up words.
They ran too deep.
To end my life... the idea runs through my head.
But the consequence conflicts with how you care.
Couldn't matter at all if they found my dead.
Either way it ends it won't be fair.
Your words were more than just your careless words.
They ran too deep.
They pierced my heart.
I thought I could have died.
