Side by side can we see together if not forever.
Loneliness is a compound word to me.
Are we sharing this thought?
Do you miss me as much as I miss you?
As I look in the mirror I see you and I fading.
Maybe fading but I am still waiting.
Time is supposed to heal but I hate hours compared to days.
Without you time just flows slower because it is the issues that matter in the end.
Time is supposed to heal so why does it still hurt?
Why does it hurt?

Thus far I have had the time of my life.
Thank God I recall our difference and we all fall down.
You know I will be there for you.
