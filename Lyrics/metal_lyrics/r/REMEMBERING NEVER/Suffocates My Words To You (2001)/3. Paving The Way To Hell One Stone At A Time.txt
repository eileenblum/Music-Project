Where is your heart?
Where is your soul?
Hide temporary blindness, hidden from your lies.
You can run, waste away, waste away.
You can run, waste away.
Hunt you down.
Looking in the barrel of a gun you can see your face, your demon smiling.
I can't rub off the number written on your wrist.
There is no choice now, your ignorance has brought you this.
You can't lie now.
Arms reaching up they grab your ankles,
pull with force that will pull you down.
Down where your skin will burn, pull you down to hell.
