You only heard what you wanted to hear
Watch me do my little fucking dance for your critique
You are nothing
You have no heart
Is there nothing left to fight for?
Your voice was silent from the start
Do you know why you're here?
Your mouth moves before your ears
Why are you so afaid of being wrong?
I called you out every nite this week
You never showed
I am sorry I gave you something to think about
I'm so sorry you are easily led to the crowd
A pity party fit for one by one by one
My simple words count the tears to every pull of the trigger
We all kneel down
Give you praise
The come of my new/nu judge
A blueprint to assassinate the new messiah
Applaud
Applaud
Encore
You only heard what you wanted to hear
Watch me do my little fucking dance for your critique
You are nothing
You have no heart
You're just another faceless name
Another show in the dark
You don't know a fucking thing
You're full of shit and apathy
Why are you so afraid to open your eyes?
I called you out every nite this week
You never showed
I am sorry I gave you something to think about
I'm so sorry you are easily led to the crowd
Cry baby, cry
