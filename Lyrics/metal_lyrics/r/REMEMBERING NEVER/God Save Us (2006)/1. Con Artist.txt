A coundrel in sheep's wool is still a scoundrel as in the case we see here today
You wanted us to be by your side
The guilt you carry wil not ensure you place in heaven
You never wanted us to be independent
Holding on to every word by a thread of false hope
I can see through the lies
The tongue of god is but a stranger in these desperate times
The arms of god discriminate in these desperate times
The tongue of god is but a stranger in these desperate times
The arms of god discriminate in these desperate times
You're selling your manipulation, I'm not buying
You're playing on the fear that you've instilled in all of us
We don't have to live like this any longer
I spit on your name and your institution
You wanted uis to be by your side
The guilt you carry will ensure your place in heaven
You never wanted us to be independent
Holding on to every word by a thread of false hope
I can see through the lies
The tongue of god is but a stranger in these desperate times
The arms of god discriminate in these desperate times
The tongue of god is but a stranger in these desperate times
The arms of god discriminate in these desperate times
Your faith is dead
We don't have to live like this
Get off your knees
