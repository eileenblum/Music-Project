I can see it in your eyes
This was never a waste of time
I have a pocket full of dirt
But in my hand a thank you note
With every beat of my heart
I wouldn't trade this for the world
I'll be sleeping with your ghost tonite
But I'm never dreaming
Fuck the marquees and the pompous lights
I'm never dreaming
Fuck the breakdowns and twelve hour drives
I'm never dreaming
I'll be sleeping with your ghost tonite
But I'm never dreaming
No
I won't lose sight
I won't dream tonite
I won't lose sight
I won't dream tonite
I can see it in your eyes
This was never a waste of time
I have a pocket full of dirt
But in my hand a thank you note
With every beat of my heart
I wouldn't trade this for the world
I'll be sleeping with your ghost tonite
