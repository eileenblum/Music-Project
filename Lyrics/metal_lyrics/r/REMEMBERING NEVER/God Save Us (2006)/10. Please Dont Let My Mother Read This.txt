From the bottom of the barrel
And I'm still here
We all would like to think that we are more important than we are
I am nothing
It's not hard to understand
I've known it all along since birth
I've never had a sense of pride
I've never had a shred of hope
Believing in myself would be the death of my sincerity
Kill the lights
Face to face with myself
I know that I am nothing
Face to face with myself
I am nothing
This isn't a cry for help
This isn't reaching out
I wonder what this life would be like without me
This isn't even close to my suicide note
