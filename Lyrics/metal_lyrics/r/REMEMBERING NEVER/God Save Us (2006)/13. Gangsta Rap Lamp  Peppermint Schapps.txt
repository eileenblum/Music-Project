This is an invitation
I am the rebirth of disease
I am the son of disaster
There is a new day at hand for us all
For us all
This is in memory of what never was
But shoul've been
We you walked away
You gave up on everything
Never forget
Never forgive
Never repeat the past
No bother praying
No one can save you from yourself
No one
There is nothing left of progress
Nothing left to morn
Everything you thought you loved has died
Love has died
God still loves us
But is nowhere to be found
Broken promises of deliverance
Truth and justice aren't an an option
No one can save what's left of yourself
Don't repent for your "sins"
No one can make birds sing again
There is nothing scared in this world?
The guilty and innocent hang me same
Deliver us
We dance on the ashes and piss on the bodies
Every building left will be adorned
With inverted crosses
Signs that say
Why, lord, have you abandoned us
Why lord, have you abandoned us?
Why, lord?
There is noting left of progress
Nothing left to mourn
Everything you thought you loved has died
Love has died
God still loves us
But is nowhere to be found
Broken promises of deliverance
Deliver us
Witness and learn
