Once thousand lifetime coulden't replace what you've given me
Cold nights of sacrifice and dedication
I love you
She moves to the best of her own drum
She moves to the sound of her own song
She is a mountain with a lion's heart
You are not a slave to past mistakes
This time you won't be taken for granted
Never again
I do not own you
You owe me nothing
You are so much more than given credit for
You deserve more than the world
So much more
You gave me everything I never knew I needed
Every nite I close my eyes I'll bless your name
She moves to the beat of her own drum
She moves to the sound of her own song
She is a mountain with a lion's heart
I do not own you
You owe me nothing
You are so much more than given credit for
YOu deserve more than the world
So much more
