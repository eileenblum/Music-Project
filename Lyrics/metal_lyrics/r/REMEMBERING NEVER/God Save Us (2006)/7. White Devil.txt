All the work and prayers burn
A waste of sweat and breath
God turns his deaf ear to me
Like I'm the one that dosent exist
I never saw my mother cry
Because she was working 5am to 9pm
Life is pulling through
We pulled through
Please don't put flowers on my casket
I'm not ready to be buried yet
I'll never see a penny from this record sale
Snatching shit off Wal Mart shelves
It's hard to eat with empty pockets
Who can explain to me why none of us have a fucking thing?
Malnutrition sinking in
Depression is reigning king
Tell me why I should not give up all hope
My prayers were never answerd
Nothing filled my empty hands
That's when I realized god either hated me
Or was a lie
All the work and prayers burn
A waste of sweat and breath
God turns his deaf ear to me
Like I'm the one that dosent exist
All the work and prayers burn
A waste of sweat and breath
No insurance
No education
No bright future
Unless I'm hanging from a camouflage rope
Life is pulling through
I'm hopeless
Please don't put flowers on my casket
I'm not ready to be buried yet
Everything I have I've stolen
Why should I compromise my freedom
Faith built on lies
You've turned on me
Fuck god
Fuck government
