Let's beat this town to the ground
A waving flag for every body laid to rest
There is nothing here to celebrate
Rely on every lie
Is paid full with their blood and their mother's tears
Let's beat this down to the ground
Out fate lies in the hands of incompetence like a child playing god
The problems never change
This is the only way for peace and prosperity
Assassination of the guilty
Judas will swing
Tied to the chair
Piss running down your legs
To black eyes and a buckket of gasoline
Shoving a pistol in the face of the enemy
To show him fear he's never known
This is justice for every soul thats been condemned
The beginning and the end
At 1600
Lets burn this house to the ground
Every dollar spent
I'll take what I can get
Take their lies to hell
The problems never change
This is the only way for peace and prosperity
Assassination of the gulity
Judas will swing
Ignite the flame
