Who knew we could be so wrong to assume
That we'd be told the truth this time
All my heros died in my eyes
In my eyes
These sins your god can't wash away
Though you know not what you do
Thou shall not kill
Thou shall not steal
Unless it benefits you
You choose to shut your eyes
You choose to walk the other way
You can put a price on life if it's selfish luxury
May your vices bring you the torture
The same they once felt
May you one day see the lives you destroy
Are your own
And you follow in denial
Choose to shut yourself off from the truth
Like moths to the flame
In total apathy and disregard of a life
Born to torture
Into this hell
Into hell
You have no respect for life
Who knew we could be so wrong to assume
That we'd be told the truth this time
All my heros died in my eyes
In my eyes
These sins your god can't wash away
Though you know not what you do
Thou shall not kill
Thou shall not steal
Unless it benefits you
Nothing dies in necessity
Nothing dies content with dying
You can put a price on life if it's selfish luxury
And you think you're not decent
Compassionate
Just sympathetic
I am foundation
I am anew
You have no respect for life
So she said that you ain't worth the air that you breathe
So she said that you ain't worth the dirt under your feet
