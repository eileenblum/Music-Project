Dig my own grave
Last in what I should accept
I'm no better than the rest
I can feel it wearing think
We were never meant to win
Letting go of yesterday is easier said than I can do
You are always haunting me
I can't explain the fear or inadequacy
In am the enemy
My enemy
Time is not on my side
I am not on my side
I come to terms with the truth
Fortune has never been a friend
So the story sadly goes this truly is the end
EWnd of the raod for all my hope
I dig my own grave
Lost in what I should accept
I'm no better tan the rest
I can feel it wearing thin
We were never meant to win
