I won't stop screaming until everyone is listening
I won't stop burning down the houses that you're sleeping in
I won't lose sleep with the blood of the world on my hands
What we're looking for is progress
What we need is something more than we've ever known
This is my letter to a dying world
What we're looking for is progress
What we need is something more
Be not afraid
I have never seen a peaceful setting sun
Just a prelude to a war and we live this outcome
Be not afraid
Be not as the past as birthed us
Slaves to their word
Won't you accept this penance from the one life you've been handed?
I can't accept this
I won't stop screaming until everyone is listening
I won't stop burning down the houses that you're sleeping in
What we're looking for is progress
What we found does not exist any longer
Our own actions will be the death of us all
Be not afraid
I have never seen a peaceful setting sun
Just a prelude to a war and we live the outcome
Be not afraid to die
