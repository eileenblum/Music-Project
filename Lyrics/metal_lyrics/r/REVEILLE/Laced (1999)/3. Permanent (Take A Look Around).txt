Rape me of my innocence
Amidst these cold and rainy days
There's so much hate beneath this sky
My inspirations all washed away
So tie me down and cut me up
And pour my blood upon the earth
No helpful hands to hold me up
And I could give a fuck for all that it's worth
Breath in, breath out, but take a closer look
Because your life is laced and now you're hooked
The hunter's become the hunted, when it rains, it pours
And instinctive push- you better lock your doors
Take a look around-tell me what you see
It's upside down, skewed permanently
Take a look around- tell me what you find
Just an empty search through a foreign kind
I'm sickened by this odious scent
Gently drifting on the breeze
A wave of lust, turning love to dust
And now we all fall to our knees
So cut me down, and turn me loose
And spill my thoughts upon the page
A hopeless attempt to redefine
Between our skyline and the seventh stage
[chorus]
Tell me what you see?
Tell me what you find?
Tell me what you feel?
Take a look around-line 'em up
It's permanent
So better check ya source
You better lock your doors
And take a closer look
Because the choice is yours
So get on or get off, give up or give in
Get on or get off, take a look around
