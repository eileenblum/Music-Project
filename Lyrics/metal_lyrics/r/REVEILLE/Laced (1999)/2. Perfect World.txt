Your money isn't power so forget the green 
Its just feeding the fuel 
What makes the world go round? 
The same thing that lights the flame to burn it down 
Its a capitol brainwash you must have avouch 
Call it your purse, more like suicide pouch 
Paper ain't a mean to pacify 
When your wisdom is in your wallet you can kiss your ass good-bye 
Rectify, this living policy is shit 
And all its lies got you choking on your own spit
The seam has split, so spit or swallow 
But your lead I'll never follow 
So you can wallow in your own chaotic world 
A puzzle pieced by our imperfections 
Close your eyes, seal your lips, walk in fear
Now do you see what I can see? can you hear what I hear?
Your fucking trophies, your sexual treasures Just hide the pain beneath your simple pleasures 
Desperate measures for desperate times 
Searching for answers it won't let you find
It seeks to bind and then steal tomorrow 
Your heart is hallow, your mind is fried 
Soul is void, flat-lines will never lie 
[chorus]
Despite your actions I will persevere 
Now do you see what I see? can you hear what I hear?
Hate, rage, greed, sin 
Ripples in the water, wrinkles in the skin 
Our own little perfect world 
A puzzle pieced by our imperfections
We see no evil, we hear no evil 
We're all just victims of a perfect world
