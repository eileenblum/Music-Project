Can't understand? guess I'll paraphrase 
And allow this spark the set the mic ablaze 
Because all my rage just builds up inside 
There's no place to run and no place to hide
Now I gotta revive, gotta resurrect 
Because we can't survive without and intellect 
Check in retrospect and what's ahead looks bleak 
So take away my name and send me up the creek 
But don't attempt to repent, you had your chance 
Now the mask is on, you're in the blind man's dance 
You gave me your word you lying hyprocrite- fuck you 
Wake up, wake up, it's your wake up call 
Now the imperious leaders of our heavens fall 
We gotta drop the ball on the gates below 
Because what you reap is what you'll sew 
We gotta let them know, gotta make them pay 
For it's the hate upon which he'll pray 
So I'm breaking away because I've figured you out
So now your number's up but don't count me out 
You had your chance, you lost your chance 
Now that I see you're in the blind man's dance 
You gave me your word you lying hypocrite- fuck you 
Gotta learn and practice what you preach 
You welcome me with warmful hands 
You build me up just to break me down 
A tear collects and forms deep within 
Now trapped inside I gladly drown 
A drop of water is turned to ice 
Your satisfaction at my expense 
Now at my timely sacrifice 
With truth upon my dying breath
Beneath your eyes lie the mind of a hyprocrite
Beneath your mind...judas
