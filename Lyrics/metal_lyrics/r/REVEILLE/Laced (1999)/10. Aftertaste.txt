These bare walls hold a familiar theme 
In this my home and happy hell 
The pain I've seen within this empty dream
Locked and barred inside myself
Caged and leashed and smothered in fear
So round and round the chamber spins 
You can sink or swim in a sea of fears 
But the walls keep closing in 
In the aftertaste 
No where to run and no where to hide
Disobey and it's the back of the fist 
Raped and tortured from the inside 
With my dignity lost in every hit 
Had to be something, I just had to be someone
But I'm overcome by my own self-doubt 
Now where's my freedom, where's my life 
Where's my god, where's my way out? 
In the aftertaste 
It's so dark inside- I can't breath inside 
I can't move inside- now fade away
