The phoenix, no longer a myth 
So strike a match and watch it burn 
Our destination's rigor mortis 
Cause nobody listens and nobody learns 
And your world rejects my kind 
And those words have lost their touch 
And this place has lost its mind
So now I wanna burn it up 
Humility, is based on trust 
But ignorance and arrogance rule the grounds
So ashes to ashes and dust to dust 
And now I wanna burn this whole-place-down
Leashed, cuffed, locked and hooked 
Blow it down, tear it down, burn it down 
Blackmail- come take it to a whole new level 
Motherfucker, I can't wait 'till I can watch you drown
And you place our trust in you 
Reassure us that we're not to blame 
But the tables turn and we're the first to burn 
Now I could never look at you the same 
[chorus]
So take your word and shove it 
Come take your deal and shove it 
Just take the lie and shove it 
I know what you really are 
The school in which we learn 
is the fire in which we'll burn 
The school in which we learn 
Is the fire in which we-will-burn
