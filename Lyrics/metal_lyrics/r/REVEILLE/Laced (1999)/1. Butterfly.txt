I've grown tired of this emptiness 
So deeper and deeper I dig into the dark 
Searching for tools to patch me up 
But the more I find the more I'm torn apart
Constrain it, let the subjects meld 
Like a mad disease the newborns divide 
All the walls have come crashing down 
So ball 'em up and shove 'em back inside 
Crack the shell and let the truth emerge 
Strain the brain, make it comprehend 
Breathe new life into breathless lungs 
And spread the word- it's time to rise again 
Feel it, can you feel it grow? 
Now feel it, does it multiply? 
Feel it, change is coming soon 
Butterfly, you wanna fly? 
Open your arms and let me in 
I wanna spread new wings,
I wanna shed this skin 
Resurrect and reunite the kin
Wanna spread new wings,
I wanna spread new wings 
Butterfly- open your mind, open your eyes 
Prepare your senses as the sound excels 
The next generation of angst unveiled 
And spreads like cancer through these jaded cells 
Infect me, let me crash and bleed 
I can feel the sickness flowing through my veins 
Down my system and attack the seed 
Now you can have my pleasure if you'll take my pain 
Lifeless eyes, can you see through the plastic? 
Life fucking myself when my hands are cold 
Dedication's never been the problem 
But you say the words and I'm hard as stone 
Now I see the clock reverse, don't you know- 
The pain gets worst the further back you go
Your own regrets gonna shallow you whole
Now brace yourself, come on, brace yourself
[chorus]
Why don't you open you're arms? 
Why don't you let me in? 
Give up you're past 
And lets start this thing 
Jesus Christ, rip yourself form the cross 
My patience with you has been my life's greatest loss
I'm tired of praying when nobody cares 
Can you hear me now? are you even there? 
I can see the surface, I can see the light 
And I can see it shining through your eyes tonight 
Now I can see the silhouette of seraphim 
Now I can see myself spreading my own wings 
Now tear off my garments and bury my face 
Whatever it takes to get out of this place 
Whatever it takes to hide what's inside 
Hell, I'd sell my own soul for a piece of the pride 
Now open your arms and let me in 
Tear away my scars, wash away my sins 
Spread them like wings, spread them like wings and fly 
My little butterfly I'd like to see you try 
Now open your arms and let me in 
Come and take my hand 
And let's start this thing
