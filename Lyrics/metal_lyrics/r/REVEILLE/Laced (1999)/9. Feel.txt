Everyday people are preyed upon 
Some fight, some fold, others play along 
But now it's not another story off the evening news
Not just a statistic the warnings use 
Seventeen years and a dose of reality 
Two years back seems like yesterday 
Raped, tortured, robbed of pride 
Innocence lost- torn from inside 
So I step aside and let life run its course
A handful of predators driven by a darker force 
And there's nothing I could do 
I thought I knew you 
Feel, come into reason 
Feel, come into me 
Heal, feel, I wanna make you squeal 
It's payback time, though it hurts to repeal 
Cause I've tried so hard to make it stop 
But it lurks in my dream and lingers in my thoughts 
I couldn't talk, they wouldn't respect me 
So I told myself that it didn't effect me 
But it does, it hurts so much 
Now the mask is on- I've grown numb to touch 
[chorus]
I want you to hurt like I still do 
You've taken so much that you can't replace 
I want the pain to come rolling through 
I want to see it rolling down your face 
I want you to hurt...like me 
Because time can only heal so much 
I want you to feel it you motherfucker 
I want you to feel it you fucking pig 
I want you to feel what I felt 
I want you to- feel
