Once again its on, so bring that shit 
Now the war is on against the counterfeit 
We got the five man clan to keep the mic in check 
But now you're steppin' on my heels with disrespect 
You wanna roughneck? well that's what you'll get 
Shit I'm back in effect, yo I gotta maintain 
Cause I don't need your help, I know my motherfuckin' name 
Un-tie-me, who's side are you on anyway? 
Bring the hours, bring the pressure 
It's all about finding my predecessor 
I'm a second guesser, I'm a pessimist 
Call me extreme- more like humanist 
You wanna get with this, try to sell me clothes? 
And then capture my image with the perfect pose 
So you can stamp on it, sell it, steal my fate 
But I'm the one you don't see coming 'till it's too late 
[chorus]
Snappin' photos, dealing green 
It's all about living in some other man's dream 
Can I handle the truth when the moment comes?
Can I stand the heat under the sun? 
Because the sun is bright but not pure like rain 
And I long for the back when that was in my veins 
And it was all so clear what it was all about 
Just make a statement and never sell out un-tied
