i`ve lost my footing
i`m hanging on by the brink
i`m stranded in a sea of hope 
with not a drop to drink
so i stand alone when i think
because conformity can`t be the solution
because some scars never heal 
and now my dreams lay in silent ruins
there`s blood on the horizon 
and still not a word spoken
i`ve lost my footing
i`m hanging on by a very thin thread 
now the shadow falls as the reaper calls
and the dark comes rolling in over head 
somthing wicked this way comes
and still not a fucking word spoken 
strike me down
release my hand
just let me fall 
i`ll never understand
i`m not living up to their expectations
i`m not living up to their dreams of success
they say i`m not living up to a simple standard
they say i`m not living up to the skill i possess 
i think i was born without a soul (pray for me)
i think i was born without a voice (cry for me)
i think i was born without a pulse (love for me) 
god, why was i born without a choice? (die for me) 
and not a word, not a word is spoken 
not a word is spoken - that`s why i`m broken
not a word, not a word is spoken
and still not a fucking word...
i`ll never understand
i`ll never understand you
