A wooden cross, an angels bed 
Decked with nails and strewn in red
And empty garden, our dooming fate 
Which day by day we tolerate 
A ruined world, a gaping hole 
And a prayer for god to save our souls 
Wake up, rise and shine 
Wake up, 'bout fuckin' time
A glimmer of hope is lost in time
Now is it mindless list of thoughtless crime?
Mother's fate in a child's eyes 
Now the innocent crumble under burning skies 
The mind's gone blind, for those who could see 
Now gently swing from the gallowstree 
[chorus]
Tack me up and crucify me 
Take me up, come on, wake me up 
Sin, jealousy, lies, anger 
Wanna try to vie go ahead n' spin the chamber
Rise up 
Rise and blind
