You used to be someone I could trust 
But all of that didn't last to long 
I don't know what I can believe anymore 
God, where the hell did we go wrong?
Your silence shatters my sense of hope 
How could this happen? what did I miss? 
My whole world's falling down around me 
God, how could desert me at a time like this?
I'm not perfect, nobody's perfect 
But what the fuck was I supposed to do? 
I'm washing my hands, I'm cleansing my soul 
Now all I had will die with you 
So bury the good and let that shit rot 
Cause if your only question's what's in it for me
Well then you might as well gouge out your own fucking eyes
For there are none so blind as those who will not see 
Flesh for food and blood for wine 
Because some scars don't heal with time 
Because my scars won't heal with time 
And all my love was left behind 
Flesh for food and blood for wine 
But flesh and blood- never divine
