I see god in my dreams and I can't stop running
Don't care what I've become but fear what I am becoming
Set me straight, I'm no angel
Falling apart-
She feels death from the table
Waking asleep- I can't sleep yet I'm sleeping
I'm slipping again and no hope's what I'm thinking
I'm buried alive inside, so claustrophobic
Nothing to say today- afraid and we know it
What do I know, I know that we know nothing
I feel like I'm constantly waiting for something
What am I waiting for, what am I trying to do?
I'm trying to prove that it's all a lie-
Can't get enough and I'm already there
I'm already there and I still can't get enough
So just deny what you can't repair
Between the lie, read between your lie
Can't get enough and I'm already there
I'm already there and I still can't get enough
Run as far as you can because nobody cares
Between the lie, read between your lie

I got a little secret that I keep inside
Deep down dormant in the dark she hides
But every time that I close my eyes I can feel it,
I can feel her die
Maybe I'm jaded too,
Maybe I'm dead like you,
Maybe I'm obsolete,
Maybe I'm incomplete,
Maybe insanity blinded by prophecy,
Maybe the opposite,
Maybe I'm right
Maybe a victim, maybe your not
When did you start to care about what I thought?
What would you do for me, who will you be for me,
What about family, who would you kill for me?

Ammunition for a prophets gun
All that's become must unbecome
All that's sacred, all that's true,
All that's nothing-
Lies in you

Madness, insanity-
Why do you stare through me?
Finish the rest of me
See what you wanna see
Say what your gonna say
Give and then take away
Waiting for guilt to try and read between your lie

All that's nothing lies in you-
Even if you're forgiven, would you forgive yourself?

Read between your lie
