You'd better back up off this sucker punch
Consequence, consequence-
Fuck it, no more waiting for the world to turn
Bloody as my smile dripping ear to ear
I haven't lived for a moment and think it's too damn late to learn
So just flush it down
Lie down- forever never had a dream
Asymmetric reflection of my soul to sell
Now disinfect yourself, I'll just pretend to scream
Got a low self-esteem from all these guileful lies
Carry me there- I can't stand to stand on my own
But I'd rather be hated than forgotten
Cuz it's a long way down and it's a long way home

Cataract scratch- we don't play like that
I got a bone to pick n' I'm a pick that bone
Cataract scratch- we don't play like that
Because we can't stand to stand on our own

They always said to keep my head on my shoulders,
Both feet on the ground
Been living more like one foot in the gave
Tell myself everything I need to hear
Time to face the music because it's all based on what you crave
Fiction addiction
Outer darkness is calling, it's your goodnight kiss
666 ways to fall
Catarax will blind but can you hear this?
For every sin there's a time to burn
It's near too late so don't press your luck
Now focus- do you really know what I mean,
And do you really think you'll be forgiven-
Cuz I think I'm fucked

When it rains it pours, we tug of war within
We talk of endlessness
We cry to purge our sins
Atoned to rebegin, eliminate the scars
Fuck the sky or merely count the stars
With every shade of night descending into me
I'm in the dark for life but now at least I'm free-
From my own apathy and from my own decay
I'm unremissible now but I got my way
So now can you see me inside of you?
Guide me through-
Because tomorrow will fuck you too

Break through
