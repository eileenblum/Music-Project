You better buck- buck- buckle up, prepare for this impact-
Car crash whiplash, 'bam', snap your neck back in half
Why can't I just be realistic?
Give 'em what they want and make the biddies go ballistic
Sadistic motherfuckers playing complicated-
Well never underestimate the underestimated
Opinionated, elevated, sticking to my guns
And I think your gonna get just what you got coming

That's the penalty-
Payback's a bitch so you best keep running
That's the penalty-
It's what you got coming

Yo, can I ask you something,
What the fuck is up man?
You got nothing, it's just a fairy tale your stuck in
I'm sucking from that 7 on 7
Pumping and roughing up all of these fakes that be bluffing
Nothing you can say could ever take this away now
So stay down-
And stay the fuck away from this playground
Lyrical hijack, put my madness to my method-
Check it, mic in my hand, nah, more like a lethal weapon

Go blind, bring the drums-
Better yet, here we come
You take back what you done or you can tuck tail and run
Ready or not- find yourself
And if you dare stop running I think your gonna get just what you got coming
Bring it-
Your gonna get just what you got- what you got?
Your gonna get just what you got coming
