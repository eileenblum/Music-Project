Close your eyes and jump...
You wanna fly?
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND JUMP!
You better check your pulse...
I THINK THE HEARSE WENT BY!

What...

Yo shut the fuck up and listen
Before you're down to nothing without a pot to piss in
Your missing the point that I'm mapping on this chart-
Everything we could be, everything we're not
Come on, give it all you got
All I've got is an excuse,
A noose for my hurt- feel it jerking me loose
Been lathing abuse and it's breaking me up
I'm bordering final and enough's enough
You keep sucking on your own dick, your bound to break your neck
I think that I detect a sick sign of self respect
What did I expect, I expected so much more from myself
Now why can't I open my eyes?
I TIHNK IM FUCKING DEAD!!!!

You better check your pulse...
I THINK THE HEARSE WENT BY!

We all fall, we all, we all fall down crucified!
We all fall, we're all falling, falling down purified!
We all fall, we all we all fall down lullaby!
...unborn...
We all fall, we all, we all fall down crucified!
We all fall, we're all falling, falling down purified!
We all fall, we all we all fall down lullaby!
...unborn...

Dressed like a costume party, everybody in disguise
See the mask on your face but it won't hide your eyes
My demise marks my birth, unborn into light
Now you wanna take me,
Show me wrong from right?
Well you can kiss my paraphilia
And you can kiss my sadicide
I wanna thank you for your welcome
Let me carve the shit out from inside
It's only a dream, cry yourself back to sleep
Let your mind seep down where all secrets keep
Deep beneath the calm surface a serpents eyes open wide-
A breath of death in its lies

We all fall, we all, we all fall down crucified!
We all fall, we're all falling, falling down purified!
We all fall, we all we all fall down lullaby!
...unborn...
We all fall, we all, we all fall down crucified!
We all fall, we're all falling, falling down purified!
We all fall, we all we all fall down lullaby!


Unborn!
Unborn and I'm born again!
Unborn!
Unborn and I'm born again!
Unborn!
Unborn and I'm born again!
Unborn!
Unborn and I'm born again!

And im born again...

Kiss my paraphilia
Kiss my sadicide
Thank you for your welcome
Let me carve the shit out from inside
That old man, damn, he sure can talk
He said that I fucked jesus in a trailer park
N' that ain't the truth, it was in the ritz hotel
I wore a condom so I wouldn't BURN IN HELL!

MAYBE I'M DEAD!

You better check your pulse...
I think the hearse went by
Denial still stings in these lifeless eyes

We all fall, we all, we all fall down crucified!
We all fall, we're all falling, falling down purified
We all fall, we all we all fall down lullaby
...unborn...
We all fall, we all, we all fall down crucified!
We all fall, we're all falling, falling down purified!
We all fall, we all we all fall down lullaby!
We all fall, we all, we all fall down crucified!
We all fall, we're all falling, falling down purified!
We all fall, we all we all fall down lullaby!
...unborn...
We all fall, we all, we all fall down crucified!
We all fall, we're all falling, falling down purified!
We all fall, we all we all fall down lullaby!

Unborn!
Unborn and I'm born again!
Unborn!
Unborn and I'm born again!
Unborn!
Unborn and I'm born again!
Unborn!
