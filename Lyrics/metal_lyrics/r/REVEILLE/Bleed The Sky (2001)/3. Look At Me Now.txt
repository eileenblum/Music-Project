He can't avoid conflict-
He's lost cuz he's incomplete
He's in between, somewhere in between, in between the sleepless shadows
Battling to break the love that's 'guaranteed to make you bleed thicker than blood'
He don't want it, but craves what he can't escape
He's staring straight through his fate and now he's face to face
You wanna fall down, well this could make your dreams come true
Because the devil was an angel too

Look at me now, making the same mistakes I said I'd never make again-
But now I'm back in the same place
Look at me now, somebody stole my soul-
I feel the breaks go and I'm spinning out of control

Come step into a brave new world-
Not even worth it
Decent comes quick and now he's anything but perfect
And still he worships that fundamental bullshit talk
'the path you carve yourself is the path to walk'
Now walk alone-
Play it to the bone
Don't make it right just because he got his sickness from that venomous bite
We wanna fall down, well this could make our dreams come true
Because the devil was an angel too

It's gonna be alright, everything's okay
Mothers tears will fall and wash it all away

Suck, suck it- suck, suck it up
