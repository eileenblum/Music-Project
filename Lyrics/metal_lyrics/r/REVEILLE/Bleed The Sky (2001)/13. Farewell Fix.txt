I'm sorry that I put you in the picture,
I didn't think you'd hit your head so hard
The frame looks better all crooked on the wall,
Kinda reminds me of the way we are-
The way we lie and victimize ourself
Now is it me or do our secrets matter more than our health?
I nail my hands down just to feel the way that he felt-
But can't scream with near enough strength to cry for help
I feel the ground give beneath my feet,
I can't handle anything that you say
And I pray that it's possible to- birth
Your better off
Now take my word and just walk away

But what can I say?
I love the way she hates-
I love the way she hates me

Don't make a move,
I got that exit wound from pride and now I realize
Don't make a move,
I got that exit wound and I've cried myself dry

No limits to pain,
I've bled for you now bleed for me-
Cuz no one ever told you that it wouldn't be hard
I've got flesh full of ink just waiting to drip so come and take your best shot
You know I'll love you by dawn
After we've cum and gone over the power we chased
I think I'm way too late-
My hate's taken my place
Because the only thing that ring represents these days is the mark that it left in the side of my face

For every fatal breath I've held,
For every harmful truth I've spit,
Had everything I'd ever need,
And every time I'd scream myself sick

Say goodbye to this drug- I've got a new soul to steal
I'm on my farewell fix-
I've got a new soul to steal
