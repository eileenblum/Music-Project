Welcome to my revelation, reanimation
My anthem of regret-
Two steps from my evisceration
My destination- where the rain meets the dust
And my only separation from my pain is my trimulus
And plus my self-distrust, disgust
I must confess that when I rush I bust-
No rest cuz everything's a test
We're bringing just enough stress to keep this microphone in check
And if you read between my lie I'll take you step by step by step
Protect yourself, it's day to day for life
2001nails driven into Jesus Christ
Too many sleepless nights
I feel my head go numb
A tangled web brought a spider bite that's counting me down to none

Never say never, never lie, never cry wolf
Fuck it to infinity
Now run it like a toll booth
Cold truth, all work and no play make you sick
Spittin' psycho-dellic hits all up in your trip
Now I gotta get a grip, between the cracks we slide
They been tainting the view with holy matricide
I run the override, so back on up the track
Acquisition ammunition, demolition of the facts
Hypochondriac, prepare to end your pain
Take a look inside and ride the nowhere train
Come drain my rain away, insane today, behold oblivion
Cuz I was born with a thousand dreams and I'm down to none
