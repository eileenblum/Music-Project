Prepare to meet your maker, your unmaker, your remaker-
Make yourself
Don't fake, you'll make the same mistakes
And if your fed up then ask yourself why
Because you sit around and pick at your scabs while your answer waits
Wake up, nobody cares about what you think
And don't blame them because you know they're just like you
And if you get this then get the fuck up-
Before you can't remember why you can't live and you're too late too

Fuck it up derelict
Now suck it up and deal with it
Find yourself

Set it if you get it,
All this confusion imbedded in my head
Should let the dead bury the dead for good
She said I'm so vain-
I don't understand why I can't just break away from tendencies that I know I should
Wake up- nobody ever told you to breath
Have we forgotten everything we thought once true?
I think I'll move on-
Cuz I can't stand to lay around and decay till I'm too late too

Murder me destiny
Spare me the ignominy
Give up insecurity
Just be what you wanna be
Compelled to procrastinate
I nearly go blind from sight
Forget it insane
I say come set it if you get it right

Find your self
