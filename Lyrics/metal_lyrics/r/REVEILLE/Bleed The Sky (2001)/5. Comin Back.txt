Is anybody out there?
Have you been lost in the sky?
Do you really need a miracle to open your eyes?
Take a look around, mother fucking fantasy rides
Now how the hell could you ever ask god for a sign?
Moon rise, sunset, understand what I'm saying yet?
Life's what you make it, don't let time take it
I gotta stand on my own in my own light
I'm not picking you apart I'm just trying' to pick a fight
Cuz there's an owl on somebody's roof tonight
And you know what that means, right?

Comin back- no more pain, no more games
I'm comin back- the more things change, the more I stay the same
Comin back- you say that you won't but you will
I'm comin back- I don't need your help
In fact I know I'm comin back- I'm comin back
Now I'm comin back

It's not like I like to talk about this shit
But sometimes it's best to just set yourself free
Suppression leads to depression and then some
And that's why I fall so far from this tree
Like the fruit lay beneath forbidden shade,
Any mark you make, with time, the rain will wash away
But I found a way to break on through
As long as hopes still waiting for me for when I come to

The moon looked like skin cancer tonight in a photo negative
See me dark and light-
It hurt more than it felt good, understood?
Just because you cry don't mean it make you off the hook
Get you off the hook, you want me to get you off?
I'm comin back, my stitches splitting

My life for your sight
Come and take a bite
Drink for payback-
Blood sucker, suck me dry
It's my turn,
When your in the dust and your all alone it doesn't make a sound if you die
