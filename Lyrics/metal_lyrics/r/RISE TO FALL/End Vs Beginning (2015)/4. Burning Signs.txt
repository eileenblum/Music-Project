Lights attracted by the gravity
Burning signs approaching to an end

Testing our abilities
We could cope
This brand new challenge
Every link is vital
And you are the piece we need

Escaping, you will miss it all
Stay here
And you'll learn how to play

[Chorus:]
Now it's time
To focus on this chain of life
Feel the intention shake inside
Making all the demons fall apart
Find the faith beyond the scars

March against adversity
Our mind's mighty
We just need to believe

Escaping, you will miss it all
Stay here
And you'll learn how to play

[Chorus:]
Now it's time
To focus on this chain of life
Feel the intention shake inside
Making all the demons fall apart
Find the faith beyond the scars

Hold your hands
(Hold your hands)
Hold your hands
(Hold your hands)
Hold your hands now
3, 2, 1, go

Our course continues
Our course continues

Escaping, you will miss it all
Stay here
And you'll learn how to play

[Chorus:]
Now it's time
To focus on this chain of life
Feel the intention shake inside
Making all the demons fall apart
Find the faith beyond the scars
