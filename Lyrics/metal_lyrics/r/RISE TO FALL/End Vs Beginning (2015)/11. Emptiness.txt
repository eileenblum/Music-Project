Wearing a painted smile
In front of the mirror
Sadness revealed
When they turn around
Always moving
Towards the same direction
You think you are safe
But you look all lost

Now follow your instincts
I'm sure they'll take you home
Like a wise man said one time
Now be realistic
And see what's going on
Your freedom is designed

You keep repeating
Movements in a curl
so don't expect other results
Conformism is shown in every step
More and more trapped
In the spider web

Now follow your instincts
I'm sure they'll take you home
Like a wise man said one time
Now be realistic
And see what's going on
Your freedom is designed

[Chorus:]
Emptiness dissecting the souls
Of those who are not living
Emptiness
Differing from those who overrule
New ways of living
Ways of living

[Solo]

I'm not here to fit into your world
I'm here to build my own
How are you gonna fill
This sombre void
If is smoke everything you swallow?

[Chorus 2x:]
Emptiness dissecting the souls
Of those who are not living
Emptiness
Differing from those who overrule
New ways of living
Ways of living
