Black birds have darkened the skyline
They've been fed with hate and terror
Desperation corroding their minds
Solid victims of their compromise

I'm sick of the strangers
They're still many of them to come
Their purpose is to sack
I have no choice, it's time to act

[Chorus:]
I chase the northern lights
I seek their radiation
(Radiation now)
A fusion of
Electric colours in the heights
Brings dramatic changes

Experts on crossing the threshold
Keep on breaking all the limits
A new power will be shown tonight
I can sense it, it comes burning

I'm sick of the strangers
They're still many of them to come
Their purpose is to sack
I have no choice, it's time to act

[Chorus:]
I chase the northern lights
I seek their radiation
(Radiation now)
A fusion of
Electric colours in the heights
Brings dramatic changes

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
I chase the northern lights
I seek their radiation
(Radiation now)
A fusion of
Electric colours in the heights
Brings dramatic changes
