Can you hear it?
It's the sound of our world resurging
The sound of theirs falling apart
A cosmic seed falls from the heights
From the bowels of the sky
Fecundating the waters

A new creation takes shape
An evolved being created from
A polished collection of errors
A sense of battle
The next chapter's open
End versus beginning

[Chorus:]
We are building again
No matter how long it takes us to
Restore the balance
We are swimming against
This dying current till we heal

[Solo 1/2]

I wake up
In this lonely and desolated place
I can hear nothing but silence
Is it mine this body I inhabit?
I don't recognize the thoughts
That invade my mind

[Chorus:]
We are building again
No matter how long it takes us to
Restore the balance
We are swimming against
This dying current till we heal

Corruption is rewarded
And honesty's a sacrifice
But slowly the tide is turning

[Solo 2/2]

[Chorus 2x:]
We are building again
No matter how long it takes us to
Restore the balance
We are swimming against
This dying current till we heal
