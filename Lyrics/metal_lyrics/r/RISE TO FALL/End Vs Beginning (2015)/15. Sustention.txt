I go back to the place that I
Should have never left
The shadow of failure
Always haunts me
All my attempts to improve things
Have ended in disgrace

What matters is not what happens
But how you react to it

[Chorus:]
The stars are falling
Fading in the gloom
Choose well your wishes
You'll have to deal with them
The stars are falling
Fading in the gloom
Choose the right wish

All this time was you who
Took care of me
You've been my sustention
Too good to be real

[Chorus:]
The stars are falling
Fading in the gloom
Choose well your wishes
You'll have to deal with them
The stars are falling
Fading in the gloom
Choose the right wish

I've tried to stop this hemorrhage
But I've only papered over the cracks
Who am I to alter the minds
To change the course of things?
I've lost my center
I've become the one I hated

What matters is not what happens
But how you react to it
Let out the blame you gather
Sintonize to feel

Every disease
Begins with an imbalance
And I have caused the greatest of all

All the things I wanted
For this planet are lost in the din...
...but then you appear
And your very presence
Makes everything make sense

You've always been my pull back to true north
My defensive energy

But now I must act alone
And be consistent with my decisions
Today may be a day we all remember
A defining day

You make me understand my road
That's why I choose you
In a million of lifetimes
In a million of worlds
I'll always choose you

[Chorus:]
The stars are falling
Fading in the gloom
Choose well your wishes
You'll have to deal with them
The stars are falling
Fading in the gloom
Choose the right wish

All this time was you who
Took care of me
You've been my sustention
And you will always be
