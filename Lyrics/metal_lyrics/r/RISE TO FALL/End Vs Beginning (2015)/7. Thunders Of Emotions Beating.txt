Another soul is awakening
Still don't know
If he's a friend of a threat
He's been repressed
Suffering for too long
Once released it cannot be stopped

Always driven by faith
Everything happens for a reason
Fascinated by this scene
Every single cloud has a silver lining
Now the sorrow makes sense

[Chorus:]
A realistic prospect
Changing all around
Thunders of emotions beating
Stronger than the storm itself

Your anger is atrocious
But there's still goodness inside you
Beyond the superficial the appearances
There's a world
Our cognitions can't perceive

Always driven by faith
Everything happens for a reason
Fascinated by this scene
Every single cloud has a silver lining

[Chorus:]
A realistic prospect
Changing all around
Thunders of emotions beating
Stronger than the storm itself

[Solo]

Go

We have to investigate to find
The underlying structures
The answer lies in the core
Even the strongest have a weak spot

Always driven by faith
Everything happens for a reason
Fascinated by this scene
Every single cloud has a silver lining

[Chorus X2:]
A realistic prospect
Changing all around
Thunders of emotions beating
Stronger than the storm itself
