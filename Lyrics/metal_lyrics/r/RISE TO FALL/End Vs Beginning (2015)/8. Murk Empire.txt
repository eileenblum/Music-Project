Submerging into a toxic paradise
A murk empire's waiting
Right below the ice

It's a good distance
So I go straight to the core
Something's hiding in the immensity
I fear an expansion of a new disease

The more I venture
Into the obscurity
The more I see the coming
Of an imminent risk
A rotten seabed
Welcomes me to Hell
A cemetery of waste and filth

This landscape defines us
It reflects who we are
Growing holes in the morality
Can explain how we came to this

[Chorus:]
When the last alarm bell sounds
Begging for urgent help
A new method must be found
To stop the suffering
You are all spreading

[Solo]

?????

[Chorus:]
When the last alarm bell sounds
Begging for urgent help
A new method must be found
To stop the suffering
You are all spreading

I can hear you
I can feel all the pain
I will cure you
(I can hear you)
(I can feel all the pain)
I will dredge all the dirt
I will bring truth to light
