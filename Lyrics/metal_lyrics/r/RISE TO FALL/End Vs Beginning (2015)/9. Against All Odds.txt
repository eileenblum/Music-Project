It all begins within oneself
Like a flash that scares the dark
A spark threatening to become fire
Burning all the curtains that
Conceal reality

Release the internal capabilities
(We'll move forward in great strides)
We are always what we
Want ourselves to be

The more aware we become
The more we begin to understand
Why this is happening
And what we are meant to learn
In our growth and change

Release the internal capabilities
(We'll move forward in great strides)
We are always what we
Want ourselves to be

[Chorus:]
The legacy goes on
Our dream will last forever
Nothing can separate us from our goal
Our goal

Against all odds
Turn off this systematic conduct
It requires a sacrifice
We must take a risk
By exploring those territories
Never visited before

[Chorus:]
The legacy goes on
Our dream will last forever
Nothing can separate us from our goal
The energy's eternal

[Solo]

We will meddle with your thinking
We'll be controversial
Condemned by authority
We are at the cutting edge
Of imagination
Flirting with madness
We'll be the surprise

[Chorus:]
The legacy goes on
Our dream will last forever
Nothing can separate us from our goal
Our goal
The energy is eternal

[Chorus:]
The legacy goes on
Our dream will last forever
Nothing can separate us from our goal
The energy's eternal
