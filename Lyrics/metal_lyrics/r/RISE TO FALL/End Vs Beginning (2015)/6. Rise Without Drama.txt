After the explosion
I could only see ruins
Everything I'd created
Were only ashes

You were just a lump of inert matter
Floating in space
Your consciousness
Completed its learning cycle
And went on to another phase

Will I ever find the secret bound
That divides intuition and failure?
Time to ease your mind
You are safe and sound
Now you can indulge
Your desires freely

[Chorus:]
Like a pure light
Like a cold flame that never fades
Feel a breath of bliss

Somehow I crossed the cosmos
Then I was reborn
Fair hostility of the place
Made me strong

Now you know the charms and threats
Surrounding us
Don't you think it's something worth
Fighting for?

[Chorus:]
Like a pure light
Like a cold flame that never fades
Feel a breath of bliss
Like a long life
That absorbs pain in full
Our aim's to fix

I can see my soul
Forever glowing like a burning torch
I've found a way
To build a bridge to higher worlds
I condemn the lie
That sinks everything in blindness

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Like a pure light
Like a cold flame that never fades
Feel a breath of bliss
Like a long life
That absorbs pain in full
Our aim...
Feel a breath of bliss
Like a pure light
Like a flame that never fades
Feel a breath of bliss
Like a long life
Like a long life
Like a flame that never fades
