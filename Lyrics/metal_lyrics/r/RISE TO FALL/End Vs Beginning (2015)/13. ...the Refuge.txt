I'm one with the water
The currents shape me
First they feed me
Then they whisper me
All the miseries they bring within

Something must be done
We are being infected too much
And now the time has come
The time for this world to purge

Wounds are growing
Spreading like cancer
And it seems there is no one
To stop this disaster
Now I see it clear
The first impulse commands
To begin with this mission
I will send my regards

Something must be done
We are being infected too much
And now the time has come
The time for this world to purge

I'll treat you with respect
Will you follow my example?

[Chorus:]
Believe in a place
Full of true hearts
Where no one rules but the just
Fear disappears as trust
Forges his own path

Entering with stealth
Like an unexpected visitor
I'm very sorry
For not knocking at the door

I introduce myself
And invite you to my refuge
The place where you'll taste
The price of your impunity

Something must be done
We are being infected too much
And now the time has come
The time for this world to purge 

Your game of oil and guns
Brings nothing but destruction

[Chorus:]
Believe in a place
Full of true hearts
Where no one rules but the just
Fear disappears as trust
Forges his own path

Aoh

You've got a chance
To begin from scratch
Maybe it's the last
Are you ready to restart?

[Chorus 2x:]
Believe in a place
Full of true hearts
Where no one rules but the just
Fear disappears as trust
Forges his own path
