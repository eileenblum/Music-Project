Encased in a frozen coffin
From another age
Almost mummified
Inside a hermetic cage

I've remained stagnant
Now crystal tears melt the ice

[Chorus:]
I am bleeding
Defying on my own
I'm paralyzed by this invading host
I am leading
Defying the inner ghosts
These parasites contaminate my soul

Fragments of degeneration
Corrupting the atmosphere
A pollution caused by
A factory of fears

I've remained stagnant
Now crystal tears melt the ice

[Chorus:]
I am bleeding
Defying on my own
I'm paralyzed by this invading host
I am leading
Defying the inner ghosts
These parasites contaminate my soul

There is an army of infected soldiers
Running through my veins
I won't let them conquer my existence
I take control of them

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
I am bleeding
Defying on my own
I'm paralyzed by this invading host
I am leading
Defying the inner ghosts
These parasites contaminate my soul

Defying the inner ghosts
