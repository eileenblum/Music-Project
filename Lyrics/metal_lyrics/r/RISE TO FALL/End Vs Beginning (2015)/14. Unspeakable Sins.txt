I absorbed all the evils of this age
Every drop of unspeakable sins
Thought they couldn't
Cause more damage
But now I'm the one in danger

I won't quit
Until I beat this burden
And the pain feeds me
I'll resist
Till the end of all times
As long as anyone

[Chorus:]
Is down on his knees
Watching their freedom bleeding
Succumbed by some
Terrifying figures
That dwell in these lands

Underrated by the most skeptic
Overrated by the hopeful ones
None of them took into account that
Nothing's ever what it seems

Dominated by invented forces
We are the ones who let the sorrow in
If the mind says there's no soreness
Then the cells begin to breathe

I won't quit
Until I beat this burden
And the pain feeds me
I'll resist
Till the end of all times
As long as anyone

[Chorus:]
Is down on his knees
Watching their freedom bleeding
Succumbed by some
Terrifying figures
That dwell in these lands

Hidden in the most unexpected place
Awaits the last living hope
Aooh

Now solutions are growing silent
Visualize the curing
Just see it done
A single decision
Can change your destiny

We are all judged by our actions
The choices we make
It is now or never
I choose to live

(As long as anyone)

[Chorus:]
Is down on his knees
Watching their freedom bleeding
Succumbed by some
Terrifying figures
That dwell in these lands
That dwell in these lands
That dwell in these lands
