Call it disobedience
Call it defiance
But I'm not longer
Under your guidance
The cauldron's full
There's no place for the greed
You ain't the ingredient
That this potion needs

Unmasked purposes
They won't catch me off guard again
I've learnt your tactics
Your strategies
They all collide
Against your wall in the end
Against your words
(Against your words)
Your actions speak
(Your actions speak)
Expose the lies we once believed

Always alert
Can't afford making any mistakes
Submission fades
And that's when your system breaks

Crossing the line
Towards this light that I'm feeling
It's been dark for so long
After the horizon
There isn't always an end
It's just a false backdrop

Dark clowns leading blinds
The monster's era
Dark clowns leading blinds
It will be a memory

All the imposed limits
Are quickly getting old
Are disappearing
Together with the inculcated roles
(Inculcated roles)

Crossing the line
Towards this light that I'm feeling
It's been dark for so long
After the horizon
There isn't always an end
It's just a false backdrop

Dark clowns leading blinds
The monster's era
Dark clowns leading blinds
It will be a memory

Unmasked purposes
They won't catch me off guard again
I've learnt your tactics
Your strategies
They all collide
Against your wall in the end
