A motivation increases
Within my walls
I see the coming results

The same behavior
The same way to perform
Won't bring me wisdom
Won't take me where I wanna go

When the routine knocks at the door
Claiming for an answer
Imagination is the source
The passport to a higher mind

[Chorus:]
I'm wearing a new skin
Today I challenge the laws
Into this plastic scene
Should I dare to moult?

Create an image
Without a clear parting point
No prescribed rules in this world
When there is no way out
The unconscious overflows
I look for shelter
In my comfort capsules

When the routine knocks at the door
Claiming for an answer
Imagination is the source
That opens all the borderlines

[Chorus:]
I'm wearing a new skin
Today I challenge the laws
Into this plastic scene
Should I dare to moult?
(Should I dare to moult?)

A place, a song, the art...
Are good conductors to your imagery
Now find among your thoughts
A big explosion of creativity

Imagination is the tool
That makes you graze the sky

[Chorus:]
I'm wearing a new skin
Today I challenge the laws
Into this plastic scene
Should I dare to moult?
