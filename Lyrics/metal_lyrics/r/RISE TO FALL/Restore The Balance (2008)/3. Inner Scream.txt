Listen! I'm leaving now! I can't stand it longer
I've lost the faith, I'm failing down
These walls trap me inside - I need to find a new world
Where no one knows the lie
Haunted by memories, I can't forget the yesterday
Just free me for a while
In order to advance, I need to find the place I've been
To bury my defaults
I damn what you say, I pray for silence
Don't wanna be a forgotten star
For you all

[Chorus:]
I try to rise but I always fall
I gotta keep on trying
I try to rise but I always fall
And now my soul is crying
Don't shackle me to this, there's still a lot to be done
On my own
That force yo repress, now shines so break this shield
That doesn't let you breath
I damn what you say, I pray for silence
Don't wanna be a forgotten star
For you all
Born! - A new impulse has born
Please give me new results
Scream with me!
I damn what you say, I pray for silence
Don't wanna be a forgotten star
For you all
I try to rise but I always fall
I gotta keep on trying
I try to rise but I always fall
And now my soul is dying
Born! - A new impulse has born
Please give me new results
