I'll show you something yo can't miss
Open your mind for this
Strong enough captivate your soul
And deep enough to freeze your bones
And the fear in me so col
I scream in silence
Penetrate the gates of darkness
You'll find something you can't accept
If you want to see me fall again
Get ready cause it comes so clear
And the fear in me so col
I scream in silence
And the hole in me has grown
You are going somewhere

[Chorus:]
Taking my fear away from you,
Before you are going insane
Finding brightness, is flowing anywhere
Taking my fear away from you,
Before you are going insane
Finding brightness, I fight in vane
Penetrate the gates of darkness
You'll find something you can't accept
If you want to see me fall again
Get ready cause it comes so clear
I wish I could believe in nothing
My belief feeds the unknown
