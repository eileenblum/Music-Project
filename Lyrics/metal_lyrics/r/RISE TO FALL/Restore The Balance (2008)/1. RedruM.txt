I've sold my soul today, I'm losing myself
I despise your handiness to spoil the air
In a blaze of anger, I cast aside all restraint
I'm living so paranoid
Blame me - I can't stop this brawl!
Blame me - I'll send you to your sacrifice!
I'm the gatecrusher
(I will deter your plan,
Get ready for your last downfall)

[Chorus (1/2):]
And your view so blind - The greed you sow
Brings us the decline

You try to place restriction on my liberty
You deserve no reverence, we revert to type
Show me your harmly weapons
I'm harden to adversity
I'm living so paranoid
Blame me - I can't stop this brawl!
Blame me - I'll send you to your sacrifice!

[Chorus:]
And your view so blind - the greed you sow
Brings us the decline
We won't fall behind - we'll set out for
That complete design
You can't hide from me
