You won't believe me
But I've been in the deepest shadow
I've seen his face and now it is -
Stuck in me
Don't show me your light
Too far from me, impossible to see
This is something I have to face it by my side

[Chorus:]
I trip again today, I fell the dark insanity
I trip again today, I chase the infinity
There's nowhere to hide,
There's no way to avoid the pain
You must confront it with strength -
Step by step
I am a lost soul, with no curse,
With no conviction
I'm trapped between to inverse worlds
Face it by my side
I think I'm getting closer, closer is the truth
Is it good or evil?
With courage I'm crossing the line
I cross the line
I'm chasing the sign, in circles like satellites
(Unreachable glory)
I think I'm getting closer, closer is the truth
Is it good or evil?
With courage I'm crossing the line
