Another day escapes from me
So lost I still wander
To any sign that leads my way
I've always been correct
And now yo call me evil
I'm rectifying
Don't want to crash against the wall
Are we sharing a common purpose?
Maybe it does not exist at all
Perhaps it's all (just) a story
Your hidden paradise will never come

[Chorus:]
I live my days without faith
Is this jigsaw I can't resolve?
I can't breathe, without you
It seems like I'm falling
Don't try to avoid it
I'm swept along by the crowd
Am I a loser?
'cause I can't save myself
Drained of energy, now watch me descent
To the eternal depths that trap me so
...and why does it seem to me dark time go slow?
At this rate daylight, will never come!
I keep my life inside a vault
It seems like I'm falling
