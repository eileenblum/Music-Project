Under pressure, I face the time
I feel this cycle's dying
As might have been expected
Here comes the worst
Have you ever stopped to find
An answer to your questions?
The shape of things to come
Is it really designed?
Under pressure - I'm penetrating your world
I live for the things, I can find
Under pressure - I'm penetrating your world
Unless you can find me
Will you ever stop the crime?
There's no eternal glory
Destruction benefits you
But one day you may fall
Under pressure - I'm penetrating your world
I live for the things, I can find
Under pressure - I'm penetrating your world
Unless you detect me

[Chorus:]
Dont's stay away, and come with me
I fear I'll die alone
Dont's stay away and come with me
Before I find the storm
Believe me when I say that posion's there
Within these walls you'll never find me
Vindications won't bring us a peaceful way to go
Will you ever stop the crime?
There's no eternal glory
Destruction benefits you
You create a wave of shadow
Under pressure - I'm penetrating your world
I live for the things, I can find
Under pressure - I'm penetrating your world
Unless you detect me
Against adversity - I hack my way
Through this wasting shade
I'm the pathfinder
You think you've planned it down to the last detail,
But you don't bear in mind,
Your halcyon days are gone
