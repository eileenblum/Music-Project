Finally I've reached the state
Where nothing cares me at all
Spreading so much wistfulness
I couldn't see the core
Envy me and watch me burn,
Don't try to kill this fire
The sense of my existence
Is building my empire
Give up searching - I've found the light, I'll show it to you
Keep on trusting - it won't leave you high, and dry
Give up searching - I've found the light, I'll show it to you
Start risking and you'll learn the way to fly

[Chorus:]
Listen, the chance has come
I feel it claiming
Listen, a chance has bloomed
And is so divine
For so long, I've been inside,
No way to face the scorn
Give me one more second,
To pay off and score
Immersed in rivalry
I just want to live
In peaceful coexistence
With everybody else
Give up searching - I've found the light, I'll show it to you
Keep on trusting - it won't leave you high, and dry
Give up searching - I've found the light, I'll show it to you
Start risking and you'll learn the way to fly
I know a clear pattern, begins to emerge!
The initiation to your overthrow
Stop being a beholder, it's time to react
Your efforts won't go down as a failure
