Sick and torn I am reflecting by myself
In loneliness I sink, no floating hopes
I won't survive -
My inner pump is now for sure
Awaiting my death
Hear me scream because I can't stand the truth
The conscious side awakes, the trip begins
I need to fill the empty gaps I've left behind
To enter my death

[Chorus:]
Preserve the mind and keep the soul
Dreams stay away
Don't look behind and make them be as one
Are you ready to feel this?
There's no cure to heal my infected wounds
So clarify my thoughts, let me go on
I can't deny, acceptance could be my light
To build my own realm

[Chorus:]
Be myself - I want it all
Could you please respect me!?
Be aware - I defy all
Could you give me what I deserve!?

[Chorus x2]
