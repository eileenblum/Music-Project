I can count the grains
In the top of the sandglass
Your game is about to be over
I have learnt to read the signs
Now I'm capable to decode the message

New voices will command
Your portrait will be burnt
We need to shed skin
You've been riding for a fall
Rotten to the core
Your vanity knows no bounds

You show no scruples always devastate
Without counting the cost
You provoke us to action
And actions speak louder than words!

[Chorus:]
Staring at the distance
See bright lights again
Come to built a different end
And then trail away

The picture of...
A new horizon needs...
Needs still to be drawn

Blustery days of faith
Charged with the energy of the storm
We will modify the new land
Fighting till we shot our bolt
Your old rotten roots won't last...
Another winter

[Chorus:]
Staring at the distance
See bright lights again
Come to built a different end
And then trail away

[Chorus:]
Staring at the distance
See bright lights again
Come to built a different end
And then trail away
