Below the surface I find what is real
A painful truth to reveal
We are all standing like automatons in life
Don't you see that we all share the same pathetic style?

Reject the mould
Unclose the riddle
That never lets you grow
We need to molt
And push the wheel
That never seems to roll

We are simple puppets
With no individual viewpoint
Take your place-card and sit down

Reject the mould
Unclose the riddle
That never lets you grow

[Chorus:]
Delete the way and now turn yourself
Into a mystic soul
Delete the way and now be the weird
Be their denial

We walk following a stranger's footsteps
That will always take us to conquered lands

Reject the mould
Unclose the riddle
That never lets you grow
We need to molt
And push the wheel
That never seems to roll

[Chorus:]
Delete the way and now turn yourself
Into a mystic soul
Delete the way and now be the weird
Be their denial

What would you sacrifice
What would you exchange
For a piece of authenticity?

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Delete the way and now turn yourself
Into a mystic soul
Delete the way and now be the weird
Be their denial

To be a mystic soul
Inside this world
Delete the way and
Be their denial
