[Feat. Aimar Antxia from NoDrama]

I'm going downhill again
Growing weaker
And everything turns against me
Don't pile on the agony
Breathe once again
(Breathe Once again)
Slow down the beating

Just leave me, I need to get rid of
This greedy monster by myself
Please try to understand this
You're sorely wounded
And you may need some help

[Chorus:]
Unified we won't fall again
Let's blend our strengths as a single blow
Concentrate on a thought
With a clear shape
As one we'll strike gold

The hand that feeds you
Holds up the whip that punishes you
The order becomes blurred
You are disconcerted
This faintness
This searing pain
Is killing me
Is drying me
Like a wasting disease

Now feed your mind with conviction
Revive the illusion that holds you up
How can I trust? Everything's decaying
Nothing expected seems to come

[Chorus:]
Unified we won't fall again
Let's blend our strengths as a single blow
Concentrate on a thought
With a clear shape
As one we'll strike gold

Tame the egoitistic mind
Know your own darkness
Then you'll deal with anything

We need to renew our old silver crown
What is that you lack?
We must be swift to act

[Solo - Kasta]

I cast in my lot with you
I took the auguries
I saw us triumph
Let's form a chain right now, right here
Let's modify what fate had in store for us

[Chorus:]
Unified we won't fall again
Let's blend our strengths as a single blow
Concentrate on a thought
With a clear shape
As one we'll strike gold

Suffused with light
We will refine this world
With the old forgotten wisom
