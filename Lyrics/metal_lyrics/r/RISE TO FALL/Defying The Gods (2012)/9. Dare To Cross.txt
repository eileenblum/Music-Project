Dejected I walked through this
Eternal row
Now I know the answer
How to climb to the top
Limited by my insecurities
I couldn't take control
Consumed in silence
My ego checked me so
When I was on the edge
I always show doubt

[Chorus:]
Yesterday I was trembling
Behind an opened door
Today I leap at the chances one by one
I grab them one by one

Negation is not gonna be
A part of me anymore
Disaffiliating from what delays me
To get the correct role

[Chorus:]
Yesterday I was trembling
Behind an opened door
Today I leap at the chances one by one
I grab them one by one

Believe me
It's time to break the stone
That doesn't let you react

Believe me
It's time to break the stone
That doesn't let you react

Believe me
It's time to break the stone...

Disaffiliating from what delays me
To get the correct role

[Chorus:]
Yesterday I was trembling
Behind an opened door
Today I leap at the chances one by one
I grab them one by one

[Chorus:]
Yesterday I was trembling
Behind an opened door
Today I leap at the chances...
