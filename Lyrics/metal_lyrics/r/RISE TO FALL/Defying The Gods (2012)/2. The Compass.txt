Running from the dark
Dry in a dustbowl
I was captivated by a dazzling glance
Almost like a sudden blast
You rose from the gutter
To illuminate the night

You taught me how to turn invisible
How to blend in with the scene

Everything's alive and conscious
(Conscious, conscious)
Listen to the sheer breathing
The image of all that's pure
Hide beyond the obvious
It's the reflections of the real laws

You taught me how to turn invisible
How to blend in with the scene
To maintain balance we must go unnoticed
(Unnoticed)
Never alter the atmosphere

[Chorus:]
Feel the shine inside the core
Emotions come back to live
Let's resurrect intuition
Once burnt out

Sharp your limited perception
Try to feel the things
That you can't see

The precious gift you are
A compass in the dark
Syntonized we can never get lost

[Chorus:]
Feel the shine inside the core
Emotions come back to live
Let's resurrect intuition
Once burnt out

Total disconnection from the natural world
Never will we reach full growth
You gave me the drop that shakes
Every feeling inside

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Feel the shine inside the core
Emotions come back to live
Let's resurrect intuition
Once burnt out

Eee-aaww
