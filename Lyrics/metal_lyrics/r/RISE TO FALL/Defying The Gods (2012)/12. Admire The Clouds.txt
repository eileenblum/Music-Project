[Japanese Bonus Track]Always complaining
Whether things are fair or no
Turns you a victim
You've got the excuse
For not participating
For not taking charge
Please make sure you choose well

I rise, I fall
I just keep struggling
Admire the clouds of the storm
With no reproach
I just can't blame them
Cause without them
Our sun wouldn't be a recompense

[Chorus:]
When you banish the deadly sins
You'll be approaching
The sacred flame

Why does the fog
Never seem to drive away?
Maybe it's you that doesn't walk
Step by step
The light will show up the first rays
Patiently you'll realize
The very essential things

I rise, I fall
I just keep struggling
Admire the clouds of the storm
With no reproach
I just can't blame them
Cause without them
Our sun wouldn't be a recompense

[Chorus:]
When you banish the deadly sins
You'll be approaching
The sacred flame
The new vision
Sets you on the right road
Tells you the way to go

Watch your steps
There's no light
You are entering a tunnel
The walls will try to get you
Don't let them middle in your way
The ground is full of cracks
At the end there is a gallery
That can make your mind
Be a torture chamber
Judging your ghosts will set you free

[Chorus:]
When you banish the deadly sins
You'll be approaching
The sacred flame
The new vision
Sets you on the right road
Tells you the way to go
