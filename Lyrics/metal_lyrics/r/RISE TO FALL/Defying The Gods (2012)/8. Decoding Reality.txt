(Anchored to a state...)
(... Of existential stagnation)
(Liberty shut in a strong box)
(It's time to enter the code!)

Let's go back to the starting point
When it all had a meaning
Are we really a chosen breed or just
An accident that only brings dust?

Our conscience's so numb
Inside a programmed mind
Mysteries should be felt
Without the mind's veil

[Chorus:]
I got a feeling
That something's gonna be found out
Disclose the secrets
Isolated for so long

Our existence has been filled up with
Unnatural codes and beliefs
Have we really forgotten who we are?
Don't give a chance to the fake mask

Our conscience's so numb
Inside a programmed mind
Mysteries should be felt
Without the mind's veil

[Chorus:]
I got a feeling
That something's gonna be found out
Disclose the secrets
Isolated for so long

Achored to a state of existential stagnation
Liberty shut in a strong box
Enter the code

[Chorus:]
I got a feeling
I got a feeling
That something's gonna be found out
Disclose the secrets
Isolated for so long

Disclose the secrets
Isolated for so long
