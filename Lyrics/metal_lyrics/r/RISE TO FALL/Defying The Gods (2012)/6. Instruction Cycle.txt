I demand every single treasure
All that's being desired
Fearless to the unexplored
I'll find unsuspected routs

I'm gaining a new insight into this...
Instruction cycle
I've been patient long enough
Now it's time to blaze a trail

[Chorus:]
I'll do it my way
Stay behind the fence and learn
Now do it your way
Show me off your best talents

Brace yourself
Decadence comes again
Don't let it win

You have it within
Don't let the force slip out of your hands
In this starless twilight
Will you be up to the task?

[Solo]

All you've been craving for
Comes into sight just in front...
Of your eyes
No place for the diffidence
All the progress must be shown...
Self restyling

[Chorus:]
I'll do it my way
Stay behind the fence and learn
Now do it your way
Show me off your best talents

[Chorus:]
I'll do it my way
Stay behind the fence and learn
Now do it your way
Show me off your best talents
