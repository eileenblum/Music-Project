When you first found me
I was a grub
Suffocated in silk
A bud that couldn't blossom
A poor snail trapped in its shell

Your innocence
And purity
Were wiser than all my experience
And when I tried your elixir
I thought to myself
That was the only way I could subsist

[Chorus:]
I feel I'm lost in oblivion
The thought of you and me
I fear it could be
A simple shard inside your trunk
My aura stars to wilt
And now I'm alone
Could I fly on my own?

Obliged to be the commander
Nothing to justify the absence

[Chorus:]
I feel I'm lost in oblivion
The thought of you and me
I fear it could be
A simple shard inside your trunk
My aura stars to wilt
And now I'm alone
Could I fly on my own?

You saw the worst in me
And then you vanished without trace
I've been chasing you
I hope next time I'll be wiser
I feel I'm lost in oblivion!

[Chorus:]
I feel I'm lost in oblivion
The thought of you and me
I fear it could be
A simple shard inside your trunk
My aura starts to wilt
And now I'm alone
I can fly on my own!
