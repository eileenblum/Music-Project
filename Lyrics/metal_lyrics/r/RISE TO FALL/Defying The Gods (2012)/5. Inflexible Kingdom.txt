In search of perfection I built my own...
Inflexible kingdom
I am so exigent with all that comes
I can hardly taste the new day

Stuck in a sole thought
I never change direction
Afraid that everything I've fought for
Will turn into dust

It's bleeding
(It's bleeding)
Not healing
(Not healing)
An inner wound is born
Untie the strap that fastens
You to this immobile state

So protected in my armored suit
Is it worth it hiding behind the mask?
Disappointed not to find anything to be satisfied with
Am I mental or is it that I don't wanna stop the search?

[Chorus:]
You say I waste too much time
With the small details
But there's where I really find
My own perfection code

There's nothing blinder
Than the eyes that don't want to see

[Chorus:]
You say I waste too much time
With the small details
But there's where I really find
My own perfection code
