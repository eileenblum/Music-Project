Here comes another chance from fate
A new beginning
The price we must embrace
Like lambs to the slaughter
We couldn't deal
But now we have the method
To turn this inside out

A red light blinks intensely
Is warning
A bleeding
The thoughts that break the harmony
Must be modified
We have to design
A better way to live

[Chorus:]
Hear my yell
We gotta ascend to the throne
Nothing to lose by trying

We've got the key to open the vault
Just look inside and make
The sparkle burn

A red light blinks intensely
Is warning
A bleeding
Approaching fast

[Chorus:]
Hear my yell
We gotta ascend to the throne
Nothing to lose by trying
We gotta ascend to the throne
Nothing to lose by trying

Suddenly something
Which you can't explain makes you burst out
Your whole being adjusts to a new frequency
The new sun is about to shine
The shadows will be left behind

[Chorus:]
Hear my yell
We gotta ascend to the throne
Nothing to lose by trying

[Chorus:]
Hear my yell
We gotta ascend to the throne
Nothing to lose by trying

Hear my yell
The new kings knock at the door
Wear the suit of the victory

Hear my yell
The new kings knock at the door
Wear the suit of the victory
