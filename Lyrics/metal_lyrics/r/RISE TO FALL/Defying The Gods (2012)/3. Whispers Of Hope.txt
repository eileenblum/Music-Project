Make me believe I'm not just a pawn
I don't belong to their greedy game
Tell me I'm the one who controls this
The dice don't take me to the next square

Whispers of hope
Invade my home
Make me wiser in this epoque
Whispers of hope
Now light the room
Make me wiser in this uncertain epoque

[Chorus:]
You are the one
The true self will help you find
A way to break the spiral
The wind of chance
Sweeps the leaves to let you find
The hidden path

With fury your steps are predictable
Learn how to control the power
Which makes you carry on to a final death

Whispers of hope
Invade my home
Make me wiser in this epoque
Whispers of hope
Now light the room
Make me wiser in this uncertain epoque

[Chorus:]
You are the one
The true self will help you find
A way to break the spiral
The wind of chance
Sweeps the leaves to let you find
The hidden path

[Solo]

I lead my life
Alternatives come out
I lead my life
I won't know defeat

[Chorus:]
You are the one
The true self will help you find
A way to break the spiral
The wind of chance
Sweeps the leaves to let you find
The hidden path
