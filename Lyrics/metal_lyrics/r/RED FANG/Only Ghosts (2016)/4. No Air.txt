How did I end up here? Watch my soul disappear
All I want's away, away from you
Why did this hated son let his whole life be thrown down a hole made by you?

You are the enemy, tear you apart

Owning the land and sea, drain all that's good in me
All I want's away, away from you
How did I end up here? Watch my soul disappear down a hole made by you

You are the enemy, tear you apart

(you are not anyone to me)

Burn all your photographs
Black books to ash
Kill all your memories
Bury the past
Yesterdays fade away
I built a wall
Empty out all of it
Empty it all

Now that you're dead to me
I can stand up
Someone I used to be finally woke up
Now that you"re dead to me
Now that you're dead

(you are not anyone to me)

No air!
