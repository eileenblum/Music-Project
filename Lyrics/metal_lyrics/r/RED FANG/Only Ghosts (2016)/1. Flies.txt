Down like a dog, can't take it no more
I'm playing house, the house is burning
I wanna see something in me
I wanna be a life worth saving

You know that I can't sleep
I've been awake for weeks
And someone's dying
They sing a funeral song
The celebration's on
'Cause someone's dying

Stick of the pin, our lives are over
Staying in line till we run out of time
Apologize for being alive
Apologize but why would you care

You know that I can't sleep
I've been awake for weeks
And someone's dying
They sing a funeral song
The celebration's on
'Cause someone's dying

Down like a dog, can't take it no more
I'm playing house, the house is burning
I wanna see there's something in me
I wanna see your fucking funeral
