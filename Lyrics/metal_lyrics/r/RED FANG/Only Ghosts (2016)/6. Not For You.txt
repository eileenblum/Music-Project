We share this shimmering black pain
Our pride and joy in suffering
HÃ¼zÃ¼n, hÃ¼zÃ¼n I call your name
I know you know we are the same

He wants it all
She wants it all
They want it all
but there's a wall

He wants it all
She wants it all
They want it all
But they will falter

We swim the sea of suffering
Bathed in the joy of our black pain
HÃ¼zÃ¼n, hÃ¼zÃ¼n I call your name
I know you know we are the same

He wants it all
She wants it all
They want it all
but there's a wall

He wants it all
She wants it all
They want it all
But they will falter

He needs her closer
(like anybody else)
And she's longing, too
(like anybody else)
But she's made her mind up
(like anybody else) and it's
Not for you

You gotta find your way out
This ain't working out
You gotta find your way out
It's not working

You gotta find your way out
This ain't working out
You gotta find your way out
It's not working

It's not working
It's not working
Out

He wants it all
She wants it all
They want it all
but there's a wall

He wants it all
She wants it all
They want it all
But they will falter

He needs her closer
(like anybody else)
And she's longing, too
(like anybody else)
But she's made her mind up
(like anybody else) and it's

Not for you
