Been living in lye 
staying low 
these words are a lie 
like a knife down my throat 
killing myself 
take control 
locked in a cell 
don't like this inside me 

[Chorus]
No matter what you do 
It's gonna get you anyway 
No matter what you think you're mine 
Don't care what you say 
No where no way you get out 
No matter what you do you're mine 

In love with the lie 
So sick down below 
No love for the lie 
It wants to destroy 
Wasting alone 

Burned out, no control 
Fuck you to that lie that's living inside me 

[Chorus]

Wasting this day 
Wasting inside 
Fade away 
It's not in me 
Fade away 
Deny 

[Chorus]

You know you just can't slow down 
You know you just can't slow down 
You know you just can't slow down 
Dig your six feet down 
[2x]
