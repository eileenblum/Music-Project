How can you give her a name? 
When blood and body are the same 
To take a breath for her 
To make a home for you 
We are the only ones she knew 

[Chorus]
rapture 
is calling 
to master 
rule of three 

She's nameless and faceless 
Her eyes are my eyes 

She hears me and feels me 
I fail her, she saves me 

How can you just fade away? 
Away, without a shadow trace 
The 3 in we that has freed me to be weak 
The joy and sadness of the deep 

[Chorus]

Ecstatic narcosis 
You hide it inside me 
The rapture, 3 calling 
To master the path of we 

[Chorus]

She's nameless and faceless 
Her eyes are my eyes 

She hears me and feels me 
I free her, she frees me 

Ecstatic narcosis 
We hide it inside us 

The rapture of the deep 
Three master the path of we
