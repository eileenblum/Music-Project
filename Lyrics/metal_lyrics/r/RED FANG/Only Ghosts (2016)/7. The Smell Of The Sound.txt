Body of water 
Lightning for eyes 
You and I
Somebody's daughter 
Some mother's son 
We are one
You are 
That's all that you are that's all that you are 
I am 
That's all that you see, all that's left of me 
We are
Oh, you will never be alone now 
I am always there [2x]
Somebody's daughter 
Some mother's son 
One and one
She breathes underwater 
I speak to the sea 
We are three
You are 
That's all that you are that's all that you are 
I am 
That's all that you see, all that's left of me 
We are
You are 
That's all that you are that's all that you are 
I am 
That's all that you see, all that's left of me 
We are
