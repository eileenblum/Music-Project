I'm alive now, I'm awake 
Cry your eyes out, while I escape 
I'm alive now, but I lie 
I can fly now, I take your wings 

Gonna hang you out to dry 
Gonna hang you out to dry 
Gonna make you wish you died 
I am the way out 

See the stars shine through the quake 
Grind your eyes out to your grave 
I'm alive now, I'm inside 
Cry your eyes out, this is no place 

Gonna hang you out to dry 
Gonna hang you out to dry 
Gonna make you wish you died 

I am a ghost 

I don't have a home 
Climbing down a hole 
Someone you used to know 
is dying everywhere 

I am a ghost 
I am a ghost 

Gonna hang you out to dry 
Gonna hang you out to dry 
Gonna make you wish you died 
I am a gun
