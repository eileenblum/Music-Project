[Verse]
I hid one time
But I feel new eyes
Saying nothing
Which says it all

Time for grieving
And disbelieving
Saying nothing, 'til we hit the wall

[Chorus]
You're in hell but you can't even tell
This isn't where you planned to land when you fell
Grom the sea into the swirling sky
And through the thunderbolts that took your eye

[Verse]
I take one step, with no regrets
I take two back and that's all again

Overlooked, undermined
I got left out and left behind

[Chorus]
You're in hell but you can't even tell
This isn't where you planned to land when you fell
From the sea into the swirling sky
And through the thunderbolts that took your eye

[Verse]
Black cold eyes
Hopes held high
Dark red sky
Souls on fire
Electric wires
Funeral pyres
