I think I got a reason, I don't think I don't try
I think I got a reason, and I'll piss in your sky
I think I got a reason, I think I don't try
I think I got a reason, and I'm ready to die

Winters come and the sun hasn't shown his face it all
Every time that he wakes medicates with alcohol
He's depressed, it's the best time of year to end it all
Take a half dozen pills plus a fifth that equals problem solved

I think I got a reason, I don't think I don't try
I think I got a reason, and I'm ready to die

Winters here kick it off with a cough and a cigarette
Your poor bodies done, dying lungs, spewing blackened breath
Go ahead take a drink if you think it will ease your mind
You knew it never could, does it feel really good to die? Yeah.....

That which was never good, will never good go bad
That which was never good, will never good go bad
Best thing you never had
