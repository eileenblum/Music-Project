Don't fail me, don't fail me now [2x]

You take the lies I give to you
You take them all to make them true
Now the soil has turned face down
What is that sound? There ain't nothing around

Don't fail me, don't fail me now [2x]

Backing down in my darkest place
The chains on the ground are the lines in my face
Scratch on the wall is a ghost of you
You make them all and make them true

You don't know me, but you will

It's something else I'm feeling
There's something wrong
It's something else that we found out

You don't know me, but you will

A seething mass has gone to ground
To let it sleep I kill my town
Bar the door. Sink away
It's alive. It's too late

You don't know me, but you will
