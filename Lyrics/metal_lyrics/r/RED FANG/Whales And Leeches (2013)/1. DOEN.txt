Winter is your doom
Sunset comes too soon
In lands of midday black
Undead hordes attack

Bells of death toll
Chaos unfolds
Humans bled dry
No one survives

Winter is your doom
Sunset comes too soon
Endless feasts of blood
Where there is no sun

Bells of death toll
Chaos unfolds
Humans bled dry
No one survives
