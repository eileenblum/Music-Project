We've come so far away from home
The days and nights are all the same
It's so insane to be alone
With all the time I gave away

You walk behind the light
You walk behind it
You won't defend the lie
You'll never make it...

With hardly any hope to grow
You've got a contract with a hole
Carry that weight until the end
You've got no fight to win

These times you would erase
These times of sorrow
You want it to be safe
You want it to be...

Now you've come to see
What you're wanting
What you need from me
You want me dying...
