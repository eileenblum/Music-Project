I refuse to sleep
I will not eat
I'm drowning in my bed

Bind her hands to mine
And make her blind
She's lost the rest of time

Babe, frothing at the teat
Carry him to me
His blood like cream

Stars that fade away
Their light will dissipate
And carve another name

[Chorus x2:]
Cut it up
Cut it up
Cut it up
Just before I take it

Paint your lips with blood
And clean your eyes
You've stripped away the skin

Babe, frothing at the teat
Carry him to me
His blood like cream

[Chorus x2]

Cancer of thinking
Thinking
You've left behind
All that
You're wasting
Wasting away

[Chorus x2]
