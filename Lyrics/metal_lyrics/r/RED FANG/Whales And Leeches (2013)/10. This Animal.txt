The captain's weary
She's lost in wine
The ship is listing
With a broken spine
Home system calling
No husband now
The galley's holding
The end of us all

[Chorus:]
It's in us all [3x]
It's in us all, this animal, it's in us all
It's in us all [3x]
It's in us all, this animal, it's in us all

All hands gone missing
Blood banks are dry
Dead vessel screaming
An empty hull
Adrift in silence
Breathe breath no air
All comms are hissing
In space so cold

[Chorus]
