Wanting eyes, they were burning green
Trying to see what cannot be seen
Where no wind blows
Where no grass grows
Hold a thought for the ones we leave behind

Crawl away on an empty plain
Fallow earth that will cover me
Where no wind blows
Where no grass grows
Every little twist is what it seems

She's awake but she's not alive
Final daughter of another time
Where the grass grows
Where the wind blows
Crying out with a voice that is not mine
