My nervous system
Wrapped so tight
Bones so brittle
I bleed inside
Face is burning
Hands so cold
Now your excuses
Are getting mighty old

[Chorus:]
No hope no, no going home x4

The creep is crawling
Deep below
He likes me better
When I lose control
Burning bridges
Digging holes
His words are poison
They're all I know

[Chorus]

You're not so pretty
Your heart's so cold
Your jokes aren't funny
Your souls been sold
You're not so smart
There's a crack in your smile
Your shit won't fly
You're a useless pile

[Chorus 2x]
