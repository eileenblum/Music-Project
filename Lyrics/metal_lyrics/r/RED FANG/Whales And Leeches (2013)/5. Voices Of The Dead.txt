It feels so strange
To be erased
Why was I
All that remained

Look what we've made
A shit parade
Buried in it
Can hardly breathe

Eyes so weak and skin so grey
Dying voices sing to me
Eyes so weak and skin so grey
Dying voices sing to me

Mountains fall and oceans rise
Build the world and watch it die

No gods to praise
No flags to raise
Kids in the sky
Won't make the grade

It feels so strange
To be erased
There is nothing
Nothing to save

Eyes so weak and skin so grey
Dying voices sing to me

Mountains fall and oceans rise
Build the world and watch it die
