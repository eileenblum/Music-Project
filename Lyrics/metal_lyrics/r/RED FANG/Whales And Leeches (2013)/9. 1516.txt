Scan the seas
Deep below
Drought of life where we
Plot our course

There's no way out
God will not answer
There's no way out
Damn all who enter

Dusty deep
Grey reefs swarm
Water's warm, but our
Bodies freeze

Bathed in rust
Losing sleep
Now to leap into
Burning fire

There's no way out
God will not answer
There's no way out
Damn all who enter

AFIRE!
AFIRE!
AFIRE!
AFIRE!
