[feat. Mike Scheidt from Yob]Staring searching
A shell of a shadow
Tried so hard to be right
Becoming so wrong
Until nothing was left
And nothing was right

I still hear
The clash of weapons
Disguised as words
So easy to begin
So hard to end
So easy to begin
And so hard to end

Dawn
Dawn rising
Sun shine burning
Feels like defeat

An empty zero
Living flatline
It felt like misery
The truth that set me free
The world a mirror
Bloodied and broken

Screaming riot
Screaming riot riot
Until nothing was left
And nothing felt right
'til nothing was left
And nothing felt right

Dawn
Dawn rising
Sun shine burning
Feels like defeat

An empty zero
Who lives in flatline
It felt like misery
The truth that set me free
The world a mirror
Broken, bloodied and cracked

Screaming riot
Screaming riot
Screaming riot
