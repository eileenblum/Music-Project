Cold swells below now it's all he knows
Don't fight the water, the undertow
Can't save his daughter, and down she goes
She calls to him and slips below
She calls to him

He has no answer for all her pain
Something is growing inside her brain
Can't dry her eyes for the pouring rain
Watching her die made him insane
Made him insane
