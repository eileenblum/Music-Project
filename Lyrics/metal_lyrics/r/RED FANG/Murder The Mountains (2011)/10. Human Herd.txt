We've set our minds to taking the babe from your arms
Our greatest fear is never to bring him to harm
It's hard to see his flowing, golden hair
For the light that's blinding us with market share

[CHORUS:]
You can't protect him from his life
We'll find a way to make you lie
He'll be with us and never die
This is the end and you know why

Out to the water you let us hold him down
They never struggle when they want to drown
They take so much from us without a word
Just a little thing we ask from the human herd

[CHORUS x2]
