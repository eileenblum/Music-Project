Kid, don't lose your cool,
It's still too soon
To have to choose
A brighter doom

It's hard to believe, but I can see
How there could be
So little left to lose
(cracking open skulls like cans of beans on Christmas Eve)

Mama's not okay,
She lights a candle for every day
That you're away

Today could be the one
She burns the motherfucker down
Her final act of grace
In a pointless, endless race.

Kid, you're under fire,
Your life is coming down to the wire
Maybe you'll take the Captain's hand,
Carry his ship through burning sands
Cradle your rifle like a man

Mama she says, "No way,"
She's lost it all, so, you've got to stay
To make her pay
She knows the fiend upon the throne's
A goddamn sucker for the stone
Until the day he dies alone

Succumb....
