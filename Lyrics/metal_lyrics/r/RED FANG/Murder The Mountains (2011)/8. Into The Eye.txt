I don't like what I'm feelin'
and I'm falling apart
Your floor is my ceiling
until I can't see your face any more.

You rise high above me
and signal the end
the mirror ignores me
and now I just want this day to end.

We got hell, we need seed
see the light when you drink what i bleed
we got gods, that you know
now in darkness our numbers will grow

The days pass unending
a scratch at the door
I just keep pretending
that I can't see your face anymore

Their eyes are upon me
I've been chased to the end
They draw me in slowly
Until I don't have a face anymore

We got hell, we got seed
See the light when you drink what I bleed
There you are, bent so low
In our arms now we reap what we sow

There was no need to worry
My soul is a star
They always surround me
and now I can't see
your face anymore
