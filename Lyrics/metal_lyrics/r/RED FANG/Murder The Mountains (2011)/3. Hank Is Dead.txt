Burn the flesh that
had long been rotten
He is gone, but he's not forgotten
Save his name, but don't replace
The time you spent to make his place
He's the only one to keep alive

Here they come again
With their bloodshot eyes
Leave the promised land
Shed your earthly skin

Left alone in a tiny capsule
He's the king of an empty castle
Went away to fill a grave
And made you stay a human slave
Never got to meet the son of mine

Here they come again
With their bloodshot eyes
Leave the promise land
Shed your earthly skin
