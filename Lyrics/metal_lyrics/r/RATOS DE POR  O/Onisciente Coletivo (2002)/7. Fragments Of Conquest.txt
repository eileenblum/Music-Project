Keep in the line
Play-acting ability
Working to blind(us)
Claim responsability

Doomed to repeat
(The)same old mistakes
Again and again

Spread to death
Support the plan
Make connection
Cumplicity

Look at past
There a nothing left to say
No turning back
It will come clean someday

Doomed to repeat
(The)same old mistakes
Over again

Spread to death
Support the plan
Make connection
Cumplicity

-Pretending sanity-

History proves
Proves it all through time
Rebuild your mind
Find weakness through their lifes

And never repeat
The same old mistakes
Not once again

Destroy the culture
Learn through control
Disconnect
Sucesfully
