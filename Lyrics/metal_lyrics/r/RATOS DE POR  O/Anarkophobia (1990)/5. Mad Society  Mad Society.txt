Sometimes I listen to many voices in my head
Voices insist on telling me I'm dead
Towards this mad society I'm no one
But i'm alive to fight against your clan
Back to mad society
I see only war and injustice in my way
The weskers are losers and can't react

It turn my in to weapons against these pigs
Now my attitude is clear and made of revolt
Mad society, alienation
Brutal force, obliteration
Whit out money in your life
you'd better die
paranoia, exploitation
Persecution, hallucination
No peace in your life
You'd better fight
My heart aches when I look around
indifferents people go on with their lifes
They're part of this mad society
1 feel lonely and my power is all gone
Back to mad society
