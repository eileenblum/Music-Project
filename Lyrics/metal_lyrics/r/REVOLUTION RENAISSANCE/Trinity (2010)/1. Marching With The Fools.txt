Day by day spreading darkness and fear
Carrying the uniform they made us wear
The sand in the hourglass wasting away
To neon madness that's fading to gray
nother face in the crowd
We watch the caravan

Enemies joining their hands together
Our world's a beautiful place to be
Slaves to the grind in this jungle forever
Since we are born we are trapped and betrayed
We're told that we could never be number one

Marching with the fools
Following their rules
Merciless unfeeling world

Marching with the fools
We became their tools
Led like lambs to the slaughter
Just obey and you belong
