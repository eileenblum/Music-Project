When love beckons to you, follow him,
Though his ways are hard and steep,
And when his wings enfold you yield to him,
Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.
And when he speaks to you believe in him,
Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind
lays waste the garden.

Years have passed us by
And yet we can't find inner peace
We grieved, we cried
The grass springs from the perished seed

Long dark winter night
Begging for sun to shine
We've lost our sight, our souls, our dreams

How it's meant to be?
Will we ever find our way out of here?

You wake up every morning
And choose a new disguise
To find your piece of easy street
To find a better life

Day by day you lose your hope
Day by day you lie
Blaming all the ones you love
Leaving them behind

I know it's not easy when faith's running dry
Nowhere to cling on and nowhere to hide

I wish I had someone to show me
A way I could see life again through my lost inner child's eyes
But I'm so afraid

Trinity, Trinity, purify me
Trinity, Trinity, heal my wounds
Trinity, Trinity, free my spirit
Trinity, Trinity, rescue me
Trinity, Trinity, change my life
Trinity, Trinity, save my soul

Long is the road
When you've walked on your own
Time's passed me by
I just know I've survived

Long is the road
When you've lost all you truly love
And when I shall die,
Please cut me into little stars

To the blue shores I go
Back to where I once belonged

Make a new start
Leave my past all behind

Rise with the flame
That's been frozen inside

Shed the tears and reborn in light

Trinity, Trinity...
