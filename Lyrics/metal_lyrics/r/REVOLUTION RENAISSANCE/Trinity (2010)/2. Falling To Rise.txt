It all turned into a nightmare
I still remember
When you said goodbye, so long

Why didn't it last forever
Like a graveyard stone?
Why did you leave me alone?

I just couldn't face my fears
The lowest of low, I've been already here

Falling to rise
The only way out from the point of no return
Falling to rise
Like phoenix I fly high towards the sun
I'm falling
I'm falling

Scars remain forever
To tell what you've been through
Wounds that will never leave you

Only the strong survive
So they always say
But no one knows what's going on inside of you

It's been too long I've shed my tears
My turn has come, I'm out of here

Falling to rise
The only way out from the point of no return
Falling to rise
Like phoenix I fly high towards the sun
I'm falling
