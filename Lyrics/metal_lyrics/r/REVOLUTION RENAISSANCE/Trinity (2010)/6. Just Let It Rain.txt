We've seen it all, still standing tall
We've stood our backs against the wall
We've sailed the seas of uncertainty
Riding the waves of freedom
Just let it rain our lives are not in vain
Tonight we forget the crushing pain
Turning the page to a new dawning day
Don't go insane
Just let it rain
We've swam in tides of memories
We've all got scarred in the fight
We have desire, burning so bright
Now it's the time we can make things right
Just let it rain our lives are not in vain
Tonight we forget the crushing pain
Turning the page to a new dawning day
Don't go insane
Just let it rain
