Feel the rain running down your face
Feel the pain drowning you in disgrace
All your life in your darkest fears
Only you are living for is only dying
You been sleeping for a thousand years
You can share in all those lonely tears
Frozen inside with a touching love
Only your last breath safe inside of yourself
Open your eyes you are not the only one
Waiting, praying over the sun
Keep on dreaming never close your eyes
Why? Why? Can't you see, you are a lot like me
A lot like me
See the rainbow, is easier to breath
All your nightmares distant past have gone
Feel the new world it' is whispering to you
Is waiting for you and everything that you can do

Open your eyes you are not the only one
Waiting, praying over the sun
Keep on dreaming never close your eyes
Why? Why? Can't you see, you are a lot like me

[Solos]

Open your eyes you are not the only one
Waiting, praying over the sun
Keep on dreaming never close your eyes
Why? Why? Can't you see, you are a lot like me
Open your eyes you are not the only one
Waiting, praying over the sun
Keep on dreaming never close your eyes
Why? Why? Can't you see, you are a lot like me
