Live the dream, each step you take
The choice is yours alone to make
Dream your dreams out of the ordinary

See that it is oh so clear
Time is right and it's so near
Turn your life into a masterpiece

They say that the sky is the limit for a
But the holy and brave are

Crossing the Rubicon It's time to seize the day
The die is cast, it's time
To cross the Rubicon

Reached the point no return
Every day so much to learn
Seeing colors no one else can see

Stand your ground and find your fate
Don't turn around it's too late
Search the Light from brand new day

They say...
