Wake up in your dream, your frozen fear
Long lost words whisper to you
Numb your spirit sleeping somewhere cold
...Praying, bleeding and screaming
All this time you have been searching for love
You're left with nowhere to go
Dreamchild
Don't let it get away
Don't let them steal your dreams
You have to hide your rainbow
Dreamchild
Don't let them kill your flame
Don't let them steal your sun
The future's yours to claim
You are frightened by what you see
But somehow you do know
There's much more to come into your life
And you will learn who you really are
All this time you have been searching for love
And now you could find your way home
Dreamchild
Don't let it get away
Don't let them steal your dreams
You have to hide your rainbow
Dreamchild
