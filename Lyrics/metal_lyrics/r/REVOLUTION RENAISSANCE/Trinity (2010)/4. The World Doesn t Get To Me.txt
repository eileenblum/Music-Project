Part of a broken machinery
The same noise is all around
Drums of war in some forgotten land
Echoing in a Christmas card

Life is a highway, we got one chance
So spread all the news don't wait

World doesn't get to me, I am who I am, who I want to be
World doesn't get to me, so don't let it get to you

Rat race is running every day
Is that the price you wanna pay?
Reality is just in TV
Plastic Christ in assembly lines

Life is a highway, we got one chance
So spread all the news don't wait

World doesn't get to me, I am who I am, who I want to be
World doesn't get to me, so don't let it get to you

The standard of newfound perfection
You're walking the walk and you're talking the talk

World doesn't...
