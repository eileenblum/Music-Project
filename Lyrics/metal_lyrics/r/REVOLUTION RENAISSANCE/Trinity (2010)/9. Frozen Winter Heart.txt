You used to dream and laugh and play
Through the night long ago
Now it all echoes endlessly
Corridors of your mind

You're watching ships that leave your shores
And some never return
Singing a song of hope to melt the rose on ice

Frozen winter heart
Light is gone, I am longing for your touch
In your frozen winter heart
Everything is so grey

Frozen Winter Heart
I am yours forever more
But in your frozen winter heart
Your song plays on and on
