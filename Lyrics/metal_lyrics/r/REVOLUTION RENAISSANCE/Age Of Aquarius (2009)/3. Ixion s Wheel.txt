Turning the wheel keeps turning Stronger
The flames are burning
Lies grow stronger each day

Bleeding the wounds are bleeding
Shedding kindred blood
Fell into your trap

It's in your eyes the guilt
It's in the lies you built
I thought I gave you everything
Still you keep wanting more
I think that you should show some gratitude to me
Instead you'll be forevermore
Bound to Ixion's Wheel
