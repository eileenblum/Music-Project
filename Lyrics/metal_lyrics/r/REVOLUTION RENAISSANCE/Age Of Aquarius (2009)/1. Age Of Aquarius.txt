Why, you were meant to be the chosen one
And still you can't see, are you blind
Days go by
The hole grows deeper as you lose the light

How many more to cry?
How many more to die?
But you can't find the Reason why

This is the final round
You've reached the very end
And now the curtains fall
There ain't no time to change
Welcome to the Age of Aquarius [2x]

Why is there so much hatred in your eyes?
Do you feel alone?
You pray but nothing saves
You march onto your graves
You're my ghost of fallen grace

This is the final round
You've reached the very end
And now the curtains fall
There ain't no time to change
Welcome to the Age of Aquarius
