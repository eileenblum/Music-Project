Are you trying to please me mister,
are you trying to make me be like you
Do you think you can change my point of view?

Never try to convince me mister
I never try to sabotage myself
Can't fool me like you fool everyone else

I will make you remember what you've done
How you won by my failures
You still have the best cards in your deck
But it's not over yet

Behind the mask

You think you can get away with everything
You live large and money feeds your greed
Time has come to rip out the bad seeds

I will make you remember what you've done
How you won by my failures
You had the best cards in your deck
But I'm the joker

Behind The Mask

You'd better watch your back
I've got you in my sight
I see the enemy,
Hiding behind the mask

Behind The Mask
