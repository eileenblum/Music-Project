Years spent in icy
Cage embraced by loneliness
The everlasting pain, the thorns
That wound her soul
A broken branch in wintertime
She sings her song
Inside her shell, no one will sing along
There was a time when there was dancing in the fields
She chased her rainbows 'til she saw the dying day
The innocence of days gone by faded away
Forevermore, she's never going back

So, she wears black
And she's lost in time
Every second feels just like a thousand years
So she wears black
And she walks alone
She's hopeless, trapped for all eternity
So she wears black
But there's so much more

So, she wears black
And she's lost in time
Every second feels just like a thousand years
So she wears black
And she walks alone
She's hopeless, trapped for all eternity
So she wears black
But there's so much more
So she wears black
And she looks divine
