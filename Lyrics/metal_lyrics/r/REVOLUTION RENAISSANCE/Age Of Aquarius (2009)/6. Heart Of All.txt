Everywhere I go; it is waiting for me there
Everywhere I look a flash of eternity
Is everyone so blind that they can't see
Why it feels, like I'm dreaming

The heart of all
In wind and in rain
The heart of all
In my darkest pain
The heart of all, protect my soul

A miracle, universe so beautiful
How come?
Why I'm here?
An accident or just a freak?
I don't know
But all my life I have been searching for something
Drifting around like a leaf in the wind
Still now I feel like I am coming home
First time I feel like
I am free

The heart of all
Heal my bleeding wounds
The heart of all
Take me in your arms X 3
The heart of all
When darkness fills the land
The heart of all
Take me by the hand
The heart of all, protect my soul

I am you (The heart of all)
I am you, you are we, we are them and they are you
And in the night of darkest fight
We won't let you be alone
The heart of all
