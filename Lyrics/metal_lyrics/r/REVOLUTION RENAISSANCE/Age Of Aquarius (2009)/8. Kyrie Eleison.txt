Father, look what I've done
Is there a way to forgive?
From the depths of darkness
My soul reaches out to you

In my darkest hour
Be my shelter
Be my guide
Don't leave

Kyrie Eleison
Set me free
Teach my soul to fly
I am yours forevermore
High above lies my home
Lord have mercy
Kyrie Eleison

High above lies, cradle of our hearts
Show me the way in the valley of the dark
Lord have mercy, don't let me go
Stay with me til the end of time
