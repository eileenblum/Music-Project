A new Day is dawning
Feel the rays of the sun caressing your skin

A new way to move on
Leave your worries behind
And enjoy the ride

We are angel and beast
We're blind, but we see

We are screaming in silence
And dreaming in color, we're fire

Here we stand at the crossroads
Facing our destiny
Here we are all together
We believe endlessly
There is nothing that ever could tear us apart
Carrying the Flame,
We're the Children of future

New era is calling
Singing hymns to life
In the Age of Aquarius

We are angel and beast
We're blind, but we see
We are screaming in silence
And dreaming in color, we're fire

Here we stand at the crossroads
Facing our destiny
Here we are all together
We believe endlessly
There is nothing that ever could tear us apart
That's who we are,
We're the Children of future
