Danced on broken glass
To the songs you sang
To the beats you played

On a winter day
You came into my life
I'd never let you go

I screamed in the dark
What do you mean?
I loved you
You left me
I gave you my soul
Feel my wounds
You weren't there
I'll be everywhere
You have my silence forever
Remember to forget me

She dances in the dark
She's light without the spark
The fallen angel, cast away
The daughter of Elysium

The nature of her beast
She celebrates her feast
She's my dream that's not real

Lighting candles in the pouring rain
Once upon a time
Dominoes in a hurricane

Roses I brought to your grave
So, I bless your sins my beloved

She dances in the dark
She's light without the spark
The fallen angel, cast away
The daughter of Elysium

The nature of her beast
She celebrates her feast
She's my dream that's not real
