[Music: Tolkki / Lyrics: Tolkki]

Born from the spark that once started this all
We're standing here before the creation
Look for the Answers, we'll find them all here
Witness the birth of the digital god

Soon there will be no more damnation
And there will be no more pain

We are magic, we are starlight
We are children of the night
We are shining, here forever, we will be

We are magic, we are stardust
Just reflections of eternity
Endless Circle, here forever
We will be...cause we are magic
