[Music: Tolkki / Lyrics: Tolkki]

I am reaching out from nowhere
Telling truth about myself
Many Mountains i did climb
Many roads did I travel
I was teaching words of wisdom
I was speaking words of love
But those words got very twisted
By the powers that be
I was married to Mary
We had Children we had home
I was never crucified, I was just a human being
Was a healer and a teacher, not Son of God
But they used me for their purposes and that's why

You are born upon the Cross
Gold help you all
Born upon the Cross
Darkness has won
