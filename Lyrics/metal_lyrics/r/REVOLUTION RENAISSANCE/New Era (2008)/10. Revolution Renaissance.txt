[Music: Tolkki / Lyrics: Tolkki]

When the sun's setting down
Many answers I find
To the questions I'm
Asking myself

And the children still play
To the dying day
Without knowing what
Is awaiting

Nobody cares
It's all the same
Darkness prevails, it's getting
Worse each passing day

There's no return
The change is near
The great divide is coming
Sooner than you know

The price we will pay for
Our greediness is not worth it
Just look ahead and prepare
For a new kind of way

[Chorus:]
Revolution, evolution
Revolution renaissance
Revolution, evolution
Finding our way back to light
Revolution, resolution
Revolution renaissance
Revolution, resolution
Out of the darkest night

What you say to a child
That has 2 days to live
When you play with your
Brand new computer?

Are you closing your eyes?
Saying: what can I do?
Like the rest of the lambs
On the leash?

It's time to change
It's our last chance
We're standing in the crossroads
And it's all up to us

It has begun:
The countdown
What we don't understand
Is we are all one

Disobey, don't co-operate
With evil...
And understand:
Nothing is what it seems

[Chorus]

[solo: Tolkki]

[Chorus x2]
