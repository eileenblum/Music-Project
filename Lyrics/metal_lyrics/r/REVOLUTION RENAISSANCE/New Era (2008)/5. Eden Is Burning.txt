[Music: Tolkki / Lyrics: Tolkki]

Where is the conscience of the world?
We are the keepers of its flame
Why we just don't see what it happening?
Cause we will be the ones who have to pay
Man against another man I see
Whole creation fighting endlessly
When will we learn to give?
And learn to live?
cause we are the conscience of the world

What if we'd turn around?
Eden is burning
There is no time to play
Eden is burning
Is there another way?
Cause Eden is burning
The price is too hard to pay
Cause Eden is burning
