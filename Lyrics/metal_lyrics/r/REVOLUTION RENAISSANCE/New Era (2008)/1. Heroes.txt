[Music: Tolkki / Lyrics: Tolkki]

When things are bad don't know what to do
The answer is inside of you
Reality hits so hard everyday
Still there is so much you can do

Have faith in yourself, have faith in your life
Cause everything will be okay
Don't listen to them, don't listen to fools
And things that they don't want to see

Worlds keeps turning
While your heart is burning
Don't surrender to despair
Carry on

We are Heroes in the Night
On our Way into the Fight
We are Warriors of Light
and our Hearts are pure

We will fly into the Rainbow
Leave the worries far behind
We just follow our hearts
Cause we are Heroes
Heroes of this Life
