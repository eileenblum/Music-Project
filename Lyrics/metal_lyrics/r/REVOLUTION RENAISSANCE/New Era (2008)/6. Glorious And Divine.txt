[Music: Tolkki / Lyrics: Tolkki]

Look in the mirror and tell me what's the latest fashion news
See all the lotions and potions and shampoos for you to use
Don't let them slip away for another day, so use your card

Beauty hand cream shiny blond
Anti wrinkle too
Perfect bronzer, body butter
Self tanning cream

Healthy glow for facial skin
All these things you do
So you will be glorious and divine

Then if I once dare to look at you suddenly I am rude
I'm like the others and probably I just want to fuck you
And besides I'm late, hairdressers don't wait, but give me a call

Beauty hand cream shiny blond
Anti wrinkle too
Perfect bronzer, body butter
Self tanning cream

Healthy glow for facial skin
All these things you do
So you will be glorious and divine

[Guitar Solo]

Beauty hand cream shiny blond
Anti wrinkle too
Perfect bronzer, body butter
Self tanning cream

Healthy glow for facial skin
All these things you do
So you will be glorious and divine

Beauty hand cream shiny blond
Anti wrinkle too
Perfect bronzer, body butter
Self tanning cream

Healthy glow for facial skin
All these things you do
So you will be glorious and divine
