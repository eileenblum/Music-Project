Hey you ordinary people with your same old instincts and trait
Your dreams and strivings are primitively monochromatic way
The sum of your stirring is lowly ranging and roving
As your brains are vacant and absolutely unequipped

The mind is alive
It's ever working machine tool
Of novel intentions
It's living implement
While you are marking time
Being mentally blind
Improve diseased reality
By means of intellect progress

The mind accelerates its run with every day
Faster and faster by the part of motion ray
With every new idea and every new respect
Aiming the myriad thin directions of world track

I've my own peculiarities in comprehension of life
Very long time ago I've plunged myself into primitive pleasure dive
Now I cognize the higher steps of thought improvement
To rationally manage the way of my existence

The mind is alive
It's ever working machine tool
Of novel intentions
It's living implement
While you are marking time
Being mentally blind
Improve diseased reality
By means of intellect progress

The mind accelerates its run with every day
Faster and faster by the part of motion ray
With every new idea and every new respect
Aiming the myriad thin directions of world track

The mind accelerates its run with every day
Faster and faster by the part of motion ray
With every new idea and every new respect
Aiming the myriad thin directions of world track
