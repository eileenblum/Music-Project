You are just bastard beasts
With a small drop of brain
Found a part of truth in life
Overfilled with blind pride

You have pissed what I feel
Equated me with yourselves
You think the world is just flock of fools
Of the same type as you

Live, Cognize, Turn
Take, Defile, Clog
Smash, Enjoy, Waste
Fail, Crash, Rot

[Solo: Serge Vai Atrocity]

You, remain as you are
Think you master your fester life
Crawl and creep till the end
Death will open your eyes

Live, Cognize, Turn
Take, Defile, Clog
Smash, Enjoy, Waste
Fail, Crash, Rot
