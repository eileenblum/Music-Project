See, this life is so strange:
Never thought of you by my side
Sometimes some ways are deranged
I'm not scared, let it ride

Squeeze me in your devoted arms,
Tell me words that I lacked to know
Cannot withstand your fatal charms,
Let the sweet madness grow.

Maybe cruel strike of fate,
Maybe dream has come true
I don't know what is that,
I just love you...

If we then gotta pass,
Hand in hand through this graceful way,
Let it be, but I swear I guess
It'd be heavenly game

Why? 'Cause I used to be
In wrong place just to waste my time...
No way out - I gotta give
To you all my heart's shine.

Maybe cruel strike of fate,
Maybe dream has come true
I don't know what is that,
I just love you...

Maybe cruel strike of fate,
Maybe dream has come true
I don't care what is that,
Just love you...
