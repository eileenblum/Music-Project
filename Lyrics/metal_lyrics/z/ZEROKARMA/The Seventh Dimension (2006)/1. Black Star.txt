Freedom of my heart
And firmness of my soul
Now play in my life
The most significant role

Got through mental confusion
Released from my mind chains
Left arrogant people
Passed bad times of pain

I've tasted success
Fortune kisses me on my way
Leading me to
The countless millions of my gain

I step on the spiders
I raze the blood-suckers
Amassing the vigour
Of my fadeless inner light

You are my black star
From galaxy unknown
From seventh dimension
Of superior matter
You've come into my game
All my points are changed
You've revealed all my scope forms
Now in my skies you are my black star

I need to amend
My confidence of true
With those who will
Ever trust in my views

My abundant bins of good
I share with my friends
The flowers of virtue
The perception of happiness
I've tasted success
Fortune kisses me on my way
Leading me to
The countless millions of my gain

I step on the spiders
I raze the blood-suckers
Amassing the vigour
Of my fadeless inner light

You are my black star
From galaxy unknown
From seventh dimension
Of superior matter
You've come into my game
All my points are changed
You've revealed all my scope forms
Now in my skies you are my black star

You are my black star
From galaxy unknown
From seventh dimension
Of superior matter
You've come into my game
All my points are changed
You've revealed all my scope forms
Now in my skies you are my black star
