I was made to fly
I reunite myself with you
Dimension of our hearts
Dementing our reasons

Two suns are merging into the one
Plasma jet transfixes
The infinite of galaxies
All senses ceased to be

Be lost in me
Go astray my fairy
I'll dwell in you forever
Swim in your love and give you mine
You are my day-star
That shines through all of my dreams
Don't hide your affection
Show me the deepness
Of your tender heart

My mesmerism begins
Till our arms are joined
Emotions are set free to burst
The super-love is reinforced

My warmth will penetrate
The corners of your soul
Our cross-fire feeling ride
Will sear us till the apex

Be lost in me
Go astray my fairy
I'll dwell in you forever
Swim in your love and give you mine
You are my day-star
That shines through all of my dreams
Don't hide your affection
Show me the deepness
Of your tender heart

[Solo: Alex]

Be lost in me
Go astray my fairy
I'll dwell in you forever
Swim in your love and give you mine
You are my day-star
That shines through all of my dreams
Don't hide your affection
Show me the deepness
Of your tender heart

Be lost in me
Go astray my fairy
I'll dwell in you forever
Swim in your love and give you mine
You are my day-star
That shines through all of my dreams
Don't hide your affection
Show me the deepness
Of your tender heart
