The golden times are passed
The only pain is felt now
Chapters remain in mind
Our grace is faded to pale

What's our air around?
Nothing but burst of clutter
What's our lot for today?
Keep rotting in the real world

If no one is to come
The rain will never stop
If no need to be
The quiet end we see
But what's done is done
And someone will come
One day it won't cease
The sun sets us free

Lord of skies in blissful shroud
Fill us with force of wit
The tree of right knowledge is open
For beauty of clear soul

The sacred apathy
Gives self-possession rise
We're always led by truth
Even when we're on the mat

If no one is to come
The rain will never stop
If no need to be
The quiet end we see
But what's done is done
And someone will come
One day it won't cease
The sun sets us free

[Solo: Serge Vai Atrocity]

If no one is to come
The rain will never stop
If no need to be
The quiet end we serve
But what's done is done
And someone will come
One day it won't cease
The sun sets us free
