Reality claps through the whole brave way
As sun keeps to give us its brightest ray
Men show one another their foolish circus
As God has used them in his hocus-pocus

As somewhere beyond dwells the highest thing
Grieving in unshaken lone eternal dream
Who'll be here the one to punch a hole
To let it in our living spherical soul

Don't ever be naive
Don't ever be blind
They'll never deceive you
Just take it off your mind

Sometimes it's so tangled
Sometimes way's just faux pas
No need to seek for sooth
The perfect waits for us

The beauty of words heaping on us
Makes us strongest and hardest thus
The claps of reality sounding around
Deafen and root us to the ground

Many emotions seeping in space
Blast your mind and wrinkle your face
Whatever that happens and occurs in life
It all displays the senseless rife

Don't ever be naive
Don't ever be blind
They'll never deceive you
Just take it off your mind

Sometimes it's so tangled
Sometimes way's just faux pas
No need to seek for sooth
The perfect waits for us

Don't ever be naive
Don't ever be blind
They'll never deceive you
Just take it off your mind

Sometimes it's so tangled
Sometimes way's just faux pas
No need to seek for sooth
The perfect waits for us
