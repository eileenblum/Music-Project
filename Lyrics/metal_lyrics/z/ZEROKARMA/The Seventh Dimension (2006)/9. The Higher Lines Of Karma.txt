Third wit motion delivers soul's deep
From tangle of mental inflexible bonds
Thought and will rise above vital demands
To be on its top by true values and wants

Intelligence seeking for progress and truth
Ethical mind tries to revel in beauty
Emotional side looks for love and delight
Will seizes our subsistence and world

Exploring the order of any capacity
Widening experience by terms of the light
Stepping forward into reign of infinity
The pure area of gladness and might
