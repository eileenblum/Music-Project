Dullness gorges all around
Penetrated into deep of mind
The indifferent neglect wins
The mechanical fight of meanings

Cold around, cold inside
Incineration of inner self
Futile thoughts, futile acts
This everlasting soul collapse

Fool don't bear your cross
Fight your fear and despair
Don't lose your sense
Let your destiny arise

Cold around, cold inside
Incineration of inner self
Futile thoughts, futile acts
This everlasting soul collapse

No one knows your destiny
Isolation - your dignity
It can only be believed
(You're) like a shadow on reality

The golden times have passed
The times of aim and courage
When warmth couldn't get cold
When cruel emptiness was unknown

I know where to find freedom
But the way to it is not easy
And I have my serious doubts
Whether I can reach it

Cold around, cold inside
Incineration of inner self
Futile thoughts, futile acts
This everlasting soul collapse

Cold around, cold inside
Incineration of inner self
Futile thoughts, futile acts
This everlasting soul collapse

No one knows your destiny
Isolation - your dignity
It can only be believed
(You're) like a shadow on reality
