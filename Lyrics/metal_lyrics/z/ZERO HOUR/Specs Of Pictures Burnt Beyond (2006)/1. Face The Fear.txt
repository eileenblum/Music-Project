Pain still remains, redirect this change, release all the rage, that's in me

Mind screams to me, useless memories, brings me to my knees, no release

Death was only a vision, away, the only direction I knew
A path forever winding down, sanity find me somehow

So here we are to face the fear
Divided minds could never see so clear
Could dreams portray the true side, before the stars surrender to light?

I feel the earth turning beneath my feet
While the clouds seem to spin above my head

So here we are to face the fear
Divided minds could never see so clear
Could dreams portray the true side, before the stars surrender to light?

Pain still remains!

Darkness gathers, strength infecting me
Emptiness controls my every need
Distant memories are all I see
Spirals downward, drowning endlessly

I hold on tightly, I'm so afraid
And to let go would be my last mistake

Close my eyes, deep breaths
Close my eyes, deep breaths

Forever changing the story told, the inner core lost forevermore (forevermore)

Slowing down, I hit the ground to face the fear (that)
The end is near
Close my eyes, reach my demise, nothing left to fear
The end is here
The end is here

Time, time is lost - not mine, the inner changing ride I live
To tell my story lost in time, I'd live again - I'd live again!

Live again!
