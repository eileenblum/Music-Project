This uphill climb, will it ever end? Something's going to die!
Kill this old man, my mouth is dry

Sweat like beads of sauder piercing my head
A staff in my hand, I'll hike through the night
I'll hike, and I'll hike, hike, something's going to die!

I'm so cold

I hear something, I'm so cold
I hear something, it's raining

I hear something, if it comes too close
Something's going to die!
I hear something, something's going to die!

At last I can see
At last I can breathe (again)
To touch the sky
At last I can see (again)

I fall down to my knees in awe
Closer to the edge I walk
To touch the sky, I raise my hands
I close my eyes, I'm not afraid

The water runs, the falcon cries
In my ears, take me away
I start to dream, then catch myself
I fall down to my knees in awe

(Edge) At last I can see
To touch the sky
At last I can breathe (again)

(I fall down to my knees...)
I fall down to my knees in awe
(Closer to the edge...)
Closer to the edge I walk
(To touch the sky...)
To touch the sky, I raise my hands
(I close my eyes...)
I close my eyes, I'm not afraid

(The water runs...)
The water runs, the falcon cries
(In my ears...)
In my ears, take me away
(I start to dream...)
I start to dream, then catch myself
(I fall down to my knees...)
I fall down to my knees in awe

Take, take me away!
Take, take me away!

(Edge) At last I can see
At last I can see
At last I can breathe (again)
