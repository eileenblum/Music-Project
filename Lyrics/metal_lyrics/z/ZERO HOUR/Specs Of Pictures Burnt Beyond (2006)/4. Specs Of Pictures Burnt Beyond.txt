The pressure, that plagues with desire, my fears alive inside

Bow down to me (Bow down to me), weak and in envy (weak and in envy),
all eyes on me (all eyes on me), dark yet adoring

My memory has faded and torn, just specs of pictures burnt beyond

Rage dies in me (Rage dies in me), fades to apathy (fades to apathy),
your muted screams (your muted screams), building endlessly

I have not wasted life, I have not died
You gave me all my life, now you take it all back

So many words of fire, so many lies

The pressure, that plagues with desire, my fate lies in limbo

Pushing me down (I'm falling), pushing me down (I'm falling)
Pounding me down (I'm dying), pounding me down (I'm dying)

I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, dying...

I need to find the words, the light
You are the one to bring down the sun that fades away

I am not your slave, let me live, understand I am a man

Breaking down these walls of life

(The last spoken words have died..I need to find the words, the light..
I'm tearing down these walls of life, to escape this deadly desire)

(..Just specs of pictures burnt beyond....)
