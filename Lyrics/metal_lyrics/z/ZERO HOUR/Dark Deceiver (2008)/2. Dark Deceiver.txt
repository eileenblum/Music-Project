Distorted pictures
Clouds my mind
Wrath and anger
You are my angel
With wings to fly
Dark deceiver
Fallen beneath
I hold on tight
A bloodbath rage
When I twist the knife
Am I insane?
Have I lost my mind?
Cuts from my blade
Strip away your life
I wake to find you
Brutalized
Lost reflection
Panic sets in
No compromise
Endless screaming
Bleeding dry
Before my eyes
Echoing through my mind
Never find
Piece of mind
Answers to reasons why
Lifeless eyes
Haunt my mind
Buried beneath
Forever asleep
(Forever asleep)
Shattered dreams
Because of me
Buried beneath
