Give me wisdom father to son
Give me wisdom father to son
For your love and knowledge insight of direction
A certain connection of love and protection
My eyes get heavy
Give me your voice and strength
(Give me wisdom father to son)
My voice grows weak
To help protect and love
(Give me wisdom father to son)
I will not fall
The rain then hits my face
(For your love and knowledge insight of direction)
For I'm reborn
A state of mind body and soul
(A certain connection of love and protection)
Live and breathe
Feel the rain shower me
Like the ocean breeze
Winds guide me
With a (spirit) traveling
Watching over me
Give me wisdom father to son
Give me wisdom father to son
For your love and knowledge insight of direction
A certain connection of love and protection
Facing west from shores
Setting sun further still
(Give me wisdom father to son)
Of land yet unfound
Subsequent exploitation
(Give me wisdom father to son)
For we are together
To protect all we love
(For your love and knowledge insight of direction)
For we are one
Unity brothers in arm
(A certain connection of love and protection)
Live and breathe
Feel the rain shower me
Like the ocean breeze
Winds guide me
With a (spirit) traveling
Watching over me
Fight within troubles me
Can't seem to face this reality
Weakening
Give me space and time to think
Need a reason to climb so high
A new creation becoming
(Overpowering)
This lonely place
Will erase
I will find a way to view the sky
So very high
I have found a way
My mother's hand
I hold at last
Brings a smile to my face
A state of grace
Forever made
(For those who hold what's true)
Worlds divide
Clouds in the sky
Pale shades of white
Brought to life
A new voice inside
Streaks across the sky
Mother, remember how I learned from you
And father all the strength in me is from you
This holy place
I wish to stay
Visions fade away
Lost inside
Reality cries
Must I have to wake
Mind is calm
Pure and strong
The will to rise remains
The road is clear
No more fear
I will find my way
Worlds divide
Clouds in the sky
Pale shades of white
Brought to life
A new voice inside
Streaks across the sky
(Paints a picture of me)
There is no part of me
Have not given
Believe me
To see across the ocean
To fly above the mountains
Is to know my love
So the lightning crashes down
The thunder quakes to shake the ground
At that moment I awake to realize
It was just a dream
Realize the passion brought to me by my own mind
So the tears start to fall
And I realize who I am
Live and breathe
Feel the rain
Shower me
Like the ocean breeze
Winds guide me
With a (spirit) traveling
Watching over me
