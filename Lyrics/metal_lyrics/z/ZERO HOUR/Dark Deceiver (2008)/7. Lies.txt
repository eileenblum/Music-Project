Think clearly (I'm thinking so clear)
For our days seem much to long
Breath deeply (I am breathing so deeply)
If you dare, I am here
Lies, no more lies, piss away the sacrifice
You could not see me
Stop dreaming (I am dreaming)
For that's what you would have me do
Not believing (I believe)
Like the ocean side erodes the passion through
Lies, no more lies
Piss away the sacrifice
You could not see me
Days pass by
My windows shake the howling winds the pounding rain outside
Days pass by
In you, all in you, in you
No!
You were the one to deny
All life presented before me
How could one have been so blind
Just a second to decide
(Days pass by)
My blood runs deep from the surface
On earth to serve my own purpose
(Days pass by) in you?
You were the one to deny me
All life presented before me
How could one have been so blind
