Twisting and turning the fire that's burning
My life to the sun
Watching the hour a sky to devour
Battles just began
Takes my soul, takes my mind
Marching straight forward the hunger controlling
I must press on
The stress from the action the burning the passion
What went so wrong?
Life has no mercy, continuously stirring
Good fortune they say as the time slips away
A better way on my own, so they say
So they write
For all that is left in me, all that you care to see
I'll give you heaven
Such a small part of me
I'll give you hell
So fill my life with faith
Bringing me down
You bring me down
Bringing me down
Bring me down
Bringing me down
You're falling!
I'll give you heaven
I'll give you hell
The passion of words and the fate of your actions and
You're falling, you're falling
You're bringing me down
Your words and your actions alone
You're bringing me down alone
Forever imprisoned by your actions
And now that I've found myself your falling down
You're falling
I'll give you heaven
You bring me hell
The passion of words and the fate of your actions and
You're falling, you're falling
