Brave young man in line with deep beliefs
Forced through generations of life? Life, life
God my strength, my soul deeply rooted
This land I live, my love? Life, life
Look beyond this troubled time, for the time is now
Look beyond your selfish needs
And carry with you all that you believe
For the life that you give in this world that we live
I give you hope
Rage
From the end of my blade to the throat of the enemy
Pain
Was the choice that was made the adrenaline blinding
My mind is screaming, visions revealing
Life fades away
This is not a dream
Daylights rising
The morning has just began
Tear drops falling
Not in vain for the fallen ones
Back home I watch
Another family cries
Wishing they had more time
Alone I watch and wait for you
I pray for you
Our father
Who art in heaven
Give me the strength I need
For my land
For my king
And for you my lord
I take my sword and drive through your heart
And watch you take your last breath
Watch it rise into the cold winter air
So now it's done
And victory is ours
I've won for you my king
So your name can carry on
Believe in me
For my heart and soul have bled for you
We will rise to a better world
Divine in truth
