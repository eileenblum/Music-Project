Stare
To stare in the eyes
Of future so bleak
Faith
To rebuild faith
Need
In the power to believe
You must lead
Lead for a better life
Rebuilding
Hope for a future
Let your voice
Voice be heard at all
End the fear
To live in unity
Silence
Strength remains
Will
Not afraid
Arms
Free we reign
Dreams guide our way
A march for change
A march for life and we stand tall
Giving your body voice and life
A march for change
A march for life and we stand tall
Giving your body voice and life
Together we'll stand
Not afraid to fall
To end our suffering
And rebuild a new world
Slaves no more
My time is now
I wait no longer
For our voices will be heard
Shadows of light
Lead us forward
Tormented souls
Seizing control
A new up rise
Bring us glory
Free we are now
We are reborn
