I breath the air I feel free I feel the sun shine on me
A new direction narrow path place unknown I've never seen
Clouds moving fades to gray there's a spirit lifting me
Mere reflection draws me near distant image as I stare
Is this a dream? Reality? A man lies before me
Eye to eye the man awakes he takes my hand pulls me in
These eyes I recognize I call to you this can't be him
He calls me son you are the light my energy I am home
I am home
