TWO EYES FLASH IN TWILIGHT TWO THOUGHTS IN RHYME
"GRAVITY'S MINE AND I'M PREPARED"
TWO FEET MEET IN RHYTHM TWO HANDS DID FIND
THE WEAK LINK THE TOWERS SHARE
BENEATH THEIR FOUNDATIONS A RIVER'S RAGE
THE DAM THAT STANDS REVEALS ITS AGE
FROM CRACKS THE WATER'S FLOWING
AND MAKES A LINE TOWARD
THE UNKNOWING
I CAN SET A FLOOD IN MOTION FOR THE ARROGANT'S PLANS
ARE ALWAYS BUILT ON SAND
LIKE THE WIND DRIVES THE RAIN THE SUBTERRANEAN WILL BRING PAIN
I CAN FEEL THE SURGE OF MADNESS IN MIND
I CAN HEAR THE MINIONS MARCHING IN TIME
I CAN TASTE THE BREATH OF FREEDOM
I'M FREE I AM FREE I AM FREE WE ARE FREE
TO ARM THE DISSIDENT AND THE DISPOSSESSED
I'LL BE THERE I WILL BE THERE
TO GIVE BACK POWER AND TAKE WHAT IT POSSESED
I'LL BE THERE I WILL BE THERE
TO LIVE OUR DREAMS AND NOT ASK WHY
WE'LL BE THERE WE WILL BE THERE
TO SCALE THE MOUNTAIN TO REIGN ON HIGH
WE'LL BE THERE WE WILL BE THERE
RELIEVE US NOW OF MISERY THE WHEELS ARE SET IN SPIN
IN MOMENTS NOW THE END BEGINS AND HERE I'LL MAKE MY STAND
TO WATCH IT
FADE AWAY FADE AWAY FADE AWAY
WATER FILLS THE WAITING EARTH AND WASHES IT SO CLEAN
SWEPT UP IN THE RUSHING WAVES NOW I FEEL WHAT I MEAN
AND I FADE AWAY FADE AWAY FADE AWAY
AND I WASH AWAY WASH AWAY FADE AWAY
IT IS STARTING
THERE'S NO STOPPING
ALL'S COLLAPSING
WHAT IS HAPPENING?
CRIES TO SCREAMS SCREAMS TO CRIES CRIES TO MOANS
FLESH TO STEEL STEEL TO FLESH CONCRETE TO BONE
WATER BLED BLUE TO RED BLOOD TO WATER
LED TO HERE LED TO WHERE? LED TO SLAUGHTER
OVERWHELMING SOUND
SWAYING BREAKING SOUND
WAILING POUNDING SOUND
CRACKING CRUMBLING SOUND
THOUGHT I COULD LOSE THE THOUGHT THAT
BROUGHT ME TO THE THOUGHT THAT
BROUGHT ME HERE TO THIS DEMISE
THOUGHT I COULD LOSE THE THOUGHT THAT
RULES US ALL AND BELIEVES THAT
ONE MUST LOSE IN ORDER TO FIND
THOUGH THE STORM INSIDE ME
GAVE ME STRENGTH TO BE A MIGHTY RIVER
I WAS STILL NOT THE TIDE
THOUGHT HE COULD FREE THE WORLD AND SO FREE HIMSELF
BUT HE WAS HIS OWN DEMISE
IT IS STILL THE DAYLIGHT COMES
BUT NOTHING MOVES NOT ANYONE
AWAKE MY BENT AND BROKEN ONES
AND COME WALK WITH ME
YOU ALL SEEM PARALYZED
HOLLOW BODIES SUNKEN EYES
BUT WE HAVE WON WE ARE ALIVE
SO COME WALK WITH ME
WALK WITH ME FOR I HAVE HEALED YOUR PAIN
I TOUCH THE GROUND MY HAND PASSES THROUGH
BUT I FEEL THE TOUCH OF ALL OF YOU
LETTING GO I SLIP INTO THE OTHER SIDE
AND YOU WALK WITH ME YOU WALK WITH ME
SENT AWAY TO A PLACE I'VE NEVER SEEN
NO FEARS OR CARES HERE ALL IS SERENE
WHERE DID I FLY AWAY TO WHERE DID I FLY AWAY?
MILLIONS OF SPIRITS HAVE BEGUN TO GATHER
IN ORDER TO BE REBORN
MILLIONS OF VOICES IN UNISON CHANTING
THAT I MUST LEAD THEM ON
I SAY "WE MUST BRING THE OPPRESSOR HERE
TO SEEK SOLACE BY MEANS OF ITS END
AND WE MUST REDEEM OUR OWN SELVES HERE
WE MUST BE SURE IT HAS NO LIFE AFTER DEATH"
WE WILL COMFORT YOU
WE WILL BRING YOU PEACE
WE BELIEVE IN YOU
WE WILL BE RELEASED
AND THEN WE'LL FLY AWAY TO A BETTER TIME
WHAT WE'LL FIND WE'LL WAIT AND SEE
IS IT MACHINE OR MAN MAN OR MACHINE
EVERY SINGLE ONE THAT SUFFERED
WANTS YOU THEY WANT YOU
STRANGE HOW WHAT I ONCE NEEDED THEY SEEK TODAY
DEATH DID NOT GAIN THEM FREEDOM SO HERE THEY STAYED
FROM WITHIN AND FROM WITHOUT REVENGE IS OURS THERE IS NO DOUBT
AND IN BETWEEN THAT AND THIS OUR OPPRESSOR WILL TASTE THE SERPENTS KISS
