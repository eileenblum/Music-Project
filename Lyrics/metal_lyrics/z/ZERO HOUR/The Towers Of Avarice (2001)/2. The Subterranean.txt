ITS PROGRESS HAS NO LIMITS
AND NEITHER DO THE EYES
OF THE SUBTERRANEN CYNIC
THE ONE WHO MUST HIDE
FOR ALL THIS TIME
HE HAS CHOSEN A WAR PATH
HE WILL END ITS GREED
FEELING BEINGS FEELING
NOTHING
I WILL SET ITS LIMIT
FOR HIS FUTURE HAS NO HOME
THE SNAKE IS IN THE GARDEN
HE GOES ON ALONE
I'M IN ITS YESTERDAYS I'VE SEEN IT RISE
ESCAPED BY THINKING TWICE I LIVE SO IT MUST DIE
I'M THE MYSTIC I'M THE ONE
I'M THE SEASONS IT'S THE SUN
I'M THE MOON YOU'RE ITS NEED
I WILL MAKE IT BLEED
I'M THE MOON IT IS THE SUN
I 'LL ECLIPSE ALL THAT IT'S DONE
I'LL BRING RENEWAL THROUGH DESTRUCTION
I WILL MAKE IT SEE
THIS IS A WARNING OF NO COMPROMISE
THE ARROGANT WILL BE MADE HUMBLE
THE IGNORANT WILL BE MADE WISE
