I hear that voice calling once again
With visions of yesteryear and rivers of  blood they shed
The times have changed but I'm steadfast
For a reign of terror the outcasts
Will be used against themselves through ignorance and lies
And so in hate my numbers grow and soon all the world will
know
A twisted universal mind a mind like mine
Back to a time when I was young a father tells an only son
You are the chosen one
And as I grew so did my hate to cleanse the land became my
fate
I became the gun
If the child grows knowing only what it's told
Then the man can learn only as his history unfolds
The roots of hatred we don't always see and so are left to
grow
Fear begins in ones center and when allowed to flow
Will cast ripples upon still waters destroying all it knows
The disenfranchised will brutalize those who are not the same
The immigrants and infidels will be the pawn in their game
And they will use you against yourself through ignorance and
lies
Hear that voice once again tie the borders
We need some order take a stand
So the politicians reach the white man
With loaded words a foot on the bible and rifle in their
hands
Return to a time when you were young
When love lit your way
And all your troubles amounted to none
But who could who could say
But still do we really ever understand how we can love the
child
But crucify the man
And do we ever really see that
"I could have been him and he could have been me"
Remember a time when you were young
When love cradled the day
And you did not know the difference between right and wrong
So who led who led the way
Now will you be the voice of reason when there's none
Who will who will sing it's song
I will
