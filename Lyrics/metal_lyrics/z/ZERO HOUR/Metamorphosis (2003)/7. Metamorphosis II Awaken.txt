The creature stirs and slowly lifts its head
Not knowing whether it's alive or dead
It sees it's reflection but cannot believe
That the thing it sees before it has not one but two bodies
I can feel you we seem joined at the spine
So this is the reason they hid their crime
Are you just a part of me or can you hear my call
We must break free my silent twin and amaze them all
Rise
We can if we try leave this hell we share
To leave to break free to get somewhere
The deed is undone and the surface awaits
But she fell from his grasp as the earth began to quake
Deeper she fell until out of sight so he was left alone to face an eternal night
