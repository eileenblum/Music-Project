Cities ablaze as we race
Through a concrete maze
Eyes ablaze
And die for a name
For heaven
In this deadly game
Tears can't quench these sands
Why fight for peace in a holy land
Night has died and with it may I
Admist wars fair the heroes lie
The smell of death chills the air
I look for myself but I'm nowhere
Deliver me my prayer
Eyes of Denial
