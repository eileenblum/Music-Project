Deep underground it lies hidden and waits
A demon seed man or beast a tragic fate
A dark secret of one thousand years
An experiment with life
It revealed a deeper fear mans eternal strife
Something went wrong so they hid the truth from it's eyes
They starved it of knowledge bound it's hands and fed it on lies
Deep in it's mind thoughts are suspended in hate
A frozen tomb earth's womb a dire state
Who am I what am I where am I
I cannot see I cannon feel I can't believe this is not real
A dark secret hidden far underground buried and left to die
But time revealed a deeper fear it was still alive
