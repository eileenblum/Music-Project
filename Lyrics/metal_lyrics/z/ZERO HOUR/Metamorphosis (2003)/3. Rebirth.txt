A Field of white reflects the light Of a rose upon a tomb
ON a cruel grey morning Alone they stand with heads
in hands They lost one they lost one along the way And they're still and they're still mourning today
Shed the tears forgive the years though it hurts to
Feel that way today No one knows why we die so live
through For there is no other way Some may
believe in things they've never seen Though we must
wake we can live the dream The reasons for the day
no one knows still we take the thorns with the rose memories they fade and now I know No matter how full the
river must grow Some may believe in things
they've never seen Though we must wake we can live
the dream Throw away the ties that bind you And all that you have heard And when you find your way
And know the meaning You can forget their words A field of white reflects the light Of a rose upon
a tomb And they're still and they're still
mourning
