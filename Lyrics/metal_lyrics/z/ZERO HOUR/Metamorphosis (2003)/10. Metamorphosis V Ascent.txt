Skin to skin upon the ocean they embrace and sink into the sea
Two became one but one had the notion
To live for their self and be free
Up from the depths a force it came the two that were one
Were now not the same one spread its wings and began to fly
One drifted away and began to die
Become yourself and all that you are 
Set your sights no matter how far
Become yourself and all that you are
Set your sights 
Set your sights no matter how far
Become yourself and all that you are
Set your sights no matter how far
Become yourself
