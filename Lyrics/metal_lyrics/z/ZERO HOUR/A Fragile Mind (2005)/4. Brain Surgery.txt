My world my life journey through time
Can't live must leave the hate behind

Pressure building inside my brain
Help me release the years the pain
Open my mind and look inside
Erase all thoughts I've denied

Don't close me up until their gone
No more agony shall linger on
When I awake I shall be free
From all haunting things that I see

Pressure building inside my brain
Help me release the years the pain

Visions slowly fading (They're fading out for me)
Memories I'm trading (I trade in to be free)
Feel them as they leave me (For all eternity)
Gone for all eternity (They leave me and I'm free)

I feel the cold sharpened steel tear above my brow
Constant pain inside my brain
My senses still alert somehow

My world my life journey through time
I live my life all thoughts behind

No more pressure inside my brain
Only torment now I'm insane
