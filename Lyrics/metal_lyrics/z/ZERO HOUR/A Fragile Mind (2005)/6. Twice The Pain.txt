I feel so empty tired of being alone
It's time I change my life and release all the shame

What lies within me my spirit colder than a stone
I'd give my life to live another life again

Ecstasy calling me I cannot hear it
Fantasy crawls on me I cannot feel it
Sanity stalking me I do not fear it
Endlessly watching me drawing me near it

Look into my eyes and see the terror inside
Every teardrop lets the pain drip down my face

My life is over, yours is there for me to take
Open up your soul, your life I will embrace

I can feel you I'm in control
I'll wake and take over your soul
Your life I'll live no more danger
I'll live your life free from anger

Ecstasy calling me I cannot hear it
Fantasy crawls on me I cannot feel it
Sanity stalking me I do not fear it
Endlessly watching me drawing me near it

Why do I feel no change
I'm feeling twice the pain
Can't bear the endless shame
The agony remains

No hope remains
I'm still the same
With twice the pain
