I wake screaming agony
You give me what I really need
Consumed by the pain I'm frustrated and drained
I'm hiding behind you my secret shall remain

You lift me away from reality
When I come down again will you be there for me

Blood strains running through my veins
When I'm with you I feel so deranged

You lift me away from reality
When I come down again will you be there for me
I need you to catch me so I can be free
When I come down again will you be there for me

The fever that I feel chills me to the bone
No more apathy I choose to be alone
Consumed by the pain I feel frustrated and drained
I can't live without you my secret shall remain

You lift me away from reality
When I come down again will you be there for me
I need you to catch me so I can be free
When I come down again will you be there for me
