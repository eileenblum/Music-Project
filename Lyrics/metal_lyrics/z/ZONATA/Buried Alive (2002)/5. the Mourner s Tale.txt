Always this sad mood,
It will break my heart
Where am I going and where have I been?

Longing for my peace of mind
Forever lost, why can't it start?
All I've seen has faded away,
It's gone, and now it has decayed.

Slowly I'm drowning in a sea of tears
Cursed for a lifetime, betrayed by life

The mourning is now over,
Gone forever with my endless fear
I can feel the poison, running cold
It's dripping from the knife.

Sorrow and pain, never-ending agony
The mourner's tale my requiem

(the) sunlight is fading,
Darkness now descends
(I) walk down the river and there he stands

A melancholic tone emerges,
A serenade that comes from his horn
Now I am gone and no one cares
Will someone of them ever mourn

Drifting away now, on an endless stream
Hollow and barren, I take farewell

A melancholic tone emerges,
A serenade that comes from his horn
Now I am gone and no one cares
Will someone of them ever mourn

Sorrow and pain, never-ending agony
The mourner's tale my requiem

Always this sad mood,
It will break my heart
Where am I going and where have i been?

Longing for my peace of mind
Forever lost, why can't it start?
All I've seen has faded away,
It's gone, and now it has decayed.

Sorrow and pain, never-ending agony
The mourner's tale my requiem
