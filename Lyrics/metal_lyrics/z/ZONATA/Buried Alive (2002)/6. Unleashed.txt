Living in silence for eons,
He's planning the end for mankind
His eyes are ablaze with fury,
Venomous gaze is scorching us all

Feeling the stench of the carnage,
Sanctuary is wiped out and lost
The beast will announce it's arrival,
The moon turns bloodred,
The seas start to boil

Dreams of freedom perish and die
Sewing the seeds of death and decay

Soaring up to the sky, demonic vultures fly
Unleashed at last he is stalking the earth,
Spreading chaos and dismay

The sky is darkening slowly
As he draws forth over the plains
Corroding our hearts with his hatred,
Barren and dead lies the ground
Where he has been
His sign will be seen on his chosen
Fire will fall from the sky
Black is the veil of destruction
The lamb lies dead, the grail is no more

Dreams of freedom perish and die
Sewing the seeds of death and decay

Soaring up to the sky, demonic vultures fly
Unleashed at last he is stalking the earth,
Spreading chaos and dismay

Soaring up to the sky, demonic vultures fly
Unleashed at last he is stalking the earth,
Spreading chaos and dismay

Beware of the gaze of the serpent,
The evil can lead you astray
Feeling the blow of the trumpets,
The sky will fall down and life will decline

Dreams of freedom perish and die
Sewing the seeds of death and decay

Soaring up to the sky, demonic vultures fly
Unleashed at last he is stalking the earth,
Spreading chaos and dismay
