Joy has been left for a reason
Order will blind me
Hand me the chance will I take it
And play the game

No need no guilt for tomorrow
Now counting down for
Ending this task shall I torment
Standing in grace

Gone I will find myself lost
And still reach the top
Yesterday was reality
Lord I will sacrifice life
Is this fear undisguised
Standing outside a fatal scene

Walking through mist and the shadows
Close to this crossroad
Choosing the way for a future
Lies in our hands

Move on don't stop nor give up
No time, no waiting
Sentenced to reach, be a dreamer
Now hear my calls

Gone I will find myself lost
And still reach the top
Yesterday was reality
Lord I will sacrifice life
Is this fear undisguised
Standing outside a fatal scene

Hope shall guide us forever
Grant me time for our answer
Patronized, fragile dreams must stay alive

Hope shall guide us forever
Grant me time for our answer
Patronized, fragile dreams must stay alive

Think what's beyond this darkness
Waiting for answers
I will believe in my future
Dreams lies within

Bring me joy, bring me freedom
Bring me some conscience
Leave me with strength and respect
Lead me through pain

Gone I will find myself lost
And still reach the top
Yesterday was reality
Lord I will sacrifice life
Is this fear undisguised
Standing outside a fatal scene

Nothing you say, will change things
Grief from within still teach me
All of my past, in vain
Dark turns to light, turns to night-time
Seduced by a life so far from here
Now desolates from within

Bring back the joy take me back again,
Away from deception and pain
I'm aware, alone we are facing the dark
Chow me the way, guide me in the storm,
Care for me bring me some light
I am awake, alone we're waiting the dark
I am awake, alone we're waiting

Hope shall guide us forever
Grant me time for our answer
Patronized, fragile dreams must stay alive
