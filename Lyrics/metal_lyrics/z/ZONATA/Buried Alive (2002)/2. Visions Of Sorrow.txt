In this hall of marbled walls in another
Dimension where time heeds no calls
It's neither day it's neither night, eternal
Twilight away from the light

Traveling through time and through space
Blinded by the grace

Shooting stars guide my way,
Cosmic tide cannot lead me astray.
Seen the signs so many times,
Stones turn to vapour and life declines.
A flash of light and all turns black,
Mountain falls and bursts with a crack.

travelling through time and through space
blinded by the grace

Visions of sorrow fill my eyes, always the
Same as i travel on through time.
Blackbrowed memories hides in the skies,
They travel inside me as
I watch another crime.

Visions of sorrow fill my eyes, always the
Same as i travel on through time.
Blackbrowed memories hides in the skies,
They travel inside me as
I watch another crime.

Shooting stars guide my way,
Cosmic tide cannot lead me astray.
In ancient tales forgotten by now,
Priests and kings pledged their vow.
So i send my curse to earth,
Forced to create a new rebirth

Traveling through time and through space
Blinded by the grace

Visions of sorrow fill my eyes, always the
Same as i travel on through time.
Blackbrowed memories hides in the skies,
They travel inside me as
I watch another crime.
