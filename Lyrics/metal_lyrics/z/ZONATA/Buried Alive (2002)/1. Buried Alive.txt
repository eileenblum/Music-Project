Afraid to feel
What's inside
Embrace my soul
In solitude

Frozen eyes
Face the fears
Rising strong
Out of control

Feels like I'm bursting into flames
Lost in hate future will be gone

Emotions strained misty eyes
Hear those silent cries

Nothing's real
I can't appear
The cold winds blow
Into my face

Feels like I'm bursting into flames
Lost in hate future will be gone

feels like I'm safe here
feels like I'm strong

Buried, Buried alive
Buried, Buried alive
