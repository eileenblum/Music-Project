The end is almost here
I am shaking with fear
Trapped inside this hell
I am lost, I'm afraid, it's the truth

The priest has now arrived
And I will not deny
The story of my life
I've betrayed, I confess, it's a shame

Take my life and end my miserable pain
Was it all in vain?
Give me strength to end my time in grace
Can you set me free?

Walking wrapped in chains
Through the chaos of blame
It's pounding in my veins
I'm lost, I'm afraid, it's the truth

Time has arrived
In the chamber I am
There is no return
I've betrayed, I confess, it's a shame
