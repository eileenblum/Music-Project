Cast in sadness, this torment's real.
I walk in shadows, my bliss is concealed.
In this hell I suffer alone
Life's betrayed me and turned me to stone.

I have crossed magic borders
Between life and death
White is the light that I see
Time and space is no longer for me
That's my destiny.

Plunged into disaster my bliss is forever
Gone and forgotten and I've left all behind.

Rising shadows, my twilight is here
(the) end of days I will not fear
Light is fading, my ending is near
Rhymes of laments are filling this sphere

I have crossed magic borders
Between life and death
White is the light that I see
Time and space is no longer for me
That's my destiny.

Plunged into disaster my bliss is forever
Gone and forgotten and I've left all behind.

Drowning in a lake of tears
I give you my farewell,
My soul is sinking deep in this well
And now I'll face my hell.

Rising shadows, my twilight is here
(the) end of days I will not fear
Light is fading, my ending is near
Rhymes of laments are filling this sphere

I have crossed magic borders
Between life and death
White is the light that I see
Time and space is no longer for me
That's my destiny.

Plunged into disaster my bliss is forever
Gone and forgotten and I've left all behind.
