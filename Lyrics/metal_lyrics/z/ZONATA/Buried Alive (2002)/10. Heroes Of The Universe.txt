We have arrived in smoke,
In fire, in brimstone
We have been born with the power
To control the world

Spreading our wings and fly over seas
Heroes of the universe
Rage for the thrill will run
To the hills for shelter

The force of the dark
Will bury your hearts in fire
We're standing strong
And no one will ever defeat us

Victims come we will embrace you
Lead your souls into damnation
The light that's inside you
Will show you the way
This the call from the universe
Search for the truth and join us

The path is now set,
The smoke has been cleared forever
This is the end, the mission is done,
It's completed
