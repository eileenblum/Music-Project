From far beyond your world
Your deeds evoked me.
On this mission I was sent to earth.
Black is the veil I wear
And so are my portents.
When you see me there is no return.

When you stare into my eyes,
You will see who I am.
I'm the last one you will see,
As I'll take you to the other side.

When I haunt you in your dreams,
The time is running short.

I listen to no pleas
And I have no conscience.
And thus I'll await your final draw.
No matter you'll hide,
I'll always find you.
And at the dusk of life, I'll be there.

Plunged into darkness
In anguish you quake.
(don't fear the reaper's blade.)
Sigh no more, feel no more,
Come with me now.
(to the eternal shade.)

Shades enclose all,
A dreamless sleep waits for you,
Shades enclose all

Plunged into darkness
In anguish you quake.
(don't fear the reaper's blade.)
Sigh no more, feel no more,
Come with me now.
(to the eternal shade.)
