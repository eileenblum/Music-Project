I am just a warrior, who is fighting for our king,
No one's getting in when I'm there.
Evil people try to take this land away from us,
I think I better give them what they need.

Try to bring the magic sword that you have got for me,
I'm told that it will take me to our victory (victory).
If I don't watch out, they'll tear me all apart, right here.

[Bridge]

They run to the castle where the king is hiding out,
The soldiers try to stop them but they can't.
I can see what the evil people are doing to my king,
I can feel my anger coming out.

Try to bring the magic sword that you have got for me,
I'm told that it will take me to our victory (victory).
If I don't watch out, they'll tear me all apart, right here.

[Solo]

I run for the leader, and I cut his head right off,
The others got so scared so they took off.
Now the king is safe again, he gives me all his gold,
But I cannot accept it, I'm a warrior.

Try to bring the magic sword that you have got for me,
I'm told that it will take me to our victory (victory).
If I don't watch out, they'll tear me all apart, right here.

[Solo 2]

Try to bring the magic sword that you have got for me,
I'm told that it will take me to our victory (victory).
If I don't watch out, they tear me all apart, right here.
