Why do you ever run away from me?
Will I be a target?
You have something that bother me so much,
You have the glory.

I have always been searching for the fame,
And also the glory.
I have never succeeded by myself,
That's why I'm running after you, after you, after you, after you!

Glory and fame are the only things I want,
Glory and fame are the only things I want.

[Interlude]

Stop! Or else I will kill you now, right here.
Need you to listen.
Now, when you have fulfilled the things I said,
Maybe I spare you.

Now, it's time to begin the surgery,
So I can become you.
Have the glory and fame, that you wanted.
My dreams are coming true, coming true, coming true, coming true!

Glory and fame are the only things I want,
Glory and fame are the only things I want.

[Solo]

Glory and fame are the only things I want,
Glory and fame are the only things I want.

Glory and fame are the only things I want,
Glory and fame are the only things I want.
