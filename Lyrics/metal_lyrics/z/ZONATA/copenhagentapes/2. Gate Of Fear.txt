I have this key that will open the gate of fear,
No one has ever had the guts to go there.
A lock off the gate and I cross to this other land,
We've been told stories that there will be diamonds.

Nothing can stop me now,
While we fight all the dragons,
That will stand in my way!

I see bright light from a cave that's in front of me,
I walk inside and see diamonds slice everywhere.
What is that noise I can hear right behind of me?
I turn around and I see this huge dragon!

Nothing can stop me now,
While we fight all the dragons,
That will stand in my way!

[Solo]

He tried to burn me with flames that came from his nose,
I have this armor that stands against fire.
Cut up his stomach, out came the this shiny stone.
Now I am tired and I will go home.

Nothing can stop me now,
While we fight all the dragons,
That will stand in my way!
