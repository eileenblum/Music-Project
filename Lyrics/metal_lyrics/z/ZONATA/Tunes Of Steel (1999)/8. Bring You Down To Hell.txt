The demons are coming after you
In the night ready to fight
Always cruel with hate in their mind
Promise you that they will get you
You're trying to hide with fear in your eyes
Hoping that nobody see's you
If they should know where you are
I'm sure that they will torture you

I hope that you, you are prepared
Take all the weapons you can
If you are not ready to fight
I'll think that you'd better run

When you're walking in the night
You should always be prepared
They can strike right here right now
And bring you down to Hell
to Hell

You're running away with no place to stay
The demons can almost reach you
You hear that someone is shouting your name
You think for yourself what you should do
You're trying to hide with fear in your eyes
Hoping that nobody see's you
If they should know where you are
I'm sure that they will torture you

I hope that you, you are prepared
Take all the weapons you can
If you are not ready to fight
I'll think you'd better run

When you're walking in the night
You should always be prepared
They can strike right here right now
And bring you down to Hell
to Hell

When you're walking in the night
You should always be prepared
They can strike right here right now
And bring you down to Hell

I hope that you, you are prepared
Take all the weapons you can
If you are not ready to fight
I'll think you'd better run

When you're walking in the night
You should always be prepared
They can strike right here right now
And bring you down to Hell
to Hell
