I`m flying high through the clouds
On top of my wheels of steel
You're trying to hide away from me

I'm wearing my belt of strength
Along with my iron-gloves
My power is strong and glorious

Why the heavens scream my name I will tell You now
Cause I am Thor (The ThunderGod)
And I decide where the lightning strikes
If You don't believe it
My hammer will show You how

When You sail through the seas
In search for glory and gold
Winds carrying You away from home

You better pray for You're life's
And sacrifice to me now
You better watch out cause I am near

Why the heavens scream my name I will tell You now
Cause I am Thor (The ThunderGod)
And I decide where the lightning strikes
If You don't believe it
My hammer will show You how

When You see clouds ahead
And rain is pouring down
There is no time for You to pray

I'm raising my hammer high
To swing it with all my might
My power is strong and glorious

Why the heavens scream my name I will tell You now
Cause I am Thor (The ThunderGod)
And I decide where the lightning strikes
If You don't believe it
My hammer will show You how
