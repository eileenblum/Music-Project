We are the Vikings that is looking for war
Slaying and raping and killing them all
We travel around from town to town
Searching for women to have us some fun

We are the last of the evil
Nobody gets in our way
Thor is our God and our guide on the way
We're gonna make you pay

As we walk on our journey through life
We're gonna see some pain in your eyes
Sometimes are good times and sometimes are bad
We must carry on
We must carry on
Right now

People are trying to fight against us
With speers and axes and life as a loss
We are the strong and we are the cruel
We're only here to get You

We are the last of the evil
Nobody gets in our way
Thor is our God and our guide on the way
We're gonna make you pay

As we walk on our journey through life
We're gonna see some pain in your eyes
Sometimes are good times and sometimes are bad
We must carry on
We must carry on
Right now

Graves been digged on places we been
Blood on our hands and blood on our feet
We are the Vikings that sailed through the seas
We're gonna kill you and set your soul free

We are the last of the evil
Nobody gets in our way
Thor is our God and our guide on the way
We're gonna make you pay

As we walk on our journey through life
We're gonna see some pain in your eyes
Sometimes are good times and sometimes are bad
We must carry on
We must carry on
Right now
