I want to know what's beyond the Rainbow I see
Decided to leave here right now

I start to walk away on this rainy day
It makes me feel good so I won't give up

Then I came to there where the Rainbow is
It began to feel like a dream
I had never seen such a lovely place before this day

Life is a travel through time a mysterious path
Just hold on tight then You will carry on

If You feel a lot of rain inside Your soul
Get rid of the pain and keep Your head hold high

Then You'll come to there where the Rainbow is
It begins to feel like a dream
You will never see such a lovely place again
