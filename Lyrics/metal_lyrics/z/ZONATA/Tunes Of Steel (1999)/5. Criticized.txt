You always see the bad in me
You always judge before You're thinking

I always do my best to please
I am a servant of Your desires

Please listen to this song that I have wrote for You my friend
Hope that You like the lyrics that I've wrote for You this time, this time

People do always criticize
Things they do not understand

I've got a message to all of You
Please listen careful what You should do now

Please listen to this song that I have wrote for You my friend
Hope that You like the lyrics that I've wrote for You this time, this time

I was raised so heavenly
My Brothers stood beside of me
If You decide to follow me
There is Kingdom for You to see

You always see the bad in me
You always judge before You're thinking

I always do my best to please
I am a servant of Your desires

Please listen to this song that I have wrote for You my friend
Hope that You like the lyrics that I've wrote for You this time, this time

I was raised so heavenly
My Brothers stood beside of me
If You decide to follow me
There is Kingdom for You to see

I was raised so heavenly
My Brothers stood beside of me
If You decide to follow me
There is Kingdom for You to see

I was raised so heavenly
My Brothers stood beside of me
If You decide to follow me
There is Kingdom for You to see
My friend
