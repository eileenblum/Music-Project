Why is that shadow hanging over me
It does reminds me of the pain I had
I can't forget all these bad years
When I was sent down to Hell

I was punished all the time
No one didn't realize

I do not belong here with the maniacs
I should be in Heaven where the angels are
But now when I am here I will kill them all
And make the Evil disappear

I will make sure that they suffer
And leave all the pain that I have seen through
Now when It's done I will leave this place
And try to forget what they have done

I was punished all the time
No one didn't realize

I do not belong here with the maniacs
I should be in Heaven where the angels are
But now when I am here I will kill them all
And make the Evil disappear

Now I can see who the shadow is
It is the leader himself
I picked up my gun and I smashed his brain
Hope that will clear up my mind

I was punished all the time
No one didn't realize

I do not belong here with the maniacs
I should be in Heaven where the angels are
But now when I am here I will kill them all
And make the Evil disappear
