You sail through storms
To reach into my world
A world that gives freedom to You all

Back at home
They treated You like shit
A world that brought sorrow to You all

Welcome to this world of fun
I will bring You round and round
Sorry that I never introduced myself
I will always try to be what I am

I am just a holy ghost
I will try to be Your host
Promise that I always will take care of You
I will always be by Your side

Now You reached
Into my holy land
A world that You thought was so good

Now it's time
To see what I have done
I am the Evil one

Welcome to this world of fun
I will bring You round and round
Sorry that I never introduced myself
I will always try to be what I am

I am just a holy ghost
I will try to be Your host
Promise that I always will take care of You
I will always be by Your side

OOOOOOH

Welcome to this world of fun
I will bring You round and round
Sorry that I never introduced myself
I will always try to be what I am

I am just a holy ghost
I will try to be Your host
Promise that I always will take care of You
I will always be by Your side
