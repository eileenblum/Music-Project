Dream Child is calling on me right now
Soon I'll be at sleep and away for a while

I am the helper with the power of Gods
Angry and ready to fight
Pain in my anger makes lightning seem weak
Now I'm gonna make you awake from this dream
Right now

Someone is trying to break through the dream
Ruin and take all the things that you've done

I am the helper with the power of Gods
Angry and ready to fight
Pain in my anger makes lightning seem weak
Now I'm gonna make you awake from this dream
Right here

I'm walking inside this evil dream
But no one understands
What I did before this day
No one wants to see
I was cruel a damn fool
But I will carry on

Pain in my anger makes lightning strike down
Now I'm gonna make you awake from this dream
Right now

I'm flying through dreams with a mission to kill
Dream Child gives orders and I make the kill

I am the helper with the power of Gods
Angry and ready to fight

Pain in my anger makes lightning strike down
Now I'm gonna make you awake from this dream

Right now
Right here
Right now
Right here
Right now
