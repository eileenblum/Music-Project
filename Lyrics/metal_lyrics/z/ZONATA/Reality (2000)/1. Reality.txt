Here on earth we see destruction
It has gone to far
We must change for new directions
Use your mind or fall

See through the past what we have done
Disaster soon will come
Hell after life or hell on this earth
Will we be rebirthed

Reality !

Time is short years are counted
Generations lost
See the truth ! We are hunted
We must pay the cost

See through the past what we have done
Disaster soon will come
Hell after life or hell on this earth
Will we be rebirthed

Nature bleeds for our disposal
We must point our view
You cant use your nuclear weapons
You must hear the calls

See through the past what we have done
Disaster soon will come
Hell after life or hell on this earth
Will we be rebirthed

We must gather now for a future instead of hell
We must gather now for a future instead of hell
