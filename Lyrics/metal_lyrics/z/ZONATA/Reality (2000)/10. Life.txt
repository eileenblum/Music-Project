Time it seems to fade away
A life is it nothing but a dream ?

I stand here as true as I was made
Am I a stranger to myself ?

I have feelings of times lost and shared
Moments of darkness in my head

Is there a place for You and me ?
Where nothing is for real

A spring of life that never ends
A glory for all to see

I have feelings of times lost and shared
Moments of darkness in my head
