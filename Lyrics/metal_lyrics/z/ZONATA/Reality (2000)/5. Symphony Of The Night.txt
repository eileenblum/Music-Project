Thoughts in the night, this must be right
Keeps me awake
Inside my walls, I choose the rules
Master of will

Victim of night
Slave to my pride
Every (new) day has it's change
Innocent lies
Our faith lies in time
Please understand

Every fortune has it's end
Think of this my friend
Even if you're right within
Meet reality

Caught in my dream, (so) lifeless it seems
Inside a king
Strenght in my mind, I will decide
Madness disguised

Victim of night
Slave to my pride
Every (new) day has it's change
Innocent lies
Our faith lies in time
Please understand
