Morphed by fear, a mask to wear
But all must carry on
Desperate fights for the final light
The last straw to be drawn
Disbelieve or contribute
Revaluate your soul
A radical way to live
That undivides our rules

Open up your eyes and see the mirror of your life
Hunted every moment by the phantoms in the night

Bow down, time has been tolled
Rise now, to remain

The chains of dawn will reveal
The truth and what to come
Systematized synchronized
Life is on the hold
Faith by night a shallow light
Our innocence will guide
And silent saved from decay
We rearrange our ways

Open up your eye and see the mirror of your life
Hunted every moment by the phantoms in the night

Bow down, time has been tolled
Rise now, to remain
