[Re-recorded demo track]

I have this key that will open the gate of fear
No one has ever had the guts to go there
I open the gate and I cross to this other land
I have heard stories that there will be diamonds

Nothing can stop me now
When i fight all the dragons
That will stand in the way

I see bright light from a cave that's in front of me
I walk inside, and I see diamonds everywhere
What is that noise I can hear right behind of me
I turn around, and I see this huge dragon

Nothing can stop me now
When i fight all the dragons
That will stand in the way

He tried to burn me with flames that came from is nose
I have this armor that protects me from fire
Cut out his stomach, out came the his sherry-stone
Now I am tired and I will go home

Nothing can stop me now
When i fight all the dragons
That will stand in the way
