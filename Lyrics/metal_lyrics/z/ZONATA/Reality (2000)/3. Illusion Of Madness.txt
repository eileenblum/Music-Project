See the crystal ball that shines so bright
It will tell the future here tonight

Feel the magic coming on so strong
Feel the spirits dancing in the night

See the darkness fall with grace
And hear the jesters madness
Enjoy the show they give to You
Come to this illusion

Your soul is going far in twilight time
Trapped inside this dream just hold on tight

My heart is screaming tryin to break my chains
Like a thunderstorm with draining rains

See the darkness fall with grace
And hear the jesters madness
Enjoy the show they give to You
Come to this illusion

All hope is gone there's nothing here for me
The world for me is gone why can't You see

My heart is screaming tryin to break my chains
Like a thunderstorm with draining rains

See the darkness fall with grace
And hear the jesters madness
Enjoy the show they give to You
Come to this illusion
