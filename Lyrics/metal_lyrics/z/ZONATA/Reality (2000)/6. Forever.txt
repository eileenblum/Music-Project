You fear the reaper staring in the night
Now he calls for blood
You stole the secret of his tender heart
There is no return

Here the call
Don't want to fall

Stand Proud
Stay True
Stand Tall
FOREVER

The quest for battle it will always hunt You down
Why can't You see
The wind is blowing rain is falling down on You
You're far from home

Here the call
Don't want to fall

Stand Proud
Stay True
Stand Tall
FOREVER

Inside Your mind You are searching for the truth
It's plain to see
There have always been two sides of every tale
You don't want to fail

Here the call
Don't want to fall

Stand Proud
Stay True
Stand Tall
FOREVER
