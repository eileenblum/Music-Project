See the raven fly with wings of freedom
The eagle stands so proud in silence
It's the soul and destiny

See the people heading for tomorrow
They are standing close together
On their way to eternity

Soon they come across a new dimension
And they will descend from darkness
I can hear them scream and suffering
Right now

Here they stand on the trail that gives eternal life
They have walked with sorrow in their souls
Side by side damned into eternal dark
Forever enslaved by twisted hearts

Now we're running back to face the demon
Let's put an end into this prophecy
We will fly into infinity

Look there is a gate that cross dimensions
Can feel the blood is pumping through my veins
And I can't wait to meet the demon

Soon they come across a new dimension
And they will descend from darkness
I can hear it scream and suffering
In pain

Here they stand on the trail that gives eternal life
They have walked with sorrow in our souls
Side by side damned into eternal dark
Forever enslaved by twisted hearts
