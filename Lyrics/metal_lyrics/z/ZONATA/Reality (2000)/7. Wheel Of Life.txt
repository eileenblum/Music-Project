It's the time of darkness It's the age of blood and tears
Creations of the chaos sweeps the land
All hope of resistance has been lost by doubt of man
All this wasted time must be refound

Like a bolt of light he came through the sky
Gave us strength to carry on
Proclaimed this land we once called home
Broke our chains, our souls unbowed

In the darkest night he will be our guide
Show our hearts what to believe
In every life there's a time to fight
Choose Your side in the Wheel of Life

Like a fallen angel he descended from the stars
With promises to take us through alive
Break the chains of chaos and defy wrath of pain
Once again dawn has set us free

Like a bolt of light he came through the sky
Gave us strength to carry on
Proclaimed this land we once called home
Broke our chains, our souls unbowed

In the darkest night he will be our guide
Show our hearts what to believe
In every life there's a time to fight
Choose Your side in the Wheel of Life
