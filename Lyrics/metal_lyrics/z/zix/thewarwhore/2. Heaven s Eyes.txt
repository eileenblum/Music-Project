Can you can you tell
What's the world coming to
Underneath holy lies
Say your prayers or die
Consumed by fear
Time is near
Watching me, watching you
Watching our every move
Try to run or try to hide
They are coming after you
In the end, there's nothing you can do
It is a long road down to heaven
To hell, and back again

[Chorus]
Light the sky, to a flame in Heaven's eyes
Underneath holy lies
Say your prayers or die
Lust for power took over your mind
Soon you will face your last demise

Is real is it me
Insane or is it sanity
I am trapped in a cage
But I cannot see the bars
Consumed by fear
Time is near
Is it fear is it near?
Is it hiding in my tears?
Is it there? Is it fair?
Is it living in my head?
In the end, there's nothing I can do
It was written many years ago
The all seeing eye
From the ashes, will arise
