Invinsible Hatred I Beg Thee Not To Let Me Free
I Wish To Lose Myself In Thy Darkness
This Cursed Sorrow Which Lives On In Me
Shall Be Hidden Within Thy Sarcasms
Let Me Walk The Earth And Trample All It's Life
Let Me Be The Last Being Watching All Die
Standing Proud In A Life Of Contradictions
As I Laugh While I Wish To Cry

By My Own Words I Am Forsakened
Sinking In Unbroken Patterns Of Rejection
Circling Down To A State Of Hate
So Pure And True That All Else Fades
No Mistakes Made For I Cannot Regret
Still A Lie It Would Be To Say I Am Content
I Became Truly Evil When All Hope Left
And The Present Condition Makes Rage Suit Me Best
On A Journey Away From Light And Warmth
I Desire To Kill All The Rest

I Show No Weakness And I Have None
Yet I Wonder What I Gain
I Reject The World On Principle
And Let My Nihilism Reign
I Crave None And Give The Same
I Spit On All Which Have A Name
I Blame None But Hate Them All
Convince Me Wrong Then Convince A Wall
For I Have No Soul Or Purpose
To My Peace There Are No Doors
