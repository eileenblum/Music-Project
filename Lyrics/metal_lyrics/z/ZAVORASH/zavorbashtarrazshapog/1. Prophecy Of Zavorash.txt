When Our Kind Has Returned To The Valleys 
When Northern Lights Fill The Skies
When The Domain Of Darkness Rises
Then All Else Shall Die
From The Frozen Realms We Shall Arise
Marching Down From The Permafrost
Turning Our Swords Towards The Shining
Until All Light Is Lost

Barbarians From The Land Of Snow And Ice
Shall Pilage And Prophane The Bright Paradise
Riding Proud On Slaughter
Of Battlehorns Forseen
Unionship Of Zavorash
Universals Of The North
Adverseries Of The Weak Ones
Through Whirling Storms We Roar
The Sons Of Thunders Time Shall Come
A World In Fear Bow For Them
Before Sent To Kingdom Come
We All Their Lifes Condemn

"And Then Came The Blast
Turbulent Destruction Icicled
Oh, How We Laughed
Majestic was This Revelation
Deadly Pact, Funeral Eternal
We Were Swords In This War
We Beheld Death And Shivered With Lust
We Were The Ones Who Turned The World To Dust"

Feel Spiritual Forces
Lurking The Woods Under Eons Of Stars
Breathe The Winds On The Mountains
And Let Thy Visions Fly Far
For Alone They Are Mighty
Together All Else Falls
Enstranged By Dark Fountains
In Which Milleniums Call
For Strong Unswerwing Riders
Glowing Spots In The Night Of Light
And For Swords To Be Unsheated
When The Time Is Right.
