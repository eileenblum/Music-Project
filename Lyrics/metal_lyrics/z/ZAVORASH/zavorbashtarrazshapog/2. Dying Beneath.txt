With Evil In Eye They Arise At Night
Spreading Wings Over Moonshine Skies
When They Ascend With Winds To Flight
Then It Is Time For The Darkened Tide To Arrive
Desecrated Domains Dying Beneath
Delighted They Spread Death To Acheve
A Kingdom Of Bones And Frozen Eyes
Ravished Souls Still Tortured In Ice

The Vision Is Black With Spots Of Red
The Goal Is Death And Sorrow To Dwell
And Fear To Strike The Pethetic Breed
Complete Evil Is What They Acheve
They Will Bring The Divine Sons Head On A Pole
Then Multiply The Nails In His Father
Then In Mystical Rites Cry
And Spread Their Shadows Of Murder

I Great Them Also To Give Me Wings
They Need Not Seek To Take My Heart
Heel To Heel We Will Rise In The Winds
To Fly With Glowing Eyes
And Crush The Foundations Of Light We See
Them As Plague Us As Remedy
We Are Streams Of Bloodlust Coming Down
Soon To Become A River

The Legion Great Them As Allies
The World Great Them As Death
Blessed By Evil Before The Start Of Time
And They Still Rule The Astral Worlds
Devestated Dying Lands Beneath
Is Not Enough To Their Lust Apeace
Thee Might Have Hid In The Light Till Now
Now None Shall Save In The Darkened Tide

Erased Empires Stand Witness
Again Their Offspring Shall Fall
Never The Subject Of Forgivness
So Laughed At By My Horde
Several Melliniums Passed Blindly
Behold Now A Dark Dawn
Where None Shall Save
Where Only Die You May
