As I Behold The Most Frozen Landscape And Await The Dusk To Pass
I Call Upon A Second Age Where Death And Winters Last
By Fire By Ice And By Dark Rage We Will The World Into Eternity Cast
By Mountains White Under The Moon By The Valleys Yet Unpassed
I Swear Myself The Emperor Of The Most Dark Of Paths
As I Await The Night To Cloak The World Suddenly I Can Speak The Tongue Of Souls Unheard

There By The Falling Sun I Am Granted Wisdoms Known To None
My Tears Have Made My Armor Impenetrateble They Have Stained
My Path Is Of Darkness In My Sight Pure Hatred Reigns
Dark But Yet Enlightened Evil And Yet Just
Walking The Land Of Lunar Lights Calm I Enter This Violent Might
Convoking Spiritual Oneness With Snow And The Fallen Foe

Above And Before I Stood There Glancing Where Shadows Of Fires To Come Were Dancing
And I Saw Through These Glimmering Views Of Snow And Frozen Stone
A Crack From The Skies To Earth's Foundations Then Opened My Brothers' Gate
The Time Has Come To Rise The Banners The Time Is Now To Charge

I Shall Stand Where I Should Fall I Shall Charge Where I Should Flee
I Shall Laugh Where I Should Cry And Hate Where I Should Love
Prepared And Stout I Now Await The Final Dawn
Releasing All I Have Worn And Gathered Feeding My Own Flames
In The Legion I Shall Come Forth Among Countless Dark Names
A Revenge With No Message A Slaughter Before Unseen

As I Behold The Most Frozen Landscape And Await The Dusk To Pass
I Call Upon A Second Age Where Death And Winters Last
By Fire By Ice And By Dark Rage We Will The World Into Eternity Cast
By Mountains White Under The Moon By The Valleys Yet Unpassed
I Swear Myself The Emperor Of The Most Dark Of Paths
As I Await The Night To Cloak The World Suddenly I Can Speak The Tongue Of Souls Unheard

Above And Before I Stood There Glancing Where Shadows Of Fires To Come Were Dancing
And I Saw Through These Glimmering Views Of Snow And Frozen Stone
A Crack From The Skies To Earth's Foundations Then Opened My Brothers' Gate
And For The Coming Eons We Now Release The Legion
