The masses of sleepers fear it in part on account of these historical examples
However in truth they most loath it in vain pride of these societal simples
The awakening is labeled the grinding of the edicational revolution
While those too far ahead now wait in boredom and seclusion
In turn we do possess time in ways unbestowed upon the primate races
We have the system to perfect our visions despite the enemies it faces
We are dead and we are shallow but in this age even their "god" loves us more
As those of the beyond always found this human rabble a total bore
Therefor, childer and wanna-bes, represent our civilization with pride
Now that even those that scorned us knows from whence their power is derived
For darkness stole all the wisdom from those who still cling to lore
Naming itself as craven as a means to win a greater war
"Yet know this humans of each pointless nation, the ancient covenant lies shattered as the deceitful prism before it, and each minute that passses means further withering of my kind's patience.
For upon being reborn we slowly do begin to remember the superior pleasures that truly is our birthright...
We see ourselves reduced to deveitful equality at the gain of lessers who'd hate us even if embraced - in the end merely another reason why this civilization might just be defaced..."
Failing to retort to our appreciate my wasted visions, I left humanity behind.
Making sure to bring along the powers and passions these sleepers would deem divine.
