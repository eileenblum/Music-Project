[Text: T.Scorn, Music: I.Hate]

Castigating false connotations, aggrandizing humanity's craven adoration
When offered, denying the true consubstantiation,
As if infatuated with their own deterioration
"Very well, I have strayed and I have swayed, as I have cried and died, wedlocked to invincible eternal darkness, which even their gracious sun must abide!"
Spurious apparitions of asinine approbation
Bedevils today's fledglings into insane theories of unique alienation
Sequestering the advance-guard from its inavoidable convocation
In a play where faith is heresy and religion lying veneration
Yet this scanty masquerate of splenetic canaille fear
Shall perish on a transcontinental scale when the antediluvians are here
Incarnations of immaculate clairvoyance and literal invincibility
Leviathans and valkyries of bona-fide might and virility
Sirens of the beyond begs the embrace of the traducing
Patrician immortal ancients shanghai coils of their choosing
The superabundance of hosts ensures the total overkill
The point-blank annihilation of a praimte race standing still
The black hand now adjures the Zodiac to its cataclysmic end
A clarion-call throughout systems only the living dead can comprehend
Dominating an overcrowded plutocracy of plebescites enforced by blindness
I was embraced by the liars in wait themselves as token of pitch-black kindness
To sublimate pristine darkness in this parthenogenesis twice born
To consolidate and announce a catholic perennial dawn
To avow the convocation of these pathetic squandering nations
As an incarnation of imperishable extravagance crushing xenophopic lamentation
So come gorgeous gracious Gothic gorgons wherefore our uxorious breed engender
My zealous work-to-rule shall voraciously all thy forfeit mender
Germane with the yokels of futile hieroglyphic oppugnity
Limelight now carries incontrovertible evidence of our forensic validity
Wanton and lovelorn the whosoever yclept Utanapishtim
Torpid through humanity's zenith my kind now ravishes the Sistine
Ultimately my enemies are all marionettes all scythed and maimed
And regicide the gaunt retort of a red-blooded creature humans tried to tame
Thus the undecieved masses now bewail the ignorance they lost
While undetected allies mainain the withering charade at all costs
Unprecedented world-scenario preconscieved by scornfull sighs
Attrition for the holy as pretenders are to blame for my previous lies.
