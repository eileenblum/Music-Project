[Text: ?, Music: I.Hate]

May Nammtar open my eyes that I may see their lies
May Nammtar open my ears that I may hear her call
May Nammtar open my nose that I may sense his approach
May Nammtar open my mouth that my voice will be heard to the far reaches of the Earth
May Nammtar strengthen my right hand that I shall be strong, to keep the dead Zonei under my power, under my very power.
I conjure thee, o ancestor of the gods!
I summon thee, creature of darkness by the works of darkness!
I summon thee, creature of hatred by the words of hatred!
I summon thee, creature of wastes, by the rites of waste!
I summon thee, creature of pain, by the words of pain!
I summon and call thee forth from thy abode in darkness!
I evoke thee from the thy resting-place in the bowels of the Earth!
I summon thine eyes to behold the brightness of my wand which is full of the fire of life!
I conjurse thee, o ancestor of gods!
I summon thee, creature of darkness, by the works of darkness!
I summon thee, creature of hatred by the words of hatred!
I summon thee, creature of wastes, by the rites of waste!
I summon thee, creature of pain, by the words of pain!
By the four square pillars of Earth that support the sky,
May they stand fast against those who desire to harm me!
I evoke thee from thy resting-place in the bowels of the Earth!
I summon thee and thine ears to hear the word that is never spoken, except by they father, the eldest of all who know age
The word that binds and commands is my word!
Ia! Ia! Ia! Nngi banna barra ia! Iarrugishgarragnarab!
I conjure thee, o ancestor of the gods!
I summon thee, creature of darkness by the works of darkness!
I summon thee, creature of hatred by the words of hatred!
I summon thee, creature of wastes, by the rites of waste!
I summon thee, creature of pain, by the words of pain!
I summon and call thee forth from thy abode in darkness!
I evoke thee from the thy resting-place in the bowels of the Earth!
May the dead rise!
May the dead rise and smell the incense!
