Long I Searched What The Claim To See, And The Beauty Derived Thereof
Asking Why I Felt Like A Menace, To Them - Who Everything Solved
My Differences Seemed Racial, Though Ancestors I Then Lacked
Until The Orchard Of Mind Opened, And I Stood Completely Aback

Empty And Enlightened, I Drank Of The Miracles
Torn In The Metaphysical, The Void Became A Creed
As I Lost All The Addictions, And Triumphed In Deterministic Rule
Propounding World Perversion, In The Eyes Of The Herd

No Purity, Except A Tidal Hatred
No Sorrow, Though An Ego Degraded
And Love... I Miss This False Heaven

Let It Embrace, No Meaning Of Life
Never Repent, No Meaning In Lies
Faith Signed With Crossbones
Ecstacy... All Meaning Dies!

Insanity, If I By Thee Could Be Characterized
But My Laugh Is Not That Of A Madman
It Is The Fall Of One To Wise
Darkness, If Thee Were To Be My Palfray
But With Fiction Even Evil Died
Hence I Quashed My Last Hospice

This Is The Creed Trancending All Minds, The End Of Malformed Tales
Reaching For Every Thought Misbegotten, Feel The Void Of Reality's Nails
