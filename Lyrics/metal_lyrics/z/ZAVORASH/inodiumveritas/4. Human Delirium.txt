During Times To Elderly To Be Thought Of, Thirsting I Was So I Drank The Eons Wine
Instantly Was I Forlorn In Divine Wisdom, My Grave Was Now Made Centuries Ago
Forgotten Was I Now Long Before My Birth, Without Regret I Opened The Gates To Earth
Amongst The Stones And Dust Of Battles Lost, I Hunted And Laughed For God I Now Was

Though Lost Was I Once Before Reality Was Brought Asunder
Dead Was I Once During Times When Lost Were The Poisen Wine
But In Strength I Arose And Devoured The Universe
And Became My Own Precious Lord And Slave

So Rightly I Call Myself The Powered Very Essence
"By Which Their Pestilent Prayers Are Formed
Life Did Once Teach Me The Most Horrid Of Lessons
Though Still, They Fail To Grasp, I Am Not Horned

But As All Gods Should I Be Adorned!"

I Represent The Denied And Dead Universal Error
In Close Parallels I Mock The Worshipped Truth
My Shining Aura Is That Of A Great Emperor
And In My Chronicles There Is No Sign Of Truce
My Names Are Many, Forever I Am Known
An Angel, Savior, Whore Or Ruler
As I Dance Through The Crippled Walls Of Moral
And Damn Only Those Who Speak The Truth

I Am Rationalisms' Very Foundation, Still Insanity Is My God-given Name
Truth Is For Me Monumental, Still Through Illusions I Reign
The Paradox Of My Hybris Is Striking, As I Demand To Be King Of Existence
As I Rape And Torture In Blackest Hate, "Mankind, How I Love Thy Contradictive Faith"

Yet, But A Humble Slave To The Present Word I Am
Yet, I Kneel On The Cold Deaf Stone
Though We All Have Errors, Only Others We Scorn
For I Am I Creature Of Honor
And I Have My Precious Soul
The Future Shalt Reap My Crimes
"Made Real By A Horde Of Ruling Sheep

I Shalt No Death Of Theirs Weep..."
