[Music: Dj Brynolf / Totalscorn, Lyrics: Totalscorn / Cegma]

Life is beautiful, life is fine,
Your goals are worthwhile, so are mine"
Don't worry, there is a God,
Just follow, and always nod.

Good people always come through in the end,
And morality, is our best friend"
Follow your leaders, watch TV,
We'll all one day be free"
And don't listen to angry intellectuals,
They're all latent homosexuals"
And don't be tempted by the beast inside,
This son of the devil you must always hide"
And don't do drugs, they'll make you die,
Only through prayer can you to heaven fly"
Love thy neighbour, turn thy cheek,
For remember that the lonely are weak"
And know that sarcasm comes from fear,
Hiding nothing but frightened tears"
And that everyone who attacks the system are liars,
They're all primitive savages with morbid desires"
If you see someone wearing black with long hair and studs,
You know he's up to no good - ashamed of our divine blood"
And if you see someone defiling our holy word,
You should crusade against him for the sake (of the herd")

(The only happiness lies in fraternity"
And by true faith (only) you'll live for eternity.
