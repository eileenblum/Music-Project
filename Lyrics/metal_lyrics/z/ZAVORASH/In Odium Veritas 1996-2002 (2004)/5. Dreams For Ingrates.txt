[Music: Zagrash, Backing Vocals: I. Hate, Lyrics: Totalscorn]

All the limpid lies are tattered, let this betoken a passed ordeal
In bereavement of immemorial falsehood, our heinous breed is revealed

Every feasibility of hiding vanquished, wheedling and detraction exposed
As I heaved these shackles of mine, then cured the ailment of all times
In chimerical fraternisation, in lewd horrendous crimes
They ordain the chronic miserliness, shibboleths of pure rhymes
Seen as an impious urchin, I shalt never be lionised
Displaying the cleavage of benignity, premier in the ordinal of lies

Lingering immolation
Elucidation of complete void
Arterial dissimulation
All in modesty foiled

Clandestine yet flagrant, man locked in gullibility
Earthbound. Universal, the thought killed in conformity
The premonitions are grizzled, in luscious hope forlorn
In vagrancy voluminous, all truth becomes torn

Defending the presbytery of devolution, militating for a cause
Icebound in shining fiction, a path of endless loss
A malinger they made me, opprobrious they remain
Yet I have their jewel shattered, hence it is all the same

Though still I dream...

Lingering desecration
Upon all I wish in the end
Genocidal annihilation
May all gods descend
