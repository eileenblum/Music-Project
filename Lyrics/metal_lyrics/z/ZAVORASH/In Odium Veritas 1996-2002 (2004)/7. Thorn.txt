[Music: Nil, Backing Vocals: I. Hate, Lyrics: Totalscorn]

The path of final war embarked upon, brother versus brother, love is forlorn,
Life laid waste, all crawling for the swords, commeth storms, times of no remorse,
I am the bearer of true darkness, behold what this sign enshrines,
Prophet of pure genocide, embattled, this age is mine.

Ye have spoken in my ears in fearsome words, oh, ye have threatened and cried in vain,
Thy fate my servant, death my fame, the one voice known to graves,
All calls forlorn and rotten, shredd by my immortal grinn,
Enemies, debris, all to be laid down, foundation's prison shaking, crumbling.

Rules so adored will not keep me still, emperor, within thy madness,
Behold the Everything, dust as I have passed, embrace me, thy brother, as hatred reach for thy heart,
As the world weeps I grow stronger, all this death is my gain,
Every life that goes under, goes under my name.

Falsehood of hope proven, the dark one, the fiction fears thee need,
Hope has failed, these is only me, so eat my wisdom apple, then drink my poison wine,
Get drunk from scornful laughter, still, death comes to all in time,
Saw beyond the void of everything, my reflection greets me there.

Only there none fear me, none, only those I fear,
The thorns in my heart familiar, I drove them in there,
Behold me, for I am thy prophet, fate of life, man's nature,
My gardens dark and dead, I shall the truth spread...
