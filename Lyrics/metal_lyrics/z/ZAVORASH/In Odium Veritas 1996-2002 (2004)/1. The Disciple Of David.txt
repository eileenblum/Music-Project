"How many heroes died today?
One religious insanity after the other..."

And the elite beholds, keeping its cool (keep your cool)
Waiting for Goliath to stumble more, exposing further fatal wounds
Subversion by diversion, beneath many different masks
Read into these dark storms, understand Our unholy task
Commit yourself to mayhem, fight for our dawn
Sign the covenant of discipline, these repined pigs must not be warned

Let thorns of void guide you, let your immortal blood freeze
Let yourself become as an emperor, never accept this peace
Pay respect to creatures like you, rape and loath the rest
For even radio-played neurotics are building our armies in the west

"The greatest tide since long before the invention of the wheel
Shall arise in secret from these crumbling towers of steel
And at the turn of the next century you will thank these students of lies
For showing us all the essence of what every bible-idiot denies..."

The time is now, the knell is in the air, a David of the future on the rise
Protected by discipline severe, vermin of gods seeking him with bloodshot eyes
We will show you the way, don't be afraid and don't fall prey
We will show you the way, don't be afraid and don't fall prey

The ship is sinking, it's dying time
All warriors of the discipline - my sword and blood is thine!
