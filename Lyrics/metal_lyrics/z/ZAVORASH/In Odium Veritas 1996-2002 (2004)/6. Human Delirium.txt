[Music: Zagrash, Lyrics: Totalscorn]

During times too elderly to be thought of, thirsting I was so I drank the aeons' wine
Instantly was I forlorn in divine wisdom, my grave was now made centuries ago
Forgotten was I now long before my birth, without regret I opened the gates to Earth
Amongst the stones and dust of battles lost, I hunted and laughed for god I now was

Though lost was I once before reality was brought asunder
Dead was I once during times when lost was the poison wine
But in strength I arose and devoured the universe
And became my own precious lord and slave

So rightly I call myself the powered very essence
"By which their pestilent prayers are formed
Life did once teach me the most horrid of lessons
Though still, they fail to grasp, I am not horned

But as all gods should I be adorned!"

I represent the denied and dead universal error
In close parallels I mock the worshipped truth
My shining aura is that of a great emperor
And in my chronicles there is no sign of truce
My names are many, forever I am known
An angel, saviour, whore or ruler
As I dance through the crippled walls of moral
And Damn Only Those Who Speak The Truth

I am rationalisms' very foundation, still insanity is my God-given name
Truth is for me monumental, still through illusions I reign
The paradox of my hubris is striking, as I demand to be king of existence
As I rape and torture in blackest hate, "Mankind, how I love thy contradictive faith"

Yet, but a humble slave to the present word I am
Yet, I kneel on the cold deaf stone
Though we all have errors, only others we scorn
For I am I creature of honor
And I have my precious soul
The future shalt reap my crimes
"Made real by a horde of ruling sheep

I shalt no death of theirs weep..."
