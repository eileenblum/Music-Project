And now I feel free to be despotic
Our dreams making one with the impossible
Reality trapped in the whirlwind of memories
Nothing left to bet but our lives
In the glimpse of the ecstasy
By poisonous madness offered

We are not guests at our own life's feast
So we create the power of victory
Light in our eyes as
Blinding as a marble sun
Luminescent as an obsidian sun
And the hours go by like winter anxiety

Overcoming pompousness
Playing with a toy-world
We are laughing children
We have imaginary friends
Deep in our hearts
Lies the pure madness of the deserter

And now I burn my eyes against the vastness of possibility

I'm the new king of an island...
