Tough my lips are swollen
My throat filled with blood
I can still say your name
And still call for The Flood

We are fighting so obscure
Beneath the lonely moonlight
And the street calls our name
Repeatedly tonight

Our thoughts are plastered
On the miserable walls
Of this lowering bud
This Monster of a city

I wish our words
Were of any use
I wish we could reach out
Before they shut our mouths

We have no friends
We have no lovers
We're facing dead ends
It's for the better
You don't wanna join us
We're headed in a wall
With our eyes wide shut
And our faith on stall

But the pavement has worn us
Down to th' essentials
Out of strength we howl
Starving hysterical naked
