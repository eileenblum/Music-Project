Echoic walls
These crazy thoughts build

My honey smiles rooted out
Cover cold steel
One step to action
Jumping in a loophole

Society confines me
In the role of a clown
And it dreams of dancing
On the corpse of this circus

This so damned bloody road
On which I'll be a Mad Max retarded

Swallow my veil of blood.
