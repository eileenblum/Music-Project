I feel I'm going to lose my mind here

Try to walk in the night while there is
World's waste decaying on the ground
I feel like I'm another one of those
Disposable objects we love to throw

I'm tired to drink the lights
Lost In Vegas

My faith is gone
No attorney
This beast is unleashed
And will eat your brain

I want to go way back but I still know you

Don't you hear ?
I'm on a slippery rope
Fire in my throat
Dreaming of lost visions
I see my loss
Like all the things I've done
Burning ways
Sorrow

I've cleared my sights
