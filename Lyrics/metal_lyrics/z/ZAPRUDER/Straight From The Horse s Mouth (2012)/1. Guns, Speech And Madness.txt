Forget what you saw
Eye closed at the end of the tunnel
The darkness dwells too deep
To be experienced
In each soul there lies a gun

And when
You draw out
Your rage, buried inside
Is stuck in the Other
A brother from the road
Lost forever
And comes crashing because of you
The endless dreams of the world.

You have seen dramatic days
With no rules
The banners on their hearts
Bears only Â« Myself Â»
Because we deserve to be
Actors of war
Like unicorns we act
Like moral brats
Our guts will tell you that
We're only rats
There is no culprit but
The despicable will to offend
Keep falling until you know
If you're strong or not
So repent of your faults
We're law

They rest assured that life
Owes them everything
Extremists of the angst
Witches is what they seem
Inside your face they stare
And get you out of here

Burn so you can reach limbo
You always were so mad
You did not see it coming
The blow that fueled the rage

In your head

Bearing the basest things
You mere corporeal thing
Degenerate

Yet I do want to see
The crowd gathering
That will put you in jail
You will climb the wall.
