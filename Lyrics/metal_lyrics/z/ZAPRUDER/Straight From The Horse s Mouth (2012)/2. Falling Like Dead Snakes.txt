Eyes open like suns
Burning rests of lives

Blow off the poison of this sleeping ghost now
Wake up you must kill the snake by your own hands
You must take the torch and follow the final procession
In it you will grow and dig out your buried rage

So glad to see you praise the hole
(Fear ends)
When crawling under skin
(Snakes)
Serve as veins.
I'm glad to see you want to escape
(From this)
Jail Of Comfort
(Run)
To get the rhythm.

Bodies in flames, face at least bright
Of a light too dark
Power of a creation too human
Burn the system, he brings to the suicide
Automatons of flesh, engaged in a dance too restricted

Falling Like Dead Snakes

The shape is empty
