I don't think I can take this any more
Screams of pain echo through my mind
Visions of agony haunt my very soul
I open my eyes only to find the crimson rain

Insanity begins to take it's toll
I try to run but the demons are from within
I see your face and I
Can't stand the way I feel
Your gentle features all covered with
The crimson rain

Now in my darkest hour
Demons from below torture my soul
I still see the blood on my hands
The guilt is killing me
I can't take any more

I look back on that night and the tears
They roll down my face
The love we had I know
That I cannot replace
I did not think it was you
Walking through the dark
I went into shock when I saw
The bullet had pierced your heart
