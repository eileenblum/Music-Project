Out in the night you'll see the fires burning
Out in the cold I hide out in the dark
Soon you'll feel my wrath, I'm filled with anger
And then you'll know my bite's worse than my bark

You can't ever beat me I'm your worst nightmare
You know where I'm heading
Into the darkness of the night

Look in my eyes, you'll know I am not lying
Blood in my veins is filled with total rage
I am a force with which to be reckoned
And I am a beast that's broken from his cage

You can't ever beat me I'm your worst nightmare
You know where I'm heading

Into the darkness of the night
I'm running
Until I see morning light
No warning
Into the darkness of the night

Fire in my eyes, hatred in my soul
Drives me on and on
I will watch you die, I will watch you burn
Before the night is done

[Solo: Tsalikis]

You can't ever beat me I'm your worst nightmare
You know where I'm heading

Into the darkness of the night
I'm running
Until I see morning light
No warning
