Ride on my battle steed, searching for a might
See all my victims bleed, show them all my might
Let the, know my name and feel my burn
See them in the night now they will learn

Twenty score will fall from my deadly blade
When they hear my call graves will be made
Now they feel my cold steel in their hearts

Evil riding in the night
In my soul burning fire
Evil stealing life
Is my only desire

Chills rush up their spines as I ride in the night
Now their souls are mine as they are filled with fright
Now I will destroy all that come near
My mission has been made so clear

Evil riding in the night
In my soul burning fire
Evil stealing life
Is my only desire

Send your heroes to try and end my reign
I fear no mortal man
Knights and wizards have all come before
And died by my hand
In the darkness there is no escape
Terror fills their hearts
In the shadows I lie and I want to rip them all apart

[Solo: Corallo]

Evil riding in the night
In my soul burning fire
Evil stealing life
Is my only desire
