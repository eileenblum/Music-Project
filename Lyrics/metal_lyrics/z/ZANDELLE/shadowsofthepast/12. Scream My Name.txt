I want to feel you
The touch of your skin makes me burn with desire
I want to taste you
The hunger within me is spreading like fire
Infatuation, you'll lose all control
You slowly lose control
The fever is rising, it's taking it's toll
Passion deep inside

I'm going to take you
You'll feel my breath as I ravage your body
I'm going to have you
Carnal obsession I'll make you beg for me
Unrestrained lust, taking control
You feel it take control
Unbridled passion to make you feel whole
Feel me deep inside

Inside you, pure ecstasy
Pleasure, aching for more
Give in to lust you cannot tame
Yearning, thirst uncontained
Longing, deep in your core
I'm going to make you scream my name

[Solo: Cardillo]

Lost in desire
No inhibitions to hold back the hunger
I'll take you higher
Climatic pleasures exploding like thunder
Total surrender, the lust taking hold
You feel it taking hold
You feel the yearning right down to your soul
Feel me deep inside

Inside you, pure ecstasy
Pleasure, aching for more
Give in to lust you cannot tame
Yearning, thirst uncontained
Longing, deep in your core
I'm going to make you scream my name
