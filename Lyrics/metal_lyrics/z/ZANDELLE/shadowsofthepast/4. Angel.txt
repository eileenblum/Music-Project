[Solo: Tsakilis]

All these years I've waited for you
In that time so near yet so far
Passing ships out in the night time
Distant beauty like a shining star

Now you're here an angel from heaven
Eyes that shine touch my soul
When you smile I feel like I'm flying
With you here by my side, my life is whole

I love to look into your eyes
To hold your hand and feel you near
Lips so soft, my heart starts racing
Ecstasy for you I feel

Now you're here an angel from heaven
Eyes that shine touch my soul
When you smile I feel like I'm flying
With you here by my side, my life is whole

[Solo: Tsakilis]

Time stands still when you're with me
How I wish you'd never leave
When you're away I feel so empty
All these words you must believe

Now you're here an angel from heaven
Eyes that shine touch my soul
When you smile I feel like I'm flying
With you here by my side, my life is whole
