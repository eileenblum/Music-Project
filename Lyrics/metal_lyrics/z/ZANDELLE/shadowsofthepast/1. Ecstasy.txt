Now look!
Cause I don't want to play your game by the book
You know you have captured me with your hook
Why don't you just take another look

[Solo: Tsalikis]

Cause you!
You are everything I'm searching for
Before you always wanted more
Now I see you are the final score
You know you're the one for me
You know you're my ecstasy

[Solo: Tsalikis]

Cause i
I don't know what to do or say
I want to see you night and pay
But I guess is the price I pay

Alright
I want to love you through the night
You know that you always do it right
With you I have reached the highest height
You know you're the one for me
You know you're my ecstasy

[Solo: Corallo]

Now look!
Cause I don't want to play your game by the book
You know you have captured me with your hook
Why don't you just take another look

[Solo: Corallo]

Cause you!
You are everything I'm searching for
Before you always wanted more
Now I see you are the final score
You know you're the one for me
You know you're my ecstasy

[Solo: Corallo]
