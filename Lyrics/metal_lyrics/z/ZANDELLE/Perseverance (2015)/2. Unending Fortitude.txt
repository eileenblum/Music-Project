Struggled for decades
Hardships that we have faced
Far beyond compare
External compare
Mixed with inner dissent
More than most could bear

In a time when most would just give up
With our faith in you strong we drive on

We will stand strong and fight on
Our battle has just begun
Destroy all who stand in our way
When we're gone they'll remember
We never surrender
And from our true path never strayed
Come what may

We've heard the critics?
Condemning analysis
Judging what thy themselves can't do
Basing their judgement
On pure subjectivity
Forcing opinions on you

Who are they to display such audacity?
We will thrive just to spite them all

We will stand strong and fight on
Our battle has just begun
Destroy all who stand in our way
When we're gone they'll remember
We never surrender
And from our true path never strayed
Come what may

Our faith will never falter
Our strength grows ever more
Our names shall live forever
Like eagles we shall soar
