Time is passing by, now it's do or die
Years have gone by way too fast
No more time to wait or it will be too late
Future soon will be the past
This is your last chance
Snap out of your trance
You won't get another break
Opportunity vanishing quickly
It's a risk that you must take

Strike now while the iron is hot
You have been given a chance to achieve,
something great that most only dream of

Rise up to the challenge
Only you have what it takes to succeed
And now more than ever
In yourself you must believe
Set aside procrastination
You cannot put it off any more
Time is now, no tomorrow
Spread your wings so you can soar

This is your end game
You've no one to blame
If you do not take your shot
Nothing left to lose
(You) know what you must choose
You must give it all you got
You must look within if you hope to win
Do not be afraid to fail
Put away your fears
With blood, sweat and tears
You'll find some way to prevail
