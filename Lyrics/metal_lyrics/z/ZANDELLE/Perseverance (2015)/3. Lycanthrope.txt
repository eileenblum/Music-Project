You feel it rise
From somewhere deep within you
As it starts to take control
Pain and despair
Completely overwhelm you
It transforms you very soul

The wolf is called by the moonlight
There's nothing that you can do to stop it

Feel its hunger as it grows stronger
Transformation to the beast
Deadly monster, horrific nightmare
On their it will feast

Hunt for your prey
The blood lust taking over
It consumes you to the core
They try to run
You quickly overtake them
Leave behind a bloodstained gore

The wolf is called by the moonlight
There's nothing that you can do to stop it

Feel its hunger as it grows stronger
Transformation to the beast
Deadly monster, horrific nightmare
On their it will feast

Now they hunt you
Crave your destruction
They won't stop until you're dead
Armed with silver
Your only weakness
They are coming to take your head

Once again you
Take on the wolf form
How into the moonlight sky
Closing in now
Soon their upon you
Who will live and who will die?
