In the night I feel at home
In darkness I do thrive
On the hunt, my mind is sharp
I feel so alive

Locked in, I have them now
There is no escape
Charge in, weapons drawn
They'll now face their final fate
Swords clash, blood spills
Sound of clashing steel
Screams of pain as they fall
My victory is sealed

Wipe the blood off of my blade
I continue on my way
I pick up another trail
Many more I have to slay

They won't see another day
It's the price that they must pay
I will bring forth fear and pain
I will drive the rest insane

Midnight reign
I seek retribution, complete restitution
They betrayed
Midnight reign
Turned to opposition with their contradictions
Midnight reign

The time has come
My will de done
I will show them
I will torment
They will repent
They will suffer
With dying breath
They'll beg for death
I'll show no mercy
They won't escape
Their souls I'll rape
I'll laugh as they die
