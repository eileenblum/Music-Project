I'm not one to back down
So I will stand my ground
If you underestimate
It will be you last mistake

If you dare to challenge me
You will taste defeat

Once I've reached my breaking point
Pain and violence I'll appoint

You will see a darker side of me
With less sympathy

You have awakened my unforgiving side
My gentle nature is gone and for you
now my tolerance has died

Loss like you've never known
Pain cuts you to the bone

Now you see there's more to me
As you ace defeat

You have awakened my unforgiving side
I'm fueled by anger welling from deep inside
There is no mercy, my empathy subsides
My gentle nature is gone and for you
now my tolerance has died
