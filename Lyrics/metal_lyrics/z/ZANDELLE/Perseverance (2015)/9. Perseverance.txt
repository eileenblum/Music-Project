When it all seems lost and I'm down
it all feels so hopeless

When I've reached the point
I just want to give up
And I'm feeling so helpless

That's the time I must reach inside myself
Find that last bot of strength
Can't stop now it is do or die and
I am not no one to surrender

I will fight on
I will never be discouraged
Won't back down
With resolve I stand my ground
Until I've won
Never will admit defeat
All will see
I will claim my victory

Many in the past have tried to put me down
They tried to dissuade me
Quickly they did learn the folly of their ways
And I made them all see

That's the time I must reach inside myself
Find that last bot of strength
Can't stop now it is do or die and
I am not no one to surrender

I will fight on
I will never be discouraged
Won't back down
With resolve I stand my ground
Until I've won
Never will admit defeat
All will see
I will claim my victory

When I look in the mirror
And reflect on my life
All the choices made
I have no regrets
I'd do it all again
