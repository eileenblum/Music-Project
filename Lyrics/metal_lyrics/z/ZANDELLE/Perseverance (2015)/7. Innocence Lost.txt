Silently enduring pain
Throughout the passing years
The scars have formed within me
All my trust I 'd placed in you
You were the world to me
Your love meant everything

Heartlessly mistreated
Childhood filled with misery

I did not know better
Youthful cursed nativity
I was too blind to see
Pain turned into anger
Burning hatred filling me
Years of endless torment
Filled my life with agony

(But) My time has come
I've taken all I can
And I've survived
I am a stronger man

How the tide has turned now
It is you in need of me
I've gained supremacy

Child becomes the parent
You well being in my hands
Will I show you kindness?
Or will I exact revenge?

My time has come
I've taken all I can
And I've survived
I am a stronger man

In darkness I've hardened
My will developed stronger
My mind and my spirit
will be your slave no longer
No longer!
