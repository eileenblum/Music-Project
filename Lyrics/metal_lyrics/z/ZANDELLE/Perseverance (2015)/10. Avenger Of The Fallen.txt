Deadly and silent
They will not sense me near
Quickly I will set upon them
They will have no chance
Their final moments
Will be filled with dreadful fear

I'm the chosen one
Who's sent forth to avenge

Never yield
Carry on
Until my focs are all gone
Hunt them all
They will fall
I will avenge the fallen ones

They hide in darkness
Their lives besieged by dread
Soon I will have them in my sights
They hurt so many
Despite their innocence
And now they'll
face unforgiving might

I'm the chosen one
Who's sent forth to avenge

Never yield
Carry on
Until my focs are all gone
Hunt them all
They will fall
I will avenge the fallen ones

Now I'm
Closing in our my targets
They'll soon pay
Time draws
Near and soon they will all face their
Judgement day

In my sights I have got them
This is for those who fell
Savagely with no mercy
I begin to unleash hell
