When the darkness fall on the land
We will rise
As our hunger calls
We will seek out our prize
Through the night hunt our prey
Then we hide
In shadows throughout the day

Forever immortal
Ancient power
We never age
Filled with strength
We'll devour

Many hate our kind
They are filled with repulsion
Try to hunt us down
Genocide their compulsion
On their blood we will feast
Soon they'll learn the nature of the beast

Forever immortal
Ancient power
We never age
Filled with strength
We'll devour

Persecuted for what we are
Forced into a life oh hiding
Godless creatures with no souls
Offending their pure hearts

We are stronger by far
And have the cunning of the ages
Their minds we can control
And seduce their hearts
Blood is the life, with it we thrive
Passage of time only makes us stronger
And yet despite all of our might
In shadows we must hide
