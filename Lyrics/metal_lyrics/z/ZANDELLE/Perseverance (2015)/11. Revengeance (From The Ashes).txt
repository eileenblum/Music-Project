Walk beside me
Down this darkened path I choose to live
My heart has turned to stone
Will you guide me?
As I look to what you have to give
Or will I go alone

Frustration, temptation grows
Reflection, deception shows

Walking down this path of hell
As I dream of heaven
Wallowing in self despair
My life clock is at eleven

Desolation, devastation
Take what's left of me
Separation, isolation
Reel in mystery

Can't believe what has become of my life
Someone tell me when will
I see an end to the torment?
Watching as the hope fades out of my eyes
I can feel it fading
Someone find and end to this evil
Symphony in my mind

Torn apart and left for dead
Slowly feel the anger overtake me
Things you've done and things you've said
I have never thought that you'd forsake me

Look into the dark of night
Vengeful heart so full of spite
Tear my heart out while it's bleeding
Inside of me

Keeping my eyes on the prize
Rest assured I will arise
I spread my wings and I will fly
And by my hand you'l surely die
