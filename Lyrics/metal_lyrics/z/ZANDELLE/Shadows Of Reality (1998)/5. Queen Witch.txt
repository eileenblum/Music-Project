The witch casts her spell
Fire in her eyes reveals her evil
A spawn out of hell, she is in league with the devil
She torments all
Her evil laugh echoes through the dark of night
She'll make you crawl
And then you will feel her satanic might
One look she'll try to take your soul
Spreading her hate is her goal
Now she's out of control
Evil heart, her soul as black as coal

The time to strike has come
The witch must die before she kills us all
We must not run
We'll face her now be it stand or fall
We must be wrong
To show her weakness would bring us all doom
Suffered for too long
The time for vengeance will be upon us soon
One look she'll try to take your soul
Spreading her hate is her goal
Now she's out of control
Evil heart, her soul as black as coal

Make your final stand
With a battle cry you charge to fight the witch
With your sword in hand
Rush in to slice apart the evil bitch
In a flash she's gone
You look around to find where she'll appear
Too late, she's won
Your life fades away as you are filled with fear
One look she'll try to take your soul
Spreading her hate is her goal
Now she's out of control
Evil heart, her soul as black as coal
