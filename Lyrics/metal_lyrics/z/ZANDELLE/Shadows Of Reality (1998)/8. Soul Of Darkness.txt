From eternal sleep I awake with every nightfall
Darkness is my home, my domain
Turning into mist, I soar through the night sky
Searching for my meal for my prey
WIth my fangs I bite into your veins
Drink your blood, take pleasure in your pain
Now your soul is mine to possess
Welcome to eternal unrest

Soul of darkness, I am undead
In the daytime the earth is my bed
Soul of darkness, never dying
I will find you where you're lying

For three hundred years
I've spread terror through the heartland
Bringing death to all who get in my way
There is no one ho could dare to oppose me
Those who have tried are now my slaves
With my fangs I bite into your veins
Drink your blood, take pleasure in your pain
Now your soul is mine to possess
Welcome to eternal unrest

Soul of darkness, I am undead
In the daytime the earth is my bed
Soul of darkness, never dying
I will find you where you're lying

Soul of darkness, I am undead
In the daytime the earth is my bed
Soul of darkness, never dying
I will find you where you're lying

Soul of darkness
