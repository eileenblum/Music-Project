You see the light of dawn and think you're almost home
But you have yet to see the change
The town that was your own has birthed and evil spawn
And now it'll never be the same

In the dark of night the evil will arise
And spread its's terror through the land
A demon straight from hell, power too great to tell
Brings death to woman, child and man

And now you find yourself facing your worst nightmare
Your worst fears come alive
You can't be saved by your prayers
Only you can stop this hellish demon
You must put your fears behind you

Bravely you head out to champion the cause
A warrior of honor you'll be
It is your destiny, you can't turn away
They're counting on you to set them free

Brave warrior, last hope for all
Slay the evil one, stand proud and tall

You face the evil one and fight with all your might
And now you fight your greatest battle
Your heart is pure and strong and so you win the fight
And free the town enslaved like cattle

Cause in the light of day the evil one is slain
The town is free to liv again
The warrior reigned supreme, no more agonizing screams
Will haunt any woman child or man
