You feel the hatred inside
You see the fires burning
Your anger fuels your sick desires
You plan for mass destruction
You want to conquer all
Through death you quench your inner fires

Death angel, you're coming
To murder rape and pillage
Your sick mind justifies
Because you are the bringer doom

You take charge of a nation
Whose people look up to you
To deliver them from poverty
Fire up their inner hatred
And send them to battle
Tell them it is their destiny

Delusions of grandeur
You put the blame on others
A servant of madness
You know you are the bringer of doom

Millions died by your hand
As you crossed the land to purify
In your twisted mind what you did was right
It was justified
Evil is your name, play your hellish game
Spreading fear and gloom
Hatred is your fuel, killing is your tool
Bringer of doom

Bringer of doom
