Bullets flying all around, sounds of battle everywhere
Corpses rotting on the ground, screams of dying fill the air
Will I die here? Will this be the end for me?

Fear grips my soul, paralyzing me
Feel the terror of impending doom
Death surrounds me, sick decaying fumes
Bloody horror, bodies torn apart
Dread takes refuge deep within my heart
Within my heart

Now I have to overcome this fear
Pay no heed to death that is so near

As I look into their eyes I can see they are devoid of hope
Their minds tell their bodies lies, it's the only way to cope

See their hollow stares
It's the face of war
See their empty eyes
Hope exists in there no more

How can I cope with the lunacy around me?
Will I fall victim to impending insanity?

Fight!

I can feel it taking hold
Utter numbness taking over me
It is turning my heart cold
Spawns indifference out of agony

So I rush to join my comrades, rage of battle takes control
Fury conquers all emotion, victory my only goal
My foes die here? This will be the end for them?

See their hollow stares
It's the face of war
See their empty eyes
Hope exists in there no more
