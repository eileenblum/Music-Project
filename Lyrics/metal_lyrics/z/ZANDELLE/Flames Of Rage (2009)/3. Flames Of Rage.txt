Rage inside growing strong, taking hold of me
Inner beast crying out, fury breaking free

Hunger, yearning
Fire burning
Fury growing
Passion flowing

Detestation is all I Feel
Utter loathing for you
Hatred growing every day
Absolute, pure and true

Just the mere thought of you fills me with disgust
I find you insufferable, for your death I lust

How I detest you
You bring out of my hate
Abhorrence, revulsion
I will seal your fate

You're the creator of my detestation
You made me what I now am
This is all your fault, you bare the burden
That is why you I now damn

I was once filled with joy and harmony
You've brought me suffering and misery

Detestation is all I Feel
Utter loathing for you
Hatred growing every day
Absolute, pure and true
