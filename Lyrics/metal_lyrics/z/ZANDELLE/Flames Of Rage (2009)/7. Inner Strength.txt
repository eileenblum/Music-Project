From the ashes of shattered dreams
I arise to unleash my power
In the shadows of anguished cries I lie in wait
Filled with anger at the unjust
So many wrongs that I have suffered
Born from all the sorrow and pain
They will feel my strength

Burning inside me, taking control
Newfound intensity breeds
Sharpens my focus, strengthens resolve
Reinforces my tenacity
Shadows of doubt, no longer there
Gone is my uncertainty
No longer will I question myself
The answers now are so clear to me

I will rise (Rise! Rise!)
Reach the sky (High! High!)
Inner strength (Might! Might!)
Never dies (Thrive! Thrive!)

Determination guiding my way
I am relentless you see
I am unstoppable I am a god
None will keep me from my victory
Willful and dogged, steadfast and strong
Won't stop till I reach my goals
There's no surrender, no turning back
Failure I shall never know

Strong-willed and persistent, power that's fortified
None can impede my driving force
Take on any challenge crush those in my way
No longer will I feel remorse

From the ashes of shattered dreams
I arise to unleash my power
In the shadows of anguished cries I lie in wait
Filled with anger at the unjust
So many wrongs that I have suffered
Born from all the sorrow and pain
They will feel my strength
