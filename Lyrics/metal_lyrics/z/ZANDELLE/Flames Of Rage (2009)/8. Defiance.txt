What do you take me for? I see through your lies
You must think me a fool, who sees the world through blinded eyes
I'm not one of your sheep who cannot see your ways
You are the mastermind of innocents betrayed

Selling false hopes of hereafter if we follow unquestioningly
Inconsistent is your teaching, contradictions you don't want us to see
Ancient superstitions based on ignorance
Belief through coercion of words that make no sense

Millions heed your call and follow what you say
Words you choose wisely to hide hw you betray
Innocent suffer while you get richer every day

Keep them in the dark, method that you use
To hoard unquestioned power that you and yours abuse
Destroying anyone expressing different views

Hypocrisy and insincere humility
Disguising all the concrete arrogance I find beneath
You publicly praise all the poor and meek who bow to you
False threats of punishment, fear is your prevailing tool
You prey upon the week, malevolent pretender
You are a hypocrite with secreted agenda
You keep them uninformed and live in luxury
And if they question you, you cry out "Blasphemy!"

Spread your fear
Spread your word
Spread your faith
To your heard

Selling false hopes of hereafter if we follow unquestioningly
Inconsistent is your teaching, contradictions you don't want us to see

Manipulate them all under your control
Twisted words of faith bear a heavy toll
If they were true fires of hell would burn your soul
