[Lyrics: Bellhharar Belphegor / Music: Bergelmir]
[Arrangements: Fenrir ViernÃ¶vich]

The damned vision of the high
Of the cold hills of my earth
The tragic vision of the time
Of the eternal gods of my earth

Through the collapsed ruins of my kingdom
Through the damned eye of my fortress
Through the afraid noise of my dreams
Through the sacrifice of my angels

In the morbid appearance of a grave
In the perfect symphony of the death
In the nocturnal embrace of the darkness
In the eternal dark glance
I want to look for the power of that obscure kingdom
To put an end to the good of my fortress
I want to look for the lost dream in the nightmare
To implore to the god of my fortress

In the cold blood of the creatures
That I sacrificed with my dagger
In the leafy funereal forest
That aspirate the desire for the beast
I want to look for the power of that obscure kingdom
To put an end to the good of my fortress
I want to look for the lost dream in the nightmare
To implore to the god of my fortress

In the disease and in the disillusion
In the plague and in the fear
In the darkness and in the blasphemy
In my promised fortress

My cursed fortress
Where I have my cruel dream
Where I rise for the spirit
With the gods of my earth
