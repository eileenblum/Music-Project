The sky's as dark as murderers hearts
Waiting stalking
She didn't know he was gunna die
The earth it screams
As bullets fire upon the innocent
She didnt know he was gonna die
The end of his world is here
The seas' as red as the you man's blood
Dripping from his forehead
The winds as cold as his widows eyes
When she finds out her lover won't be coming home
