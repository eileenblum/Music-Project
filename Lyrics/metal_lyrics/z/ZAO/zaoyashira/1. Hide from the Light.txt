Melt your eyes
On the light pouring forth from the seam
Hypnotized
Like a moth in the mouth of the flame
Choose your side
Two rival schools whose dogmas collide
Learn your lines
Speak with conviction be callous and bold

The light will tear us down, infecting what we hear and see
We shall be rebuilt using divisive ideology

Now gather the wood for a stake and a pyre
Bring forth the rope and bring forth the fire
Demonize that which we've been taught to fear
Our enemy's screams will be lost in our cheers

Close your eyes
Roll them back and walk through your mind
Close your eyes
Roll them back and take off your disguise

And hide from the light
