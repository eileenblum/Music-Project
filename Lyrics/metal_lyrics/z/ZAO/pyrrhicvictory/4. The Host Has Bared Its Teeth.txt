Upon the earth, the great hound
We have become just as fleas
And when she tires of our bites
She'll shake us off with ease

Split the atom, raise the seas
Unstoppable Omega disease

Her sky will crack
When the sun turns black
Forcing our species to collapse
As the final curtain pulls back

And what differs is woven in between
Our kind's wrongs and our kind's rights
Is the same that exists
Between the day and between the night

Her sky will crack
When the sun turns black
Forcing our species to collapse
As the final curtain pulls back

The curtain pulls back

We shall drift into the black
Our light is trapped, there's no turning back

The ghost crawls up from the basement
The ghost it weeps for the whole world
