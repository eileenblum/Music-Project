Through doorways of blood, from dimensions unknown
Come hands holding gifts of flowers and stone
Dualistic mirrors
Self-reflecting

It completes the circle, I glimpse at the code
I learn from the hands holding flowers and stone

They wore the sun as their burning halo
Adorned in garments of the calm blue sky

Beyond creation
Above destruction

Until their arrival, I wondered alone
My fate drawn by hands holding flowers and stone
Dualistic mirrors
Self-dissecting

Repeat the cycle, rebuild the bone
Reunite with the hands holding flowers and stone

Flowers and blood
Stone and flesh
Flesh and blood
Flesh and blood
