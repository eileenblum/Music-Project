Bring it to life so it may suffer
Make it alive and feed it pain

Feed it pain

Innocence dreams beneath the rubble

Bring it to life so it may suffer
Make it alive and feed it pain
If it gets back on its feet
Then we'll cut it down again

Innocence breathes below the waves

Give it eyes to see the horrors
Give it ears to hear the hate
Give it a voice to beg for mercy
Give it hands that tremble and shake

Once it arrives
Abandon your fight
Abandon the light
Cast it down

Bring it to life so it may suffer
Make it alive and feed it pain
If it gets back on its feet
Then we'll cut it down again

Innocence warmed within napalm fire
