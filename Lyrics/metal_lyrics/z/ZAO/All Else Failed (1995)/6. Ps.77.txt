I cried out to God for help. I cried out to God to hear me. When I was 
distressed, I sought theLord. At night I stretched out my hand, but saw no
comfort. I remembered you God and I groaned; I mused and my spirit grew 
faint. You kept my eys from closing. I was too troubled to speak. I thought 
about the former days the years long ago. I remember my songs in the night. 
My heart mused and my spirit inquired.. Will the Lord reflect forever?. Will 
He never show his favor again. Has this unfailing love vanished forever. Has 
his promise failed for all time. Has God forgotten to be merciful. Has the 
anger withheld his compassion. Then I thought, "To this I will appeal-the 
years of the right hand of the Most High. I will remember the deeds of the 
Lord. Yes I remember Your deedsof long ago. I will meditate on all Your 
works, and consider all Your mighty deeds. Your ways oh God are holy. What 
God is so great as our God!"
