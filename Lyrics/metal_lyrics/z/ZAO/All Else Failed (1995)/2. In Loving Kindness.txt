We are the new creation, the old has gone, the new has come. Reconcild us to 
Himself, through Christ Jeasus. We will be free, forever knowing what will 
become... of us. Thank you for the cross. Trusting in the balance has tilted 
me towards righteousness. Lifting my spirit once again, sinking not in my 
functioning. Striving to tell them the truth. Inhale, exhale this is over 
and over again. Looking for tomorrow forgetting about today. Striving to 
tell them the truth... Dying, dying, dying, dead. Through prayer and 
sacrifice into all the earth, with love and understanding. Now I look to 
importance, standing here steadfast, to renew the spirit within me. Do not 
cast me from Your presence, or take Your Holy Spirit from me.
