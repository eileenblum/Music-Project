What else is there. After the slipping away. When everything is silent, and 
nothing is around, alone. Looking dep inside, Hearing the echo of my soul. 
Noone can know. In these tims of silence, these times of seperation. I find 
there is a voice that rises up. A peace that brings my tears. A comfort that 
no one else can offer. So why do people turn away? Why do they look 
elsewhere and base their self on opinions? When the truth is so evident that 
this God of love is so constant. When everything is gone. Destruction and 
storms. My Jesus stands to help.
