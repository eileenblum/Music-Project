With open arms I'll be held down by the Spirit of God. I refuse to turn 
away. By the world and its lies. Everlasting words like water that fllows 
through my heart. As the wisdom runs deep within. Forseen throuh my savior. 
The completion has been done. With wisdom and truth inside. No reflections 
from the past will come, and there will be no misconception. That would turn 
my faith away when You are not with me. I will lift up my spirit to be with 
you. Life the endless maze will not be so narrow. Soon time will not have to 
wait. For soon I will go against what awaits me....
