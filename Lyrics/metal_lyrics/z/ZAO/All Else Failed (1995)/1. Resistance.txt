I won't allow it. I won't let it happen. This weakness will be strengthened. 
Take away this battle. Let our fire burn within. Purify. Purify. Don't 
release your hand from me. I must surrender, must lay it down. What's to 
gain from my selfishness? What will I promote, and what will be pushed back? 
My hope must rise, strength come forward. Linking my hand in yours. Let your 
chains uphold me. I won't break the bond. No more will I remain the same. My 
God has ever loved himself in me. I am convinced. I must stay.
