And what shall I do
I try to speak and words stop short of my tongue
They make their way back to my thoughts
Still crafted by a still soul
I move my eyes around trying to find a place to rest
I can't see it but I feel the light
Someone tell us we are loved
Someone take the pain away
Someone fill up the void
Someone fix my broken heart
Are you that someone? [6x]
