A dark cold sound...
A dark cold sound tears the life I'm given
Ignite the vision
The vision that brought cold wind against my childhood soul.
The root of unspoken fear
The root grows deep in my heart
A dark cold sound tears at my life
Over and over...
The time when rest is as distant as childhood
When I knew peace
The time when I was happy
The time when I knew peace
Before it came after me
It's coming after me
A dark cold sound
