Breathe
Come out of your stare
Touch the ground with your prayers
Breathe out the lies
Breathe
His words were sharpened hooks beneath your skin
You left them in
As he shone into the eyes around him
Cradled by a cold floor Isolation shows his true motivaiton
Her pedals are slowly torn away
Scarlet adorns the snow
Scarlet
