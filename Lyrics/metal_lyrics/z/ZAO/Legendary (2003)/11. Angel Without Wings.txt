Hold her in your right hand.
And guide her safely home.
Brush away all the thorns.
Find all the stones.
You're my angel without wings.
When I was crying you never left my side.
When I was dying you never left my side.
You're always there for me.
You're my angel without wings.
You were always without wings.
Without wings.
