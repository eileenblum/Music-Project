Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Beautiful child
Turning into stone with your eyes so dim
I shudder bitterness runs through your soul
Like small children confusion dances in the dusk
Of your mind
Exchange your blessings for deceptions
Good night
Kiss skin like winter cherished one
Fading away I can see your breath begging to resurrect into death
Hiding scars back
Laced with splinters audience of a congregation
Make your way to the front
Close your eyes and grieve you played
Your part so well.
