You think because you bought this record,
You read a list of thanks you can judge our lives (you've identified)
You think because you bought the record,
You read a list of thanks you've identified (you can judge out lives)
A favor we provide
Little forum boys with your polished cyber toys
I read your bucket comment
Your three piece bulletin
POUT POUT BOOO HOOO TALK TALK POUT BOO HOOO HOOO
How is out identity working out for you?
It's funny how you can justify me (us) on opinion
An idea that I do this for you
DXCBOY FIREKID
You know who you are (and what you do)
We wrote this song for you
