You failed to do your job.
Superstitious cover up.
They'll pay you because of your mistakes.
You lie, you lie, you lie and they pay.
You fail, you fail, you fail and they pay.
Superstition. Unholy children. '
Blinded vision. False ambition.
Can you show me how they're guilty?
You liars, you killers.
Blame the (so-called) unholy children.
With your blinded vision.
And your false ambition.
