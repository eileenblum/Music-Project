Suspension / Suspend.
Wires from the ceiling extend.
Suspend / Suspension.
Your teeth grind from the tension.

When the door breaks you are found suspended high.
Above the ground.

Suspension / Suspend.
Death took my old best friend.
Suspend / Suspension.
Your life is at attention.
Suspension
Suspension
You grind your teeth from the tension.
From the tension.

You are found suspended high above the ground.
Above the ground enclosed in wires.

What's this?
Death came you.
He does not respect the virtues.
Suspension
Suspend
Wires from the ceiling extend.
Your teeth grind from the tension.
As wires extend from the ceiling, extend.
Watching page's rotting.
I see Jesus rotting.

When the door breaks
And you are found suspended high.
Above the ground
Encased in wires
When the door breaks
And you are found suspended high.
Above the ground
Encased in wires
When the door breaks
When the door breaks
And they find you
Suspended by wires
By wires

Suspended by the Suspension lies
