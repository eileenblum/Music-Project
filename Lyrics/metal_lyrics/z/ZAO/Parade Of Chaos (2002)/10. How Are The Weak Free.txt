They will hunt again. With years to plan. And sharpen their teeth. But no one knows. No one knows. Free the wolf from its cage. Watch him hunt. Stalk his prey. We let them go. They will hunt again. Prey on the simple. Feast in the temple. Free the wolf? We must put him down. We'll put him down again. Our protectors hide and grin.
