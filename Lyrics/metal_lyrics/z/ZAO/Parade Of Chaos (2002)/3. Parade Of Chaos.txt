We march like fools in a parade of chaos.
We march like fools in a parade of chaos.
Led by our enemies. While we sing their praises.
Led by our enemies. While we kiss their hands.
The morning rain fired. Let the heavens retire.
Over the eyes of the blind. And the voices of spoiled children.
True leaders are gone. We turned our back too many times.
And bit the hand of the provider. Chaos kills us.
Chaos.
