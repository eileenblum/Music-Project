The fire burns, the fire burns 
As leaves they fall and twist and turn 
Gather thoughts to be unlearned 
Wooden cribs to marble urns 

Metallic paralyzed teeth rejoice 
At the sound of the spectreâs voice 
Alas the masses seek the answer 
Some grow rich some rot from cancer 
Despair to stillness, all is revealed 
Life is chaos, a spinning wheel 
We all are one and nothingâs real 
Nothingness is real 

The fire burns, the fire burns 
As leaves they fall and twist and turn 
Gather thoughts to be unlearned 
Wooden cribs to marble urns 

Conscious carbon from a dying star 
Living, breathing searching for a cause 
Everything around us observes itself through us 

The fire burns, the fire burns 
As leaves they fall and twist and turn 
Gather thoughts to be unlearned 
Wooden cribs to marble urns 

Oneness revealed 
Observed/Observer
