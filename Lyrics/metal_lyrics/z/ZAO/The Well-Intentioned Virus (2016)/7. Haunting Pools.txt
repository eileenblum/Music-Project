In a fevered dream 
A code was shown to me 
By disembodied 
Tongues clear and clean 

Youâll see it, but not with your eyes 
Obscured through our mortal disguise 

The maze-like depths 
Of the haunting pools 

If one were to arrive 
Below the line 
Pulled by the tide 
One canât come out 

This code the tongues have spoken 
âIt was broken when we found it 
(We found it like that)â 

Youâll see it, but not with your eyes 
Obscured through our mortal disguise 

The maze-like depths 
Of the haunting pools 

If one were to arrive 
Below the line 
Pulled by the tide 
One canât come out
