Woe to the vessel 
For it couldnât compose 
The igniting spark 

Oh, it shuddered 
And collapsed 
Beneath the weight of it all 
Slowly it is reassembled 
As a wound not seen but felt 

No sense of presence 
Oh, again it shudders 
Oh, again it collapsed 

The vessel 
It wept 
And crept behind the door 

Echoes dripping down the walls 
Crawling underneath the floor 

Procession to a grave 
Unknown is the one we mourn 

An entity lost on its way 
To this our physical plane 

It was a shadow 
Cast from a flame 
Indestructible energy that still remains
