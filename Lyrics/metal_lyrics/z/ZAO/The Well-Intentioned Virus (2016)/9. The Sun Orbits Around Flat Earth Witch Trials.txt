The sun, it orbits around flat earth witch trials 
Blood letters penned by leech collectors 

Against the grain 
Burned at the stake 
Deities fill the cavities 
In our mouths 

A well-worn path, future morphed into the past 
A ghost stuck in the cycles, lost in the infinite 
Haunting the house of rational thought 
Collapse while converging 

The past is fiction, forgotten and rewritten 
The present, now past, countless moments lapse 
The future, lost teacher, a looming callus creature 

The sun, it orbits around flat earth witch trials 

Crushed and maimed 
While shifting the blame 
Disfigured social disdain 
Again and again and again and again
