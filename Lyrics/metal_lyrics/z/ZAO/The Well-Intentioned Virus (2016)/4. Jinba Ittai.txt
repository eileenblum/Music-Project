I was born behind these eyes 
Sewn into this skin 
One with the flesh machine Iâm embedded in 

I hold my childrenâs breath 
Feel their motherâs pain 
Share my brotherâs blood 
Within my sisterâs veins 
Cry my motherâs tears 
Through my fatherâs eyes 
Tethered to this realm 
In consciousnessâ disguise 

A promise unspoken, for it could never be kept 
Offering passages of safety so the host wonât disconnect 

Yet the mouths of our graves sing songs of unknown places, 
And laugh as we struggle to escape 

I have lived behind these eyes 
Existed in this skin 
Defined by the flesh machine Iâm embedded in 

The mouths of our graves call these bodies home 

I will die behind these eyes 
Shed away this skin 
Detach from the flesh machine I was embedded in 

Separate perception conscious separates
