Come back to us 
Please return to your body 
Turn in place to see it 
Lying motionless below you 
Witness yourself from above 
Quiet as a winter night 
Still as a photograph 
Itâs time to return or pass on 

So scratch and crawl and climb your way back to us 

When a life is fading 
The fire dies, behind its eyes 
Staring cold and flameless 
The blood begins to digitize 
Unnaturally the pain dies 
Leaving oneâs true self erased and cauterized 

When a life is fading 
The fire dies, behind its eyes 

If you can hear my voice 
If it can find you in the void 
In a place between life and death 
Focus on the source of projection 
Follow it back to yourself 

Scratch, crawl, and climb back to us 

Come back to us 
Please return to your body 
Turn in place to see it 
Lying motionless below you 
Witness yourself from above 
Quiet as a winter night 
Still as a photograph 
Itâs time to return or pass on 

So scratch and crawl and climb your way back to us
