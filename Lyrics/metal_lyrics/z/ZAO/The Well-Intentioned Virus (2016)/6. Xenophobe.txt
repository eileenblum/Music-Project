Never cut by thought or thesis
Evoked by hollow, rabid speeches
That clot up and fall to pieces
Then turn to birds and spread diseases

It turns to chemical meditation
It turns to paranoia and frustration
It turns to gray rotting teeth
It turns to entitled, hateful beliefs

Implant a thought, sow the seed
Groom xenophobic racist steeds
Loud and dumb without folly
Shouting, "Stop evolving Uber Alles"

Logic and compassion regress to selfish superstitions

Implant a thought, sow the seed
Groom xenophobic racist steeds

It must be hell to live in fear
