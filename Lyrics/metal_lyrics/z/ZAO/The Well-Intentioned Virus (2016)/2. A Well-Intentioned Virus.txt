Anger casts shadows of doubt 
Inviting them in has hollowed you out 
The purest disgust one can ever feel 
It lives in our voice it guides our eyes 
Itâs forcing us to realize 
Weâre born from the fear, the fear of death 

Proven designs crush weakened minds 

Exceptions to the rule and anomalies 
Stir up violence with silver spoons 
Cries of persecution 
From the persecutors tongue 
The medium agitates the hive 

Frothing hordes of true believers 
You are right, yes you are right 
You have been chosen to ruin countless heathen lives 

Our path of sight through perception is soiled 
As our sanity turns spoiled 
Commands sent down by light and sound 
Imaginary generals lie tired from the war 
They will become what they abhor 
A well-intentioned virus posing as a cure
