They say death is an open door
Into another room
Within the city of the dead
(Our New Kingdom)

They say we walk like dreams
Sharing the same breath
Seeing through the same eyes
(A collective spirit)

As we pray on his grave our words fall and decay
The earth it gives no peace, nor does it take away
We all survive the grave
(Unfortunate eternal)

They say that in times past
A king walked in the sky
Until dethroned by man
(Tribe of Judas)

Truly, truly, this is the end
It's not the same
I'm plagued with pain and I can't let go
This is the end
