Bombs rain down like heaven's tears, the earth shall die and disappear; (and today) we wish the sky was grey, (for now they're) just
black and empty
Ripped and torn from inside out, things too dark to think about, no miracles, no bleeding hands, God has parted...
And when the end she comes, rains down on everyone, fire from the sky, and when the end she rides, breathing out suicide, life and
death are one
As a flame burns to touch the sky, so it shall be with man's cry, and this night all will pass away, (and this night we shall die as
one)
