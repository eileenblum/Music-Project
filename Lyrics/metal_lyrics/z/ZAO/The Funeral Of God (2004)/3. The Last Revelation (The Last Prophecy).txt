There were none at his left hand, no man amongst his army, the earth has ripped herself open, and birthed from her wounds thick
black clouds which covered the earth
It tears, I see blood in the air, I taste blood in the air, dissected from heaven, cut and stripped of her skin, we let it begin
descending from heaven
An all-consuming cancer, reaching to repent, we will taste hate in its purest form, reching out for nothing,
choking on our words, while we hold our children
No cradle, no son, a mother of none
