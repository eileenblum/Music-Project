[Japanese album version track]

Every kiss is a goodbye kiss
And every touch is momentary
Like trying to hold her ghost
Yes she dissapears at sunrise
Some times the past is all we have
I see you in my mind so clearly
A salvation to these tired, cold and searching eyes
We fade, we fade away like dream
We come apart at the seam
Every moment comes to an end
Just another fading memory
She let life destroy her
Move through me like a ghost
No one to break thier blades
No one to cut their throats

All of your words will wash away
My broken heart stills mends
But you could care less anyway
