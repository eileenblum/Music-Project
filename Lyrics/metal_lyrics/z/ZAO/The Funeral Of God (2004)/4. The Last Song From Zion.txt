His shadow floats upon the earth,
Casting a song from the north (upon the earth),
Yeashua weeps a Zion song thy will of man,
My kingdom gone,
You place all your hatred upon my throne,
Your hands from your own path,
Curse the one that has made you,
I see Cain in all your eyes.
I am laying down to go to sleep forever,
I do not hide my face in shame at all,
I do not cower before your blade,
This is what your black hearts pray.
Time moves as slow as the oceans tide,
Neon explosion in the haggard sky,
No sun shall set,
Lest we forget,
Man's will be done,
The last lamb,
The last hope,
The last song from Zion.
