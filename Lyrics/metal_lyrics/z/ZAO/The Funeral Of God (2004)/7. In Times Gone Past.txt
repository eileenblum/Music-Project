I see it in your eyes, the tearing in your heart, as I awaken I learn first, first of dying, and lying inside the ground forgotten,
I learn of love, I learn of terror, I feel the curse inside my body, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me and put this curse
inside my body, we live within a curse and within the divine, we're born and raised to work, and then grow old and die (in our
golden time), strange, cut and burnt then thrown into the tide (I have lived and died), lie beneath the ground, ascend into the sky,
I feel the earth spinning slow, and winding down with the sun, I feel the curse inside my body, running through my veins into my
mind
