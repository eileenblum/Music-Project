The lesser lights of heaven are burning towards a dream, the eyes of mother bleeding, cast their children to the sea
The lesser lights of heaven are screaming in our mind, listening to the chorus, so divine and unkind
The lesser lights of heaven are burning for their son, praying for the presence, that birthed them into one
The lesser lights of heaven, their bodies but a flame, a sky that knows no distance, a cut that feels no pain
The lesser lights of heaven are bending towards your will, cutting through the person, who would rather die than kill
The lesser lights of heaven cast crowns before your throne, dissipate into nothing, we truly are alone
Can we live through this?  The lesser lights of heaven
