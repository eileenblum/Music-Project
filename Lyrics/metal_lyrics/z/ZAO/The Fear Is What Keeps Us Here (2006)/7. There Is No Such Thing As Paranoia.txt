There is no such thing as paranoia
Walking living nightmares embodied in a horrifying form keep your fears in front of you
Or they might crawl up your back
These things are based in reason
The fact came to life from fiction
A response based on condition
Reason can quickly abandon the mind
On her hands and knees she cleaned up
The blood her mother spilt
Did you see the look in his lifeless eyes?
The poor boy with a hole in his head
Caved in with the claw of a hammer
Swung by an arm of cruel intent
This is no dream
This is happening
