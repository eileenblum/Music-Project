My love, my love we've come back from the dead
It's been seven years
Past the seventh day
On the seventh night
Crawl from within the earth tonight
The wind it howls, the wind it screams
Pulled up like puppets on invisible strings
Rise from the earth
Undead breath of life
Holy revenge shall take place tonight
(The dead travel fast)
My love, my love we will feast tonight
On the flesh of our enemies
Who put us in the ground
The ones who put us in the ground
With their blood on our hands
We shall be able to rest again
Rest in the arms of our grave
