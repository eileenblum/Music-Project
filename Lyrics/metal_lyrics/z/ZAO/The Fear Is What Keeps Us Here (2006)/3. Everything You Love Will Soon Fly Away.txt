Everything you love will fly away
On the wings of an unknown destiny
Behind the sun and disappearing sky
Everyone you love will pass away
Some before, some after, some together
Somewhere along the way
Everything you are will be forgot
Your memory dies with those who knew you
History itself grows old and falls apart
Everything you've gathered will be lost
Ripped from your hands by fate's Desire
Or the entropic breath of time
Everything we are, we are when we're alone
Chaos and order stand side by side
One day sitting on the top of the world
The next day dying on the side of the road
