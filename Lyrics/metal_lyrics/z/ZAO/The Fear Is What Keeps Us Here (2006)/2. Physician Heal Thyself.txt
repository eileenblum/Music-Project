Physician heal thyself
Can you cut yourself precise and deep
As to reach in and remove what's dying inside of you
A colossus of irony
Physician heal thyself
With great intelligence and experience
Can you prescribe a way not to die alone
We are not what we are
The structure deconstructing
Arrogance and blasphemy
There are no controls
Like the unfortunate patient
The physician dies sick and
Alone
