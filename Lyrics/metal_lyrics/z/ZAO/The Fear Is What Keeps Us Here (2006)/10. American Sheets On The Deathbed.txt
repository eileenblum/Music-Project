Liberty and justice for those who can afford it
There's American sheets on the deathbed
And American bombs in the sky
American ghosts in the graveyard
The American heart beats in the TV
One nation above God
Himself
There's American fangs on the serpent
And American blood on his tie
American pride in his heartstrings
American venom drips from the TV
He who controls the all-seeing eye
Would rather kill than live in peace
We are monsters in the eyes of the world
Divided while we conquer
