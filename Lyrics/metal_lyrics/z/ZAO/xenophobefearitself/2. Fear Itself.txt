Itâs here again

A black mist that creeps into the air
Hangs like a veil and turns off the stars
To the thoughts in the halls of my mind
Softly it speaksâ¦

ARISE ARISE ARISE

I let go and fell into the sky
Unable to blink or close my eyes

The world is torn apart
and reality rearranged
In a soft voice it speaksâ¦

DESCEND DESCEND DESCEND

I fell from the heavens
Into the sea
The hands of the water wrapped chains around me

Placing fear in my heart
and death in my eyes
In a soft voice it speaksâ¦
OBEY OBEY OBEY

I wander the earth apart from the rest
Their eyes and laughter dance on my back
I am filled with their pain
Till just numbness remains

The mist hovers
Dark and quiet
In a soft voice it speaksâ¦
DECAY DECAY DECAY
