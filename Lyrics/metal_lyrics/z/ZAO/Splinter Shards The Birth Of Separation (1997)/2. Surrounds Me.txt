put your coal to my trembling lips.
voice fills void with your breath.
crescent tears from the relief You bring.
undone in You. I love You.
broken teeth of my frustration.
your glory it surrounds me.
sing praises to God, sing praises.
blanket my mind with Your wisdom and insight.
hand molds the mud of my heart.
joy of Your strength
overwhelms my praise.
quickened in You.
I praise you.
vibrant peace envelopes my lack.
Your glory it surrounds me.
sing praises to God.
sing praises.
