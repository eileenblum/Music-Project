thank You for the cross.
trusting in the balance
has tilted me towards righteousness.
lifting my spirit once again
sinking not in my functioning.
inhale, exhale this over and over again.
looking for tomorrow.
forgetting about today.
striving to tell the truth...
dying, dying, dying, dead.
through prayer and sacrifice into all the earth
with love and understanding.
now i look to the importance,
standing here steadfast
to renew the spirit within me.
do not cast me away from Your prescence
or take Your Holy Spirit from me.
