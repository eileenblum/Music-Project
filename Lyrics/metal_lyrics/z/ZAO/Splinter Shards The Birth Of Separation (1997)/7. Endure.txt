i will endure.
it will endure in me.
until the end forever,
i will endure.
if we continue in these ways,
rebellion bends towards hatred.
we rise up for our cause
and forsake the outsiders.
where is this love, this understanding?
who will stand?
what will break down
if this uprise of self is left to reign?
looking forward, for a standard to uphold.
an answer to the questions.
the wavering of beliefs lead to destruction.
nothing remains constant to its origin.
but the unchanging faith of Christ,
the One stable since creation.
thoughts have come and theories have gone.
nothing has lasted through resistance.
but who can deny, who can dispute
the faith that's been throughout
since the foudation of the beginning?
it has always been and will always be.
forever.
it has been proven. it shall remain.
this faith has stood the test.
it persists through conflict,
through the revolt against its ways.
nothing has held true like this.
no other has revealed such strength.
the roots run deep within,
entangling around my Rock.
never letting go of this truth,
the power that has sustained me.
i will endure in what i believe
and it will endure in me...
