once again to strive, to beat it out
over and over again.
so worn, worked over
with the intention to kill.
to watch him die and smile
at his destiny
his pain,
my deliverance.
my cleanliness a gift of freedom.
my walk purified.
my peace given by God.
what else is there
after slipping away.
when every thing is silent
and nothing else is around?
alone.
looking deep inside.
hearing the echo of my soul,
no one can know.
in these times of silence,
these times of seperation,
i find there is a void that rises up,
a peace that bridges my tears,
a comfort that no one else can offer.
so why do people run away?
why do the look elsewhere and base
their self on opinions
when the truth is so evident that this
God of love is so constant?
destruction and storms.
my Jesus stands to help.
