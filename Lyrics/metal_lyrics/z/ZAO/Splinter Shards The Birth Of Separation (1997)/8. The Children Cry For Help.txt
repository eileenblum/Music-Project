no eyes have seen.
no ears have heard.
no mind has perceived
what God has prepared for those that love Him.
multitudes behold His glory
and give praises for what He has done.
in the time of need the children cry for help.
many searching for a void to be filled,
while in stride they fall to their face in
tears or laughter
after the release of His abundance.
has His unfailing love vanished forever?
has His promise failed for all time?
has God forgotten to be merciful?
has the anger withheld His compassion?
Jesus, my Lord and Savior,
though my mind wonders of what i
have not seen, heard, or conceived,
i will turn my focus to You.
