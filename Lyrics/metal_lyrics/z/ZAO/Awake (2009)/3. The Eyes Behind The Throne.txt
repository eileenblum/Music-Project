The eyes behind the throne beam fear into our minds, beg for us to borrow
Scared to roam outside our cages.
Lost in fluorescent mazes.
Loopholes and unwanted favors.
At war for our future.
At war for the past.
A war we cannot grasp, grasp.
Life's a game played until you die.
Will they ever tell you who's right?
Control the mislead.
Over-opinionated.
Undereducated.
Apprentice above its master.
Rewrite and reprogram.
At war for our future.
At war for the past.
A war we cannot grasp.
Life's a game played until you die.
Will they ever tell you who's right?
Control the mislead.
