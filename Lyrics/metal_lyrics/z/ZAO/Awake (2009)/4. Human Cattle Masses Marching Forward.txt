Human cattle masses marching forward.
Their eyes are blank and erratic, susceptible to the droning hypnosis that rides through dissonant skies.
Loud and arrogant choir like voices, singing as they trample the earth and the truths of the past.
Violence meets their opposition.
Human cattle masses marching forward.
Scared and consuming, wearing their masters brand.
Questioning not where they are going.
Human cattle masses marching forward... forward... forward... forward.
