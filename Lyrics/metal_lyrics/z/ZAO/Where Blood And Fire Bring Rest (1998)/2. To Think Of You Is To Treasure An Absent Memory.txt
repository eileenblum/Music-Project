When you shut your eyes and fell asleep 
Dark clouds descended on the souls of the ones 
Who held you close to their hearts 
Close to their hearts 

My heart broke [3x]
Open [4x]

The beauty of an embrace a place 
To lay down the pain 
Where blood and fire bring rest and peace [4x]

I sit away in a secret place the shadow of wings 
I think of you [7x]
And my heart breaks open
