Your eyes [2x]
Your eyes search for me [4x]
Your eyes 
Your eyes search for me 

For so long I've wanted to come home 
Held back by lies of serpents and tongues of brothers 
Turning a child into an enemy 
Turning open arms into closed fists 

I could see the reflection in the tears 
That made their way down Your face 
Onto the ground I kneel upon 
They form a river that overtakes me 
Compassion envelops me 
I forgive and release 
Forgive, release 
Forgiven, released
