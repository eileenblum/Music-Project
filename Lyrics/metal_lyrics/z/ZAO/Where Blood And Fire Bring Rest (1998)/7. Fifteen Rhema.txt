My heart is deceived by 
My eyes my actions in the name of beauty 
I'm sickened and strangled 
By myself that I would allow an unyielded desire to lead me astray 
Put to shame by my lack of trust I confess my faults with tears 

Manifestations of Your grace fill me 
Revelations of forgiveness wounds healed by wounds 
The Father's mercy 
Peace beyond understanding love from You 
That I don't deserve 
Don't deserve [4x]
I shut my eyes I still my feelings 
Feelings, feelings 
Listening with closed eyes I rest in Your guidance 
I rest in Your guidance 
Trusting You 
Sensing You I listen and hear 
Abide in me [4x]
