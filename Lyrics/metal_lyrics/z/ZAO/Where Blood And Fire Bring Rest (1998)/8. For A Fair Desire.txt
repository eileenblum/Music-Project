Let me not exist for a fair desire sweet and fresh 
Are my expectations of this inner strength 
That yearns passionately 
For the endowment of the Father 
I sow in tears that later I shall reap in joy 
Each drop that I sow will be a time of breaking [3x]

Come Holy Spirit empower Your creation 
Through times of breaking the planting of tears as I am broken 
Your presence grows stronger 
I feel You with me upholding me through it all 

Let me not exist for a fair desire sweet and fresh 
Are my expectations of this inner strength 
That yearns passionately 
For the endowment of 

Each drop that I sow is a time of breaking 
A time of breaking
