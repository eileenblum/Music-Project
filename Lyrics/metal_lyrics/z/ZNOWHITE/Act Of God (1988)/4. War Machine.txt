Youâre no stranger
Youâve been this way before
Time and time again
For senseless reasons why
Bringer of danger
Like the scars that are left when a baby is born
Youâll taste my fire and ice

Oh! You feel me coming
As fate is knocking at your door
Ah! My burning hunger
Bringing pain for evermore

[Chorus:]
I am the war machine that stares you in the face
Eyes to the sky and you know the end is near
I am the war machine; I can burn the sun from the sky
Take away tomorrow; bring truth to all your fears

Eyes of fire
That burn with desolation
Your cries of pity cast aside
Mind of destruction
And Iâll take away all your promised dreams
You take for granted, I take for free

Oh! You feel me coming
As fate is knocking at your door
Ah! My burning hunger
Bringing pain for evermore

[Chorus]

Pray for justice
But I doubt this day will come
You feel your back against the wind
Try to fight me
So you take your sword at hand
Iâm living death, oh canât you see

Oh! You feel me coming
As fate is knocking at your door
Ah! My burning hunger
Bringing pain for evermore

[Chorus]

Raping thunder
The smell of burning bones
Not a thing for eyes to see
The stench of raging death
The vows of vengeance kept
All unlucky cannot flee

Using infra red
Attacking in the dark
Danger starts to take its toll
Blood infested soil
Encrusted fields of hate
See them die young and old

[Chorus]
