Disease ridden corpse
Half dead, half alive
Night falls, the devil calls
Shrapnel in my eyes

A torrid yell
Of war is hell
As agony prevails
A deadly mass
A sonic blast
A fog of acid rain

[Chorus:]
Youâll never come again
You want this hell to end
Your fight is to be free
So rest in peace

Asleep from all the pain
A faded memory
Safely sound to sleep
So rest in peace

With shattered minds
The thought of death comes as relief
Close your eyes and silence falls
Death is what we seek

A killing force
With no remorse
With mental health of glass
With suicide
He takes his life
Finally free at last

[Chorus]

One through the skull
Take it right through the head
A smoking gun
Smell of freedom in the air
Killing you is killing me

War, it just ainât fair
Watch them die, one by one
And no one really cares

[Chorus]
