March for the fatherland before thereâs no hope
For the cause supremacy
Tell the young ones shape still forming thoughts
In the Fuhrer they believed

His vicious logic spreads
But still they overlooked
To late to stop it now
They succeeded once
Donât let it happen here
Power of man can bring you down

Fight it back no matter what the price
If it means bloodshed to be free
All others taken humanity forsaken
Noble blood is what we seek

[Chorus:]
As one nation we shall rise
Control all under the sun
Divide and conquer is our cry
For the cause
Pure blood

Jack boots smash the pavement
Hear crying families never saw, never heard a thing
Spread propaganda to shield all worthless lies
In they Fuhrer they believed

His vicious logic spreads
But still they overlooked
To late to stop it now
They succeeded once
Donât let it happen here
Power of man can bring you down

Fight it back no matter what the price
If it means bloodshed to be free
Put through crucifixion never explained detention
The dying scream as though relieved

[Chorus]

Arrived at hell on earth
Where peace is what you want
Herder like cattle never to be found
They took their pride away
Stripped life of all itâs meaning
Blatant racist tear them down

His vicious logic spreads
But still they overlooked
To late to stop it now
They succeeded once
Donât let it happen here
Power of man can bring you down

Fight it back no matter what the price
If it means bloodshed to be free
Donât dream of freedom, donât speak your mind
Donât you ever make a sound

[Chorus]

Now I lay down to sleep
They burn my bones to ash
Led to showers that rinse my soul
My shadowâs final cast
A rancid smell of rotten flesh
Covering fields of grey
Insanity is sanity
When counting numbered days

Slaughtered by the thousands
They took them one by one
Why didnât they have a fighting chance
Racism gone too far
Preserve the noble blood
Destruction from the mind of man

His vicious logic spreads
But still they overlooked
To late to stop it now
They succeeded once
Donât let it happen here
Power of man can bring you down

Fight it back no matter what the price
If it means bloodshed to be free
We make your destiny
We take your history
By use of force youâll comprehend

[Chorus]
