If you have not a fault
Then you cast the first stone
Perfect man is not
So leave us alone

Harsh reality
Self righteous holocaust
Kill those who donât equate
Show them Pharaohâs might

[Chorus:]
Sweet land of liberty
Spill your venom in my eyes

Take away all thatâs promised
Denied birth-given rights
Land that kills any thought
Daring to be free
Righteous minds swilling poison
Distort reality
Blood is thick
Water thin
Listen (to) what I say
Born to learn unwritten law
The way to blindly hate
I am a man, call me sir
This way shall it be
This disease brings others death
Stricken down bigotry

Driving me to kill
With your Golden Rule
Terminate the ill
By injecting you

Trapped in the land of the free
Treated like second-rate
Enduring constant hell
From cradle to the grave

[Chorus]

Who gives you the right
To say I pity you
And what makes hatred live?
Hatred is you

You slip through the cracks
Cause they donât give a damn
Father feed your child
Beg, borrow what you can

[Chorus]
