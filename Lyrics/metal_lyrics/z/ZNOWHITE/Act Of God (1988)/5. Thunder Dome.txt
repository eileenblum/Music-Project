Two men enter
One man leave

You make promises that you never keep
Seems like your only purpose in life
Is to give me grief

Crawling maggot is what you are
Always talk behind my back
Spineless one show your face
Tread on me youâll wish you never had

[Chorus:]
I may be down
But never out
Submit to no one
Remain unbowed

Donât turn your back
Cause Iâm coming
This oneâs just for you
Cause you call me nothing
Donât turn your back
Cause Iâm coming
This bulletâs got your name
And Iâm gunning

I donât know what you been told
But listen up and listen good
Keep it up with the games you play
And you know youâre bound to lose

Kindness is weakness to those
That use others for their own game

Nothing more than a parasite
Trusting done in vain

[Chorus]

Friendship is such a deadly word
Find out what it really means
Iâm amused of what itâs been said
Itâs off my name you feed

Two men enter
One man leave
