Father can you help me now
Iâve fallen weak again
Father can you hear me now
I canât go on

[A-CHORUS:]
Pushed to far
Meet my standards
Make them proud

Kill because I tell you to
Firstborn son
Donât want to see no tears

[B-CHORUS:]
The dream appears
When I close my eyes
Someday that bastard dies

Son he says
Youâll be sent away
To make me proud
And to make them pay

Baptised by fire
Baptised by fire

Seems like only yesterday
I was a boy without a care
Now I got to make them pay
Or be sent home in a bag

[A+B CHORUSES]

Father tells me not to cry
Youâre a man and not a boy
He tells me hold my head up high
Even when Iâve got nothing to pride

Listen to mamma boy and youâll be weak
Do as I say and not as I do
He says itâs nothing when he needs a drink
Boy Iâm a man and I made you

[A+B CHORUSES]

Youâve got no right
To send off to war
Kill or be killed
Are you proud while Iâm being scarred?

They say that Iâm a soldier now
Time to show your might
Feels like spending time in hell
And my mind isnât right

Ten years later tell them I am a man
But Iâm still locked away
Father says didnât go as planned
Ashamed of me so itâs best I stay

[A+B CHORUSES]
