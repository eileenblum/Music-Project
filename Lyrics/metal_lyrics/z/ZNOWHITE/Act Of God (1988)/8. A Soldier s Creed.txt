I wasnât put hear to eat no fucking dirt
Ainât about to kiss nobodyâs ass
You pay me now cause we wonât be here later
Think for myself and you call me trash

I wasnât put here to do your dirty work
Swallow my pride, forget it
You want my lifeâs work, my total dedication
Death in return, forget it

Democracy sweet sounding word
Liberty, hand to hand
Feed them lies, no body counts
Make them fight for the land

Make them think that victoryâs near
Even when we fall
Let them not see the casualties
That our deceit has spawned

[Chorus:]
Believe in no one but yourself
Trust in no one cursed is man
Why must we kill?
Why must we die?
Your logic reasons make me sick
And youâll cause manâs demise

Never will I surrender
As long as I have the will to resist
Never will I surrender
As long as breath flows through me

My country âtis of thee
Has fooled us once again
Believed in you and you lied to me
Running smooth as planned

You say your fightâs for freedom
Land where our fathers died
Financing justice
While unfed babies cry

[Chorus]

South of the border you pry and instigate
Looking for another war and now youâve found the place
Itâs their trouble, their beliefs then why are we involved
Seeking war with bated breath look at the damage youâve caused
Home of the brave, land of the free
Politicians help them selves
Cause they sure not helping me

[Chorus]
