Draw the curtain
Put out the light
Store the young ones down below
Hear the silence
Hear it scream
Anticipate the incineration

[Chorus:]
They were trusted but theyâre breached
Thereâs a lesson we must teach
Only itâs too late
Something wicked this way comes

Air raid siren through the night
Something deathly will occur
Invasion quickly cracks the sky
It never dawned this day would come
Is the nightmare really real?
Damned to live senses numb

[Chorus]

All shall perish at your feet
Crucifixion weâve conceived
Like a present from the sun
Something wicked this way comes

Molesting famine takes to the land
Molten tear drops from a heart of stone
Wretched injection forged from deception
Souls of wrought iron scorched to the bone

Ashes to ashes
In God we trust
Manâs power beyond control
Dust to dust
Cain kills Abel
Man will never learn
Start again, burn it down
Destroy by their control

[Chorus]
