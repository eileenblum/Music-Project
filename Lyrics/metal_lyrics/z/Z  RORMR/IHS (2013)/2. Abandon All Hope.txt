In the midway of my mortal life
I have found myself in a gloomy woodS, astray
Gone from the path I walked alone
like a lunatic... every day
Slumbering, a wretched dream that's running
through my veins, Nothing is as it seems:
only madness, suffering and DECAY!

Through me you pass
Into the city of woe
Through me you pass
Into the black glow!

Never to walk the Earth again
For as long as I shall "live" inside this world
Of torment and agony. Condemned forever
Slowly I unfold Festering,
a punishment that feels almost like relief
Immortality is just a lie, a curse, Devil's seed...

[LEAD: QUAZARRE]

Torment, agony and death!

[LEAD: QUAZARRE]

Abandon all hope, ye who enter here
What's done is done. And even memories
that remain Can't change the day
and things to come.
Whispering inside my head
the voice of God!

Through me you pass
Into the city of woe
Through me you pass
Into the black glow!
