Incinerate, my the remnants of my dismal soul
Devour the flesh and blood, hear my call!

The only comfort in death I'll feel!
So arouse my body with terror and fear
Mortify my heart and devour it all
In this ritual of blood
Stigmatize my soul with the mark of Cain
In the river of Styx, let me drown!

Liberate me, from the chains of despair
Enlighten the path I chose
Hear my prayer!
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done!
You are the Bringer of Light,
Son of Dawn!

[LEAD: QUAZARRE]

All hail to The Morning Star!
All hail to The Light-Bearer!
All hail to The First Fallen Angel
All hail to the Master, Lucifer!

Incinerate, the remants of my dismal soul
Burn down the temple of flesh and blood
Hear my call!
And liberate me, from the chains of despair
Enlighten the path I chose
Hear my prayer!
God!
