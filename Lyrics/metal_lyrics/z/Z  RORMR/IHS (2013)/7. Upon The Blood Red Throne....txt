Fire, Air
Earth, Water

Conquest, War,
Famine, Death

Upon the Blood Red Throne
I am the Crimson King
My enemies destroyed
Their bodies at my feet

[LEAD: MOLOCH]

Submit to infernal reign
And take the oath
My crown of thorns
My scepter's made of nails

Behold the five winged star
It feasts on Christiansâ souls
My kingdom standing strong
Their corpses turned to dust

Silence, Again, and again!

[LEAD: MOLOCH]

Satan! Lucifer!
Belial! Leviathan!
