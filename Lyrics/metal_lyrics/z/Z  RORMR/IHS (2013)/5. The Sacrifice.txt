Involuntarily
Broken glass interrupted
A clockwork symphony
Of adolescent body,
Arousal withered slothfully
And alleviated her submersion
Over nothingness

And only stained innocence
Remained alongside oblation
Lurking lasciviously
At virginal soma
Savagely disrobed

[LEAD: MOLOCH]

Into hollow likeness
Her descent last...

While beautiful arrogance
Of heavens continued
Sordidly, willows alone
Lamented indeed, soriness
With anathema enswathed
The crucifix!

A whimsical architecture
Of broken flowers on her grave
Congealed in eternal rapture
Another sacrifice
In vain

Sacrifice!
