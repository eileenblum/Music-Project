Apocalypse, as I lift the veil of lies
There is no escape
From terror, The Four Horseman at my side.
The end is coming!
Destruction and demise
I am the bringer of pain
No one shall oppose me!
And Hallowed by my name!

"If the radiance of a thousand suns
were to burst into the sky
that would be like the splendor
of the Mighty Oneâ
I am become Death
the shatterer of Worlds"

Trinity! See the downfall of man,
Begin the sacrifice...
Hell on earth and eternal
damnation under blood red skies!
Abaddon! I bring the destruction of world.
My Kingdom Come
This I command
I rule the barren land
My will be done!

[LEAD: QUAZARRE]

Now I am, become Death!
