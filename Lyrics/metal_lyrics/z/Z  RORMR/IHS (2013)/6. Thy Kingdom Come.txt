Thy kingdom come, thy will be done!
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done!
Motherfucker!

Starry sky above me and moral law within
The temple of flesh rising, and I shall defend
Heartrending remnants of my bitter victory
The monuments of sadness at horizon's end...

[LEAD: MOLOCH]

Behold the great tribulation! False prophets rise
In the Holy See. A true majestic being
Of dazzling brightness manifests. Satan is Christ
Triumphant and unmatched.

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done!
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done!
Motherfucker!

Father, forgive me for I have sinned
with my thought, word, deed and omission...
Father, I repent, absolve my sins
and make worthy
Again.

[LEAD: MOLOCH]

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done!
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done!
