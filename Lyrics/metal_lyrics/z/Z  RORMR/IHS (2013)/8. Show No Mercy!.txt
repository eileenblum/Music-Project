Slaughter! Blood is running down the streets!
Terror! Dead corpses at my feet!
Evil! Spreading just like a disease!
Satan! Mankind finally at itâs knees...

Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
You've reached the end, prepare to die...

Horror! The dead rising from their graves!
Mayhem! Demons feasting on His slaves!
Havoc! Judgement Day is now at hand!
Brothers! Tonight we make our stand!

Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
You've reached the end, prepare to die...

[LEAD: QUAZARRE]

The End of Days begins!
