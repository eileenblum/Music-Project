And they came unto a place called Golgotha
To crucify the Son of God! No!

Total darkness, total pain, hung on the cross 
He cried out loudly saying:
"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
And then he yielded up his soul...

[LEAD: QUAZARRE]

And the graves were opened, bodies arose
He descended down below... Below!

Katelthonta eis ta katÃ´tata!

[LEAD: QUAZARRE]

Into the heart of darkness!
Into the lake of fire!
Into the mouth of madness!
Into the prison of liars!

Sheol! Gehenna!
He has arrived...

Behold the House of Satan, destroyed!
By the Son of God, Almighty - Pantocrator!
The prisoners are fleeing from their cells
Freed by the One, triumphant
That conquered Death!

[LEAD: QUAZARRE]

And he ascended into Heaven
And is seatet at the Right Hand of the Father...

Katelthonta eis ta katÃ´tata!
