Hail Moloch, Hail The True God!
Hail Moloch, Hail The King of Kings!
Hail Moloch, Hail The Brother of Chemosh!
Hail Moloch, Hail The Lord of Gehenna!

But in vain you do worship me
teaching for doctrines
the commandments of men
So I call the multitude
and say once again
Hear and understand:

Sons of Ammon!
with fire shall I bless
your abominable offspring
to become immortal,
to be cleansed.

Hail Moloch, Hail The True God!
Hail Moloch, Hail The King of Kings!
Hail Moloch, Hail The Brother of Chemosh!

Burn! The furnace of life cries out in hunger
Waiting to be fed with human flesh
Burn! The seven gates are open to devour
All, blood is spilled and the seed is sown...

[Lead: Quazarre]

Sons of Ammon!
I accept your sacrifice
redeem and be reborn
to live forever
and forever to die

Hail Moloch, Hail The True God!
Hail Moloch, Hail The King of Kings!
Hail Moloch, Hail The Brother of Chemosh!
Hail Moloch, Hail The Lord of Gehenna!
