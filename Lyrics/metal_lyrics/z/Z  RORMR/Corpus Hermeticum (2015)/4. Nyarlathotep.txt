I am the one who walks the earth
I am the true terror
I am the one who mourns the dead
I am the Crawling Chaos

The mad faceless God

I am the one who knows no shame
I am the pure horror
I am the one who comforts the slain
I am the Crawling Chaos

The messenger of Outer GODS

[Lead: Moloch]

I am the one who weaves the thread
I am the bringer of sorrow
I am the harbinger of death
I am the Crawling Chaos

The haunter of the dark

[Lead - Quazarre]
