[Lead: Moloch]

Even though,
I walk the valley of shadow of death
I am the Crawling Chaos!
Festering... at the catafalque of mankind
Torn apart by lies, again a sacrifice
In vain...

[Lead: Quazarre]

In delightful solitude I remain
Neither like a wild beast or a god...

Crowned with thorns, anointed with blood
Bathing in the stench of death forevermore

Lies - they mark my soul
With a promise of consolation
As I wait in line to die...

[Lead: Moloch]

Never to speak again, nor to dream
Only to fulfill the promise of hell

Full circle
A new terror born in death.
I am a new superstition
Entering... the unassailable fortress of forever.
Dead alive, as daylight dim my eyes
Again...

I Am Legend!
