Hear the wisdom from life's school of war:
what does not kill me makes me stronger!

I deny the false Being and Becoming
I reject the four errors in the true world!

I embrace the centuries of knowledge,
I indulge myself in reason to realize
That life is just a game we play with the Gods,
Nothing more than a bunch of

Lies!

Let me proclaim your greatness!
Let me resound your praises!
For thou art the true heir of Gods,
The Last of Us, the twilight of all times...
