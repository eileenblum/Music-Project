In the name of Poimandres,
This I command!

Show me the way through the threefold World
And teach me the mysteries of magick
So I receive all the virtues of Gods
And shall be equal to Thoth

[Lead: Moloch]

In the name of the Four Elements
This I command!

From tabula reveal to me
All the secrets of man,
Now!
What is true and remote from all cover
Of falsehood
So I shall by this means acquire the glory
O the whole world!

Deny me nothing from above and below
So I shall forever subdue your power
Oh Father, my Lord...

In the name of I,
With universe combined!

[Lead: Quazarre]
