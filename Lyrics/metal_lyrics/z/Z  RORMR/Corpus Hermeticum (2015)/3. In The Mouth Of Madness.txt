Behind the curtains of sanity
A slow descent into maelstrom
Down below the stairs of death
Into the deepest part of hell...

Sailing through the labyrinth of veins
Again, under the stars aligned

"I reject your reality
and substitute my own!"
I am the conqueror worm
Defiling the throne

Inside the nucleus of darkness
A monument of broken hopes
Stands above the ruins of heart
Corrupt to embellish my fall...

Submerged for aeons in nothingness
Domain, dreaming dead, yet alive

"I reject your reality
and substitute my own!"
I am what lies beneath the dome
Enslaving them all...

[Lead: Moloch]

Behold! the event horizon
devouring the black nests!
As I consume the planet earth
In the mouth of madness!

[Lead: Quazarre]

"I reject your reality
and substitute my own!"
I am the emperor of Rome
Conquering the world

Through the thorns to the stars
An ornament, chain of despair
A mirage of the times to come
Forever edged into my soul...
