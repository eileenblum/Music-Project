Oh insane monotony,
thy ludicrous structures
alternate not...

Mortification, sans violance
she watered boredom flowerets
singing merciful canto
of sombre annoyance...

Without apologies
ingorged I was by existance invalid,
far beyond atonement.

Inveigled with silence,
again...

Trying to return the indearment,
licking sorrily her ego
with my defiance... 

...Oblivion,
echoes invidiously within...

Exanimate me...
where ill-omened heart festers
still, drowning our memories
in soothing whirlpools
of absinthe

Again and again...
