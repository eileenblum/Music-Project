...And they had a king over them,
which is the angel of the bottomless pit,
whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon,
but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon...

Nightmares, they never go away
enslaved with fear, trembling even as I pray...

...And I saw a falling star from heavens above
carrying the key below the ground...

Hollows of eternity!

...And there arose a smoke out of the bottomless pit
darkening the sun and the air with grief...

Echoes of humanity!

Angel... rise with the tormenting locust
Angel... drown the withering hopes in
Embers... fall into the darkness within 
Anger... sore heart mourning at the carcass...

Of God!

Over the horizon of despair
Meaningless idols' expiring glare
Deceived by the prophet, awakened
Between life and death, forever
I am!
