Infuriate my stillness
with a blasphemous verse,
until I fall in ashes
of dreams that we once shared...

Nothing can bring us solace,
no comfort is here to stay,
nevermore in Heaven
banished and always astray...

Imprisoned below the Earth,
the burden of light you bear.
Renounced above from your birth.
Morning Star that you once were!
Shattered wings, pride is burnt,
hollow soul in endless chains.
Destined to never return,
unable to fly again.

Antichristos!
Antichristos!
Antichristos!
Antichristos!
