"Svar mig, Gud, i dodens slug!
galder ej et frelsens fnug
mandeviljens quantum satis?"*

"How long, wilt thou forget me, O LORD? For ever?
How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
How long shall I take consel in my soul,
Having sorrow in my heart daily?
How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
Consider and hear me, O LORD my God:

Lighten mine eyes,
Lest I sleep the sleep of death;

Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him;
And those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
But I have trusted in thy mercy;
My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
I will sing unto the LORD /of suffering/,
Because he hath dealt bountifully with me.

Lighten mine eyes,
Lest I sleep the sleep of death;"**
Darken the skies
Lest I have my final breath!

And so I fade away from this world,
liberated, suffering no more
blessed be thy holy name, O LORD
into thy hands I commend my soul...
