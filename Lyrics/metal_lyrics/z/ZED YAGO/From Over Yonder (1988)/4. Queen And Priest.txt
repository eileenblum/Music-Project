When the nights come on 
darkness breaks through 
say, baby, what you're gonna' do. 

Priest of the light 
moving away 
nothing at all can make him stay 
Queen of the dark 
is leaving her cage 
she's on the way to turn the page 
Sleeves all in black 
red lips, real hot 
she always gets what she wants. 

No release for queen and priest, 
no guilt no sacrifice

never ending black and white good old days and nights.

The hunter in space 
hunting the days 
no chance to win whatever way 
A sight of relief 
and with the morning rain 
the day will give you shelter once again 
Priest of the light 
is ready to start 
against the dark the same old fight 
Call it the sun 
lets call it the moon 
the same old game we forgot to soon.
