Zed Yago's bound 
to sail across the water 
because her father sold his soul 
and left that curse on her he 
left that curse on his daughter 
Accompanied 
by ghosts from the past 
they're crying out in agony 
all those forgotten hearts 
gliding along the ocean waves 
beg for release waiting for these days 

Zed Yago from the twilight zone 
bound to sail the sea 
she wants to move heaven 
and hell she wants to break free 

She took the sin 
of her fathers gruesome life 
helpless in the shroud of mist 
hear the breathless sigh
a dream and one aim in mind
to save the good, the bad and all mankind.
