You're not born to beg somebody 
you're not a great big lie. 
You know, you need somebody 
who is gonna' taking your high 
You know what you need 
do you know what you can get 
down and out in the street 
white sheets in a cold sweat. 

Shout it out, shout, stay the course, 
shout it out, shout, 
don't beg someone just to give 
shout it out, shout, 
them all down, it's a great relief 
if you don't beg somebody just to live. 

An eye for an eye 
and a tooth for a tooth 
only say good bye 
before you're bound to loose, 
and than when you have to hit the road. 

Shout
