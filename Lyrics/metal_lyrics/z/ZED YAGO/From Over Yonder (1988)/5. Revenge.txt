Behind the backyard down in the dust 
every night the same old fuss 
no cash for trash the painted wall 
bursts into flames out of control 
You're a creature, 
got to be stronger, than a wise man 
But your life wont last longer, 
than five years plus ten. 

No illusions emotions in chains 
underground dangerous games 
wake up in this circumstance 
avenging angel making advance. 

Even a worm will turn, 
and its crying out for revenge,

all the children will burn 
when you set them on a fire dance, 
a bitter life romance, surviving just for revenge. 

Ready to fight at the edge of a crime 
a fairy tale at first sight 
you're deeper in it than you think you might.
