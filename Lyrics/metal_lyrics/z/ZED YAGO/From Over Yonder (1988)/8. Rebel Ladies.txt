Her name was Ann Boney 
she made history 
she was the famous pirate 
ill famed for tragedy 

Rebel ladies breaking the rule, 
rebel babies take over entering you 

Another lady in that age 
who was called Mary Reed 
she wore man's dress 
and fought for what she needed. 

They decided to live, totally free, 
out of woman's traditional life 
they decided to be mutinous speeding up the fight. 

There was a little woman 
with a slit of an eye 
"evil" was the name 
blood thirsty the game.
