When the raven's colour's white
And a cross turns upside down
Dead end don't walk keep out
Anchor's turning the inside out

After all this ship of life
Couldn't find a resting-place
And a spell from over yonder
Took the wind out of the sails

Remember all those hungry years
The elder left behind
Just look at all those hungry years
They come to be in the next century

Underneath the surface is
A wound that never heals
And the salt of all oceans is
The essence of your tears

I wish there could be a future
Without a past
I wish there could be green roses
In Alice's Wonderland

Remember all those hungry years
The elders left behind
Just look at all those hungry years
They come to be in the next century

It's business the mighty claim
For selfish power
No culture say the old
Ignoring Rock and Roll
Ignoring Rock and Roll
