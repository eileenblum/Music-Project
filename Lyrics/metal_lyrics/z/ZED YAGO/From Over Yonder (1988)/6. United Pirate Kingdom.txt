Welcome to the edge of the world 
where the horizon meets the great water 
no doubt about the material world 
it hasn't manifested itself 
shadows form monstrous shapes 
over and over again 
never tired, never ending 
the outlines burst in to pieces of pain. 

Its the place where all forms of life 
dwell and await their return 
a timeless life between real and unreal is, 
where she endlessly burns
the magic rope a gift from the past 
won't let her free never 
she moves in the middle of this misty fog 
oh, that's forever. 

United pirate kingdom ruled by a pirate queen, 
that's where she keeps on dreaming 
building up her fantasy for ecstasy. 

Obsessed by revolution against the slimy cloud, 
wait for incarnation that's all she 
dreams about, the misty fog and the twilight zone 
you can't destroy throughout 
eternity, a creation without end 
a reckless rider on the sea 
at the edge of the world. 

Chased by the dream to be able to live 
inside a human body 
only one amazing miracle could achieve 
this innermost wish of the lady 
if two great opposites such as good and bad 
would go together and unite 
heaven and hell is only one thing 
this cannot be denied.
