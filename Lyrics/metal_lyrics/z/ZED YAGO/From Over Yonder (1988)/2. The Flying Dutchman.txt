There is a world not world, 
beyond the water 
where nothing is but what is not, 
where she live. 

Unreal creature 
but her father was a man 
wicked and cursed 
her mother was the water  
formless form. 

She has a ship and sails the sea 
year in year out the Flying Dutchman's daughter 
more than a ghost and less who will redeem her, 
and those hopeless souls that cry about her 
those twilight creatures in a tortured chaos. 

Pink fog turns purple, in the slime 
the daughter and the lords of chaos meet 
Oh, give me form, 
and I'll bring back sweet fantasy 
She cries, give me a human body, heaven 
give me a human body, hell. 

And it is done a female body goes ashore 
in search of fantasy, a mysterious, 
beautiful woman leaves the sea.
