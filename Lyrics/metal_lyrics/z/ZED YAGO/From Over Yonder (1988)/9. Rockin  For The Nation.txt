She has the night 
to get her thrills 
her sole delight 
she'll pop a pill 
he's the night 
a pagan right 
she'll blow a line 
don't need a rhyme 
She's a backseat lover 

Rocking for the nation, she's a backstage prop, 
Keep on rolling thunder and Lightning for the nation, 
keep on rocking thunder and lightning all over. 

Hungry for love 
she'll get her way 
hunting for more 
but she won't stay 
town after town 
where she belongs 
backstage prop 
she's having fun.
