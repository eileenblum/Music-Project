Is there anyone here 
for whom it's wholly clear 
which way he wants to stay 
come to light, come on: appear. 
All the searchers around 
look what they have found:hard life 
still blind they don't hear, the sound 

Rose of martyrdom a mighty storm against boredom 
no deadlock each step 
a thorn to the rose of martyrdom. 

At the end of the game 
you've been failing insane 
you feel it was not real 
tears have just one name. 

There's no cure, 
no cure for death don't wanna live to regret. 

It makes no sense after all 
nobody can catch the fall 
no rain will wash up the pain 
'till we get the call.
