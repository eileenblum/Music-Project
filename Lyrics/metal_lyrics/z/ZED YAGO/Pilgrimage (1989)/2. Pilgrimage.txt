Zed Yago is leaving the twilight zone 
the human body now it's her own 
A gift of god of the devil too 
this pact she has to satisfy soon 
it's still the rain that shakes the universe 

A pilgrimage is the go between disgust and dignity, 
A pilgrimage is the go between, rich and mad, 
proud and sad, free the spirit of its chain. 

United allies swear blood and pain 
one for all and all for one again 
They're out to find the lost fantasy 
remembering the human tragedy 
its still the rain that shakes the universe. 

Some hideous lies in a fairy tale 
demolish every paradise, 
only venties are not for sale 
and won't destroy your sacrifice.
