He was the man 
who stole the holy fire 
he was the bringer 
of all violence 
he is the one 
who's dictated all desire 
the worlds destiny 
was in his hands. 

Inventor, creator, destroyer 
the three estates of the world. 
All in one. Inventor, creator, 
destroyer the three estates of the world. 

He was the man 
who stole the holy fire 
he was the maker 
of the ugliest dream 
became a thief, 
a criminal, a liar 
a survivor of the good and of the mean 

The master of melancholy  
he wants to sing the song of military 
the feud is deeper 
than ever this battle won't be finished, no never.
