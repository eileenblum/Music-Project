From the very beginning 
from the very first start 
do you know all about Alpha 
it's the owner of the one and only part. 
And all deliverers came 
kept on singing a hymn 
they're on their way to research the echo 
of the one and only original sin. 

Don't stop the fire, call him the Wild, 
he was born in a mortal storm 
and called the Omega Child. 
People, you're the prodigal son, 

won't listen to the down below 
made of and in a formless form 
don't laugh too loud up there 
he is the Omega general heir.
