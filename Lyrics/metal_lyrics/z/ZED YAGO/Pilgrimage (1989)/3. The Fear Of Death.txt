Wake up in fear all you who don't know 
there's more behind the material glow 
you know it's the sinners who we adore 
and some of us die while they still do ignore 
It seams we are slaves of the fear of death 
foolishness directs us till morn 
don't want to be defeated, no 
but we are, but we are, 
from the second we are born. 

Don't you talk to the raven 
in a frightful night he's sure to appear, 
you might talk to the devil 
in a frightful night the fear of death, 
the fear of death is near. 

What we can't see is what we have to believe 
call the foreign dimension finally to earth 
more than we know appears in a dream 
disappears into space a taste of rebirth 
don't, don't want to be defeated no 
but we are, but we are, 
in the second we are born.
