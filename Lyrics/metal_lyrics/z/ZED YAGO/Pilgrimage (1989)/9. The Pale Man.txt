Deathly pale belongs to the sea 
tells you here's the beginning 
in the depth of misery 
you feel the spirit within. 
A torrent Over a storm tossed tree 
it's like a rugged stone 
rolling waves won't let you free 
because your time is gone. 

All the damned veiled in grey band together and demand
of the pale man who's crossing the way, 
can't never come back to land. 

He entrusts himself without taking care 
to wild seas every day 
and this old world, world of the sea 
endlessly he must bear 
His heart is like an ocean so deep 
knowing storm, ebb and flow 
and too many pearls, pearls of the beauty 
rest in it's depths below. 

He is one of the creatures of the sea, 
he's called the palest man he is one of 
the creatures who can't break free until eternity,
the pale man who's got Neptune's key.
