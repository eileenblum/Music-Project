Seven men on a dead man's coffin 
waiting 'till the rumour will be true 
seven souls are damned for ever 
eternally bound to sing the tune 

Black Bone Song, it's never ending a unique minor key,
Black Bone Song come along hell bound on the sea. 

Risk a view at the brink of death 
treasure hunters, they're never coming back 
seven voices scream and shout, 
found an escape through the hole in the ground. 
This old legend of seven sailor's lives 
drinking rum, singing black bone's rhymes 
seven pains cry out loud 
digging out the tale, out of the ground.
