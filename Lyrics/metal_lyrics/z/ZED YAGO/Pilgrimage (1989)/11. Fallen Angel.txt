Life was a bore 
hometown too small 
he's leaving this place 
won't make a call. 
Colder than ice 
is the feeling he's got 
give him some vice tonight 
let him walk tall. 

He's a fallen angel, fallen angel, 
fallen angel full of sins. 
He jumped too high and than he lost his wings. 

You lost your doll blew down the wall 
took all the boys only for toys. 
Colder than ice is the feeling you've got 
there's no surprise no thanks you've seen the lot 
until the river bursts his banks. 

Still life goes on like a cold flame 
maybe the debt of sin is life no gain 
colder than ice is the feeling you've got 
I've no advice you're on your own 
the only thing what you've got.
