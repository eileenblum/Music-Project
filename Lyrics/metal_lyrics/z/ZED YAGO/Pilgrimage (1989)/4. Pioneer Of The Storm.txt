Back at least 5000 years 
people are sailing 
first in really simple ships 
courageous and daring 

astronauts all in race 
astronauts of the space 
astronauts all in race 
explorers of the space. 

Chained, in fragile vessels banned 
these seamen faced 
totally obscure element 
wild waves, fierce gales 
try to harness each hour 
to use the wind for power 
try to harness 
the wind for power. 

It's an adventure into the unknown, 
Pioneer of the storm. 
Trust, only trusting the sun 
trusting the stars 
that's all, they had to lean on 
Moon Venus Mars 
each voyage a risk to get wrecked 
a journey called "never come back"
each voyage a risk to get wrecked 
a journey called Pioneer of the storm.
