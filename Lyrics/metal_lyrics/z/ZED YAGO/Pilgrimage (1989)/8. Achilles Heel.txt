When you were young some years ago 
your old man told you 
don't you set yourself on fire, listen 
the point of all is what you do not 
what you are talking about 
no matter what you've been going through. 
Don't give a damn, all those bridges you've crossed 
still trying to catch the rainbow. 
You'll spread your wings to rise up high, 
only need the wind to blow 
and after all you will know where to go. 

Fight, you got to be a fighter, 
don't show your Achilles heel 
life will turn out lighter, 
six feet water under your keel.
