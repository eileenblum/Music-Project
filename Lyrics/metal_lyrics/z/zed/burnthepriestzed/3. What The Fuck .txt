What the fuck are you moving towards
Nothing waits for you there

My friends fade
Too many times
Giving up to achieve normal life
My friends fade
Too many times
Falling into self-destructive minds
Differences grow
Too many disappointments
Losing their drive and excitement
Self-apathy
Creates monotony
Soon they lose their drive for living

Weren't your friends' support enough?
What do you feel you're moving towards?
And your friends aren't easily replaced
It takes time to make connections
And I can't go back
To how I once was
I've got too much drive and focus

And I can see
So much is shit
Which is why I have to keep fighting
I woke this morning and knew
Today is the only day I'll ever get
And today is right for living
I can't accept it any other way

Shit society holds nothing for me
I prefer my self-discovery
