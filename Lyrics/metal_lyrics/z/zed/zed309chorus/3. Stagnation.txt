[performed by ZED]No feeling
This place bringing nothing
Too familiar with my surroundings
Inhibiting, compromising my ability

Comfort breeding apathy
A struggle against all that you know
Trying to reach deeper
Just to find that nothing is there. 

Experience does not fall into the laps of those who sit still. If you havenï¿½t seen, if you donï¿½t move on, what have you to say?
