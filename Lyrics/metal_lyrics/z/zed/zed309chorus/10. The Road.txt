[performed by ZED]Driving, the road appears to be endless
Seems like you're going nowhere at all
But in time you reach your destination
The reward is that you got there at all

Once you are there you do what's important
What it's you drove all that way for
Search for like minds, dig through the bullshit
Do just what you drove all that way for

Feeling tired of this town
Feels as if I'm in a cage
Time to leave and explore
The stops made along the way
The people who offer hope
Friends made along the way
Connections that never fade
The reason that I stay

Eyes get so heavy
Staring down the road
I look next to me
My friend sleeping peacefully
Eyes get so heavy
Staring down the road
I live for this time!

Driving through the next town
Everything is still
It's an odd morning hour
I keep driving on
I look next to me
My friend sleeping peacefully

Coffee in my veins
My friend sleeping next to me
I feel if I blink again my friend will be disappearing
And I'll drive alone
But with no destination
Frantically asking 
Doesn't someone have somewhere to go?
