[performed by ZED]Down this street
Or anyone really
I'm hoping for invisibility
I'm sweating underneath their vision
Hiding, suffocating
Just so they won't see me

I hate these barriers
I want protection
From their realizations
That they should leave me
The fuck alone

If I could walk
As bare and free as they do
I wouldn't have boiling blood inside
Beads of sweat outside
But I don't want to hear it
So I'm trapped under
Hot iron drapes for protection

I'll probably walk this way forever
Hunched around my own self
When confidence arises
I'm put to shame
Fear and sadness

I can't stop their words
Or uninvited comments
They only worsen
As time elapses
They'll never get it
They'll never get it
They'll never get it
They'll never get it
They'll never get it
They'll never get it
They'll never get it
They'll never get it
They'll never get it
They'll never get it
They'll never get it
They'll never get it

They'll never get it
