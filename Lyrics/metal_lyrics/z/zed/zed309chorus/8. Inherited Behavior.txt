[performed by ZED]The values we are given
How we're told to interact
Are taught through old patterns
We're not supposed to react

It's the cause of too much suffering
Analyze what sets you back
So much is how we choose it
If we choose to act

Needs are created
That you don't need
Restrictions
Are just lies

Blind tradition
Sickening thoughts
Products of self apathy
Never questioning
What's being taught
Fear of changing reality

I see where it leads people when they don't control their lives
Life becomes a sterile routine where all they do is just survive

Needs are created
That you don't need
Restrictions
Are just lies

History rules
Instead of vision
Resentment is the thing that thrives
Acknowledge
That we're all affected
And crave a better life!
