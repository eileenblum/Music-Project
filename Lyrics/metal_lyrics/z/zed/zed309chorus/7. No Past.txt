[performed by ZED]I feel separated from
What I once knew
Was that really me?
I know it was not you
The decisions made
Were not made by me
What you became
Who could foresee?
Did I imagine you?
Who were you anyway?
To feel your hate
Locked so far away

You're the cause of your own suffering
Wearing disguises in place of what you could be
You're not worth my thoughts
You're not worth my feelings
But I still feel the effects; it's never ending

The past degrades into memory
And all that occurred is slowly fading
It seems foolish that I ever even tried
All that happened could be denied
Viewed as someone else's life
In a long forgotten time
Leave me with no past
More true than what exists

You're the cause of your own suffering
Wearing disguises in place of what you could be
You're not worth my thoughts
You're not worth my feelings
But I still feel the effects; it's never ending
