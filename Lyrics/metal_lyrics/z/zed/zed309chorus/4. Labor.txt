[performed by ZED]An hour of toil
A pocket of petty change
Wage slave
Selling time for pay
The day is done
I'm so fucking tired
A days worth of labor
A handful of money

Sometimes I feel like I can't break the surface
Sometimes it feels like my lungs are filled with water
At others it feels like I've just been through work
I've just been through work
I've just been through work

The day is done
So fucking tired
The day is done
