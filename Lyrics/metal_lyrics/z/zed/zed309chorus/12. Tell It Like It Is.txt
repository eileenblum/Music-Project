[performed by ZED]Look
Into the depths
Of your soul
What do you find there?
What?
What?!

Beat me up
I'll still say it
You won't bring me down
Your time is up
Your time is over
You will never make it
Mine will never drown!

How can you sleep at night?
LIES!
What goes around comes around

Truth, the only truth
Prove my reason!
Your conscience is dead
Your conscience is dead
Your conscience is dead
Put your toys away

TRUTH!
You can't hide it or decide it
Your conscience is dead
Put your toys away...
