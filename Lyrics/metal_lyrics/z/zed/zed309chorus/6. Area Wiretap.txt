[performed by ZED]It's an area wiretap
Careful what you say
Use a trigger word
The cops are on their way

Forget about justice
We're talking society
Whether you're 10 or 21
They'll lock you up the same

High crime areas will be like prisons soon
House arrest - prisons have no room

Parking tickets and piss tests
All their rules the same.
On your back through paper work
Waiting for your mistake TO LOCK YOU AWAY!

The constitution has been suspended
Was it ever good anyway?
Seeking the security of the Police State!
