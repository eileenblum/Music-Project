[performed by ZED]To some it means money
To some property
To some it's a home
Where they eat, love and sleep
They'll foreclose
They'll abandon
They'll arrest squatters
Cuz they want it empty
They own it for profit
People are renters
Landlords living
Off the lives of others
The cycle repeats
In the capitalist machine
Until each aspect of life
Is reduced to commodity

Profiting on a common need
Lying with a straight face
Inherited money
Exploiting the city's poor

Selfish bastards never learn!
Keep pocketing the money
LAND lord
LORD of the LAND!

Some day they'll be forced to learn
