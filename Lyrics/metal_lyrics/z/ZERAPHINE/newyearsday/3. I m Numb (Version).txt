Whatever I am feeling, I find you everywhere
You're like the clouds that pass me by again
My memories are empty, they'll never bring you back
I can't deny how much I'm missing you

Time pours down,
Washing my faith away

I'm numb until we're dancing into the night,
But I still feel your kisses riding over my skin
I'm numb until you're disappearing again
Too many scars and a dream will never end

I've been to all the places where you used to be
But everywhere a chill kept seizing me
And if I sleep, I'm restless and I'm not gone for long
I can't deny how much I'm missing you
