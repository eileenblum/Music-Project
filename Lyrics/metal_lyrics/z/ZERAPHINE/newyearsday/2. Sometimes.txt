A strange deserted way
You are running all alone with leaves still in your hair
With fevered eyes unsure,
You seem to smile, but do you really cry behind your fears

And when the need calls
You spread out your arms

Sometimes you fade out and leave it all behind
Sometimes you just kiss a bleeding world good-bye
Sometimes you fade out and forget the truths and lies
Sometimes you just try to build a wall within your mind
You say you've always tried
To look as far as you could see, but each time you disagree
The mirror only shows
The truth that comes too close to what you see and what we'd like to know

Too fast, you're distant
You spread out your arms
