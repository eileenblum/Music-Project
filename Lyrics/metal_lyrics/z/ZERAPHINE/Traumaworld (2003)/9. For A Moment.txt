Dimensions are shifting
Burning holes in my direction
The habit of lightness disintegrates
Reconciliation fails, 
I'm passing by within a whisper
Everything appears a false delight
But in vain, I turn away

For a moment we paused without a reason
Could there be another way?
In free fall, but rising to the ceiling
Now there's nothing left to feel

Obsession is hypnotising
It's so hard to look away
It's still unclear, if you are genuine
The door is locked and bolted 
Somehow, you keep on reminding
As tensions ease, I'm finding no
relief
