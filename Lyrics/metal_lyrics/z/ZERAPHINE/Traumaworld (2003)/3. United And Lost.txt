We're walking along the infinite path
While we are shaking from the fear inside
It's rising gently and thin
But we sense nothing, we don't feel a thing

If I know what you would say next
What I could tell you - you know too
So we stopped talking,
Now we're holding back silent screams

And if we fall consistently
You are always a part of me
And as we crawl into uncertainty
We were always united and lost

The words that tried to bring us back
Are still rebounding, you just look away
Positions are shifting from day to day

We are still walking along that infinite path
But we go forward, not side by side 
And we're not listening to the silent screams
anymore
