When you fell into my arms
Appearing so frail, if you ever were
And you told me a thousand things
I've never dreamt about
When your eyes fell grey
Could it be I made them shine for awhile?
Now you're gone, as if you ever meant to stay

Be my rain
Be my rain 
To wash the pain and the truth away
Be my rain
Be my rain 
Embrace my world, everlasting

We were talking through the night
No one could say a word
Of what had passed or should be said
As if time stood silent,
The dawn never came
And the skies are empty
Since we stopped

Far away,
We cannot share the love within us 
You're far away,
And rising up to start
again
