I never thought this day would come
I did not know all hope was gone
Shattered in a lost eternity
I never wished to drift away
How could I feel at home again
With all the things you said, upon my mind

There is so much left to say to you
Unspoken words won't change the truth
I doubt that words change anything at all
What if we could turn time back again
Would we do it all the same?
And until now the bitter chill remains

The failing breath is familiarity
I think I see your smile vanish afar
The failing breath is my fragility
The pieces left behind is all we are

Your heartbeat is too far away
There's no place where I can stay
Picture of a dream I can't deny
All at once I hear your voice
Another scene and still you cry
I would have given all to share your pain

But now you run and you will hide again
The lonely days may never end
I'll try to find the courage from day to day
Your fears are always close to me
In time I'll catch my failing breathe,
But the air around me will belong to
you
