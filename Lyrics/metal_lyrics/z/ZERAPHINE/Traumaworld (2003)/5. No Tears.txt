At a second glance 
You thought you recognised despair
For a fraction of a second 
You were searching for a reason
You pretended cheerfully, 
But instead you tried to hide away
When everybody's laughter 
Seems to rip you all apart

And your life carries on the same
And your life will be the same

Going back again to see 
Stages from the recent past
But everywhere you turn
There is no chance to continue
Nothing really holds you back 
&gt;From stepping through that yesterday
For every new beginning
There will be some other end

And when you cry there are no tears left for liberation
You don't listen to your own explanations
There are no rules you left behind from your desperation
There's no need to fear the way, that you've led

You'll run again, 
Faster than you've ever been
You don't feel the cold, 
It's never been like this before
Determination in your eyes, 
Now you don't know the reasons why
You can't say goodbye
But you never really said hello
