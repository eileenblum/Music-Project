I thought it was a usual morning
Just like every day before
I looked into the sky
But something there was strange
Nobody in the streets
The day was bright, 
There was no sun at all
Black ashes in the air
Riding on the wind

With rubble on the ground 
I caught the scent of burning
With no flames glowing anywhere
I felt the cold instead
And it seems that my worst nightmare
Suddenly became reality
But this has gone beyond,
Far beyond imagination

I'm living next to the edge
Under radiating skies
Living close to the end
Of wonderland

Maybe you simply wanted too much
Might be you simply went too far
The excuses will not change
What no one's there to hear
You're probably insatiable
You never cared for anything
What doesn't belong to you,
Is beneath your dignity

Your speeches are a flood of lies
You never even realised 
The contradictions, 
Are they all the same to you?
You're doing fine,
You think you'd like to be 
The master of every thought
So you're playing like a God,
But who created
you?
