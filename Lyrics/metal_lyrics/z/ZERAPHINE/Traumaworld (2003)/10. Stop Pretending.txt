An unbelievable distance
That you can't overcome
You thought you could bear to the end
Everything that was precious
You had lost at once
You thought you could keep it all your days

The day has come to stop pretending
So tempting that you can't resist
The fantasies are never ending
You're escaping for a little bliss

Lost the ambition,
To straighten out your life again
All that you want is to sleep
You've never been superstitious,
But you can't go through this again
Trying to find deliverance

You fall
And another intention opens-up
You fall
And your heart has let go its secrets
You fall
For the first time your feet touch the ground again
You fall, you
fall
