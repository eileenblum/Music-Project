The sunlight reflects in your eyes
Your tears ceased to flow
You're back in balance
The fallacies leave you alone
And your nightmares are replaced by reality

You're floating away
Right up and over the barriers and borders
Boundless and free is your mind
It took ages for you to feel this way again

Light your stars
You could stand the fascination
And you're falling weightlessly
To close your diary
Light your stars
You could understand relations
And you're falling weightlessly
Until the diary is done

You're leaving the fear far behind
And you're trying to battle with great temptation
Like maggots, it's eating at you
Do you pray at night, you're strong enough to resist?

You're tossing in bed
And all you perceive is a blurred world in strange lies
Tearing the visions all down
Defeated your so lost in tranquillity
