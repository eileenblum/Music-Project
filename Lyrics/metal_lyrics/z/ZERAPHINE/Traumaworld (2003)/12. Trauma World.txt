The unavoidable desire to take you home
Like suffocating all my clearest thoughts
It seems like yesterday when we lay here side by side
But it's countless nights ago that it passed away

In a trauma world
Discovering all the depths in which we stand
In a trauma world
Fighting our achievements every day
In a trauma world
The truth is so surreal and incomplete
In a trauma world
Sifting through the memories in our heads

When I held a fragile hand that sorry day
Not feeling cold inside, uncompromising
As if romancing all night long in our imaginations,
Then one second changed our lives eternally

Understand me if I take you into my arms
Please forgive me if I am searching for your heart
Do you hear me when I'm crying every night?
I must start
again
