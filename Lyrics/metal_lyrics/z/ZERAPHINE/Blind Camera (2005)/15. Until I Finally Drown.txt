Some other time I wish to get away
Some other time will come another day
My thoughts are swimming round it's futility
With all the dreams that never ever come true?
How could I believe they come true?
How long should I wait without you?

Still feeling close behind my face
The ebbing moments since our last embrace
I can't recall all the days they simply drift on by
But all the dreams that never ever come true?
How could I believe they come true?
How long should I wait without you?

Your shape is foil as if I am passing right
Through your arms I reach them again
Will I only catch a reflection of you?
Until I finally drown in you

Your shape is foil as if I am passing right
Through your arms I reach them again
Will I only catch a reflection of you?
Until I finally drown in you

Until I finally drown in you
Until I finally drown in you
