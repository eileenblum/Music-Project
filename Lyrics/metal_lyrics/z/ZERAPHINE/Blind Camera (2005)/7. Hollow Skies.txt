Once again you sought the light
But all you got was empty
In other ways you searched for your dreams - in reality

When thoughts are spinning high above
And memories were tokens
You knew there's nothing left but faith - could it be ?

Hollow skies - where angels are defenceless and pass away
Hollow skies - where worlds subside and intentions pave your way

You were strong
But now you're failing, there's not a chance
And while you're stretching out your hands
It's all past

As I look into the skies
You can't see me, I'll wait for you
And lead you out to end the fears
For one last time
