On a river so grey
That's running much too fast
I'm a hostage on my own
The air I breathe is stale
And I'm planning my escape
Without a destination

While I'm embraced by the waters cold
I know you're far away
Within my fantasy it's new
I'm asking for hope in (you)

(You) name my fate
I'm lost on the waves without (you)
(You) never break
I'm lost in the river of you

So my runs very slow just like a flood of tears
When they've all dried up
That river flows one more and I try to catch a ray of light
From the sky at night
Will I ever rest my eyes upon your face
And you fade again
I will never really know if you lost me too
I'm asking for hope in (you)

All of my thoughts, all of the words get tangled
The waves ride high again
Your lips seem close to mine
I'm losing hold in the river of (you)
