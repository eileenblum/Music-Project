An endless path lies up ahead as I try to walk
Upon a ridge where I might fall at any time
Where is your hand to keep me safe to reduce the emptiness
I wonder why it lures me in

I feel your trace but I can't turn your distance round again
How did you ever get so far away

With every step you hide your scent so where should I seek?
I know you left your heart behind too far to speak
Now there's no rest as it calls me and I see a sign of life
The burning trail reflects in your eyes
