The hints are far too obvious
Do you see nothing beyond yourself
You're so predictable to me
I don't buy clichÃ©s you have learnt

You deny each failure
Everything you do is right
You tune out when someone speaks to you
And I never want to be like you
Your answers are too long
And I never want to die like you
Just ask me and I tell you why

Because you've lost profundity
Because your views are dead and blank
'Cos you're a contradiction of what you'd like to be

Because you're infallible
Is that what you think you are?
You suppress the fact that you hide in lies

And I never want to be like you
Your answers are too long
And I never want to die like you
Just ask me and I tell you why

I never want to be like you
Your answers were all wrong
So I never want to die like you
Just ask me and I tell you why
