Some other time I'd wish to get away
Some other time will come another day
My thoughts are swimming 'round, it's futility
With all the dreams that never ever come true â¦

How could I believe they come true
How long should I wait without you

Still feel you close behind my face
The ebbing moments since our last embraceâ¦
I can't recall all the days, they simply drift on by
With all the dreams that never ever came true â¦

How could I believe they come true
How long should I wait without you

Your shape is void
As if I'm passing right through your arms
I reach out again
Will I only catch a reflection of you
Until I finally drown in you

Thanks to "BER" darth_raziel for sending this lyrics.
