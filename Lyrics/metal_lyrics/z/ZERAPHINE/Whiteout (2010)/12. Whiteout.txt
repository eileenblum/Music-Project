Set the wrong pace
In the wrong place
To wave a last goodbye
Skipped the wrong page
In my torn rage
I don't care for the reason why

You're the torrential river
Taking me far away
From their blindness in this lightness
You were the golden river
Taking me far away from here

And tonight I'll die again
But the demons will remain
And we thought we could agree
But there's nothing left we could believe in
And the words inside of me
I've lost my hope you could perceive them
So I flushed my memory
To forget all we have dreamt of

You were the swirling river
Taking me far away from here
You're the torrential river
Taking me far away from this meanness and all neatness
You were the golden river
Taking the pain away from me

Followed wrong ways
On the wrong trace
But I never could return

But my mind will stay the same
Even though I passed the aim
I still hear your final words
I can't sense how hard it hurts
You'll always be a part in me
They can really never steal from me
But I had to bury you
After all our dreams came true

You were the bleeding river
Drowning me deep inside of you
You were the bleeding river
All my angels cry for you

... For you
