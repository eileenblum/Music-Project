With the blade in my heart I'm stumbling
I'm melting into the ground
While the walls around are crumbling
I don't want to rest âtil I'm found
Fighting against emptiness and confidence inside of me
And a broken mirror shows me what I am supposed to see

And I thought I'm crying tears, but blood is pouring down from my eyes
But no matter how I feel I can't respond to their lies
I don't need these souvenirs to remind me of the bygone time
And however much I try to forget
I can't get rid of their grime
(I hold my breath)
I can't get rid of their grime
(I hold my breath)

And the weights on my feet drag me
Down to the bottom of the sea
But it looks so peaceful here and I can't speak to raise a plea
Everything I tried to see and to find again and to undo my faults
Was never worth the strain, there's nothing left I could exault

And I thought about dying safely, but as always there's no guarantee
Whatever they say I still deny and disagree
The words and sentiments
And I'm still standing in-between
But my innermost thoughts remain unseen

So I question a new prospect and I'll leave it all this time
With all doubts and dissent in my head
I'm waiting - waiting for the day to end
So I question a new prospect and I'll leave it all this time
With all doubts and dissent in my head
I'm waiting - waiting for the day to end

And the storm was silent thunder
Poison runs through my veins
Don't need another aching wonder
I'm already almost slain
Dismissing the consequences and one-way chances, âcause it's not good
Some call it fate, some always say they feel misunderstood

And I know I cry no tears, âcause blood is pouring down from my eyes
But you'll never guess my thoughts, you can't see through my disguise
I don't need more injuries to remind me of a former life
You cannot stop me anymore, however much you strive

So I question a new prospect and I'll leave it all this time
With all doubts and dissent in my head
I'm waiting - waiting for the day to end
So I question a new prospect and I'll leave it all this time
With all doubts and dissent in my head
I'm waiting - waiting for the day to end
