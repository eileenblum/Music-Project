How can I breathe beneath the ice surrounding my whole self
If my tears would only flow, just for a second
If I could break the walls apart which are built inside my heart

But the morning never comes
To welcome the light that stops me feeling cold and numb
To follow your hands that could lead me out, to start again
But the distance just increased whenever I tried to get away from this ...

Stream
I'm dispossessed of all beliefs
And I feel I'm dragged away again by this
Stream
I'm convalesced without relief
And I see the world in black again

I still can see the blurry stars, but they can't really light the sky
I still hear voices from after like an endless whisper
If I could only trust my eyes
I ran out of goodbyes

But the morning never comes
To welcome the light that stops me feeling cold and numb
To follow your hands that could lead me out, to start again
But the distance just increased whenever I tried to get away from this ...

Stream
I'm dispossessed of all beliefs
And I feel I'm dragged away again by this
Stream
I'm convalesced without relief
And I see the world in black again

I tried to get away from this ...

Stream
I'm dispossessed of all beliefs
And I feel I'm dragged away again by this
Stream
I'm convalesced without relief
And I see the world in black again
