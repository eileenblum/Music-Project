I feel your breath
It commands the eyes beneath my skin
Your smile is left
And the pictures in my mind that drives me mad
The only wish
But still reminds is to be with you
At your side
While tears run dry
And thoughts are clear again

I will be there
If you should fall
You fall into my arms
I will be there
To catch your fall
Just take my hand again

I will be there
If you should fall
You fall into my arms
I will be there
To catch your fall

In your eyes
I can see reflections of my life
No need to hide
My memories are standing still for you
If there was fear
We could smile it
Just in the beginning
But I'm still here
And you're so templing far away from me

I will be there
If you should fall
You fall into my arms
I will be there
To catch your fall
Just take my hand again

I will be there
If you should fall
You fall into my arms
I will be there
To catch your fall

I will be there
If you should fall
You fall into my arms
I will be there
To catch your fall
Just take my hand again

I will be there
If you should fall
You fall into my arms
I will be there
To catch your fall
