Thoughts again unwind
But now you feel so incoherent
And stains are hard to find
You can't stand the lack of fear
And if you consciousness is clear
Don't you miss a bit of violence
What you see is insincere
It always stays the same

And on and on a crying dawn
But tears have ceased and words are gone
And your screams have just become a silent whisper

Flood the world they've built around you to drown the bygone times
Live the lies they tell about you âcause doubts have been declined
Let me take you far above this, to see beyond their games
For the past is out of sight

You live your own decay
Aren't you tired of mindless hiding?
The conventions you obey
Make you feel you're almost dying
When the answers don't belong
To all the questions you were trying
To ask a million times before
And the faults go on

And on and on a crying dawn
But tears have ceased and words are gone
And your screams have just become a silent whisper

Flood the world they've built around you to drown the bygone times
Live the lies they tell about you âcause doubts have been declined
Let me take you far above this, to see beyond their games
For the past is out of sight

Flood the world they've built around you to drown the bygone times
Live the lies they tell about you âcause doubts have been declined
Let me take you far above this, to see beyond their games
For the past is out of sight
