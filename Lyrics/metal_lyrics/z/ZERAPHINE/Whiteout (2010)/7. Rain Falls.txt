Through the clouds around your aching body
The usual noises are slowly fading in and so
you tried so hard to disembody
But everything's still in its place, just like before

And even if you try to blank out the scenes
They will recur again and again
And no one can perceive the scars
But your soul is marked, it can never heal
But when ...

Rain falls into your eyes
It dilutes all your tears down
Rain falls like it's lye
Washing your blood away
When rain falls into your eyes
It can blur all distinction
Rain falls in reply

Your reflection shows a hint of anger
But you still feel the numbness deep inside
With the blade right in your hand you're pausing
Awaiting the rising excitement to come out

With the first cut your warm blood is dripping
Down to the floor, but you feel so alive now
And the craving for this substitution of pain always prevails
And when ...

Rain falls into your eyes
It dilutes all your tears down
Rain falls like it's lye
Washing your blood away
When rain falls into your eyes
It can blur all distinction
Rain falls in reply

Rain falls into your eyes
It dilutes all your tears down
Rain falls like it's lye
Washing your blood away
When rain falls into your eyes
It can blur all distinction
Rain falls in reply
