Just as if nails have pierced my hands to the floor
I'm unable to move
I stare at the ceiling, but it's blank
Are my pictures completely removed?
But your aura is still around
And I drown in the scent of your skin
When I close my eyes again
There's just this blackness around your face

Pathetic creeds without reliance
I can't fullfill the remaining desires
Inherit the ill of a dead alliance
I can't fullfill the remaining desires

In your tears I've lost my way
So I prowl in the depth of your mind
Should I leave you or should I stay?
But it's really too late to rewind
When the borders are so tight
That you choke on their poisonous breath
And I can't bear to let you go
By now I'm inconceivably missing you

Pathetic creeds without reliance
I can't fullfill the remaining desires
Inherit the ill of a dead alliance
I can't fullfill the remaining desires

I can't fullfill the remaining desires
