I'm counting the hours in sleepless nights
My thoughts get lost, I see your eyes
And I'm still waiting to see you again
The steps we take are equalized
We don't need the old disguise
And I'm still waiting to feel you again

We don't care about the rest of the world
We just believe what we believe in
Living seems so easy when we melt in our embrace

Oh Louisa, you're in my wonderland
Reach out and touch my hand again to fill the emptiness in me
Oh Louisa, you're my last memory
I can't remember how it felt before we met
Oh Louisa

The hours pass, the miles go by
The early clouds, a grayish sky
And I'm still waiting to hear you again
You're in my mind but too far away
The echo fades, it can't light the way
I'm still waiting to feel you again

We don't care about the world around
We only trust what we can trust in
Living seems so easy when we melt in our embrace

Oh Louisa, you're in my wonderland
Reach out and touch my hand again to fill the emptiness in me
Oh Louisa, you're my last memory
I can't remember how it felt before we met

Oh Louisa, you're in my wonderland
Reach out and touch my hand again to fill the emptiness in me
Oh Louisa, you're my last memory
I can't remember how it felt before we met

Oh Louisa
