[bonus track]

For this silent storm
I've been waiting so long
To carry me away from this place
Uprooting every scene you're part of
I hope no single shoot remains

I can see the world from far above
But all my questions are still not heard

Out of the void, dazzled by you
Is what I always wanted to be
But you're out of my reach, all that I ever loved
Why did they take you away from me

We went through hell and jumped up to heaven
No matter what we were told to be
I can't get rid of this last picture
That burnt into my heart like a seal

Your innocent eyes and all the tries...
I held your hand before you died

Out of the void, dazzled by you
Is what I always wanted to be
But you're out of my reach, all that I ever loved
Why did they take you away from me
