The letters were broken as I tried to read your words
From the lips in your eyes, from the desert in my mind
And I'm craving for your touch and for an unexpected sign
Can you feel my frozen tears, can you see more than I've ever seen

How should I start, how should it end
When I'm chained to toxic skies
What does it matter if I go
The end of the world is passing us by

Life is a contradiction Â· it's just a long term fall

I'm lying in silence since I collapsed on the sterile floor
Visions are clearing, I couldn't stand them anymore
And your eyes are open, but you're staring at the door
And I wave my last good-bye to you, the lights are fading away again
