Have you tried to climb the wall inside yourself
What did you see there at the top Â· if your eyes were shut
A boundless chazm made of darkness, pain and fear
Are you afraid to raise your hands?
Follow me

Can I ever melt the distance in your eyes
That keeps me far away from you
What means 'safe' and what is 'real' in your disguise
If you take the gory way to truth
I'll follow you

I'm getting closer, don't try to hide again
There's no shelter we're all alone Â· so open your eyes
Spread your arms and jump with me into the void
Into the sad reversal of you
Follow me
