It feels like I'm dying, and I've never been apart from you
It feels like erasing my thoughts and the faults and all of you
But patterns repeat and multiply all the time
And these nails pierce my will so just your pain can remain

Since we're falling Â· all roses turn black
Since we're falling Â· we never look back
Good-bye morning Â· the damned and accursed
Good-bye mourning Â· it's part of the worst

A face looks courageous, but what lies behind its layered glass
When fear is infectious, when torment reveals what's behind a mask
But memories repeat and multiply all the time
And your nails pierce my soul so just this pain can remain

Faint and frail Â· controlled insurrection Â· wake my day Â· I'll deny all protection
