When I think about you
I remember all the times we ran away
And we never cared about the things we left behind

And no one ever could believe Â· that we're finally leaving

The state of the moment is lost
While the seconds pass
We'll not stay for this moment, it's lost
I've torn out my heart

The sun is black
A reflection in your eyes
All the wasted tears unite in oceans
But we're drowning in the air

And no one ever could believe Â· that we're finally leaving
