Up from the dungeons of hell
Came the mightiest devil of all
Dealing out danger or buying your soul
They put him to death by the sword
With hellfire eyes he went wild as he spoke
Disciples must answer his call
This demon lead armies to conquer the world
Destroy all mankind with war

He can't last much longer
There ain't no place for him to hide
And only we can stop him

Kill the enemy
Shoot him down
Kill the enemy

People would follow whatever he'd say
Hypnotized masses would fall
Into your town stormtroopers came
Laying waste, raping some, killing all
Try to resist and you'll die a slow death
You'd suffer, you'd beg and you'd crawl
Perversion and mayhem, havoc and pain
Satan has come to us all

He can't last much longer
There ain't no place for him to hide
And only we can stop him

Kill the enemy
Shoot him down
Kill the enemy

This demon spoke long of superior race
The Aryan empire strong
He killed by the millions, he took life so cheap
Now his spectres are still standing tall

He can't last much longer
There ain't no place for him to hide
And only we can stop him

Kill the enemy
Shoot him dead
Kill the enemy
