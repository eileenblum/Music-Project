A flash of lightning shocks you to the bone
The roar of thunder you hear someone moan
A blinding flash of light and you feel
That touch against your skin, you know it's steel
They'll try to find you, they won't let you die
They'll seek you out, you know they'll try
A sharp explosion rings through your ears
Your time is coming, your fate is near

He didn't know
That he'd die
But it's the price you pay
When you're a mercenary

You take a look around and all you can see
Smoke and confusion staring back at me
You wake at daybreak, you're still alive
You fight to stay awake, your will to survive
Back in the jungle, the children cry
Burning napalm, it's time to die
You fought in deserts, you fought in gangs
You're the assassin and you're deranged

He didn't know
That he'd die
But it's the price you pay
When you're a mercenary

You've been a mercenary nearly all of your life
No time for family, can't keep your wife
The pain you're in is too much to hold
You'll die soon anyway, fighting alone
So now it's over, silence closes in
That's what you get when you just can't win

He didn't know
That he'd die
But it's the price you pay
When you're a mercenary
Mercenary
Mercenary
