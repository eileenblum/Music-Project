The damage is done, I've been beat at my own crime
By someone that I never would have expected
While the rich man kept counting his stocks and shares
I made with the cash that they didn't know was there

Trip wires
I thought I would do no wrong
Never assume that you'll beat them all
Trip wires
I thought I would do no wrong
Never assume that you've won

So now that you found me, well how do you feel?
And what is it that you expected to gain
By laying your ass on the line for the rich man
Who couldn't care less if they found you dead?

Trip wires
I thought I would do no wrong
Never assume that you'll beat them all
Trip wires
I thought I would do no wrong
Never assume that you've won

I never thought you'd become the impostor
'Cause you still won't collect a substantial reward
'Cause a pauper can never join ranks with the rich man
'Cause he's rich with the lies that he's fed to the poor

Trip wires
I thought I would do no wrong
Never assume that you'll beat them all
Trip wires
I thought I would do no wrong
Never assume that you've won
