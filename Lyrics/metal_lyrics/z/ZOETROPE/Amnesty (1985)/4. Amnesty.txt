Amnesty

We want amnesty
From what you believe
To be above and beyond the law
But it ain't no thing
But just a prime example
Of the way things are run
Run in the wrong direction
No good for anyone, no

Protesting trivial matters
Is a waste of time
But when you're sending reckless youth
To the front line
Can only spur resistance
From both young and old
Because of special interest
That you keep to yourself, you

Increasing casualties
Becomes the result
Of patriotic bullshit
And it's all your fault
So we will flee the land
Until you decide
That you'll exonerate
Us from this imaginary crime

Amnesty
