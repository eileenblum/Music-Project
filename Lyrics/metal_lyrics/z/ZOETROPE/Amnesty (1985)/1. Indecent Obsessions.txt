In through your window a pair of big eyes watching you and your bitch make love
The thoughts that he thinks while watching the innocent lovers can scare you to death
His fantasies can't be controlled, he's a voyeur, he's been that way all of his life
He tries to live out what he sees in his mind even though he could end up in jail

Indecent obsessions
Unbridled aggressions

Chased by a man with a knife in his hand while being seen dressed in drag
Because he followed that man and his wife to their doorstep and watched them enter the house
Around to the side by the window hoping he'll get his means of release
But then he was spotted so all he could think of was "run for his life"
