No one knew what the night would bring when the sky was overcast
A haunting wind and a lightning bolt in a barren graveyard
When the bodies rise up from the underground your skin begins to crawl
And a long cold hand lashes out at you and then you're gone

He tried with all his might
But he couldn't win the fight
Spellbound by evil
It's life in hell
Spellbound by evil
In a traumatic brainstorm

The mausoleum is a reception room for the ghouls in the night
You best seek refuge if you're still alive or you'll be discovered
Well behind a mansion is a dead man's tracks leading up the stairs
And in the foyer lying on the floor is half a human being

He tried with all his might
But he couldn't win the fight
Spellbound by evil
It's life in hell
Spellbound by evil
In a traumatic brainstorm

The world is plagued by an evil force that brings the dead man back to life
I wish there was some way to save us all from tragic endings
Well escape ain't likely when you're trapped inside and there's nowhere to run
So count your blessings, prepare to die, your time has come

So try with all your might
And you might win the fight
Spellbound by evil
It's life in hell
Spellbound by evil
In a traumatic brainstorm
