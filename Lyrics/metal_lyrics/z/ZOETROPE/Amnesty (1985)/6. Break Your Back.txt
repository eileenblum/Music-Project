You break your back
To get you through
Ain't got no class
They say to you
You need money
To survive
So you break your back
Just to stay alive

All day long
You work and slave
You got nothing left
Your choice is made
There ain't no reason
I should wait
Just let me through
Those pearly gates

Don't you try
And tell me why
I should be glad
To be alive
Now you see
The road I'll take
Life is hell
To all who wait

Break it
Break it

Hey!

Break your back!
