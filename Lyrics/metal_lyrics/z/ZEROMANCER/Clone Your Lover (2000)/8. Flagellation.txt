Decoding every word you say
When you hurt yourself
There has to be a better way
for you to hate yourself

cause you don't understand
what I'm trying to say to you
You don't understand

Flagellation Flagellation
Take the pain of a modern nation
Flagellation Flagellation
Take the pain, take the violation

It's gonna be allright

I punish you for every kiss
Look what you stole from me
Blessing you for all your sins
Hey you, you can never win

if you don't understand
what I'm trying to say to you
You don't understand
anything at all

Flagellation Flagellation
Take the pain of a modern nation
Flagellation Flagellation
Take the pain, take the violation

It's gonna be allright

Right here
only pain's gonna set you free
right now
you mean nothing to me

Flagellation Flagellation
Take the pain of a modern nation
Flagellation Flagellation
Take the pain, take the violation
Flagellation Flagellation

Everything's gonna be OK
Everything's gonna be allright
