Something for the pain
inside me
that will never die
The pain inside me
that will never die 

My heart bleeds
look at you
hiding
all the things
to endure me

I need you
here with me
breathing
wanting you
to believe me

Something for the pain
inside me
that will never die
The pain inside me
that will never die 

I see you
in all of these faces
blush with shame
when I think of you

and your pale skin
I sell my soul for you

Hush Hush
never enough
never enough

The pain inside me
that will never die
Something for the pain
inside me
that will never die
