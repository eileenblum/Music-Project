How can you stand there and deny it
after all we have been through
How can you stand there and deny it
and make a fool out of you

Collapsing like houses of cards
and landing on splinters and glass

Wish I could fake it like you do
wish i could fake it just like you

How can you stand there and deny it
How can you stand there and deny it 
Trust me now

Collapsing like houses of cards
and landing on splinters and glass
They crush your heart
but spare your feet
like judging people
you've yet to meet
well time is running fast
upon your reflection

trust me now

How can you stand there
Stand and deny it
