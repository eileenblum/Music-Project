Act sleazy
behave like a tart
it's so easy
to get what you want

yeah
you can't get enough

Hey baby
we all know your name
it's sex
that will lead you to fame

Don't Don't Don't Give it up
Don't Don't Die of a broken heart

Your ego
is never at fault
if you believe it
you'll get all you want

yeah
you can't get enough

Don't Don't Die of a broken heart

I feel your pulse
beating blue
and I feel your skin crawls
when we, we ,we, we
fuck

Don't Don't Die of a broken heart
