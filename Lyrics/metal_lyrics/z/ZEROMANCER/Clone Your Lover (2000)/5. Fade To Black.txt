You live your life day by day
You can't feel it's slipping away
It's like heaven where you never get bored
You self inflicted Rock'n roll whore

Can you feel it
Can you feel the clocks ticking away

The world doesn't change in a day
The world doesn't change it
The world doesn't change in a day 

It makes me sick
to see
what you need
to breathe
It makes me sick
to see
what you need
the world doesn't change in a day

You've got a thousand wounds to heal
You gotta stop thinking nothing's for real
electric shock won't bring you back
You're fading baby
You fade to black
The world doesn't change in a day
The world doesn't change it
The world doesn't change in a day 

It makes me sick
to see
what you need
to breathe
It makes me sick
to see
what you need
the world doesn't change in a day 

It makes me sick
to see
what you need
to breathe
It makes me sick
to see
what you mean
to me

When you are the one inside
is it what you thought it'd be
I always knew you'd be a star
and now you are
