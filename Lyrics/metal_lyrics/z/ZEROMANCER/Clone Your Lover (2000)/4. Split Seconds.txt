Open your eyes
Take a look around you
You light me up
Like I`m some kind of saint
If black and white
were the only colours
if you and I
were the only ones

Trying to buy some time
I'd try to fight split seconds
Trying to buy some time
I'd try to fight split seconds

I open my eyes
and fear it 's not the last time
You set me up
like I'm some kind of fool

Trying to buy some time
I try to Fight split seconds
Trying to buy some time
I try to Fight....

the scars to prove that
we're not the only ones
the scars to prove that
I am
that I am

Trying to buy some time
I try to fight split seconds
Trying to buy some time
I try to fight split seconds
Trying to buy some time
I try to fight split seconds
Trying to buy
Trying to buy
