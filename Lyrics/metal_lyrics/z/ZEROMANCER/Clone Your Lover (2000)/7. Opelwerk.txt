Staring at the white walls
it feels good
when the sun don't shine
Two of a kind
but there are times
you're not listening to me

Nail you to the floor
your hands are going numb
put out the candles
plastered to your skin

It's only for tonight
when everyone's asleep
frustration comes to me
like talking to a machine
it's only in your dreams

Bring me down
Bring me down

My eyes adjust to the light
My eyes adjust to the night

Tonight
when everyone's asleep
frustration cuts to deep
like talking to a machine
it's only in your dreams

Tonight, if only it's allright
It's only for tonight
