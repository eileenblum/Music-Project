It's on your mind
But you can't say it
It's in your eyes
But you can't see it
It's on your wrist
But you can't time it
It's off the top of year head
But you can't wear it

It's in your face
It's in your hands
It's in the air
But you can't breath it
You're not the one I used to know
Gone to your head

It's up your nose
But you can't snort it
It's down your throat
But you can't suck it
It's on your lap
But you can't have it
it's in your reach
But you can't grab it

And what if I said
It's in your head
You're not the one I used to know
And what if I said
It's in your head
You're not the one I used to know
Gone to your head
