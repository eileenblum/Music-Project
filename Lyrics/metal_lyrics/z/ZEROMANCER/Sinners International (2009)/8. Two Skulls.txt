You try it with me
You had me in stitches
And you wrapped me around your
Little fingers

Tease me and I please you
Teach me and I beat you

We're drawn together
Flesh and heart
Even death won't do us apart

It's sickness alone
Two skulls one soul
Less than nothing
Two skulls one soul
It's sickness alone
Two skulls one soul
Less than nothing
Two skulls one soul
Well this is us on our own

I wish I had your elegance
And you taste in sin
I wish I had your arrogance
Your sarcasm from within

Tease me and I please you
Teach me and I beat you

Two skulls one soul
It's sickness alone
Two skulls one soul
Less than nothing
Two skulls one soul

Try it with me
You had me in stitches
And you wrapped me around your
Little fingers
You told me no no amends
It's just way out of sight again.

Two skulls one soul
