My sin is treachery
I say one thing and do another
That's cause I'm dying

With your tyranny
deep inside of me
Put yourself in my place
and feel what I feel

I'm in too deep with you
My little tragedy
I'm in too deep with you
My little tragedy

With your slavery
you on top of me
With your nails in my face
Scratching bleeding

I'm in too deep with you
and all you do
Is fucking hurt me

I'm in too deep with you
My little tragedy

I'm in too deep with you
I'm falling like a stone
into water
And when you learn to swim
You want to pick me up again
I'll be gone
Driven to sea

oh oh oh oh

I'm in too deep with you
My little tragedy
I'm in too deep with you
My little tragedy
