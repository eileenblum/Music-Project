You feel
it can stay this way
And you still feel
it all got lost that day

But you gave it away now
you can't touch it
You gave it away now
you can't have it

Your imaginary friends appear
To make you feel like you're god for a day
You're king for a day
You're something special

You feel
it's crawled up inside
Loveless and numb
You say it's over now

But you gave it away now
you can't touch it
You gave it away now
you can't have it

Your imaginary friends appear
To make you feel like you're god for a day
You're king for a day
You're something special one of a kind
You got two imaginary hands
Holding you down
With a gun to your head
Alive when you're dead
That's when an angel's here

Yeah

Your imaginary friends appear
To make you feel like you're god for a day
You're king for a day
You're something special one of a kind
You got two imaginary hands
Holding you down
With a gun to your head
Alive when your dead
That's when an angel

Your imaginary friends
Your imaginary friends
Oooooh Your imaginary friends
Oooooh Your imaginary friends
Like you're god for a day
