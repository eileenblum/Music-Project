I can feel it
When you say you regret
Without
Missing
One
Beat

And it moves and it throbs
Tear you inside out till it stops
And it moves and it throbs
Tear you inside out till it stops

Unless you don't know
What it feels like
I know you don't know
What it feels like

One in two
Use you
Violate you
By losing control

Unless you don't know
What it feels like
I know you don't know
What it feels like

Fictional
It's all too fictional to me

And it moves and it throbs
Tear you inside out till it stops
And it moves and it throbs
Tear you inside out till it stops

Unless you don't know
What it feels like
I know you don't know
What it feels like
Unless you don't know (what it's like)
What it feels like
I know you don't know (what it's like)
What it feels like

Fictional
