Let me take it out on you
The hate inside
The pain that I wear
I can no longer hide
Tear me apart to see
You gave away
The guilt in your eyes
It feels like this
When you make a wish

I'm yours to lose, yeah
Why do you care?
Beneath a thousand truths
I'm yours to lose

You lay something here with fear
The pain so intense
In dreams you might find just what you're looking for
But it all depends
You know
In life, in death
The only thing that is real is
The chill of your own breath

I'm yours to lose, yeah
Why do you care?
The world's my devil when you're not here
To lose, yeah
Why do you care?
The world's my devil when you're not here
To amuse, yeah
Why do you care?
The world's my devil when you're not here
To lose, yeah
Why do you care?
Beneath a thousand truths
I'm yours to lose

Swear you love me
Swear you cry
Funny how fast those tears dry
Scum like you deserves to die

I'm yours to lose, yeah
Why do you care?
The world's my devil when you're not here
To lose, yeah
Why do you care?
The world's my devil when you're not here
To amuse, yeah
Why do you care?
The world's my devil when you're not here
To lose, yeah
Why do you care?
Beneath a thousand truths
I'm yours to lose
