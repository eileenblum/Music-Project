Sometimes you
Just have to
Risk it all to get what you want
Sometimes you
Just have to
Risk it all to get what you want

Now tell me
(I just want you to know)
Now tell me
(I just want you to know)

We're on our own against the world again
Oh understand
It's you and me
When all alone against the world again
Don't you understand?

Sometimes you
Just want to (oh oh oh yeah)
Sometimes you
Just want to (oh oh oh yeah)

It's you and me
We're on our own against the world again
Oh understand 
Nothing will ever change the way we are
Nothing will make us stop

Sometimes you
Just have to risk it all to get what you want
Sometimes you
Just have to risk it all to get what you want

It's our ugliness against the world again

It's us against the world again
Our ugliness against the world again
It's us against the world again
Our ugliness against the world again
Nothing can make us stop
