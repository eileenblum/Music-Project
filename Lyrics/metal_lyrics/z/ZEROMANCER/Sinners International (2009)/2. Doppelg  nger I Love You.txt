How can I save you
When I can't even save myself
Oh, you want me
A number of different ways

Feel me
Fuck me
Hurt me
Love me
Hate me
Save me
Kill me

Feel me
Fuck me
Hurt me
Love me
Hate me
Save me
Kill me

DoppelgÃ¤nger I love you
My pain is your pain
Your veins are my veins
Your chains are my chains, too

How can I save you
When I can't even save myself
Now you want your own
Sick requiem
Cry on cue
Oh, you want to

Feel me
Fuck me
Hurt me
Love me
Hate me
Save me
Kill me

Feel me
Fuck me
Hurt me
Love me
Hate me
Save me
Kill me

DoppelgÃ¤nger I love you
My pain is your pain
Your veins are my veins
Your chains are my chains, too

DoppelgÃ¤nger I love you
My pain is your pain
Your veins are my veins
Your chains are my chains, too

How can I save you
When I can't even save myself
How can I save you
When I can't even save myself

DoppelgÃ¤nger I love you
My pain is your pain
Your veins are my veins
Your chains are my chains, too

DoppelgÃ¤nger I love you
My pain is your pain
Your veins are my veins
Your chains are my chains, too
