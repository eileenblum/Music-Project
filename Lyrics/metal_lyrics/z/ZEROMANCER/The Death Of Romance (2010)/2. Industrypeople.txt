We are the Industry people

With this death kiss
Choose needs over me
Put your lips to my fist
And now this in eclipse

Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way

Blind your eyes
Bow your head
A swollen halo
Of your own hell
Face yourself
Chosen one
No matter what you've said
Or what you've done

We are the Industry people
Don't feel anything
Choose your kin
Rendezvous and let the chaos begin

With this death kiss
Choose needs over me
Put your lips to my fist
And now this in eclipse

Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way

Blind your eyes
Chosen one
No matter what you say
Or what you've done

We are the Industry people
Don't feel anything
Choose your kin
Rendezvous and let the chaos begin

Won't let this stand in our way
Won't let this stand in our way

The black curtains fall
Owe it all to violence
Please
Send my apologies

Oh, let the black curtains fall
Standing tall
Assemble and tease
Electropolis

We are the Industry people
Don't feel anything
Choose your kin
Rendezvous and let the chaos begin

We are the Industry people
Don't feel anything
Choose your kin
Rendezvous and let the chaos begin

We are the Industry people
We are the Industry people
