[spoken]

A person climaxes when they die
(Today I will marry my prince)
So he had the gun in his hand and he told her
(Wedding vows continue in background)
He said now "When you start to reach your climax tell me when"
As soon as she started reaching her climax
She told him "Ok now"
And we she said now, he took the gun to his head
Bang
She sucked the blood from his mouth and it was warm
And she said it was just too much
That I should try it sometime
