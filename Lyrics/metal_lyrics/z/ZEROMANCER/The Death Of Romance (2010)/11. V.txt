I don't want to be blind
I don't want to be tied up in this pain
It's a guilt thing It's a blood drive
The final kiss 
how this world can rescue us

Help me god I can't control myself 
Help me god I can't control myself
Help me god I can't control myself 
Help me god I can't control myself

I don't want to be blind (blind)
Don't want to be vain (vain)
I don't want to be tied up in this pain
I don't want to be vile (vile) 
Don't want to admit
I don't want you to treat me like shit

Help me god I can't control myself 
Help me god I can't control myself
Help me god I can't control myself 
Help me god I can't control myself

Taking the one out of one love 
how come it feels so numb
taking the to out of together
Put the N back in ever

I don't want to bleed
I don't want to forget what I feel

Help me god I can't control myself 
Help me god I can't control myself
Help me god I can't control myself 
Help me god I can't control myself

Taking the one out of One love 
How come it feels so wrong
Taking the to out of together
Put the N back in ever

It's a guilt thing
It's a blood drive
The final kiss of this world
of this world

Taking the third out of your act
How come I don't react
Taking the for out of forever
Put the N back in ever
