Want it 
More than you want it
Want it 
More than you want it

Want it 
More than you want it
Want it 
More than it hurts in here

I'm not afraid, no
No, I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid, no
I'm not afraid anymore

The virgin ring
The 'I want' syndrome
The modern lies
The future fear
Will you suffer
When you're there

You know it hurts
You know it hurts in here

I'm not afraid, no
No, I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid, no
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid this time
I'll toe the line

This kingdom
You were given
A number
My silence holds thunder

Can't hold it
Much longer
I'm breathing the fire
You are under
