You say it's the isolation
Wrench yourself apart this time
I will draw the line for you
I will draw the line for you

You say it's your fixation
You say it's the only way
Lay you down on a plinth
Now the sky is taking a black tint
Lay you down on a plinth
Now the sky is taking a black tint

I cut you loose 
I'm coming back
And I run away you tell yourself
It's not the end 
I fuck around
Let me tell you when it's over

Let's say it's the isolation
That will break the fall for you
That will break the fall for you

I cut you lose 
I'm coming back
Run away you tell yourself
It's not the end 
I fuck around
Let me tell you when it's over

I cut you lose 
I'm coming back
Run away you tell yourself
It's not the end 
I fuck around
Let me tell you when it's over

I cut you loose 
I'm coming back
Run away you tell yourself
It's not the end 
I fuck around
Let me tell you when it's over

It's the sound of you
Closing out the world again
Lay you down on the plinth
Closing out the world again
