Try to imagine how it feels to me
The idea of loyality
It's gonna be a lovely day
To get this hatred out of the way

(A) It's so easy 
(B) It's so easy
(C) It's so easy
H-A-T-E

I hate you in a love you way
Though I bet you don't feel that way
I hate you in a love you way
Though I bet you don't feel that way

I have my own way with a to z
My heart's an ashtray
Tearing a hole
Inside of me

It's so easy
It's so easy
H-A-T-E

I hate you in a love you way
Though I bet you don't feel that way
I hate you in a love you way
Though I bet you don't feel that way

I'm falling through the net
You're trying to block the holes
And I'm falling deep this time
Swap places
Change the roles

H-A-T-E
I am my own worst enemy

I hate you in a love you way
Though I bet you don't feel that way
I hate you in a love you way
Though I bet you don't feel that way

I'm falling through the net
You're trying to block the holes
And I'm falling deep this time
Swap places
Change the roles
