I let you breathe in this emptiness
See me as I am
You know the answer
Long before it's given

You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one
Who can erase this
You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one
Who can erase this now

The sun, the sea, the sky
The loneliness, the why
The fear of losing everything
In a goodbye
The colors in the air
The hollowness, a tear
The depths of your mistakes
Are drawing near

Now the air gets thin the walls are closing in
I didn't realize just how alone I am until now
So I'm staring at you across the room
But hey, it's not like it's the first time
The ground has fallen away

Is there any way to make this hold
Through the wind and through the cold
Then show me
Show me
Is there a line you're willing to cross
Through the rain and through this loss
Then show me
Show me

You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one
Who can erase this
You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one
Who can erase this now
