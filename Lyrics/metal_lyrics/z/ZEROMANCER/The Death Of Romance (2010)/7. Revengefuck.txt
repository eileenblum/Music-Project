What you feel when the violence burns
The feathers in black you're holding in back
What you feel is a violent play
Before you undress let me confess

Everyone I've had is in you
And when I fuck you
I fuck them all

Revenge fuck doesn't it feel good to loath
The pain inside you bleeds away
Revenge fuck doesn't it feel good to loath
The pain inside you bleeds away
Thrust by thrust

now you got the taste for it
now you got the taste for it
now you got the taste for it
now you got the taste for it

This temptation swallows you up
Spiraling you down to a different place
This temptation swallows you up
Spiraling you down to a different place

Revenge fuck doesn't it feel good to loath
The pain inside you bleeds away
Revenge fuck doesn't it feel good to loath
The pain inside you bleeds away
Thrust by thrust by thrust

What you feel when the violence burns
The feathers in black you're holding it back
Would the ghost grace a devil inside
With a kiss you couldn't resist

Revenge fuck doesn't it feel good to loath
The pain inside you bleeds away
Revenge fuck doesn't it feel good to loath
The pain inside you bleeds away

Revenge fuck
Revenge fuck
