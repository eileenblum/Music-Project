Look at you now
Regroup 
All dead inside
You can't feel your
Or touch her the ones you want

(And when will you learn that)
My heart can't take this?
(And when will you know that)
My heart can't take this?

You're so pretty when you kill me
(Swallow me down)
The poison 
Clears my mind
Oh you kill me when you say it
(Out loud)
That you want me

Resent yourself 
Don't talk
Got you paranoid
Admit the passion 
Admit the boy
You're here to destroy

And when will you learn that 
My heart can't take this?
And when will you know that 
My heart can't take this?

You're so pretty when you kill me
(Swallow me down)
The poison 
Clears my mind
Oh you kill me when you say it
(Out loud)
That you want me

Ah ah

And when will you know that my heart can't take this?

Out loud

All dead inside
And I'm dead inside

You're so pretty when you kill me
(Swallow me down)
The poison 
Clears my mind
Oh you kill me when you say it
(Out loud)
That you want me

Oh you kill me when you say it
Oh you kill me when you say it
