Can't you see my hands are clean
I'm as holy as can be
I will never do you harm
I am fractured
It can never be the same

What kind of life is this ?

Can't you see my hands are clean
I'm as holy as can be
I will never do you harm again
I am fractured
It can never be the same

What kind of life is this ?

I warned you a thousand times
It's like crying to the clouds

And why are you asking me questions
You already know the answer to

A good life
Is a quiet life
