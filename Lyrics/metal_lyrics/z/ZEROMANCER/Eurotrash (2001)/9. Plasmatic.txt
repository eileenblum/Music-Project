Eat my soul
From a silverspoon
Think I need some of that
Breathing room
Do you hear
The ringing in my ear
Am I the only one
Who can make myself
Disappear

Plasmatic
What is wrong when your
Ego is a rose in bloom
Plasmatic
All I know is my
Ego is a room without a view

Fed up of repeating myself
You are looking for something I haven't got
Fed ex dreams when things are too slow
Only let you know what you need to know

Now is the time
For you and me
