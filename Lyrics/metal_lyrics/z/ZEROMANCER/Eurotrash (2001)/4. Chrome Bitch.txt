I found myself
All wired up
On things I don't really care about
It makes no sense
What I'm going through
I lay on my back taking shit from you

Why do I have to put up with this ?

The Pleasure
It goes away as you start to love

Filth Kiss Chrome Bitch

You peeled me off
Like a second skin
You tried to find another way in
To my deepest secret
My deepest scars
It's gotta hurt the stuff you see in the stars
