I'm Just A Hired Gun
I'm Just A Hired Gun

You Could Die Right Now
In My Arms, Now
In My Arms, Now

You Don't Know How To Feel It
With Your Hopes And Dreams
Slit Like Wrists

Gimme Some, Gimme Some
You Gotta Gimme Some
Gimme Some, Gimme Some
Gimme Some, Gimme Some
You Gotta Gimme Some
Gimme Some, Gimme Some

Take My Selfish Dread,
And Use It,On You

Take My Selfish Dread,
And Use It,On You

You Don't Know How To Fake It
You Could Die Right Now
In My Arms, Now
In My Arms, Now

Did You Walk Away
And Feel Nothing?

Take My Selfish Dread,
And Use It,On You

Take My Selfish Dread,
And Use It,On You

I'm Just A Hired Gun
I'm Just A Hired Gun

Sell!(My Soul!)
To Know!(Myself!)
FEEL!(My Dread!)
Expand!(We Run!)
Out Of Control!
Out Of Control!

Gimme Some, Gimme Some
You Gotta Gimme Some
Gimme Some, Gimme Some

Take My Selfish Dread,
And Use It, 
On You

Take My Selfish Dread,
And Use It, 
On You

Take My Selfish Dread,
And Use It, 
On You

Take My Selfish Dread,
And Use It, 
On You
