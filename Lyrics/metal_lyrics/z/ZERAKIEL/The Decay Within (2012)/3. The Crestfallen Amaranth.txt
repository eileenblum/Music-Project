The beaten one tried to give oneÂ´s all
Fell into tears after giving it all
The moon and the stars are so heavy to carry
It would be easier just to surrender
In tomorrow there is nothing to grow
In yesterday everything burns

To rise and fly just to fall again
The sun will shine no more
The crestfallen amaranth torn into thousands of shreds
The world seems to be more gentle
When seen through tears
I am the cemetery

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The skies cannot be reached from six feet under
Everything around is silent and cold
The time has come to withdraw
into the individual darkness

"The shine of my halo has died down
Something else shines inside of me
It's the fire of venom and pain
Is keeping me awake"
