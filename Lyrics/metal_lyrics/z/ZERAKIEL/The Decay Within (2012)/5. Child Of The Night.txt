The moment of silent night
Exhausted eyes wants to fall asleep
When the wings are no longer carrying
And the world's shackles strangling you
The moment of dying night
Secretly you are afraid
Don't be afraid

Tonight faded a star from the darkening sky
Life was like a dream and now you get to live in a dream
In the deepest sorrow and the most heartfelt tears
Remains the longing
Child of the night

When the morning dawns
You have fallen asleep
Smile faded from the face
Life faded from the eyes
Now, hear the silence
Walk into the darkness
Rest in peace

"HÃ¤n jÃ¤tti taakseen katkeran maan
Vaipui kauniiseen kuolemaan
HÃ¤n saanut on rauhan ikuisen
JÃ¤ttÃ¤nyt kaipauksen suloisen
Nyt yÃ¶ hÃ¤nen untansa varjella saa
YÃ¶n lapsi varjojen maassa nukahtaa

Kauniita unia..."
