[Chastain / M. Harris]

I don't really give a damn or what you really say
it doesn't matter to me now, you still have to pay
You've beat me down to the ground one to many times
The perfect illusion, is what I'm going to find

Searching for freedom
I'm a man same as you no matter what your game
Searching for freedom
Look me in the eyes and call me by name

You've slapped in the face, you've shoved me against the wall
You made me a slave, with all your holy laws
I'm going to stand up for my rights no matter what the price
Your racial injustice may cost me my life

Searching for freedom
I'm a man same as you no matter what your game
Searching for freedom
Look me in the eyes and call me by name

This is your last warning, I'm second class no more
You better listen to me or there's gonna be a war

This is your last warning, I'm second class no more
You better listen to me or you're having your war

I've just looked at evil straight in demise
The prejudice must be erased, it can not be disguised
The color of my skin, should not be my course
We should all be equal, humanity comes first

Searching for freedom
I'm a man same as you no matter what your game
Searching for freedom
Look me in the eyes and call me by name

Searching for freedom
I'm a man same as you no matter what your game
Searching for freedom
Look me in the eyes and call me by name

Searching for freedom
Searching for freedom
