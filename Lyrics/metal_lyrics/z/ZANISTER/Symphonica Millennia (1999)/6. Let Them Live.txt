[Chastain]

The innocent in cages wait for their fate
Murdering hands reach forth in haste
What is their crime that brings execution
What makes you god to state this solution

Let them live, hear their cries

humanity lives on with blood on its hand
Since the dawn of time, there is murder in this land
As the new age shines, the fools still kill on
Civilized death till everything is gone

Let them live, hear their cries

The innocent are lost to the righteous march
They kill the lessor ones so there's room for more
The life of the lamb is no less than mine
Gandhi spoke of this many times

The human complex grows out of control
Lost memories and godlike dreams
Free all the innocents, they are nature's soul
They deserve life as much as you and I

Let them live, hear their cries
Let them live, hear their cries

Let them live
