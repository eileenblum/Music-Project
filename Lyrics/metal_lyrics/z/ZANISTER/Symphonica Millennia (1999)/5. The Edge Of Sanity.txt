[Chastain / Mark Shelton]

The creatures of the night are stirring
My soul it longs to be set free
My blood is fire forever burning
The spirits come to dance for me
I scream but no one hears me, I run but still I'm doomed
Ancients of Egypt haunt me, curse of the Pharaoh's tomb

We dug into the sacred valley
For tombs of ancient kings
We found the treasure of golden dreams
Now everyone is dead but me
I scream but no one hears me, I run but still I'm doomed
Ancients of Egypt haunt me, curse of the Pharaoh's tomb

The curse burns on eternally
The wolves they bay to torment me
Bloody payment for blaspheming
The sacred tomb of Egypt's king

The Pharaoh's guardians come to taunt me
With visions of my death to be
The curse of Osiris upon me
I'm on the edge of sanity
I scream but no one hears me, I run but still I'm doomed
Ancients of Egypt haunt me, curse of the Pharaoh's tomb

Inside the book of the dead, my name in blood has been written
The curse hangs over my head, with no chance to be forgiven
No banishings to be said, Egyptian hell I must live in
This is the edge of sanity, there is no cheating destiny
The ship of fate has come for me, the vengeful gods show no mercy

Strong is the power, this curse is old
Soon to devour, my soul

The night beckons, it calls to me
The spirits dance upon the breeze
I live the curse eternally
I'm on the edge of sanity
