[Chastain / M. Harris]

In this day and time you know it's really, hard to see
How man has suffered, and died to be free
If you ask me why it's God, power and greed
We'll give our life for what, we believe

We are the fighters from the sky
After today there is no more
In the Earth's final war
We are the fighters from the sky

If we must die we'll die, with our pride
It's like a grand of sand slowly washed out with the tide
The war machine must eat, no matter what you try

We are the fighters from the sky
After today there is no more
In the Earth's final war
We are the fighters from the sky

After the battle, the soldiers are confessing
They've seen the losers, and now they count their blessing

In the fields the soldiers scream in misery and pain
What was their crime in life, seeking glory and fame
As they breathe their last breath, they cry out in blame
What is wrong with man today, they are bred insane

We are the fighters from the sky
After today there is no more
In the Earth's final war
We are the fighters from the sky

We are the fighters, fighters from the sky
