[Chastain / M. Harris]

Anger the angels, humor the devils
Fool the gods, It's hard to do
Save the saints, turn the other cheek
Praise the forgiven, expose the truth...oh!

Save me now, (Save me now), take me home, (take me home)
Save me now, (Save me now), take me home

Forget the past, It's an illusion
Look at today, it's all for you
Call out for justice, in a world gone mad
Seek forth the sinner, learn something new

Save me now, (Save me now), take me home, (take me home)
Save me now, (Save me now), take me home

Save me now, oh, oh, oh...take me home

Pray for the pope, he's lost his way
Telling forth the masses, it's time to renew
It's all a fallacy, fairy tales gone wild
The rich gets richer, it's just for a few

Take me home

Deceitful preachers, spew forth their hate
Send in your money, that's how we judge your faith
The blind followers, raise their hands
reaching for God, like a mindless fool...yeah!

Save me now, (Save me now), take me home, (take me home)
Save me now, (Save me now), take me home

Save me now, take me home
Save me now, take me home

Don't tell me your laws, as holy as they are
I lived by faith, not by broken rules
Gather your thoughts, so deep within
Right versus wrong, It's only you
