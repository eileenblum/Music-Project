[Chastain / M. Harris]

You've been on my back for far, far too long
Get out of my face, I have done nothing wrong
I'm tired of your lies, and I'm tired of your tries
It's sure not a crime, it's time your eulogized

It's time for your downfall
You've ask for a war now it's do or die
It's time for you downfall
I beg you, I beg you, I beg you to try...me

You look in my room and you look in my bed
It's none of your business NO! that's what I said
You preach you holy words and you do as you please
It's gonna be a showdown, I'll knock you to your knees

I've thought at night, I've wished aloud
I'm looking toward your downfall
It's going to be a sight, I'll be so proud
At the victory dance of your downfall

It's time for your downfall
You've ask for a war now it's do or die
It's time for you downfall
I beg you, I beg you, I beg you to try

If I catch you again, talking about my sins
There will be some action, and I know I'm going to win
I'm tired of your lies, and I'm tired of your tries
It's sure not a crime, it's time your eulogized

It's time for your downfall
You've ask for a war now it's do or die
It's time for you downfall
I beg you, I beg you, I beg you to try

It's time for your downfall
You've ask for a war now it's do or die
It's time for you downfall
I beg you, I beg you, I beg you to do...try

It's time for your downfall
It's time for your downfall
