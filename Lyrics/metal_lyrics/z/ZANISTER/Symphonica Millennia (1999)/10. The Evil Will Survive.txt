[Chastain]

In the night's cold winter touch, I felt the presence close
I feel the icy starring, I sense the vicious foe
mayhem and dark infamy, showing his own blasphemy
Tell me why

They will breed us, they will lead us, they will bleed us
Evil will survive
They have made us, they have played us, they have mazed us
Evil will survive
They will shape us, they will rape us, they will jape us
Evil will survive
They have framed us, they have maimed us, they have shamed us
Evil will survive
Tell me why

As I close my eyes to sleep, I see the demon's face
I know that he is laughing, as he plans our disgrace
Screaming to be saved, knowing it's all gone today

They will breed us, they will lead us, they will bleed us
Evil will survive
They have made us, they have played us, they have mazed us
Evil will survive
They will shape us, they will rape us, they will jape us
Evil will survive
They have framed us, they have maimed us, they have shamed us
Evil will survive

In the morning's bright embrace, there is something amiss
When I look into the mirror, my reflection doesn't exist
Stolen within my dreams, my soul is gone so it seems
Tell me why

They will breed us, they will lead us, they will bleed us
Evil will survive
They have made us, they have played us, they have mazed us
Evil will survive
They will shape us, they will rape us, they will jape us
Evil will survive
They have framed us, they have maimed us, they have shamed us
Evil will survive
