[Chastain / M. Harris]

You see us a fool so weakened
You took our last bit of honor
You laugh in our face so often
You think you got us down
You'll be surprised, when we stand

We are the power and we are the force
We have been brought forth to fight
We will be victors and we'll win the war
We will bring glory tonight

On and on you've tortured
We've heard your bile for the last time
I think you need to be silenced
You think you got us down
You'll be surprised, when we stand

We are the power and we are the force
We have been brought forth to fight
We will be victors and we'll win the war
We will bring glory tonight

You've lined us up for execution
We've taken their best shot
We'll drive you out of our homeland
For honor we have fought

For honor we have fought

You've lined us up for execution
You think you've got us figured out
Your deadly ways have grown tired
You think you got us down
You'll be surprised, when we stand

We are the power and we are the force
We have been brought forth to fight
We will be victors and we'll win the war
We will bring glory tonight

We will bring glory
We will bring glory
