[Chastain / M. Harris]

Through all the years, through history
Seeing the wars and misery
Asking out loud how high the price
Afraid to count, all the loss of life

Born in cold blood, born in cold blood

Dishonorable men, dishonest deeds
Stealing the lands for their own greed
Vanquishing people for their stay
Killing them all, stand in their way

Born in cold blood, born in cold blood

Realize your paradise but know the costs
Analyze the sacrifice for all that is lost
Emphasize the A device and the holocaust
Vulgarize the final vice for all we have crossed

Energize the voice, with the complaint
Moralize the call, for calm restraint
Neutralize the bellicose, and its evil plans
Idolize the peace, for all that it stands

Born in cold blood, born in cold blood

We've been born
Born in cold blood
We've been born
Born in cold blood

Through all the years, through history
Seeing the wars and misery
Asking out loud how high the price
Afraid to count, all the loss of life

Born in cold blood, born in cold blood
Born in cold blood, born in cold blood
