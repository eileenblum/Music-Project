[Chastain]

Call out their names, legends live on
Movements through time, can't change the past

Look through the span of all history
To the lands of the pharaohs
We can't believe all they have done
Even now we don't know

Buildings so grand, temples so vast
The pyramids are forever
Tell me how
They were children of the gods

Centuries have passed, millenniums in fact
And still they have all their secrets
The Sphinx stands tall, over Giza
Guarding the truth as a sentinel

Buildings so grand, temples so vast
The pyramids are forever
Tell me how
They were children of the gods

Call out their names, legends live on
Movements through time, can't change the past...oh no!, oh no!

Memphis and Tebes, Abu Simbel
Home to all the ancients
Alexandria burned to the ground
And with it all the answers

Buildings so grand, temples so vast
The pyramids are forever
Tell me how
They were children of the gods

Children of the gods, children of the gods
Children of the gods, children of the gods

Children of the gods, children of the gods
