I believe in the ancient wisdoms
I believe in the ancient texts
I believe that we all will live on
Another life is next
On and on and on we go
I Fear No Man I Fear No Man

I have faced the legions of Rome
I have beat the odds unknown
I have called out for mercy
I have been denied the plea
I Fear No Man I Fear No Man

I have died in battles alone
I have killed to defend my home
I have lived a life of sin
I have been born to live again
I Fear No Man I Fear No Man

I have fought until the death
I have gone past my last breath
Here I stand I passed the test
I'll show you all I'm not like the rest

I have earned high honors before
I have shamed my name no more

I Fear No Man I Fear No Man

I believe in the ancient wisdoms
I believe in the ancient texts
I believe that we all will live on
Another life is next
On and on and on we go
I Fear No Man I Fear No Man
