Time to shut down the lights
Clear your mind, so all can be right
Let the waves explore you
Wash the old, grab on to the new
Reach deep into your mind
Feel your body slowly unwind

About this time, Feel the grip of the grind
Then you start to move
As you grind with the grip of the groove

Ride the night with the lights
Spread your arms, so you can take flight
Thrust on through your senses
Tearing down all your fences
Grinding and thrashing and moving your soul
Cast out the tension that's taken control
Rhythms and passion that pulsates your vibe
Breathing and sweating knowing you're alive

[Chorus:]
Close your eyes and fall through
Think of knots that you can undo
Reach and find your passion
Caring not of what's in fashion
Meet the heat with reflex
Venture way past what we all call sex
Find your inner spirit
Feel the noise and then you'll hear it

[Chorus:]
Grinding and thrashing and moving your soul
Cast out the tension that's taken control
Rhythms and passion that pulsates your vibe
Breathing and sweating you know you're alive
Reaching and searching and loosing your mind
Feel all senses as you start to Grind
Touching the sound as you all start to move
Gripping the grind as you Grind with the Grip of the Groove
