I'm a broken man, do the best I can
Just like the water, turns the rocks to sand
I feel so empty, at least I can feel
I can't let it go, of the things I don't know

I felt the fire burning within my soul
I lost my mind and then I lost control

Well is there freedom or is it state of mind
I'm feeling anxious like running out of time
I can't let it go, of the things I don't know

I felt the fire burning within my soul
I lost my mind and then I lost control
I felt the fire burning within my soul
I lost my mind and then I lost control

Well are there answers to why I feel this way
Will they remain questions and that's how they'll say
I can't let it go, of the things I don't know

I felt the tire burning within my soul
I lost my mind and then I lost control
I felt the tire burning within my soul
I lost my mind and then I lost control
