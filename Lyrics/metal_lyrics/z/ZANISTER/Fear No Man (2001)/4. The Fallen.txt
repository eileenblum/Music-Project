They came and went
With fashion and pride
They found the way
Bach to the other side

We think in one dimension
We think we only dream
We think we know all the answers
The Fallen are supreme

They are among us
Observing you and I
They speak to you
But you never realize
They are The Fallen
They are The Fallen

You do not know
If they out there in the dark
For such a long time
Call out if you dare

We think in one dimension
We think we only dream
We think we know all the answers
The Fallen are supreme

They are The Fallen
They are The Fallen
