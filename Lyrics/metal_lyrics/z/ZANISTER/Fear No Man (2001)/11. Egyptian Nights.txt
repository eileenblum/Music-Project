Egyptian nights they do you well
I sense its' misery, I breathe its' spell
I walk the streets now, it seems unreal
I have returned, for my appeal
Forgive me my tragedy
Mercy please your majesty

I feel you, my Queen's delight
I served you, on an Egyptian Night

Across the Nile, before eyes of dread
I killed the pharaoh, as you said
You promised riches, eternal life
I was condemned, it was my price
Forgive me my tragedy
Mercy please your majesty

I feel you, my Queen's delight
I served you, on an Egyptian Night

I was your lover, I was your fool
I still never knew
You signed my sentence, a fate of death
I still wait for you

Into the void, my soul did stay
Forever searching, for this day
You're with the gods now, as you should
Four thousand years, I understood
Forgive me my tragedy
Mercy please your majesty

I feel you, my Queen's delight
I served you, on an Egyptian Night

Egyptian nights they did you well
I am its' misery, I live its' spell
