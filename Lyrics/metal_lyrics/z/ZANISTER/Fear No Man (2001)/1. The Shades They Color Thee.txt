Be not afraid make your display
Tearing down the fence like there is no enclosure
Strong in the mind never fall back in line
Take in every breath like you are moving in closer
Ooooaaaoh you were born with it
Ooooaaaoh can't he torn with it

I see it, within my eyes
Believe it, FREEDOM

Oohhh, ripen through all, cut like a saw
You're always out in front cause there is no direction
Breathe in the air, give up your cares
Heal yourself from others and all there infection
Oooooaaaaooh YOU WERE BORN WITH IT

[Chorus:]
We all should not bleed, so we can survive
Waiting to be tree
We wait to be alive, we are simply all
Children that are tree, it doesn't matter what
Shades they color thee, Shades they color thee
Shades they color thee, Shades they color thee

Be not afraid, cut like a blade
The color of your skin should not be an opinion
Be strong in your mind, never fall back in line
Stand on your own ground and defend your dominion
OOOaaaaaoh YOU WERE BORN WITH IT!

I see it, within my eyes
Believe it, FREEDOM

[Chorus]
