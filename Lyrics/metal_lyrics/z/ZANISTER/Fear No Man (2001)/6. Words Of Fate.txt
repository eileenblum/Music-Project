Visualize to yesterday and all it had to say
Memorize the wise tales and who they betray
Organize all your thoughts and tile them away
Insanity was the price you had to pay
On and on the road goes on
Never does it end

Words of fate, we were warned long ago
Words of late, this could be all we know

Mastermind your fantasy, to your life's prize
Pass the time, you believe, it starts when you die
See the sign, it's the key, never to lie
Praise the kind, holy, so pure and divine
On and on the road goes on
Never does it end

Words of fate, we were warned long ago
Words of fate, this could be all we know

What's the plan, you understand, you're only one man
Sacrifice, will not suffice, you sense the end of life
Where to run, it's now begun, no matter of your funds
Angerly, you feel deceived, and now you must grieve
On and on the road goes on
Never does it end

Words of fate, we were warned long ago
Words of late, this could be all we know
Words of fate, we were warned long ago
Words of late, this could be all we know
