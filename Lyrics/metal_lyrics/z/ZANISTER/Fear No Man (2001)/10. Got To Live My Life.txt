The flame that is torching me,
Profane are things it makes me see,
I don't ever want to get burnt again, I got to live my life
Survival is the tone I talk to my friends, even in sacrifice

Cross the line. One more time
I've always knew I just got to live my life
So I'm never, ever gonna breakdown

Be brave, you don't have to follow me
Reclaim, what some call destiny?
Spread your wings so far out on the wind
Breathing in the air
And every time the storm comes rolling in
Let your talon's flair

One more time. Defend your mind
Life is often complicated
Filled with dust and overrated lies

I Crave, the heart that beats in me
No slave, I shall let freedom ring
Even when you seem to be a broken man
Gather up your might
The winner is the one at which the end he stands
And didn't even fight

Defend your mind. One last time
One last time. Cross the line

I've always knew I just got to live my life
So I'm never, ever gonna breakdown

GOTTA LIVE MY LIFE, GOTTA LIVE MY LIFE
GOTTA LIVE MY LIFE
I'M NEVER GONNA BREAKDOWN
