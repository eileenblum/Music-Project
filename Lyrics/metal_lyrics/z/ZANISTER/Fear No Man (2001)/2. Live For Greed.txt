As you look at the ticker tape
You count the dollar signs
You sure don't worry about the costs
Fill your worth declines
You drive around in your fancy cars
Your show off your home
30 rooms and a guest house to
Yet you live all alone

How much do you really need
You only live for Greed... Live For Greed

Thousands sleep on the streets at night
Just a few miles away
You spit at them at every chance you have
And on every day
You cheat and steal for your gain
It's all part of the game
Your bottom line is all that counts
You don't feel the shame

How much do you really need
You only Live for Greed... Live for Greed

On and on your money grows
Sitting in a vault
While misery spreads throughout the world
Money is at fault

Your friends are bought on the way
To the promised land
You've never loved and you never will
It's not in your plan

How much do you really need
You only live for Greed... live for Greed
