Where the mountains meet the sky
I watch dreams through the eagle's eye
In the valley of hate
People dying losing faith
It's just hell on earth

Angels crying from people lying
Drowning rain ends all their pain
The gods were calling but no one heard
In the end we get what we deserve
It's just bell on earth
Looks like we've all been cursed

Life or death we all seem to forget
Living our life this way so selfishly
Just leads to regret

Christ all mighty
Can you save us from ourselves
Deliver us from evil
We have got no one else
When I was young
I use to get down on my knees
Pray to you to cure this hatred disease

Is there some way we can change
Power envy anger is to blame
Judgment day comes to us all
Will you rise or will you fall

It's just hell on earth
Looks like we've all been cursed
