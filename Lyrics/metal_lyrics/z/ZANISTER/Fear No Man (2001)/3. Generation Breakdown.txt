Guns in the schoolroom, violence in the air
Drugs manifesting, creates despair
Everyone thinks they're cool, little do they know
They arc on a path, with nowhere to go
I know that times must change its now their day
It just seems all so wrong, hate is on its way

Generation Breakdown

Music of the masses has numbed down the brain
No one seems to care at all it's all the same
I know that times must change it's now their day
It just seems all so wrong hate is on its way

Generation Breakdown

Heroes of hoodlums gods made from swill
No one blames all their words or blames their will
Eliminate their idols with a deadly late
Their world is empty except for their hate
I know that times must change it's now their day
It just seems all so wrong hate is on its' way
