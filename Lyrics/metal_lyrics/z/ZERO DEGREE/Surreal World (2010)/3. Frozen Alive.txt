I've lost all my own senses
Dragged into another sphere
Resignation and stagnation
I stood and stumbled here

When all life begins to fade
It's time to escape
When all life begins to fade
It's time to be erased

Is this the only real life?
Who can define it?
I'll never seem to understand
I'm frozen alive

Down below in the shadow of coldness
I'm unable to cry out
Empty mirrors are reflecting
The passion of death to wipe out

When all life begins to fade
It's time to escape
When all life begins to fade
It's time to be erased

Is this the only real life?
Who can define it?
I'll never seem to understand
I'm frozen alive
