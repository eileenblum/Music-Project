No one to guide us, to guide us in this place
Feel the pain of this world in blaze

All the roses, they all blossom black
A lonely orphan sings the final track

When everything seems lost in this world 
Who protects us from what we want?
When everything seems lost in this world
Who will take care?

Smoke the day's last cigarette 
Because no saviour will be sent

Say your prayers and let them go
Your gentle tears will find no hope

When everything seems lost in this world 
Who protects us from what we want?
When everything seems lost in this world
Who will take care?

So wise, but they aren't understanding
Life's self-made disease
