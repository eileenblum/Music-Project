Born into a hybrid world, a mental illusion of 
Your digital self
Feel the breath of the iron lung, titanium spine
Made of cyber junk

Do you believe in fate?
Do you feel far away from the truth?
Do you accept what you see?
Do you control your life?

Welcome to my surreal world
Come in and waste your time
A prison for your mind

The TV screen sent subliminal codes, to blind
Your mind from the truth
The system has made a virtual cage, the world
Turns into an abstract age

Do you believe in fate?
Do you feel far away from the truth?
Do you accept what you see?
Do you control your life?

Synthetic life in every cell
Manipulated imitations from hell

Welcome to my surreal world
Come in and waste your time
A prison for your mind
