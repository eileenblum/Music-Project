Say, can you see the rising darkness on the horizon?
Say, can you feel the dying light in the sky?

Time is up to speak empty words of a final prayer,
Underneath my skin hope makes way for fear

Appearance of the end
Appearance of the end
Tomorrow dies today
Tomorrow dies today

Circles of sorrow are cutting deeply in my face
Dissolve in tears, I recognize this fate

For fear! Appearance of the end
For fear! Appearance of the end
Tomorrow dies today
Tomorrow dies today
