The end of days in this blue reservation
A million corpses blast into outer space
All the pieces of human population
Are frozen space debris
From a seemingly intact place

This is the sound of the last trombone!
Houston can you hear it?
This is the sound of the last trombone!
Houston can you hear it?

Fly where angels die
Fly where angels die

All is lost in this cold tranquility
Who is out there to save our souls?

Fly where angels die
Fly where angels die

This is the sound of the last trombone!
Houston can you hear it?
This is the sound of the last trombone!
Houston can you hear it?
