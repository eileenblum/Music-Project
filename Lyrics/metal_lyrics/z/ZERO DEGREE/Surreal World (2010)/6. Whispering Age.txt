In a world, in a time as young planet grew
Fire and ice created the surface
Of the blue isle in the sky

In a world, in a time, in a whispering age
Demons and gods fought for the rule
In between the tidal of times

Surging waves shaped the continental shelf
Tectonic movements made the ground tremble
