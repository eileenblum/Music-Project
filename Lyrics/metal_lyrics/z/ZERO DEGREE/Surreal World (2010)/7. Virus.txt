You seem to be so innocent. You infiltrate secretly
Against all odds, you'll never be killed
You were the first of all beings and not god!

So we passed into eternity
We shouldn't fall asleep
When we would look behind the mask

Dead end, it runs the wrong direction
Your vortex drags all into a dead end
The world suffers from infection
Sentenced to death

We gave you a thousand names
A thousand synonyms for death
You infect the world
You have so many faces, a wide range of shapes
You burn down fragile system

So we passed into eternity
We shouldn't fall asleep
When we would look behind the mask

Dead end, it runs the wrong direction
Your vortex drags all into a dead end
The world suffers from infection
Sentenced to death
