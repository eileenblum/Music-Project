Should I hate in order to feel love?
Should I first sin in order to become a saint?

Your world is a dream and I stand in between
Your carnival of vanity
You're burning down the eternal flame and
Wash away the falling rain

Must I cheat in order to win the game?
Must I first lie in order to keep the truth?

Your world is a dream and I stand in between
Your carnival of vanity
You're burning down the eternal flame and
Wash away the falling rain

Slap my face in love again. Save my pain from
Healing reign
Hide me in a stolen laugh, don't share with me
The grapes of wrath.

Must I remember in order to forget?
Must I fade away in order to rise again?

Your world is a dream and I stand in between
Your carnival of vanity
You're burning down the eternal flame and
Wash away the falling rain

Slap my face in love again. Save my pain from
Healing reign
Hide me in a stolen laugh, don't share with me
The grapes of wrath.
