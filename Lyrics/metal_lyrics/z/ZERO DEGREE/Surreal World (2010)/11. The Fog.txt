When the night is falling
And the land is dark
Gentle it seems to be

Feel he's creeping and crawling
Feel he's creeping and crawling

No one turns on a light, be paralyzed
Be frozen tonight
No one turns on a light, be paralyzed
Be frozen tonight

Lost in the darkness, inevitable fate
Being haunted by a million screams 


Feel he's creeping and crawling
Feel he's creeping and crawling

No one turns on a light, be paralyzed
Be frozen tonight
No one turns on a light, be paralyzed
Be frozen tonight

Deep tone violent sound
Faces hit onto the ground
When the fog comes over
As night becomes the day
Has swept it all away
And the haunting is over
