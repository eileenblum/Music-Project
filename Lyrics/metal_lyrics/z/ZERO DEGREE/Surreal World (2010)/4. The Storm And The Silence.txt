Hey sailor, pay attention
Be careful, all along the night
The cyclone is lusting for supper
And there is no turning back forever,
From the deep blue tomb

So suddenly all goes quiet

And now do you wonder why, you only feel in the eye,
The storm and the silence
And now do you wonder why, you only feel in the eye,
The storm

Hey helmsman, set course and hold out
Keep off the jagged rocks
And keep off the shallow
Locate the fire on the horizon
Because there is no turning back forever
From the deep blue tomb

So suddenly all goes quiet

And now do you wonder why, you only feel in the eye,
The storm and the silence
And now do you wonder why, you only feel in the eye,
The storm

Hey sailor, light your pipe
And spin a yarn all along the night
Tell me about the cyclone is lusting for supper
And your return from the darkness
Of the deep blue tomb

And now do you wonder why, you only feel in the eye,
The storm and the silence
And now do you wonder why, you only feel in the eye,
The storm
