Among the ruins of R'lyeh
Devoured by the ocean depths
Lying dormant for centuries
Trapped under ice in eternal sleep...

Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn!

Through nightmarish visions
Invading human minds
Confined to cold realm
One day he will rise!

Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn!

Arise! Cthulhu!
Arise! Ye Old One!
Arise! Cthulhu!
Arise! Ye Old One!

That is not dead which can eternal lie.
And with strange aeons even death may die.

Beyond the threshold
of cold reality
In his house at R'lyeah
dead Cthulhu waits dreaming
Through nightmarish visions
Invading human minds
Confined to cold realm
One day he will rise!
