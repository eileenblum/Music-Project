Adonai!
Cleanse me from sin
So I shall be born again
Before... the Last Judgement!

Satan!
Lucifer!
Abaddon!
Bow before your God!

In the days
When Son of Man comes in His Glory
The sheep shall be separated from goats
And I shall inherit the world!

And I saw
A great white throne in the Holy See
The dead alive standing before him
Waiting to be judged with the Book of Life

"Depart from Me, you cursed,
into the everlasting fire
prepared for the devil and his angels;
for I was hungry and you gave Me no food,
I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink".
