Father!
Anoint me with the royal flames
Of hell
And crown me before the ascent

So I witness the dawn of man

And I shall inherit the Earth

I infect their souls with the plague of Christ
Reading through the pages from The Book of Lies
I fornicate with the whores of Babylon
Defiling their virgin wombs until they...
Die!

Mother!
Forgive my wicked, wicked ways
Torment
Me no more with sinful yesterdays

So I fly with angels again

And I shall invert the descent
