Aw mommy, it's so nice out today
Mommy, wh...why's the sky getting so dark?
And these bees...the bees! 
By the light of disciples I beckon thee
By the light of disciples I summon thee

Led into normality
Bred into monotony
Follow, regret
Follow, regret
Follow, regret
Follow
Brainless, ignorant
Incompetence
Follow, regret
Follow, regret
Follow, regret
Follow

Why draw away from the herd?
Do what you're sold
Served up pablum on the sly
Greet us child
This is the way
