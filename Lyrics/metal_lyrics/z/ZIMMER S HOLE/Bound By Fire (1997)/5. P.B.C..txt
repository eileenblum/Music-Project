Walking down the hallway
She couldn't believe her eyes
The guests were all enlightened
And the cheer raised up "Surprise!"
Standing in the doorway
Plain for all to see
Blushing in her birthday suit
Lingerie by skippy
Here kitty

Surprise it's your birthday
We did it just for fun
But you've got your own gift
A scratchy little tongue
Try to run away
But your secrets free
Blushing in your birthday suit
Lingerie by skippy
Here kitty
Kitty kitty
