He's got a monkey in a blue suit
That drives his cadillac
Everyone's in his back pocket
Things are right on track

It's gay... so gay

He's a legend of the black and white
Duke of the open road
He'll write you a ticket
Then, gonna drink his load

It's gay... so gay

All i see is full submission, broken will,
Don't even try
Cave into a pre-planned future,
Little pigeon, hear you cry

He's got a legion in the mid-west
Hangin' off his every word
They're slurpin' up the piss
They're gobblin' the turd

You're gonna get the bung rush
While you're going down
You're gonna "stand and accept it"
In mario's world of brown
On more battle i am fighting
To hold back the tide
Must unleash the pressure building
Golden torrents from inside
