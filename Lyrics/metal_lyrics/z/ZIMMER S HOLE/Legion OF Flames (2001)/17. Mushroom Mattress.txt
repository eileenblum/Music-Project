The stench... it's mushroom mattress
He sleeps alone... it's mushroom mattress

Come... receive communion
With drops of gold...
You are blessed

The stench... it's mushroom mattress
He sleeps alone... it's mushroom mattress

Bladder empties on the mattress

Rubber sheets can't hold the tide
Irregation in the hallway...
No flood can drown his pride
Consume one thousand pints
Capped off with shots of rye
The lorde can't find the toilet...
His mattress won't stay dry...
