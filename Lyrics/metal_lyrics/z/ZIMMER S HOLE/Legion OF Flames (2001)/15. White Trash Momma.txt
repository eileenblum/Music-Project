White trash heaven in your home town
I can't stand it out on the lake
Let's gather 'round the 'ol oil drum
And twist up a thumb of shake

House a kit find us fuckin' freezing
We're a little tight gotta sell some thigh
Got a degree it's a p.h.d...
It's a useless urban lie
Wanted to be a dental hygenist-didn't want
To waitress
Shoulda stayed in school now she smokes
Unwashed penis
Deep lung cough and bloody stool

White trash momma

Socially assisted anally fisted
Unwashed sheets that stained with cum
Curlers in her hair yellow underwear
Burning all the garbage in the 'ol oil drum
Curlers kettles cans and curtains
They're so hurtin' she so sore
Eye dropper crack hits every mornin'
It's almost noon she has got to score

White trash momma

Raised on white bread
Trading stepped-on crack for bad head
Notice as the tracks are revealed
Her white trash fate is sealed

They didn't even see the twister comin'
The wind just whipped right out of the sky
Mom was too busy cookin'...
Mom was too busy gettin' high...
Carry...mommy...

Let's gather 'round the 'ol oil drum
It's right down by the shore...
We'll be talkin' and trading stories
'bout a white trash whore
