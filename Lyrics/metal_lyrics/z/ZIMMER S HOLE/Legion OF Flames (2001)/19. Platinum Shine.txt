Feel it..feel it don't ya?
Like a whore to the mack..feel it
Grab your ankles, frit your teeth...
Feel it don't ya?

On your knees, browning nose for
Platinum shine
These songs, once they were yours
Now they are mine

Taste some a and r cock..feel it
You got the deal, been 'round the block..
Feel it don't ya?
Trust in him, he'll make you rich..feel it
He'll turn you out' cause you're his bitch..
Feel it don't ya?
