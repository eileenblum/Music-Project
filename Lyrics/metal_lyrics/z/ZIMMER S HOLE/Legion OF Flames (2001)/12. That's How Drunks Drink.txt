Drink...
'cause that's how drunks drink
Barf on your t.v. empties off the balcony
Set all your demons free..

'cause that's how drunks drink
'cause that's how drunks drink...

Can't quite get my fill...
Pass me a pint of swill
That's right! i've got no will...
'cause that's how drunks drink...

...just one drop more...
He is so dry
I am so dry
He needs to score
...just one drop more...

...just one drop more...
You are so dry
I am so dry
You need to pour
...just one drop more...
...just one drop more...
...just one drop more...

Wake up feelin' green..coffee and
Irish cream
O.j. and jim beam.. 'cause that's how
Drunks drink

Drink...drink...drink...
'cause that's how drunks drink!!

You are so dry
I am so dry
You need to score
...just one drop more...
You are so dry

I am so dry
You need to pour
...just one more...
