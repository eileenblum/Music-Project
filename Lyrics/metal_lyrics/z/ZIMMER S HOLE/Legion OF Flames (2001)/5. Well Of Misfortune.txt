Descend eternally, a passage of regret
Only now the rush of wind, a tunnel infinite...
A vacuum suffocates, to hope no longer cling
Embrace the everlast, the light is vanishing...

Do not wish upon the well...
How ripe and sweet the fruit
Now a lecher of good will,
Infected and seduced

Begin the bleeding
First extend a gesture kind, now the consecrate
By thy nymph of babylon...
Resistance fades to hate

Tooth and nail i am inhaled
I fall into the well
Deeper down, i am the clown
I seem to love this hell

I can't seem to save myself
And though i have my sight
I don't choose to suffer silent
I haven't yet to fight

Descend eternally, your end has just begun...
Falling endlessly, a well of misfortune...
