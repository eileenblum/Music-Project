Night as well go for a soda
We're done with the bone-saw
We're done with the knives...
It's a good 'ol time if you don't mind the smell
And you don't mind the flies...
We're done with your body, we're done
With the corpse
And we plucked out the eyes...
We're hangin' with dahlmer,
We're usin' his oven
We're roastin' your thighs...

Night as well go for a sodominazz..

You got to get it together
You bring the wine...
We'll bring the weather
We have'nt come to be clever
Let's make it now or this could be never...

We're gonna sodomataze ya tonite..
We're gonna sodomanize ya all nite..
Sodomatazz
Sodomatazz
Down on your knees, let's see your ass..ass..ass..

Now that it's come to a showdown
We won't allow a second to slow down
The moment has come to deliver
You as the taker.. we as the giver
