The Devil Wins

All I hear is the whisper, it's deafening
Can't resist, not worth fighting my lower brain
Once more I'm drawn in blindly, she calls again

The blackest of holes, will swallow your soul
And blood will flow from the Devil's Mouth
The Devil's Mouth

You always want what you haven't got
It's all the same
And when you get there, it ain't what you thought
That's the game

The blackest of holes will swallow your soul
When you're down south, it's the Devil's Mouth, son The Devil's Mouth

Beware the Whisper

In and out it's an endless cycle, she owns your soul
Kneel before your lord and master and serve the Hole

The blackest of holes will swallow your soul
And blood will flow from the Devil's Mouth
The Devil's Mouth

Beware the Mouth for it will swallow you whole
