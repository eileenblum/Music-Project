In my youth, I learned the Truth, PURE METAL was the only way
Glam rock can suck a cock, it's strictly for the closet gay
Burning bright, my wheels ignite, burning to the other side
Exodus was fucking right, ALL THE POSEURS MUST DIE!

When you were Shouting at the Devil
We were In League...

Drink and fight, every night, take your women away
Embrace the dark and leave your mark, you know there's hell to pay
We live proud and love it loud, you wish you were one of the 'Crue'
Worship your transvestite gods, my sword will run you through!

When you were Shouting at the Devil
We were In League...
When you were Shouting at the Devil
We were In League...

With Satan

In the pit of shadows blows the wind of stench
Familiar to those who know...
