Enter into my domain
All I offer, lies and pain
Turning decent into swine
Mothers milk into wine
Be the wolf that culls the weak
Monster walks among the sheep
Turn young girls to Jezebels
Seething harlots straight from hell

What's my name...Evil!

Lust for life you can't relieve
The years you've spent upon your knees
Now's the time to dry your tears
I will confirm all your fears
Watch the fires burning bright
As my shadow swallows light
Flames consuming all the lies
You're nothing to me

Look to the skies and tell me what do you see?
I am the light that shines infernally
Lust for my name, my body, my mind, my seed
You can't deny the power coming from me

Living waste so unseen
Your pitiful life is but dream
Reach out to me and take my hand
I'll lead you to the Promised Land
Laughing as the Kingdom burns
All is lost, nothing learned
Legions rise to claim the earth
Witness now the dark rebirth

What's my name...Evil!
