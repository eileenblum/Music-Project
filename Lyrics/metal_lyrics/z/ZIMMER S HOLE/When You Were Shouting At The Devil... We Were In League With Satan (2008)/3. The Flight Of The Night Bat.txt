You fail, who's the Chosen One?
Flight of the Knight Bat
Greybeard, old man, carpenter's son
Flight of the Knight Bat
A demon descends from the night
He comes to take innocence
Carrying the Damned, the Bird takes flight
Flight of the Knight Bat

Oh Lord of Darkness, have you conquered the sun?
Behold, the world has come undone

I feel a breakdown
Cheeseburger breakdown
We need a breakdown
Cheeseburger Breakdown!

Impale! Who's the Chosen One?
Fallen...now rise forgotten Son
You fail, who's the Chosen One?
Behold, your world has come undone.

Fly away Little Bat...
...This Basket of Death you can't deny!
