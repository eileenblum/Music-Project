Who says there is no use for the dearly departed
Just make a fist and the party has started
Show appreciation for the dead
They never complain about giving head

Fista Corps

Fits your hand just like a glove
Now embrace that necro love
Nothing finer than rotten vagina
Oh how sweet, the rancid meat

Fista Corps

And now sweet corpse, one last caress
As I fondle a putrid breast
Now you fist bang the open vag-anus
Just kick the bucket, and we'll make ya famous

Fista Corps
