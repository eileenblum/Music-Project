Glory, defending with honour
Glory, Defenders of Truth

On steeds through pouring rain
To save the world again
And before us you may kneel
We know what's good and true
The fight for Metal is true
Your hair does not grow on my steel

Some they may stand and some they may tell
But few will rise up and claim all of hell
Swift is the steel, swing forth the blade
Our enemies fall, be only the brave

Glory, rise up from your knees!
Glory, Defenders of Truth

On steeds through pouring rain
To save Metal again
And before us you may kneel
We know what's good and true
The fight for music is true
Your hair does not grow on my steel

Into the fray, I'll die today
Not for the meek or afraid
Mighty the blade, in fire be forged
This is how heroes are made

On steeds through pouring rain
To save the world again
We need new heroes, not Vince Neil!!!
The legions and the hordes
We all will raise our swords
Your hair does not grow on my steel

Chaos is coming, it won't be long
All must bear witness, united as one
With courage we stand, only the strong
Fight for what's true
It lives within all of you...
