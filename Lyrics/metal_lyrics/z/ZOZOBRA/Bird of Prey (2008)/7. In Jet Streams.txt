The taste of blood
Calming nerves
It rains in red
Drown in the color

Endless are the tidal waves

The swarms approach
Too fast for time
They seek the mother
Attack or die

Endless are the tidal waves

It screams in jet streams
Fading away
In skies in dark skies
Rise the flames

In streams in jet streams
___
In skies in dark skies
Rise the waves

Endless are the tidal waves
