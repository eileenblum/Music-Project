So how low down will you sink
Heavy with shadows

Watched you slow
Quick with your __
Turning to swallow

Swine
I'll stab your eyes
You crossed that line

Swine
God damn those eyes
You crossed that line

But you slowed
___
Eating the marrow

Let you choke
Begging for breath
While you __ tonight

Swine
I'll stab your eyes
You crossed that line

Swine
God damn those eyes
You crossed that line

Now you will burn into smoke again
