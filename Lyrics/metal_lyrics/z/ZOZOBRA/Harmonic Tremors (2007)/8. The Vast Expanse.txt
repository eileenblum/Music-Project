Life here is air
Still far too cold to breathe
Helpless being
Swimming so endlessly
Dreaming of suns
Melting this mile of ice
What was once ours
In arctic and darker nights
Now is frozen still
Like a falling star
Will it warm again?
Lifeless dead hearts
Sink into my skin
And lift me up to god again
