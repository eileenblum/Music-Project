She comes in waves.
When we crash, we break
Head floats away and swells
Just like an ocean
Are we hollow? Gone when winds blow
If it dies alone, can I call it my own?
Soaked to the bone,
My heaven has descended
I've seen deadly but beautiful catastrophes
Will she die or just asphyxiate?
As the waters swallow us whole
Will an angel come again?
No more demons screaming loud
As the waters swallows us
Liquid fill empty lung
Shadow eye seething teeth
Biting off poison tongues
Hypnotized into sleep
