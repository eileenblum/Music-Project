Burn in a cloud
Burning in the sky
All melting eyes still seek the fire
No melting eyes have found the flame
Hover and shine on days
High above holy lights
Seep slowly dead weight
Singing a prayer and song
Heavy with crushing tone
The words lost, still gone.
Ears that are filled with blood
Are deaf to the sounds of life
Scream loud now, Shine on.
Dead weight
Seep slow
High above holy lights
Hover and shine on days
