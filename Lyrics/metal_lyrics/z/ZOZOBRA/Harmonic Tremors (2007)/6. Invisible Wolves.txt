Gently swaying giants
Suspended in air
No halo floats without
The strings tied to it's god
Conducting choirs
Unleashing death floods
The harps that resonate his halls
Are heard from earth again
Souls that never rest
Carry on the wind
Leaving messages
Scattered in the sky
So block the gorgeous views
And mask the murders
They swallow every word
That's whispered under breath
It's too late, We're all dead
Drown the sorrow
Came crashing, Came crashing
Down in flames
Your planets only curse
Storms that die at kingdom's gates
Are storms that simply never came
