Wade to me
Chasing those rising suns
That burned you lightly
On those wings and arms
Still voiding memories of hollow times
When stunning sensors led me seeing blind
Still heart sinks low
When you shine blinding glow
Its precious hailing white shower stars
Extinguish in waters the flaming spark
Its dying light wants our floating souls
She sees its beauty, I just hear its drone
