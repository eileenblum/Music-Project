In visions of scattering light rays
Reflections of fire ascend to higher realm
Void all vicious rampant disease
Rendering completely to the pristine horizon

We were born in a blaze
Not a fire
Not a single flame
And that is where we will die

Exploding in glorious death forms
Tethered to a vow ropes show their fray
Despoil carnage evil wraith
Severing the wings white
With feathers red with blood

We were born in a blaze
Not a fire
Not a single flame
And that is where we will die

I'm all through serenading
That all died with our past
Emerge from under oceans
With your knife still in my back
