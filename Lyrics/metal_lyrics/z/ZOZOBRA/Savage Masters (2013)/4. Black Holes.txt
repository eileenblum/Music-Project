Claws
Embedded in flesh
Our eagles scream with endless wind
Alive
In the midst of ruin
One million light years
One million lives

I'm not build to win this war

My soul
Bleed out black holes
Seeps through skin leather and dead
The virus
The poison liquid
Acid rain cries angry god

I'm not build to win this war

My shield
Iron and heavy
Spider webbed it's shattered glass
The ghost
Forever haunting
It's killing me
It's killing me
