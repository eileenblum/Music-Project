If I escape from this killer's claws
Drain all her blood it has fed my desire
The savagery is such a part of me
Unleash a clone to evade hellish fires

Drift with ease into the sedative
Elevate all of my senses
Screaming heart left defenseless
Offer my seed to her sword

How I conform in shades and in storms
Drink from her rain when it's burning and acid
I'm under the light I'm swallowed and tranquil
Demon revealed when its skin mask was melted

Drift with ease into the sedative
Elevate all of my senses
Screaming heart left defenseless
Offer my seed to her sword

This is
The cruelest cut
Defeat
Lies in her cusp
