Drawn
Out of a grave into the sun
Death became us when we ran with demons
Try to escape
Imminent fate
Swallowed by deep
Envious greed
Raining fire from red skies

Evil visions
Evil Eyes
Deadly phantom
We deny

Summon
Visitant wraith heathenness manes
Fear our spirit's dark infection
Rattle his chains
Blacken your eyes
Murderous sounds
Bleed from your mouth
Melting faces off of skulls

Evil visions
Evil eyes
Deadly phantom
We deny

Vanish profane heretic
Specters swarm from spirit worlds
Deathless
