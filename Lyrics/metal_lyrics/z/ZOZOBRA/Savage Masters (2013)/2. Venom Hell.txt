Cold heart surrenders
Frozen still from siege
Vein swells venom hell
Poison pain from her teeth
Those wretched snakes
Hypnotizing my queen
They dragged her down into their den
And lulled her off to sleep

The pain the flight
The death the life
And then the love

Arrows of honor
Grasp in the eagle's claw
Snakes flee shadow wings
His prey they have become
Flight spans for miles
Cover cloud hidden light
Black our eroding earth
Battle anthems cry

The pain the flight
The death the life
and then the love

Those wretched snakes
The vile swine
Swells venom hell
On arrows
