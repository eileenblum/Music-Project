How long have I been laying here? How long have I been right here? I'm tired of being asleep. I'm too fucking strong to feel this weak. I'm shedding the deadness, clot corners my mouth. I'll rip my lips off all the way if I must. Crust cracking, blood leaks to grease up the rust. Thoughts switching off to give feeling the trust. Push up through wood, then soil, then grass. Gasp as I reach for the light... Undead. Burn bright.
