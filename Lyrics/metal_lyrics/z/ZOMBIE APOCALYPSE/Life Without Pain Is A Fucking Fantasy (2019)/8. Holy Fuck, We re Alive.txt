Holy fuck. What's in my veins? The fresh air, the concrete, the bloody hair, but I grin all the same. Kept from the light. Dwelled with the dead. Ate broken bread with the reaper, held his hand convinced I'd never see the light again. Seduced, embraced, by the darkness. I failed, I fell behind. A maze in my mind. A fucking lie. Holy fuck, you're alive just like me. We won't live forever; life without pain is a fucking fantasy. So hear the distant screams at night keeping that spark of life. Grinding their cutlasses, steeling their gazes, guarding the night. Doing what they think is right. Come with me, it's gonna be alright
