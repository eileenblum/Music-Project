Breathe in. Breathe out. Fix your gaze, be the mountain. Shed the shadows of doubt. We are the storm and the stillness. We forge the fetters, the chains, and the monogrammed cuffs. Covet whispers of fear like treasure. But like love, there's never enough. Signs of life or a phantom. Long lost friend, just a scarecrow. Raise me up from of the shadows. Make the blood bring red warmth back to my face. Reanimate me. Truth scrawled into my face. Undying, reanimated grace. Breathe in. Breathe out.
