Dig deep until the air starts to cool. Dig until the sunlight above you seems far, far away. Panic grab anything you can. Prepare to know that you're unprepared. Dig for your life, but your bones are tar; you won't get very far. Me and the soil got a relationship. We know the truth: We're gonna die. We're gonna die if I... I can't control it so I think I'm gonna die, and... We can't agree so I think we're gonna die, and... I can't control it so I think I'm gonna die. We're all gonna die. We're dead. Doomed at each turn. Perpetually post-traumatic, anxiety is automatic. Dig deep. It's the end but maybe not the last time. A heated dispute with the groundskeeper, but it's not up to him who gets interred. Dig deeper, I swear it's right here until it's not and hope disappears. Losing to liars, black marketeers feeding on fear. Doomed at each turn. Perpetually post-traumatic, anxiety is automatic. Dig deep. It's the end but maybe not the last time. Under your fingernails, the promise of one more chance to live life before you die.
