Racing heart can't keep pace with my rage. I'm trying, I'm trying, don't want to shake the cage. I'm trying. I'm trying, but this time I can't resist. I make a fist. I raise that fist because your open hand betrays a velvet glove that in the dark of night will pluck the life from everything I love. And never did I think that my worst fears would rise back to the top; I make a fist and raise my voice and only death can make me stop. Grains of sand on teeming shores now weaponized. I'll walk the coals with you, we will survive. Stay alive. Racing heart can't keep pace with my rage. I'm trying, I'm trying, but I reach to shake the cage. I'm trying. I'm trying but this time I can't resist. I make a fist.
