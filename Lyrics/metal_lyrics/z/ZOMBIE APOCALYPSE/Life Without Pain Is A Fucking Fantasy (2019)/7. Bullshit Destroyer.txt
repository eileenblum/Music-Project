Deceiver, blood in your mouth. Forked face eats the devout. Deceivers hidden among believers with poison tongues. Weasel words. You indefensible inhuman shield, you sound how death feels. I call you out: Your doublespeak. And doublethink. I fucking think you sift through bullshit and rethink. Corpse breath, your words are shit. I call you out: Your doublespeak. And doublethink. I call you out on all your bullshit. I fucking think you sift through bullshit and rethink.
