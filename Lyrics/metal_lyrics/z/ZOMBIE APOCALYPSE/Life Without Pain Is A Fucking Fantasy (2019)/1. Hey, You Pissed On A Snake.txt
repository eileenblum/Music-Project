Hello, meat. You are but food for worms. Keep on edge. Even when you think you are safe you wind up fucking dead. Death waits for no man. Death claims all women. Our children die. Be clever, meat: Take a leak inside. Hey, you pissed on a snake, it's a fine way to die. As fine a way to die as a rake in the brain.
