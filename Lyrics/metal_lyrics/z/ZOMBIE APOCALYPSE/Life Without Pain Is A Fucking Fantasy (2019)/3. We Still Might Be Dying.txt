Like rubble in your hands, similar to my well-laid plans, I'm here now, rebar sticking through my ribs. Caught in the blast. Stop time with our eyes. Free from the past, from the future, from waking life. One more time before we die. We stand across a stillness that we spawn; as chaos reigns love braids us so we carry on. Dig your claws into the moment. Sink your teeth. Feel the warmth run down your cheeks devouring the bittersweet. In the cacophony, hold on to me, and I'll hold on to you as we hurtle toward the sun and certain doom. But I feel a spark in you, and I know you sense the same. So make this pact with me and let's run. Two particles in the wave making stillness, even if just in a dream. But the real world is on the horizon. It's waiting for you and me.
