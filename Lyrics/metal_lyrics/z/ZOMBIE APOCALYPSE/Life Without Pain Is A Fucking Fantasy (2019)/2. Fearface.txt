Ladies and gentleman, cast your eyes before you. I present a sight grotesque and full of fear. It is a warning, this is a warning, the only one Iâll give you. Steel your gaze, drop your jaw, make a fist as your nightmares all come true. The night is long. So try to wake. The night is long. Just how much more can you take? And as the veil drops to the floor revealing (Oh my god, no!) the very creature that has stalked you all your life (I gotta get away!). Feeding and reveling in your pain and fear and worry (Get away!)... Stealing the night. Darken the day. Blocking the sun. Killing the light. Presenting now, without delay: The reflection you see every day.
