No one's coming for us, we're on our own. No one's coming to help, we are alone. Press. And press. And press. Madness for death. But madness, madness is walking death. Worse than death. Let your ego reign as the stones pile up. No real world pain can replace what you've lost. The void in your chest has grown so dark. Another stone please, the heartbreak is too much to bear. Press. And press. And press. Madness for death.
