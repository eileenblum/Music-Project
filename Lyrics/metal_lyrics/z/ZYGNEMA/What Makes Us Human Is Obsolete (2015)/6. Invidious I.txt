Extensions, lesions, broken down my pieces are shattered â contorted.
Concealed in prejudice.
I am despised â corroded by your hatred.
Invidious is the existence of me.

My name, unspoken out loud.
Fear whispers objection â rejected.
Crawl up a spine. Your hideous mind.
Obscene â the nature.
Perpetual â the only.
Twists and turns of emotionless dance.

Lying impatient,
But look at them all pretentious fucks.
Disguised angel tinted your demons with a golden shrine.
Obscure inside. I am your blasphemy, undenied.
Inveigler â corrupted.
I am the lord of your heinous crimes.

I have cut myself into the consequence of my past â exposed, judged.
Concluded by denial of reality.
An emotional trajectory â misguided â situations of life.

My name, unspoken out loud.
Fear, whispers, objections â rejected.
Crawl up a spine. Your hideous mind.
Obscene â the nature.
Perpetual â the only.
Twists and turns of emotionless dance.
I am despised.
Invidious I.

We are the ghosts of our own decisions.
