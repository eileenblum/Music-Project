[feat. Sunneith Revankar]No. Do you know? Do they know? No.
Which one is it? Mine? Mine or yours?
The essence of a man that they think they know.
Whatâs inside? They never will but neither will I.

The nature of the change we know
Is that it is and that it does.
You see the silhouette. Do you see it now?
What do you think it stands against?
No form. No name. No give. Nothing.
The light that shines so fearless brings
Nothing to the nothing that is him.

Stay close to the spawn of confidence.
Eyes that speak the words of a thousand tongues.
Stay close to the spawn of confidence.
Eyes that speak the words of a thousand tongues.

Become the change you want to see (in yourself)
Become the change you want to be (be yourself)

Become the change you want to see.
Become the change you want to be.

[Solo]

Do you know? Do you?
Do they know? Do they?
Which one is mine? Do you know which one is mine?
Nothing to the nothing. Nothing to the nothing that is him.

Become the change you want to see.
Become the change you want to be.
Become the change you want to see.
Become the change you cannot be.
