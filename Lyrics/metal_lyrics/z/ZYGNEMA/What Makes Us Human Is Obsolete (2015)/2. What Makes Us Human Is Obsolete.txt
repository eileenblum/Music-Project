We are falling to the ultimate depths of desperation and greed.
Losing ourselves in the search for perfection and need.
Damn the seed â hypocrisy. Humanity is all we need.
But what we give is decay

This is a rise or bacterial fashion
Predetorial race of constant modification
Your deeds are in question.
Pathetic attempts of systematic desecration
Altering what surrounds us
Destroying what defines us.

Man, who made his own need gave birth to a hostile breed.
Disordered, obsessive.
Like a shattered core of a soulless whore.
We were better without the need for more.

What answers are we looking for?
What weâve become? Monsters of a new era.
Broadcast â debris of your holy war.
Corrosion â altercation of cancerous spawn of man.

Annihilate the course. But the cause of hate still remains.
Pacify the burnt. But the scars of hate still remain.
What makes us human is obsolete

[Solo]

Integrity and honour have not just been lost.
Theyâve got to be forgotten
And weâve lost ourselves beyond reconciliation.
Weâve lost ourselves.
Into the transition of a permanent effect.

We are who we are now.
A self delusional progress of ourselves.
We are who we are now.
A certain curse of wreck for the rest.

What makes us
human
is
obsolete
