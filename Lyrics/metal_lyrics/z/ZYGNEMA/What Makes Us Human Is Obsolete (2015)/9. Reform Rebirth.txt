Promises â void. And a clouded mind.
Forced to embrace a non existing truth.
Misguided â the child. A soldier misled.
How effortlessly can a human turn brute?
They told him he was the chosen one
A reason of existence. Devout.
Walk this path â be invincible.
Another immolation. Without fire.

Grey is the colour of his skin. His skin, his name in honour â engraved in red.
To preserve the integrity of a pseudo-empire
A martyr, a legend.

Breed of thoughtless pillagers live to heave...
The hate without need for knowing.
Born to kill; in a plastic way of life to escalate dread and sorrow.
When guns and grenades replaced dolls and toy cars
Emotions became a disgorge of distrust.
This is the riot of disorder, mars the foundation of compassion. Empathy.
Follow the undeserving, unforgiving throne in a crude belonging.

Disowned by his own, consumed by qualms.
He bemoans his fate to god.
A futile war deteriorates an anguished man
Forbidden for selfish reason, a chivalrous burial denied
Reform by deformation into a hateful abomination.
Brainwashed by birth, to sacrifice for blood
Another human lost, another monster born

Chauvinistic ejaculate, a gruesome disaster...
Could get the gods dejected, if they existed.
Awarded for kills and praised with glory for genocide
His blades of honor tainted with the screams of bodiless heads.
His gazeless gaze portrays a mind thatâs never known how to feel
