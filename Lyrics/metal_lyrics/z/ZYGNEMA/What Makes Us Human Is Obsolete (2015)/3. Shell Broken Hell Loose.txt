Follow his vice, unruly bastard.
No direction, blinded device.
Spoken words â unbelieved.
Your pride is sick

Itâs a murder â my thoughts diseased.
My defiance has been ignored.
Deceiving a wise corrupt.
My sweat will fucking yield.

I donât need no friends to make my cure.
Yeah, through shaken hands.
tears will flood your house, your veins;
Your town has broken down.
It never ends. Itâll never end

You are the heart of religious malice.
Strengthened fraud on weakened cry.
Mastered a fake demise.
Iâm alive.

You werenât a god. A glaring error.
My defiance has been ignored.
I wonât rest. You glory-hole bitch.
Your pride is fucking sick
I donât need no friends to make my cure.
Yeah, through shaken hands.

Scriptures that breed you peace.
An evil clan conspires.
It never ends. Itâll never end.

All my days are over.
To know Iâve been living a lie
Silence â proclaimed.
Abrasive aggression.
Iâm qualified to explode.
Iâve been made, never again.

Broken down. The shell has
Iâll tackle you with an iron fist
I am certain.
Youâre bold. But Iâll crush you.
Shell broken, hell loose.

You canât bring me down.
Iâm already lost.
Out of my own bounds.
Broken days inside.
All this never ends.
Never ending pain.
I still contemplate
If youâre worth the fight.
