[Solo]

Hatred in my eyes, you canât stop that feeling.
Virtue of the lies left a stigma in me.
Trauma in my mind, blood black dead inside me.
Lying all alone, you donât know where I belong.

Tears, cry, breathe and endure.
Scream, pain, grieve and move on.

Iâve been wandering, thereâs no destination.
Lied to live a lie, immature delusion.
Run through droughts of time, heart demands discretion.
Fighting hollow spheres, Iâve been dying to be strong.

Tears, cry, breathe and endure.
Scream, pain, grieve and move on.
Tears, cry, breathe and endure.
Scream, pain, grieve and move on.

Night, darkest in me.
You donât believe this side of me.

All of my pain, living in isolated state.

You canât hear me, feel my screams.
I am within, I am you.
