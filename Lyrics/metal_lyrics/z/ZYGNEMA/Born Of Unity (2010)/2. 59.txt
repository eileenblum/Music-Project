Youâre half as empty as your shit fuck stand, you stand for money, power and a cheap-ass fuck.
Promises rely on premature plans, your clutches so weak you canât stand your ground.
Instead of making the right of wrong, you play your blame game when crisis strikes.
You build hate amongst our race into our fucking land behind our face.

Stabbing the back of your brothers, your people; your selfish survival, your game of lies
Conning the innocent on racial beliefs and give rise to them: new born enemies.

Who Gives A Fuck?

Hollow hopes is your insight, you give us all the shit till your votes are wide.
Hypocrisy is your political right, fucking scum motherfuckers, an infection inside.
Your strategies for ministerial berths, dishonest and deceptive, your allies so sore.
You call our land as the mother of all and treat her like a whore.

Fight for the right, for our rights, for our lives, you cannot run the nation so FUCK YOU!!
You've got the nerves to exploit all the ones who rely on your bullshit plays.

Who Gives A Fuck?

We Give A Fuck.
We Give A Fuck.
We Give A Fuck.

We Give A Fuck.
We Give A Fuck.
We Give A Fuck.

Taking back my time I lost what I had to realize
Feeling this emptiness because of somebody else
Stop, lies, cries, deceit
You are the ones who would see us burn and die

Steal all our souls and fuck sell it at a cheap price
Fake sign of lotus, the hand of corruption
Stop, lies, cries, deceit
You are the ones who would see us burn and die
