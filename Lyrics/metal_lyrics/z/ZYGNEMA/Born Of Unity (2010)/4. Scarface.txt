Canât stop this raging aggression
Canât stop this strong revolution
When you had to enact, you didnât wait for me

Canât stop this fire for freedom
Itâs time to burn down your kingdom
What a lie had I lived, now itâs time for change.

What we do, is what we believe in
What we do, is what we believe in

What we do, is what we believe in
What we do, is what we believe in

One song bring all alliance
One thought rage broken silence
Weâre the force that is one, we fight no blame

All cries no justification
All fists we fight for retention
This is it, this is now, we fight no blame

What we do, is what we believe in
What we do, is what we believe in

What we do, is what we believe in
What we do, is what we believe in

I believe in fighting back for my name
Strong, uphold rage, in spite of being hollow
And Iâm scarred
Scarred
Scarred

Scarface
