Hate the feeling - am I black or white?
Hate the truth - why fear to die
Racist fools - you fall in the face.
You're fucking wrong your stare ain't so daze

Why do you
Discriminate?
Why do you
Hate?

Why donât you spread unity amongst
Why do cry blood spills on the ground
We are all humans thatâs our only race
Then why the fuck do you discriminate

Why do you
Discriminate?
Why do you
Hate?
