Hope, hope lies denied, denied in their lies
Bifurcation of thoughts, no value for life
Destruction of good, corruption arise
Culprits play fool, innocent pay the price

Destroy all the signs
of National Deluge
Destroy all the signs
of National Disaster

Belief is used as a tool to manipulate the mass
Why do they kill in the name of god
Infants and young are murdered and raped
Hatred inside and still we see smiles.

Destroy all the signs
of National Deluge
Destroy all the signs
of National Disaster.

Hope, hope lies denied, denied in their lies
Bifurcation of thoughts, no value for life
Destruction of good, corruption arise
Culprits play fool, innocent pay the price

[Solo]

Destroy all the signs
of National Deluge
Destroy all the signs
of National Disaster.
