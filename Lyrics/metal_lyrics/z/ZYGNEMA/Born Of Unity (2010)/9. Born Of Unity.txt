You canât believe. You canât destroy me.
None can deny. You canât ignore me.
All that youâve done shall be denied now.
All that youâve built shall be destroyed now.

You seek a rise but no proceed, seekers.
That spark to build a raging fire is you.

Iâm Born of Unity.
Born of Unity.
Iâm Born of Unity.
Born of Unity.

Wake up and prove youâre not invisible.
Our ancestors fought hard for our freedom.
Are you free?
Listen to me.
This is an empire built on lies and deceit.

Bloodshed of your innocence screams a war cry.
You are the fucking new breed, take no bull shit.

Iâm Born of Unity.
Born of Unity.
Iâm Born of Unity.
Born of Unity.

Take a life and smile at the ones who are crying for.
Realizing my suffering, you donât know what Iâve been through.

Thereâs no war for peace.

Struggle â in our lives been through suffering.
Youâre not forgiven.
Fight as one cause this is a battle and we will win.

Own your existence, live your right.
Fear no self-conflict, itâs a rebellion.
