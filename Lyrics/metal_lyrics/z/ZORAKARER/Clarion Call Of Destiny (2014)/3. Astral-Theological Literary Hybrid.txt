A clear vision of mans great empire
Arises through bloodshed

Transcend into a time once lost
Buried forever beneath the realm of existence
Shrouded by the dusk of mans void
Ever pursuing the ancients.
Archaic bloodlines linked to the dawn of men

The truths of our unholy creation
The grand explosion gave birth to the stellar cosmos, unveiled

An undistorted vision of purpose

Within this arcane tome, lies the key
an unearthly knowledge of power
one true reality of the essence of souls

The ultimate fate of our universe evolves
possessing our minds
Abusing the knowledge
Using its gift to abet their supremacy
Enslaving our psyches

Fueled by a lust for power
To keep their shadowed crowns
They masquerade behind the scenes
Devouring the fruits of our labor

The truths of our unholy creation
The grand explosion gave birth to the stellar cosmos
A clear vision of mans great empire
Arises through bloodshed

To drink the blood of their greed and sin
Transforming the holy dogma
Leading the hordes of man
To the shores of hell
