hailing from out the black, from a void immeasurably vast
Like a fire in the sky to mankindâs wicked eyes

ensnaring their worlds in confusion, hysteria and fear en mass
Many a realm and race laid waste throughout the aeons of time

Fear will conquer the hearts of man
Their wretched flesh unchained from the earth
Humanity looks up and beholds the beast!
cast into the black

ensnaring their worlds in confusion, hysteria and fear en mass
The seas will boil crimson with blood
Tongues of flame scorching the earth
Charcoal clouds swallow the sun
our cerulean skies black as pitch

The spirit of death will consume us
The corporeal world lies diminished
Like black rays of parallel light
A pathetic husk of charred rock and ash
