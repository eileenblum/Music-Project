Succumb to me under lure of the moon,
shrouded in dreaded sorrows untrue,
dance with me in this garden of grief,
where dreams come to die

Cursed by death, prisoner in chains,
shackled in darkness I seethe, eternally

Succubus! Temptress of night!
Entrance me with your carnal gaze.

Embrace the cold tormented soul,
Acheron lies, kingdom to heathens

infernal repulsion consumed by lust, she feeds
stalking the shadows, whore of the fallen
deeds of the flesh

screams lost in the mist,
piercing pale grim skies
Cursed by death, prisoner in chains,
sealed in a tomb of decay
