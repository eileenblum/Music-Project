The hunt of eternal hunger begins with a glowing orb
Born before the shadows and time itself
Wretched in my ethereal lair
Broken by a foul odor lingering in the air

Secreting bile injections into the flesh
preserved bodies wreathed in vile webbing 
Euphoric metabolites storming the cortex
Convulsing within the throes of death

Crowned guardian, to the gates of impious deeds,
I remain damned, to this infernal parable 

Bow down in my pit of excremental disgust
Feasting on sacraments offered in greed

The hunt for eternal hunger lies cold inside me
Born before the shadows and time itself
Wretched in my sepulchral lair
I will awake when my body longs for more.
