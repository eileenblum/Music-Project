A new age begins with the lust of man
Like our fathers before us
Blood shall spill upon my blade

Bronze swords glistening
We come in droves
The lands we seek to rule
In the name of thy lord

Burnt bodies, a ritual to appease the gods
Set forth this path

We ride by dawn, shields raised high
storming the gates
I embrace the stench of death
Venomous screams pierce the shadows

A new age begins with the lust of man
Like our fathers before us
Blood shall spill upon my blade

Empires fall giving way to our infernal slaughter
Laid to waste this desolate land

Once immortal now crumbles
Chaos abound my hunger for violence

Empyrean of bloodshed we wonder the halls
Feasting upon our triumphant carnage
