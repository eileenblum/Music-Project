The conflagration
bidden forth from a dying sun
a brilliantly wreathed flame sweeping the heavens.

An empyrean holocaust.
How our glorious pillars will fall.
With a rousing call to arms
the progeny bequeth their legacy;  
oh how they vigilantly aubade their fate.

Yet we see how quickly the craven will boast
as the meek are laid to waste.
The maniacal's chains unbound.

Their spirits abhorrent 

The vultures lament  
for their coveted empires. Broken
cobble scattered with ashes
and the doleful cries. 
the righteous have fallen

The conflagration bidden forth from a dying sun
a brilliantly wreathed flame sweeping the heavens.
An empyrean holocaust.

Never the same empires fall in decay
Reaped from the core of existence
shattered to dust before the cosmos
Molecular fission combusts disintegrating
exorbitant life forms void to entrapment 
Molded to stellar magnetic paradigm
into the null quantum vacuity
