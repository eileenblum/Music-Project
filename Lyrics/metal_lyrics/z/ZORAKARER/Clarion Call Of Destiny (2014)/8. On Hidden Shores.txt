Into the darkness below the seas of despair,
lurks an evil fathomed by only a nightmare,
Awaken the fallen one,
a horror that plagues my past,
chanting forgotten hymns,
lingering beyond the veil
of vile hatred, and death

Consciously this cancer grows within me
consumed by madness this terror must reign again

From the abyss of sullen misfortunes
I have lost control once again
Twisted a struggle with my dreams
i slowly wither in my mind

Rise, bringer of misanthrope, guardian of the deep
