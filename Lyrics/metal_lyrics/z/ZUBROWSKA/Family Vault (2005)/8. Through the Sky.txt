Black Angel
drink to the source
Is there anything that
I didn't understand?
I know why the nice
persons die always the First
Now I know what's after death
The bloody saints give the
pain as a present
The bloody saints give the
pain as a beautiful present
BUT I DON'T HEAR NOTHING THROUGH THE SKY
I DON'T HEAR NOTHING THROUGH THE SKY
Void's the paradise
NO I DON'T HEAR NOTHING THROUGH THE SKY
I'VE NEVER HEARD NOTHING THROUGH THIS FUCKING SKY!
SO FUCK YOU!
I live in a grave
With 3 records of Psychobilly
And I know that this earth have never and
will never be something else that hell
So Fuck You!
Aleister Crowley
Son of Hyperboree
I'll never die
Won't reach the sky
I know what to do
To drink blood
Find blood
Find blood
Neith De Masticatione martuorum
Lord Basarab
Torquemada
Earth land of pain
This is my Flesh and my blood
God is a weakness, we trust in pain
This is my Flesh, in my blood
In pain we trust, God is a weakness
