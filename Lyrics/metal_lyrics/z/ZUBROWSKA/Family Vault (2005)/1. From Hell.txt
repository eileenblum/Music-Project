God's building work
Society of thougt London opium
Stomach ashe
Lady straddle my scalpel
know what we've in a bright chasm
Pentagram Town, your prostitute's god's
Darling, tonight she's giving birth to our
pain We're in a bright Chasm
this is a new bright night when
the blood suckles gargoils I want it to flood
The sky and bath the stars in a supreme shame
Bowel, womb, breast, liver, kidney
I am god's will power
I'm in raptures over
Some delicious keep sakes
Prince of the Princes a green stone adorn your brow
It's a reward for the strong men who dare kill the death
Who dares kill the death?
Know that we've in a bright chasm
Pentagram town, your prostitute's god's darling
Tonight she's giving birth to our pain
We're in a bright Chasm
This is a new bright night yeaah!
