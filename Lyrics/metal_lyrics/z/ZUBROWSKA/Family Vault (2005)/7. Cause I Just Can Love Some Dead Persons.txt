Sweet sky, calm night
The wind's whistling between the marble
Stare at the moon yeah stare
It's the same for everybody
Lie on the ceiling just opposite your lovely corpse
Watch my tender hands who making again this opened up Face
Because people like beautiful Faces, ties and expansive perfumes
HOW MY TENDER HANDS ARE GATHERING YOUR FLESH
MY TENDER HANDS ARE SEWING BACK YOUR FLESH
And I'm gathering and keeping your rests
So preciously, with so much love
MY TENDER HANDS ARE GATHERING YOUR FLESH
MY TENDER HANDS ARE SEWING BACK YOUR FLESH
It's so beautiful
Yesterday I've killed my parents
Will you believe me if I say
That I love them so much better and stronger now?
'CAUSE I JUST CAN LOVE SOME DEAD PERSONS
YES I JUST CAN LOVE SOME DEAD PERSONS
CAUSE IF SOMEONE'S GOOD IT'S A DEAD PERSON.
And I need so much love
Now I'm sure to know your feelings
I'll no more be afraid by what you think
I'm sure, I'll no more be afraid
GO TO HELL!
You've my lovely dear dead...
