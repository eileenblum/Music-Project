It's like a Rollinstone show
Play 4 money
Swindle switch off the light 4 superstars
NO GRANDDADS
NO DADIES
NO superstars
Yeah we've got out passion we've got our Friends
We fuck your rules
And just kick out the jam
Can I go to the toilet Mr Manager?
is it good for my image?
Never speak to the organizers
Prostitute your music
When you play your songs in Front of me
I don't Forget you're my older
I have to respect
You have the same duty so
Fucking move your rythms at least
For 10 thousands Dollars
It's so hard to play for sucha little pay...
You should remember
The good past time (when you paid to play)
HAAAA!!!
Moving to the rythm
We always spit our lungs
On the rythm
We spit our guts
MOVING TO THE RYTHM!
PAY TO PLAY
