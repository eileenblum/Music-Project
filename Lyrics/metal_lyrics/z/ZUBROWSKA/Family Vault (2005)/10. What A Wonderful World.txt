Oh my dear when you've here, I feel my heart
beating like a dove ready to be sacrificed
in pain's direction
I'll never be broken
don't have to yeld to necessity
When the great pig will eat the sun
What a wonderful world
When the stone replaces heart
The great pig will eat the sun
So what a wonderful world
