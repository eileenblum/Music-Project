Through Carnage we shall suffer.

From Town to Town, from Land to Land.
From young to old, they still unfold.

From Life to Death, from Death to Life.
As Pain slowly withers, A new Massacre has begun.

Within Carnage all shall dwell.
Of Life and something between.

Their Race against Man.
Transform every Human being.
They show no Mercy, neither you beg.

Of Death and something between.

Dead Eyes are haunting you and kisses are replaced with bites.
More and more, A Human nevermore.

Hook in Mouth.
Pitchfork rammed in Face.
Something hit your Shoulder and bites in your Neck.
Hammer smashed your Feet and you crawl desperatly.
There is no Way back out of this Misery.

Welcome Misery.
Welcome Bloodrain.
Welcome Misery.
Welcome Bloodrain.
Welcome Misery.
Welcome Bloodrain.
Welcome Misery.
Welcome Bloodrain.
Welcome Misery.
Welcome Bloodrain.
Welcome Misery.
Welcome Bloodrain.
