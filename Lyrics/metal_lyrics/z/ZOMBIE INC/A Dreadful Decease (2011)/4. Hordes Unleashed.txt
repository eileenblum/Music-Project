There are many ways to die.
And to walk through Serpent Gates.

You're dead, with an opened Chest.
Butchered like all Witches long time ago.
Slaughtered from ripping Hands.
They will rise and we shall fall.

Break your Bones before they choke.
Tear out your Eyes with Fingernails.

A rotten Mob in cannibal Misery.
No more time for Noah's Arc.
The Hordes unleashed in insanity.
And they eat like there is no tomorrow.
Out of their Graves they are crawling.
To transform our Heaven to Hell.
To mutilate our Dear's, eat our Mother's Throat.
And rape our Children with broken Bones.

There are many ways to die.
And to walk through Serpent Gates.
Break your Bones before they choke.
Tear out your Eyes with Fingernails.
