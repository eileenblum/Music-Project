Pluck out your precious Eyes and eat them.
Scratch your Teethridge with dirty Knifes.
Experiments with A sick Mind, A carrion Kind.
Explosion made dark Visions come true.

Awoken... from Coffins, seeking Flesh.
Before you scream... Your Throat will be eaten.

Bloodbath, severed Flesh and chopped up Bones.
Hordes of living Dead are walking through.
Pitchfork rammed in your Throat.
Knifes plunge in your Body.
Blood flows down your Feet.

Awoken... from Coffins, seeking Flesh.
Before you scream... Your Throat will be eaten.
They are rising up...  from Coffins, seeking Flesh.
Blood will flow... As the Undead walk the Earth

The Soulless is mine.
I am the Dawn of all unknown.
The Sickness is mine.
Blood seeps from your Wounds.

Burn the Cross, there is no need for it.
Sickening Worlds now entwine the darkest Goat.
Embrace yourself within Damnation.
Smell the putrid Stench of the mangled Flesh.
