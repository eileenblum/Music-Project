A Lust for Flesh.
A Greed for Human Trash.

Suck the Bones, Ten Jaws for one.
Stone-dead Body steps A darkened Dance.
A damned Crowd is choking with Desire.
And your Flesh will burn in Fire.

At Dawn the Day is already lost.
A Payday for our Sins.

A Heresy in Flesh and Blood.
Crawling out of Cemetaries.
A Vile Stench of Worms.
Which eat your Flesh with Greed.

Horror fills this hollow Earth.
It's our Death and their Rebirth.

Welcome the butchery of Netherworld.
The dying Brigades conquer.
Ten Ghosts despise Ten Serpent Lies.
As the World turns dead.

Horror fills this hollow Earth.
It's our Death and their Rebirth.
