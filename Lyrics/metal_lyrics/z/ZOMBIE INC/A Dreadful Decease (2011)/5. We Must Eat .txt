Cold Whispers in wait.
The rising of the Dead.
Hide wherever you think.
But you will be eaten.

Your Skin will be ripped off your Flesh.
Bastard, enjoy your own torture.
Your Guts will be torn apart.
Until you crawl on your fucking Bones.

The Organs will be eaten slowly.
They make A Soup of your Eyes.
Carve your Flesh and eat your Nipples.
Spit it out and eat it again.
Suffocate in your own Blood and walk with them.
The hunting has begun!
The killing has begun.

Now we joined the Legion of the Infected!
We must eat!
Now we joined the Legion of the Undead!
We must eat!

We must eat!
