Dead Bodies now walk the Earth.
Why did the Angels lie to me?

This must be something brutal.
Deranged and mangled Bodies.
Awoke through gruesome Carnage.
The Challenge of the Undead.

A Scythe carve your Throat, Blood is spraying.
Your Feet hacked by an Axe.
Your open Eyes are injected by rotten Fingers.
Hooks tear the Skin, soon Maggots dine.

This must be something brutal.
Deranged and mangled Bodies.
Awoke through gruesome Carnage.
The Challenge of the Undead.

Head is severed, torn from your Neck.
Dismembered Limbs, Bones are left to rot.
Hordes of living Dead, peeling off your Skin.
This is the Unbecoming...

Hear the desperate Screams of Mothers watching their dying Sons.

Bones are broken, Guts are torn out.
God is now gone to an other one.

Open Eyes pierced by Needles.
Stare through the Eyes of the Dead.
An Undead Legion is marching forward.
Together we walk the Earth.

This must be something brutal.
Deranged and mangled Bodies.
Awoke through gruesome Carnage.
The Challenge of the Undead.
