Night is turning deeply black.
With crawling Shadows on the Tracks.
Inside A Building, depraving Screams.
Sounds of ripping Flesh, decaying Scenes.

No Place to hide, I run 'til my Feet are burning.
The Smell of halting Blood, ahead there's no turning.

The Deadtribe is rising, with sinister mood.
Cloned Virus Outbreak, A stinking Brood.

Days are turning deeply Black.
And Demons crawl through A Human Wreck.
Silent Whispers and lifeless Moan.
Surrounded by the Veil of Darkness.

There's no Way to escape.
In Blood and Brains they trust.
My Guts they want to rape.
And dinner with disgust.

I try to run and hide.
But they spread to fast for me.
No Chance to flee aside.
Out of this evil Killing Spree.

The Deadtribe shall rule this rotten Earth.
A sinister Brood which Satan gave it's Birth.

There's no Way to escape.
In Blood and Brains they trust.
My Guts they want to rape.
And dinner with disgust.

I try to run and hide.
But they spread to fast for me.
No Chance to flee aside.
Out of this evil Killing Spree.

Night is turning deeply black.
With crawling Shadows on the Tracks.
