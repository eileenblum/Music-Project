When Twilight deepens to Darkness an Shadows devour the Light.
Roaming through urban Canyons, hunting for Prey to bite.

No use for Possessions and no need for A Job.
Acting out Agressions for I Am with the Mob.

Side by Side walking slowly 10.000 hungry Freaks.
Septic Bones, dripping Traumas, A Chorus of Rebellion.

No use for Possessions and no need for A Job.
Acting out Agressions for I Am with the Mob.

Chaos reigns, abolish Order, A rotting Choir's Groan.
Venomous, spreading Plague, Harvest for the Dead.

When Darkness encloses the Cities and Shadows hide Distress.
Corpses roam bleak Alleys, engorging in Excess.
