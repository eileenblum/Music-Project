Bound to Rock!
We hit the Scene with Hearts devoted to Metal.
Risen up to the very Top.
Leaving the others behind.

Regrettably!
Zombie Piss, put A spoke in our Wheel.
We passed away, then transformed.
Now we are back with A Bang!

Watch out.
We'll be coming to your Town.
Get down, in your Blood you're gonna drown.
Step up and bang your Head.

We are the rocking Dead!

Born to lose.
Deceased to win, spreading our Stench of Decay.
A Maggot-Eaten, wrecking Crew.
Infesting the Masses within.

Ain't no Cure, no Remedy.
You might as well, accept your Lot.
Zombiefied, Revenants.
It won't get more Metal than that.

More fucking Metal than that.

And from the Chasm of abandoned burial Grounds.
A foul Wave of Filth gushes over the Lands.
Digging Flesh Tunnels through your Poser-Wombs.
Piercing your Organs with our Teeth.

Watch out.
We'll be coming to your Town.
Get down, in your Blood you're gonna drown.
Step up and bang your Head.

We are the rocking Dead!
