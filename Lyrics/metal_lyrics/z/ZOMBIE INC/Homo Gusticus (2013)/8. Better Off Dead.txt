Alive and well is overrated.
The Job, the Wife and all that Shit I hated...
...is gone for good and long forgotten.
No use for Soap, my Skin and Teeth are rotten.

No Morals.
No Laws.
No Sorrow.
Because...

I Am better off Undead.
I Am happier than you.

Travails and Fears became outdated.
Belief and Hope are desecrated.
Loans and savings, now obsolete.
Flesh of Man is really all I need.

The grinding of Jaws.
So fucking Joyful.
Because...

I Am better off Undead.
I Am happier than you.
I Am better off Undead.
Soon you will be Undead too.

Reaping the Flesh of Mankind.
Sowing my Seed.
Anger is my Peace of Mind.
Lust is my Creed.

No Morals.
No Laws.
True Anarchy.
Because...

I'm way better off Undead.

Fuck Life, thats right and you living Losers too.
Because Tonight I will be coming for you.
