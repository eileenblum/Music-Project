Gas from leaking Barrels.
Zombiefied the Herds.
Pray you won't get captured.
We're eating all the Nerds.

Gusting Winds from damaged Tombs.
Unfolded Fogs of putrid Fumes.
This ain't no Movie or Videogame.
Call off you Plans, we came to maim.

Gas from leaking Barrels.
Zombiefied the Herds.
Pray you won't get captured.
We're eating all the Nerds.

No Firewalls or Virus Scans.
Will Spare you from our Dinner Plans.
We'll chew our Way up to your Asses.
Consume your Mugs with Zits and Glasses.

Film Posters soiled with Blood.
X-Boxes stuck in Mud.
Action Figures soaked with Slime.
Geek Toys past their Prime.

Gas from leaking Barrels.
Zombiefied the Herds.
Pray you won't get captured.
We're eating all the Nerds.

Storming A Tavern on Seven-Star Lane.
To find more Meat and cause more Pain.
Ate the chubby Owner then his ugly Wife.
Both tasted like Shit... but hey, that's Zombie Life.
