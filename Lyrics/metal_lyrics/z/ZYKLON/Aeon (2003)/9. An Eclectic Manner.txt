Symbolical and sheeting, in an eclectic manner,
Institutional monotheism holds the banner
Martial and creed;
You think they will provide anything you need?

You reckon it's diversity?
As time passes it will turn into canonical unity
Scripture and doctrines, hollow as it must be
The sole individual yearns to be free

A constant grip on all the illustrious worlds
You can literally feel how the snake curls
Why don't take an institutional decision
And presents God's full petition?

Symbolical and sheeting, in an eclectic manner,
Institutional monotheism holds the banner
Martial and creed;
You think they will provide anything you need?


Thanks to Leviathan for correcting track ## 5, 9 lyrics.
