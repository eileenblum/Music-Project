Pictures in motion
Full-on enslavement
A world of corrosion
No real fundament
Swallow everything
Ask now man
Digest and consume
A liar in costume
Shocking and gross
Real annihilation
Sorry for your loss
Cheap rotten animation
Portray the living
I fool no one
Only fucking observe
Just don't bow down
Skinning culture alive
Living on a lie
Endangered, still breathing
Only parasites breeding
