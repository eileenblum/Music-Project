[Musick: Zamoth/ Destructhor]

The snake and the deers, corroding on the tree of the world. 
It`s your symbol of cosmos, axis-mundi. 
The downfall of the powers, representation unparalleled. 
Catastrophes of nature, battle between gods, social dissolution.

It`s a coming, a second coming. 
Stronghold of the world in ice and cold. 
Time of axe, time of sword, 
a wolf on chase, a world on fire, 
extinguished only when the land is sinking. 
Development back to chaos, it`s your illusion, 
sombody else`s disillusion. 
An alleged opposition between powers

Appearances without masks. 
No one trying to harmonize latent conflicts. 
Origin and creation, explanation of the later development. 
Cosmic model, primordial murder. 
Irreversible time, a different material foundation. 
Time is not returning, the new world will rise once and for all.
