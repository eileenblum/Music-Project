What's coming from
beyond the sea of death
it's words celebrating an eroded artery
it's a creak of gravity
to bury an internal exploded brain

What's coming from
beyond the sea of death
it's a glitter of metal
praying for vocal chords in despair
it's a lament of ghosts
shaking bleached backbones

What's coming from
beyond the sea of death
it's a mirage of an alienated future

Nobody appears yet ?
to see a newborn light shining
beyond the sea of death
