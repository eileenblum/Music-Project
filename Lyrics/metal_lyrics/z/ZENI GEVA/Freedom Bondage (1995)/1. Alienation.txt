The body is falling down by the shot of your hate
Dead body of love is falling into the abyss through the mortal wound

Becoming alienated and enlarging
Tons of filth in my flesh

My ego is growing insane in the flame of your hate
Dead body of love is screaming endlessly for the empty sky

Becoming alienated and enlarging tons of filth in my flesh
