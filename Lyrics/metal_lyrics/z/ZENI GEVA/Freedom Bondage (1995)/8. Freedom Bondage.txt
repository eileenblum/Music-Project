Chains of freedom bite my body
Blood &amp; tears of self-deceit
flow out from creaking bones
in a sealed up vacuum

I've lost the key to stop the speed of self-destruction

My brain is cursed with a poison called "freedom"
Blood &amp; tears of self-contradiction
flow out from creaking organs
Systems fall into convulsions

I've lost the key to stop the speed of self-destruction
