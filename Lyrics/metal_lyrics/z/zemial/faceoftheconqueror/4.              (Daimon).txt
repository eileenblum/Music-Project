A thousand years shall come to pass,
Yet this daemon I`ll never forget
Through riddles, burning embers and whispering leaves,
He made his shadowed presence known to me

Why? I questioned him knowing well,
Has Hypnos sent you to me?
For I awoke and broke the spell that binds mortality to me?
Vanish now! Vanish now! Vanish now!
DAIMON!

How long must I endure?
I seek for answers yet none do I get.
I seek through riddles, burning embers and whispering leaves
This time a shadow in the mirror comes for me!

EK THE NYKTOZ THN XAPHN
RENNHOHKEZ EN MEAAINA RH

Grant me your power and fiery might
Crown me a daemon, the son of the night!
