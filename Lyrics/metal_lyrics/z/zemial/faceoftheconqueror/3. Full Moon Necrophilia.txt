Into the forest
Into the night
The crypts I seek
Again to night

Their rotten bodies
They feed my lust
To love a corpse to night I must

Full moon necrophilia

Under the moon
On holy ground
I seek the dead
To death I am bound

I fear no axes
I fear no steel
The more they hunt me
The more I kill!

Full moon necrophilia

In the dead of night
I wonder under pure moonlight
I seek dead flesh...

Screams break the silence
I shall return
They will never find me
I shall never burn!

Screams break the silence
I shall return
They will never find me
I will return...
