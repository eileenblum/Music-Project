Crawling into the crypts below
Inside the kingdom of sands
Buried beneath the ancient dust
Perverted race of slaves

I travelled race to the stars
And fell shaking before them

I reached the palace of
Death and eternal thirst
Through the gates of ghanzir
I found the way pass through
And enter the forgotten kingdoms

Temple of the lost ones
Perverted race of slaves

Beyond the grave
Eternal ruins
I hear the god idolatos that growls

View from the graves
Taste the loss (eternal light)
I shall never disturb
His mystic dreams

My thoughts are blind (pure)
He stares at me under his sinking veil
I shall serve the mosity grave
The blinded master laughs within his throne
