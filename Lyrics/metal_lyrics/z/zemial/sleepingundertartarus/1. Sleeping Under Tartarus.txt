Screaming blasphemous names
In the nocturnal wind
Carving the eternal seals
Invoke the ancient kings

In the freezing vast desert
I spill my blood upon the altar
I summon the dragon of chaos
I bow down before thee and hail

Blazing crown of the night
Hath fallen to our possession
Ishnigarrab shall walk
Through the rays
Azagthoth is rising to his feet

Mighty priest awakes
From the eternal dark depths
Of thousand millenniums of sin
Deluge to the kingdom of infidels

Reign of the forgotten
All we disciples rejoice
At last the rebirth of the cult
Revenge burns in our veins
