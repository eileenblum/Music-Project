Journey in vain to the land of absu
She rolls inside the seas of no return
Within the vaulted halls of darkness
Black winds return

Declaration was done
But she awaits thoughtless
Oh! the ancient scripts
And darkness reigns supreme

Down in the palace of eternal winds
All pride was lost forever more
Like souls, who wander in emptiness
After the gates, pruity was desecrated

Lyrics by Emperor Vorskaath, 1994
