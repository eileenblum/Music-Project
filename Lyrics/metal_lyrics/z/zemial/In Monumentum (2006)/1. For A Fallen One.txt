Summoned are powers to fight me over a fallen one
Black tears still drowning my eyes
Memories flooding the temple

Mountains of brave men wielding spears cut short your breaths
'Til their death I shall fight for you now
Leader of men mighty king

Arrows and blades of bronze rise before me, barbed spears strike bodies to the ground fight we for you glorious fallen one!

Greatest of men rise like a mountain
Mothers now mourn in our wake
The battle is raging like flames

We fight over a fallen one
Charging as a great wave with a might roar
Bringing the darkness to their eyes
I sing for you might king

The sun dove into the horizon and so faded the men's strength
Twas time to mourn and mourn they did
Only then in the peace of night did the greatness of their loss descend upon them and ashes poured they upon their heads in mourning
Streams of tears and bitterness flowed as their brother shrouded in flames
Travelled the dark shores of Styx...to hades.
And as their bodies and minds swallowed the loss and exhaustion a single thought emerged revenge for honour!

Fuelled by revenge, men charge the walls
Riding into battle like a storm
Thee charge breaks the silence, neath the morning sun
This battle is fought for honour- for a fallen one.
