A man is born and a man will die, but mighty is the one who lives with pride
Trust in your sword though its blade is so cold...
Great the spirit that chooses to live, the one who heeds the call of the dream
To soar like an eagle, to reach for the skies...

One short life to live
Before you sail to the skies
One brief memory to leave
Like a shooting star in the night

One brief chance to give
To carve the stone of our times
And your songs long lost friend
Forever stay in our minds
