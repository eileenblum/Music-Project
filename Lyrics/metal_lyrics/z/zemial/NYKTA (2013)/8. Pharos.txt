[Part I - Dreamer Lost]

Beyond the Pillars of the pale Moonlight
My misty Dream doth lead my tired Soul;
Amongst the biting stench of old, unfinished graves - I thought I heard sarcastic laughter in the Wind -
This land seems cursed why am I here I do not know - and the Lighthouse is now far behind...

The answer to my question no, I wish I never found;
A pitiful parody of wrinkled human flesh and skinny bones
The fiendish host, it leads my by the hand...
I am forced to read the symbols of... NUG SOTH!
"DAMAMIACH . that made the Mountains shake"
"CROM-YHA - Who spoke the Name"

No sound succeeded my screams. And my flesh...
My flesh, branded with unholy Sorcery - Forever!

The Dark, it sweetly comforts me from Their Eyes
The Lighthouse is visible now,
I might escape soon...

[Part II - The Great Dark]

Contemplate Dreaming Forever!

Nightly you travel to worlds distant yet so near.
Helpless you observe and your mind is swept from one place to another yet you are always still.
You search for a beacon to remember... to return.

[Transmission]: Galaxy of Fallon to Telepath 1

Amongst dusty moments of small apparent significance lay as gleaming jewels
the moments of Truth - the light Within the Great Darkness.
Yet in the light of the almighty power of Helios you forget...
you lay to the dust "just another dream..."

[Mother:]
"Welcome my child - I knew it when I first saw you...
Come; come with me through the desert sands
to the Serpent of the Deepest Seas.
Come along now..."
