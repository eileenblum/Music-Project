And the forests of my Dreams are here
And the absolute Twilights
And the Rituals of Antiquity are here
And the Dreamy Starlit Nights
And the Red Wine I have drunk and spilled
And the deepest of my desires are fulfilled
And the sounds still sing in my mind
Yet, I am in between - my heart is as black as an Eclipse

Black Spells I cast, a catastrophe I summon:
"...Sweep through this world like the Winds of War!
Ah Immemorial Ocean, drown their sleep with watery walls of Terror!"

Eclipse!
I strode through the Ages, searching for your
Eclipse!
In the Shadow of XAPÎ©N I have followed your distant
Eclipse!
My Soul forever is yearning for your
Eclipse!
At the threshold of Death's Dream I have found your Eclipse!

When the ring of the Moon possesses me,
When the ring of the Moon entraps me,
When the ring of the Moon caresses me,
Then the ring of the Moon conducts me!
Entrapped!

I am a slave in your Abyss
My eyes are shut, but I can see your Glory
What have you done to me?
I am a slave to Moon Magic supreme...
