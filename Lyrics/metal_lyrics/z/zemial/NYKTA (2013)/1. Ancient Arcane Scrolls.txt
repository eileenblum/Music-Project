This cold Night, Moonlight is the only light I see
Yet Priests behind me hold the torches ablaze
Procession to the top of the (sacred) mountain - Ziggurat
The mighty Gods of the silent Night I shall invoke

The Ancient abyss yields whispering beckoning voices
The sign of the Dark Moon... Their summoning leaves me no choices!
Before me the Glory of Their Autocratic Shadow
I try to remember... the altar is ever so cold...

The darkest, the coldest the distant winds of Sumeria
Have mesmerized me, the blazing Dusk is now behind
I wish to Call You, my soul to You to Sacrifice
Come Gods hear me, my life is eternally Yours!

The incense still burning, my heart for Ye is yearning
The incense still burning, my heart for Ye is yearning
I gaze into the cauldron, magical mirror show me
I see Them coming, choke the skies with smoke!

Dark unfolding Their legacy
They Speak to me in my thoughts
Paralysed and in Ecstasy
Bathed in Light I Know...

- "We Know who you are and we know you are One..."
- "Dare you step to the Side of the Longest Shadow?"

"I know Who You are and I know I am One with Thee
You Dream Life Forever and hold out Your hand to me"

As certain as the Red Eye of the Sun
Crowned in Glory shall circle away...
For Moonlight to rise and watch in peace...
They shall return and so the scrolls do say.

Remember, the Red Eye of the Sun!
The Red Eye of the Sun!
The Red Eye of the Sun!
The Red Eye of the Sun!

ARCANUM ARACANORUM...
