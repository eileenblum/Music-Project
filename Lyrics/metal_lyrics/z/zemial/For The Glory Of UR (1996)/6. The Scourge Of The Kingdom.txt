Journey in vain, to the land of Absu
She rolls inside the Seas of no return
Within the vaulted Halls of Darkness
Black Winds return

The Declaration was done
But She awaits thoughtless
The Ancient Scripts
Darkness rules supreme

Down in the Palace of eternal Winds
All pride was lost forever more
Like souls that wander in emptiness
After the Gates, purity was desecrated
