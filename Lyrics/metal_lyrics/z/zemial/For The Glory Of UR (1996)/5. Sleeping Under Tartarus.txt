Screaming, blasphemous Names
In the Nocturnal Wind
Carving the Eternal Seals
Invoke the Ancient Kings

In the freezing, vast desert
I spill my Blood on the Altar
I Summon the Dragon of Chaos
I bow down before Thee and hail

The blazing Crown of the Night
Hath fallen to our possession
Ishnigarrab shall walk through the Rays
Azagthoth is Rising on His feet

In the freezing, vast desert
I spill my Blood on the Altar
I Summon the Dragon of Chaos
I bow down before Thee and hail

The Mighty Priest awakes
From the eternal, dark Depths
A thousand millenniums of sin
Deluge to the kingdom of the infidels

Reign of the Forgotten
All we disciples rejoice
At last the rebirth of the Night Cult
Revenge burns in our veins!
