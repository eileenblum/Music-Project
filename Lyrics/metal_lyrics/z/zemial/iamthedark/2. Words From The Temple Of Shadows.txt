A rite from the depths of antiquity
Opens the eye of a god
Your name called in the temple of shadows
A sacrifice - you shall respond!

Over and over you reach for their secret to find
But now you know that the daemon has spoken the truth
In corridors of whispers, entranced, you have uttered their names
And cursed the moments when dreams fade away

For they where here before you
Remember the eye of the throne is watching
The chains will break in the deep seas
The gates will open

Over and over you reach for their secret to find
But now you know that the daemon has spoken the truth
In corridors of whispers, entranced, you have uttered their names
And cursed the moments when dreams fade away

"Oh wings of deep darkness,
Bring forth the gods that ride the ancient starlight and
Dream amongst the heavens"

The serpent, shall scream again
The nights shall have no end
Another, sign to remember,
The walls that hold Absu out... will break

[Priestess:]
"Der Widerhall einer BeschwÃ¶rung im Tempel der Schatten. Die Zeit ist nah, in der die Pforte sich Ã¶ffnet und die TrÃ¤umer erscheinen. Trage uns zur Morgen- und AbenddÃ¤mmerung und zur Dunkelheit des westlichen Himmels."
[English translation:]
"The echo of a summoning in the temple of shadows. The time is near, for the gate to be opened and the dreamers to arrive. Carry us to morning and evening twilight and to the darkness of the western sky."
