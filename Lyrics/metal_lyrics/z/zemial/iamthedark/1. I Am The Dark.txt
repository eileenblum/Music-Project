Half your life you spend in my arms
I bring you what you call dreams
You know me well - I am the dark
You can see me but still you cannot see

I know your feelings when you come to me
Naked...
Step outside your circle if you can, come closer to me
And I will come into your dreams

"I want you, I need you" - you call for me
"I want you, I need you - teach me"
"I want you, I need you" - you reach for me
I listen...

Summon my demons, form your circle
You think you'll stop me?
Look at yourself, look deep within the waters
Can you see?

And when you come in pain and agony again
You want to know my answers
You feel alone and then you beg for me
Open up to me my child - I'll come

I am the dark!

Summon my demons, form your circle
You think you'll stop me?
Look at yourself, look deep within the waters
Can you see?

And when you candle flames burn for me again
And when you need my darkness
And when you come to me I give to you my flame
Because I am the dark
