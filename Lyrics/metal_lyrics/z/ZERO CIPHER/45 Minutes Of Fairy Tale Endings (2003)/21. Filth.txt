Pickup

I can see you now, so lost and blinded by yourself
Been fucked around, fucked around always
Safe so protected in your little world
Sick of yourself now you're gasping for air

Outside, its draining away
Yeah

Pickup...

Suffocating - you're wasting my time with this
What does it matter?
Because when you hear this you'll never get near:
Stupid fat boy

Outside, its draining away
Well you lose

Pickup...

Don't tell me lies

Lies
Lies
Lies
Lies

Fake, you're a...

Outside, it's draining away,
Are we just over, hanging on for fear of whats to lose?

Outside, its draining... away
Gone through the motions,
Hanging on for fear, of whats to lose

"So let me show you right here"
How do I separate the truth from your fucking bullshit?
"Maybe I should get down on my knees?"
That's right bitch, thats right
