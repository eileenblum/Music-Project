Save us all?
You failed me
Left behind
I'm dying
Back, forth
You're such a
Down out
You're such a
Through and through
Such a slut

And all of this weakness that won't go away?
It's over
Now that it's too late I know that it's all my fault
I'll live through this anyway

Yeah, you wanted it this, wanted it this, wanted it this

Way and so
You left me
Watered down
With nothing

Suddenly, suddenly
Said to me,
You've taken my wings tonight, everything
So, where are you now?

You're a credit to this
A liar in my way
