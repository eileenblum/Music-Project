Well I'm just building up to this full head of steam
I got the temperature rising I got high self esteem
Cos I'm a natural
So you drop to your knees
Step out the drivers seat
And hand over the keys
I got your fix

Yeah - you're nothing special
Drop me into your mouth, then you'll grow 60ft tall

Screaming

Bend me shake me anyway you want, sing it
Bend me shake me anyway you want

Yeah, I'm a predator, and I was raped by a bull
I got a sharp suit on, you watch me take to the floor
And see me in control
Lick your lips, taste the rush
Keep drinking alcohol
I got the cure for your lust,
It's right here baby

Bend me shake me anyway you want

Yeah - I'm someone special
I can reach for the stars, like I'm 60ft tall, thanks to you

Bend me shake me anyway you want
