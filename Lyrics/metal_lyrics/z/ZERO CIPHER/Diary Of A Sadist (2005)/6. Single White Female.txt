Meet Mel, the campus slut
She just can't keep her little legs shut
Outrageous
You're always crashing the party

Said that you were not that kind
So you're no worse then?
When you're running around, in you're slutty shoes
With you're tits hanging out, like you're front page news

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... oh

Do you think I'm sexy?
You've spent all your life, being a slut
Can't you stop pretending that you're something you're not

Gotta stop pretending
That you're something you're not
Gotta stop pretending
That you're something - you're not

Get down
