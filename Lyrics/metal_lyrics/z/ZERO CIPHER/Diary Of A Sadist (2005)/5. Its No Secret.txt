Goodbye my friend, you won't see me again
I'm on my feet again
Don't say - how about it?
No secret about it

So like, it or not, its no secret this is all I got
And baby that ain't ever going to stop
So what do you want? What have I got?
Take it or leave it there's no time to stop and
Think about it like this anymore

Hello, hello again, close the door and walk right in
To say
How about it
To see
If I'd done it

Never never never
Never never never
