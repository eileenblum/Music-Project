Open your eyes

Wasted, high everyday
Try me, tired of breathing?
Well I am the weapon so watch me explode
And sing this song for you

Cos you've come to the end of the world
And there's something I think you should know
I'll be dancing on your grave

In a world that advocates
All this blood on my hands
Swear that I got the devil riding on my back
For you to sit with

Close your eyes
