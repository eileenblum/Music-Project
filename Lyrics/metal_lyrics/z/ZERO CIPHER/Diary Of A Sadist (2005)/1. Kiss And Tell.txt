It's time you woke up to yourself

Kiss and tell this time it's serious
You sell your story but no one hears it

I move forward and you move back
You want to deceive me but it's time I said that

I don't give a fuck if you leave
Read between all of the lines
It's time that you see that you're dreaming
Only been cheating yourself
Wake up to the truth get some help

Can't you tell your so obvious the lies drip through you
Like intravenous

Without me your nothing worthless
Fuel my fire listen to this
