Desperate
Sores came and opened up
To swallow me whole
In this hole

Hear again
See again
Touch it and smell it and taste it and breathe it
To feel again

Just sometimes
I like to fantasize that you're here
So you could know just how this feels
Oh yeah

Given time
Scratched your name into my arm
Like nothings changed
Nothings changed

In the cold of the city at night, waiting for you
Burning both, another sleepless night

Gain and again and again and again
