You'd look so pretty on your knees
Begging for me to let you breathe
But for now I'll let you leave
It's for your own safety

This seconds wasted
I wasted it all on you
Take a look in the mirror
Is it big enough for two?

Throw your hands up
Throw your horns up

Your hear me say
Fuck you
To everybody I got to
Say fuck you
To everybody I got to
With a super-charged ego
Everyone's see through
Look me in the eyes then you'll see
We don't need you
