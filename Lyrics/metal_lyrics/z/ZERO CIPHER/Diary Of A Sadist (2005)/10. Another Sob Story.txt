I hear we're falling out?
Another sob story
Your bullshit yeah well
I bought it once
But those days are gone
It's so goddamn boring

Here comes a flock of seagulls
Tired of losing their way
I'll watch you follow them
Over that precipice

Well not much to say I guess
Another sob story
All your bullshit yeah well
I bought it once, but those days are gone
It's so boring, boring, yeah

One two three seven

Counting the days on one hand
It's like supply and demand
All those times, I should have told you
That I'm

Counting the days on one hand...

Sick of the sight of you
Sick of the sound of your voice
Sick of the sight of you
Sick of the sound of your voice

Yeah
