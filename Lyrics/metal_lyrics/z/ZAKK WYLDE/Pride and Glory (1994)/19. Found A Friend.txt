Time; take some time
If you wouldn't mind
Just a minute or two
Cause time done weighin' on my mind
Blinded my eyes
Not knowin' what to do
Alone I've held the hand of sorrow
Feelin' like I'm hangin' from the gallow
Lord won't ya please color my sky one time blue
When life's left town and run me through
I'm glad I found a friend in you

I tried Lord how I done tried
Not to break down when it was goodbye
And no one said it was gonna be easy
I found out that ain't no damn lie

Alone I done held the hand of sorrow
Feelin' like I'm hangin' from the gallow
Lord won't ya please color my sky one time blue
When life's left town run me through
I'm glad I found a friend in you
