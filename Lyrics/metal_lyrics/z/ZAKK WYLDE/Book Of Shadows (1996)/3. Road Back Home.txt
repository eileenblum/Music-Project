I look around I see that time ain't changed
Same old faces, Same old names
All the things we thought we knew
You lied to me &amp; I lied to you
(Now) All this time
You never sympathize
All this time
I can't find my way back inside
What you give is what you get
But you drew the line on me baby
Tears falling free but you can't see (child)
I'm just a touch away baby

[Chorus]
Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where &amp; how
Show me the road back home (oh-yeah)
Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where &amp; how
Show me the road back home, back home

The pain blew in like a hurricane
Stranger in this town bearing your name
Trapped in the silence with my memories
It's cutting me deep &amp; its tellin' me

All this time
You never sympathize
All this time
I can't find my way back inside

Going nowhere &amp; I'm headed there fast &amp; I
don't mean maybe
The light is getting low &amp; my touch is growing cold
Oh just hold me baby

Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where &amp; how
Show me the road back home (oh-yeah)
Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where &amp; how
Show me the road back home, back home

[Guitar Solo]

What you give is what you get
But you drew the line on me baby
Tears falling free but you can't see (child)
I'm just a touch away baby

Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where &amp; how
Show me the road back home (oh-yeah)
Tell me where am I now (oh-o)
Why, where &amp; how
Show me the road back home, back home
