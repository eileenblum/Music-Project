[Bonus Track]

Sittin' sippin' sorrow
It's gone straight to my head
I say the pain shall come and it shall go
A friend once said

You ain't livin' for no God, no
You be livin' for the dollar sign
I say a frown upon your maker's face
You shall find

So much wrong
You have tried, oh yeah
I've waited far
Oh, far too long, yeah

Talking about your evil ways
And this pen that wrote this song
I'm talking about your evil ways
And this pen that wrote this song

Wanting to know nothing
Living through a child's eyes
A smile comes upon your face
As I break and cry

If nothing seems to matter
In the end what are you doin' it for?
To see the trail of twisted broken souls
Across the floor

So much wrong, yeah
You've done tried, oh yeah
I waited far
Lord, I waited far too long, yeah

Talking about your evil ways
And this pen that wrote this song
I'm talking about your evil ways
And this pen that wrote this song

Oh so much wrong, child
You done tried, oh yeah
I waited far
Lord, I waited far too long, yeah

Talking about your evil ways
And this pen that wrote this song
Talking about your evil ways
And this pen that wrote this song

I'm talking about your evil ways
And this pen that wrote this song, oh yeah
