[Bonus Track]

Come, take my hand
Let us walk for a while
Your burden of pain
Replaced with a smile
Never so far, only so close
As you melt in your false cradle below

For the peddlers of death
Always come calling one more time
Bearing promises of feeling fine

For the peddlers of death
Always come calling one more time
Bearing promises of feeling fine

So called friends are running loose
Draining you whole
'Til you're of no use
Letting go of things you need most

Son, early wish, early grave, early ghost

For the peddlers of death
Always come calling one more time
Bearing promises of feeling fine

For the peddlers of death
Always come calling one more time
Bearing promises of feeling fine

For the peddlers of death
Always come calling one more time
Bearing promises of feeling fine

For the peddlers of death
Always come calling one more time
Bearing promises of feeling fine
