I beat you down and
You scream that's pitiful
I've seen enough
Of your lies
My time has come
Prepare for the war
Lay down your gun
And face to the wall

You're weak and my
strength is endless
The perfect time
For revenge
I slice your flesh
And slit your veins
And you are
Never seen again

The suffering is my passion
your soul is getting weak
I can't deny my passion
The pleasure is mine

Suffering is my passion
I can't deny my only passion

My rampage so wild
So passionate
I will be haunting
Your soul
And when the shies
Fall down from above
I'll take my place
On the throne

The suffering is my passion
your soul is getting weak
I can't deny my passion
The pleasure is mine

My pleasure is suffering
