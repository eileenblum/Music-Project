From the abyss arose
The dawning of time
The incarnation
Existence and Armageddon

As life is made
Through my fingers
I plant the seed of damnation
Waste the principles
Of Evil and Good
Worship the dawn
Before it's gone
Saints of the
Wicked cults arise

Formed into this vain
Abomination give in to
Another unholy creation
Swept trough mires
Of dystopic wrath
They reach the shores
Of blasphemy and greed

I curse the flesh
With my disease
Existence was made
It will be undone

The womb is cut wide open
Life flows uncontrolled
But time will judge the living
When the veil of death unfolds
Cut wide open

Life was formed
In the abyss
Through my fingers
Uncontrolled
I curse the flesh
With my disease
Existence was formed
It will be undone
The injection of disease
In your blood a
Just surprise
Given by
Mother Nature
From the abyss arose
The dawning time
The incarnation
Existence and Armageddon

Waste of the principles
Of Evil and Good
Worship the dawn
Before it's gone
Slaves to the
Terror from above

The womb is cut wide open
Life flows uncontrolled
But time will judge the living
When the veil of death unfolds

I cut my womb wide open
Life flows uncontrolled
And I will judge the living
When death unfolds
