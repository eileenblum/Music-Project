Monuments of the Divine
One rise against the
Ones who suffer
The words from your
Poisoned tongue is nothing
But hordes of lies

Another twilight awakening
From the graves of despair
What pleasure to
Find in the dark
When submerged by
Total blackness
And the pain will
Forever be untold

I can't bear this burden
You need to understand
We won't ask for mercy

Monuments of the Divine
One rise against the
Ones who suffer
The words from your
Poisoned tongue is nothing
But hordes of lies
We only ask for justice
