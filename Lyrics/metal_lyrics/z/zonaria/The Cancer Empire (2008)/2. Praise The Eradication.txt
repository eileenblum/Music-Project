The Bombs are away
In the end life found a way
We're soaked
By the nuclear rain
Seems like you prayed in vain

Confess your ignorance
And sufferless
For the fate of
Society is death
As the lepered crave for the cure
And the world wants more
Conceive a new perception
And get what you're searching for

With words of lies you are fed
Words told by the dead
But you still want more
Load your gun and
Walk out the door

Mankind is the source
Given no remorse
Drowned in sin
Let the fucking war begin

As the lepered crave for the cure
And the world wants more

Anticipation and confusion
Now praise the eradication
The world is just
A scenery of vanity
A true drama of evil in disguise
[x2]

Pass on suffering to
The next generation
Blinding your children
With your own satisfaction
