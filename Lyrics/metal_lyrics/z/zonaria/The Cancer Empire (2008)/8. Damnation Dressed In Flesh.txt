The war suffered by every
Man like a virus infecting the Earth
Forget the days of sanity
And bring on the age of tyranny
A new order of Evil begotten

I don't wanna see
I don't wanna feel
I don't wanna taste
Their soul lobotomy
And I've been fighting
To end this great battle
I don't wanna love
I don't wanna lust
The taste of human flesh
And I don't wanna die

Flesh is their desire as
They're feeding our world
Longing to devour
The essence of humanity
Rise from the ashes
To not be forgotten
I don't wanna see
I don't wanna feel
I don't wanna taste
Their soul lobotomy
And I've been fighting
To end it all
I don't wanna love
I don't wanna lust
The taste of human flesh
And I don't wanna leave
I don't wanna be
Dressed for damnation

Breed immortal legions
With absolute devotion
Craving disaffection for
A world in total control
The world is controlled

I don't wanna see
I don't wanna feel
I don't wanna taste
Their soul lobotomy
And I've been fighting
To end this great battle
I don't wanna love
I don't wanna lust
The taste of human flesh
And I don't wanna leave
I don't wanna be dead

Wake up
Load guns
Kill kill
Dressed for damnation
Hear the end calling
