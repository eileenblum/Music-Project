Infected light from the sun
Still feeding to this world
Upholding has we know
And providing cancer
Injustice will reign
Until the final day
And when society fails
Then termination has made
Its way into the flesh

Fallen angels
Descend from above
Humanity overload
Like a vulture feeding
On your soul
And stripping
Down to the bone
We will never be free
From this terror
Reign of mankind
The final battle has begun
The world will be burned

Annihilation
It is the only end

I see a white light
Shinning down on me
When everything and
Everyone just cease to be
We fought to save our race
But now it's finally clear
That if sanity would reign
It would be the end of humanity

Annihilation
There is no way to forget

I see a white light
Shinning down on me
When everything and
Everyone just cease to be
We fought to save our race
But now it's finally clear
That if sanity would reign
It would be the end of humanity
