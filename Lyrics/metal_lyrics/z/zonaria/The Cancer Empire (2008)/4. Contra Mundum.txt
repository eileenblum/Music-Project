Bellum -- Omium -- Contra -- Omnes

What is gone, what remains
What's the purpose
For this universe
As evolution will
Plead crucifixion
Succumbing to life so profane
And life fades away
Will we die in vain?

A disease festering
In every man
Like every death
There is no turning back

Another War is raging on
Is it the final battle
To wipe the faith away?
To Eradicate?
So passes the
Glory of the world

Bellum -- Let's stand united
Omium -- And prepare for war
Contra -- Extermination
Omnes -- Is revolution
[x2]

Bellum -- We breed the chaos
Omium -- It's human nature
Contra -- Annihilation
Omnes -- It's the new beginning
