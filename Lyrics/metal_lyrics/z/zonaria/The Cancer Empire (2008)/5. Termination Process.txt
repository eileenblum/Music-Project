The chains of life has set me free
But I just can't flee
Giving way for another
Massive killing spree
I offer you to
Feel my vengeance
Cause I will fight
To end this sickness
Your holy Holocaust

Infected by your
Greed the masses kneel
But a world led
By you will never heal
I will make you
Swallow your tongue
And make you beg for mercy
Before the world will burn

The process starts
In our hearts
With the faith in God
And infects us all
The process starts
In our hearts
With the faith in God
And will end in blood

I will make you
Swallow your tongue
And make you beg for mercy
Before the world will burn

The process starts
In our hearts
With the faith in God
And infects us all
The process starts
In our hearts
With the faith in God
And will end in blood
