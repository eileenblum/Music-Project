Never spread affection for those
Who don't need sympathy
The infection will draw its
Pleasure from the flesh
Your lust for slow corruption
Will see a new sensation
The last venomous kiss
And a touch of death

For the time is now, to wander on
Blind among the shadows
Realities collide and
Rot away in nothingness
As society forever
Limps on leaderless
We reform the dominion
For a new king shall be crowned
And crosses turn around

Starving horizons
Beneath the burning skies
Invited by the Serpentine
Forgive and drink its venom
And be free from Sin
And the masses gather
For redemption
For the time has come
To crown King Cancer

Swear your allegiance
To the Empire

Guided by the splendor of
Darkness and deception
We've reached the reveries
Of the great purgatory
The frontline in enemy land
Lost it's perfection
The mirror of your soul
Reflects your prostitution

Starving horizons
Beneath the burning skies
Invited by the Serpentine
Forgive and drink its venom
And be free from Sin
And the masses gather
For redemption
For the time has come
To crown King Cancer
