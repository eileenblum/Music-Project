Swore to serve Evil in
The race against Man
By the will of justice
And this merciful God
God

The ascension to
The darkness is the
True path of human nature

Born lifeless then
Consumed by grace
To be the puppet on
The string of the damned
Command your forces
Descend upon the weak
Claim your victory
The Earth turns to dust

At war with the dead
Rape
Triumph
Justice
Will never be told

Love
Hate
War
The war turns cold

Lead me into the dark of night
And make my name last forever

Some things are
Better left untold
At war with the inferior
Strike down on the innocent
The target still remains
