the war is raging on
fatal destruction
slowly reaching
our last departure

the assault upon this world
has just begun
we tried to undo
what could not be undone
embracing the confidence
the powers you adore
so what are you waiting for
when your world is no more

now becoming
a new formation
purification
through Armageddon

the assault upon this world
has just begun
we tried to undo
what could not be undone
embracing the confidence
the powers you adore
so what are you waiting for
when your world is no more

their invasion
made slaves of us all
sent us pounding
on heavens door

the assault upon this world
has just begun
we tried to undo
what could not be undone
embracing the confidence
the powers you adore
so what are you waiting for
when your world is no more
