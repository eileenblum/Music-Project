Somethings can never be forgotten
Like nations that lost control

The price we are paying
The inevitable stream of guilt
And now they are raping
We're about to fade away

The time is here
What are you waiting for
Created by devastation

A blinding reflection
Caressing the impure
Now fill your soul with hatred
There will never be a cure

The time is here
What are you waiting for
Destroyed by the ones
Who destroyed the world

The time is here
What are you waiting for
Wipe out the trace of life
From the face of the earth
