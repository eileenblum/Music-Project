The image of myself
Defiled for my deeds
Carrying only sad memories
There's nothing for me here

A lament for the one i used to be
Just a threatened memory
There is no turning back

My remaining task
is to review the questions
For answers
The insight of my ruined life
I followed the wrong ones

A lament for the one i used to be
Just a threatened memory
There is no turning back

A tear to be shed
For the one in the mirror
Now i cast no reflections
I will fade away
