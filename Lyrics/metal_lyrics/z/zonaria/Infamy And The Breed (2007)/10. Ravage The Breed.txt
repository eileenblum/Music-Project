Kill or be killed that's reality
Know that suffering will be
We slave to this world of infamy
It will ravage the breed

Raise the apocalypse machinery
Bring death to us all
Their wrath will be feeding from deep within
And the battle on the living will begin

Your presence gives a blessing
And life descends to death
The sinners among us
Will never surrender

Raise the apocalypse machinery
Bring death to us all
We all slave to this world of infamy
It will ravage the breed

Your presence gives a blessing
And life descends to death
The sinners among us
Will never surrender
