We always try to run towards the end
Can't find no reason to remain
Cunning are those who dies at birth
Not having to face the cruelty of this world

Another time, another crime
The dust from our world wiped away into nothingness
Feel the bless and the caress
My pain is no more but everyone dwells in agony

Will we ever know what happened
They say that we were taken away
As long as I'm dead

Unfolded is the veil of damnation
It was the end of this perfect creation
Cunning are those who dies at birth
Not having to face the cruelty of this world

Will we ever know what happened
They say that we were taken away
As long as I'm dead
