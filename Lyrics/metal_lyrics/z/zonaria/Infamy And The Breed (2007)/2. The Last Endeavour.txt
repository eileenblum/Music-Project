Fight!
I recall your first revelation
The words that ignite my damnation
A last but relieving endeavour
To dig my own grave
And fade away forever
I would not receive my redemption
My soul was gone and mind was black
Committing a secret allegiance with fire
'Cos nothing in this world
Compares to what I desire
Your soul, my will
Temptation, to kill
I undergo what you don't know
You're in the freak-show
So now you know the battle is on
