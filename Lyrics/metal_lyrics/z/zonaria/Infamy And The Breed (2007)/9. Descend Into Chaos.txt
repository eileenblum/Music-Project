Seek and destroy
Erase every nation
In machine gun fashion
The vultures unleashed the beast
And slaughter is passion

What has become of the world
Why is humanity descending
Into bestiality
But machines need to feed
On this dreadful reality

We all descend
Into chaos

Mankind
Descending
Falling
Mankind is dying
