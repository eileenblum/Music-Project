VENGEANCE!
Burn it in my eyes
FREE ME!
So I can rise again

To bring death to your soul
And strike you down, rip the skin off your bone
Once killed by your lies

When I rise from below
Then you will be the first one to know
And when it's my turn
I will make you burn

BLEEDING!
I need my sacrifice
CRAVING!
Cos I need it now

To come and take you down
And bring an end to to your existence
I will kill, purify
Your death is what I need to justify

But I've gotta to realize
That I was just rendered in vain
A slave to the fate of creation
And I've gotta pay with life
And pass on to the other side
I can't escape my ultimate destruction
