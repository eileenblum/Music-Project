When the world is descending
I can feel their hatred growing stronger
The pain is rising in my soul
The never-ending pain
Feels like I've been here before

I can hear a whisper
Something is about to begin
But I'm locked in
A cage till the end
Awaiting the apocalypse
It's the price we have to pay
Now we all have to face it

All will go down
But we never will surrender
It's time to break the chains of life
But the omen told us
We're gonna die
