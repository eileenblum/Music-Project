You puppy-eyed faggots
I'm gonna feed you to the maggots
Fuck you, can't you see you're the enemy?
I won't submit to this slavery

Liberation zero

There won't be another tomorrow
With imperial eyes they control
Machine guns feel no sorrow
Godspeed, it's your final call

Liberation zero

Sky has fallen
The terror has begun
You are never the ones to justify
Raping through centuries
Spare me your fucking lies
For my dying wish is to be alive

Refuel your veins with inhumanity
Set me free from this wicked dream
Drink up, receive immortality
Pain, misery, weakness inflicted

Only fools follow you

This is your final call

Sky has fallen
The terror has begun
You are never the ones to justify
Through bleeding fingers
It all will fade away
I am the one to glorify

Raping through the centuries
Spare me your fucking lies
For my dying wish is to be alive
Just let me be alive

You will fail
Because only fools follow you
