Go

It begins as a rising tide
Then comes crashing down
Show no remorse, only force
It's my destiny to fight terror and [?]

Everything you have ever loved will be destroyed
Bodies swept away [?]
As all [?] start to overload
I am going on my own but I'm never alone

Overload
I'm not alone

Fall out
Into chaos descend
Will it ever end?
Sweet angel, put the gun to my head
[x2]

And I will never be, never be, never be alone
[x2]

No
I will show you no remorse
Only force
I start to strike

Go

Oh I sold my soul to [?] century
They turned the world to my enemy
I sacrifice [?] crucify the earth
For another bullet [?]

Indestructible
[?]
Put the gun to my head
Gunpoint salvation

Let there be no fear
No, no, never show no fear

Put the gun to my head
And I will never, never be alone

Fall out
Into chaos descend
Will it ever end?
Sweet angel, put the gun to my head
And give me peace

Fall out
Into chaos descend
Will it ever end?
Sweet angel, put the gun to my head
And please give it to me

Fall out
Into chaos descend
Will it ever end?
Sweet angel, please give it to me
Give it to me

I will never be, never be, never be alone
For I am my own [?]
