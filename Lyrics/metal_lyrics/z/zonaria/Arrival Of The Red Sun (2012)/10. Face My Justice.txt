Into the black shadows
On dying flesh you feed
I'll give you what you need
But you will not be my last enemy

No more lies
I won't be your sacrifice

Fatal surgery, you get the pleasure
Removing our souls from your world
When the bloody shores of utopia call
Will we stand or fall?

On your knees and face my justice
You will suffer me like I suffered you
Suffer forever
The pain and lies beneath the surface
Are buried but ready to break through
On your knees

Removing our souls from your world
Believing in every word
And now suffer me
On your fucking knees

Immortality or crucifiction
Bury our souls in the sands
When the mighty walls of utopia fall
There will be blood on your hands

On your knees and face my justice
You will suffer me like I suffered you
Suffer forever
The pain and lies beneath the surface
Are buried but ready to break through
I give or take with my finger
Close your eyes
I am the defeater of evil
The scars, so evident, linger
No more lies

Oh baby I beat the devil

You will not be my last enemy
