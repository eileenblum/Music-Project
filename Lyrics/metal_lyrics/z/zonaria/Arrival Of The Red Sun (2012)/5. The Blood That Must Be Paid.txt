If you want blood on your hands
Then open your wallet and fucking pay
'Cause it takes some pain to be free
I can give you immortality
Just put some trust in me
You saw the genocide
I'm not so kind
Do not believe their lies
And don't leave the truth behind

No one can stop my crusade
There's blood that must be paid
Open your eyes, don't be afraid
I'm not a liar
I only have but one desire
Blood for money, money for blood
Fuels my fire

Fire
Murder
Anger
Liar

Behind the enemy lines
Where out freedom dies
Pay the price
The blood that must be paid
And behind the dollar sign
Hides a terror design
The blood that must be paid

Open your wallet and fucking paid
I don't care about
What they fucking say
You opened your mouth in vain
My blood is not for sale
With no intention to pay

Blood for money
Money for blood

Not my blood
Trust in me
The recipe for immortality
Murder
For money
For glory
Forever

No blood is spilled in vain
When they are calling my name
I will forever be
Everybody's fucking enemy

Blood for money
Money for blood
Fuel the fire

No blood is spilled in vain
They're calling my name
I will forever be
Be your worst fucking enemy
