Where every hero turns to rust
Swallowed by the sands of time
And will never be remembered

Winds of desolation carry my name
The fever burns me alive

Burning out
Cutting through
Is it all I ever do?
What is left of me?

Riding through the furious storm
Blinded by the unforgiving sun
Give praise and reload your gun
The final war has begun

I roam across my empire
King of the wasteland

Burning out
Cutting through
Giving death is what we do
What is left to see?

No salvation without a blood red sun
I'm not a liar
We are the chosen ones

Your blood will be paid
In this final crusade

Your blood will be paid
In this final crusade

They call us murderers
We're gonna die alone
You won't remember us
We're already gone
The shadows haunting me
And the killing is free
Crown a new king
Burn everything
Bittersweet taste of victory
No souls left to reap
And no one left to weep

Salvation will come
Load your gun or die alone
We are the chosen ones

Riding through the furious storm
Blinded by the unforgiving sun
Give praise and reload your gun
'Cause the final desert storm has begun
Bleeding me, roam true, roam free
Be what we're born to be
Tears and blood wash away
You better save your tears
For the final day.
