Nothing can stop me
Realize that you are about die
Now sing a lullaby to those still alive
I will break your crown
Cut the rope, let you drown

As the flames burn higher

Descend into the fury of the war
Pushed hard to the wall
Now you will suffer forevermore

Your time is running out faster
I will fight you master

Sick of war, sick of lies
Now look into my rifle's eyes
I'll show you paradise
Vain was the nation you foretold
Like a blind fool's quest for gold

See out children running
Under a cloud of fire

Descend into the fury of the war
Pushed hard to the wall
Now you will suffer forevermore

Your time is running out faster
I will fight you master.

Your time has come
Erase and rewind
Now close your eyes and say goodbye
Sing a final lullaby to those still alive

I will go one,
I will never stop
There are no regrets
I won't forget

No, no, no, no, no, no, no never

Descend into the fury of the war
Pushed hard to the wall
Now you will suffer
Suffer forevermore

Time is running out
The world is burning now

Your time has come
Erase and rewind
Now close your eyes
And say goodbye
Sing a final lullaby

Never again
You won't be forgiven
I will never forget
And when the stars realign
Then I will be divine
Suffer forevermore.
