Armafuckinggeddon
A black sky falls down and hits the eye
Choose to live or wait to die
The war is all around
Too quiet to hear
I see a shape of Armageddon appear
This ravaging pain fills my heart
With never-ending lies and cold obsessions
Slowly tearing me apart
A silent holocaust in the dark unveil the atomic gods

And when they unleash the silent holocaust
Just believe in me
Idols of the world turn to rust
And cowards were those who covered the world in dust

I see a shape of Armageddon
One emperor to rule the world
Two enemies to the death, you and me
Three messengers of genocide
No, you are not my fucking god
The heavens are burning
Caressed by a nuclear god
Knives keep on turning
Bury the blades deep under my skin
The slaves of utopia will rise for in the final hour
You will witness the dead coming alive

When you feel the silent holocaust
Just believe in me
Idols of the world turn to rust
As mother earth turns to dust
Look into the eyes of the damned and watch me bleed
Now you will be left in your misery
For justice will only come through me.
