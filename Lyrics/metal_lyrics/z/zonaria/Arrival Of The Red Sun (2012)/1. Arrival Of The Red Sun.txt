They came aiming for judgment day fools on a 
False crusade they brought the fire
Crowned with thorns of razor wire

I've seen their crimes suffering, death
Children burned alive but trust in hope
We have the antidote

You're like disease but now you
Face your nemesis
We live and die for our beliefs

From raging genocide and
Fields of mines we rise
I pray and reload my gun
And as the dawn reappears
We dry up our tears praise
The arrival of the red sun

We await the arrival

There's something growing
Inside now I just wait
For the red sun to arrive
On razor wire grounds
We see the light from fields of mines we rise
Victorious we ride

From raging genocide and
Fields of mines we rise
I pray and reload my gun
And as the dawn reappears
We dry up our tears let justice be done
Let it be done and hear the end of all cries you
Failed to defeat me and when the time is
Drawing near we carry out the omega strike
Let the red sun rise.
