I put smile on my face as I finger the trigger
Liquefied rage running in my veins for I am the storm, your nightmare embodied
The night is young and my vengeance remains
When the night turns cold
I'm the devil on your soul as the heavens fall
Armageddon unfolds
And every soul is fallen from grace the legacy and fate of human race

Nowhere to run
I won't silence my bloodlust
Until I'm buried six feet under motherfucker

Your pitiful soul is gonna burn
The last of my enemies buried in flames
A final lesson in pain will be learned
And you will remember my name I am the cold liberation
You prayed in vain
And I will show you devotion you're just a part in my game
Nowhere to run

You prayed in vain
Nowhere to run, Armageddon unfolds
You're buried six feet under
The world turns cold, so cold

I am the cold liberation
You prayed in vain
And I will show you devotion you're just a part in my game
I possess world domination
My kingdom come and I will find the way to your heart
Not for love but to tear apart you are a part in my game.
