A Beautiful Art
Of Giving The Light
Obsessed By The Power Of Fire
Condemned To Serve The Unholy Glare

The Joy Of Satisfying
The Inner Wish For Might
When Keeping The Skills
To Disappear Into The Night

He Heard A Crying Voice
That Was Screaming For Mercy
His Name Will Always Be Cursed
This Night He Will Strike

The Powers He Hold
The Truth Behind Black Eyes
The Pyromaniac
So Cold In Mind

The Secret Untold
He Will Always Work Alone
When The Sun Fades Away
He Wakes Up To Slay Again

The Fire Came From Hell
His Anger And Malice As Well

He Heard A Crying Voice
That Was Screaming For Mercy
His Name Will Always Be Cursed
This Night He Will Strike

The Powers He Hold
The Truth Behind Black Eyes
The Pyromaniac
So Cold In Mind
