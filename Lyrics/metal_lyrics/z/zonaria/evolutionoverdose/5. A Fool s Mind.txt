The Way Of Destroying All Dreams Of Others
And Draining My Enemy From Desires
The Slaughter Of Inner Fairness
With All My Hatred

A Vision To Be Sacrificed
And A Place For Me To Hide
With Chaos And Vengeance In Mind

Pain Is My Only Friend
My Feelings For Life Are Lost
Everything I Once Looked Up To Is Gone
But I Fear My Passing

A Vision To Be Sacrificed
And A Place For Me To Hide
With Chaos And Vengeance In Mind

What Fools Have In Mind...

A Vision To Be Sacrificed
And A Place For Me To Hide
There Is No Treatment
For The Mind Of A Fool
