When Your Spirit Leaves Your Body
To Discover Enjoyment Among The Dead
Then It Could Be Too Late

There Is No Way To Find Yourself Now
An Empty Shell Without The Visions Held Within
Where Will You Go?

When The Night Is Closing In
IÂ´m Coming To Show You
The Way Back To Before The Fall

Disconnected, Out Of Reach For Me
And Still No Answer To My Calls
Forever You Will Burn

Here Again At The End
I Find You Completely Helpless
Almost Dead

When The Night Is Closing In
IÂ´m Coming To Show You
The Way Back To Before The Fall
