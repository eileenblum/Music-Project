IÂ´m feeling something twisting under my skin
Breaking me down, taking control, leaving nothing

The devil in me
Which no one wants to see
So rescue me or kill me
I donÂ´t care where i will be

ItÂ´s not to late to face my enemy
But iÂ´m slippinÂ´ away and growing weak
And still strong is he

I know i have to get him out of my mind
Before i take my life

Who can i blame
For giving me this pain
Is it my own imaginary enemy

I know i have to get him out of my mind
Before i take my life

Who can i blame
For giving me this pain
Is it my own imaginary enemy
