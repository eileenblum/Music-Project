The Image Of Myself
Defiled For My Deeds
Carrying Only Sad Memories
ThereÂ´s Nothing For Me Here

A Lament
For The One I Used To Be
Just A Threatened Memory
There Is No Turning Back

My Remaining Task Is To Review
The Questions For Answers
The Insight Of My Ruined Life
I Followed The Wrong Ones

A Lament
For The One I Used To Be
Just A Threatened Memory
There Is No Turning Back

A Tear To Be Shed
For The One In The Mirror
Now I Cast No Reflection
It Has Faded Away
