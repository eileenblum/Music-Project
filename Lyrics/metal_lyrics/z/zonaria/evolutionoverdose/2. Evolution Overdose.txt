IÂ´ve Been Told About An Ending
A Darkness To Cover This World
Now ItÂ´s Here, Tearing Our Souls Apart
Leaving No Hopes, No Dreams Nor Rapture

The Arrival Of The Shadows
IÂ´m Suffocated, CanÂ´t Take My Last Breath
And Time, Revealed To Be Our Enemy
Now Everything Will Slowly Cease To Be

Time Has Come To An End
Which No One Will Escape
Leaving The World Paralyzed And Vain
Cos Seas Will Drain And We Will Fade Away

Time Has Come To An End
Which No One Will Escape
Leaving The World Paralyzed And Vain
Cos Seas Will Drain And We Will Fade Away
