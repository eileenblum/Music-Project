Fuck you people!!!  Lie and betray I thought love was a reality come true Friends to death whatever happens to us I thought they were like fucking gods Now everything's dark and true  In a chaos of dead images And you, you know what I am saying again I walk blindly and they will guide me To the darkest shadow...I hate you  I hate you  Lie and betray I trusted you and you have betrayed me Your looks talk about only you I trusted love but it spoilt my life Now everything's dark and true  In a chaos of dead images And you, you know what I am saying again I walk blindly and they will guide me To the darkest shadow...I hate you  I pray for the day you will drop dead I piss on the altar of your remains I will walk proudly in your cortege  I hate you
