I'm leaving you because I'm no use now I'm leaving you' cause I'm nothing anymore I'm leaving you because I gave you nothing I'm leaving you because I learned you nothing  I leave not to hurt you more  Why have you forgotten me? You trusted in god and he did nothing Why have you abandoned me? You acted without talking to me The selfishness of your act enrages me Why have you killed yourself? God is not here anymore  Walk...  I'm leaving you' cause death is my only exit I'm leaving you because I can no more I'm leaving you because life destroyed me I'm leaving you life is fucked up to me I'm leaving you because death is my last chance I'm leaving you because I'm already lost  I leave not to hurt you more  I leave you not  I leave to avoid my grief
