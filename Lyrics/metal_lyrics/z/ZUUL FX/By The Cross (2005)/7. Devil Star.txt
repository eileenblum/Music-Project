I wanna sign a pact with hell I wanna have the devil's mark Because I want to give my life... Wanna hear metal in my ears Want asses stuck by rotten pears Because I want to give my life to fucking rock'n'roll  Want the girls to touch themselves on me Want the girls to be punish' d for me Because I want to give my life Want' em to show their innerself Want the bitches to go down on me Because I want to give my life I want to drive a diablo car I want to be the biggest star Because I want to give my life to fucking rock'n'roll  I am a devil star You are devil stars  Want people to talk about me Want people to fuckin' hate me Because I want to give my life Wanna hear metal in my ears Want asses by rotten pears Because I want to give my life Want the girls to touch themselves on me Want the girls to be punish' d for me Because I want to give my life to fucking rock'n'roll  I have only followed the devil's says I never intend to say what he says I'm just a fool under the devil's hold I am just a fool I am a devil star
