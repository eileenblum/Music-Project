Anxiety comes again and dark thoughts come into my mind
I'm afraid of loneliness
I can't accept the fact that we have to die

TO DIE!!

My mind gently falls in a dream that is more and more conscious
The walls of my spirit are tightening and guiding me on a thrilling path
I'd like to run away but my mind is transported as if possessed
I feel death touching me, I cry

I CRY!!

Nothing is real [x2]
My mind gently falls in a dream
Nothing is real [x2]
Leave my body
Nothing is real [x2]
I just want to live and never die
Nothing is real [x2]

Anxiety makes me realize that life is short-lived
I am afraid of nights
I'm on the edge and I feel I die

I DIE!!

Little by little I see the importance of life with less innocence
The walls of my spirit come loose and guide me on the path
I'd like to get out of this deadly cold and live eternally
My body lets me down
I feel death touching me I cry

CRY!! [x3]

OH!!

Nothing is real [x2]
My mind gently falls in a dream
Nothing is real [x2]
Leave my body
Nothing is real [x2]
I just want to live and never die
Nothing is real [x2]

Nothing
