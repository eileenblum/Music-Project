A part of me got lost 
You've destroyed my life once 
My soul's been tom apart 
hate hunts me and parts 
The holy one wants me to kill 
Voices echo in me 
I have to reason myself and pardon me 
I feel the need to kill [x2] 

I'm nothing anymore

A part of me is broken 
M y desires were taken 
M y body is tom apart 
hate haunts me and parts 
The voice demands me to kill 
chaos echo in me 
I have to reason myself and pardon me 
I feel the need to kill 

I feel vibrations inside me 
But my heart is way from me 
I feel vibrations inside me 
Life's not life anymore 
I feel vibrations inside me 
But my heart is way from me 
I feel vibrations inside me 
I am nothing anymore
