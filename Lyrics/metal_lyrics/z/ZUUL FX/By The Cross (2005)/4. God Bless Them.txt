Every day booze drives our lives into a bloody violence Talks mean nothing in this phase where chaos reigns Oh no!!! Need to get away from this fuckin' life But how...I am too young...I can let down my fuckin' family!!! Fear petrifies me...I don't feel strong enough to leave this life  I have to get out of here Protect my folks from decadence...away from cries, violence But to get there...I have to sacrifice my life...for their own... Oh no!!! I have to get out of here Protect my folks from this decadence and sacrifice my life  God bless, god bless...  Need to get away from this fuckin'life But how...I am too young...I can't let down my fuckin' family!!! Life petrifies me...I'm not ready to live all my life alone  If only I could be ten more fuckin' years older I would leave them for sure in the gutter I'm so fuckin angry I could kill them for you like winners do But I am sure it is not the best thing to do I don't want to be in hometown jail like a motherfucker For those who deal with their grown ups life like fuckers I even thought drugs would help me to get out of this ugly world But fortunately for me i am not one of their stupid herd I have never requested to live but now that I'm among them  I only have one choice left :fight my ass off to get out of there  Oh no...  Life ,life, life ...
