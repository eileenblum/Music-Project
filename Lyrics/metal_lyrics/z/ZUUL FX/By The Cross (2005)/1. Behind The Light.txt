UUUURGH!! My senses disconnectA virus attacks what I protectNo cure, my body's almost coldMovie images I only hold Following a one-way trackThis moment oh so criticalGod is not here to welcome mePain is just a memory COME ON!! Almost lifeless now it's fearA light caresses me with heatMy body gets slowly destroyedI am gonna be destroyed All data taken by nothingnessMy soulmate is gone like deathLight exits in the darknessI'm almost dead, I am death I feel the cold Behind the light, I feel the coldBehind the light, oblivionBehind the light, I feel coldBehind the light UUURGHAA!! My senses disconnectA virus attacks what I protectNo cure my body's almost coldMovie images I only hold Following a one-way trackThis moment oh so criticalGod is not here to welcome mePain is just a memory COME ON!! BEHIND THE LIGHT!! Behind the light, I feel the coldBehind the light, oblivionBehind the light, I feel coldBehind the light
