I'm Satan's son
Brand with iron
Ring of hell
You will like it
Let me do it
Ink your flesh

I take the girl
They're going crazy
Burning witches
This boiling blood
Please call my dogs
Straight from hell

At the altar of judgement she sure cries
In her naked self she lights my fire
Sexy witch ypu burn my blade my body my soul I die

Where's the most beautiful creatures
You know...Go down on me...(x2)

Go ! Down ! On ! Me !
And show me the light !

I'm satan's son
Fuck like the beast
Flesh on flesh
Here comes the light
That girl's on fire
She's on fire

Put her through hell
They're going crazy
Burning hot
I feel her flesh
Please call my dogs
Straight from hell
