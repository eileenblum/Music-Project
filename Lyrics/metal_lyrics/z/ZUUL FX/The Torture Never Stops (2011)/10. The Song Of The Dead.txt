Yeah !
Girl,I'll show you what's on my side
The man you see
Is now a living dream
So much pain will give you a heart attack
Set yourself free baby,I got your back.

I'm the living dead,
Eyes that lie and watch you cry,
Love,a kind of eternal pain,
She screams,
Sing the song of the dead.

Yeah !
Girl,I'm the master of this road to hell,
Come follow the path of my desires.
Trust me,We're on the darkside tonight,
As you go down then you show me the light

Hey living dead girl,
Eyes that lie and watch you cry,
Hey living dead girl
Let's burn in this fire
