I'm a beast in evolution
I walk and walk under influence
Without compassion, hatred inflicted by injection
I'm a monster ,a pure product of your consumption

Everyone...
Everyone makes me sick
You got it ?
Individual ideal
Did you get it ?
Don't need anybody
Go...

I'm becoming a monster
I eat anything you give me
Torture never stops, pain is where my pleasure is.
Without pain, the beast would have no compassion
