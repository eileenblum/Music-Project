Elegy...
My heart dies to leave you.
My soul will be a chimera.
Our paths are crossed here.
If I could...I would Like...

Look at the bloody wounds
This would be the marks of the devil
In this world or the souls that confuse
Would we not,good and evil ?

Suffer...
Prayers do no return the damned
Crying does not back the dead
Our religions are old playwrights
If I could...I would like...
Elegy...
My heart dies to leave you.
My soul will be a chimera.
Our paths are crossed here.
If I could...I would Like...

In pain and blood.
Like zombies haunted
We are the children of the tombs of heroes.
Our names on the stone are the pride of the brave.
The pride of those who lead us right to the slaughter
