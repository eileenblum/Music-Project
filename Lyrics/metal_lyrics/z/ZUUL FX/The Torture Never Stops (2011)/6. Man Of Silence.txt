Man of silence,man of suffering
Why didn't I try something ... ?
My eyes look back on the past
why can I not move ?
Why... ?

You've got my soul !
I want to confront this evil time but I am not able to
I think about it again and again, can't stop...

Man of silence,man of suffering
Why didn't I try something ... ?
My eyes look back on the past
why can't I move ?
Why... ?

I'm nothing
I'm down
I don't understand anything
I think about it again and again
Can't stop
I think about it again and again

I think about it all the time
All those torments spoil my life
But I think about it all day long
And my eyes look back on the past
Why didn't I try something ... ?
Sad alone...
Quiet alone
Man of suffering
Under this weight without difficulty,
Does the world love you this much? Why are you so lonely ?
