Ten days to say it all
How many weeks have gone by here ?
Every day, I come back and see you get away from life
Every day, I take a deep breath at the door
Because I need you to see my best smile
What else anyway ? Can nobody help me here ?
Get away from life

Ten days for a few moments of consciousness
A thousand thanks would not be enough
To give back
What people here gave us for a little while
To keep those moments a little more
In this corridor maze,
How can you remember someone's fighting for its life...

How many weeks have you been getting checked here,
Every day,more tired and slowly losing your abilities
Your hair falling
When I hold you
I could never tell you
In this corridor maze,
How can you remember someone's fighting for its life...
