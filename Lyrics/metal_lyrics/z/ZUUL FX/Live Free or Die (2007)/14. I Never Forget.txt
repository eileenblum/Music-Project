Die! It doesn't matter what I did, I do not regret anything What I want to do with my life, I'll do it for me It doesn't matter all your acts, I do not regret you What is done is not to be done, you can't change that  Does anyone want to live that? Does anyoneI could not leave that, I can't believe that, don't forget I never forget...!!! I never forget...! Does anyone want to live that?Does anyone I could not leave that, I can't believe that, don't forget I'll always do what I want I would never be llike you I'll always do what I want, I will... I'd never do that for you  It doesn't matter who'll remain! I won't regret you Those who will speak about me! I won't hear them It doesn't matter what you say! I will not hear you What you think of me! I don't give a fuck!   Does anyone want to live that? Does anyone I could not leave that, I can't believe that, don't forget  I never forget...! I never forget...! Does anyone want to live that? Does anyone  I could not leave that, I can't believe that, don't forget
