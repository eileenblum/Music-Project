Nose in the dust I didn't choose this Having to be under the slyness of my father in law A mother tired by her past love failures manipulated, Blinded and obedient to this motherfucker She only had the choice to leave me like a martyr Suffering is nothing, I can't leave you I have to find something to say and leave   No way... Feel I have to leave Shut your mouth You're not my father I really feel I have to leave Because here is hell  14 years old, Closing my eyes was the best solution Too late to get back, fuck I don't cre My dreams are becoming distressing nightmares Life is a rip off and I'm being fooled The worst is yet to come, I'm growing older I know it, I don't care, I'll live anywhere I had to say!I had to leave!  No way... Feel I have to leave Shut your mouth You're not my father I really feel I have to leave Because here is hell  ...No one knows what to do with myself The head of the house has better plans for my life  No fucking way!...No one knows what to do with myself!
