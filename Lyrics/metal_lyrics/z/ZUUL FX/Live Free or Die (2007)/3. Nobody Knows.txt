Vulnerable and defenseless In the dephts of a world without noise and lifeless I feel my mind's been emptied and oppressed No!Abandoned in the dephts of a world without light, depressed I smell death taking my self Thousands of corpses above nothingness  Vice lies in chaos of fire and flames I smell death taking my self  My whole life is just pure sadness Fear's pushing me slowly to madness!Banned are those who have been through the dark No! I see the shadow of the dead dancing in the dark!I see his machines suffering, supreme visions of creatures mutating  Vice lies in chaos of fire and flames I smell death taking my self  No!No! Nobody knows Who I am! Why I am!  Vice lies in chaos of fire and flames I smell death taking my self
