I can't feel the worry we had inside 
Our bodies lose their strength 
Don't look down, look at me in the eyes 
Our hearts fly away in blue skies 
Time is freezing on our inner looks 
Forever is the hell of our lives in black 
Our minds gather our thoughts 
To let our suffering, to let our suffering hearts talk 

One breath of ours 
The moment to live in us 
Time suffers in us 
One breath of ours 
The moment to live fo us 
Time...time 

our breathes died from 
our bodies mixed to become one 
you are my angel, you are my angel 
I am your blood, I am your flesh 
Stone statue, you chose me as such, on earth 
Who is the god who could live in our eyes 
Not far from our hearts, far from the skies... 

One breath of ours 
The moment to live in us 
Time suffers in us 
One breath of ours 
The moment to live fo us 
Time...time
