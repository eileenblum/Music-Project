Why you chose this way?Tears of pain are breaking me down Why you left for infinity ...myself for all eternity!I'm not myself for all eternity! Lonely nights without sleep The only sunshine that I keep Star of my dreams you make me tremble You're burning my life like a candle Prisoner of my cage of glass You broke into my sanctuary's ice The cold caresses you my sexy and yet You chose to leave the nest  Why you choose this way?Why you choose this way?Why you choose this way?Tears of pain are breaking me down Why you choose this way?Why you left for infinity Why you choose this way?I'm not myself for all eternity!  Lonely nights without sleep The sunshine that I used to keep Stars of my dreams you lie in the skies You did not have this fire in your eyes The flames are releasing me You already burn half of me Condemned and giving up here You left me to infinity  Lonely nights without sleep The only sunshine that I keep Star of my dreams you make me tremble You're burning my life like a candle Prisoner of my cage of glass You broke into my sanctuary's ice The cold caresses you my sexy and yet You chose to leave the nest
