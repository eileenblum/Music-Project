Can't stand, this pain
His head, breaking
Bullets... falling...
Rotting... corpses...

Could not know that he would survive
His body spared from the fire
but this war lost his mind
Imaginary enemy from the mind
Hammering attack of grenadestorm

The tone of killing ringing in his head
Voices are demanding you to kill

KILL!

They tell, that only, death will liberate
So he pulls the trigger, and let's life fade away
