I have no plan and I have no idea
So I need someone, so I need someone
Not a particular circular thought
But one to fix this situation
Not a particular certain assault
Someone's good improvisation

How can I help you, my friend?
How much can you afford to spend?
No matter what, no matter when
I'll bring you everything I can

Yes, yes, I need a smart solution now
Yes, yes, it has been done right now somehow
Yes, yes, legal or illegal, I don't care right now

Call the, call the Russian people
Get it from the Russian people
I can stick, oh, I can stick, can stick with it
Come on with a brick

Call the, call the Russian people
Get it from the Russian people
I can stick, oh, I can stick, can stick with it
Come with a brick, call the, call the Rasputin

Cash is king, that's my advice
I give no credit, that's my price
No matter what, no matter when
You'll get it soon, follow the plan

It's safe to say, this deal does pay
I guarantee delivery without delay
I gotta situation here
You gotta make it disappear

Gonna get 'em, yes, he's gone
He's gonna get 'em, brick in his hand, he's gonna get 'em
I left some dirt behind
Can you clear up this mess?, Yeah, you're my man

I heard they got 'em, yes, he's gone
Because they got 'em, they are gone
Because they got 'em, I gotta get gone
Because they got 'em, get gone, I get up

Get up, get up, get up and come
Get up and come, get up and come
And come, baradum, baradum, baradum
Baradum, baradum, baradum, baradum
