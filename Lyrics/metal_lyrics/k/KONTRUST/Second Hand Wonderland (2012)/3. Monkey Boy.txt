Late at night I'm hypnotized
I stop to hide
From this tempting life

I need a dread for my bed
Need a bed without dread
I need another place inside
Where I can hide
Need a med for ma head
Need a head for ma med
I need another piece of bliss to leave this behind

I'm running outside,
I pass through the night
Man, push it!
Push it!
Redefined!
I'm using my time, I'm out on the rise

Gonna crash another
Wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked night

Monkey boy, I like your magic toy,
This is my greatest joy
It makes me uahaha-uaha
Monkey boy, your madness does annoy,
This time I will destroy
You make me uahaha-uaha

Late at night I start the fight
I need a game that I tame
Need to tame all the games
I need to find another way to break the design
We need a street to deplete
Need to deplete the streets
We need another way inside escape from confines

Get out of my sight
I'm playing for time
Men, I reinvent, redesigned
I'm loosing my mind, recalling my life

Gonna crash another
Wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked night

Monkey boy, I like your magic toy,
This is my greatest joy
It makes me uahaha-uaha
Monkey boy, your madness does annoy,
This time I will destroy
You make me uahaha-uaha

Monkey boy, I like your magic toy,
This is my greatest joy
It makes me uahaha-uaha
Monkey boy, your madness does annoy,
This time I will destroy
You make me uahaha-uaha

Un, un, un, dos, tres
I'm doing better, better
Un, dos, dos, dos, tres, doing better
Un, dos, tres, tres, tres
I'm doing better, better
Un, dos, tres, no stress, feeling better

Monkey boy, I like your magic toy,
This is my greatest joy
It makes me uahaha-uaha
Monkey boy, I like your magic toy,
This is my greatest joy
It makes me uahaha-uaha
Monkey boy, your madness does annoy,
This time I will destroy
You make me uahaha-uaha

Monkey boy, I like your magic toy,
This is my greatest joy
It makes me uahaha-uaha
Monkey boy, your madness does annoy,
This time I will destroy
You make me uahaha-uaha
