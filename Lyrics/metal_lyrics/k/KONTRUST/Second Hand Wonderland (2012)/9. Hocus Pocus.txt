We will entertain your mind
With our slight of hand
The tight rope will sag
With the weight of your fears tonight

Abra, abra cadabra, sim-simsalabim salabim
Abra, abra cadabra, hocus-pocus fidibus

No, no, no, never, never
Never, never let you go, go, go
Come on in and join our big top
I am your only ringmaster

Everyone will leave here bewitched
Your pulse going faster
Yes, it's magic, must be magic
Pure black magic that we cannot control

Spooky, spooky hider somewhere in the dark
Spooky, spooky hider somewhere in the dark
Spooky shadow hider, show your voodoo heart

Our clowns steal your smiles as you
Laugh won't you come and enjoy
Your lions they will dance to the sound
Of the crack of the tamers whip

Spooky shadow hider show your voodoo heart
Abra cadabra, hocus-pocus fidibus
