Oh, father tell me why
It was not his time
He was so wild, so strong
And now he's forever gone

Wake up
wake up
It can't always be the same
Wake up
A hidden face won't stop the rain

I'm going back in time
When life was easy, just fine
There's nothing we couldn't win
Never stop chasing the wind

There's no one to blame
For the lapse of a flame
There's so much left but still I am
I'm falling a-a-part-part, a-a-part-part

I'm falling down to the ground
Falling down on my knees
There's nothing more to achieve
I'm falling down, down

I'm falling down to the ground
Falling down on my knees
Loosing faith, loosing me
I'm falling down, down

Go now start to preach the same
Watch out, watch out life can't complain

Oh, father tell me how
How can I bear this pain
He's so much more than a friend
Now I am going insane

Wake up
Wake up
It can't always be the same
Wake up
A hidden face wonât stop the rain

I can still hear him say
That life is just a game
Tell me why did he loose
Now everything is in vain

Memories in a frame
Forever calling your name
There is so much left but still I am
I'm falling a-a-part-part, a-a-part-part

I'm falling down to the ground
Falling down on my knees
There's nothing more to achieve
I'm falling down, down

I'm falling down to the ground
Falling down on my knees
Loosing faith, loosing me
I'm falling down, down

Go now start to preach the same
Watch out, watch out life can't complain
Go now try to reach the same
Watch out, watch out life can't complain

Come, come around listen to what I say
Spit out, spit out, throw them away
Come, come around listen to what I say
Spit out your fears, give them away

I'm falling down to the ground
Falling down on my knees
There's nothing more to achieve
I'm falling down, down

I'm falling down to the ground
Falling down on my knees
Loosing faith, loosing me
I'm falling down, down

Go now start to preach the same
Watch out, watch out life can't complain
Go now try to reach the same
Watch out, watch out life can't complain
