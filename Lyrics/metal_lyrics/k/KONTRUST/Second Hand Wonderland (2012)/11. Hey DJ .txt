I don't want to stand around
DJ, please put on some sounds
And he said this, this, this
Is the next sound generation

I can't hear my favorite sounds
DJ, turn the music loud
And he said this this this
Is the next sound generation

Body, body bouncing, this is our mission
Hey DJ, hey DJ, hey DJ

Don't play me a punk song
Or scream all night long
Just want a machine song
Heavy riff with heavy bass and metal tongue

Don't play me a pop song
Or cry all night long
Just want a machine song
Heavy riff with heavy bass and metal tongue

I just want to mosh around
DJ, spin black circles round
And he said this, this, this
Is the next sound generation

Body, body bouncing, this is our mission
Hey DJ, hey DJ, hey DJ

Don't play me a punk song
Or scream all night long
Just want a machine song
Heavy riff with heavy bass and metal tongue

Don't play me a hip-hop song
Or bob all night long
Just want a machine song
Heavy riff with heavy bass and metal tongue

Random rhythm bam
Bam crashin', crashin' to
Random rhythm bam
Bam crashin', crashin' to

Spread eyes, new sound out now
Out to the spread eyes
New sound the rhythm and beat
Are not catchin' me, catching me

Spread eyes, new sound out now
Out to the spread eyes
New sound the rhythm
And beat are not catchin' me, catching me
