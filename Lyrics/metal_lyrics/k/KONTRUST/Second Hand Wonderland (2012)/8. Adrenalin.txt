I can't take a break, I cannot break with it
I cannot break it and I break in, would you break in with me?
I can't take a break, I cannot break with it
I feel more awake, I can't break it off

This is how we are, this is how we live
Why do you look at me this way?
This is how we are
But there's no reason to feel ashamed

I can't take a break, I cannot break with it
I cannot break it and I break in
Would you break in with me?
Adrenalin, adrenalin, adrenalin, adrenalin

I can't take a break, I can't break it off
I feel so awake, I can't break it off
When I was a young boy and I was with other boys
We were bored, we ignored, didn't care much about rules

Now I'm older but still can't resist temptation
So I keep this secret still alive we came
We came along, came along
This little house, no one inside

We broke in we got out but didn't take a thing
The only thing we took with us adrenalin
Adrenalin, adrenalin, adrenalin, adrenalina
Adrenalin, adrenalin, adrenalin, adrenalina

Adrenalin another adrenalin
Another address and I break in
Would you break in with me?
Adrenalin, adrenalin, adrenalin, adrenalin
