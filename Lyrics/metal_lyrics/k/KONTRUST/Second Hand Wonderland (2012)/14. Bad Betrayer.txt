Heya-heya, you're a bad betrayer
Heya-hey, I'm gonna shoot you down
You saya-saya, you're my only player
You're loud and proud, stop pushing me around

See that the rhythm of your heartbeat goes up
And once again pumping again a beat up
See my beaten rhythm, getting closer to full stop
Gimme just a pump, for one pump, for life

Boy, you betta getta, gotta get another girl
Boy, you betta getta, gotta get another girl
Another girl, another girl, another girl

See that the rhythm of your heartbeat goes up
And once again pumping again a beat up
See my beaten rhythm, it is nearly near full stop
Gimme just a pump, for one pump, for life

Heya-heya, you're a bad betrayer
Heya-hey, I'm gonna shoot you down
Johnny boy, you're not my heart's desire
Maybe boy, one day you'll understand

Same thing, goddamn same thing
You try to fault my fault
So you jump to one side of the fence
Goddamn fence that we had built up
Everyone knows it separates every love

Hahaha, laugh at me if you want
Hahaha, tell me what's wrong
Hahaha, what is my fault?
Hahaha, tell me what's wrong
