So raise me up, raise me up
Don't watch me fall down
Don't tear me down
Don't tear me down

I can't eat, can't drink
Don't wanna sleep now
Since the day and night
You changed me somehow

We break up and I'm down, down, down
I go down, down, down, raise me up

So raise me up, raise me up
I think of you once again
I go down, down, down, down
So raise me up, raise me up
I think of you once again
I go boom, boom, boom, burn

You sing loud, live fast
Boom, boom beats my heart
Take another step I heard
I've heard of someone
I heard that someone showed you
How to find your heart again

Step by step again realize my fears are gone
I had you had a hard fall but we're living on
We break up and I'm down, down, down
I go down, down, down, raise me up

Come on, come on
I hate the break between us
Come on, come on
Let's take the next step forward
Come on, come on, come on, come on

So raise me up, raise me up
I think of you once again
I go down, down, down, down
So raise me up, raise me up
You make me think of you once again
I go boom, boom, boom, burn

So raise me up, raise me up
I think of you once again
You got me down, down, down, down
So raise me up, raise me up
You make me think of you once again
I go boom, boom, boom, burn

Raise me up, raise me up
I go down, down, down
Raise me up, raise me up
I go boom, boom, burn
