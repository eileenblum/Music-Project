Whenever shadows are fading
Whenever night ends the day
There comes the time of a business
That's either blessing or decay

Whenever law has a timeout
When single rights must be paid
There are no more neighbours in
The neighbourhood, only the cops aren't afraid

And with the pimps and the bosses
The cops are hatching a plot
No one would ever expect this

They take, take their part
They just take their part
They take, take their part
They are just a part

I, if I only could fly away
If I only could fly away
If I only could fly away

Step back, police, step back
Police, step back, police
Lay the law down
Step back, police, step back
Police, step back, police

Get outta way now
(Bad boys, bad boys, what you gonna do?)
Step back, police, step back
Police, step back, police

Get your guns down
Step back, police, step back
Police, step back, police
Cops are in town

Whenever birds start their daylife
Whenever silence takes a rest
Newspaper spreading their headlines
Another criminal investigation and no arrest

Whenever old ladies ask
A man in an uniform for help
It takes a moment for him
To realize he can't hold out his hand

And no one's here to protect us
The devil's coming to town
Justice is not for the poor folks
I should start running away

They take, take their part
They just take their part
They take, take their part
They just play their part

I, if I only could change their ways
If they only would feel ashamed
Could this world be a better place?
If I only could change these days

But I only can run away
If I only could fly away
