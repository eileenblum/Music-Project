Everything we tell all the people is a blood stained lie
Everything we don't tell in the end is a whole lot more
Everything is under control - don't be afraid - don't be afraid
Everything you're afraid of is under our control
Bleedin out for the stars - Is that all that you want?
Bleedin pride to be proud - String along
Ta -ta- take'em under stripes right home
Bleedin out for the stars - Bleedin out here were we are
Bleedin pride to be proud - String along
Ta -ta- take'em under stripes right home
Cease the fire now!
Bring'em out , send'em back!
Everything we try is to help you to get out of this
Every single time we help you we know not what we do
Everything will be better when we leave, we promise
Everything we promise to better canât get any worse
Somebody put me down here in Vietnam, Gaza, Afghanistan
Somebody put me down here in Japan, Korea and Sudan
Somebody put me down here in Iraq, Iran for what the ( f***)
Somebody with another idea?
Send off yourself, can't stand this no more
/ I feel so guilty
/ I feel so misunderstood
Bleedin out for the stars - Is that all that you want?
Bleedin pride to be proud - String along
Ta -ta- take'em under stripes right home
Bleedin out for the stars - Bleedin out here were we are
Gonna go back to Cuba â Guantanamo
ParaÃ­so de la idiotez â removed from the slide show
Bleedin out for the stars - Is that what you call peace?
G â gonna â g â g â g- gonna
G â gonna â g â g â g- gonna - gonna
Cease the fire now!
Bring'em out , send'em back!
Push it by the, push it by the, push it by the same one
Same, by the same, by the shabby, dun machine gun
By the, push it by the, push it by the, push it on the long run
Got da same, got da same got da shabby same outcome
Push it by - push it by the same one
Push it by - push it on the long run
Push it by - push it by the same one
Push it by - push it on the long run
Push it by the, push it by the, push it by the same
Got da same, got da same got da shabby same outcome
