I close my eyes - donÂ´t know what will be
Every night - I dream that I am free
Watching lonely tv - but thereâs nothing to see
Nobody with me, I loose belief suddenly
In my head thereâs a hole I drink too much alcohol
My thoughts make me ill - I need a break
Get up â wanna get a bit closer
Get up â wanna get a bit closer
Get up â wanna get a bit closer
I dreamed the night away
One step - one got a bit closer
One closer to the day
Get up â wanna get a bit closer
I dreamed the night away
One step â Do you feel a bit closer?
One closer to your fate?

Flying high - breaking limits - breaking times
Night minds - forever floating thru the skies

I close my eyes - donÂ´t know what will be
IÂ´m searching for god â every night in my thoughts
I break up with life, donÂ´t tell me how to survive
Nothin makes sense, cause I loose confidence
My thoughts make me ill - I need a break
Show me another way
Goodness of the contemplation
Dance, keep the dance
Of the personal rotation
Get up â wanna get a bit closer
I dreamed the night away
One step - one got a bit closer
One closer to the day
Get up â wanna get a bit closer
I dreamed the night away
One step â Do you feel a bit closer?
One closer to your fate?

Flying high - breaking limits - breaking times
Night minds - forever floating thru the skies

Get out! - Get out! - Free one!
They wanna get a get a
Get out! - Get out! â become!
She wanna seek â wanna kinda new mind, know no confines
Drop all the hate you felt for so many times
Only want to stay alive - IÂ´ll stay alive
I gotta fight this time - donÂ´t really wanna fail
stay alive - donÂ´t really wanna fail - stay alive
CanÂ´t you canÂ´t you see?
Get up â wanna get a bit closer
I dreamed the night away
One step - one got a bit closer
One closer to the day
Get up â wanna get a bit closer
I dreamed the night away
One step â Do you feel a bit closer?
One closer to your fate?

Flying high - breaking limits - breaking times
Night minds - forever floating thru the skies
