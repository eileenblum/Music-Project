one forbidden touch
and one drink too much
different skin I felt
my possessions melt
oh donÂ´t regret this kiss
such a short-time bliss
man I need much more
nothing will be like before
Will I stand right here forever?
In the middle of nowhere.
Talk to me â should I stay or will you leave?
Talk to me â I think of her but you donât think of me
moments passing by
hands are touching shy
take a sip of wine
donÂ´t regret this time
I look back and wait
everything was straight
now I loose control
nothing will be like before
IÂ´m standing here forever
IÂ´m feeling you nowhere
Talk to me â talk to me - should I stay or will you leave?
Talk to me â talk to me - I think of her but you donât think of me
IÂ´m standing here forever
IÂ´m standing here forever
Talk to me â talk to me - I canât share you - you donât belong to me
Talk to me - talk to me - donât replace me with a memory
Talk to me - Take my hand
Talk to me â talk to me - should I stay or will you leave?
