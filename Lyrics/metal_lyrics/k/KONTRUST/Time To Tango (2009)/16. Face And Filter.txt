Maybe you suffer â cause you missed the sale
Your hair needs a new cut â and so does your brain
Your boobs are not real your man pays the bill
You're playinÂ´ his bunny you're stuck on the pills
Waste money from mummy youÂ´re looking so cute
Shameless you are â abject your attitude
Keep movin your hips and get out of your dress
For money and headlines you show us your chest

Babies and ladies I donât like your style
Youâre wasting your money â youâre wasting your time
Your triumph still remains to be seen
- do you know what I mean? - do you know what I mean?

Maybe you suffer â maybe I care
Maybe you suffer - maybe I care

IÂ´m crawlin back - to protect you
You are wack youÂ´re so untrue
Crawlin back to release you
Leave your old life and break-through
Crawlinâ back, crawlinâ back - I will fade to black â crawlinâ back
IÂ´m here to protect you

Ladies IÂ´m sorry for lookinâ at you,
my style is not cute and my shoes are not new
my mates are in bands nâthe stage is my home
Keep movin' my hips to track in the tone

Babies and ladies I donât like your style
Youâre wasting your money â youâre wasting your time
Your triumph still remains to be seen
- do you know what I mean? - do you know what I mean?

Maybe you suffer â maybe I care
Maybe you suffer - maybe I care

IÂ´m crawlinâ back - to protect you
You are wack youÂ´re so untrue
Crawlinâ back to release you
Leave your old life and break-through
Crawlinâ back, crawlinâ back - I will fade to black â crawlinâ back
IÂ´m here to protect you

Crawlinâ back, crawlinâ back - I will fade to black â crawlinâ back
IÂ´m here to protect you
