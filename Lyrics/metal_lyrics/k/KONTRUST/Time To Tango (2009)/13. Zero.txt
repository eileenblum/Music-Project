You canÂ´t give me more than I - I wanted from you
You just tell me all these cold words, your lieâs getting true
You see more inside of me than I wanted to show
You canât give me more than I need â donât want you to go
See the past, see the past, see the past see that everythingâs broken
Itâs over and out
Keepinâ next, keepinâ next, keepinâ next, keeping everyone next to me - shut them out!
Can you find out
I canÂ´t find out
Why are tears droppin loud
Iâm frozen without you
Can you find out
I canÂ´t find out
Why silence surrounds
Iâm frozen without you
Left me in the moonlight tonight, I am fading like a rose
You would never be a part of me now
Can you stop talking â Can you stop talking
Give up, give up - stop shedding tears just break with me
Cause I can not find out â forgive, but my loveÂ´s running out
See the past, see the past, see the past see that everythingâs broken
Itâs over and out
Keepinâ next, keepinâ next, keepinâ next, keeping everyone next
Eyoh, E-eyoh, E-e-eyoh, E-eyoh
Can you find out
I canÂ´t find out
Why are tears droppin loud
Iâm frozen without you
Can you find out
I canÂ´t find out
Why silence surrounds
Iâm frozen without you
Eyoh, E-eyoh, E-e-eyoh, E-eyoh
Donât you find a reason?
I could try â but I want forget itÂ !
Donât you find a reason?
Thereâs one - no doubt about it!
Steppin on the brake
I canât say yes, when I should say no
Steppin on the brake
From time to time Iâm crashing
Can you find out
I canÂ´t find out
Why are tears droppin loud
Iâm frozen without you
Can you find out
I canÂ´t find out
Why silence surrounds
Iâm frozen without you
Can you find out
I canÂ´t find out
Why are tears droppinâ loud
Iâm frozen without you
I can not find out
Youâll never find out
To lose means to live
Iâm better without you
