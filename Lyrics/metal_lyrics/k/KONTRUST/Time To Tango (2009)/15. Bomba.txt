dream on

You can persist
and I can resist
but I build my own castle
build it out of air
I've got the key
and you've got to see that
nightmares are never fair

You see I see nothing
A â I â E â I â A â I â E â I - O
You see I see nothing
A â I â E â I â A â I â E â I - O

I can resist and do you know what?
I can resist and do you know what?
I can resist and do you know what?
I am your daydreamer

I close my eyes
Don't wake me up
I close my eyes
I feel the dark
I close my eyes
DonÂ´t wake me
Turn off the lights

You can persist
and I can resist
but Iâve never ever tried
to fade out the real thing
Somethingâs for sure
and some things are fact that
you canât reject, neglect

Come what comes!
Lights will shine - Won't you follow me?
Cold sweat - cold ice
Come on! Come on what comes!

I can resist and do you know what?
I can resist and do you know what?
I can resist and do you know what?
I am your daydreamer

I close my eyes
Don't wake me up
I close my eyes
I feel the dark
I close my eyes
DonÂ´t wake me
Turn off the lights
