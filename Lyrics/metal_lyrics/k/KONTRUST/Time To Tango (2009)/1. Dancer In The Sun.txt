DANCER IN THE SUN
We come along we bring the Kontrust on the run
With another song going like this
Watch! - Another da da dancer in the sun!
Thereâs another one going my way!
You wanna these, and these, and these indeed?
Hereâs another one out on display!
You need a day, need another day, days and days to decide youâre going my way?
you creep along the street, no idea what you need
you never take a chance a lone wolf in a sense
you never scream out, donÂ´t wanna be loud
you stop before you start, you'd rather stay apart
you hide your face scared of your mind
you hide your face from the brighter side
you hide your face but i know youâll
open up your eyes
We come to you
We come to you
We come along we bring the Kontrust on the run
With another song going like this
Watch! - Another da da dancer in the sun!
ThereÂ´s another one going my way!
You wanna these, and these, and these indeed?
HereÂ´s another one out on display!
Take today, take another day, days and days to decide youÂ´re going my way
you could do anything, you could be anyone
you could go anywhere - no limits, only fun
come on and take your chance - life a is sweet romance
get away from it all - lets party - start the show
I will show you - new dimensions
IÂ´ll realize your secret visions
If you give me all your fears youâll open up your eyes
We come to you
We come to you
We come along we bring the Kontrust on the run
With anther song going like this
Watch! - Another da da dancer in the sun!
ThereÂ´s another one going my way!
You wanna these, and these, and these indeed?
HerÂ´s another one out on display!
You want days, want another day, days and days to decide youâre going my way?
I donât need a reason
I wonât take it down
I can see you falling
in a body to the ground
I donât need a reason
I wonât take it down
I can see you falling
in a body to the ground
We come along we bring the Kontrust on the run
With anther song going like this
Watch! - Another da da dancer in the sun!
ThereÂ´s another one going my way!
You wanna these, and these, and these indeed?
HereÂ´s another one out on display!
You got a day, got another day, days and days to decide youÂ´re going my way
