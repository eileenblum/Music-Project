All I have - all I possess and all I want is on my back
Never ever and forever I would stop and leave my track
You try to get, to get, to come to, to get on the throne
I can do the same without the cash, can do the same alone
Live life
live loud
with one another
I am - I am on the run
Run on â sto-stop it now
Leave it all - leave it undone
I am - I am on the run
I keep on walking through the world
At all the nights, and all day long
Sometimes I think it's time to think about the things going wrong
You have to set, to set, it's time for you to set to work
I think the one who pleads for settling down here is a jerk
Live live
live loud
with one another
I am - I am on the run
Run on â sto - stop it now
Leave it all - leave it undone
I am - I am on the run
Live live
live loud
with one another
I am - I am on the run
Run on â sto - stop it now
Leave it all - leave it undone
I am - I am on the run
No me gusta
Mariju - mariju - marijujuana
Mariju - mariju - marijujuana
Mariju - mariju - marijujuana
Juana - juana â juana
Live live
live loud
with one another
I am - I am on the run
Run on â sto - stop it now
Leave it all - leave it undone
I am - I am on the run
