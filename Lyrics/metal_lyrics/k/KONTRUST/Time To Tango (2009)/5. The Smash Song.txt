Weâre acting under pressure
Why shouldnât we go on?
We find again - there's an intrusion â conclusion
In isolation
Initiating pressure
Should we turn it on?
We want to turn it on!
See what you got!
We brought!
See what you got!
Turn it on!
See what you got!
We brought!
Leave this - You can't leave all this undone.
Gotta new source
New source of energy
Smash into your world smash into you
Blast you with my voice I make you move
Make you jump up higher, get you higher, jump up higher like I do
Won't you get, won't you get up - wo
Won't you let it out?
Won't you get up, get up - wo
Won't you jump around?
Your inspiration
It fills us with your passion
Can we pass it on?
We want to pass it on!
See what you got!
We brought!
See what you got!
Turn it on!
See what you got!
We brought!
Leave this - You can't leave all this undone.
Gotta new source
New source of energy
Smash into your world, smash into you
Blast you with my voice I make you move
Make you jump up higher, get you higher, jump up higher like I do
Smash into your world - smashing into you
Smash into your world - smashing into you
Smash into your world, smash into you
Blast you with my voice I make you move
Make you jump up higher, get you higher, jump up higher like I do
Make you jump up higher, get you higher, jump up higher like I do
Make you jump up higher, get you higher, jump up higher like I do
