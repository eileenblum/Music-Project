When I feel that you feel that I am really sharp
- then I wait for your move â are you gonna start?
When I feel that you feel that I'm your missing part
- then you come - then you come, come into my heart!
Pa da da da da - pa da da da da
welcome to my life - welcome welcome to chaos
I am the one who's falling for you
welcome to my life - welcome welcome to chaos
to his damn chaos - to his damn chaos
Today â day - day - you look sad why can't you see this
I see you see that we feel we can't repeat it
When I see when I see when I see that you're gone
I miss my credit card, miss my wallet, miss my car
Pa da da da da - pa da da da da
Pa da da da da - pa da da da da
I am hot - I am lazy - I would come with you baby
show me your cash and I'll make you crazy!
welcome to my life - welcome welcome to chaos
Iâm not the one who's falling for you
welcome to my life - welcome welcome to chaos
to his damn chaos - to his damn chaos
welcome to my life - welcome welcome to chaos
Youâre falling â youâre falling
Well blow me down!
Well shoot me down!
I am the one who's falling for you
Well blow me down!
Well shoot me down!
I am the one who's falling
Pa da da da da - pa da da da da
I am the one who's falling
Pa da da da da - pa da da da da
Iâm falling â Iâm falling
