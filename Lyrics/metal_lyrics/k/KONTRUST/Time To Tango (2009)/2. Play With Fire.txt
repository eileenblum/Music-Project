Foresee da mix - consider you brake in
Get is what you take away
around - around - around the clock
Together more better
More better the dayâs income
Bring the calm
Bring income da cop is under way
Hit the road â Down the road â town patrol - is under way
cop - cop - cops are on their way
when everybody robs
whenever we're caving in
when everybody burns
the bridges and tries to flee
when everyone is thrilled
we only do this for fun
We take away
We take away
We take away from anyone
I play with fire
I take a last look back
Weâre starting to attack
I burn like fire
I play with fire
I love an evil man
I love his evil plan
I play with fire
Around - around - around the clock
Get is what you take away
around - around - around the clock
Together more better
More better the dayâs income
Bring the calm
Bring income da cop is under way
Hit the road â Down the road â town patrol - is under way
cop - cop - cops are on their way
whenever we imagine
that we both can feel safe
we start to give away
and squander the easy prey
whenever we strike back
we only do this for fun
We take away
We take away
We take away from anyone
I play with fire
I take a last look back
Weâre starting to attack
I burn like fire
I play with fire
I love an evil man
I love his evil plan
I play with fire
Ladies and Gentlemen â welcome to the fast beat â beat - beat
Comin on my side we gonna run to seed
We run to seedâ to run to seed
Comin - around that site â around that side - around that side
Boa â boa â boa â sita
Boa â boa â boa â tribe
Boa â boa â boa â sita
Boa â boa â boa - ride
around - around - around the clock
Get is what you take away
around - around - around the clock
Together more better
More better the dayâs income
Bring the calm
Bring income da cop is under way
Hit the road â Down the road â town patrol - is under way
cop - cop - cops are on their way
when everybody robs
whenever we're caving in
when everybody burns
the bridges and tries to flee
when everyone is thrilled
we only do this for fun
We take away
We take away
We take away from anyone
I play with fire
I take a last look back
Weâre starting to attack
I burn like fire
I play with fire
I love an evil man
I love his evil plan
I play with fire
