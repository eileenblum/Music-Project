[originally by Megadeth]You take a mortal man,
And put him in control
Watch him become a god,
Watch peoples heads a'roll
A'roll...

[Chorus:]
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes,
Swaying to the Symphony...
Of Destruction

Acting like a robot,
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse,
Before the head explodes
Explodes...

[Chorus]

The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A'warring for the heavens,
A peaceful man stands tall
Tall...

[Chorus]
