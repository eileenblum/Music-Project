[performed by Katalepsy]Wounds. Compound fractures. Internal organs outside
I see a lifeless killed body on the ground
Pieces of flesh scattered within a radius of ten meters
What has happened here?

I close my eyes
Bright flash
I'm falling down
In this hell

A young woman went back home in the night
A victim for distracted killers
Exited by the appearance of a beautiful woman
He insensibly follows her
The hands around her neck suffocate her
She had no time even to scream

And I see her eyes full
Of feebleness, hopelessness and agony
He violently stripes off her dress
And cut her flesh

I can do nothing, can't change the past
I'm paralyzed with fear
Because of this horrible action
Of brutality and shabby lust

I could not take this anymore
I wanted to get out of this hell
But I can't, and I see all
Femicide

I close my eyes
Bright flash
I'm falling down
In this hell
Again
