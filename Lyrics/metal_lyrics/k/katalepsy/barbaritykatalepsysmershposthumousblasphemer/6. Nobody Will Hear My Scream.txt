[performed by Katalepsy]I open my eyes in the dark room
I am suspended for the hands
After chains made a gloomy gnash
I thought that this is the end

Cold sweat punches
Up to the bones
My body is shivering
I'm waiting for something dreadful

Silence
I'm falling down
I leave behind
Nobody will hear my scream

I beg for mercy
My screams only get him
His eyes are burning
That's all my forces have run low
I want this to be finished

Nobody will hear my scream
I can do nothing
Everything is useless
I close my eyes
I'm doomed
