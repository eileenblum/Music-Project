It's known, they are not the first,
who trying to substitute life values.
Gradually they interweaved deception and fear,
which help them to control us,
Control us by poisoning from within.

Repugnance and horror
are the mainspring of their desires.
While we permit them
to suffocate ourselves by lie,
self-cerement in hypocrisy,
sing psalms to treachery,
they be lords of not-our lives,
masters of not-our world.
It's their well guarded secret.
It's our well forgotten truth.

Willfully we put on manacles of submission,
the disease is inside ourselves.
It will be gone when we stop to fear,
it will espace when we open our eyes.
There is no disease except us.

My hatred has no name.
I'll cut-throat my weakness
and teach you how to do it.
Where the cure is helpless,
it's necessary to act by fire and sword -
bewitched meat must be torn out.
We'll pass the boundaries of this cramped world together
and take a look from below.
Truth comes to light - it's fuel for our hatred.

They shall not leave
nor surrender without a battle.
Neither self-healing nor miracle.
This is never-ending.
We can wake up only
through pain and bereavements.
Tear the sheep's coat and thrust
the wolves' canines into shepherd.
This is not whim, it's a matter of survival.
But they shall not release the slaves.
Flock waits other fate.
They've got only knife for the sheep.
Gore Conspiracy!
