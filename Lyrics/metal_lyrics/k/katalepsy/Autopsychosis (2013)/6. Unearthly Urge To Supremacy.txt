Extraterrestrial beings have become
frequent visitors of the earth.
So far they are concealed,
they only scrutinize humans
without destroying their Eden.

They carry out experiments with us,
trying to breed with us,
to adapt faster to our living conditions.

Their sons are already among us,
half-humans, half-aliens.

The unearthly bloodlust is what reveals
their origin at dusk.
This time we shouldn't sleep!

Remind your headache the sunset dream.
That was the time
they've been torturing your fragile body.
It takes no effort for them to kill
human by disintegrating his being.
But they won't be able
to fit this planet without us.

Human body is only the cover
for their real aspect.
Visible strength is a visual deceit.
Our fears - their inhabitancy.
