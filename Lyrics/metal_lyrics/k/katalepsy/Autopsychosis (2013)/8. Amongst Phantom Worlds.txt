I revolted with the Earth in Uncertainty and without a name.
I have lived my lives without counts.
My life - just a second of a dream in transstellar space,
a little stop on a way from one unknown Chasm to the other.

Fragile pulsation of my anti-life -
vagueness of crystal-clear Oblivion
from which the temptress-life has called
me for one short and unfortunate instant.

In a frenzy of despair, in oppressive dismal atmosphere
of seclusion, in a lack of interest in life,
without stimulus, yearnings and hopes
I continue my way through Deep Space
and Parallel Horizons neither dead nor dreaming.

Thousand times for one my breath
Madness and Unmadness has traded places.
I'm - a source of Unpurity.
My World - a veil which hid cosmic Chaos.
I'm ritual reiterate Dead World's Mantra:
"That is not dead which can eternal lie
And with strange aeons even Death may die"

Magical blood rises from the depths of my heart.
I revive the World with my blood.
I call my Name by myself.
