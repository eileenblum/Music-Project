Exhaling stench like smoldering sepulchral fire
of leaving generations,
humanity shall leave the borders drawn for it.
The calmness has gone away,
torn to pieces by shouts.
The word collapses under the tire skies.

The broken phantoms with dull lacklustre eyes
that look into themselves are roaming the streets.
Ominous humility on calm dead faces.

The repercussion of soul freezing
cries and disgusting bone crunch walk like
echo in aborted wombs of devastated megalopolises.
The corpses from the dead worlds,
which had a cities like ulcers, swollen
porous parcels of the decaying
flesh and crumbling bones, too awful to be buried.

Here they are Adam's sons and daughters.

"The worm is spread under you, and worms cover you". [Isajah 14:11]
