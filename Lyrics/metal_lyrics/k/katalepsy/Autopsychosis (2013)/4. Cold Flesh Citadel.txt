The citadel of decline
and plunder with the abandoned and leaved
bastions of consciousness.
The cold tower of flesh which used to be a human being.

The all-conquering dust eaten soul away.
The invading horror built a nest within eye-sockets.
The barbed wire of memoirs twisted around neck.
The skull fills with indeterminate but depraved stench.
Defilement, memory's sacrilege
and spasm of mind. Your heart vomits out slime.
Reflectory emasculation and feverish lobotomy.

Convulsively dipping into sucking caverns
of thirst disgusting Emptiness,
you try to expel legions of the stiffened dead men
from the Houses of Eternal Rest.

The sleep of reason
produces monsters.

The sleeper must awaken
