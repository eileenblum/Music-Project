The shapeless nightmare in center of Chaos,
which abominable curls and boil
in the heart of Infinity, in incomprehensible dark
chambers out of Time.
There, where do not reach our dreams,
creations which in the Ancient Times poisoned
conception of Time, choking with white
bones of endless generations.

Kaleidoscope of epochs is a moment
of slumber for Them.
You shouldn't even try to imagine Their
fragments of life to save common sense and soul.
Tormented by severe hunger They
rush though deserted dimensions
to Other Worlds and Other Stars.

Copulating with emptiness
They erupt hordes of poisoned shadows, raping our dreams.
Their spilling semen burns hungry Black Holes in space,
devouring Suns and Galaxies.

Once the nightmare will find a way
outside and becomes a daymare.
Gods will shudder in compassion to
our Reality in cause of such
loathing is in her secret womb.

The Ancient Ones will rise
and will be among us. The champing repulsive
paste of a living flesh.
The horror which is beyond all human representations.
Horror absorbing and digesting mind, body and soul.
