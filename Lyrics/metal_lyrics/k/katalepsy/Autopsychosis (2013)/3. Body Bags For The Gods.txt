We'll be devoured by endless spaces
of Another Ancient Worlds.
Cold wet interior of crypt
will become a mother's womb with dead infant inside.
We were blind, protecting our delusions,
imagined ourselves to be Gods, almighty ones.
We laughed at Time and Law.
Permissiveness darkened our mind.

Now it's time for a way in Nothingness.
Down, by steps to Nonexistence and Oblivion
Our dead bodies will whisper
theirs secrets to living ones,
who made a step to us through
the threshold of Madness.

We're standing on the edge of confluence with Chaos
where all forms, powers and symmetry dies.
The pride costs us a lot.
Now it is too late...
Indifferent and apathetic universe force
will get rid of as easily as its brought us here.
And only grinny Time
will be watching us eternally faling into Emptiness.

Ashes to ashes...
Dust to dust...
