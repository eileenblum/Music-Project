Attack!!!
Burned and ablaze in battlefields where I belong
Furies of Daemon
Bloodbath for victory
Blackened skies 
Pools of blood
Warriors of Lucifer
A massive death of beheaded Gods
Flares of anger
Destiny of violence
Blood feeds the land
Christ's flesh on steel
For an Evil domain
Kill the Messiah!
Demonic War Slaughter
Demonic War Slaughter
Demonic War Slaughter
Demonic War Slaughter
Demonic War Slaughter

This is dedicated to the most brutal band from the Philippines
and one of the most ugliest/deadliest metal force Asia ever have.
