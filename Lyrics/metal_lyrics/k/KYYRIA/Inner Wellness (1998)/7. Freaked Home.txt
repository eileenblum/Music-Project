I put myself up
So you can't reach me
I'll disconnect
Stay at home
I'll knock myself down
So you can't see me
I'm still on hold
Hold

You played yourself out by living this easy way
Still asking my why
This life is killing me

So babe

Right right
If you want him just say so baby
You're the heavenly ether
Right right you're returning the great big favour
Or is it just not quite there?

Head to head can't find no answer
Don't understand, don't really care face to face
Damn filled with anger
Still on hold
Hold

So babe

Right right
If you want him just say so baby
You're the heavenly ether
Right right
You're returning the great big favour
Or is it just not quite there?

Right right
We'll be together some day baby
You're the heavenly
Ever right right you're returning the great big favour
Or is it just not quite there?

You played yourself out by living this easy way
Still asking my why
This life is killing me
