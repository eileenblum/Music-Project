Captured your eye
Now keeps me in sight
Shiny teeth wide open

We'll let you decide there
I'm twisted again

Bliss ever lasting, you failed...

Come on
Let me inside
I'll let you decide
Between truth and lies

Your innocence
Keep walking right in
You are so tempting,
Let's pretend again

You've seen me,
You've
Failed

You
Failed

When you think your power's gone
Cry it out n' you won't be
Lone
