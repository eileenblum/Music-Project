Business in divinity
High class dismissed from 9 to 5
Let me see it or give it a try as it breeds,
Breeds new bride

You are my everything, you are my speciality
Here where all keep falling, you are my everything
Here where all keeps falling down

I play with the misery and it plays with me
It makes me feel well, like a gravity bell
I'm fine with darkness, it suits me swell
Serve to protect them,
Hide 'em within

Everything
Keeps swelling everything
You are my only thing

You move me on, favorite thing of them all

Closing down divinity high
Action seased form time to time
Keep ruling, keep fooling sweet sister

You are my everything, you are my speciality
Here where all keep falling, you are the only thing
Here where all keeps falling down

In game with your middleman, more than like to admit
Not it right place, but where the hell is that
Your inner wellness or so it says
Perfect thing favour flavour

Everything
Keeps swelling everything
You are my only thing
You are my everything
