Go laugh without the blame lover
Give away all anger
Go on pull me under,
Oh I think I'm dying again

Raise your face with smile
Don't you feel much better you want it like this forever
Oh I'm crawling back again

No resistance, no blame
End this sentence
Put that cigar out

Celebrate the pain
Lover don't you feel much better
Only rain and stormy weather to get you some place else

What would you like me to say?
You are my blessing hell
All I'm asking
Please don't let me fall for you again

No resistance, no blame
End this sentence
Put that cigar out

121
