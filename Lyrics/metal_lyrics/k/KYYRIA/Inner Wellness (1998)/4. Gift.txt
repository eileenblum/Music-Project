Had a life
In gehenna
Where the torture never ends
Had a life without living
Saw the strongest will bending

You are my precious
My darkest nightmare oh my little precious
All I'd give for you babe
I can't even tell

Storm we're waiting for
Like a rain without no dancing
Don't deserve this hope
You'll find it

How I was fading, times I betrayed you
How I miss you
I can't even tell
All I'd give for you babe
Now all I give is a gift

Freedom for freedom nothing's for granted no more
Now all I give is a gift

There's nothing I could ask you in return
Like you owed me those reason
They always put me down

No place else to go
Have no one else but my best friend
At least you're being honest
We all have problems down in drained gold mines
What keeps me from leaving
I can't even tell

How I betrayed you my darkest nightmare
Oh my little precious all I'd give for you babe
All I give is a gift
Freedom for freedom
Fist for that ego
Nothing's for granted no more
Now all I give's a gift

There's nothing I could ask you in return
Like you owed me those reasons
They always put me down
