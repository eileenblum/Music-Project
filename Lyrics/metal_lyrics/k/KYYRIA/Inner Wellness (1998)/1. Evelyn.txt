I am well without
A reason
Underneath they're all the same
I am searching all the right questions
It's no Evelyn to blame

Isn't there something you should try to explain?
Truth is out there blooming red
Is there something you should try to hide?
Show it all, you won't regret

I am happy, when I'm looking for Evelyn
I am dancing, she's burning like a sun
I am laughing
Maybe I'm drifting
With a smile
Burst my head in flames

Fallen down to his guilty hole
With this bastard in your womb
He is out there just to cut you
What else Evelyn could do?

Does it hurt he opens absciss deep within
To see your sickness all undressed?
Don't you cry his blade is dancing on your skin
Harlot's birthmarks on your breast

I am happy, when I'm looking for Evelyn
I am dancing, she's burning like a sun
I am laughing
Maybe I'm drifting
With a smile
Burst my head
In flames
