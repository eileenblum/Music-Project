She loves the scum like you and me
She hands the message down the streets
Oh the lord with her in her DÃ¶ner stall
I believe he's speaking thru the mushroom sauce

I believe in
I can hear him

Yeah god is fast
Yeah god is food
Shove him down with recyclable spoon
Yeah god is fucked
He is turning to stone
Getting high like a spiral in a neon dome

Happy people gather her to make a real street-wise
Donation to all the beat-up kids
Come along for affordable new salvation
Oh the joy is slicing all our brains in two
I believe the writings on her
Board are true

I believe in
I can hear him

Yeah god is fast
Yeah god is food...

Wanna trade your life for love
In this god-forsaken jungle?
Don't be afraid to open your mouth for a corpus-christi combo
I hear it comin' message worth a dime

All the people listen you won't be denied

I believe in
I can hear
Him
