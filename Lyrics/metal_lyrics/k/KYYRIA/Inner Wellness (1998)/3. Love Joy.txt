It's moving you
And moving me
Look down and babe you will see
You can step on it
You won't break it maybe shape it little... makes no change

Leave it behind lying in the dark leave it and it takes new form
It becomes new

What a time for a celebration
Makes you in bloom
Like never before
Makes you turn for a new destination
Urge for your nature
When it calls you

It's like giving birth to the very first one
Huge and it needs some more
Huge and it cuts too deep
As it fills me
As it thrills me
Flush it down with a white shade of pale

What a time for a celebration
Makes you in bloom
Like never before
Makes you turn for a new destination
Urge for your nature

When it calls
You
