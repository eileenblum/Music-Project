Here I am tossing
Around with an other girl in my bed
Here another mile goes out but you're still in my head
I'm here for another face, another place
And trace I'll leave behind

I am here won't you come
To move me on through the different times
Whatta difference today makes

But no way

Lord have mercy, pity on me

Here I put my safety glasses on
I'm safe and sound for now, I'm going strong
Here with another one so goes on 2000 miles in my bed

I am here
Won't you come
To move me on through the different times
Whatta difference today makes

Here I lie all night
It's all clear I find

But no way

Lord have mercy, pity on me
Lord I'm broken

You want to be fine
Won't you let me inside

Here I lie all night
It's all clear I find little difference today makes
When they ought to change

Lord I'm broken, I'm waiting to see

Woke up on the wall
The light down long way down
Through the window
Whatta difference today makes

Little difference today makes
When they ought to change

I'm waiting to see
