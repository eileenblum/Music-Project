discoloration in mind's re-creationa man who submit to manipulationsee the world trough enemies' eyescircumlocution for the defamationrail from hell to the salvationtime to measure man blacken the days passedblacken the days passedblacken the days passed shoot the needle in and empire is burningassure yourself from this day to the endfuck your breakable beliefkeep going down the road called liferail from hell to the hell called circletime to measure man new world, new world mandecision made in mindnew world it calls younew world, new world mandecision made in mindnew world to start again fighting and fighting everyday everywayfeels so fucking sick and twistedalone against allscreaming and yelling standing in the warfieldlove for this never died, I believed and made...and this it! I believed and made... now you hear it!
