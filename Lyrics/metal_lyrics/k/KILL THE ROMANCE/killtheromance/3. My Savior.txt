hey why me I'm stuck inside this dreamdwell inside delusion I will dwellface down don't co-operateyou condemn you make me run away plague it's like plague kills and leaves to decaywait I'm still alivetimeless wandering hide your pride and please follow me you bow down don't tell me I'm insanewell done my savior you blew it all the way I never knew I'd be out of timedeliver my head into the infurious hatewhy live a life full of sadness and griefit's all in this deafening cry I obey the rest are not so hollowdeep deeper I go I'll be alonetimeless wandering hide your pride and please follow me your state of mind what makes it better than minerace against frustrationface down don't co-operateyou condemn you make me run away
