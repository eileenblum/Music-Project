I'm the feast to their prey
Or a perpetual maze
I'm what victory chase
I'm their ghost the vision
Their blindness as my guidance
Stellar guard of no-man
I welcome you to my mind
Dear welcome into my life
I don't know what I should do
without you all
Am I now worth this present
Am I now here for real
As asked I will obey
and I will bow

I'm your new phenomenon
Your newborn faith
Desire for vengeance for hope

Oh I'm crowned
and the weight of my throne
Is so illusive
Hold my reflection up high
Make me immortal
If I walk on water could I fly
Divine permission
If I stand in brave like a hero
I have become your fame
I won't your fame

Welcome to the mourning
and the blessing
And to all those
touching insights
Move on as if you've never
seen the terror
as your own delight

A day that counts
a day that won't
A man must stay silent
at the presence of his host
Stand the beauty
of this madness
upon the altar
(and bow to death)

I'm right here
I'm what you will fear
How dare you
to question any of this

I am whatever you lack
I am the beast that is back
I am all your god's soul prey

What have you done
to my mind
What have you done
to my eyes
The gravity of your mistake
is too vast

At the end I'll need you
At the end I'll lead you
We shall meet as our
reconciliation

I'm your new phenomenon
Your newborn faith
Desire for vengeance
for hope
