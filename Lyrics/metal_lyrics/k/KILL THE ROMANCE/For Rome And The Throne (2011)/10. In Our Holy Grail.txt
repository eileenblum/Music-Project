He's the one who will bless you all
He's the one who will
save you at the end
Some other day
he would be a superstar
Some other day he would in
bloody hell

The frightened one of us will hide
Behind his stellar omnipotent soul
As out of the same bone
we're made of
Our aim and goal is to be supreme

We'll be never defeated
Against the enemy we will defend
our precious diamond and gold
Never ever are we buying
any other superstition
We're standing steady at line
We're not shaking nor lying
We shall not fall

In our holy grail denial is repressed
And among us consecrated
by the light perfection lies

We can kill but light still shines on
freeing us from the duties and
mundane
In our vanity lies our beast
Should we know it or should
we just ignore

Someone told us hypocrisy glows
And that we should really
be part of it
The son, the father and we as one
Would you believe
we're in a book we're in a song

We'll be never defeated
Against the enemy we will defend
our precious fire and debris
Never ever are we buying
any other superstition
We're standing steady at line
We're not shaking nor lying
We shall not fall

From the flames we will arise
with an angel pure and white
We praise our light divine
And the shine for us now blooms
We will make you realize
We will not be harmed by anyone

We are saved...
