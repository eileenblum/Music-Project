Beat me down oh baby,
push me down,
oh baby life is good
It's like a rollercoaster ride

In a roundabout going in or out
Where's the goal
where's the aim
So fucking what
it's just a game
Try to live my insanity

I'm in yet I am out
I've been begged
and I've been kicked
Was I burned at the stake
I can't remember
what a shame
Are we stared at
when we act
Are we stars in our fame
We don't need
no-one else
We're as cool as
we are brave

Slowing down is
not an option
Thinking straight
is utopian
I'm doing just fine

For we believe we're
the masters and queens
We'll be slaves
for the very last time
I can feel the burn
in my head
What are the odds of us
becoming what we will

So come on
push me down again,
now pull me up
I want to see does it end
Or has it even begun
We're so insane
We're pretty fucking brave
What we have is deranged
No-one else
would ever dare

To take the path
that follows our lead
Our destination, vindication

Beat me down
oh baby push me down
Now come on
life ain't good for us;
our rollercoaster ride
Beat me down
oh baby will you pull me up
We are humanity's limit
Can you feel the roundabout

We are stars
We live in our own fame
We don't need no-one else
Now can you feel
the roundabout

Treasure us for we believe
we're the masters
and queens
We'll be slaves
for the very last time
I can feel the burn
in my head

What are the odds of
us becoming what we will
I can feel the burn in my head
So would it be the time
to crown us as your kings
