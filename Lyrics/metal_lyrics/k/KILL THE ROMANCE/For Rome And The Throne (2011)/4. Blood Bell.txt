The windows crack
Then the earth floor trembles
So it has become
The wait is silent so we could
hear the screaming

Where is the flame
We can feel the burning
Let the vultures come
Come enter now into your
coming domain

Your coming domain...

Here we are, here with fear
When the blood bell begins
to chime
Here we stand
We shall not flee
When these angels
with hell arrive

Oh so alive
We've melted our frost with
our flaming souls
The time is up we
will make our move

Standing tall yet we hear
our screaming
We know the game
We know the price and
what's coming if we fail

Time stands still...

Here we are, here with fear
When the blood bell
begins to chime
Here we stand
We shall not flee
When these angels
with hell arrive

Here we are the time is near
When the blood bell
begins to chime
Yet we stand not down
nor shall we go
Let the angels with death arrive

Where do we go
Where do we flee
on the verge of our doom

Where should we run
Can't we just stay
Are we here only to yield
to the angels of revenge
