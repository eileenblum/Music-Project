I feel I've been betrayed
A well thought truth woke
my sleeping doubts
So frail is your gracious
conspiracy
I'm merciful, I'm merciful
you'll suffer only for life

You will die - no hope
On your knees right now

I maniac your sadist
I'm ready for the
disgraceful cry
I maniac your sadist
Shine malice
Rise for the Morning Star
Traitor you traitor
From the depths we'll arise

I'll crown your
superior masterpiece
for betting all for your
undeniable might
I see omen fulfilled
and come true to you
I'm breaking all
I'm shaking all
I will honour only myself

I'll be dancing on your grave
For I'm immortal
everything is set for me
Do as you've planned in
your stone-cold head
Lay the truth before
your shattered dreams

I'm burning at stake and
I don't feel a thing
Can you feel the difference
you servant
No excuses this time it's really me

I won't neglect you my beloved
Behold the mighty star
Run and cover you've become
my water turned to ice
