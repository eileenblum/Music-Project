Blind that you are
to stare at the crack in
the mirror of your fate
And the nightmare
begins to call you awake
Oh the vision on the
horizon seem
hopeless and pale
It's welcoming us into
its embrace
Deceiving us to take
part in this insane game

That is changing all
From inside it's changing all
Ever regression
Forever regression

Pale is the moon and the
shadow is blinding our eyes
Days turn to night far above
dies the star that we are
So the glimpse
remaining behind
Should make us doubt
So it is done
We are to fade

We drift along the stream
And bathe in the river 'till
we're pure enough to rot
We never got to know
what went wrong
We never knew we had
to stay until the end of all

It is changing all
From inside it's changing all
Ever regression
Changed us all
From inside it changed us all
Forever regression
Never dissension
Never escape no
Never a fiction
Never

Slave you are
Deep inside enslaved you are
From the depths of your doom
shall you rise like a beast

Stone you are
A statue of stone you've become
Come fly and face your own
reflections paralyzing stare

Save yourself
Flee from yourself
Deny the cage you hide in
and become the one you fear
