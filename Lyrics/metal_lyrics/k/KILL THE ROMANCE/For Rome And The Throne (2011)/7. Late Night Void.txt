A day brings the light as
tonight's decision set the
world on fire
Sob high above the dream
and gather the remains for
the feast
Follow the leash that is
leading and feed the flesh
ready for bleeding

Feel the weight of the world
as you stand alone in the rain

Too late to save the hate
we gained, too early to slay,
let days turn from blue to gray
What we once were,
we never will,
we have become walking
shadows in late night void

Dark deception kills the
light as tonight's decision
burns beneath the skin
The broken barrier shall
lead us to the fight
It's more than meets the
eye, if we throw ourselves
against the wall
You chose the ferry without
coppers and the story
will be told

Feel the wight of the
hammer as you lay under
the pressure of the day
Too late to save the hate,
it's time to choose the fate
in this trail of tears

You'll fight or you'll pay but
you'll end up in hell anyway

As I feel the weight of my world
What we once were, we never
will become, the glory of history
