For those who deliver their souls to the devilMay their death become as clear as your heavenWho will judge you, who'll deceive youThe prise is repent so fucking consent Fight fight for your life lifeWhere's your heretic soul where's your heretic aggressionIs nighttime your only lifetimeWhat the fuck is with you? Go figure... Come on you holy sinnerPathetic parasite Take my hand and I'll lead you into my realmNo sympathy for weakNowhere to go nowhere to stayI'll inhale this blood into meRemember you're a prey for yourself For immortal believers these virgin beginnersWhere's the beauty of the lesson unlearnedConfess your crime, forget the lying truth insideRust in your own dreams admit your lies Fight for lifeBehind that paralyzed mind you keep saying you're rightIs there a way, is there a dayWhere no-one's already been sent astray Take my hand and I'll lead you into my realmNo sympathy for weakNowhere to go nowhere to stayI'll inhale this blood into meRemember you're a prey for yourselfI'll inhale this blood into meRemember to pray for yourself It's already there just fading awayLife sends all fairness to hell  [Solo] Remember you're a prayRemember to prayRemember you're a pray for yourself
