I will let it all flow and never let it goIt's always the same I'll show you howI, pain, the rain, just to see how we all go Reaching the light out of this worldThe storm is calming still it calls meMy bride of destruction screams to continueAnd I'll burn myself I your only friend, the rest are goneThroughout the life all in vainYou should not beWhere is the prideAll that is done 'coz I will mind Reaching the light out of this worldThe storm is calming still it calls meMy bride of destruction screams to continueAnd I'll burn myselfThe devil rules the world I live inThe day after day I love my life in sin
