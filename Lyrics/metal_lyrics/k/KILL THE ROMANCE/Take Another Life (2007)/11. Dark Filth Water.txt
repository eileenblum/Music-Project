from the sweet shelter to the unknowna thousand times the curtain hidesonce fed the lions of attention andjoined to the romantic associationten ton stone, my friend I'm aloneon this road I walk like a shadowdecide, decieve, hard to believeme, myself we're stuck in this drama I...breath painneed to clean myself, need to burn the bridgeswhy is that, I'm insecureIf I build back the bridgescan I feel it can I touch thesafe of this placeI don't wanna see my heroes changewhen I'm done I need you againI stabbed your back, vai se foder! my dark filth watermake my monsters diebefore I swallow the sun andride the ghost on my shoulders leave the statement by the grace of your godif dead that's good, alive goes as wellthe will of the one was created by the manthe source of the greatest insanitynow I've felt it, now I've touchedthe hate of this placewhen I see my heroes changethen I'm gone dead sure I'm gone in the......portrait of the useless stalker... my dark filth watermake my monsters diebefore I swallow the sun andride the ghost on my shoulders
