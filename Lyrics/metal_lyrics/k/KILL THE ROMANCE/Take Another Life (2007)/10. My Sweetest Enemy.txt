I can hear the whisper still shouting at meDespite all the promises it won't ever vanishTormentor killing my soul, eating me aliveInstead of ignorance, should I kill 'em all Another world of foolsGo before it's too lateDo as I sayForgive, you're now my enemy Test me see what happens, repeat your mistakeThis poison's blinding my eyes and bleeding through earsI can't take this anymore, stop itWhat the fuck is thisI think I'll end this now I don't know how I feel todayShould I now go or should I stay
