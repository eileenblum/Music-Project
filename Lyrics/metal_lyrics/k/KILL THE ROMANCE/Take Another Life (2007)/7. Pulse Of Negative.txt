for the god's sake
I'm slipping all the way
dishonest is the word throughout the day
public grace don't save from own disgrace
it's always equal
inordinate demand within the day
drives apathy constantly in your veins
can't stop the person you've become
change before damage done

hit the face and fuck your selfpity
be a man who uses his abilities
stop complaining and start the living
make something real
take a hand if you feel that you need it
don't be a prick who's avoiding to be a man
you should make it work on your own

bow to none and straighten your back
or the day is bringing pulse of negative
don't bite the pillow
or you'll find yourself repeating the shit you've faced
pulse of negative

you bow to none and straighten your back
don't bite the pillow

learn the rules go and make the day
by faking the way you're faking all you say
hate everything in the mirror
you shall see
pay the price yes you've made it
you've been betrayed so many times
take a breathe and count to 5
'cause this is your life
