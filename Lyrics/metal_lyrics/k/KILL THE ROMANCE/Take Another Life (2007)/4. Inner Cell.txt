never been so real thingnever been so scaredI look ahead but I don't see a thinginside my head there's something from the past my inner cell you wanna see me deadeverything is so unreal it's in my bed I never felt like thisI don't need thatI close my eyesall I feel is weight and blinding lies that are tearing me apart I know nothing scares youwhat a surpriseinstead it changes you and the fear remains the same
