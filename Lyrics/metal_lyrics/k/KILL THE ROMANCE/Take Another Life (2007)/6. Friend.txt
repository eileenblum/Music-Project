Little man, little man don't you know where to stand, we will run you overYou can run, you can hide, you can even try to die, but those things you do in vainNothing sacred nothing lasts, the thing is we're your god and you will never be a manYou deserve nothing we give you everything, trust your god obey the divine Come on solder take your place, creep on the ground just do it nowPull yourself up or dieBless the mighty, pray the savior, do us magic say we're rightIt seems you like it Fight! just do as we sayStay! don't you ever leaveGame! ain't over 'till we let you die, or be buried alive I will be your friend for lifeAnd your eyes if they go blindYou are my only oneSo will you stay by my side Should I be someone else, I can't pull myself togetherAm I worth nothingWho are you, who are we, do they even care aboutWe're dead to the worldWhy do they laugh, I'm trying very hard, guess I'm a failureKill me now I want out, I can't remember how it feels to be alive
