Go 'coz I can see your motherfucking face, ain't fine with meThrow away those bloody freaking cries for good, it's time to begin Now bring it onIt's about the fucking timeStop dreaming about yourself and go fucking do itNo don't be afraid, it's just a gameCome on do it, do it Breath - until your blood is as cold as mine... deadly divineBreath - adore all the weak with your lonely lies... failure my friend Stop unless you feel you can change it all, fine with meSpit on those who try to alter your mind, fuck you allFight against all odds that won't bring you alive, unsatisfiedTear down every mortal left behind trying to hold you down Fight, fight, fight...Don't be afraid, it's just a game, stop dreaming about yourself... go!
