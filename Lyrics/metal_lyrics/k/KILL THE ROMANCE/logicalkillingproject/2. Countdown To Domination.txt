I won't define my state of mind
it's all too straight for this blind sight
I am just here to take what's mine
no there's no reason to hold on
whatever comes too near I will pass it by
so far that no-one will know

come on control

I'm on my knees would you tell me why
am I a waste of your time no

wake me up at night so I can scream and shout
endless nightmares I dream of silence

cold it shivers down my spine
it takes so long it will paralyze all what's left of me
stone my eyes are dead as stone
no more a light that shines on me goodbye

I decide what's best for me
no that is me
what else should I then do
whatta fuck

I think I've crossed the line
I know now I'm alive
I know I will begin my countdown to domination
