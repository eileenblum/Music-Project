I was born to a band of troubles
I have a ticket to train of hell
so far wounded and hostile
we don't need anyone else but you

so let the panic flow
as we begin our show now
feelings are vain
we're one of a kind
so let the panic flow
as we begin our show now
we're here to stay
we're the killers of romance

by has passed the morning after
still remorse is very unknown
best way find us is to follow the broken hearts
so here we are follow if you dear you cunt

I am divine
I am the one
I want to perpetuate our desire
we are divine
we are the ones
we are the killers of romance

kill the romance
