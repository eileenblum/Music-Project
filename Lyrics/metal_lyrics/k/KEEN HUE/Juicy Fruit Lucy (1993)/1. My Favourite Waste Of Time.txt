I saw her coming with fire in her eyes
Her smile just knocked me out
I have heard the stories
Youâre the one ânâ only

Oh Iâm burning for you
I hope you feel it too

[Chorus:]
My favourite waste of time
My favourite waste of time
Iâll be there for you

Make your body talk now
I wanna see your funky body groove
Canât stop thinking about you
Almost everything you haunt me in my dreams

Oh Iâm burning for you
I hope you feel it too

[Repeat chorus]

Baby, baby
I wish you were here
Baby, baby, baby
Iâm lying here
Stare at the wall
I twist ânâ turn
I canât get you out of my mind
