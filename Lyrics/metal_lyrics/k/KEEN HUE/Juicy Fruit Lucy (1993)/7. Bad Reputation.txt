Iâve been trapped so many ways
Thereâs no way out
Lookinâ for solution
The only one Iâve got
Oh I tried it all

Iâve been standing at the crossroads way too long

[Chorus:]
Bad reputation
Look out here
I come walking
On these old streets again
Bad reputation
Gonna search you up
Gonna bust you down

Iâve been a full-time loser
Oh so many times
Holding on to what I got
Thinking it ainât much
I tried it all

Iâve been standing at the crossroads way too long

[Repeat chorus]
