My buddy Jeff has a car
He takes it down the boulevard
I said âhey pretty mama, could you get inside?â

Weâve been drinking
So now were in a good mood

Oh pretty baby, wonât you get with Jeff?
Oh Cadillac car, you start to spin
Blue lights flashing everywhere
(What do you have to say, boy?)

Weâve been drinking
So now were in a good mood

[Chorus:]
Hey Hi Hidi Ho
Itâs a party and we wonât let go
Hey hi hidi ho
Câmon, rockinâ steady and strong we go

Câmon baby, take a chance with us
If you want rock it all night long
Brothers and sisters sing along
(Sing along)

Weâve been drinking
So now were in a good mood

[Repeat chorus]
