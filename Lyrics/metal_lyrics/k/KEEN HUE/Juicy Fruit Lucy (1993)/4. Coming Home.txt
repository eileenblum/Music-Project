Iâve been mistreated
Iâve been pushed
Iâve been beaten to the ground
I donât know why
Ainât got no hope
Ainât got no friends
Ainât got someone I can care about
I looked into the mirror
Then I knew God give me
One more chance to prove
I need a lady
I need a lady to love

[Chorus:]
Coming home, home
The lady in black seduces me
Coming home, home, home
A lady in black

She said Iâm sunshine and I hope you will remain
You gotta feel my loving coming all the way
Many years ago I saw this lady standing all alone
Dancing naked in the rain feelinâ free
Stay away, woman, stay away from me
Thatâs what I should say
You ainât the girl for me
Itâs a long was to go
Itâs a long was to go

[Repeat chorus]

She said I love you and I hope you understand
You can take me higher high up in the air
For the first time, baby, I have this lust for love
We gotta hold on, we have to carry on
Donât turn away now like you did before
Donât let it go âcause we can have it all
Itâs all a long way to go
Itâs a long was to go

Iâm coming home, home, home
To my lady in black who seduces me
Iâm coming home, home, home
To my lady in black
My, my, my, my lady in black
