How many times must I tell you?
Women know you build up your life with lies
You donât care at all
Youâre playing a game of passion
But money rules
This time you might get caught
You have broken all the rules                                     

You can see youâre falling
Youâre a prisoner of time
And it might bring you down

[Chorus:]
Pray for the rescue (Rescue)
Your time has come
Pray for the rescue (Rescue)
On and on
Pray for the rescue (Rescue)
Lose control
Pray for the rescue (Rescue)
Soon youâre gone

You pray for your love and affection
Then you take it all
You driving around in your fancy car
Think youâre the king of them all
Your friends have started to leave you
Youâre on the road alone
Itâs frightening to hear all the lies
That women are told

You can see youâre falling
Youâre a prisoner of time
And it might bring you down

[Repeat chorus]

Hot, hot girl
Heâs cominâ after you
On and on and on
Heâs a bad, bad man
Heâs cominâ after you
