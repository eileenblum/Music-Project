Juicy Fruit Lucy gets high on crack
Sheâs down at the bottom line
It turns her world upside down
She starts talking with a rhyme
She likes it, canât deny it
She wears rubber-made clothes tonight
She loves it, she needs it
When she makes start to please her

Sheâs been using it for a long time
And her brain is spinning like a merry-go-round
Sheâs been down town walking round and round
Sheâs been looking out to have some fun

In the night
Down the alley
Sheâs been making out
Just to make a dime

[Chorus:]
Run, run to the other side
You can run but you canât hide
Sheâs got fire in her eyes
Run, run to the other side
Juicy Fruit Lucy
You canât hide
Soon itâs your time to die

Sheâs been down the street oh so many times
And smile her chewing gun smile
They please her, tease her, need her more and more
âCause sheâs the cheapest of them all

In the night
Down the alley
Sheâs been making out
Just to make a dime

[Repeat chorus]
