I donât need no more lies
âCause now Iâm through with you
And donât you think that I will change my mind?
I donât need no one to tell me what to do
Doing this, doing that for you
Like it was before

I feel so good this morning
And donât know where Iâm going
And this red hot girl
Smile at me

[Chorus:]
Hard life
Youâre living a hard life
Hard life
And your friend starts to leave you
Hard life
And you throw away you soul in sin
Hard life
Youâre living a hard life
And you call out for someone
Hard life
This time you ainât gonna win

And you think youâre so cool
When youâre riding with that fool
And I know I didnât lose more than just a dime
I say to you look at me
I never felt so free
Standing in the wind
This was ainât yours to win

I feel so good this morning
And donât know where Iâm going
And this red hot girl
Smile at me

[Repeat chorus]

You might as well give in
