Heâs running âcross the border
Heâs running just to meet his girl
Oh maybe sheâs your daughter
So watch out and just bring her to the herd
When night time is coming lost in town
Itâs bringinâ him down

[Chorus:]
Into the night
The lost man calls
Into the night
Itâs gonna break his heart
Into the night
A wild manâs call
Into the night!

All through the day this man is hiding
âCause heâs afraid to face the shinning sun
But in the night time round the corner
Just lying and waiting to be found

[Repeat chorus]
