Iâm waiting for the morning sun
âCause darkness frightens me
Donât know why thatâs just the way I am
Wide awake in my bed
Voices in my head
Is it just my imagination?

I get down on my knees
(On my knees)
And pray for darkness to retreat

[Chorus:]
We will make you feel alright
We will take you by surprise
When darkness falls

Donât need any crystal ball
You can feel it in your heart
And the world to torn apart
In my mind, in my dreamland
Thatâs where Iâm going
When the world is too cold for me
Just my imagination

Oh voices calling
Voices in my head

[Repeat chorus]
