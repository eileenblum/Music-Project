You lied again
You got what it takes out to be believed
One little word you said
You tinkle with eyes then youâre forgiven

Oh you betray again
Oh I cannot rely on you

You have fallen down
Fallen to the ground
The sky was screaming
Do you remember when we had so much fun?
When you showed me a lot
About love and understanding

Oh I warn you, girl
Stop playing games and make up your mind

[Chorus:]
Tell no tales
Stop your foolish dirty games
Tell no tales
And I come runninâ after you

Once upon a time you said:
âI was running wild on the road of madnessâ
Here we go again telling lies âbout me
But thereâs no reason

Woman, woman
You have broken every rule
No man, no man
Is ready to lay down without the truth

Oh I warn you, girl
Stop playing games and make up your mind

[Repeat chorus]
