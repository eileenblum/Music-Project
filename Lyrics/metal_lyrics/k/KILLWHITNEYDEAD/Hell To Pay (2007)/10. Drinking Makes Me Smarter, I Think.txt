Her face fills my world
Haunted by another girl
So I'm going to drink until I can't see straight
Overrun and consumed by hate
Let it's fire flood my veins
This night will never be the same
Photographs they all burn
One more lesson learned
Let all of this wash away the pain I will never let you into my heart again
Never
So
I will keep on drinking (keep drinking)
Until I can drink no more (keep drinking)
Can I just please stop thinking (no thinking)
So I will keep on drinking (keep drinking)
It's time to erase the name of that whore I want to wake up face down on the floor.
