You must believe me
Watch your back
She is a liar
She wants to deceive you
She is a liar
Beware
She is a weapon like you have never seen
She has come to make us all bleed
She is a war like you have never seen
She is here to slaughter everything
Why can't you see her for what she is
She is the devil.
