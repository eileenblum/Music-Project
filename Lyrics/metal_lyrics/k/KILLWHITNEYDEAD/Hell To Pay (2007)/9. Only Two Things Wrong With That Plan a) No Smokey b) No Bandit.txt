A) No Smokey B) No Bandit

Through the violence and bloodshed we are becoming one
Through all this madness
Through the insanity
We are becoming one
You and I
Eye to eye
Give me blood
Show me faith
Sacrificed
Now reborn
What you see is what you get
This is a night you will never forget
Through all this sickness
Through the retributions
We are becoming one
Through the violence and bloodshed
We are becoming one
You and I
Eye to eye
