I've known rage too many times
But never like this never like this I want to gut him and fill his mouth with piss
Drowning I want to gouge his eyes
Leave him blind begging for mercy
His wounds pour him inside out
His body so thirsty
Dying
All this my bloodlust I need to binge and purge
Murderous my intent
Now more than just an urge
My bloodlust
Who do you think you are?
To fuck with me
Who do you think you are?
Don't fuck with me
