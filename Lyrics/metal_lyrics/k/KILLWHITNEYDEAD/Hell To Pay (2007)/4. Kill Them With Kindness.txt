Always pointing your finger and saying that I am the one to blame I know now I will never change
Some things always stay the same
What have I been waiting for
These years to pass and nothing more
What have I been waiting for
A chance to get even and settle the score I know now I never want to change
Some things were meant to remain
Settle the score
