you say it's to new depths that I'm sinking
not just your heart I am breaking
more than your heart is breaking
it's more than your heart that's breaking
1000 miles
you're set to attack
voice on my phone
weight on my back
you are set to attack
no matter how far I fucking run
I can't get away from the barrel of your gun
so go on
so come on pull your trigger
fire at will
I will warn you
you better shoot to kill
