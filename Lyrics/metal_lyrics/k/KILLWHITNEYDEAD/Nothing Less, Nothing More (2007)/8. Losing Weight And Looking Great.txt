kicked down the door
stormed the room
everybody standing there didn't know what to do
who needs sleep?
no, not tonight
I won't quit until I see sunlight
get me a drink or maybe five and find some girls who will eat me alive
who needs sleep?
baby, not tonight
by the looks of you we'll be doing alright
just sex and sweat
we'll party all night long
and in the morning honey, I'll be gone
who needs sleep?
only got time to screw all of you
