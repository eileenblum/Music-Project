symptoms rise beneath the static
something impulsive becoming habit
smile through my teeth
gaze upon (fear) this animal underneath
know how your screams they excite me
and how your pain it ignites me
I'll squeeze the blood from your veins
I'll drain the life until nothing remains
I told you once, don't want to tell you again
it will be too late you'll be fucking dead
don't bother to leave on a light
you won't be making it home tonight
said it once, I'll say it again
I fucking love (live for) getting even
I brought my noose give me that neck
and we'll see just how far it can stretch
