columns of smoke
this city is burning tonight
spirals of flame torching your chapels of white
the ruin of your ways
will bring about the end of days
run your mouth and talk your shit
but we all know you are full of it
you're just another piece of shit
you're just a worthless son of a bitch
you better watch what you're saying to me
it's going to put you six feet deep
you are going to wind up dead in the street
dead in the streets
