there is no forgetting this
there is no forgetting what you did
so I will bide my time waiting in the wings
ready to (wanting to)  unleash such terrible (horrible) things
if you think that only in my dreams I'll inflict this much harm
just wait until the night I have you in my arms
then you will know what my dreams are made of
goodnight, my dear
