make sure you get the job done
if you don't there is nowhere to run
don't leave me here with a breath in my lungs
you will regret all that you have not done
you better leave me dead where you stand
or bury me up to my neck in sand
better remove my arms
you better break my legs
cut off my head
you better kill me
