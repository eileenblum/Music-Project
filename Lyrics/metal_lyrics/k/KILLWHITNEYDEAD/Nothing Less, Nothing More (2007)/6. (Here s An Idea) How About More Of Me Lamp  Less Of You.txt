I think I might just self destruct
this situation is about to implode
my fuse is shrinking
time is getting short
inside me a bomb is set to explode
set to explode
there is no need for you to explain
your truth's never what it seems
you've got me all wound up
it's not every day you wake up with a gun in your mouth
today you just must have pissed me off somehow
pissed me off somehow
time to bite the bullet
