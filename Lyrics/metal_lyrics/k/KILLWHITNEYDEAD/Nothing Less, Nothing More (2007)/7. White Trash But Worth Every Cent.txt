never thought that I could let you make me believe
but I did it anyway
never thought that you could sit there and bathe in deceit
and you did it anyway
if I could take it back
every word and dollar spent
everything I said to you was exactly what I meant
all the flowers I bought are starting to wilt
won't see me shed a tear over blood that I've spilled
never shed a tear over blood spilled
but it won't matter if they're dead or alive
it doesn't matter to me if you live or die
you said you always wanted flowers
so I brought you flowers for your grave
