She said âI hate your fucking gutsâ
Okay, are you done now
Iâve got a life to live and youâve got yours
And I bet itâs a busy life living like a whore
Got all the most popular people to please
Always conducting business down on your knees
So pretty, so plastic and so clichÃ©
Youâve become a dime a dozen
Just another of the ordinary
Go on put your mouth where the money is
