Hell bent on revenge every fucking day
I must destroy you once and for all
Not a day has passed when I havenât thought of killing you
Now Iâve got you right where I want you
There is no escape
You will remember this face
Not a moment has passed when I havenât thought of killing you
Thought you could run
Thought you could hide from me
Thought you coculd get away with what you did to me
But I wonât let you live
