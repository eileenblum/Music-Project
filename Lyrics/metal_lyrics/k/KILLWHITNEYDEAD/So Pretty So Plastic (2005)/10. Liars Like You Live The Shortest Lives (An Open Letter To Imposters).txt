Stand up and face your enemy
You cowards â face your enemy
Please donât even open your mouth
I already know whatâs going to come out
You made a mistake I wonât let you make again
This ends right now
Liars like you live the shortest lives
I came for the showdown
Brought hell on my heels
I came for a war tonight
Crush you under my wheels
Eat my fucking dust
