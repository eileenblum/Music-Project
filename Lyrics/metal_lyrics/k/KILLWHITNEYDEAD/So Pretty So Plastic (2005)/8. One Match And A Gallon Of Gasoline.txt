So Iâm misogynistic?
Call me what you wish
But I know and you know she was asking for it
Got my match and a gallon of gasoline
I will burn every bridge thatâs in between
Burn it, burn it all to the ground
So I am homicidal?
Call me what you will
I canât help the fact that I was born to kill
Itâs getting hot in here
You are dead in my hands
You are dead in my eyes
You are dead in my heart
You are dead to this world
