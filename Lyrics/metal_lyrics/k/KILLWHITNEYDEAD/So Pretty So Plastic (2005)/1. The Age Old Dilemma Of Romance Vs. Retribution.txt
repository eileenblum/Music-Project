Yes Iâm two faced
I am smiling to put you at ease
But inside I am counting the ways to make you bleed
I never wanted it to be like this
But you took this heart and crushed it with your fist
Now my thoughts are slowly tearing you apart â piece by piece
Iâve never felt so cold
Iâve never felt so alone
Iâve never felt so alive
Now weâll leave it without words
Weâll settle this with violence
Câmon, give it all youâve got
Weâll settle this with bullets
Go ahead, take your best shot
