You are so beautiful
Doped up and numbingly, willingly sedated
Lifeless and glass eyes gaze into a lonely world of casualties
Your body lay broken on the cold bathroom floor
Your body lay broken
You were so beautiful
Looking for thrills with open arms and vcnomous smile
Your life equated only agony
For years breathing tragedy
Go to sleep my darling
Never may you wake again
I promise this is for your own good
You were so gutless
You were so callous
You were so spineless
You fucking deserve this
