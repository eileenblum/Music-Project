All these seductive angels and my wretched devils
They never knew me or what I was capable of
Yet they longed for the taste of my lips
All these seductive angels and my wretched devils
Your arms out and palms up to the sky
Say your prayers
Take no prisoners
Single shots to the head
This will never cease
Not until the last one is dead
I must kill the all and leave no one alive
You better say your prayers
Your life ends tonight
Leave no one alive
