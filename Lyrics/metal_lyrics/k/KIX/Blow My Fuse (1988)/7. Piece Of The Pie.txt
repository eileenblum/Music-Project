Cold, cold cold sweat
A cold, cold heart...you bet
Crack the looking glass
Broken pieces from my past

Down, skin and bones
On the road, no home
Hungry, the grip is tight
Just a vision of the night

I want, you want
To taste it, better on top
I just want a piece of the pie
'Fore the cream starts to rise
Don't make me cry for a piece of the pie

Hard, hard to get
Little teaser, not yet
Down at the 9th Street bar
Parked in the backseat of my car

Steam, I can't breathe
Hot and sweaty, Josephine
Now, give it up
Well, I could never get too much

I want, you want
To taste it, better on top
I just want a piece of the pie
'Fore the cream starts to rise
Don't make me cry for a piece of the pie

I want, you want
So let it
I get, you give
Go get it
No ifs, no ands
Don't bite off
Me and my plans

Don't bite off a piece of the pie
'Fore the cream starts to rise
Don't make me cry for a piece of the pie

Piece of the pie
Gonna eat me alive
It's a long hard climb
For a piece of the pie

(I just want a) Piece of the pie
(Got to have a) Piece of the pie
(I just want a) Piece of the pie

Piece of the pie...
