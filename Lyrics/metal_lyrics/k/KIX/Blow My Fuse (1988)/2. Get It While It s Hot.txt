I'm a love machine, I'm a M-16
I'll shoot you full of holes
I'll scratch your back, give you a heart attack
And drag you across the coals

I'm not fooling around, I'm gonna melt you down
Ya need to change your oil
A little gasoline in your canteen
Will bring you to a boil

Get it while it's hot
I'm on fire
Get it while it's hot
Don't be too cool, get it while it's hot

If you let me in, I can blister your skin
Burns of the third degree
Throw your coat on the floor and lock the door
And shade the light from me

You're gonna have to run from my loaded gun
Get ready for the show
You knock me off my feet when you turn up the heat
And the list begins to grow

Get it while it's hot
I'm on fire
Get it while it's hot
Don't be too cool, get it while it's hot

(Come and get it)
While it's hot
(Come and get it)
Under a rock
(Come and get it)
On the streets
(Come and get it)
In the sheets

Flames in the gutter
Smoke in the sky
Hot undercover
But I go gotta try

Get it while it's hot
I'm on fire
Get it while it's hot
Feed desire

Get it while it's hot
You're not gonna know
Get it while it's hot
Where the wind's gonna blow

Get it while it's hot
I'm a love machine
Get it while it's hot
I'm an M-16

Get it while it's hot
Get it while it's hot
Get it while it's hot
Get it while it's hot

Get it while it's hot
Get it while it's hot
Get it while it's hot
Get it while it's hot
