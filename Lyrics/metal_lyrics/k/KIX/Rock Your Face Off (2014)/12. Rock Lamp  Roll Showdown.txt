I feel my blood burning, running through my veins
No there's no stopping, like a runaway train
Rock&amp;Roll's my obsession, the Gods show me the way
Weapons in my possession, now I'm ready to play

You got to get up, get the lead out
Make your way to the Rock&amp;Roll Showdown
Turn the heat on, when you feel the sound
Don't stop, it's a Rock&amp;Roll Showdown

Ain't waitin' for no one, time not standing still
Got no competition, I'm in for the kill
Keep pounding the pavements, knockin' down the doors
Crowd screaming to bring it, a thousand fans ready to roar

You got to get up, get the lead out
Make your way to the Rock&amp;Roll Showdown
Turn the heat on, when you feel the sound
Don't stop, it's a Rock&amp;Roll Showdown

Our weapons are loaded, ready for the show
Waiting for the explosion, it's about to blow
Can you feel the power, gonna cut to the chase
We kick it into overdrive, right in your face

You got to get up, get the lead out
Make your way to the Rock&amp;Roll Showdown
Turn the heat on, when you feel the sound
Don't stop, it's a Rock&amp;Roll Showdown
