I've been watchin' you, you think you're everything
If I don't worship the ground where you fall down
You see black and white, but I'm still seein' red
We both see stars when you're around

Lipstick on the mirror
Clothes tossed on the bed
Such a disaster, the morning after
I wish I could erase you instead

When you're gone, who's gonna miss ya?
You're gone, who'll hold and kiss ya?
Cuz what we had you just don't throw that away
When you're gone, whose gonna love ya?
You're gone, not push and shove ya
Who's gonna miss you, no not me no way
When you're gone...

Back in the car it's a long way home and you're always on my mind
Radio's on, and there's no sound
Night turns into day, I hear footsteps follow me
Nothing's changed to hold me down

Lipstick on the mirror
Clothes tossed on the bed
Such a disaster, the morning after
I wish I could erase you instead

When you're gone, who's gonna miss ya?
You're gone, who'll hold and kiss ya?
Cuz what we had you just don't throw that away
When you're gone, whose gonna love ya?
You're gone, not push and shove ya
Who's gonna miss you, no not me no way
When you're gone...

When you're gone, you're gone, you're gone
When you're gone, you're gone, you're gone
Give me something to miss!

when you're gone, you're gone, you're gone
When you're gone, you're gone, you're gone
Who's gonna miss you? Won't be me no way!
