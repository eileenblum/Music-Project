There's a girl I know with a reputation
One you'll never believe
She's got all the boys in a regular rotation
I think I'm number three
She might be twenty-teen or maybe thirty-five (get out!)
And her name is Honey
She's a big time stinger with that queen bee smile
And I'm a sugar buzz junkie

I've got to talk right, know what to do
She's got the sticky moves

Oh my baby keep me up all night
She got me rollin' in honey, rollin' in honey
Run run baby keep me up all night
Cuz I'm rollin' in honey, rollin' in honey
I need a life line, I'm going down
Ah ha ha ha
Rollin' in honey

When at night I get her all alone
I love when she is stingin' me
Then she drives me to her honeycomb
I love my little honey bee
She's walkin', she's talkin', everybody's buzzin'
I just gotta let them know
That after all the money and the pleasin' and teasin'
I'm the new king bee in town (ah ha!)

Fly to paradise with me
She knows I'll never leave

Oh my baby keep me up all night
She got me rollin' in honey, rollin' in honey
Blow me over like dynamite
Cuz I'm rollin' in honey, rollin' in honey
I need a life line, I'm going down
Ah ha ha ha
Rollin' in honey

Oh my baby keep me up all night
She got me rollin' in honey, rollin' in honey
On my knees I can't put up a fight
Cuz I'm rollin' in honey, rollin' in honey
I need a life line, I'm gonna drown
Ah ha ha ha
Rollin' in honey
