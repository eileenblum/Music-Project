I want I need I love wish I could have âem,
All the beautiful girls from the not so secret magazine
With every shot so hot reach out and grab âem,
I can feel the heat from the cover to the pages in between
All look no touch too much just leaves me hanging,
They're drop dead gorgeous super model for us, I love

I love dirty girls, so lovely
Dirty sexy girls, naughty
We are dirty boys, big dreamers
Filthy dirty boys, oh please please

Looking at the pictures of my angels ain't no doubt
All custom made to make the grade my ladies
