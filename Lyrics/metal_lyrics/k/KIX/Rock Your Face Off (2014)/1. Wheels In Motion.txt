I step across that line, a thousand times
Before I make my mind and get it right next time
But the wheels turn round, they won't slow down
I got to spin mine out, before they hit the ground

I coulda turn around keep it down
Get my mouth a runnin' just to rev it up
Crooked walkin' trash talkin' runnin' with the pack
By the time I shut my trap you know I couldn't take it back

It's the way we set the wheels in motion
I said that's the way we make the wheels roll
The way we set the wheels in motion
You're wavin' your tongue like a remote control

If you could read my mind, in just a few short lines
You see the warning sign, you feel the pressure rise
Because the wheels turn round, and never hit the ground,
Until the motor stalls, and my lost gets found

I coulda turn around keep it down
Get my mouth a runnin' just to rev it up
Crooked walkin' trash talkin' runnin' with the pack
By the time I shut my trap you know I couldn't take it back

It's the way we set the wheels m motion
I said it's the way we make the wheels roll
That's the way we set the wheels in motion
You're wavin' your tongue like a remote control

Dream it out, talk it out, rev it out, get it out
Dream it out, talk it Out, rev it out, get it out
Raise it out, take it up, and bake it up
Take it up, take it up, break it up!

It's the way we set the whee is in motion
I said it's the way we make the wheels roll
That's die way we set the wheels in motion
I said it's the way we make, the wheels roll
It's the way we set the wheels in motion
I said it's the way we make-the wheels roll
That's the way we set the wheels in motion
I said it's the way we make the wheels...
