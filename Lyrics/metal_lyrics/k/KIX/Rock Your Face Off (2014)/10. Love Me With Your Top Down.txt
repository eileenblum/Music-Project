Oh oh-ohoh
Oh oh-ohoh

I got a midnight muscle and I'm cruising the town
I'm lookin' for a hustle with the top pulled down
Roll the loaded dice for a pink slip race
I'm diving in deep and I'm breathing with my face
Yeah!

Rock me!
Roll me!
Love me!
Love me with your top down!
Rock me!
Roll me!
Love me!
Love me with your top down!

Come on baby, bring your girls around
Get in my back seat and love me with your top down

I'm a hole shot winner, see my front-end ride
My hands on the spinners as she closes her eyes
My tires screamin' hot and I'm pleasin' my pair
Finish line's comin' and I'm fightin' for air

Rock me!
Roll me!
Love me!
Love me with your top down!
Rock me!
Roll me!
Love me!
Love me with your top down!

Come on baby, bring your girls around
Get in my back seat and love me with your top down

(Love me, love me!)
I'm sure you've heard about Rosie
She's cruisin' all over town
(Love me, love me!)
She pulled me in with her story
Without making a sound
(Love me, love me!)
You know what she wants to do
When the top comes down
(Love me, love me!)

[Instrumental break]

Rock me!
Roll me!
Love me!
Love me with your top down!
Rock me!
Roll me!
Love me!
Love me with your top down!

Come on baby, bring your girls around
Get in my back seat and love me with your top down

Love me with your top down!
Love me with your top down!
Love me with your top down!
