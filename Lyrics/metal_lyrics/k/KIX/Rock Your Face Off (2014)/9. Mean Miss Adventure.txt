Miss Adventure come to me she say yeah yeah yeah
So mean so pretty as she please
Feel something coming over me
Miss Adventure grabs the wheel
Stomps the gas and tires peel

I used to ride alone
Go where I want yeah free
She takes me through the storm
Uh oh my mean Miss Adventure
Love you my mean Miss Adventure

Mad and sore I'm left alone I say yeah yeah yeah
Follow me my way back home
I like the way she makes me moan
Miss Adventure grabs the wheel
Stomps the gas and tires peel

I used to ride alone
Go where I want yeah free
She takes me through the storm
Uh oh my mean Miss Adventure
Love you my mean Miss Adventure

Straight into danger
Eyes like a stranger
All I really wanted was a ride with you
Ride to the mornin'
Gone without warning
AH I ever needed was one ride

She's out the door and I'm all alone say no no no no
I try to call her on the phone
She left me in the twilight zone, yeah
My Miss Adventure cold as steel
Gone for good it can't be real

And now you've heard my tale
You need to heed my warning
It's time for me to bail
Watch out for mean Miss Adventure
Mean Miss Adventure
Watch out for mean Miss Adventure
I love my mean Miss Adventure
I love my mean Miss Adventure
Watch out for mean Miss Adventure
