You hear my thunder, don't press your luck
I'm like a rattlesnake nobody's gonna rough me up
I got your number, we're taking a ride
I'm the undefeated champ I never lose a fight

Can't stop the show
Can't stop the show

Sometimes I fall back, but I never get stuck
I run over all the trash like a monster truck
Loaded like a shotgun, getting' ready to blow
My nerves are made of ice and I AM the devil you know

Can't stop the show
Can't stop the show

Gonna rattle your cage, you'll quake in your boots
Saddle me up, I'm spreadin' the news
This ain't the end of the road
Can't stop the show

I'm a nuclear meltdown, call in the cops
I'm super-electrified, a hundred thousand watts
I want my cake, and I'm gonna eat it too
I'm takin' it all and there won't be nothing left for you

Can't stop the show
Can't stop the show
Gonna draw the line, it's time to reload
This ain't the end of the road
Can't stop the show

Up against the ropes I'm feelin' wasted
I don't wanna lose no round
Taking shots I feel intoxicated
I don't wanna go down

After midnight, feeling that flow
You know when it feels right, it's time to reload
Can't stop the show

Can't stop the show
Can't stop the show
Gonna draw the line, it's time to reload
This ain't the end of the road
Can't stop the show
