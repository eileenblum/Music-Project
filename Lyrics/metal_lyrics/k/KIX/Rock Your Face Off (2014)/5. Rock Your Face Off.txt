We're out to spread the news, you people in the seats
We're coming after you, gonna get ya on your feet
Don't look back, we're right behind you
You're gonna eat our dust, as we blow right by you

I'm cornin' down, I'm cornin' down hard
I've had it floored right from the start

Lookout, we're gonna rock your face off and have some fun
Jump back, we're out to get ya everyone
Look out, we're gonna rock your face off
And you're gonna like it!

The word is spreadin' fast, the boys from the underground
Forget about the past, movin' at the speed of sound
Rev the engines up, push the pedal down
Rollin' like thunder, from town to town

I'm cornin' down, I'm cornin' down hard
I've had it floored right from the start

Lookout, we're gonna rock your face off and have some fun
Jump back, we're out to get ya everyone
Look out, we're gonna rock your face off
And you're gonna like it!
