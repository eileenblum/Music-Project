I love your shy innocent ways
You put me in my place in the early days
Staring into your eyes, midnight goodbyes
I'm sorry for all the lies, and making you cry
And your ability to forgive and forget and still loving me

I love you inside outside in (inside outside in)
I love you inside outside in (inside outside in)
Our whole world had changed, your beauty will never
Never ever fade

I love making love to you
And those two kids you talked me into
A roller coaster ride, side by side
For yesterday and today, I wrote this song just to say

I love you inside outside in (inside outside in)
I love you inside outside in (inside outside in)
Our whole world had changed, your beauty will never
Never ever fade

Staring into your eyes, never saying goodbye
I'm happy as can be, knowing that you'll grow old with me
I love you inside outside in (inside outside in)
I love you inside outside in (inside outside in)
Our whole world had changed, your beauty will never
Never ever fade

I love you in so many ways, yeah, yeah, yeah!
