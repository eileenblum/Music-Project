See her walking body's rockin', jaws are dropping, eyeballs are popping
Legs that tower, tail to devour, top to bottom assets she got âem
Love at first glance, can't help myself caught in a stare
Happens all the time, another secret love affair

I sniff out the ladies, looking for a treat
I just go crazy like a dog in heat

I'm hot on your trail, tail's on the wag
I'm hot on your tail, cat's out the bag
Going off the rails, tail's on the wag

Since I was a boy I always liked to look at the girls
I can get lost living in my own little world

Collar and chain me, do it doggy style
Know how to train me with a wink and a smile

I'm hot on your trail, tail's on the wag
I'm hot on your tail, cat's out the bag
Going off the rails, tail's on the wag

Gonna eat some eye candy, give her my paw
Makes me roll over, like an old hound dog

I'm hot on your trail, tail's on the wag
I'm hot on your tail, cat's out the bag
Going off the rails, tail's on the wag
