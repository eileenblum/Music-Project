I was thinking I'm getting my way
As she reached down and touched my leg
I wanted her to take me all the way
But she took an eternity

We were talkin' and laughin' all night long
Back seat of my Chevrolet
Slowly blew me away

She does all the right things to me
As we kiss breathlessly
She does all the right things to me
She does all the right things to me
I'm falling in love helplessly
She does all the right things to me

We wind up kissing at the county line
She says I'm yours and you'll be mine
I feel my jeans getting a little bit tighter
Windows steaming getting hot tonight

We were talkin' and laughin' all night long
Back seat of my Chevrolet
Slowly blew me away

She does all the right things to me
As we kiss breathlessly
She does all the right things to me
She does all the right things to me
I'm falling in love helplessly
She does all the right things to me

In my back seat with the Jack and the beer
I died as she whispered
âI love you' in my ear

She does all the right things to me
As we kiss breathlessly
She does all the right things to me
She does all the right things to me
I'm falling in love helplessly
She does all the right things to me
