I got your hot wire
I got your magic wand
I got the hot fire
To make your piston run

Babe I'm gonna tell ya, what I'm gonna do
Gonna turn you over, gonna blow a fuse

With the hot wire, hot wire
Throwin' sparks higher than a shootin' star
I got your hot wire, hot wire
Come with me, babe I'm gonna take you too far
I'm gonna start your car

You keep your fenders clean
I watch your bumper shine
You are my sex machine
I'm your ignition, I'm your voltage line

Babe I'm gonna tell ya, what I'm gonna do
Gonna turn you over, gonna blow a fuse

If you're caught out in the cold
Ain't gettin' what you should
Gonna get your motor movin'
I'll crawl under your hood

Yeah yeah yeah, make you feel alright
Yeah yeah yeah, connections tight
Can ya feel it, gettin' hot?
Can ya feel it, gettin hot, hot, hot, hot?

Hot wire, hot wire
Throwin sparks higher than the shootin' star
I got your hot wire, hot wire
Come with me, babe I'm gonna take you too
I'm gonna take you too far

Hot wire, hot wire
I got your hot wire, hot wire
I got your hot wire, hot wire
Come with me, babe I'm gonna take you too far
I'm gonna start your car
I got your hot wire
