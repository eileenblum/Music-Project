Red hot woman by the name of Jane
Rock 'n' roll queen, drive a man insane
Three piece suit'll grab up and gone
That three piece suit'll never turn you on

Oh-uh uh uh
Out all night, nothin' to do
Runnin' wild, out lookin' for you
Somebody tell me, whatever happened to Jane
Jane, Jane

Where's the bump and grind, the tease and sleeze
You turned around a hundred and eighty degrees
Tell me, tell me, I'm on my knees
Look me in the eye, uh uh - I said

Where, where, where's the same Jane?
Queen of rock and roll
Where, where, where's the same Jane?
Baby, where'd you go?
You use the party, spent all your money
Jane, why'd you have to change
We want the same, same, same Jane
Give me the same, same, same Jane

You are the come on queen, a barrell of fun
Baby you're even giving the stockings the run [?]
When you walk in a room, I gotta rock it from
Jane, Jane, Jane

It was love at last, a red hot kiss
Nothing should be better than this
It hurts too much, that's what I miss
Baby, don't deny it

Where, where, where's the same Jane?
Queen of rock and roll
Where, where, where's the same Jane?
Baby, where'd you go?
You use the party, spent all your money
Jane, why'd you have to change
We want the same, same, same Jane
Give me the same, same, same Jane

You got the red hot blood
I got the fire touch
Come on back baby

Where, where, where's the same Jane?
Queen of rock and roll
Where, where, where's the same Jane?
Baby, where'd you go?
