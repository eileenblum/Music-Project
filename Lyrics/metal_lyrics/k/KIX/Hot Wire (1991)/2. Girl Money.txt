Yeah yeah yeah
Girl money
Girl money
Girl money

I was sittin' alone
But not very long
She had a weakness for comin' on strong
She was licking my fingers
And drinking my booze
She whispered sweet nothings
I said 'Babe, is it true?'
What'd you say? - Show me yours &amp; I'll show you mine
What'd you do? - Ordered a bottle of the finest French wine
Where'd you go? - I was heading for heaven when she took the wheel
She took me to the cleaners, she knows how it feels

Out all night
Time to get started
Saving all week for her bedroom party
Dollar for her drink
Dollar for the honey
Burnin' a hole
Gonna spend my girl money
Girl money

Long legged Rosie from Baltimore
Took me farther than I've been before
Oh she loved me for those diamonds &amp; pearls
Took me for a ride
Took me around the world

What'd you day?
What'd you do?
Where'd you go?

Come on baby
Come on baby keep drivin' me crazy 
You know the story I'm speaking of
Champagne, red roses &amp; limos
Head first to the tunnel of love
Sometimes you're out
Sometimes you're in
Sometimes you lose
But sometimes you win
Playing the game 
Paying the price
We're throwing a party
And you're coming tonight Yeah yeah

Out all night
Time to get started
Saving all week for her bedroom party
Dollar for her drink
Dollar for the honey
Burnin' a hole
Gonna spend my girl money

Out all night
Time to get started
Saving all week for her bedroom party

Gonna spend my girl money
