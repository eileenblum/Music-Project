I've been up
I've been down 
I've doubel crossed ripped off and fooled around
I might bruise
I might bleed
But I fight to the finish to get what I need
If i'm love struck baby
Get out of my way 
Take what i want - i dont play to play
Dont need no bullet proof vest to save my life
Dont Need a blackjack, gun or a knife
I've got 

Fireballs - they're big and they're blue
Fireballs - they're burning for you
Fireballs - hear the thunder and noise
Fireballs - search and destory

It's a bird 
It's a plane
It's an all night-rock-n-roll ball of flame
Shake your Shakr
Shout your shout
If it's in ya baby
It's got to come out 
Vocano eruption
It's hot and it's mean
Like an angry beat that's starting to steam
Get out of my way, i'll mow you down 
The dirty boys are comin' to town
We got 

Fireballs - they're big and they're blue
Fireballs - they're burning for you
Fireballs - hear the thunder and noise
Fireballs - search and destory

There's nohting you can do 
We're coming after you

Fireballs - they're big and they're blue
Fireballs - they're burning for you
Fireballs - hear the thunder and noise
Fireballs - it's my bundle of joy
Fireballs - they're big and they're blue
Fireballs - they're burning for you
Fireballs - hear the thunder and noise
Fireballs - search and destory
Fireballs (yeah)
Fireballs
Fireballs (yeah yeah)
Fireballs hey

There ain't nohting you can do 
We're coming after you,
