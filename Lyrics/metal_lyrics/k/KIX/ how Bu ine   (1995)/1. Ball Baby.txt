I wanna tell you a story
About a number on the wall
I wanna tell you a story
About a girl who's got it all
Strike one - A swing and a miss
I didn't stand a chance
Strike two - Let's boog-a-loo
But she didn't do the dance
Strike three you're out - There ain't no doubt
Give it up and go to bed
Grab the phone, givin' Kay a bone
Their evicted friend
You wanna send and get

Ball baby ball
For a good time you should call
Your number on the wall
For ball baby ball
Ball baby ball

I picked up the phone she said I'm all alone
And ooh she sounds so sweet
She said ready or not I'm gonna get ya hot
At the Hotel Magnifique
Well she opened the door
Threw me on the floor
I was lost in ecstacy
I grabbed her stuff
There was more than enough
She turned out to be
She's got plans for me

Ball baby ball
For a good time you should call
Your number on the wall
For ball baby ball
Ball baby ball

Oh, she's got it all

[Solo]

What you see ain't what you get
My hands are shakin'
I'm a nervous wreck
I pried - beneath those curls
But boys will be boys - And boys will be girls

Ball baby ball
For a good time you should call
The number on the wall
For ball baby ball
Ball baby ball
For a good time you should call
The number on the wall
For ball baby ball
Ball baby ball
(Do do do)
(Do do do)
(Do do do)
(Do do do)
Give me a call (do do do)
Ball baby - yeah (do do do)
Give me a call (do do do)
Ball baby - For a good time (do do do)
She got it all (do do do)
Ball baby ball (do do do)
Ball baby ball
Ball baby ball
Ball baby ball
Ball baby ball
