Call and I will come

I get a message that you're all alone and going down
I know what you need someone to go around
Someone to hold on to
Until you feed the hunger that leaves you
Shaking underneath the sheets
All ya gotta do is call

911
911
911
Call and I will come

So there you are in your empty bed
But you must take time for a little relief
You try to shut down the voice in your head
The one that's telling you to turn up the heat
Then slowly, so slowly
You try to satisfy, why don't you
Let me help you make it to the other side
Girl why don't you pick the phone

911
911
911
Call and I will come

Someone to hold on to
Until you feed the hunger that leaves you
Shaking underneath the sheets
Baby I can hear you breathing
Yeah - breathing

Just call me
