Ooh, she was a ticking time bomb
Time bomb ready to blow
All the girls were charmed for so long
To find out what they didn't know

I took them to the Kasbah
I took them to my room
I gave her a lick that made her tick
She went crash bang boom

Baby time bomb
Shake shakin' the ground
Baby time bomb
I'm going down

I can't wait
To feel her detonate
Baby time bomb
Tick tickin' away

She was the goddess Venus
Ooh, my baby come to life
I had the power to dream it
I said, baby, let it be tonight

Countdown to explosion
Take me to your wonderland
Took a walk she was a fireball
She said a wham bam slam
Bang bang

Baby time bomb
Shake, shakin' the ground
Baby time bomb
I'm going down

Leave me alone
In my blasting zone
With my baby time bomb
Tick tickin' away
