Is it a tender love, is it secure
Is he a rich boy, or is he poor
Don't see no diamond ring on her hand
Is he a stray cat, is he a man
Is it sour, is it sweet
Can't ya, can't ya get that boy off the street
Is it half, is it whole
Mama, mama nice guys don't rock and roll
Well you're nice on ice
Well you're nice on ice
Well you're nice on ice
Well you're nice on ice
Cinderella
Nursery rhyme
You might never get to school on time
Raise you glass
Raise some hell
Get you slippers when the clock strikes twelve
Have your cake, eat it too
Let me show ya what a fella can do, can do to you
Well you're nice on ice
Well you're nice on ice
Well you're nice on ice
Well you're nice on ice
I guess I got bad manners
But I don't carry a gun
Forget your moral standards
Just trying to have a little fun
Won't be your Romeo, shining knight
You can tippy toe but look out tonight
You leave your mom a note, like you should
Oh. sometimes a bad boy feels so good
Yeah
Well you're nice on ice
Well you're nice on ice
Well you're nice on ice
Well you're nice on ice
