I picked you up when you were steaming hot
You gave me the bug baby so they gave me a shot
You took my ring and threw it on the floor
Well I picked it up, just dusted it off
And I was back for more
So then I went back for more
But ya threw me a pass and a mouth full of sass
She's spreading love pollution
She spread love pollution
Her love left me in pain
So I washed it down the drain
Ain't that a shame
I asked her how much she told me love was free
She gave me the green light well there's no stoppin' me
Then she threw me a pass and with a mouth full of sass
She's spreading love pollution
She spread love pollution
Oh her love left me in pain
So I washed it down the drain
Ain't it a shame
She's spreading wo oh oh oh
Lookout
Oh Oh Ohhhhhh. Give a hoot
The queen she stopped it chilled me to the bone
Didn't read the sign boy
You entered the danger zone
Entered the danger zone
Aw then she threw me a pass and with a mouth full of sass
She's spreading love pollution
She spread love pollution
Oh don't ya come 'round no more
Because I have to lock the door
She spread love pollution
She spread love pollution
Her love left me in pain
So I washed it down the drain
Ain't that a. shaaaaaame (She's spreading love pollution)
Ohhhhhhh (She's spreading love pollution)
Ohhhhhhh (She's spreading love pollution)
(She's spreading love pollution)
Oh
