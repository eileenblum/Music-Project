Once upon a time in a deserted little town
An incubated boy was born and the tried to put him down
Didn't have no muscles here
Didn't have no fat
But when he opened up his mouth ya heard the biggest trap
They called him big mouth
Big trap
Loud mouth
Mighty mouth
Here comes the M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-Mighty mouth
No silver spoon, grew up too soon out on the dirt
He took a big deep breath and popped the buttons off his shirt
He's no zero oh he's a hero
He's every mother's dream
And all the boys could feel the noise
They'd shake when they'd hear him scream
They called him big mouth
Big trap
Loud mouth
Mighty mouth
