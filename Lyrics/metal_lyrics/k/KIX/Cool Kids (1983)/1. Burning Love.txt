You know I saw my baby
One crazy night
Cold as ice, she came at me
With words that cut like a knife
But if she don't stop complaining
About my reckless ways
So bittersweet she cuts so deep
Sad and lonely night and day

No no no no baby
You got a burning love
Some way you get right to me
With your burning love

How can you tell a girl who hides inside
Just what it is you feel
We're gonna take and a little hurt
To make the tears you cry hard to believe
But she don't stop complaining
About my reckless ways
So bitter sweet she cuts so deep
Sad and lonely night and day

No no no no baby
You got a burning love
Some way you get right to me
With your burning love
