Hey hey hey
You should see the look that she gave to me
No no no that's restless blood
That's push and shove
Hey hey hey
Should see the scars that you put on me
And no no no that's restless blood
That's push and shove
What ya gotta say yeah. was I invited
Leave me lying on the floor
Keep me coming, keep me coming, keep me coming
Oh that's restless blood
Oh that's restless blood
Hey hey hey
She's like the devil down underneath
No no no that's restless blood
That's push and shove
Hey hey hey she bites a marble between her teeth
No no no that's restless blood
That's push and shove
She's a red hot wire
With balls of fire
Leave's me lying on the floor
Keeps me coming, keeps me coming, keeps me coming
Oh that's restless blood
Oh that's restless blood
Oh that's restless blood
Oh that's restless blood
She has a face of an angel her heart is a
She's a dangerous soul that plays hard and plays deep
Poisonous squeeze of the snake in the bush
When her love starts to bleed
She'll give you a push
Oh that's restless blood
Oh that's restless blood
Oh that's restless blood
Oh that's restless blood
