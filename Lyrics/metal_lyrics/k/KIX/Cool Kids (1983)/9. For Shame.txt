For shame it had to be like that
For shame it had to be like that
Couldn't leave the boy uninvited
Could of had you so excited

For shame it had to be like that
For shame it had to be like that
Tonight I'm gonna love you just the same
Oh yeah
Tonight I'm gonna love you 'til the end

For shame it had to stop like that
For shame it had to stop like that
Could of had you for all last summer
Found my keys but lost your number

For shame it had to stop like that
For shame it had to stop like that
Tonight I'm gonna love you just the same
Tonight I'm gonna love you 'til the end

Climbed your window but I fell behind it
Could of had you so excited
For shame it had to be like that
For shame it had to be like that
Tonight I'm gonna love you just the same
Oh yeah
Tonight I'm gonna love you 'til the end
For shame
