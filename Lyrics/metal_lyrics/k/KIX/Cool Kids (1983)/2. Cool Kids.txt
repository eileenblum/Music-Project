Hey what'cha gonna do on Friday night?
Where ya gonna go? We gotta find some action
Baby, I'll meet ya at the Paradise, start a little chain reaction
Hey anybody got a cigarette, thanks, anybody here got a dime
I heard that Frankie's got a blue Corvette, she said to call her any time

Anybody got a situation, is there any place to go?

We want cool kids out on the corner
Cool kids, out on a limb
Cool kids looking for someone, looking for something
Looking for somebody, tonight
K-k-kids are all right

We go cruising down the avenue
Lean out the window at the stop light
Just trying to shake up to the Main Street blues
Tryin' to break out into the hot night

Anybody got a invitation, is there any place to go?

We want cool kids out on the corner
Cool kids, out on a limb
Cool kids looking for someone, looking for something
Looking for somebody, tonight
K-k-kids are all right

Anybody got an invitation is there any place to go

We want cool kids, so cool
We want cool kids
We want cool kids

C-c-cool kids, out on the corner, cool kids, out tonight
Cool kids, looking for trouble, cool kids
C-c-cool kids, out on the corner, cool kids, out tonight
Cool kids, looking for trouble, cool kids

C-c-cool kids, cool kids, cool kids, oh
Cool kids, I wanna be cool, I wanna be cool
Cool kids, kids are all right
Cool kids, out on the corner, cool kids
