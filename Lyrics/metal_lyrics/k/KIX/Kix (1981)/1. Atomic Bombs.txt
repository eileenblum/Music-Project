My arms around you
Ya better keep your head low
All dressed up
No place to go
Make love to you all night long
Listen to atomic bombs

Hear the people scratch
On the shelter door
Leave us alone
Nobody lives here no more
Make love to you all night long
Listen to atomic bombs

Safe and sound you're next to me
Close the door on World War Three
Oh just kick your shoes off, sing a song
Listen to atomic bombs

I've been waiting here
Through all your fears
Close your eyes and look away
Hear the bombers blast
Your times come at last
So pray if you stay

Kick your shoes off sing a song
Listen to atomic bombs
Make love to you all night long
Listen to atomic bombs
