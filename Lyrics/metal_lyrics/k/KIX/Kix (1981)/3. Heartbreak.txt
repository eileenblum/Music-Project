She got love - More than I need
She got love - She's making me weak
I got heartache
I got love smeared all over my face
I got heartache
She got love - She's making me weak
Ya' see the teardrops rolling down my cheek
I got heartache
I got love smeared all over my face
I got heartache - Oh wo
(He's got heartache) Oh no
(He's got heartache)
(He's got heartache) Heartache
She got love she's making me burn
Like a fool ya' know I'll never learn
She had heartbreak
She said love you are my biggest mistake
She had heartache
Oh well she had heartache
We had love - but I made her cry
She caught me lying in an alibi
She had heartbreak
She said love you are my biggest mistake
She had heartbreak - Oh wo
(She had heartbreak) Oh no
(She had heartbreak)
(She had heartbreak) heartbreak
I said love please make me strong
I hope this drug don't last too long
I got heartache
I got love smeared all over my face
I got heartache - all over my face yeah (Heartbreak)
I said love don't let me down
I'll make it up to you the next time around I got heartache
I got love smeared all over the place
I got heartache - Oh wo
(He's got heartache) Oh no
(He's got heartache) Heartbreak
(He's got heartache)
(He's got heartache)
(He's got heartache)
