Oh what an explosion, my hearts gonna fail
It was 6.8 on the Richter scale
A vision of beauty, well I'm caught in a stare
A red light turns green - not even aware
I just can't help it - I'm daydreaming at night
But just one look and it's love at first sight
It was love -- love at first sight
Love - Love at first sight
Love - Love at first sight
Love - Love at first sight
Well I found love -- but love ain't enough
So gimme that gimme that all that stuff
I'm free and easy
I got 1, 2, 3, 4 - Pretty girl friends I got to keep on getting while the
Getting is good
Now 5, 6, 7, 8 - I would if I could
My dick was very hard and she dropped down to her knees
If that's the way she cooks such a hypermaniac
It was love - love at first sight
Love - Love at first sight
Love - Love at first sight
Love - Love at first sight
It was love - Love at first sight
I said love - Love at first sight
No it was love can't ya' see
Love at first sight
Oh - Give me a bite
