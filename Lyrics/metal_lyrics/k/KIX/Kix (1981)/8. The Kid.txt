Gotta get rid of the kid cause the kid's a crowd
Gotta get rid of the kid cause the kid's too loud
Every time my time finds time for a wire
He's all night, he's all night, he's all night, he's all night
Last night John walked home with Mary Lou
John said to Mary, "Well I know what to do."
He said, "My place is the right place for us two."
He's all right, he's all right, he's all right, he's all right
I can feel your love running down my spine
I can feel your love mixing up with mine. Oh!
But here comes the kid come knocking on my door
Well, hey kid -- the kid's a crowd
We gotta get rid of the kid
Hey kid! The kid's too loud
We gotta get rid of the kid
Is my lady lonely, and I can tell her only
He's all right, he's all right, he's all right
He's all right, he's all right, he's all right, he's all right
Oh I can feel your love run down my spine
And I can feel your love mixing up with mine. Oh.
But here comes the kid come knocking on my door
Hey kid! The kid's a crowd
We gotta get rid of the kid
Hey kid! The kid's too loud
We gotta get rid of the kid
Hey kid! What'dya want anyway
We gotta get rid of the kid
Hey kid!
We gotta get rid of the kid
(Oh wow. Hey kid. What'dya need? Candy? Here's a quarter, beat it. You're
Worse than a hangover. I got a hangover. It hurts. It hurts bad.)
