(imitating Elmer Fudd)
Be ve-e-ewy v-e-eewy qwiet...
It's woman season
I'm woman huntin
hahahahahahahaha

Every time I go woman huntin
It always seems to blow up in my face

See, I don't always get the things I want
But a sweet, kind, loving, forgiving, understanding,
beautiful, rich, c*ck-sucking nymphomaniac
would be nice every now and thenÂ !

Hey, I'm a nice guy
I bathe
Sure I got blue balls, so what 
Doesn't make me a bad person
Oh you know thisÂ ?

One example,
The girl that walked out on me on New Year's Eve
Well she came back last night and she said
"I don't have to go home tonight"
I said "alright"

So once again,
I go out and I buy a case of cold, cold Heinekin
And I had it out in the van, it was the big bottle,
Not the little bottle, the big bottle of Jack Daniels

I had TWO left, 
Two ludes for the girl of my wet dreams

Now, once again,
She drinks my beer,
She drinks my whiskey
She does my quualudes

Five in the morning comes,
Note:  Five has come,
Steve has yet to come
Five in the morning comes

And this girl looks at me
In a most peculiar way
She is not looking very well
From her eyes come these 
big, big, big, big tears
Rolling all over her face
Down into her chest and 
Into her underwear

And she's got those big green snot bubbles
You know - it's not runny,
It's big thick sh*t

And she's got drool
This sh*t had legs,
I don't know what the f*ck it was

It was nothing but
Tears and Snot and Drool, oh myÂ !
Tears and Snot and Drool, oh myÂ !
Tears and Snot and Drool, oh myÂ !
Tears and Snot and Drool, oh myÂ !

So she's not looking very well, 
We've established that, rightÂ ?

So she looks at me and says
"Stevie.....I feel sick.  I gotta go home now."

And she THREW UP all over the floor

It was disgusting
It smelled really, really bad
It smelled like....it smelled like puke
Only puke smells like puke
You can have farts that don't smell like puke
Nothing smells like puke but real puke
The sh*t was steamin
It was on my carpet
I was there just to have a good time with the lady
I took her out for dinner, and she puts dinner on my carpet
In a steaming heap of puke
I'm sorry, I was PISSED

So I looked at her, and I said
"You....no good for nuthin
Fuzzy headed, big-eyed
Booger-nosed, blow-me lips
Double-chin, flat chested, hairy back,
Big fat hairy a** "

She had crowbar black pubic hair
And she had cellulitic legs
And she did NOT shave her legs,
So if to touch it pricked, it pricked to touch 'em
To touch it pricked, it pricked to touch 'em,
She had big feet like Bozo the Clown
Oh she weebled but she won't fall down

I said "You get your teary, snotty, droolin,
F*ckin hairy a** outta my home you
Whore-bag pig bitchÂ !"

What would you doÂ ?
What would YOU doÂ ?

I said "Go outside and do that"
I don't need this
I'll go to the Geisha house
Find a real whore

Quit throwing up
Sh*t stinks
Just stop it

And I said...
Don't tell me no
Tell me yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't tell me no
Tell me yeah, yeah, yeah

And she threw up AGAINÂ !!

Tell me, tell me that
Tell me, tell me that
Tell me, tell me that
Can I lubricate your lips?
Can't ya hear me sayÂ ?

Tell me, tell me that
Can I sink your battleshipÂ ?
Can't ya hear me sayÂ ?

I know I ain't a Romeo
I know you got no place to go
I need your love
I want my share

Well nuh-uh, and no-no-no
Tell me uh-huh, and yeah yeah yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh oh oh oh,
Tell me yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh oh,
Tell me yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh oh,
Tell me yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh oh,
Tell me yeah yeah yeah
