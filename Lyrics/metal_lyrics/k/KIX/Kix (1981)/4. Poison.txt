I wanna tell you a story about a girl that I know
I wanna give you a warning about a
Place where I don't go
She put poison in my coffee, put poison in my heart
She put poison in my bedroom,
Yeah, poison from the start
I've been up and I've been down - with this
Little girl that I just found
She's so sweet she's so sweet she tells me precious lies
What've I got to do to get that girl to treat me right
She put poison in my coffee, put poison in my heart
She put poison in my bedroom, put poison from the start
(She p p p poison) I can't fight it
(She p p p poison) Ain't complaining'
(She p p p poison) I got to watch out for myself
Why don't ya bite somebody else
I give her honey in the night time,
Give her honey in the light
I give her honey on the left hand, I
Give her honey on the right
I give her sweet things (baby)
Like diamond rings for ya (baby)
Her heart pounds but it ain't too sweet
Like a jealous song with a jealous beat
She put poison in my coffee, put poison in my heart
She put poison in my bedroom, put poison from the start
(She p p p poison) I can't fight it
(She p p p poison) Ain't complaining'
(She p p p poison) I got to watch out for myself
Why don't ya bite somebody else
She'll give me strychnine on the table
Sweet cyanide on the floor
See the cross bones on the label
Keep me comin' back for more
Oh no
No no
No no
No no
No no no no no no
She put poison in my coffee
Put poison in my heart
Well she's a bitch and I hate to complain
She put poison in my bedroom
Put poison from the start.
(She put p p poison) I can't fight her
(She put p p poison) Ain't complainin
(She put p p poison) I got to watch out for myself
Why don't ya bite somebody else
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
