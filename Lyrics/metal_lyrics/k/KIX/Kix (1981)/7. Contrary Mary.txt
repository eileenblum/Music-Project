Contrary Mary
Contrary Mary
Contrary Mary
Contrary Mary
Well the first time that I saw ya
Did ya say you'd never never never come back
But the second time I saw ya
You were sitting in my Cadillac
Sticks and stones may break my bones
We didn't think at all girl
But ya stuck to me like something stuck in my eye
(Say hey hey baby) People think that you're a big shot
(Say hey hey baby) Keep on acting like a hot shot
(Hey hey hey) My mama - my mama - my mama told me not to fool around with you
(You hey you who) Contrary Mary
(You hey you who) Contrary Mary
(You hey you who) Contrary Mary
(You hey you who) Contrary Mary

Well they told me you don't want me
You threw my suitcase out the door
But ya can't do nothing with the sister of love
So ya rock it where you were before
Mary Mary quite contrary
How does your love life go
You see my nose is clean if you know what
I mean got lines waiting three in a row

[CHORUS]

(You hey you hey)
(You hey you hey)
(You hey you hey)
(You hey you hey)

Baby baby can't you see
What your love has done to me
I take you places all of the time
Baby baby, now make up your mind

(You hey you who) Contrary Mary
(You hey you who) Contrary Mary
(You hey you who) Contrary Mary
(You hey you who) Contrary Mary

Hey hey hey - Mary Mary
Hey hey hey - Mary Mary
Hey hey hey - Mary Mary

Hey hey hey - Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
