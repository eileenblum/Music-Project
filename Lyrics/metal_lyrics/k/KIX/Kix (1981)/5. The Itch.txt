Woke up this morning
Fell out of bed
An all night juke box
Pounding in my head
Was I moving on Susie
Was I stomping on Jane
I was waiting for the thunder
Standing in the rain
I've been itching all over
I don't know know know which way is which
I got the itch (I got it)
I got the itch (I got it)
I got the itch (I got it)
I got the itch
I got it
If I had a camera
I'd take a picture of you
I'd get a full size blow up
And some wallet size too
I'd hang it up in my bedroom
And every time I walk in
I bend over my pillow
And you'd be under my skin
I been itching all over
Why don't you turn on the switch
I got the itch (I got it)
I got the itch (I got it)
I got the itch (I got it)
I got the itch
I got it
Itch, itch, itch, itch, itch,
I got ants in my pants Let's dance
Hey boy - My dad he's got it
Hey boy - My mom she's got it
Hey boy - The dog he's got it
Hey boy - The boy's they got it
I've been itching all over
I don't know but ain't it a b*tch
