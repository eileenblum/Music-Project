Don't scream when you realize
Don't scream when you tow the line
Remember the craze back in '65
Wasn't it great to be alive
(Shake) I'm gonna shake to the broken bone
(Shout) I'm gonna shout it on the telephone
(Wake Up)Gonna wake up the old folks home
Gonna let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Don't ask me no green eyed questions
Why we do what we do what we did
I can't give you no fancy answers
'cause KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
Used to go out with Betty Boop
Spin like a top and a hula-hoop
The bubble gum twisted in my hair
I keep chewing like I don't care
I I can fly like Superman
I get my kicks from kick-the-can
I save my box tops off of Cheerios
I'm saving up for one of those
Don't ask me green eyed questions
Why we do what we do what we did
I can't give you no fancy answers
'Cause KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids Oh
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
1 2 3 4 Ohhhhhhh
Don't scream when you realize
Don't scream when you tow the line
Remember the craze back in '65
Wasn't it great to be alive
(Shake) I'm gonna shake to the broken bone
(Shout) I'm gonna shout it on the telephone
Gonna wake up the old folks home
Gonna let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Don't ask me no green eyed questions
Why we do what we do what we did
I can't give you no fancy answers
'Cause KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
Got to get got to get
KIX are for kids
Ooooo
Kix are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
KIX are for kids
Silly rabbit
