I sit and watch her pass my window
Every morning
And then I think and wonder why
I'm alone here
When I go out in the evening
To the night clubs
And I get my head just right
I need a come on for her heart
I need a come on in the dark
I need a come on that'll make her stay

Cause she's walkin' away
And I don't know how to stop her
Cause she's walkin'
Walkin' away

I get so tongue tied when I see her
Hiding in the shadows
Don't need to say the wrong thing now
I don't wanna lose her
Should I tell her I'm a doctor
Or a lawyer
Should I tell 100 lies
I need a come on for her heart
I need a come on in the dark
I need a come on that'll make her stay

Walkin' away
Cause you're walkin' away
Don't keep walkin'
Don't keep walkin'
Walkin' away
Cause you're walkin' away
Cause you're walkin' away
Don't keep walkin' - Don't keep walkin'
Walkin' away - away - away
Cause you're walkin' away
Cause you're walkin' away
Cause you're walkin' away
Cause you're walkin' away
