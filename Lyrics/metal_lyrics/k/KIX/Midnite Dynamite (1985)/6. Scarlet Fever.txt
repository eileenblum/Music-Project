Poison from her red lips
And her kiss
Why'd it taste so sweet
You put me on the sick list
I was fine
You knocked me off my feet
It's a poison
So strong
That it won't let go
Strange emotion
But what hit me
Baby I don't know

Na na na na na na
All that I see
Is a color in my head
Na na na na na na
I've got the disease
From the lips painted red

Scarlet fever
I got it bad
Contageous all the way
Scarlet fever
In my head
It's red hot night and day
Yeah - Yeah - Yeah

My heart was barley beating
Cold chills
Running down my spine
My meter wasn't reading
Overload
Past the danger line
Sweet seduction
With a look she stopped me in my tracks
Panic button
With a touch there's no turning back

Na na na na na na
Red hot lips
The... flickers and the...
Na na na na na na
I can't walk away
You are the hunter
And I am the prey

Poison from her red lips
And her kiss
Why'd it taste so sweet
You put me on the sick list
I was fine
You knocked me off my feet
