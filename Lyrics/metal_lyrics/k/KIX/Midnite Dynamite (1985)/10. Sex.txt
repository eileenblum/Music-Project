I hear the strangest things echo through the walls
Crash bang boom bang bump-a-dee-bump...
How much more can I stand
I pounded on the pipes
I call on the phone
Well there they go again...

Sex - Sex - Sex
Sex - Sex - Sex
Uh - Sex - Uh
Sex - Sex

I see them come I see them go
But somehow they look the same
Miniskirts and see-through shirts
A high heel crying shame
Check in and checkin' out
Well this ain't no sleaze hotel
Calling 'til the daylight comes
But check-out time is twelve

Yeah she's on the walls
The bed springs squeak
But the mating call
Makes a strong man weak

Sex - Sex - Sex
I want Apartment B
Sex - Sex - Sex
One floor on top of me
Uh - Sex - Uh
Oh baby up 'til now
Sex - Sex

My doors always open
My phones on the hook
My mailbox is waiting
My names in the book
Got ads in the paper
But nobody cares
Apartment A's lonely
The action's upstairs

Sex - Sex - Sex
Sex - Sex - Sex
Sex

Sex - Sex - Sex
I want some
Sex - Sex
You got him forget about me
Sex - Sex - Sex
Oh no
Sex - Sex

(See ya)
