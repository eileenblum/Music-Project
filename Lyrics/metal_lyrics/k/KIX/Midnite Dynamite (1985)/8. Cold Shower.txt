Hot hot nights
Keep falling down
Got to hold on tight

Better go take myself a cold cold shower
Baby's getting hotter by the hour
Tales taller the the Eifel tower
Got to go take myself a cold cold shower
So I guess I'm gonna make myself a bed on the floor
You know we never got this far before
Give me your love give me all you got
So cool cool
So hot hot

Guess I'm gonna wait all night for you
In a hot flash - down on my knees
Think about the things I'd do to you
When she left - me
Oh
Left me in a cold cold cold cold shower
Left me in a cold cold cold cold shower

I was looking at you
You was looking at me
It was a hot tease
About a hundred degrees
Ya drive ma crazy
Ya drive me wild
You were a toy in the store
I was a helpless child
Guess I'm gonna make myself a bed on the floor
You know we never got this far before
Give me your love
Give me all you got
So cool cool
So hot hot

So I guess I'm gonna make myself a bed on the floor
Ya know we never got this far before
Give me your love
Give me all you got
So cool cool
So hot hot
I better go take myself a cold cold shower
Things getting hotter by the hour
Tales taller than the Eifel tower
Better go take myself
A cold shower
