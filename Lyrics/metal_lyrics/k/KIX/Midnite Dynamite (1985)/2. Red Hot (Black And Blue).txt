Love cuts
Love bites
Love knocks on your door
Wakes you up
Makes you hot
Rock and roll on the floor
Love's a rough volcano
Love is a nuclear bomb
When it hits - it hits so hard and so long

Red red hot
Black and blue
Red red hot
I'd like to melt inside of you

So hot
So wet
200 degrees
Big shot
No sweat
But I still can't breathe
Loves a rough volcano
Love is a nuclear bomb
When it hits, it hits so hard and so long

Red red hot
Black and blue
Red red hot
I'd like to melt inside of you

Love kills
Love bites
Like guns
Like knives

Red red hot
Black and blue
Red red hot
I'd like to melt inside of you

Love cuts
Love bites
Love knocks on your door
Wakes you up
Makes you hot
Rock and roll on the floor

Red hot
Red red hot yeah
Red hot
Red red red hot hot hot oh yeah
