First you wanna say yes then you wanna say no
You're just like the rest, they come and they go
I know that you're his but you say that you're mine
Instead of making my love you're making up lies
You lie like a rug
You lie lie lie lie lie
Lie like a rug (She lies - she lies - don't ya deny it)
I don't need it
I don't want it
I've been told, told about you

You lie like a rug (Hey)
You lie like a rug (Whoo)
You lie like a rug (Hey)
You lie like a rug

Treat me like a doormat
You walk all over me
Yeah it's your eighty-fourth moment of insincerity
Lies in the bedroom
Lie in the tub
Lie like a rug

You lie lie lie
Lie like a rug (She lies - She lies -Don't you deny it)
I don't want it
I don't need it
I've been told, told about you.

[Chorus:]
First you wanna say yes then you wanna say no
You're just like the rest, they come and they go
I know that you're his but you say that you're mine
Instead of making my love you're making up lies
You lie like a rug
You lie lie lie lie lie
Lie like a rug (She lies - she lies - don't ya deny it)
I don't need it
I don't want it
I've been told, told about you

Lie like a rug
Oh lie lie lie lie lie
Lie like a rug (She lies - She lies - Don't you deny it)
Lie - Lie
Lie - Lie
Lie - Lie
Lie - Lie
Lie - Like a rug

[Chorus]
