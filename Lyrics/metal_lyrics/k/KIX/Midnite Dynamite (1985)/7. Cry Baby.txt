Cry - cry - cry - cry

Cry baby
Put a teardrop in my coffee
Cry baby
With a tear you know you're mine
Whenever you walk you get
Well you're getting my shoulder wet
You use tears like a flower uses bees
But that's all right
You started to cry about a quarter to four
Layin' a puddle on the hard wood floor
Ran like a... through the bedroom door

Cry baby
Cry baby
Ball baby ball
Cry baby
Cry baby
Ya cry cry cry

High water
Cause your eyes are like a fountain
Man over
I can't swim I'm gonna drown
You're turing the faucet on
Like an angel on the...
I'm going down down down
In an ocean of tears
Bring me along
But I don't regret
You bring me down
I wanna stay wet
...

Cry cry cry
Cry baby
Cry cry cry
But that's all right
Cry cry cry baby
Cry cry cry baby
Cry cry cry baby
