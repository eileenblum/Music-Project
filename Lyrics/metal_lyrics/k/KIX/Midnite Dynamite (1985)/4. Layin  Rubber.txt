Yeah - No - Stop - Go
Yeah - No - Stop - Go
Yeah - No - Stop - Go
Yeah yeah
No no
Stop stop
Go go

Run run run the red light
Got no license for love
Burn burn burn the headlight
But we can't see far enough
Go around and round and round
Never cross the finish line
Round and round and round
I'm tired of wasting my time

Long long way to drive
The back seats turned to ice
Give me all you got or none at all

Pinning the needle
Cruising for midnite thrills
Stuck in the middle
We were just spinning our wheels
Pushin' the pedal
Listen to the tires squeal
We were layin' rubber (Layin' rubber)
Layin' rubber (Layin' rubber)
Yeah

Walk walk walk the fast lane
Slow me down to a tease
Talk talk talk a nice game
But she never never gives me the keys
Go around and round and round
Drivin' me around the block
Around and round and round
Ya never hit my favorite spot

Long long way to come
To get nothing done
One foot on the break
One on the gas

Yeah - No - Stop - Go
Yeah - No - Stop - Go
Yeah - No - Stop - Go
Yeah yeah
No no
Stop stop
Go go

One foot on the brake
Then I rev my love
Burn burn burn the tires out

Yeah - No - Stop - Go - Yeah - No - Stop
