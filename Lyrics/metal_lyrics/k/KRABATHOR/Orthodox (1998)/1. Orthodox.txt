Give you soul to devil
Sacrifice your life
Young body on altar
You're never gonna die!
We're never gonna die

Look at my hands, look at my face, evil one
And tell me what do you see?
Vision of perpetual holocaust
Just what we wanna be

we feel what we want
we feel what we want
we do what we want
we do what we want
we stay as we want
TO BE!!!
ORTHODOX!!!!

We're never gonna die!

Listen to the persistent beat of your heart
Don't believe the justifiable lies
Who uses to speak to you by two different mouths!
So he is dead for us!

we feel what we want
we feel what we want
we do what we want
we do what we want
we stay as we want
TO BE!!!
ORTHODOX!!!!
