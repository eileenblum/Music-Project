Your eyes are able to wake me up
There is something nice
There is something pursuing me
And something what can hurts
You show me how to go so close
I am little bit scared
You tell me don't be afraid
Death can be treacherous
Let's start this way, Let's start this pain
Let's start this love, Let's start this wrath
Let's start this dream, Let's start this scream
Let's start this luck, Let's start this strike

About Death-death breathes in breath
About Death-death infects your blood
About Death-death still cares for you
About Death-death gives you lust

I don't like to be deceived
I don't like to be a liar
If I'll believe
Won't you want to kill me?
I will hold out my hand
I'll feel the glow
I'll step into your soul
I'll feel death inside

Let's start this way, Let's start this pain
Let's start this love, Let's start this wrath
Let's start this dream, Let's start this scream
Let's start this luck, Let's start this strike

About Death-death breathes in breath
About Death-death infects your blood
About Death-death still cares for you
About Death-death gives you lust
