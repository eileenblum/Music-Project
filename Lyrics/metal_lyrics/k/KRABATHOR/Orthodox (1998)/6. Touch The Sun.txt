Child is walking down the streets
And looking for the play things
Never to hurry to nowhere
And nothing to know about cares

The rays give him power
To go through evil
And you are telling
"you have to be more happy than me"

It's so easy, not to be worry It's so easy, to touch the sun

When the sun will lead him
He cannot be scared
Sun cares about his steps
And keeps his eyes open

Mother will die so painfully
As she feels the pain of her child
Any mother wants to see
Death of her child
