Army of hungry maggots
We are parasites
We will eat you, we will suck you
That's just what we like
Don't resist to establishment
State machinery
Never try to comment our legal robbery
Work of others is our business
We are parasites!
How easy to steal your money
That's our only job

We're going to follow you
To follow till you die
Never try comment this profitable crime!

Leave us alone, just let us live
Leave us alone, that's our business

As a shadow at your heals
We will be with you
We miss only character
And character is no good
We keep smiling on your face
Don't tell we are not friends!
Don't tell our only interest
Is nothing other than pelf
Colony of hungry maggots
We are parasites
Colony of blood suckers
We still need new blood

We're going to follow you
To follow till you die
Never try comment this profitable crime!

We are bleeding for you!!!
