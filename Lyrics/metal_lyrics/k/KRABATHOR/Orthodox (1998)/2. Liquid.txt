You are slowly falling down
Down and down into the deep
You are living from dreams
Dreams and dreams, till the end

It is better not to see through the eyes
It is better to be open minded
Everything is so far away
When you want to find that

You are walking down the streets
You are feeling so much blind
Are you stranger in your mind?
Are you thinking how to die?
Die...by this way of dying

Liquid, in your mind
Liquid, you can fly
Liquid sweet dreams
Sweet dreams...till the end

You are waiting for help
Help and help from an angel
You are screaming into the night
Night and night, this is the danger

It is better not to see through the eyes
It is better to be open minded
Everything is so far away
When you want to find death
Death...this way of death

Liquid, in your mind
Liquid, you can fly
Liquid sweet dreams
Sweet dreams...till the end
