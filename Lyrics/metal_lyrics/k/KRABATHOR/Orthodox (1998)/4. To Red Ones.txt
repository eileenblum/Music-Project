Sub-standard, sub nation
Under red flag, get out of my way!
I spit on you, I disdain you
You are all insane

Give us power and trust to all our rules
Give us power!!!
that's your "garden", don't mind gallows and skulls
Give us power!!!
Behind that wall is a world you'll never see!!!
Give us power!!!
Crawl for me and don't ask for a key
Give us Power!!!

BASTARDS!
I see you in my dreams
To hang on trees
Hanged on trees
Hanged on trees

Communist, community of red Hitlers
Get out of my way!!!
Your chance is lost, you are less than dust
You're living corpses

That's my revenge, don't ask for human rights
We don't need you!
You wished us hell, that's what I wish you twice
We don't need you!!
You are the family of snakes
We don't need you!!!
With red cards and silly arguments
We don't need you!!!!!

BASTARDS!
I see you in my dreams
To hang on trees
Hanged on trees
Hanged on trees
