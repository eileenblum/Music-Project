I've covered soul and mind
I've covered heart and blood
I've hidden the evil one
To see the lie laugh

Body as a cover
You've run-you didn't run
Body as a cover
You've hidden the truth

I stroked velvet palm
To feel the slime of snake
I felt the wind all around
To hear false song

I've seen hate to smile
I've been blind
I've felt break of my heart
I've been...crying

I opened out blind eyes
To wash the truth and feeling
Now there's time for our calm
You can't believe to cover

Body as a cover
You've run-you didn't run
Body as a cover
You've hidden the truth
Body as a cover
You can't believe that
Body as a cover
You have to forget that
