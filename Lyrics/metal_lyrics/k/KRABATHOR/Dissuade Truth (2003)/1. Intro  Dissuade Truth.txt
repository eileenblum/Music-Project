[Intro]

Everything that stays in our bodies is power and it has to go out.
Life is going too fast and you are dying.
Slowly but it's day after day.
Breath after breath, blood after blood.
We all have some bad things and it's fight after fight.
You can have weapons, you can have hands.
You can have mind but you have to stay here.
Defend your things, defend your ideas and defend your name.

[Dissuade Truth]

Your own tricks make me to sick
You think it's right you keep it in mind
Aren't you ill from things you do
I'm just quiet but there must be an end

Dissuade truth, too blind pride
Dissuade pride, to blind truth

You're helping for profit not because you like it
You think it's different but you are wrong
You have had money but we are still thieves
But you forgot something it wasn't just you

Dissuade truth....

Misunderstanding it's what you can't tell
Better to split-up be blind for one side
You mean it's changing but all is the same
You just want to see everything has an end

Dead Hate Screaming
On the grave bottom
Someone has to start first
Then after the centuries
There is coffin on coffin

You are waiting
Who will be on the top
This thing is natural
You're never know who will be there
You're never know who will be last

Under the ground there is peaceful calm
Under the ground there is unknown cold
Under the ground silence dead bodies
Under the ground just whispering from pride
