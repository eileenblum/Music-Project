Sacrifice your own life for the cause
Just decide if you've won or you've lost
In these times there's a price to be paid
Should you choose to accept my own way

Given time I'll inflict so much pain
Victory will be mine once again
Broken rules have enforced my exploits
When you die silence will cover noise

I Have tasted all their sorrow
When I strike whit all my power
They'll be victims by tomorrow
