What you like to say, Somebody will understand you

No body will care, It's all up to you
No body will care, It's your own thing

Give me piece of breath, I need coming up
Give me piece of lust, I need a little bit of luck

What you like to have, Someone can give it to you

If somebody will care, It's all up to you
If somebody will care, It's your own thing
Do what you have to do, You need so much power

Give me...
