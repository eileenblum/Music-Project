You can feel free, who is guilty
With all your words, who is guilty
No body to stop you, who is guilty
Tell us what you like

We can see through your soul
We can see into your heart
We can be nice we can beat you up
We can have your head we can give you respect

Watching your life, watching your lie
Watching your dreams, watching your things
Watching your fear, watching your smille
Watching your day, watching your night

Don't be too loud, who is guilty
Don't be too soft, who is guilty
Keep all things normal, who is guilty
The rest is too flagrancy

We can see through your soul
We can see into your heart
We can be nice we can beat you up
We can have your head
We can give you respect

Keep walking just on street
Running is unnormal
Who is the guilty one
They can catch you now
