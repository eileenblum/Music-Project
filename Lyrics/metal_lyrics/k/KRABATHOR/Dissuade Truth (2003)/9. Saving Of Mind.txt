You know what is pain
When you can't help yourself
YouÂ´re still looking for something
You can't find what you need

Saving your life, For things you do
Saving your mind, For life you live

There is a lot of worse things
You can hurt somebody bad
You have to keep it in mind
The things can break you down

Saving your life...

Use your own brain
Don't care about pain
Use your own hands
Touch it if you can

Fight is still to hard
When you try to help yourself
You know you'll find it
But still you'll know what is pain

Saving your life...
