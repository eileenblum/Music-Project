Under the ground there is peaceful calm
Under the ground there is unknown cold
Under the ground silence dead bodies
Under the ground just whispering from pride

The Pieces of bodies
They can't feel nothing
There isn't sun
There isn't rain

You are waiting
Who will be on top
This thing is natural
You're never known who will be there
You're never known who will be last

You can't scream there
Thousand and thousands of coffins
You can't help them
Bodies on bodies
