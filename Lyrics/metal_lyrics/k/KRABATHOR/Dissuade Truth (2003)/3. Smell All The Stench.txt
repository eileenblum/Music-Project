You're jumping into a coma
Endless around you
You can be dreaming about things
At the end is light

Kill me, rip me, whip me, strike me

Choose one way all of them are good
Choose from all ways you can't miss it
Do what you like do what you don't
Hide what you hate find what you like

Now you have the second chance
To change something
Now you can do this better
But all is gone

Kill me, rip me, whip me, strike me
Take all this pain; Smell all the stench
