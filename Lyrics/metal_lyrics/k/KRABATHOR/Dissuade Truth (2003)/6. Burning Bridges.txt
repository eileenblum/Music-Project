Hidden in the forest, Sleeping on the ground
Far away from people, Which one you put down

Don't believe and die, Try and go again through
Go again to hell, If someone you can believe

You have to break down, This needless border
You have to forget fear
To show what you have inside
Straight against the wall, It seems like it is right
Put your hands inside the hole
Open the door open your eyes

Don't believe...

The first big step, To your new world
You can't burn all bridges, From your life behind
Straight against the wall, It seems like it is right
Put your hands inside the hole
Open the door open your eyes
