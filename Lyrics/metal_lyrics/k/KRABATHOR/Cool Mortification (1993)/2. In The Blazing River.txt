[lyrics: Kopec]

A LONG WAY FROM THE SUN
HE WAKED UP
AND HIS MIND, EYES AND STEPS
ARE RAMBLING

THEY'RE GETTING ON TO KNOCK DOWN
A TRAMP ON HIS KNEEL WELL
TO MAKE HIM
BE FULL OF GRATITUDE
HE COMPLAINS TOWARDS THE SKY
WITH THE DASHED MOUTH
AND HIS BLOOD IS CHANGING
INTO THE BLAZING RIVER

[Chorus:]
INTO THE BLAZING RIVER
THE FIRE OF SUFFERING
INTO THE BLAZING RIVER

[Lead: Martin]

AT THAT REAL MOMENT
HE OVERTOOK THEIR LIVES
TURNED INTO THE DUST
THAY SLEEP ON THE RIVER'S BOTTOM
WHAT WERE THAY LOOKING
AT THE END OF THE EVIL'S WAY FOR
THEY FOUND THE DEATH
IN THE WATER OR IN THE FIRE

[Chorus:]
INTO THE BLAZING RIVER
THE FIRE OF SUFFERING
INTO THE BLAZING RIVER
