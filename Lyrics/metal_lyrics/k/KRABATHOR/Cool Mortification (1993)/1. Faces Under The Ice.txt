[lyrics: Kopec]

SILENCE IN THE SPACE
DYING OUT OF TIME
BEATING OF TWO HEARTS
IN A CRYSTALIC SPASM
MOAN OF THE WORLD
IS HIDDEN IN THE PALMS
CLOSED BY COOLNESS
TO DEPRESS

[Chorus:]
FACES UNDER THE ICE

CAUSE IN THE PAIN
THERE IS A RESCUE OF THE MANKIND
AND COLD DEADENING OF FEELING
IS THE SYMBOL OF THE VICTORY
BUT NOBODY CAN SEE
GLASS TEARS
IN THE FACES UNDER THE ICE

[Lead: Martin]

[Chorus:]
FACES UNDER THE ICE
