[lyrics: Kopec]

I WANT TO FALL ASLEEP
WITHOUT THE FEAR OF THE DAWN
FOR OTHERS TO COME
FOR A MOMENTS OF A HOPELESS

[Chorus:]
HAS THE DEEP SLEEP ALREADY CAME?
THE DEAD FAINT ALREADY HAS
KILLIN' YOUR FRAGILE SOUL
WILL DEVOUR THE FOLLOWIN' DAWN

ALL THE DAYS ARE OPENED BY A MIDNIGHT
AND NOT ACCOMPANIED BY A KIDNESS
SUCKIN' MY BLOOD TIRINGLY
BRAIN DREAMS AND INNOCENCE

[Chorus:]
HAS THE DEEP SLEEP ALREADY CAME?
THE DEAD FAINT ALREADY HAS
KILLIN' YOUR FRAGILE SOUL
WILL DEVOUR THE FOLLOWIN' DAWN

[Lead: Christopher]

[Lead: Martin]

MY SHADOW AT THE EDGE OF THE ROCK
IS BLINDED BY A HATRED
AND SHUT DOWN INTO A CIRCLE OF FEAR
BY A MADNESS OF A OTHERS

[Chorus:]
HAS THE DEEP SLEEP ALREADY CAME?
THE DEAD FAINT ALREADY HAS
KILLIN' YOUR FRAGILE SOUL
WILL DEVOUR THE FOLLOWIN' DAWN

[Lead: Martin]
