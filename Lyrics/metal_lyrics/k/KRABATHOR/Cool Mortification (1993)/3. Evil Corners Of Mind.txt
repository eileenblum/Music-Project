[lyrics: Kopec]

THERE'S TIME
TIME TO OBEY A DEVIL IN MY BODY
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE EVIL
ITS IMAGE IS FILLING
ALL THE SENSES WITH WELFARE
THAT'S NOT RIGHT, I KNOW
BUT I CANNOT TO HOLD IT BACK
TIME OF MY INTEGRITY HAS GONE
I'LL BECOME
THE EXECUTOR OF THE EVIL AFFAIR

YOUR PARENTS HATE YOU NOW
YOU'RE RASCAL IN THEIR EYES
AND YOU'RE STILL TELLING LIES, LIES, LIES
YOUR GUILT REMAINS
YOU'LL NEVER BE SAVED
NOT IN YOUR GRAVE, IN YOUR GRAVE, IN YOUR GRAVE

NO DEATH DOESN'T SEEM TO ME
TO BE DEAD ENOUGH
NO GAME ISN'T FALSE
FOR ME ENOUGH

[Chorus:]
NO DEATH, NO GAME, NO DEATH, NO GAME

[Lead: Martin]

YOUR PARENTS HATE YOU NOW
YOU'RE RASCAL IN THEIR EYES
AND YOU'RE STILL TELLING LIES, LIES, LIES
YOUR GUILT REMAINS
YOU'LL NEVER BE SAVED
NOT IN YOUR GRAVE, IN YOUR GRAVE, IN YOUR GRAVE

AND THERE'S NOTHING
NOTHING THAT COULD SET ME FREE
AND NOBODY
THERE'S NOBODY TO CRY FOR ME
I CONTROL STRANGE FATS
IN A WRONG DIRECTION
I CONTROL STRANGE LIVES
TOWARDS TO DEATH, TOWARDS TO DEATH!
