[lyrics: Kopec]

WE'RE RESTIN' ON THE UNIVERSE SPLINTERS
OUR VOICES EXPIRIN' IN THE INFINITE
OUR SWORDS PRICKIN' INTO THE EMPTINESS
OUR EYES SEEING NEITHER LIGHT NOR DARKNESS

SPACES OF PASSIN' EXISTENCE
MUCH VANITY WITHOUT THE END
AND AS FAR AS IN THE BORDER OF SURVIVE
WE STRUGGLE FOR A KNOWLEDGE OF ETERNITY

[Chorus:]
ABSENCE OF LIFE

TEMPORARY BEING OF INSIGNIFICANCY
WE DON'T MANAGE TO WATCH
THE SLIPPING PAST OF THE TIME
ELAPSING SECONDS STANDS FOR CENTURIES
AND WE EXPIRE IN AN IGNORANCE

[Chorus:]
ABSENCE OF LIFE
IN THE PASSING
IN THE UNCERTAINTY
IN THE INSIGNIFICANCY

ONLY A SLIGHT FRAGMENT OF TIME
IS DEFINED FOR LIFE
SO SLIGHT IN THE WORLD'S HISTORY
THAT WE CAN PAINT AT OURSELVES
AS THE LOST EXISTENCES
IT DEPENDS ON US
WHETHER WE WILL REMAIN SO ALSO AFTER OUR DEATH!

[Lead: Martin]

[Chorus:]
ABSENCE OF LIFE
