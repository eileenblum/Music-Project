[lyrics: Christopher]

THEY BLOCKED UP MY MOUTH
NO MORE LIFE
SOMEBODY MOST WANTS ME NOT TO SPEAK
NO MORE LIFE
I'M STANDING ON A VERGE OF MY ACTION DEED
NO MORE LIFE
IT'S TIME TO HANG UP MYSELF
NO MORE LIFE
DRIVEN FORWARD AND LAIN HEAVY ON DEPRESSIONS
I'VE COME AS FOR AS THE ROPE
I'LL STILL THINK OVER ALL
BEFORE I GET NECESSARY COURAGE

[Chorus:]
WITH THE LOOP ROUND MY NECK
IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF ALL
WITH THE LOOP ROUND MY NECK
IT'S TIME TO KILL MYSELF

UNKNOWN DRIVE
IN MY BRAIN
NO MORE LIFE
AND NO MORE PAIN

THE LOOP IS HOLDING TIGHTS MY NECK
NO MORE LIFE
BREAKING MY BACKBONE VIOLENTLY
NO MORE LIFE
IT'S SIMPLE, NOT EVEN DROP OF BLOOD
NO MORE LIFE
INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION, TOO LATE!
NO MORE LIFE
MEANINGLESS END
OTHERS ARE MY MURDERERS
I WAS CHEATED
I'M GUILTY! ARE THEY NOT?

[Chorus:]
UNKNOWN DRIVE...
