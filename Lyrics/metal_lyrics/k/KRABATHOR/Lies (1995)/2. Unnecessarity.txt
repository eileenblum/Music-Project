[lyrics: Christopher]

SHAPES AND FORMS OF THE HUMAN BODY
ONLY THOUGHT IS ABLE TO KILL
WE ARE TOO ORDINARY
TO GIVE OURSELVES AIR OVER SOMETHING

[REPEAT]

EVERYTHING AROUND SEEMS TO BE
STRANGE TO YOU
NOTHING IS HOW YOU WANT IT TO BE
THERE ARE TOO MANY REALITIES IN LIFE
AND YOU HAVE PROBLEMS RESISTING THEM

YOU CAN'T GET TO KNOW
ANYTHING IN YOURSELF
ONLY OTHERS SEE WHAT YOU DO WRONG
YOU TRY TO SUPPRESS YOUR INNER EVIL
YOU MUST BE READY FOR IT

[REPEAT]

[CHORUS:]
UNNECESSARITY OF YOUR LIFE
SUCKS YOUR POWER
YOU JUST MUST DIE
YOU JUST MUST DIE
YOU JUST MUST DIE
DIE FROM DESPERATION
DIE FOR SORROW
FALLING DOWN THE WORLD IN YOUR HEAD
THERE'S NO WAY OUT
BIRTH, POWER, LIFE
BIRTH, PAIN AND BLOOD

[REPEAT]
EVERYTHING AROUND SEEMS ...

[REPEAT CHORUS]
