[lyrics: Christopher]

LOOKING AT THEIR BODIES
YOU'RE DIVERTING YOUR EYES
YOU LOATHE THEIR TOUCH
EXPRESSIONS IN THE FACES
TALK ABOUT INNER PAIN
CAN THEIR HEARTS SCREAM FOR HELP?

DISGUSTING HUMAN BOXES
SOMEONE'S HAND GIVEN THEM TO RETIREMENT
IT'S EASY TO GET RID OF SOMETHING
THAT YOU DON'T WANT
BUT THEY AWAIT YOUR HELP
DISGUSTING HUMAN BOXES
SOMEONE'S HAND GIVEN THEM TO RETIREMENT

GODS AND THE GAMES OF NATURE DIDN'T STOP
HORRORS OF LIFE WILL CONTINUE STILL REPEATING
YOU'LL NEVER FORGET WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN
STILL YOU'LL HEAR THE CRYING OF THOSE
WHO SUFFER!

[CHORUS:]
PAIN THAT DOESN'T HURT
BLEEDING HEARTS
PAIN THAT DOESN'T HURT
VEINS FILLED WITH TEARS

[REPEAT]
DISGUSTING HUMAN ...
