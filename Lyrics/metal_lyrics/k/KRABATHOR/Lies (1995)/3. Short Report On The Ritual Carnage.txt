[lyrics: Bruno]

WELCOME TO SLAUGHTERHOUSE !!!

TERRITORY, REALM SO GORY, ART OF MURDER
STRESS OF SMALL PLACE, NO ACT OF GRACE,
BORN TO SUFFER

[CHORUS:]
YOU GO YOUR BLOODY WAY, SATISFIED ANYWAY
YOU LOVE THIS SPECIAL GAME
WHEN YOU HOLD A SHINY KNIFE
NATURALLY LONG ENOUGH, THERE'S TIME TO OPEN
RITUAL CARNAGE, RITUAL CARNAGE
RITUAL CARNAGE, RITUAL CARNAGE
RITUAL CARNAGE, RITUAL CARNAGE
RITUAL CARNAGE, RITUAL CARNAGE

A WHITE COAT MENS THE PAIN AND DEATH
AND DESPERATE EYES
EXECUTION - SWEET ECSTASY - NO ONE SURVIVES

STEP ON THE LAST STAGE, MURDER IS MY JOB
TAKE IN YOUR LAST SECONDS TO DIE
I AM MASTER AND WHO HAS EVER BEEN MORE?
DREAM ON AFTER - CONSUME A RESURRECTION

PAINFUL EDEN COMES AFTER A FEW STRIKES
SUFFER FOR ME NOW, FEAR ME, HATE ME, CRY!

WHO GAVE YOU THE RIGHT
TO RULE OTHER LIVES YOU PRIMITIVE!
I WISH FOR YOU TO FOLLOW
THE FATE OF YOU VICTIMS

[REPEAT CHORUS]

... AND THERE IS THE QUESTION:
"WHO'S THE ANIMAL ?"
