[lyrics: Bruno]

FEELING IMPORTANT WITH YOUR LIES
LIVING YOUR HALF LIFE
BLIND FAITH IN YOURSELF
BLIND PRIDE
SO WHY ARE WE SCARED?
WE LIE TO OURSELVES!
ALWAYS WE ARE READY
FOR SUFFERING, PAIN AND STRESS

DON'T YOU NEED TO VOMIT ?!

[CHORUS:]
STOP THESE BLEEDING
FUCKED UP TIMES
AND SAY THE TRUTH
ABOUT ALL LIES
ARTFUL ASSHOLES
IN FALSE POSE
PROCREATED
BY A MENDACIOUS WORLD

[REPEAT CHORUS]

YOUR PERSONAL KORESH
SLEEPS INSIDE OF YOU
MENTAL MUTILATION
SICKER THEN EVER
NEVERENDING INNER CRIME ...
PATRONIZING KIDDING
SEEMS LIKE AN EMESIS
YOUR WORDS STINK ...

DON'T YOU NEED TO VOMIT ?!
