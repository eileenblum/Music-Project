[lyrics: Christopher]

YOUR LEAVE YOUR HANDS ALONG YOUR BODY
YOU WANNA TAKE YOUR PAIN OUT OF YOUR HANDS
TO ARRANGE EVERYTHING BY ONLY MOTION
... NOTHING SO FAST

[CHORUS:]
YOU WANT WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE
YOU SCREAM WITHOUT RESPONSE
YOU CRY WITHOUT TEARS
YOU FEAR WITHOUT FEAR
TEARS, HOPE AND HATE

TO TAKE A BREATH AGAIN
TO GIVE A CHANGE TO NOTHING AND NOBODY
YOU MUST HURT? DO YOU WANT IT?
I THINK IT'S A LAW OF LIFE

[REPEAT CHORUS]

WHAT I'LL DO WILL BE RIGHT
I'LL BELIEVE THE VOICES OF MY HEART
NO OTHER WAY... DON'T BE SCARED
ALL WILL END FOR YOUR PLEASURE

TIME IS TOO FAST
IT MAKES CORPSES OF US BY GROWING OLD
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IN TIME
NO! I MUST WAIT - I'M EVEN SCARED!

[REPEAT CHORUS]

...AND PLEASURE!!!
