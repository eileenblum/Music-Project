[lyrics: Bruno]

JESUS - YOU SON OF HELL, LOOK AT MY EVIL FACE
HEAR MY CALLING, TOUCH MY RAGE
GRACELESSS LIAR, FEEL MY HATE!

ANYWAY THERE'S THE TIME TO
THROW AWAY THE "BOOK OF LIES"
TO SUFFOCATE SEED OF CHURCH
FORGET THE PARADISE

[CHORUS:]
THE CHURCH IS A LOADED GUN, WAR HAS BEGUN
REBIRTH OF BLASPHEMY
YOU STILL TRY TO BLESS BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS
REBIRTH OF BLASPHEMY
LISTEN TO MY SPEECH YOU SON OF A BITCH
REBIRTH OF BLASPHEMY
IN MY EYES THE VATICAN BURNS
REBIRTH OF BLASPHEMY

DELIVERANCE DOESN'T COME
THERE ARE ONLY DECEIVED ONES

BLESS THE CROSS - BLESS THE POPE
BLESS YOUR TRICKS - BLESS MY DICK!

GOD - YOU MENDACIOUS GOD
WHO WITH ANGELS MAKES LOVE
BY YOUR OWN BLOOD YOU ARE ALWAYS DRUNK
THE FAIRY TALE DOESN'T ANYMORE

AT THE BIBLE THE CHILDREN LAUGH
THEY LAUGH; YOU WERE CRUCIFIED
I'LL NEVER KISS YOUR HAND BUT YOU CAN KISS MY ASS

[REPEAT CHORUS]

KISS THE CROSS - KISS THE POPE
BLESS YOUR TRICKS - KISS MY DICK!

GOD - YOU MENDACIOUS GOD
I AM NOT BLIND, I'M REALLY NOT BLIND
FALL ON YOUR KNEES AND TRY TO PRAY
IF IT HELPS BECAUSE NOW YOU DIE

LORD - I AM YOUR JACK THE RIPPER!
