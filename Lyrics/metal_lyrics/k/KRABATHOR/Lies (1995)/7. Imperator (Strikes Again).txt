[lyrics: Bruno]

THOUSANDS OF CRUEL WARRIORS
THEY BRING ONLY DEATH
LEADING IMPERATOR
YOU'RE LOSING BREATH
HIS BRAIN COVERED BY WRATH
AND HEART FULL OF HATE
SELFISH HUNGER FOR THE THRONE
IN HIS EYES YOU CAN READ

DRESSED IN A WAR-SUITE
HE DRANK THE BLOOD OF BRAVE MEN
HE WAS SURE
THAT THEIR POWER WILL COME
INTO HIS VEINS
HE LOVED COURAGE OVER ALL
AND MOST OF ALL HIS WEAPON
SWORD THAT SO MANY TIMES
WAS KILLING HIS ENEMIES

IMPERATOR
IMPERATOR
IMPERATOR
IMPERATOR

ONCE SOMEBODY PUT
POISON IN HIS CUP
HE WILL NEVER AGAIN
DRINK THE VICTORY
THERE'S NOT ANY CRYING
AROUND HIS GRAVE
ONLY THE BURNING CROSS
WILL BE BURNING ON ...

IMPERATOR
IMPERATOR
IMPERATOR
IMPERATOR
IMPERATOR
IMPERATOR
IMPERATOR
IMPERATOR
