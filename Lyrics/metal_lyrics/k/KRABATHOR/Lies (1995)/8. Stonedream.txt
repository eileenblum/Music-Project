[lyrics: Bruno]

OUTSIDE THE NIGHT
YOU LIE BEHIND
A GLASSY COLD EYE
INNER WAR STREAMS INTO YOUR DREAMS
WAR OF SENSES
STILL PURSUED, STILL DESPERATE
NO CHANCE TO ESCAPE
WHERE IS THE DAWN, FORGOTTEN SUN
NOBODY CARES

[CHORUS:]
YOU WANT TO FLY OUT OF YOUR MIND
TO SET FREE YOUR OTHER LIFE
STONEDREAM REMINDS YOU
OF PRESENCE OF THE PAST

STILL WITH YOU LIKE AN UNWELCOME CHILD

AWAITING THE HARD NIGHT
YOU GO ON THE BED
YOUR NIGHTMARE IS SO REAL
SO CLOSE TO YOUR LIFE

[CHORUS:]
YOU WANT TO FLY OUT OF YOUR MIND
TO SET FREE YOUR OTHER LIFE
STONEDREAM IS HERE TO BRING THE PAIN
WHY DO THE DREAMS SO HURT?

[REPEAT CHORUS]
