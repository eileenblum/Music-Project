The way you like to go has changed
You don't like to choose a different way
May be dirty, may be clean how it's suppose to be
I guess it isn't bad it's the new fate

Dust to dust, Blood to blood
Love to hate, Fate to fate

You have had a lot of different ideas
Be different, go differently through this life
Everything has changed in one minute
I guess it isn't bad it's the new fate

The dusty days your living are dusty going
Your dust you can't find anywhere
Dust is up you, dust is on you, dust is inside you
I guess it isn't bad it's the new fate
