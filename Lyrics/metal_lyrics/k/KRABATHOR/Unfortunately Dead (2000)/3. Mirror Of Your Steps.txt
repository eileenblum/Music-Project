I step on the mirror on broken pieces
Here I can't lie to a thousand faces
I control my pain my legs are bleeding
Here I can't cry I hide my feeling

I will tell you what here is wrong
I will tell you what needs control
I will show you what is the lie
I will show you how you can cry

I step on the mirror nothing here hurts
I wait for the end but it starts again
I don't need now, I don't need lies
I don't need too known how I have to cry

Control your life!
Control your lie!
Control your step!
Control your death!

Watch your steps you don't need to find
Watch your steps you don't need to fall
You have to know, you'll never be sure
Don't make the mistakes
You have to be pure

I step on the mirror on broken pieces
Here I can't lie to a thousand faces
I control my pain my legs are bleeding
Here I can't cry I hide my feeling
