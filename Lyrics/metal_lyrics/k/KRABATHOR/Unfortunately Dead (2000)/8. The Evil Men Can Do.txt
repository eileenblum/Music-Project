The truth is just a lie
Some times the lies are true
The answer is question
The blinders are a view

The evil men can do
When given their free reign
And when the family feuds
The victims are the same

The nightmares just a dream
And Deaths a part of life
Is nothing as it seems
Will darkness turn to light
