Sometimes you like to be unknown
To be just no-one walking on the street
Nothing to feel, nothing to see, nothing to smell, nothing to tell

Are you living, are you screaming, are you running, are you coming
Are you bleeding, are you dying, are you killing... to be unknown

Without face, without arms, without legs, without mind
Without head, without hands, without eyes, without brain

Sometimes you don't like talking
To be wound around all things
Nothing to feel, nothing to see, nothing to smell, nothing to tell

Are you changing, are you sleeping, are you going, are you walking
Are you thinking, are you losing, are you looking... to be unknown
