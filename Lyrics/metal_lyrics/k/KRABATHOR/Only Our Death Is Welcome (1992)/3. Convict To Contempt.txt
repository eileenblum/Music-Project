I'm in deep agony now
I remember to all my life,
Don't hear sincere crying over me
My last appeals are boring

My last headstrong wish
Bury in coffin, no cremate
I'm dry pale body
Only my death is welcome

Cample me for this state
I can't defend oneself
My eyes before hand close
Nobody don't say nothing

Convict to contempt
Convict to contempt

My life is end off
All are glad of my death
Put intotin box my ash
My name is oblivion

Convict to contempt
Convict to contempt
