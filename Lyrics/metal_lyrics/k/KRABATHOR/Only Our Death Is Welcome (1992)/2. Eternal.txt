Sky is full of terror
Full of life and death
How much pain stand I?
Cruelty crush my heart

Horizon is in a cramp
In the psychic ruin
I'm torment, but don't kneel
I'm in the nest of worms

Eternal

Remember for all
For all dirty whiles
Remember for all
And then I will strong

My soul is a put up
Put up with the madness
My pleasure is scarr
I'm control by own brain

Eternal
