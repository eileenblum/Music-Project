I'm irritate appearance
In the eyes is death and revenge
In my face is grisly anger
Task is O.K. - killing the brain!

Don't control my wrath
In the veins is poison
Killing for my virtue
Slowly let out poisonous blood

Psychodelic

Every have own mistakes
I've defect in brain
Now we are in a row living
I'll kill, piece by piece

I'm loyal for death
I see only hopeless
People are the fuckers
Therefore kill, kill, kill!

Psychodelic

I kill the innocents,
But among they are the offenders
Death even so is just
I kill the others, don't will better
