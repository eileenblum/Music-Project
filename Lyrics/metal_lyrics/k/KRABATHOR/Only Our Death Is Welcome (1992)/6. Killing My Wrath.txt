I leave from town
Where is the black heaven
Forever here
Remain darkness
With the strain of look for
My oneself again
And my body
Killing my wrath

Killing my wrath
Killing my wrath

Wounds hurt again, who time don't heal
I look for better, what remain on us
Who betray own self, betray again
And my body killing my wrath

I hide the tracks
Is the time go away
From the dark grave
I dig the conscience
Then to my torment
I remember again
And my body
Killing my wrath

Killing my wrath
Killing my wrath
