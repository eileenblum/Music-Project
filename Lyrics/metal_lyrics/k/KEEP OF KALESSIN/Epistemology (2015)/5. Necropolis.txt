Adrift - Nomadic men
Towards the land of no return
To seek the knowledge of the gods

A distant journey
Through the sun-baked deserts
Where sandstone monuments are towering

Above the dunes the solar storms erupt
Into the esoteric realms of day and night

Across red land
Through scalding sand
Yearning in the hearts of men

Above the tombs
The city of the dead
Necropolis

Into the valley of their kin
They seek elysium for all 
Death is a mere phase of life

Depicted on the walls
Funerary scripts depraved by time
The epitaph of fallen kings

"Go tell the gods
A fallen hero here within
Ascended to another life"

"Upon this throne
Of stone and bone
This kingdom I will reign alone"

Above the tombs
The city of the dead
Necropolis
