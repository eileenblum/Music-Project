At the shore where all lands end
Among skeletal remains of fallen warriors
Gleaming dark magick resides
A gateway to where the holy's denied

The sea is ravishing, ferocious and cold
A living testemonial oath
Waves of vacuum swallow the souls
Only the chosen ones shall be released

Across the seemingly endless sea
Towards the north where the ice lies thick
Our shadows remain and darkness regain
True powers and magick I shall retain

Within our minds we see
The dark divinity
Wake up and stand with us
Tonight we burn the cross!

Behold the celestial sphere
The dome of fallen angels
Universe made manifest
The struggle for communion

Towards undying lands
Divulging the final moment
The star supremacy
Indulge in dark divinity

As the night falls and the stars shine brighter
The silence is howling at it's maker
Whispering winds and shadows painting sins

Your god have deemed you unworthy
And the hour of reckoning is at hand
Your blood will paint the way to the future
As his name will be remembered for the ages

Arise from the netherworld
Wisdom and fire in equal measure
A matter of soul not of flesh
Voices will linger in these walls eternally

We will fall in divinity
Your reign has become undone

Inside the castle of bone and stone
Ceremonial chants fill mighty halls
A thousand warriors resound
The abyss cursing the dead enthralled

Within our minds we see
The dark divinity
Wake up and stand with us
Tonight we burn the cross!

Behold the celestial sphere
The dome of fallen angels
Universe made manifest
The struggle for communion

Towards undying lands
Divulging the final moment
The star supremacy
Indulge in dark divinity
