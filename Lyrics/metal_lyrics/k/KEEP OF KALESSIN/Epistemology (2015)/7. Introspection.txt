I cannot unsee this misery - Tearing in me
Losing contact with reality
Paranoid and persecutory delusions
Claim the essence of mentality

I will not submit to fear
I've come too far - I'm in too deep
Venturing the unknown
The victors fate is mine alone

See beyond the boundaries
Break your confinement
Open up your dogmatic mind
Man overboard - A lifetime reward
A life lived in hate would just seal your own fate

Unchain the mental elements
Cast out the vile contaminants
Thrown into the oceans of your fears

I see myself falling - I fly on broken wings
Salvation calling - Elusive spirit free
I feel that I'm lost - Embrace reality
I ask what I must - Is this my destiny?
