The sense of life
Expected to be nothing else
Oppotunity for self release
Is clinging to mortal disease

Nothing can pass
Once crossing it's path
Kingdom come on a cosmic scale
A force so strong
Not even light escapes

Our world is a principle of contagion
The universal notion of cause and effect
All is entangled in vast systematic unity
Even the most horrific congenital defect

Leaving - Chasing end from afar
Dying - The death of a star
Evolving - Into mass from time beyond time

Leaving - The fear of mortality
Dying - The fate of reality
Ending - Intertwined into a grand design

From pitch black emptiness
Boundaries destined to seize
Unleashed - Nowhere to be appeased

Macro time - Micro space
Cosmic revelation for a mortal race
From the shadows beginning - A natural end

Leaving - Chasing end from afar
Dying - The death of a star
Evolving - Into mass from time beyond time

Leaving - The fear of mortality
Dying - The fate of reality
Ending - Intertwined into a grand design

The sense of death
Expected to be nothing else
Intertwined heart - The fear of mortality

This war of life
Intertwined into a grand design
Open your eyes to the fate of reality

Seed sprung into existence
Binary basis profound
Eluded comprehension
Paramount wisdom decay

Horizons of tomorrow
Nightsky reflecting the past
A cosmic revelation
Veiling the ultimate truth
