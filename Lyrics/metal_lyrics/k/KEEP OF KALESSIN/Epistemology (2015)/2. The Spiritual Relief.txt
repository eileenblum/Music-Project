Here, between the moments
We see so clear the omens
Of what's to come
What we should have done and undone

I cast away my throne
I rise and claim this fate as my own
My destiny's not written in stone
I cast away my crown
In my rejuvenation I will drown
Am I the godless son to face the unknown

In solitude I embrace the eerie silence
And the deep mystery of inner thoughts
Serving as a reason for being anti-human

In depths of wisdom never distraught
You wake up from the bliss of your ignorance
And the balance of karma haunts you down
In your own rejuvenation you will drown

Essence of the mind
Existence of our kind
Humanity's beliefs
The spiritual relief

Material substances is all that we are
This is the true science of existence
Spiritual beliefs are only an essence
Caused by fanatic religious persistance

The mind is the great power of humans
Continously evolving past the unknown
Into future understanding of relativity
Preceeding the limits history has grown

Essence of the mind
Existence of our kind
Humanity's beliefs
The spiritual relief

These godwritten pages
A tale of the ages
When time gave us the deadly kiss
The moment we would fall and move beyond

The cycle surely ends again
To death we all succumb
From earth all life arose
To earth we all shall become again

Essence of the mind
Existence of our kind
Humanity's beliefs
The spiritual relief
