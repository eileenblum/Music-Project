My fury is the earth the shivers
Carved through stone by the rivers
The fire that burn in me never stops

Evolve and reveal the ultimate truth to the rising sign
I act with vigor transforming the future probing into the abyss

The heart of the cosmos will create my lament
Fire, burn me cleanse my soul in your embrace

"We challenge you to unravel our mystery"
