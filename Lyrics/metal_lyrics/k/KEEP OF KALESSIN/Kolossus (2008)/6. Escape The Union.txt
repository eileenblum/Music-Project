War consumes us, makes us who we are
We march the path of the ancient star
She will guide us, throughout these toilsome times
From her stellar light we shine

The might and my intentions are pure
It's just the betrails that feed my hate
The path is fare, but the result is obscure
But in the end...

Escape the union, ignite your inner flame
Invoke the power of your own name
We feel no pain but the sting of scorn
We must die to be reborn

My blackhearted fate
Is ready for me to take

I was born as a son of darkness
A bastard of my kingdom, my world, my gods
They betrayed me, had me for a fool
No longer shall I bow to you
I am free!
