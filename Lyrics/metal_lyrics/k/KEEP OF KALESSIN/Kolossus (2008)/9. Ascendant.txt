My name is equal to that of destruction
My kingdom is built on (the ruins of) holy demise
The gods are brought down by the hand of a mortal
My name will spawn legends. I ascend to the skies

Through time and space we travel dimensions for eternity
We walk the path of the ancients and leave mortality

Through time and space we travel dimensions for eternity
We walk the path of the ancients and leave mortality

Through time and space we travel dimensions for eternity
We walk the path of the ancients and leave mortality

Cosmic ascendant, rise to the stars and give us the powers we crave
I carry the ring of ancient might the symbol of the beast and your blood
I reap the world on reptilian wings and never look back
Forever shall I be remembered as the ruler of the gods

Through time and space we travel dimensions for eternity
We walk the path of the ancients and leave mortality

Through time and space we travel dimensions for eternity
We walk the path of the ancients and leave mortality
