I bear the curse, that haunts the minds of men
The hunger for power, the great respect
I will lead, lead you against the gods
I will make you see, your destiny

Come to me, come minions sworn to obey
As you give you shall receive
Bow your heads and praise the fire
As you burn for me

Gods hear me, hear my thunder rise
I will destroy your reign of lies
Gods betrayed me, betrayed me before my eyes
I call the source of your demise

Commence the search for existence
Stand true to what your denied
Come, feel, seek and realize
The true power of hell

How could I ever walk this far
This deep on this unbearable path
You'd never think I could endure
Not even to see the end of it
The reward was divinity,
But the price maybe too high?
Is this really worth staying alive for?

You ungrateful worm, your destiny was not to be king
Who are you to question our judgement, our will?

Gods hear me, hear my thunder rise
I will destroy your reign of lies
Gods betrayed me, betrayed me before my eyes
I call the source of your demise

Gods hear me, hear my thunder rise
I will destroy your reign of lies
Gods betrayed me, betrayed me before my eyes
I call the source of your demise
