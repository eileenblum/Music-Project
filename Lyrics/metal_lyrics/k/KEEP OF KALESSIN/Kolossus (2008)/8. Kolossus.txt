Feel the fire, the fury of my hate
To rule alone I must elevate
You can't resist me, open the gates

Your world's corrupted, tales full of lies
Oceans of souls, rivers of blood

My kingdom built with flames
I'm the life of this land

Through fire to ash, from pain I arise
A conqueror of worlds rise from the mud

"When the moon reflects the ancestral past
A coalition of captains
Gathers for a blood offering
The visionaries experience a pulsating mystery
Forced on account to the oath
The sign becomes the focalizer
As they interpret the symbols
With insight and confidence"

"Truth seekers, your death cannot help me
You're in violation of divine commandments"
Behold the ruler of the burning kingdom!

Heretics, disloyalty is treason
Vultures, you have no place here
Infidels, none of you are worthy

My kingdom built with flames
I'm the life of this land
Your darkness runs through me
As the law is my command
