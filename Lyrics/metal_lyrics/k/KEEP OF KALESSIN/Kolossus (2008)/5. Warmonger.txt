Gather your leaders, this will be the last
The end of it all for all of us
If we do not stand together
We will be a memory of the past

The sands of time tells me the end is near
Our only hope to live is brutal warfare

Come join me
Raise your swords in rage
March with me
And fight this battle engaged

The path ahead lies clear
I can sense the horror, but do not fear
You will look back on the day of the attack
Prepare for glory, prepare for war

"I give you the opportunity of two choices,
Wait for damnation
Or be the damnation yourselves
Attack and provoke attacks,
Carve out your life's calling
In the world as a matriarch
And never surrender!"

Open fire, hold the line and charge forward!
Spears and flesh collide, the ground red of blood,
From my sword, my triumph
