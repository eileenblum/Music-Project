Dark times lies ahead
Victims of future genocide
Serpents of the undead king
Forcing them to suicide

It will all be revealed
At the gates of beckoning
The day of reckoning
And the end of suffering

At peace with the being
Leaving the mortal flesh

Of a battle long lost
We now pay the bitter cost
The warriors have fallen through
Banners are burning red

Ashended into oblivion
In peace they're leaving
The kingdom in ruins
For their wicked beings
They fought and they lost
They offered ascension
They begged and they wept
As we sent them into oblivion

It has all been revealed
The day of reckoning
Serpents of the undead king
Forcing them to suicide

At peace for the being
Leaving the mortal flesh
