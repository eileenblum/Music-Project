Born King of the underworld
The heir to the land of fire
Reptilian majesty
Awaken your desire

Into the flames we march
To greet our reborn master
Into the flames we burn
To burn as slaves hereafter
Your seal is broken!

Help me to uncover our power
Save me from your old, covered lies
Grant me the power of the Dragontower
Give me the might to set us free!

He is the eldest
His name has not been spoken in the old tongue
For centuries!
Not even whispered by
The old ones for the furthest shore
It's time to break the seal
Reptilian majesty
Your silence is broken

Help me to uncover our power
Save me from your old, covered lies
Grant me the power of the Dragontower
Give me the might to set us free!
