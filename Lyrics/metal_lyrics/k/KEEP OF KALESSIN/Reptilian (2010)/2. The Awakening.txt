At the rise of dawn
Beyond the lands of man
The beast has awakened
From a deep slumber
For hundreds of years
It has laid dormant
Now again it appears

Into the fires of the mountain
From the darkest day in time
The era of the future begins
Eras of waiting his return
Now the stars are forming his true name

Made of magic
The language of the making
With ironclad rock as his skin
Through cosmos he breathes
Through the stars he sees
An era will end
Rebirth of our kin

Awaken from centuries of sleep
Returning to the keep
We feel the warmth of fire
Return reptilian kings of kings

Hail!
Dragon!
Majesty!
Grant us power!

Reaching for the stars of Agnen
A journey through the dark
Seen through the eyes of fire
We're drawn into the void

Hail!
Dragon!
Majesty!
Grant us power!

Ancestral mighty being
Of dimensions unknown
Sworn to protect the old oath
He who has crossed the dark land
Shall inherit the throne
An era will end
Revenge is at hand

Awaken from centuries of sleep
Returning to the keep
We feel the warmth of fire
Return reptilian king

Awaken from centuries of sleep
Returning to the keep
We feel the warmth of fire
Return reptilian kings of kings

Reaching for the stars of Agnen
A journey through the dark
Seen through the eyes of fire
We're drawn into the void
To live
