Under the clear night-sky
Universal power unite
In the dazzling starlight
For the union in twilight

Divine the essence of nature
Fulfilment is what we crave
We've waited through centuries
For small men to deprave
We gaze and call upon
The bringers of the storm
And now they're finally reborn

Rejoice in stellar elite
Divine union complete
We ride the cosmic storm
We don't take any form

Divine the essence of nature
Fulfilment is what we crave
We've waited through centuries
For small men to deprave
We gaze and call upon
The bringers of the storm
And now they're finally reborn

Taken steps out of our world
Risen to oppose and leave the union of man
Through creation and destruction
We've found the meaning of splendour

We have found
The way to stay divine
We march towards the stars

The balance of elements
And everlasting unity
From the dawn of time
To the end of eternity

Divine the essence of nature
Fulfilment is what we crave
We've waited through centuries
For small men to deprave
We gaze and call upon
The bringers of the storm
And now they're finally reborn
