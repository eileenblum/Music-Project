Judgement has come
The guilty will fall
Unforgiving terror
Penetrating wall
Harvest you all
For their war-machine
No one will live
Unless life is given

Let the kingdom law be heard!
Let the kingdom law be heard!!

Ugh!

Stoned to death
Burned to dust
Bled to live
Reborn to rule!

Do not feel beaten down
But rather praise the crown
Fear to the pleasant word
Let the kingdom law be heard

Dark disciples gather now
To set their icon on fire
Our hate has grown
Much to strong
We pray for war
To justify our sins

For days and nights
Swords and flames devours life
Enslavement of mankind
Is at hand!
Once again the earth will bleed
Once again the winds will seize
Never again the water will flow
Triumphant fires from below!

Let the kingdom law be heard!
Let the kingdom law be heard!!
