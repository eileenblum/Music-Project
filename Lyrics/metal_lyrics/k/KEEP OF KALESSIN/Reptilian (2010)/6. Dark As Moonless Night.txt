Rise
And speak the truth
You will bleed before you die
Broken oath
Worship the loathe
Betrayer! Betrayer of life

You wear the crest of the shamed
In blood you are blamed
You're going down, down
Down underground
Blood on your hands
In blood we are bound

A slaughter is at hand
In this godforsaken land
Swear to your masters command
Swear to blood and joy the death-clan
Dying the dream
The beast awakening
Seeing through the eyes of horror
Living the dream
The dream of death
Screaming through the mouth of terror

Wake up!
And turn the cross
Be not afraid to die as one of us
Come forth and state your title
Be a man and burn your Bible

Night shines in lack of light
Embrace the darkest night
Scarred from an endless fight
Save me from the light
Dark as moonless night

Bow down in awe
And salute the dragon's claw
Thunder from above
Fire from below

Wake up!
And turn the cross
Be not afraid to die as one of us
Come forth and state your title
Be a man and burn your Bible

Night shines in lack of light
Embrace the darkest night
Scarred from an endless fight
Save me from the light
Dark as moonless night
