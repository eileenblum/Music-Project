Here you are
Recorded in stained glass
The devil from the mountains

Born of dragons
Fearsome beasts of legends
Awaken soldier of ancient times
Guardian of all that is known
Your reign has been overthrown

Here you are
Descendant of the fallen star
Dragon iconography

The circle is broken
The bridges are burned
The land is on fire
The dead has returned
For centuries the tales has been told
Through ages your fires grew cold

Claw and fang
Your weapons at hand
The devil from the mountains
Smoke and fire
Your blades of desire
The wind is with your wings

Born from the fires of creation
He knows the true name of this world
Risen again from aeons to sleep
The red giant breathes

He has risen to learn
That the dead walks the earth
Awaiting their masters return
Guardian of all that is known
Your reign has been overthrown

Here you are
Descendant of the fallen star
Dragon iconography

Claw and fang
Your weapons at hand
The devil from the mountains
Smoke and fire
Your blades of desire
The wind is with your wings

Claw and fang
Your weapons at hand
The devil from the mountains
Smoke and fire
Your blades of desire
The flame to bring down kings

Our studies of the arcane and divine
Has unlocked the potential of our draconic heritage
We have unlocked the power to wield the flame
Our worship of the black talon
Has become our way in war
Our way in war!
