Almighty
Will to power
Prosper in darkness
Blooming
With sinister urges

Come damnation
Levitation
Antichristian
To the core

Inside
Beyond
And everlasting
The path to the throne
I walk alone

For all willing
And daring to be taken
For upheaval
No shadowed
By second thought

Inside
Beyond
And everlasting
The path to the throne
I walk alone
I walk alone

By the twisted
The wretched and unpure
The everlasting
The seed of the unholy
For all willing
And daring to be taken
For upheaval
Not shadowed
By second thought
