FABER EST QUISQUE FORTUNAE SUAE

Reclaim
What are you trying to gain?
King of the world - king of it all

Reclaim
Can you take the pain?
Your lust for control is taking its toll?

Reclaim
Is this gas to your flame?
Can you take the pain?
Can you take the pain?

Reborn
From a heart that was torn
Reborn
With a heart filled with scorn

Repossess
From the deep of distress
Now this is war - nothing less
Sign of the dragon
Blackwinged attack
This time around
There's no holding back

Repossess
From the deep of distress
Now this is war - nothing less
Fuck you!
What do you this is true?
Is this me or is this you?

Reclaim
What are you trying to gain?
King of the world - king of it all

Reclaim
Can you take the pain?
The higher you climb the deeper you fall

...is it me or is it you?

FABER EST QUISQUE FORTUNAE SUAE

LES TALIONIS
VAE VICTIS

FIAT USTITIA ET PEREAT MUNDUS

MORTUI NON MORDENT
SIC ITURE AD ASTRA

EXEGI MONUMENTUM AERE PERENNIUS
