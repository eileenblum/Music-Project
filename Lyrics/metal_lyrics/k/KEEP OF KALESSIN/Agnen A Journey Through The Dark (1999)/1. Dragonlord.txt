Now the moon roams low beneath the stars....of Agnen
Now the dragons soar on endless through the night

How can I....a man of my age
travel so distant with short journey
How can I....a man of might
in front of me open the night (and erect my being)

This is the knowledge I seek great dragon
to elude from living and cast my shadow

I...dragonlord hold my staff as one of warrior kind
I...let the books of paln and dragons guide me
...on a journey through the dark

This is the knowledge I seek great dragon
to elude from living and cast my shadow
