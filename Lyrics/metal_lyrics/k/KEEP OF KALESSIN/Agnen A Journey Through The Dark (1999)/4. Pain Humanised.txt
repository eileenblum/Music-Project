Chaotic escapes 
Distance: unrelevant 
On a nightly basis journey

Under foreign stars
I reigned as one
While bleeding you would hear me

Know me...
We become as one 
Leave me ...
You are my kind
In my life I'm not alone 
You know what lurks behind

Envision a circle
It never ends
As a scar I stand forever
What was gained is lost in time
This theme I need to travel

Yet again the pain is present
Subsequence to substantial force
I'm a bearer of pain tonight
My burden is my source
