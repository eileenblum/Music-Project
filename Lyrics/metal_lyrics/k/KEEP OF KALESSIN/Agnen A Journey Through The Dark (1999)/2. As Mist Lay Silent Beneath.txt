A lifegiving sun lies low beyond
A mighty citadel

A general greets his army of light's devoted men
"Warriors hold tight
the darkness is upon us tonight"

No courage rose up among the hearts of warriors
to fight against the fear....the death
Only darkness stands against the dark
As mist lay silent beneath

Will these great walls of stone grant us from fall
Or will the walls we stand upon bury us all
All the mist alive in this fleeing form
flickering, dodging, fading at every side

No courage rose up among the hearts of warriors
to stand against the fear....the death
Only darkness stands against the dark
As mist lay silent beneath

Now the mist thinned and moved slowly away
as a great dragon drops low over the ground
and with a roaring shrill of fright
he call upon the men of might...

...to bring more death into this night
