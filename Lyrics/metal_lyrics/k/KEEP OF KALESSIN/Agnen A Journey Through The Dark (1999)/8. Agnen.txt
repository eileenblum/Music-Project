The light has died away, for me
I fell silent to the ground, and died
As i started on a journey through the dark.
In the great land of darkness,
I was born again.......dead

Words have lost their meaning now,
spells have lost their reason, and do cause harm
Humans kill your infants now, to prevent more death
As I am on my journey through the dark

Even dragons have lost their speech
roaming wild, forever......at last

Agnen, a journey through the dark
