I have opened the door that had
been shut since the beginning of time
Alone of all men in all time
I am lord of the two lands

I have opened the doorway
between the light and the darkness,
and became stronger than death itself
You should follow the undying one...

Come, Come....

Over the mountain which has no name but pain
Beneath the black sky where stars don't shimmer

In the dryland
I am the one becoming
I am the tall lord of shadows
you have followed to your own end

Come, Come....
