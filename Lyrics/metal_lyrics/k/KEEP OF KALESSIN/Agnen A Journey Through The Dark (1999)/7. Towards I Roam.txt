On my journey towards....
I gather the darkness...
and the cold silence...
surround me
Towards I Roam
creating a hole in the world
Into the dark....forever
on towards I roam

Those enormous flashes of might
as I open the night...
And wander, into the darkland
over mountains in pain
this is where I shall reign
forever....at last

Descending into the dark
to where I go...
dragons can't follow (me)
as a dying in the realm of death
In this darkness of the earth and night
I summon even more of this enlightened might

I...who has erected my being
I...the enlightened one dying in this land
I... the immortal king of two lands
cast my shadow in the darkness
and reign at last.....forever
