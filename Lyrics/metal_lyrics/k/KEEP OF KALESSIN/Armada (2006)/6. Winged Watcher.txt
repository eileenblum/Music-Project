Recreation from desolation
Magnitude through levitation
The core is still growing stronger
The seed to plant all seeds

Reptilian
From time before time
When all oceans were one
Before the mountains grew towering
All forces one being
Dark reptilian wings

Never to back down
Never to seek shelter
Head first into the coming storm
And stand alone
Victorious

Reptilian
From time before time
Whenn all oceans were one
Before the mountains grew towering
All forces one being
Reptilian winged watcher

It's rising foretold the death of kings
Collapse of empires
A monumental battle to the death
Sickening the sight of war
