Welcome
These ruins your palace
These barren plains
The kingdom you inherit

Your shattered citadel
Raised again Gargantuan
The Wealth of Darkness

Here he is rich
The man who treasures torment
A feast for scavangers and thieves alike

These riches your crown
This torment your legacy
For many are we who greet you

Welcome
We will walk behind you
In our grasp we will bind you
Guide you like a father
Follow the Deluge

Welcome
The strength your failure
Their hope is the way to destruction

The crown is yours to take
Reign is for you to make
The final chapter in the Book of Death

Welcome
We will walk behind you
In our grasp we will bind you
Guide you like a father
Follow the Deluge
