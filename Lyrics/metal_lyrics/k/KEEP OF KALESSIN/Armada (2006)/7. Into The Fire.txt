For those of our kin
The pride that you call sin
Those who share our devotion

Minions of the coming plague
Hordes of the new reign
Complete Annihilation

The hour has come
Rise Claw Crown
One dedication

For the path ahead
All life laid dead
Thousands clad in darkness

Beast of the Sea
Beast of the Earth
Beast of the Sky
At dusk the Dragon strikes

Rifts torn through stone
Rise waters as walls
Mountains melt to brimstone streams

First a trembling wave through the ground
Then a thundering drumfire
Like all out of Brass and Timpani
In fire eyes appear

"They have been avenged
At least in part
The greater dept will be paid soon
Our people have gone mand with grief and rage
We told them - no mercy
As they showed us no mercy"

It's a holy war now
It has taken on a life of it's own
We're a world gone mad
And it's only our rage that gives us purpose any longer
That rage cannot be stopped
It can only exhaust itself in blood

Win or loose, we'll go down fighting
Take us into the Fire

The grand order and system fall asunder
The stars grow pale and dim
Chaos unleashed
Open is the mouth of Hell

Beast of the Sea
Beast of the Earth
Beast of the Sky
At dusk the Dragon strikes
