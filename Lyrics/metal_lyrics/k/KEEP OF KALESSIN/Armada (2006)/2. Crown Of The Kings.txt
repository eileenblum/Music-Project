Dragon Goetia
Red gold on cold stone
With the dead arise

Rise winged serpent
Before the unseen
Rise the serpenteye star

Through times of war
A victor is crowned
A beast of gigantic size

Summoned by words never spoken before
Called upon for this war

Arise
Armada
Undefeatable will

Given wings
Claw Crown of the Kings
Death the reptile eye brings

Pulse of the earth
The march of the Armada
Fleet of marauders
A sign of a coming tide
The sintenel signals
Armada elite adversary

Sandstorm propulsion
Wild rape of the earth
All shall perish
None shall be spared
Armada Kalessin
Surface

"Come brave human
Show us your courage
Become all you can be
Your fall shines through your bravery
You will be the measure of man's failure
A martyr for your race
Come closer, come closer, come closer
I wanna see your face"

"Ye was asked to behold the word
To answer and to yield
Now ye must answer to the sword
For the race of mankind already
Is a race of shattered shields"

"Curse not your liberator
Bring me gifts before you're dead
I am there, where mankind comes to die
I'm the one to watch your glow from within
Die as an ember to ash
Claw to carry you
Claw to crush you
Symbol of the thousand talons"

Ancient serpent
The hour has come
A victor is crowned
Triumphant through demise

Arise
Armada
Undefeatable will

Given wings
Claw crown of the Kings
Death the reptile eye brings

Summoned by words never spoken before
Called upon for this war
Given wings
Claw crown of the Kings
Death the reptile eye brings
