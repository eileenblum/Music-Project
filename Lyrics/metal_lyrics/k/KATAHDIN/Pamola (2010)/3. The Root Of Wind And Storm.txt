High on the mountain, the root of wind and storm
Lives great Pamola, moose headed bird of thunder
Those who approach, shall be dispatched from this earth
The mountain looms above the world

Towering over the river and the sea
The greatest mountain stands an alter to the spirits
Earthly life remains below the line of trees
Free of misery

Invoke the spirits to protect us
Avoid the angry wrath of storm
Even the mountain cat trembles
At the sound of Pamola
