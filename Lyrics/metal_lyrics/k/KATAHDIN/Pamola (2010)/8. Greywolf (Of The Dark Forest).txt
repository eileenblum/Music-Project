Greywolf roams the forest
Alone he searches for his pack
Through the darkness he shall wander
Through summer heat and winter famine

Lonely Greywolf must quench his hunger
He must seek shelter from the snow

Danger lurks near at dusk s approach
A sound so fierce; the cat attacks

The Battle rages into the night
Greywolf fights to save his life
One fateful blow a terrible moan
Greywolf has died

Mighty Greywolf on the forest floor
Bloodied and mangled he wanders no more
