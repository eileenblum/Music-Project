Dark clouds gather in the south, the Earth trembles with fear
Rain comes winds are strong the storm will be grave
Trees are crushed under sky mountains disappear
This epic storm takes its first life darkness descends!

Lightning flashes thunder crashes
Rivers rise and trees are flattened

Angry sky angry sounds angry spirits
Howling winds speak evil tongues bear witness
Angry sky angry sounds angry spirits
Water rises to the clouds they must escape

Drive drive drive
Into the hills
The storm washes away another life

The sky shows through the clouds
Wind has calmed, stars are out
Rain recedes into the night

Lightning flashes thunder crashes
Rivers rise and trees are flattened
The storm has returned
With more fury than before
