Before dawn broke the horizon we set out upon the sea
The salty breeze stung our senses, the sun rose red in the east

Take head the omen

The sea was calm as we left the shore behind us
The wind propelled us with great speed into the east
But soon our hopes would betray us
As clouds rolled in black and bursting at the seems

Our ship was tossed and tipped and thrashed upon the waves
The sea unleashed a fury full of hate
But we fought hard to keep the rage at bay
For we believed death was not our fate

The sea shall not consume our ship or our lives
For we are one with her and we shall not die

We are the wind we are the sea
And through the chaos we knew we would succeed
As we toiled with the ocean to survive
The sea grew calm and we watched the clouds recede.
