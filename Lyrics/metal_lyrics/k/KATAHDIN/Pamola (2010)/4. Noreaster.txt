Winter has thrust itself upon us
Skies are grey and filled with hate
The forest is a barren wasteland
Life has been driven from this place
Snow and ice shroud the earth
Night dominates day

Winter brings darkness and despair
And takes life without care
Bitter cold fills the air

Storms drop ten feet of snow
Pamola makes the wind blow cold
Winter is the darkest time we know

At the coming of the squall
Do not lament Summer s fall
Because yearning for warmer days is vanity lacking grace
Make haste get warm winter is hear to stay
