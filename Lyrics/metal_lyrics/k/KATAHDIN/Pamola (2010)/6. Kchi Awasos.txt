Every night we give chase
And hunt the great northern bear
Half the year we search in vain
For Kchi Awasos

As summer passes the hunt persists
We hunt by night and sleep by day
As the days grow short the trail is clear
We are closing on the beast
The autumn air fills our lungs
The bear is in our sights
We let loose our arrows and strike him down
His blood pours and turns the leaves brown

When spring arrives he is reborn
We ll start the hunt once more
For now we rest and feast for weeks
We'll rebuild our strength
