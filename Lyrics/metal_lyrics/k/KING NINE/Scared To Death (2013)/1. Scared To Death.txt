Scared to death.
Never let the depressions of humanity's regressions hold us down
Ever if four walls come closing in we find a way out
We extend our hand to brothers in need
Unity of the struggle is a dying breed

In this world only the strong survive
And we won't just say down and die

You can't face the truth
You've been hiding your whole life
Just because the wicked wear the crown
It doesn't make the righteous a wounded hound

The rain from black clouds won't keep us down

Were taught to be scared
And most of us hide from the pain
Find the strength don't believe the fear
Scared to death, hang your head in shame.

We won't be held down.
