Can't change the fact that this life in unfair
Clock ticks away drains your life left here
Growing up tried to do what's right
A fool's way brings the end of your life

I choose to never see the world that you see
You're the one who has his eyes closed, not me

I choose the roads that I want, walk paths you only dream of
Its my life to live and I won't waste my time

I see whats really happening and its not for me
A chain holds you down to your false identity

Push me towards my edge, I won't fall
I've made my choices, no compromise, no more

The powers that be they got a plan for me
Put me to work and never let me be free
