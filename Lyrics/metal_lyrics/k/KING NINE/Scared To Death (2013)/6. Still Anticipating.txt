What made me the man I am today
A world in its spiral down
Blind to see the truth that's in front of me
Gods nowhere to be found
Still we call for his name
No end to damnation
Death is true salvation

As we try to kill each other off
All that remains of us is dust
Who really laughs last?
Because I know it can be us

Most of us are forced into starvation
Our jobs barely help us to survive
There's no love to go around
We live, we die

Our wills are beaten and broken
Time after time you beg for a place to hide
I just can't let my hands rest
Gotta scramble and get whats mine

Take whats mine
We live, we die

As we try to kill each other off
All that remains of us is dust
Who really laughs last?
Because I know it can be us

Its so easy to wanna die
When staying alive is this hard
But ill spit in the face of this world
Because there's no hope in my heart
There's no hope
No hope left
