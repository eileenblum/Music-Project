You never picked me up
Helped me get back where I left off
The bonds you share are with yourself
And they're not for anyone else

Your minds too clouded
You were never down for the cause
I remember a time when we walked alone
And this fight was all we had

I won't let you claim whats mine
Step aside, can't hear your words
Your minds to clouded
Now yours backs turned to us

You and I don't walk the same path
Somewhere you fell off track
We can't just turn our backs and walk away
This is our lives and its all at stake

You fell off
Down for life.
