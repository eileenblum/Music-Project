You face the fear within you
Mirror image right in front of your eyes
In this place of desperation
Its time to breathe deep

Surrounded by the weak men
Who try to impress a fake image
They look strong and they play their part
Nothing but a coward in their hearts
You don't have it in you
Too weak

Spoken words of men who became useless
Out of my way, don't want to hear your excuses

Its the fear that keeps you down
Its the chains by which your bound

Breaking my back to prove I'm a man
Nothing to lean on, alone I stand

From the second were born we start to die
Your name doesn't hold any clout
Conquer whats in front of you
Make sure they know
Leave no doubt
