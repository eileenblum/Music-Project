Kid on the street walks so hard
Gun on his side in case they pull his card
He gets the courage up to finally squeeze it off
An innocent man suffers the loss

Wrote the check that you couldn't cash
Now you gotta choose which meals your last

Now you can't move cause you're strapped in
The rooms full, they wanna watch til the end
Murder was the case that they gave him
Life or a life, they world is wish I lived in

Felt hard and got a rep now
The devil must have told you
Evil ways will always get you further
"Real thugs and crooks get away with murder"

Now you owe it to the world
Gotta pay with your life
