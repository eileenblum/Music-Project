State of the world too cold for anyone to live in
Death, disease, pain. An apocalyptic vision
Knowing our reality is about to be a tragedy
Consumed by the nightmare that surrounds me
A cruel god pours his hate on the world
Laughing as we caught in the twirl of his wand
We get sucked into a dark realm
Gods watching and laughing as we pray for help

A man killed his for cash
Nobody stops to look around they all forget
before his body hits the ground
He's got a kid forced to grow up alone
Broken down, hell is now his home

Cold and sad, lost and alone
The world just turns their backs
Nothing to call his own

A girl forced out of home by the city
Living on the streets now
Uses drugs to cope with the pain
Now she needs it in her veins
Sex for money, money for drugs
Lost and alone looking for love
