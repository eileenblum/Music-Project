Frustration. Depression.
I could never accept the solitude, I tried my best to find solace
It was burning a hole through my chest and trying to kill me and doings it best
Erase the trace of the memory

Alone I face the truth by myself
Alone I can't trust anything
Alone I feel the pain
Alone I remain

Try my best to forget, I let my mind run wild
All my biggest fears become real there and I start to fall
From the real world and I can't stop
I start to fall and I land hard

Alone I face the truth by myself
Alone I can't trust anything
Alone I feel the pain
Alone I remain

Seems the bent knee and closed hands can't save me
and hes not the one to look to, to be saved
Gotta search inside to find strength
Gotta handle this because all I've got left is pain to feel and the time to heal

Alone I face the truth just to live you can't imagine what that's like
Alone your serenity's stolen leaving me broken
