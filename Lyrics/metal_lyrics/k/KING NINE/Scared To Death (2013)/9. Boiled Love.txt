I'm doing what I can to be the better man
Wish you never turned down the road that you did
But your here now and you've hit bottom
Gotta scratch your way out of this hole

Turn your back on the pain
As the boiled love enters your vein
Helps to forget for a moment
Its your hell and you own it

When I ask whats going on you lie
Can't look at me and tell me the truth
I see it in your eyes, you're all fucked up

Lean on to me, do what you need to do
You've got to see that this shit ain't a game
I don't point fingers but, its time to quit
Before it all puts out your flame

When I ask whats going on you lie
Can't look at me and tell me the truth
I hear it in your cries, you're all fucked up

Where were you when I needed you the most
Cause you know that it hurts me too
Dig deep now
Before you wind up in the dirt

Turn your back on the pain
As the boiled love enters your vein
Helps to forget for a moment
Its your hell and you own it
