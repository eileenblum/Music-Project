I'm waiting on a day that will never come
Disappearing hope, I'm losing it
I've got nothing left to hold on to

Keep digging deeper
I don't want out of this hole
Pull the plug, pull the plug
Under the dirty stays my soul

Cast into flames for the wrongs I couldn't avoid
Spiteful hand of god crushes me for my crime of being born
Refuse to beg for forgiveness
Rather live in darkness
I never asked to be alive
Why me?

Keep digging deeper
I don't want out of this hole
Pull the plug, pull the plug
Under the dirty stays my soul

Its just you and me now
Thoughts of killing ease my mind
Will you punish me for the thought
Or can I contain myself
Or will I end up in the chair, with justice passing through my body
I know you don't have the reach to try and stop me
