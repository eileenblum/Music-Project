Often dark and sultry lips that softly silence righteous gifts like fear God or
he will cut you down, then what is to be free
She feeds from worlds beneath love that are but are not born. As I see fragrant
mists envelop me.

For lies that hide and coincide while she prays upon the youngest ones, as a
demon of the deepest sea, like a whore on bended knee. She wears all beauty to
behold terrible and glorious to be shown the dark side of me. And curves so
delicate with me inside.

Blind unbound delight, This siren for sight, This temptress divine, Holds power
over life men fear her, Sword hand Goddess.
Her wings as night, A lotus beyond light, To cut straight through, And change
the view, She leads the way through the land of death.

Can't run away to be saved or betray.

While she can bend lines in sand. Distorts the mirror and will put in your hand
the blood of those who've died to demon sacrificed. It'd real don't lie the
cosmic roll of dice, the darkest endless ride. She who can put in your hand
your life slipping by.

Is a death storm over us. KI SI KIL LIL LA KE is a death storm over us.
