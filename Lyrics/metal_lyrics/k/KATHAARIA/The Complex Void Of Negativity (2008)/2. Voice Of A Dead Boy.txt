Curse the state of dreaming
Lost in reflections of perished schemes
What distress to drown in what once was
Abyss of possession - wounds of the great lie
Grant me strength, so i might fall

Years as a funeral
These crumbling walls called mind
Put it all in a shell, i call it coffin
All that dwells within, call it family

Taste of the dreamlife of angels
As an ubiquitous delusion
Just a child, all is yet to be...destroyed!
I will not be reborn

Oblivion is the strength of this world and its fall
Stigmata xenophobia

In this void's no hope, no memory remains
Only fear, annihilation of self

For all shine inside this wreck
When it all comes down again
Let the void be known (let the voice be known)
