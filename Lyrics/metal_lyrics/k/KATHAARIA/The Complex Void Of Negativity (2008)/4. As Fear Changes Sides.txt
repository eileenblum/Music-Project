Conjuring the impulse of fear
Feeding on the anguish of others
As the last witness dies
Two streams lead into the void
Scathing the tension alone
As fish drowning in water

Unfaithfully denying
The black October's dawn
Blind eyes crying over
A rewardless moment of purity
Interorganic bodicide
This cold feels right

The weeping shall perish
Omitting the prime distance
To the circle of plagues
Awaiting the silent flood

The tyranny of the haunted
Compulsive in their extinction
Fueled by the logics of nova secta

Disparage the stumbling
Among dying cattle struggling for release
(as) the cold sword of vengeance
Perpetrates the finishing act
