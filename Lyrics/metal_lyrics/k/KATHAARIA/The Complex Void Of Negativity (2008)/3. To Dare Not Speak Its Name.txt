Woebegone naked soul
Distorted view upon invidious world of schemes
Slit my eyes, for they'll remember

A breathing corpse
Dim, estranged, indifferent
As life turns colder than death
You'll dare not speak its name

"i am perplexed"

Black bird grievance
Mute philobate moans
Dissociate from the shadowy remains of the I

Renounce the "silent balance of perfection"
Consummate the stifling of purity
