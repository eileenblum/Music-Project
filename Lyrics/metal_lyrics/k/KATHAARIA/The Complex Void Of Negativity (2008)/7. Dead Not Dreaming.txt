I have witnessed my own decline
As a part of this constellation of falling and wounding
How to release with a need to estrange
And a barren struggle to recommence
Vitiation cycle - an impromptu fall

Life's borders desecrated
It's all so visible yet so unalterable
I have desocialised down in the dirt

Finding solace in the fading of this vision of inner chaos
Beyond all voices a hoarse noise coming to an end
The past is dead!

This shroud of silence covers all
For what is dead will never dream again
Praise the decay of everything...
