Look at all those hipsters
Eating right from the trees
Look at the skinny suckers
Always shitting flabby

I won't eat no damn thing
That can't previously walk
I need food providing
Decent nutricious facts

Ketchup is the one vegetable
I'm ok to swallow
Congrats Mr Reagan
For that thoughtful law

I might consider french fries
To go along my steak
If their name did not sound
So definitely gay

I grew here on the land
Of the pilgrim fathers
Those who fed on bisons, wild geese
Longhorns and hare

I won't give up heritage
For that hype green rubbish
Nor change my T-bone steak
For diuretic black radish

The only real sad thing
About my fellow meat
Is that it's fed with grass
In theory at least
