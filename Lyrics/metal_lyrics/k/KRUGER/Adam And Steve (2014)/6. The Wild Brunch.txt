Look at that beauty
Half a ton of iron from
Big Barn in Des Moines
A dreadful weaponry
Ten grand of shiny steel
And half as much of extras

Engines are running
We hit the road at noon
Get the fuck out of our way
The beasts they're roaring
Beware all of you state troopers
Don't mess with us today

Today is the day
The Leathernecks MC
Is taking back the road
Today is Sunday
Don't you try to curb me
I'm fucking out of control

No gods no masters
We won't slow down a jot
Before Joe's diner
My hunger for freedom
Won't be appeased until I get
My diet coke and my quarterpounder
