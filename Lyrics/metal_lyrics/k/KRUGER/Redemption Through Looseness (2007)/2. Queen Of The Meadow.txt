Nobody had bet a buck on her but she had my full support. The first day I saw her I begged her to the Lord. She was always so cute in her winter dress No other girl is half pretty as my sweet Beth I never talked to her I only dare to look I can't even think of touching her so I go to the hookers Every buck I spend there I'm just thinking of her Think of the way she is playing with her hair She ran for miss Minnesota cause she knows what she wants While I would pay a king's ransom for just a single dance
