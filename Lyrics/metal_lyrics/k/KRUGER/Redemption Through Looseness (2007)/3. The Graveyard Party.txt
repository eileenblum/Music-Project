Goodie it is already friday night It's time for our weekly party at St JohnÃ¢â¬Ës graveyard The hearts are warm and the 10-pack is ready Always bring along some drinks when you join a party The crowd will be far too quiet it's a chance we come by My mates and I know how to light up the night After happy hour we desacrate some graves We have business to do with your great-grandmothers Are you Beatles or are you Gorgoroth ?
