My brothers and sisters please pay allegiance To the Holy trinity and His zealous servants. We are the holders of the Holy keys And of some bank accounts across the country. Our know-how ain't any late hype bullshit It's been improved through hundreds of years. We're been hiring project managers, Thousands of experts, street teams and lawyers. Our branches in each town are sold out every week. Our national turnover outrageously improves every year. So please let me hear your prayers loud and clear While you're having your soul saved i'll get myself a beer.
