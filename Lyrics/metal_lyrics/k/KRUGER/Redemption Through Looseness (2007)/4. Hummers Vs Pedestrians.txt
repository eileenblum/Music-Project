I am the employee of the week at General Motors Norfolk I deserve cruising down the street without giving a fuck But how the hell can I drive at a decent speed With all these jerks outside fucking blocking the streets

Let's give the road back to who it truly belongs Explosion engines, high speed and oil combustion Cyclists -- get off the way Pedestrians -- make my day
