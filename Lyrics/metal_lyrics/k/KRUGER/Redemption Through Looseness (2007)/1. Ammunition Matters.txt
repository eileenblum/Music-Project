I live in Lincoln, Nebraska, born 1974 In a holy land of devotion, freedom and labour. God orders, we obey. I was born redneck, catholic, and simpleton, With a pea in the skull and with voices in my head With my manly fellows of the militia troops We have been indefatigably rehearsing in the woods Shooting at foxes, chickens, swans or moose Whatever is alive, walks, swims or flies It's damn easy to track down the enemy We're nothing but surrounded by un-american activities This place is crawling with faggots, wogs and communists And the more time goes by the more heretics you meet Bottom's up Ã¢â¬â now's the time to celebrate Grab your shotguns, rifles and blades, After improving our talent on the fauna It's time to shoot the vermin out of Nebraska
