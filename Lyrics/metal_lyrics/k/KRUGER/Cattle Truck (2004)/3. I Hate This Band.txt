First I need to say I did NOT want To sing in their stupid rock band They forced me in. Besides I don't have a cool voice Neither a single vocal idea this far But I got used to it - and so did they. Now I find myself trying to spit out a few silly words on a disorganized bunch of distortion I am getting too old for that shit Hey guys I am more than thirty years old Do you really want me to end up like an Osbourne ? I want to start now my crooner career Ã¢â¬ÅMountains of drugs, rivers of lager" This hectic way of life is turning into a nightmare I am too old for that shit
