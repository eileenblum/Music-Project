I used to be the emperor of Carson City Oh my green Nevada what the hell happened to you ? Remember son we were the masters of the prairie Longhorns were the only queens on these meadows Longhorns were the only queens from Idaho to Mississippi We were the guardians of the West ancestral values Then came the backstreet girls and the roulette wheel Dives grew up in the middle of our land Filled with punks fearing neither God nor man Oh my green Nevada what the hell happened to you ? The good old meat worship has gone
