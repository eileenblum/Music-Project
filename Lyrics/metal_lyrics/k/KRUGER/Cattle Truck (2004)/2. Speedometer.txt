I ain't got no soul, I am a driving machine I don't know no feelings I don't know no fear I am the highway's lover I am the Nacho Vidal of the streets I don't need no rest I don't need no sleep I just make love to the road with my 50 tons dick I can stand exhaustment I can stand any heat I am the asphalt warrior I am the keeper of the street My truck's name is Howard, we never part We keep sleeping together every single fucking night Some hamburgers and fresh lager This is the only fuel I need Drive twelve hours a day That's what God designed me for
