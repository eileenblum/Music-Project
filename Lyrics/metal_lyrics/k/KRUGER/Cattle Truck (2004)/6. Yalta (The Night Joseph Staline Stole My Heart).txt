That day I was ready to fight for the new world order But that very night Joseph Staline stole my heart He was so smart, looked like a king in his tight dark green suit Oh boy I been fooled like a twelve-years old chick We spend five nights with the british fat ass, talking like Gods, sharing the world And stupid me I couldn't think of_anything but his deep brown eyes I had planned to save Europe but that night Joseph Staline stole my heart At least I wanted to spare Poland, but that night Joseph Staline stole my heart And when I think of the goddamn picture that was in every paper I just can see nothing but honey - in the look of my eyes. I fucked up.
