My forefathers first set foot on this ground
In 1851 without a cent in their hand
They sailed for many weeks from the old continent
From places which ain't even worth remembering
They were the third wave of our mighty pioneers
Those who conquered the west with neither rest nor fear They ran into redskins and into rattlesnakes
And they wasted all vermin that was blocking the way.
My father he was a man of courage and pride
He fought for liberty in two different wars,
Came back from pointless countries with beautiful scars
He killed for freedom, democracy and low-priced gallons
He passed on to us endless credit and wireless connection.
Do we really have to start it all over again?
