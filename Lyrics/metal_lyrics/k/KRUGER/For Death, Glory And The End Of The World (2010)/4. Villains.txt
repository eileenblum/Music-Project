In this day and age
Landmarks are wearing away
Villains look exactly just like you
How to recognize your friend from foe?
The bad guys are supposed to be mean
To have bad breath, rotten teeth and be ugly as sin
But they are moving near unchallenged, shifty as sharks
Ready to make off with your savings, peace of mind and wife
Mine just left me for one of these bandits
My mortgage will follow her at pretty short notice
What does my banker have that I don't
Besides a good appearance and a couple of millions?
