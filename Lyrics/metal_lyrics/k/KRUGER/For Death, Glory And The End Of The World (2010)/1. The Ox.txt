Everybody calls him "The Ox"
He's a man of fifty thousands strong
You won't ever find such a rider
For miles and miles around
An example for the nation

Six and a half feet of muscle and sheer determination
They say he once rode a bull of twelve hundreds pounds
And had the beast tamed and sent down for the count
I saw him bring down a calf in less than two minutes
When he runs for president he'll sure get my vote
When you can break in a bull
You can sure enough break in the world
