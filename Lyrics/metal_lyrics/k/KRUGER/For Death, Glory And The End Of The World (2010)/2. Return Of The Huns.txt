The sun is about to rise in the east
Countless legions are stamping their feet
Thousands of Huns, massed at the border
Ready to pay homage to their forefathers
For death, glory and the end of the world
They will march on the West and will lay down their terms
Heads will be chopped off, kings be overthroned
Blood will flow like water, flesh be scythed to the bone
I've been fancying such devastation
A good old carnage in the old fashion
Quartering and rapes without distinction
Like back in the days when we were fed to lions
Huns got their revenge, I would do just the same
If it was me sewing their jeans for thirty yuans a week
