We don't like strangers much around here
Neither do we stand nor tolerate any prowlers near
There have been five untoward accidents last year
Strangers just like you in the dark were mistaken for thieves
We have been working hard with our own bare hands
To built a virtuous town out of this dusty land
The bold pioneers here know how to defend their possessions
What God fails to protect is watched by Smith &amp; Wesson
Life has told us to worship our guns
At least as equally as our Lord and Christ
