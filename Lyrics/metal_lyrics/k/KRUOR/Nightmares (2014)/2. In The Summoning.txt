On the death of the virgin sacrifice
the lost words are spoken again
In the circle unbind the malevolence
My witch, your time has come

Read the lines carved in blood
See to the end of the summoning
and behold the rise of the beast

When the darkness reigns the earth
Unleash the beast and the demons inside

In the summoning

Nearing the end of the humanity
Return back to life, punish the unwary
At nightfall we hunt them to last
When dead rise to rule
and their darkest dreams come true

And we owe it all to you...
