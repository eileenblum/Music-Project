Unrivaled in sickness
The sight is too hideous
We are now complete
We are bound forever
Put together in pieces
to create perfection
Eternity now opens
for us to reign supreme

We are ungodly disgusting

A flawless infusion
The absolute matrimony
Never leave my side
For we are now one
The ultimate covenant
Allegiance in blood
For we are a legion
The living immortal

Feast on the humans
We eat them alive
To feed this morbid carnation
that needs to devour to survive

Each day we grow stronger
Until there's nothing left
but only the grotesque
