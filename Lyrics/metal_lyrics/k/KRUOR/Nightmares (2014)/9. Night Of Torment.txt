Incinerated to your amusement
Ten times desecrated, then re-animated
Now is your turn to feel
the skin melting off your face
The raw flesh burning away
I will make you beg to die

And the pain never ends
That is not even real

I carve my name on your carcass
The insignia of the beast
This is my revelation
and I'm your 666
Hanging from the ceiling
Impaled, bound in chains
Then drown in the pool
of the ocean of your own blood

Embrace the agony
The forever decay

The night of torment
Begins in violence
The night of torment
To suffering and death

And the pain is not even real
