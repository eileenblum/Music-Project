Once we were just a dream
From which they could awake
Now the words reach beyond the mist
The reality has become untrue

Open your eyes
I stand on your bed
Looking down at you screaming
Now we have all the time in the world
To play with your infectious mind

Your god has left you to rot
Abandoned in emptiness
We are your creation
We are abomination

Like the illusion of god
You made us what we are
For he is the same as me
A plague ridden conceit
