Consumed by the earth
Resting six feet under
Rotten brains dissolved
Dreaming of liberation

The rest is uneasy, the bones are broken
Screaming alone in perfect silence
The body is decayed, the mind is frozen
Yet still my dead eyes are open

Maggots eating the flesh away
Disposing the unpure
Lying dead silent for years
Now my heart is beating again

Slaughtered before the sleep
By the devoted to false beliefs
I put my trust in black magic
The witch will set me free

Let me out of my grave
I sleep no more
I am alive
