Burn me krematorian
Purge me in flames
In your sacred name
Bathe in the blood of the tainted
and show us the pathway to eternity

Witness the passing of time
When all else dies
In your hands they turn to ashes

Proceed the omen

The raging storm in horizon
marks the beginning
and the end of the last rain
The mountains move
to shut you inside
and bring you to life
when it's time to purify

Burn me krematorian
Purge me in flames
In your sacred name
