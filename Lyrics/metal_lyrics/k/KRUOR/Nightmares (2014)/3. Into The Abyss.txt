The crows carry the word
Spoken in a language forgotten
In dark swarm lies the peril
The symbol of death and torment

The walk of the lost souls
Leads to the gates of demise
Digging graves of our own
Where we all die together
Those who came from beyond
have destroyed our homes
On the rise to damnation
Follow me into the abyss

When all light has faded
the dead lie desecrated
From life to nothingness
In our aggression we demented

Blindly follow the sun
that never rises again
Lost from the horizon
With promise of redemption
