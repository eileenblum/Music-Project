When you burn me, i will return
I walk with the death by my side
His breath is the frostbite
that calls the winter to come

The unsaint takes her last breath
They threw her in the fire
Purging the soul of evil
In hope of salvation
For they not know
another dawn will come
Hand by hand with Armageddon
when the age of demons arrive

Your death was not in vain
The dread revelation is complete
For the dying last hex
Brought alive their nightmares

Rise from the depths, become real
All my creatures of the night

We have awaken
Twisted creations of the mind
Born from the haunting dreams
When the black sun rises
The earth is frozen
Eternal darkness set in still

At dawn black sun is rising
The witch trials have ended
