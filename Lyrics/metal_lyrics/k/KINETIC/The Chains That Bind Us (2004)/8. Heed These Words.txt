Having my last thought on you I wanna leave my inheritance in your mind
Don't cry for my death, it's so common seeing someone
You reverence leaving forever

Look me in the eyes and read my lips, time fades away so am I, just listen!

[Chorus]
Creating eternal icons is easy; unnailing them it's so laborious, so obsessive
A Soul is always dying when flesh begins to be haughty

Heed these words

Time perishes everything, even a God's decent spirit but we're just men!
I was too weak in life
don't you please
repeat the mistakes
I made

just listen!
