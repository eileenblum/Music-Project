My tears won't resurrect you-and I know that
This is my last offer to you but you don't deserve it
Your tombstone seems to be untainted-so ironic
'Cause you were as filthy as a gutter
No human soul inside you when you were among us
A sea of immorality has flooded up your mind

You tried to build me in your image, coarse and disgraceful
And I'm still wondering how have you succeeded

[Chorus]
Father, let this dirt that covers you to be cursed
Let your sinful heritage never let you rest
Free and pure was my paragon for living
The sense you scorched - teaching me your doctrines for life

Your only goal creating victimizers -I'm but one of them
Making us walk your path
Making us believe that's the way to succeed

I wish I could turn back time
I wish I could overturn all your accomplished tasks
I know now, this is impossible
Your speckle on me now never fades
Even your death can't erase it

I'll curse you till I die
