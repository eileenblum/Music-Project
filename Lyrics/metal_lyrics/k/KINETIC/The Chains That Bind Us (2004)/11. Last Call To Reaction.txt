Dreams coming from soul's depths.
So frozen like a lie coming from a whore's mouth
Can't you see?

We are deep in the dark dull of uncertainty
walking it's never ending path
Look at this certainty of existence
Look in their minds all over
It makes me sick just to know that
I have not enough time to get old
But this feeling grows in my own soul only

[Chorus]
Logic wanders out of it's natural environment
And men who lost it believe they're free
Their hearts so cruel, ruthlessness in their eyes
Entraps their substance, preventing them to have a chance
On a last call for reaction

Look at this horrible picture
Here comes the "Game Over" but no one sees that
It makes me sick just to know
that they have no time to understand

And provocatively they ignore the whole senseless fact
Who's able to see the truth?
Who's able to change the ways?
Who's able to make a child to laugh in his dark nightmares
By changing them to folktales...

It's so easy to become a fatalist
Considering that everything around is unchangeable
I see the dread inside everyone's soul
Although they want to pass of cogent
Some laughs full of irony are enough

For a kind who calls itself Human
But when the circle of ravage will be complete
I'd love to see everyone's passion for deliverance

Logic wanders out of it's natural environment
And men who lost it believe they're free
Their hearts so cruel, ruthlessness in their eyes
Entraps their substance, preventing them to have a chance
On a last call for reaction
