Formless seed between the Chaos and the Light
Greed the malice-follow the leader
Aeons of fear, fusion of the Universe
Only Time will be the prophet

God and Time together as one
Blackened space, chaotic thoughts
Supreme overpower extends Humanity
Controlling, manipulating the unsuspected
Symbols of misery become the One
Demise devours the world

[Chorus]
Power's eyes are watching us
Fallen belief of our past
Dignity and Honor deflect the Rotten God
Lies inside the truth
Broken mirror of our destiny
Which will never be as one in our eyes

Symbols of misery become the One
Demise devours the world
Aeons of fear, fusion of the Universe
Only Time will be the prophet

Supreme overpower extends Humanity
Controlling, manipulating the unsuspected
Symbols of misery become the One
Demise devours the world

God and Time Together as one
The One that lies beneath the silky cover
Stronger now than ever overwhelms Human's life
Arranging the things that will never be tasted by the alive

Destiny Comes Over!!!
