I wake up and put my gun on
Think about my loved ones
Wonder how it got like this
I should be writing love songs
Should be having children
Instead I'm writing letters to the victims kids and they say

"I'm sorry for your loss but I too am a dead man
And you can try to kill me it won't do a damn thing
I'll live forever through these words they keep on dancing"

1 and 2 and pirouette
2 and 3 and assemble
1 and 2 and battery
Pirouette

I wake up and put your song on
Can't believe that you're gone
Understand that I did this
Because it's handguns and it's heroin
And all of us will die young
So I'm writing letters to the victims kids and they say

Tonight we dance because tomorrow isn't promised and we never had a chanceâ¦
