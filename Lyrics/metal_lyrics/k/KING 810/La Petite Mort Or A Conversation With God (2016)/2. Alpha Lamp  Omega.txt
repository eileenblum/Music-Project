Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the truth
God made me in his image who the fuck made you
You want my voice from me you can have it just know
I sound like this because the Devil has my throat

I make your insides shift that is my gift
The sea parts and then comes the flood
And men have died to make this you can't imitate shit
The talent I have I paid for in blood

I can tell you about things you'll die never having known
And I can take you places you could never ever go
And I've been there so just know that death comes slow
And life goes fast before you know it its through with your ass

Bitch I am the powers that be
I am Christ crucified on the T
I am the Alpha and the Omega
I'm the messiah, the gnashing of teeth
No one meets death until they see me
I am the Alpha and the Omega

So this is what you wanted
You wanna carry this curse
And have to cover your skin because the blowing wind hurts
You want your childhood taken from you
You wanna feel someones soul leave their body through their knife wounds

I make your insides shift that is my gift
The sea parts and then comes the flood
And men have died to make this you can't imitate shit
The talent I have I paid for in blood

Bitch I am the powers that be
I am Christ crucified on the T
I am the Alpha and the Omega
I'm the messiah, the gnashing of teeth
No one meets death until they see me
I am the Alpha and the Omega

Why they take the name that my mamma gave to me and they use it in vain
Why they don't look up when they speak to me like I'm not ten stories tall and they're weak to me

I am the powers that be
I am infinite; you're not shit, you're weak
I am the Alpha and the Omega
I'm the messiah, the gnashing of teeth
No one meets death until they see me
I am the Alpha and the Omega
