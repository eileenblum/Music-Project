I'm back home motherfucker, give me my guns and my throne.
Tell the music pussies to leave me the fuck alone.
I go on the road, I come back, people I know have died.
If I was here I could have saved them, so this music's cost me lives.
But the devil's in my bone marrow, this's part of the deal.
I still don't know who I am, and I don't know how I feel.
In my head I've got a couple records in me, then I'm killed.
Like I'm Biggie, or I'm Amy, or I'm Janice if you will.
Where I'm from, you know I'm from Murder Town.
What we do, stab them up and gun them down.
When they fall, keep shooting to make sure their dead.
Where we hit them, in their hearts and in their heads.
17th chapter of St. Luke is written, the kingdom of God is within man,
Not one man nor a group of men, but all men.
In you, you the people have the power, the power to create.
