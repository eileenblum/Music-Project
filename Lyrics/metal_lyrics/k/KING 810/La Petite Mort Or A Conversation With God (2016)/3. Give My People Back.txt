Devil take my hand,
Pen me out some words that will make them understand,
Understand what hell's like.
Devil use my voice,
Try an explain to them that I didn't have a choice,
It was my life or it's their life.
'Cause they have never had a knife in their skin, or a bullet hit them, or a friend die in the pen.
And they have never slept outside in the cold,
Lied, cheated and stole,
And begged for it to end.

When the wind blows, it hurts
And when they touch me, it's worse.
Tell me what's this all worth?

'Cause Hell is hot, and I'm not fit for life on earth.
Go to Hell and I tell 'em give my people back.
Devil man this I ask you give my people back.
All I've done wasn't fun, I think you owe me that.
March through Hell and I came to take my people back.
Give 'em back now.
Woman take your hands,
Press them both together and pray to the man.
Pray for his forgiveness.
You can't help who you love.
Ask that when you go that he lets you up above.
So that he don't punish both of us.
'Cause you have never put a gun on a man.
Squeezed as many times as you can, until it locks up and jams.
And you have never been to Hell and made a deal.
Seen that he was real and been a part of his plan.

When the wind blows, it hurts.
And when they touch me, it's worse.
Tell me, what's this all worth?

'Cause Hell is hot, and I'm not fit for life on earth.
Go to Hell and I tell 'em give my people back.
Devil man this I ask you give my people back.
All I've done wasn't fun, I think you owe me that.
March through Hell and I came to take my people back.
Go to Hell and I tell 'em give my people back.

Devil man this I ask you give my people back.
All I've done wasn't fun, I think you owe me that.
March through Hell and I came to take my people back.
Give 'em back now.
Give 'em back now.

All my brothers doing years off in prison.
Or those who spend their lives in the system.
(Give 'em back now.)
Those wishing they had a life worth living.
Or those who are enslaved by religion.
(Give 'em back now.)
All the children who were born without a chance.
I'm one of you for everything it's worth.
(Give 'em back now.)
Who sit in silence 'cause the faintest sound hurts.

'Cause hell is hot, and I'm not fit for life on earth.
Go to Hell and I tell 'em give my people back.
Devil man this I ask you give my people back.
All I've done wasn't fun, I think you owe me that.
March through Hell and I came to take my people back.
Go to Hell and I tell 'em give my people back.

Devil man this I ask you give my people back.
All I've done wasn't fun, I think you owe me that.
March through Hell and I came to take my people back.
Give 'em back now.
Give 'em back now.
We fight and we don't back down.
