I've seen the Eiffel out in Paris
I've seen whats left of the wall in Berlin
I've seen Cusco, Giza, Serengeti
Cant say I care to go again
I've seen many of natures wonders
I've seen it rain I've seen it flood
I've helped a starving man a sick man some children
It didn't move me like they say it does

Life's not enough

I've went 200 on a motorbike
I've jumped out of a moving plane
I've lI'ved poor and I've lI'ved well and I've lI'ved in jail
All of it felt about the same

I've had more than 1 woman
I've had more than 2 or 3
I've stood in front of 15000 and sang my songs
It really didn't do nothing to me

Life's not enough

I've been shot by another person
I've shot back and didn't blink
I've seen phenomena miracles small and large
It didn't really move me like you'd think

I've seen a child be born
I've seen a fortune be made
I've seen the Devil I mean the real God he is in me
But that don't really make me wanna stay

Life's not enough
