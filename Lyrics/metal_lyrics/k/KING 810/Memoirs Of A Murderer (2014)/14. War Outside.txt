Oh here goes another gift for this world
This world that keeps filling my body with holes
My scars they itch and I pick my scabs and I grow
While they all try to cut my throat
But god ain't gonna let me go to my grave
Without showing you what he has made
Thereâs a war outside
Thereâs a war outside and just know that if I die
Know that I fought all my life for this
Thereâs a war outside and if I should die tonight
Whether itâs wrong or its right Iâll be missed
Thereâs a war outside
And when morning brings her light we'll be his
Thereâs a war outside
Bow your heads and close your eyes
Oh my brothers and sisters weâre trapped in this hole
But weâre kept down here because itâs all about control
But weâre trapped together so well stick tight and out of the cold
And theyâll reap just what theyâve sewn
God ain't gonna let us go to our graves without showing them what he has made
Seen my first body when I was a kid
I thought sleeping in streets was just something they did
Then I grew older I never grew up
I wouldnât let them take something I didnât get enough of
I put a whole life sentence in these streets
I didnât sleep a wink I had to kill to eat
They tried to make it so I didnât see 25
And when I did I thanked god and then I retired
Thereâs a war outside
I hear all these critics talk but I listen to none
Cause none of them have ever been where music comes from
And none of them have ever stepped foot inside a slum
And none of them have ever wrapped their hands around a gun
And squeezed till its empty and it locks up and itâs done
And feel the man on the other sides last breath leap out his lungs
Iâve been doing this here since I was young
So next time you speak about me just cut out your fucking tongue
