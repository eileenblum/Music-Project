When I was growing up not long ago though it seems like itâs so far away
We played under the sun we didnât plug ourselves in were made to pray at the end of the day
Now everything changing these people arenât real and our children are dying
Cause theyâre hard and donât feel and its lie and its cheat and its steal and its kill
And its mothers go bury your sons
All I smell is smoke when I step outside
And the mountains keep crying cause were burning alive
And the people fight the people like they forgot we were equal
Remember when cowboys were cowboys and only children played pretend
Remember when a man was a man not a product or a title or a brand
Now everythingâs changing these people arenât real and we have no heroes
Theyâre pink in the middle
They donât say what they mean they donât do what they say they wonât stand here and die for it
All I smell is smoke when I step outside
And the mountains keep crying cause were burning alive
And the people fight the people like they forgot we were equal
And the shadows from the buildings just kill the trees
And the only thing weâre good at is spreading disease
And the people kill the people like they forgot we were equal
Remember when we hadnât a worry and things just moved slower now
We werenât in such a hurry
And we werenât dying so we didnât have to bury our brothers and sisters in the dirt
Now everything changing these people arenât real
And our children are dying cause theyâre hard and canât feel
And its lie and its cheat and its steal and its kill
And its I die if I donât shoot first...
And you canât kill something that doesnât care if it lives
And Iâm sinking with my city like a captain and ship
And the people kill the people like they forgot we were equal
