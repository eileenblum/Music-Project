I hail from a place where nobody wants to come
Cause you better bring a gun and you better not run
And I grew up with the pushers and the killers and the thieves
But some students and some artists and some workers knew me
And we all had that in common and we had this place
And weâd grow up to be dead because our city breeds hate
And the only way to beat it is to run I mean
Cause the shots keep us awake so we never can dream
And they whispered unto me write down what youâve seen
So the world knows our story and were finally free
They said we need it right and youâre the only one we trust
So promise that youâll write about us
Girls want me to write about sneaking through their windows
And the drive ins and the parks and the nights by the lake
And the boys want me to write about sneaking through windows
And the fights and the shootouts
When we caught that case
And we were on our own and we never came home
And it was us and the night and we made the most
If you ever make it out write down what youâve seen
So we all live forever and were finally free
They said we need it right and youâre the only one we trust
So promise that youâll write about us
So tonight I sat down and pulled my head out the clouds
And I closed my eyes and I thought out loud
I havenât seen Veronica since I told her how I felt
And the twins OD'ed
And Sarah sells herself
Maxineâs on the needle
Kellyâs man cuts her up
I see Kristy where she works and she donât bring the past up
Heathers had a few kids and I still see her around but I canât bring myself to speak to her
I just look down
Daniel Iâll get your killer and I swear by that
When I see your kids face I wish I were where youâre at
Tasha escaped yeah she moved out of state
Opies still in prison for that murder in 98
Jays in the cage until 2025
And D went in but he ain't come out alive
Joshua's dead I held his head while he bled
And I found xxxxx body and Iâll love her till Iâm dead
And they all said
If you ever make it out write down what youâve seen
So we all live forever and were finally free
They said we need it right and youâre the only one we trust
So promise that youâll write about us
