So Iâm sitting here with ghosts again some are women mostly men
Telling me of times they have had
And Iâm fantasizing about a hole in the ground
How and where Iâm gonna lay myself down and still die at 27 like we planned
Then she saw the look in my eyes
And began to sing a song I wonât describe
"In another life weâll be king and queen you and I"
Then she told me devil donât cry
Devil donât cry
I know things get tough and sometimes you wanna die
But âgod needs an enemy and I need a guyâ
And she told me devil donât cry
At least not tonite
And Iâm sitting alone again
All my friends are with their friends
Thinking of times I have had
And Iâm fantasizing about a hole in the ground
How and where Iâm gonna lay myself down and I find a knife in my hand
Tonite letâs pretend Iâm a man
And youâre a woman and weâre human just bones and this skin
And Iâll pretend that your touch makes everything right
If you pretend youâre not nervous that Iâve taken lives...
