I used to run to you but we're through
I used to lean on you but we're through
Today Iâm going away
Cause I needed something from you
That shit you're ashamed of
Thatâs sick and disgusting
Your pride wouldn't let it get by
And love is not enough
Itâs over, and so am I
I need your blood and guts
(1,2,3)
Give me your blood motherfucker
I want you
All of you
Like we're two
Oh, desperate lovers
But we're through
I used to pray for you but we're through
My half, my better half
The half that knows nothing of ethic or moral stance
Incestuous touching, ainât something sheâs afraid to dream
Weâre neither judged nor judging, we're free
Like you wish you could be
I only need one thing
(Let it out)
They try to find holes in my story
And I just point to holes in my body
Holes that tell the tales of knifes wounds and gun wounds
The struggle and suffering and murder and robbery
Thereâs no scars on that body, there's no cuts
Thereâs no story worth telling all of us
Thereâs no soul in that body, there's no trust
Thereâs only one thing inside you
Only blood
(Let it out)
I used to bleed for you but we're through
I used to kill for you but we're through
I used to fuck for you but we're through
But we're through
