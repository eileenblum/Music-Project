And Iâm walking round town again
And Iâm looking for a best friend
One that I can build a nest in
One that I could leave some sex in
If you could feel how this hurts
You would kill yourself first
Hacked my skin all up again
And Iâm hanging out with dead men
Iâm haunted by a memory or a dream about a better me
Before I had an enemy
Before they wanted my neck from me
Bow down pray to your god and
Kneel down donât pick from the garden again
Iâve been treading and trodden
Trying not to try and kill myself over again
And Iâm walking round town again
And Iâm looking for a fortune
One that I could buy the world with
I would trade it for my woman
If you could feel how this hurts
You would kill yourself first
And if Iâm shot down in the street again
Let me bleed till death if youâre a friend
Bow down pray to your god and
Kneel down donât pick from the garden again
Iâve been treading and trodden
Trying not to try and kill myself over again
Bow down pray to your god and
My girl donât eat from the garden again
Iâve been treading and trodden
Trying not to try and kill myself over again
