my imaginationâs not a crazy one, no
i grew up in the slums where they kill anything that grows
im saying i cant make these things up so
we only live reality, if you daydream then you go
and im tired of people saying i aint did nothing they did
im talking knife fights with kids ass kids
til one of us no longer lives
and ive been hanging with the wrong crew again
with myself and who else
and a bunch of dead men who wanna see my name on a headstone
finally motherfucker i can be alone
tell my woman just to visit me from time to time
and that i love her give my family that same line
and to my brothers, give my money to my murderers
they deserve to be rewarded for their hard work
im hard to kill, who was with me when i was gunned down
and stabbed up
i bled alone and it changed me to a cold fuck
and friend ive been on this course for so long
if you knew how painful it was for me to live
youâd want me gone
im numb from my head to my toes
how can i feel for another soul?
i cant even feel the fucking wind blow
and scars cover my body and im scary and im ugly
and women only touch me to tell others that theyâve touched me
and men only touch me with bullets or to slug me
and i only touch myself with a knife blade that cuts me
and the devil is a bitch who just keeps trying to fuck me
and my god is a woman who dont give a fuck about me
cuz no-one loves a killer, not truly, just trust me
where im from its survival of the fittest and they all haunt me
welcome to the worlds most dangerous game
i know youâve heard me say it before
now im inviting you to play
you better be better than just good aim
youâll need senses you either have âem or you dont
i cant explain
like when you walk into a room you memorise where everything is
the exits the doors the windows
are there stairs are there kids?
who youâll have to take and who youâll have trouble with
running can be retreat or repositioning you decide what it is
to a better vantage point
get low and dig in and make every shot count
cuz if the clip empties youâre finished
if a man approaches you at night and you have no idea why
dont wait to hear him speak, pull it out and dont shoot in the sky
his eyes will widen up and aim right between those eyes
when he drops, dont run
stand over him and feel him die
and if anyone youâre unsure aboutâs around, they gotta go too
or his family finds out
and you have people youâve never seen coming to kill you
and i dont care who you are and if you care or not
youâre looking over your shoulder at every passing car
you could be shot
and once youâve felt that stress, life doesnt get to you
not anymore, not after what weâve been through
and i no longer bother to ask father to forgive me
ive been fighting all my life, thereâs no fight left in me
every day i wake up ready to die
but when i turn the gun on myself all i see is your big eyes
and ive hurt you so much i cant do it one more time
so i grind my teeth together and i try to unwind
but time doesnt move when youâre sitting in this spot
and im trapped in this body with this soul i dont want
and i think at night i cut myself, to sleep
cuz i wake up, and im stuck to my sheets
and i dont recall what happened
was it me? was it possession?
i have scars appear on my skin after dreams
where are my big eyes where am i
ive lost my place at home by your side
ive been trapped in that killing field
where itâs carry a gun or die
and cocksuckers wanna know how im still alive
i had to kill to get here, boys
so, next time you try
know i was baptised in blood and gun powder at age 5
and when i close my eyes i only see one thing
a pile of hands i cut off belonging to men whoâve touched my queen and
i can no longer hold myself together
so im just gonna leave pieces of me laying wherever
