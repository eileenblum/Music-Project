I grew up in the church on Sunday
Back again, bury friends on Monday
They don't just die
They are killed from the gun-play
Or the heroin
Or a prison stay

It's a shame how we gotta live this way
Your nightmares ain't got nothing on this place
So stay down
Stay away
Stay safe
'Cause you aren't built that way!

You're fat around the heart
Are you scared, motherfucker?
Are you scared of the dark?
You're fat around the heart
The devil is real and I wear his mark
You're fat around the heart
Have you ever caught a body?
You wouldn't know where to start
You're fat around the heart
Are you scared, motherfucker?
Are you scared of the dark?
Are you scared of the dark?

It's the motherfuckin' boogeyman

God cannot save you
He's way up in the sky
Right here leaning over your body
So when I say you die, you die
Used to be peasant David
Until I slayed Goliath
Now I'm King David
The world fits in my shadow

I'm a giant and I kill everything I touch
So don't you shake hands
With that demon from the mud
You'll become part of something you want nothing of
That's why the gloves
Your ass will lose everything you love

This is war!
This is war!
This is war!

You're fat around the heart
Are you scared, motherfucker?
Are you scared of the dark?
You're fat around the heart
The devil is real and I wear his mark
You're fat around the heart
Have you ever caught a body?
You wouldn't know where to start
You're fat around the heart
Are you scared, motherfucker?
Are you scared of the dark?
Are you scared of the dark?

(It's a shame how we gotta live this way)

(The devil is real and I wear his mark)

(This is war!)
(This is war!)
(This is war!)

Sometimes late at night
My hand still wants around that knife
And when that thing flips open
Everything moves in slow motion
It's not right
It's not right
I know it's not
I need a change but it's this life
And I still feel like I'm chosen
To rip this motherfucker open!

This is war!
This is war!
This is war!
War!
War!

You're fat around the heart
Are you scared, motherfucker?
Are you scared of the dark?
You're fat around the heart
The devil is real and I wear his mark
You're fat around the heart
Have you ever caught a body?
You wouldn't know where to start
You're fat around the heart
Are you scared, motherfucker?
Are you scared of the dark?
