The fact that youâre ecstatic Iâm here is insulting
Means you truly didnât believe that shit that I was talking
That surprised look on your face is disgusting
My will is the law know that if you know one thing
Iâm still that defensive child that can be touched by no man
Not even the preacher Iâll saw off his fucking hands
Hereâs something that a square canât understand
If they baptize me in a lake ill drink the water till its land
My skins full of bad dead men
Skins full of good women
Some Iâll see when I go some Iâll never see them again
Cause this hell were in
Feels like an uphill fight
Feels like Iâm wrong when Iâm right
Feels like the best nite of my life
Feels like my skins too tight
Feels like Iâve lost my might
Feels like the best nite of my life
Scars in my face and theyâre never coming out
Like my friends in a cage and itâs all I think about
What made you think I wanted new friends?
My dead ones are just fine those were good men
My incarcerated ones will eventually come home again
You got bullets in your skin
You ain't been where Iâve been
Are you tired of hearing that yet?
Well Iâm tired of hearing lines about violence and empty threats
And what you would do
And if and when
Flint Michigan
Step into the lionâs den
Cold, becoming
Itâs crawling under my skin
It gets old and its numbing and it will never be the same way again
