Put your back against the wall
Ready your weapon
Tonight they try to kill us all
But we won't let them
If I should fall tell my mother that I tried
And I'll do the same for you if you die
(Let's ride)
Cause when the chips are down
There is no backing down
Bang [5x]
Who's gon stop us now?
Killem all [3x]
Gunem down hang their fucking bodies in the halls
Killem all [3x]
Cutem down letem fall fuckem all
Killem all [3x]
There's no law in this land we just killem all
Killem all [3x]
I'm about to killem all
Who's gon stop us now?
It's me against the world but I brought some friends with me
And they don't have no problem killing any of you for me [2x]
That's it
I tried talking to you about peace
I quit
They only wanna hear about the beast
Well sit
Open your ears and close your eyes and I'll try and tell you how it feels to fry
Taking a bullet feels like being set on fire and the knife blade feels ice cold
And I see things when I sleep at night no author could describe with words
And I've went to bed hungry and I've fought for my life and when the chips are down there's no backing down
When I try to explain it just drives me insane because I become so overwhelmed
