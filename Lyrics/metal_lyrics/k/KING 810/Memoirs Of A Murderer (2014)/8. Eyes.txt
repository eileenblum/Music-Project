I have never felt like this
You and I were meant to be
This donât go away
Iâll go to my grave about this
Cause you had me believing till our final days

And right now I wanna die
When you put me in the ground go deep
If you arenât in my life
Let me lay down in the earth and sleep

Sleep it all away

My feet wonât carry me no more
My mind donât see reason to go on like this
I have a heart built for war
But I have never fought no fucking war like this

And right now I wanna die
When you put me in the ground go deep
If you aren't in my life
Let me lay down in the earth and sleep
And right now I wanna die
When you put me in the ground go deep
If you aren't in my life
Let me lay down in the earth and sleep

Sleep it all away

And if god asks where my queen is
Iâll tell him you didnât mean this
Iâll tell him just what the truth is
Iâll tell him that I was stupid
And if god asks where my queen is
Iâll tell him you didnât mean this
Iâll tell him just what the truth is
Iâll tell him that I was stupid

And right now I wanna die
When you put me in the ground go deep
If you arenât in my life
Let me lay down in the earth and sleep
And right now I wanna die
When you put me in the ground go deep
If you arenât in my life
Let me lay down in the earth and sleep

Sleep it all away

And if god asks where my queen is
Iâll tell him you didnât mean this
Iâll tell him just what the truth is
Iâll tell him that I was stupid
