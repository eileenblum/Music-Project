Father whatâs the issue with your children
Theyâre acting like theyâre convinced that I wonât fucking kill them
They act like Iâm like them and Iâm not one in a billion
I am the devilâs son I have no fucking feelings
Your skin tightens up at the sight of a killing
My conscience has given up saying how I should be living
And I know I need to change and Iâm ready god willing
But I gave more than I took I only took the cards they were dealing
Would you kill
You say you can you say you will
Are you real
Are you ready for that cage of cold steel
My soul is scattered across the streets of my city itâs in pieces
Itâs fed upon by roaches and the rats and the leeches
Iâve participated in murder its left me sleepless
So I put my hands together I kneel and I pray to Jesus
You should pray too
Pray that this jams up cause Iâve done this before I donât clam up
Get on the floor put your motherfucking hands up
God make room Iâm about to send a man up
Would you kill
You say you can you say you will
Are you real
Are you ready for that cage of cold steel
Are you tough
That ain't enough
You gotta rust every place that I touch
Would you kill
You say you can you say you will
Iâve been under the knife been in front of the gun I have no fear
We donât turn and run where Iâm from we shoot our way out of here
And Iâve been to hell and back confined
And I grit my teeth and do my time
And I watch this world just pass me by
And I just sit and wonder why
Everything that I touch dies
Place pennies in both of my eyes
This place is eating me alive
