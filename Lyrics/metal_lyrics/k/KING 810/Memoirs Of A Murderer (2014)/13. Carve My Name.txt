My mother told me to stop talking about killing
So I promised that Iâd give her a song
But it wonât be long cause I ain't got long cause Iâve done wrong
And I feel as if Iâm barely hanging on
If you feel like I do and thereâs hollowness inside you
And you just canât seem to get things right
Your skins too tight and it keeps you up at night
Then wrap your fists around the handle of a knife
And recite
If you love me carve my name in your skin
And youâll never be alone again
Fight
I havenât written since they locked me in a cage
I was forced to remember it all
But I wonât be writing not tonite we will be fighting
And Iâll be standing right here beside you all
I want you to know thereâs no day I donât think of you
And your faces and our places and your names
And how were not like them we wonât pretend and we donât change
And we will never ever be the same
So again
The sky made a face I never seen it make today
And I wished that I werenât living this way
And god knows I try know there are days I donât pray
But till they lay me down in the ground and I fade away
We will fight
