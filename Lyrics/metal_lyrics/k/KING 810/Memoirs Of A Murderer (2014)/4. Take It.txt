Woke on the left side of the bed today that still wonât go away
And although Iâm shamed of this new world Iâll do another day
A kid gave me his soul today and I took it to the man to pay
My part of the deal we made but it still wonât go away
Take it
They try to take the light so I canât see
They try to take the clothes off of me
They try to take the air that I breathe
They try to go and fill me with disease
They try and take my soul
Got my Marie Laveau gri gri
Even that ain't saving me from ultimate destiny
I guess god wasnât impressed with me
Cause only devil comes around
Around here anyway downtown
When youâre born inside a hole
Youâre already off in the ground
