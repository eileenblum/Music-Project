I thought I smelled your scent today
And it took me on a ride I canât readily explain
I couldnât find a word to say
I just froze there in place and my body shot a million ways
My past comes creeping up again
I thought I heard your hands today
Heard them play a serenade on piano keys so far away
I donât know how this could be
Cause your hands were tied I tied them tight behind your back and to your feet
My past comes creeping up again
Boogeymen
She was as thick as I am sick
And my body still bears the scars from her kick
Her kiss was warm as piss
No one has ever made me feel like this
She couldnât enjoy it
She couldnât fake
She couldnât do anything through all of the tape
She wasnât willing to give what I wanted to take
I thought I saw your face today on a body in the street
Laying a sort of tragic way
Your brown eyes bled out to grey
And they were holes as deep as space
Full of flies full of decay
