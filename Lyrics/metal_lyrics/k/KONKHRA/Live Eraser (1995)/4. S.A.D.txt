As always the seasons have turned
And winter grasps the northern world
Might of darkness cease the day
The light of life driven away
Dust is what is left
Of the blossoming spring
Let the winter begin

How can I face this reflection of me?
My own flesh and blood, so dislike me
Father, I am of you
But yet so fresh, sprung of this world
Another world

Black milk of dawn I drink you
In the night of dark embrace
At dawn, at dusk, at all times
'till all my beloved are defaced

This light of dawn I'm ceasing
From my dark life enhanced
The sorrow of another world
In the past winters it's engulfed

And dust is what is left behind
Of the blossoming spring
Let the sorrow begin

How can I face this reflection of me?
My own flesh and blood so dislike me
Father, in herited
Indestructive bonds
Parallel carnations
Take us on, throughout all time
Travelling but you
Are inside me
And I see your history
Condemns me
