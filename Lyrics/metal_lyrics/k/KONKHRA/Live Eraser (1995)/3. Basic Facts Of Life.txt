Wanting to fly so much
I jump off a cliff in ecstasy
Feel my spirit grow wings
And hit the ground in agony
Mother Earth
Whose spirit I embrace
Yet a smaller part of you
I cannot comprehend

Sense that I am mortal
My body will wither and die
Despite my youth I'm aware
The basic facts of life

What about the souls
Are souls mortal too
Could you picture yourself take lives
As it is, it's all we have
I would take your life
To defend myself, the ones I love
I would take your life
I would take your life
