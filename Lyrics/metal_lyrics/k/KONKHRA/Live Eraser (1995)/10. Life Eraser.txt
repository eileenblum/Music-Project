With the power of mind,
I travel between worlds,
the spice of life,
New ways to joy my senses.

Jump through space,
on certain places,
gateways to spheres,
and time erases.

Traveller through time,
seeing the future,
disappear through blasts
of unknown power release.

Life eraser.
Life eraser.

I can't tell you
how small we are,
as one thousand images of life,
in one instand comes to me.

And I see the elder races.
Putrid forms of man,
see him rise and claim the earth.
his downfall is at hand.
