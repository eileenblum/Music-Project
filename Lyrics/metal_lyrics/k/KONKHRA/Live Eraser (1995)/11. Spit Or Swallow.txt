I've been inside you for years,
know all your functions by heart,
so don't try to sell me your cheap lies for truth,
don't fuck me, I know you, I'll fuck you.

I've been your conscience, all you couldn't grasp,
I know you by heart and by hate.
By all means, I know what is,
What was?
Don't fuck me, I'm fucked as it is,
I will drown those thorns of disgrace in your skin,
Pierce you, with my knowing of you.

I read you like an open book,
I tell you some pages are blank,
your story is yet to be told,
Don't fuck me, I know you, I'll fuck you.

Pathetic little cunt,
you moan for it as i eat you,
penetrate your skin inside of you again,
I own you, dictate you, derive your stupid actions.
Your mother turned her wrinkled worn out back at you whispering,
I've lost my child.

But still you are whispering, eat me, swallow me,
as you display your pink parts.
My nose smears blood, your youth and your virginity.
(long ago taken by me) still tempting and drawing.
Spit or swallow.
The opening words.

The opening words, spit or swallow, as long ago whispered by me,
still rings in your ears, I fucked the living out of you, bitch.
Semen of mine is your drug.
