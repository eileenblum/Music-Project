It's a real special way of achieving
I cannot quite confirm
Horrid twists in your ways or arranging
We will see what you get in return
I am feeling
Something never needed
Horrid way to twist the truth
Bond of mine
Suffered

I am not content with your excuses
Pathetic and useless, matching your intrusion
I can feel patience dying in me
Very soon to beyond my vergebound of mine
Broken
Patience is dying in me
Believe me
It can't be reversed
Boiling inside me, it's breeding, growing
I have to expose
Patience is dying in me
It can't be reversed
Fragments of the dying art
Aggressions released
Patience deceased
