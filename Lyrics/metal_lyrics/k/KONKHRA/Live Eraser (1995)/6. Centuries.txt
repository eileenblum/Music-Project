Some said nothing is forever,
Everything has come to an end,
And we know: Human lives are ending.
Everyday as the clock ticks
time, as measured pass me by.
Just know if there's nothing,
I want to keep my soul.

Centuries leave behind,
history for us to find,
pernitence, the humble man,
bow down, for you are on sacred ground.

For all things i held so dear.
In my life i saw disappear,
First blood, first stroke,
Even all in one blow.
Suffer me and I suffer you,
one blow and our lives are through,
You question me, I question you.
My gun sees your life is through.

Speak of the sun refused to shine,
speak of dust to hide behind,
speak of half-life period time,
speak of devils, speak of god,
speak of all that was lost at once,
speak of me and speak of you,
speak of how to see the day through.

Mysteries all solved,
by one man, centuries ago.
tragedy, the future.
Mankind is on holy ground.
Centuries leave behind.
Penitence, the humble man,
bow down, for you are on sacred ground.
