Water
Is swallowing me, trembles with me
Stealing my heart, freezing my skin

Take me
Under
Drowning
My sorrowful life

Is was build for another world, I don't belong
I will never be, human as thee

Below the earth I am waiting
Dreaming and dead for the world
But through weak minds I'm creating
New hope for spawning of me

Below the earth I am watching
Dreaming and dead for the world
But through weak minds I am hatching
New hope for spawning of me

Deeper
In minds I am writing
Spawning new dreams
That swallows the sense
Of consciousness

You will never know me
For I am beyond your sense
Of comprehension
I am out of this world
Of chaa, disorder, civian, war.
