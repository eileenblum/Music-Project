When all that's good in life comes crashing down
The pillars crumble with a hellish sound
I don't know what's going on
Dumbfound and without a clue
Is nothing good inside of you?
I spit my name like a fucking curse
And damn it all for getting worse

Someone save me
From this downward speeding
Someone help me
Please stop my soul from bleeding

I can't deal with reality
It's nothing but excruciating agony
I can't deal with my apathy
It's just in my genes and personality

A shroud of amphetamine clouds my mind
A forced solution of the killing kind
Now I know what's going on
It's myself destroying me
There's nothing left there anyway
I spit my name like a fucking curse
And damn it all for getting worse

[Lead: Lundemark]

I don't know what's real or not...
My brain is nothing but a bowl of snot...
