[Lundemark]

Is paradise too much? Then cover your eyes
Search for your lost disguise
In here we're all naked
Feeling vain?
Your age will double the pain
And then you start to go insane
Cause you've got nothing left to loose

Seeds of hate, you plant and grow
It seals your fate, in time you'll know
Grapes of wrath will rot
Know who you are cause you can't be who you're not

Walk the earth
Like you're cursed to, ever since birth
Without faith just with fear
Much rather disappear
Got no will to live
For life nothing but wrath
Self sought misery
You know your sin is sloth

Seeds of hate, you plant and grow
It seals your fate, in time you'll know
Grapes of wrath will rot
Know who you are

[Lead: Mathiesen]

Wasted youth
Went looking for a truth
Your beauty's in the past
Nothing can make it last
Got no will to live
For life nothing but wrath
Self sought misery
You know your sin is sloth

Seeds of hate, you plant and grow
It seals you fate, in time you'll know
Grapes of wrath will rot
Know who you are, who you're not
