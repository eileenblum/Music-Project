[Nielsen, Mathiesen, Lundemark]

In your life, all you wanted
Was the making of the right choices
A good life preserved
But you lack the strength to overcome yourself
Life is a battle, yours is a war

[Lead: Mathiesen]

What made you this pathetic kind
The kind I can only despise, cannot pity cause you lack
Good qualities, human kindness
There's nowhere for you to turn
You are the lowest, the worst of human kind

An addict, a misfit
White thrash piece of shit
Your life at it's best is misery
You've lost your integrity
Was never meant to be
Your life at it's best is misery

[Lead: Mathiesen]

When our paths cross you disgust me
Could never be lead into your temptation
That everhunger
Everhunger, like a vampire
You suck the lifeblood of your dear ones
You're the worst of human kind

An addict, a misfit
White trash piece of shit
Your life at its best is misery
You've lost your integrity
Was never meant to be
Your life at its best is misery+
