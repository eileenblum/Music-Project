[Lundemark]

My mind can't break free
My soul can't be released
Those scars remain, those fears restrain
Those feelings maimed, my soul is stained
My soul is unfreed, the fears return
Taught nil by life, my soul will burn

Take a life to save my own
Suck the marrow from the broken bone
Spit it out, who's left to bleed
Suck it in, you need to feed

My mind needs control
My life is not my own
Hatred is what I sow
Hatred is what I grow

[Lead: Mathiesen]

There's one cure for my disease
The cure is a 12 gauge shotgun

Take a life to save my own
Suck the marrow from the broken bone
Spit it out, who's left to bleed
Suck it in, - (you need to feed)
