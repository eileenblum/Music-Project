[Lundemark]

Into the mouth of the devil you walk
Like a lamb to the slaughter
Terrorized, you are afraid
Of the demonic laughter
The spirits of the dead keep
Watch of the impounding disaster
Terrorized, you are afraid
- It's the...

Day of the dog
The devil flies in the threatening sky
Day of the dog
Demonic laughter as they crumble and fall
Day of the dog
Watchfull eyes seek a throat to slit
Day of the dog
Your ways won't fit

[Lead: Lundemark]

Out from the pits of hell they fly
To torch the sky
Unified in death and faith
Hatemongers
So spill out blood, and earn your vengeance
Swift and painful
Unified in death and faith

Day of the dog
The devil flies the threatening sky
Day of the dog
Demonic laughter as they crumble and fall
Day of the dog
Watchful eyes seek the throat to slit
Day of the dog
Your ways won't fit

Some said the final days

[Lead: Lundemark]
[Lead: Mathiesen]

Day of the dog
The devil flies the threatening sky
Day of the dog
Demonic laughter as they crumble and fall
Day of the dog
Watchful eyes seek the throat to slit
Day of the dog
Your ways won't fit

[Background lead: Lundemark]

Loss for words the deathtoll counting
Everyone out west is frowning
The vengeance is a mighty roar
Won't fix or heal or feed the poor

Feed the poor

The damaging is done, it's begun
The siege of power, subjects to cower
The conflict to spread, count the dead
Reverse the threat with bucket's of lead
Feed the rich, unfertile bitch
With blood of the poor, who is no more
Violence to spread, count the dead
Arising threat, untimely death
