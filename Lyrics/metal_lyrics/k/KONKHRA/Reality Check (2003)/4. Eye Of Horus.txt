[Lundemark]

I am the chosen one
God's one and only son
I rule, you obey
The might of Ra, now hear what I say

Your master is calling
The prophets have spoken
Your kingdom is falling
The spell will be broken

I saw it in a beast, I saw it in a sacrifice
God will cut the veins that carry life
In time your cities fall
Your crusted land can't feed you all
Scores to die by famine, I close my eyes

Power of tyranny
Devours your legacy
The sun has sealed your fate
The might of Ra, you heard what they said:
Your master is calling
The prophets have spoken
Your kingdom is falling
The spell will be broken

I saw it in a beast, I saw it in a sacrifice
God will cut the veins that carry life
In time your cities fall
Your crusted land can't feed you all
Scores to die by famine, I close my eyes

Sands will drown
The water will not return
Hunger will strike
No strength left to earth the dead
Sands will drown
Reminiscence of your crown
They will show
The remains will be all we know
