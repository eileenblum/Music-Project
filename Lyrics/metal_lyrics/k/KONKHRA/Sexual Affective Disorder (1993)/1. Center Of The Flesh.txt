Wait for the opening of my life
Yours in streams from my shadow self
Tragedy
Fallen worlds
Tragedy
Lost
Children driven from roots beyond imagination
Yours to come

I hope you will carry the burden
For those I could not reach
Come sit on my knee feel my fists
The disaster of my life

You must know it's not you to blame
Out there I'm nothing here you fear me
Fell my fists your eyes so hateful
Your small hands
I see them in dreams
Protecting what is left

I don't deserve to live
Come sit on my knee
Your eyes so faithful
