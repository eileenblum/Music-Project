As always the seasons have turned
And winter grasps the northern world
Might of darkness cease the day
The light of life - driven away

Dust is what is left of blossoms in the spring
Let the winter begin

How can I face this
Reflection of me
My own flesh and blood
So dislike me
Father - I am of you
But yet so fresh
Sprung of this world
Another world

Black milk of dawn I drink you
In the night of dark embrace
At dawn and dusk at all times
'till all my beloved are defaced

This light of dawn I cease it
From my dark life enhanced
The sorrow of another world
In past winter it's engulfed

Dust is what is left of blossoms in the spring
Let the winter begin

How can I face the reflection of me
My own flesh and blood so dislike me
Father
Inherited
Indestructive bonds
Parallel carnations
Take us on
Throughout all time
Travelling

But you
You're inside of me
And I see your history
Condemns me
