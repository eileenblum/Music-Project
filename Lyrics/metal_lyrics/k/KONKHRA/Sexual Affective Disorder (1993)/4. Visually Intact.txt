I despise you
Yet I can't live without you
Makes me feel like a man
You
Visually intact

Lecherous
And lushful
Pleasurous
And despised

I see the curves
Like a river of lust
Heating me on
Visually intact
The only thing you've got
Otherwise you would fade away

I'm discovering a desire
Letting go
Still you are a person
Not unlike me
Different point of views
Yet unlike me

I want the lecherous acts to rule
Not your verbal skills
Flooding nowhere
You want to live through me
I in you
