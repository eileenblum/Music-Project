In these times of fear
The gods have lost their faith
And man stands alone
The bonds which connect eachother are cut in two

Another place
Another dimension
The destination of maturing

Is it the common sense
That is presented
Or pure instinct
The chemistry of liquid black and white

Forgetting the primates
The relatives we have denied
We are no more or less
Two sexes to secure the race

Two abdominals
Driven by a lower instinct
The smell of sweat
Body liquid we so quivering inject

Wanting the world
Achieving nothing but black
The blindfoldness you consume

When the stains
That contaminated
Your thoughts
Is sprayed away
You can return
To your shell
With a clean mind

You're blind but I can see
Your helpless thoughts and misery
Your blindfolded eyes conceal
A distorted harmony
