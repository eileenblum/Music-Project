As I die
I see the world in blossom
Released from it parasites
Reach the end again
A cyclus neverending

Mankind has to fall
And it will again and again
Can't you taste the poison
The bitterness in your mouth
Interference blame

Act of stupidity
At the end there will be
Chaos to climb

As I live
People cross eachother
Being civilized
Repress their instincts
Scared of their own smell

Life goes on
Same old habit
Afraid of any change
Small talk of people
Serving boundless depths

Wish you were able to see
To see through my eyes
Wish we dreams together
In dreams all things can be
