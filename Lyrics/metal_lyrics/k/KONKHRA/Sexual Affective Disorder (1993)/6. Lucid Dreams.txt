This dream is taking me
Far beyond imagined
In it I exist
As a shadow of myself

Small reflections of my past
Display themselves to me
My life before mine to control
Now cybernetics fusioned my being

My soul is in a machine
Help me to breathe

Before my eyes my face
Before my dreams began
I see my face and I am smiling
These lucid dreams are terrifying
