It's a real speacial way of achieving
I cannot quite confirm
Horrid twists in your ways of arranging
Well see what you'll get in return

I am feeling
Something I neved needed
Horrid way to twist the truth
Bond of mine
Suffered

I am not content with your excuses
Pathetic and useless matching your intrusion
I can feel patience dying in me
Very soon to beyond my verge
Bond of mine
Broken

Patience is dying in me
Believe me
It can't be reserved
Boiling inside me it's breeding
Growing
I have to expose
Patience is dying in me
It can't be reserved

Fragments of the dying art
Aggression released
Fragments of the dying art
Patience deceased
