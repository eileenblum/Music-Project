The day has passed like nothing's done
The sleepwalk of the awake, nothing's wrong
I see things happening right in front of me
I live to see, I live to taste
The waste of things you break

Like nothing's wrong

I can always find you, we are not equal you see
I can always find you where ever you may be
Because I want to touch you
Caress your twisted mind
To take you through the dark forest
Trees whisper of wiser generations

Listen to the silence
Don't ride failure or success
Ride the storms that rush in your head

The flames from your darkened eyes
I want to touch you
Caress your twisted mind

Leather you stretch on your face
Shows the feeling you have inside
Don't get me wrong, leather is nice and smooth
But it will crumble in time, not in time
Too late

Like nothing's wrong

I can always find you, we are not equal you see
I can always find you where ever you may be
Because I want to touch you
Caress your twisted mind
To take you through the dark forest
Trees whisper of wiser generations
