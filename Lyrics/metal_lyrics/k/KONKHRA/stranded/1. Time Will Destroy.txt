Death, the threatening black
Has won a space in our hearts
By the law of infinite fear
It kills beauty and joy
It shouldn't but it does when we let in
In the depths of our souls we confess the sin

Yes... no...

No, the denial of what is lost
Yes, when you value the cost

Time will destroy
To the grasp of breath
Darkened and grey
The wrinkled hands betray

Time of pleasure
For scorn and deceived
Who were forced to their knees
Pleasure when souls are released
Where the world end... the world begins

When all battles swallowing fire
Repeats its place upon earth anger
Fury burning desire
It makes you worthy of pain
Hatred... hatred...
Life... death...

It is when you try to drown your soul
That she sparkles the most

Time of pleasure
For scorn and deceived
Who were forced to their knees
Pleasure when souls are released

Listen to the sound
They call from beyond
Our souls leave the ground
The unknown has begun
To reveal its secrets
Soon we will see
Realise mortality
In the depths of infinity
March down the line of existence

One by one into the depths we fall
Even when we see our lives expire
March, march, march down the line of existence

If you dare to break the silence
If you speak your name aloud
If your standard bows against the winds
You will be swallowed by the crowd

Hatred... hatred
White... black...

Which is mirror to your own deep down
Which is worn as disguise

Time will destroy
To the grasp of breath
Darkened and grey

Time of pleasure
For scorn and deceived
Who were forced to their knees
Pleasure when souls are released

Where the world ends... silence begins
