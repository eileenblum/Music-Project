Pain can eduacte you 
Make you breathe a certain way 
Make you sense life 
Make you sense life 

So when the needle penetrates 
And leaves the mark behind 
It's the only thing aside from scars 
On my body you'll find 

Those memories from my past 
Things I've dealt with before 
It's just my way to make them last 
My skin is my own epitaph 

And in the future 
Always cherish that day 
When I set it all straight 
And learned to breathe a certain way 

Hate can make you numb 
It can eat out your soul 
It'll kill you, it'll kill you 
So when you feel that hatred inside 
It's time for a new direction 
And I'm not talking religion here 
A silimar infection 

I'm talking, talking about you 
I'm talking about your new tattoo 

Those memories from my past 
Things I've dealt with before 
It's just my way to make them last 
My skin is my own epitaph 

And in the future 
Always cherish that day 
When I set it all straight 
And learned to breathe a certain way
