I don't know what you know 
I don't see what you see 
I don't hear what you hear 
And if I do, I don't believe 
And I don't go where you've gone 
I just try to stay free 

Blessed we are, all under the sun 
Blessed we are, to be free 
But cursed we are, weakened followers 
Cursed we are, if we don't believe 

I don't feel what you feel 
I don't moan when you moan 
I don't like what you like 
If you think I do, it's make-believe 
I don't trust what you trust 
I've pissed all that down the drain 

Blessed we are, all under the sun 
Blessed we are, to be free 
But cursed we are, weakened followers 
Cursed we are, if we don't believe 

Blessed we are, all under the sun 
Blessed we are, to be free 

Blessed we are, all under the sun 
Blessed we are, to be free 
But cursed we are, weakened followers 
Cursed we are, if we don't believe
