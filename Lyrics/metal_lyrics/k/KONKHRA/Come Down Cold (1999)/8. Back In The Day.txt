It took so long to see 
To learn to believe 
And I know you're hurting 
I know how it feels 
To cut yourself from the other world 
Be relieved of your strings 
It's just heartbreaking 
It's so mindeating 

But was it worth it? 
Just tell me what you think 
Burn inside forevermore 
You have to move on now 

But remember the past 
Just cherish what it taught you 
Make those memories last 
Let them in, let them in to haunt you 

But was it worth it? 
Just tell me what you think 
Burn inside forevermore 
You have to move on now 

Just let it grow within you 
Just let it inside 
In time you'll know that 
It was the best for you 

But remember the past 
Just cherish what it taught you 
Just make those memories last 
Let them in, let them in to haunt you
