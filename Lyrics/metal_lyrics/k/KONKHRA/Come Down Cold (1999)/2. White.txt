This is the white man's saviour 
Technology our vain 
We have the world to prey on 
And we keep it that way 
Although you've learned to swallow 
You'd rather spit 
You've learned my world is hollow 
And full of shit 

I've gagged the western world 
Enslaved all the rest 
I make the rules in here 
The whole world to the test 
I steal your riches 
I rake your land 
Cause all that is of weapons 
Are in my command 

Snake eyes, white lies 
The Painstaking, the painstaking truth 
I've no mans shame 
This world, this world I'll tame 

This white hypocrisy 
The whole world's enemy
