So what if it's 1999 
I've sworn that life should be all mine 
And so I sold my soul 
To achive that one and only goal 
And see those empty eyes 
Just people expecting compassion 
For their cries 
Just the cattle in an endless stream 
Expect to be heard above the screams 

To bleed again 
To cry again 
To bleed again 
To bleed again 
To cry again 
To bleed again 

And see those empty eyes 
And then just realized 
How the unjust defies 
Their own godgiven lives 

And so you'll bleed again 
And so you'll bleed again 

You say they will save you 
I say they'll rather kill you 
And then not have to reed 
The offspring you breed 
Cause there is no god 
There is not one to trust 
And if that's what you believed 
How clearly you've been decieved 
How clearly have you been decieved 

And see those empty eyes 
And then just realized 
How the unjust defies 
Their own godgiven lives 

And see those empty eyes 
And then just realized 
How the unjust defies 
Their own godgiven lives
