How we love 
To measure things 
How we see 
Ourselves supreme 
How we live 
Pathetic lives 
And make sure 
Our offspring thrives 

When facts are faced 
For the human race 
You will see 
There is nothing we can change 

Life is fragile 
Life is fragile 
Life is fragile 
Life is fragile 

I do think 
That if the planet was alive 
Not just lived on 
But with a pulse inside 
She wouldn't care 
Or even know 
How we all got to be so fucking low 

When facts are faced 
For the human race 
You will see 
There is nothing we can change, no 

Life...
