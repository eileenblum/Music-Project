(A lot of people out there already dead, 
just need to be put out of their misery) 

All the stiches in the world can't sew me up 
All the love in this world is lost to me 
All the prayers on earth won't do the trick 
All the power from above can't help me 

I take lives cause that's what I do 
I pulled the trigger on everyone but you 
And now you're here with my gun to your head 
And all the powers from above can't help you 

You're lost, you're lost to the world 
You've crossed that line, you've gone too far 
You're lost, you're lost to the world 
You've crossed that line, you've gone too far 

We both know, now is the time 
You will to pay this price for your crime 
I let it out to tear a hole in you 
And let you life run through 
Bumbfound, bound and gagged you are 
Alone with me, alone is what you are 
Can't you see, how it got so far 
And all the power from above 
Is in my hands 

You're lost, you're lost to the world 
You've crossed that line, you've gone too far 
You're lost, you're lost to the world 
You've crossed that line, you've gone too far
