I see myself through my enemy's eyes 
I see exactly what it is he despise 
I see he thinks it's a matter of size 
And to me, that's no fucking surprise 

I feel the world with my enemy's senses 
I stare with hatred through his eyes' lenses 
I hate it all, all that I see 
I think it's all out to get just me 
I try to love but it's hatred I feel 
This damn pain is just so damn real 
And this is when I feel sad 
I see my enemy just ain't so bad 

Divide and conquer 
Divide and conquer the world 
Divide and conquer 
Divide and conquer 
Divide and conquer the world 
Divide and conquer 

I let the my enemy see himself through me 
I let him in to make him feel free 
Let him see his misconception of me 
Let him see the fool he is 

I feel the world with my enemy's senses 
I stare with hatred through his eyes' lenses 
I hate it all, all that I see 
I think it's all out to get just me 
I try to love but it's hatred I feel 
This damn pain is just so damn real 
And this is when I feel sad 
I see my enemy just ain't so bad 

Divide and conquer 
Divide and conquer the world 
Divide and conquer 
Divide and conquer 
Divide and conquer the world 
Divide and conquer 

I feel the world with my enemy's senses 
I stare with hatred through his eyes' lenses 
I hate it all, all that I see 
I think it's all out to get just me 
I try to love but it's hatred I feel 
This damn pain is just so damn real 
And this is when I feel sad 
I see my enemy just ain't so bad 

Divide and conquer 
Divide and conquer the world 
Divide and conquer 
Divide and conquer 
Divide and conquer the world 
Divide and conquer
