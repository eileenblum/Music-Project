Desire
Boils in me, I feel the urge, under my skin
It runs in my blood
It's taking me, I give in to my drives, I set it free
My spirit of splendour come to me.

For my life i have ceased
Taken back wife to be
My love spirit of me
All sense to me, lost life ceased.

Power in me, will be of me
And of my life
As supposed to be
Pain makes free, release me
From my life desire.
Come to me, child, come to me
For I am your host
Breathe what i breathe, taste what I taste
Drink of me, eat my flesh, swallow me and posses me
You can take my life as yours for keeps

[Lead Anders]

Once layed your hands on me, touch of death
I pay with life, and through death I am alive
The price i pay is of cheapest
And love is forgotten to me
I swear myself to be free

Lay down with me again
Let me suck you again
Drink your blood, drink your youth, absorb you
Into me what you are
How soon I feel like exploding
Burst into life, into my precious.

Power will flow into you
Become your life
As meant to be
Pain makes free, release me
From my life desire.
