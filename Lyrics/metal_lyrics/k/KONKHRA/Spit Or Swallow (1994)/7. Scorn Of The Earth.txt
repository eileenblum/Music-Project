It's a sick sect of God, depraved moral laws
Praying to a God corrupt, stealing from your life
To one priest you must obey, betrayal is to die
His words are the words of God, commence suicide.

Damnation is called upon you, if you speak the truth
His disciples cover the earth, praying for death
Folding hands, knelling in prayer, call upon the lord
Take the lives of unworthy ones, our God of revenge.

Headhunter, he's twisting the words, speaker of lies
Salvation, scorn of the earth, unity is power
He is the one, closest to God, he'll save your soul
Shepherd he is, for the molten ones, weaker in mind.

This song scorns religion, I spit in their face
Although often said before, I say it again
You must find your God inside, spirit of life
Just pity those weak fucks, stay out of my life.

"Forgive them... They know not what they do" [StLUKE: 23,34]
