I am of those who breathe death to my lungs
I only live to deteriorate and die
I serve me, myself, my own
I will not take advice for my life.

Misery, come walk with me
Be my life's companion
Starve me, shrink me
Drain me of life.

Hollow, I wish to die.
Hollow, I wish to die.

I am not preaching, I just describe my life
Imagine what it's like to live like me
I live on lies, make believe, desertfacts
I even lie to me and believe myself.

Dawn, I can see needle on my course
Fighting is useless, easier to die
I heat it up, sense no amounts
Keep no track of trace or time.

The needle is my fiend, it takes me away.
The needle is my fiend, it takes me away.

Misery, come walk with me
Be my life's companion
Starve me, shrink me, drain me of life,
Misery, you are my only friend
Misery, please take my life
Bring me down again.
