It all went wrong form the start
I tried hard but agony took me
I spend my life building up
As mischief is brewed from my heartblood
Those precious drops we need for survival
In hours of grief, taken from us
Lost our youth, toil for lifes worth
Lost our minds, searching for something.

Come be my saviour
Give my life worth
Please turn back time
Facelift

[Lead Kim]

Misadventure, life is a whore
I fucked her once but she fucked me twice
And i know, yes i know, there's no way
No way to get even.

[Lead Anders]

And I learned nothing this time around
Spent all of my time in the past
And I know, I will fall
As ignorant as the day I was born
Those precious drops, need for survival
In hours of grief, taken from us
Lost our youth, toil for lifes worth
Lost our minds, searching for lost times.

With my life on the line
Taking all I could grasp
Take down all that I could
Wasting all of me
