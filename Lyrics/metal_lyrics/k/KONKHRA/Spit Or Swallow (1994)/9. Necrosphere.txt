Gaze upon the ozon layer
This shield we laid to rest
As we worship only our Gods
The current and the rent
Who is to blame
Your blame, your neighbour
But you must know
Some day we loose the earth

Walk the earth
Walk the earth

Mankind who strive towards the stars
Challenge the Gods
But you must know
They laugh at you
We step upon our mother
And she is pissed
She's fed up with all the crap
We spilt on her

[Lead Anders/Kim]

We must face the earth
Mighty opponent
Global warming, the planet in falmes
And apparently the seas are dead
And you must know that the population grows
Walk the earth with respect.
Walk the earth
Walk the earth
