It all went wrong from the start
I tried hard but agony took me
Spent my life building up
As mischief is brewed from my heartblood
Those precious drops, we need for survival
In hours of greed, taken from us
Lost our youth, toil for life's worth
Lost our minds, searching for something

Come be my saviour
Give my worth
Please turn back time
Facelift (many times)

Misadventure, life is a whore
I fucked her once, but she fucked me twice
And I know, yes I know
There's no way, no way to get even

And I learned nothing this time around
Spent all of my life in the past
And I know, I will fall
As ignorant as the day I was born
Those precious drops need for survival
In hours of greed, taken from us
Lost our youth, toil for life's worth
Lost our minds, searching for lost times

With my life on the line
Taking all I could grasp
Take down all that I could
Wasting all of me
