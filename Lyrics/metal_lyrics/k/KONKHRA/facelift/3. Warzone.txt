War can take the best of a man
Age him thousand years in a week
Remember how many lifes were taken
How snipers took of the kids

Opening of Auschwitz
The final days of the war
Witness the unspeakable
The stench that hung in the air

Empowered from above
Authorized to kill
The disguised rote kreuz people
Are officers of the SS

Hand to hand with the devil
The blood springs from the teeth
And how few days pass by
To build a century
