[Lundemark]

I feel down as ever
my mind has spun astray
black rays beaming through my head
innards burned away
tears fall frozen from my eyes
that's how cold I am
stiffened finger on my trigger
my temple I would ram

Burning bullet speeding high
rip apart my mind
never think such thoughts again
one less of my kind

Heaven send angels to fall
clearest, darkest void of all
become all I wanted to be
Heaven send angels to me

In my heart the stones are cold
essential to the wall that is me
both mind and soul are locked
on life without end
mind like a machinegun
body like a trigger
if you come too close to me
my blood and yours shall mingle

Heaven send angels to fall
clearest, darkest void of all
become all I wanted to be
Heaven send angels to me
