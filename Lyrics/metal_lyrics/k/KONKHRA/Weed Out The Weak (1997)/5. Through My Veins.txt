[Lundemark]

Your body the temple
that I will possess
dead-like but sprung into life
in your cells can live
spell your death with a whispered word
coming to you from another world
my form and shape
redefined you'll be like me

Redefined - through my veins runs life-divine
Redefined - through my veins runs life-divine
Redefined - through my veins runs life-divine
Redefined - through my veins runs life-divine

I am no one
I threaten all without prejudice
my sole purpose is to eat
your life-divine
I will not begone
yet begun, cannot save your breath
hold it down, then exhale
last sifting noise, as you pale

Redefined - through my veins runs life-divine
Redefined - through my veins runs life-divine
Redefined - through my veins runs life-divine
Redefined - through my veins runs life-divine
