Reckoning
Reckoning
Reckoning...

I can't forget about the past
who was our redeemer
truth, that I thought I found at last
but truth became deceiver
tried so hard to better myself
my soul, my hearts contributor
so many times before my life was worse
today I am my keeper

In time we'll see our enemy
show us his strength and his weaknesses
power befall us, or he will crush us
as we travel through the ages
writing historys pages

I am the link between the future and the past
my ancestors blood in me
my blood in my children
all their powers derive from me, their future in my hands
these are the words of the watcher
these are the ways that befall us

Past and present revealed
the future concealed
but readable to the wise ones
incomprehendable to the common sons
time tells all tales

This book, teller of stories, our lives on display
the way we were, may be the way to be
our future is nothing but our past repeated
tomorrow is today, when yesterday was this day
