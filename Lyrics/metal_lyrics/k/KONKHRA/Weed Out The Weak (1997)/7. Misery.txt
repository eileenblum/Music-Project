[Kontos/Lundemark]

Your face reflects what you are thinking
smiling face, flashing eyes
but all they really are
two holes of extinguished life

You can't fool me
You can fool no one but yourself

At night under the blankets
those feelings will return
what is coming
what will happen while you sleep
what if you never wake again

The sunrays to your window
and you're awakened by the light
take a deep breath of life
and taste the morning air
knowing the day has followed the night

What a grand day
to again accomplish nothing
on this evening of your life decided
to live is just to die

At night under the blankets
those feelings will return
what is coming
what will happen while you sleep
what if you never wake again
