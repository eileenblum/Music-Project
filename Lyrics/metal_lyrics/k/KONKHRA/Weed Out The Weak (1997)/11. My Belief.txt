[Lundemark/Murphy]

What is my belief you ask
stare at me with hollow eyes
but I won't even start to shiver
Think
How I look through empty eyes
you can see that I don't care
I give a fuck about direction
choice of faith and common lives
other lives
their concern not mine - not mine!

So what if thousands die this minute
as long as I don't go down that way
so what if armies trample millions
my army is my mind
ever cold, ever careless
never tempted by defeats
fuck you, fuck this and fuck that too
there's nothing I can do for you

My Belief
My Belief
My Belief
