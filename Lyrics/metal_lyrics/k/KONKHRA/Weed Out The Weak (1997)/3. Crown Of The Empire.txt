[Lundemark]

The Crown Of The Empire
to achieve they conspire
shackeling the righteous one
the fallen king's infant son
gone to the holy land
to kill the ungodly man
presumed to be dead
so the Traitor mounts the throne instead

Unholy
Rape and Sacrifice
Return to my God
with Tears in my Eyes
Unholy
Rape and Sacrifice
Return to my God
with Tears in my Eyes

In the white tower
the children are waiting
each sound freezing their blood
they know what's acoming
a true bloodline
beckons their fate
the royalty in their veins
will die in their wake

Unholy
Rape and Sacrifice
Return to my God
with Tears in my Eyes
Unholy
Rape and Sacrifice
Return to my God
with Tears in my Eyes
