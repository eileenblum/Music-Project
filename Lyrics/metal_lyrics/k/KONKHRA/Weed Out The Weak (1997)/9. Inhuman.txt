[Kontos/Lundemark]

Through the dark our eyes of night
scan the woods for those misfortuned
know this our eyes are on you
we come your way
fall prey on your knees and bleeding
knowing this as life is sifting
death swift, impaling
we came your way

We are the last ones on earth
fewer than these
as time is passing on us
never roam free

Eyes gleaming, fangs flashing
our kind are swarms at night
know this, our eyes are on you
we come your way
so thirsty and so hungry
abide with just one law
eat, fuck and then
we eat some more

We are the last ones on earth
fewer than these
as time is passing on us
never roam free

So at the gates of hell
fear in your heart of seeing
knowing our eyes are on you
we come your way
wish all your life unto me
you want to be like me
hate, in your eyes it burns
now you know

I am god of my own world
I am god of my own world
and my patience is gone
