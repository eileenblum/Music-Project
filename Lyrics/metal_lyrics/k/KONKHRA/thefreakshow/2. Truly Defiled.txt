It's time for the seven o'clock show
They can tell all we need to know
Fresh footage from another war
Much bloodier than what we've seen before, before

There are people who've seen worse
They were present where the devil cursed
Their camera the all seeing eye
Let the world know the truly defiled

The truly
The truly defiled
The truly
The truly defiled

Back at home we see the show
But nothing more than they want us to know
It's the edited truth of war
Entertain and restrain me some more, some more

There are people who've seen more
Seen the grinding teeth of war
Fed their children to the warmachine
And done things you wouldn't believe

They are
The truly
The truly defiled
They're the truly
The truly defiled

But they don't know
Who the fuckruns the show
The same who are building the weapons
Own broadcasts for warring reasons
But they don't know
CNN runs the show
The same who are building the weapons
Own broadcasts for warring reasons
They sell, they sell, they sell, they sell,
They sell, they sell, they sell, they sell, the war

They sell, they sell, they sell, they sell the war
The war, the war, the war, the war, the war

There are people who've seen worse
They were present where the devil cursed
Their camera the all seeing eye
Let the world know the truly defiled

The truly
The truly defiled
The truly
The truly defiled
