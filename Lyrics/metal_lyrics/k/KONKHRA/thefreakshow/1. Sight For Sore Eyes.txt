I'm a sight for sore eyes
You can tell how I feel
If you try to save me
You'll know it's for real

I flushed it all down the drain
For a real kind of low
And I know the highway
Taught me all I wanted top know

You say I'm just a dog
And I won't argue on that
I kinda like them furry beings
At least they know where joy is at

You say I'm not human
That too I can't deny
To me the entire human race
Are rats in disguise

A sight for sore eyes

But I made something of myself
I can stay in the open
Never told a lie twice
To me that's a real token

So when it's time to say goodbye
And travel beyond
I'll wear my happy face
So you remember me when I'm gone

A sight for sore eyes
A sight for sore eyes
A sight for sore eyes
