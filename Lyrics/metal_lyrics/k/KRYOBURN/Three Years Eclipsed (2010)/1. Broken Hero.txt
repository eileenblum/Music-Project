You've been

[Chorus:]
Torn away
With every breath I seem to fade away
Reliving failed attempts of yesterday
This madness darkening the faith in myself

Chasing the grave just to see if it's real
Don't break the seal
Tearing away from the way from the ones that you love
So far above
Using the pain as another excuse
For more abuse
I won't listen to your lies
I'll decide this Hell
Demons rise
Deceiving pleasure leaves destruction and death
A dying breath
Breaking the mind hiding all that is real
It's hard to feel

Filled with suffering there's no chance for you to escape
Cast down all your doubts you know where you are now
Losing hope

You've been

[Chorus]

I ask you one more time if this is the life you wanted

[Chorus]

I ask you one more time if this is the life you wanted
I ask you one more time if this is the life you want

Living as prey to disease that kills
Losing your will
Longing the day where there's nothing to lose
No one to use
You can't save me from myself
It's up to me
Destruction feeds on the mind that is blind
So far behind

Filled with suffering there's no chance for you to escape
Cast down all your doubts you know where you are now

Falling down, falling deeper
Falling down, falling deeper down

I can't deny
You've been deceived
I've lost my hold
Forever torn away

I ask you one more time if this is the life you wanted

[Chorus]

I ask you one more time if this is the life you wanted
I ask you one more time if this is the life you want.
