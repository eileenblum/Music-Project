welcome you are to this world of deceit
locked in addiction that makes you complete
descending deception upon you all
tortured with pleasure left only to fail

vision of ecstasy a painful delight
failed again was your last attempt to make everything right
longing for the one thing that will set you free
only deceived again by false security

two pieces
i have become
two pieces

i lost myself into the darkness
where am i when i have felt this
pain

unending eternal nightmare dismay
in this,the darkness it pulls you away
control the end ! control all !
looking back watching your dreams dissolve

two pieces
i have become
two pieces

i lost myself into the darkness
where am i when i have felt this
pain

fuck off
you give your demons to me
and i take them from you
your pain is washed away
your life is taken from you
fuck off
