feeding this rage light meets its end
heaven shall speak to the ignored once again
all is not lost when nothing can be
time distortion leaves impurity

consciousness is only a dream
endless decay of eternal beam
all speak of life this speaks of death
craving the end and your last breath

on our way down we are forced down
not stopping now we are forced down

endlessly transcending ...

on our way down we are forced down
not stopping now we are forced down
