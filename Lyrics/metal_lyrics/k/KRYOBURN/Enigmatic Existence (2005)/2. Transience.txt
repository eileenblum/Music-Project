scarring disgrace shame fill all of my being
i cant escape the words you left me bleeding
revealing all from another place in time
our lives collide mortality leaves us

close your eyes
for the last 
no more lies
for the last
time..

psychotic rages burns in and pumps through my veins
destroying hope i guess that i'm to blame
revealing all from another place in time
our lives collide mortality leaves us
close your eyes
for the last 
no more lies
for the last
time..
through it all your realize
its all-meaningless in this life
beating pleading sending your life
to eternal rest
eternal rest
