judgment comes
with no escape
we lay them down
this hellish day

lose all after time
you thats always been
embrace your existence
name is now nothing

to see is not to believe you exist
closer to becoming more than myself

self dead

who am i ?
and what is this
embrace the lie
could this be it ?

lose all after time
you thats always been
embrace your existence
name is now nothing

to see is not to believe you exist
closer to becoming more than myself

self dead
we die to self we start to live
living life than our self
