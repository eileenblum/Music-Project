darkness killing the light now
no perception of life
chest tight cant breathe cant move
living in this personal fight

control let it go get thought
is it real is it fake do i die ?
get advice take pills sit still
living proof its all bullshit lie...

looking back i wonder how
i went this far into my head
forcing me to feel this now
wonder if im better off dead

chemical propaganda
making money off our strain
find the answers within
alone by myself and with out ...pain

fall...
against my self ...theres something else
i fall away ...

years have gone by 
friends have passed away
but we remain
here for the pain
locked inside of me
i am never free
