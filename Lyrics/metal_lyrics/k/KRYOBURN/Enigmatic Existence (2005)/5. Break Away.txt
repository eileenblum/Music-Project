i've spent all my life
demons inside sending to the grave
hopelessly lost out of control
how can i ever be saved
forced to live in pain never wanted
i never asked for this
longing inside always alive
yet closer to the dead

forced into locked for life
i live inside this lifetime
never wanted never asked for
never wanted to breathe and feel all of this pain

im breaking away
you have nothing to say
im breaking away
from you...

death pain rage and hate
giving me strength speaking to me inside
i fall away never again will i see the light
burning my eyes haunting my thoughts
gripping my soul with fear
under my skin blood running thin
weakness has taken hold

forced into locked for life
i live inside this lifetime
never wanted to breathe and feel all of this pain

im breaking away
you have nothing to say
im breaking away
from you...
the moment approaching to detach my self
from all of life's uncertainties
to find a truth for my self
in every point of time

break away...
separate,break it away
break it away from me
