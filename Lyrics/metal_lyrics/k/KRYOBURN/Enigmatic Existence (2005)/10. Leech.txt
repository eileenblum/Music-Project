i will never be what you saw in me

tell your lies now
i'm the one you hate
that i beat you down
you dont decide my fate
forced into your game
you suffocate me
hide your nameless shame
why wont you ever let it be ?

long i await
to feel your pain

i was never what you thought i was

no one will ever know
the lie you told her
keep it in your heart
and never show her
the truth inside
you know you caused me
a pain to hide
why wont you ever set me free ?
move on
forget the past
move on nothing ever lasts

and you still want me dead...
