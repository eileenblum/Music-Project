shades of orange light fill the sky
procyon 77 sets upon the soul
walking on the path of rotting corpse
i push on
take the shame from me now

sun sets in a pool of blood
light is gone
cold and dark start to fill the soul
9000 souls marching on eternal
take the blame from me now

bring to an end
the silent wait

take the shame away from me
the blame away from me
the pain away from me
there are no answers now
the shame away from me
the blame away from me
the pain away from me
there are no answers now

final destinations draws near
time is gone
all i've ever had to show for
i've become the path that i marched on
release me
take the pain from me ow
bring to an end
the silent wait
bring to an end
the silent wait

take the shame away from me
the blame away from me
the pain away from me
there are no answers now
the shame away from me
the blame away from me
the pain away from me
there are no answers now
