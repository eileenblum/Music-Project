fall - take this time away
dead - erase the memory
fall - transcend this in me
dead - not alone

we all connect within
a human common ground
it all embraces us
we never,we never cease to be
no death it all begins
into a realm within
it all embraces us
we never,we never say good-bye

no space or time within
a realm inside i breathe again
self and demise is gone
i am no more and never from

dead and gone my life subsides
into a realm of eternal cries
freezing dark my world dies

freezing dark my world dies
as my hand grasps our fatal lie
no space or time all is gone
to witness it is all or none
all or nothing two paths must choose
nothing more than a soul to lose
