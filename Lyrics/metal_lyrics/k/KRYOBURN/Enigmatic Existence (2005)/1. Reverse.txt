conceived in fit of passion had no choice but to take my first breath
unjust never asked for never wanted,never wanted to live
fallen far away from innocents that i had as a child
blood pumps heart heart is racing uncontrollably i expect to die

thoughts raped
amplifies my fears
thoughts raped
you were never here

i feel it vibrating below the surface of reality
transcend manifesting haunts and fears through and across the void

bleed from
eternal wounds of torment
bleed from 
eternal wounds of judgment

i'm broken into pieces bloodshot eyes stare through and into black
in this box of darkness dreams are nightmares i am full of rage

thoughts raped
amplifies my fears
thoughts raped
you were never here
so long, to the end we all come from
say goodbye,say its over
to the life that we've always known
i'm left all alone..
fly away from this pain you've always known

i cant see past tomorrow past the darkness with my life in tact
demons fucked addictions broken promise leads me to death

bleed from
eternal wounds of torment
bleed from 
eternal wounds of judgment
to the end we all come from
say goodbye,say its over i'm left all alone
fly away from this pain you've always known

i've fallen deeper into the abyss
further than i care to go
no hope no return
all i have is nothing

conclusion bringing an end to my life
no reminiscing now
no thoughts no control
all i am is nothing
