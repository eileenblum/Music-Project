Up on the mountain
Up from this dark valley
From treacherous marshlands
To dead barren rock
Up on the mountain
Where fires seen dancing
Where boulders seen rolling
Whole worlds seen unfolding
Too cold the night
Too little sunlight
Curled up dreaming in the moonlight
Hiding in the bog
So steep the hillsides
Surrounding us on all sides
Caught here sinking in the damp night
But we never lost the hope
Never lost the hope
Be glad now survivors
Now the first light of dawn
Lets us dream once again
Dream of immortality
Be glad now survivors
As the mist now dispels
Revealing the plain lands
A world with no end
