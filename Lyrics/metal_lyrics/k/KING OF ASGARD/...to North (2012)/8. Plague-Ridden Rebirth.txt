From the past came the perfect shadow
Passing silent the dead of the night
A shadow of mankind's repentance
Carried by a pestilent wind
Come, come forth.
Come rape the earth
Come once again bring tragedy anew
Come, come now!
Plagueâridden rebirth
Come ride the pestilential wind
Fumes of death hung in the air
In the mist of waters it's crawling
Farwell Earth's bliss and welcome plague
Potent in flesh and potent in blood
Rise, rise my friend.
Rise upon the Earth
Rise shine in splendour.
Grasp the poisoned well
Rise, rise of fiend.
Come preach the end
Come ride the pestilential wind
The hand of darkness came to reap
A murderous breath swept clean
"Bring out your dead, bring out your dead"
A brother in penitent sin
Come ride the wind, come ride the wind
Come walk the earth once more
Come, come forth.
Come rape the Earth
Come once again bring tragedy anew
Come, come now!
Plague-ridden rebirth
Come ride the pestilential wind
From sea to shore horror reveal
Black rats fleas in thousands
A sickness more cruel more savage than war
A pestilence that's foreseen the End
