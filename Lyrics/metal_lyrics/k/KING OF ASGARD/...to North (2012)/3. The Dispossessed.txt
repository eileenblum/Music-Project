Fifteen nights of pouring rain
Night of dull unbearable pain
I move at night and sleep by day
Don't know any other way

I will always be here
They will curse, they will fear
They will wave their torches
And their spears in the night
I will always be here
I will always appear
In rumours and legends
Of greed and betrayal
Retribution and vengeance

I know you count me out for good
But I don't think you understood
I lick my wounds and dare to dream
I curse, I year, I plan and scheme

The fifteenth day, now the night falls
You're safe behind your garden walls
I roam the woods, broken and sad
You took from me the little I had

The sixteenth day I celebrate
The sixteenth day, I seal my fate
To be an out cast, never be
A part of your sick treachery.
