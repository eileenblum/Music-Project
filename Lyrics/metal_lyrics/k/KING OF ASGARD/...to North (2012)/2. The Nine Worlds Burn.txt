Trembling shakes the earth and quakes
Bonds fetter and burst
A shuddering World tree and the absence of light
Decaying roots and waters that loses its glory
Skies split asunder.
None stand above!

Swallowed = the golden sun
and the moon devoured
Soil stained and the sky poisoned
Wolf run free and the Serpent rises from slumber
Scorched and burned the crust of the earth

Hearts of stone
On Vigrids plain
A hallowed land
Hark! Hear! The resounding horn
Carry us home
When we fall
On Vigrids plain
Heimdall! Blow the Giallarhorn

As the stars now tumble from the heavens
and the Watcher sound the horn at last
All will sink beneath the sea
Seen in the fog the ship of dead mens nails
Bring forces of Chaos
All ablaze colliding.
The nine worlds burn!

Hearts of stone
On Vigrids plain
A hallowed land
Hark! Hear! The resounding horn
Carry us home
When we fall
On Vigrids plain
Heimdall! Blow the Giallarhorn

Hearts of stone
On Vigrids plain
A hallowed land
Hark! Hear! The resounding horn
Carry us home
When we fall
On Vigrids plain
Heimdall! Blow the Giallarhorn
