Forstbitten and stained with bloodare the words os peace and loveThe golden cross around your neckspeaks of greed and a crucified wreck All I hear as you preachis blinding fools by threats and leachAll I see in your hands so wiseis our freedom in demise There's death in the eyes of the savior, beware of the praiseThere's blood on the hands of the MessiahSee through the lies of the snake tongue We don't need your false salvationor your threats of God's damnationLeave us be is its peace you needor feel the wrath of northern seed I grasp my hammer of Thorto spite your king of a peasant whoreThe Norse gods is still my creedFor them I live, for them you'll bleed
