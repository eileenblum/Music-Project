darkened clouds in the horizon
thunder rolling in

were marching in to the war zone
vengeance is in the wind

were here to defend our gods
and the realm of the one-eyed king

mighty thunder shakes the ground
as the sky turns blizzard white
we feel our gods is on our side
with Thor and his goats up high

we will never convert our faith
you can never change us with your crusades

with splintered shields and broken swords
we reach our halls where we live as kings
