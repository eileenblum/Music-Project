the way is shut, no chance of entrance
only the brave can open the gate
the gate to this world, the world of the dead
where warriors fight, divine battle

side by side, fight with oden
slaying giants, oh glorious day

blazing swords, flying spears
falling axes, and splintered shields
feel the wrath of the gods

blazing swords, flying spears
falling axes, and splintered shields
feel the wrath of the gods
