as my time is past
and i head for the golden hall
shed me no tears
but remember me in my prime
carve me runes about my fall
in stone to be read for all time

place me in my long ship
with my sword by my side
set it aflame
and greet my funeral pyre
as i drift away with tide
in my farewell framed in fire

Valkyries will come for me
i shall greet their sweet embrace
late fathers await
in the heroes brigade

many were my journeys
plenty died by my hand
yet there's one more journey
one trip I've never made
far from forefathers land
far from my brothers aid

watch the smoke of my burning flesh
rising up to the clear blue sky
turning red by the setting sun
as you raise your horns up high
