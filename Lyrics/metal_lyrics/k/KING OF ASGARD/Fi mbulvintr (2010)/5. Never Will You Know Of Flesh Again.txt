Echoes from the pastExhaled into airWho telleth of secretsThat ages keptScorn the bliss - you'll never possessLive through me - until that dayYou bid us fall Sharpened claws and worn wingsThat stood the ravages of timeRise from ash, to the heightsNever will you know of flesh again A shadowed arcane heritageThat strenghten in distressA monument of cold designI shalt become......when you shalt fade! Never will you know of flesh again Scorn the bliss - you'll never possessLive through me
