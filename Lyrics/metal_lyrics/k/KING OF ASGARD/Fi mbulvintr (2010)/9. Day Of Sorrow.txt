flaming arrows light the sky
this day of sorrow
the boat has left the shore
the shore of this world

the shield and sword placed on his chest

the sword tell stories
of victorious battles
marked by the strikes
of hostile attempts to claim his crown

i raise my sword
and i swear to my king
to revenge his death
as long as i live

traitors, fear my wrath i still serve my lord

the raven in the sky
will gain my strength
ill hunt you down like prey
ill be the one standing the next day
