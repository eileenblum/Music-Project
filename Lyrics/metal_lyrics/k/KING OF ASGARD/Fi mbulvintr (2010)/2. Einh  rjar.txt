Silence, hark and behold
Shattered fields, substantial darkness... and a swallowed sun
A sudden void, a sacred ground... where Death has sung

EinhÃ¤rjar - Die before us one and all
EinhÃ¤rjar - Chosen to die by the glimpse of an age
EinhÃ¤rjar - Die before us one and all
EinhÃ¤rjar - Reunite, we all shall fall

HÃ¤rjafader, a woven fate in the hall of the slain
HÃ¤rjafader, and a shadow of a thousand...
...when the Wolf comes!

A glance cold, dreaful to witness... and to hold
Since dawn of time, awaiting... yearning unfold

EinhÃ¤rjar - Die before us one and all
EinhÃ¤rjar - Chosen to die by the glimpse of an age
EinhÃ¤rjar - Die before us one and all
EinhÃ¤rjar - Reunite, we all shall fall
