Through the land of death, barren and mute
Along dim laden valleys through solids and shadows
Ashen paths, unreachable grey
Light was none, cease the day
Sound of steady tread, onward HeluÃ¤g rode
Accompanied by the echoes of thousands upon thousands dead

Hel... The tempest and the toil
Hel... The ones of those who set soil
Hel... Onward to the misery hall
Hel... Where the dishonored dead reside

The dead silent staring along the way
With impotent rage, a fruitless current
Helgrind... Behold, enfold the dying
Encirled hall, dreary abode

Of nine days worth, down nine dark nights
World after world, the dead set alight
Of nine days worth, down nine dark nights
World after world, travel the Giallarbro

Hel... The tempest and the toil
Hel... The ones of those who set soil
Hel... Onward to the misery hall
Hel... Where the dishonored dead reside

The final hearth and the final home
Your death and what lies after
With embracing arms, welcome all
No matter the flaws, the fears, the crimes
Drawn is the border of the pending life
Crossed is the river GiÃ¶ll...

And we shall sing, sing until the end of time
Every man and women must come into the halls
The young ones and the old ones will never let you go
Unite us with the ones that went before

And we shall sing, sing until the end of time
Every man and women must come into the halls
The young ones and the old ones will never let you go
Unite us with the ones that went before

Plague and famine
Sang their runes
The last stand
The twilight of the Gods

Of nine days worth, down nine dark nights
World after world, the dead set alight
Of nine days worth, down nine dark nights
World after world, travel the Giallarbro

Plague and famine
Sang their runes
The last stand
The twilight of the Gods
