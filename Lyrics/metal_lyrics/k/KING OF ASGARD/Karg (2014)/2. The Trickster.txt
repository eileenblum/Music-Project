All roads will lead here, all books have an end
No matter our efforts, the time that we spend
Telling our stories and trying to reason
At last when we enter the strangest of seasons

Words mean very little and you can be sure
That this is a place where you have been before
We've circled the hollow hills here at night
We've seen the same sick visions here in the moonlight

Shadowed talking will only get you so far
Sing louder! Louder! You are who you are
When the music dies down and the night comes alive
You will be there alone

You garrulous people, you poor restless souls
Fear's had the worst of you, digging your holes
Telling our stories and trying to reason
At last when we enter the strangest of seasons

Like rabbits you're hiding, running away
From something about to happen today
We've circled the hollow hills here at night
We've seen the same sick visions here in the moonlight

Shadowed talking will only get you so far
Sing louder! Louder! You are who you are
When the music dies down and the night comes alive
You will be there alone

And then of course, the great silence came is civilzation now quiet from shame?
No negotiation, no talking of blame? This is indeed the strangest of seasons...

Shadowed talking will only get you so far
Sing louder! Louder! You are who you are
When the music dies down and the night comes alive
You will be there alone
