This land was passed on from my father to me
It was barren, didn't gorw easily
We put of all of these stones into pile
And how our backs hurt when we passed down the aisles

And sat down to be counted again
To be asked just how and when
We will give you the gold we don't have for favors never given

You're only trouble as far as I know
You start a war wherever you go
You've never been here and still you say
This land is yours from this very day

So send your mercenaries
To the highlands, through dense forests, down winding paths
So send your mercenaries
We will greet them with stick and stones, with knife and sword drawn

And you left us without a choice
Be it a hired hand soldier or a bailiff
All we have to get through the winter
Is in the barn and in the ryehouse

You're only trouble as far as I know
I killed the man with one swift blow
We will do what it takes to keep the plunderers off the highlands

So send your mercenaries
To the highlands, through dense forests, down winding paths
So send your mercenaries
We will greet them with stick and stones, with knife and sword drawn

Civilization's still the name that it goes by
When a fat man draws his lines on a map
Civilization is the name that it goes by
For King and country, give a mighty salute now

So send your mercenaries
To the highlands, through dense forests, down winding paths
So send your mercenaries
We will greet them with stick and stones, with knife and sword drawn
