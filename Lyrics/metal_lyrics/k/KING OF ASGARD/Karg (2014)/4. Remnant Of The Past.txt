A torn away bliss, a sudden loss

Stood throughout the ages, respectful and reverent
Despite of light overshadowed, disdainful and proud
A declaration of a loss, a mark of inheritance
As proud as once was in the beginning still is

For thousands of years and trials, erect, defiant
In memory of his dead son, concealed and colored

A torn away bliss and its sudden loss
We serve to praise, we serve to praise

From father to son on stone (FrÃ¥n fader till son...)
From Darinn to son (FrÃ¥n Darinn till son...)

Relic of decay, its striking wings and story
The wounds from gold will never heal
The fragments of loss will never forgret nor will forgive
A carved stone monument, strengthen and teach us
A remnant of the past in vengeance and honor

A declaration of a loss, a mark of inheritance
As proud as once was in the beginning still is

From father to son on stone (FrÃ¥n fader till son...)
From Darinn to son (FrÃ¥n Darinn till son...)
