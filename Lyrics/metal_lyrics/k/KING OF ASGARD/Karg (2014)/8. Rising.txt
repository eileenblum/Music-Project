The swaying fields, the mighty seas
The shining truths, the darkest past
To let the beast be bound and still
Know he will break free and kill
The one eyed god of gods...

Then when this world is about to end
Rejoice in all the tales you heared
Rejoice the images seen of how, of how
The gods lowed this world

Trumpets roaring from a dead lung
Of death aware! Cannnot hold the blood and poison
Trumpets roaring from a dead lung
And what lies ahead dies beyond

The boiling earth, the decayed roots
Oppressive skies, the end dawns anew
Cold and cruel, coursed the silver moon
Wroth and grim, slain the golden sun

Serpent rises in stillness sleeps the sea
The wolf appease his hunger, slazing sun hangs low
Serpent rises, twilight touches the wandering soil...
The ravens settle down and the wind dies away...

Trumpets roaring from a dead lung
Of death aware! Cannnot hold the blood and poison
Trumpets roaring from a dead lung
And what lies ahead dies beyond

This dying world I understand
They hold its fate here in their hands
And so much did they love this land to spare the wolf
And thus no rivers will would run red
Until the prophecies would be fulfilled
Until the one eyed god is killed, but still wolf is fettered

Serpent rises in stillness sleeps the sea
The wolf appease his hunger, slazing sun hangs low
Serpent rises, twilight touches the wandering soil...
The ravens settle down and the wind dies away...
