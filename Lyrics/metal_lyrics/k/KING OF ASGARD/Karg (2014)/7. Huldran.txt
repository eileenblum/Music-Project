It's a long and tiring journey for a brave young man to go
And his eyes will seek distractions, searching high and low
And passing through the forest, many young men got to know
A strange young girl with nothing on, nowhere to go

This should have raised a question, I think it sould have raised two
But she promised she would let them do the things they'd like to do

And somewhere deep inside, they knew where they were going
When she took her hand and led them to those strange and secret places
And as those young men sow their seed in that secluded sunlit glade
And that is when their eyes turn black, they die inside, they die inside

Southward down the path, she held his hand
Walking backwards, looking straight into his eyes
Southward to that place drenched in that strange, sunny haze
Over hills and over meadows, through woods strange and forgotten

And somewhere deep inside, they knew where they were going
When she took her hand and led them to those strange and secret places
And as those young men sow their seed in that secluded sunlit glade
And that is when their eyes turn black, they die inside
