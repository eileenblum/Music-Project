I lay my blade low as a yearning sign
Oh, for my beloved North with its stalwart pines
Beheld in the east the golden shores approaches
The vast plains where the rivers doth shine
From harshest of journeys of months at sea
I now lay my sword down, my longing heart ashore

Greet me home, greet my return
For thee, my love, my heart shall forever burn

The path of life, its turns and it twists
For victors and lost in glory the end abide
The threads of fate of destined bestow
My path to follow as the Norns them wove
I outlived the night, yet to my dwelling return
To sacred ground worthy my flesh and bone

A predicted doom, a downward spiral
Twined with the flow of time, yet I return...
To where I belong...
To where I set my feet...
To where I heal my wounds...
To where I make my home is where I build my Throne

Greet me home, greet my return
For thee, my love, my heart shall forever burn

Upon my throne, gaunt and tired
I sweat the blood of the sword
By the edge of the water, weary and worn
My horse of the sea
