For the memory of heathen men
... For the fury of the Norse
For our brethren that fell and went
... For the fury of the Norse

Save Us

United in blood
Kindered as one
In reverent devotion 
For the lost ones

Slain by treachery
In boundless rapture
In honor and blood-vengeance
Wore the redded crown

For the ones that buried their daughters and sons
... For the fury of the Norse
for the traitors-cowards with cloven tongues
... For the fury of the Norse

From shallow graves 
Under the spear and the hammer
Yet we resemble 
Their ways

From the waters of truths
They bravely fought the world
The tragic and the great loss
The tragic loss

For the memory of heathen men
... For the fury of the Norse
For our brethren that fell and went
... For the fury of the Norse
