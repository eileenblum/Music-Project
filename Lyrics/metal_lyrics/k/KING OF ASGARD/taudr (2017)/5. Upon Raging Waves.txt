[originally by Mithotyn]Upon raging waves.
Beneath grey clouds.
Far from home,
we're sailing south.
In the name
of our gods.

The darkness of the depth,
stare at us from down under.
But the gods over our heads,
keep their watching hands above us.

Upon raging waves
we sail our ships.
And we look back
against the north,
that we long for.

We step ashore with a thirst of gold.
The sound of steel make us strong.
Soon we've reached the aim for this journey:
Wealth to all our men.

Upon raging waves.
Beneath blazing sun.
We're sailing north
with the pride kept
in our hearts.
