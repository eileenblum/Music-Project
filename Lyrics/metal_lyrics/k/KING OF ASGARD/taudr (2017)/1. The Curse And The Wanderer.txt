a saddened path telling of passings and decay.
Our open wound-icons
From stone to stone, fields bewildered and forlorn
Beleft and earthbound scarred

earthbound scarred

The bonds that binds us-unite us
In heart and last breath
The steps that guides us and lead us
Words protect by ViÃ°urs hand

Erect and vibrant-in constant change
Carved symbols of bloodshed
Night must sacrifice to dawn anew
Fertile and unwelcome

Wettur clash-wettur shine 
From the temple of words... into stone
Never bleak, never fade
Our heritroge throne.. never torn

Tied to the gallows and passed on to us
Speared for nine nights
Shifting shapeless in colossal grandeur
Inhale every grain of soil 
and the curses Varinn

From the caves of RÃ¶dgavel 
Across her appearance shourdedi n mist
Frozen wastes-vicious waters
Still it echoes.
From the roots of the mountain
To the great steep wall
From the deeps of Red
Still it echoes

Wettur clash-wettur shine
From the temple of words.. in to stone
Never bleak-never fade
Our heritage throne... never torn
