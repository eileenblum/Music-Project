Shadows rises and a crawling mist awaken
The traces I leave lingers on and lay waste the burden

While hollow eyes are staring fallen
Cold in dim
While hollow eyes are staring fallen
In drops of red

Drawn into darkness
in light now burn the grandest
Watch, it rises.
In flames, behold my coming

Leave for the heavens in scattering
Flames and fume
Leave for the void of the waters 
In dust and ash

taudr
taudr

While hollow eyes are staring fallen 
Pale and thin
While hollow eye sare staring fallen 
Blue and grim

Beneath the pillars of Hammer
Sky and earth
Fate divides us
As in the crochets of the Norns

Lay it down
Sword and shield
Lay life
Flesh and matter

While hollow eyes are staring fallen
Withered and old
While hollow eyes are staring fallen
Sacred and torn

taudr
taudr

taudr
taudr

Lain down for the sleep of death
Death and Death
Pitched into darkness forever more

Waves that bare me far
To boundless deeps
Fueled and consumed in the presence of Niordr

Burn off-in to the horizon
