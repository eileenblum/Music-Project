Three harsh life threads ravel
entangled worlds. Poison flood the earth.
Boiling seas, heavens burn, chains unseen-burst
Moon-hunt, Sun-hunt, Darkness
Snake-waves, Raging-flames, Fated
Twisting-writhing, serpent. 
As mirrored in the well.

Solen Svartnar / Jorden Sjunker
Himlen RÃ¤mnar / TrÃ¤det Falnar
Death... and a new sun

An axe age, a sword age, blood feud
A wind age, a wolf age, Quiver
Feeding famine with hunger Shudder
One by the aesirs
One by the giants
One by the nifelheim
fate being necessity shapes crushed
at the end of the flesh of ymir 
Giall aloft, Blow

FjÃ¤tter Brista / Ormen Vrider
Elden LÃ¥gar / VÃ¤rlden DÃ¶r
Death... and a new sun
