At the beginning of time
Born of eternal hellfire
The power of hatred is mine
Killing is my desire

I am destined to reign
Hords of deamons from hell
All resistance is in vain
As I release my destruction spell

I am truely Satan's son
I am the Klabautamann

My only pleasure is devotion
Destroying life that is my will
I have really no emotion
All the christian wimps I kill

Smash crusch destroy Kill,
That gives me the only thrill
