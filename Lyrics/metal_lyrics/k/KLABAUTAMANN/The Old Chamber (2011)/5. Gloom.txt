I am the cold shiver
The feeling someone's watching you
The sudden attack of fear
Obscurity enclosing your perception

It's been hundreds of years
Since I became what I am
A strange pathetical being
Envying those who are living
And those who are dead

It's my chilly breath
That pours white frost on the meadow
It's my freezing gaze
Dragging you in the shadow

My thoughts cover your sensation
Distracting your psyche
Affecting your moves
Neglecting your dreams

It is hard to comprehend
I do exist
Yet I am now really there
But still you can feel me

Dwelling in lucid reflections
Of the wailing moon
On the quiet surface
Of silently moaning lakes
