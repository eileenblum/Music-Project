The silent eyes of darker times
Diminished by bright light
The screams of terror uttered in darkness
Hushed by songs of night

Silent eyes of darker times

Stench of fear, breath of decay
Unmade by morning breezes
The touch of malevolent claws
Supplanted by days' embrace

Silent eyes of darker times
Silent eyes of darker times

To murder the night
Trees pain the blue sky
On a dark canvas of light

To murder the night
Trees paint the blue sky
On a dark canvas of light
