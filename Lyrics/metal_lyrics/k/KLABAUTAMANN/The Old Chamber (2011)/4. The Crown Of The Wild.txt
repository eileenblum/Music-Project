No man has ever seen these lands
Mercy for no-one invading our grounds

Claws rip wounds of time
In grasslands of our elders

Hunting my prey, killing the traitors
Howl to the moon

Jaws, merciless, leave holes, break bones, take life
The call of the wild

Hunting my prey, killing the traitors
Howl to the moon

May the hunt begin, may the pack run free
May gold-rimmed eyes find their way
The moon calls us tonight
I am the crown of the wild

Hunting my prey, killing the traitors
Howl to the moon
Hunting my prey, killing the traitors
Howl to the moon
