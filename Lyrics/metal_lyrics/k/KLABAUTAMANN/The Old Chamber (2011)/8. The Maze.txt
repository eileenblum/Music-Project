At the end of the maze
No glory awaits
Nothing but barren wastelands
Withered beyond recognition

Ancient souls remember these dead plains
Where all began and all must end

At the end of the maze
Still nothing is certain
Riddles riding the winds
Enclosing four pale riders

Rider of the palest horse
Rules these barren lands
Where bitter cold silence remains
