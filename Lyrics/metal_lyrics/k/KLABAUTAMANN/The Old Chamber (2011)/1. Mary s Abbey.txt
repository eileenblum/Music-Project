Withered walls buried by time
Breathing the green air of the ancient
These stones saw too much
In infinite slumber dreams of better days

Buried in time
Buried in time

The night breeze bears
Disbelieving cries of reminiscence
Desperate to fly from cells
That are but Earth and boulder

Mist saturated with memories
Veils the old abbey
Recollections of the sun dreamed by withered shrines
And eyes that went blind in primordial days

Buried in time
Buried in time
