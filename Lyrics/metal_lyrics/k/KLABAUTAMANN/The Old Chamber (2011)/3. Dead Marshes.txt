White eyes lure the weak
To find the dead where they fell
Long ago in an age far gone

Don't follow the lights!
Don't follow the lights!

Run from his screams
Look not below, nor above
He watches these lands

Long gone are all memories
But whispers remain
Of the war that has filled the dead marshes
With lifeless eyes

None shall pass these marshes
None shall ever return
Never rest, close your eyes only to die

Don't follow the lights!
