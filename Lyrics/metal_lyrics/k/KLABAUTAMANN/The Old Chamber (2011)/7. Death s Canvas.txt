World's canvas is grey in winter
Fine lines paint the shore and the trees
Willows weep for all the color
Stormclouds sigh for the sun

White mist a shroud to the world
Drowning the noises of hollow
Enclosing the old gaping windows
In walls that no longer shelter

Life has left these shores
Hope buried too deep
In ground covered by silence
Memories all that remains

Lake water blurs
With the colorless heaven
Condemning a lonely ship
To aimlessness

Life has left these shores
Hope buried too deep
In ground covered by silence
Memory all that remains
