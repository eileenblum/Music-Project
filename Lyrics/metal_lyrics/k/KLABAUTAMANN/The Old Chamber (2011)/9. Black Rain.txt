We knew when the winds came
Knew when the Earth shook
Knew when the first died in flame
And black rain started falling

Searing pain, burning wounds
Dead eyes gazing at a world gone mad
Boiling blood the source of death
Polluting writhing veins

Abominations born, the glory of future days
Thrashing in the blood of crippled mothers and black mud

We knew when the winds came
Black rain started falling

Lucky bodies turned to dust
Survivors searching the clouds for the sun
That will hide for millenia to come

Winter, the longest since the beginning of time
Falling on Earth
Burying history
Choking the future
Sealing the fate of man
