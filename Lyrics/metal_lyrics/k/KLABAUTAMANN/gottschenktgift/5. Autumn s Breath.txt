Monoton melancholy fills the sky
Rain is pouring down
A raven is up in the air
And screams gracefully

The water
Running down cold stones
Is prepared to freeze

Dark tree shapes
Black and dead
Their life taken away
By AutumnÂ´s Breath

Before long
The sky will clear
To let winters chill
Invade the land

In dark nights
With a sky full of cold scars
