Ashes, fire, smoke, explosion
That's what tickels my emotion
Murder, Slaughter, Death, Destruction
That's what'll lead to hopes abduction

Torture, tornment, pain and fear
You can see - Can't you see the end is near

I am chaotic evil
I am eternal pain
I am total destruction
And I hunger... hunger for more

Poisonious gas for your extinction
Causing Death is my distinction

Tanks and bombs, eternal war
That's not enough, I still want more

Nuclear blasts, fierce radiation
That's youst enough for gods creation
