A sky painted in the scarlet bends over me
I remember, I still feel the greatness
The enchanting plain, cloaked in silence

Walk the dim lane that bears so many memories
As trees sway in hazy dusk
Past landscapes devoured by darkness

Oh, this wistful atmosphere grasps my heart
When I touch transient rapture
When I long for life

I shield myself for some blithe days
and peaceful reverie

But yet, sorrow is unrelenting and it recurs
My tears fall for you - mother earth
My tears fall for you

Our anguish is divine love
For the loss of eternal life
A life in mayhem

Calm my fear in soothing dreams
And long promenades
As I watch how the birds leave
To forget all the painful knowledge
Just for once
