I don't belong here anymore
In fear I perceive
I vanish into a cold sword

The red streams flow everywhere
A grey curtain and rain everywhere
Bury me inside the fields, where grass grows tall

I will be gone with the morning fog
Come wrath, cover me sweetly

In your arms I could sleep
I cannot sleep
I will never sleep
I will never see you again
