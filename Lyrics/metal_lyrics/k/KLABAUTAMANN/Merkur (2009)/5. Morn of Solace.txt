I close my eyes outside in the rain
As the day draws to an end
In darkness death lurks silently
And fear crawls and caws behind me

I will wait for you by the fire
When you approach the glade
Together we'll watch the dance of the flames
That reminds us of old and precious tales

At dawn we will wander over the hills
When mist rises from the dale
With the gentle waft of the gale

The air smells like great forgotten times
When eagles reigned the empyreal sky

And wolves roamed through moonlit nights
