Absorbing eyes cannot see this key

I'll burn a mark on my chest
To create an increase of happenings
A footstep that regains its place

One way belongs to each of us
An entire sight in this role

This excuses of life
Will guide you into...

...nothing

After all mirth will respire
With every fall age will come
And return to the beginning

After all mirth will respire
With every fall age will come
