Autumn sun sets my heart aflame

I want to dance with the flames
In the winds

So I fly, fly through the fire
Rise, rise from the air

Leaves dance like fire in the winds
The flames they embrace me with heat
Colours arise from the trees
Drowning me in a sea of leaves

Drowning in the colours of the flames

Rise, rise autumn fire
Fly, fly through the air
With me

Fire in the air, Autumn light shining
Â´til the end
