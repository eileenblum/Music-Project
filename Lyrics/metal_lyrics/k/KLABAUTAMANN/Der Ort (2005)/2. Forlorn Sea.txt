The windwritten sailor`s tales
We`re in her hand for now
And yes, this stillness prevails
In our hearts, into vastness, we depart

A storm so unforgiving
And so hungry
No man could bear it

Rain in the moonlight
And a tearing claw

The waves inhaled us
Into the cold throat of a forlorn sea

Somehow closer to it all
Than never before
