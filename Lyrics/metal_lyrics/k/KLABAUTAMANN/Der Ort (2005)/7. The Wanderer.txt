I am the wanderer
Always alone
Must keep on travelling
Nowhere at home

Home is
Where your heart is
No heart
Means no home

I am the wanderer
Searching for love
Must keep on questioning
What I did wrong

I am the wanderer
Always alone
Must keep on travelling
Nowhere at home

Home is
Where your heart is
No home
Means no heart
