This mineral drags the starlight
And it`s rupturing my disguise
I might discover the way back to that river
There, where the gift
Was sunken into my eyes
The black marbles, I abhor

I`ve found it, wrapped in a velvet cloth
Enforcind a union of longing and disgust

The way is old and unknown
Enclosed by ancient trees
Behind them, a white shadow stirs
On this cold and disripting path

I become soulless,
I am unearthly torn,
Tragically cursed and unloved

I cherish and beg for salvation
As the white shadow turns into a dark figure
Stabbing daggers into my back
For the memories of my genuine life
They bring my journey to an end
Passing by, to leave this place forever

I see the forefathers at the ground of the river
