Donât blame yourself, blame everyone else
I choose not the road of the righteous
Anyone whoâs ever felt an ounce of pain,
Or shame in their life can play this game
Clench your hand into a fist and swing at somebody
Like you donât give a fuck and youâll never regret it
We donât give a fuck and weâll never regret it
Your conscience wonât take over unless you let it Call their bullshit
Call their bluffs
Let the world know thatâs enough
Raise your hands into the sky
If youâre out of your fucking mind
Weâre all a little crazy sometimes
But Iâm out of my mind all the time
Itâs so hard to look the world in the eyes
Theyâre everything I despise
Everything is wrong
Everything you love is gone
So raise your hands in the sky
And make sure they know
that youâre out of your fucking mind
Call their bullshit
Call their bluffs
Thatâs enough
We donât care, we donât regret anything
They can fight it, but they know weâre the kings
We will stand strong,
we wonât ever let anyone take us down
The worldâs a cold bitch
Fuck if I care what they think
So raise your hands in the sky
If youâre out of your fucking mind
