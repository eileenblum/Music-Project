We can hardly be defined as human beings
We make our mark on this world, we have a meaning
We have power, but not enough

The way we live is tough to contain
Weâll tear your walls to the ground
and build our own in their place
Weâll tear your hearts out with our bare hands, and show them to your face
Just watch your back in this place

No matter how long you pray, you can never be saved
The endless night is upon you, so start digging your grave
You disgrace, you will live in shame
You disgrace, you will live in shame

You are man, hear you roar
Fuck you, âcause weâre so much more

Weâll tear your walls to the ground
and build our own in their place
Weâll tear your hearts out with our bare hands, and show them to your face
Just watch your back in this place

No matter how long you pray, you can never be saved
The endless night is upon you, so start digging your grave
You disgrace, you will live in shame
You disgrace, you will live in shame

Suffering was the honest man, as he tried to make his way to the promise land
He thought the only way to be safe was to be a friend
He dug his grave and we only fucking filled it in
So build your holy skyscrapers up into the clouds
And know that we wonât hesitate to tear them to the ground
Your self-destruction only leads to more construction
The only way to save yourself is to give up and-

Run away, run away
Donât look back, turn your head, you might be okay
But just wait, you should stay and live here instead
Either way, itâs too late, youâre already dead.

Run away, run away
Donât look back, turn your head, you might be okay
But just wait, you should stay and live here instead
Either way, itâs too late, youâre already dead.
