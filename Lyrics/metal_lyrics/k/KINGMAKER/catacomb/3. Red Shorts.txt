[feat. Stein]All eyes on me, center of the pit
Feelinâ good and feelinâ free, letâs move this shit
When Iâm at the throne of judgement people wearing Diamond Cut shirts will condemn me for all of my sins
Judgemental piece of shit
take your skateboard home and just fucking quit
Iâll tear those snake bites right out your lips

All I see is skinny jeans, judging eyes, and tiny gauges
You are all so much cooler than me
My buddy wants to mack on the bitch in the red shorts
Heâs as hard as a rock right now

Talk about a boner
He keeps on asking me for her number
Iâve never been attracted to that bitch
Cause Iâm not into skinny ass scene chicks

Nobody here even likes music
Theyâre just here to jump some stupid kid for talking shit
This kidâs crew and that kidâs crew
They just wanna fuck with you
Why donât we turn the music up
And shut the fuck up?

[Stein:]
My scene is dead because of you
Aesthetics, and the music too
You sing about things youâll never fucking do
And on top of that disgrace, you bring it to my favorite place
Put holes in the wall, and Iâll break your fucking face
Judgemental piece of shit
take your skateboard home and just fucking quit
Iâll tear those snake bites right out your lips

Jack Starkey got a black eye
I think heâs gonna cry
Like itâs the end of the world and heâs gonna die!
Oh my god our so cool,
Youâre smoking Newports
Jack still wants the marry that girl in red shorts

I love this music
I hate these kids

All eyes on me, center of the pit
Feelinâ good and feelinâ free, letâs move this shit
When Iâm at the throne of judgement people wearing Diamond Cut shirts will condemn me for all of my sins
Judgemental piece of shit
take your skateboard home and just fucking quit
Iâll tear those snake bites right out your lips

All you kids in the crowd
Iâll turn your smiles upside-down
