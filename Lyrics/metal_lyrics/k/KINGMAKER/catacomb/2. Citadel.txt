You donât know the first thing about the world youâre getting in
All you know is that you think you know it all
Itâs your mistake

You canât be saved

Itâs so hard to hard to ignore you
Youâre like a disease that flows through my veins to my arteries
Making me so angry I could explode
Iâll make you know it
And rip out your throat

You never change
Iâm looking forward to the best days
But all I can do is wish that I never met you
âCause I hate you

Itâs just the way I work
No time for your blank stares
Itâs just the way I work
Save your bullshit for someone who cares

You canât be saved

I live by a code of fucking disrespect
If you want me to stop
You better not hold your breath

Iâm looking forward to the best days
But all I can do is wish that I never met you
âCause I hate you

Iâll never stop disrespecting you
