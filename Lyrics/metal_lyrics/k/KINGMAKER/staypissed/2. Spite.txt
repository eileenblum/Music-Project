Tell me why
I canât trust that dumb look in your eyes
I canât sift through the mountain of lies.
Itâs so clear that youâre wasting my life,
You belong in hell Satan should make you his wife.
My eyes are bleeding pictures of you
And everyone can see it within every thing I do.
In everything I do and everything I say
All I know is I never knew you.

Youâll be behind me till I need you
And thatâs exactly weâre through.
Itâs simply not enough.
Youâll be behind me till the going gets tough.
âTill the going gets tough.

I stay awake late nights just trying to believe a fucking word you say
Youâre not trusted; youâll never be trusted no way.

And now youâve left us both bruised
And all I wanted was the truth.
Now we have nothing left to lose
And all I wanted was the truth.

With every single breath I take
I will continue to make mistakes.
Though every moment in my lifeâs at stake
You will continue to be a fake.

Death to you I end a petty life.
Youâre slurring every word nothingâs making sense
I want to make this work but thereâs nothing left.
I want to make my life have a story ending,
But now I see thatâs impossible.

I wonât let your personality disorder,
Hold me back
I wonât let your personality disorder,
Run my life.
