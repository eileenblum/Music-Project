Stop breathing, itâs time to stop breathing
Stop blinking, stop thinking, stop wasting time.
This is the message we deliver to each other
On a daily basis and it only makes us stronger.

Iâve said this time and time again
Spread the hate and spread the sin.

Itâs not fair that thereâs no one I spare,
Itâs not fair but I donât care.

This is for the world, all you boys and girls
Spread the heartbreak till the end.

Spread the heartbreak, till the end
Not a single person in this worldâs your friend
Spread the hate, spread the sin.
It is time for the ending to begin.

Imagine every single thing youâve worked for
gone never to return.

Stop breathing, itâs time to stop breathing
Stop blinking, stop thinking, stop wasting time.
This is the message we deliver to each other
On a daily basis and it only makes us stronger
