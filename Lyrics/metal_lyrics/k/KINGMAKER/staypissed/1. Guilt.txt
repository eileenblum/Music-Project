Let the anger devour your mind.
Itâs such a simple saying, so make the most of it.
Let the sadness slowly seep into your head,
A hundred years or take weâll all be fucking dead.
We conduct the rhythmic spell that will allow
Every single one of you to harness the fear.
Nobodyâs asking you to rid yourself of pain
Or inflict it on another man in vein
Iâm asking you to leave your brains at the door
As you enter the room
Weâre gonna make this place our empire of doom.
Watch as a cloud of guilt overtakes your world.
