I take a step back
So I can see myself for what I really am
Iâm caught in a trap
And everything around me is so full of demands.
How can I make myself,
Out to be positive when positively everything I know
Is such a worthless mess,
And itâs all that I have.

Iâm feeling the weight
Itâs pushing down on my shoulders
And itâs crushing me quickly
Iâve made my mistakes
I canât seem to calm myself down and be free.

Donât waste my time
Itâs running out quick
The voice in my head is making me sick.
I wonât be kind
Or put up with bull shit
The voice in my head is making me sick.

Thereâs a place in my life for people like you,
Youâll never be able to take it.
Itâs full of anger and fear and Iâm so glad you could make it.
Itâs full of every single thing you fear
And Iâm so fucking glad youâre here.

Positivityâs a thing of the past
The new thing is just to have a blast.
This is the truth itâs the simple fucking truth
Lay on the ground while I tell you the news.
Why waste your sweet ass time on positivity
When itâs so fucking fun being angry.
