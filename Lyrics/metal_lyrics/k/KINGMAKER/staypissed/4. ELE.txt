Give me a reason why you think that you can change the world with your words and turn them into you.
Just calm down and take a second to breathe, let your anger out and just sing with me
Everybody lives everybody dies. Itâs so hard to get that through your mind.
Everybody lives everybody dies. Itâs the anthem of our kind.

Give it up just give it up. Youâve taken so much and youâve given none.
Live it up just live it up. Youâve taken so much and youâve given none.

Just because you misread the words that you live by doesnât mean that another canât interpret it another way.
If you live for something you cant see,
I believe you can handle it if they disagree
You think that your message isnât getting through.
Well it is so just stop what you do.
You think that your message isnât getting through.
They all hear you they just donât want to.

It feels like I'm shouting these words for nothing.
Yelling them out into the air
Just because I compare your beliefs to nothing doesnât mean you shouldnât care.

The reason that I said you werenât enlightened wasnât that your message wasnât clear.
The only reason that I am fighting is because I won't adhere.

I won't adhere to your selfish fucking lifestyle
I won't adhere to your negative approach
The only reason that I stand up fucking fighting
Is because I need to stand up for the ones who won't.
