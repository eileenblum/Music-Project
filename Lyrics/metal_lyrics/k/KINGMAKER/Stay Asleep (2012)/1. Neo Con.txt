Look at me, crying on my knees;
Fucking bloody teeth
The wheels of the system keep
Turning and spinning and grinding and burning
And forcing me down to my knees

A world where the well-to-be
Are void of all sympathy
I canât live like this, I canât live like thisâ¦
If I had the means I might change a few things
But I donât, so I let the gears spin out of control

And this Machine forced me to fall to my knees
You call this free? This world belongs
To the minority
For as long as theyâre slaves to their greedâ¦
Go ahead and worship your millions, Neo-Con
Until weâre all dead
Those dollars wonât protect you forever
So go ahead, leave some for the rest of us
