Iâve created this environment
In which I can be truly free of âsocial normalcyâ
An anarchy of thought
In this unrelenting brain Iâve got
It started out so beautifully,
But now it tortures me;
And everything I see looks like shit to me
It stems from corporate greed
The profit incentives of wealthy executives
All my friends are filled with chemicals
Spoon fed by rich assholes
Trying to save a buck, and itâs just my luck
To be caught in the middle of this cluster-fuck
Capitalize me
Incentivize me
Please give me a reason,
Give me something to believe in
Iâm so sick of being stuck in my head
I want to be dead
I am alive just to sleep
Just a piece of the pie, thatâs all I ask and
When I die you can have it back
Look at me, crying on my knees;
Fucking bloody teeth
The wheels of the system keep
Turning and spinning
And grinding and burning
And forcing me down to my knees
A world where the well-to-be
Are void of all sympathy
I canât live like this,
I canât live like thisâ¦
If I had the means I might change a few things
But I donât, so I let the gears spin out of control
Weâre all alone in this but we do not have to be
This awful place gets smaller every day
And I donât know what to do,
And I donât know what to say
This horrible place gets smaller every day
And itâs closing in on me.
I feel it closing in on me.
Fatten my wallet and make me free
I want to be like everybody else I see
I want to fight my way up,
I want to step on heads
I want to build my wealth
At the expensive of my equals
I want this American dream
