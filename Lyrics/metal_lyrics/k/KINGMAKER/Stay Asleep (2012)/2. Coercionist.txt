I know youâd like to see me die,
But I wonât go away,
I just wonât go away.
I just keep coming back.
I know youâd like to see me die,
But I wonât go away,
I just wonât go away.
You can silence me,
You can cut out my tongue,
But Iâll just reappear somewhere else
And Iâll turn into something too big for you to kill.
Too big to destroy with the lies that you spit
And you spit them so well
And you tell them theyâre free,
But then thereâs always me
And I just wonât go away
No, I just wonât go away
But then there you are,
Outnumbered and unable to destroy
The truth with the money that you pour
In to keeping people poor
But I wonât be ignored
I wonât be ignored
Dollar sign, dollar sign donât give that shit to me,
I donât want to be free, if it means this suffering
Dollar sign, dollar sign just stay away from me
All you do is destroy me
I donât want to be destroyed,
I donât want to be employed
By some aristocratic man of faith,
Whoâs going to pay me out of pocket change
