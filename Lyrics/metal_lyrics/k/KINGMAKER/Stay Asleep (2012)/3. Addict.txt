I canât breathe, this world has
Taken a turn for the worst end
Carbon dioxide
Suffocating
Worship barrels of black liquid
Eat us alive.
What we worship is what we feed
And weâre worshiping this disease.
Weâre bowing down to every thing that we see
And still breeding like fleas
Worship wealth and itâll eat you alive
And youâll never have enough.
Worship beauty, and youâll always
Feel ugly as can be.
Worship god and youâll find the answer
To whatâs itching at your soul:
A simple way to describe
The world in front of your eyes
Without disputing what you think you know.
Why donât we have a little foresight?
Stop making choices with our wallets
In mind all the time
Growinâ up in the fucked up world
You gave us was madness
Now will we repeat the process?
Will we let it happen again?
Wonât make a difference how the money arrives
If we donât keep this world alive.
I sold my soul for rock nâ roll
and passing out on the bathroom floor.
I assume the neighbors know because
I scream it all day long.
I just keep picking up the microphone
like thereâs something I can do.
But the truth is; I canât change shit
and I just keep on screaming it.
I canât breathe, this world has
Taken a turn for the worst end
Carbon dioxide
Suffocating
Worship barrels of black liquid
Worship wealth and itâll eat you alive
And youâll never have enough.
Worship beauty, and youâll always
Feel ugly as can be.
Worship god and youâll find the answer
To whatâs itching at your soul:
A simple way to describe
The world in front of your eyes
Without disputing what you think you know.
