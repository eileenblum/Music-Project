Oh, man of god
Give me strength, give me allies,
But above of all,
Give me something to despise
Donât point that thing at me
If you do Iâll be forced to retreat
And that doesnât make me any less free
Not going to listen
While you tell the people to fight
Violence with disease and telling them
That all this evil happens
Because we donât follow your beliefs
No more fascist children, please
This isnât what we breed
Making sacred your beliefs, no more subjectivity
Fight violent entities with violent weaponry
An arms race of the free with no real enemy
Oh, man of god
Give me strength, give me allies,
But above of all, give me something to despise
Donât point that thing at me
If you do Iâll be forced to retreat
And that doesnât make me any less free
Not going to listen
While you tell the people to fight
Violence with disease and telling them
That all this evil happens
Because we donât follow your beliefs
Making sacred your beliefs, no more subjectivity
