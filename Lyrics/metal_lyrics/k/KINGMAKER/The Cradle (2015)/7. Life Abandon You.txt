My God fucking hates me
Does your Lord love you?
No, my fucking God hates me

Particles of panic,
Witness the divine crack of Godâs ass
As he turns his back, you can swallow, swallow the fat
Now I'm haggard but it's haggard in Hell
We're all haggard in Hell, our bloods now thin as water
Full of shit and I wouldn't put much weigh on it
another disappointment, father

I'm frozen with mortal terror
Engulfed by despair, GO

I have too much unfinished business
I'm a ghost that's why hell is here
Whoever said the past is dead
Didn't fuck themselves like I did

But my father
My father said boy be good
And if you can't be good
be good at whatever the hell youâre doing

Sunshine
when you disappear let my loved ones know
I ran my cowardly ass to the devil
To get my soul back because I've lost my
home, it's where the heart is
But these thousand dollar kisses for fifty cent souls
Got me keepinâ on creepinâ into those holes
Oh keep on fucking it keeps the heart cold

All is fear
Nothing is love
Little wisdom
wonât ya come?

This is fear
This is love
Come on Death, or you afraid of what I know?
Come Death, Come Death, Come Death, Come

Just one question before you go:
âDoes your Lord love you?â No
My fucking God hates me
Does your Lord love you?
My fucking God hates me

Sound is where I lay
A silent shame will never pay
These thoughts we perpetrate
A bed of notes we'll never sing
Music is a grave
Rock and roll's the devilâs pay
He spends on thoughts what we create
That freedoms dead

Sound is where we lay
Our silent pain, oh what a shame
These thoughts we perpetrate
A bed of notes we'll never sing
Music is a grave
Rock and Roll's the devils pay
He spends on thoughts of fake
That emo's dead and we are slaves
