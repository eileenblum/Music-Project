Halt
You're in vain
Where's the joy in this pain?
You cradle little faith
Shut your eyes they prove reason
Blindness intoxicates
What the hell you believing

Radiant
Once bright above
Loss of sight
Light never comes
But beyond the wrong and right-doing
There grows afield of trees and bone
Where branches made of stomachs
Blossom silent souls
The world is full

Unhindered, wishful thinking
Devolving planetary grain
Shrinking through abysses
The silent darkness
Now my plain
Here by the grace of God?
A carbon copy frightened land
Why didn't I go whole hog
A briefcase filled with shameful men

The earth is stripped Its gift for noise
We are haven-less
Oh Pale Death bleed me dry
Thanks for nothing my little hell
But I was never alive

Swallow the pulp greedily down the gullet, no detest
We're drinking and drugging
this awareness to death
Find what you love, devour your remains
Cradle the grave
Joy is pain
Join us in pain

Your decadence, always unfilled
Let me hear them scream
It's like nothing's enough
I'm not good enough for me
For I've blown down the bottom
Of the inexhaustible mine
To breeding aberrations
And disease of the mind.
If a God had made this world
I should not wish to be a God
The worlds wretchedness
Would rend my heart
Through violent winds that consume shit
Fear not we're forgiven?

The earth is stripped Its gift for noise
We are haven-less
Oh, Pale Death bleed me dry
Thanks for nothing my little hell
But I was never alive
