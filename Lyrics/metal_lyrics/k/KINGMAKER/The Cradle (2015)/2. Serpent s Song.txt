All of this mental confusion,
fuckin' dragging me down.
Taking me places I never
would go.
Filling my senses with sorrow
and woe.
Sick in the head, never fit in,
Sick of the people and places
you've been.
People you knew, backs turned
on you.
Don't know what the fuck to do.
I guess I'm a let down, I guess
I'm a fucking waste of time.
I'll continue to judge you,
As long as you continue to
fucking waste my life.
And pollute my fondest
memories,
With your constant presence.
Empty thoughts pouring out of
your empty heads.
Now I've grown tired, my
muscles they ache.
All this digging and digging,
day after day.
I dug my grave, it's a perfect fit.
Now fucking leave me to lie in
it.

All of this mental confusion,
fuckin' dragging me down.
Taking me places I never
would go.
Filling my senses with sorrow
and woe.
Sick in the head, never fit in,
Sick of the people and places
you've been.
People you knew, backs turned
on you.
Don't know what the fuck to
do.

Fight for the enemy.
Create sin
Making people want to give in
Irresponsibility constantly
overcomes me.
Make love, fuckin' take drugs,
fuckin' hate love.
For all we know we're gonna
die young,
So let's get fucked up till the
cops come.
Sinner or saint, sinner or saint,
The meaning's the same
You can't get away from
meaningless things,
And meaningless ways to
spend your days just wasting away.
Keep singing the Serpent's
song, keep singing along.
Pulsing through my veins, the
venom I became.
Pulsing through my veins, the
venom I became
