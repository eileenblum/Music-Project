Pull my strings, won't you pull my strings
To a loathsome beat won't you make me dance
Being never at a loss my only devil was the cost
I still stay pissed and lonely
I grab a nail, hold it high
So the hammer hits me hardest
My motives are incidental
Just ask my other half;
My only devil

They tried to run me off
Of flesh and blood
Let mad be mad with madness
I have only three exits;
Death or Madness

I am propagated by the sword, and ever since
I have been a subject of madness
In a moment of fruits and patients

The fear of death itself, are flung aside
But we keep on keeping on to an orgy of devils, satyrs &amp; brides

Thoughts are powerless
Rational considerations are forgotten
Seizing weapons
Oh we're dangerous and sensible as a mad dog
Call off the thirst, they will come
And when the cumming gets good
I'm bound to fuck it up

Rapture I can not ascend
I'm not done suffering yet

Cut my strings someone cut my strings
So I can gnash my teeth
Curse the demon that spoke thus
I have lost my mind my only devil by my side,
He looked at me, said shit happens
I apologize and will reconstitute as soon as I possibly can
But your voice just shook me to my core
I'm no longer gentle now a soulless man

Rapture I can not ascend
I'm not done suffering yet
Rapture I will not ascend
Now a soulless man
Rapture envision this; I rot into shit, feed the foliage

I have no options and I can't say maybe
It's possible or very probable
No way, to hell with reality, I'll die in music
Never so sure our rapture to create
The riots in my heart with nothing to be done
Come ruin or rapture we all go with the sun
But less faith in familiars left me at the brink of hate
It's keeps me rotting on this planet till the end of my days
My saviorâs gone, my devilâs all what's left
I could never lose you love or my angels would rest
But darkness is so god damn welcoming
So let the angels rest and the demons tear through me
You are my deep, deadly, domestic vice
They can have there masked death, unspoken disgust
For everything surrounds hastens to decay
My Santeria, sublime and grace

God if I could see you now I'd spit right in your face
You can shove my fate right up your ass
Because you've brought nothing but pain
I'm sick of these voices going on in the back of my head
I hope it explodes out the front of my face over and over and over again

Hush, don't cry
The worldâs watching from outside
Take the grief
Bind it to your bones, don't you dare weep
Stay silent or lie
Because my only devilâs what sold me time
Can't afford to exist
Can't go on like this
