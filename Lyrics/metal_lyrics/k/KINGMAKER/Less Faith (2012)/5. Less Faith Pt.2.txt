Iâve been abandoned. Iâve been taken for granted.
These eyes have seen nothing but hate,
Nor have they ever stared the truth in the face.
Seven days, seven days, seven days,
Try seven fucking years bad luck.
But thatâs life and itâs never gonna be alright,
The feelingâs not mine and Iâm never gonna feel itâs light.

Bad days fuckinâ holdinâ me down and Iâm never gonna go back home.
Bad days holding me down. Sick of fucking feeling alone.
Bad days holding me down. Never gonna go back home.
Bad days holding me down. Sick of fucking feeling alone.

Hate and fucking madness
Pain and fucking darkness.
Darkness my life has since failed to produce,
Drove me to think I could take from your wonderful news,
So I poured my heart out, and I putt my guard down,
And I put my faith into you.
I shared my sins and asked forgiveness.
But it all amounted toâ¦

A fable, a falsehood, a scandal, a flaw,
I could explain all the feelings I saw.
But I never felt one.
If that makes me crazy then lock me away cause I know Iâm insane.

Even if you hate me, if Iâm wrong then Iâm burning for eternity, donât try to save me.
This isnât what I wanted to be, a fucking waste,
Feeling less faith, feeling less faith every day.
Fucking feeling less faith every day.
