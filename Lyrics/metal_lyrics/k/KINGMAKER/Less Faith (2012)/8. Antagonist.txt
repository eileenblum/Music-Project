[feat. Jonny OC from Liferuiner]Welcome to the world of
A man so insecure a man so weak
The same man who refuses to open up
his empty black eyes

This man is just the product of himself
Not the people he continues to blame

Heâs making his rounds most every day
Destroying everything that steps in his way
Some say heâll never change,
heâll always stay the same
But we still love him the same
and weâll remember his name.

No oneâs gonna win
So we might as well throw the towel in
And give up cause the
corrupt just seem to take the prize

No one is a product of the things that surround them
Theyâre just looking for something to place the blame on
If theyâve ever experienced a hint of the truth
Itâs their responsibility to act upon it.

Nice guys, they finish last
It may be sad, but itâs the truth
If you wanna make it through
Youâve got to break a heart or two.

When heâs sitting at the top of the world
Heâs not as simple as we thought he was, is he?
When he reaches all that fortune and fame
He will realize heâs got nobody left to blame.

I know better than this
Iâve seen human, this isnât it
I know better than this
There is nothing you can relive

When heâs sitting at the top of the world
Heâs not as simple as we thought he was, is he?
When he reaches all that fortune and fame
He will realize heâs got nobody left to blame.
Heâs got nobody left to blame
