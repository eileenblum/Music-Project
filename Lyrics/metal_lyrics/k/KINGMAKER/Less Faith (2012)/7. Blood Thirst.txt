Page after page, keep reading from this book I made
In my own blood
I keep bleeding but Iâm still not saved.

Iâve created something bigger than you, bigger than me
bigger than the air we breathe.
Iâve condemned us all to death so enjoy this breath,
cause your so was given up to me
With this pen I seal our destiny,
this will be the last you hear from me.
Now that truth has been crushed,
itâs time to simply believe.

I need you now help me destroy these demons
Iâve never known anything more worth leaving
Itâs Christmas in hell and all the damned are screaming
Heal us now help us destroy these demons.

I found my god, and he is not of this earth.
Heâs inside of me,
and there is nothing I can do to try and change that.

So damn you all to hell.

Page by page in this book I made.
I keep on bleeding but Iâm still not saved.
Now that I know this is the end of me
All can see that I've betrayed you in the first degree

Souls have forsaken me
No sight of a single sign of life in this sunken world
The sight of a psychic mind.
Iâm drawing a blank and I canât even think
And now the binding betrayal is rearing its repulsive head.

Blood thirst takes my weathered soul
Blood thirst, take me away.
