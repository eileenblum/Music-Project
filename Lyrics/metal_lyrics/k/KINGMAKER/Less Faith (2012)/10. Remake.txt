We are not the same in any way, shape or form
You donât have the mind to create anything
Iâm blind, Iâm blind, I canât see through the idiocy
I canât hardly see at all
Iâm blind, Iâm blind, I donât even care
Thereâs so much to fear, and nothing to see here

No similarity between you and me
Youâve bastardized everything that I need
Thereâs no future for you in this town
So keep your head down and focus on the ground

Keep your head down, focus on the ground
Youâll never be anything like me

Thereâs so much to hear, thereâs so much to feel
And you wonât ever even know if itâs real

An empty casket in a funeral home
Thatâs all youâll ever be to me when youâre gone
Itâs like a sinister plot to pervert everything I love.
A disease if you please; something to make you believe that this is real, when itâs simply illogic.
A disease if you please; something to harbor the sleaze.
A game of make believe, and people fucking buy it.

Thereâs so much to hear, thereâs so much to feel
And you wonât ever even know if itâs real
An empty casket in a funeral home
Thatâs all youâll ever be to me when youâre gone

I have seen my world fall apart before my eyes
I wonât let it happen again
I am here to destroyâ¦

The aspiration of a nation, to remake the same stuff.
No creation.
