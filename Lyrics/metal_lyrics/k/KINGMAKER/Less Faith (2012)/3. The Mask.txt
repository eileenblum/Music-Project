This is not a fucking cry for help.
Iâm just trying to explain myself.
My heart is racing at a dangerous speed.

I tried to save you one million times,
It was just a waste of my fucking life.
I didnât think to save my fucking self.
I didnât think that I could feel inside,
a sweeping loss of my fucking pride
I didnât know this was inside of me.

How could I have known that I could feel this way
Not a single ounce of pride is left inside of me.
I donât know what fucking bothers me more
the anger I feel, or the way that I adore it.

If you donât need me,
Then I donât need myself.
And we can both fucking burn in hell.

Fuck you for not needing me
when I fucking needed you
Fuck me for not needing you
when you fucking needed me

Now that I lost my disguise,
I see a blur in my eyes,
Iâve let myself get the best of me
Now that I lost my disguise,
I see a blur in my eyes,
I can no longer fucking see.

Iâm not insane, but I am fucking insane
you should have seen the look in my eye.
Iâm not insane, but I am fucking insane
you never should have spoken to me.

Your biggest mistake,
was knowing me
My biggest mistake,
Was being me.
