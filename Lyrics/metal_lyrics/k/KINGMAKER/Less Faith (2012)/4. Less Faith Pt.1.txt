Long day after long day, I donât want to think,
Fuck the world fuck the whole fuckinâ thing.
Carbon based, sickness behind my face.
Tryinâ hard to move forward, still standing in place.
And I canât breathe, and I canât feel a fucking thing.
But my heart feels for you,
My heart yearns and it burns and it turns for you.
