All of this mental confusion, fuckinâ dragging me down.
Taking me places I never would go.
Filling my senses with sorrow and woe.
Sick in the head, never fit in,
sick of the people and places youâve been.
People you knew, backs turned on you.
Donât know what the fuck to do.

I guess Iâm a let down, I guess Iâm a fucking waste of life.
Iâll continue to judge you,
as long as you continue to fucking waste my time.
And pollute my fondest memories,
with your constant presence
empty thoughts pouring out of your empty heads.

Now Iâve grown tired, my muscles they ache.
All this digging and digging, day after day.
I dug my grave, itâs a perfect fit.
Now fucking leave me to lie in it.

Fighting for the enemy, creating sin,
making people want to give in.
Irresponsibility constantly overcomes me.
Make love, fuckinâ take drugs, fuckinâ hate love.
For all we know weâre gonna die young,
so letâs get fucked up till weâre all numb.
Sinner or saint, sinner or saint,
the meaningâs the same, itâs always the same,
you canât get away from meaningless things,
and meaningless ways to spend your days just wasting away.

Keep singing the serpentâs song, keep singing along.

Pulsing through my veins, the venom I became.
