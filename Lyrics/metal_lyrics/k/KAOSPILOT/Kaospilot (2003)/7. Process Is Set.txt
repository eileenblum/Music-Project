Mankind is measure. This process is set. We cry for a change - we call for a change. But without movement we stand still. This is a face of a speechless subject. These faces are killing. Monologue without meaning: "for all the what is - and what is not" We kill the day without an attempt. The progress is dead before the second try. Who dares wins. In that moment our actions will define us.

["The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it. " - Karl Marx.]
