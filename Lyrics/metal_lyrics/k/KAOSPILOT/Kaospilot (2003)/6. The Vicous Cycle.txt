It's hard to rise. When another weight is put on your broken back. We give with our left hand with our right hand we take ten folds back. It's not our acts that kill it's more the fact that we never act. We smile and sit content never pushing to make a change. Their faces flash across the screen 10 seconds then they're gone. We press the button and look the other way. The vicious cycle goes on and on.
