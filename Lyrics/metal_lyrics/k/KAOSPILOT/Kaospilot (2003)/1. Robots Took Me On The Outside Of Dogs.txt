Sometimes at bus stops and on daytime soaps you can here people say " no peace for the wicked" They never offer a nuanced version. And maybe words are just noise or a set of marks on paper. Robots took on the outside of dogs. Perhaps this sounds obscure, sometimes I presume if I did not think I would be happier. If I did not think for a second or two I would avoid my anxiety and my tears. Determined versions would fade away.
