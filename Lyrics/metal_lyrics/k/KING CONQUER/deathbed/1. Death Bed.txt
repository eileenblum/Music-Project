I feel death creeping up on me
Look into his eyes death stares right back I scream
I'm not afraid to die
The Devil invites me inside death come take me home

When I'm dying &amp; your by my side don't whisper God in my ear just tell me you'll see me there
I rather be told the truth, than be lied too

I feel death creeping up on me
Look into his eyes death stares right back I scream
I'm not afraid to die
The Devil invites me inside death come take me home

Born for death
Embracing darkness
Take in the pain
Exhale the hate
Born for death

Born for death

Death come take me [2x]
Home
Death come take me

You can pray all you want but the end is still the same
Beg forgiveness or die without shame
Can you feel the absence of God's
Presence now on your death bed?

I feel death creeping up on me
Look into his eyes death stares right back I scream
I'm not afraid to die
The Devil invites me inside death come take me home

Born for death
Embracing darkness
Take in the pain
Exhale the hate
Born for death

Death come take me home [2x]
Death come take me
