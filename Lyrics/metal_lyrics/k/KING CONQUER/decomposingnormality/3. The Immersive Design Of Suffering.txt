[2015 Re-issue Track]As he walks down these streets of a desolated city
That has been stricken by war
Now is in poverty &amp; ruins
What he called home has become a war zone

Fighting to stay alive [2x]

We are all dead
We have become the victims
Facing the same death as the others
Becoming the victim

Forced to wear a gas mask
&amp; pushed to the gun
Has no choice but to kill
The men in black suits are now chasing him
&amp; they will show no mercy

There's no turning back
No where to run
So I must stand my ground
Take hold of what's true
&amp; kill those who stand in my way
