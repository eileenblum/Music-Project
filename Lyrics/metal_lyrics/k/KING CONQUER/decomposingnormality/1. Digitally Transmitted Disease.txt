Fallen ill to a sickness that is incurable
Spreading throw all ages, from young to old

It rots from the inside out
Making us brain dead
To think for ourselves
[2x]

Electorally motivated as human subjects
Becoming more like robots everyday
More like them
Everyday
More like robots everyday

Don't you lie to my fucking face
I'm not going to be like the rest of them
Chained down, restricted from life
Forced into, a clay modeled existence

Microchips implanted underneath the surface of the skin

We are the face of tomorrow

Caught up in our own worldly desires
Not thinking if there is going to be a tomorrow

What I see is our own inquisition of man
Betrayed by the people who we trusted the most
Have turned to greed &amp; pushed away
We have been pushed away
