This filthy world we live in is a disgusting place
Filled with hate &amp; disgrace
Killing the ones we love
To make room for next one
Gathering up the stones to smash against the skulls of our enemies

Cutting them down as the cross our path
Kill them when they sleep
They won't have a chance to run away
Cutting them down when they wake [2x]
When the wake

Do you think God will help you now?
The day will dawn &amp; the sky will turn red
&amp; the fields will covered with the deceased
&amp; the land will no longer flourishing with the living
Our minds will go mad &amp; we will attack one another
There must be a way out of this
Swallowing the flesh it's the only thing that keeps us alive, all we have left is each other
All that's left is each other
Each bite makes me [2x]
Feel more alive
