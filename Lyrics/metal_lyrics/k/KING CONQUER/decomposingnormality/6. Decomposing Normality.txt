The New World Order has begun [2x]

This corrupt government had taken
&amp; there's no one helping us
The media has a grip hold over our minds
Brainwashing anyone who listens to them
Pills stuffed our children's mouths to keep them in order
Don't speak out of line
Your words will be shone &amp; your mind will be controlled
Remember your life is on the line

Chemically produced foods
Fed to us through a tube
Strapped down with restraints
Our eyes are wide open to the screen

Eyes ripped wide open with steel hooks [2x]
Order has begun

A over seeking eye has gazed upon you
Watching every step you take
&amp; listening to what you have to say
We have all become slaves under their command

There's no one helping us
The media has a grip hold over our minds
Brainwashing anyone who listens to them
Pills stuffed our children's mouths to keep them in order
Don't speak out of line
Your words will be shone &amp; your mind will be controlled
Remember your life is on the line

You will be controlled [2x]

Chemically produced foods
Fed to us through a tube
Strapped down with restraints
Our eyes are wide open to the screen

Your minds belong to us [2x]
