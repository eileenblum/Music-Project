Open your mouth
Swallow the shit they feed you [2x]

We are the swine &amp; he is our provider
Force fed reality we choke on our own words
&amp; becoming something that we feared the most

Look what we have become, he fattens us up for the feeding
Look what we have become

Gorge ourselves till we become incoherent of our mistakes
We become comfortable with our surroundings
Forgot what we have done
There's no one to blame but only us
Gorge ourselves [2x]

Keep following the herd [2x]
It'll lead you astray [2x]

Are you going eat out of his hands?
Believe every word he says?
Serving you slop for dinner, will you consume the meal?

We are the swine &amp; he is our provider
Force fed reality we choke on our own words
&amp; becoming something that we feared the most

Look at what we have become
Force fed reality we choke on our own words
We are the swine &amp; he is our provider
