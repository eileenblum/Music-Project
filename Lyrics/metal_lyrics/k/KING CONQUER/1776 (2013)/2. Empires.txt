Over seeking your limits you've become more.
A threat to our sovereignty than ever before.
Unconstitutionally you abused all of society for the last time.

Lady liberties head is underneath the executioners block
And you're the one who sealed the fucking deal!

Freedom's no longer free.
Until you fight for what you believe.

With my own eyes I see the collapse of our country.
And a rise of a corrupt empire
A war debt thats fed!
A war debt thats fed by bankers!

Fallen deep into a great depression
Our currency dissolves with our freedom.

Over seeking your limits you've become more
A threat to our sovereignty than ever before.
Unconstitutionally you abused all of society for the last time.
Lady liberties head is underneath the executioners block!
You're the one who sealed the fucking deal!
This is the collapse of our currency,
Too far in debt how can we get out of this mess!
The collapse of our nation!

Taxation without representation, when will we wake up to the fact,
That we need to get the fuck out of this insanity.
Get the fuck out of this insanity! Fuck!
Rip us apart!
