We have no rights we have no say
We vote on fixed elections
And every four years we expect change
We fight wars funded by the same investors
And breathe in the depleted Uranium

They're crippling all of our hopes and dreams
The liquidation of every business
Their fixation on total control
A designed collapse of the world's economy
Sold to the dumbed down majority
Never believing what's reality

The globalist banking cartel
Creates the problem and sells the solution
Televison and false flag attacks
Sell the imperialistic foreign policy
They've declared war on us

We have no rights we have no say
We vote on fixed elections
And every four years we expect change
We fight wars funded by the same investors
And breathe in the depleted Uranium

They're crippling all of our hopes and dreams
The liquidation of every business
Their fixation on total control
A designed collapse of the world's economy

No trial no six amendment
Freedom of speech as long as you have no opinion of your own
Burn our books and scorch our land
