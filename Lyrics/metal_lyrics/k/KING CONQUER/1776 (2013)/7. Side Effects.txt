We all suffer from the incurable disease called the monetary system.
Our narcissistic masters won't sympathize.
We are the the red, white, and the bruised.

Do you feel the side effects of a government funded by pharmaceutical companies?
We're a dope sick society that's so easily distracted.
We are the scum of the earth, and this is their wasteland paradise.
Inhaling humanity, and spitting out capital. The occupation of your mind is their main objective and killing us off through processed diseases.

Only the good die young, only the rich die old.
I dream in colors, you dream in black and white.
The unconscious majority will surrender without a fight.

There's only one solution

We need a revolution, we need a revolution, its time we make these mother fuckers pay, its time to find a fucking better way.

Do you feel the side effects of a government funded by pharmaceutical companies?
We're a dope sick society that's so easily distracted.
We are the scum of the earth, and this is their wasteland paradise.
Inhaling humanity, and spitting out capital. The occupation of your mind is their main objective and killing us off through processed disease.

Only the good die young, only the rich die old. I dream in colors, you dream in black and white. The unconscious majority will surrender without a fight.
