Another angel spreads her legs, and keeps her wings closed.
Her heaven becomes his hell.
She lives life to the fullest, but she's left empty inside.
Pleasure's a lust never quenched.
Another victim demoralized and reprogrammed for our false reality.
She's so unique in a mainstream way.
With the constant need to flatter the majority.
The elite devolve the species, and we give the desire behavioral response,
Destroying our minds with no empathy, as they sell us a lie that we all believe.
I'm disgusted with humanity.
I'm disgusted with humanity paying attention to distractions, and indulging in ignorance.
Loving lust, and lusting for hate.
Loving lust, and lusting for hate, what have we become?
How did we let this happen?
Why should I care?
You don't engage in politics, but they engage in you, fixated on aesthetics, never aware of our surroundings.
You don't engage in politics, but they engage in you.

Another angel spreads her legs, and keeps her wings closed.
Her heaven becomes his hell.
She lives life to the fullest, but she's left empty inside.
And we give the desire behavioral response, destroying our minds with no empathy.
As they sell us a lie that we all believe.

I'm disgusted with humanity.

Demoralized.
