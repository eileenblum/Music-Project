Lay there an decay,
fucking rot away
as our country dies in vain.

If you want to be heard,
Hit them where it hurts,
Take them from there homes
and Execute them with discrete,

Justice will be served.

The only way to get your
point across
you have to put a gun against some ones head.

Promising us a future
Of dead dreams
and misleading truths,
Lay there an decay.

Lay there an decay,
fucking rot away
as our country dies in vain
If you want to be heard
Hit them where it hurts,
Take them from there homes
and Execute them with discrete.

We are the threat,
We are the ones you fear most,

For we are many, we seek the truth
a end to tyranny.

We are the domestic terrorist,
In the eyes of the beholder.

You will fucking fear us.

Do you think your fucking free?
Just Because you eat and breath
Doesn't mean your free.

Molotov's and rifle shots,
Cars in flames and mass graves.
this is a Wake up call for those who are enslaved.

Justice will be served.
