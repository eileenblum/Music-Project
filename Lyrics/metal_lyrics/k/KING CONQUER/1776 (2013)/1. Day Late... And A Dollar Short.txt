I am American, my empty pockets grow deeper
I'll never get ahead
Always a day late, always a dollar short
They'll take you under a broken wing

Become dependent on a government
That can't depend on itself
Can you envision the collision
They'll destroy our minds, but not our instincts

Society breaks down with every scientific breakthrough
Solidating power by legalizing insanity
Fuck your desire for peace
They rape and pillage in your name

You're against abortion but you aborted your dreams
Privatized banks implementing a dictatorship
Antipatriots extend the patriot act
And constitutionals are put on a watchlist

I am American, my empty pockets grow deeper
I'll never get ahead
Always a day late, always a dollar short
They'll take you under a broken wing

Destined to fail since seventeen seventy six
A power tripping indecesive nation
Don't trade freedom for security

They'll destroy our minds, but not our instincts
They'll destroy our minds, but not our instincts
Solidating power by legalizing insanity
Fuck your desire for peace
They rape and pillage in your name
