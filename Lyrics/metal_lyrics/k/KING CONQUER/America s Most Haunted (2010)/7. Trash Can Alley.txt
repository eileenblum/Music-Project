This is where I belong
This is my home where I belong,
Where I was raised up to be who I am,
Remember my youth like it was yesterday,
playing out in the streets, with my bare feet
looking for trouble, looking for trouble
but it always found me.
Graffiti covered walls is all I recall
Graffiti covered walls is all I recall
what I see are broken windows and rundown homes....
pack of wolves throwing hoop in the school yard,
waiting to strike at anyone.
Can't you see that the devil lurks through these dark allies
Deciding your fate in the depths of which your demons created.
This world never felt so alone
This world never felt so alone
an empty glass is no place like home.
staring blankly his perception are a fallacy
his dreams of thug life, filled his void
Ecstasy over ran his mind.
that fateful night,
the devil returned to redeem his prize.

Hate filled his perfect home,
barricade, unbeknownst, while he slept
the fire started, to raging as his dreams were set ablaze.
Hate filled his perfect home,
Can't you see that the devil, lurks through these dark allies
Cant you see
This is my home where I belong
Where I belong
