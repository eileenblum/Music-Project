You thought you had us under control,
But you were wrong,
We're getting larger by the numbers
And you will meet your demise soon enough!
Cause we stand fucking strong!
Through all these years it's been rough
Our worlds been split in half,

Now I want my freedom back,
We've been stabbed in the back,
We've been Stabbed, in the back!
Rise up and get your freedom back.
Friends are now foes,
Greasy neighbors at my fucking door
Be careful not to slip on the blood soaked floor.
Now my back is made of leather
From being stabbed since forever.

Friends are now foes,
Greasy neighbors at my fucking door
Be careful not to slip on the blood soaked floor.
Now my back is made of leather
From being stabbed since forever.

You thought you had us under control,
But you were wrong,
We're getting larger by the numbers
And you will meet your demise soon enough!
Cause we stand fucking strong!
You can see my heartache or the pain,
Your eyes are where the concrete lays.
The world is fucked, your world is fucked!
YOUR WORLD IS FUCKED!
America's most haunted...
