There is no way out of this hell
There is no way out of this hell
I've walked through the best of these fiery coals,
My life is nothing but a piece of shit.
My potential cries out loud
Hoping one day I find something to do with it.
What will I do if it all falls through
and I have nothing to show for it
My blood runs thick but my heart is empty and cold,
like the bottom of a homeless Vietnam veteran's soup bowl.
What if you grow old and have nothing to show for it
But a broken body and a bloody fucking nose
You're nothing  but a piece of shit.
You did nothing in your life for yourself or any other
You could of done something great,
you could of changed someones life
you could of changed someones life
you could of changed someones life
Now having this said
all your dreams are fucking dead
but you picked up that knife and shoved it straight through your chest
and still have nothing to show for it
When it came to your last breath
There is nothing but empty handed emptiness
there was nothing but emptiness
There is nothing but emptiness
there is nothing but emptiness
Emerged in dirt
what the fuck can you do now
Rot in the ground with your potential
Never to be found
