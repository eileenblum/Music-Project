You're all fucking dead to me
filthy sad examples of life
I am here to take this world
I am here to take everything
every second that passes through the day
you all remain to act the same
I am here to take this world
I will destroy everything
From town to town
I'll sweep this nation and burn it to the ground
Burn , burn , burn
I'll fucking burn it down
Burn , burn , burn
theres no escaping now
the sun will turn to darkness as I embrace across the sky
agony became your only friend
that will follow you until the end
Burn , burn , burn
I'll fucking burn it down
Burn, burn , burn

I am here to take this world
your time is up
your fucking time is up
I'll choke humanity to death
everybodys fucked
I'm unstoppable
who's here to save you now

filthy sad examples of life
I am here to take this world
I am here to take everything
every second that passes through the day
you all remain to act the same
I'll Extinguish you, Because your already dead to me.
once your hopes and dreams are buried underground
I'll fucking burn it down
no one can stop me now
Fire, Fire, Fire
I'll burn it down
No one can stop me
No one can stop me
