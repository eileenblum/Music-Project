Don't give in
When life pulls you down just stand right back up
when life pulls you down just stand right back up
determined to live life to the fullest one step at a time,
and not looking back for the past is the past
and the future is now
Don't Regret any mistake you've made
for tomorrow is a new day
Don't regret any mistake you've made
for tomorrow is a new day
When life pulls you down just stand right back up,
determined to live life to the fullest, one step at a time,
and not looking back for the past is the past
and the future is now.
I won't Regret
I wont regret
Anything that I've done,
for my past will never haunt me any more
I've came to terms with myself that anguish will never control me or bring me to my knee's.
I've be come what I always wanted to be and no one can take that away from me.
My pride is all I have left, so don't underestimate me.
I promise I'm taking back what I've lost
for I am free of guilt and there's no time for comfort
Time for comfort
Don't give in
