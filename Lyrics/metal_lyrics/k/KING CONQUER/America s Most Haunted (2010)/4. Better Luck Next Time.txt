Is this is what you wanted
is this how things were planned to be
An abusive schedule designed by your pathetic self being
hold me under the waves
with every drop of salt I swallow
I hope your heart skips a beat
I waited countless days throughout
the storm holding your future above my head
Now I'm buried underneath the sand
An abusive schedule designed by your pathetic self being
hold me under the waves
with every drop of salt I swallow
I hope your heart skips a beat
What does life mean to you
I've buried everything six feet deep
what makes you think you're too good for dirt
What does this life mean to you
I've buried everything six feet deep
what does this life mean to you
This is what you wanted, is this how things were planned to be.
Is everything comfortable for you
I would hate to ruin the mood all I wanted is 10 minutes alone
to make sure you're set under stone
to make sure you're set under stone
Better luck next time
better luck next time
