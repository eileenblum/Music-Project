We're not living we're just existing.
Embalming the corpse of this nation.
The constitution dipped in formaldehyde.

Society's decomposition has begun.
We're just parasites feeding on the planets remains.

Economic supremacy has led our government astray
The devaluation of our currency, will benefit, the elite, While the rest, digest eternal misery

Is this our American dream, or a nightmare that's come true.
I'm onto their fucking agenda.

We're not living we're just existing.
Embalming the corpse of this nation.
The constitution dipped in formaldehyde.

Processing their disease of manipulation.
We are the sheep that they herd
Awaken from your self induced coma

All hope for humanity is gone.
We have reached the beginning of the end.
In a condition of despair and disease.
