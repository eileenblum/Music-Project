Hard wood floors embrace me
Muscles bruised and tendons weak
to long to recall any form of sleep
garbage food, filthy drinks, empty cups to urinate
gas stations, flying jays, taking shits to violate
eastern, central, pacific lines
everything changes once across state lines
I've left everything I've ever had behind
to pursue this far fetched dream of mine
Black ice and white lines
have become the only form of being home
I wont live my life like you
The end is coming sooner than you think
I'll change this world while you sink
What have we done
We created a monster
We created a monster
What have we done

I'll change this world while you sink
look at yourself in the mirror
I'll change this world while you sink
maybe its your dead end life
I'll change this world while you sink
I'll fucking change this world

We've created a monster to avoid  letting you down
But it only stomps through town after town
eastern, central, pacific lines
everything changes once across state lines
I've left everything I've ever had behind
to pursue this far fetched dream of mine
Black ice and white lines
Black ice and white lines
we're holding onto the reigns of this mess
but I'd rather do this then live like the rest
live like the rest
We've created a monster to avoid letting you down
But it only stomps through town after town
