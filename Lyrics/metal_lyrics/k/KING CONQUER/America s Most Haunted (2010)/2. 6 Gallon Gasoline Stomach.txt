I can hear your deception even when I sleep
With vocal chords designed to lace false content deep
walking this planet only to relay your fucked fiction
With every step you take it brings you closer to the void
you consider us both at par
with every step you take it brings you closer to the void
you consider us both at par
I'll seperate your tongue in two
to remind you of the snake you are
They see your true skin
now who the fuck is going to take you in
everyone has left
now who the fuck is gonna take you in
everyone has left
now who the fuck is gonna take you in
everyone has left
nightmares exist in real life too
leaching onto those who are alive
forbidding honesty for the sake of a free ride
I can hear your deception even when I sleep
I hear your deception even when I sleep
I want you off my back
you're nothing but weak
cutting your throat would only cause more bullshit to leak
With vocal chords designed to lace false content deep
walking this planet only to relay your fucked fiction to me
But only I remain to stress the test
What does this life mean to you
every step you take
I'll seperate your tongue in two
to remind you of the snake you are
they see your true skin
now who the fuck is gonna take you in
now who the fuck is gonna take you in mother fucker
everyone has left
where the fuck are they now
everyone has left
everyone has left this up to me to tell
eat shit and lie your way to hell
