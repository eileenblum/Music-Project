[A.Mele]

The wind blows slowly,
A big silence in the air,
The end of the green
Power...

The suffering is strong,
the pain is a lot,
last breath was made,
everything is lost.

The eyes are now closed,
Forever you will sleep.
Your end is near,
Your end is here.

The Green mighty God is dead...
The Green wings are now closed...
We'll miss you,
We'll miss you,
We'll miss you,
We'll miss you,
the end of the green power...

Mighty dragon is wounded,
he has a wicked heart.
His love for us is awesome,
will be an eternal friend.

Our God is dead,
his soul will be with us.
Spirit of the dragon
will climb to the sky...

The Green mighty God is dead...
The Green wings are now closed...
We'll miss you,
We'll miss you,
We'll miss you,
We'll miss you,
the end of the green power...
