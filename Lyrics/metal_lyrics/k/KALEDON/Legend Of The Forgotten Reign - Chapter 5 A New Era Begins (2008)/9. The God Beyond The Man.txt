[A.Mele - D.Fuligni - M.Palazzi]

I am a new man
I am the chosen one
My spirit is renewed
I am a new God

My blood now is green
My body is a covering
Covering for the force
...for the god

The power of the dragon now is in me
The power of the dragon is in my veins
I am the greatest lord of the reign
I am the god beyond the man

I have to tell this story
To the people of the land
They have to know the truth
About the king

The  troops are very tired
And they need a little rest
Now we'll start to go back
To the kingdom of the light

The power of the dragon now is in me
The power of the dragon is in my veins
I am the greatest lord of the reign
I am the god beyond the man
