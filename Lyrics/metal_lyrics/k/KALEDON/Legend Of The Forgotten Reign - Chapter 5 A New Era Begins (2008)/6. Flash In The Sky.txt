[A.Mele]

 Without warning the green body begins to raise up
high in the sky.
When it arrives to ten meters a green mighty light
illuminates the sky.

The light, the green light,
the green, the green mighty light...
High in the clouds,
High in the blue,
High in the sky!

The mighty body starts to crumble, becoming only
a light in the air.
Daeniel has been under the light, intensely fixing,
with fear in his eyes

The light, the green light,
the green, the green mighty light...
High in the clouds,
High in the blue,
High in the sky!

The light moves, turns on itself and immediately goes
in the body of the king!
Hurled away, Daeniel banged his head. He's now unconscious.
now he is a God!

The light, the green light,
the green, the green mighty light...
High in the clouds,
High in the blue,
High in the sky!
