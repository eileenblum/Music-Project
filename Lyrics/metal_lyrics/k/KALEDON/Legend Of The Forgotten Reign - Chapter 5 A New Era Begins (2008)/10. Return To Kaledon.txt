[A.Mele]

A very long distance
between us and our reign,
we must return at home
to prepare the final war.

We have to learn to fight
against new creatures from the dark.
Mozul runs away,
enemies rise again.

Return to kaledon, return at home,
Return to the wisdom, return to light,
Return to the kingdom, return to our land.

Home,
Come back at home,
New war is near...
God,
New God with us,
New king as a guide...

Return to kaledon, return at home,
Return to the wisdom, return to light,
Return to the kingdom, return to our land.

Very soon on the way to home
the kingdom is so far.
We must prepare the soldiers
for the battle of the end.

The darkness falls again
with a new king and a new god,
Mozul has new powers
and the evil wants revenge.

Return to kaledon, return at home,
Return to the wisdom, return to light,
Return to the kingdom, return to our land.
