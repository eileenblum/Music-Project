[A.Mele]

A second, a little moment,
A small distraction was lethal.
A big lighting from the womb,
The green heart was wounded.

My heart is weak,
My wings are heavy.
I'm here my friend,
I'm here on earth.

 During the fighting in the sky
The black God made his game.
For the troops everything was right,
But the black lord was unforeseeable.

My heart is weak,
My wings are heavy.
I'm here my friend,
I'm here on earth.

The wounded heart is still living,
Because his mission is not over.
Daeniel has to perceive about Mozul,
He has to explain how to win forever.

My heart is weak,
My wings are heavy.
I'm here my friend,
I'm here on earth.
