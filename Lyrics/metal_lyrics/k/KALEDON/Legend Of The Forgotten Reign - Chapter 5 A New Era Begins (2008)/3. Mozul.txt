[A.Mele]

My soldiers, my friends, beware!
Ancient enemy come back, it's unleashed.
"IT" remembers Azrael, was its father.
Now he's the new lord of the dark

Oh, Kaledon, Mozul comes to kill.... to kill
Oh, Kaledon, Mozul comes to lead the dark

His creator and his father are gone.
And your fury, great fury, is comin' out.
"IT" will find the reign of the light.
Now we must prepare to fight against the night.

Oh, Kaledon, Mozul comes to kill.... to kill
Oh, Kaledon, Mozul comes to lead the dark
