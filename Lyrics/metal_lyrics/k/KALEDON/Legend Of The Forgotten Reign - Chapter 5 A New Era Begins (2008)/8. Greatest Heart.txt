[A.Mele]

You are my choice,
you are the man who'll guide the reign.
They need a new God...
you will be the new God on earth.

My heart, the greatest heart.
My soul, now in a man.

Your loyalty
and your wisdom for the reign.
Your sword
will kill the enemy of Kaledon.

My heart, the greatest heart.
My soul, now in a man.

The only one,
the only one are you.
The dragon is the past,
now there is the man on earth

My heart, the greatest heart.
My soul, now in a man.
