[A.Mele]

The black valley of pain has moved
under the wings of the shadowlord.
Lightnings fall down from the red sky,
and hit the ground to create walkin' bones.

Undeads again,
You'll come again,
with the power of the Mozul's soul...
fighting!

The Valley of the Death returned to its darkness,
with the new lord, evil is back.
The only mission is to find the reign of Kaledon,
it's time to bury the land of goodness.

Undeads again
You'll come again,
with the power of the Mozul's soul...
fighting!
