[A.Mele]

'Till now you were a simple captain,
Now your rank will be more important.

I trust only in you,
I want you.
I trust only in you,
I want you.

From now you'll be the new leader.
The new lord of the armies.
Martin... Martin, you will be the new general of the troops.

You have now to work very hard.
You have to find new men for fighting.

I trust only in you,
I want you.
I trust only in you,
I want you.

From now you'll be the new leader.
The new lord of the armies.
Martin... Martin, you will be the new general of the troops.

Yes king Daeniel, I'll do my best.
Forces of evil will have a short life.

I trust only in you,
I want you.
I trust only in you,
I want you.

From now you'll be the new leader.
The new lord of the armies.
Martin... Martin, you will be the new general of the troops.
