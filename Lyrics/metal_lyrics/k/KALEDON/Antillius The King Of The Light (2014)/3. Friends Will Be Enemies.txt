We've always been the closest friends
Shoulder to shoulder as brothers
But during the war something has changed
I'm not your enemy, trust me!

So many times I saved your life
And never held in due
My sword is yours, we are still friends
I won't betray you, I swear

I can't believe that you're trying to kill me for envy
I can't believe to my eyes!
If you'll join the lord of night
He'll destroy your life and your soul forever!

This is absurd, no! Don't do that!
You are confused to the bones
You lost the light inside your heart
And found your power in hell!

I'm very sorry, I must stop you
I couldn't leave you this way!
My dear God, what have I done?
My sword gave you to undeath!

I can't believe that you're trying to kill me for envy
I can't believe to my eyes!
If you'll join the lord of night
He'll destroy your life and your soul forever!
