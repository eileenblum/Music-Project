A thousand drops fall from the soldiers' hands
The holy water wets the unholy ground
The soil reboiling spills from the hell below
Monsters and demons and... Azrael!

From the ground monsters came to the light
They're pretending to fight and to kill our soldiers

Skeletons led by demons on earth
Crack the still and strong hearts of the Kaledon's army

During the war Azrael appears
His strength is invincible
We must fight!

The good king falls on the ground of this war
I swear to you vengeance, Azrael will die!

Lightnings from the womb it sends
All the battlefield si devastated and bloody
Mighty soldiers fight and run
Our holy work must and will soon be done

During the war Azrael appears
His strength is invincible
We must fight!

The good king falls on the ground of this war
I swear to you vengeance, Azrael will die!
