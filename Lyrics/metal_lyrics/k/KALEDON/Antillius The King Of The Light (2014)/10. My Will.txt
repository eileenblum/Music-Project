Come here my dear friend
I would like to tell you a this

My queen died and I have no son
So I want you as my heir

Vultures in the air ar listening to our secret
With their minds reveal it to their master
Who'll try to seduce us
But we'll uncouple his head from the neck

Daeniel will be the new king
When I will leave this earth

Everyone must follow him
And must protect his life

Vultures in the air ar listening to our secret
With their minds reveal it to their master
Who'll try to seduce us
But we'll uncouple his head from the neck
