One day I saw you there
Your eyes were full of hate
You were a which of the evil master
Here to murder me

I tried to save the good in you
I fought the evil in your mind

You saved my life, and my soul is now free
I love you my great king, we are together in one heart
One heart and one soul

Now we live our life
Joined by the strongest love
The plin of enemy has failed
You are here to love me

My life with you is wonderful
But I feel there is something strange

You saved my life, and my soul is now free
I love you my great king, we are together in one heart
One heart and one soul
