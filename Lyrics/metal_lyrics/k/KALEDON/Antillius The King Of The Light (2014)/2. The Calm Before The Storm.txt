My life started in the midland
And was pretty normal
My father was a merchant
With a little parlor

For the daily needs
A lot of people coming
And here I met my friend
The greatest frind of mine
That I might have

You came into my life
As a friend of mine
You are my strength, my power and my force
...but all this will change

After the new king's election
Many things are changing
I need a new job
To improve my life

The greatest friend of mine
Recommended me
In the mighty castle
For the hostler job
Finally I'm here

The calm before the storm

You came into my life
As a friend of mine
You are my strength, my power and my force
...but all this will change
