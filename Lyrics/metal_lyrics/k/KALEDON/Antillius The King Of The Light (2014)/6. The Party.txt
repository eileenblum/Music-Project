Today is a great day for the reign
'cause we have a new king

We know him well since a very long time
And his name is Antillius

Joy and Glory, we all scream from the crowd
All hail to the king, long live to Antillius

I will remove all the old taxes
And I will give an house to you

With me there will be no more poors
And all the people will be equal

Joy and Glory, we all scream from the crowd
All hail to the king, long live to Antillius
