The fog is rising in the streets, it's now here
Monsters and soldiers appear to kill us
Desperate cries are flying in the air

Oh no my dear friends
The evil king wants to kill us all
We must defend our lives
Our souls and our beloved reign

Kidnapped from my home to destroy my heart
The longest trip of my life is to nowhere
Four years to reach this hell, I hate you

Oh no my dear friends
The evil king wants to kill us all
We must defend our lives
Our souls and our beloved reign

The evil conquest
