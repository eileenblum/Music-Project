Good bye my friend
Good bye my king
We'll never forget your name
Good bye my friend
Good bye my king
We'll never forget your love

Your body goes away
But Your spirit remains
Your heart has gone
We'll love you forever
Now I'm here alone
And this kingdom needs me

Good bye my friend
Good bye my king
We'll never forget your name
Good bye my friend
Good bye my king
We'll never forget your love
