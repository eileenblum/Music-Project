Angels and Demons,
White and Black,
There is no good, without Evil,
And then, Daeniel the Great

What good is and what evil is ?
Only the ways of destiny...

But open eyes can see
A Great has risen to the Throne
A Great will rise from the depths of the ground
And great will be the battle...between the Great...
...between the Great......
...between the Great......
