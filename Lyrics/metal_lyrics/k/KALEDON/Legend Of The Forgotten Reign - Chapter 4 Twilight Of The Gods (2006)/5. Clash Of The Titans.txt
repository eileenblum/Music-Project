Fighting on the earth
Fighting in the sky
Swords and lances on the earth
Fire and blood in the red sky

Mighty gods in the sky
Overfly the black land
It's the clash of the titans
It's the war of the gods

Over the soldiers, over the land
Over the mountains, over the sea
In the red sky the powerful revenge

Fire from the fauces,
Flashes from the eyes
In the red clouds,
Blood of revenge
This is the fighting,
The fighting of the gods
It's the clash of the titans

Thunder and lightning
Background of the sky
Thunder roars and claws
Come until the ground

Antillius died by Azrael hand
All the people want revenge
The dragon fights in the dark
But God will win the war

Over the soldiers, over the land
Over the mountains, over the sea
In the red sky the powerful revenge

Fire from the fauces,
Flashes from the eyes
In the red clouds,
Blood of revenge
This is the fighting,
The fighting of the gods
It's the clash of the titans
