Listen to me
I am the new king
You think with me
The new plan of war

Antillius has died
Saving us
We must complete
The plan of the king

This is the new plan of war, the new plan to win the evil
Now there's a new king a new king for the reign
The war will be won in the name of the old king

With his councilman
They'll try to decide
With his mighty men
They'll start the last war

The dragon will come
To help us
The dragon will fight
The evil... the night...

This is the new plan of war, the new plan to win the evil
Now there's a new king a new king for the reign
The war will be won in the name of the old king

New king Daeniel
Gives order to go
The son of the light
Against the night

This could be the end
The end of the dark
They hope to succeed
In carrying the White

This is the new plan of war, the new plan to win the evil
Now there's a new king a new king for the reign
The war will be won in the name of the old king
