And the fog goes down
And everything is hung up
And every eye is inflamed

And all the souls
Have opened in wait
And then everything goes fast

Like a run in a drop,
Like water in a fall,
Main instinct is the king
And the scent of the blood
Flies through the fog

The cries and the clash
Are lost in the mist
But not the death, not the death

The monsters and the men
Are vanishing in the mist
But not the death, not the death

Like a run in a drop,
Like water in a fall,
Main instinct is the king
And the scent of the blood
Flies through the fog

Then,
The wave of the battle goes away
Then,
The warriors become of ice,
Silence,
And thousands, amazed eyes,
Look,
Look to the red burning sky...
