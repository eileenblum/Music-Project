The Dragon descends between the troops
And it reaps dead like wheat
Also the children of Azrael
Succumb to him...to him

A strong white light surrounds
The armies of Kaledon
And terrifies the undead
And the monsters...are blind

The Fury comes
Down from the sky... The light that destroys
The blind, the Fury of the sky
The light that burns

And Daeniel looks spellbound
So much power and majesty
And he sees the Dragon
For what it is... a sun

But the destiny is written
The Dragon is tired
The Ancient Enemy
Has hurt him...in deep

The Fury comes
Down from the sky... The light that destroys
The blind, the Fury of the sky
The light that burns
