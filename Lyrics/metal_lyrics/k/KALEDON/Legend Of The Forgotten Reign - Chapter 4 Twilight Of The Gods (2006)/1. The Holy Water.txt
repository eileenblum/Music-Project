This is the last part of the war
We must destroy the evil
We must fight the demons
The monsters of the earth

Now is the time to call the priests
The evil forces of the night will die
The kingdom of the darkness will die
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Holy water on the damned earth
Mighty heroes for the glorious fight
Holy water on the land of the dark

Tons of demons coming to the night
Monsters from ancient centuries
Awakening by the holy mighty water
Creatures of the night... of the hell

Called by the words of the sorcerer
Killed by the power of the swords
The water will destroy their skin
The water will destroy their souls

Holy water on the damned earth
Mighty heroes for the glorious fight
Holy water on the land of the dark

Water
Holy water
Water
Holy water

Holy water on the damned earth
Mighty heroes for the glorious fight
Holy water on the land of the dark
