The Dragon wants
To use his eyes
Against Azrael

And Daeniel listens
Into his heart
His voice to speak

And the eyes
Change their essence,
Flesh and blood
In light and fire

Eyes, Eyes of Fire
Eyes of Fire
Eyes, Eyes of Fire
Eyes of Fire

And Daeniel takes
The dragon's eyes
Over his hands

And recites
The magic spell
Words from the past

And the eyes
Change their essence,
Flesh and blood
In light and fire

Eyes, Eyes of Fire
Eyes of Fire
Eyes, Eyes of Fire
Eyes of Fire
