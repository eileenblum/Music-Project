When IT has fallen on the ground
It sunk down and down
Until to reach the center of the earth
And his heart has been torn away

Then here IT has been cared
And changed by an ancient force,
More than the Dragon, the White
More than Azrael, the Dark

Cry
In the sky of this world
Free out of the ground
As a star that rises from the low

This is the Great Essence
Of this World
She follows her desire
Of creation

And the gods have come here,
And the dragon,
And the man is awakened
And Mozul rises,

This is her gift to the world
So that from the darkness
The light gushes

Cry
In the sky of this world
Free out of the ground
As a star that rises from the low

Cry
In the sky of this world
Free out of the ground
As a star that rises from the low
