Hail, hail, hail to the king
Hail, hail, hail Daeniel
New king for the kingdom
New hope for the land

New era will start
New era will come
Daeniel the man, Daeniel the king

He is the lord of the Antillius' land
He is the son, he'll be the new king
With his heart and with his sword
He will defend your lives

Now I am your mighty king
And I'll love you like my children
Now my heart will be Yours
And you'll have a new great friend

New era will start
New era will come
Daeniel the man, Daeniel the king

He is the lord of the Antillius' land
He is the son, he'll be the new king
With his heart and with his sword
He will defend your lives

Scream, scream, scream his name
Win, win, win for the king
New friend for the people
New sword for the crown

New era will start
New era will come
Daeniel the man, Daeniel the king

He is the lord of the Antillius' land
He is the son, he'll be the new king
With his heart and with his sword
He will defend your lives
