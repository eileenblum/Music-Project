This is the Apocalypse
The Prophecy has come true
This is Hell on Earth
Abominations that walk
On desolate lands
It is a terrible sight

The eyes can see
The heart has melt
So much horror
On earth
For the infamous Beast
The Black Prince is here

Azrael
Manifests him self
Son of Fire
Walk on the Earth

At his arrival
The army of Kaledon
Is petrified
The King is frozen
Lost in the horror
Immovable

Azrael sees,
Is turned and sneers,
A powerful thunderbolt
To his heart throws,
The Great King falls
And Daeniel shouts

Azrael
Manifests him self
Son of Fire
Walk on the Earth
