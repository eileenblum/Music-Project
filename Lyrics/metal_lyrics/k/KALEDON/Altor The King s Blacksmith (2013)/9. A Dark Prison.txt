I am here in this cold cell
I am here with you all
This is a real nightmare
All the people are very scared

This is the underworld
The reign of the black lord
Skeletons out of the gratings
Monsters out of the castle

A dark prison, a cold prison is the last thing
that I see
I am in peace, my heart in peace is all that I
want for me
Goodbye, Goodbye, My soul now is free

Sorry Daeniel, my dear friend
I had promised I know
But I can't finish here my job
I can't deliver your steel

I will soon close my eyes
But my soul is free from lies
I am sad only for you
For your unfinished sword

A dark prison, a cold prison is the last thing
that I see
I am in peace, my heart in peace is all that I
want for me
Goodbye, Goodbye, My soul now is free

Please my friend swear to me
Swear that they will never win
You must strongly kill them all
You must save our king

My soul now is free
I can finally see my love
Together we will stay
Hand in hand forever

A dark prison, a cold prison is the last thing
that I see
I am in peace, my heart in peace is all that I
want for me
Goodbye, Goodbye, My soul now is free
