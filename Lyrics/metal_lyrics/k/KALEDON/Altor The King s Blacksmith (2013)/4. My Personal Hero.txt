My old and dear father,
My inspiration of life,
The bed you've laying on
for me is an altar like.
My dues with you are all my
Own life's treasures and gifts,
And I feel cold and sad
Now that your  spirit lifts.

Stroke me again,
Don't leave us alone,
I feel safe as once no more.

You renounced too much time
To my help in the fields,
To let me cultivate
My talent in swords and shields
I always paid honour
To the efforts you made to me
So you are my pattern
In supporting the family

Stroke me again,
Don't leave us alone,
I feel safe as once no more.

As a shining star in the night
You have led me in my sky,
And my path is not as bright
As when you were on my side.
I wouldn't never let you go...
My personal hero

My old and dear father,
My inspiration of life,
The bed you've laying on
for me is an altar like.
I'll try to lead my life
As a mighty sword in the sky
Then rejoin you in heaven
So towards God we will fly
