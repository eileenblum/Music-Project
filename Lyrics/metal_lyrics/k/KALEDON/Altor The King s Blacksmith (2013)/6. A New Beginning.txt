In the reign of Kaledon the king needs a smith
My wife is very sad so I will make this trip
The realm is very far but here I have no one
A new beginning for m, I will never be alone

I love my job you know... the steel is my life
I can't wait to start this journey
Antillus gave me a new hope

After a long trip I was finally there
The reign was very large, as in the stories I heard
A great opportunity is waiting for m
Hammer and eavil is all that I need

I love my job you know... the steel is my life
I can't wait to start this journey
Antillus gave me a new hope

I have to create tons of things every day
For any kind of trouble I have to find the way
Swords, shields and armours I build on demand
I am the only man who can make this in the land

I love my job you know... the steel is my life
I can't wait to start this journey
Antillus gave me a new hope
