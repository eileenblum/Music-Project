You are my love and my life
I love you Lilibeth
With you all my days are now full
Full of love, love for you

You walked into my life like a bolt from the
blue ... suddenly my heart, got lost in your
smile ... and it was love.

In silence we said "I love you"
Just looking into our eyes
Our feeling is stronger than all
Our hearts are now one

You walked into my life like a bolt from the
blue ... suddenly my heart, got lost in your
smile ... and it was love.

Evil took you away from me
I already miss you
My life without you is at the end
My heart is wounded

You walked into my life like a bolt from the
blue ... suddenly my heart, got lost in your
smile ... and it was love.
