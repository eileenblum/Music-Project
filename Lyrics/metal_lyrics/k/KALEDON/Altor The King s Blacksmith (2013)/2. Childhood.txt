He was born in April
In 1298
It was a desolated village
In the north of the land

His life was very hard
The days were very long
The plate was often blank

Poor in my life, rich in my heart
All that I possess is in a jar
With a great friend, with a great strength
I can live my life even if it's hard

His father was a farmer
Who dug the land to eat
His mother was a maid
To pay the daily needs

His life was very hard
The days were very long
The plate was often blank

Poor in my life, rich in my heart
All that I possess is in a jar
With a great friend, with a great strength
I can live my life even if it's hard
Lose is stronger than the pain
And he has love to sell
His life will be his mate

His life was very hard
The days were very long
The plate was often blank

Poor in my life, rich in my heart
All that I possess is in a jar
With a great friend, with a great strength
I can live my life even if it's hard
