The fog starts to appear
Is coming very near
Screams start to fly
Screams high in the sky

Oh my god they are dead
One skull instead of the head
One scary nightmare
I don't want to go nowhere

This is an abduction, scary is my reaction
What these monsters want from me?
We will fight for our life, we don't want to comply
I can hear screams in the wind

All the people are rapt
All the people are trapped
Phantom horses ride fast
New destination, the last

In the enchanted forest we are home sweet
home is now far
People have now realized
They won't see again the sunrise

This is an abduction, scary is my reaction
What these monsters want from me?
We will fight for our life, we don't want to comply
I can hear screams in the wind

The reign of Carnagus is here Screams of fear
I can hear Many hearts begin to die Many
souls begin to shine

Maybe this is the end I'll finish my life in this
land The awful land of evil

It is the house of the devil

This is an abduction, scary is my reaction
What these monsters want from me?
We will fight for our life, we don't want to comply
I can hear screams in the wind
