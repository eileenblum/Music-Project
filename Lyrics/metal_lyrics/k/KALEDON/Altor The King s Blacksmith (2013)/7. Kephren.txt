The king ordered a new sword
A new trusted friend
To defend the reign

Will be a very long work
Tons of hammer blows
A mouth night and day

In the sky the sword will rise,
In his hand the sword will strike
Kephren trusty steel for the crowned head

Before entering the castle
Soldiers at the gate
Want to see the mysterious object

In the king's great hall
The sight of the sword
Took the king's breath away

In the sky the sword will rise,
In his hand the sword will strike
Kephren trusty steel for the crowned head

Antillus said Altor
"Tell me, what's its name"
"Kephren" was the answer

The king asked for a second
Trusted mighty steel
For his friend Daniel

In the sky the sword will rise,
In his hand the sword will strike
Kephren trusty steel for the crowned head
