I have a friend a great of mine
I'm always with him all the days of my life
I like his father because is a smith
I'll follow him

I like his job and I want him as teacher
I'll speak about him to my family
I have this dream since a very long time
I will succeed

Every day in the smithy to improve the art...
...to improve that art of the steel
Mighty power in my body is what I feel
I create what people make me deal

My beloved father is very old
He is very weak and very sick
I can earn money to buy a stick
For his old age

I try to pay for you some cure
I know what you feel is hard to endure
Unfortunately we are very poor
I loved you dad

My thoughts through my hands become reality
Between hammer and the anvil I live
The dream has come true I do it for you
And I hope you can finally heal

This is the life I've always dreamed
Me and the hammer as a good team
Forging steel is what I do
Day by day

I can always find the way to play
I use the steel as if it was clay
Nothing for me is heavy in this job
I am totally in it

Every day in the smithy to improve the art...
...to improve that art of the steel
Mighty power in my body is what I feel
I create what people make me deal
My thoughts through my hands become reality
Between hammer and the anvil I live
The dream has come true I do it for you
And I hope you can finally heal
