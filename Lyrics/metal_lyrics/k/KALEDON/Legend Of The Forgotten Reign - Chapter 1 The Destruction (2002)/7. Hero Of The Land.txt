Fire and ice in my eyes
By the sword I survive
like an eagle I will fly
Here I am, Hero of the land
I defend all the sons of mighty land
Holy sword in my hands
It's taking life and giving death
With my blade I ride proud
In the name of my honor
Living steel in my veins
Here I am, Hero of the land
I defend all the sons of mighty land
Holy sword in my hands
It's taking life and giving death
Where the wolves hunt free
Where the eagle flies proud
Where the only one is the king
Here I am, Hero of the land
I defend all the sons of mighty land
Holy sword in my hands
It's taking life and giving death
With my  sword and with my heart
I serve the king of Kaledon
For his will I will fight
Here I am...
