Somewhere in the sky
There's a dragon that flies
Sometime in the dark
There's a ghost that wander
Out in the fairy land
A rider rides alone
Where the earth meets the sky
He meets his destiny
Thunder in the sky, it's coming into the forest
Thunder in the forest, it's the only way to escape
My alterego is something strong
When the sword is taken out
The Thunder can win me
The Thunder can win us
Thunder in the sky, it's coming into the forest
Thunder in the forest, it's the only way to escape
We fight like the dragons
during the last battle
riding on the wind
for the king's revenge
Theese are the thunders
The thunders strike the forest
we are the soldiers
of the reign of power
Thunder in the sky, it's coming into the forest
Thunder in the forest, it's the only way to escape
