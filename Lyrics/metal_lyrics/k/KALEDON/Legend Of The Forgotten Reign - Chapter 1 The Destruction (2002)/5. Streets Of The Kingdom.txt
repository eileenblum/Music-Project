This is the reign after the war
Running forever under the storm
This was the great kingdom come
This was the reign for us
Running away forever we'll fight
We are the knights chosen by fate
With the sword and with the power
The dragon will fight against the evil
Theese are the streets of the kingdom,
theese are the soldiers for freedom
We must fight for life of the reign
Fighting the bad king with the sword,
riding the dragon for our life
This I can see in the streets
Another rainy day over the ruins
All the soldiers are running away
The great reign must be revenged
From this evil nightmare
This is the power inside of my sword
Angel of light, blessed by God
The chains of honor, this is my fate
The guard of Life, for this is my rage
Theese are the streets of the kingdom,
theese are the soldiers for freedom
We must fight for life of the reign
Fighting the bad king with the sword,
riding the dragon for our life
This I can see in the streets
