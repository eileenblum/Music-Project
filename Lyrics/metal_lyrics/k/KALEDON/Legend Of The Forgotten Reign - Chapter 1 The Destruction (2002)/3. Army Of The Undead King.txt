Under the moon
When nobody is around
Out from the castle, silent night
There's a fear in the men ... fear of the Wolf
Prisoners in their nightmares
There's no love in their heart
And no mercy ... In the well of their eyes
Army of the undead king, legend of the past,
Army of the undead king,from the dungeon in the mud,
Army of the undead king...
Creatures ride into the blood
The undead king tyrannizes on
All the gates  ... Of  kaledon
But we fight again
Waiting for the black sun
The day of the crypts only we will win
For kaledon's gates
Army of the undead king, legend of the past,
Army of the undead king,from the dungeon in the mud,
Army of the undead king...
