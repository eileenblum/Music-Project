We are in search of Kaledon
We are the Knights chosen by fate
We are the warriors who fight for life
They meeting danger during the way
Knights of the king with their magical swords
They fight the death for Kaledon's life
When the Jackal fall down
for hand of the warriors of the great king
Follow the way for the mighty lost reign
Into the mist, against the shadows
born with a destiny written in the stars
Riding hell horse for an endless time
Into the dark , facing the Evil
Under the sign of the steel crown
We are in search of Kaledon
We are in search of Kaledon
