Looking at the sky, I always hope to take the way
I know that I will fly
No pain, no desperation in my eyes.
In the name of Kaledon.
For the people who believed in me, I ride
The Dragon will kill the Slaughterer, the Undead King
I'm waiting for the last war, in the Deep Forest
Catching my breath, brandishing my blade,
my spirit will go on until the fight comes to me
I fight for the crown,
I kill for the Reign, I face the evil,
I serve my Lord
I am the one commanded by the King of Kaledon
