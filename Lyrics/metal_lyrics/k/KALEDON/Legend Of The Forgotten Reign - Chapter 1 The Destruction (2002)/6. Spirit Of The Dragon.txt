Screams and Shouts break the silence
This rainy day, the chosen one
For vengeance , for conquest , for kill
It's time to wear my armor of steel
From ash and fire I rise
Strong of the Dragon's power
The king of Kaledon give me the order
To crash, to slash, to smash
Saint with the Spirit of the Dragon,
he wears his mighty armour of steel,
he rides on a trail of fire,
no way to escape his power
Sharp like the talons of an eagle
My sword will fight the enemies
Die by Kaledon's king will
Die by my steel
No way to hurt me , I feel no pain
No try to kill me, I can not die
I feel no mercy, I am the balance
Spirit of the dragon
Into the battle, I follow the king
Light up the sky with the Dragon's fire
Kill, die, and be Saint!
Heaven and hell
Saint with the Spirit of the Dragon,
he wears his mighty armour of steel
he rides on a trail of fire,
no way to escape his power
