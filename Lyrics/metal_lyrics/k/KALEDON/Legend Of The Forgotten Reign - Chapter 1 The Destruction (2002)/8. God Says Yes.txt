After ten years of darkness
The Knights of the reign said stop
After ten years of destructions
The King said " Fight"
Knights search all around
the hidden reign we don't find
With the sword and without fear
We call God
The God says yes, and with His power, we search and we reveal
The reign of Kaledon
At the gates of the hidden reign
We're ready to fight the undead troops
And without the shields
we Fight as pure steel
like the immortal,  the Kaledon' s braves
we Fight against the undead
The hidden reign now is free
From the evil king
The God says yes, and with His power, we search and we reveal
The reign of Kaledon
God says yes !
The fate is right for us... the light's on Kaledon...
