Legend of the forgotten reign
They ride the wind
For the glory of the king
The reign of power come back to the light
They ride the  dragon
Fighting the undead
In the night the evil comes
To destroy the reign of us
The evil troops in the fog
Kill the sons of kaledon
King Antillius and his troops

Fight the knights of the night
And they honor is light`s shield
Defends the land from the fear

The dragon will fly all over the mountain
to fight with the brave cavaliers
Fighting the evil, riding the sky
The glory of victory is in the steel
The knights of the light, for the pride of the king
They ride the wind and will win
It`s time to fight until the end
The living blade is in my hands
I believe in our freedom
and this is my  life`s reason
Bloody taste is in the air
Honor fight against The Fear
The  Living Undead  run away
but the Jackal will come again...
The dragon will fly all over the mountain
to fight with the brave cavaliers
Fighting the evil, riding the sky
The glory of victory is in the steel
The knights of the light, for the pride of the king
They ride the wind and will win


Thanks to kaledon for sending track #7 lyrics.
