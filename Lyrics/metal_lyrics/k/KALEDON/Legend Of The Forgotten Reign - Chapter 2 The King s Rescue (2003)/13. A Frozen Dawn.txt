This is a frozen dawn,
a dark hour for my kingdom...

Azrael, give me the power
to let triumph the evil...

Now that my human soldiers
running away...

I have in force
only the undead
Rise from the hell
rise Azrael...
I have in force
only the undead
Rise from the hell
rise Azrael

[CHORUS:]
oh Azrael, I will drink the blood of the White Wolf
oh Azrael, I will spread salt on Kaledon
I will sacrifice to the altar of your lust
oh Azrael, one victim every night....

[Repeat CHORUS.]
