New reign was born
New army will leave
Under the white clouds
New kaledon rise

Blow swift cold wind
Fly in the reign
Eagles in the land
Power is in the air

Big castle dominate the ground
White bricks compose the walls
Is the fortress ,the imposing
home of the king

Archers are on the towers
Proud flags are on the spout
Kaledon's coat of arms is high
high in the sky

Keep the faith alive, this is the new big kingdom
Mighty wisdom  of our king, creates love in the people's heart

all the free men
are glad about the king
that  is  beloved
for his simplicity

forever we'll scream
as torches in the wind ...
honor and loyalty
to the crown of the king

Big castle dominate the ground
White bricks compose the walls
Is the fortress ,the imposing
home of the king

Archers are on the towers
Proud flags are on the spout
Kaledon's coat of arms is high
high in the sky

Keep the faith alive, this is the new big kingdom
Mighty wisdom  of our king, creates love in the people's heart
