Through many years and many tears
The big Fear is gone away
the big war is coming near
the redemption begins now

Free in the land we're not afraid
like pure spirit we live
they want the end of the ages
but they won't hurt us, never more

Revenge
Revenge for save the kingdom
Revenge
Revenge for fight the evil

The rage, the fury, the justice for all
This is the honor of the king
we Ride the sky, we fight the death
the only word is revenge

Antillius wants the end of the evil
The heroes fights this holy war
This is the time, the Second Fall
Is the revenge of Kaledon's sons

Revenge
Revenge for save the kingdom
Revenge
Revenge for fight the evil
