I remember when we fought together
against the hordes of Azrael
as a single untiring man
we fought the monsters of the nightmare

We commanded the force of the kingdom
we brought the light between the shadows
how many times have i saved your life ?
how many times have you saved my life ?

Then you have left to blacken your soul

[Chorus]
Azrael, (shadow of ) Azrael
slides on the Kaledon' s ground,
Azrael,( shadow of)  Azrael
it spreads the black wings over the sun

You have betrayed yourself and me
and sold the reign to the Mover of evil
You have dispensed the death
and drunk the blood of Kaledon's people

You have tried to kill me in the night
but the fate has called the Dragon
the light has struck you with his fire
you have seen your death coming down

Then you have left to blacken your soul

[Chorus]
Azrael, (shadow of)  Azrael
slides on the Kaledon' s ground,
Azrael,( shadow of ) Azrael
it spreads the black wings over the sun

to return to the life
after the death
you have become the undead King

I will find you,
Carnagus, I will burn you !
And I will make fall the Lord of the Holy Well of Souls

[Chorus]
Azrael, (shadow of)  Azrael
slides on the Kaledon' s ground,
Azrael,( shadow of)  Azrael
it spreads the black wings over the sun
