A new dawn for the reign
The light is on the King
A new life crosses all the land

Daeniel trains the soldiers
To create a mighty army
And the Guard of the new kingdom

[BRIDGE:]
The children of Kaledon
work with the swords
work with the lances
work with their life

[CHORUS:]
The sun clear the sky
The Dragon fly high
Over the numberless forces
There is the new Soldiers
For the new armies
The Dragon will make them invincible

The echoes in the valley
Of the clashing blades
The air is full of the friendly cries

An eloquence glance
Between Daeniel and the King
and then they look the Dragon in the sky
