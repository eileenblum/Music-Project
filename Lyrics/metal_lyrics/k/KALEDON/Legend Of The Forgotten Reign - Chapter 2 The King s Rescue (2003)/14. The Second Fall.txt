The sky is red above the valley,
the wind and the wolves sing my heart song ...

The armies are faced,
There is the fear in the air,
There is uncertainty,
There is the courage,
there is iniquity,
There is hate...

...hate between the two Kings,
they look in their distant eyes,
and me, Daeniel,
forever faithful to the Light,
I have sworn to fight forever every evil
I have sworn to myself !!!
Now I watch the King straight in the eyes and I give the order...
"Children of Kaledon, unleash the hell against the hell !!"

The energy
The fury
The howling north wind

The blood
The mud
The horses going crazy

An instant
The death
The hand that is relaxed

A moment
The madness
The life cast away

The beast
The cry
The sky trembles too

The angel
The light
The broken sky

Then I lift my head
and open wide my eyes
And I see my friends,
dirty and tired
I cry against the sky...
we have defeated the evil.
The Jackal runs away
afraid and alone
It's the second fall,
The revenge of Kaledon

And a solitary tear
Without intention
Hands by my fear
It 's the liberation...

I lift my red sword
for the blood
I sink my legs among
corpses and mud
I glance at my King,
I read an immense thanks
I read the true love
of the Father to the son

And a solitary tear
Without intention
Hands by my fear
It 's the liberation...
