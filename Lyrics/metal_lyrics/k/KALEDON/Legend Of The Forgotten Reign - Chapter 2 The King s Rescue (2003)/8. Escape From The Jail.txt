Inside the jail
I was alone
During this year
Fighting the void

Now is the moment
To escape away
And to return
In my kingdom come

[CHORUS:]
Escape from the jail, escape from this captivity
The force of the Dragon opens wide the gates

Out of the jail
The darkness falls
the way we'll find
To come back home

The wood around
Is scaring us
Running away
crossing the fog

[CHORUS.]

The way is long
lost in the fog
but with my will
we will start again

Now I am a freeman
and shine returns
through the high mountains
as far as my sons...

[CHORUS.]
