I'm the angel of the light,
The men call me "The Dragon",
One name among my names,
and the wind carries them away.
I am the Force of Life,
the Fire of the Life
that burns inside every shining heart...

My Great King, listen me,
I can you reveal
All your kingdom will be free
and we will be there together
This is the home of my sons,
This is the power of my love,
This is the burning, spreading flame,
The holy flame of Kaledon...
