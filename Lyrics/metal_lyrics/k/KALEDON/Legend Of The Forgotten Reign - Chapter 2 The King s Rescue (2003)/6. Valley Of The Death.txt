In front of the evil's castle
whitened by the light of the moon
Corpses of kaledon's sons
becoming food for vultures

The executor of the darkness
Kill the people for his lord
terror rises by his torture
he Drinks blood for his black power

In the night, vultures flies in the sky of the valley of the death!
Eats the dead meat, for power supreme in the night they always will live
Valley of darkness, valley of the death
Valley of the lost life

The children of kaledon
Killed by the hate
the hate against the life

From the hell "IT" has come
incarnation of evil's power
sons of kaledon was killed
sacrificed for Azrael

"This is my hell on earth
This is my kingdom come
I serve the One Black Light
Reign of terror for my great lord

In the night, vultures flies in the sky of the valley of the death!
Eats the dead meat, for power supreme in the night they always will live
Valley of darkness, valley of the death
Valley of the lost life
