I see the landscape run
And the wonder paint by the sun
I feel the wind on my face,
I ride the horse of my fate

The triumph of the twilight in the sky
And the pureness of the sunrise inside
I will bless my land again,
I will meet my heroes again

[CHORUS:]
I'm coming home alone
The king will be there again
The White Wolf run towards the sun
I will be there, my kingdom,
Your king is ready to action,
I promise you, my sons, we will have a second chance again

I have climbed the mountains of the lunacy
I have sailed the rivers of my destiny
I have seen the Black Death trace
the Jackal's walk and his fate

Now I am where I have to be,
here the light will reign with me
my kingdom mirrors my soul,
my heroes are my force

[CHORUS:]
I'm coming home alone
The king will be there again
The White Wolf run towards the sun
I will be there, my kingdom,
Your king is ready to action,
I promise you, my sons, we will have a second chance again
