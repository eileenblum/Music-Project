The undead King, the Jackal, invokes
a creature from the Azrael's womb
His cries from the high of the tower
make to tremble the ground ...with his power

The clouds race to cover the sun
not to let see who now walks
Under the Jackal's command
flies toward the golden ...towers of Kaledon

he grow mist and it walks between
the children of Kaledon , not seen
-IT slips into the golden castle,
-next to the Guards of the kingdom

Every cry of the children of Kaledon
it's for the dark pleasure of the fallen Angel
the pain will pierce through the heart of the Dragon,
Azrael will strike hard the light's Angel...

Invisible, IT takes Antillius,
Through his talons, the power of the stone
It's paralysed by the terror
in the middle of the fog ...they are as alone

in the same moment Carnagus shouts
and roars against the sky his anger
and the Kaledon' s light
in the middle of the fog...is carried away...

...and without Antillius the Great,
in the streets of the kingdom the terror is spread
Over one hundred thousand are taken,
Over one hundred thousand in chains...

Every cry of the children of Kaledon
it's for the dark pleasure of the fallen Angel
the pain will pierce through the heart of the Dragon,
Azrael will strike hard the light's Angel...
