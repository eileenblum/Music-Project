Ohâ¦Kingâ¦
Listen the Bearer of Light
This is the wayâ¦

Now that the heavy head
Has gone down
You have to wash the black heart
Of the ground
And to bless the place where
The cages rose
To dry the deception
Until the roots
So that the black shadow
Doesn't rise anymore

[Chorus:]
This is the way â¦
â¦the way of the Light
This is the care
To every pain
The only possible wayâ¦
Paved of courage,
Pain and gloryâ¦
This is the wayâ¦
â¦the Way of the Light
