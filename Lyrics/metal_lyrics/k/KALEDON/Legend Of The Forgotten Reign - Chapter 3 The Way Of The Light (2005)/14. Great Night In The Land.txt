On the top of the hill
The king scream: "victory"
We're near to the end
We're near to the light

Children of Kaledon
The wick is dead
evil troops too
Remain the last point

[Chorus:]
This is great night in the land
Now we will be bless the black land,
This is the last point,
the last point of the war

In the earth of the shames
There are tons of beasts
And with the holy water
They'll come to the light

We've finded the way
We've killed the "Slave"
We'll bless the land
The land of dark

[Chorus]

Search Azrael
Kill Azrael
Kill the evil in the land
Fight Azrael
Kill Azrael
Kill the evil in the land

Search Azrael
Kill Azrael
Bless the land of the dark
Fight Azrael
Kill Azrael
Bless the land of the dark

[Chorus]
