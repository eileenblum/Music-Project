I'm the Legend
I'm the Freedom of the Dream
I'm the Seeker
I'm the Breaker of the Rule

I'm the Example
I'm the Heart of the Man
I'm the Burner
I'm the Lord of the Sand

I'm the Tears of the Man
I am his White Sperm
I am his Coming to the World
I am his Forgotten Soul

I'm the Flesh and the Spirit merged together
I'm the Never Born Child, I'm the Future

[Chorus:]
I'm the Secret Desire, Unmentionable
Between Angels and Men, I'm the Devil
I'm Azrael, the Unnamable
But the men call me the Evil
