Why, IT, why ?
You have betrayed me
Where you are?
Why you abandon me
I run, I run,
The blood and the mud
I run, I run,
I'm the jackal that I am

The Black Beast
That I have called to me
Runs away in the sky
Then he falls down
And setting fire
Like a falling star
Like a falling angel
He sinks inside the ground

[Chorus:]
And Daeniel seeks and runs like a tiger
He is merciless, his force comes from beyond this world
And Daeniel flies high like an eagle
His force is the light, the inexorable sword

Why, why,
I am alone in this time
The mud and the rain
Sliding on my face
Why, why,
Has the voice deceived me?
The mud and the trees
Chain my escape

..noooo...
The sky and the clouds
Answer to my cry
Red, red in the sky
The wind howls full of anger
The light, the light
I fall down into the slimy ground

[Chorus]
