Son of the Earth
You feel a solitary god
When you look the stars
The stars in the night

Son of the Earth
You feel a strong sensation
The force that come
That come from above

Oh shining child
You always feel protected
And invincible
Like a Mars

â¦Because you are born under the obscure sign

[Chorus:]
Come with me
My lost child
Come with me
Join the signs
Follow your blood
Follow the sign

[Solo : Alex]

Son of the Earth
Your blade is the only one
That can reach
To my black heart

Son of the Earth
You are the only living man
That can defeat my powerful spells

Oh shining child
Kill Antillius for me
We'll rise up
Like a shining black star

â¦Because you are born under the obscure sign

[Chorus]

[Solo : Tommy]
