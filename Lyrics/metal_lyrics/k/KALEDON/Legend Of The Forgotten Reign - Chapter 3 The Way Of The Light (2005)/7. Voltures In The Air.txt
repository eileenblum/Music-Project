We must ear the plans
We must see their moves
We're the Azrael eyes
We're the Azrael serves

We must be alert
We must fly away
We are the black betrayers
We are the wings of death

[Chorus:]
Voltures, voltures in the air
Dreadful, dreadful Azrael sun
With your ears discover the plans
And fly away to their mighty lord

Daeniel and the king
No secrets for the evil
Now we know their moves
And Azrael too

[Chorus]

Telepathy is our force
We'll say all to our lord
And to Carnagus
Mighty plan of war

Darkness is with us
Power of Black Master's
Carnagus will know
All the White King will

[Solo : Alex]

[Chorus]
