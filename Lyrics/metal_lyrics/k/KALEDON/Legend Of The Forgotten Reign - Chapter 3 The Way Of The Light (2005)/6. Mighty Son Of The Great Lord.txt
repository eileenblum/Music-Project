My queen is dead
I have no child
And I am scared
For my kingdom come

When I will die
Who'll keep my chair?
I am very sad
Fro this misfortune

[Chorus:]
You will be my son and you will keep my chair
Daeniel, Mighty son of the great lord
This is my decision for the future of Kaledon
Daeniel, oh Daeniel

Thank you my lord
I am uptight
I have no words
For this great news

Today my work
Is to serve my great lord
Tomorrow I will be
His mighty heir

[Chorus]

[Solo 1: Alex]
[Solo 2: Tommy]

When I will die
I will be clear
Thank you my friend
For me and for all

When Jackal will die
I will carry out
This will of mine
With a big Rite

[Chorus]
