You knowâ¦Daeniel,
"Elisabeth" is notâ¦only a name
She was a spirit free
She faced the obscurity
And she raised her energy

You knowâ¦Daeniel,
A woman in brideâ¦with her destiny
She has lighted the flame
And the stars of your heart
By the love inside

Nobody as her
Knew to sink in the hell
Nobody as her
Knew to circle in paradise

[Chorus:]
In the Eyes of the Queen
Flash the eyes of the dragon
In the Eyes of the Queen
There were the eyes of the dragon
Ohâ¦I have seen, I have seenâ¦

You knowâ¦Daeniel,
The Queen was the onlyâ¦the only fair name
She was the queen of herself
She was the Queen of her King
Great silence inside

There was no vanity,
There was no arroganceâ¦in her glance
For this she was beloved
For what flash in her eyes
For the fire inside

And the fine one
Was the respect for the life
And the fine one
Was to look with the loving eyes

[Chorus:]
In the Eyes of the Queen
Flash the eyes of the dragon
In the Eyes of the Queen
There were the eyes of the dragon
Ohâ¦I have seen, I have seen itâ¦

You knowâ¦Daeniel,
She has died
Whispering my nameâ¦
â¦and going to the wonder
All the words cannot explain
Only the heart can feel the wonder

[Chorus]
