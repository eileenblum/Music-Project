Out of their houses
All the people on the field
With the sword in their hand
To help their mighty king

Mozul comes down to earth
With a shape of a man
To fight against
Martin and Daeniel

Great sword of wisdom
Hits the evil on its neck
Stabbed by one sword
Stroke mozul's falling down
The holy water on its face...
This is the kiss of death

Creatures now are dead
They'll return to hell
To remain there
In the centuries to come

Great sword of wisdom
Hits the evil on its neck
Stabbed by one sword
Stroke mozul's falling down
The holy water on its face...
This is the kiss of death

The destruction was very sad
But the king's rescue brought back our friends
The way of the light gave us the power
To fight against the dark

There was a big, big twilight,
It was called the twilight of the gods
And then a new era has begun
And this, my friends,
Is the last night on the battlefield
