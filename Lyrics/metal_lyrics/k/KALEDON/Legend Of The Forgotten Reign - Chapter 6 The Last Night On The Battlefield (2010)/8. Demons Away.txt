The battle starts again
This time is very hard
Victims for the reign
Victims for the evil

I'm near to the reign
Demons are with me
I'm near to the city
Demons are in me

Demons away, demons away
I return to shine
My soul now is free again
Demons away

Martin hits my horse
I am falling down
With soldiers on my back
Now I am on the ground

The holy water falls
It falls on my face
my soul return in me
Demons away

Demons away, demons away
I return to shine
My soul now is free again
Demons away
