The time in the valley
Is passing day by day,
Our soldiers train so hard
And they won't never fail
We're waitin' the right moment
To land our blow
But a dark shadow
Makes our hearts beat slow

Black clouds in the sky
Getting near and nearer
Darkeen our sight
Of a future prayer.
Now it's time to go,
Sorrow will be theirs,
'Cause our strong blows
Will send them on hell's stairs.

Sorumoth is on his horse
Riding toward us.
He was a friend of us
But now his heart is dark,
'Cause mozul moves him
Like a puppet in his game
And if we'll lose a friend
It will be mozul's blame

Black clouds in the sky
Getting near and nearer
Darkeen our sight
Of a future prayer.
Now it's time to go,
Sorrow will be theirs,
'Cause our strong blows
Will send them on hell's stairs.
