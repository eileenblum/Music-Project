In our town
Many wait Antillius,
But he won't return

Their eyes search him,
Tears start to fall,
Hearts begin to cry

Fire in the wind
Risks to fade away,
But our fol is a phoenix rising from its ashes,
From its ashes

Now that you know the truth,
We must return to shine
With Daeniel that guides us
Scream his name, right now

Antillius said
Daeniel should succeed him,
To lead the reign to

A time of peace
He will look from the
Heavens in the skies

Fire in the wind
Risks to fade away,
But our fol is a phoenix rising from its ashes,
From its ashes

Now that you know the truth,
We must return to shine
With Daeniel that guides us
Scream his name, right now
