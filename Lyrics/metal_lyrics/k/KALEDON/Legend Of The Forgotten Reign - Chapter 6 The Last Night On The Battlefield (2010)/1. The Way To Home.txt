Mighty swords high in the sky,
Screaming to start the way to home
Swords in the air
Carry on on our way
This is the last trip for us
Fighting the last time

We are ready to go
We must be ready to go
Our destiny is here
Our freedom is near
Today we'll come back
Come back at home
Soon we'll prepare
The final war

Mighty swords high in the sky,
Screaming to start the way to home
Swords in the air
Carry on on our way
This is the last trip for us
Fighting the last time

Daeniel gives order to go
The horses are now saddled
Swords are in the holsters
Souls are churned

Four big platoons are ready to go
The way to home is long
We are warriors on the road

Mighty swords high in the sky,
Screaming to start the way to home
Swords in the air
Carry on on our way
This is the last trip for us
Fighting the last time

We are ready to fight
We are ready to kill
We want revenge
For our land
