Last days on the earth
Last days in the sky
Many things together
Happened in this land

My destiny has begun
My sword is here to serve

I have the power to win
I have the power to guide
I am the king of the reign
I am the king of the sky

Thinking...Reflecting

Sadness...Rage

Giving up...Acceptance

I have the power to win
I have the power to guide
I am the king of the reign
I am the king of the sky

This is unbelievable
The fate was very sad
The kingdom is near

We'll start our revenge

My destiny has begun
My sword is here to serve

I have the power to win
I have the power to guide
I am the king of the reign
I am the king of the sky
