With my lord we are reaching you
My new soul will help to find the way
I have the orders to destroy their faith
Our army will destroy their souls

I AM SORUMOTH
LORD OF THE EVIL

Once upon a time a little lovely man
Once upon a time a subject, a friend
His soul now is black, his heart now is cold
The raid in his eyes, the demons in his mind

Mozul wants to attack in their own town
For the evil this will be a new dawn
Carnagus, Azrael this is for you
Their end is now very near

THE END IS VERY NEAR
THE END WILL BRING FEAR

Once upon a time a little lovely man
Once upon a time a subject, a friend
His soul now is black, his heart now is cold
The raid in his eyes, the demons in his mind
