Returning home with white horses
And with all my soldiers
Returning to our land, for the last time

Lean see in my hands
The green power of the dragon and this makes me
The strongest man in the land

Screaming my rage and my fury to the sky
Now we'll come back to protect our land
Fighting the enemies of kaledon for you
Mozul will come again to destroy and to kill

My responsability's very heavy
And this cause in my mind a big fear
And a big rage

But I know this fear is nothing for me
Because I have to save our land
With our great revenge

Screaming my rage and my fury to the sky
Now we'll come back to protect our land
Fighting the enemies of kaledon for you
Mozul will come again to destroy and to kill
