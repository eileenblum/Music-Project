The burden of sin weighs on my heart 
Abandoned and scarred, it ripped you apart 
Your truth was left unknown 

I kneel before the altar 
and pray my soul to stay 
Besieged and buttressed by my 

Seething inside my body 
The tortured role it played 
Kept secrets of our father 

You carried this burden alone 
Your truth and pain, now my own 
Why? 

And when you shared with open arms 
Your pain inflicted youth 
I, by not knowing, by closing my eyes 
Bear the weight of the lie and it kills me inside 

I will carry your name
