You brashly stole the innocence 
That should have all been mine 
Predatory animals 
are punished for their crimes 

Small towns hide the darkest secrets 
All are accountable 
Take your actions to the grave 
The depraved act in full 

From inside the serpentâs mouth 
Come lies that must be told 
To save that garbage from his grave 
The unrelenting wolf 

Stalking in the darkness he 
Bared witness to the deed 
Predatory animals 
Grow hungry when you bleed 

I see now that your well has run dry 
Abuser, defiler, serpentine 

Here I am at your door 
Now it ends. Settle the score. 

Godâs will be damned 
He did not see 
What youâve done wrong 
But she, I believe 

Cornered and still youâre fighting 
Upon the precipice 
Of your own undoing 
Kneel before me
