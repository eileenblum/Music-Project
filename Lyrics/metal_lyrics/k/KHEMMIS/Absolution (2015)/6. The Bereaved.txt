As I burned one 
Through smoke-lit eyes 
I pushed too far past a glorious high 
Into a void 
Devoid of light 
I lost control of muscle and mind 

And so I stepped 
Close to the edge 
My mandible broken on the end of a night 
Succumbing to shock 
I clung to my life 
Just as my tongue was hanging agape to my eyes 

And so I fell 
Into the night 
Psilocybin dreams 
Claiming my mind 
Into a void 
There is no savior 
Where is my life? Where is my darling now? 

Became lost from space and time 
And you were scared 
You saw my bloodied body 
Your greatest fear 
Had been fully realized 
I wasnât there 
Both of us saw the end 
And I wasnât dead 
No, I still had life
