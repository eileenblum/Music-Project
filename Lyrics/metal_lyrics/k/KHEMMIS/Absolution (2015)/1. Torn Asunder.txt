Searching our minds for the serum 
the one to crack the code 
And now I see the answer 
the hadronâs chamber, full 
Unholy institution, time and space undone 

I see the light, refracting into endless night 
Knowledge again destroys the world 
Our world is unmade 

Now is the time, to drink and say our last goodbyes 
Torn asunder into the void 
Mankind will fall 

Strip the blood from my marrow 
Tear my essence from its shell 
The cosmos reads us our tarot 
Watch as all worlds burn
