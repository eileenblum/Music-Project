I feel the ground crumble and water bleed 
Bags of grain must protect the deed 
Though riverâs straight and narrow 
The rising tide spells doom for all at riverâs side 

Clinging upon the gallows above her waves 
You and I both were sliding down 
The waterâs running faster, give up your self 
And weâll be praised for what weâve done 

Beneath the tides, there is nothing left of us 
See our bodies glide 
Beneath the waves, our cities become our graves 
Feel our souls divide 
Bring us the floods, wash us from this earth 
Succumb to the tide 
Our time has come 

Antediluvian
