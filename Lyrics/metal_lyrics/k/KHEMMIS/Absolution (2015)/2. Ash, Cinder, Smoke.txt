I ride through crystalline skies, blind 
driven by purpose to the apex 

Flung toward the sun 
Into the light 
I break down and pray 
With you in ash 
Cinder and smoke 
I forget your face 

I fear the nearer that I approach 
I canât give you to the wind 

To lay you to rest 
Return to dust 
I have to let go 
Five years have gone 
Wonât toss the urn 
Still hoping youâll return 

Suddenly with mind lain open 
Youâre offering me your hand 
but I know it is just an illusion 
At least until I reach my end 

And in my sorrow, this longing still remains 
Memories, not my own, haunt my dreams 
Now a void where once there was so much more 
Here your vessel and my guilt are now laid to rest
