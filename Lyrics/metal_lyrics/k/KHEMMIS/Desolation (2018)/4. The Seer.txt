Circle the skies in search of carrion
Silhouetted by a blood red moon
A silent seer preying on my mind
The lurking fear tears at my eyes

When the night falls and the fog grows
Seek the shelter of these blackened wings
Flee the sunrise so I wonât find
That I might rise on these tattered wings

Why would I raise my eyes to danger above?
I keep my gaze upon the graves

When the scavengers feast upon whatâs left
Only a husk remains, rotten and bereft

When the night falls and the fog grows
Seek the shelter of these blackened wings
Flee the sunrise so I wonât find
That I might rise on these shattered wings

So long beholden to heresy
And drifting away from the sun
Until the talons rip at my flesh
Lifting, I rise from the earth

I am grasping at air
For my earthly remains
When we thought we were flying
We were falling again
