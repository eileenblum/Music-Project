Have we gone blind?
I used to sing of finding light in the darkened skies above
No fleeting glimpse
All hope is bleeding from this shell
The wolves are snapping at all sides
Consuming fear

The faith I held is fractured like a mirror
Both sides reflect the darkness of the other
Without the will to look inside
We cut our wrists on the divide
And I am bleeding out with no one there beside me

No fleeting glimpse
No hope remains inside this hell
The noose is gripping at my neck with every breath
Our life is drained
Weâre being punished for our crimes
The executioner calls out a final time

Offering wealth and wine, take my hand and twist the knife
Weâre depraved and reviled, welcoming eternal night

The faith I held is fractured like a mirror
Both sides reflect the darkness of the other
Without the will to look inside
We cut our wrists on the divide
And Iâm retreating now into the silence of the starless skies

Into the starless skies

Eternal rest
Merciful death
