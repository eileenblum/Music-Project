Tormenting silence, the endless days bleed into
Nights where I begin to fade away
Burdened by failure, cannot remember why we
Hide within this fractured veil

Born of death, hiding just beneath the flesh
Desolate, this heart yearns for a reprieve
How could I pray for salvation?
When Iâm the only mourner left to grieve

Baptized in shadows, cleansed by the pain I bury
Betrayed by pretending Iâm alive

Born of death, hiding just beneath the flesh
Desolate, this heart yearns for a reprieve
How could I pray for salvation?
When Iâm the only mourner left to grieve

There he was laid to rest

Iâm dreaming of your call that will never come
Holding on by a thread
