So here I rest
Iâve come undone
Somewhere behind these eyes
Rising from the thorns
Beyond the endless nightmares
Thereâs still a soul
Iâm reaching out to catch a breath
To brave the storm

The fog is closing in
Upon a freezing night
Far from the love Iâve known
Give me the strength to carry on

Deep in the forest
I am alone again
A warmth begins to rise
Fighting back the dread
And when I close my eyes
I swear I smell the smoke
I used to know before the fall
And now youâre gone

Thereâs a fire
Set ablaze in my heart
Casting a shadow
On the cycle of thoughts
That pull me away
From the dance of the gods
Leave it behind me
To burn in the dawning light

Sure as the spring
Casts a light on the snow
I have awakened
To the ashes anew
Theyâre burning away
Though I yearn to hold on
Knowing that I can accept this life
Unblinded, renewed

Out of the darkest night
No one could help me find the way
But in the new spring dawn
I find the strength to carry on
