Burn the pyre to our daughtersâ pain
In the fire there can be no eulogy
Swine and sickness, shrouded in disgrace
Ordained sinners preying on her memory

Cast out of Eden
Her flesh a sacrament
Corrupt. Enshrine.
Upon an altar of her bones
Confess. Betray.
The sky is burning red
Renounce. Decay.
We lie beneath the stones

Salvationâs but the gilded door of the abattoir
One by one, all will bleed for her
Our legacy, a world reduced to ash
Souls of black â barren, diseased
Hide behind the mask

Hunt the vultures
Bring them to their knees
Bind and gag them, waiting for their fall from grace
In the darkness
Tear the mask away
Hollow rulers trading their power for decay

Cast out of Eden
Her flesh a sacrament
Corrupt. Enshrine.
We built an altar of her bones
Confess. Betray.
The sky is burning red
Renounce. Decay.
We drain the chalice

We â We are echoes of loss
Are â In the absence of light
Dust â Wrought of corruption, unworthy of redemption
Shadow â Tombstones, an endless grave

Fragments of root and bone
Time becomes our tomb
We are destined to rot eternal
Consumed by a world forsaken, we will not be mourned
