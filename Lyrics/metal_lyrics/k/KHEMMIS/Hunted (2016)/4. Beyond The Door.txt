No light beyond the door
No cure to be
Lying still, the darkness creeps
Spreading like a cancer in me

There is a light dancing upon the window sill
It draws me in and I begin to realize
This is no dream, I wonât escape the spreading fire
Immobilized, only my eyes can reflect my fright

No light beyond the door
No cure to be
Lying still, the darkness creeps
Spreading like a cancer in me

Awake but paralyzed
As tears cloud my eyes
Straining back in mortal fright
Breaking free from the binds, into the light

Lies canât exhume (Bound in chains eternal)
I am your tomb (Paralyzed at my core)
Eyes hide the truth (My body, my tomb)
I am your tomb (No light beyond the door)
