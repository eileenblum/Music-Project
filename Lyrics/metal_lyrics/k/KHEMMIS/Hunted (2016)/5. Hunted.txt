In the cold and lonely spaces between hopes and fears
Where psilocybin dreams filled my younger years
There lies a darkened shrine that harbors unknown tombs
Drawing me forth despite my inner wounds

In every night
There is a dream that I canât contain
Fears that Iâve held
Deep in my bones since my soul was conceived
There is no light
No sure escape from the tide

Here stands the man, watching
His fingers beckon me near

What kind of evil trick has brought me back to here?
A stone now is pushed aside that covers up my fear
Maybe I seek this place to redeem all my sins
Not just mine, but those bestowed upon my kin

In every night
There is a dream that I canât contain
Fears that Iâve held
Deep in my bones since my soul was conceived
There is no light
No sure escape

I see him
He comes forth
From darkness
He takes form
I see him
He is I
I am cursed
And I am damned
