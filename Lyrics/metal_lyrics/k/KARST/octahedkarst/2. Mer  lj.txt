[performed by Karst]KÃ¶vesd az Ã¡lmÃ¡ban kÃ¶hÃ¶gÅ jogÃ¡szt
MerÃ¼lj el lassan, kis BalÃ¡zs

Ismeretlen ember fiÃ¡t
TarlÃ³t Ã©getni tanÃ­tja

Ãs a kÃ¶zsÃ©g szÃ©p lesz Ãºjra
Minden sarkon Ã¡ll egy Buddha

[English translations:]

[IMMERSE]

[lyrics by KristÃ³f]

Follow the shepard coughs asleep
Immerse slowly, little Blase

Unknown man teaches his son
To burn the wasteland

And the village becomes fine again
On every corner a Buddha stands
