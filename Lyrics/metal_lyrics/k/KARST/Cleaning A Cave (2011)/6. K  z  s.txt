[lyrics: KristÃ³f]

Veletek kell Ã©lnem
TÃ¡rsasÃ¡gunk pÃ¡r kiszÃ¡radt nÃ¶vÃ©ny
Nem az a baj, hogy gondozatlanok
Csak nem Ã©rte Åket elÃ©g fÃ©ny

MÃ¡s tÃ©nyek vilÃ¡gÃ­tanak mintÃ¡knak
KÃ©rges, mestersÃ©ges csÃ¶vein Ã¡tbugyogva
Mutatnak Ãºtvonalat e korcs fajta gondozÃ³knak
Egyik odaadÃ³ tojÃ³ volt valaha, anya
A mÃ¡sik pÃ©ldÃ¡t emelt, kotorÃ©kukat kÃ¶zben
SzÃ¡rnyai alatt tartotta

EkÃ©pp prÃ³bÃ¡lta vÃ©deni
MÃ­g ki nem repÃ¼l
Amerre Å akarta

Ãles ez a lÃ©t s el is hiszi,
Aki csupÃ¡n kÃ©t vÃ©gÃ©t lÃ¡tja
Pedig egyenkÃ©nt bonthatnÃ¡ a
KÃ³rkÃ©peit ki

KÃ¶rÃ¼lÃ¶ttem
DrÃ¡ma a fÃ©szekaljban

[COMMON]

[lyrics: KristÃ³f]

I must live with you
Company's just dry plants, a few
The point is not the lack of care
But they haven't got enough light and air

Different facts glow
Through these tubes now
And show path to these mongrel
One of them was once a mother
Laid eggs before and kept warmth
With the other, that kept warren
Now mixed up, unefficient tender
Under his sheltering wings

False method of protection
Until flying out
As meant to be

Existence is sharp
And one may believe
Those that see
Opposite edges only
But could've also been
Split up as the ill's records in turn

Drama in the nestful all around
