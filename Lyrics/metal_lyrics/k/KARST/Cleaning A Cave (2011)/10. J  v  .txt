[lyrics: BalÃ¡zs]

LetÃ©pi majd az Ã©rett porszem
MÃºltja Ã¡gÃ¡n nÅtt semmit
Mellyel hÃ­mezte kÃ¶rÃ¼l
A tudat perifÃ©riÃ¡it?

Ãlted jÃ¶vÅ sÃºlyÃ¡t
SzÃ­ntellennÃ© szÅ±rte Ã¡t
Ãlted jÃ¶vÅ sÃºlyÃ¡t
SzÃ­ntelennÃ© szÅ±rt Ã¡t

Arat majd fÃ©ny, ha elnÃ©mult a szfÃ©rÃ¡k zenÃ©je?

MindennÃ© foszlik a fonÃ¡l
Mit lÃ©g helyett nyelt
Ãrzi sikamlÃ³s pillanatÃ¡t
S egysÃ©gÃ¼kbÃµl szÃµtt fal
GyÃ¶kerein sem tÅ±r mÃ¡r fÃ¡t

Ãlted jÃ¶vÅ sÃºlyÃ¡t
SzÃ­ntellennÃ© szÅ±rte Ã¡t
Ãlted jÃ¶vÅ sÃºlyÃ¡t
SzÃ­ntelennÃ© szÅ±rt Ã¡t

[INCOMING]

[lyrics: BalÃ¡zs]

Will the seasoned dustgrain tear down
Nothingness, grew on the arm of its past
Which embroidered around
The peripheries of sense?

Your lives filtered the weight
of coming to pale
You lived its coming weight
filtered you to pale

Will light harvest, when music of spheres turned to silence?

Thread dissolving to everything
Swallowed instead of air
Keeps its gross moment
Even beyond the roots of the wall
Spun from their unity
Can't stand a tree

Your lives filtered the weight
of coming to pale
You lived its coming weight
filtered you to pale
