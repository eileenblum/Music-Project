[lyrics: KristÃ³f]

Holding wires
Every daylight
Pre-requires

Compromise between swamp of ideas
Documental emesis
Pseudo-cultural crippled talk
(Of) the never really hungry ones
And the inner self
The always spinning half

Constantly searching
Supplemented to be
One

I don't want my snail projection
Lurking when you're
Dreaming with that sour skeleton

Sinus resigned
Finding some harmony by
Knowing you will play on my
Shin bone once

So bead a part for me
Bead a part for me
