[words by KristÃ³f and DÃ¡niel]

LÃ¡bammal Ã¡rkot
A rÃ©gi porba
TÃºl mÃ©lyre Ã¡s
BÅ±ntudatot szÃ¼l a halogatÃ¡s

A szilvÃ³riumbÃ³l
ElpÃ¡rologva
KÃ©sÅ, hogy Ã¡rts
BÅ±ntudatot szÃ¼l a halogatÃ¡s

SorjÃ¡ba sorjÃ¡ba sohase vÃ©gzel
SorjÃ¡ba sorjÃ¡ba sohase vÃ©gzel

BÅ±ntudatot szÃ¼l a halogatÃ¡s
BÅ±ntudatot szÃ¼l a halogatÃ¡s

[English translation:]

Trenching my feet
In the olden dust
Too deep it digs
Delay raises the sense of guilt

Evaporated
From strong water
Too late to harm
Delay raises the sense of guilt

Step by step you'll never finish
Step by step you'll never finish

Delay raises the sense of guilt
Delay raises the sense of guilt
