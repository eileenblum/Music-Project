[words originally by Steve Kuhn]

Now and then I think of when his teeth were so small and white
He laughed when he heard the songs in the distant night

Later on his smile was gone, his lips spoke of silent things
The least he could do was more than his life could bring

Oh what a shame, what a terrible shame
To be lost and found below the ground, beneath every child that play
His life were so short, it's hard to believe today
