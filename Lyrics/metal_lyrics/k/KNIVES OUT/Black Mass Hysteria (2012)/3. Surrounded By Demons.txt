Death rides a pale horse beside me
I am nothing but hopeless and surrounded by demons
Cursed by a violent possession
Feeding on perversion in a morbid orgy

Shedding my skin in this mortal illusion
Resurrected from the tomb and returning to the womb
I live eternal in the weak and the wounded
A ghost inside your heart, an echo in the dark

Surrounded by demons

Black mass, the midnight procession
Shape-shifting into madness, breathing heavy and out of control
Moonlit sadistic dissection
It's too late to repent as blood drops from the firmament

Shedding my skin in this mortal illusion
Resurrected from the tomb and returning to the womb
I live eternal in the weak and the wounded
A ghost inside your heart, an echo in the dark

And just before we disappear
Into thin air and far away from here
And just before we disappear
Into thin air and far away from here

Madly in love with the sick and the damned
You've made me exactly who I am
Madly in love with the sick and the damned
You've made me exactly who I am

Demons in the alleyways, devils in the streets
Baptized in fire and all hell is released
Demons in the alleyways, devils in the streets
Baptized in fire and all hell is released

Shedding my skin in this mortal illusion
Resurrected from the tomb and returning to the womb
I live eternal in the weak and the wounded
A ghost inside your heart, an echo in the dark

And just before we disappear
Into thin air and far away from here
Just before we disappear
Into thin air and far away from here

Surrounded by demons
Surrounded by demons
