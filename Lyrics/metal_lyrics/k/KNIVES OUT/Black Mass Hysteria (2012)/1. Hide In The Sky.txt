Save us from ourselves again!

Blood of Christ, sacrifice, god sent his son on a suicide mission
Lazarus, rise again, guilty are free thinkers of murdering religion
Blood-lusting clergy, comatose the parasite
Staring like a zombie into a blinding light
Follow me into the sea, reverse all evolution
Now the whole world deserves to die

Snake handler, holy men, pass around the basket, buy a ticket up to heaven
Misanthropic talent agency, feed me apathy directly to the blood stream

I can't find a reason to ever stop digging into my skin
I can't find a reason to ever stop digging deeper on the inside

Part the clouds and weave a disguise
Walk among the dead as the city breathes fire

Jesus Christ go hide in the sky
You are worth more dead than alive
The bread is the body, the blood is the wine
Kneel before the virgin as she bleeds from her eyes

Save us from ourselves again

Lead the weak to follow a fairy tale
Guilt filled command the obedient horde
Speak up disciple and tell me now
Exactly how he has saved the world
