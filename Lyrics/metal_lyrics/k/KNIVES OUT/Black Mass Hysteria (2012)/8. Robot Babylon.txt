It's judgement day you sinful and murderous pigs
Where is your savior now
The wrath of the ghost men knock at your door, as I hear you screaming
Now I'm the killer

Fire and brimstone, Sodom and Gomorrah, blood moon and famine, demonic hordes

Go, bury the prophets, raise up the dead
A pitch black sunrise, a hex on your head
God spawned the devil, lamb and the beast
The whores of Babylon, a ravenous cannibal feast

Relive the horror, a thousand plagues of hell
Morbid revelation, only time will tell
Sleep walking soldiers, march in the sun
A waste laid to rest, the end has begun
This prison cell is a house full of wolves
Lock me up now and swallow the key

Burning the effigy, a robot Babylon
Burning the effigy

Lie, cheat, steal, kill
God is dead

Robot Babylon, where is your savior now

Automatons go turn up the stars and cut up the sky
God is dead
Obedient androids come to crucify mankind
God is dead

Do you remember when you were raping the angels in the city of the dead

Androids of the seven hills, beating on the war drums
Rising like Atlantis, in the land of the skull

Lie, cheat, steal, kill
God is dead
Automatons go turn up the stars and cut up the sky
God is dead
Obedient androids come to crucify mankind
God is dead
