You're instantly in love whenever the blood flows
And smiling as it's dripping from your hands
After birth the spawn of a mother
You ignorant, soulless mother fucker

Countdown to 12 more years of bloodletting, we're in this together

Entertain me, you promiscuous Medusa
As you're climbing up the walls and bleeding everywhere
Nervous virgin in a vampire's wet dream
And i just sit and stare as you're bleeding everywhere

Wicked witch of the west return to the village of the damned
And follow your trail of blood back home
Time and time again, I question your existence
Perhaps just an abortion that survived

Only revenge is in my eyes, and this one is just for you

Entertain me, you promiscuous Medusa
As you're climbing up the walls and bleeding everywhere
Nervous virgin in a vampire's wet dream
And i just sit and stare as you're bleeding everywhere

One's comedy is one's tragedy
All your envy and your jealousy
Your ignorance is enough to keep
This circus freak far away from me
Among the fields of sorrow, the red river floods will rise high
Unsympathetic, my conscious is clear, you'll never be welcomed back here

Paved in stone and all alone, follow your trail of blood back home

Entertain me, you promiscuous Medusa
As you're climbing up the walls and bleeding everywhere
Sweet revenge is mine just as the tables turn
And i just sit and smile as you're bleeding everywhere

Blood everywhere
