A devil in a blue dress
Kill the lights and play that record backwards
You blonde-haired, blue-eyed American disaster
Slip into a trance, suicide is subliminal
Show me how you hate me now
Torn apart and all cut up
Drinking from that hooker's cup
Rose pedals on the killing floor
You're all tied up and wanting more

You will play the victim, like a sheep led to the slaughter
Sit quiet and obey me, prove that you can take a beating
Waking up to find a horse's head under the covers
Exhaust the swollen mistress, turning tricks while hell is burning

Nailed up against the wall
Fuck it, who feels responsible now
A mouth full of Armageddon, burn it all to the ground
Stigmata rising in the summer heat
As the bodies fill the dead end streets
Amidst the feast and famine, there's a mirror on the wall
Reflecting sunken, lifeless eyes from the hours staring at the sun

You will play the victim, like a sheep led to the slaughter
Sit quiet and obey me, prove that you can take a beating
Waking up to find a horse's head under the covers
Exhaust the swollen mistress, turning tricks while hell is burning

Haunted, possessed, and full of venom
Knives out, eyes wide open and there you are
All cut up

Candles, coffins and pentagrams
Midnight phantom with idle hands

Kill the lights and play that record backwards
Exhaust the swollen mistress, turning tricks while hell is burning

You will play the victim, like a sheep led to the slaughter
Sit quiet and obey me, prove that you can take a beating
Waking up to find a horse's head under the covers
Exhaust the swollen mistress, turning tricks while hell is burning

Swollen mistress, stay the night with me
I'll leave the money where it's easy to see
Don't close your eyes, we have just begun
Don't close your eyes, we have only begun
