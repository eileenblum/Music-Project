In this after-school special
The children never make it home
Hysteria, red skies and mushroom clouds
Hysteria, no where to go from here

21st century Armageddon is near

21st century Armageddon is here

Panic, panic, panic, relentless black mass hysteria
Panic, panic, panic, Armageddon 'til the break of dawn

Godspeed you tortured soul
Broken, bruised and beaten
Riding a headless horse into a non-stop suicide

Go write your eulogy in blood
All over the bathroom walls
Constantly cursed and denied
Please have mercy on me master

You're my only friend, and the walls are closing in
Sinking deeper into hopeless oblivion
Shy away the snake, your virtue is far more poisonous
And deadlier than he ever was

Manic, manic, manic, maniacal megalomaniac
Manic, manic, manic, sadistic thoughtless amnesiac

Godspeed you tortured soul
Broken, bruised and beaten
Riding a headless horse into a non-stop suicide
Do you remember what you said
When you were speaking to the dead
Constantly cursed and denied
Please have mercy on me master

You're my only friend, and the walls are closing in
Sinking deeper into hopeless oblivion
Shy away the snake, your virtue is far more poisonous
And deadlier than he ever was

Bombs away, I love the smell of napalm in the morning
Floating in limbo
Hysteria, red skies and mushroom clouds
Hysteria, no where to go from here
Do you remember what you said
When you were speaking to the dead
Please have mercy on me master

You're my only friend, and the walls are closing in
Sinking deeper into hopeless oblivion
Shy away the snake, your virtue is far more poisonous
And deadlier than he ever was

Death valley summer swelter
Desert sun and helter skelter
Goodnight, sleep well my love, there's nothing left to die for
In death I am eternal
One day it will arrive
To shine a homeward beacon
To be reborn into the light
