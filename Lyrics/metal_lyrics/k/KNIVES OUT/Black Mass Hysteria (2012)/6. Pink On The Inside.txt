You're now my new obsession and i don't even know your name
I've got your pictures up all over the computer screen
Lethal injection, you're the only one I'm dreaming of
I crave the destructive hit from the gutter down to the pulpit

Here, kitty kitty, come and tighten the leash
How about a little discipline for the violent beast
Swinging machetes in a crowded room, and now I'm coming after you

Pink on the inside, a sweet tooth for genocide
A heretic in the family tree, selling misery-flavored candy
Now scream my name and let me know you're still alive
Come taste your savior as my honey drips down from the hive

Bulldoze the mass graves, spitting fire from the burning hole
Haunted humanity, church bells chime the death toll
Get yourself a mouthful, choke on it and spit it out
Sins of the flesh, my love, will set this world on fire

Pink on the inside, a sweet tooth for genocide
A heretic in the family tree, selling misery-flavored candy
Now scream my name and let me know you're still alive
Come taste your savior as my honey drips down from the hive

All your dirty secrets preserved in formaldehyde
&gt;From the cradle to the grave, now no one will be saved

Here, here I am, feeding you right out of my hand

Ever since the second world war, you've had a sweet tooth for genocide
Ever since the second world war, you've been eating from the palm of my hand

Pink on the inside, a sweet tooth for genocide
A heretic in the family tree, selling misery-flavored candy
Now scream my name and let me know you're still alive
Come taste your savior as my honey drips down from the hive

All your dirty secrets preserved in formaldehyde
&gt;From the cradle to the grave, now no one will be saved
She tells me that she has a thirst for blood
A little of the devil's wine that flows inside of everyone
