After the kiss comes the deathblow
Oh, what a lovely day to die
Come sweetheart, let me count your stab wounds
It seems unlikely you'll survive

Lay down, I want to eat your heart out
To bring us even closer

Lay down under the bluest skies and blow a kiss goodbye
Calm down and exit with the light, there's no need to cry

Adorn the altar with white roses
After you begin decomposing
You define the essence of all beauty
Oh, what a lovely day to die

Lay down, I want to eat your heart out
To bring us even closer

Lay down under the bluest skies and blow a kiss goodbye
Calm down and exit with the light, there's no need to cry

You have been saving yourself for this day all your life

And now the moment's finally here, so come a little closer to me

Lay down, I want to eat your heart out
To bring us even closer

Lay down under the bluest skies and blow a kiss goodbye
Calm down and exit with the light, there's no need to cry
