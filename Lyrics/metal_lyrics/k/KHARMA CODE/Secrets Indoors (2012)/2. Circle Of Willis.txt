Stay away,
The more you crawl
Deep into the meaning of these words,
The more into the hole you dive,
Strangled by the feel that all you were
is keen to voice,
A Jekyll to your Hyde

Here, beloved thee,
No one to tame your rage

Fill my eyes,
Recalibrate my brain,
Try to skip the fence
And leave me drained.

Haunted by the memories of those now
traitors, unwilling to play by my rules.
They'll lie beneath my wall

Needn't know
of that freedom denied
by a puzzled state of mind
Needn't know if we'll die out
Like a bolt out of the blue.

Rip me off my skin
and wash my sins away and heal me now.

Needn't know
of that freedom denied
by a puzzled state of mind
Needn't know if hell breaks loose
Like a bolt out of the blue.

Time flies
My convictions stray
All my life gone to
Keep them at bay.

I tried hard
To undo my sins
to find out that I've
hit a dead end

Had I known
Of that freedom denied
By a strangled state of mind
Had I listened when they said
"as you sow, so shall you reap".
