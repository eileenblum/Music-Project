No day ever opened with a fairer promise
Without letting any clouds fleck the pale blue sky.
Desolate and vast valleys as the sun
Throws a single shadow over the earth
Kind of a celestial quest

The Human race is tracing its own line of life
We're witnessing a world playing dice, waging our fate.

No day ever woke up with such harmony
Just when the sky and ocean melted down into embrace
A little whisper could wreck the air
Defenseless to the end
Comes the calm before the storm

Nature seemed to stop and hold her breath
Atmosphere in motion
A prelude of a forthcoming rage
Broken Silence by arrows of ice
Hitting ground with violence
Roaring noise and destruction everywhere
Bring confusion, shatter every hope.

Anxious children creep into their beds, they're still afraid
Days of monsters in the closet seemed so far away.

While the wind whines overhead,
Coming from the hills
There's a huge light on the mountain

Nowhere near seems to be safe, on the brink of shock
everyone is seized by panic just as thunder strokes

While the wind whines overhead,
Coming from the hills
There's a huge light on the mountain

Acid rain runs over all
Lightning fills the sky
Seas will rise above the mountains

You were warned, the aftermath will mean
Our game of dice will turn upon ourselves.

Nature seemed to stop and hold her breath
Atmosphere in motion
A prelude of a forthcoming rage
Broken silence by arrows of ice
Hitting ground with violence
Roaring noise and destruction everywhere
Bring confusion, shatter every hope.
