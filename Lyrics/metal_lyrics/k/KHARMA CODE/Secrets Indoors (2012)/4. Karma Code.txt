[Part I: Between Here And Then]

Alone, in this peaceful place,
Things ain't the way they used to say
Torn apart by a naive disbelief.

A breach in
my faith reveals a new reality
bound of sense
once again.

The ache of my wounds has gone
"Welcome home"
One swears

[Part II: Before The Calm]

My last breath,
A continuous beep surrounds me
There's nothing but pain
I lie dead
But I feel awake

Blistering rage,
Lucid dreaming turning into a nightmare
About what's coming next
Cannot Move
Cannot Speak
But finally an inner force still remains...

Silent Cries
Walk their way across my mind
I could feel their hands caressing me
No more goodbyes to give to
all my beloved ones, it's time to leave
Why look back filled with regret,
Falling into-an emotional stress of self-despair
But there must be another chance
To be holding on to the end

Every feeling left behind
Fights against desires of flying
Why is human life so hard
When the end comes closer?

Colors vanishing and
Memories colliding in my mind
A new disclosed dimension
Tunnel vision starts to disappear.
Rage, moans and regret fade away.

Every feeling left behind
Fights against desires of flying
Why is human life so hard
When the end comes closer?

The need to crawl down the well-worn-path
Backing out from images and colors
Where is my home, where's my time
I want out and break down....and be again

[Part III. The Journey]

I am ready to embark on
My last journey to dreamland
So the treasure of my infinite will
is revealed to my eyes

I will rise through the fire,
the naked body of my dreams
hastening to find salvation
at the edge of this stream of life

[Part IV. Epitaph]
