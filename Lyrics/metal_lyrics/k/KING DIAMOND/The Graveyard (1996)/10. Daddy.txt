[Music &amp; Lyrics: Diamond]

Oh Daddy...I'm so alone, Oh Daddy...come home
Oh Daddy...I've missed you so
Oh Daddy...tell me what to do

Daddy don't look at me like that
I didn't do it...HE did...It was HIM
I could never...I could never
I wasn't even there

[SOLO: Andy]

Daddy tell me what to do...Daddy...No don't no

Oh Daddy, you're fading away
Oh Daddy, Daddy please stay
Oh...you're fading away
Oh Daddy, Daddy please stay

You're going down, you're going down, McKenzie

[SOLO: Herb]

Sit down you creep, you degenerate son of a sheep

[SOLO: Andy]

What am I to do you...with you ?

[SOLO]

You're going down, you're going down, McKenzie

[SOLO]

Sit down you creep, you degenerate son of a sheep

[SOLO]

What am I to do you...with you ?

[SOLO]

Sit down you creep, you degenerate sheep

[SOLO]

You're going down, you're going down, McKenzie
