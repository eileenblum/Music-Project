Christmas time is here again
Santa needs a helping hand
He cannot find a single sheep
To draw his sleigh across the night
So all the waiting Christmas trees
Gonna hear the master say

There's no presents not this Christmas
There's no presents
Tom and Jerry drinking sherry
They don't give a damn

Christmas time is here again
Santa needs a helping hand
It's getting very very late
Saint peter's closed the golden gate
And Donald Duck is still in bed
I wonder who is gonna help

There's no presents
Not this Christmas
There's no presents
Tom and Jerry
All that sherry
They don't give a damn

There's no presents
Not this Christmas
There's no presents
Tom and Jerry
Still drinking sherry
They don't give a damn

I'm dreaming of a white sabbath
