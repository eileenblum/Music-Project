Any Sunday morning, just before dawn
A little girl is dancing, on the mansion lawn
She calls out a name: "DAGON of the sea...
Appear from the darkest deep, and hear my need!!!"

Down by the lake there's a shadow of grief, dancing hand in hand with the devil

Watching from the bridge, the one nearby the lake
Oh sister Margaret, no need to hate
Oh yes we all know, that you're serving the cross
But this time my dear, well, you're lost

Down by the lake there's a shadow of grief, dancing hand in hand with the devil

And the nun has been seen:
"I want your cross, now come and play, Sister Margaret"

Full of pride, the nun won't give in;
She goes down alone, scared as hell
The little girl is grinning, "eehahahahaha"
When Sister Margaret... disappears in the lake

Down by the lake, there's a shadow of happiness...dancing hand in hand with the devil..devil...devil...
