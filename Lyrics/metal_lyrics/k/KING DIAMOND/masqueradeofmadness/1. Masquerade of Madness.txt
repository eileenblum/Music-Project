There is a girl in misery
And in sanity
Painting figures on her walls
Those voodoo dolls

I come to say goodbye
I'll take you down to number nine

Masquerade of Madness
Masquerade of Sadness
(Madness)

There is a masque for all the dead
And a masque for pain
You gotta leave your mind behind
Don't go insane

I come to say goodbye
I'll take you down to number nine

Masquerade of Madness
Masquerade of Sadness
(Madness)

...And when they come for you tonight
Darkness of the mind
Keep on the masque they made for you
Only speak inside

I come to say goodbye
I'll take you down to number nine

Masquerade of Madness
Masquerade of Sadness
(Madness)
