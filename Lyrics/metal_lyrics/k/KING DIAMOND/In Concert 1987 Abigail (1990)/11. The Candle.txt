[King Diamond]

Here I am blinded again by that flame
in every candle that I burn, burn
I see that same face return, It returns

Eyes in pain, my little queen are you a dream
in every candle that I burn, burn
I see that same face return, It returns

Time has come for you to tell the truth, what shall I do
tears are running from her eyes
if she could only tell me why, only tell me why

The Jonah, the Jonah

In twisted key she speaks a word to me and then I see
her face falling apart
the word "Jonah" is her mark, she's branded
