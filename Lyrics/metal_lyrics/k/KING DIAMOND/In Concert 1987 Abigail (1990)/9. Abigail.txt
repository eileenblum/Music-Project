[King Diamond]

"Abigail I know you're in control of her brain, Abigail
and I know that you're the one that's speaking through her, Abigail"
"Jonathan, can you hear me"

"I am alive inside your wife
Miriam's dead I am her head"

"Abigail Don't you think I know what you've done, Abigail
I'll get a priest he will know how to get her soul back"

"Oh, Jonathan this is Miriam
our time is out remember the stairs
it's the only way"

"Abigail nothing I can do but give in, Abigail"
"follow me to the crypt"
"Abigail you aught to be reborn where you died Abigail"
"Jonathan I agree yes I do"

"I am alive inside your wife
Miriam's dead I am her head
soon I'll be free"
