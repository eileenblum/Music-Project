[King Diamond]

"My mother was obsessed by evil jealousy
she didn't want nobody to even look at molly
she kept me locked up in this attic 'till I died
only 4 years old, my story left untold"
oh molly

"Mother was struck by this infallible idea
if she could paint my portrait I would remain immortal
and I could hang downstairs above the fireplace
a little girl in lace, not a single trace of crime, trace of crime"

"Each day and night she worked and autumn turned to spring
for every stroke she painted a little life was ended
at last I felt so weak I could not even speak
but in that fatal portrait my spirit came to life again"
oh molly

That night I made the portrait speak in evil tongue
"you're gonna go beyond too, may pain and death bestow you"
she grabbed a book and spoke aloud an ancient rhyme
while she burned the portrait in the candle of fate
oh molly

"I've gotta se ma"
