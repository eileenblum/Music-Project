[King Diamond]

"We are gathered here tonight
to lay to rest Abigail la Fey
whom we now know was first born dead
on the seventh day of July 1777

Abigail must be nailed to her coffin with seven silver spikes
one through each arm, hand, and knee
and let the last of the seven be drawn through her mouth
so that she may never arise and cause evil again
Who will be the first?"

"I, O'Brian of the Black Horsemen"
