[King Diamond]

Count de LaFey
uncovered his cheating wife
nine months of loving and sharing
oh it was a bastard child
how could he have been so blind

"No, bastard baby
will inherit what's mine"
another one of her affairs
had left him in despair

So he pushed her down the stairs
to die "no" she cried
in 1777 on the 7th day of July

The countess broke her neck
and the embryo came out dead
then he burned his beloved wife
and the embryo he gave a name
"Abigail you must rest in shame, rest in shame"

Obsessed, obsessed
with a strange idea
he wanted to mummify
the girl for the future to find and he did

So he pushed her down the stairs
to die "No" she cried
in 1777 on the 7th day of July
