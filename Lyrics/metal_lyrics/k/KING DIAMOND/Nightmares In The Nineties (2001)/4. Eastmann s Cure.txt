It was in the local paper:
We will cure your every phobia
At Devil Lake Sanitarium
We will make you feel you're right at home

No more sleepless night, No more unpleasant sight
We can recreate paradise
And you don't even have to sacrifice a thing

It only took about a minute's time
For poor old Harry to make up his mind
So he headed for Devil Lake
Knowing doctores were awaiting him

No more sleepless night, No more unpleasant sight
We can recreate paradise
And you don't even have to sacrifice a thing

My name is Harry and I am from the country side
I'm looking for a doctor, Eastman is his name

We welcome you with open arms,
We've all been looking forward to having you here,
At Devil Lake Sanitarium
You must always sign a special paper first

I will sign anything just to get rid of my fears
I just want to live a life, where do you want me to sign?

Right here on the dotted line
This will give me the freedom I need for you
At Devil Lake Sanitarium
You know we are the very best at what we do...
OH YES!

Now that we have got his signature
I think it's time to start the Eastmann Cure
So put him in the straight
I think Room 17 is still our whitest room

No more sleepless night, No more unpleasant sight
We can recreate paradise
And you don't even have to sacrifice a thing
