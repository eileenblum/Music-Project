[Diamond/ Diamond]
["Outro music" by La Rocque]

Same old wall, still hanging tall
Same old nail.. through my throat
Eighteen years came along
And this time I never
I never saw my Love

I'm going insane
THEY sold me to this little shop
Where I remain

Living Dead...I'm feeling like a Living Dead
Living Dead...Two blue eyes in an empty head
Dead Dead Dead

Eighteen years came along
And this time I never 
I never saw my Love
This life is NOTHINGNESS
Life on a wall, time to be called back.. to the Beyond

[solos: Andy - Mike - Andy ]

There's a rumour going around and around
They say The Puppet Master
Is gonna build another theater in London Town

For Kids
Run by his son and daughter
It's gonna be a bloody mess

Living Dead...I'm feeling like a Living Dead
Living Dead, Living
Forever on the same old wall
Forever with that nail going through my throat

All the children, who see me in this shop
They are scared of me, they say I'm looking sick
My eyes follow them
Never to be sold again

Life is never fair...Life is air

"Will I ever see his eyes again
Will I ever see him again"

Where is she now... "Where is he now"...
