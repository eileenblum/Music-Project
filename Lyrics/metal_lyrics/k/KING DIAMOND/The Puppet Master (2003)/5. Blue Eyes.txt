[Diamond/ Diamond]

I open my eyes...I can barely see
I got a feeling inside
No one's here but me, no one's here but me...Ohhh

I'm stone cold...I must be lying on a floor
My hands are tied to the wall.. An Iron chain, I can't move at all
Oh...I remember, I must be in the Cellar

My eyes are sucking on the Dark to lighten the gloom
My eyes are no more blind, I can see what's in this room

Full of skeletons, dressed in human skin...
They're sitting on their shelves, a cellar full of Sin..
They're made from humans

"Ahh.. Ahh.. Ahh.."

So many Puppets here, there are eyes everywhere
There are eyes I recognize
Oh no, it's the eyes of my love.. The eyes of my love
Oh Victoria Nooooo

[solo: Andy]

My hands are tied to the wall.. An Iron chain, I can't move at all 
Oh...I remember

[solos: Andy - Mike]

Full of skeletons, dressed in human skin:
They're sitting on their shelves, a cellar full of Sin..

I open my eyes.. I can barely see a thing
All the tears in my eyes, someone better say it's a dream

[solo: Mike]

"Blue eyes, blue eyes", blue eyes I recognize
"Blue eyes in the night"
They see nothing, and yet they're so alive

Blue eyes, they're so alive
All the tears in my eyes, someone better say it's a dream

"Blue eyes, blue eyes", blue eyes I recognize
"Blue eyes in the night"
They see nothing, and yet they're so alive
Yet they're so alive: yet they're so alive
