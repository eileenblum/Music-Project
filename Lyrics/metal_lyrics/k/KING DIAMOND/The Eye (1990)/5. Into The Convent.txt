[Music by: Andy la Rocque and Snowy Show]

Madeleine is running away from herself
Afraid of shame, she's crying out for help
To be clean again

No one cared and no one ever will
Her feelings were not shared, she wants to break the spell
and she's going

Into the convent, a smile on her face
Into the darkness to hide all her sins
Wondering what could go wrong in this place

[Father David:]
Welcome Sister, I'm Your chaplain
Down on Your knees and pray if You please
in This convent I'm Your master
Kiss My cross now dearest Sister
In the Name of ...

Madeleine is running away from herself
As father David said:
At comminion You must be undressed
Why did she go

Into the convent, a smile on her face
Into the darkness to hide all her sins
Wondering what could go wrong in this place

[Father David:]
Come along Sister Madeleine
Unfold Your wildest dreams, it's time to join and sing
Let the feast begin

That night she awoke to find The Eye
On the stone cold floor Why, She never ever would know why
But she put it on

Next day father David passed away
At communion time
Why, he never ever would know why
But he looked at The Eye

The eye of the necklace is laking it's toll
Inside the convent a soul will rejoice
