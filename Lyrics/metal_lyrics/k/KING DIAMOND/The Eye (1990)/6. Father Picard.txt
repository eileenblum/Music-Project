[Music by: Pete Blakk]

A new chaplain has arrived
Madeleine and a few other nuns
At the convent will meet him tonight

[Father Picard:]
Wellcome to my quarters, do come inside
Wellcome dearest Sisters, come into the light

I'm Father Picard, I'm taking over
Things will be different here
you are the four GOD has chosen
To be his angels in white
Drink My sweet holy wine

^Oh yeah come on it's not a crime
From now on every sunday this time
You will attend this communion of mine

Father Picard is hiding something
A white powder for the wine

[Father Picard:]
I'm Father Picard, I'm taking over
Things will be different here
you are the four GOD has chosen
To be his angels in white
Drink My sweet holy wine

The nuns freak out, lust in their eyes
From now on every sunday this time
Father Picard's in control of their minds

Father Picard is hiding something
A white powder for the wine
