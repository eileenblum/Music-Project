[Music by: Andy la Rocque]

Sacrifice, holy rites, secrecy and alter wine
Black candies burning low to the meetings again they go
Picard can't wait to take away another soul
Oh it's a shame, Picard was so insane

In the year of 1642, it came to an end
In 1642, imprisonment

Sacrifice, holy rites, secrecy and alter wine
Black death come this way, Father Picard will soon be going
He's ill, so sick, now his meetings are forever over
Oh it's a shame, they went along with his game

In the year of 1642, it came to an end
In 1642, imprisonment

Sacrifice, holy rites, secrecy and alter wine
The nuns can't take her blame
One after one they suffer a breakdown
Confession, confession, they confess to diabolic possession
Oh it's shame, even Madeleine has gone insane

In the year of 1642, Madeline was leaving hell in 1642, she
found freedom in her prison cell
