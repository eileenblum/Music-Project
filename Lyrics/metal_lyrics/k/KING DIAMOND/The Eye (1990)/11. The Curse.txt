[Music by: King Diamond]

I know what You're thinking. I can see through you brain
I know what You're doing, even though I'm far away

The power I get from the chain is mine
Only I can use it
The power I get from the chain is mine
Only I can use it

It was only yesterday, thunder rolling by, breaking up the sky
And the rain was pouring down
Pounding on my brain, driving me insane
I was drinking wine again, oh yeah blame it on the wine

The curse of The Eye, it will take you back in time
If you look at The Eye, it will take you back in time

The curse of The Eye, it will take you back in time
If you look at The Eye, it will take you back in time

I know what You're thinking. I can see through you brain
I know what You're doing, even though I'm far away

I know there's a bad side to the power of the chain
I know I'll be going back in time once again

It was only the 1st of May, thunder rolling by, breaking up the sky
And the rain was pouring down
The inquisition came, I felt the pain
I had to relieve it all in just one day

The curse of The Eye, it will take you back in time
If you look at The Eye, it will take you back in time

The power I get from the chain is mine
Only I can use it
