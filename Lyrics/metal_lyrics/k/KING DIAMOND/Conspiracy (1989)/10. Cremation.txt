[Music by King Diamond]

Whenever the dark is near
I will return from the grave
to haunt You...Godforsaken whore

The album "CONSPIRACY" is a continuation
of the story told on the album "THEM".

Once back inside the old house "AMON", King
watched his Grandmother vanish by the words:
"I bet You're dying for a cup of tea." Not a
trace did she leave behind. Nobody was to be
found upstairs either. The cellar was empty.
The entire house was empty. Only memories of
long gone friends were buried  on the  thick
dust that now covered the house.

It had been 18 years since King was  last in
this house, waiting in his Mother's bedroom,
to  be  taken  away  by Dr.  Landau and  the
police. He spent 9 years in an asylum trying
to get his mind  back to  normal, under  the
supervision  of  Dr.  Landau. Then,  finally
released,  he   spent  another 9  years   in
absolute solitude at a place unknown  to  us
(lie). During this time, he  never  saw  his
Mother.

Now, 2 weeks have passed since King  returned
to   the  old  house, wich  is  actually  his
according to his Grandmother's  will, and  we
think it is time for him to contact us again.
