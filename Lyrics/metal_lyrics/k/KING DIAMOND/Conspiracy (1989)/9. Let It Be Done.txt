[Music by King Diamond]

[Doctor:] "Who's gonna set fire to the coffin?"

[Priest:] "I think You and Your wife to be
should do it together, while I keep
the demon inside with My crucifix"

[Doctor:] "So it's into the coffin, use the torch
and then we put the remains into
his sister's grave, right?"

[Priest:] "Yes, let it be done"
