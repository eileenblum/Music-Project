[Diamond/Diamond]

In the dark she was so beautiful and white
Abigail was glowing like a diamond in the night
[J:] "I love you Miriam

...Oh my God... my stomach
... That hurts... there it is again... oh what pain
It's like someone's cutting me with a knife
...This is more than pain"

[A:] Ah ha ha, I put broken glass in your dinner dear
It's only getting worse from here
Time has come to say hello to fear
No more hiding from the sun, count the minutes as they run
Run away with life itself"

[J:] "What's wrong with you Miriam?
I'm hurting, please help me"

[A:] "Ah ha ha, NO NO, you're gonna die
This is so much more than pain, feel the Devil's rain
No more hiding from the sun, count the minutes as they run
Run away with life itself"

[J:] "I can't believe you're doing this... to me
...My God... I'm bleeding through my mouth...
...What was that? ...Oh No"
