[Diamond/Diamond]

You could see the fire burn, you could see the colours turn
From black to no return
The night began to cry, rain from the sky
As the mansion died

Oh no... it died... oh no... it died
Deep down below, fire would not go
The crypt is still alive, listen to the child that cries

I wonder what is wrong
It's so damp... and cold... in here, could this be the home of fear
There's something in the dark, that should be left alone
As if it had a grave of it's own

[Solo: Mike]

There's a body on the floor, I hope there is no more
I think I'm stepping in blood
Too dark for me to see, a dark you only feel
Dark that always must be

I see a child... now I'm blind... where did she go? Oh no
Deep down below, fire would not go
The crypt is still alive, listen to the child that cries

Where did she go? She must have slipped into the dark again
Not too far away, I see a light
And there is Little One, standing by the wall
The lantern in her hand is lighting up the coffin on the stand
Oh...
I used to know your sister, your eternal spirit twin
Oh but Abigail was way too busy with revenge
And now you're stuck in here on your own
A lonely soul who'll never ever find a home
Oh No

She cannot find her mommy, cause mommy's in the floor
And she doesn't even know... who her mother really is... oh no

[Solo &amp; outro solos: Andy]

Only I and a few others know who her mother really is
The Countess... The Countess... The Countess
"Mommy... Mommy..."
Oh she cannot find her mommy
"Mommy... Mommy..."
Cause she's buried in the floor
But it's NOT your mommy you're looking for

IT'S YOURSELF!!!
