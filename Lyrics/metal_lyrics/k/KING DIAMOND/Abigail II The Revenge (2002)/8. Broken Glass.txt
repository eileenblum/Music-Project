[Diamond/Diamond]

The storm was gone, but dark clouds still hung around
The perfect setting for things to come, late afternoon
She was still in bed after her visit to the crypt
Someone was calling Henry's name
Or was it only in her dream?

A dream of breaking glass, glass cutting into flesh
Rain turning red, blood running for the dead

[Solo: Andy]

Again she heard a name... it was louder, but the same

Jonathan was fighting his way out of bed
[J:] "Where is Brandon Henry and why is he late?"
[A:] "He didn't feel very well today
So I sent him back to bed and there he'll stay
But I, my dear, will cater to your needs
For you I will be the hand, the hand that feeds"

Abigail obsessed with her revenge
Her old spirit was back
It made her remember her dream of broken glass
"Use it in your scheme, the broken glass"

[Solo: Mike]

Broken glass crushed into sugar glace
Making dinner for Jonathan, Abigail was having fun
Would it be romantic dinner or slaughter of the lamb?
Would broken glass be cutting deep, deep into the flesh of a man?

Dinner was enjoyed by candlelight
And Jonathan was wearing his
Funeral suit, it put him in the right mood
Whatever it took, he would do

[Outro solos: Andy]

He was in love... he was in love again
He was in love... he was in love again
But Abigail would soon feed his love away
Feed his love away

"Dinner is served"
