"Mommy... mommy... mommy... mommy"

[Solo: Mike]

Later that Night in her Room,Abigail was drifting off to sleep.
All of what she had seen Today, was hard to believe.

Then the screams of a child in pain, creeping deep into her brain
Then the screams of a child in pain, she cannot find her mommy
And that's a shame

Abigail was quickly on her feet
Down the stairs and into the dark, Abigail was following the sound
And there she was: THE CHILD

It was clearly a ghost... the ghost from the gate in the storm
"Little girl, tell me who you are?"
"I am your spirit twin from years ago, I'm LITTLE ONE"

That brought back memories of Abigail when turning six
Sneaking out of bed, like she always did

[Solo: Andy]

Hiding in the dark, listening to the men
Tell their stories from way back then
She remembered the story of Jonathan

And they'd been talking about the Little One

[Solo: Mike]

Then the screams of a child in pain, creeping deep into her brain
Then the screams of a child in pain, she cannot find her mommy
And that's a shame

Abigail she knew she had to stay
Saving Little One and breaking the chain... breaking the chain
