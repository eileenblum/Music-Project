Nobody's inside the church but the bell is ringing
For no reason the floweres are dying

Deadly omens
Deadly omens

Inside the mansion the air is unbearable, a rotten smell
In the dinning room the table is set for 3

Deadly omens
Deadly omens

[Solo: Mike]
[Solo: Andy]

"Miriam come here and see what I've found, it's moving
An empty cradle swaying in the air
I did not bring it in here, now did You?"

"No, no, no."

Deadly omens
