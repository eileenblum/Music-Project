The light is hurting my eyes
It was in the dark
I know I'm alive
I am burning for you
Yeah you know it's true
Voices are calling in the night
Breaking the chain between our lives
I see your face I recognize
Darkness you are a holy Shrine
The night awakens the mind
That is where we all meet
The one's left behind
I am burning for you
Yeah you know it's true
Voices are calling in the night
Breaking the chain between our lives
I see your face I recognize
Darkness you are a holy Shrine
Voices are calling in the night
Breaking the chain between our lives
I see your face I recognize
Darkness you are a holy Shrine
The night awakens the mind
That is where we all meet
The one's left behind
I am burning for you
Yeah you know it's true
Voices are calling in the night
Breaking the chain between our lives
I see your face I recognize
Darkness you are a holy Shrine
I am burning for you
I am burning for you
