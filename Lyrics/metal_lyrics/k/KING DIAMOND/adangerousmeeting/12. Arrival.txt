"That must be it"

Through the summer rain of 1845
The coach had finally arrived
To the valley where the crossroads meet below
And where all darkness seems to grow
People blame it on the Hill
The hill where no one dares to go...
The Mansion

The coach had stopped and from the window you could see
7 horsemen in the night
Miriam Natias and Jonathan LaFey
Saw the magic in their eyes
They were in for a surprise
The darkness would soon be complete
A horseman came forth from the dark

"We know You've come to inherit what's Yours...
The Mansion
Take our advice and go back on this night
If you refuse 18 will become 9... Oh No"
Oh 18 is 9

Jonathan laughed and said, "Get out of my way.
I don't believe a word You say."
The 7 horsemen disappeared into the night
and said, "Someday You'll need our help my friend."

I think poor Jonathan was scared

18 is actually 9...
It stuck in his mind
