Late that night I awoke from My sleep
Hearing unknown voices laughing insane
Grandma' was one, Oh it's coming
from the room next to mine

It's Grandma' room... the invisible guests

As I stood there alone in the dark
Peeking through the keyhole, couldn't believe My eyes
I'd never seen anything like it, only
Grandma' was inside the room

Speaking to no one... the invisible guests

Cups were rising in thin air and then emptied on the floor
Suddenly the door was open and Grandma' said
"Do come in My little friend"

Missy and Mother were sleeping downstairs
If they could see me in Grandmother's chair

Grandmother said "look Me deep in the eyes
You will forget what You saw here tonight"

"I will let You in on the secret of this house
The secret of Amon... that's what we call this house
Now I want you to go back to sleep,
now go back to sleep My dear"

The invisible guests

Cups were rising in thin air and then emptied on the floor
Suddenly the door was open and Grandma' said
"Now you must go back to sleep"

"Go to sleep"... "Go to sleep"...
"Go to sleep"...

Missy and Mother were sleeping downstairs
If they could see me in Grandmother's chair
