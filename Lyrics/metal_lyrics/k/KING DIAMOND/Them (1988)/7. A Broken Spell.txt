I stumbled out of Grandma's room,
down the stairs and out of the house
Once outside I felt My mind begin to
fight a battle for control

With the tea pot broken I kind of
realized
That "THEIR" power was less here,
here on the outside

I fell to my knees in haziness
And I looked in through the window
to the cellar

Things were moving down there,
"THEY" were searching for something
And "THEY" really found it,
the big axe was flying

Flying out through the cellar door
Up the stairs to the kitchen...
Then I passed out

The next thing I remember seeing was
the smoke coming from the chimney
I soon realized the smoke I saw was
actually... Oh No!
All there was left of Missy and her
dress, poor little girl

The spell was broken, I really felt the
change
As my mind and body became one
again

The moon was alive with its silvery
eye
Staring right into My evil heart

I went back to see if My Grandma'
was still there
Waiting for me in the attic... Oh I hate
that bitch
