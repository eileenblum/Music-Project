Look, the old bitch is back - yeah,
finally we'll get some company again
the attic room has been
locked up for far too long - just like the
old bitch herself - she's on time
though - why that silly wheelchair?
Oh she's pretending as always - but
she does make a good cup of tea.

"Oh My God she's here. Missy, listen
to what Mother says: Now You be
good to Grandma; and remember
she's been away on a long vacation.
That goes for You too King. And stop
playing that thing. Answer the door"
