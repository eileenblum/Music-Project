Morning came and so did they, flying
questions from the police
I'm waiting here in an ambulance for
Dr. Landau
To return and tell me why they're
taking me so far away
"I did what I did and I'm glad I did,
'cos I could have been the...
I could have been the next in line"

Nobody found a trace of Missy
I'd be the last to tell them anyway
How could I ever ever explain

Now I hear "THEM" again, singing
Twilight symphony, twilight
I hear "THEM" again, singing
Twilight symphony, twilight

Grandma' was dead with an open neck
Blood still running from My open
mouth
I knew they would blame it, they
would blame it all on me
How could I ever ever explain

Now I hear "THEM" again, singing
Twilight symphony, twilight
I hear "THEM" again, singing
Twilight symphony, twilight

Dr. Landau returned, and I told him the
story
"Are You mad or just insane?"
I tried anyway
"You can take him away now, the boy
has lost his mind"
Oh no no

I haven't seen My Mother since they
took me away
And Dr. Landau wouldn't tell me
He wouldn't tell me anything
Oh I'm back on the outside

Time has caught up with me, and I
must leave for the old house
Yes I must leave now
Grandma'... I'm coming
I'm coming home now
I'm coming home now
