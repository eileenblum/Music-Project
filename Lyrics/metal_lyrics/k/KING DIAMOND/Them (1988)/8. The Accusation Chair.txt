I kind of knew that she would be
waiting for me in her room
With a sick smile she told me not to
be a fool
Her eyes went hard, staring right into
My brain
But I convinced her that I was feeling
real fine

Oh, I was lying... seeing the look in
her eyes
Clearing My mind was important

She believed everything I said
And then she asked me if I would help
to bring her outside

Oh, I was lucky... "let us stay for a
while" she said
"Bathing ourselves in the moonlight"

So there she was, unprotected by
"THEM"
I grabbed her cane, and tore it out of
her hand
"No way, You're not going to escape"

"Now that I've got You... here You will
pay for Your deeds
Your sick mind has come to an end
now"

"Stop it"

Nowhere to hide, Grandma' had died
Alone in the night
And "THEY" were waiting for me
waiting inside
Hoping that I would come back in
But I just ran away
Into the woods, as far as I could
I saw "THEIR" eyes
And then I fainted again, going insane
Dreaming that I was one of "THEM"...

I hear "THEIR" voices all the time
