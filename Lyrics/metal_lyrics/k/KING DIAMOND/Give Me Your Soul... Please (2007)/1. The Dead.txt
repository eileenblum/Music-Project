[Diamond / Diamond]

Heaven... or Hell
Heaven... or Hell

Where are we now? What is this place?
"Don't you remember little brother? We died... we're dead"
But what are they gonna do to me? Am I going to Hell?
"I don't know, but that's what THEY say
I will try to find you another soul"

"Listen... do you hear that organ play?"
"I must go to where the organ plays
I must go but I can never stay...
Now to this house I go"

Don't let anyone see your bloody dress
