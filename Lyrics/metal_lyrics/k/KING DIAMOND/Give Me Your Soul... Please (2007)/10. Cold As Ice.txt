[Diamond / Diamond]

Cold and wet, I'm sitting on my bed... Ah

Colder and colder
The candles burning in my room are getting weaker
Darker and darker
The shadows dancing on the wall are growing taller

Cold as ice, this room is cold as ice, and growing colder

Colder and colder
My skin is slowly turning blue, I'm frozen over
Darker and darker
The Dark is slowly creeping in, It's taking over

Cold as ice, this room is cold as ice, and so am I...

My breath is slowing... and yet, it's summertime
The Dark is moving
It's as if... The shadows have a life of their own
As if the shadows have a life of their own

... Cold As Ice... I'm Cold As Ice... Cold As Ice.... So Cold

[Solo : Andy -- Mike]

Colder and Colder
The spirits waiting in my room are growing stronger
Darker and darker
The Dark is like an open door, inviting THEM into your home

Cold as ice, this room is cold as ice, and so am I...

My breath is slowing... and yet, it's summertime
The Dark is moving
It's as if... The shadows have a life of their own
As if the shadows have a life of their own

... Cold As Ice... I'm Cold As Ice... Cold As Ice.... So Cold
Uhhh... Cold As Ice... Uhhh... So Cold
