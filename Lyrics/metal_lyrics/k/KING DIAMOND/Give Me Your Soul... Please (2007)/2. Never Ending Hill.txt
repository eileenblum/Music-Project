[La Rocque / Diamond]

[Theme solos : Andy]

Time is never ever standing still, except on Never Ending Hill.
From here you can see Devil Lake
The velvet sunset is never too late

Never Ending Hill is where I live, The Old Oak Tree is standing still.
Can you hear the birds singing in the trees?
Can you hear the wind shaking all the leaves?

Take a look at the sky
Golden clouds are moving right by my eyes
Black Cat Magic is down by the lake
Chasing butterflies that can't get away

[Solo : Mike]

Now the sun is slowly going down
I can hear... Devil Lake is quiet now
Magic... Magic come home
Say goodbye to your butterfly 'cause night time is coming our way

Time is never ever standing still, except on Never Ending Hill.
From here you can see Devil Lake
The velvet sunset is never too late

Take a look at the sky.
Golden clouds are moving right by my eyes
Black Cat Magic is down by the lake
Chasing butterflies that can't get away

[Solo : Andy]

Ah... Darkness coming
Ah... Sun is drowning, drowning in Devil Lake.
Ah... Magic come in
Ah... Light is fading, oh yeah its getting late.
