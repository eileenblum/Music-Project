[Diamond / Diamond]

The girl in the bloody dress, appearing right before my eyes
The girl in the bloody dress, crossing over from the other side

I see the moon in the black of night
I see her dirty face, oh
The little girl in the bloody dress... closer... and closer

I feel her eyes in my soul
Looking around seeing all I have done
All I have done with my life

The girl in the bloody dress, I know why she's here tonight
The girl in the bloody dress, looking for
Something deep inside my mind

I see the moon in the black of night
I see her dirty face, oh
The little girl in the bloody dress... closer... and closer

I feel her eyes in my soul
Looking around seeing all that I have done
All I have done... with my life

"Do not be afraid there won't be any
pain, I... Need your soul"
No no no, my soul is full... of SIN

[Solo : Andy]

The girl in the bloody dress, she's hiding her hands in the dark
The girl in the bloody dress, carrying the Devil's mark

I see the moon in the black of night
I see her dirty face, oh
The little girl in the bloody dress... closer... and closer

I feel her hands on my own
Holding them down, they are so full of blood
Her brother's blood
And my soul is no good at all, you got to move on now
You gotta move on before the dawn is here

[Solo : Mike]

I feel her hands on my own
Holding them down, they are so full of blood
Her brother's blood... Red

"I know I let my brother down, to Hell... He must go"
No no no... You still have time... Tick... Tock
