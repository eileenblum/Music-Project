[Music by La Rocque/Lyrics by King Diamond]

My family just couldn't wait, I should have seen it coming
What a nice conspiracy, what a nice surprise
But now it's all too late
I am six feet under, It's so very hard to breath
My family, they put me here in a coffin made of glass
So I can see them in their glory or they can see me in my misery
They're standing all around my grave

Six feet under, I'm in a coffin made of glass
Six feet under, It's so very hard to breath

Six feet under, I'm in a coffin made of glass
Six feet under, It's so very hard to breath
My hands are turning blue
While my nails are turning to red

Looking up into faces of greed
I'm sweating cold and white with fear
Sinister smiles upon their lips
One of them is waving me goodbye
I am six feet under, it's so very hard to breath
My lovely sister is laughing at me, I cannot hear but I can see
Now she is kicking soil into my face
I swear I will return to haunt her

Six feet under, I'm in a coffin made of glass
Six feet under, It's so very hard to breath
My face is turning blue
While my eyes are turning to red
