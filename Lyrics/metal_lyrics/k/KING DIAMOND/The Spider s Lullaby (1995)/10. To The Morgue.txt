[Music by La Rocque/Lyrics by King Diamond]

To the morgue... Take him to the morgue
To the morgue... Take him to the morgue

At Devil Lake Sanitarium
Many a patient had died in vain
Never a question to be asked, no no
Never a thing to explain
So they took his bones and skin
To the morgue in the West Wing
It was clear to Dr. Eastmann
Harry had died of fright
If he had cared he would have found the spider
Laying eggs in Harry's neck

The smoldering eyes in Harry's head
Had become the home of spiders instead

To the morgue... Take him to the morgue
To the morgue... Take him to the morgue
To the morgue... We must all go to the morgue
To the morgue... We must all go to the morgue

Deep down below the ground
Where it was kind of cold and damp
Too many stiffs to be fit in the cooler
Gathering dust in the hallways of Death

The smoldering eyes in Harry's head
Had become the home of spiders instead

Spiders here... Spider's everywhere
Spiders feeding the dead to thier young
Spiders here... Spider's everywhere
Spiders using the dead for thier home

Spiders... they're growing like rats from the plague
Spiders... there's so many more everyday

Summer is coming to an end
And the celler in the morgue is a nest now
One thousand poisonous creatures
Eight thousand poisonous legs!

The smoldering eyes in Harry's head
Had become the home of spiders instead

To the morgue... We must all go to the morgue
To the morgue... We must all go to the morgue
