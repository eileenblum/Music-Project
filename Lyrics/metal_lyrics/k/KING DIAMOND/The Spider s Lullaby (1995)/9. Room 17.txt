[Music &amp; Lyrics by King Diamond]

Room 17 was nice and cool, oh yeah
A few stains on the wall
But that was nothing new to Harry's head
Even though he was strapped down to his bed
...Strapped down...
Harry felt preety good...
Knock Knock...
Knock knock... Is anybody there?

Room 17 was nice and cool, oh yeah
But it didn't have the string that would ring the nurse
It wasn't there
Poor Harry, he had it coming
Poor Harry...
Sow he didn't feel so good

Here comes Doctor Eastmann and Nursie Needle Dear
Look at wat they got you... THE CRAWLY BOX

[NURSE:]
"Don't be such a baby, Harry stop that now
The doctor's here to help you... it's Eastmann time!"

In room 17, everything is so clean
In room 17, there is nothing to be seen

[Dr.EASTMANN:]
"Black, brown, grey and hairy...
We've got them all
Big, small, fast and scary...
Yeah, we've got them all
I can hear it, the Spider's Lullaby
I can feel it, the Spider's crawl on by"

In room 17, everything is so clean
In room 17, there is nothing to be seen

[Dr.EASTMANN:]
"Nurse Needle, it is time to begin
Nurse Needle, stick it in
A brown Lycosa's what I've got inside this box
I'm gonna let him out to see just how you feel
When he's around
If you move too much he might just bite you
But we'll just have to wait
And see about that..."

Deep into the night, they were testing him
So many different species, Harry could not win

They forgot the grey one, she was full of eggs
And she would find a warm spot back in Harry's neck
It's so moist and warm in here
Knock Knock...
Knock knock... Is anybody there?

[HARRY:]
"You forgot some spiders in my room yesterday
Now I've got this stunning pain
And my neck is feeling weird, Oh I might die
Overnight some of your spiders must have bit me
They were all over me!"

[Dr.EASTMANN:]
"Oh Harry, don't be such a fool."

That same night Harry died
When they found him he was grey and white

Black, brown, grey and hairy...
We've got them all
Big, small, fast and scary...
Yeah, we've got them all
I can hear it, the Spider's Lullaby
I can feel it, the Spider's crawl on by

In room 17, everything is so clean
In room 17, there is nothing to be seen

Take him to the morgue
Take him to the morgue...
