[La Rocque/Diamond]

1932, North of Baton Rouge
Louisiana nights are darker than before
Along the Mississippi, that is where it is
The old colonial house, a mansion if you will

White as snow, the mansion still seems to have its glow

And when the moon is full and white
You can hear the drums of voodoo echo in the night

In the "LOA" house, misery will strike again

Jean le Noir, the first to own this house
He was a voodoo priest, a Houngan so they say
The voodoo cemetery, that is where he is
Died at the hand of an evil Bokor's will

They say... he's been walking the house ever since that day

And when the moon is fool and white
You can hear the drums of voodoo echo in the night

In the "LOA" house, misery will strike again

[solo Andy-Herb]

They never should have come, no no no
They never should have come to the "LOA" house
They never should have come, no no no
They never should have come to the "LOA"

7 days ago... the Lafayettes moved in
Sarah is with child, and David is the man
This is no Abigail, this child will survive
And Grandfather dear, why did they bring him here?

White as snow, that is all he sees, oh he's been blind for years

[solo Andy]

They never should have come, no no no
They never should have come to the "LOA" house
They never should have come, no no no
They never should have come to the "LOA"

And when the moon is fool and white
You can hear the drums of voodoo echo in the night

In the "LOA" house, misery will strike again
In the "LOA" house, misery will strike again

And again...and again...and again...and again...
