Drakkar
From the northcoast - heading southwards
Like a greedy wolfpack

Shores
Unsuspecting - approaching longboats
Out of the dim

Stormwhips
(And) every rowpull - urges us nearer
On our brutal journey

Cgir!
Lead our plunder - calm the ocean
Let us take the stormlead

Strandhagg!
Raging pagans - devastation!
Begging monks around us

Assault
Inflammation - false believers
All their prayers grew silent

Odin!
One-eyed warlord - our master
Bless our sacrifice

Norsemen
That we were - that we are
And that we'll always be

Windlord! Smell our sails! Guide our trails... to fearful shores
Warlord! Bless our blades! Grant us grades... in thy hall up high

Strandhagg is beginning of the end
