So I've become the roaming outcast
Omnipresent like meteor dust
I call upon comets to strike down
Everything that makes me frown

In this world of tongue and minor deed
Where they harvest a hallow fruit without seed
Where kings guide fools eyes wide shut
My scythe shall leave these plains clear-cut

At the edge of my very life path
At the dawning of endless mind wrath
I cast away my rusted blade
For that inner hero's gonna fade
There's a swarm of insects approaching
With a virgins mind they're poaching
Sent from the forked tongue divine
The stinger's poison will be mine

Swarmwalls pile up towards the sunwheel
Hive falls black up a world of no heal

Those years I have wasted
Through decades of longing
But now I will celebrate my rebirth
The cocoon is open and I'm gonna rise
And my wings beat will cause the greatest gale on Earth

My scourge will disinfest the rope of sand
I cure this errant planet in my hand
A bladestorm born out of drone wings
A black rain from scorpion stings

At the edge of my very life path
At the dawning of endless mind wrath
I cast away my rusted blade
For that inner hero's gonna fade
There's a swarm of insects approaching
With a virgins mind they're poaching
Sent from the forked tongue divine
The stinger's poison will be mine

Swarmwalls pile up towards the sunwheel
Hive falls black up a world of no heal

Those years I have wasted
Through decades of longing
But now I will celebrate my rebirth
The cocoon is open and I'm gonna rise
And my wings beat will cause the greatest gale on Earth
