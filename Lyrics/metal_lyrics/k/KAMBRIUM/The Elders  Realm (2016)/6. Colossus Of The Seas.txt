No more grace
I will leave no trace
On and on
Across my riffs of thorns

You brought the witch
That dirty snitch
So now let's see
If you can take on me

Now get down on your knees
And pray for the one
I am the colossus of the seas

Live and see me as your god
Fight and you will rot
You are my eternal servants

The lake is mine
My dark lights shine
Upon your hope
Awareness broke

The vanished once
will rise again
And a witch can't stop
what a god will reign

Now get down on your knees
And pray for the one
I am the colossus of the seas

Live and see me as your god
Fight and you will rot
You are my eternal servants

I am the center of your world
The one and only purgatory rise

The witch, a whore
Her spells won't harm my plan
The waves collide
And you will die in vain
