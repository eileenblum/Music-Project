Embrace my soul
My sacrifice now

A voice is calling me
Rise again

Betrayed by my own reflections of ice
I stumbled through shades
and despair was my guide

I followed a path to the witch of sea
A lake so deep
and emptiness I feel

All I was and all I am
is gone forevermore
I will drown

Nothing more than dust will rise
A kingdom falls and takes the crown
I'm wondering where I will go
My heart still beats
but will be gone

The elders' realm will fade away
A void will reign
Can't see the dawn

Remember my name
So I will rise again

I - Will - Rise - Now
I - Will - Die - Now

A voice is calling me
Rise again

Betrayed by my own reflections of ice
I stumbled through shades
and despair was my guide

I followed a path to the witch of sea
A lake so deep
and emptiness I feel

Everything around me will fall
Everything will die
Everything is turning to black
Everything is pale

Nothing around me will stay
Nothing will save me anymore
Nothing will survive
Nothing will remain
All will die

Everything around me will fall
Everything will die
Everything is turning to black
Everything is pale

Nothing around me will stay
Nothing will save me anymore
Nothing will survive
Nothing will remain
I'm still blind
