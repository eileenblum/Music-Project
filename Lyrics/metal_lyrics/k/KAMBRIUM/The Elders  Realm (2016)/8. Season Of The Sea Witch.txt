I walk on broken souls, victims of my witchcraft
Take their lives, make them mine, suffocate in silence
Raped by fear, shades are here, rest in me forever
Look into the face of death, realize it's too late

Whispering words of hell, sacrifice all your being
My tempting voice is leading you
Conjuring my own demons

Cursed by the witch of the sea
Spellbound
Out of her cave she's crawling
She will be guiding me
Forlorn
Follow the way into her cold black halls

Bone for bone I'll eat them all, lost and gone, forsaken
The die is cast, escape in vain, descending into chaos
Innocence has gone once more, ruthless hate is rising
Son for son, I'll lure them all into my cave infernal

Whispering words of hell, sacrifice all your being
My tempting voice is leading you
Conjuring my own demons

Cursed by the witch of the sea
Spellbound
Out of her cave she's crawling
She will be guiding me
Forlorn
Follow the way into her cold black halls

Through time and void, through ancient lights
From down below my shadow grows
An ancient curse will rise again
The lore is real, a witch appears
