I can't close my eyes
Mermaids of the dark
Hold the flags of war

I see eternal slaves of a greater will
Guardians of the crown
They will guide me down

Pleasure and pain
Drive them insane
The valley of frost
A kingdom of the lost

Staring through the dark
So cold without stars
I'm leaving the past
The tide is turning

Guided by hordes of sin
Blackness closing in
I reach the ground
Abandoned by the light

Resounding through the void
Can't keep my head up high
I see an ancient gate full of endless fate
Through soil and bones I walk
An eternal wrath is whipping in my mind
I feel so pale and blind

Pleasure and pain
Drive them insane
The valley of frost
A kingdom of the lost

I walk on and on
Under raging storms
Silence calls my name
Don't know what I became

Below the kingdom of the shores
I wanted to see more than just a part of my dream
Threw myself into the stream

And a fallen son will rise
Unleashed by ancient lies
An eternal fate below
The stream becomes my foe

A frozen scenery around
Lost places I have found
My grief spreads everywhere
Through shades and despair

Now I know
I have reached the ending
Time is taking my life
My mortal life
