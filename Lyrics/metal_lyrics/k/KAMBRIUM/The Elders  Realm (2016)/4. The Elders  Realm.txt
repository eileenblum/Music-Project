One with the stream
An alliance within
Resistance is gone
I see the throne

Reborn by the sea
An eternal birth
My sleep gets deeper
and I realize

Worlds collide
And visions are dying
Illusions rise
Reality is lying

Beyond the shores
The descent is calling
And reign of light
is slowly fading

The surface so far
Under the blazing stars
I follow the trace
into a forlorn maze

I know my demons are hunting me
I reach the gate and I see

Worlds collide
And visions are dying
Illusions rise
Reality is lying

Beyond the shores
The descent is calling
And reign of light
is slowly fading

The elders' realm before my eyes
A fallen world once built to rise

A kingdom lost
A place below
An eternal path
Where shadows crawl
