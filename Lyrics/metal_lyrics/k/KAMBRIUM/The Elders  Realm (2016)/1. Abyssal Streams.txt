Down to the ground
Down to my purgatory
Face the unknown
Lost in this territory

Bound to the void
Somewhere low
Beyond distant shores
One's hatred will grow

Follow the stream
Dark lights ahead
Into someone's realm
Awareness is dead

I... I am bound, to the void
And I'm burning inside
Set me free

And I will beat it all
So vengeance will crawl
Set me free

I will find him alone
I will take the crown

Embraced by the sea of gloom
Darkness is crawling
Deep into the underworld
The surface is fading

Away from the storms above
An into the water
Frost reflections everywhere
Illusions of madness

Darkness is crawling
The surface is fading
Away
