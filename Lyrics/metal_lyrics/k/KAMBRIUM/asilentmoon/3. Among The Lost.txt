Suffering and murder
Pain and cries and despair
You have brought to your kind

Now yourself
Are condemned, sentenced
To death...
Have no hope for heaven

'Cause your place is
Among us
The legions of guiltiers
Now you become a part
Of the lost

Reach for the light
Find your place
If you want to save your soul
This is the last chance

One last chance
Will be given to you
Don't ever deny your guilt
Remember
What you have to do
Or choose the way
Through suffering
Through punishment
Through oblivion
Through despair

Now flee
And take your last chance
'Cause this is your very last

Keep in mind

Reach for the light
Find your place
If you want to save your soul
This is the last chance
