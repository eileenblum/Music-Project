Everyone deserves to die
From the point of view of mine
Burning houses to the ground
Victim's souls will be bound

Rising terror shoots ahead
With its power to vitiate
Overwhelming brutal force
Raise out humans with that curse

Conducted by mistaken
After all they are forsaken
Tempted providence on and on
Retaliation for everyone

Currency will be death
And defrayment just for with
Resistance doomed to fail
All and sundry know this tale

Burning skies
Souls are on fire
Death from above
Flames rising higher

I am thanatos and i will
Convert the thin line
Between welfare and misery
Can you see my sign

I will evoke a ravening inferno
So nothing will remain
Just a mankind full of sorrow

Everyone deserves to die
From the point of view of mine
Burning houses to the ground
Victim's souls will be bound

Rising terror shoots ahead
With its power to vitiate
Overwhelming brutal force
Raise out humans with that curse
