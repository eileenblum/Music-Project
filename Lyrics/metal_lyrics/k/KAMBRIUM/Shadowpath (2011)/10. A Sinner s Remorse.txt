[Victim:]
Lost in a darkened hall
In silence
My soul is fading away
As I can see
The court of the dead
The guards of wisdom
Who will curse my fate

Far too long I have lived this way
My heart the keeper of lies
Now I know I have got to pay
Condemned to die once more

[Creator:]
I am yesterday
I am tomorrow
I am the now and here
Bringer of delight and sorrow

I am yesterday
I am tomorrow
I am the now and here
Creator even gods must follow

[Victim:]
I killed a thousand times
With my hands
Did not have any regrets
Alt I ever thought
Fulfilling their will
So I gave up life
And lost my everything

Far too long I have lived this way
My heart the keeper of lies
Now I know I have got to pay
Condemned to die once more

[Creator:]
I am yesterday
I am tomorrow
I am the now and here
Bringer of delight and sorrow

I am yesterday
I am tomorrow
I am the now and here
Creator even gods must follow

How foolish human beings are
To persuade themselves
There won't be war
