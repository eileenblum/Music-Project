In the dark
I can hear my hollow heart
Silence is everywhere
And my soul is torn apart

I can feel the emptiness
Crawling in my chest
Is time my last old friend
Or is it just my death

In the night
The moon is rising high
And i know this is the last time
Have no fear
And hear my last rhymes

In this winternight
I can hear your cry
Blood is falling on my hands
Lost without you
In these darkened lands

Lying in the snow
Buried by the night
I feel her cold white skin
Pain is growing from within

Now i'm all alone
A fallen angel by my side
Darkness reveals itself
And the light is fading away

In the night
The moon is rising high
And i know this is the last time
Have no fear
And hear my last rhymes

In this winternight
I can hear your cry
Blood is falling on my hands
Lost without you
In these darkened lands
