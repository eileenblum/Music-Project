Ages before the dark last war,
Two gods were fighting in engrained wrath
After decades, Seth took a stroke
To rip out Horus' eye in a stream of blood

Oh Horus,
Your moon shall guide our ways!
Your eye shall grant us shelter
Before the evil gaze!

[The other gods:]
"The ground stopped shattering! Who of them will bear away victory now? Is it Seth's evil laughter?
The moon disappeared!
Hail Isis and Thot: we need both of them!"

Drenched in blood they found him laying
On the edge of eclipse he received salvation
As the moon enlightened the night,
Seth was shivering and turned away his gaze
