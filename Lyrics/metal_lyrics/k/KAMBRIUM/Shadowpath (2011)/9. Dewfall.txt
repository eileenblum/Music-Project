See the morning lights arise
Throw away the pints from yesterday

The next walk on
The wild side is awaiting you
Come on hit the road now
It's best before dawn

Dewfall

Wake up your fellowship
Grab the remaining kegs
Just breathe the new day
I and go ahead to the horizon

Feel the pushing wind
In your hair
Go on bundling everything
You need

Dewfall
