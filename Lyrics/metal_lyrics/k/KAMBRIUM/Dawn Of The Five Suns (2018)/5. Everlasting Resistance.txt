Here we are
The chosen ones
The hunt begins
Revenge for my sons
We strike we kill
He will hear our drums
Blinded by rage
We will take down that god

Through sand and lakes
Trough night and day
We followed him loudless
Now he's our prey
We won't back down
There's no way back
Destroyed our home
So we will attack

We raise our swords
Against your crown
We'll make your crawl
And take you down

...Cabrakan you won't survive
So let us hear your final words
Before you drown!
Your elements won't stop us now
No tales will tell what you have done
So you will be forgotten!"

Sworn to the tribe
That the giant will fall
No more a god
We will tear out his soul
We are the legion
The bringer of freedom
Our resistance is strong
And won't ever be eaten

We raise our swords
Against your crown
We'll make your crawl
And take you down

...Cabrakan you won't survive
So let us hear your final words
Before you drown!
Your elements won't stop us now
No tales will tell what you have done
So you will be forgotten!"

I'm the mountain god
And I will never die
'Cause I am far too strong
So you will have to pay now!"

...We know all your lies
And we will all survive
'Cause we feared far too long
So you will have to pay now!"
