Someone's near
I can hear his breath
He comes to me
...Please sell me your potions!"
I smell his fear
And stare at him
...Well my son
It will take all your devotion!"

â¦Restless souls of mine"
â¦We are lost forever"
...Spirits of an ancient time
I will cast the spell!"
...Do not listen to him!"
"I am the ghost shaman!"

I am the keeper
And these are my potions
My prices are high
But they will cure your anguish
All I will need are
Some parts of your corpus
These bones you don't need
And this flesh is overrated"

"I will cure your wounds
And I will cure your soul
Just give me flesh and bones
So I will cure it all!
Don't listen to their words
And I will guide you through
The essence of it all
I give it just to you!"

"Don't
Believe him
Don't you
Trust him!"

Darkness rises
In his veins
He took it all
...I can not feel my heartbeat!"
He looks to me
With fear inside
â¦Well my son
That's because your soul leaves!"

â¦Restless souls of mine"
â¦We are lost forever"
...Spirits of an ancient time
I will caste the spell
...Do not listen to him!"
"I am the ghost shaman!"
