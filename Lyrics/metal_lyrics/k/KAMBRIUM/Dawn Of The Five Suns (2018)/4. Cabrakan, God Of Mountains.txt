The warning lights proclaimed our decay
No sound was heard
The wind stood still
We prayed to him
Cabrakan the god of mountains came
The son of a hell god
Smashed our hopes
Burned everything

Too much suffering has come over the tribe
Too much blood, was shed
Cabrakan â Lord of Earthquakes
Destroyer of mountains, has come. And all he
Left was a trail of devastation
With grief and endless anger in their hearts
The elders decided to send two
Brave heroes to take revenge
On the son of Hell-God Seven Macaw.

Lightnings all around
Fire in darkness
Earthquakes break the ground
Mankind burned away
Fire in darkness
But heroes will remain

â¦The era of the giants will rise"
He said... You were praying to the wrong gods
Far too long,
So now you shall tremble in fear"
These words of hell were
Hunting the whole tribe every night in their dreams
And these words burned
Away the most important treasure
Mankind ever possessed: hope

Cabrakan was on his way
And he destroyed us all
The god of mountains raised his fists
And smashed the blood soaked ground
Smoke and ashes wrapped the corpses of a dying tribe
The sky turned dark and all they saw was chaos all around

The night came in
And darkness reigned the land
Fire was the only guide
While ruins fell to dust
Eyes were filled with anger
And they sworn
The giant will be taken down
A new resistance was born

Legends will rise
The elders are calling
Two heroes will ride
Darkness is fading

Hunt him through the darkened forests
Hunt him through the barren deserts
Hunt him through the deepest waters
Hunt him on the greatest mountains

We will ride side by side
Our destiny is
To kill the beast
He took away a thousand lives
Now it's time for his decay

Lightnings all around
Fire in darkness
Earthquakes break the ground
Mankind burned away
Fire in darkness
But heroes will remain

And so the hunt should begin
Two heroes, chosen to prove that the will to
Survive is still strong within their hearts
They would follow him into enchanted lands
A journey into the unknown
With the fear never to return
Two mortal warriors against one god.
