Before you the pyramid is rising
Steps over steps
Thousands you can't count
The almighty gods frown on you
And from the top ascends the priest

In lavish gowns woven colourful
His gesture seems so weird
He prays words you
Don't know anymore
And down comes the blade

Shadows afar
I can see them so clear
Brightness within
The elders calling me
My future denied
My life is lost
A spectre I will be
Sacrifices must be made

As you watch you see a clawy hand
Reaching for your heart
The merciless gods seem appeased
And spectators stand in awe

Shadows afar
I can see them so clear
Brightness within
The elders calling me
My future denied
My life is lost
A spectre I will be
Sacrifices must be made

Shadows afar
I can see them so clear
Brightness within
The elders calling me
My future denied
My life is lost
A spectre I will be
Sacrifices must be made
