Like a shadow we are crawling
Predators on the hunt
Swords are shining in the moonlight
The prey is near
We make no sound
We will have to bring him victims
Your sacrifice is a must
The dead of the night is our vantage
The time has come
And we attack

Here we are
We are the tribe of darkness
And we will hunt you
Nothing will remain
Here we are
We are the tribe of darkness
And we will rise now
Madness gone insane

Now you know who we are
Lay down your arms
Death won't be far
Back in time we were like you
Lived on our own hunt then we knew
We could be more
Than human flesh
We searched for him
Fell in a trap
He took our lives
He took our souls
Now we're lost forevermore

Here we are
We are the tribe of darkness
And we will hunt you
Nothing will remain
Here we are
We are the tribe of darkness
And we will rise now
Madness gone insane

"Take my life!
I sacrifice
My soul to you!
Take it all!"

"Have no fear now,
Leave your sorrows!
I will guide you
Now obey me!"

...Take my life
And I obey
My soul is yours
Was lead astray!
I have no fear
And won't look back
I give it all
Control my fate!"

...Get on your knees
And look at me!
I take your spirit
You are free!
I got it all
Now you are mine
Another ghost
For all time!"

One by one we're fading away
The master calls
We're drifting away
Only darkness will prevail
