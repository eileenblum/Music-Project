I will bring death, blood and shame
Your life will not be the same
None but me must take your spirit
For I alone will end it
With pleasure I'll drink your blood
Suck your marrow with one crack
Peel off your skin with my teeth
Rip your heart like a leaf

Strangling, choking free o fair
No hope for you but despair
I don't care what you have done
As long as you'll be gone
Most likely that you will see
There's no alternative to me
Synchronize your lips to mine
Repeat those words to my shine
Blood-soaked
Goddess

Blood-soaked
Goddess

Blood-soaked
Goddess

Thus relieved from your flesh
I can mingle souls so fresh
Break them, crunch them, feel the heat
They taste sweeter than red meat
Before meal I will hunt you down
Chase you like a little doe
And when you run out of a breath
You cringe in the face of death

Kingdoms I love to dispatch
And crush them to petty brash
My purpose is homicide
Slay puny humans with pride
No one loves that killing spree
No man, no crone, but bloody me
The taste of blood turns me on
Shriek my name cry it loud

Blood-soaked
Goddess

Blood-soaked
Goddess

Blood-soaked
Goddess
