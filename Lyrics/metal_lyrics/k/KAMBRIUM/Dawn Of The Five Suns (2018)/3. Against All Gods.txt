...fire! Scattered calls of hope
Cinders! Our prayers won't be heart
Trampled! Our friends and our homes
Broken! They left us all alone
Rise up, don't forget
What we are going through
Look up and accept
Their actions are undue
Grind your knife and spear
Immortal lives undone
Shake off all your fears
Their doom will shortly come"

Fire will lead us
We follow the path
We raise our blood soaked swords
Against all gods
Awaken from darkness
And bound to the light
Forever we stand as one
Against all gods

...hatred! They always let us down
Repulsion! On us they seem to frown
Rumble! For Cabrakaan will fall
Perish and regret, your era ceases to be
Face down, don't object
You are no gods to me
Gear up for the fight
We stand in disbelief
Gone out is your light
Even you can bleed"

Blazing sun show us the way
Bring us hope and light
So we can won't decay
Take the fears of those
Who can't stand their ground
Burn the night away
Until the darkness is downed
No wind no rain will break our will
We are strong and proud
So we won't stand still
Dignify the ones who have lost their lives
Glorify your believe
That the gods soon will die

Fire will lead us
We follow the path
We raise our blood soaked swords
Against all gods
Awaken from darkness
And bound to the light
Forever we stand as one
Against all gods
