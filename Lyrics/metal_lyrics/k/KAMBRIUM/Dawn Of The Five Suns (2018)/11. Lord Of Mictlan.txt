â¦Wandering for four years and you see
MictlÃ¡n can't be left. I've got the keys!
You will stay and you will obey me
Ge ton your knees now"

â¦I have come to take some bones with me!
The precious ones, to save humanity
Restore the balance for all life on Earth
Lord, I will beg you"

...I am darkness I am death
The guardian of your final breath
The keeper of a fallen world
And son you will be mine!

High up there you may be God,
But deep down here we know you're not!
The throne is mine and I'm the king!
MictlÃ¡n is my realm!"

â¦Bones are seeds and I will need them now!
I sacrifice my blood so they will grow
Is there any chance to get to you?
Oh Lord of MictlÃ¡n"

...So you want what's mine and sacrifice
Your own blood to save a dying race
Take that conch shell and blow deep inside
Dance around my throne, fool!"

â¦I am darkness I am death
The guardian of your final breath
The keeper of a fallen world
And soon you will be mine!

High up there you may be God,
But deep down here we know you're not!
The throne is mine and I'm the king!
MictlÃ¡n is my realm!"

I searched all my life
For the path of light and freedom
All I found was hell and darkness on my way
Now the time has come
And the creature stands before me
Lord of MictlÃ¡n is his name and he will reign

Lord of MictlÃ¡n rise

"Only way to get them was to steal
Took the bones of life and broke the deal
Ran away but he could chase me down
The trap of a master

Shattered bones were lying all around
Took them all and somehow I got out
The suns gave blood and mankind rose again
The world as you know it"

...I am darkness I am death
The guardian of your final breath
The keeper of a fallen world
And soon you will be mine!

High up there you may be God
But deep down here we know you're not
The throne is mine and I'm the king!
MictlÃ¡n is my realm!"

I searched all my life
For the path of light and freedom
All I found was hell and darkness on my way
Now the time has come
And the creature stands before me
Lord of MictlÃ¡n is his name and he will reign
