from the void there came a beast
the first god did arise
darkness, light and storms
gave birth to his four sons

creation of a new world has begun
cosmic time and mankind by the suns

Four Winds created life
but was attacked by chaos
the throne was claimed again
so death could reign the lands

creation of a new world has begun
cosmic time and mankind by the suns

far beyond the time
ancient gods created life
a cycle of destruction
and hope inside
the kingdom of the ones
it would fall and rise again
dawn of the five suns
and a new world has been born

the third controlled the rain
hold a scepter and sent lightning
this world came to an end
when the second sent his fire

creation of a new world has begun
cosmic time and mankind by the suns

far beyond the time
ancient gods created life
a cycle of destruction
and hope inside
the kingdom of the ones
it would fall and rise again
dawn of the five suns
and a new world has been born

Four Waters reigned the land
a tremendous flood appeared
humanity got lost
and silence did awake

creation of a new world has begun
cosmic time and mankind by the suns

far beyond the time
ancient gods created life
a cycle of destruction
and hope inside
the kingdom of the ones
it would fall and rise again
dawn of the five suns
and a new world has been
born

the last sun broke the earth
Four Movements sent his rage
creatures of the stars
descended from the sky
