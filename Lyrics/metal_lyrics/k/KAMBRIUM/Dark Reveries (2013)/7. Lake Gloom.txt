See me drowning in the lake
Bound to forsake
My last breath in your dream
Before I will leave

Deep into the unknown I will fall
A silent call
The voice is leading me
Into the void

I can see
The black side of me
I can feel
The source deep in me

Welcome to your own nightmare
Where memories are my prey
All is covered by eternal darkness
Remembrance will decay

Here at Lake Gloom
Where the coldness crawls in veins
Visions of the lost ones
Are going down in sin

Can you hear their helpless cries
Soon they will be mine
Serpents sliding in the dark
Shivers down your spine

Soon I will reach the endless ground
Forever bound
Devastation of a memory
Senses led astray

Now silence surrounding me
I can not be
The stream whispers my name
Fading away

I can see
The black side of me
I can feel
The source deep in me

Welcome to your own nightmare
Where memories are my prey
All is covered by eternal darkness
Remembrance will decay

Here at Lake Gloom
Where the coldness crawls in veins
Visions of the lost ones
Are going down in sin
