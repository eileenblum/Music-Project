Day by day and night by night
I can not run
I can not hide
Only fear is left inside

Once again I feel no pain
Nightmares drive me insane
I wake up in a dream of mine
Where fallen souls give me the sign

Hell - in me
Breaks out
Lost in the darkness
Hate - in me
Cries out
Lost in my madness
Hell - in me
Breaks out
Lost in the darkness

Come into my world
Bringer of salvation
Watch the burning earth
Drowning in frustration

Come into my world
Bringer of salvation
The greatest scare
Spellbound by a nightmare

Blinding lights guide me the way
All my senses, led astray
Suddenly I realise (that)
I'm creator of all these lies

Vengeance of a morbid thought
A demon that I once fought
Bound to wander endless times
Through the struggle of my mind

Come into my world
Bringer of salvation
Watch the burning earth
Drowning in frustration

Come into my world
Bringer of salvation
The greatest scare
Spellbound by a nightmare

Come into my world
Bring me salvation
The earth is burning
Down in frustration
