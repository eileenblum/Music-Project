We can not see the moon
The lights are gone and darkness shines
Mankind left alone
Clouds are falling from the sky
At the edge of time
The ash is burning all we loved
Just a memory
Is all that's left behind

Come with me
Down to abyss
Down with me
In Styx's waters

Frozen
In my heart of stone
Silence
Like the eye of a storm
Darkness
And the stars won't shine
Sadness
On these last days of time

The dark lights glowing bland
Something is calling our names
Hope rises again
Following the secret call
The light feels so cold
Freezing the blood in our veins
Black eyes open up
And esperance just turns to dust

Come with me
Down to abyss
Down with me
In Styx's waters

Frozen
In my heart of stone
Silence
Like the eye of a storm
Darkness
And the stars won't shine
Sadness
On these last days of time
