Fire in my eyes
Makes my hatred rise
Condemned is what you are
Now prepare for the last
War is what you get
Eternal reign without regret
On a path where shadows crawl
Bleeding souls begin to fall

Sorrow in your veins
Fallen ghosts caught in chains
Possessed by evil shades
Ancient demons are awake
A storm about to come
Blackness above the sun
Frost is on its way
Mankind's lost it will decay

Now close your eyes
And leave everything behind
Ashes from the skies
The damned will lead the blind

Taken by the storm
Released from the throne
When darkness meets the eye
The time has come to die
Taken by the storm
Released from the throne
When darkness meets the eye
The time has come to die
Taken by the storm

Convulsion of the earth
Takes life without remorse
All hope is burned to dust
Esperance turns to rust
The source of night and doom
Will burst far too soon
A way down to hell
Opened by an evil spell

Forceful like the wind
Envoy of the end
The seas break the shore
All will perish in war
Your prayers they all were vain
Life and death it's all the same
The light will fade away
This is judgement day

Now close your eyes
And leave everything behind
Ashes from the skies
The damned will lead the blind

Taken by the storm
Released from the throne
When darkness meets the eye
The time has come to die
Taken by the storm
Released from the throne
When darkness meets the eye
The time has come to die
Taken by the storm
