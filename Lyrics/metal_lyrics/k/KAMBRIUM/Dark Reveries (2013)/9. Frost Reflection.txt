I came across the frozen lake
The waves of time so cold
I sailed alone the hours passed
The lights of hope were gone

Emptiness in me

Suddenly I realised
Ice was all around
I left my boat, to see it all
I've reached the distant shore

Something's watching me

This is the inception
I see my frost reflection
A masquerade of ice and snow
I am the black serpent
A part of this dark legion
I am creator of this world

Struggling through that haze
Finding no way out
The wind embraces my burning skin
I can feel the change within

Eternal serpents rise

Isolated in a dream of mine
Hiding from the snakes
Evil eyes begin to shine
Illusion becomes bare hate

Leave me all alone

This is the inception
I see my frost reflection
A masquerade of ice and snow
I am the black serpent
A part of this dark legion
I am creator of this world

Leaving the the past, I will drown in my sorrow
Surrounded by darkness, I'm lost in an iceworld
Pursued by serpents, and guided by hatred
Reptiles of blackness are gathered in my head
