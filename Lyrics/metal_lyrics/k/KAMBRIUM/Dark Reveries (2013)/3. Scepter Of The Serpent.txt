You have done it once again
Unimpressed by all those which
You have emotionally slain
Props to you, undignified snitch

How many may still follow
Is there something human left
Leave them to drown in sorrow
Just go on with your next theft

The crimes against your fellows
Are nothing but your own feeds
One day you'll hang by the gallows
Built up by your own deed

I confer the scepter of the serpent
May you keep it for eternity

Keep it and gloat over it
Keep it and be proud of it
Keep it and feel first-rate with it
Keep it and wear out with it
Keep it and get lost with it
Keep it and then choke on it

If you feel a sign of regret
I'm not the one you should talk to
Just ask yourself if you should get
What you are evolving into

I confer the scepter of the serpent
May you keep it for eternity
