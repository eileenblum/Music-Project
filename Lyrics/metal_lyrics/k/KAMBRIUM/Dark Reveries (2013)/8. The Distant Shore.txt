Raging seas around
Endless waves so cold
I will set the course
To reach the distant shores

Pale, dead, empty eyes
A tremendous force will rise
I seek the mighty black
Now, there is no way back

So follow me
I guarantee
We turn the tide
No need to hide

Waters surrounding me
The unknown I can see
Howling winds so strong
Don't know where I belong

Inside my rotten soul
Nightmare takes control
No hope in that night
Darkness my guiding light

I can see
The spirits of the sea
(and) I can feel
The frost is hunting me

Visions of my dreams
Collide with my reality
A remnant of the past
Striking down my destiny
Reflections of my fate
Covered by an endless stream
The distant shore awaits
Far away on the other side

Raging seas around
Endless waves so cold
I will set the course
To reach the distant shores
Pale, dead, empty eyes
A tremendous force will rise
I seek the mighty black
Now, there is no way back

So follow me
I guarantee
We turn the tide
No need to hide
