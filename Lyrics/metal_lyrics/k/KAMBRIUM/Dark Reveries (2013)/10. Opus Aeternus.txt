And so I will wait
Until we meet again
The surface and me
Now I can feel
I'm bound to see the fear
The serpents are near

The legion is here
We take control
The force has arrived
The dream is a lie
You belong to us
The signs in your eyes

The lake I can see
Is staring back at me
I'm lost in a dream
The ghost is calling my name
She drives me so insane
Caught by the stream

I sacrifice my own life
I will never dream again
Close my eyes â fade away
In my dreams I will decay

One last song â forever gone
Time will cast the final storm
Endless frost seals my fate
Gloomy shadows are awake

All is lost (in your mind)
I will fall (and die)
I will drown in endless sorrow
My own life the greatest lie
Into the dark (we'll find you)
I can't hide (come out)
Full of fear - they can sense me
All the serpents are gathered now

[Monologue I]

[Turn The Tide]

Fog is rising from the surface
Through that haze I can see undefinable blackened silhouettes
They're getting closer and closer
Now I see myself surrounded by ancient creatures
I can't name a number of those who are still hiding in the fog
But I feel their empty eyes are starring at me
One of these creatures, holding a scepter in it's claws, dissolves from the rest
It is watching every single move I make
All of a sudden it takes a bow and raises the scepter
It seems to be a solicitation to take it
I stretch out my hands

As I take the scepter, the sky turns black
Lightning strikes the earth
And the wind becomes a storm
Majestic mountains begin to collapse
Hail stings like nails in the face
Endless frost will darken my soul

Raging forces all around me
Blackness rising everywhere
I can see the shadow path now
Eternal nightmare â a vicious scare
Brightest flames of salvation
Will be killed by dark deception
Roaming in my deepest vision
See the snake division

Serpent blood
In my veins
Can't resist
These evil Cains
Cold wind blows
Inside my soul
Burning hate
I lose control

[Monologue II]

[The Serpent's Revelation]

I can feel how my skin changes
My veins begin to burn and frost freezes my thoughts
Dream and reality collide
I can not tell what is true
Illusion and madness merge to one great lie

Now I see the frost reflection
Night is overwhelming me
Lost forever in my nightmare
Restless shadows everywhere

[Monologue III]

[The Enlightenment]

Now I realize what happened
This whole world is built on the foundation of my lies
Nothing is real
I myself am the biggest lie
Now I am doomed to live in my own nightmare
A second hell where there is no hope and escape

Into the darkness
And into the black light
Serpents of sorrow
Hiding in the cold night

I sacrifice my own life
I will never dream again
Close my eyes â fade away
In my dreams I will decay

One last song â forever gone
Time will cast the final storm
Endless frost seals my fate
Gloomy shadows are awake
