A gathering of unknown forces
Demons break into your mind
Time will cast these evil curses
A thousand lies will make you blind

Underneath that rotten surface
Crawling, creeping in the black
Feeling the revolting embrace
Realize: there's no way back

Damned to break your soul
The dream will take control
Lost and decayed

We are
A thousand â strong
We hear
The battle horn
We see
All hope has died
We feel
The serpent's might

Here we are
Legion of the night
Serpents of the wasteland
Aiming for the light
Eyes of hate
Symbol of all lies
Echoes of a lost world
On the final rise

Damned to break your soul
The dream will take control
Lost and decayed

We are
A thousand â strong
We hear
The battle horn
We see
All hope has died
We feel
The serpent's might

Here we are
Legion of the night
Serpents of the wasteland
Aiming for the light
Eyes of hate
Symbol of all lies
Echoes of a lost world
On the final rise

Damned to break your soul
The dream will take control

We are
A thousand â strong
We hear
The battle horn
We see
All hope has died
We feel
The serpent's might

Here we are
Legion of the night
Serpents of the wasteland
Aiming for the light
Eyes of hate
Symbol of all lies
Echoes of a lost world
On the final rise
