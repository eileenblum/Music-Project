A moment of chance, buried in black
Ink the pages with my blood
I'll then tie my hands of vengeance

Revelation!
A glimpse of this awful finality
Torn wings bleed on tattered faces
Betraying my every mortality
Ink the pages

Ink the pages with my blood
Betray my mortality
A glimpse of finality
Ink the pages with my blood
A moment of chance, buried in black
Bury it!

Break the glass of sorrow upon the stone
And love what does not feel to suffer or to burn
Despised!
Ink the pages!
Ink the pages with my blood
Betraying this mortality
A glimpse of finality
Ink the pages with my blood
A moment of chance, buried in black

My heart is bleeding
I'll sunken in
I'm wounded by your wrath

Blood will triumph over all
Blood will triumph over all
