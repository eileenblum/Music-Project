Grieve
Grieve once and grieve a lifetime
Grieve
Grieve once and grieve a lifetime

Repenting for my hopes
I've sinned and masked my fears
Unwavering inability
to accept my frozen destiny

Grieve, give me the strength
Grieve, give me the hope

Grieve
Grieve once and grieve a lifetime
Grieve
Grieve once and grieve a lifetime

A carcass with a heartbeat
This is no answer within
I have lived in a hole of suffocation
Caged by my own doubt again and again

Grieving a lifetime of misery
A lifeless misery

Grieve the memory
see this crushing me; bury what's left of me
Grieve the memory
see this crushing me; bury what's left of me

A lifeless memory
A lifetime of misery
see this crushing me
Now bury what's left of me
