It's in my blood, rushes through my veins
and there's no defense against the plague
The here and now is the breath I take
Within these lungs is my escape
So close again, yet so far away
I feel so far gone but it helps the pain
Give me one more dusk after a darkened day
Give me a ray of light to lead the ghosts astray

I've been knowing that this night can't last forever

It's through my body, within my soul
races down my throat, so self absorbed
There's no talking to the man I was
Everything's so bright outside the world
So enthralled by you I need another taste
Fill my head again, there's no yesterday
Hardened by your touch, fill you with my rage
I just need one more dawn, to lead the ghosts astray

I've been knowing that this night can't last forever
Give me one more dusk after a darkened day
I've been knowing that this night can't last forever
I just need one more dawn, to lead the ghosts astray

Could it be, could it be the awaking?
Could it be, could it be the awaking of a tortured soul?
