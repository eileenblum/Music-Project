I'm still living, searching, and questioning
I'm still hoping, bleeding, and wandering
Searching for something to ease the agony
Questioning all of this life lost in front of me
Trying not to let the hopelessness engulf me
Wishing for the realization to give me something, someone
to help me feel again
Something, someone
to let me heal again

How can we free the fallen?
How can we free the fallen?
Free them from themselves

I'm still living, searching, and questioning
I'm still hoping, bleeding, and wandering
I'm still living, searching, and questioning
Wishing for the realization to give me something, someone
to help me feel again
Something, someone
to let me live again

How can we free the fallen?
How can we free the fallen?
Free them from themselves

Searching for something to ease the agony
Questioning all of this life lost in front of me
Trying not to let the hopelessness engulf me
Wishing for the realization to come to me

Resurrect me

I'm still searching for something in this life
Anyone or anything to give me peace inside
