Some roads take you places in life
From which you can never return
Lost souls will try and guide you back
From places that you never were

I turned to stone
Once I saw the reflection, was my own

Some choices will be so clear
But the outcome will be so blurred
And when the future becomes the past
It will haunt you with unspoken words
I turned to stone
Once I saw the reflection, was my own

Now I cast a stone
Though the windows of a broken home
