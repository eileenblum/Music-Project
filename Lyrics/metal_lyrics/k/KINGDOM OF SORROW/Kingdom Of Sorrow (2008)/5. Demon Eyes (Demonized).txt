Impassive thoughts
Ripped from a forgotten day
Tortured words not so easily forgiven
If I'm what you've say I've become
The this is how it must die again
Crawling through your nightmare
Or what it is and what its always been
Inhaling lifetimes of pain
Condemning your eyes with every breath
Cold hearted and destroyed by living
Pit I have for no one, not felt
Punish me now punish us all forever
This love is a cemetery
If I'm what you've say I've become
The this is how it must die again
If I'm what you've say I've become
The this is how it must die, die again

Punish me now, punish us all forever
Demon's Eyes, demon's eyes see my past
Demonized, demonized by what I thought we had

Demon eyes, demon eyes, demon eyes
See the unspeakable
Demon eyes, demon eyes
Demonized by what I thought we had

Now it must die again
Light of the sky shines down upon
a love that is now a cemetery
With emotional starvation
Hoping that this calm will follow

Unmerciful
Demon's Eyes, demon's eyes see my past
Demonized, demonized by what I thought we had
