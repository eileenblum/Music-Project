I'm waging the war
in a shattered city
Accused and condemned
Imprisoned by a man's word
Made to bear witness
Raped into submission
The most severe price

No name. no voice. no face
Victims of deranged injustice
Inhumanity. Instability
Straight jacked by tradition
Fear and desperation in an enclosed world
Lifting the veil

Lead into demise
Imprisoned by a man's word
Intimidation into power
eith ruthless force
The slightest provocation
evokes their crimes
Now law is absent

Insecurity. Inhumanity. Instability
No name. no voice. no face
Victims of deranged injustice

Lead into demise
Imprisoned by a man's word
Lead into demise
Now bear witness to my sacrifice

I've been lead into
Led into demise
and I paid the most severe price
Imprisoned by a man's word
Into demise
Now bear witness to my sacrifice
