What I've seen in my lifetime
is enough to accept to all abandon
It's enough to betray my faith
Hear this prayer for her
and let me know
I'll give you my lifetime
if it mus, if it must be so

I'll give you my lifetime
I need your acceptance
I want to believe
but I need your redemption
I'm alone and exposed
in a war of fear with myself
I need your belief
your need to never see this hell
Hear this prayer now
I'll give you my lifetime
if it must be, if it must be so

I ask of you
I beg of you
to hear this prayer
Have I given of myself to free you?
Have I taken enough abuse to save you?
Have I given enough have I taken enough?
I would save you myself if the saving was there for you

I'm crying out for you
to hear this prayer for her

I ask of you, hear this prayer now
I beg of you,
Hear this prayer,
To hear this prayer
