Come undone, to piece it all back together
Don't let me die alone
Come undone, to piece it all back together

Now my soul is gasping
Devoured by the cold
What I need to take back
is at the bottom
I let it sink
I let it feed
and I'm in it's shadows
when I fall to my knees

Come undone, to piece it all back together
Don't let me die alone
Come undone, to piece it all back together

Time forever my enemy
I'm lost for eternity
Piece it all back together from ruin
Piece it all back from coming undone

I've been standing on the edge of the night again
Devoured by the cold
Devoured by the cold
Devoured by the cold

Yeah, to piece it all back together
from ruin from demise
to piece it all back together
from coming undone
