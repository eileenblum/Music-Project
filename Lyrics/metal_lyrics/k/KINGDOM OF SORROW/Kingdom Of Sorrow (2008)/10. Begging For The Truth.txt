I died that day when you told me that you never knew me
I died inside when I saw myself above your grave

Can you hear these words?
Begging, screaming
I can hear you now, pleading for your mercy

When more words won't speak to you
the truth will
When the truth won't speak to you
my fist will

Can you hear these words?
Begging, screaming
I can hear you now, pleading for your mercy

When more words won't speak to you
the truth will
When the truth won't speak to you
my fist will

I'm begging you to hear the truth!

Can you hear these words?
Begging, screaming
I can hear you now, pleading for your mercy
I'm begging you to hear the truth
