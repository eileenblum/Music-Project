Time, is seen from the present
Nows, don't come and go
Only the memory does
Now never was anything that we're told

Even in death their mark is made
Envision the divide
From out of emptiness
Observe the other side
The darkness known as void

Some turn to the tempest
She, never lets go
Some will, wait for the kill
They know it's gonna be their last thrill

Even in death their mark is made
Envision the divide
From out of emptiness
Observe the other side
The darkness known as void

The mark is made
Even in death
Observe the dark
Envision the divide

The mark is made
Even in death
Observe the dark
Envision the divide

Envision the divide
From out of emptiness
Observe the other side
The darkness known as void

Envision the divide
From out of emptiness
Observe the other side
The darkness known as void
