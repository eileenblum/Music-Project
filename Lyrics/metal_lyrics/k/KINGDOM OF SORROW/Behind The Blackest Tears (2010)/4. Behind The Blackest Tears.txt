Hardened by life colder than time whatâs been seen still haunts, whatâs heard still frightens
Last gasp of desperation, truth be told to face expiration
Your will was shaken, your ways betrayed them beyond whatâs promised to all
Youâll never want to see behind the blackest tears
Youâll never want to know whatâs behind the blackest tears
Behind the blackest tears nothing lives, nothing loves behind the blackest tears

All secrets abandoned drifting through, it echoes into her eyes sting as she peers into the past
Tracing steps, through horrors reviled standing before the altar as the victims kneel
Youâll never want to see behind the blackest tears
Youâll never want to know whatâs behind the blackest tears
Behind the blackest tears nothing lives, nothing loves behind the blackest tears

Last gasp of desperation, truth be told to face expiration
Your will was shaken, your ways betrayed them beyond whatâs promised to all
No one should ever see whatâs behind the blackest tears
