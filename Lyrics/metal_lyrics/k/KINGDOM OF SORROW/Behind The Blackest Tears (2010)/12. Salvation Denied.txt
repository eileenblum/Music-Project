If you had a heart, Iâd tear it out and show you itâs black like this hole in my chest
If you had a soul, Iâd twist it in knots the leeches that fester and rot
Iâve never cut deeper (Salvation)
Iâve never bled longer (Denied)
Iâm dead on your alter (Salvation)
Part of the slaughter (Denied)

So much of our lives wasted in misery cowering, cornered, bowing in apathy
Filled up with bitterness, no answers given condemned to nothingness, punishment granted
Iâve never cut deeper (Salvation)
Iâve never bled longer (Denied)
Iâm dead on your alter (Salvation)
Part of the slaughter (Denied)

Your wasted life was a selfish choice your divisive words are now a silenced voice
Iâm pitiless now, canât stand to think of the countless times you questioned me
Iâve never cut deeper (Salvation)
Iâve never bled longer (Denied)
Iâm dead on your alter (Salvation)
Part of the slaughter (Denied)
Salvation denied
