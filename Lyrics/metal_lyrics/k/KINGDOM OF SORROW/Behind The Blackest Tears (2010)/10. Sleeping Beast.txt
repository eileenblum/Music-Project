A gruelling question grows in my throat it stays their merciless as it strangles, tearing into my flesh
It seeps; I hear it breath; I feel its heartbeat Iâve felt this before, I know this ghost, a man crushed by the world
Youâve awoken a sleeping beast, now youâre in its path
Youâve awoken a sleeping beast; youâll be the focus of its wrath

It all ends; thereâs no redemption for all those who seek the salvation of the innocent; the cruellest joke indeed
They await their slaughter, gagged with their hands bound reaching into the heavens in vain
Their dreams lay beneath the ground Iâve felt this before, I know this ghost, a man crushed by the world
Youâve awoken a sleeping beast; youâre in the presence of death
Youâve awoken a sleeping beast; here youâll meet your end 
Youâve awoken a sleeping beast, now youâre in its path
Youâve awoken a sleeping beast; youâll be the focus of its wrath
Here youâll meet your end
