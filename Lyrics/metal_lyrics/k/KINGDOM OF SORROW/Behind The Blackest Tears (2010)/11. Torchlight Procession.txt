Careful what you trust in, careful what you believe the same doors lead to destruction, if your fate lies in what you perceive
The flesh reflects the deviance, the guilt, the shame within if words reflect the frustration, then youâll be losing years
Who will lead to torchlight procession?
Let it be alone, let it all come down into the cold
Let it be alone, just let it stay where it belongs
Let it be alone, let it all come down into the cold
Let it be alone who will lead to torchlight procession?

Unravelled into pieces, I feel dead, I feel cold Iâm your cause and your cure now, when you love has a mind of its own
Wrong in every way, menacing, as it takes hold deception is a broken mirror, all the fragments obscured
Most wait the torchlight procession
Let it be alone, let it all come down into the cold
Let it be alone, just let it stay where it belongs
Let it be alone, let it all come down into the cold
Let it be alone who will lead to torchlight procession?

Let it be alone; fires burning, torchlight procession will the torches guide their rage?
End their lust or limit their greed could it be the fire of damnation they follow to their grave.
