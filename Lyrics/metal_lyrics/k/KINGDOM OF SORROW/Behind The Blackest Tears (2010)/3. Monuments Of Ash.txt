Blood and hope seep into the cracks of a flawed foundation
Corruption knows no bounds in a condemned and crumbling nation
The monuments of ash rebuilt up from the remains
Like the centuries of past must be laid down to waste again
Under archaic rule nothing thrives in the dust that theyâve created
The fallen empires tell us what is known must now be forgotten
No more worship of the idol sought

The monuments of ash rebuilt up from the remains
Like centuries of past must be laid to waste again
The monuments of ash empires fall and bridges burn
Like the centuries of the past humanity will never learn
No one can thrive under tyrannyâs grasp
And when the final shadow is cast
Weâll all be dust along the path

The monuments of ash rebuilt up from the remains
Like centuries of past must be laid to waste again
The monuments of ash empires fall and bridges burn
Like the centuries of the past humanity will never learn
No one can thrive under tyrannyâs grasp and when the final shadow is cast
Weâll all be dust along the path to the fucking monuments of ash
