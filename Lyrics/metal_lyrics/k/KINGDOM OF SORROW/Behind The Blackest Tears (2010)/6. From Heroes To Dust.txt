Snow hits the ground
One and only
Bleakness is all that I found
Ice in my heart slowly fading
Forgotten wishes for you now

Still broken from the yesterday
Endless sorrow, I'm in my own way
Still broken from the yesterday
My search for closure
Still burns a dying flame

There's nothing more of you
More real to me
Than the heaviness of heart
I know you with us here
I know this presence
Know you're watching over us

Still broken from the yesterday
Endless sorrow, I'm in my own way
Still broken from the yesterday
My search for closure
Still burns a dying flame

All my heroes have turned to dust
But I feel them watching over us

Still broken from the yesterday
Endless sorrow, I'm in my own way
Still broken from the yesterday
My search for closure
Still burns a dying flame
