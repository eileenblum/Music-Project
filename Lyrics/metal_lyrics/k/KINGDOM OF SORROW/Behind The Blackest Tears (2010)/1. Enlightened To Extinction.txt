Those dead eyes see no empathy they fail to feel unable to believe with nothing behind the gaze glaring out
Black roses wither for all whoâve been chosen
Reach inside the scar caress a weathered heart
Awoken by the blade the kiss of stainless steel
I had already buried you there is nothing left to mourn
I had already buried you I only kept the memories I loved
There is nothing else left to mourn you have been enlightened to extinction

That dead touch canât feel what Iâve held unable to grasp just how Iâve dealt
In the darkest corner of your plight barely alive enough to reach towards the light
There is nothing left to mourn youâve been enlightened to extinction
Thereâs no last look in the past youâve been enlightened to extinction
Reach inside the scar caress a weathered heart
Awoken by the blade the mourning begins
Reach inside the scar caress a weathered heart
Awoken by the blade the kiss of stainless steel
