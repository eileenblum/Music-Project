Still condemned for the sacrifice it took its toll to dig every wound
Now let my path be lit with fires of burning pages a new fate uncovered
Youâll always find a way to dig beneath the hurt
Now fires light my way through blindness, embittered
Youâll always find a way to cut away the curse
Now fires light my way along the path to ruin

Through it all, forbidden new fate uncovered, new fate uncovered
The coldest heart wills since this again
Now the truth will dawn emerging from winterâs conflict
Exposed in isolation dig, dig my way out
Crawling and clawing reach to the surface, reaching
Hands appear through the fog, hands appear crawling for ages
Youâll always find a way to dig beneath the hurt
Now fires light my way through blindness, embittered
Youâll always find a way to cut away the curse
Now fires light my way, along the path to ruin
