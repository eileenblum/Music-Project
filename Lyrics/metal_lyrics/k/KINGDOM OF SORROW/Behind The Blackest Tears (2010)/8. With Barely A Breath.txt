Let me see this through their eyes feel control slip through their grasp
And never take for granted that these moments may just end
Walk now within my path; know the anguish I have faced
Never doubt me again, my hardship gives me strength
From all the wars Iâve won, from the struggles cold embrace
I feel the damage done, though Iâve gained from my mistakes
With barely a breath see the damage of secrets kept
With one more step, my will is all thatâs left

Remember the empty words just like it was yesterday
Learning now from all wrong doing and how life just whisks away
Iâm battled tested; scarred but not beyond repair
Iâm still gaining ground, through the anger and the fear
If youâve felt this with minds, feel the power cease to enslave
And never face misfortune without the sight of whatâs to be gained

Iâm battled tested; scarred but not beyond repair
Iâm still gaining ground, through the anger and the fear
With barely a breath, see the damage of secrets kept
With one more step my will is all thatâs left.
