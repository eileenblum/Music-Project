Iâve cut the wings deep to the bone I see the hourglass below
I hear them coming down the road the cover of midnight has me cold
The cloaked stranger waits for no one pleas are just wasted words
Shadows dance to the symphony of the souls beneath the earth
Harmed by desire, warned each time to stray from the cold
Plagued by the time you still see slipping into nothing
Second chances are false hopes before the hangmanâs rope
A sight youâll never want to know, the face of the death we owe
No one is ever exempt from the death we owe
No one is ever exempt from the death we owe

Here, second chances are false hope see the silhouette of the hangmanâs rope
Itâs a place that youâll never want to know everyone has to face the death we owe
Harmed by desire, warned each time to stray from the cold
Plagued by the time you still see slipping into nothing
Just one death we owe, from which no oneâs exempt
And when that force takes hold, at least youâll be on your own
