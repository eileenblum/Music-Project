Moral fabric so decayed spirit of man rotted, depraved.
It takes its toll on us all, you ask for rain deny the sky, question the answers deem them lies.
It's the punishment they crave.
I see humanity's disease, I doubt there's anything left..., anything left worth saving, I know my heartache's not alone we're all just reaping what's been sown!
You won't find god's law in the devil's land, you don't get mercy from a desperate man, you won't find god's law in the devil's land, you don't get mercy from a desperate man.
It's the curse of all mankind to want to take to strive to die, so none shall stand alone, confessional is absolute but still we can't accept the truth.
As it stands to reason!
I see humanity's disease, I doubt there's anything left! Anything left worth saving.
I know our heartache's not alone we're all just reaping what's been sown!
You won't find god's law in the devil's land, you don't get mercy from a desperate man.
You won't find god's law in the devil's land, you don't get mercy from a desperate man.
As we drift into the unknown, we vow that none shall stand alone , as we drift into the unknown, we vow that none shall stand alone.
I see humanity's disease, I doubt there's anything left! Anything left worth saving.
I know our heartache's not alone we're all just reaping what's been sown!
You won't find god's law in the devil's land, you don't get mercy from a desperate man, You'll never find god's law in the devil's land.
