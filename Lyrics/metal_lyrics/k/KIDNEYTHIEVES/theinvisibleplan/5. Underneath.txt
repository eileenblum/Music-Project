I opened my eyes to see
What's real is not anymore
The grin(?) of the adreanaline
The faint(?) on the floor
I'm standing here all alone
Won't be like it was before
The sky is changing
And no one is safe anymore

Underneath 
It's just a game
And what you see
It still remains
Underneath
I fight your wars
Over, and over, and over again
Over, and over, and over again

Appears you don't understand
The change is coming our way
The game
It changes the plan
Leading you astray
Front lines are on the inside
And words could give us away
And just by the look in your eyes
We know the light is coming

Underneath 
It's just a game
And what you see
It still remains
Underneath
I fight your wars
Over, and over, and over again
Over, and over, and over again

What you see
Is a lie(?)
Underneath
Is a fight(?)
Underneath
Is a fire(?)

Underneath 
It's just a game
And what you see
It still remains
Underneath
I fight your wars
Over, and over, and over, and over

Underneath
Is just a game again
Underneath
Is just a game again
Underneath
Is just a game again
