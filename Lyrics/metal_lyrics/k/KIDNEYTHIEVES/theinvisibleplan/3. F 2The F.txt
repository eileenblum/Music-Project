How did I get to this place
I cannot feel my face
What the fuck is wrong with me
You wanna freak to the funk and then funk with me
Your soldiers all in play
Youâre looking motivated
Iâm doing things that aren't me
You wanna freak to the funk and then funk with me

So smooth and so cool
Breaking my rules
So smooth and so cool
Breaking my rules

It can be
Anything that you could want
That you could want
That you could want it to be
Anything that you could want
That you could want
That you could want it with me
Anything that you could want
That you could want
That you could want it to be
Freak to the funk and then funk with me
Anything that you could want
That you could want
That you could want it to be
Anything that you could want
That you could want
That you could want it with me
Anything that you could want
That you could want
That you could want it to be
Freak to the funk and then funk with me

I spin, spin on a planet cloud
Canât see a thing but I feel the sound
Of the low and down pounding beat
Freak to the funk and then funk with me
My favorite place to be
Out of a dream, and into the scene
Take a wet bite out of me
Freak to the funk and then funk with me

Smooth and so cool
Breaking my rules
So smooth and so cool
Breaking my rules

Anything you want
Freak it to the funk
Itâs a low and down
Undercover
Come, come, come down
Come, come, come down
Low and down
Undercover

How did I get to this place
Youâre so motivated
And Iâm not me
Freak to the funk and then funk with me
Your soldiers all in play
Youâre so motivated
And Iâm not me
Freak to the funk in your soul
How did I get to this place
You're so motivated
And I'm not me
Freak to the funk and then funk with me
Your soldiers all in play
You're so motivated
And Iâm not me
Freak to the funk and then funk with me

Doing things that are not me
Uh-uh, not me
And I'm not me
Freak to the funk and then funk with me
