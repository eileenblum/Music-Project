I feel the sun rise
It burns in my eyes
This is my own life
I gotta get mine
My heroes don't fly
They crawl up inside
Take over your mind
Just like a drive-by

You'll take it all
You'll take it all

It's such a cold war
The silent soldier
Gotta watch your back for the attack
Keep it in composure
You may not hear me
But you can feel it
And it's an instinct
But you can't kill it

Come with me
Save ourselves now
The art of the hustle
To use the mind as a muscle
Is the invisible plan
The invisible plan
Underground
Let's take them down
The art of the hustle
To use the mind as a muscle
Is the invisible plan
The invisible plan

You'll take it all

We walk amongst you
Hearts beatin' in tune
A jungle like a machete
Cuttin' through you
We use truth as our guns and armor
Until illusion's gone

Come with me
Save ourselves now
The art of the hustle
To use the mind as a muscle
Is the invisible plan
The invisible plan
Underground
Let's take them down
The art of the hustle
To use the mind as a muscle
Is the invisible plan
The invisible plan

You'll take it all
You'll take it all

I feel the sun rise
It burns in my eyes
This is my own life
I gotta get mine
My heroes don't fly
They crawl up inside
Take over your mind
Just like a drive-by

The art of the hustle
To use the mind as a muscle
Is the invisible plan
The invisible plan
Come with me
Save ourselves now
The art of the hustle
To use the mind as a muscle
Is the invisible plan
The invisible plan
Underground
Let's take them down
The art of the hustle
To use the mind as a muscle
Is the invisible plan
The invisible plan

Let's take them down
Let's take them down
