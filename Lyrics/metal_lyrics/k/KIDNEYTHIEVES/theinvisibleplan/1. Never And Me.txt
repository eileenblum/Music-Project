Itâs 3 a.m. I know where your mind is
Somewhere between the thick of the streets
Calling in the souls of the blinded
Somewhere between never and me
Never and me
Never and me

Itâs 4 a.m. I know where your soul is
Somewhere between the lost and the fallen
Itâs climbing in
And calling you slowly
Somewhere between never and me
(Never and me) never and me
(Never and me) never and me

Is it safe to leave you alone
With all of your devices and all of your crises
Twisted as the fight is
Itâs all been decided
And the night will keep you

Safe from harm
Safe from harm
The space between never and me
Is where you find it safe to be

Itâs 5 a.m. thereâs nowhere to go now
Somewhere between
Sleep and a dream
The night it fades, a weight off your shoulders
Somewhere between never and me
(Never and me) never and me
(Never and me) never and me

Is it safe to leave you alone
With all of your vices and all of your crises
Twisted as the fight is
Itâs all been decided
And the night will keep you

Safe from harm
Safe from harm
The space between never and me
Is where you find it safe to be

From harm
Keeps you safe
From harm
The space between never and me
Keeps you safe from harm

I will keep you safe from harm
