I was lying there
And I could see myself
And they kept telling me to breathe
Breathe, I need you to breathe

But it felt too good
I didn't want to

Everything you do, every moment counts
Don't hesitate, don't ever let the battle down
Forget about the past, it can't help you now
Everything you do, every moment counts

The mountain in the cloud it is so high
There's gotta be an ending to the fight
Everything is racing through my mind
Will this ever turn around

Then the floating angels come
With their fire and their guns
Then the floating angels come
Before you have a chance to run, chance to run

Leave it all behind 'till the day is changed
Listen to them saying do what they say
The burden gone if you can take the pain
Leave it all behind to see another day

Moving from the dark into the light
Revolution nation overnight
Everything is coming into sight
I can see them, I can see them

Then the floating angels come
With their fire and their guns
And the floating angels come
Before you have a chance to run

Don't be afraid of this
Fear is afraid of this
Fear is afraid of this

Then the floating angels come
With their fire and their guns
(I can see them come)
Then the floating angels come
(I can see them come)
Before you have a chance to run

Don't be afraid of this
Fear is afraid of this
Don't be afraid of this
Fear is afraid of their gun
You better run

With their fire and their guns
Better run
