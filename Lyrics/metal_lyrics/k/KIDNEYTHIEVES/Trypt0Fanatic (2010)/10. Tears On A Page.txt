when the lights are low
and life is in your face
whether right or wrong, youâll find a way

it all fades

like tears on a page

so it broke your soul
and they took your place
whether right or wrong, youâll find a way

it all fades

like tears on a page

i want you to hear, donât you want to hear it?

it all fades, like tears on a page

donât you want to hear it?

it all fades like tears on a page.
