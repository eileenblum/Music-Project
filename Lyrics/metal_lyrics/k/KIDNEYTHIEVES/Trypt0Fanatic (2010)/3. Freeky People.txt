We are the freeky people, the freeky people that make the world go round, round
We take the stuck-up posers &amp; status-quosers &amp; we burn them in the ground, ground

I knew a girl, she had telepathic dreams
She saw things they didn't want her to see
So she turned away, looked to the sky
And then she said "fuck it, I'm gonna let my freak flag fly"

Because

This is the time of our lives
(You freeky people!)
Let out the freak inside
(You freeky people!)

I knew a boy, wanted to be free
So he watched his father to learn how not to be
You can't change the system but you can, you can change inside
I've got a new religion, it's called "No More Lies"

We are the freeky people, the freeky people that make the world go round, round
We take the stuck-up posers &amp; status-quosers &amp; we burn them in the ground, ground

We are the freeky people, the freeky people that make the world go round, round
We take the stuck-up posers &amp; status-quosers &amp; we burn them in the ground, ground

This is the time of our lives
(You freeky people!)
Let out the freak inside
(You freeky people!)

Come on now

Give it up, give it up
Let it out &amp; live it up

Give it up, give it up
Let it out &amp; live it up

(You freeky people.)
(You freeky people.)
(You freeky people.)

We are the freeky people, the freeky people that make the world go round, round
We take the stuck-up posers &amp; status-quosers &amp; we burn them in the ground, ground

We are the freeky people, the freeky people that make the world go round, round
We take the stuck-up posers &amp; status-quosers &amp; we burn them in the ground, ground

Give it up, give it up
Let it out &amp; live it up

Give it up, give it up
Let it out &amp; live it up

Give it up, give it up
Let it out &amp; live it up

Give it up, give it up
Let it out &amp; live it up

This is the time of our lives
(You freeky people!)
Let out the freak inside
(You freeky people!)
