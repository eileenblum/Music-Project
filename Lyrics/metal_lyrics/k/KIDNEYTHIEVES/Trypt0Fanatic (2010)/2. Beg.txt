Its all I can do love
Push coming to to shove
Its all I can do love
Iâve had enough

Who are you to want all of me
Who are you
Scream scream say my name
Iâll slap your pretty face awake.

goddamn, could you feel an emotion
(all I do is Beg)
goddamn, could you show what youâre made of
(all I do is Beg)
god damn could you feel an emotion, show what your made of
itâs all I can take
goddamn, could you feel an emotion
I think you love to see me beg.

You cared so long ago
Itâs breaking me down love
Iâve had enough
Gotta to move on love
Youâve taken it all love
Push comes to shove
Iâve had enough

Who are you to want me to stay
Who are you
Scream scream say my name
Iâll slap your pretty face awake.

Who are you to do this?
Stay or just forget it
Darling, if you could just scream my name

goddamn, could you feel an emotion
(all I do is Beg)
goddamn, could you show what youâre made of
(all I do is Beg)
god damn could you feel an emotion, show what your made of
itâs all I can take
goddamn, could you feel an emotion

I think you love to see me beg.
