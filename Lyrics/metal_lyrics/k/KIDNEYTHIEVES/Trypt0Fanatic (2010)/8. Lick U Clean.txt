heâs the king of the talk
heâs the cock of the walk
donât let him go heâs a crime in the room

how did it start, where is your heart? i know how to get the truth out of you.

hey baby, you wanna get up inside of this
iâll twist your mind like vines youâll see just what you missed
hey baby from your head to your heart to your jeans
iâm gonna lick you clean

i was the one to turn it around, you were the one who wanted it now, didnât you?

out of control, deep in your soul
you never thought that you would do it like that
bittenâ the lip, chomping the bit (didnât say you wanted out of this)
a volcano on the verge of explosion

hey baby, you wanna get up inside of this
iâll twist your mind like vines youâll see just what you missed
hey baby from your head to your heart to your jeans
iâm gonna lick you clean

i was the one to turn it around, you were the one who wanted it now, didnât you?
i was the one to turn it out and freak you down and lick you clean.

hey baby you wanna get up inside of this? iâll twist your mindâs eye

hey baby, you wanna get up inside of this
my twisted mind will take you to the place youâve never been
hey baby from your head to your heart to your jeans
iâm gonna lick you

i was the one to turn it around, you were the one who wanted it now, didnât you?
i was the one to turn it around, and lick you clean
you were the one who wanted it now, didnât you?
i was the one to turn it around, you were the one who wanted it now, didnât you?
i was the one to turn it out and freak you down and lick you clean.

you were the one who wanted it now, didnât you?
