Two eyes, no sight
What you gonna do tonight
Who will you take
Everybodyâs sane until they break

The Size of Always
Is an endless highway
And in this skyway
You can do this my way

Your eyes donât cry
But you gotta live or die
Leave it all to fate
Everybodyâs sane until they break

The Size of Always
Is an endless highway
And in this skyway
You will do this my way

Stop, yeah
Get your finger off the trigger just
Stop, yeah
Does it make you any bigger
Stop, yeah
a tremor to a quake
âcause everybodyâs sane until they break

Everybodyâs sane until they break
Keep in the eye of a hurricane

Two eyes collide
do what you gotta do to survive
black/white â no grey
Everybodyâs sane until they break

The Size of Always
Is an endless highway
And in this skyway
You can do it

Stop, yeah
Get your finger off the trigger just
Stop, yeah
Does it make you any bigger
Stop, yeah
a tremor to a quake
âcause everybodyâs sane until they break

Everybodyâs sane until they break
Keep in the eye of a hurricane
âcause everybodyâs sane until they break
you canât break me
you canât shake me
do this my way
âcause everybodyâs sane until they break.
