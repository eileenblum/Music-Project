I was born the daughter of a bad bad man
At 17, turned the corner and I never looked back.
Now I believe in the Wind's innocence
I've got the shift left behind, and a long road ahead

Don't let it dim your light, you're a Dark Horse like a thief in the night
Don't let it dim your light, you've gotta give it all just to keep up the fight now
Don't let it dim your light, you're a Dark Horse like a thief in the night

Don't let it take your Grace
You're gonna get what you make.

Crossed the border with a song and a dream in my hand
California took it all and choke me with
The rise and the fall, it's much sweeter within

Now I believe in the Wind's innocence
I've got tidal waves of a good fight coming

Don't let it dim your light, you're a Dark Horse like a thief in the night
Don't let it dim your light, you've gotta give it all just to keep up the fight
Don't let it dim your light, you're a Dark Horse like a thief in the night

Don't let it take your Grace
You're gonna get what you make.

Quicksilver in the dark (don't let it dim your light)
It's unstoppable (don't let it dim your light)
And when the magic comesâthey'll say "I knew it all along."

Don't let it dim your light, you're a Dark Horse like a thief in the night
Don't let it dim your light, you've gotta give it all just to keep up the fight
Don't let it dim your light, you're a Dark Horse like a thief in the night

Don't let it take your Grace
You've gotta give it all
Don't let it take your Grace
You've gotta give it all
