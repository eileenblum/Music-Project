Woke up from the raddest dream, there were purple skies and we all could fly
And there were neon signs where our hearts reside saying "you are welcome here, anytime"
I was hypnotized and I opened my eyes, put on my face and then I hit the drive
With the swerves, swerves, swerves of my life, and the turns, turns, turns of my life and I asked:
"Why did I wake up from this dream? Am I a minnow on this stream?
Why did I wake up from this dream?"

Things aren't exactly what they seem.

When you see the Velveteen and nothing more
It's a beautiful strange world when you see it like a Distant Star.

Walking along today looking single-file, cartwheels in my mind as I crack a smile
Oh, there you were you said the illest things like "I know how you feel and I feel the same."
Then a tear dropped out of the corner of my eye, in the happiest way to know that you're alive
With the swerves, swerves, swerves of my life, beautiful turns, turns, turns of my life and I said:
"Don't wanna wake up from this dayâare we as rare as the Desert Rain?
Don't wanna wake up from this day."

You took my hand and we flew away.

When you see the Velveteen and nothing more
It's a beautiful strange world when you see it like a Distant Star.

It's a beautiful strange world that we live in
What is real, always changing
And when you feel like you're standing in the middle of the oceanâ
The Light of the Stars shine the Dream.

When you see the Velveteen and nothing more
It's a beautiful strange world when you see it like a Distant Star.
