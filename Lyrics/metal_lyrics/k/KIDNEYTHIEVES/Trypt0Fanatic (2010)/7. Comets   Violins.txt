Up on the screen it's so hard to tell
When everything seems like it's something else
And then you divert your eyes when it's hot to the touch
And then you say "Goodnight, I think i feel too much."

When will you come to your knees and bow to It
You will come to your knees
The time is running out and then nobody wins with

Comets + violins
Will wash away all of our sins
Comets + violins
Will wash away all of our sins

Up on the screen it's so hard to tell
When everything seems like it's something to sell
And then you say you love her with a tragic charm
Yet you're breaking all the rules to harm Her

Come to your knees
And bow to It
You will come to your knees
It's getting harder to breathe and it seems easy to see
That

Comets + violins
Will wash away all of our sins
Comets + violins
Will wash away all of our sins
And in the end it will begin
With comets + violins crashing over everything

The skies will wash it over
With things we chose to forget
The skies will wash it over
And then it's over, over with

Comets + violins
Will wash away all of our sins
Comets + violins
Will wash away all of our sins
And in the End
Comets + violins crashing in the End

It will begin.
