Jude's her name, she wears a a sign
Says "in the morning's not the way you feel like you did the night you cried"
So I say, "sleep it off babe!"
She knows what she's talking about above all the clouds
And the reasons for what she says

She says "Hello, Hello, is anybody Home?"
Hello, Hello (or did you sell your soul?)
Hello, HelloâI thought you wanted to be somebody, then be somebody

Jude sees
The clothes you made
All the stitches and you bitchin' about the things that didn't go your way
So I say, "take em off babe!"
Why are you holding on to the pain? So you can fuck it all up again?

She says "Hello, Hello, is anybody Home?"
Hello, Hello (or did you sell your soul?)
Hello, HelloâI thought you wanted to be somebody, then be somebody

What's the trip that you be on? I thought you wanted to be somebody (hello, hello?)
And before you know it, it's all goneâI thought you wanted to be somebody (hello, hello?)

Why you holding' on to the pain?

She says "Hello, Hello, is anybody Home?"
Hello, Hello (or did you sell your soul?)
Pick it up and go (is anybody home?)
Quit your bitch and moan (or did you sell your soul?)
It's all you've done
I thought you wanted to be somebody, then be somebody
