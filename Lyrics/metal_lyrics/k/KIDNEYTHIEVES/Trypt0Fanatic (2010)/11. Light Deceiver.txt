you held the keys to my darkest love
like a wolf feeding on a dove
now iâll cleanse you from my soul
no matter how many sunset bloodsheds flow
â¦you were

a Light Deceiver
I believed you
Now Iâm leaving to the Desert

Blinded by the dark, couldnât see the light (this will fade)

Now iâll cleanse you from my soul.
