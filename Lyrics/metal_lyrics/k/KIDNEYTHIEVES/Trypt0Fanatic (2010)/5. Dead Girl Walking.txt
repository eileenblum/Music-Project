Dead Girl walking and on display
Wrapped in a cocoon of your own clichÃ©
Dead Girl walking a fall from grace
Wrapped in a cocoon of your own clichÃ©
Dead Girl walking itâs such a shame
I saw it coming from miles away

Itâs all so disposable
Thereâs nothing here for you take and no one here for you to play
Itâs all so disposable
And if we get what we deserve then you deserve it, Dead Girl.

Dead Girl walking, the wasted days
Trapped in a cocoon and canât fly away
Dead Girl walking, the beauty fades
I see it comingâand the future is a lonely place
(I tried and you betrayed)

Itâs all so disposable
Thereâs nothing here for you take and no one here for you to play
Itâs all so disposable
And if we get what we deserve then you deserve it, Dead Girl.

Oh, youâre just a broken one
Wasted all that youâve become
Youâre just a broken one, and Iâve given up on you Girl.

Youâre so disposable
Thereâs nothing here for you take and no one here for you to play
Itâs all so disposable
And if we get what we deserve then you deserve it, Dead Girl
Itâs all so disposable â youâre just a broken one
(and if we get what we deserveâ¦.)
Itâs all so disposable
(wasted all you could become)
And if we get what we deserve then you deserve it, Dead Girl.
