[2004 "Trickstereprocess" compilation track]He eats red and all violet 
Kills fishes with a rock star flag 
Caught up in a vacuum breeze where 
Moans and cries dissolve in speed 

It's your life without a life 
(red + violet fades) 
It's your life without a life 
(red + violet fades) 

He eats red and all violet 
Newer skin makes him giant 
And he's bought a grin, soon to leave 
Tenor howls dissolve in speed 

It's your life without a life 
(red + violet fades) 
Running out of running time with your life without a life 
(red + violet fades) 

please don't send another rose this time 
(please don't, what you hold will fade just like a rose and you'll be alone, can't you see that what you hold it isn't gold) 

please don't send another goddamn rose 
the desire's sweet you keep taking blood from me 
please don't send another goddamn rose 
please don't send another goddamn rose 

It's your life without a life 
(red + violet fades) 
Running out of running time and in the end you're gonna find 
(red + violet fades) 

red + violet fades 

red + violet fades... yeah

please don't send another rose 

please don't send another rose this time.
