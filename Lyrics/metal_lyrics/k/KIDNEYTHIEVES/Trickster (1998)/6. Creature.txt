Creature comfort, supplicant
Let me tell you what I want
What's the use, a void of course
Take the abuse, make it worse
Creature comfort, delicate
Wish I could lose the day we met
Never in words to say this time
I should just keep this down inside
I wish..
You're the other half of the sky
Creature comfort me tonight.
Creature comfort, justify
I have been waiting all these lives
Everyone's changed their thoughts with age
Scratching their bird claws in my cage
I wish I could love the sun again
Help me love the sun again
I wish I could love
I wish you could love the sun again.
I could love
