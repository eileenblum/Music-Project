My god loved the whores and babies
My god never noticed a sin
My god grew and killed the daises
My god threw the towel in
My god is weird my god is scared my god paints a pretty picture of fear
He's driving in gear.
One day got sick of hailing mary's
Hailed you, got the door and slid on in
Told me you were good a fortune telling
Said too much, threw the towel in
Paid for my ride
Told him we could take the long way
Held on to everything he said
Wanted insight or an answer
Pointed the rear-view at my head
All in all, what does it mean?
