One by one, stings my eyes
Each is gone, each a disguise
Smiling, so aware
Precious moments so rare
Boiled thoughts, evaporated - gone.
Can't bear the loss of never loving you
So jaded, so wrong
Stripping my skin over again
Back when they were teaching me to color in between the lines
In the cushion of my soul I found a remote and now it's changing time
Peeling layers, layers, layers.
Stripping my skin over again
Shivering pale, under my nails
Back when they were teaching me to color in between the lines
In the cushion of my soul I found a remote and now it's changing time
Peeling layers, layers, layers.
Escape in a drug not lasting enough
Now I just use my fingers for love
Rocked back, forth, cornered alone
Purging mind feeds a starving soul
Uncoil, unwrap, shed, scrape, peel, naked, alive, tear down -- feel.
