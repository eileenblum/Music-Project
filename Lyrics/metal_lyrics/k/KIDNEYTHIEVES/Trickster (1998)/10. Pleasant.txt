I was everything, and nothing
You were somebody, something
Please, underestimate me
I recognize your disease
Ingested you, digested you
I know, we can be each other's blessing
Good-bye, I'm taking a lesson
Your cry, echoes pleasant
Your cry is like music.
I'm everything, you're nothing
I'm somebody, you're something
Beautiful nemesis, we can't do this.
Ingested you, digested you
I know, we can be each other's blessing
Good-bye, I'm taking a lesson
Your cry is so pleasant
Don't die - your cry is like music.
