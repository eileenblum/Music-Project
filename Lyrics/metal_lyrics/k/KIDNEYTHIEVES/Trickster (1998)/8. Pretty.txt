I'm pretty, what do I deserve
I feel pretty, until I walk out the door
I wonder when pretty's gonna bleed
My monster has all the time he needs
So I came home to feel ugly again
Feels better alone, pretty ugly again
If you come back around I may not let you in
Cause I don't understand what this pretty is.
You're so pretty, could I get the nerve
You said, "I love you, pretty"
What do I deserve
I wonder if pretty's gonna waste
My monster has all the time in the day
So I came home to feel ugly again
Feels better alone, pretty ugly again
If you come back around I may not let you in
Cause I don't understand what this pretty is.
I wonder what pretty has to say I want to feel pretty every day
I wonder what it's like to be pretty.
