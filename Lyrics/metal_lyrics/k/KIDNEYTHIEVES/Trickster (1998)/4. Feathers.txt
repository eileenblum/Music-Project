Rain made a place
For us to swim, to play
Inopportune devotion cannot be sound
So I take my lot of a few feathers from the sky
Into a ritual and let my spirit fly
Wake up, is this a dream of a dream of a dream?
Simple pleasures
Falling feathers
Skating on this machine
Alone between my trip and me.
What is real today?
Until the dawn, away
Rain soft aura potion condemns me now
So I take my lot of a few feathers from the sky
Into a ritual and let my spirit fly
Simple pleasures
Falling feathers
Skating on this machine
Alone between my trip and me.
The price of all this vanity is getting way too high
The maintenance of my sanity is taking too much time
Simple feathers
Falling feathers
7000 reasons to dream, 1 reason to live, 1 reason to me.
