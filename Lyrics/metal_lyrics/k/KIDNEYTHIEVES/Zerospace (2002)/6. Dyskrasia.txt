Do you wanna be on what I feel?
It looks so easy it's not that easy it should be simple but have you ever tried -
Stay above water, get in the water, drink it and breathe at the same time
Take your shirt, roll up your sleeve, tap on your vein, prepare to dream
Swimming in and out of space, dyskrasia
Do you wanna be on what I feel?
It looks so easy it's not that easy it should be simple but put away your pride
Hit fast forward, the edge is shorter, scream and make sure you keep it quiet
Feed real into your eyes and drain the way that makes you cry
Swimming in and out of space, dyskrasia
Do you want to be
Do you want to be
Do you wanna be on what I feel?
Do you want to be one
Do you wanna be on what I feel?
Swimming in and out of space, dyskrasia
Swimming in and out of space, dyskrasia
Do you want to be
Do you want to be on what I feel?
