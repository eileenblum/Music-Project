Where's your good fire, baby?
Glitter girl, woman
Waste your years
Glitter girl, woman
I know where you live
Hey, woman
Off my dreams
Glitter girl, woman
They're not what you think
Where's your good fire, baby?
Glitter girl, woman
Fox in your holy
Glitter girl, woman
I know that you sold me
Hey woman, let it go
Glitter Girl, woman
Don't pray for me anymore
Where's your good fire, baby?
There are skies that don't have clouds like you
There are skies that don't rain down like you
There are skies with a silver cloud
There are skies that you're not around
There are skies that paint a bluer blue
Glitter girl, woman
Waste your years
Glitter girl, woman
You're better than this
Hey woman, who are you for?
Glitter girl, woman
I'll pray for you some more
Where's your good fire, baby?
There are skies that don't have clouds like you
There are skies that don't rain down like you
There are skies with a silver cloud
There are skies that you're not around
There are skies that paint a bluer blue
Where's your good fire, baby?
