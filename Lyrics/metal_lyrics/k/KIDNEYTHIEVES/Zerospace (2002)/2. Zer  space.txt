I am a fallen zerÃ¸
Below the glaciers of the evil
I am a golden superhero
Above the sun and all the people
Space in your face I'm gonna drink
The f*cking ocean cause I ain't from a coast I'm just coastin
Said I was an afterthought you'd bring along,
Well who' u after now, bitch? Run, mother f*cka, run
And if you think I'm space-cakening
I've been in shit of rude awakening
And im floating high (but im always down)
Skip or trip to face the space or fake in this
In the middle I stay in place, skip or trip at zerÃ¸space And im floating high (but im always down)
Skip or trip to face the space or fake in this
I met a fellow zerÃ¸
He took me to the silver people
I said, "I think you are my hero"
+ we were one it all was clearer
Space in your face, it's the way to get you closer;
While you were sittin on your ass, *
-- I drank the f*cking ocean
ZerÃ¸space the way to get your kicks, but too many chefs in the kitchen could spoil the mix
I am a means until the end
I move a mountain with my hand
And im floating high (but im always down)
Skip or trip to face the space or fake in this
In the middle I stay in place, skip or trip at zerÃ¸space
And im floating high (but im always down)
Skip or trip to face the space or fake in this
And im high (but im always down)
Skip or trip to face the space or fake in this
