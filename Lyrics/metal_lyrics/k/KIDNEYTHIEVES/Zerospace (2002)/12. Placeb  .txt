No more wishing wells that never come around
No more growing trees without a ground
One, to take
One, to fly
One, to make
Use of all the treasure inside
One, too late
Act surprised
One, to play
And say it was just in your mind
On and on, hearts burn determined
One to take (breathe in a neptune sky)
Fly (through hands of animals)
Play awake
It killed the craving for the remedy they made you buy
On and on, hearts burn determined
Here's a placebo
Pick a placebo
No more sapphires burned
No more wishing wells that never come around
No more growing trees without a ground
One to take
One, to fly
One, to play
Here's a placebo
On and on, hearts burn determined
