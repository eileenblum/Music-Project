Thick drops of rain sound like the way you spanked me
Your pleasure thrills in every way you make me
Thick drops. .
All by myself and you're not here to take me
My red hot stain still makes you call me, baby
Tattooed your name, so you wouldn't forget to claim
If I see you're like your daddy and I should be gone
I would try to burn you but I won't
If I think that loving you could be just like a drug
I would try to burn you but I won't
It's all your graces, your deadly sins
Love and hate you it's so intense
If I could burn you walk away not see you anymore
I would try to burn you but I won't
Thick drops of rain sound like the way you miss me
Your windowpane steams like the way you kiss me
You're so profane, that's why I love the way
If I see you're like your daddy and I should be gone
I would try to burn you but I won't
If I think that loving you could be just like a drug
I would try to burn you but I won't
It's all your graces, your deadly sins
Love and hate you it's so intense
If I could burn you walk away not see you anymore
I would try to burn you but I won't
Like drops of rain your love has no pain
If I see you're like your daddy and I should be gone
I would try to burn you but I won't
If I think that loving you could be just like a drug
I would try to burn you but I won't
If I see that you're the precious I was looking for,
I would try to burn you but I won't
If I could burn you walk away not see you anymore
I would try to burn you but I won't
