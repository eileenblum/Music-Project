Serene dream
Soft easy winter
Watering the dry spots on the day
Water leaves of gray
Serene dream
Spend nowhere with me
Isn't far to nowhere
Rise and feel the bomb of fountains land
Close your eyes in front of nowhere
Language of no words
Spend nowhere with me
Serene dream
Free of thirst and pain
Heavy turns to cake
Serene dream
Where the ethers speak
It's a tall day
Spend nowhere with me
