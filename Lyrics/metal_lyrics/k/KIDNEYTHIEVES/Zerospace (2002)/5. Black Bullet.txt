Can you deal with the hallucination?
Can you steal the hallucination?
I can hear and feel all that you're thinking
Can you deal with the hallucination?
When I'm drowning in the sea, I am
When you're looking down at me, I am
When I'm walking in the streets, I am a bullet
When I'm looking and I find, I am
When I'm purer than the sky, I am
When I'm fucking with your mind, I am a bullet
In the eye, in the mirror, I am a black bullet
In the eye, in the mirror, I am
Alone, alone in this all.
Deal with the hallucination
Can you deal with the hallucination
When I'm walking on the line, I am
When I think that I could kill, I am
When I think that I am love, I am
I am a black bullet
In the eye, in the mirror, I am
In the eye, in the mirror, I am
In the eye, in the mirror, I am a black bullet
In the eye, in the mirror, I am
Alone, alone in this all.
Can you deal with the hallucination
Could you look me
In the eye,
In the mirror, when
In the eye, in the mirror, I am
In the eye, in the mirror, I am a black bullet
In the eye, in the mirror, I am
Alone, alone in this all.
