Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted
And someday, you'd leave me for somebody new
Worry, why do I let myself worry
Wondering, what in the world should I do
Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying, crazy for crying, and I'm crazy for loving you.
