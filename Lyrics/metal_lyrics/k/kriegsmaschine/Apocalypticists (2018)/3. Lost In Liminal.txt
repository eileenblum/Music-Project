A temporary descent into the depths of the underworld ends up an odyssey through pale Gehinnom.
Detached and stray, adrift, frail.
No fire to flicker.
No shadows to grow.
Rite of passage gone wrong.
Lost in liminal.
Warped patterns.
Fractured truths.
No shores in sight.
No trail ahead.
In radiance of a broken prism.
Led through scorched earth.
Forever in friction.
Without purpose.
No-way there.
No other world and no other truth.
No other aim and no other path.
No other will and no other fall.
No other mind.
No other heart.
A blind communion.
A dirge for the ego.
Lost in liminal.
