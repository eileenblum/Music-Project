This earth is arid and barren, adorned with charred remains of lost grace.
Always expanding. Devouring. Our steps held fast to its paths.
A new drought and a new disorder.
Darkness reigns. Locked still at the peak of leap of distress.
A lifetime of agony compressed and purified.
To breath sand and quaff cinders.
Seek harmony in silence and discord.
To caress the dream of refuge, and see it scorched to grey fucking ash.
Parched anima. Ash within. Worms crawl through sear veins.
A vain confession in anatomy of stasis.
Yet seekers shall follow those pathways of bane, woe, scourge and plague, and none shall see redemption.
Forlorn and desolate. Bereft and derelict.
Friction and fire without progress. Without reason.
A profound inner cataclysm.
Freak martyrdom. Numb carcass high upon the corrupt throne.
There is no shelter. There is no refuge. At one with zero.
None shall find peace. None shall be comforted.
None shall be restored and none shall see redemption.
This earth is arid and barren.
Born again in lands of drought. None shall see redemption.
