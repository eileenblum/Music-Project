Come forth!
Now I am become harm, to thrive upon perdition and feast upon the loss.
A tide of living darkness. Erasure of reason. Transition towards silence.
For every shattered dream, for every broken hope, there is no ease but there is conviction.
Row for judgement. Row for the fall.
This is the moksha you asked for.
Southways of nadir.
On to the great collapse.
All paths lead to rupture.
Suppress world. Hinder self.
True liberty lies in waste.
As the substance is torn asunder and as the vultures approach,
I bid farewell to grace.
A pit of starving hunger, a roaring beast of dearth.
A withered shrine of blight and bleached bones.
Lost in a reverie of revelation.
Writhen in anguish upon this grotesque truth.
Southways of nadir.
On to the great collapse.
All paths lead to rupture.
Suppress world. Hinder self.
True liberty lies in waste.
As the substance is torn asunder and as the vultures approach, I bid farewell to grace.
