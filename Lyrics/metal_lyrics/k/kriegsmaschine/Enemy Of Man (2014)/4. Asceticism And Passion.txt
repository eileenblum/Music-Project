Thus far inwards come few in this naught and this nowhere.
He who seeks the cross of Christ and falls alone, remains alone in his fall.
Thus far inwards come few in oblivion and all have failed.
He who seeks the cross of Christ shall fall and remain alone in his fall.
I am weary. I am drained. My prayer is adrift, my zeal bygone.
I am forsaken. I am lost. I am open for it to dwell.
An epiphany in starving darkness.
The hunger and the absence.
A new sun, whose rays are frozen and barbed.
Oceans of stasis. Beyond Gehinnom.
Void comes, void claims.
No more I live. See it come in blood and horror as it tears through shrouds of will, as it rips through veils of psyche to conquer and to devour.
See it come in death and doom to feed upon the seeds of doubt.
Erect its throne upon dry remnants of shattered soul.
Scio cui credidi.
My heart and life have become a grotesque sanctuary wherein it manifests with glimpse of its void.
Through every fiber of these putrid lungs each word resounds with bleak confidence andominous faith.
Scio cui credidi.
An epiphany in starving darkness.
The hunger and the absence.
Beyond Gehinnom.
Void comes, void claims, I shall rise high this new heart of stone, forever closed to his love.
A burden, yes, and a bitter reward for adoration of the three nails and true communion with God!
I am transformed. I am given purpose.
Scio cui credidi.
