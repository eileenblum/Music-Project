[performed by Kriegsmaschine]We are the ones who are living for shaking the world
We will set it on fire and leave it to burn
No one will tell us what to do and deny our rights
We're laughing at your damnations as same as the praises

'Cos it's time to kill
Death is calling, nearby crawling
Do what thou wilt
It will be the whole of the law

We proudly march and carry our destiny
Evil and might as much as no one can be
Still we are changing everything into light and flame
All what we touch will never be the same

Luciferian pride
In hellfire grows desire
Don't fear to die
A way to fulfill your life

Nothing can stop our dark ride
Heart for the brothers against other we fight
No hope for holy father and his son
Enemies embraced by death, one by one

One by one
