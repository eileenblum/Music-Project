Baptized in streams of rotting blood
I reject all life that was given unto me.
I close the gates, every one of the Ten,
breaking the keys, infecting the potential.
Divine presence, extinguish the world,
lock the time and fold the space.

The odour of decay is like a scent of lavender.
The all-consuming flames are as warmth of womb.

rehtaF!

Let no particle prevail, no single bond,
all shall return to Nothingness divine.

A new age is dawning, and it shall come to pass,
as all that was and is to come.
Blow the trumpets of desolation,
for he that is dead is free from sin.

Selah!

For all who bathe in bloodstained deceit,
for all who betray the urge to last,
the matter shall again loosen unto a single point:
a candle to be blown out by the breath of Satan.

The quote at the end of the song is actually from the movie Equilibrium, although some parts are cut, here is the full scene:

Sir... without the logic of process, is it not just mayhem -- what we have worked so hard to eradicate?
You must understand, Preston, that while you -- and even I -- may not always agree with it, it is not the message that is important, it is our obedience to it. Father's will. Call it faith. You have it, I assume?
