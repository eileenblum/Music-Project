[A quote from the movie "Stigmata":]
Who are you?
Il messaggero non Ã¨ importante.

Bless this teeth, bless these nails!
Raping and tearing the hopes of man.
Bless this mouth, bless this tongue,
Poisoning the world with seed you've sown.

A putrid worm in every crust, an empty word, an aimless path,
The broken bonds, the traces lost, rotten seeds of corruptor,
The Lord our God!

Rejoice, ye faithful!
For all is in vain, a new sun is shining, the prism hath failed!
Warped are the patterns and converged is the light
That shall burn my eyes with miracles to be seen.

And shall this light turn thine children to ash!
Make my flesh a crystal, shining with its rays.
Infection shall grow with each and every word, until life continues,
To replace it with void...
