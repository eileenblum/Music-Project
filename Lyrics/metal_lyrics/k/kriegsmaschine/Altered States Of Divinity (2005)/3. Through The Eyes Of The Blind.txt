Brethren!
Shall your loving hands strangle each other's throat
in praise of chaos, blossoming pukeridden flowers of doubt.
Let the hatred take over all what was said and thought
to erase logic and reason and turn the consciousness down.

Cut your skin and it shall bleed ambrosia,
for to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
Break your bones to find manna inside,
for every one that asketh receiveth.
Tear your eyes out and behold the Vision,
for he that seeketh findeth.

A thousand shapes, a thousand names,
a thousand shadows cast by a thousand flames.
Through the ears of the deaf, through the eyes of the blind,
through the mouth of the mute we shall sing these psalms!

We bring you these gifts, o Serpent,
through the ears of the deaf, through the eyes of the blind
and through the mouth of the mute,
through all of what the seed of death has already been planted in.
