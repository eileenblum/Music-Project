I carve these psalms deep into my flesh.
I sing the song of nihilation.
Send forth thy light, send forth thy truth.
Infected deathseed...
I will not fear what own flesh can do against me.

In Deo laudabo verbum, in Domino praedicabo sermonem.
Multum lava me ab iniquitate mea.
Et a peccato meo munda me.

Scar by scar, wound by wound, sanctify, stigmatize,
enshrine twisted flesh into sigils five.
Open the seals and set the Devil free!

In black delight I open my skin,
spilling pestilent unlight.
The deathseed shines so bright
and the shadow of reason is scattered.

Through burning seals in warm pulp of life
the wretched will of YHVH is broken.
An angel would fall to perceive its glance,
how can a man rise to touch the divine?
Infected deathseed, genesis nihilated,
existence perished, the Word erased...
