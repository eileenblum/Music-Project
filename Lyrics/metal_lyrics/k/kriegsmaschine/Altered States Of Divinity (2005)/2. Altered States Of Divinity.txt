My flesh and my heart have fainted away,
and I became a blaze, a reflection of the void.
Locked within the maze of serpent scales,
his light shall gently scorch the earth.

The tongues we speak are of the dead
and what dwells in us is not humane.
Oh, divine flame, leading existence
towards endless enthropy... Chaos!

Let the Lord be in our hearts and on our lips,
within the luscious saliva we spit into open mouths.
May the words of the gospel wipe away the stars
and may their years be counted... to nothing. Nothing!

Canite Deo! Canite regi nostro. (Let's sing to God! Let's sing to our king.)
Quia rex terrÃ¦ Deus, canite. (Because God is king of the earth, let's sing.)
Quia ipse Deus, Deus noster. (Because he is God himself, our God.)
Dominus salvabit me. (The Lord shall save me.)

Canite Deo! Canite regi nostro.
Quia rex terrÃ¦ Deus, canite.
(Quia ipse Deus, Deus noster.)
Dominus salvabit me.

Infect through me! Ruin through me!
Burn my lungs with the praise, tear my mouth with the name!
Bleed me! And shall my blood drain the world to ashes,
with each single drop dissolving the bonds of creation.

It looks all new seen through undead eyes,
with earthborn flesh pulsating with its light.

May the words of the gospel wipe away our kin
and may their years be counted to nothing. Nothing!
All you, earthborn! All you, sons of men!
Through your bloodveins shall flow the praise!

Canite Deo! Canite regi nostro.
Quia rex terrÃ¦ Deus, canite.
Quia ipse Deus, Deus noster.
Dominus salvabit me.

Canite Deo! Canite regi nostro.
Quia rex terrÃ¦ Deus, canite.
(Quia ipse) Deus, Deus noster.
Dominus salvabit me.
