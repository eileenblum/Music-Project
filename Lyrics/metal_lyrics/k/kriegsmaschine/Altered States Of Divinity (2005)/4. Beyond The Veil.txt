The laughter of angels is in the continuous litany of
the agonized newborn, perished in humiliation, torture and abuse.

For they all shine with glimpses of salvation to come.

The never-ending humane thirst for iniquity is being
quenched with words and images of dignity of its own kind raped.

For they all shine with glimpses of salvation to come.
