[performed by Kriegsmaschine]Let these words be as sand in the cogwheels of reason,
as a malign disturbance in the sustainment of universe,
and let each quark of this degenerated microcosm
stand as a citadel of cold and deliberate hatred.
Let there come a glorious error in the patterns of the world.
Let the tainted foundations of reality crumble
and let us hope nothing comes afterwards,
so the gravest of mistakes we all blindly wander in
will finally come to an end.

Annihilate prime factor.
Thrice deny divine restraint. Reject all things finite and infinite.
Annihilate prime factor.

Towards the tainted omega-pleroma, so perfect
in its warped beauty, it comes to burn the earth
and our hearts shall welcome the flames
with purest of joys.
Haunted by the voices of living breathing cosmos,
Isis! Cunt of pneuma, whence all floweth,
exceeding the capacity of pure abstraction,
digitized Logos, blistered into matter.
