[performed by Infernal War]Behold the
Botomless depth.
The abysicc storm is
Coming. See the
Walls of lies
Crumbling, see all
Creation deforming.
Formless, timeless,
Hidden, undeniable.
Come, oh ageless
Darkness, shatter
My flesh, facture
My soul. Against
The soul, against the
Flesh, I greedily
Breath the
Nothingness of
Death. Longing for
Apathy and
Puryfing
Emptiness, life
Becomes an urdent
Prayer for loss. Into
The voertes of
Naught, towards the
Intersection.
Implosion of
Blackness, the path
Of sickening
Isolation. Into the
Resplendent
Obscurity, where
The cause is no
More, towards
Perdition, against
The flesh, against
The soul. Formless.
Ageless. Timeless.
Altered. Awaken.
Dead inside.
Against the self, life
Instinct reversed.
Primary masochistic
Worship
Transgressed. Empty
Soul euphoria,
Catharic collapse,
Total eclipse, a holy
Union with nothing.
Into the voertex of
Naught, through the
Mazes of
Illumination, where
Endless disharmony
Shines with dreadful
Perfection. Into the
Resplendent
Obscurity, where
The cause is no
More, towards
Perdition, against
The flesh, against
The soul.
