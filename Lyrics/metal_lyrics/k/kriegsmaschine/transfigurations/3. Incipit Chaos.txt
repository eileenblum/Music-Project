[performed by Infernal War]Global delirium
Followed by demise.
Universal funeral.
Welcome to the end
Of all. Answer the
Call of Megiddo.
Corrode the
Universe, drain all
Life, taste the tears
Of false god flowing
Down the world's
Bronek spine.
Incipit Chaos.
Welcome to the end
Of all. Incipit Chaos.
All hail the end of
Maha-Kalpa.
Rejoice in splendor
Of loss and
Inversion, let this
Rotten ship sink at
Last. Burn the
Malodorous shroud
Of illusion at the
Hoyful twilight of
Human dust.
Monuments still
Unseen. Swine
Before pearls.
Transcendent
Horror as reaping
Time descends.
Incipit Chaos.
Welcome to the end of
Maha-Kalpa.
Rejoice in splendor
Of loss and
Inversion, let this
Rotten ship sink at
Last. Burn the
Malodorous shroud
Of illusion at the
Joyful twilight of
Human dust. The
Armour of common
Logic punctured by
The sword of faith.
Cultivating spiritual
Gangrene, always on
The path to
Nowhere.
