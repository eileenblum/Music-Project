[performed by Kriegsmaschine]Choked on own redemption in this dark night without end,
at the failed attempt to hold the last of grounds
What bitter irony in this cadaverous obedience
Punctured lung prayer, stiff limb gesture

As the pillars of ego collapse under his gentle, wounding hand
Arche point blank, fastforward theosis
Caressing teeth of a starving God
A communion with the void

Deathdriven. Gracefallen.
Numb. Stray. Truth/lie redefined.
Onward thanatos, onward destrudo,
Onward death and onto the great darkness!

Cease and abandon

I shall cease and I shall abandon.
I shall revert, descend.
Become as a stone the temple is founded upon.
Become a stone. Numb. Stray.

Forsaken, broken
Ripe for conversion
