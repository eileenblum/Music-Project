[performed by Kriegsmaschine]I! - the wanderer, between these sins and sights (worlds of sins)
Like a shattered vessel, never to sail these waters again
Found nothing ascending into the highest suns
I have descended to the borders of divine being

World as a gateway to dark and cold deserts
Of Mute Inanimate Nothing
Who once lost what I have lost
Will never rest under this tree again

I've entered the path I never ever wanted
I lost this life for ash and mud
My father left me the way I never wanted
And now keeps silent in my last sacrifice

Eloi Lama Sabachthani
Only emptiness stares at me from the abyss
