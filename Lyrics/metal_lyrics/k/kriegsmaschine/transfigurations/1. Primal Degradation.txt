[performed by Infernal War]Breed in me! The
Essence of
Transformation lies
In dread and terror,
At the treshold of
Pitch black
Madness and cold
Deliberate self-
Destruction...
Primal
Degradation...
Intoxicated with the
World's sweet decay
I daze myself with
Smoke of the
Burning I. Deeper
And deeper down,
Into the nothingness,
Rise O Black Flame
And burn me from
Inside! Beyond
Freedom and
Enslavement where
Mundane reason
Matters not. In the
Shrine of rapture
And madness I
Rebuild the image of
The most wrathful
God. This is the iron
Will of conversion,
Awaken by the
Mighty dragon's
Breath. On the
Quest of terror and
Degradation, be my
Guide, oh luscious
Flame of death.
Beyond the veil of
Foul
Misconceptions
Where humane
Means nothing at
All, in the desert of
Inert execrations
The living temple I
Am become. This is
The iron will of
Reversion, awaken
By the mighty
Dragon's breath. On
The quest of terror
And degradation, be
My guide, oh
Luscious flame of
Death. Reborn
Transfigurated,
Devoted to naught.
Reborn,
Transfigured,
Devoted to loos.
Reborn,
Transfigured,
Devoted to fall.
Reborn,
Transfigured,
Devoted to all.
