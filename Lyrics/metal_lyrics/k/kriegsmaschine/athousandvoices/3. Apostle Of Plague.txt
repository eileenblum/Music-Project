[A quote from the movie "The Believer":]
It's not about Abraham's faith, it's about God's power.
I can make you do anything I want, even kill your own son.
Because I'm everything and you're nothing.

Sanctify these scars and bless this flesh
As a gateway for the eighth plague
Gaze through these eyes and speak through this mouth
Wash these hands in blood of the world

All flesh shall sing the psalm of annihilation
All earth shall hear the voice of the praise
All flesh shall bathe in new light of salvation!

I am Omega, I am the flame
I am the balm and I am the bane
Redemption, salvation, dispersion
An apostle of plague... Ascension!

Like the wind which driveth the dust from the face of the earth

There are no speeches nor languages,
where their voices are not heard.
Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth:
and their words unto the ends of the world.

Behold!
The words are spoken and the earth withereth
Cleansed from the greatest sin: the seed of life
My heart is joyful within me.
Death abideth within me.
