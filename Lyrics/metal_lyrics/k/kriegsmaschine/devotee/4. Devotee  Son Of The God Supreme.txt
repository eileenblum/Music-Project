...there are some of them that stand here, who shall not taste death, 'til they see the kingdom of God coming in power.

Descent
We've had razors deep in our wrists
Prepared a safe place to grow
For we long for your blessing (curse!)
Which will grant us the power and will

How to get closer to the core
To feel the breath of pest
Taste the ice cold blood
Lose all the senses, reform and redeem

Cleanse the mind through cathartic hatred
On the border of control where man and beast unite
The blinding white light of His eyes' gleam
The absolute power of misanthropy and wrath

For the wisdom of the flesh is death; Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God; And they who are in the flesh, cannot please God. For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.

Devotee - had blades in our flesh
Devotee - something has changed, something had grown
Devotee - sacrificed the hope to see the truth
Devotee - son of the god supreme

Nothing came and nothing had gone
Future shines in the shadows of the old

"Ever drifting down the stream--
Lingering in the golden gleam--
Life, what is it but a dream?"
