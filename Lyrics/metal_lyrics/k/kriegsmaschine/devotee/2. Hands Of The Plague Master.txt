It's time to wear the masks of red
Greet the new age with brand new plagues
Let them spread, let them purge
Stick in (the) world's throat our (own) set of rules

We are the hands that push the world
Towards the new inflamed beginning
We have opened our hearts and minds
And set free the Serpent - which we had imagined

(We've) seen deep into our scars
(We) inhaled the burning Dragon's breath
(we) tasted the glimmering Devil's blood
Which colour human words can't describe

The time has come to end all dignity
Cut the shit short once and for good
Break the sigils on poisonous vials
Set our little friends free

We live our lives through hatred
Which grows inside us strong
We are the hands of the Plague Master
That will strangle the world alright

We are the
Hands of the Plague Master
Hands of the Plague Master
Hands of the Plague Master
Hands of the Plague Master
