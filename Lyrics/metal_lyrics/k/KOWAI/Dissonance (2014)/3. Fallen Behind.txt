So far from here I can see the light
Pushing through the veil of grey
Mesmerizing me
I've fallen behind
And now my shadows are too dark
To pick up the pace, I am astray

Surrounding me
I am not alone anymore
But this is not where I belong

This void not as empty as I had thought
My fellow fallen ones
A company of misery
Through the veil of gray
I can barely see the outline
Of some distant destination

I, I've fallen behind
And it seems I can't go any further, oh no

Surrounding me
I am not alone anymore
And we are equal in the fading dawn

I fell behind
