So innocent I've been
Gazing at the world
With endless possibilities
A vision clouded
By another's bliss

I'm no longer who I was
And what I now behold
Merely drifting
Away from right
Away from reason

Once I was all of you
And you all could be me
My feet found my own path
Silently unknown
Safe and undisgraced
Still untouched by any testimony

I have been to where I shouldn't have
An echo of before
You made me wander
Looking for rest
And finding only chaos

So I wander evermore
In your shadow I was hidden
I hide
From all the pain
And all the shame you made me feel
From what has been
And how I'll never fully heal
I hide
