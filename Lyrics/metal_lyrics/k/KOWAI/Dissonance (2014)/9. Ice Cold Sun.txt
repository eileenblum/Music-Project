As I turned my back to you
The knife was twisted
And slowly cold surrounds me now
Out here I am on my own
Fragile wings were broken
Long before I tried to fly

Oh
Solitude
I will not
Feel again

Where is my home, where am I safe
In this cold world, I'm here to stay
How did I forsake my fate
I'm all alone, it's all too late

I see shadows drawing near
From the corner of my eye
Offering serenity
Forever I will lie alone
Helpless on my back
In the ice cold sun

A winter chill to shield my soul
If only I could fight my fate
A summer breeze to soothe my ache
If only I could feel relief

When did I
Become so numb
Now I'll never feel again
For you
When did I
Become so still
This is how it ends

This is how it ends
