We've been waiting all this time
Hoping for another day
Still we do not make a sound
As moments pass us by

With our eyes growing cold
And our dreams, they're getting old
We lie awake remembering
All that's left to do

We're too young to die
Too old to be alive
Not enough to live
Too much for life

We surrender to demand
It's all that we have known
As it dawns upon our minds
We still stand alone

With our hearts growing cold
And our dreams, they're getting old
We lie awake remembering
All we failed to do
