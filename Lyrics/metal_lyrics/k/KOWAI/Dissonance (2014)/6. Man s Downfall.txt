Hidden underneath the mask
Kneel as you betray me
Bow as you hate me
I, I accept

Greed has been man's downfall
And will be so again
Forever I serve
Forever you shame me
In the end
There is no mercy for the weak
Dispose of the lesser
Think yourself the better one
I accept

You do not wish to serve
With shameless eyes
I humbly look away
As my throne is overtaken

Greed has been man's downfall
And will be so again
Forever I serve
Forever you blame me
In the end
There is no mercy for the weak
Dispose of the lesser
Think yourself the better one
I accept
