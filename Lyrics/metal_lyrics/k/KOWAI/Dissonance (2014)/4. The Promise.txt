Only in your eyes
Reflection of a need
I am good enough
When in my own
A slumber is born
To hide the sight of chance

In the dead of night
This sentiment finds home
And I deny myself
What I need most
Lies near to me still
Yet always out of reach

Leave me
Where I will wash away
Forget me
While I will fall behind
Of the promise
I once held

Now I see
A summer breeze to free me
That I took for a storm
Shields set up too high
A sudden urge
A forgotten sensation
A wish denied
A truth so far forsaken

The sorrow haunts me still
An image to defeat
Your words to keep me sane
All I never knew
My thoughts were never true
If only I could see like you

Promise me
Once again
Sew the seams
Cross the line

Promise me
Another dawn
For all my dreams
There's still time

Just promise me
And I'll believe you
Take my fear
Change my mind
