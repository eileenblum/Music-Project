What am I to do with my one wish
When my heart is willing
But my hands too weak
I don't want to face the fear I feel
But in this land of false pretense
Can't hide my choice to yield
(choice to yield)

Today again I choose surrender
(I'll be here)
And my willing heart grows weaker
(in the dark)
While my hands embrace the shame
The only thing I'm always worthy of
(forever more)

All this pressure drowns me easily
So I'll be overpowered
And not to blame for this
The scenes of pain I hide with a smile
At night they come to play here
With haunting tears of sorrow
(of sorrow)

Again I cannot force myself
I'll be here forever
Cannot leave where I'm deprived
Of what would make me whole
