Indulging again
Clinging to the dark
My dreams are all that I am
Lost in my own heart

Once more failing
Once more falling

Find your pride
And leave behind
Salvation
Redemption
Still the same
Your last change

Lying again
Holding on to pain
A disregard for everything
Spreading like the blackest stain

Once more numbing
Once more succumbing

Find your pride
And leave behind
Salvation
Redemption
Trembling hands
Your last chance
