As the snow fell down on me
My fate became so much more clear
Looking up I watched the clouds
And I felt the cold on my lips

The silence overtook me still
In this wintry dawn I held myself
As I tried to let go of life
With all the strength I'd left

I was loved and I was lost
I could not be found again
I was loved and I was lost
And I will not be found again

Face your fear
Lose yourself and leave me here
Own your grief and let me go
I can't take it anymore
Don't torment me with your pain
Leave this life and let me be
Rotting in your misery
Leave this place and let me go
End it all on earth below
Your earth below

In the wind my hair was caught
So shattered thoughts of change
And I fell like the leaves I cherished
Until the earth caressed my bones
