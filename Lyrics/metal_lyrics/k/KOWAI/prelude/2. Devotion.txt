Hold me I'm so fragile
Feel me trembling
Longing to be by your side
I'd give up everything

Oh how much longer
Should I resist this pain?

Dreaming of the perfect love
Together 'til we die
Oh no this is never enough
You're here, so am I

Look at me, torn apart
I obey, your every word
By command, my will is yours
Set me free (from) this torment

Domination, agony
Regrets about, this fear in me
Never will I, see the sun
Your commands I can't
Resist

Don't think you can fool me
There'll always be a way
This bond everlasting
Every second every day
