I wonder
Why don't you wonder
About the wonders
Of this life

I see
Why you can't see
What I now see

And the dreams
They shattered in front of my eyes
So it seems
All is veiled now by your lies
I can't believe
We still hide in our disguise
We're all deceived
Waiting until it dies

And I long
Next to you I long
For a night so long
To find reasons for existence
