Indulging again
Clinging to the dark
Once more failing
Once more falling

Find your pride
And leave behind
Salvation, redemption
Still the same
Your last change

Lying again
Holding on to pain
Once more numbing
Once more succumbing

Find your pride
And leave behind
Salvation, redemption
Still the same
Your last change

Find your pride
And leave behind
Salvation, redemption
Trembling hands
Your last chance
