As if the light never shone
And humans never thought
All that are left shall be subject to suffer
All left shall suffer

The escapers made their pact and left
And light shines on all living things above ground

All death has eaten itself
So it turns to life

So the fabric of our atoms can stay secure
And time's senses continue to sense

So death comes and failures add up

And we can only let time brush over us
Let the memories pile up until the final plane
And the memory pile explodes into the Universe

The way of the eternal
Is only through will
To force the conscious mind
Into the void of Death
