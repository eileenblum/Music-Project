Rot encompassing stone
To peel back this reckoning
Masses of brain masters pitted
As life returns this passing waste

Proud to be living in the echo
The mist of all things combined
Unfocused apparitions stream
Cresting in total divinity

Not one with them
Seperately crushing
Glory amounted less in secret
Blood trees stand on
In slow stone centuries

Petrifying the cast-offs of time
Seeking the balance
Acknowledge the dust and light
Acknowledge divinity's mortality
