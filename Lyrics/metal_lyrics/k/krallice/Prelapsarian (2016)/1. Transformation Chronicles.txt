Trembling beyond death
As far as one can be
Amidst the others
Those who carry and relay the rebirth
Assigning passage and growth

The controlling desire
In the hands of the sick
The illusion of nobility
Disrespecting the point of life
While the arrogance of worry
Spreads sores of stress and bone

Sailing beyond this ascension awake
Proudly screaming of victory over death
Thousands of earth corpses later
Hail transformation!

("six grandfathers")
Amongst those desecrated
Sacred mountains
The faces of false gods
Watch over the land
Watch over us all
