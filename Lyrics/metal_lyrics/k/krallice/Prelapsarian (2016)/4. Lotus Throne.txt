Breathe your last, before
Kissing the icons edge
Infinitely gentle
With their enormous wings

Now the triple vow
Unparalleled beauty
One covered in ashes
Within reason's grasp

Every humiliation, every indignity
Every human collapse

Smothered under ashes of legend
Infinite radiating gaze
The silence
Infinite diffusing gaze

Lotus throne
Infinite suggestion
Of one immortal gaze

Presence of life
Eternal rebirth
In the green and gold
