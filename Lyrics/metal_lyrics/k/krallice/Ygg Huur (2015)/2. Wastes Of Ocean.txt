[Initiated: Marston, lyrics: McMaster]

A final mirage enchants
Blood engulfs the eves

Wending through the cycles of mania
1,000 tiny ropes drag a body to the ground
The canvas of the dream a filthy, tattered rag
The gods gigantic in power

Swing after swing of the iron axe
Shoreline conflagration as I take a last look

Exile through wastes of ocean
Last flames that engulfed my world
