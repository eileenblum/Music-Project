[Initiated: McMaster, lyrics: McMaster]

Clot and freeze
Into fetid venous ropes
A groaning pulsing mesh of shackles

Engrams overlay anew, day of Ashura, flagellant march,
To mock our impotent cries to bind

And now this bed is a tomb
And home's threshold gives only a sinking chill

Because no matter what, it ends this way
With me taking your body to the fire
