[Initiated: Barr, lyrics: Barr]

[Part 1 "Separation"]

Humming separately away
Left inward with untrained process
Towards separation
From the path that bleeds towards creation
Persistence of the morose
Murder thy kingdom of ash
Self deceivingly stretched upon nails
A forceless act
Science is a god
A tool like all gods

[Part 2 "The Guiding"]

Connectivity to the open sky
Beholding the kingdom of earth
Strangling in vines
Crawling through life's incessance
Insect messiah, body and blood
Mutual sustenance
Human blood on rotting leaves
