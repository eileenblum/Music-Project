[Initiated: Barr, lyrics: Barr]

Breath of life and cloud
Black clouds which obscure
And devour celestial beings
Cosmic feast
Dizzy from all forms of blood
Beast god man
All screaming
Agony in collective ignorance
Called upon by thyself
Thyself being a part of all life
In the sickness
Quarantined in pure paranoia
