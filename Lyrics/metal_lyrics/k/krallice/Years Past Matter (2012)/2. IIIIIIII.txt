Carried over and off
left back timing in miles
sheer immanence
shelved behind other things
beholding impermanence
and felt the founding
was following in the fire
flickering ancience
and forward movement
time begs not your condolence
respect in passage
spend time in time
let the anger simmer
into the hair of the oath
forestall all judgment as heresy
the corner awaits
as this plane fades
and morphs
the interloper must exit
time folds
caught in the...
dignity take grace and kneel
shadow not this blessed indifference
fear shall maintain everlastly
