Before the drugged fog cleared
I'd embraced the notion of dreams
No more an inky black retreat
make my rest a proscenium
for some nascent ideal self
or a phantasmagoria unweighted
unchained from the wheel

But every night, it's the same
Fractal Failures of daily life
Endless pursuit
Fear, helplessness, anxiety, and guilt
