Consciousness resuming at a deeper level
Forgotten realms remembered, false constructs revealed
Unhindered reflexive intuition, abstract insights: revelations
Scrape away the mundane dross

Glimpsing higher insights
Trusted self reflections - gnostic introspection

Buried deep and hidden inside, we feel the truth but hear the lie
The self deceit, our thoughts clouded by fear and doubt

Lost in a world of confusion, disillusioned
Deluded into disbelief of our own nature
The voice inside is speaking but weâre deaf to it

Lying to ourselves, lie to each other
Hiding from ourselves
Hiding from the other, empathy is smothered
Distrust one another
War in our minds, wars in the world

In this flesh prison
Drive to supersede
In endless ego

As if every synapse struck out to rule,
To be king.
