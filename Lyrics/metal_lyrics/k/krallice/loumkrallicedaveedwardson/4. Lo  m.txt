LoÃ¼m the giant black obelisk stands before me
Nothing left behind, nowhere but forward
No way to go forward but up, up
The mighty wall seems to touch the sky
There's no way around, or stay and die

The forces behind me are drawing ever closer
No choice left, I must climb the ancient black monolith

Climbing, climbing, ever higher
Foothold by small foothold
Careful not to fall from the growing heights
Making haste to escape what lies below

Feeling the presence of evil nearing its way toward me
Ascending the titan LoÃ¼m is the only path to sanctuary

Half-awake, half-dead, exhausted and half-crazed
Has this crossing been hours or has it been days?
Hungry, tired, in a trance, yet I must push on
With bloody hands and feet and knees I near the crest of LoÃ¼m
As this odyssey nears its close I fear what lies beyond
