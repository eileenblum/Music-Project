Little man is rank mankind
Common people's worthless lives

Little man, you're useless to me
I hate you, you have no value
Here to serve the likes of me

Businesses built on your backs and your toil
Fills the pockets of those with hands too good to touch the soil

Rank mankind
Rank mankind
Rank mankind
Rank mankind

Stuck in this game of their creation
They made the rules and declared themselves the winners

We bought and sold your dreams since before you took your first breath
We've owned you since your birth, and we'll own you 'til your death
Our power is immutable, we are the modern kings
And we'll always have a piece of you you're all just our playthings
We are the secret masters and you are our slaves
