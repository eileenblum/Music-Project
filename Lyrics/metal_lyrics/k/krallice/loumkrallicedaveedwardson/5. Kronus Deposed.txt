Distrust, fear
Separation is the division that binds us
Broken minds in a distorted world, out of balance
Incongruous and tenuous

The fear that permeates this world is a sickness
A plight on mankind, a blight to our world

This monstrosity of creation moves forth
Earth constantly threatens
Age constantly beckons

The looming is beyond tangible
