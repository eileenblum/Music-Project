Shimmer take me
Eyes closed, felt light
Prayer in wait
Surrendered in consciousness
For the sake of the blending

Fear spindles
Reaching down, wire stiff
Balancing ground and the diaphanous
Reaching through planet and life

Prayer mists and evaporates
Dousing the earth
In lust and envy
Coded well wishings
And lip service

Insults hurled at gods
Bitter agitation at the audacity
Christian imposition, disbelieving such
Sold again through this bottomless funnel
