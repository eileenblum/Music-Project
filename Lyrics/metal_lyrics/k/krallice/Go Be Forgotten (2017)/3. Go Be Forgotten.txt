Stuck in the place where people go to be forgotten
So go be forgotten

Difficult to acknowledge completion
Time fades to grey
I sit and stare at the future
Stuck still
Letting it all pass

Amidst the shaking
Death winds snake their way forth
Trembling with the earth tonight
Life functions on and will survive
Organic matter shall again arrive at consciousness

Planning what and how to sacrifice
All is not possible
Leaving behind the pleasures
Better for it perhaps

Scorching an era of evolution away
Go be forgotten
