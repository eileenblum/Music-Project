[Music &amp; lyrics - Mick Barr]

Enriched in wind with temperature guidance,
Sands surrounded in dry cold
With lichened stone and unwanted growth,
Nearer to water than before.

Time enforces the differences
Forgotten pathways back,
Evolving land power

The time leading has gone on out of sheer weight pressure
With physical properties unexplainable in human tongue.
All reprimanding by the forces of power will be,
The only possible outcome of probable thought
The meaning of everything meant gets obscured,
By willingness to focus on survival.
