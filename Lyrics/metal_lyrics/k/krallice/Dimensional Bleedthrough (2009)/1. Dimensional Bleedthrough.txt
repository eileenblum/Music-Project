[Music &amp; lyrics - Mick Barr]

Creator mind lending healing
To beings that ceaselessly assist the evolution of the spirit,
Hate courses through the weakest minds,
All believe their questioning purpose,
Forcing the world out,
Allowing dimensional bleedthrough

Thoughts being encased in life alone,
Thoughts can exist free of life
Without
Beings belong in denial,
Evolution depends on denial,
Voices of spiritual reason
All beg for the next step

Life thought spirit as one
No longer vain in holy voids,
Being cast out in brightness
Fathered by brightness
