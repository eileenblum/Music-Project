One week two days three thousand miles away,
A turn for the worst later.
The keep sakes in my mind are wearing thin.
And I'll keep fighting through,
It doesn't seem too hard.
The medical moon is ours.

Help me, help me
My paper heart reads weak.
Find me, find me a doctor...
To get me on my feet.
My eyes that stare.
Your lack to care.
Keeps my veins on ice,
Keeps my veins on ice.

Bury your head into my shoulder,
As it may be the last time I hold you.
The room turns white,
With those lights so bright.
My eyes they'll close.
I hope I wake to see...
This medical moon set free.

Help me, help me
My paper heart reads weak.
Find me, find me a doctor...
To get me on my feet.
My eyes that stare.
Your lack to care.
Keeps my veins on ice,
Keeps my veins on ice.

Set it free,
Let me wake from this slumber.
I'm alive,
Death won't take my name yet.

Help me, help me
My paper heart reads weak.
Find me, find me a doctor...
To get me on my feet.
My eyes that stare.
Your lack to care.
Keeps my veins on ice,
Keeps my veins on ice.

Get up, get up
I can't hear you anymore.
I'm fed up, fed up
With the same old bore.
