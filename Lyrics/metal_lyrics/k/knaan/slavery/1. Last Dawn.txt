Bond of two
Wasted,
By a word
World of lies,
Now dead

Homicide
Of mind
Numb by the shock
Surprise
Drowning inside
A pool of sorrow
Milked out of hope
By those who care

No longer wish to see the sky
No longer wish to live a lie
Fed up with false truth
No more to suffer
Not another day!

[Chorus:]
Fading into the unknown
Bleeding, rotting all alone
The fire of life is long gone
This is the Last Dawn!

Twisted thoughts
Inside
Trying to hide
Failure on all levels

The mixed elixir
Of two now broken
The one thrives, the other rot
One lived on, the other never forgot

No longer wish to see the sky
No longer wish to live a lie

Enough with this pathetic life
This Is The Last Dawn Of Me

[Chorus]
