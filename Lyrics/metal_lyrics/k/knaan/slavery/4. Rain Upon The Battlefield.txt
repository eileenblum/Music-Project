Off to the battle we go
Without fear
We know
Death is near

''Rain drops upon my companions' heads
Who are covering themselves
And upon the dead
Who are covering no more''
[Judas Amichai]

I will not fall 'till I kill
Though nothing but sorrow is real
I will raise up my sword
And kill to serve the lord

[Chorus:]
Rain upon the battlefield
Lived to see my hopes fulfilled
I have killed to stay alive
Now, side by side we'll strive

Oh god salvage my soul
Before the rushing end
Blood rains down from the sky
Cleansing the land

Jehovah's tears falling down
Soaking the pain
Waged the battle, won the war
Now we can slowly decay

[Chorus]
