ITS HARD TO REMEMBER LIFE AS IT ONCE WAS
INNOCENCE HAD A VOICE, YOUR WORDS WERE ONCE STRONG
A WHISPER IN THE DARK THAT DOESNâT TRANSLATE
YOUR YOUTH HAS DISSOLVED ITSELF, AND YOU JUST MASK THE PAIN

SLEEP AWAY THE DAYS THAT STOLE YOUR LAUGHTER
BLAME AWAY THE BLAME THAT FOLLOWED AFTER
LAY TO WASTE THE ONES THAT TRIED TO HEAL YOU
SLEEP AWAY

YESTERDAY BROUGHT THE END TO FACELESS MEMORIES
ITS TIME THAT WE CLOSE THE GATES ON FOREIGN VOICES
SELF MEDICATED MAN THAT SPEAKS IN TONGUES NOW
WATER THATâS FREE OF SIN CANT WIPE YOUR DEMONS CLEAN

NOT THE START, NOR THE END
NO LONGER BOTHERS, NOR FRIENDS
THE SOLDIERS DISAPPEARED, I WATCHED HIM DROWN IN FEAR
WEAKNESS GROWS
