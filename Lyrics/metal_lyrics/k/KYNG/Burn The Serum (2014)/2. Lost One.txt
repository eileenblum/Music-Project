YOUâRE MISBEHAVING
UNDER THE GUN
UNTAMED AND BROKEN LIKE THE LAST ONE

EAGER AND FACELESS
WHAT HAVE I DONE?
TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOUâRE THE LOST ONE

ITâS HARD FOR ME TO PLAY ALONG
IâM NOT THE ONE
SO YOUNG AND NAÃVE SO BLIND AND NAÃVE

PERSISTENCE TIRES ME
YOUâRE RUNNING OUT OF TIME
A HARLOT OUT OF TRUST
MISTAKES YOUâLL TRY AND TRY

YOUâRE STUMBLING OVER
YOU KNOW YOUR SCHEME
ITâS NOT WHO YOU ARE, ITS WHO IS IN YOU
