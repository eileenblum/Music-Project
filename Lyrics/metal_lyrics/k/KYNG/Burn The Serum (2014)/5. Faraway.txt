YOU DONâT OWE ME ANYTHING
YOUâRE NOT FOOLING ME
HOPE OF SOME UN-LUCKY PEARL
THERE ARE NO FREE INFIDELITIES

STANDING OVER LIFELESS WINGS
THAT WONT FLUTTER ON
EYES ARE DRAINED OF ALL ITS HUE
THEY FEEL THE PAIN BUT SHOW NO HARM

AND IT TAKES YOU DOWN, AND IT TAKES YOU FAR AWAY

VEILS PILE ON MY BED
SLUMBER SEEPING IN
TORTURED, WOUNDED LITTLE GEMS
THAT ONLY WANT TO SHINE FOR ME

ILL WATCH YOU HIDE AWAY
RECALLING WHAT WAS LOST IN THE LONG RUN
SO YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE ELSE
TO RUN AND HIDE FROM YOU
