LIGHT THE CANDLES WITH THE TEARS FROM YOUR EYES
DID YOU STAND UP OR COME DOWN TO HIDE
BUT CAN YOU BE LATE, CAN YOU JUST STAY.
COULD YOU LOVE?

WEIGHED DOWN I'M HOLDING YOU CLOSE
BREAK DOWN, BREAK DOWN, BROKE DOWN AND CRIED
BUT CAN YOU BE SOLD, CAN YOU JUST STAY
COULD YOU KNOW?

THEN YOU CAN BRING IT ALL DOWN
YOU CAN LET THOSE TEARS FLY
YOU WONT HAVE TO FOLD IT INSIDE

PAPER HEART ROSE MESMERIZED
TATTERED, WITHERED, PICKED OUT INSIDE
BUT I KNOW YOU CANT STAY, YOU CANT BE LATE
ILL LET YOU GO, LET YOU GO HOME

THEN I CANT BRING IT ALL DOWN
I CANT LET MY TEARS FLY
I WONT HAVE TO FOLD IT INSIDE
