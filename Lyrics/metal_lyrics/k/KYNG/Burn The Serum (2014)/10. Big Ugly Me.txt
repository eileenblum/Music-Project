I WILL DREAM THIS LIFE AWAY
THAT WHICH STILL REMAINS CAN NOT HIDE
FROM MY EYES
HIDDEN TRUTH ARE NOT THE SAME

NEVER KNEW MY NAME NOT TO LIE
YOU CRIED

ALL THE PAIN THAT I HAVE CAUSED
DISAPPEARED FROM MY LIFE
ALL THE BROKEN HEARTS AND TEARS
IâVE LEFT BEHIND

OH BIG UGLY ME

HOW CAN I GO ON WHEN I'M LOST
WHERE I STAND IN PAST TIME
WHEN WILL I?
KNOWING IT WILL BRING ME PAIN
NOTHING NOW SHROUDS MY DISGUISE
THATâS INSIDE

BURY ALL YOUR DEMONS BEHIND ST. JUDE
IN TIME YOUâLL NEED THESE WOUNDS TO
HEAL YOU, HELP YOU
ILL KEEP ON TAKING PUNCHES
LIKE THESE IN THE TEETH
DEEPER DIGS THE SERPENT
WITHIN MY SKIN
