WHATEVER YOUR HIDING FROM MY EYES
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET YOU BY
AND ALL OF THOSE LIES THAT KEEP YOU CLEAN
ARE WRITTEN BENEATH YOUR PLASTIC WINGS

TURN ON THE LIGHT
THAT KEEPS US BLIND
HOLDING BELIEVERS
UNDER YOUR THUMB

PULLING THE VEIL OVER THEIR EYES
SPEAKING IN FABLES
WITH YOUR ELECTRIC HALO

PREY ON THE GUILTY AND CONFUSED
BURN ALL THE BRIDGES THAT YOUâVE USED
TO CROSS INTO LIVES TO FILL A HOLE
YOUâLL SAY ANYTHING TO BE IN CONTROL

YOU DONâT THINK ITS HARD FOR ME
NO ONE KNOWS YOU BETTER
YOU DONâT THINK IâLL SET YOU FREE
NO ONE KNOWS YOU BETTER
