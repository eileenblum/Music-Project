Been there twice before you tried to shut me out
In this rebuttal the story didnât change
I will pick myself up and spit right in your face
Simple task you fail
Iâm tired of explaining myself

Wait listen to me
Hold this over
Nothing you say
Will over throw me
Your words all mean nothing

Drunken tails that strain the waters in your tides
Burn the serum, as you toil through your lies
Mother watches as you spit right in her face

Finished the sermon, disease on your breath
Baptize the baby in lies
You drank us to ruins now youâre on your own

Soiled and toiled beliefs I despise
Turning my blood into wine
Dissolving your life with a bottle in hand

Burning the serum, your burning the man
