TRICKY CONVERSATION
HEAVY THOUGHTS REVEAL
DARKEST REFLECTION OF WHAT YOUâVE BECOME
VEINS FROM THE HEAVENS BURN SLOW MOVING CLOUDS

EVERYDAY ITS ALL WRONG
FELL APART IN HER EYES
TO SLIDE FROM THE MOUNTAIN OF DISHEVELLED SHAME
TO FALL FROM THE MOUNTAIN THAT YOU HELPED DESTROY

YOUR BUTTERFLY IS ALL ALONE
SHEâS DROWNING IN HER BROKEN HOME
SO YOUNG BUT DONâT CARE
I HOPE IT BLEEDS YOU, CARRY IT TILL THE END

DEVILS KNOW THEIR OWN
LEGENDS OVER TOLD
ITS NOT COLOR OF YOUR SKIN
ITS NOT IN THOSE PLACES THAT YOUâVE BEEN

NO ONE WANTS TO LOVE YOU
NO ONE WANTS TO KNOW YOU CARE
STUTTER STEPPING TOWARDS YOUR GRAVE YEAH

ODE TO LONELY DAYS
ODE TO LONELY GRAVES
