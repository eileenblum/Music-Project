SHED NO TEARS IâLL LIVE FOR YEARS
BUT IT WONT BE SAME
MY CHILDS WONT HEAR MY WORDS
I'M BROKEN WHILE SHE GROWS
ADORNED BY WIRES AND TUBES THAT BREATH

I'M TETHERED TO MY LIFE
NO CLOUDS WERE SEEN, NO PERALY GATES
NOR FLAMES FROM HELL BELLOW

I WONT FALL FROM HEAVEN
I WONT WALK AMONGST THE GODS
I WONT FEEL PAIN
I WONT FEEL ANYONE
LET MY WORDS BE FILTERED
I DONâT NEED TO SEE THE SUN
ILL JUST LIE ALONE
WITH MY EYES SEWN SHUT

POISON DAYS OF DISARRAY
I WONDER WHERE IâVE BEEN
LOCKED AWAY INSIDE MY BRAIN
MY THOUGHTS ARE MERELY STAINS
WITH EYES SEWN SHUT AND A BLISTERED TONGUE
I'M REACHING FOR THE END
STILL NO CLOUDS, NO PEARLY GATES
NOR FLAMES FROM HELL BELOW

SHUT AND BROKEN DOWN, BLISTERED, PICKED APART
TORN FROM EVERYBODY, TORN FROM ALL I LOVE
