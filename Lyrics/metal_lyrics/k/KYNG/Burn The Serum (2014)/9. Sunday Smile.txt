SMOKES RINGS BELLOW OUT
THE DRAGONFLY CANT STAY TOO LONG IN BED
YOUâRE ON TOO TIGHT
TO PICTURES OF YOUR ENEMIES
STANDS ABOVE THIS CLOUD

SUNDAY SMILE, ITâS A SHAME YOU CANT GO ON

FIXED UPON A DREAM
THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MADE ME WHO I A M
I DONâT THINK A TEAR WAS SHED
CAST A SHADOW UPON HIS HEAD
YOU DONâT FEELS ITS WRONG

YOUâRE SEARCHING FOR THE WORDS TO SAY
BUT THEREâS NO REASON FOR MY WORDS TO FEAR YOU

HOLDING YOU DOWN, OUT OF FRAME IN THE CROWD

SUNDAY SMILE, ITâS A SHAME
GRIPPING TIGHT TO ENEMIES
HOLDING YOU DOWN, PUSHING YOU OUT
I DONâT FEAR YOU, I DONâT NEED YOUâ¦
