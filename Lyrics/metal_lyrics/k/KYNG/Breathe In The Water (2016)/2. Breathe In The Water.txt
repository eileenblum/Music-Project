The rebel is getting closer
To our throne
Pack up and dress the martyr
We need to go
Breathe in the water
Careful with the undertone
Capsise the children
Watch them float ashore
I still feel you
Slipping away
My whole world world has
Floated away
Pale face, blue with cruelty
I touch your skin
So soft and filled with beauty
A bitter end
Breathe in the water
Careful with the undertone
Capsise the children
Watch them float ashore
I still feel you
Slipping away
My whole world has
Floated away
Breathe the water
Reel it all in
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
The gig was off
Call my field of pain
Breathe in the water
Careful with the undertone
Baptise the children
Watch them float ashore
Embracing all emotions
Dark from within
Faith driven by confusion
The devil wins
I still feel you
Slipping away
My whole world has
Thrown it away
Breathe the water
Reel it all in
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe it all in
