I feel sick
I feel numb
Poreless treason
I should've seen it all along
Now it's mental
Now you're crazy
Your backwards reason have backed you against the wall
Your pristine warning
You let it glide
You're searching for a place to hide
I feel lost
I feel ill
Internal mutiny
I'm washing my hands of this crime
Well I'm betrayed
I thought I knew you
And this silence
You have in your fucking room
Your pristine warning
You let it glide
You're searching for a place to hide
Pristine Warning
A fool with pride
You're sitting by my side
All day long
All day long
Don't stay long
Your pristine warning
You let it glide
You're searching for a place to hide
A place to hide
