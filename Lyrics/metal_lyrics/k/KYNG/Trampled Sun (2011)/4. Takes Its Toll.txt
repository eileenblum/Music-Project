What are we fighting for?
A war was waged for nothing at all
Now I must sit in your prison
Of mental distractions and mental despairs

Let all the smoke dissipate
Let all your words permeate
So I can turn them away
Cause it takes its toll on me
It takes its toll on me

Now Iâm turning the corner
All my mistakes are pointing their fingers
The things you said to me never kept me afloat
Iâm drawing blood from my heart to keep this thing alive

Let all the smoke dissipate
Let all your words permeate
So I can turn them away
Cause it takes its toll on me
It takes its toll on me

Well I guess you know itâs all coming down
Right before I had to whisper I love you
Well you know I guess it comes with a fault
I'm falling into your schemes

Let all the smoke clear away
Let all your words permeate
So I can turn them away
Cause it takes its toll on me
It takes its toll on me.
