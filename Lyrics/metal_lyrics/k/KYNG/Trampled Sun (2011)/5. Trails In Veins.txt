What are we fighting for?
A war was waged for nothing at all
Now I must sit in your prison
Of mental distractions and mental despairs

Let all the smoke dissipate
Let all your words permeate
So I can turn them away
'Cause it takes its toll on me
It takes its toll on me

Now I'm turning the corner
All my mistakes are pointing their fingers
The things you said to me never kept me afloat
I'm drawing blood from my heart to keep this thing alive

Let all the smoke dissipate
Let all your words permeate
So I can turn them away
'Cause it takes its toll on me
It takes its toll on me

Well I guess you know it's all coming down
Right before I had to whisper I love you
Well you know I guess it comes with a fault
I'm falling into your schemes

Let all the smoke clear away
Let all your words permeate
So I can turn them away
'Cause it takes its toll on me
It takes its toll on me
