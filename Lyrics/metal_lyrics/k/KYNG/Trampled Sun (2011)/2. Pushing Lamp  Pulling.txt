Drift the parts [?] why you [?] away
Shadow reigns, [?] looking for an [?]
Now rise upon this [?] it's coming around

You'll never see me falling down
You'll never see me falling down

Open eyes, close the door and state your case
[?] a name, tell the worlds that you left in a haste
Did you think if you [?] you would never become[?]
You pay [?] as your own [?] it's coming around

You'll never see me falling down
You'll never see me falling down

I'm not the one, save your life
Ignorant to think that I would do that
I put you to shame, I left you undead
The body's holding on
The heads that you [?] the pillars are fell
And all because of me

You'll never see me falling down
You'll never see me falling down
