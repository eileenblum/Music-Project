The wind blows away, and the lions plan [?] and go
We'll trample the sun, give into this [?] we run
Faster you let go the quicker this go
[?] rolling over my [?] I want him dying
[?] try, try not to follow
[?] those fresh [?] you
[?] you become [?] your will

Don't worry about the world, worry of the child is you make
Faster you let go the quicker this go
[?] rolling over my [?] I want him dying
[?] try, try not to follow
[?] those fresh [?] you
[?] you become [?] your will

But we're running the trampled one sun, yeah
Prisoner of the shadow in your head
We fade along the way, like the love you set away

The wind blows away, and the lions plan [?] and go
We'll trample the sun, give into this [?] we run
Faster you let go the quicker this go
[?] rolling over my [?] I want him dying
[?] try, try not to follow
[?] those fresh [?] you
[?] you become [?] your will
