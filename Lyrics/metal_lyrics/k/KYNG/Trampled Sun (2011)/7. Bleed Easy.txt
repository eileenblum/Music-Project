I'm so sick of your disease
Like the animal is chained
Now my brothers been misplaced
All his words have been erased, yeah

Let it bleed easy
Stumbling backwards
You couldn't hold onto
The rest of your lives
Now my bottles in the can
Can't remember what you said
Got that thousand yard stare
Whats behind those eyes are dead

Let it bleed easy
Stumbling backwards
You couldn't hold onto
The rest of your lies

Someone else can watch you die
I won't humor all your lies It ain't me
No vulgar amounts of drinking ever set you free your not living
It ain't me
It ain't me no
It ain't me bleeding easy
It ain't me bleeding easy

It ain't me
It ain't me no
It ain't me bleeding easy
