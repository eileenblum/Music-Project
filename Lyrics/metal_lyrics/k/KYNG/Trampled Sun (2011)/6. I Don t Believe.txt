I donât believe, itâs happened to me
Crawling back into your hopeless world
I donât mind, cause itâs all the same
And now weâre face backwards, with nothing to gain

Is there something made of nothing left for me?
I canât hold the hand of who wonât let me breathe
Call my name through the trees and stain my pride
A world thatâs made of nothing still lies to me

Itâs all the same, to you it will feel good
But Iâm at the end
I donât mind, cause my switch is on
And I'm not the one who's feeling so used

Is there something made of nothing left for me?
I canât hold the hand of whom wonât let me breathe
Call my name through the trees and stain my pride
A world thatâs made from nothing still cries for me

So now you found the reason
So now you found the truth
Cold in bed you start weeping
Wake from dream and find itâs real

Crawling back into your hopeless world
I donât mind, cause my switch is on
I am not the one who's feeling so used

Is there something made of nothing left for me?
I canât hold the hand of who wonât let me breathe
Call my name through the trees and stain my pride
All thatâs made of nothing still cries for me.
