Go and hide leave your pride and your pretty mistake,
Drift apart, drifting near, while your watching the lake,
Shuttering, shut them out,let them fall on their face,
I'll rise above this swollen head, itâs coming around

Youâll never see me falling down,
Youâll never see me falling down,

Open eyes, close the door, and state your case
promenade towards the ones that you left in your haste
Did you think, if you ran, you would never be caught?
You patronize your own decay, itâs coming around

Youâll never see me falling down,
Youâll never see me falling down,

Iâm not the one, save your life,
Ignorant to think that I would do that,
I put you to shame, I left you undead,
the body's holding on
The heads that you brought, the pillars that fell, were all because of me

Youâll never see me falling down,
Youâll never see me falling down.
