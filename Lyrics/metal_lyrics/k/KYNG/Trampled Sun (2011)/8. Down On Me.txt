I donât need nothing that I can depend upon
You can sin with the sinner when now itâs time to pay our dues.
A taste in your mouth, everything so sour now
Tell the sleep, little heathens, so charming weaving with the hands

Down on me again
Itâs down on e again!

So rode to the ? that youâve been the victim here
Pull back from the daemons I see the shadows disappear!
The taste in your mouth, everything is so bitter now!
Tell the sleep, little heathens, so charming weaving with the hands

Down on me again!
Is down on me again!

Lost in ? youâre falling for me
Sleep your daemon; weâre all set out here!
? these scars will never heal,
I canât save you, he wonât stop me from evil in disguise
Lost in ? youâre falling for me
Sleeping daemons weâre all set at here!

I donât need nothing that I can depend upon
You can sin with the sinner when now itâs time to pay our dues.
A taste in your mouth, everything so sour now
Tell the sleep, little heathens, so charming weaving with the hands
