Slowly breathing slowing down I'm crawling in my hole. The river flowing through my soul the river never ends. Pages locked within your mind, that I was meant to see. 

The bridges that we never crossed, the roses are now gone.

Reflections of me tearing at the womb. I watched you bleed then fall apart shortly after. Buried and overshadowed so just leave me. Where I stand.

I don't need it, I don't want it, I don't 
I don't need it, I don't want it, I don't
I don't need it, I don't want it, I don't
I don't need it, I don't want it, I don't

It's broken now and I'm to blame. Her scent was washed away. I can't remember why we laughed. Not laughing anymore. Hold it over, hold it down. Regretful are these days. The fog that smiles in my dreams.

Reflections of me tearing at the womb. I watched you bleed then fall apart shortly after. Buried and overshadowed so just leave me. Where I stand.

I don't need this, I don't want this, I don't 
I don't need this, I don't want this, I don't
I don't need this, I don't want this, I don't
I don't need this, I don't want this, I don't

I can only hear lies told in the name of love. I can see all the lights through the eyes of the moon (the moon)
