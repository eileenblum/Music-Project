Impureness of the holy
Pureness of the unholy

The blame of betrayal and sorrow for regression
Dwells inside the heart of the sickened nation
Harvest the days of genocidal misery
Fathers killing sons for the oath of loyalty
Confess the broken oath you have praised
Spare the promises and lies you have embraced

Saints infected, heaven's infestation
Altars of venereal perversion
The flesh of disgust, enshrouded adoration
Forgive the acts of those from redemption

Blessed be the blade of the murdering priest

Not to blame the godfathers of mortal conspiracy
Annihilate, burn and despise, sons of their own breed
Anything for the glory and triumph of the crooked legacy
Servants die mutilated like pigs in a slaughterhouse

United in servitude,
spread the disease into the multitude
Contagious minds erosion,
serve the scriptures of illusion

Slay yourself for the glorious day
When the bell tolls for the sins you have made

The blame of betrayal and sorrow for regression
Dwells inside the heart of the sickened nation
Harvest the days of genocidal misery
Fathers killing sons for the oath of loyalty
Confess the broken oath you have praised
Spare the promises and lies you have embraced

Impureness of the holy
Pureness of the unholy
Weight of a colossal fraud smash the pillars of god
Slay yourself for the glorious day
When the bell tolls for the sins you have made
