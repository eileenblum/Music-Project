Transcend the pillars of destiny
Everlasting path to eternity
The blackened earth primordial
Inhale the breath of the centuries
Drink the wine distillate in blood
Elixir to immortality
Damned tempo of the notes of blasphemy
The counterpoint of this fearless heresy

Forged with fire, water and wind
Ride the colossal velocity
Timeless search for the secrecies
The elements of an abysmal frenzy
Unbreakable wheels turning viciously fast
The southern storm obliterates at last
Breed of the relentless legionnaire
Disciplined to embrace the warfare

Conquer the fear of thy enemy
Demonic wisdom and fury
When the serpent strikes relentlessly
Spew the poison of an envenomed mortality

Bad blood, infamous glory
Brotherhood's loyalty
Damned tempo of profanation
We play the forbidden songs of your affliction

The number is three, we have been conceived
Unify the formula of this ultra speed
Hear the sound of the roaring of a true beast
Echoing forth through infinity
A tempo of the trio, the counterpoint of strangulation
Hammering down the nails of your crucifixion

Bad blood
Blasphemous
Unify the wrath of demon gods
Hear the drums
Beating so loud
Like thunder ripping through the walls

Transcend the pillars of destiny
Everlasting path to eternity
The blackened earth primordial
Inhale the breath of the centuries
Drink the wine distillate in blood
Elixir to immortality
Damned tempo of the notes of blasphemy
The counterpoint of this fearless heresy

Bad blood
Blasphemous
Unify the wrath of demon gods
Hear the drums
Beating so loud
Like thunder ripping through the walls

Conquer the fear of thy enemy
Demonic wisdom and fury
