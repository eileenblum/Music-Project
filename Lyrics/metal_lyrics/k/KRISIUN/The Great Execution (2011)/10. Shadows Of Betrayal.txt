Shadows of betrayal falling upon your soul
Bastard of fear, the end of you mission is drawing near
Exalting a sickening race of cowards
Worm of submission â Sanctified treachery
Spreading filthy lies of conspiracy

Distil the poison of your filthy tongue
Iâm coming to prove that you are mortally wrong
The sentence of your death in my murdering hands
Iâm the unexpected guest right behind your back
Iâm the serpentâs coiling right around your neck

A serpentâs embrace will seal your fat
Iâm coming to prove that your world is fake
Dishonor entangled, submissions in vain
Salvation denied â Your salvation is pain

Shadows of betrayal â The face of a sickening coward behind the veil
Shadows of betrayal â The stench of your own blood for you inhale

A guillotine of iron arms, strangling, traumatizing
Till you canât see, till you go blind, till you go paralyzed
A serpentâs embrace, will crush your fate
Until black blood spray of you lacerated face

Shadows of betrayal falling upon your soul
Bastard of fear, the end of you mission is drawing near
Exalting a sickening race of cowards
Worm of submission â Sanctified treachery
Spreading filthy lies of conspiracy

Distil the poison of your filthy tongue
Iâm coming to prove that you are mortally wrong
The sentence of your death in my murdering hands
Iâm the unexpected guest right behind your back
Iâm the serpentâs coiling right around your neck
