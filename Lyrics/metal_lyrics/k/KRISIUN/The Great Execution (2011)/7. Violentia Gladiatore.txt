Beneath the skies of oppression â Over the sands of execution
A vile construction is built â to recreate the ecstasy of the killing fields

Gladiatorial brutality engaged â Slaves to be hunted off the cage
Butchery celebrates a holiday â Killing and carnage for entertain

Bastards and whores whipped as devoured spectacles of horror
In a furious feast, slaves and thieves are fed to the beasts

Mourning of doom and cruelty omnipotent tyranny
Blood lusting crowed cheering for the slavesâ agony

Into the vortex of unmerciful mutilations
Initiate the black mass of condemnation
Screams of the tortured, echoing on thru the abattoir

Bodies impaled in iron stakes, spectacles of horror
Crowed arena praising the beasts in a massive roar

Beneath the skies of oppression â Over the sands of execution
A vile construction is built â to recreate the ecstasy of the killing fields

Devourment upon the sands of conceived legal pain
Open the gates of the lionâs den
Lacerated bodies scattered under the rain hunger lions devouring fury unchained
Warlords clash in a maelstrom of swords and shields
Vultures behold, slaughter unfolds, bloody stories to be told

Devourment upon the sands of conceived legal pain
Open the gates of the lionâs den
