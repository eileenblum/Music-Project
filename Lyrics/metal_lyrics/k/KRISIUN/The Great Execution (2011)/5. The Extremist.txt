Source of wrath and fury revealed inside of me
The electrifying surge of a corrosive lunacy
Molten destination, Iâve sold my plagued soul
Impulsive disorder, I bring the fuel to burn

Exalting the words of my hatred faith
Vengeful malediction, Iâm locked in a cage of hate
A perpetual venom that feeds my redemption
My soul entangled into a bloody maelstrom
As I passed the gates to a ruthless mental storm

Iâm the one you call the extremist â Godâs forsaken lunatic â Fear to the nations I inflict
Iâm the one you call the extremist â Blaspheming thy lord I exist â Desecrating thy faith I insist
Iâm the one you call the extremist â Predatory brutal instinct â Rule the lord with iron fist

Demonized burning dementia â Terrorizing pyromania â I burn everything in my way

Iâm the one you call the extremist â Your neighbor church in my black list â Ashes of saints under the funeral mist
Iâm the one you call the extremist â Infesting predatory lunacy â Purge and pillage I inflict

Source of wrath and fury revealed inside of me
The electrifying surge of a corrosive lunacy
Molten destination, Iâve sold my plagued soul
Impulsive disorder, I bring the fuel to burn

Exalting the words of my hatred faith
Vengeful malediction, Iâm locked in a cage of hate
A perpetual venom that feeds my redemption
My soul entangled into a bloody maelstrom
As I passed the gates to a ruthless mental storm

Iâm the one you call the extremist â Godâs forsaken lunatic â Fear to the nations I inflict
Iâm the one you call the extremist â Blaspheming thy lord I exist â Desecrating thy faith I insist

Demonized burning dementia â Terrorizing pyromania
Demonic scorching disease, leads my self to a bliss
