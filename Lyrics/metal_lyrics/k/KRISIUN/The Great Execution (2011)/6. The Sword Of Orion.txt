Timeless untamed wild ancestor, before and beyond eternity
I ride the winds of creation, blowing and howling free
Endless savage doomed infestation, before and beyond all extinction
I ride the winds of cremation, burning souls of the precipice

Iâm the one who holds the key to the secrets of the universe
Iâm the one before existence, the primeval breath of the blackened earth
Fearless unscarred ghost of blackness, flying in and out the abyss
I ride the winds of profanation, carrying forth early blasphemies

Iâve seen the abysmal procreation, shattering the bounds of the land,
Raging waters flooding the globe, the breeding of beasts, the surging of chaos

The sword of Orion stabs the night skies
Pointing the signs of the glory of punishment
Divide and conquer, behold and killâ¦
Behead my opponent with the sharpness of my southern steel

Timeless untamed wild ancestor, before and beyond eternity

Timeless unsacred dreadful soul of ethereal dark violations
Iâve ridden thru forbidden spheres, Iâve passed all the gates of the Necronomicon
Endless savage revolt of the planets, Iâve testified the wrath of Mars
Nations exterminated, early morning genocide

Timeless untamed wild ancestor, before and beyond eternity
I ride the winds of creation, blowing and howling free
