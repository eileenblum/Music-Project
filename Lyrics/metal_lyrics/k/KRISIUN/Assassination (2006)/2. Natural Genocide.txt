Storming process of violation
Open the abyss to wastelands

Nocturnal cycle of degradation
Deluvian nature awakened

Silent ominous waves pound
Vultures prepare their arrival

Killing ground shakes
Crumbling mountains explode like bombs
Raging sea swallows the land
Dragging Earth's fate into the void

Volcanoes enraged
Skies decayed
Molten rocks descend
Smoldering nations in pain

Monstrous tide
Divine genocide
Torrential flood

Natural Genocide
