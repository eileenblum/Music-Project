Oh father, tyrant of all
Crowned in highness, pervert mundane
Oh father of angelic tales
Violate the child you love

Oh father of whipped sons
Punish them in days of redemption

Defiled sworn of the corrupted father
He must kill the unwanted son
Brutal passion of love divine
He must kill the unwanted son

Father's perversion

Oh lord of broken promises
Traumatize them, feed thy lust
Oh lord of whores and betrayers
Give light to a new Sodom
Oh lord of miracles and misery
Prophesy thy heavenly lies
