I stand for refusal, the vilest enemy
As decimate all, till it turns into dust
Dominate, the warfare
I am the one who resists in this endless conflict
Hate me, despise me
For I reveal the horrors you fear
Nameless scum of the earth
You die every time you speak my name

Defiant domain, sworn assassin
Waiting for you at the front line
Adversary of what you breed
I spit in the face of the idol you praise

Enshrined by fierceness unleashed
Haunted by a destructive wish
Ravenous son of the jungle
I came to bring you pain
