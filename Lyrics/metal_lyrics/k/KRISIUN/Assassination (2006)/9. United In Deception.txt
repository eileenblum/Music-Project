In the beginning of centuries
Hatred of the nations collided
And the killing for gods unleashed

In a world abused and raped
Temples of waste were raised
Demented leaders worshipped

Conflicts, demands, tyranny

Within the procedure of existence
Cowardly men surrender and bow
Relying on the lies about purification
Saviours and prophecies all created

Conflicts, demands, new god

Endurance of the earth so fragile
Massacre and wars across the globe
Crosses burnt, yet worshipped
Mankind united in deception

In the beginning of centuries
Hatred of the nations collided
