Wrath of primeval madness
Forged from vicious roots
Timeless existence plagued soul
I vindicate the renegade ones

Full moon serpent spirit
Emerging in days of vindication
Ravager fatherless inexorable
Ill nature aberration of creation

Primitive derangement

Forged from self holocaust
Timeless vicious hatred

By nihilistic fire I was burnt

Specters of primitive summoning
Forged from self damnation
Straight vicious wrath
Straight vicious wrath

My twisted image mirrored in red
Break the reflections into shards
Within the serpent's gaze
I see the coming of a painful dawn
