A hollow altar
Hides on truth
Rotten like carrion
Silent it remains

Nothing is divine when a defiled child cries
Nothing is kind on the mind of the mighty whore
Nothing is heard when a dead fetus is born
Nothing like god to save it all from its sins

Rank scent, early death, vultures stalk
In the house of god
Undead, holy embryo, small skeletons and dust
In the house of god
Holocaust of innocence, lustful delight
In the house of god
