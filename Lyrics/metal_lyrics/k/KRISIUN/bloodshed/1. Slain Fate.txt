Age of decay - embrace the fate of all
Masses killed like cattle - reduced to polluted ashes
Mother nature aborts - nuclear shades fall
Sudden death of millions - it's coming to us all

Slain fate - atomic winds blow
Slain fate - plagued rivers flow

Bow to the new messiah - perverted lord of the future
The savior is the aggressor - the one who killed your idol
Rule this land with scourge - exterminate this scum
Pulling souls to nothing - void of all believers

Centuries of prophecies - worthless scriptures
Deceive the whole creation - pagan sheep are ready to die
Mortal destination - slay the fate of everything
Hammering megatons - pounding waves of radiation

Slain fate - atomic winds blow
Slain fate - plagued rivers flow
Slain fate - sudden death of millions
Slain fate - it's coming to us all
