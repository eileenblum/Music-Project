Visions beyond what I see
Ethereal lunacy descends on me

Lurking beyond my sleep
Behind the murdered light I roam
Deep water on fire
Deafening cries of wounded souls
Embraced unto forbidden confines
Of the dark sacrificial earth
I'm the offspring to be returned
To cast seeds of terror upon earth

Timeless nightmares of an undying soul
Origin of desolation
The eye of the undivine is upon me
Carry my curse to all my enemies
