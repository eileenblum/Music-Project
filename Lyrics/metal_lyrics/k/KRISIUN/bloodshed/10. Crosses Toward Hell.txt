Hear the dark symphony
when the light becomes black
under the blood's rain
Satan always calls your name
uncaread for your God
inherit the evil's control
this order always summoned you
raise the black flag
blood run out of your eyes
plague's fever and death
all disease are spreadin' out
unleashed the demon's wrath
slaves of the dying world
the worms eat away their flesh
blood blasts from the sky
crosses toward hell

Rotten guts inside the body
the mankind cry out in despair
rotten world, atrocious from hell
you get command, godless butcher
you must be alive forever
