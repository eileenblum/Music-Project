Morning star - surging beyond. In ominous skies
Sorrowful light - shining for tragedy of paradise decayed

Season of plagues - winter falls
Turning lives into specters
Blasting blows of toxic storms
Carried along terminal winds

Blackened rays of a decayed sun
Rays of death
Blessing the blind masses

Paradise now in flames
Dissect all nations for them to know
Heaven is a tale of this ungodly land
The savior is a lie - sworn to save what can't be saved
