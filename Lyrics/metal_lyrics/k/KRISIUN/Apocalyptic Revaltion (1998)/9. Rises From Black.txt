Hell's bluster in your mind
A boundless pain possesses you
Eye gouged out
Worms rises from your eyes
Satan rips out your soul
Satan ruler of your soul

Abomination comes against you
Your rottenness on crosses
True suffer of death
Look inside the demon eyes
Black death leads your way
Spreading death thru the empire

Under the black
Ride forever
Immortality, rises from black

Into the evil's domination
Nothing remains in your corpse
You'll be a ghoul
Deep inside the hell's flame
You'll be born from black
