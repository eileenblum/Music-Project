Blackened divinity - venomous ancestor
summoned thru flames and pain
serpent entity - of omens of blood
spew thy scourge upon men
abyssal possessions - choronzonic damnation
chaotic spiritual madness
sentinel beast - father or fallen ones
I'm the one embraced by thee

Mesmerized darkned spirit
my hands only dripping red
as it rains upon signs
where fiends descend and taste its blood
multitude of enslaved souls
drifting painful eternally
bloody seal blasphemous oath
hatred works of inferno begotten

Pestilential spells into redemption I cast
as its blade struggles my flesh
ravenous venomous eternal hate
surrounding scavengers specters redeemed
come onto me - carry my sorcery
descend embrace my pain
endless twilight feeds my madness
darkness bestowed at the strike of my sword
