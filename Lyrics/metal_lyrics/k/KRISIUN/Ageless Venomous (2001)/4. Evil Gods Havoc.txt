Amongst mountains and sacred fields
of the havoc of the evil gods
a ferocious forged empire guards
mystical altars and monopoliths
heralds of primitive evil powers
prayers of chaos and hate
rituals of perpetual darkened servitude
conquering of gods supremacy
ceremonial flesh desecration
spirits of fire unleashed

Descendants of enemies hatred blood
ancestral armies clash
vindication of the tyrant enthroned
impaler of nations conquered
ethereal monarch of victorious chaos
of festivals of blazing purification
enchanting of pure vengeful spells
ageless souls of vengeance rejoiced
upon massacred civilizations
remains the divine earth

[chorus:]

Genocide empowers the tyrant
enduring chaotic strenght
conquering legions of the ancient pillages
march on thru eternity

[repeat chorus]
