Ravenous hordes ride the sorrowful dawn
purge thru pillage inferno unleashed
blasting steel barbarian spawn
riding to avenge out of the hills
storms of spears breaks the dusk
ravens on high - flesh and steel are one

Rivers infested - blood-bathed soil
sanguinary winds - cruelty blown
dacapitated pieces of foes
heads stacked - slaughetered as burnt
daughters of men ravaged as enslaved
promised land crumbled to dust

Bestial covenant of sword na oppressor
vanquished empire falls into ruins
enraged servants or tyrant realm
genocide of all lands
