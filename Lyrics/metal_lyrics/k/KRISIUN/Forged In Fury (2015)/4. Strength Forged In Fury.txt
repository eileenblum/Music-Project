Strength Forged In Fury, unbroken vicious will,  
swords made for battle are made of purest steel,  
the power to persist, mission to be fulfilled,  
the wrath of thousand titans  
in my heart cannot be killed 

Strength of the punishing hand of severance,  
grip of iron fist, shattering skull, steel like wrist,  
smashed upon the anvil, nails onto the cross,  
lay down the hammer of the murdering gods 

The calm winds will turn into storm  
and the breeze will bring an infesting swarm,  
temples of ice will melt when the sun rises,  
out of the ashes the beast of prey flies 

Strength beyond pain, the call of the profane,  
deadly test of the immortals, the one with guts remain,  
strength beyond pain, hard as the iron domain,  
stripes on the tiger can't be removed or disdained,  
strength forged blasphemy, interior of hunger entities,  
I speak the tongue of barbarism, decipher the secrets of the abyss 

Whisper my name, it's always the same,  
your blood will be mine, I laugh as you die 

Kind to no one, my blasphemous faith enthroned,  
not to surrender nor turn down to anyone 

The calm winds will turn into storm  
and the breeze will bring an infesting swarm,  
temples of ice will melt when the sun rises,  
out of the ashes the beast of prey flies 

Strength beyond pain, the call of the profane,  
deadly test of the immortals, the one with guts remain,  
strength beyond pain, hard as the iron domain,  
stripes on the tiger can't be removed or disdained 

Strength beyond pain, the call of the profane,  
deadly test of the immortals, the one with guts remain,  
strength beyond pain, hard as the iron domain,  
stripes on the tiger can't be removed or disdained
