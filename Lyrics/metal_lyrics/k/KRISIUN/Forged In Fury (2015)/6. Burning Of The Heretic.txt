Terrifying mundane shadows of a not so distant past,  
keep failing, darkening and degrading the entire universe at last,  
the aversion of sins and beliefs, blood stained morality  
will hunt and whip the prosecuted into a burning spree,  
hanged at the stake, burning souls are set free 

Forced to avoid knowledge and decline freedom of speech  
or face divine castigation of religious punishment unleashed,  
the temple's tribunal commands the public carnage of execution,  
human holy incineration, honor the gods retribution,  
from ashes to accession of vulgarity,  
from dust to retrogression of humanity, retrogression of humanity 

Antagonize the wise and the free,  
off their lands they must flee,  
burn the book of forbidden science,  
hide the fraud and sanctified lies 

The vile army of divinity, inquisitors of bible's agony,  
terminal witch hunt, The Burning Of The Heretic,  
confessors speaking, the tongue of the lamb,  
cleansing thru shame, purified by the fire of deliverance,  
denounce thesinner, the unholy flesh feed the flames,  
impaling of the mother whore, whipping horrors at the stake 

Bow to the whipping lord,  
don't defy the higher law,  
never say God is dead  
for the gallows will fall 

Like a pest breaking loose across the whole territory,  
the more it grows and expands, the more divine and predatory,  
extracting confessions and secrets thru torture and whiplash,  
the protection of non-servants must be desecrated and bashed,  
burn the pregnant matriarch of the unsacred infant,  
rejoice the congregation of judgment or repent 

Antagonize the wise and the free,  
off their lands they must flee,  
burn the book of forbidden science,  
occult the frauds and sanctified lies 

The vile army of divinity, inquisitors of bible's agony,  
terminal witch hunt, The Burning Of The Heretic,  
confessors speaking, the tongue of the lamb,  
cleansing thru shame, purified by the fire of deliverance,  
denounce the, the unholy flesh feed the flames,  
impaling of the mother whore, whipping horrors at the stake
