Reaping cult of the immortal axe, relentless
Bless the ancient killing upon te earth
Tool of decapitation, razor sharp blade of immolation
Sign of decimating roots of barbaric creation

Neolithic weapons made of bone and stone
In days where fire were discovered and stolen
Neanderthal tribes marched and roamed after flesh
Ancestral scream of bloodlust the leader swings the axe

Savage nations expanded seeking power
Enemies flesh the cannibal hordes devour

Skulls torn off, lacerating shock
Beharded one by one upon the rock
Skulls torn off, lacerating shock
Howls of carnage, the killing pack exterminates the flock

The code of victorious bloodshed / Dominating cruel infliction
Take over with the power of defiance and attrition
The horde of the exe murderer rides upon beharded bodies
Master of the frontline leads the conquering armies

Centuries of anger and discordance / Brutal warfare come along
As weapons of steel were forged by the strong
Fire of inquisition burned / The kingdom of Jehovah's throne
The axe man pierces the denied son

The sands of killing time keep falling
Armies of barbarians keep riding
The arena today brings back all the pain
Decapitations in the desert untamed

Skulls torn off, lacerating shock
Beharded one by one upon the rock
Skulls torn off, lacerating shock
Howls of carnage, the killing pack exterminates the flock

Reaping cult of the immortal axe, relentless
Bless the ancient killing upon te earth
Tool of decapitation, razor sharp blade of immolation
Sign of decimating roots of barbaric creation

Onward battle steeds scream
Wheels of spiked chariots fiercely spin
Games of death for the entertainment of the king
Bodies chopped in half glorify our sins
