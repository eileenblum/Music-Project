The Isolated Truth, hidden behind the walls of colossal lies,  
skeletal secrets behind the misery of the righteous nation 

The abominated truth, temples of prejudice are built,  
modern fields of segregation, testifying to the butchery of separation 

The awful shame, abandoned children are sent to be abused,  
sold as taught to die at war, blown into pieces for the glory of The Lord 

The banned truth, within the procedures of the corrupted reign,  
propagation of conspiracy and betrayal for consecration,  
the pervert truth, abolish the faults of the priest,  
grant their sons the gift of molestation and slaughter 

The speech of misery and lies, inflicting slavery on empty minds,  
learn the sorrowful commandments, order the gather of the lambs,  
kneel before you crawl, fall for every lie preached,  
kneel before you crawl, like a blood sucking leech 

Spineless followers of the ways of conformity,  
mankind's obsession for the evolution of agony 

The awful truth of devotion and negation,  
support the industries of weapons of mass extermination 

The banned truth, blocked to blind the dumb masses,  
slaves of the habit follow the circus of useless scriptures 

The speech of misery and lies, inflicting slavery on empty minds,  
learn the sorrowful commandments, order the gather of the lambs,  
kneel before you crawl, fall for every lie preached,  
kneel before you crawl, like a blood sucking leech
