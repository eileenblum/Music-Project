Into the deep thorny forest of hypocrisy,  
ideals defining the path to our agony,  
we march as we find the desert of our despair,  
the illusion of progress fails to project what we cannot bear,  
psalms leading the damned to inconceivable prayers 

The enlightment and confusion of reason born,  
taken from the tales of a crucified whipped corpse,  
the clash of religion and science, damnation prophesized,  
amen to the Dogma Of Submission and disguise,  
followers and leaders to the abyss of corroded lies 

Words and actions, the toll of the bell,  
slaves and masters in an empty shell 

Leaders and followers, the mad leads the blind,  
like rats in a cage, feed the hunger of the snakes 

The dawn of a new age, the plague of intrusion 
delusion born at  the altar of confusion,  
the enlightment of reason, born with Judas treason,  
the sons of Cain begin the brother killing season 

Words and actions, the toll of the bell,  
slaves and masters in an empty shell 

The ominous circle, the blind serving the dark,  
centuries of progress, we are still living in a cave,  
the dawn of a new age, distributed by the tyrant faith,  
saviors and sinners, bound to a one filthy grave 

Into the deep thorny forest of hypocrisy,  
ideals defining the path to our agony,  
we march as we find the desert of our despair,  
the illusion of progress fails to project what we cannot bear 

The enlightment and confusion of reason born,  
taken from the tales of a crucified whipped corpse,  
the clash of religion and science, damnation prophesized,  
amen to the Dogma Of Submission and disguised
