Awaken by a ceremonial metamorphosis,  
haunting summonings of terrifying howls,  
Soulless I become, amongst the earth and beyond,  
caught with the spell of the Nosferatu phenomenon 

Nightmares of fangs deeply spiked,  
my reflection fades out with the absence of light,  
nailed pierced skin on the walls,  
demon whores will dance when night falls 

Betrayed as sacrificed by the scum of humanity, sinful ways thru eternity,  
I bring the spear for the impalement of my enemies, pierced bloody agony,  
returned from the pit to feed on the bloody lands, blades within the flesh of the damned,  
tribal curse of resurrection, thru eternity I stand 

The dawn of time of sanguinary tides,  
I hear the wolfen cries and bloodthirsty carnivores,  
the full moon enshrined, call of the non-divine  
like an ever flowing undead stream immortalized 

Tidal constellations, incite monsters and beasts,  
the nature of the hunger, behead the priest,  
harvester of depression, hunter of souls,  
I testify the death of the sun 

This blood I've tasted becomes my wine,  
you can't kill what does not die,  
burning eyes will hypnotize  
like a cobra spewing right thru your eyes 

This blood I've tasted becomes my wine,  
you can't kill what does not die,  
burning eyes will hypnotize  
like a cobra spewing right thru your eyes 

Guardian of the immortal dawn,  
roaming across the gates  
of the abandoned graveyard 
Guardian of the immortal dawn,  
tribal curse of reincarnation,  
everlasting damned calls 
Guardian of the immortal dawn 

Awaken by a ceremonial metamorphosis, dragged by tides of blood,  
haunting summonings of terrifying howls under a crimson moon,  
Soulless I become, amongst the earth and beyond, harvesting cries of delusion,  
caught with the spell of the Nosferatu phenomenon
