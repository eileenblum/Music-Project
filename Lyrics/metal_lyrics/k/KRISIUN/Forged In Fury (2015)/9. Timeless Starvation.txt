Doomed to despair and sorrow of timeless starvation,  
an abandoned territory of gruesome monstrosities,  
severe ways of selection and elimination,  
lined up like cattle prepare for decapitation 

The new order for independence and freedom,  
broken deals of a corrupted stormy kingdom,  
the wretched becomes the mercenary of hate,  
the misery of the world continues to procreate 

Colossal horrors of the modern day,  
hunting crimes of millions disdained 

Brutal commandments of the savage empire,  
banish the unwanted race thru pillage and fire 

Bound to kill for blood spilled,  
mass murder is the new gods' will 
Bound to kill for blood spilled,  
mass murder is the new gods' will 

Hordes of separation armed to the core,  
like an army of mortification with weapons of war 

The sirens sound like trumpets of death,  
announcing shell shock of another attack 

Houses are burnt, villages decimated,  
where daughters of men must be abused and raped 

Mercenary hands command the battle gear,  
genocide is real at nations of pain and fear,  
pale assassination, territories obliterated,  
cowardly crimes of millions disdained 

Embrace the ways of corrupted leadership,  
mothers will weep and their sons will bleed,  
the promises for the children of a broken tomorrow,  
turn into the cursed lie of mother of all sorrows 

Bound to kill for blood spilled,  
mass murder is the new gods' will 
Bound to kill for blood spilled,  
mass murder is the new gods' will
