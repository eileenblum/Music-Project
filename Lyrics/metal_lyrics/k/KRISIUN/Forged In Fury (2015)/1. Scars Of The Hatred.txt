The dat of dawn of confrontation will fall
A ton of sothern steel will smash the empire down
Get ready for attrition, the enemy is coming to town

Black hearted hatred faith domination
Fuel for a full throttle ride a man's destination

Branding iron, scars of lessons in violence,
Honor the immortal gift of substance

The road to inferno / The serpent eternal
Injected venom flows into me
Taught not to retreat / At the womb of death I resist
Inner possession set my demons free

Inciting furious drive for the heat of conflict
Taste the power of a pounding reckless speed
Devastating rites as lightning strikes
Killing rain will fall off the darkned skies

Discipline of survival overcoming conspiracies
Determined to move further not backwards
Raised on the ground of drained blood sands
Where gladiators died with broken sword in the hands

Murder to survive / Dethorne to stay alive
Marked beast of the legion / Impure as demonized

Black hearted under the speel of an evocation
I'm the light that leads to confrotation
Fear of nothing natural born opposition
No medals in my chest

Only scars of my ravenous past
The honor of men corrupted broken and lost
The pride long gone, everyone is a sell out
Not to turn my back and lay down my sword
But to stand and fight and die with honor

Murder to survive / Dethorne to stay alive
Marked beast of the legion / Impure as demonized
