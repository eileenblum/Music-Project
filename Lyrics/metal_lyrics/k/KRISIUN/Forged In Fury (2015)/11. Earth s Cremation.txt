Decaying promises of deliverance,
feel the sickening cities stench,
shock waves of contaminated,
catastrophic orgy of urban decadence

Another powerhouse of suffocation is raised and praised,
behold the rush of death of the planet earth no longer saved

Poisoned smoke running out of million industries,
deprive all the air, chop and burn million trees,
universal will for penitence,
embraced by the plague of repugnance

Hear the call of the underworld suffocated,
jungles of iron and concrete obliterated,
the poles of either north and south will no longer freeze,
static pale death caused by human's terminal disease,
feel the heat of the scorching sun's atrocities,
spread the epidemic of infected corpses

Rivers of infected waters
dragging sepulchral bodies,
breed deformed beings at the shore of deformities

Rivers of dead waters
infested with dead remains,
breed saturated mud of mother nature profaned

Contaminated trash are sent off shore,
out in the space and into earth's core,
the sea regurgitates, deformed creatures and waste,
the skies are dried out in a universal blackout
