From the darkness I arise and
order you to hear me
follow my command and
find your destiny
your agony is my uncare,
your sorrow my peace
make me your master and
purify your soul
I'll make you die a thousand
times so you suffer
without a break
let the fear take care of your being

My triumph is your pain
feel the power that rules your mind
I'm the Lord of your nightmares
there ain't gonna be no break
die like a cursed, ripped dog
there's no reason to hate me
I'm a flame that burns inside your head

I'm inside you
I'm the true meaning of your horror
beg for your death, show me your misery
your being will be devastated
your sacrifice will be endless
sanctified you die and burn at
the deepness
