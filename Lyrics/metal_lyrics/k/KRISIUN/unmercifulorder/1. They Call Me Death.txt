Your judgment is near
you got nowhere to go
I'll take you with pain
playing with your suffering
to renew your sorrow
the sores heap in your corpse
deterioration in the effect
the real cause of your torment
condemns you until nothing remains

The manifest of your sentence
emanates from your grave
feel the evil undying
behold your mortification
I can feel your cry
a cheap life, a dead man
searching for a place in deepness
like a soul chuchi's been condemns

They call me death
death - in wind or rain
death - at night and day
death - feeling pain
death - die with me

I'm your master now
we're the darkness
I'm the magic that follow you
in your body and your soul I'll be
