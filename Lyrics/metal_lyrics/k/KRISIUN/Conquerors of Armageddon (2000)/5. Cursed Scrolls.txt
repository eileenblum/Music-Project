Doomed imprecations of fallacy
abominations on the blackest void
angels flesh dissection
holy carrion begotten
unexpected blessings of pain
tortured nation repent
burnt monuments and idols
at the altars of the fallen cross
sacred signs of deceit bleed
behold the rebirth of the evil one

cast fallen
desecration of the sorrowful god
sworn to decayed deceit
hear the lament of the weak
spawned painful disease
retribution of all curses return
mother's sisters blasphemous lust
murder the unwanted embryo
bearing the cross of molestation
enchanting sodomy

acession of darkest domain
dethroning god of fallacy
tortured slaves crawl
beneath their impaled idols
ablazing flames of thousand suns
brands and destroys the heaven's empire
