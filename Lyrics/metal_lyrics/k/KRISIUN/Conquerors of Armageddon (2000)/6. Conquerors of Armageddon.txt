Insulting blasphemous eminent gods
hatred elders of almighty curse
ascending spells casting storms of plague
as abyssic cracks of hecatomb breaks forth
devourment of the Nazarence's breed
swallowed upon the chasm of eternal black
from below to beyond the stars
persecution of fallen souls
draining armies of corpses
for the kingdom of death's alignment
mighty infernal legions attack
impaled Christ falls from the skies

Overlords of hatred consecration
exalt the spirits of tyrant command
cast the emplagued scourge
thru seas of reaped flesh and gore
infamous force of blackness unleash
upon the gate of no return
the flesh of all men devoured
all blood of creation spills
dying for the mighty sword
souls of holiness entangled
drowned on the stream of all pain Jehovah god desecrated

heaven's empire of deceit destroyed
cleansing in ablazing firestorm
envenoment and molestation down below
swallowed into the seas of black blood and gore
infestation of scourge and damnation
spirits of abomination ride
enthroned empowered in flames
wicked merciless gods celebrate

conquerors of Armageddon
impaling spike on the damned cross
kill, kill, kill lord Jesus Christ

infamous force of blackness unleash
upon the gate of no return
the flesh of all men devoured
all blood of creation spills
dying for the mighty sword
souls of holiness entangled
drowned on the stream of all pain Jehovah god desecrated
