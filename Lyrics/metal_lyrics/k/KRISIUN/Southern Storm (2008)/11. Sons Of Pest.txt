Vile scent of corrosive pest
Through a pestilent, toxic, corrosive march
Contagious, mortal, procession survival through trails of waste

Open, verminous scars on rotten flesh surface
Saturated, infested wounds, blind worms devouring
Undead bodies, emplagued, zombie mothers give birth
As the zombie march procedes, sons of pest regenerate

Mongers of corrosive order let the deformed procreate
Infection flows with dust through pestilent, toxic blows...
Let the deformed procreate

Breed of infested sons, natural born infected, breath of cancer flows
Decayed bodies fall, other ones resist, walk of the diseased

[Repeat 1st Verse]

Open, verminous scars on rotten flesh surface

Saturated, infested wounds, blind worms devouring

Undead bodies, emplagued, as the zombie march proceeds
