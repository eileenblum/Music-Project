Natural born son of fury and hate - violently disciplined
To serve and praise the plague of earth
And spread the cancer of horror and fear

Mentally enslaved to a bloody order
Of ancient, bloody scriptures
Redeemed as blind by pure hostility
Of terrifying commandments

Rider of storming sands, origin of the bomb
Shadow of the explosion, to die is to be born

Inherited, immortal hate, murder the impostor god
Vicious hand of terror, set this house on fire

Rider of storming sands, through ruins and debris
Where salvation does not exist, must kill and resist

Inherited, blasphemous faith burns temples and crosses
Vicious will of terror make all saviors burn

Natural born son of fury and hate - violently disciplined
To serve and praise the plague of earth
And spread the cancer of horror and fear
Mentally enslaved to a bloody order
Of ancient, bloody scriptures
