I pound the gods hammer to crush the infidel
I am the vindicator who cracks the whip onto your back

I bring thorns and nails for your crown and for your cross
I bear the forged sword to be thrust into your heart

The scum you whispered to curse my name
Shall be told again upon your desecrated grave
Your faith: I'll exterminate your fake existence your idols decapitated

As you can only stand still, I bring a slaying ton of steel
For cowards who must be killed, I bring a slaying ton of steel
