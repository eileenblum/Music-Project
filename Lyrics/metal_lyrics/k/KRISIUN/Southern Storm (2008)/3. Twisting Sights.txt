Fallen into hallucinations of a spiritual journey
Drunk with the envenomed elixir of deep roots

Twisting sights in front of me, hollow signs terrifying me

Nocturnal light shines, unearthly eyes are watching me
My heart is frost, I walk through walls
As I fall through cracks in the ground

Now I am sinking into abysmal waters
I try to breathe but I am getting drowned

Snakes coiling around my feet, I hear the silence of the abyss

Frozen moon, burning sun
Into cosmic cataclysms my vicious soul flies

Now I am sinking lower, as I feel, my spirit burns

The dogface god I've seen devouring suicidal ghouls
Condemned, as punished at the lake of fire

Twisting sights in front of me, hollow signs terrifying me
Fallen into hallucinations of a spiritual journey
