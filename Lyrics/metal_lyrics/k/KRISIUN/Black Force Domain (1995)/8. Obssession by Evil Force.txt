Obssession by evil force
when the pagan souls return
the evil flame possesses my soul
blood flowing like acid inside me
Satan monarch of the whole impure
sends me strenght to fight

The sacred steel in my hand
makes all my enemies blees
condemtation of an inferior world
believers of salvation loose their hopes
blood for Satan
blood for Lucifer's messenger

Mankind fearing their God's monarch
hidden in their rotten casked
but their torment is comming
to take their lifes
I want to be burning in hell
I want the downfall of this world
the church's bastards shall die
with every kind of suffering
they've sown the seeds of holocaust

Immortal obssession by evil force
with vengeance in my mind
granted to know the black revelation
I'll ride forever
condemned to live in the shadows
bringing death in my hands
prophecy of the lost alliance
immortal obssession by the evil force
I'll ride forever
