Awaiting the downfall of this kingdom
final inquisition arise
drowing the dead on blessed water
dissecated priest over the altar
blood in his eyes worms in his vine
monuments of prophanation
sanctified slavery of emptyness

Christians lies casting the plague
falling out of the grave
the same rotten flesh
of another humam sinner
promises forgotten
only blasphemy brings truth
into the fire of an infamous force
sick believers creepin' to be destroyed

Begging for unreal
cowards crying before a cross
infamous return from their sins
religious war contradiction and death
the sorrow of an unknown destiny are comming
to leave all saints behind

Mass suicide
throught the emptiness of religious war
souls of damnation - souls of impure
this race shall creep and cry
burn and die

Awaiting the downfall of this kingdom
final inquisition arise
drowing the dead on blessed water
dissecated priest over the altar
blood in his eyes worms in his vine
monuments of prophanation
sanctified slavery of emptyness
