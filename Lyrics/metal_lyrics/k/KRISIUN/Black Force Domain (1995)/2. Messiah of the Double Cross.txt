Enraged by a drawnin' apocalypse
transgressed to a life of shadows
I search for your downfall
nations guided to a damned fate
follower of the rotten cross
twisted by preachers of the inferior world
faith for nothing just life for shit

Hell's Lord awaits me
sanctified by vengeance
in no idols shall I believe
my victory stands over the power
like the immortal fire in hell
deadly as the serpent's strike

Messiah of the double cross
you will be drawn
in an empty dismal hall
pagan souls will hunt you
'till eternity you shall beg
for a lost of salvation

I followed the black spell
among the living and dead
throughtout the centuries
I never forsaked the faith
granted with immortality
on the victorious fate I ride
