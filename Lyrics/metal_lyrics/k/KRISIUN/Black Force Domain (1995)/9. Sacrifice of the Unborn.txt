Eternal blackest night
spreadin' the seeds of doom
the downfall of heaven
drowning into the abyss
infestation of damnation
among the fear of decay
storms of degradation
blasting the world of God

Hymn of the damned
echoing throughtout the devastation
embebed on sick blood
ripped miserable beings
praying to nothing awaiting in vain
deadly plague inside mankind
the holocaust has been concieved
victims of God's will
witness of their own death

Unconscious slaughtered and lost
final march of a last race guided by instinct
searching for the light that never comes
no rest for the cursed ones
absolute horror of forgotten
sacrifice of the unborn

Eternal blackest night
spreadin' the seeds of doom
the downfall of heaven
drowning into the abyss
infestation of damnation
among the fear of decay
storms of degradation
blasting the world of God
