Black palgue reborn
leaving salvation on putrefication
piles of human flesh
mortification of all beings
abhorrent smell insuficient air
dilacerated coprses side by side
the land turns into an immense grave

Symbol of dishonour
slaughtered race by self spawn
whipped deficient souls
crawling to perish below
land of deadly fast past
mankind left to rot

Beyond endurance of pain
sickness and fatality
eternal destiny of doom
invoked to spread the Holocaust
life rejected buried memories
forgotten realms

Human kingdom get intercepted
assolated by master's cruelty
burial of nature
purgatory is here now
fire of thousand suns
burning the existence
pounding the universe
