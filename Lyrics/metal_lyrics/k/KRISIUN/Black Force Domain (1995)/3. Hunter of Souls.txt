I came overtaking the boundaries of insanity
killing and destroying all I can
felling no love at all
just leaving to spread tha black vengeance
enjoying every kind of sorrow
I live without regret
no passion - no mercy

I'll fight 'till the end not afraid to die
I'm the light of the antichrist
my steel will purify the human race
hidden in the shadows of dead
I'n your untrue salvation

Hunter of souls
son of the gods of hell
raised by the storms
I ride the immortal evil
dogs of inferno run by my side
symbols of the impure prophecy

Satan is sowning the seeds of destruction
the mankind shall take all they deserve
no chances to return
black clouds send us the rain of blood
human flesh dropped from the walls
now they'll drink from the chalice of vindication

On the way of eternity
you'll see the light fading out
screams of torment possessses you in fear
living in your worst nightmare
you belongs the deepest suffering
give me your hand
behold the master of whole evil
now we'll take your soul
