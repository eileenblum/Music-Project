Before the plague of fallacy
rise the strongest domain
from shadows of forgotness
from pain of desilusion
fearless we march in attack

Evil supreme leads our fate
rage grows inside us
hell is our distant quest
none will rest in peace
crosses shall be broken down
the mortal bastard man so called Lord
leads this world to the end

Black storms shows up the end
leading the demons to strike
we are knights of fire
fighting against the fallacy of this dead land
the fire sought our glory
we are the real force

Storms fire and pain
now they cry before us
spreading screams of death throughtout the void
centuries of decay in hands of the so called God
victory of death
the glory from black
black force domain
