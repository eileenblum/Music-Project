[bonus track]

Your judgement is near
You got nowhere to go
I will take you with pain
To renew your sorrow
The sores heap in your corpse
Deterioration is the effect
The real cause of you torment
Condemns you until nothing remains

Manifest of your essence
Emanates from your graves
Feel the vil undying
Behold your mortification
I can feel your cry
Cheap life - dead man
Searching for a place in deepness
Like a soul that was condemned

They call me death

Death - in wind of rain
Death - at night and day
Death - feeling pain
Death - die with me

I your master now
We're the darkness
I'm the magic that follows you
In your mind and your soul I will be


Thanks to nincius for sending track #11 lyrics.
