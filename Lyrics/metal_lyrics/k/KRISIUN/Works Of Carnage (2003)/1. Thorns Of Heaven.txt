Drink the venom of crucifixion
Exalt the reign of fallacy
Chapter of doomsday covenant - shall be glorified
Evslaved crucified lord - of voodoo karmanic blood
Split upon the abyssal flock

Doomed deliverance for the prmised rebirth
Broken oath of pureness for all messiah's humiliation
Betrayed for the putrification of the sacredness corrupted
Deceived for the great father's assessment

Granted with the crown of thorns
Celebrate the blest child punishment
Erected as nailed to bleed till dry
As the blind flock awaits for the miracle

Eternity so short
To sacrifice the glory of the father
Sacrificed to free the whore of god
Promised to reach the heavens
Thrown into the darkened pit

Granted with the crown of thorns
Celebrate the blest child punishment
Erected as nailed to bleed till dry
As the blind flock awaits for the miracle
