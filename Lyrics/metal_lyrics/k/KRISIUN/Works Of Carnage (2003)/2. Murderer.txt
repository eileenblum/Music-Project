Annihilating thoughts of a tormenting redemption
Pervading the bounds of my deranged mind
Unearthly voices of fallen angels
Screaming silently the blasphemous

Terrifying riddle of merciless rites
As the will of vengeance embraces me

Bloody memories surge of genocide of creation
Like nails within my flesh

Altered subconscious violently doomed
Amongst the walls of this murdering will
Echoes from a distant ravenous past
Now conceive in me the purest hate

Ancestors of mass desolation and killings
Cast its venom thru the depths of my soul
Dawning torment upon the path of extermination
Makes me kill and kill again
Everlasting visions of perishing prey
Murdering command exalted on me
Never ending destructive desire
Ill natured vengeful heart

Dawning possession upon the path of extermination
Makes me kill and kill again
