Gateways to an abysmal abhorrent transcendents
Of blazing spirits empyreal inferno
Infinite shadows of havoc impending black perpetuation
Consume the dust of my flesh as the debris of my hatred grave

Inherit storming soul of ancient nightmares
Thru the dawn of the bleeding alignment I'm free
Shining light of the principle of chaos dominion
Lead my unluminous soul of this darkened return

Fatherless unblessed - baneful beast
Sentinel of the fallen earth's domination
Summoned again thru rituals of tragedy
As became the blood which pours upon fire

Blackened sights of everlasting apocalyptic visions
Desolate souls cry - for holocaustic revelations
Perishing eternity dominates the obliterated earth
Ashes of god's creation exalt of worms inheritance
