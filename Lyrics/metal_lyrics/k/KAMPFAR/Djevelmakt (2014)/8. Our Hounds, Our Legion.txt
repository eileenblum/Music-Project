A moonlight force
A moonlight slavery
A whip from the underworld
By the shadow gods
A moonlight force
A moonlight slavery
A whip from the underworld
A nightcrawling new order

Slaves by the saviour of pain
From the shadows of medieval flames
A dominant force will prevail
Insanity strikes from the strings of tails
A legion of nightcrawlers
A legion of pain
Servants are crawling
A single discipinary spell

A snatch
Mice and men in line
A tail
Hounds in a pack
A sting
Dominant commands for the scapegoats
A snatch
A discipinary tail

Whip up the legions
A snatch from the saviours of pain
Evolution of rebellions
Nightcrawlers in the shadows of tails

Whip up the legions
Moonlight slavery by the shaodw god
A new world is rising
An institition of dominant tails

A moonlight force
A moonlight slavery
A whip from the underworld
By the shadow gods
A moonlight force
A moonlight slavery
A whip from the underworld
A nightcrawling new order

Children hear!
The powerful new world
My children
Commands are ignored
A whip!
Enslaved servants crawling
A legion of nightcrawlers, breathing dirt
Hound, hounds in pack

My children

You servants of scapegoats
Obey the spell of salvation
Nightcrawlers of rebellion, hear!
Salavation will be yours
The new world will be yours
The new order of pain stimulus!
