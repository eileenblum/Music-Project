Skin and silver flutes
Kings and children crawling
Flames and banners rise beneath the silvermoon
Kings! The children dance
Feast on blood and disease

Rats!
Rats spreading
Rats!
King spreads children to the flutes ov death
Rats!
Crawling diseases
Rats!
Plague spreading, rats feeding
Rats!
The stench, blood tearing
Rats!
Crawling children, devils feeding
Rats!
Rats spreading
Rats!
The feast of kings spread the stench

Under solomÃ¥nen skimmer
En ny Åra reiser seg
Dansende mylder
Belvetesporten Ã¥pner seg

Skin rupture
In triumph ov the silver moon
Black banners
Flames and blood stench in the light of the moon

Rats!
Rats spreading
Rats!
King spreads children to the flutes ov death
Rats!
Crawling diseases
Rats!
Plague spreading, rats feeding
Rats!
The stench, blood tearing
Rats!
Crawling children, devils feeding
Rats!
Rats spreading
Rats!
The feast of kings spread the stench

While the silvermoon rises you can hear they crawl from the depths of hell onwards to victory
The black banners rise in glory
Children dance
While the feast wipes out the whores of the earth
Shades and banners
Waving in devilish triumph
Beneath the silvermoon
Children tear blood next to the king of the flute
Black banners of the underworld
Waves in glory
Waves in hate
Onwards to victory
The kingdom rises in glory and hate
