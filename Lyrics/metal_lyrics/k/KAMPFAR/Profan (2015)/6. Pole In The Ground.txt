Creation of light
Choked by a pole in the ground
Captures of light
Become inserted

In the lowest darkest pit
I feel them crawl
Through my darkest hate and spit
I see them fall

Night moon on the hunt to dominate
Shades moving faster than fire
Since the dawn of shadow men
Faster than fire
Faster than light
An outcast obsessed by shadows
Crippled, weeping, gnashing of teeth

Night terror
The sun has been blocked
Crippled by darkness
Burning despair
From the shadow keeper

Night terror
