Speak of great things and gather
Despite wind
Despite light
Despite fear
Sun of light
Sun of birth
Beneath the light we are icons of filth
Icons of filth
We are icons of filth

Speak of great things and gather
Tasting dust
Eating dirt
Crushing fear
Moon of light
Moon of birth
Beneath the light we are icons of filth
Icons filth
We are icons of filth

The black side
While they scream in despair
Lose hope and resign
Be despondent
Be demoralized

Vandalized ashes
Destruction of saints
Look on the black side
In your emotional state of despair
With harsh words they send you
To the depths of despair
With filth they surround you
Gathered and vandalized

Look on the black side
Lose hope and cry
With filth we all gather
Crippled beneath the icons of filth
