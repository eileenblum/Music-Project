In the shades of fire
Fire
The horns are burning behind the highest fire
Fire
The rise of the shadow titan

Thrown
Into the lake of fire
Gathered
In the glory they ride
Behind the burning shades
It shall rise

I claim fire
Behind the shade of shadows
There in fire
At the gates, beyond
Beyond the fires of the highest horns
There in fire
Behind the shades of shadows

Fire
For false messiahs and false prophets
Fire
Son of hate
Son of glory
Fire
Tormented day and night
Fire
Forever and ever

I claim fire
Behind the shades of shadows
Where's my king
Where's my glory
Glory be
Superior son of hate
I reach for glory
Glory be
There in fire
Behind the shades of shadows
