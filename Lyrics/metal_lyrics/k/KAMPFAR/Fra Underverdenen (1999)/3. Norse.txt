my pagan ancestors call my name
through the white waterfalls of norway
from the dark and misty forests
from the mighty snowfilled mountains
through the winds of the northern sea

it's been more than a thousand years
but still i am proud
still i am, norse
still the father of the north
embrace my soul

through the white waterfalls of norway
from the dark and misty forests
from the mighty snowfilled mountains
through the winds of the northern sea

let the fields and homes
turn into fire and blood
let the lambs be wolves
once again

i feel a pagan breeze
from the storms of the northern sea
let the northland of supreme
be the north of my dreams
once again

through the white waterfalls of norway
from the dark and misty forests
from the mighty snowfilled mountains
through the winds of the northern sea
