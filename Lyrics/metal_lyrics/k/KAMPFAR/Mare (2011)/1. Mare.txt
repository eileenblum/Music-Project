In the shadows it's crawlingTowards the pale lightIn the moonlightIt twists and turns When the darkness is freezingFrom the blood of the moonAnd the howling is bleeding your name From the cold winds of the moonIt's spreading like ratsIn the cold lightIt turns into red In the shadows its crawlingTowards the pale lightIn the moonlightIt twists and turns It's cold It's riding, its ridingThe devil in redIt's crawling, its crawlingA devilish triumph under moonIt's riding, its ridingThe darkness prevailsIt's freezing, its freezingIn the blood of the moon  [Vocals by Dolk and Ask]
