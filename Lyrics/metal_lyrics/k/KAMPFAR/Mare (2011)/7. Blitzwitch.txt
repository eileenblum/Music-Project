Ride with the devilLight the torches StormhexBloodhex, Burst into flames StormhexBlood hex, Cold blitzing rage Storm hexBlood hex, Over darknorthern blue Storm hexBlood hex, Between fire andwood Like a fistful of bloodFeels like winter and moonFeel the blitzwitchFeel the blitzwitchLike a force underneathOver steep wind washed cliffsFeel the blitzwitchFeel the blitzwitchOver dark northern blueBetween fire and woodFeel the blitzwitchFeel the blitzwitchFeel the blitzwitchFeel it burst into flamesFeel the blitzwitchFeel the blitzwitch "Light the torches hunt her down, let thedevil whore burnLet the devil whore burn, hunt her down" Like a fistful of bloodLike a winter of hateBetween fire and woodBetween fire and hate
