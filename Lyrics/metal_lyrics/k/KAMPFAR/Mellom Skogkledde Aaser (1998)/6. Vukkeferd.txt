Aust for elivaager
Ved himmelens ende
Dryg ble den hornfagre bukkeferd
Til nihundre hoders hall
Den isdryppende nettefrost seg paa
FÃ¸rhoder trillet
Oksehorneces hugreistetun
Falt tungt i den kolsvarte skog
Bukkefyrstens agn var klar
Bergtroll brulte, det braket i fjell
Eldgammel jord sank ned
Fra et skar mellom skogledde aeser
Ble all aesakraft samlet
For tiden var snau, furaustfra de kom
Alle de trollende hoder
Mannheims berger ormens bane
Agnet kroken med oksehodet
Mot agnet gapte guders fiende
Bandet som ringer jorda

[English translation:]

Billy Goat's Journey29

East of Elivaager30
By the sky's end
Long is growing the horn-fair billy goats journey31
To the hall of the one with nine hundred heads
The ice-dripping night frost descended
Before the heads rolled down
The highest place of ox-horns
Fell heavily in the coal-black wood
The billy goats prince's32 bait was ready
The mountain-troll screamed, the mountain roared
Ancient earth sunk down
In a cleft amid forest-clad hills
All his aesir power33 he gathered up
For the time was few, before they would come from east
All the bewitching heads
The defender of men the killer of the serpent34
Hooked the bait with the ox-head
Against the bait gaped the enemy of the gods35
The band that encircles the earth
