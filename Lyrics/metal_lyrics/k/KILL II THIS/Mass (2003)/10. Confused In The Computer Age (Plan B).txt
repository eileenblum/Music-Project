Dark satanic mills I see
The hills of life's Calvary
Jerusalem's not here
Here's my plan B

Still finding your way in the maze
Killing yourself for a wage
Enslaved bloodstained factory knees crawl
All heads must bow before the blade falls

Still stuck on the same page
Confused in the computer age
Our lives lost and empty
Born into a dead century
Plan B

Educate controlled neurosis
Turns free will self-corrosive
Consumption serving the system
Open your mouth now angle that gun
