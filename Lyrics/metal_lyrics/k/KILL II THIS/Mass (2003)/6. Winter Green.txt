A grieving voice seductive words
To your hallowed home my tears would burn
Raise you up my light of life
And open wide, baptise my sight

Open wide to see your face one last time

Deepest internal organs weep
Drugged eternal raped in sleep
Half my soul now boxed away
A pine surround a silent wave

Open wide to see your face one last time

Consumed, exhumed by love
