Visions of that day, playing frame by frame
Right before my eyes, here's how two worlds collide

The missing link in a chained event
The signs I missed and now I'm finished
Emotions mass mudslide
Shattered all hope has died

Before my eyes two worlds collide

Something went tragically wrong
Oh my God, I cannot feel
Something went tragically wrong
A million to one

A split moment a fraction of time
One in a million that fate conspired
Right there before my eyes
Here's how two worlds collide
