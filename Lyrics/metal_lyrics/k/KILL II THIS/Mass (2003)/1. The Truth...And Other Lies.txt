Cross hairs lie, shooting blind
Catastrophe, it's a blast for me

Temple wall, house of straw
Terminal disease, here's my release

Soundtrack for the blind
Behind all I despise
Soundtrack for the blind
The truth and other lies

Eyes that preach self-deceit
Desensitised, limbs frozen shine

Silent view, salted wound
Decline and fall, freedom once tall

Soundtrack for the blind
Behind all I despise
Soundtrack for the blind
The truth and other lies
