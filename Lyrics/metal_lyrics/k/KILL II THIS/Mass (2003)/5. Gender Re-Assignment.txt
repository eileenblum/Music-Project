Unfolding, revealing brand-new
Defined, arise, the butterfly dies
Something outside me just has to come in
Can purity and innocence ever truly be a sin?

A need to be, a need to be
An Amputee
Confusion of gender estranged
Craving a graven swan, a funeral in song
All that I strive for, my own personal war
A festering identity, cut me, let me breathe

Cut me, let me breathe
