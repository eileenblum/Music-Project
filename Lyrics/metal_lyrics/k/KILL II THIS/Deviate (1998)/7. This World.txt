I see the third world, its starving face,
while the spacecraft probe deep outer space
I see nations shake hands, with dignity's composure,
but they're really saying, we're going to fuck you over

I see the purest, social holocaust,
each colour each creed, is hopelessly lost,
one more war torn tear, newborn deformed,
So I say fuck this world, our Mother Nature is a whore

And I Think to myself -
This World's So Fucked Up - This World's So Fucked Up

One more sick maniac, an overdose on smack,
Pre-programmed for suicide, more mass homicide,
we pledge allegiance to hate, The flag of depravity,
each man answers the call, of greed and corruption for all

And I Think To Myself -
This World's So Fucked Up - This World's So Fucked Up

What I say, how I feel, is surreal
This World's So Fucked Up - This World's So Fucked Up
