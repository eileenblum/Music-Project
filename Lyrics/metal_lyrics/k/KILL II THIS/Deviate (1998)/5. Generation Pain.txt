Anineties disease, a crisis of meaning,
absent belief, no rhyme nor any reason
Can't face the facts, a hostile new age,
I hate these words, I cannot turn the page

This is, this is, this is - This is Generation Pain

Concrete dreams, look at the view,
worshipping liberty, in a human zoo
Dazed and confused, generation X,
what good is freedom if I've no self-respect

This is, this is, this is,
this is Generation Pain - Generation Pain

Injected veins with pure cyanide,
a nineties narcotic, a vile worldwide decline

Nineties disease - Absent Belief -
World I Detest - With No Self Respect
