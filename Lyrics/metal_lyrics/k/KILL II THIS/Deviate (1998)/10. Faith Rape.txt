Lord of mercy, hear this prayer, do you listen?, do you care?
We are swine among the pearls, do you really love this vile world?

My faith has been raped

Are our lives cut and dried? Mapped out by fate, choice denied?
Are we toys that slowly broke? Our inherent faults, we have no hope

My faith has been raped

Like a soul without a mind - Like a head without a heart
Like a heaven without a God - My faith has been raped
