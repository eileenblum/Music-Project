I pray once more for an awesome flood,
Cleanse this world drowned in Heaven's blood
Retribution pissing from the sky,
All infection soon purified
Purify all the ugliness that I see,
All of hatred's animosity
Water breaking Mother Nature's womb,
give birth to cleanse this gaping wound

Rain - rain - let your vengeance rain down on me

No race, no faith, no-one will be saved,
World extinction, flooded floating grave
Serenity's dying dove of peace,
Our requiem, our symphony
No more war, no hate nor genocide,
Nothing will stop this ever rising tide
Showers of glass rain down from above,
Mass homicide defines pure love

Let your vengeance rain down on me,
Let the Heavens bleed, Let your vengeance rain down on me
