Iam Christ, yet I'm Judas too,
I am one, Yet my mind is torn in two

No love lost, I have no alibi, Iscariot's kiss,
Watch Pilot wash his hands in piss

Funeral around my heart - Round my heart -
Funeral, funeral - Funeral around my heart

Still I pray, for redemption's tourniquet,
Wrath from above, hawk ripped apart by a heavenly dove

Virgin pure, like that a whore would sell,
A war within, Mother Mary or Jezebel
