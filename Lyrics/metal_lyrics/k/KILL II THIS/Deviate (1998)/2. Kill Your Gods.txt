I pledge allegiance to whom I am,
though the weak may kneel, in strength I stand

Suffocated vows, salvation found,
your sacred cow bleeds, the great god you feed

Your Gods, Kill Your Gods, Kill Your Gods, Kill Your Gods

Blackened valleys of fear, I shall not dwell,
deafening silence erased, no misplaced faith

Graven idolatry, I shall not bow,
for believe in me, my blood, my creed

Burn down every deity, I will have no gods but me
