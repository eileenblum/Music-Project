In plain sight for all to see -
the whole wide world except for me
In my veins and in my blood -
the truth I see is clear as mud

I am infected, I am the host -
Father, Son and Holy Ghost
Thou shalt not covet, Thou shalt not kill -
Green with envy, Homicidal thrills

Trinity, Believe in me
Trinity, Believe in me
Trinity, Believe in me
Trinity, The path of truth and of light

Right before my eyes, the sun so Bright -
And yet I cannot see the light
Oh my God, where do I begin -
twisted with guilt, ingrained to sin

What of forgiveness and what about love
Father, why Hell when I?m your own flesh and blood
Why punish me for choices made
While rapists and murderers are saved
