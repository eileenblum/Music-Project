Stop asking questions - this is all you need to learn
Just read these words - just read these words

Why plan for the future? Why dwell on the past?
Why dance to the music? Why sing this song?
Why do anything? Why do anything?

We struggle in vain - through varying shades of pain
The truth will hurt - the truth will hurt

Why are you all crying? What will your tears achieve?
And the sorrow, scars and hurt, and the trouble, strife and woe

All these things will come to pass
The way of all flesh it cannot last
The way of all flesh - the way of all flesh

Each and all will see - everything is temporary
The cruel facts of life - the facts of life

Lifelong swandive till we?re all paralysed
Worn down, worn out - till the pressure shuts our eyes

Why plan for the future? Why dwell on the past?
Why dance to the music? Why sing this song?
Why do anything? Why do anything?

The same senseless conclusion
The same inevitable senseless conclusion
