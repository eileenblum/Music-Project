Heroin,
flowing through, the veins of our heavenly God
It deadens the pain of his fallen creation, narcotic oblivion

Anaesthetised and tranquilised -
Deny the sight of mankind?s planet paralysed
A human race with purest hate as their faith -
A world that went terribly wrong

Ignorance is bliss now that he is sedated
No longer weeping for the world he created

God?s new creed, He no longer cares,
He doesn?t need - Swirling disease called humanity
Infected Heaven and the whole house of God -
Inject, Reject reality

Intravenous high, Suicidal alibi
What if God overdoses and dies?
What if God overdoses and dies?
What if God dies?

God on drugs - No longer weeping for the world he created
God on drugs - The unbelievable truth
