My life regressed, childhood's caress
Childhood, like the waiting room of the world
Unaware of the pain that lies beyond
Unaware of the life of pain that lies beyond

Childhood like the waiting room of the world
Shooting stars so quickly fade away

Stop the flow, turn around the tide
My childhood shines beneath my strange disguise

Regress, retreat, back into myself
The only way to be noticed is to hide
