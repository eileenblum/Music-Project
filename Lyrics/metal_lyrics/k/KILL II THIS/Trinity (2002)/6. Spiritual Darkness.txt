A sad farewell - rejections sting - empty prayers,
Hopeless souls - hateful world - killed his faith
Through each age - apathy - breeds like a plague
Defective race - a love misplaced - He realised
There is no life, no life that does not die
The light can?t shine - the world went black

The day God turned his back
Washed his hands of the human bloodstain
Church of man prayed to every God that?s fake

The weight of greed crushes all in its sight
Vermin blind, left behind, shedding skin
A flood?s first tear, the world has wept for years
We?re on thin ice, the dam has cracked
