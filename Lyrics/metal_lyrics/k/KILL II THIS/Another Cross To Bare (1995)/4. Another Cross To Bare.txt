Mass hypnosis in demand
Subconsciousness plays another hand
Ask the question 'Do I know who I am'
Reality a concept I can't understand
Fountain of truth, illusion of lies
How do I say I'm dying inside?
How to explain what I can't remember myself
I could never I could never

I'm the enemy, Apathy, Hypocrisy
I, I feel such pain, Guilt and shame
My faith is raped, One more heartache
Another cross to bare

Sign your fate your legacy
Invade my land preaching apathy
Teach the nation pure hypocrisy
Sacrifice your enemy in the name of democracy
Elected voice, body of the brave
Tongue for the dumb till they kingdom come
God only knows I don't know where the answer lies
I just don't know I just don't know
I am the enemy - apathy, I am the enemy - hypocrisy
Another cross to bare
I've got a cross to bare, I've got the whole world's cross to bare
