Withoutblack we could not see the light
Without sight we could not see we're blind
Without death there'd be no life to mourn
Without sin there'd be no crown of thorns

Baptise my eyes
With rape and murder of a new design
This world's sweet caress
Read the signs
Blessed are the blind

There's no faith no faith worth dying for
There's no cause no cause worth killing for
There's no fate but the fate that we choose
All our lies help us to see the truth

Blessed are the meek - For they shall inherit the earth
Blessed are the blind - For they don't have to see this fucked up world

All our pain persecution the thrill
Craving for war our bloodthirst fulfilled
All I see corruption grieving and fear
Humanity our defection's so clear
