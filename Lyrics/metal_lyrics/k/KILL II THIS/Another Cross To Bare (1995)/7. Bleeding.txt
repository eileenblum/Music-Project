Sliceaway the streams of fear, Face the trauma, the black becomes clear
Feel the blade feel inner peace, Blood will flow like a pressure release

Cracked emotions
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding
Problems deceased
I'm bleeding, my pressure's released

Carved my wrist but missed the vein, Way too shallow, my problems remain
My temple I desecrate, Can't face the future my past is my fate

You brought me flowers
It was more than you gave me when I was alive
Your cold eyes shed a tear
More emotion in a second than you showed me in a lifetime
You said that you will miss me
Then you bent down and kissed me
But the warmth had passed from your lips
