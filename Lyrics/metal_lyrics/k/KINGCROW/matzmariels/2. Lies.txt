Into deepest loneliness I fall
Through my secret prison

Here into my prison where you can't overtake me
I locked up the iron door before my spirit
Here into my prison that's no one that can hurt me
So I'm alone but safe into my world

In the years of freedom when innocence held sway
I did give my friendly help to every needy
With the elder days this habit was preserved
So vultures have sorrounded all my life

If I look into your eyes now I see only

Lies,
Still now that I should have been skilled
Every time I try I'm crucifyed

Here into my prison I muse over my future
And I cry out for revenge towards the shadows
Here into my prison with bloodshot glance I'm waiting
For everyone to come under my hand

If I look into your eyes now I see only

Lies,
Still now that I should have been skilled
Every time I try I'm crucifyed
