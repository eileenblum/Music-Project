There from above the rain falls down
Falls to wash all his thoughts away
And there he stands alone on the hill
To remind the dark in his past

From the magic waters... 
... Echoes of hope...

But now is the time to restart to live
'cause the rainbow is golden today
And after the storm he can turn to live
On the wings of his dream again

Waiting for the day
When he'll rise again
Kingdom lost in pain
