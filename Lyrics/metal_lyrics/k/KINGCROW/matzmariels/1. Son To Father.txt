Maybe the day has come
The child became a warrior
Into my dream you ride
The wicked days are gone

Today my gun awaits
It's waiting for your pray
I want to see your eyes
The fear mask and the cry

Every time you smile
Is a time to shoot
Every time you cry
Is a time to smile

You have destroyed my fate...

I will never forget childhood
I will never forgive you know
I won't be satisfied, father
Till I will catch your life
