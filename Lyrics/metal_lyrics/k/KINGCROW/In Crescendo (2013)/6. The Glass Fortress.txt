Waitinâ
Itâs so much time Iâm waitinâ
You donât respond
While Iâm right here tryinâ to call
Stayed awake
Tryinâ to stop myself drinkinâ
The ceiling burns
In this cold sunrise halflight

[Phone voice mail:]
âUm, when you hear this message please, please call me back. This time Iâm really going to change, trust me.â

I have lost my lifeblood
I am drowninâ
Drowninâ in a rushing river with no escape
Why do you not hear my screams?

I still make mistakes
Itâs hard to change now
And weâre far away
Then itâs time to rise to the surface
I know youâre waiting for me now

Loneliness is my blame
And Iâm walkinâ
Walkinâ in the darkness of an endless night
Is the dawn still there?

Emptiness inside me
I killed your heart
And I wasted my life with my deepest sin
Will I ever rise again?
