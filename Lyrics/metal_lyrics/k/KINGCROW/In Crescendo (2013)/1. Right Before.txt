Hush, stop roaming around boy
Digging the ground
âCause there is no freedom

Day by day in the dark
Fear betrays your heart
You canât see the chains

Choices have side effects
You canât hide anywhere

Not so deep in the soil a seed will rise
Not so deep thereâs your will, the will to rise

Unleash the anger from the ashes of your pain that day will come

When you defend the right
To be who you are boy
Donât you feel your life

Holding on to your dreams
Whatever it means
Donât you feel alive?

Choices have side effects
So do your own mistakes

Unleash the anger from the ashes of your pain that day will come
Unleash the anger from the ashes of your pain that day has come
