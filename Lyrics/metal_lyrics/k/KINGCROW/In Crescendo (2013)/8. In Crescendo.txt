ACTION:
There she stands alone
The girl facing the mirror
Is trying to close here eyes before she cries
And now she knows
Her life will be so different
Before she was still young
She canât turn back

There she stands alone
The girl facing the mirror
Has run away from home long time ago
And now she knows
There is no happy ending
No charming prince to take her far away

Why?

REACTION:
His brown eyes and that cologne she will never forget
On the ground feelinâ elsewhere all the time that they shared
What went wrong now that the belly comes out from the shirt
Sheâs afraid what she would give to be told âitâs OKâ

Falling

Please donât judge me baby
When you are all grown up
Now you still donât know me
But my life is yours

Please donât judge me honey
When you are grown up
Iâve just felt your moving
Can you hear my voice?

I know youâll be the chance to find the love Iâve never had
Itâs hard but not too l ate to find a way out of my mess
I wonât run away I can deal with what I used to hide
All I really needed was the only thing I couldnât find

Wipe your eyes

It will be OKâ¦
