Once youâve said these words to me
âPlease donât come near again
Every time we get too close your touch turns into painâ
On this rose too many thorns
Iâve been through it myself
Stronger gets her heady smell
Deeper wounds on my skin
My skin

For no reason like the waves
Drifting on to the rocks
We can run like hell from shore
But weâre doomed to return

I canât
I quit

I know we both know it wasnât meant to be like this
Since when the word love for us means only shedding tears

This ainât another love song
