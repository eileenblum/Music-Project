Summer â97
We sat down there in silence
Staring at the oceanâs clouds
The echo of laughs and whispers
That time has gone
But eyes closed I can feel it once again

Found no answer
Staring at the sun
Feeling unsafe and so untouchable
All those feelings â closed behind walls
I built up waiting for you to break through
What a fool I used to be back then

Never ending
Any answer
Bridges were burnt

So I locked the door behind my back
Swallowed by the bedroom
Wanted to sleep till the end of pain
Just to disappear

Never ending
Any answer
Bridges were burnt

Till I rose again

Then last week I saw you once again
Well isnât it so strange?
Once you were the main thing in my life
And now I couldnât care less
