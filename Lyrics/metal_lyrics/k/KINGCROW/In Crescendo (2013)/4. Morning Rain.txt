Hi dad
It is never too late to talk
You know
As you always used to say but now
Silence
Falls down
My gaze
To the ground

Memories make a sound â sometimes I can hear it
Itâs like an early morning rain
And I lose myself â like an endless river
Love is flowing by my side â I can still hear you calling me
