As he steps out in the black
Through low cost dreams in market streets
He feels like heâs becoming invisible
The boy gets visions in his head
A need to escape catches his heart
Starts feeling like nothing is impossible

He feels ready for the race
Young enough to not be afraid
Of trying the bitter taste of failure
Prozac helps him to elevate
Climbing up the Wall Street trade
âCause the view is just something incredible

Just beyond the golden drowning line
Sheep become wolves
Hunting into the fence

Just beyond the golden drowning line
Sometimes some of us just stop to swim
But no one is blameless
