Late at night I close my eyes
Thereâs no one here close to me
Suddenly my mind is upset
I look around Iâm scared

I hear voices, I see red eyes
Iâm surrounded, I am kidnapped
The nightmare is back, itâs tearing me apart
Feel paralyzed, cannot breathe
Far away I see a dim light
No I donât want to die

Burning eyes stare at me
Creeping hand holding me
Iâm inside the nightmare
It is dark all around

Deep down inside I
Can defeat my fears and
I know something great
That I want you to know

Now I can get out of my maze
Tell the world I am alive
Tell the world Iâve found the way
I can get out of my maze

Late at night I close my eyes
No I donât care when I die
