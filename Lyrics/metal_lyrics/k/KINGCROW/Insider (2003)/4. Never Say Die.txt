[Music: D. Cafolla, Lyrics: M. Gelsomini]

[Jason:]

Mankind...
There's a menace that hangs on your head...
Never thought that maybe it's ourselves?
And no matter if once we repel
'cause it quietly stays hidden in men...

Thinking in the dim light
what if had a son?
searching for a reason to hold on

(so) Never say die
another like me
It's to be found

Never give up
and for once more
let's try to trust

Try not to lose heart
Lightness is slowly dying out
