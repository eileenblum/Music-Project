[Music: D. Cafolla, I. Nastasi, M. Gelsomini, Lyrics: M. Gelsomini]

[Alan:]

What was to be done is done
Jason now is posted up
My own burden overwhelmed
It's my last gift for a friend

My name is written, my shoulders will never be safe
I'll fall asleep a last time in a dread
One from the darkness will rise to do me in

There is a shadow approaching me

[Killer:]

Here is your hangman, your scoundrel
(The Killing Hand)
You can't escape from my justice
(The Killing Hand)

[Alan:]

My last night has come at last
Taming me an unjust rest
I will die with such a quest
Jason, will you never guess?

My heart is pounding, the end has arrived at my door
I'll fall asleep a last time in a dread
My last desire is to die without sorrow

There is a shadow approaching me

[Killer:]

Here is your hangman, your scoundrel
(The Killing Hand)
You can't escape from my justice
(The Killing Hand)

Voice:

Curtain falls...
Alan's eyes are closing
Last image...

..."you could have been rich..."

[Alan:]

What a deal...
Everything is lost now
Without peace
even in death I'll stay...

My name is written, my shoulders will never be safe
I'll fall asleep a last time in a dread
One from the darkness will rise to do me in

There is a shadow approaching me

[Killer:]

Here is your hangman, your scoundrel
(The Killing Hand)
You can't escape from my justice
(The Killing Hand)
