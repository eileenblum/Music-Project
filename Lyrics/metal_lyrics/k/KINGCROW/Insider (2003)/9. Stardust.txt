[Music: D. Cafolla, Lyrics: M. Gelsomini, D. Cafolla]

[Jason:]

What am I? Dust in the wind
Who am I? An angel without wings
Where am I? In a broken mirror
A golden prison can't take away my heart

Why am I in this restless night
Why am I in this endless fight against the world?
We're only Stardust

Welcome behind the wall
Here nothing seems real
Prisoner of my wasted dream
Under an Icy rain - trapped in another time

In a time of hate I'm only a stranger in the night

We're Only Stardust - Only a tear in the rain
