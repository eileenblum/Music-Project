[Music: D. Cafolla, Lyrics: M. Gelsomini]

[Jason:]

By the window-pane I see
All those figures strangers to me
By the glass inside my eyes
I can show all happenings gone by

Here the silence has been bribed
who was troubling now is confined
In a cell a second time
They can shut up me not my mind

Save me tonight
can't you feel remorse inside?
So I scream save me tonight
before to madness I drive
Before I go...
