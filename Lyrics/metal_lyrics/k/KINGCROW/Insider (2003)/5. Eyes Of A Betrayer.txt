[Music: D. Cafolla, Lyrics: M. Gelsomini, D. Cafolla]

[Alan:]

Through dark I'm moving
And silence is my friend
The mission now has started:
To find and take the trail!
While Jason sleeps in darkness
I feel my heart that runs
My power my temptation
The sin's now in my hands

Oh, but now I can't find what they want
Oh, but now I can't leave,
Now I can't fail in this way

I must find it!
They'll give power to me
Forever and on
I must find it!
They'll give power to me
Forever and ever and on

Fumbling in the shadows
(the terror to be found)
I think about the glory
The U-turn of a life
When this task will be over
I'll be sure of my fate
The moment of my rising
Is bound to the game

Oh, but now I can't find what they want
Oh, but now I can't leave,
Now I can't fail in this way

I must find it!
They'll give power to me
Forever and on
I must find it!
They'll give power to me
Forever and ever and on
