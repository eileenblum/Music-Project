[Music: D. Cafolla, Lyrics: M. Gelsomini]

[Jason:]

I found a secret hidden in dark
Something that no one knows
A revelation to my eyes
Words I can't understand inside it

What does it mean?
What does it hide?
The Federation's job is clearer now...
I can see the plot, it's laying down...
And I feel dismayed...

I have to spread the news
This plan must come to nothing
I have to spread the news
The project must be halted

Life evolution out of control
No more a human birth
In a society so produced
Perfect and working for a sole end

Taking the right
Rejecting the wrong
The Federation's job is clearer now...
I can see the plot, it's laying down...
And I feel dismayed...

I have to spread the news
This plan must come to nothing
I have to spread the news
The project must be halted
