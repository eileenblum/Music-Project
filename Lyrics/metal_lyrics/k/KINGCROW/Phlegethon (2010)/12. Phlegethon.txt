Ah, again, a fall...
For the one who betrays...
My dear...

Praying and mourning the story is not going to change
The grand final â the floodlights have risen again

[Voice-over:]
Soaring in silence
Floating in fire

Now â go back and think of
All our days of joy
Smiles that were to leave to silent fall

Bringing again to surface
What you did forget
What caused all tour nightly dreams to fail

And my hands desired
To hush up the boasts of who cherished as he said:
"A shameful teaching I am charged to correct â father..."

Alone
There he stands
Eyes cast down
On the water
She lay
Full of grace
On those waves
Eyes wide open

[Voice-over:]
Seems like yesterday â us and them
But life draws our paths â some we would not choose

Blind and greedy, oh wrath made me insane
Spurs me onward in my endless pain
Some emotions can be deeply scary
But we cannot shut them up â that voice
If I can't be the one who possess
No one else will ever be with her
