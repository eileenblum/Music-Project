A growing understanding
Summers fade into the darkest fall
my brief thoughtless youth
slowly walked off â no more regrets

Like the Cotard's syndrome
beauty if life spilled out of me
after all those years
So faithful â to you

[Voice-over:]
I'm drownin' in this pain

how did this happen
[Voice-over:]
I mean â life seems to be so wrong
which is the meaning â when you feel all hope is gone

how did this happen?
[Voice-over:]
you turned your gaze away from me
That howling silence that still echoes in my head

Falling behind the events horizon
of the black hole that replaced my painful heart
There is no way to retrace my footsteps
I feel so empty inside â anesthetized
