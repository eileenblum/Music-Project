Closed in a dark embrace we'll act against adversity
Blurting our minds and souls the fate allowed to lay aside
Ashes of broken limbs remain from our cinder
Rest in the fireplace before the sight of awareness

(Strained)

Down it the deep of a dying heart's believer
Something that crawls and rise up again
When the lambs cry it's time for the reason
Glimmers of hope that only outstand

Scenes from a remote past can live down the corner
Turning the page of life somehow can be your strength of will
