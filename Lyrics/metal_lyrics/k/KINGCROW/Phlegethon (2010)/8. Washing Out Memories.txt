Resting on my laurels
One more time of calmness and I'll wake
Second thoughts keep waiting
Now my will is called to prevail
Take up all my duties
Put aside a while by your fancy
I can't skirt them again
This should be the end of the game...

Something's claiming wildly its right of way

Thanks for all the days and nights
Your vanilla kisses still rolling
Cover mind and spirit
Hiding the outer side as a cream
Washing out the memories
To forgive your face and your taste
I know it can be painful
So I'll make believe I don't care

Just another mark into my brain

Though it's not time to turn the page
Love can burn
Till the heart
Is not too tires to keep it safe
Maybe I'll cry
Washing out memories
