Lay down and sleep peaceful and quiet
Look upon you there's someone who cares
Lights on the wall dispel the shades
So close your eyes and let the dream go

here on your bed singing a song
Follow my rhymes, they'll let you dream

Lay down and sleep... peaceful and quiet
Look upon you there's someone who cares
Lights on the wall dispel the shades
So close your eyes and let the dream go

[Voice-over:]
I'm next to you
Watching you smiling and nuzzling up t'me
I tuck you in
The candle is burning out, can you hear me breathe?
(Good night)

Silently all your toys lie around on the floor
Dancing dolls have their rest near the half-opened door
Lullaby as sunflowers your sweet smile will bloom
Close your eyes dreams are hidden in this silent night
