When you're stuck inside by your own decision
When you're closest again to a dead end street
Well the time has arrived for abrupt occasions
Can you still see a chance as it will appear?

It discloses sometimes with a darkened shining
Maybe time and again you will oversleep
And a breath gaping now as you've been proceeding
When it's too late to evade from a certain slip

[Voice-over:]
Take a look inside your vision
One mission - one aim
Lift filters from your eyes
Illusion are shattered by your own will

Yes I'm wondering why an escape
Can seduce a simple occasion
In a moment when I hesitate
Gives the way for mental evasion
