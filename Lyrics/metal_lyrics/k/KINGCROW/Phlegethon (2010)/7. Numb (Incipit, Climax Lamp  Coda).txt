An evil passion remaining hidden
Until a runaway spark
Begins the action, a chain reaction
Unleashes what lies beyond

A growing cancer that slowly increases
Is greedily eating inside
A scary truth that's creeping hidden
Sure you'd be curious to know?

Drive is rising as we get closer
Dark desire behind sweetheart

[Voice-over:]
Longing for you I'm eager I'm impatient
Can't wait to see your smile, your silhouette - again
Longing for you I'm eager I'm impatient
Can't wait to see your cry, your silhouette - in pain

Feel my hugs - so intense and strong
Cry in low voice if I hold too much
Overlie your emotions now
Please forgive me if I roughly act

Take me as I am and let yourself go - deep

[Voice-over:]
Longing for you I'm eager I'm impatient
Can't wait to see your cry, your silhouette - in pain

Drift away - feel too much
While we were the feeding the flesh
You and I - right below the surface
While we were feeding the flesh

Can't hear the sound, won't see the scars
Your pillow softens all the blows
Can't hear the sound, won't feel the tears
As they are drawn on our sheets
