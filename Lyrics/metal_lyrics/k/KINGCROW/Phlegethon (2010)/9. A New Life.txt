The sun is rising up today
I can see it through the leaden sky
I can feel a warm embrace
That fills my aching soul

Now life is calling you
Listen to these magic sounds
I am no longer alone
I'll never be afraid again

You're coming to life
My love will soon fill your heart
Holding you in my arms
Waiting for your cry
My whole life... is you
