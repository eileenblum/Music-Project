Miles away
City lights are sparkling in the summer night
The wind carries the noise of their life to me
A quiet, distant choir of prayers, dreams and hopes
Entrusted to the nightâs care while Iâm miles away
Feeling disconnected from whatâs left behind
Pretending to be stronger

Ran away
Didnât want to break you but whatâs left to say?
Every time I lied but I dug a hole
Where I used to hide, but just canât anymore

Went away
I walked through the crowd but still felt alone
Each one seemed so focused on his inner self
Like a quiet whisper in a screaming world
Buried by indifference but I

Ran away
Didnât want to break you but whatâs left to say?
Every time I lied

Now itâs time
Iâm gonna leave, thereâs nothing that can stop me now
Now itâs time
My sweet oblivion, shut the door, throw away the key

Flying
Dying
Back to fear land
Reborn again
If only I could be me
The real me
So many miles away

[2x]
Ran away
Didnât want to break you but whatâs left to say?
Every time I lied but I dug a hole
Where I used to hide, but just canât anymore
Pretending to be stronger

Now itâs time
Iâm gonna leave, thereâs nothing that can stop me now
Now itâs time
My sweet oblivion, shut the door, throw away the key
