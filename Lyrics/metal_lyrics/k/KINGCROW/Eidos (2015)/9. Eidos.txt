Only background noise
Echoes of lives that almost were
Murdered in essence
These are my hands covered in blood

Why?
Iâm bleeding, Iâm bleeding right now
Am I?
Am I just dreaming, just dreaming or not?

Iâve got a cut inside, a little wound I cannot close
A little scratch inside, the more I breathe the more it grows
Iâve got a wound inside, something Iâve never felt before
A little scratch inside, forgotten scars come back and hurt

No, I donât know what went wrong
I tried so hard, changed myself to make the pieces fit
But all that kept me alive is slowly killing me
Will it really end like this?

I got a cut inside, bleeding our my unfulfilled hopes
A little scratch inside a crimson mouth of wasted words

[A]
Thereâs a man on the edge
Torn apart by his fears
Thereâs a house made of cards
Blown away by the wind

[B]
Thereâs a man on the edge
No more tricks, no Plan B
Plastic bag on the head
Just to choke all his dreams

[C]
Thereâs a man on the edge
Things are not what they seem
But who knows what is true
Behind this lucid dream?

[D]
Wake up right now
Thereâs a way out!

So facing your dark side sometimes means to plunge to the depths
They say the darkest hour is the one just before the dawn
