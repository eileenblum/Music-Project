I was once on a ship full of hopes and I lived for a wonderful dream
I had floated and fell through the waves and a cold leaden sky loomed above
Heavy rain fell over me
Torrid storms came down on me

My dreams are locked away for good
My heart no longer has the desire to go out to sea
My dreams are locked away for good
My heart no longer has the desire to go out to sea
Iâve got no more desires

You did not realize you were breaking my heart with the words that you said
I was strong and was brave, but these feelings were trapped in my mind, deep inside
Heavy words that hurt my pride
Donât you think Iâm breaking down?

My dreams are locked away for good
My heart no longer has the desire to go out to sea
My dreams are locked away for good
My heart no longer has the desire to go out to sea
Iâve got no more desires

A new dawn is waiting for me
Filling up my emptiness
Iâm still trying to live
It will never be the same
