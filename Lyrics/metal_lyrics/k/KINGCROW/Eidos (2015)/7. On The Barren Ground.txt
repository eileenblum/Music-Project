We are
We stir from within
We dream
Of what weâd like to be
We keep waiting âtill we fall
We sow seeds on the barren ground

And we speak of freedom
We speak of heaven
We speak of faith
And we fear the strange
Or have fear of failure
We fear our fate
Living like someone in a no manâs land

Here we are
Safe, hid behind the wall
Just checking all cracks that could cause collapse
Here we are
Safe, lyinâ in the mud
Cause we gave up flyinâ to prevent our fall, again

And we speak of freedom
We speak of heaven
We speak of faith
And we fear the strange
Or have fear of failure
We fear our fate
Living like someone in a no manâs land

And we speak of freedom
We speak of heaven
We speak of faith
And we fear the strange
Or have fear of failure
Weâre scared to change
Then we close the door and we call it fate
