Moonlight painted glow
Touched our furrowed brows
Just inhale the dark now
On this restless night

Every turn I took
Everything I knew
What it would be like now
If someone else, not you

Sometimes I just wonder
While I look at you
Have I spent a lifetime
Hiding from the truth?

Donât look behind...
