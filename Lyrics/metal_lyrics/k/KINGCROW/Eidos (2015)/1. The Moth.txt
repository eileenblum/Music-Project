Really donât you realize
What you lost during your search for glory?
Just like moths we may go blind
Chasing for the glow of our desires

Time keeps crawling
While youâre burning
Time keeps crawling
While youâre burning

Dealing with some big regret
Or dreaming of a different line somewhere else
Someone else
And your heroes turned to dust
Did you trade your dreams for common knowledge?
Was it far?

Time keeps crawling
While youâre burning
Time keeps crawling
While youâre burning

Sometimes
It calls
And the past howls through the night
Feels like drowning again
Like drowning...
