The promise that you made
âYouâll never be aloneâ
To that adoring child
âIâll join you on your pathâ
Countless moments
Your words helped me
Stand on my feet again
âYouâll never be aloneâ

Now your final moments slip away so fast
While Iâm holding your hand
Life is strange sometimes
Iâm echoing your words

Together we are and will stay
Perhaps just in a different way
The moments we shared, the words that we said
I only know this
That what we had wonât die

A strong connection
Something never felt before
No clear direction
Something never tried before

Youâre always by my side
âCause nothing really dies
Youâre always by my side
âCause nothing really dies

The promise that you made
Iâm making to you now

A thread that never breaks
âYouâll never be aloneâ
All that we carry inside

Together we are and will stay
Perhaps just in a different way
The moments we shared, the words that we said
I only know this
That what we had wonât die
And this is not goodbye...
