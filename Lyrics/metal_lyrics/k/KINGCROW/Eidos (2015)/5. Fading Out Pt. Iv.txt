Light drawing my shadow on the cold concrete
While all of my senses now tell me to leave
What awaits me now?
I look at the skyline as it fades away
And takinâ the night by surprise âcause I hate
I hate long goodbyes

Keep walking
Youâve got no choice
Keep walking
Look ahead and go

Itâs all up to you
Somewhere else again
Take it to the end
Go beyond the pain
And roll the dice
Play the game

Life is telling you
(Now can you hear it?)
That youâre someone else
(That inner voice)
Take it to the end
(Now can you hear it?)
Go beyond the pain
Then roll that dice
To play again

Keep walking
Youâve got no choice
Keep walking
Look ahead and go
