You walk alone through your suffering
And watch as your feet go forth
From noisy silence, no whisper
No hints of why you are here

Youâre far away, where dreams and fears collide
Without a reason why, for a moment the burdenâs less heavy to bear
When you stare at the open sky, where all the shades have a place
Stare at the open sky and go find yours among them
Let it go

Drowning to come ashore, âcause Iâm drowning in all this light
It is cominâ, flowinâ, growinâ into my burning mind
