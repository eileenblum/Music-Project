Burning eyes and large black wings 
Fly in your dream 
Dead skin mask and icy breath 
in your destiny  

Yes - I'm kingcrow 
Well - I'm kingcrow 
I catch the fear in your soul  

Yes - I'm kingcrow 
Well - I'm kingcrow 
I catch the fear in your soul  

Born by the river of the night 
into your dreams 
I am the nightmare 
of Childhood's Sleep
