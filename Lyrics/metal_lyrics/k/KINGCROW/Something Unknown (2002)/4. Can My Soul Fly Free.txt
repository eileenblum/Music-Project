Sunrise will come slowly 
What do you think and Dream? 
Where are you going with your head? 
Another day in your pain... 
There is a thing in my head 
That makes me so sad and strange... 
When I Look the Great Blue Sky 
Every day above My Head...  

Heavy heart on my way 
Can my soul fly free? 
Without wings - Down in the cage 
Can my dream fly away?  

Out of the world 
the tears that I have shed 
Deep in my mind 
where the dream is right 
there's a place in my soul 
where the emotions are free 
and I know that this place 
isn't only a dream 

Can my soul fly free? 
Can I realize my dreams?
