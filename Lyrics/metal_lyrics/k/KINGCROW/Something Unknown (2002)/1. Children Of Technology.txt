There's a shadow that treads the thought
And fear is its only whip 
Destiny ends under a dying sun 
Hybrid beings who creep in dust  

Creation of the human 
brain without heart 
Velvet hands of the new 
God that move in dark  

Children of technology 
Children of a new world  

Bribed prophets who sell desires 
sell the ticket to our end 
heaven in hell under a burnin' moon 
and we die with a smiling face
