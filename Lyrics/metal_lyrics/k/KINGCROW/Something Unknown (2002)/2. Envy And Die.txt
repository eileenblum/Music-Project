Many voices about my plans 
by your lips of hate 
many voices about a dying king   

Now my fate is moving 
while you're falling on your knees 
watch my mighty kingdom 
feel the power we bring!  

I will smile tonight 
Watching you envy and die   

Lord above 
we pray for your mercy 
we know the price 
for all who speak about 
we know
