Comes always in the night 
Carried away by the waves 
Sometimes - Something - Somewhere....   Something Unknown   

See me in the night under Moonlight's gold 
see the sorrow in my soul 
seeking the truth - I'm driftin' away 
Watch me pray in the light of day 
Silent is the air in my dark dream  

Carried away by the waves... 
Carry On
