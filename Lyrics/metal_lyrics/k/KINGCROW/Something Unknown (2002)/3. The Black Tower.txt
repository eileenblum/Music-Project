Many lights that shine so high 
Burn above your head 
Many miles on your way 
Through another land   

you'll never reach the end 
you'll never reach the end   

Man in black on your way 
On a desert plane 
Tarot cards call three men 
from another world   

Day and night on his way 
your insanity, the reason of your life  

Black Tower Is Your Aim 
Another Dimension 
Black Tower is Your Aim 
Is Your Obsession  

Into your subconcious mind 
You're travellin' on 
The meaning of exsistence 
To you is shown 

Three are your ways to it
three doors for the call of three  

Black Tower Is Your Aim 
Another Dimension 
Black Tower is Your Aim
Is Your Obsession........

What happens in your head? 
Where is your final day? 
At the end... 
Their fate in your hands 
Your destiny is the edge 
Of the world  

Oh - They are ready to go!
Oh - There are so many worlds
