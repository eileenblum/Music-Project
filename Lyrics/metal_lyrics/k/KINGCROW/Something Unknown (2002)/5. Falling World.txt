Here I'm waiting on the edge of night 
where walking shadows sorround the light 
While the world is falling down  

Here I'm standing in my darkest dream 
In the temple of immortal kings 
Icy walls of glass are crashing slow  

Is this vision only in my head? 
Or is the world going to the end?  

Falling World - Goes Down 
Falling World - Into The Edge Of Time 
Falling World - Goes Down 
Falling World - Into The Edge Of Time  

When I sleep the vision came in my head
Human sacrifice - black wings of death 
Fly high on a dying earth  

The seed of decadence is growing fast 
Its fruits are deadly - its trees are dead 
While the sky is falling down
