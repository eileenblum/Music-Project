A Holy Flame that burns inside 
and Only I know the pain tonight 
'cause I try to save myself 
From the Grave 
In the night Evil Eyes are watching me 
dying Alone  

Back to my life - Back to my pain 
Every second I've lived 
Dark is the way of memory's eyes 
My heart is heavy again...  

Fear is the key of our decay 
Frozen in pieces of my dream 
Waves on the sirens who call my name 
Down in the ocean of life  

Oh All I Know, it's too late for the prayer 
Oh-All I Want , is the peace of my mind
