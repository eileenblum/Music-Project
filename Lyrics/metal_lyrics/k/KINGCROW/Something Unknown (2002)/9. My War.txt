I Blind fury 
II Shadows in my nightmares 
III Good Bye...  

I'm Far From Home Another Mile 
In The Wind I'm Coming 
To The Land Of Freedom 
I Bring my Heart In My Hands 
And I Bring my Hope In My soul... 
Another Mile, To Reach My Home..... 
and Here Dies My Hope  

I'm Riding on the Edge between 
burnin' madness and normality
My Blind Fury was baptized 
in a river of runnin' blood 
when The Enemy came from the hell 
and I lost my sons in blood  

Now I'm storming the walls   

Shadows in my nightmares 
Marchin' dead in the mud 
The battle field is red
Thousand innocents are dying 
one day we'll pay for all this pain 
and I was never meant to be.......(cries) 
Their Cries Every Night 
Scream Loud in My Mind 
Damned For Eternity or 
How Many Years in Pain?  

Good bye my friend...... good bye 
this is the end of my war
tonight my heart is finally free 
I can't resist another day 
my eyes tonight are full of pain 
but this is the best of my last days  

Oh-Oh good bye 
Oh-Oh tonight
