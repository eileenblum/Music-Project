hide away from the world and tell me do you like it now hide away from your friends and tell me do you like it now hide away from yourself and tell me do you like it now hide away from everything and tell me do you like it now she pulls me as i close the door painful somethings that i can't ignore with your hands tied tight around your back pull me close avoid a heart attack with the timing and rhyming in your dreams and the lucid visions in your screams that look in your eye means discriminate look at me and wonder why i hate i close my mind i close my mind i close my mind burn me kill me stab me do everything but let me breathe burn me kill me stab me everything is laced with jealousy kill me with the hate that's in you kill me with the weight that's in you kill me with the hate inside you hate me then make me hate you i close my mind i close my mind i close my mind right toward you i close my fist to hit you i wrap my hands around you only thinking to fucking choke you i have this vengeance in me i have the revenge in me i force this revenge on you i only want to make you bleed
