this feeling cannot be real it's not my time to feel my soul seep through my pores leaves me wanting more look up at the dark night i suck my last breath dying i feel the fright as my body loses life horrible pain lonely death you drown in deep regrets my fears cannot subside that look down in your eyes drown down look around knowing that no one's going to hear a sound my fears can't subside that look down in your eyes blood-drenched tears flow pain you can't know how did i get left standing here vengeance breeds fear broken dreams are never more
