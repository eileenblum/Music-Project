blasted past the cops blasted off the earth i found a new sky i found a new birth break away from here kill all of my fears break away from here kill all of my fears why did you cry the pain is shared deep inside the pain is over between us i say i found a new sky i found a new birth yes this will hurt the pain's in both my eyes i tell you now don't look back with no regrets and yes this will hurt the pain's in both my eyes i say and i want to see and i want to be (free) you won't believe the pain in both my eyes i scream lie asleep hearts break heart quake
