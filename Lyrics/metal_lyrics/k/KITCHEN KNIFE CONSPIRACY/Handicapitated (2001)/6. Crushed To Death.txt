pressure comes down bending your mindset no doubt is left you feel helplessness under the weight muscles are collapsing the sweat pours down inside nothing left resist the strain your knees break down with your last breath realize severed life life flashing by last moments pass pain swallows whole your life you see your blood begging for death to come put out the flames of pain blood fills your throat and lungs your hope filled dreams are drained world echoes with your cries bones twisting as you die no remorse from me you'll get no sympathy the judgment day is now and I will force you down tried I've tried to find some piece of mind in making you fall to your knees lies you throw at me are now empty your death will make me feel like god four ton weight it will seal your fate as it plummets down and lays a deep crack in your skull my revenge thought you were my friend justice will be served I'll dump you in a compactor crushed to death I know your child's at home awaiting your return that kid will feel alone when you are discovered a pile of bones and flesh bloody and violent mess sticks with me your pitiful pleas but I followed through with plans to end your worthless life punishment brutal as it gets die you backstabber did you hear your bones snapping crushed crushed
