deranged I stand alone flying above the zone to live and to die alone and I hate it craving a better place gather up in my face craving a better place so fuck this deranged I stand alone flying above the zone to live and to die alone so fuck you you cannot see me from inside a closed mind breath is an everyday thing a sacrifice you cannot see me from inside a closed mind just go away it's the calm before my storm everyday's a lie suicide crucify every single day that I take the abuse every single day all I want to say is fuck you
