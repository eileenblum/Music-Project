I see my life before me it's a struggle everyday taken away with the new fears in my head it's a new rage of frustration you don't know cause you're never inside of me you don't know cause it's sucking like a leech you don't know what my mental state is everyday everyone is a hollow shell meaningless pick you up take you in right by my side what is left nothing else no more pride want it want it back want it want it back falling crawling leeching bleaching circles spinning nothing's changing come in go in just crawl I'll build a wall to hide from the rest of you a wall to hide behind the fucking truth you might feel but you'll never have feelings think you know me but you never will
