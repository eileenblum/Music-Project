Murder--there's blood on the windows
Torture--there's blood on the flowers
Pervert--his head's now his football
Gutted--guts exposed for all
The asshole is a virgin, his guts will rain in blood,
One more pet homicide, take all your pets inside
The asshole is a virgin, he's now an amputee,
Intestines used for a noose, the killer's on the loose
Murder--there's blood on the windows
Gutted--guts exposed for all
Everything:everything is covered in your pet's blood
Can't fight the urge:the urge to kill
Smiling is projectile--this belongs to no one loose in the world
Feeding off of other's confusion,
Sober and broke fearing the institution
Mental pain--Prominent are the scars of yesterday
Mental pain--Prominent are the scars from all the years
Don't leave your pets outside
The meaning of life--the meaning of what?
Just remember that the way he thinks is not like you
