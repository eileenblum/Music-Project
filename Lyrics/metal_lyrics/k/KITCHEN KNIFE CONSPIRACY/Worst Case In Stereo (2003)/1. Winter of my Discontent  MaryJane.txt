This is your first lesson in stress relief
Breathe. . .
Everyday I'm feeling like this
Everyday I am high
Settle down and have a smoke, son
Tell me what's on your mind
This is getting to be so frustrating
Getting high is helping my life
I am not a criminal
Exhale. . .
Now don't you feel a lot better?
Do you feel cleansed inside?
I can tell you're stoned, son
It's time to restart your mind
This is getting to be so irritating
They want to arrest me cause I get high
I am not a criminal
Not guilty
