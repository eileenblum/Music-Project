I'm writing a suicide note
and you can't pull me out of this,
my depression is too dark
And you can't pull me out of this,
my depression is too smart
God can't pull me out of this,
my depression is too obvious
I can't pull me out of this,
my depression is too pissed
But I can tell you all of this
I don't care if I will be missed
Writing this suicide note
Inside my head I am better off dead
Something's possessing--depressing me
I don't know what it is
It constantly destroys and toys with me
This life is getting me pissed
Dead dead dead dead
dead dead dead dead
I'm fighting this suicide note
I knew it all
All along that I was gone
Do you think this is easy?
Do you think life is easy?
Now I am frozen in life, preserved in Hell
I'll stay all night
