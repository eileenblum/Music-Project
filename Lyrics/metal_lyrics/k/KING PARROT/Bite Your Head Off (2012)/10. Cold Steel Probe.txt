In the crack of your ass
In the crook of your arm
Eyes gone mad in the dental van
Routine check turned alien implant
Crippled with fear, they know you can hear, under their light
A flick of the switch, a twist of the wrist, your shrouded in lies
Eyes went black just before the attack
Cold Steel Probe in the crack of your ass

Torture insanity twisted academy
Fucking me destroying you

Creeping depravity, leave me for dead
Back to the needle a junkie is born again
Fuck off the lessons and fuck all your friends
Dip in the spoon and burn all your money
Cold Steel Probe in the crack of your ass

Open fire, soul destroyer take your shot
Mis-defier, truth denier, fuck you cunt
Cold Steel Probe in the crack of your ass

If the cunt steals and rips you off
Takes you for all your worth
Don't wait or you'll hesitate
From under you the earth will fade
It's the true mark of a coward
And a liar that's desperate
And lost any will or desire
