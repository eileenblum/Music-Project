There's a thorn in my side
On a spastic two-headed dragon I ride
In the wind, on a night
I choke on the smoke of the church that I light
I hear the call, I carry sin
To the house of the holy one within
I empty cans, I flick my light
Burn myself in the church tonight

There's a curse on the wind
Shit on the liver again
Scream, die
My death and my funeral combined

Born of the wisdom of the ancient ghosts
The blood of the goat and the chalice we toast
To the win and the sin, unholy Odin
There's a place where the old souls gather to boast
Of the thrill, and the spill
And the victims that they kill
If they die in the fields
Then they die at our will

Corpse in the church
The priest and the mourners evoked
In the old, cold morning light
I choke on the smoke of the church that I light

There's a curse on the wind
Shit on the liver again
Scream, die
My death and my funeral combined
