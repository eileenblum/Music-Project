Seems to be a desire for burning
The morbid, sickening truth
It's a dream but reality's turning
Manipulation to torture for you
In a blaze just to the north lay a victim in the fire
At the neighbours next door a few more
As the flames got higher front door, demon spawn
Take a plunge and dive into the fire

Twist it, Scream it, Burn it, The jury is out, a desire for burning
Seems to be a desire for burning all of you
Crawling through the ashes on your knees with blistered hands
Looking for reality but getting banned
Twist it, Scream it, Burn it, The jury is out, a desire for burning
