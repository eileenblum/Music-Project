[Narrated to the tune of a music box:]
Children... thanks very much for listening to the latest King Parrot: "Bite Your Head Off" long player. We think you should have enjoyed this... you've had a good listen, so why not pop up to your bedroom, put your jammies on, hop under the doona, and I'll be in there to read you a story in a minute, okay?
