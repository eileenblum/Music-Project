Rear control, not your hole
Evil soul, covered my pole
Blessed in stink, time to think
Can I wash off her shit
Stunning Cunning
There's no coincidence I'm in the shit
Stunning Cunning
There's no wonder no control exists
No coincidence, No innocence
When her ring just starts to drip
Stunning Cunning
She's opened up the brown abyss
