Sun in the sea, darkness bleeds
Out of the womb, you'll never be anybody
Everybody's looking for the light that don't shine

Hung over, un-sober mistreated by a brother,
Slit her throat now know one loves her
Can't reinstate it, I'll uncre-hate it
Sun in the sea
The sun no longer rises

Shape shifters are hiding
Secrets of the serpents
Revealed to be in verses
