Sliced off the bone
Corpse pig forever remembered
Hooked by the throat and the groin
The pig's on a spit roast unsevered

Tied up and held down with barbed wire in uniform [2x]

Dead in a bin
Hung by a rope
There's blood in her eye's

If pig's were like goats
They wouldn't remember forever
Tied up and held down with barb wire in uniform [2x]

Dead in a bin
Hung by rope
There's blood in her eye's
Filling the throat

If pigs were like goats they would not remember
Amnesia the key for excusing dismember

You won't see me in jail, but I'll meet you in hell [2x]
