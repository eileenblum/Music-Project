Strange disguise I covered your eyes
Lead you to a bunker underground where I hide
Slow demise
Organs on the market for an inflated price
Blood and lust, entrails and vomit and guts
Chained to a bed licking my nuts
A fiend a beast, unnatural feast
The blood, The cash, The bozo creep

Spleen kidney liver
Cash when I deliver
Cock and testes quiver
Farewell them forever

Slutting out the organs of an obsolete victim
Slutting out the organs of an overcharged walrus
Brain dead shit lip
