I'll bite your head off
If you come too close to the stage
I'll bite your head off
If you don't like what I got to say
I'll bite your head off
I like to scream saying something absurd
I'll bite your head off
If you think that we sound like a turd
I'll bite your head off

Don't think twice about a trippers reaction
Go balls out with your foot to the floor
There's no second guessing with the law of attraction
You get what you want and you take a bit more
Stressing over messing with the sensitive dude
The lesson is the stressing doesn't have any room
If you didn't get it then, then I guess you never will
Clean and sober psychopath getting off the pills
Go and don't look back
Your turn to scratch my back

Can't play nice at the metal night
You take it to the heart and then you take it to me
Macho metal monkey with the brain of a pea
I can't fuckin' fight, but I can fuckin' scream!
