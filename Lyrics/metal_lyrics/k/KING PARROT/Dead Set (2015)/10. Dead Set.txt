Step up / too afraid of consequence
Step back / too afraid of failure
seeing you tip toeing around the fringe
been you - but forever cant commit!

sick of the excuses and were sick of wasting time
no one will remember it and everything is blight
every altercation is twisted and damaged
now we shoe you hand over fist

dead set - throwing a fit
dead set - like a child regressed
dead set now we see you on the way
spoon fed - you're a dead set legend mate

dead set, Â spoon fed
dead set, Â transgress

drag it through the mud ragged, putrid
tarnish what remains, hopeful, useless
over thinking, bitter, twisted
your legacy - BLOODY AND FISTED

dead set, Â spoon fed
dead set, Â transgress
you're a dead set legend mate

lacking the spine
dead set- don't give two fucks for the truth
dead set- holding you up for the proof

{garbled 'strayan...}

M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M

it's all too much-I must combust-been trying to forever
