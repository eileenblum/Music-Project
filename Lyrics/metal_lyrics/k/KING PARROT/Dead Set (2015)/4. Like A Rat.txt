Like a Rat - Squirming through the sewers
Sliding through the cracks
Rat on Crack â Well off track
Always in attack
Canât hide the teeth, canât hide the eyes
Canât hide the tail or wear a disguise

Like a brat â Your spoilt rotten
Out conniving on the smack
Dirty deeds are not forgotten
Smoke screens are in effect
The recurring pattern
Like deja vous
This living breathing nightmare
Itâs haunting you
Canât hide the smell â of your distinguished ass
Cos youâre a rat and everybody knows it

Rat! - Fucking! - Rat! - Shit heel! - Rat! - Rat! - Behind Your Back
