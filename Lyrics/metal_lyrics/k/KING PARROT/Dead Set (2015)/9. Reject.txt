we need a replacement
it's time to face it
systems failed
liars and traitors
cant afford to keep it real
shortcuts here for you to steal
couldn't do it, wouldn't try
live like that, don't comply

reject hypocrisy
reject complacency

uphold some legacy
We've been schooled and burnt
we will come and smash and wreck
did it before and always have
never fall for copycat tricks
never fall if it ain't legit
been too long of hearing your rap
been too long were over it

you're con-fused
an imbecile is on the loose
are you confused?
we re-ject YOU

reject hypocrisy
we've been schooled and burnt
we don't comply to that weasel twit
we don't comply to those arrogant pricks

you're con-fused
an imbecile is on the loose
are you confused?
we re-ject YOU
you're con-fused
an imbecile is on the loose
are you confused?
we re-ject YOU

reject hypocrisy
we've been schooled and burnt
we don't comply to that weasel twit
we don't comply to those arrogant pricks

over the infringements andÂ 
the warnings and the fines
is it an inconvenience to open your eyes

reject hypocrisy
we've been schooled and burnt
we don't comply to that weasel twit
we don't comply to those arrogant pricks

reject hypocrisy
reject complacency
refuse
REJECT
