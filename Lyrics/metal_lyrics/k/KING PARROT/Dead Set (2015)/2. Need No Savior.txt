Need No Savior
fucking/ruthless
deceptive intrusion
I must confess/I'm not impressed
full of darkness
and unbelief

Chucking a tantrum and scraping
through life on its own
Proudly admitted defeat
I am raw to the bone
ploughing the punishment
cycle repeats unresolved

ITS THE WILL THAT IS RUNNING

Diseaser, Compulsive man-demon
I must reject- I must confess
full of darkness
and unbelief

blowing the piston yet adding
a string to the bow
living and breathing now dying
to fail and dissolve
Exceeding the limits of life
that were set out before

DEFEATED THE ROTTED OUT CORE

Giving into this disease
Defeated now claiming relief
Impending doom
needing no savior for truth

Need no savior
Diseased, Desired, Denounce
Wheres your savior now?
Diseased, Desired, Denounce
need no savior

It conquered me, was raving in
was falling down
Beating me Beating you
Inverted crown
Start again, stop againÂ 
raving in, token dread
Picked it up, Put it in
BLEEDING OUT THE VEINS AGAIN
Let it go, ripped it up
PUT YOU IN THE BIN
Picked it up, Put it in
BLEEDING OUT THE VEINS AGAIN

Flushing defences diminish the god
Neglecting the savior ignoring the scold
The more that we read it the more that we know
Still scraping, and bleeding, the KNEES

Fucking your chances ofÂ 
getting yourself to the goal
Self-satisfaction is easier
than getting reward
The harder its working the
more you're confused and absolved

GIVING INTO THIS DISEASE
Need No Savior
