ravenous/ominous/entirely ready-devour it
irreverent /ferocious/ over empowered to revere it
severance / seances /only the evil encompasses

deceit/ distrust/ overpowered by blood lust
stalking/the predator/waiting, watching over it
disastrous / murderous/ only desire to finish it

when tomorrow turns to blood

a ravaging bison / a water moccasin Â /king is the oxen /the beast is toxic
the shadows call/ the king and eyes/ Immortal owl/ is trying to hide

blood is building up around your eyes/
the pressure starts to build inside your mind
a creature in the shadows turns a neck/
head erupts a paramount threat

sending astral bodies to the sky
observant of a body from a height
a creature in the shadows eating flesh
tomorrow turns to blood eternal rest

the clock is ticking back a bit
the flesh is gone host escapes
rabid dog asphyxiate
grinding you against the grain

weeping, bleeding, screaming,Â 
when tomorrow turns to bloodÂ
