preconceived / idea in place
here we listen / hear your pain

out on the deck / shovelling shit
right here now we have the chance
I'm all ears and you're all tongue
buy you out if you will walk

Been pleading silence
it's coming this way
the punishers got
something to say

all for nothing Â / all shall suffer
you spit in my face / thank you fucker

give it, give it - it's a one way street
take it or leave it - choice is obsolete
I'm all ears and you're all talk

your royal highness / fork pitched tongue
been talking smack / try n knock me off
All for nothing / all must suffer
there's shit on your face
I hear you stutter

give it, give it - it's a one way street
take it or leave it - choice is obsolete
I'm all ears and you're all talk
Â I'M-ALL-EARS-AND-YOU'RE-ALL-TALK

Punisher - live it, breathe it
Punisher - wont back downÂ 
Punisher - pissing me off
Punisher - pushing it out

You're a Punisher

all care zero Â 
zone it out
dribbling shit
out of the mouth
you're all tears, and I'm all balk
take my time and off i walk
YOU'RE-ALL-TEARS-AND-I'M-ALL-BALK

you're a punisher

it's madness timeÂ 
were tired and sick
crucified
the punisher wins
