Rusted-Hook in the spine
old blunt knife cuts a chunk in the hide
Out in the cold-Out in the dark
Seclusion, Disillusion till were giving it up
Hooks in the flesh, hung from the back
levitating body hangs from chains in the legs
Tortured, beatings, Pussy and smut
just cant get enough

Bringing it home
Bust a nut
Hospital bed
All sick in the head

Lusting- cant give up
Thrusting-Piercing the gut
Sodomy's best, never a rest
At it again, swelling up head
stab it, break it, covered in blood
Just cant get enough

Sick, twisted and bent
All sick in the head
Drained, bleeding, undead
All sick in the head

Don't trust- its too fucked up
try to escape- but you're shit out of luck
Hospital Bed, sick in the head
Suspended from the ceiling with a rope around the neck
Hooks in the flesh, hung from the back
Levitating body hangs from chains in the legs
Tortured, Beatings, call me a slut
Just cant get enough

Sick, twisted and bent
All sick in the head
Drained, bleeding, undead
All sick in the head
