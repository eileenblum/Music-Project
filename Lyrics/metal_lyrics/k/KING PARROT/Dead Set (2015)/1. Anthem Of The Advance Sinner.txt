this is it
this is everything
is it all you ever wantedÂ 
is it all you'll ever needÂ 
now you're here
now you've seen
life is such a tragedy and it will always be
forever it will be

got you painted in the corner
fix the needle
tend to boner
scratch the surface
cant look deeper
pissed your pants
denial keeper

anthem of the advanced sinner
fuck you we never were winners
anthem of the advanced sinner
fuck you we never were winners
a song for us
you can get fucked

Anthem of the advanced sinner
anthem of the advanced sinner
Anthem of the advanced sinner
its all too much I must combust
been trying to forever
I push and shove and get it out
but all is doomed for failure
get it right and get it wrong and
burn out to no end
were compelled to give you hell
its only getting better

Anthem, anthem, anthem
its all too much I must combust
been trying to forever
I push and shove and get it out
but all is doomed for failure
get it right and get it wrong and
burn out to no end
Anthem of the advanced sinner
