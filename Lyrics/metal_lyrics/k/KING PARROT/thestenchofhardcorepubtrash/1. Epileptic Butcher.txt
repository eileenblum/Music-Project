Spent ammunition breeding surgical precision
It's the mess this recession delivers
Have you wondered what would come of it if you told them to go shove it,
If you knew it was this you wouldn't love it
If you knew it was this you wouldn't love it

The old curse came out from the cold
Too bold, but not enough soul
Profits bigger now, smaller bleaker town,
Empty pockets are the final figure

Don't bother counting it twice,
There's a price on the tag of life,
Big pack bunch mentality,
Does a butcher take a stake or a knife?

For your life, comin' twice, and it's on you!
Heavy disgusting, just do what the slut did
Charming, disabled, innocently unstable
