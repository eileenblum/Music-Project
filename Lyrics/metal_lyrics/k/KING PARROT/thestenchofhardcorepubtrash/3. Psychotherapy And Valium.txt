Servant!

It's becoming a rage,
False god, turned ape
Bring me the pipe, show me the hate,
In an obvious misdirection

Second coming, Jesus running,
In a world not made for you,
Second coming, Jesus running,
In a world not made for you,
In a world not made for you,
This world's not made for two

Shit fight in a cage, bar-mitzvah, Bahrain!
Flying higher, stoke the fire,
Release the hounds of the failed empire!

If there was a problem you don't need
That's reality! Psychotherapy &amp; some valium!
If there was a problem you don't need
That's reality! Psychotherapy &amp; some valium!

Psychotherapy &amp; some valium!
Psychotherapy &amp; some valium!
Psychotherapy &amp; some valium!

Swerving the mould, I've been here before, I'm coming for more
Too much is new, I'd rather be dead, than hear your shit!

Psychotherapy &amp; some valium!
Psychotherapy
