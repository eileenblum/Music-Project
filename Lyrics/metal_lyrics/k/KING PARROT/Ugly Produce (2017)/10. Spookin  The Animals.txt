Now that Deer in Headlight sees the indifferent blasphemy
Fear comes on in waves
Electric crowd of brain-dead slaves all...
Staring down with Ghoulish eyes addicted to this Pantomime
Disconnected dead
Same monster different head...
No one seems to see there is no new delivery
Same rods at your neck
Never knew it was there...
Spike and spawn
The 'Meat Head Stick' beaten over the scone with it
Cold shower burns like fire
Wipe that shit eating grin
This place is a mental case
A Salem's mob
The kin kick back and stay on track
Or you'll end up in the bin
Don't end up in the bin!
Hear the voice inside my brain
Spooked the animals again
Capable, culpable
The harder things can't be ignored
Late to the banquet
Late to the feast
Glued to the mirror
Feeding the beast
