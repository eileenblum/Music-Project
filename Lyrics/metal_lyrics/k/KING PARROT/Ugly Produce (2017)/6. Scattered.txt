Done the job
Cooked the life
Skerrick's in the bag
Blast them in the main
It's a sign
An epidemic
Eating through the brain like a flesh hungry maggot
Laboratory ice house
Sacrificial bastards leaves you in the streets with a pick and dirty habit
Make you disappear like a magician with a rabbit
It's an easy thing to do
A glass barbecue
Get it on the streets
Get it when in need
Rehabilitation with a mental health disease
Scattered disease of the mind
Scattered imbecile infiltration the hive
Blast it
Plastered
Manipulated
Dead beat arse wipe
Secured the fence
Built high just around the paranoid
Compound voluntary lab rats sucking on a crack pipe
It's an easy thing to do
A glass barbecue
Get it on the streets
Get it when in need
Hospitalization with your punctured battered veins
Blast it
Plastered
Watch you die
Watch you die
Dead Beat arse wipe
