Indulge in solvent abuse
Space cadets with smudged tattoos
Never try to keep it real
Fake smile, fake laugh, fake feel
All hail the grub
Ruin everything you touch
All hail the grub
Step right in and cut my lunch
Dispatch the verbal abuse
Bleached assholes not worse than you think
I need to hear your quip
I think I could do without it
All hail the grub
The only one to get it done
Turn your back and lick my sack
The grubs on an all out attack!
Stumbling through the depths
Where I dwell in my resistance
Fighting for survival
Your toxic ways gone viral!
All hail the grub, all hail the scum.
