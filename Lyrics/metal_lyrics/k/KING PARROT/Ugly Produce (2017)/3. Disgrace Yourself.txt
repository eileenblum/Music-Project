First up the little babbling cunt
The dribbling runt
The whining little dancer with the unfounded front on camera
Fake slander
I'm in the gutter
Can't get any lower
Bring you down
Fuck your pointless protest
Ruptured all function
Those heist filled delusions
Break your spirit then delete it
Then repeat it
Disgrace yourself
Next up entitled gump hand out
Running the mouth
Scraping at the barrel, fucking idiots
Unraveling
Lining all your pockets from the sheep
Herd mentality
Lining all your pockets from the sheep
Herd mentality
Disgrace yourself
No shame in deceit
Disgrace yourself
Comes so naturally
Lining all your pockets
From the sheep
Herd mentality
Scraping at the barrel.
Fucking idiots
Unraveling hordes of the fledgling
Ripe for the picking
Wrong for the reason all churning.
Disgrace yourself!
