In the trench of freedom
Shovel dirt back in mediocrity
Ploughed from within
Blatant miss stipulation right beneath your nose
Those scrambled premonitions
All wrongly infused
Impaled through a fence
Dominated salt of the earth
Crooked and cursed salt of the earth
No apology
Salt of the earth
Now it strokes the frenzy
Younger and wiser
At odds with your aging mind
Can't fix old business
This positive motions moves forward
Delivers ignoring ignorance
Hate speak relentless
Driving the detention engine
Trapped and defenceless
Old thorn regrowth
Heritage resown
Dumber and blinder
Never the wise now
Adept contently
Ludicious
Short sighted vision
So meek and dubious
