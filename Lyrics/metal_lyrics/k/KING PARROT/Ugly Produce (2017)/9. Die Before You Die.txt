Blood-filled eyes
A dangling noose
A whimpering dog
Put your head through
Biting the curb
Smashing the teeth
Not enough blood in the world
You could bleed
Smashed in the eyes
Kicked in the teeth
Not enough blood
You could bleed once too often
Straight off the cuff
Veiling and scorned
Enough in enough
Driving it through every new avenue
Die before you die
My fuse is blown
Can't be rewired
Die before you die
Can't break what is broken
I've already expired
Can't break what is broken
I am ready
Die before you die
All scuppered up
Can't deliver the wants top to the bottom
It's all back to the front
Deaden the blow
Wiping the hands
Fighting for nothing
Draining the sand
Die before you die
