Find a side that's brighter than bad
Stick it out but never get mad
No control,
No plans
Ten pounds of shit in a five pound bag

It never gives, not what you want
Falling short just defining my sort
Scared to fail scared of success
Never take less
Is this really what you want?
Don't aim too high or they'll cut you right back
Feel like ten pounds of shit in a five pound bag

Keep them dumb, keep them numb, keep them ripped
Paid the money then they syphon the slip
Think your flying but they're bluffing the hand
An empty promise from a selfish brat

Every lesson that's ever been taught
Never learn comes undone just as quick it's learnt
Told to trust, surrounded by a system of fraud
Doused in gas, set on fire now watch me burn
