Attack look for no ending as they will suffer for you descend
The sun is turned into darkness down into the depths of hell
Lay the ones who have slew atone for death by death

This boundless earth has no beginning only destruction that has no ending
Rotting in our existence mutilation of a different kind
The utter end of mortal man has been set upon us all
This is the art of decay atone for death by death
