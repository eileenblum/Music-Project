I lost me love a long time ago in the lands of tragedy no one can barely see
As the maiden fell into the arms of hypocrisy it shall be my final will of revenge
Wrath in my fists bloodshed on my mind taken was she the one to be the last
The wage of battle has commenced give me my favoured weapon as I shall have my vengeance

With force my blade flows through the flesh again the last raid it will be the final test
On the earth the crimson corpses in their path they have fallen fallen by my sword lie amidst victorious
