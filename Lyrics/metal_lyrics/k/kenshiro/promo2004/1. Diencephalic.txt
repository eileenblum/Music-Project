Ventricles flowing blood for blood the thirst the hunger
Vampiric lust for ones survival controlled emotions the thirst the hunger
Sleep sleep my love

Taste the wine of tyranny the flow of deprivation
She has awaken brought into a new life a life full of evil and death
The virus can not be defeated taking its prey one by one
Hunting and feeding until there is none the thirst the hunger
