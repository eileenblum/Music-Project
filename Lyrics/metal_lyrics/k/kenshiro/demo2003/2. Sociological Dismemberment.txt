Decades lost in oblivion past lives never remembered death awaits us all
This vulture red with blood has disembarked a quest unbidden by your soul
Tear to rags your carrion feasting in fury on the blackened heart
Cancer falls in midst of black seas venture through as the smoke solidifies
Crestfallen oculus epidermal deformity unbidden, by your soul

No strength left to go on as you fall down to your knees
Laying in a pool of your own vomit the vulture has arrived
The grave has been dug the ceremony has begun never again will you see the sight
