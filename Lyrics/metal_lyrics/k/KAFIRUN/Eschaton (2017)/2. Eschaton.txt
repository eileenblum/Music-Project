Larvae!

Guides this mortal form
To divinity! Nucleus has began diminishing
In entropy
Through me twilight's gleaming
Cell by cell poisoning
Everything left
We are as one
The beast that never sleeps
Gloria letum exegesis
A passage to chaos
The void that ends lights voyage
Gloria letum in excelsis
Through me the beckoning wail commences
Gloria letum in excelsis
I have become
All life final breath
The moment that ends all moments
In ecstasy return in to his vastness.
