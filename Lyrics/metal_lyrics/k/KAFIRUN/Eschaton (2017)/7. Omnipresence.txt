Shining one, the adversary

Self-manifesting forbidden light!
Revealer of hidden virtues
Defiler of the divine deception!
Neither matter nor spirit
No desire, thought, word or action
Without form, without resemblance
The nameless being
Illusions emanate from within
Life and death wrapped within as vessels.
Drifting in encompassing emptiness for eternity
So above, so below and
Within the primordial cosmic realms
Fertilizing the wretched womb of creation
The boundaries of vision become clear
The limitations of time disappear
