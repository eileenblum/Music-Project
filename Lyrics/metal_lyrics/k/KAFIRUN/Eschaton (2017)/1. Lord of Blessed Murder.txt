Lord of blessed murder

The virgin soil blackened by the blood of Abel
Oh fire crowned Cain
The guardian of the emerald flame
He who travels freely in
In the shadow of the mighty dead
He who dwells in the bowels of black earth
King of all cemeteries
Unbound is your imperishable spirit
Transcending all finite limitations
Your enlightenment ends the illusion of life
Master of the kingdom of bones
Your burial mounds have blossomed
The sweet fruits of death
Hail the blessed and cursed dead
