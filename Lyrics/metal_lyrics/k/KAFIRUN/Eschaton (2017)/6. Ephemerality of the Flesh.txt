Brightest light of day

Darkest night of madness
I began with nihility
Abundance that seeks union with emptiness
Nothingness and profusion
Infinity spiraling
Omission recoiling
The life be gone
To where no life began
And shall never be
The life be damned
To where no consciousness expands
Warmth escaping the blood
And the blood escapes
This feeble shell
From impurity
Disciple of diminishing gods
