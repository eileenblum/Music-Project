I am the black radiance

The space between the nothing and remains,
A cancer speaking unto itself,
Is the nothingness I became
And mastered alone
Speak through me oh Lord
Summoned by death
To the nothingness life restrained
Unanswered
The only deity to show it face
And I answered alone.
Now speak through me oh Lord
Time release me
And I release you
With self removed
Into me, he grew
Awaiting
Time release me and I release death
Unto you all
And through me a god spoke.
