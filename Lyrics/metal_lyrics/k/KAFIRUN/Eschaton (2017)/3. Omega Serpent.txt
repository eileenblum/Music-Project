The serpent monarch

Encircled by flame
The fires of life subdued
To extinguish
Insipid and immeasurable empty kismet
Born to be disjointed
Broken Ouroboros!
The astral light has traveled to its precipice
An infinity to reach an end
No longer eclipsed by matter
Make silent the cosmic pulse
Hidden knowledge has countless voices
The cosmos crumbles as they speak
Tearing tail from tongue and tooth
Omega serpent
