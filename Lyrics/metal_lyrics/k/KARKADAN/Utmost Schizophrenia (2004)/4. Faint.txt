The agony of deceiving light haunts me
my torn soul is yearning for the dawn

All the sorrows are drowned in sadness
Tears of mourning will never run dry

My death is closer now than ever
My heart is black of infernal fire
Glimpsing shadows fall unto the dark
I follow the path of ultimate freedom

Taste the red stream of sorrow
Drink the tears off my eyes

My grace has fallen to ashes
My pride has turned to dust
Please take my fear away
... Take my pain away

My death is closer now than ever
My heart is black of bloodred fire
Crimson shadows fall unto the dark
I follow my path to ultimate freedom

The agony of deceiving light haunts me
My torn soul is yearning
All sorrows are drowned in sadness
Tears of mourning will never run dry

It feels like I'm dying
I'm dying
