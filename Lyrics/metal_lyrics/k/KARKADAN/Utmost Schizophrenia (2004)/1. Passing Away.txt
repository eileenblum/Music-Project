A ray of light falls into this cell
Landscapes hidden by these walls
The world outside is moving
Stones are flowing to the ground
A scheme from outside
Isolated by this loneliness
A cold breeze is passing - weeping memories

Secretly tears were cried
But quickly wept away - shadow-like thoughts
To camouflage all anxieties
Silence surrounds the world

Secretly tears were cried
But quickly wept away - shadow-like thoughts
To camouflage all anxieties
Penetrating memories - passing away

Twisted, hunted but still alone
Prud, lonesome but torn apart
Widows drowning in the sand
That keeps flowing through their fingers

A ray of light - was kept outside
Landscapes do not exist

Everything seems to blur
A part of this loneliness
The world stopped moving
Stones cover all the sky

A scheme has been discarded
A warm breeze softly on the skin
Long forgotten memories - coming back to mind
Dreaming in hopelessness
Standing with proud honour

Silence surrounds the world
Penetrating memories - passing away
