You know, I'm a loyal one 
I have served you well 
Now I have to brake the rules 
I like this girl more than hell 

Sorry Lord, but I feel love 
I'm on cloud nine 
quite above of 
you 

She's got such shiny hair 
her face - pale - she's looking good 
I think it is quite fair 
Don't touch her sweet blood 

Sorry Lord, but I feel love 
I'm on cloud nine 
quite above of 
you 

Sorry Lord, but I feel love 
I'm on cloud nine 
quite above of 
you 

I will fight for my love 
And Lord, I still love you ! 
My Ablaze

I enflame myself with prayer 
Never finding the answer 
For living at one's will 
But you found another ...
