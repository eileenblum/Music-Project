In the dark of the night 
I rise off my bed 
First I see the stars 
Then the moon - is full 

I walk around throughout the night 
But I don't recognize 
It is the ce-me-ta-ry 

I see the grave of my father 
I begin to dig it up 
Got the rotten bones 
Crack 'em - burn the SOUL 

I walk around throughout the night 
But I don't recognize 
It is the ce-me-ta-ry 

Crosses - candles in the wind 
My sleep is deep 
No chance to wake me up 
That would kill ME ! 

I walk around throughout the night 
But I don't recognize 
It is the ce-me-ta-ry
