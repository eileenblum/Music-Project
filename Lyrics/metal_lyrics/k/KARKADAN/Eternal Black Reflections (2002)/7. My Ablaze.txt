A thing that should be secret 
Saved by the hands of death 
Calling souls and demons 
By using your last breath 
Ablaze the light with darkness 

Powers will turn upon 
But they may revenge 
And if your cast should ever fail 
Break not will nor mercy 
Let the sword rest for eternity 

For eternity 

Nevertheless you cannot escape 
'Cause it's war against time 
Don't worry about your flesh 
But take care of your spirit 
Take care
