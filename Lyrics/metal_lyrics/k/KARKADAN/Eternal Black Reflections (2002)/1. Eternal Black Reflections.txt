Eternal blackness in the sky 
Shining for murder 
Air tasting of blood and decay 
Of death 

The empire is rising 

White shadows fall apart 
Fading into darkness 

Time turns to eternity 
Secrets of death force their way up from the deep 

The unholy hordes leave the abyss for the final battle. 

The might of insanity 
Reaches out for humanity 
To kill 

The mirror reflecting the minds of men 
Shows eternal wastelands 

Hope is vanishing for sheer terror 
That is to come 

Black eternally
