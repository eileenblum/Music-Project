Walking through forrests 
as the light goes dim 
He feels so strange 
and looks behind him 

Silence everywhere 
A scream breakes through the night 
Without knowing where to go 
He wanders through the dark 

Can you hear the calling evil ? 
Can you feel its magic spell ? 
Seduced by the darkest powers 
You will give your soul away 

A lightning strikes 
And cracks up the earth 
Now it's time 
For hells' rebirth 

Dark Angels 
Rising from below 
He's not afraid 
Follows the way they show 

Meeting Scheitan 
His mind was changed 
He's still alive 
But his soul is dead
