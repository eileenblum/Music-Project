It's me in the dark 
I'm alone in the cold 
I'm so depressed 
In the corner 
I feel afraid to die 
I want you 

The corner is red 
Of my suicide 
Now that I'm gone 
I want you again 

But I know it's not true 
You have to go to join death, too 
Die to love 
Die to love 

This is my requiem of yearning 

[the girl:]
I will never miss you 
Between you and me 
There's only emptiness 
Memories will remain 
But they are left behind 

My soul fades away 
Into loneliness 
Into the deep 
What is left is my body 
That never rests 

My love never rests 

Never rust in peace 
Never 
Never forget 
Never 
Never dream 
Never 
Never rest 
Never 
Never love 
Never
