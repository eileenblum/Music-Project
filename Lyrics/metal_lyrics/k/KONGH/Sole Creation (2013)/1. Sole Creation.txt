Born out of common blood
Behind iron raised abomination

A creation who can't be controlled
Casting darkness upon other souls
No one envisioned any of this kind
Now the savage is starting to rise

Sole creation

Blank static eyes of cold
Reaching our debts
Altering the ways
Withdrawing the sense of tranquility

A creation who can't be controlled
Casting darkness upon other souls
As the fiend has grown much too strong
Queen of wilderness shudders in qualm

Concealed ancestry came to show
Exposed our inner growth we didn't know
This fragment of disease can't remain
The horror of this one must leave

This lust
This fear
This rage is hard to resist
This lust
This fear
This rage conquers my will

Sole creation

Suddenly awake
In a new place
Locked up in chains
Apart from existence
Trapped in nothing

A creation with no control
Of the darkness into which it was born
Where he's going he'll realize

Back to emptiness

Oh lord, spare me this moment
How come you brought me this betrayal
The void surrounding me makes me see
This place is where it ends for me
