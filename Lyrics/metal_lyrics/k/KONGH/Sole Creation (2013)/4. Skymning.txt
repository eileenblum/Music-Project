Enclosed in a cloud shielding the outside off
Dreaming of all that could have tied us both
Brought up to find that we had lost it all
Set out to stroll cut off from devotion

Gone from the haven
Made to rely on unsteady ground
It hurts to open the eyes
Facing the twilight that followed our time
