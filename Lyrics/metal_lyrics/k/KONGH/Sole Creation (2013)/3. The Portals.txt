Paralyzing forces from beyond
Moving through the air above
Nebulous sorcerer of aberration
Fabricates a twisted realm

Seems right
Flooded by instincts
Feels wrong
Peace is submissive

Pendulum of dejection
The master of delusion
The portals inhales all matter of lucid vision

Contemplating takes up most of my time
Memorizing every line
Theories reshaping on their own
Driven by a hidden force

When all is said
When all is done
Why am I still
Not able to move on
