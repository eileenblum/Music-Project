What are you keeping, Keeper of the cemetery?
Tell me, blessed by the devil creatures
And the gravedigger, who will be buried by...
Who will be buried by?

And the Woman who cries over the death of her son
Who will mourn over her?
And the gravedigger, who will be buried by...
Who will be buried by?
And his dreadful pains - which harvester will pick
them in?
You, black crow, how long you'll be cawing so ugly?
Whose soul you want to take off more,
If mine is not enough...

What are you keeping, Keeper of the cemetery?
Keep away Gaustine from Arl
And the gravedigger, who will be buried by:
Who will be buried by?

And these tears of pain - which martyr will pour them?
Where are you going, with this black cassock
And this cross, on which you're resting,
Who is it for, tell me who's for
What are you keeping, Keeper of the cemetery?
And the gravedigger, who will be buried by?

Who's going to take away his soul,
Which Moon is to shine for him?
I'll bury him, I'll mourn for him,
I'll throw the light upon his grave,
And I'll take his soul
