At the nightskirts of the of the Devil's ruled land
Darkness' been here all along
With his Spirit awakened by deadly silence
Gazing eyes and awesome stare of ruins
He was ruling over all cursed souls

Beyond the darkness scorched wilderness
Was giving souls as sacrifice of spirit
From the depths of the Abyss
Remorseless voice was booming through the hearts...
I am your Well-doer!
I am the Black Wizard and the Ruler of the Abyss
My power hunts ahead like nearing Death

There from the ground were slowly growing
The Seeds of Evil
From the depths of the Abyss remorseless voice
Was booming through the hearts... I am your Well-doer!

Hellfire outlines the silhouette of Pentagram
And following our shadows,
Doomed to Eternity we'll float along Infinity forever
