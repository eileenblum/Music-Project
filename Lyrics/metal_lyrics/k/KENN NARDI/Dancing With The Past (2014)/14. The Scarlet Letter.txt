Through prideful darkness the blind will lead the blind
All bound in colored fetters
Never knowing, never learning, never caring, 
Understanding what's at stake
Upon this world a letter
Written coldly and without shame in the blood of so many
Brandished boldly, the burned and maimed
Big Pharma's whore red-robed in gore would kill you
To heal you

Through greed the reckless, though sworn to never harm, 
Ignore all repercussions
Never showing, never feeling, overbearing
She denies the aftermath
Upon her breast a letter
Bought and sold she has no choice but to obey her master
Left alone now they have no voice
Big Pharmaâs whore with rotten core would kill you
To heal you

First, do no harmâ¦
First do no harm...first!
Written coldly and without shame in the blood of so many
Brandished boldly, the burned and maimed
Big Pharmaâs whore red-robed in gore would kill you to heal you
Sheâll kill you to heal you

First, do no harmâ¦ First, do no harmâ¦

First, do no harmâ¦
First, do no harmâ¦first!
