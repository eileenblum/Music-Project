The worst laid plans of rats and men will always go astray
They come crashing down 'neath their own weight
To crush their feet of clay
In bold defiance, with blinding lust to reign
This dark alliance lays brick upon brick in vain

Bring peace through war, just as before
To feed the beast they bow before
Through vanity's insanity they'll drag us all to ruin
When there's one world then they've won this world

The best intent of deceitful men will only lead astray
They fit the weak with blinders bleak
Led through the slaughter gate
In bold defiance, with blinding lust to reign
This dark alliance lays brick upon brick in vain

Bring peace through war just as before
To feed the beast they bow before
Through vanity's insanity they'll drag us all to ruin
When there's one world then they've won this world

Bring peace through war just as before
To feed the beast they bow before
Through vanity's insanity they'll drag us all to ruin 
Then there's one world then they've won this world 
When there's one world they've won this world
One world...
