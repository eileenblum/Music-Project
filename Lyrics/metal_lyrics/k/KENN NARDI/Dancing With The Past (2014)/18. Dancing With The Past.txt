Looking on, I see the stance
As you strain at the lifts and turns
Not at peace, no release from this beast
To which you're saddled even now
This weariness, a sentenced life 
As you gaze into eyes long dead 
You remand by a strand
Icy hands with which you grapple
In a rhythm without a flow

One and a two and a three and a four
The cue that is calling you back
You lead and you follow and stumble again
The meter and tempo are lost
You're dancing with the past

This heaviness, you drag along as you trip just to step in time
Healing slow, tears will flow,
Letting go is half the battle to be won
You dwell in tombs among the dead, you breathe this air diseased
Feeling used, deeply bruised, so confused
You're stunned and rattled by the pacing and by the tune

One and a two and a three and a four
The cue that is calling you back
You lead and you follow and stumble again
The meter and tempo are lost
You're dancing with the past

You dwell in tombs among the dead, you breathe this air diseased
Feeling used, deeply bruised, so confused
You're stunned and rattled by the pacing and by the tune
