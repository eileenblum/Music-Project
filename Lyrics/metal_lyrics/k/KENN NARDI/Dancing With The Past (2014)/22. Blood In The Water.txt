They're carving a circle, all fins and teeth
Their eyes on the living, sites set beneath
They swiftly attack, pulling and tearing with sharp words of "concern" 
In blue and in black, the skin you are wearing removed with each turn 
They smell blood in the waterâ¦there's death in the air

They're racing in circles so high overhead
Slow-dragging their shadows through fields of the dead
In tandem they dive, slashing and pulling from the sick and the weak 
Barely alive and dragging your carcass, you curse through your teeth 
They smell blood in the waterâ¦there's death in the air

Hands bitten, hard written, they listen for signs of life 
Not hidden, greed-smitten, eyes quicken to see the end 
Buried before you are dead
Broken by those you have fed Ashamed of the ones you have bred 
Who bathe in the wealth you have bled

They swiftly attack, pulling and tearing
With sharp words of "concern"
In blue and in black, the skin you are wearing
Removed with each turn
Blood in, blood in the water, water
There's death in, death in the air

Hands bitten, hard written, they listen for signs of life 
Not hidden, greed-smitten, eyes quicken to see the end 
Buried before you are dead
Broken by those you have fed
Ashamed of the ones you have bred
Who bathe in the wealth you have bled
