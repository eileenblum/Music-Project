Soulless golems lumber slow...within them nothing
Just passive and stiff
Through wretched methods driven frantic
Happily over the cliff
Tell me...have you nothing inside you repulsed by the sight? 
Tell me...have you nothing that stirs you to fight?
'Cause Iâm sailing against the tide lest I drift away
And theyâll strain the frayed if only to mold us...

Heartless carcasses ruin all around them
With only the stench of decay
Their harmless, armless gropings reach for nothing
Still nothing dissuades
Tell me...have you nothing inside that recoils at the thought? 
Tell me...have you nothing that grieves as it ought?
And Iâm swimming against the tide lest Iâm washed away
And theyâll strain the frayed if only to mold us...
To break us 'til we're numb

Even in these halls where we walk about
We talk about only shadows
We never let it show that we're racked with doubt and we don't look down
Hide all we know, our sorrow in towâ¦ 
We hold down a sure frown each day And weâre strained and frayed
But still we will mock them in shame...

And Iâm rushing against the wind lest Iâm blown away
âcause theyâll strain the frayed if only to mold us...
To break us 'til we're numb

Even in these halls where we walk about
We talk about only shadows
We never let it show that we're racked with doubt
And we don't look down â¦
Even in these halls where we walk about
We talk about only shadows
We never let it show that we're racked with doubt and we don't look down
Hide all we know, our sorrow in towâ¦
We hold down a sure frown each day
And weâre strained and frayed, yes weâre strained and frayed
But still we will mock them in shame...
