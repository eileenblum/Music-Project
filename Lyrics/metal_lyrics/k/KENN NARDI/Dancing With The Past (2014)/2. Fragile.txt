It's always is near me, whispering in my ear
It's sinister musings feeding the fear
This blanket of worry is draped 'cross my back
Surrounding me daily in silent attack

Outgrow this fragile shell, Tear down this self-made cell
Let go of this fragile shell, Let go and bid farewell

Its warnings belying all rational thought
Believing the danger far more than I ought
Digging in deeply until they are caught
And feeding the panic the peace I have sought

Outgrow this fragile shell, Tear down this self-made cell
Let go of this fragile shell, Let go and bid farewell

To the doubt, to the dread, To this Vexation
To the pain, To distress, To the fixation
To the hurt, disarray, from these sensations
To the strain that distorts... To this hell...

Abdication to ruination accentuating the small
Imagination and aberration feed speculation that overcomes all

Imagination and aberration feed speculation that overcomes all
Abdication to ruination accelerating my fall...my fall

Outgrow this fragile shell, Tear down this self-made cell
Let go of this fragile shell, Let go and bid farewell

To the doubt, To the dread, To this Vexation
To the pain, To distress, To the fixation
To the hurt, disarray, from these sensations
To the strain that distorts... To this hell...
