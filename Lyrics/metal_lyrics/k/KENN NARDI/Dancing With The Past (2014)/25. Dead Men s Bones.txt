I've seen the hearts of men through the eyes of god
And what's living there is darker than we care to recognize
We've heard the word of god from the mouths of men
But what's deep within, âneath our hidden sin is cold, unmoved

Too few new...far-fallen and apart from the giver of life
Faux-piousness for righteousness
Behind the gleaming, only white-washed tombs
All full of dead men's bones

I've seen the hearts of men through the eyes of god
And what's living there is dead
We've heard the word of god from the mouths of men
Has what's deep within, âneath our hidden sin, metastasized?

Too few new...far-fallen and apart from the giver of life
Faux-piousness for righteousnessâ¦
Behind the gleaming, only white-washed tombs
All full of dead men's bones

In pride he presents himself draped in filth and rags 
The killer within him lurks where the blind fool brags 
He swaggers through ruins pristine
All full of dead men's bones
The liar deceives himself, condemns himself 
Woe! To all who lean upon their own stance 
Woe! Who sway upon the sand unbalanced

I've seen the hearts of men through the eyes of god
And what's deep within,
âNeath our hidden sin is mortified

Too few new...
Far-fallen and apart from the giver of life
Faux-piousness for righteousness
Behind the gleaming, only white-washed tombs
All full of dead men's bones
Faux-piousness for righteousness
Behind the gleaming, only white-washed tombs
All full of dead men's bones
