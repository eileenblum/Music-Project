They groom their own, pass learned keys to palaces of ivory
On academic schemes, they're weaned unseen
Where from high atop their towers tall
It's easy to look down on all
Like promised seed, they bleed conceit
And dream of all the future brings

Out of reach, untouchable
From empty heads with bellies full
They pull the strings to preen the lesser class
They whisper words, infallible, from behind walls unscalable
The silenced wills amassedâ¦
The minds theyâve killed will feed our future screams

So out of reach, so out of touch
So out of reach, so out of touch

The bully-whip, unchallenged voice 
Unquestioned hold, the crutch of choice 
Without dissent the circumvent the truth 
They disseminate and they dispense 
Whatâs valued less than worthlessness
All fodder for the tyrants they recruit to mold our future

So out of reach, so out of touch
So out of reach, so out of touch
