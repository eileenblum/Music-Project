I burn slow... I feel so cold inside, near paralyzed
This frame groans
This rage grows, glows inside... Bright alive
But even as I'm standing here now
It's like I'm not of this time
And even as you sit by my side i know we're not of one mind

I guess the less that's said the better
I feel afraid I'll lose control
Of this unnecessary evil that rots my soul

I feel old... I've grown so cold with time, behind my eyes
But the truth still shows even when it's twisted in riddles
Still, what's wrong is wrong
But even as I'm dwelling here now
It's like not of this world
And even having seen with my eyes as i watched it unfurl

Into this storm I've waded and sink as quick as time
Out from this night I've waited for something bright to shine

I guess the less that's said the better
'Cause you're afraid I'll lose control
And this unnecessary evil might eat you whole

How does it feel knowing that we're spinning in circles of lies?
And how does it feel knowing that your silence is hurtful?
When it's wrong say it's wrong
And even as I'm standing my ground after all I have heard
And even as I've bitten my tongue,
I've never swallowed my words

Into this storm I've waded and sink as quick as time
Out from this night I've waited for something bright to shine
