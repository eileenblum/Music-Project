And they plan in riddles, and they speak in lies,
And they hide in secret

From sinking ships they lick their lips
And bite the hand that that feeds 'em
Then turn their eyes and skip in time
And hold the hand that beats 'em
To them it is all the same... to them it is just a game
To be won for the prize of nothing
So their master's sins, through cheshire grins,
Disappear with a wink between 'em

Dead letters we've sent along in vain,
Thinking they'd hear our call
These dead letters will not arrive at all

They'll let in rot in ruin, let in lie in dust, let it rust in rubble
They'll leave us crushed and crippled, they watch us rend in two
They leave us split and splintered and never say as they do

With battered fools as uselfull tools
They destory the ones who bore them
The brash and bold are bought and sold
By the ones who alone implore them
To them it is all the same, to them it's just a game
To be won at the cost of many
Who'd trade their soul for little bowls filled with swill
And set before them

Dead letters we've sent along in vain,
Thinking they'd hear our call
These dead letters will not arrive at all

They'll let in rot in ruin, let in lie in dust, let it rust in rubble
They'll leave us crushed and crippled, they watch us rend in two
They leave us split and splintered and never say as they do

And they plan in riddles, and they speak in lies,
And they hide in secret

Dead letters we've sent along in vain,
Thinking they'd hear our call
These dead letters will not arrive at all

No lesson is learned and so it returns
To repeat all that came before us
And the fleeting dreams of the liars' schemes
Reappear and promise to restore us

Dead letters we've sent along in vain,
They'll, never, ever hear our call
These dead letters will not arrive at all
