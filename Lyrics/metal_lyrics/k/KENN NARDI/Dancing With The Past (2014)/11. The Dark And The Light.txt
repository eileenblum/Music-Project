Too blind to appearance to know a sheep in wolf's clothes 
You see teeth and cowerâ¦you mistake a smile for a snarl 
But Iâm not just hollow and Iâll not justify
But never would I marry the dark and the light

Pierce the veil of the surface, 
Unfold the things of the heart
Within the blessed call to acceptance
You only hear the harsh call to arms
But Iâll not just follow and Iâll not just defy
But never would I marry the dark and the light

But Iâm not just hollow and Iâll not justify
And never would I marry the dark and the light 

Give them eyes to seeâ¦give them eyes to see 
Give them eyes to seeâ¦give them eyes...
Well Iâm not just rotten 'cause Iâm justified
And never would I marry the dark and the light

But Iâm not forsaken 'cause Iâm justified 
And never have I traded for dark, the light 
For dark, the light...for dark, the light...
For dark, the light...
