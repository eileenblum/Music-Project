It lives within the cold rust of society
It rots beneath our feet on shaky ground
Deep beneath the skin of broken piety torn open
As each stone is overturned, our loss is found
Itâs all just lies, blinding our eyes...eyes, blinded by lies
Lies, crushing our lives...lies, blinding our eyes

It's growing as we sleep and feeds anxiety
It draws the hood across our hanging heads 
Drowning everything in impropriety's confusion 
With each layer peeled away this mask is shed
Itâs all just lies, blinding our eyes...eyes, blinded by lies
Lies, crushing our lives...lies, blinding our eyes

Just like a child reaches and gropes 
Fresh from the dark, a stranger to hope 
Unfocused eyes strain without sight
So we all crawl towards the light

Lies, blinding our eyes...eyes, blinded by lies 
Lies, crushing our lives...lies, blinding our eyes 

It lives within the cold rust of society
It rots beneath our feet on shaky ground
Deep beneath the skin of broken piety torn open
As each stone is overturned, our loss is found

Just like a child reaches and gropes 
Fresh from the dark, a stranger to hope 
Unfocused eyes strain without sight
So we all crawl towards the light 
Just like a child reaches and gropes, 
Fresh from the dark, conceived in hope
Unfocused eyes, new to the fight
So we all crawl towards the light
