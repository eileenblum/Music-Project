I walk this thin line without purpose
Glean only pieces from the surface
Torn apart inside, bruised and battered pride
The boiling hotter than the burn is

I go numb againâ¦
I go numb againâ¦

This stabbing sorrow cuts me slowly
My cries, unheard and sharp and growing
Sliced apart inside, this wound laid opened wide
I've paid a price beyond my owing

I go numb againâ¦
I go numb againâ¦

This gaping maw eats raw the bleeding
Hungry, devouring in its needing
I fight with all my will to bear the hurt distilled
Within this well of hopeless pleadings

I go numb againâ¦
I go numb againâ¦
