Still running up this endless hill, still choking on this poison pill
Where nothing takes the pain from nothing in the end
I've carried every banner, shilled, sweat fire like the sprinklings of an aspergil
Where nothing ever cleanses nothing in the end
How long 'til the walls will fall again? 
And how low 'til the center folds within? 
And would this ever leave my side, even if it could?

I saw which was the simple way, but chose the path of most resistance 
And burdened with a broken soul, my body knows the weight and strain 
Clenched fist but this I know...Iâve seen the end; itâs in the distance
I've fought the urge to bend and crawl, but what hope did I ever haveâ¦
Being born in a place called "broken heart"?

And tell me...what is in a name?
Is there meaning in the place we came into
This unauditioned role we never chose?
I've struggled just to break away from this curse into another day
Where nothing's ever haunted by nothing we have known
How long 'til the walls will fall again? 
And how low 'til the center folds within? 
And would I cast this thing aside, even if I could?

I saw which was the simple way, but chose the path of most resistance 
And burdened with a broken soul, my body knows the weight and strain 
Bit-lipped but this I know...Iâve seen the end; itâs in the distance
I've fought the urge to bend and crawl, but what hope did I ever haveâ¦
Being born in a place called "broken heart"?

What did it take to make this? 
Or was it born within? 

And tell me what is in a name?
Is there meaning in the place we came in to this world; a role we never chose?
How long 'til the walls will fall again? 
And how low 'til the center folds within?
And would this ever leave my side, even if it could?

I saw which was the simple way, but chose the path of most resistance 
And burdened with a broken soul, my body knows the weight and strain 
I might miss, but this I know...Iâve seen the end; itâs in the distance
I've fought the urge to bend and crawl, but what hope did I ever haveâ¦.
Being born in a place called "broken heart"?
