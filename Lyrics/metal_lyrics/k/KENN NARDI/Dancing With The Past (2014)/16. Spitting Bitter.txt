So hollow, you wallowâ¦the mud your home
I've tried to lift you, but you're adrift to
Some other place alone

Will you not listen to reason?
Will you watch another season die? 
With your will broken and beaten
âtil you fade into deletion?

So needy, you bleed me and drain life dry 
I tried to trust you, but truth disgusts you 
Your strength is in the lie
Will you not listen to reason?
Will you watch another season die? 
With your will broken and beaten
âtil you fade into deletion?

Let your words mean something more than nothing
Let them stir from deep within, confronting 
Leave this world of promises you're haunting 
Let your "yes" be "yes" and let your "no" be "no"

Promises are always broken, 
Words are better never spoken 
Actions never match emotions, 
Spitting bitter, sugar-coating
