Memories of shocking things 
The outcryings at all weâd seen 
They fade away, unwelcoming 
It's all so very ordinary now

I recall the shocking things
The outraging and all theyâd bring
We look away, not noticing
It's all so very ordinary now

We could hear the squall, appalled
The call against just the thought of it all
It's like we're trained, with ice within our veins
To never show the pain or to know
Let it out, let it out
Goâ¦get it out, get it out

I recall the hurting screams
The outreachings for what we'd seen
We pull away, so uncaring
It's all so very ordinary now
Barely touched, our eyes are shut
Our hearts are cut, left pounded to bits
It's like we're filled with ice that's chilled our will
To ever feel again or to know

Let it out, let it out
Goâ¦get it out, get it out

Memories of shocking things
And outcryings at all weâd seen
All blurred dreams and strange musings
It's all so very ordinary now
We could hear the squall, appalled,
The call against just the thought of it all
It's like we're trained, with ice within our veins
To never show the pain or know

Let it out, let it out 
Goâ¦get it out, get it out 
No, let it out, let it out 
Goâ¦get it out, get it out
