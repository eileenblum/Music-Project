His home, within my home
He lies silently and deadly and unknown
I'm bound, tongue-tied and bound
And right before my eyes the horror show

Seeking to take it all...This killer in my house
I'm helpless and overcome by hopelessness and doubt

He waits, a patient wait, invisible and hungry for so much
Defense, I've no defense
Against a thing I cannot feel nor hold nor touch

Seeking to take it all...This killer in my house
I'm helpless and overcome by hopelessness and doubt
Seeking to take it all...This killer in my house
I'm helpless and overcome by hopelessness and doubt

I can't fight what I can't see...I can't fight what I can't feel
I can't fight what I can't touch...I can't fight...

Cold, so cold...He lies in wait and calculates his crime
Stop, how can I make it stop...
When all is dark and lost in stolen time?

Seeking to take it all...This killer in my house
I'm helpless and overcome by hopelessness and doubt
Seeking to take it all...This killer in my house
I'm helpless and overcome by hopelessness and doubt
