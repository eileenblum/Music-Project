There's a darkness here and it's deep and cold
Like an endless year in winter's hold
Night has fallenâ¦leaves rotten, calling out

There's a darkness here and it comes and goes, 
But like a shadow moves, still it shows itself 
Now forbidden, has spring safely hidden too?

There's a little light, like a speck of white, like a satellite blinking slowly
There's a whispering, like a lullaby from a little voice speaking softly

If there's a little light...
If there's a little light that shines for me lord, I canât see it 
If there is any light there's so little light it's hard to see, Lord, help me see it

There are silhouettes of sand and bone
Wearing tarnished crowns on broken thrones
The tides have come in...kingdoms all are crumbling

There's a little light, like a speck of white like a satellite blinking slowly
There's a whispering, like a lullaby from a little voice speaking softly
There's a little light...there is something bright like a camera pointed at me
Thereâs a word of hope in a message sent in a bottle that floats too slowly

If there's a little light...
If there's a little light that shines for me lord, I cannot see it
If there is any light there's so little light it's hard to see
Lord, help me see it, lord

If there's a little light...
If there's a little light that shines for me lord, I cannot see it
If there is any light there's so little light it's hard to see, lord, help me see it
Lord, lord, if there is any light there's a little hope I swear, I know
Lord, where does it go?
