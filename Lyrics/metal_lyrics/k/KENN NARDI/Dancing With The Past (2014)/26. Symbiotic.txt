When the ties that bind tore, unwinding
âtwas like you never saw it coming
And once the light inside you would not shine
Then I knew you'd never see as clear again

The water's deep, but blood is thickâ¦one fills the soul, one makes us tick 
Adjoined and whole, apart and sick for we are all symbiotic

When the spark went dark it was blinding
I knew I should have felt it coming
But once the will inside you would not fight
Then I knew youâd never be the same again

The water's deep, but blood is thickâ¦one fills the soul, one makes us tick 
Adjoined and whole, apart and sick for we are all symbiotic

Where does it go...this vanishing wisdom gathered in years, 
When life and the vision go dark?
Here and alone, you linger like incense traded for tears after the essence departs
What can we know as we race towards the future? 
When healing is slow, sewn with the sutures of time 
And why must they go?
What is the reason these colors of hope
Must change like the seasons that die?

And our connections, when all is said and done, 
Are mere reflections upon our shattered core

As the night invites in the twilight I stare into the sinking sun
And though I wait and long to see it rising
I suppose it never will again

Where does it go...this vanishing wisdom gathered in years, 
When life and the vision go dark?
Here and alone, you linger like incense traded for tears after the essence departs 
What can we know as we race towards the future? 
When healing is slow, sewn with the sutures of time 
And why must they go?
What is the reason these colors of hope
Must change like the seasons that die?

The water's deep, but blood is thickâ¦one fills the soul, one makes us tick 
Adjoined and whole, apart and sick for we are all symbiotic
