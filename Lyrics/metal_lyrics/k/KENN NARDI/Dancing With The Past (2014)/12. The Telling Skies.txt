Clouds are rising above us
A storm is growing within us...the craving for knowing
The telling skies have spoken in visions, in passing 
The deaf ears seeking shelter in forests of dogma 
Where every branch is bent and broken
Bury whatâs evident in shallow argument
Not able to believe in things greater than men
Than men, in things greater than men

Lightning flashing above us
The strain reflected around us, in bearing our standing
The telling skies have spoken in visions of warning
The cowards seeking shelter in closed minds and closed doors
âtil every door is kicked wide open

Spilling this testament of our enlightenment
Not able to conceive of things greater than men
Than men, of things greater than men
No we canât believe inâ¦in things unseen

Our towers of babel, fallen, rise again
The ignorance, the insolence of arrogance 
After all this time has blurred the lines drawn 
Between god and men

In things greater than men, than men 
Than men, in things greater than men 
No we canât believe inâ¦in things unseen 
No we canât conceive of things greaterâ¦
