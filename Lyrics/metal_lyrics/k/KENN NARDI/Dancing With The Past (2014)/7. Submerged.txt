And love is like a river of bringing streams of life-blood
but when it's stopped and over-flows, there it births destruction

And through the floods of rushings, into the spinning drop
Upon the waves and gushing, explodes above the top

And love is like a river of bringing streams of life-blood
but when it's stopped and over-flows, there it births destruction

Below the crushing sinking, into the darkened deep
Within the brooding tensing, the creeping frozen sleep

And love is like a river of bringing streams of life-blood
but when it's stopped and over-flows, there it births destruction

Dreaming slips beneath... Hope is lost to the flow

The flooding of wanting, asunder, confronting everything
Now submerged

And love is like a river of bringing streams of life-blood
but when it's stopped and over-flows, there it births destruction

Grasping at twisted missings in gasping, rollings falls
In choking, spoken pleadings of desperate mourning calls

And love is like a river of bringing streams of life-blood
but when it's stopped and over-flows, there it births destruction

Dreaming slips beneath... Hope is lost to the flow
The flooding of wanting, asunder, confronting everything
Now submerged
