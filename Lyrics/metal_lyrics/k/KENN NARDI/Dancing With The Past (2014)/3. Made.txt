There's a root in mystery
Greater than the sins of Sodom
To remove all our history and erase all things forgotten
And just we're made of
Just what we're made of

We try to envision love, but we aren't able
Rejecting the truth that's in our minds, returning to fables
We heard from within an inner voice and thought it an angel
Inventing a God in our own form in our own minds

To the eye it's a blistering
Peering into the world surrounding
Taking in all there is to see
With even what is clear confounding
Just what we're made of
Just what we're made of

We try to envision love, but we aren't able
Rejecting the truth that's in our minds, returning to fables
We heard from within an inner voice and thought it an angel
Inventing a God in our own form
And something like unto ourselves
And not the one who made us
We turned away from the one who made us
We turned away

We try to envision love, but we aren't able
Rejecting the truth that's in our minds, returning to fables
We heard from within an inner voice and thought it an angel
Inventing a God in our own form and something like unto ourselves
And not the one who made us...
And not the one who made us...
And not the one who made us...
