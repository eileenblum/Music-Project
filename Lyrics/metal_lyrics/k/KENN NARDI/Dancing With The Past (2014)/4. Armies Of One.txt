Standing like the soldiers of a battle of a time beloved
All lining up in armies of one
Stranded like the lost and gone and vanished like the dark at dawn
Forgotten for unholy wars to come...
Once again this spangled banner torn and you alone again
So many like you ignored, left only to mourn...

The months and years have taken their toll
And time has eaten holes
In everything and everyone and left nothing to extol

You linger but the ghost is gone
Can't you hear the promise of the new and strong?
With all anyone could ever want and more and more and more...
Once again this mangled banner torn... you hide alone again
So many more like you ignored left only for to mourn...

The months and years have taken their toll
And time has eaten holes
In everything and everyone and left nothing to hold

Below the setting sun, stand, in the shadows, the lonely one by one
What they have glows and lights the way another day
Before the setting's done
Before the winter comes and dying and all that's left succumbs
And the crying is silenced of the armies of one

Below the setting sun, stand, in the shadows, the lonely one by one
What they have glows and lights the way another day
Before the setting's done
Before the winter comes and dying and all that's left succumbs
And the crying is silenced of the armies of one

Once again this spangled banner torn and you alone...
