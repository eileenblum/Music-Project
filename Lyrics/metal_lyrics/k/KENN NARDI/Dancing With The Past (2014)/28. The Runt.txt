Something has cast a shadow evermore
Upon a world once bright
Smothering the light, baffling the bold
And cleaving the flesh from the bone

It tears from the top and weeds the single mind
Its turns and its twists undermine
By crushing the strong it leaves the runt
Unchallenged to suckle alone

Are we finished now, forgotten how to stay alive? 
Will we wait until weâve lost the will to just survive? 
Are we finished now, forgotten how to stay alive? 
Will we wait until weâve lost the will to just survive?

Something has drawn a shroud across the land
To hide a world once bright
Snuffing the light, destroying all hope
And raising the weak over all
It eats from the top, the scraps are left to lie
And to rot what could overcome
It turns on itself and leaves the runt
Unbridled to feed on its own

Are we finished now, forgotten how to stay alive? 
Will we wait until weâve lost the will to just survive? 
Are we finished now, forgotten how to stay alive? 
Will we wait until weâve lost the will to just survive?

It tears from the top and weeds the single mind
Its turns and its twists undermine
By crushing the strong it leaves the runt
Unchallenged to suckle alone

Are we finished now, forgotten how to stay alive? 
Will we wait until weâve lost the will to just survive? 
Are we finished now, forgotten how to stay alive? 
Will we wait until weâve lost the will to just survive?
