They're running from the state they're in
They're searching for a sanctuary
Alone and through the passage dim,
Weighed down beneath the doubt they carry
What's next for these?
What's next for these unmoving human statuary? 
In shackles of their apathy
In chains too heavy for the climb ahead

Again they crawl, encountering this fence-barbed wall
"now climb!" they're told, not knowing they can fly

They're shown that there's no place for them
And told that they're unnecessary 
Like fodder for the garbage bin, they're treated like the dead unburied
What's left for these? What's left for these descendants of the cold and wary? 
Now laid within a casket dark and dourâ¦forgotten with a beating heart

Again they crawl encountering this fence-barbed wall
"now climb!" they're told, not knowing they can fly

They're starving there, picking at the barren tree 
They're starving there, staring at the ravaged fields 
They're starving there,
They rifle through cupboard bare
They're dying there in places where nobody cares

In prisons of establishment 
And modern-day apothecaries 
Designed to curb and cull their minds 
And isolate the insularly
What's left for these? What's left for these? 
The stagnant and the sedentary?
What will it take to shake the sleeping lostâ¦
Awake to what is meant for them?

Again they crawl encountering this fence-barbed wall
"now climb!" they're told, not knowing they can fly 
Desperate they claw, entangled in this fence-barbed wall
Theyâre trapped there stillâ¦not knowing they can fly
