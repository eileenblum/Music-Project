Iâm standing beside myself, divide myself in twoâ¦to sharpen my blunted point of view 
And every careful step Iâm taking dares and my knowing legs are shaking
Iâm trying to find myself, remind myself of the heart and how I have torn myself apart 
The precautions that I am taking fail and my knowing heart is aching

Do you believe that our hands hold so little? 
Do you believe that our hearts know so little? 
Do you believe that our hands hold so little? 
And that after all, we know so little?

Iâm living inside myself, I hide myself from the strain 
In dwellings of shelter from the pain
All the walls I have assembled fall as my whole foundation trembles
I try to convince myself, dismiss myself from this hold 
To cling to the reigns of self-control
But the tether I am gripping tears and my fraying hands are slipping

Do you believe that our hands hold so little? 
Do you believe that our hearts know so little? 
Do you believe that our hands hold so little? 
And that after all, we know so little?

And does it make us more real to defy our nature?...to deny what we feel?
To believe that our hands hold so little?
Do you believe that our hearts know so little? 
Do you believe that our hands hold so little?
And that after all, we've learned so little?

I'm living beside myself, divide myself in two
I'm crawling inside myself to hide myself from you
I'm living beside myself, divide myself in two
I'm crawling inside myself to hide myself from you

Do you believe that our hands hold so little? 
Do you believe that our hearts know so little? 
Do you believe that our hands hold so little?
And that after all, weâve learned so little?

And does it make us more real to defy our nature?...to deny what we feel?
To believe that our hands hold so little?
Do you believe that our hearts know so little? 
Do you believe that our hands hold so little? 
And that after all, we know so little?
