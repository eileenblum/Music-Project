I hear the call of the siren, I hear the wail of the warning
Await the coming of sunset
From the dawning of the morning...

I hear the call of the siren, I hear the wail of the warning
Await the coming of sunset
From the dawning of the morning
Blinding distractions of worry...our focus shifted away
Imagining the end one thousand ways

What will the storm-bringers bring?
What do they see? What do the soothsayers say?
What does the oracle see but what do they want?

We hear predictions of torment
We dream the nightmare while waking
We the start of this ending
Of worlds crumbling 'neath the shaking
But wolves with sinister motives
Who move unseen in the night
Near sleeping sheep sedated, slumber not

What will the storm-bringers bring?
What do they see? What do the soothsayers say?
What does the oracle see but what do they want?

I hear the call of the siren, I hear the wail of the warning
Await the coming of sunset from the dawning of the morning...
And through the fog of our worries...I wake alone in the night
To see the dimming of one thousand points of light

What will the storm-bringers bring?
What do they see? What do the soothsayers say?
What does the oracle see but what do they want?
What will the false prophets sell?
What do they see? What do the doomsayers say?
What do so-called psychics see but what they want?
