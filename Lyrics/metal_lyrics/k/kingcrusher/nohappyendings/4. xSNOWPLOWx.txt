[feat. Tony of Trading Heroes For Ghosts]Oh shit what the fuck is up this is Kingcrusher from the East Coast
That 603 shit putting New Hampshire on the fucking map
We're gonna bring the heat out of these woods
You think we're fucking hicks out here, we're gonna show you how it's done
So grab a fucking beer throw your hands up and get ready for the 603 beat down

Crushing limbs at a dime a dozen
You think we're scum of the Earth
We are the purest, we are New England's finest

We got 4 seasons up here and we'll hit you for every fucking one of them
We are the Granite state "Live Free or Die" motherfucker
You'll never meet anybody as hard as us
And you'll never meet anybody who hits as hard as us

You will never leave this place, you'll never make it out alive
I'd like to see you try, I'd like to see you try

We'll hit you like a fucking snowplow
We'll hit you like a fucking snowplow

*Tony*
This is the anthem for my boys in the North
Trading Heroes For Ghosts Kingcrusher let's get this shit

We're from the 603

Trapped inside a granite hide
You bet your dick I'm from the 603
Calloused hands and dirty knees
I'm from the 603
Trapped inside a granite hide
You bet your dick I'm from the 603
Calloused hands and dirty knees
I ain't a bitch I'm from the 603
