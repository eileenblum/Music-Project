It doesn't matter what you have to say soon you'll be fucking dead anyway.
A thief, a liar, a crook. These are just some of the things that you are.
I will rise above all the ignorance and the petty shit you will pull.
It's no surprise to see you sinking, while I'm sipping a martini poolside.

I didn't think you could go lower, but I guess you're just scum.
A little piece of shit bottom feeder, heart so cold you must need a heater.

We lost ourselves to the fray, we'll speak day after day.
You'll find me at the end without this bullshit.
Drop all your baggage at the door, we don't have time for more.
Take a look inside yourself and just relax.

The end is near I can promise you that.

Just pull the trigger and watch the pain fade away.
