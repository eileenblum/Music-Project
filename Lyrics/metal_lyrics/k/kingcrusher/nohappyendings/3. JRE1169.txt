[feat. Zach Calabrese]None of this was in vain, nothing was regretted.
I took their lives and I'll take yours too.
So put your teeth to the curb and I'll smash you to fucking pieces bitch.

I told you time and time AGAIN.
Either fucking step up or step out.
I'll fucking butcher you.

Ayo piece of shit, Kingcrusher here to mess up your fucking life.
So step up to the plate we ain't taking shit from nobody and you're no exception.
So you best get on your knees and fucking pray for your life.

I'll rip your fucking throat out and kill you.
I'll beat on your body till there's nothing left but dust and ash.
It doesn't matter who you are you won't last long at all.

People come and people go you can stay as long as you ain't a hoe.
People come and people go you can stay as long as you ain't a hoe.
People come and people go you can stay as long as you ain't a hoe.
People come and people go you can stay as long as you ain't a hoe.

*Zach*
There's nothing more that you could say my mind is made.
You'll surely meet the grave all born the same, but we die in a million ways.

People come and people go. Here's one way that they fucking go
*Eric*
I'll torch every shred of remains
*Zach*
But the blood stays on the blade.

I'll preserve the artistâs vision as I make the final incision
Your debt of life will be paid out slow people come but you'll fucking go

*Eric*
If I have to tell you one more time some bitch is getting hurt
And I can promise you that

*Zach*
You stupid little cunt
Fuck

*Eric*
People come and people go
Kingcrusher's here to stay
2019 the year you die
I'll see you in your grave
