My plan is exceptional
My plan raises heads above the wall
My plan attacks the fuckin'
Daily routine
With a red arrow of hate

My plan is for bad Children
For Whom life's got no meaning
My plan is to destroy a still frame
Of rubbish daily fate

You must call upon the devil's name
Call like faust

Swallow tears when dancin'
Sick hunger brings terrible thirst
At dawn - a wild dog in a muzzle
At night like an angry woolf

My plan's without fools
Runnin' the show here around
My plan is to destroy a still frame
Of rubbish daily fate

You must call upon the devil's child
Infernal frenzy, gettin' mad

Run, run
Close to fieryshots
Faster, faster

My plan is for bad children
For whom life's got no aim
My plan is to rage wild angels
And for a moment tobe myself

You must call upon the devil's child
Infernal frenzy - gettin' mad

Run, run
Close to fiery shots.
Faster, faster
To avoid the isty catch
Faster, faster
To avoid a dreary day
Faster, faster.
