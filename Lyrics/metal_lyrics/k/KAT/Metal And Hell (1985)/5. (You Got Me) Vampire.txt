Billions of dreams wrecking my body
Damned choirs of ghosts arouses fear
Haunting my house for zears

Billions of teeth you have bitch
Wanting to bite throught iron walls
And power of fate
This night you did it

You got me
You vampire
Drink blood

Pagan lust, frenzy - stop it
Bestial thought keeps telling me
Come - my body, lets spin
Hum of the world fades
Only your scream
Come to last vampire

You got me
You vampire
Drink blood.
