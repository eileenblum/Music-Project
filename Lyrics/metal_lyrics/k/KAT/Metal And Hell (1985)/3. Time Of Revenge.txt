From deep wounds
Glare of hordes
Black King, comes Abadon
Above him ring of heads
United devil's wrath in red flame.

And dragon stood
In front of pregnant maiden
So when she bears the child
To devour them
His Eden

From deep wounds
Out of dark
Came the time of revenge and violence
Death for tears
Tears for death
Death for devil's shedded blood

And she gave birth
To the tyran with an iron scepter
Yet Gog took him from devil's grasp
Abadon raised his ancient sword
War you dog!

A fiery diamond fell, and in fear the people knelt
With their children together
Revenge, blaze and whip
Out of dark
Fiery diamonds fell
And in fear the people knelt
With their children together
Revenge, blaze and whip
Blaze and whip

Black figure spreading death
Tears and death
Tears and death

Black phantom flares the sword

Tears and death
Tears and death

Black phantom flares the sword

Tears and death
Tears and death

Black phantom points the sword to heaven

Tears and death
Tears and death

Hell's revenge brings death.
