War cry united us together
The total frenzy, hungry house of sex
Silent sonnet of soul's sea
Satan, it feels good
On my leg chasing rat

In a diabolic scream
The Black Ruler
I dare to ask
For naive, ready virgin

Her legs like a cold shadow
Wrapping my torso, slippery and wet
Just when will she sit near me
Wish I could touch her

Venom burns blood
Poisoned devil's child
The venom burns blood
Poisoned dead child

In a diabolic scream
The Black Ruler
I dare to ask
For a secret passage
To Hell

'cause
My Black Lord
I wonder
Surely 'cause
'cause
No bodies
No souls.
