Heavy rain drenched canyon
Roaring thunder a big tree fell
Dogs of nightstorms started howling
In red glare of rocks
An old church appeared
It's gates a suffering monk

Where do I know him from?
Face with scars
Where do I know you from?
But no answer
Clang of keys
The iron gate was opened
Monk standing just behind
Invited me to come inside
Darkness, dirt, foul smell wafted
Then I noticed shreds of heads
Yelling in pain
Their eyes stared at me

And what for
And what for
At such night you want to come
Where do I know you from
It's like devil's house.
Chains, chains thrown off
Till blood.
