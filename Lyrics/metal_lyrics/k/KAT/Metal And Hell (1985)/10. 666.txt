Devil, Satan, Satan
Devil, Satan, Satan
Brings jackals death
The end of flowing years
Prayers for souls bathed in blood

Devil, Satan, Satan
His idea drills a head, your head
Satan, Satan

To die or live with him
Satan, Satan and lust

I'm Black Death
Fear in the eyes of church
Give up, give up
World will be mine

Satan, Satan
To die or live with him
Satan, Satan and lust

Devil, Satan, Satan
Lord of Evil

His bible's yours
And in wisdom, belief
Three sixes, six, six, six
My and peoples' sign

Satan, Satan
To die or live with him
Satan, Satan and lust
