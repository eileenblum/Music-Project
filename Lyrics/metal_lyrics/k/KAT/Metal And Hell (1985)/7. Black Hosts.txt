King's name, Kingdom of Pain
Sounds great - Satan
Satan the sign
Of Evil power, greed and mad thoughts

It's venom
The venom and snake
Eternal call of truths revealed to me
His first riot and pain

Black hosts of hungry souls
Chains thrown off till blood

King's disciple, Kingdom of Pain
Your power rises pleasure and taste
Of a Black Mess marked with blood

Gives venom
Gives venom and force
Eternal call of truths revealed to me
His first riot and pain

Black Hosts of hungry souls
Chains thrown off till blood
Black hosts of hungry souls
Death
It's death and fear
Black hosts of hungry souls
