A stony monument of dirt-city
Knife concealed in dark
Face covered up
City gettin' silent
City's sleeping
Only the killer mocks

Waiting
Hunters, find your victim
Human glance is sweet, though
You notice
Looks of greed, envy lust
Tears of hate
Now you'll know yourself better at last
And your dreams
Like shadows
Huntin' the corpses
Blood and the corpse

Killing
Human dreams
Like shadows
Hauntin' the corpse
Blood and the corpse
Dead line, death fuck you
No, no, death fuck you.
