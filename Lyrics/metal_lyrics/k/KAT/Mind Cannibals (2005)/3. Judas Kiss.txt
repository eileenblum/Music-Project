Never found the way
Leading to the Babylon's gate
Leading to the core of the earth
Still out of a trace

The garden of my home
Covered with the shadow of moon
Any night I run through his womb
Why can't I get out

Judas, the kiss of Judas
Judas, the kiss of Judas

Seems like wise old trees
Hear the prayer of my deep wounds
Tell me the way how to get out
Never, I never look back

Listen to the north wind
Of the world's decay
riding on the back of night
Never find the way

Domination, still around the pain
When you're in a hidden trap
Death takes you away

Is there only one way
To get the mad system down
The empire of corruption
Judas kiss close to my face
Lost in the time of dominant hate

Judas, the kiss of Judas
Judas, the kiss of Judas

Is there only one way
To get the key of the secret gate
The key of the last solution
The Judas kiss close to my face
Lost in the time of dominant crime

Is there only one way
To get the mad system down
The empire of corruption
Judas kiss close to my face
Lost in the nests of hypocrisy's might
