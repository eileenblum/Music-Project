In the shadow of the thoughts
Under the hidden structure of existence
Arise the pure human instinct
Of endless lust for conflicts

Face of divine hate
Hidden in our veins
Face of divine trace
Follows till you die

Never let evil
Look in your eye
Stay sharp, before light
Never returns

Before your sense gonna die
Before your conscience gonna die
Before your nerves overload
Before the prophecy comes true

In the twilight
Religious clash, I've seen
In the twilight
Now the world's end
In the twilight
Now insane clash
In the twilight - twilight
Clash
Religious clash
Heretic's wars
Heretic's stake

The face of divine hate
Hidden in our thoughts
The face of divine trace
The witness of the life

Never let evil
Look in your eye
Stay sharp, before day
Turns into night

Before your sense gonna die
Before your mind commits a crime
Before it turns into the pain
Before the prophecy comes true

Religious clash
Heretic's wars
Heretic's stake
Never ever end
Stakes in the flames
Religious clash
