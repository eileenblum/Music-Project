Madness spins around me
The race of bloody money

I've gotta make it
You've gotta take it
And buy some pleasure
From devils

Living in
Dogmas' time
With the media
Playing gods

Fakes and lies
Dominate
Crime on children
No one cares

Human aliens
Sell the world
Buying minds
Piece by piece - for cash
Suck out brains
Mind cannibals

Living in
The house of gods
Where heretics
Celebrate

Human aliens
Sell the world
Buying minds
Piece by piece - for cash
Suck out brains
Mind cannibals

We are living
In the world of hypocrisy
So don't be blind, raise up against

Sings of the snake on the heaven's gate
Like omens of the judgement day
Media's eye runs in mortal haste
Afraid of the dying planet's carnage of the vengeance

Human beasts
Sell the world
Buing minds
Piece by piece - for cash
Suck out brains
Stealing souls
Mind cannibals
