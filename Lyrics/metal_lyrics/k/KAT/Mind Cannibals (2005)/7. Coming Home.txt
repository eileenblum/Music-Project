Lava never cools down till I'm away
Never sleep! Never sleep the shinning eye!
The muzzles of the furious dogs - after me!
Frightful howlin' from the cave - biting beasts

Ravens crowing spin the route of destiny
While the thorny march through years from exile
The muzzles of the hungry dogs follow me
Coming to my place of birth, my residence

The cradle of night
The cradle of power
Light in the dark
The shelter of mine

The cradle of moon
The cradle of thunder
The sign on the way
Of labyrinths

the silent ashes of my friends, passed away
Rest into the homeland graves, wait for me
Now I wander through the world, far away
In the arms of elements, I'm coming home

The cradle of night
The cradle of power
Light in the dark
The shelter of mine

The cradle of moon
The cradle of thunder
The sign on the way
Of labyrinths

The cradle of night
The cradle of power
Light in the dark
The shelter of mine

The cradle of moon
The cradle of thunder
The sign on the way
Of labyrinths

The cradle of night
The shelter of mine
