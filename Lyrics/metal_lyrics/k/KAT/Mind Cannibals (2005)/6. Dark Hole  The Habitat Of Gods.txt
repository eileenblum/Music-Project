The end of the day, the end of the day
Silent wind
The end of the day, the sun goes down
In the cradle of night
These times I close my eyes
Try to dream
I wanna know
Where sleeps the truth

The end of the day
The end of the hopes
Empty space
I wanna know
Who is steering my life

When the dark hole's calling
Into the mystery
Where gods play with mercy

The end of the time
The end of the time
Of Millennium
The end of the wait
I try to forget the promises
These times I close my eyes
While stardust falls
I wanna know
Who is steering my life

When the dark hole's calling
Into the mystery
Where gods play with mercy
They are hiding, create
The fears of the Kingdom's might
I will get there, behind this
Twilight's curtain to see

The habitat of gods
The temple of evil eyes
And see them face to face
Inside their dome
I try, I try to get there
Even going through hell
I wanna know it now at last
Who stands behind

When the dark hole's calling
Into the mystery
Where gods play with mercy

Here I am waiting
Remember the pictures
Of holy wars
So why the lies
It's kind of crime
Between is nothing more
