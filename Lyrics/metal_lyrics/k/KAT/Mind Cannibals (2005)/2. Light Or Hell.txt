Daily stress
Takes you down
Your brain's exploding
Nothing can calm your pain, you say

You wanna leave this world of liars, yeah
'cause anger grows inside your mind

No matter if comes light or hell, light or hell
You've gotta stay in pride
No matter who rules they or hell, they or hell
Defend your bleeding mind

You want to stay here no longer, no longer
You want to eat the politicsshit no more

So far so cool they think you're a fool
You've gotta believe in their sick truth
Don't give them a chance, no more
Defend your bleeding mind

No matter if comes light or hell, light or hell
You've gotta stay in pride
No matter who rules they or hell, they or hell

No matter if comes light or hell, light or hell
No matter who rules they or hell
Light or hell

No matter if comes light or hell, light or hell
No matter who rules they or hell, they or hell

No matter if comes light or hell, light or hell
No matter who rules they or hell
Light or hell
