Winter night, I feel so cold
The reflection of mind
Spin the time
For moments ease my pain
When I'm sad

Stand and fall - no one cares
Somehow trying to make my day
You, you're gone away, so far away, there's
Nothing left

When I'm down, when I'm lost
When I'm blind
There's something I've got at last
It is the place I crave for returning
Our home

When I'm a fool, when I'm down, when I cry
Miss you and my beloved son

Life is so cruel
I pay the price of pain

I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
I've been waiting
