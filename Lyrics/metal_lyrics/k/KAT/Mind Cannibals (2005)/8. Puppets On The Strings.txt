Human beings
The human beings of clay
Puppet's now
On the strings of clowns

Human clones
Rule the world today
No one knows who is who
You can trust no more

Creation of splitted mind
Creation of splitted mind
Splitted mind

Many blind
So many blind
They twine around like
Worms in rotten meat

Without faces
without pride
Without brains
And charisma

Time pass away
Time pass away
The cradle changes int the grave
Time pass away
Time pass away
The time of the real beings

Is this the life you're dreaming of
Is this the place you're looking for
You're looking for
You're looking for
The promised land

Human beings
The human beings of clay
Puppet's now
On the strings of clowns
