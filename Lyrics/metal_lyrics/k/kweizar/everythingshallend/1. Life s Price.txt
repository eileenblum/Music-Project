Thatâs the man
Who doesnât matter the price
his pleasure means all
mercy is not allowed

the chosen way will return what he deserves
the beginning or the end
that is when to pay

it's the perfect balance
Joy to pain
Sad to bliss
now don't regret your actions
cause you are in one arm
life will have a big change
beauty for bust, eyesore for win
And all the things you do
Will be measured by lifeâs price

it's the perfect balance
Joy to pain
Sad to bliss
Never regret your actions
cause you are in one arm
life will have a big change
beauty for bust, eyesore for win
heed the lifes price

she is the helpless girl
She saw her life torn
By the claws of lust
The causes brings effects

Lost dignity was not a choice
A new shining life was the ware
Taking over to the horizonâs line
Justice was done by lifes price
