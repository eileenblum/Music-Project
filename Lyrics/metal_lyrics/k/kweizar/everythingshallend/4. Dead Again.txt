my sight
has been intercepted
unexpected situation
made me go astray
death was made to be lived
to create a desire of it
time executor of fate
creator of hazards to clash
unforgettable past just allows es restiveness
surprised by the visit of this phantom
a farewell left a hope but
so many things have been left unwritten

another world
another life
new perspectives were assigned
another cycle starts again
once again to be dead again
we are death
pure and utter death
past stays in the past
but my blood is frozen now
as every soul taken by this angel of death
there's just flesh for worms
but death denies a second chance
so many memories past fast in my mind
we are the ones that shall destroy you
walk out of our way
we burn all that you fight for, we burn
your ideals away

we are death, we are death there's no scape
we are death, we are death, obliterate
scream ghouls scream, we are the hounds that
shall destroy you, we are the hounds
scream ghouls scream, we are the hounds that
shall destroy you, obliterate
we erase all evil, all fear, to conquer a higher state,
breathing fire, the blood begins to run
crawl to the shades, crawl to your head
begin this reign in fire, impostors will deny to his life, the blood begins to
crawl to the shades, crawl to your head
begin this reign in fire, impostors will deny to his life,
the blood begins to run.
