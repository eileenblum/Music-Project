every goal achieved
is a restart point to spread your sight
new things to think

we have a joint idea
expectation in spotlight
progress is a road to the end

owners of the entire aptness
the true story and all the crypts
is there nothing to be?

our spirit is dead
mankind disappear

at the end of the world
death is not waiting for us
limited by ourselves
nescient til the end of the times

destruction of the world
a tragedy that will not come

keep with your crossing
no one talk about a closure, not yet
our curious nature is implied by default

destruction is not the word
a tragedy is not going to come
our spirit is dead
mankind disappear

intelligence would never take a biased decision
with satisfaction and flutter
we are going to the next stage

all the effort and the old failures
led us to the end of wisdom
we must know what is there at the end

our spirit is dead
mankind disappear

at the end of the world
death is not waiting for us
limited by ourselves
nescient til the end of the times

destruction of the world
a tragedy that will not come

prepare to reach it
all knowledge enough
awaiting the new age

what the end contains Â
