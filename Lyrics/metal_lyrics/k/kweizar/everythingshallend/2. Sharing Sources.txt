Someone should name them
Since you know the term
Can I feel the same of you?
Explain with words
If you feel the desire
A new beginning will come
Letâs read our minds
Letâs match our source

A new level starts
Look at my blindness
see through your blurred sight
And discover me
A new created space
you can go in
You can step in the heart
Without tearing

an empty hole
this is your mind
a strange speech
compared with mine
you don't have the reason
I'm not near a little
an unique existence
is a complete universe

A new level starts
Look at my blindness
see through your blurred sight
And discover me
A new created space
you can go in
You can step in the heart
Without tearing

so many things to assimilate
but what I see all is so weird
everything you always said
was neither a touch of what I see
my hate is near your hope
angry is almost like truelove
digesting these silent ideas
from a distant call beyond you
