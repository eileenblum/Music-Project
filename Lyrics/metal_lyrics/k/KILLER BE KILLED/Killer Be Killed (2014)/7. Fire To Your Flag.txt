Go light the Flame and burn these Symbols of Atrocity.
You're better dead than off to serve their fucking Cause.
Allegiance Baptism, how they molest the Young.
Never will you be free to live until you learn to
Set Fire to your Flag.

Injustice, Enslavement the Masters of Society.
Corrosion, Oblivion fuck you and your Reality.
Religious Decisions destroy the Lack of Liberty.
Conforming Corrosion, they're killing Victory.
Set Fire to your Flag.

With an Eye on the Floor spin around until you're inside out of you
And you're still looking for more no way to stop the bleeding from your wound
The bleeding from your wound.
You can never ever stop bleeding from your wound.
You can never stop bleeding from your wound.
