Cut from Wire, blind of Light from another Breed.
Realize wrong from right, turning raw inside of me.
Having Vision in the Sight, like cutting Razor Wire.
We live on through the Night, Night of eternal Fire.

I never stopped to notice the Fire in your Hand.
A Burning so consuming, but now I understand
And now I'm falling like Icarus to Land.
Too late to kill the Flame that I fanned.
And you never stopped to notice the Fire in your Hand.
We're burning so consuming, but now I understand
And now I'm falling like Icarus to Land.
A Victim of the Flame that I fanned

Wings above, Danger's near, they're coming down.
Flying close to the Sun, You will only hit the ground.
The Silence is so deafening the end is just the Beginning.
Inside the Void I hear you scream.

Arise, arise not so close to the Sky.
Alive, alive when you face Death you feel alive.
Kill it, kill it channel your Animal Side.
Fire, Fire! it's Time to start A Riot.
Unleash your Wings unleash your Soul.
Unleash Yourself from the Sun.
