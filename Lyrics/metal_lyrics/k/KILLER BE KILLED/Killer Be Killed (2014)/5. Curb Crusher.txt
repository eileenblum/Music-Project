Deaf, dumb, blind, paralyse, cross into the other Side.
Won't wear the Mask that slips.
Your Coffin opens and closes and pulls you in and pulls you in.

Keep searching for the wrecking Ball that's in us all rise above all that I Am.
Keep searching for the wrecking Ball that's in us all rise above all that I Am.
Crush your Demons crush I see them falling.
Crush your Demons crush I see them falling.

Blood red Eyes, desensitize, nothing left inside.
Won't wear the Mask that slips.
Your Coffin carries the Burden that pulls you in that pulls you in.

I see them falling I see them falling.
Torn between the Soul of Judgement waiting for your Life to
You follow blood against the world.
Never ask for this you follow hate.
Not anymore never ask for this waiting for your life to end!
