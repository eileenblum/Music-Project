Slay the Nemean Lion slay the Hydra.
Capture the golden of Artemis.
Fight the Erymanthian Boar.
Clean the Augean kill the Stymphalian Birds.
Constellation Strength to enter Heaven.
Killing A Fire breathing Titan.

Enslave the Cretan Bull steal the Mares of Diomedes.
Murder the Amazons defeat Geryon.
Steal the poison Apples.
Capture and bring back Cerberus.
Constellation Strength to enter Heaven.
Killing A Fire breathing Titan.

Crawl down the Path I reach the sacred Sea.
The Lion's Mouth hangs loose in front of me.
Fighting A Giant Antaeus, retrieving Alcestis Underworld.
Boil my own skin I hate the way it tastes I wake from sleep and start to walk again.
The road is long and gruelling the stone rolls back but there's no shame.
Divine Mystic Mythology hero in A Lion's Skin Prometheus.
