"Adventure for A Girl and Sister in New York City.
Life changed forever, open Mind, open Soul.
Hoping for Life changed forever."

They are fearless in the Eyes.
Run around with no Empathy for you.
You're just a Child, lost in the Dark.
Strangers drinking in the Sand-City.

Call the Wild rule the Mind enter strange Future Visions!
In remembered Dreams, I swam in Starlight.
Waking up from Sleep, I ran inside my visions.

Real Life Issues will arise.
You're Non-expressive when your Mind is blank.
I will bid good luck to you.
All Truths are filtered through your Blood.

The Air is thick of Privilege can not express an Emotion inner vision.
Save the Robots replicants!
In remembered Dreams, I swam in Starlight.
Waking up from Sleep, I ran inside my visions.
The Air is thick of Privilege can not express an Emotion inner vision!
