Music is sacred, it's for everyone.
Can not let your Government call them forbidden songs.
Born from A Generation in Defiance.
You can not kill the Beauty which your soul sings.

Catch the forbidden fire revolution's on the wire.
Scream the forbidden fire stronger than who stood before us.
War destroys and Music saves onward we prevail.
Nobody tells you you're a slave stronger than who came before us.
War destroys and Music saves onward we prevail.
No one tells you you're a slave onward we prevail.

Desire is sacred, inside you and me.
The Bond we feel universally.
This Noise is our Salvation.
Confronting this Defamation.
