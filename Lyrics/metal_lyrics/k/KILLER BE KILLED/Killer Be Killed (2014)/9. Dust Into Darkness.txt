Lock the Favour, surround Mystery.
All the while operational.
Pulling Thought from Rhythm, Melody.
Feed Desire of the Animal.

You were an Angel trapped in Time that I couldn't throw away.
Dance like A Gypsy, through the Words that I couldn't hear you say.
Covered in Sheets, I saw A Skull where I thought I'd see your Face.
Like Dust into the Darkness, nothing left, disintegrate.

Vision manifest what you are thinking.
Wrap the Song and stop questioning.
There can not be double Standard.
Wanting Peace while we are killing.

Got to kill these Demons before Dawn.
Only the Dead have seen the End of the War.
I need an Exorcist, I'm seeing the Dead.
I'm seeing the Dead.
Feed Desire of the Animal wanting Peace while we are killing.
I'm seeing the Dead.
