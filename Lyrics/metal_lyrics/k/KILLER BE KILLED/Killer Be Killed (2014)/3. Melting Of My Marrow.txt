I have to take the Turn.
Sink Hooks and Nails so I'll return...
And it could get me every Time, but I must taste Fire.
Infectious is the Flame that burns.

We are what we are death unto us all!
We are what we are death unto us all!
We are holding back the reigns we forge down the road less travelled.
I'll beware of the snake with eyes closed, revealing what's in front of me.

But I'll slow down for you...
And if you can speed up we'll both share something new.
Because I've grown tired of hiding half Truths.
Full Pictures are the harshest Ones to view...

And it felt like Time was really fast and Life was slow.
And it felt like Time was really fast and Life was slow.
Master, would you kill me if I ask you?
Reaper, let it bleed and kill me faster.
Master, in Rejection, in Affliction.
Reaper, no Protection, no Disguises.
