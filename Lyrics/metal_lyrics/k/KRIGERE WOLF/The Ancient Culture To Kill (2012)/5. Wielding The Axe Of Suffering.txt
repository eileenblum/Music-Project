Death in my eyes,
oh sacred fire of the night
dissolve the ice that
has frozen my blood.

The revelation of a dream
The victory of  the centuries,
a triumph of the soul
the passing of the spirit.

Dark complaints
beyond the giant of stone,
fear and terror
darken my sight.
Honour and glory
of the eternal thunder
aiming the âserpentâ
towards the firmament...

...the flames of hell
will pierce the cypress,
the  eternal  branch of ÃsgarÃ°r
will give me strength wielding
the axe of suffering.

Dark complaints
beyond the giant of stone,
fear and terror
darken my sight.
Honour and glory
of the eternal thunder,
wielding the axe of suffering!
