Marching towards the decease,
icy blade hammered in the heart of the armor
pierced by the omnipotence of the black seal,
deathâs moan in the arcane silence.

The war for eternal life,
triumph in the defeat, 
invoking the kingdom of death,
offering the soul to crows and wolves,
hall of died in battle.

Died in battle, 
throwing a cry of death,
the scream of the demon, 
the shade of the vultures 
itâs seen above the corpses.

Died in battle, 
dead for the glory of the eternity,
exhaling the last painful 
sigh towards immortality.

Wise son of Odin, 
accompany the perpetual road of the obscurity,
krigere wolf will narrate your verses, 
among the singing of the horses.

Died in Battle!
