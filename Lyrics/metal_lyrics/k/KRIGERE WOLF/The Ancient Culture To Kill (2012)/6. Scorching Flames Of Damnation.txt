Shadow of death is near
Demons of fire, carriers of light and obscurity,
Sing the hymn of eternal extinction.
Swords and shields  will paint the vault of heaven.

â¦.above the arcane seal of the scorching flames of damnation.

Dark lymph of Thund ,
serve as mirror to your guardians
wolves and eagles of the forest
guard the gates of eternal gloryâ¦

Dragons watch over the forests,
the mist clears the horizon from the icy waters,
a battle of miracles, war among heroes,
obeys the solemn song of the decadence.

Father, night is to end
darkness opens the entrance of torment
rain brings away my icy sweat,
allow that the brutal ferocity
become symbol of cruelty and burial.

â¦my eyes burn
pouring tears of blood.

Shadow of death is near
Demons of fire, carriers of light and obscurity,
Sing the hymn of eternal extinction.
Swords and shields will paint the vault of heaven.
