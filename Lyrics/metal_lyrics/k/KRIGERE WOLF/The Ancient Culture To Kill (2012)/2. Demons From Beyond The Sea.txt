The icy mist
of the north broken
by blazing spears
soul of the horde...
...in a long
agony through
the obscure course
of the god Neptune.

Screams of death 
are hovering between clouds, terrible night of fright,
holding the branch of blood.
Bodies floating in the cold,
faceless souls.

Darkness of fire
in a frozen storm
in the wisdom
the comfort
of a god,
invoking his name!

Demons from beyond the sea,
dragons and snakes from
the abysses among the sublime
waves of the devil.
Cemeteries without graves,
tears of suffering and sorrow,
Blood flowing inside
the sword, reveals horror.

Demons from beyond the sea,
surrounded by immense winged horses,
baptized with the blood
poured by the lowest goblet of death.
The dark empyrean,
judge of the howls
of thousand warriors, fallen
in the deafening silence of the nine worlds!
