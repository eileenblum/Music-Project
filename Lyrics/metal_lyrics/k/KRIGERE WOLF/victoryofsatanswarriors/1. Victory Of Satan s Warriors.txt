Reigns, the face of darkness
Tortuous slope toward the light of Satan
Demons opened wide the gates of the sacred Kingdom
Gods of thunder, Gods of war.

Victory of Satan's Warriors,
Marching across the shadow of death!

Smell of the warm and rotten blood among the mist of the night
Lightnings of Mjollnir illuminates the darkness
Spirits that ride in the dark caverns of the ice forest
Gods of fire, Gods of war.

Primitive holocaust, skeletons in battle
Hundreds of damned souls, they shout the victory
Dead and risen to fight.

Victory of Satan's Warriors,
Marching across the shadow of death!

Satan's Warriors....
