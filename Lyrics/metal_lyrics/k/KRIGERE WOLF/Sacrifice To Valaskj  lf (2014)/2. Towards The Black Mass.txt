Toward the black mass

The gates are just wide open to the storm,
the occultâs essence is going to start dissection,
Gungnir will elevate your damned blood,
the domination spread your darkness toward the black mass.

âWe are invoking the spirits of the fire
and you can just wait the last breath
and we are looking for nothing but your death,
we must sacrifice your soul to hellâ.

We'll cut the blood eagle for our God,
Odin!!!
We'll toast in your honor with his blood,
I believe in the memory of warrior's night,
I will always try to defend myself and fight.

With the fire in my eyes, I declare you son of death,
I raise my sword to the sky to sacrifice yourself.

âHere he is approaching, 
Wodan the stormy,
the guardian of the rainbow bridge, 
that I called with my prayers. 
I ask you, father of the runes, 
to give me the power 
to interpret your willâ.

The gates are just wide open to the storm,
the occultâs essence is going to start dissection,
Gungnir will elevate your damned blood,
the domination spread your darkness toward the black mass.
