Vision of Death!!!
Glorious and holy hills of Asgaror,
macabre frame of war,
the light of darkness and evil is setting on them
preparation of the final battle begins.

Vision of Death!!!
Sons of Muspell, giants of fire,
Gungnir, spear of ice!!!
Will feed on your blood.

Armed warriors between light and darkness,
blood feasts in the name of Odin,
the deep roots of Yggdrasil shakes the earth,
while the world is about to fire off in a long ordeal.

Sons of Muspell, giants of fire,
Gungnir, spear of ice!!!
Will feed on your blood.

Son of Borr,
wielding your spear,
tear the black soul of Surtur,
the mist will heal your wounds.
