Blood to the wolves

Between the obsessive darkness, wolves in feast,
together to the souls into the mist,
and my darkness can watch over the universe,
around damned spirits over the fighterâs curse.

Blood to the wolves, you can see the force of no god,
frozen atmosphere from the breath of Yggdrasilâs roots.

Look at the light with his eyes blacked out,
impaled body and soul will be brought,
in the realm where only the damned dare to enter,
no mercy for the glory of your defender.

Blood to the wolves, you can see the force of no god
frozen atmosphere from the breath of Yggdrasilâs roots.

Haunting and glacial wolves, thirsting of your blood,
howl sitting in front of your grave, acclaiming your transition,
looking up at the full moon, shines the flame of Odin God,
the protector of the warriors who living to the underworld.

Through the murmur of the wind, Odin breathes and keeps the leaves 
fall and decompose and then reborn in the form of nourishment for the earth, 
and I see him hanging at 'tree of knowledge, and listening to his song 
that instills in my heart the sacred fury and the force of the wolves.

Wolves take this blood and make it the fruit of your divine strength,
your shadow will spread the darkness of your occult desecration.

Between the obsessive darkness, wolves in feast,
together to the souls into the mist,
and my darkness can watch over the universe
around damned spirits over the fighterâs curse.
