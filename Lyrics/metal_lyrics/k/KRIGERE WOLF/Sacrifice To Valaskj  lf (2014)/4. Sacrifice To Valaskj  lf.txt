Sacrifice to ValaskjÃ lf

Marked and desecrated by
the infinite of dark lord inside 
the reflect of his face on the sword,
obscuring the vision of the world.

Suffering and agony,
raising the skull to the sky,
the silence is announcing that
the victim of sacrifice will reside forever.

Now, I see in front of me,
the altar of hate and meat,
sacrifice to ValaskiÃ lf,
the end of life and your useless past.

Ritual of the seven calices of blood!
Captured and sacrificed to feed the wolves!

Scream of conquest,
shedding the blood in your honour,
wise warlord, 
the face of death in your eyes.

Marked and desecrated by
the infinite of dark lord inside 
the reflect of his face on the sword,
obscuring the vision of the world.

Now, I see in front of me,
the altar of hate and meat
sacrifice to ValaskiÃ lf,
the end of life and your useless past.

Ut anima mea receptaculum roboris tui fecundum sit...
