The end has a beginning

This is the march 
towards the end of time,
in wich the wind will take away the souls 
floating in the darkness wild,
voices that speak of the fighter's glorious rides.
The voice of the trees 
and the light of the fire 
will oversee the sleepers 
in the night of the revelation. 
The mind will cross the universe, 
riding the waves of the oceans
will dominate the world, 
fire torches lit to celebrate the triumph 
of the swords and shields,
inside the caves 
where you can smell the warm blood
and the cold and the darkness 
never cease to exist.
Wolves in feast for their father, 
dominant in the sacred battle in Ragnarok.
Wolves will be quenched 
by the blood of the giants, 
defeated by the absolute power 
of the omnipotent.
The sky will open toward a new universe, 
the end will have a beginning.
The Valkyries will bring the winners 
into the black seal, 
the mountains will be glorified
and rivers of blood will flow 
through the forests of the north, 
between the prayers 
and the mist of the night.
