In absentia without sound
Attribute wisdom to a small tongue
Breathe in stale air to heal all wounds
We see the end
We see the end
See the same lines and where they divide
Feeds on itself the weakness collides
Too late for thought when it's ignored
We see the end before it begins
Blood of ignorance continues to reign
It's automatic the process the gain
On silent hands with silent demands
We see the end
We see the end
Procrastination has failed again
Imperfection as a guise
We see the end
