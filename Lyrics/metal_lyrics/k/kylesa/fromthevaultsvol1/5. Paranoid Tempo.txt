All the pictures they remind me
Of a time I took for granted
In the photo of a memory
Finds the death of reality
You told me that life moves too fast
What I wish for you is your life to last
As the days sway closer to the end
Going faster
Going faster
Try to hold on
At the cusp of the day closer to the end
Going faster
Going faster
Try to hold on
