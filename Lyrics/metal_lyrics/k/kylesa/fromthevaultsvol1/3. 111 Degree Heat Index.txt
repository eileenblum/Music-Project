Two steps backwards for everyone forward
I haven't heard it all nor have I seen it
This heart on my sleeve beats no more
I'm not getting older I'm just weathered
Past and future are in a fist fight
I don't care which wins competition is boring
Ego don't fail me now they love confidence
Intuition strikes again fueling paranoia
This summer heat can't make me sweat
I have too many shadows to hover over me
Have no control
