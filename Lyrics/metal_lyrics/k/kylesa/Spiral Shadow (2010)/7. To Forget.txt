To be denied, not justified
Can't decide which way to turn
You're fucking with my mind and taking all my time
And yet, I do it to you

What you're doing ain't right
When I fight the time
And I hold it to you
Keep the fire going with the burn you give
But I just want to forget

I try to clear my mind
Trying to read your kind
Inside this feeling ain't right
If you care to know, I find it all the same
And now I'm moving on
