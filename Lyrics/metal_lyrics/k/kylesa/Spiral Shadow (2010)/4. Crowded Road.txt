Hey, listen...

A crowded road ends before it begins
Struggle to survive, hands try to grasp
If told like it is, who will listen?
A crowded road ends before it begins

[Repeat previous verse]

Pages and pages of rambling
Expectations when there are none
Tricks put to use
Traded, awaited
Abated, deflated
A crowded road ends before it begins
