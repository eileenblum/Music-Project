Keyed up, all tore up
Free from thought, walking backwards
Tranquil anxiety
Refraining from walking backwards
Reverse and rewind
Contemplate moving forward
Regrets indicate, moving forth is walking backwards

We tread a long time
On occasion, on the line
Swaying, weighing
Straying from this tired climb
