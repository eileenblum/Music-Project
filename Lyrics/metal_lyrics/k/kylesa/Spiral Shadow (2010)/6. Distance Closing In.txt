Let down again
Walls fade away
Distance closing in
Another time delay

Focus my eyes
Never ending space
Listen to lies
Last in the race
The dream of gold
I've heard before
From a tale once told
Was bought and sold

We chase pretty lies
Devotion starts to die
My step is off, when will I fly?

And we chase these pretty lies
