Try and concentrate
Brain is melting
Walking in a daze
Security of isolation

Always shifting, back and forth

Blueprint within
Light to be switched
Voices unspoken
Sounds unheard

Always shifting, back and forth

Calm, but no peace
Race without a prize
Youth faded too fast
Reset this life

Always shifting, back and forth

We all fade out
