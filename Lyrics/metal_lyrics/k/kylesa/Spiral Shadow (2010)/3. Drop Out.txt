Tell yourself it's not worth knowing
Erase yourself and you'll find something

Truth that doesn't fit
A curse of inspiration
Try to stay afloat
Too much information
Bow and take an exit
Face vacant destination
Disappointment won't console
There is no celebration

Name I'm shaken
Blame I've taken

It's not alright
Because I'm dropping out
I'm telling you to count me out

Truth that doesn't fit
A curse of inspiration
Try to stay afloat
Too much information
Bow and take an exit
Face vacant destination
Disappointment won't console
There is no celebration
