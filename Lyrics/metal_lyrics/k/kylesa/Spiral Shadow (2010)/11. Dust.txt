All the blank faces walking around us
They mean nothing
Candles in the dark
Every speck of dust in this universe, floating around us
Candles in the dark

Every speck of dust in this universe, floating around us
Candles in the dark
Every mistake I've made, I would make again
If that is what it took to be where I am
