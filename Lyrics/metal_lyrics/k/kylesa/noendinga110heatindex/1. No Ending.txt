I can no longer see
The future that holds us is dark inside
This skin is binding me
Decisions leak, fall and divide
Burning hands around my throat
Numbness quickens, lessons and hides
Factor finding antidote
Stabbing sharpness has no guise
Run inside to run outside
Look both ways but it's all the same
Ending search to an ending game
Dead gestures and languid lies
Answers are rooted but pass right by
Run inside
Faster now
An ending search
A pending game
Without answers we carry the blame
Look both ways but it's all the same
Ending search to an ending game
Dead gestures and languid lies
Run inside...
