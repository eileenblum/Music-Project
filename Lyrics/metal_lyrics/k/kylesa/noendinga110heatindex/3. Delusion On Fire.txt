Why do you father (the dreams of escape)
The institutions of tomorrow (leaving others behind)
Blanket costs cover me (delusions on fire) is the answer on TV?
Images constantly embedded in our heads
Consumption abuse fueling the greed
What is enough the question to be asked
Slaving away for things we don't need
Can't catch a glance without being force fed
Someone's educated lies used in attempt
Marketing ploys hope to persuade
A hapless victim no one's exempt
The grip of your conviction (the dream of escape)
Ensures a lasting impression (delusion of fire)
We must no depend on what rich men will defend
We're so stuffed we can not breathe
The lies that are told have emptied our souls
Never are we allowed to think without thoughts of consumption
Delusion on fire
