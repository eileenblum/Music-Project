Try to control the impossible
Two steps backwards for every one forward
This heart on my sleeve beats no more
I'm not getting older I'm just weathered
Past and future are in a fistfight
I don't care which wins competition is boring
Ego don't fail me now they love confidence
Intuition strikes again fueling paranoia
This summer heat can't make me sweat
I have too many shadows to hover over me
