Ever wonder why we fail
Steady breakdown of your free will
Determination is undermind
Crack the shell, it's made of glass
Did your really think that it could last
I don't think so
Crack the shell, it's made of glass
We all hoped that it would last
What a let down
You were determined to prevail
Primal instinct not to fail
Steady breakdown and loss of free will
