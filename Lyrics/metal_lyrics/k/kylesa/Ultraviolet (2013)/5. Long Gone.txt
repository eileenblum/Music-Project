What you see clearly right here before me
Sounding reflection or a mirage
You've lost yourself
Trusted relation with trepidation
What were you thinking when you stole the sun
We have been broken in darkness unspoken
Your tears are flying a purchased disguise 
What you see clearly right here before me
Sounding reflection or a mirage
You've lost yourself
