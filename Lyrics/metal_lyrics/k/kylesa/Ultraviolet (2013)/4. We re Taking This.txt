What knowledge do you hold 
that hasn't been bought or sold?
Trick tip to the times ahead
Influence is limited
Pushed down and beaten
The underdog bites back
Herds of sheeps are crowding around
False prophet's repeating sound
We play this how we want
To your bullshit juggernaut
Can't draw a straight line
With a shaking hand
Filling up space
With a sharpened edge
Watch from the sidelines
Then walk away
Say fuck it all
Then walk away
What goes around comes back around
