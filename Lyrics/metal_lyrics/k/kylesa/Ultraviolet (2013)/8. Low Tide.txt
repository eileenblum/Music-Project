It's on again
It's off again
Where did it Begin
When does it end
I thought it was over, but
It is still not the end
All we have is right now
We'll watch the clouds turn inside out
If the sun doesn't rise
That's fine I don't Mind
It's ok I prefer siting in the dark anyway
It's winter, it's low tide
Let's hang for awhile
And watch the world die
On the last day we were alive
