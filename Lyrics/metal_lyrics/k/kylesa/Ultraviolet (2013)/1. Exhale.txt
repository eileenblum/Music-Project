Watching your back, detractors everywhere
Speaking as loud as humanly possible
Earful of whispers, hearsay and rumors
Opinions too many beating down your door

It's your own fault
Choose your own truth

There is no validity 
or any actuality
Just a morbidity
Loss of all capacity
