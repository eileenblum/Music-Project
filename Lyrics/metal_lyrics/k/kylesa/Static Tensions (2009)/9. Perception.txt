Years of thought trapped inside
An unstable judgement
Perception of severity
Insidious eye
Without sight
Crossing wires
Perception of severity
We are together never alone
Some other time
Place my hand unto you
Feel no shame
Hover and suffer
Over one
Lost ending soul
One reason to fall
Is to rise
Break down, break down
One false move
Everything changes
No second chance
