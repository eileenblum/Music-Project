Immersed in confusion
Drag out this unwillingly
This soundwave is paused
Uneducated adornment
Agenda of truth
It is a lie
There is none
Fact or fiction
In between
We want to build
An explanation of contradiction
Spinning wheels
Unwelcome home
Do not smile
It's not prescribed
Momentary hallucination
Well adjusted
The new insane
