Locked into moments seen through and through
Like darkness shining on you revealing and weeping
I try to
Try to see things through and through
As darkness cloaks the sun I seem the only one
Brick anchors in wet sand
Carry through tomorrow's end
Lines of life carving hands
Clear the patch, claim the land
