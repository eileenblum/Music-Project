Welcome mats to an abandoned life
A mailbox with too many numbers
A package sent and returned
A message without meaning
Try to turn it off
Too few words to express
Lonely even with company
Circumstance of knowing nothing else

Looking for deception where it doesn't exist
Exposing myths at every chance
Disqualify what should matter
Try to turn it off
Too few few words to express
Lonely even with company
Circumstance of knowing nothing else
