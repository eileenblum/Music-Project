Fogged windows
Tattered panes
Beneath the surface
Hear the rain
Forget what's gone
It's in the past
You're future notice:
Make it last

Dragged through sunken earth
Eyes closed from birth
Tightened grip
Hold the strain
Tightened grip
Drowned in vain

Too late to assume
Dragged through
Too late to assume

Friend or foe - some days are both
Eyes closed from birth
Lie and truth - some are never told
Eyes closed from birth
Right or wrong - I choose the latter
Eyes closed from birth
Kneel down and listen to the ground
Eyes closed from birth

Fogged windows
Shattered panes
Beneath the surface
Hear the rain
To be broken
To be in doubt
To be withdrawn
To be without

Cave in to atrophy
Air is tight and gray
Rust is apparent
Spectacles of wear
Acid in the air
