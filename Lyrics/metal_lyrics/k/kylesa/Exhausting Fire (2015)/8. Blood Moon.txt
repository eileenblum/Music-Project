This is the longest winter that I have ever known
What happened to the summer
She was fleeting, a throwing stone
Time apart has been unkind
So we break on a dotted line
Didn't pause the move before
Contradicting closing door
We often start over
We often start again
The sun won't save us this time
But the moon will rule my sin
Time apart has been unkind
So we break on a dotted line
