I don't ever want to feel again
I don't ever want to heal again
That's where I find that my soul is crushing
Ah Ah I don't ever need to feel again
I don't ever want to heal again
That's where I find that my soul is crushing
The earth beneath us was ours for a while
The rain stopped for us and colors smiled
Parade into a dark room with tangled lines
Scattered footsteps scattered and defined
I can see you in the days night sun
Puling me into you, aligning one
Ice blue center focus so warm
Diving deep a flash of forlorn
I don't ever want to feel again
I don't ever want to heal again
I don't ever need to ever feel again
I don't need to ever heal again
