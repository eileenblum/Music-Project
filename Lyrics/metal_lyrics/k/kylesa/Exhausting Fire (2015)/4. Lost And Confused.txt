A distant silence
A distant far away flavor
Causing me to spin therein once again
Who is using another bad decision
A memento left again from another muse
Who is using who coming unhinged
Running on fumes from another muse
Once more can't stay
Once more must leave
Once more another rear view of you
Who is using who coming unhinged
Illusions of bliss from another muse
Who is using who stomach in knots
Finger on my pulse from another muse
Two souls lost and confused with nothing to lose
Two souls lost and confused with everything to lose
