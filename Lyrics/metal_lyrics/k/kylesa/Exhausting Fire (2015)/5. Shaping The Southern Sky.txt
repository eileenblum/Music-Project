I am gonna throw caution to the wind
Gonna take a chance again
There was no other way around it
And I won't deny it
Shaping the southern sky
I am gonna throw caution to the wind
Gonna take a chance again
What wasn't a part of the plan
Was written in the sand
We'll take the tide
Shaping the southern sky
This southern sky surrounds us
This southern sky is glowing
This southern sky surrounds you and I
