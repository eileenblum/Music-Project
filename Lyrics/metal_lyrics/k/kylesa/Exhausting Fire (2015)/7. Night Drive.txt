I don't want to be on this night drive
I would rather be anywhere else
I don't want to be on this drive
I would rather be anywhere else
Lights racing by nothing but time to think
Turn up the music subdue the noise
I heard there was a nice place down the street
Because anywhere has this place beat
Driving at night a false sense of peace
Lights racing by nothing but time to think
Ride it out
