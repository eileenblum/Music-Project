Looks good in a picture loose on the wall
Better than right now
It's what I've found in a soul unwound
Better than right now
Leaped off the ground only to fall
Better than right now
If I could grow roots and stay around by your side
If I could grow roots I would stay here and never leave but now is not the time
I would grow roots but I can't slow down or I might crash
I wish I could go back in time
