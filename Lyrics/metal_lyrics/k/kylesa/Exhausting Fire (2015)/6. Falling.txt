When we ride a fever at night
I don't care at all
When I drive my shadow at night
Got you at a crawl
I remember yesterday
We were flying high in the sky
Look at me now turn away
This is goodbye
When we shared our dreams at night
Heart in hand I call
Unknown forces conflicting insight
I'm not ready to fall
When I drive my shadow at night
Heart in hand I call
When my shadow tells me it's right
I'm ready to fall
