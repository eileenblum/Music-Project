Dew soaked ring
Dawn's first light
Speak no sound
Blinders strapped on tight

Down

Caged reflections
Staring back
Ritual begins
Caught in the grips of dawn

Down

Dusk arrives
Rising up again
Blinder fade away
Life starts now

Dew soaked ring
Dawn's first light

Sleep it off, forget the rest
Form a new reality where you always come out on top
In sleep everyone wins at your command
You are in control here
There is no fury here

Awaked yet comatosed
Glimmer of hope remains
Dream of the freedom to come
Pray for a sunset at dawn
Answers lie in the sky
Cycle of rains has begun

Cycle of rains is complete
Sky breathes life into me
Grips of dawn fall astray
Sunset at dawn has arrived

Dream of the freedom to come
Pray for a sunset at dawn
