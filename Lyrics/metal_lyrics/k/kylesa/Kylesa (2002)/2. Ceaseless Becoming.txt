Look away, to return
Start again, never learn
Past echoes, ears bleed
Eyes blind, fires feed

Circle turns
Cycle set
Square one again
Life burns your regress
Becomes ceaseless

Lock step, hold the line
Never ask, burning time
Feeding in, giving up
Before death, life stopped

Circle runs
Cycle ends
Life burns your regress
Become ceaseless

It is now, yesterday and tomorrow
Tomorrow, yesterday, now

Time is a continuum
A ceaseless becoming

Face forward, echo stops
Cycle breaks, line drops
Eyes open, salient thought
Ceaseless becoming
What is not

Time is a continuum
A Ceaseless becoming
