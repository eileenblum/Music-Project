Trampled down
Sacred ground

Pick up the pieces
Just to get cut
You've got to laugh
It's fun to watch

Built from ruins

Bleed all over the floor
Roll around in it
Feel your insides outside
Know your system

Scarab will sustain

Decayed roots
Grow again

Is this the twilight
The days of new
Can you feel the presence
Shining down on you

Built from ruins
Scarab will sustain

Scarab builds again

Built from scratch
Scarab reigns
