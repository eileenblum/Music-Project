This is the last time
That I will ever regret
The things that I have said
The things that I have done

No Regrets, No remorse

I harvest all my thoughts
And ask the questions why
Yet everything comes back to me unclear

Take it all and give nothing
Unless it's out of a guilty conscious
What we're supposed to feel
Like the turning of a bent wheel

I asked all the right questions
The answers all were wrong
The karma of my life
Has come around again

Burnt by my sins
