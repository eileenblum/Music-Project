There has been a warning
That I have ignored
Lost track of all the times Iâve watched everything unfold
A million times I must have thought itâs not my problem
Flags on the sidelines wave in distress
Wonât let me forget Iâm overwhelmed by forgiveness
Weighing. Numbing. Sinking. Burning.
Why did you even bother? Why did you even try?
Neglect fact until it becomes fiction
I canât feel, couldnât feel it even when the rain began to fall
I am lost in another sea of thought
Where the water burns my flesh
Weighing. Numbing. Sinking. Burning.
