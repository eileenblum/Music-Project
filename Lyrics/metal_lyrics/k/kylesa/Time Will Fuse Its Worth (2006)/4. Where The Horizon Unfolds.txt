Night - eroding the stones of man
Flight - within the psyche of man
Cry out - dead matter awakes
Shadows - of past self awake

Outside - world spins your fate
No guide - demise of spirit awaits
Fight - futile attempts of man
In sight - the fertile grip of man

When does the tunnel fucking end?

Fallen times and relics speak
Truths of the strong and weak
History repeating with a laugh
We all want what we can't have

I can't find another way
Can't find another way
Where does the horizon unfold?
Where does it break away?
When does the tunnel end?..
