Rats on a telephone line
Run fast my window at night
This is my view. Same scenery. Nothing new
Thought weâd escape societyâs trap
Chased a dream. Caught a nightmare
Once possibilities seemed endless
Good intentions. Ruined lives
Haunting memories unfolding around me
Dirt in my nails from digging my own grave
Ignore anger. Settle with fear
Temperature is rising fast
Bugs infesting our hope again
This is my view. Same scenery. Nothing new
Fate does its job unfolding around me
Haunting memories always hang around
