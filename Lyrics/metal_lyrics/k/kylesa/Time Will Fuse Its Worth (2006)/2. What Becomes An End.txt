Past is desperate for a future so it can have its own place
Why do we fight for a future? Is it for the human race?
Where is the alliance of truth and moral progress?
Into a time of mindless oblivion we regress!
Time will fuse its worth - rising from the earth
New birth wills it fight - dawn of time ignites
We can think of the past without reference to the future
But we can't think of the future without reference to the past
No one is around for recollection, it's only frozen in time
Fate pulling in different directions within our unconscious mind
What becomes an end - will start a new origin
Unborn of any trace - shift past this steady pace
Dawn of time ignites - new birth wills its fight
Rising from the earth - time will fuse its worth
If we ignore our existence, then we become slaves.
To our own ignorance; we are slaves!
Past is desperate for a future so it can have its own place
Why do we fight for our future? Is it for the human race?
Dawn of time ignites - New birth wills its fight
