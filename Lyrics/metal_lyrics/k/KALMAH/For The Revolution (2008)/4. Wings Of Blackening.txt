Hey Mr.Charles where are you now?
Knocking at the heaven's door
But there's no-one around?
Standing behind your theory
That a man comes from an ape?
Or can't you see all that God has created?

Antichrists among us, teasing you up
Material world god questioning your heart
Stand firm in you faith, remember to pray
Secret of life, leave it all to Christ

Master lead me, please, in through your door
Pierce this willing ear just one more time
Please let me stay, I'll work like a slave
I will suffer, obey

Hey Mr.Adolf where are you now?
Trying to find the path to the light in vain?
Standing behind your theory of inequality?
Or can't you see all that God has created?

Demons of sin fly with the wings of blackening
Pulling faces at you

Hey Mr.Vladimir where are you now?
Standing behind your theory of ideology?
Where have gone all you ideas now?
Or can't you see all that God has created?

Demons of sin fly with the wings of blackening
Pulling faces at you
