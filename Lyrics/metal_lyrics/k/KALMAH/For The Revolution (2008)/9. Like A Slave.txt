A sheet of paper wet by your sweat
Among the others scattered on your desk
Unstable market just can't wait
You moral is now at stake

And you know behind the closed doors
They're watching you
What is your real share?
Are you the one they want to fill
up their pockets?
Or are you simply worth nothing?

Smile, obey, behave, educate
Do what they tell you to do
Like a slave - Hiiohei!

Meanwhile I'm drilling a hole
Through the ice
Surrounded by white infinity
You're keep on rolling in your tread wheel
My friend, why don't you just follow me?

And you know behind the closed doors
They're watching you
What is your real share?
Are you the one they want to fill
up their pockets?
Or are you simply worth nothing?

Smile, obey, behave, educate
Do what they tell you to do
Like a slave - Hiiohei!
