Time crawls and time flies
Seasons wave when they're passing by
I'm walking along the shore
Wondering is this true or dream?

Now when world is covered with blood
Everything is filled with nothingness
The smoke has covered the sky
And the scene is filled with blackness

Production spitting shit
Into this God's gift
Consequences are taking us
We don't care future is here

The energy policy is just a word
Just a tool in a political battle
Time is right but who has got he key
That'll open the sky for the sun to gleam

Warnings and threats fall on deaf ears
Wilderness screams, it cries for help
And from his throne God is watching
The world with empty eyes

Up towards the sky
I send me prayer and
I want her to survive
But without the light she dies

And the cancer is wasting her lungs
I can feel that but I still stay hopeless
And the smoke in the sky won't dispel
And God is too busy to give a damn

Warnings and threats fall on deaf ears
Wilderness screams, it cries for help
And from his throne God is watching
The world with empty eyes

Up towards the sky
I send me prayer and
I want her to survive
But without the light she dies
