Tonight I'll see the line of thousand ghosts
Those once were alive behind my eyes
And I'm on the crossfire of my manic thoughts
Under the yoke of the hidden evil

Why did you follow my footsteps?
Why did you present yourself against me?

Now I have to run, I have to leave behind
The things I've done
Over the plains, over the mountain tops
Covered with snow, to the unknown, into the
Foreign lands there shall I go
But I know they're after me and it is my time to bleed

Those restless dreams keep on teasing
I can see your eyes just before you died
And the blood red scar between my shoulder blades
It is making me mad

Dead man's shadow wavering above me
Dead man's shadow a restless soul haunting me

Now I have to run, I have to leave behind
The things I've done
Over the plains, over the mountain tops
Covered with snow, to the unknown, into the
Foreign lands there shall I go
But I know they're after me and it is my time to bleed

Those restless dreams keep on teasing
I can see your eyes just before you died
And the blood red scar between my shoulder blades
It is making me mad

Dead man's shadow wavering above me
Dead man's shadow a restless soul haunting me
