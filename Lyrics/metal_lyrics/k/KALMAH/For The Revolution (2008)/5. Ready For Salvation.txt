Desperate cry of a child
Who only wants to live
An innocent human being
Deprived of all his dreams

Painful faces of the others
Who once were the chosen
Innocent eyes of the child
Never going to see

The voice of crystal children
Of deaf ears it has fallen
And the preacher delivers a sermon
But who's ready for salvation

Remembrance behind the scene
Of unjustice and injustice
In the forsaken faces
Expression of frustration

The voice of crystal children
Of deaf ears it has fallen
And the preacher delivers a sermon
But who's ready for salvation
