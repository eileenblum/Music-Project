To the mighty star, to all its people, to the mankind
And to all true believers
You have known your brother and your leader
You know he never bowed to the despots

The dark cloud wavering in the sky
Pushed forward with ill-willed wind
Underneath walks a man having a dream
Wants to teach us his own way to live
Forgiveness is the word that he spreads
Through the barrels of the guns he have made
Entire world he wants to obey
And more power for himself to take

What does he want from us? What is the reason?
To occupy and to conquer, in the name of freedom?
We don't need his principle in revolt we shall rise
Soon he will notice that no-one converts us

The protest marchers fill up all the streets
Soon will bleed in the hands of police
The peaceful riot dispersed by the fire
In our eyes burning bright we will fight
So my brother, reach out your hand
And receive the true meaning of faith
The seed of the war has been planted
Stand firm

For the Revolution
We rise, We die

Amber lights illuminate all guns blazing
I am the whip of God lashing you down
This land that yesterday leaked nectar
Now nothing but a battlefield opened wounds
bleeding

I can smell the gun oil in my hands
When I'm taking away empty shells
I can see someone falling down dead
So the game is about to begin
Our faith is our bedrock
We shall not give up till we drop
And we wonder, we cannot understand
The meaning

For the Revolution
We rise, We die
