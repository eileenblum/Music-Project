State of the world today
Nothing but the same
Violence and disgrace
And no-one to blame

A murder on a TV-screen
The adults playing their game
PlayStation controls children's lives
As they grow up they'll do the same

I sing - you sing - we all sing
Holy Symphony of War

Fearful thoughts hide in people's minds
Control those who can't deny
Under the patronage of steel
The great man is turning the wheel

Behind the scenery of abundance
No-one hates more than the poor
The scribe are spreading the word
Declare the peace in the name of war

I sing - you sing - we all sing
Holy Symphony of War
