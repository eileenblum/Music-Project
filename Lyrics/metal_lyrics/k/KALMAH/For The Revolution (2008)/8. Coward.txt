Oh dear mother why did you give me a birth
I didn't ask to be born
Oh dear father can't you see what you've done
I'm not the one you wanted me to become

A coward I am and a good-for-nothing
Still I can walk over you
When my head is down and I'm in distress
Moonshine is my gentle mistress

A drunkard I am and a yokel, too
Still I can walk over you
My hand is poor and I have to bluff
But cheating to win is not even enough

Walking alone, testing the water
Hiding skeletons in my closet

A coward, a drunkard, a withdrawn, a stranger

What the hell
I feel no shame
What the hell
I feel no shame

So dear mother why did you give me a birth
I didn't ask to be born
So dear father can't you see what you've done
I'm not the one you wanted me to become

Walking alone, testing the water
Hiding skeletons in my closet

A coward, a drunkard, a withdrawn, a stranger
