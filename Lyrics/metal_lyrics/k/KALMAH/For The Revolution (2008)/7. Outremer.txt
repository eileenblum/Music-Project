Outremer overseas
The kingdom of Christianity
The crusaders in their holy war
Fighting for their Templar lords

For the crown or for the cross
Deus Vult! Shall they shout
Three points of view nothing else to do
But submit or rule

Outremer overseas
Religious game played by the kings
Piety or arrogance
The reasons for hypocrisy

For the crown or for the cross
Deus Vult! Shall they shout
Three points of view nothing else to do
But submit or rule

Jerusalem - the powder keg
Lying at our Fathers feet
The inferior holding the light
That shall burn the sky

We are the fuse we are the fuel
What can we do to stop the fire?
The answer will be found from our brains
Not from the books or from the tales

Jerusalem - the powder keg
Lying at our Fathers feet
The inferior holding the light
That shall burn the sky
