[Music is by Antti Kokko, lyrics are by Pekka Kokko]

The morning light
Will guide you huntsman
On your way back
Through the darkest woods
Of the remoteness
So follow the track
But where are you going to?
Do you have a home?
You step on an endless path
Can't way the way out

Roam, roam
And it will find you
Trace, trace
And you will find it
Lapse lapse
And it will take you
Yield, yield
Into the black marsh

In the shade of death you ramble
And you don't know where
In circles may you wander
Your mind gets tense
By now you will be needed
Your mother calls
Into her arms you wanna fall
And let it all go
But where are you going to?
Do you have a home?
You step on an endless path
Can't way the way out

Roam, roam
And it will find you
Trace, trace
And you will find it
Lapse, lapse
And it will take you
Yield, yield
Into the black marsh
