[Music is by Antti Kokko, lyrics are by Pekka Kokko]

The sky is red
The sun is dead
The dusk descends
So raw my friend

Water horsetails
Are standing still
The trident is waiting
For something to kill

Through the shallow waters
The dugout slowly glides
The birchbark in the prow
Is burning bright

Around the shaft of the trident
The callow hand is pressing
Before the deadly strike
The sky is falling down

In the pouring rain there is the end
Only the dark remains
Nothing will stay

The sky is black
Death has struck
The dark prevails
Gone is my friend

Water horsetails
Are standing still
The trident is waiting
For something to kill

Through the shallow waters
The empty dugout glides
Filled with heavy water
To the other side
