[Music is by Antti Kokko, lyrics are by Pekka Kokko]

Once again you're standing there
With the brightest shine above your head
I see your eyes, I see your smile
Take me away written in your sign

I walk to you with my arms spread
And nothing else moves in my hand
I feel the touch of your cold skin
Can't feel alive before I take you in

Love is for sale

I found my love
From the clearance sale
My brand new love
Straight from the shelf

Love is for sale

I found my love
From the clearance sale
My brand new love
Straight from the shelf

Take me away
Take me away
She said take me away
Take me away
