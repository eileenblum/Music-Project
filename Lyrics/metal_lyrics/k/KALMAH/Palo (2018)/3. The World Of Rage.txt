[Music is by Antti Kokko, lyrics are by Pekka Kokko]

Ask my friend
Ask what you want
Ask, ask, ask but
Do not questionize

Hear my friend
Hear what you want
Listen, listen, listen
The voice of heart

Lord's not dead
Not dead yet
We say and we pray

This is the declaration
This is the call
For you my friend to join
To join our pride

Come along my friend,come
And join the pride
Escalate my friend,fight
For the world of rage

Walk my friend
Walk with me
Walk, walk, walk but
Do not traipse

Hail my friend
Hail with me
Praise, praise, praise
Do not abase

Lord is blind
And so are we
We're blind
Why do we cry?

Together we build it
We'll get it done
We'll have the better world
The world of rage

Kill, eat, sleep, repeat
Kill, eat, sleep, repeat

Come along my friend,come
And join the pride
Escalate my friend,fight
For the world of rage
