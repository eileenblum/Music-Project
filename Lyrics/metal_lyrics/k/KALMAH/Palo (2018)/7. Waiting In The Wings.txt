[Music and lyrics are by Pekka Kokko]

Do you still remember me?
I used to be your sweetest dream
I'm still holding you in my head
Dreaming up until I'm dead

Time flies so fast
Future is the past
Life is on the run
But where's all the fun?

I've played all my cards
One way out but not to the stars
I only have this single fare
Like I think that you will care

It was your lust
That took away the trust
It was not me
Who killed the feel

Bye bye my dear
Live long in fear
This love's not true
Away with you

Nevertheless
I'm waiting in the wings for you
So confess
I'll trace the truth of you

Bye bye my dear
Live long in fear
This love's not true
Away with you

Nevertheless
I'm waiting in the wings for you
So confess
I'll trace the truth out of you
