[Music is by Antti Kokko, lyrics are by Pekka Kokko]

Throughout these years
That I've been searching
I have not found
The golden mean
I've travelled so far
I've turned all stones
All that in vain

What is the reason?
What is the cause?
Why all the true things
Seem to be false?
Just let the wind blow
And let me walk
So I shall follow
The copper hawk

I'm lost - guide me
Show me where to go

I am so stuck
Can't solve the riddle
I'm so helpless
Can't find my paystreak

I'm lost - guide me
Show me where to go

I am so stuck
Can't solve the riddle I'm so helpless
Can't find my paystreak
