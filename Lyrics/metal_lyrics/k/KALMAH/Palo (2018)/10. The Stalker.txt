Against the wintry scene
I see your silhouette
And all the joy the I fell
Comes crashing down on you
It brakes you, it shakes you
It makes you come to me
It makes me come to you

I will be merciless
So you won't ask for a thing
You can't just hide from me
I am you truest dream
It breaks you, it shakes you
It makes you come to me
It breaks me, it shakes me
It makes me come to you

The stalker awaits you
The walker behind you
The stalker awaits you
The joker who takes you

So close your eyes and say goodbye
The last farewell before the end

The stalker awaits you
The walker behind you
The stalker awaits you
The joker who takes you
