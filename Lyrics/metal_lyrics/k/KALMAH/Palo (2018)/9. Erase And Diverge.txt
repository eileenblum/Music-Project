[Music and lyrics are by Pekka Kokko]

Time after time
You change your mind
I belong to you
But I just can't break through
I'm stuck in your net
Woven from your thread
Poisoned by your spell
Drowned in your well

Again I feel the strike
From your icy heat
One more bleeding wound
To refine

I believed in god of love
But found a mockery
Of false divinity
And hypocrisy
But there's no progress
Without a compromise
Nor victory
Without a sacrifice

Once again I try to run
Once again I try to come
Banging my head into the wall
Nothingness bears my call

Erase and diverge
Erase and diverge

Once again I try to run
Once again I try to come
Banging my head into the wall
Nothingness bears my call

Erase and diverge
Erase and diverge
