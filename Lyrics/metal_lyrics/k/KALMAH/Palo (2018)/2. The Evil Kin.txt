[Music is by Antti Kokko, lyrics are by Pekka Kokko]

Evil Kin, is it a sin?
To be born, out of love.
Lethal Code, in the blood.
Heritance, to recall.

The Devil's lash, around your neck.
Winding up, to the left.
Deception, of our kind.
In the blood of Jesus Christ.

As The Devil Calls!
They Can't Resist!
Those People Whose!
Names Are On His List!

All shall praise the evil kin!
All shall praise the evil kin!

Evil Kin, is it a sin?
To exist, or to breed.
The Genome, that belongs to all.
An Ingenious, trap to fall.

And the Winner, will be drawn.
In a lottery, that pleases us all.
And We just, can't resist.
Otherwise, we won't exist.

Hip Hip Hooray!
Glory To The Human race!
Hip Hip Hooray!
Glory To The Human race!

As The Devil Calls!
They Can't Resist!
Those People Whose!
Names Are On His List!

All shall praise the evil kin!
All shall praise the evil kin!
All shall praise the evil kin!
All shall praise the evil kin!
