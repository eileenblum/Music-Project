A man -highest in rank
Always commands
Obeys the will
Of the mighty word

Wealth is all he wants to reach
Don' t give a damn to our land

[Chorus:]
He cannot see what is happening in our world
Our system falls by his hand
Conqueror' s end

With toxic waste master creates
Catastrophies that lead to the end

A biowar man never can win
Technology his only reward

[Chorus]

Twisted creation of mankind

[Chorus]
