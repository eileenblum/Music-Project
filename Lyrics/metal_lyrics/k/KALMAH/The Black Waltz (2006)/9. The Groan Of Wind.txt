The groan of wind a hiding deadly disease
A killer that hides in the wind
And cannot be seen
A powerful enemy a threat that truly exists
By a hair hung our lives
We see that but weÂ´re blind

Ever-transforming, reproductive, worldwide pandemic
Our time is running out
The clock is striking on
And in spite of our drugs
WeÂ´ll stay powerless

[Chorus:]
The groan of wind
A silent killing machine
ThereÂ´s no place we can breathe
Deep down in our lungs symptom breeds

H5N1 Lethal time bomb
H5N1 Lethal time bomb

Maybe we have earned our urns
We cannot endlessly breed
Our scientific achievements
Nature simply will beat
The groan of wind a hiding deadly disease
The groan of wind a hiding deadly disease

[Chorus]
