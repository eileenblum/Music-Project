In every revolution thereÂ´s a man with a vision
He agitates and incites to follow his vocation
He speaks the golden words turns us against the system
Into the stand we rise him and make a low bow

[Chorus:]
Time takes us all -makes me wonder that whoÂ´ll need his call
Time takes us all -makes me wonder that whoÂ´ll need his words

We all have to hail the man behind the pain
We all have to hail the man behind the pain

Soon he will take all the control becomes a mindless dictator
And we just canÂ´t believe he was the One
Under the protection of his faithful indoctination
He dominates and rules and distorts the truth

[Chorus]

We all have to hail the man behind the pain
We all have to hail the man behind the pain
We all have to hail the man behind the pain
