And life goes on with harmony
Day after day those same routines
And lifetime filled with happiness
The most greatest joy

[Pre-chorus:]
So great is the sea so small your boat
But you donÂ´t know if you donÂ´t row
And so great is the sky above your blue eyes
But you canÂ´t see behind the lies

In the smallest crack of your lifeÂ´s track
Is a chance for me to attack
Now the time is right for you to say
Your last goodbyes

[Chorus:]
Face yourself, your own dreams
I am your real demon hidden in your mind
IÂ´ll show you my own world, IÂ´ll take you down to the
Bitter metallic side

YouÂ´re lying next to me and youÂ´re too good to me
And I think you know I canÂ´t let you go

Bitter
Bitter
Bitter
Bitter

But donÂ´t throw away your last coin
I have to do this all my own
I only want you to know
IÂ´m buried deep down in your soul

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Bitter metallic side
Bitter metallic side
