A child was born into this world
With great emotion he was loved
The evil seed slept in his body
Spreading its roots before the glory

The hell was risen when he was twelve
The squeeze of the trigger was a move he did well
So he killed his parents killed his friends

With black spirit he filled himself
Soon he was taken in custody
But the inner seed was so well-rooted
He needed more the evil doer

[Chorus:]
With terminal intensity operation was made
His ties were broken and the doors opened
With terminal intensity and hardened heart
Now walking among us a voice in his head

He has an agenda a secret mission
Taking orders from higher levels
Fighting a battle for you and me
So we can live in our world of dreams

Tottering on the edge of the grave
Facing violence every day
Causes the new set of priorities
Kills with a pleasure every day
And the hindbrain behind will be safe
From the extra people to play his game
Wrapping himself up in mystery

[Chorus:]
With terminal intensity the plan was made
But there is no control in evils way
With terminal intensity all hellÂ´s breaking loose
No-one can control how evil moves

Unestrained anger deep inside
Turns himself against the person of high
But will be killed in the name of law
And the voice in his head will be gone
