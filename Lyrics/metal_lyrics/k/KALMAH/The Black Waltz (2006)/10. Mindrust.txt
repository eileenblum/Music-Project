In the eyes of the Watcher the gleam of flames
Reflecting pictures of the years gone by
Time makes no difference the sleep wonÂ´t come
And tomorrows daylight is hiding around

This lonely mind, eyes still awake
Taking a swig now and then
Poking the fire with the rod
Seeking the truth behind the blaze
Where lost all the glory days?
Vanity just remains in his own wishing well

[Pre-chorus:]
Has learned to fear the fire of life
Has burned his hands so many times
In the shelter of smoke he is feeling home
Gives him protection from the outside world

The lesson of life we all have to die
Ashes only stays under our names
If believed Kingdom come before all is gone
Is the chance to reborn whoÂ´ll need the fire?

[Chorus:]
Mindrust - watching the embers
Time passes his eyes in flow
Grand failure, betrayal, denial
The pain to swallow
Tarred waiting to burn
The glow stays until it fades
Dying weeping and slow
Before the rain comes falling

So the fire does not forever burn
And before the rain he has to learn

[Pre-chorus]

The lesson of life we all have to die
Ashes only stays under our names
If believed Kingdom come before all is gone
Is the chance to reborn whoÂ´ll need the fire?

[Chorus]
