Wasting feeling breeding inside me
A shadow of something crawling behind me
And IÂ´m pretending thereÂ´s nothing in there
But hearing those whispers makes me to believe

Here -I lay in my bed tasting bitter sweet
Smell -In my breathe reminding smell of death
Dreams -In my head slowly fade away
The end -Is nearby me and I want it to be

The king - Inside my head seducing me to betray
You -The only one making myself me
The loss -In my life great it will be
The game -Is taking me and the prize is defeat

[Chorus:]
Defeat
Inevitable, my destiny
Defeat
Best friend IÂ´ve ever met
Defeat
Inevitable, my destiny

Hands stretching up to reach the sky
Grobing for a lifehold a place to stay
Fingers are slipping and IÂ´m falling down
Into the world I know the world of sadness

Room -In my heart empty as a well
Still -Waiting for the victory to take
In vain -IÂ´ve lost this game before IÂ´ve even born
Defeat -My destiny all I ever get

Inevitable, my destiny
Defeat
Best friend IÂ´ve ever met
Defeat
Inevitable, my destiny
Defeat
Best friend I've ever met

Defeat
