Life -Black and White
Without the red in my eyes
Smile -toothless grin
Before the king is inside me

I want to believe to the power higher than we know
But the scene is getting darker in everything I own
So I will dive into dreamworld and clear everything
And the things getting brighter 'cause I am the man of the King

Life -Black and white
Without the red in my eyes
Smile -toothless grin
Before the king is inside me

You might say IÂ´m nothing cause I get nothing done
But do not deny me I have the strength within
The people around you also follow the dream
Take a look I am not the only one of the King

Hey, now IÂ´m saved
From the world today
IÂ´ve found my way
To get away

End - it is nothing
Cause I have sworn my oath
Like the others
I believe to the powered dream

[Chorus:]
I donÂ´t give a damn because I am the man of the King
The hell with the rest I am the man of the King
Right, Yeah, I am the man of the King
Simply the man of the King
