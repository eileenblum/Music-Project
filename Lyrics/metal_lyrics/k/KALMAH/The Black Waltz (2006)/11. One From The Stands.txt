A condemned man in a prison cell charged with a crime he has done
He draws a picture on the wall a symbol of victory
He clothed peoples thoughts in words declared peace and liberty
The iron fist clenching his throat depriving humanity

A political prisoner a propagandistic weapon
Of the proletarian dictature against the other world
After he has been released
Got his name on the paper
A part of a macabre tradition
Released as a gift

And weÂ´re all staring at the news
Nodding our heads in approval
We think that the the world is better now
Although he is already dead

A condemned man in a prison cell charged with a crime he has done
He draws a picture on the wall a symbol of victory
He clothed peoples thoughts in words declared peace and liberty
The iron fist clenching his throat depriving humanity

[Chorus:]
We donÂ´t give a damn
He is not one of us just one from the stands
And afterwards we have cleared ourselves
Justice has done

Justice has done
Justice has done

Soon another one will come declares peace and liberty
Speaks the words want to be heard words of alteration
But he will be arrested he will be condemned
But never mind there are more in the stands
