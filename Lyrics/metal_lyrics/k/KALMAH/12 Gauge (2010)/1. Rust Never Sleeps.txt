The evil seed
Planted for you
The apple tree
Picked for you

Ceremony begins
Master propagates
Oneness prevails
Evil in disguise

Feel the touch on your head
Divine lights fill your mind

A dopamine trip, a synaptic crash
And you will fall into the trap

The imam speaks to the herd
Divine lights fill their minds

A dopamine trip, a synaptic crash
And you will fall into the trap

Rust never sleeps
Makes you to believe
What do you achieve?
Harmony or peace?

The old prophet lies in his graves
With the grin on his face
Watching the marionette's dance
Well, he took heed of his chance

And the man wearing cape
Is ready for a trade
Eins, zwei, drei
Arbeit macht frei

A dopamine trip, a synaptic crash
And you will fall into the trap

Rust never sleeps
Makes you to believe
What do you achieve?
Harmony or peace?
