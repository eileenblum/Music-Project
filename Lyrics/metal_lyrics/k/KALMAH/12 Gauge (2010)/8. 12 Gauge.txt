Lairs doctors, the tools of evil
Give the recipes that will heal the sadness
Inside the pill can the saviour is waiting
Swallow the sweet taste of madness

Chemical feelings that everything is going well
Hallucination takes you down into the deepest swamp
The combination, an everlasting, final tramp
Without any doubts tomorrows need is more and more

Allowed demon inside the bottle
hear him calling and he will tear you down
Just take a pull and start the dreaming
Insidious session, Messiah is still bleeding

Chemical feelings that everything is going well
Hallucination takes you down into the deepest swamp
The combination, an everlasting, final tramp
Without any doubts tomorrows need is more and more

And soon the day will come black, black
Makes you feel that you are a scumbag
Standing deep in the same dead end
The only friend that you have 12 gauge

Chemical feelings that everything is going well
Hallucination takes you down into the deepest swamp
The combination, an everlasting, final tramp
Without any doubts tomorrows need is more and more

And soon the day will come - black, black
Makes you feel that you are - a scumbag
Standing deep in the swamp - dead end
The only friend that you have - 12 gauge

Good bye my friends
Good bye...
