I am the man of my words
If I'm not drunk or disturbed
I am the one of your daydreams
Don't call me sexy I'm angry

hiiop, hiiop

I'm only happy when it hurts
All by myself, don't need no help

One of fail Master Jack is my true name
To prevail I am breaking my balls
One of fail Master Jack is my true name
To prevail I am breaking my balls

hiiop, hiiop! It will rise!

I'm not sedate even when I sleep
hurry will bother when I eat
Already one foot in the grave
Another one slipping on the soap

hiiop, hiiop

One of fail Master Jack is my true name
To prevail I am breaking my balls
One of fail Master Jack is my true name
To prevail I am breaking my balls
