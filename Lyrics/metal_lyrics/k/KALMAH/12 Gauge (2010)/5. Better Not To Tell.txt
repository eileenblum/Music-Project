Good luck to you little one in your life
Follow you own path
Danger is lurking around the corner
And you don't know
Who is the maker of your taker?
Better not to tell

The taker's on the loose and the bog-eyes are haunting
So never look back
Countless are the days that you'll be afflicted
But never abandoned

Prices are high without guarantee
You have to pay
Don't go beyond the bounds of reasonable
You don't need it all
why all the bad just can't be undone?
Better not to tell

Mark my words now, life is never pointless
Look out! There's a hole in the ice
Reach out and extend your arms
give the alms to the one who will need

Mark my words now, life is never pointless
Look out! There's a hole in the ice
Reach out and extend your arms
give the alms to the one who will need

Mark my words now
Give the alms to the one who will need
