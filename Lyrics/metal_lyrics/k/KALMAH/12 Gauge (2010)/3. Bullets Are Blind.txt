Merchant of death is on the loose and haunts you
he has stuck in his own hell and can't break through

And when the man standing still
his hands are swept but that was the deal

Truce concluded and the war farewelled
Most poisonous weapon is coming in
Travels in the bags, carried by the cross
Aid is the name of the game

All the people on this earth feel comfort
Yeah, we read like the devil reads the bible

Soon the world is shaking again
The gunman's speech is about to begin

Beautiful words from the political cream
The outlaw is now taken in
Eyewashed democracy cannot keep its feet
Without the backing on the weak

People will die but they're far and away
So never mind bullets are blind
People will die but they're far and away
So never mind bullets are blind

Lady liberty shakes at her base
Inexpressiveness on her face

Crawlers will crawl and the gauntlet is on
We all playing our cards
Victory or not, does it matter because we all are struck
And we just can't get out

People will die but they're far and away
So never mind bullets are blind
People will die but they're far and away
So never mind bullets are blind
