Cheering voices
The arena is waiting for me

Thousand eyes are watching me now
Noble stand I in front of those
Who have condemned me

the oath has been taken
A chance to reborn
Now it's time to earn the place among the others

Gone away the past, my name, my land
All have I lost
Now fighting for the thumb to rise, to fall
To crawl before the emperor

Falling down the sand
In a foreign land
Nothing left to stand
But the oath obligates
Sacramentum

Metal clashes
Flames and ashes

The way of glory or the end of story
Rise the sword and fight for freedom or destruction
Burned by fire
Bound in chains
To be beaten
Willing to die by the sword

countless are the days I've spent, I've prayed
My gods take me home
Taken are the dreams I've had
So please, please spear me now

Falling down the sand
In a foreign land
Nothing left to stand
But the oath obligates
Sacramentum
