[originally by KISS]My heater's broke and I'm so tiredÂ 
I need some fuel to build a fireÂ 
The girl next door, her lights are out, yeahÂ 
The landlord's gone, I'm down and outÂ 
Ooh, it's cold gin time againÂ 
You know it'll always winÂ 
Cold gin time againÂ 
You know it's the only thingÂ 
That keeps us together

It's time to leave and get another quartÂ 
Around the corner at the liquor storeÂ 
Haha, the cheapest stuff is all I needÂ 
To get me back on my feet againÂ 

Ooh, it's cold gin time againÂ 
You know it'll always winÂ 
It's cold gin time againÂ 
You know it's the only thingÂ 
That keeps us together

Ooh, it's cold gin time againÂ 
You know it'll always winÂ 
It's cold gin time againÂ 
You know it's the only thingÂ 
That keeps us together
