This is the day which the lord hath made
I've ran with the hare and hunted with the hounds
All those hardy years I've lied to myself

Wolves on the throne
Bastards in control
Holding the strings and the shackles
And running the world and the people

They own the machines and the underling
Who whip our landscape and squeeze the tears out
Demons are here to stay
Demons are here to stay
They live in cities and from their concrete booths
They keep on watching and just give a damn

Raping and destruction
Human waste invasion
Wasteful utilization 
Irresponsible pollution
No hope for anyone
No home for anyone
Meaningless promises
Tearing down the innocent

Kill, kill
Rape, rape
And consume
Get enriched
Before others

Wolves on the throne
Bastards in control
Holding the strings and the shackles
And running the world and the people

The change never comes
Without you
