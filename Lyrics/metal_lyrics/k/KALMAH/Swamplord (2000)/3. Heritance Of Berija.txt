[music: A.Kokko, lyrics: P.Kokko]

Land of mighty and glory
Reality behind the iron curtain

Waves - of the bloody revolution
Demagog - calling to join them
Puppets will gather
Controlled by the hindbrain

Heritance of Berija
Comissar's iron fist

Blood is thicker than water
Innocent people pay the price

Chauvinist - using the ultimate power
Democracy - demigod of backward nation
The one who sow dissension
Submission or punishment

Salute - The - One
