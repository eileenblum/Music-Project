[music: P.Kokko, A.Kokko, lyrics: P.Kokko]

Life - testament of fathers
Forces to fight against the dark side
Mystery - still unsolved
Controller of the panel inner body

Hear the voices from the side of unknown
Leading body into temptation
False prophets message behind the mask
Breaking through the will, darker one to rule

Withering away
Only way to be awake
Dispensation into the light
Against the law, internal fight

Two minds destroying their cradle
Suicidal action towards the end

Believer - the feeble natured
Completely influenced by abuser
Awareness - disturbed
A matter of social needs

Suppression way to inner revolution
Denial is the force
Opens the lock of inner control
The enemy will lose
