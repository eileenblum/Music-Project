[music: P.Kokko, lyrics: P.Kokko]

Water in eternal movement
Circling day after day
Above the surface in wind's face
Is the end cruelly grimaced
On the water, water lily's leaf
Is rolling on the stream
Beside the bluff there she dances
Water flea in her wedding
Master wind blows waves begin to rise

Her fiance tomorrow child
Just taken his first breath
Take his step and with his bride
They fall into ecstasy
Wind blows hard they do not see
Water lily's leaf is turning
With this move it falls down
Those lovers almost together
Lose their lifes for the others to live
Today it is calm
Tomorrow it storms
But still water
For ever flows
