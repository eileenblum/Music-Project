[music: A.Kokko, lyrics: P.Kokko]

With outspread wings eyes wide open glides osprey
Wounded by a gun never fired - humanity
Twisted form genotype inside - lethal decease
From generation to others will occur

World in its forms is dying
Polymorphism is ruined
Or ...?

Are these changes in system meant to be done ?
How fast will proceed this process that slowly begun ?

Into the night we disappear - before the end
Silence will creep over the planet - final era
Component parts of life remains - combination
And under control of creator the new race will born
