You take a frog's eye and give it to a man 
Pleased with your cyborg proudly you stand
This glorious madness that is not in gods hands
Makes you believe you're all powerful 
This inhumane robot 
Becomes a heathen god
Will be idolized and takes all control
Spreads over the planet and infects us all
With this evil act the main race will be
And too late resisted by you or by me
Cloned by you or by me 
Cloned Insanity
Cloned by you or by me 
Cloned Insanity
Cloned Insanity 
Cloned by you and by me 
Cloned Insanity 
Cloned by you and by me
Cloned by you or by me 
Cloned Insanity
Cloned by you or by me 
Cloned Insanity
Cloned Insanity 
Cloned by you and by me 
Cloned Insanity 
Cloned by you and by me
This inhumane robot 
Becomes a heathen god
