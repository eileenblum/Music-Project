I thought I knew who you were
But I didn't know myself
Didn't see the things hidden
In my hollowness
Didn't peep round the curtain
Of your exterior
And the crack turned into an edge
That opens between 
Listen to the wind singing in the grass, my love
As you lay yourself down to rest
Listen to the cry of the river in autumn cold, my dear
Before I close the gates deep down inside
You were
Moon of my nights
Moon of my nights
Those secrets that I revealed
Buried in icy bosom
Those words that I've spoken
Taken by the dawn
The strings that were connected
Separated parts left
Read are the rhymes of story
Of the endless poet
Listen to the wind singing in the grass, my love
As you lay yourself down to rest
Listen to the cry of the river in autumn cold, my dear
Before I close gates deep down inside
You were the moon of my nights
And you know you were the moon of my nights
Moon of my nights
You were
Moon of my nights
Moon of my nights
Moon of my nights
Moon of my nights
