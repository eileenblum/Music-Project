Eternal fight against the time
Living in a grocery of chaos
Darkness around, light that guides
Leading myself into the fire

Suodeth, Suodeth

Black grouse, messenger, flies near the Earth
Evil invites to join him
Deep down inside I have to obey
Piede piper's sound is my leader

I'm dancing with my demons
Dancing alone in sorrow
The rhythm of my life's encore
Dancing in sweet Suodeth

A cry - a cry of pain in my heart
Pain - overswells its limits

Suodeth, Suodeth

There is no return, no way out, no entrance
I'm swinging into the flames of purgatory
No warming sun, no merrymaking
Behind the massive walls of eternity

I'm dancing with my demons
Dancing alone in sorrow
Rhythm of my life's encore
Dancing in sweet Suodeth

Sweet Suodeth
Sweet Suodeth
Sweet Suodeth
Sweet Suodeth
