Thoughts of hope in the minds of those whose
Lives are on decline
A thousand lies told them with bright eyes
And believed without doubts of employment 
Now it's time to think very positive
Deny all the evil things
Hah, right time to face this reality
Take all the pain
Coming with me - Bird of ill omen
Living in me - Bird of ill omen
Bird of ill omen
Purity behind the mask of innocence
Weakness of this world
Blind-eyed fools will never rise from unfairness
Until they'll join the Good!
Coming with me - Bird of ill omen
Living in me - Bird of ill omen
Bird of ill omen
The carrier of the crown of thorns
Hides behind a dollar smile
And will judge the Poor!
So let's throw away all our useless hope
Nothing will ever change!
Hah, right time to face this reality
Take all the pain
Coming with me - Bird of ill omen
Living in me - Bird of ill omen
Bird of ill omen
