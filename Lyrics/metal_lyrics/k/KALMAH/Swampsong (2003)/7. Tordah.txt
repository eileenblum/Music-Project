I've chosen my way of life I'll drink my every coin
And even if I'm broken I'll drink my homemade moonshine
Until it is all in my head and I will meet my fellows
Those who creep around at nights and will not allow me 
To be acceptable, to be respectable, to be normal,
To be a decent man
But I'm neurotic, I am vehement, I am withdrawn,
A psychotic man
Unsuccesful, hesitant
Tordah!
Tordah!
Don't have much lifetime left the rest I'll spend in deep
Tordah!
Don't have much lifetime left the rest I'll spend in deep
Tordah!
And with all my fellows we will take our place on the bottom
We will gather in your neighborhood to reach our destination
We will drink our past, we'll drink our future for you my friend
So, that you'll have a fixed point, a point of comparison
To be acceptable, to be respectable, to be normal,
To be a decent man
But I'm neurotic, I am vehement, I am withdrawn,
A psychotic man
Unsuccesful, hesitant
Tordah!
Tordah!
Don't have much lifetime left the rest I'll spend in deep
Tordah!
Don't have much lifetime left the rest I'll spend in deep
Tordah!
