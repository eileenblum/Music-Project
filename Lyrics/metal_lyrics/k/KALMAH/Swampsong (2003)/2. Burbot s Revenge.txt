There is a net under the ice
With a thousand knots tied
And unchecked amount of slime
Hanging down 
There is a burbot on the net
Into the mesh he has put his head
Now struggling for his life
Entangling more and more
And there is a fisherman on the ice
Drilling a hole with sweat and blood
Trying to draw the net above
The icy surface
But even though how hard he pulls
The net won't budge
Under the ice the net has stuck 
With thousand knots into the ground
With frustration and despair in his mind he decides
To fight to the bitter end with all his strength
But with his latest wrench
The net will tear to shreds
Burbot's revenge
Burbot's revenge
With frustration and despair in his mind he decides
To fight to the bitter end with all his strength
But with his latest wrench
The net will tear to shreds
Burbot's revenge
Burbot's revenge
Burbot's revenge
Burbot's revenge
