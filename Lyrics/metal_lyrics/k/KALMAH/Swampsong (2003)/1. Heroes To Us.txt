Old prophet's land -a battlefield
Of non-believers in a violent rage 
A declaration of human rights a pretext
For maintenance of a new world order
Above all written laws a growth concept
Created by the patriot of the civilized world
Rearmament -Welfare state
Disarmament - Non-member state
Free market economy a consequence
Of military needs -loss of lives
Human rights activists political pawn in a game 
Nothing Can they do without state subsidies
A gift of today`s world
Heroes to us, heroes to us, heroes to us
Heroes to us, heroes to us, heroes to us
Production at any price
Admiration of those who earn
With blood on their hands
We will never learn
A gift of today`s world
Heroes to us, heroes to us, heroes to us
Heroes to us, heroes to us, heroes to us
