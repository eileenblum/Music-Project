See him on Tv-screen doing the rightest thing
Always being at the top of our blessed nation
With white smile in his face he lives on the fat of the land
And he makes you feel sarcastic

Feel him stuck in your brain and in your every move
He is showing you the way what to do
So raise your inner voice wipe the smile off his face
Let your feelings rise and decide

[Chorus:]
Principle Hero
Mindless Zero
Principle Hero
Mindless Zero
Principle Hero

[Chorus:]
