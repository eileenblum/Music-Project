Breaking loose from reality surrounding me
Keeping you bonded in my imagination
Drifting away within the limits of consciousness
Falling in sleep with memories you left for me

Throwing all away
Meaningless words
Nothing left 
Inside me

Restless dream stiring up in my head
Shakes up my sweaty body from torture
Waking up in empty room filled with dark
Asking myself will this reality never end?

[Chorus:]
Where are you, my wealth of life?
Vanity filling my mind
Hole in me in distress
Who will fill up my Hollow Heart?

Please god never let me fall asleep
Make me real -keep away from my imagination
Dishearten mind -still looking for another answer
Hopeless act -action speak louder than words

Throwing all away
Meaningless words
Nothing left 
Inside me

[Chorus:]
