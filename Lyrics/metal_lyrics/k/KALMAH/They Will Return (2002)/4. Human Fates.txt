A man on the corner with glassy look
Telling a story of his lifetime
A thousand times told, desperate verse
But never listened

Another on by the bar talking to a barmaid
Has spent his whole life there
A naively trusting man never faced life
Or has just found Eldorado
Life is nothing but a gift...

[Chorus:]
Poor human fates
Pure human fakes
No human rights
The underrated

The third one by the table never said a word
Gazing into the distance
The observer, melancholic man 
Just drinking heavily

Not very old but still a veteran
Has lost his thread of life
In god-forsaken place they are the family
And they are at home
Life is nothing but a gift...

[Chorus:]

Use of education is not complete solution
Now it is time to look in the mirror

[Chorus:]
