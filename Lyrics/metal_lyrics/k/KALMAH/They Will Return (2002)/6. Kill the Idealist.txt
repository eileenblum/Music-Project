A pioneer of humanity
Declaring his truth to the crowd
Word of wisdom is what he speaks
Wisdom he has never reached

A well-educated know-it-all
But never has done anything
Collects info from sources 
The vice man has left behind

[Chorus:]
Kill the idealist
Get him a job
Kill the agitator
Capital rules the world

So let him found a labour
On his own certain conditions
And try to heal society
Without support

[Chorus:]
