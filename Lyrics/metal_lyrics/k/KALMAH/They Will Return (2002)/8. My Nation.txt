Waves of change creep over promised land
We have gathered in our secret stand
Time has come for us to carry through the plan
The bond of oppression have to be unchained

[Chorus:]
Those in power - overthrown - revolution - found my nation

So my brother raise your scimitar
Join our legion in the name of god
Together as one we will fight till the end
Oppressive despots will be sent to hell

[Chorus:]

Everlasting confederation
Never-ending condemnation

[Chorus:]
