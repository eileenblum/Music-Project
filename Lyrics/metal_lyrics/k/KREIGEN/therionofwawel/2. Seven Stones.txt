[Chorus]
Seven stones hidden under the canopy,
Seven places with hidden supremacy,
Not allowed to shine simultaneously,
Each await for his time of the legacy.

Related with bodies of celestial,
Located at places perennial,
Called to be shields from enemy,
In time to wake up, from vanity.

Delhi - Moon
Mecca - Mercury
Jerusalem - Sun
Delphi - Venus
Rome - Mars
Velehrad - Saturn
Wawel - Jupiter
