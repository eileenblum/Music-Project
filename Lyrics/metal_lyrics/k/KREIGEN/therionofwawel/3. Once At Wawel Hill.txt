[Place: Wawel hill]

[Scene]

[A.] You canât see all the scars, cause they inside my heart
[D.] But I donât
[A.] I donât want to hear a word.
Because of you Iâm here. See?
[D.] What can I?
[A.] I donât want anything.
[D.] I never wanted to hurt you, and I think I did not.
[A.] So itâs my fault, and Iâm to blame,
What else to expect from youâ¦
[D.] At least tell me, Oh why we are here?

[A.] Something that I,
[D.] Say it, O finally say it, I'm begging you!
[A.] had in dream,
[D.] Tell me what it was? and was I'm a part of it?
[A.] Took possession,
[D.] What do you mean? you had a bad dream?
[A.] on my feel.
[D.] So this is a scandal from silliest dream?
[A.] How can you blame me for this?!
[D.] Why are we on Wawel hill?!
[A.] I know this is a dangerous place, but in dream I (fell)
[D.] Watch your step! Beneath is hole, and you can simply fall.

[Chakram + Choir]
Now she's in cave and lying unconscious,
Fell thru the hole on the top of Wawel
It was me in your dream, but your nightmare is only begins
