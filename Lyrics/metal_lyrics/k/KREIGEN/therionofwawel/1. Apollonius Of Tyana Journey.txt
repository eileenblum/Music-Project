[Ð Act]

[1st century C.E.]

[Apollonius - tenor]
[Iarchus /Delphi priest - bajo]

[Place: Cave at the foot of Hill]

[Arioso: Apollonius]
[Latin]
Et ego hic
Alea jacta est
Per aspera ad astra -
Ducunt volentem fata

[Aria: Iarchus]

This was that he told to himself,
Approaching to the foot of hill,
Where was entrance to deep damp cave,
And shelter for the Talisman.

With knowledge gained from Shamballa,
Will you deliver seven stones,
To places marked on this map?
By your own will, not by debt.

[Apollonius]
I willâ¦

[Scene]

[Apollonius]
From first steps I was encountered by breeze.
Some more walk, and last of stones will be placed,
On stalactites crown, where he never be seized.

But my thoughts, is now about cooper sheets
Which were brought by Delphi priest.
Diagrams cast me into mist.

[Iarchus (as Delphi priest)]
Deciphered, youâll reach abode, of men who knows Truth.

[Apollonius]
I saw before my eyes, long way I need to pass thru

[Iarchus (as Delphi priest)]
sands and mountains,

[Apollonius]
up to river with elephants and fruits of hyacinth.

[Story]
After years, spent in journey to Shamballa,
He finally climbed on the mount where the temple is,
And stood up in front of one,
who handle same copper sheets that led him.

[Iarchus]
Here you face, those who knows everything.

[Choir]
Esoteric things, come to show you another side of truth.

[Apollonius]
Who was that crazy priest?
Was he ever exist?
It does not matter now, âcause Iâm between some stalactites,
brought hope inside the night.
