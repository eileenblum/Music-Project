[Arioso : Smok]
What was that?
Was it in a dream? or it was she again.
I often see those times, whenâ¦

[Aria : Smok]
In the dark of the night,
I was called by the light.
She not asked but told,
To keep in awe, this white world.

[Choir]
Feeding of the beast take place once a week,
One sheep is small price for a life.
But sometimes he need more than just a sheep -
Girl, who does not know, what is to weep.

[Arioso : Chakram]
And tears of this one, may be the last.

[Aria : Agnieszka]
That voice from dream,
the one who has steal
my conscious, and now
Iâm hereâ¦
It canât be real!
Why do I have no fear.

I know what waits me in this cave,
Here will be my final play.
Oh, why have I came,
By myself, in arms of beast?

[Duet]

[Smok]
One more victim of her will, is now stand embraced by fear.
This young girl, she has no chance.
But for me, itâs always new one, to escape.
[Agnieszka]
Mighty beast in front of me show his teeth, with fire breath.
By your jaws my life will ends, hope someone avenge me.
[Smok]
By my jaws your life will ends, hope someone avenge me.
[Agnieszka]
What?
[Smok]
Girl, say goodbye to this world
[Agnieszka]
No
