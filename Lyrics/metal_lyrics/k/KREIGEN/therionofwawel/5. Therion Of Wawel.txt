[Krak â tenor (K)]
[Chakram â mezzo]
[Smok â baritone (S)]
[Place :At the foot of Wawel Hill]

[Arioso : Krak]
Tragedy news spreading the land,
Young beauty woman have faced the end.

[Aria : Krak]
Beloved of her, who was on the hill,
Can swear his life, it was against her will.
Itâs time to break up with this useless peace!

[Aria : Chakram]
Oh, young warrior,
Oh, I see, it will be you,
The One, whose glory will be so great, that only grief will exceed.
I know you can't hear me, but your name will live for ages.

[Cabaletta]

[Chakram]
Spread wings of your fate -
Bring this land, cup she awaits.

[Smok]
In a heat of battlefield,
Better hide behind your shield.

[Chakram]
Make your destiny up there

[Smok]
Iâm a Therion of Wawel

[Chakram]
Show me why I called you here

[Smok]
Make their lives full of Hellâ.
Previous warriors, you have sent,
Can do nothing, but stuck in my teeth.

[Duet]

[Smok]
Awful sights you will discover inside of my stomach,
'cause I will swallow you whole, alive.

[Krak]
Huge beast come out by his thirst, now you will face my wrath,
and pay all your debts.

[Scene]

[K.] Look in my eyes!
[S.] I have seen more the ton of them.
[K.] Face all my wrath!
[S.] You're no more then next sheep for me.
[K.] I will slice you!
[S.] Yes you will, yes you will, yes you will,
Same as previous, who come here by all the time.
[S.] Give me your sword!
[K.] He so strong, I canât hold it.
[S.] Give me your shield!
[K.] Without it I'm in fire breath.
[S.] Say goodbye!
[K.] Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will,
But first I'll show, what I have in a bag for you.

[Choir]
Then Krak throw his leather bag in throat of beast,
Whom started smoke, and ran to river.
Found his sword, he crept up to the Smok,
Who choked from sulphur, and pierced him.

[Smok]
Now I am free
