Second winter wore a bloody crown
and it was called the Winter of the Sword.
Coldest winds buried in the ice a lot of those we knew
and maybe even lovedâ¦
And those who are staying alive can show them only envy,
Every day the snow melts in the veins of the dispossessed.
Wicked from hair-raising cold we started
Killing to rob and get some food or any else what can be used.
Thatâs not we want, thatâs what we must.
We donât show mercy at all, and corpses rise, to the skies.
Thatâs not we want thatâs what we must.
Northman were born to get a reborn in a mighty hall called the Valhalla.
Mad from blood we decided that gods send us a trial,
And those who are brave will triumphantly pass.
Inspired by this vapor we found excuse for our acts.
From now on, we kill in the name of Asgard.
Brother will attack his own brother,
And father will kill his own son,
Blood will flow like a river,
Quenching our thirst.
Aghast we realized
That we feel no regrets.
What have we become? (4 times)
When we ceased to be a human beings?
Why we ceased to be a human beings?
Mother will cry for her dead child, but he would not come back.
Husband will mourn his wife, but she wouldnât awake.
If Odin does not care about our lot,
there is only hope for mighty thunder god.
We beg you Thor, establish peace in Midgard
by one blow of your Mjolnir!
There was no answer above, only wolves howling below.
This voices opened to us the tragic end of our path.
Swords fall on land from hands and weâre
Standing still
Prepared to feel
Burdened events,
Which cannot be changed.
