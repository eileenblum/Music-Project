We forgot the smell of Spring and heat of sunlit Summer days
Autumn that brings us a harvest seems to never come again.
Instead of them, we have (the) Winter, endless, wildest, deathly cold,
And it looks like she wouldnât leave us till we bury all our gold.
Snow is falling all over the four corners,
Icy winds is blowing from every side,
(The) sun and moon are hidden in the frosty haze.
We are waiting for this icy hell to end.
Vikings are made by the wind of the North.
Winter we have never seen
Parts us with our family.
(In the) coldest darkness, we canât grip
What should be our destiny.
Four winds give us no remorse.
There were memories of (the) past,
When day-star shone above
And gave us warmth, sparing from the frost,
Stilling our minds, sending us some hopes.
Rune Sowelu, give me the strength
to see thy light again up in the sky!
Send to us your rays
Full with mighty grace,
And embrace the wind,
Blowing in our face.
In case you donât,
We beg you, expand
Our life force
To survive this all.
Bitter wind has changed something in our hearts forever and
now we are full of anger with desire for the fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
This is what weâre waiting for.
Fighting with everyone alive whoâll meet us,
Killing to quench the thirst for the blood.
Robbing to get anything to live,
Burning everything to get warm.
