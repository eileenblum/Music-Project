Cold winds passed, buried fates under ice,
Mighty battles, drowned Midgard in a blood.
Three years without single breath of warm air or a day without fight.
There were endless days when sun was hidden by frosty haze like in the night.
Ancient fable incarnates in truth every day of our life.
This realm will end and we know what will be after Fimbulwinter horrors.
Itâs time to face our destiny, we do not deserve to escape.
By carrying all our dignity, standing still, and ready to observe
How our dreams will turn to dust at sunset of our life path.
Soon weâll see daring warriors â our fathers and brothers,
Who deserved by courage place in the Valhalla.
Soon we will stand in the wall of the shields!
To Einherjar weâll show that we are mighty and brave,
And weâll stand with them in the last mortal slaughter.
Weâll not reach Valhalla but fable comes to me,
it lets me see and sets me free.
Close is the day when this all be far, far, far away,
The battle should close the old book of nine worlds.
Balder will rise from the Helâ
At the ruins of Asgard.
Lif and Lifprasir will leave the
Hoddmimis holt.
Gory past will be forgotten,
All the horrors will be rotten.
Sufferers (will) get a chance
To wield scepters of their fate.
Blood was flowing down like rain.
And the fearless heroes of Valhalla, were approaching the last battle, with every last drop of the blood.
Which until recently was flowing in the veins of their brothers in arms, and then was dripping down their benches.
After the blood was spilled from wolvesâ jaws
Einherjar followed the Heimdallâs horn.
(March of the Einherjar)
Finally time has come to march and fight for our gods and glory we deserve.
We follow mighty sound of the Gjallarhorn down on the Bifrost path for glory in the death.
Down on the Bifrost path for glory in the death.
