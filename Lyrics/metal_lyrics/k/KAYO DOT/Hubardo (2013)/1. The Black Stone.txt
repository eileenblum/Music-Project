The eye of Leviathan was swept from the sea
The crooked serpent in the deep of the night
We gather by the well to gather the rain
That fell from the eye of Leviathan
A pail of sweet water from the well of Leviathan
A baptism wrought in a ladle of rain

Gladly it fell from a sky and its stars
It fell from the night like a wraith in a rage
The prayer that journeyed from the abyss
To the lush of the earth
In the hush of the night
The stone from the sky
On the outskirts of town

All the stars will fall from the heavens
Into the ladle of gathered rain
To those who thirst: drink
There is water enough for all
