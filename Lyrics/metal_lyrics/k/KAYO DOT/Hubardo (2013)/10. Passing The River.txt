Nameless, a boy upon a rough boat
He makes his way downstream under the candles of the stars
The great chandeliers of the mansion
The moon in her fullness, she waltzes across the singing surface
As animals and insects sleep peacefully in their places
Water passes softly by
Drifting up from silent wells like memories in meditation

Count his bones, the boat drifted as a young leaf fallen
Hapless and helpless, and he blessed the mossy stones

A night and a day of longing is as nothing, as a shell cast into
The raging sea is forgotten
A star swallowed up in the void that pulses
A life expired that never blossoms

The music is his, the boy in his trance
He wrote it across the mist and the rapids
And it carried him away from the forest
And it carried him away
He gave himself to the river
And it carried him away
