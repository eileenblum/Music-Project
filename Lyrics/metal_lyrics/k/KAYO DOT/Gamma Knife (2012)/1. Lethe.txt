All else consumed by a holy cloud of forgetting
Build this man by the way attained
Go forth into the warm waters, brother,
Happy is he, healthy is he among the
pulled out and pulled apart.
He sat with them, but not in vain.
He sat among the ones long-dead,
A feast, a store, a partner, love;
Encourage him in all his ways
To help him to forget the time of disengagement;
Calling power down upon the hour,
Scouring the sea for word and need,
The broken healer, wounded lasts;
Prays the skies to shut the rain and
Makes them shower down again.
A sign that he's there. A friend.
Skilled to these degrees.
