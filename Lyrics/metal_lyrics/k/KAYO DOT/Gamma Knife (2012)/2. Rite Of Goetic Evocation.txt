The world lies thousands of leagues beneath the Sea
In the blackest abysses of gloom
I can see it spew shades like the eruption of boils
Like the stillbirths of saviours
Like the orgasm of demons
The shapes that surround me are void of coherence
A body's last breath
And a swirl in the smoke
They stink of leprosy

I call Thee forth into visible appearance
I call Thee forth into visible appearance
I call Thee forth into visible appearance

Rape me with your words
Scald me with your asylum eyes

Nail me to a cross of sorrow
Concealed in a Golgotha Trance
Tetragrammaton
Anaphaxeton
Primeumaton
AMN.
