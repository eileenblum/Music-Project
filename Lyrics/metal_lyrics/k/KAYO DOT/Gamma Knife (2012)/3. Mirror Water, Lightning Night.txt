My grisaille is something sad to see
For the shallow diver.
Behold the reckling in his room
Coordinates shifted by a small degree
But stained glass lanterns still abloom
Nocturnal and blissom as ever
Seeking the colored path I am walking

At your bedtime
I found myself floating
Three thousand meters in the air
Saw lightning coming
Felt the rain kissing
Laid down in a lake
Heard the sky quivering
Walked the summer sunset
Seeing grey
Hearing blue
Did it alone,
did it alone,
did it all alone
