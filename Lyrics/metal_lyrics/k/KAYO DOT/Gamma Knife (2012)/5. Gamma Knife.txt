I cut my pain with the ghost of a knife
In silence
And nothing drained from my veins to the carpet

Drops on the glass, I have nowhere to go today
And the umbrella in miles of dust in the hallway
Reading a book from the shelf (in miles of dust)
From day until night

Pale, glowing candles in a line like angels
I read aloud the words that were whispered in my ear
By the wind that rattles the windowpanes
Words cannot express_
Nor shudders

A phantom blade in the gathering shade
A breeze in the hallway
Tomorrow it may rain again
I will not leave and
Nothing will be disturbed
