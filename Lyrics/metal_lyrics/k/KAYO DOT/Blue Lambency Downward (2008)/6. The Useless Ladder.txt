The shamelessly desirous broken heart inside the otherwise empty cabinet of doom
Weeps what it's modesty beating without.

The youngest grave will hold a crowd before
The people stuck on the train have a reason to doubt.

The shamelessly desirous broken heart inside the
otherwise empty cabinet of doom
Weakens our modern prophetic distractions.

Pretty paths to perfidy and crooked roads to valor
And people stuck on their rooftops with a Government ladder.
