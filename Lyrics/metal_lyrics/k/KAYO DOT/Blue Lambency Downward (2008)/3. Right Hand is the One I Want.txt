Laughter is ceasing,
All the coroners of New Orleans
Are calling, all the coroners are calling you

You are completely alone in this world
It's not your fault it's just easy to forget
Waiting for a voice to say come in
Outside, a bell is ringing on a traveling olive branch
Now I'll be cold forever
To an innocent stranger?
Which hand is heavier on the snare?
