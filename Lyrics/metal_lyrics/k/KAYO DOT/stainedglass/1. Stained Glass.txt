I will exalt my throne above the stars of God
Will chain the stars and pull down the heavens
Will sow the seeds of corruption -
They are many and always in their season,
And the fruits that swell on the Tree of Knowledge

One tree grew on Golgotha, I cut me a staff therefrom
And I wept as I mocked him and wished the world would forget
And I travel the course of time, and I tread the bones of the dead

No love, no freedom, no joy
No mind, no thought, no reason
Bound we are by nails
Broken we are by the broken
And the devastation that followed

I have garmented myself with the garment of excess
And have drunk deeply from the chalice of want
These profited me not, and are as sand poured into my throat
I sat me down for an age and denied the cloak of the world
In the end I denied my own life, and all was as it ever was

Remember all ye that though the body falls among the years
It is as a discarded walking staff on the hedgerow beside the Path
