The portraiture within me rose up
To meet a constellation
Borne on psychic waters
Geometry showed me its dark side
And showered me with its arcing plumes

The lovers met in deepest dreams
Tourmaline eyes glinting in the non-light

I bring to thee an orchid I picked
Once as a human from my spiral garden
I held the holy tripod and all the nothing held its breath

Gemini solemnly split themselves
The world closed its eyes
Supreme love in the opposite
The world hid in clouds
From a severed two came on
The world quaked in fear
Galaxies slow, and ammonites
The foe e'en trembled in his darksome cave
