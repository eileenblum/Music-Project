Suffer the gulf
Of a hundred million years
The sand that buried centuries
The burden that drew its shadow long
That tried in vain to hide unfathomed
He drew the pictures of his dreams
Mechanically
Unlocked the shrine withdrawn
Threw open doors unmade
Remembering elusive shade
In pieces, like knives of sleepâ
It leaves the soul in ruins
A body is only a garment useable
Forgettable
He in me and I in heâ¦
I was given my way back
Unmercifully
I sliced through millennia
But I left my record written
In distorted hand
In alien archives whispering
Buried in the sands of centuries
