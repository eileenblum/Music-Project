Eat from the hand of Woman
The Wise
The Tempting
The centuries of castigationâ
Defeat rose up from a beautiful gloom
It twisted itself around a tree
Like a love around a love
It so loved mankind it fastened
Its fangs onto his neck
And it killed him with its poison
He sank into the earth
No ghost to haunt the wicked
Nor to enlighten the strong
The beautiful gulf fades away
It leaves a bounty untouched
A treasure box of Pure
