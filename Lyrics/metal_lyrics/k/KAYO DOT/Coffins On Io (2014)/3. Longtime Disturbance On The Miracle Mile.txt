The weight of murder fills the sky
A neon shadow rising up like vespers
From the haze that burnt away
The peeling painted stratosphere
Newspaper blowing by on a shriveled shred of apathy
A chronicle of missing persons
Only I know where I left the parts of them
A night-time fantasy in action
A knife that bled the life of faceless passion
I watched the moon all cold and icy
Suspended far above the severing
I separated the spirit from unwilling flesh, and bound
The body in a cityâs sorrow
But no one cares about the broken
Flickering in summer air
Stinking in suffocating breeze
I will wear a mask of normal
To hide my mask of orgasmic shame
The cars on fire on the sides of the naked street
They light my way, they free me
As I crawl back into my concrete cavern
