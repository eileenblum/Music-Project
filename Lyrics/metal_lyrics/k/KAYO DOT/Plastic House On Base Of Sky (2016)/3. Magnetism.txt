Steel through passageways
Like water through fountain pipes
The eyes of many roll from their holes
Out to the causeway
Leering along the crooked sidewalks
And all there is to see
Follow secret, secret back streets

Flow just like water
Water flowing through a pipeline

Avoid the avenues teeming
Sun goes down behind landscape seeming
Alien in its nightmare evening
Avoid

Step lightly over whores reaching
Up through cracks in the concrete
Grinning death masks of beauty living
Hands like scalpels reaching out

Step lightly over whores reaching
Up through cracks in the concrete
Grinning death masks of beauty living
Hands like scalpels reaching out

Desire killed the curious
Desire killed the curious

Avoid the avenues teeming
Sun goes down behind landscape seeming
Alien in its nightmare evening
Avoid

Desire killed the curious
Desire killed the curiousâ

Incision neat and clean
Magnetism spilling onto street
Magnetism less the distance between
Magnetism unfathomable points
Attraction and repulsion

Who ever wanted to live forever?
Who ever wanted to live forever?
