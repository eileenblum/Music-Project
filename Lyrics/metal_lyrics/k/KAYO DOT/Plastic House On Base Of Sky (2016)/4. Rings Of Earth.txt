Satellites with empty eyes
Stalk along the starry countryside
Titanium, titanium ghost
Tombstone orbit creeping
Thousands of miles above
The multitude of dead

Crown and constellation
Hang antenna vultures
Tower over the thermosphere
Like omens dead
When earth that fed
Left its relics in the sky
Unobstructed view

Ring of eyes
Ring of eyes
Ring of eyes
Ring of eyes

Ring of eyes
Ring of eyes
Ring of eyes
Ring of eyes

Ring of eyes watch without
Shapes and shadows that do not see

Lens reflect trajectory
Blue circle turns and turns

Ring of eyes
Ring of eyes
Ring of eyes
Ring of eyes

Ring of eyes
Ring of eyes
Ring of eyes
Ring of eyes

Awake in the day
Asleep in the night
Awake in the day
Asleep in a grave

Awake in the day
Asleep in the night
Awake in the day
Asleep in a grave

All sleep on blue grave

Rings of Saturn spin away
All these Ã¦ons spinning
Rings of Earth are grinning
Satellites in array

Spinning as the days unfold
Watching as the nights untold
Bear witness to another light
The ring of satellites

Glinting over no one but
The skeletons of endeavor

Bear witness to another light
The ring of satellites
Glinting over no one but
Skeletons of endeavor

Rings of Saturn spin away
All these Ã¦ons spinning
Rings of Earth are grinning
Satellites in array

Spinning as the days unfold
Watching as the nights untold
Bear witness to another light

Rings of Saturn spin away
All these Ã¦ons spinning
Rings of Earth are grinning
