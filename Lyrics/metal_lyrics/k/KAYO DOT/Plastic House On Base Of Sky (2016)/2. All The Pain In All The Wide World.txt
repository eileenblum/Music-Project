Dim light in the bar
Makes one look younger
Neon lies

We sit and we drink
we pretend we're something that we're not

Jumble human bones with water running
Water running over them unknown
Almost sounding lovely
Trickle under grate outside

Jumble human bones with water running
Water running over them unknown
Almost sounding lovely
Trickle under grate outside

We sit, we drink, we play

[?] at all above of you
[?]
[?], some day, some time
[?]

No one listens
Can't you hear me talking and talking
And I'm not getting through
You're talking and talking
And talking and talking
But I'm not listening
I'm only talking
You miss the point
You're just not listening
No one listens
Can't you hear me
I'm talking and talking
And I'm not getting through
You're talking and talking
And talking and talking
But I'm not listening
I'm only talking

You miss the point
You're just not listening

[Repeat with ad-libs:]
All the pain in all the wide world
Couldn't fill even a fraction
Of the South Pole-Aitken basin
I can fix it
But it all fits in shadow pocket
Like a knife before it
Sticks in neck

Potential under icy moon
Scream then silence in the gloom
Scream then silence splattered room
That was then, this was soon
But you're too busy talking
And I wasn't even listening
Hand in shadow pocket
Pulse is quickening
