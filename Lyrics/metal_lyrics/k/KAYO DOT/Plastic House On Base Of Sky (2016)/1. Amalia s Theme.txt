Delphi it drew us over the touchscreen
Delphi it threw us up like a stone
In sheep's clothing
Instrumental
The gods that roil inside of us

As she whistles her sweet oracles
Out by the poolside
Ravings of suicide
As Athens is burning
Plots and visions
Empty amber bottle
Opiate
The sky is blue today
Gone tomorrow
Castalian spring

Watching clouds
Amalia nods
Shield shroud
Amalia nods

Watching clouds
Amalia nods
Shield shroud
Amalia nods

Watching clouds
Amalia nods

Of moon beams sacramental
Poolside
The cigarette smoke
That gyres up like prophecies
Glyph in dragging blood

Amalia swayin' through the hotel corridors
Shuffling through the thousand years
Oracular and wandering
