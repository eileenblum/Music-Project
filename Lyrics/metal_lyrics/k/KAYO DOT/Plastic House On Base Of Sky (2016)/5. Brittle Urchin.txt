Darkness in the cradle of my heart will never wane
Sandstone boy in wind and rain worn-down featureless

A dented page of paper from a drawing diary
Wrapped in cracks like rivers, sugar ground to dust

A brittle urchin desiccated by the ocean air
Like a tower of ash upon a cemetery hill

I could never last, I could never last, I could never last.

Darkness in the cradle of my heart will never wane
I could never last like a sandstone boy in the wind and in the rain

A dented page of paper from a drawing diary
Wrapped in cracks like rivers, sugar ground to dust

I could never last
I could never last
