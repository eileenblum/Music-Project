Help me, I'm disappearingThe doors are breathingFloorboards are bowing Remind me if I'm not saying anythingThere's just so much I can't seeI feel misplaced [x2] Like a moth trapped in the window blindsAfter wings came apart into pieces Who knows who I am anymore? One day I entered the room of my mindShut the thick door behind my bedAlthough there was no life I felt safe here I decided to draw some pictures in the airWhen the darkness drove it up - all my imaginationsThey were creeping and you told me ----- I want to live forever
