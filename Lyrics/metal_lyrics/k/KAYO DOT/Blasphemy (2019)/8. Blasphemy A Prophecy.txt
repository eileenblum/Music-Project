Look at what's become of it
The Garlanded Experiment
All to naught an island wrought
In obscurity by clouds
See the future of religion
Sleepawake eye squints
Cataracts of vision

See the fools and see the lies
The bargaining of lives
Remove their hands
Put on their eyes
Walk away as airship dies

Dragon prays in a corner bid
By shade of ignorance amid
Corruption, search of X imbued
With charm enough to misconstrue
The lust of self for love of all

A ship of fools one day appeared
From out of prism mist and fog
And only a girl disembarked
In the land Gog Magog
In the land of Nod unleashed
The Spirit of Castration
With bloody dress
And razor tress
A miracle's duration
The holy trumpet blasphemy
The savior of a Nation
