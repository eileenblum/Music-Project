Curse the girl
The girl is cursed
She dreams in jet
Her soul is as black as her body
The gods they dropp'd her in the Q'Sh
To save themselves
Statue breathe on bier in the
Cabinet from the clouds
This is nothing holy
Sleepawake eye spinning
Abomination, blasphemy
That thou art, then, Blasphemy

Decanter is almost empty now
Devil doll, she needs to die
Die
Holy knife sacrifice
Creep out of the shade
Deck planks creaking
Silver gleam against the lamps
Is a dark angel grinning
In the throes of suicide

Bier like hope, girl gone
(Maybe she would bless this spot)
Knife is shaking
Magus trembling
Shadow out from nowhere
Death leapt up in a somber dress
Broke his neck and cast him to the mist

Silence again
And groaning
Planks of airship creaking
