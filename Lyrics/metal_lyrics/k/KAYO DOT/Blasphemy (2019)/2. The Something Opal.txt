Face at the window of the shop neglected
Squints down on the people
Spider crack along the pane
Along the cheek (not so deep)
And eyes that dart from coin to pocket
Curse the wallet
Junk antiques and blatant forgeries
He weighed and lost his soul to Mammon
Sold his soul for a costume synthetic

He found a map on scroll today
Tucked away in a crate of books
Charlatan and spider web
But this was different, this was Something
Opal glinting between the piles
A chart of uncharted in the seasons rolling
And a network to an X following

Winter skeleton fingers creep
Out across to grasp his coat of lies
Stride with overconfidence
He stepped onto the cobbles
Find him an airship and a crew
Bait them
Pay them with a strongbox promise
Follow Opal to the hoard
And kill them all out on the raging Q'Sh
