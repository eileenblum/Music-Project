Inaccessible point searching
Like lovers in a misty crowd
Plume of stratus
The whole world is a mushroom cloud
Sleepawake pull on silver cord
Feels almost like desperation
Holy Hook with water blessed
Steady and still
Disappear into swirling abyss

Fathom by fathom
By fathom
Line goes down
Magnet drawn to secret space
Hook and eye in lovers' place

Rise...
Haul out in the sea of silence
Turbine turns
Here the hook, here the haul
Cabinet drop on board in fall
Hieroglyphic painted door and wall
No one knows what they say
No one says what they saw

Ghoul in coat
That evening out in twilt boat
He twisted and he opened door
Little girl sleeps and dreams
Of the darkest ebony
Out on the raging Q'Sh
