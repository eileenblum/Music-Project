Tavern sign swinging on its chain
Rough and worn letter-work worn away
Sea is Jupiter dreaming today
Through telescope

Inside, a mystic circumambulation
Around an empty glass
Fire electrical virtual hearthside
And we are all the virtual IT inside
So saith the prophet slumped in a corner

Drew up like madness, ghoul in its coat
He spoke with a smile that went crooked and broken
But he swallowed his bait to seek out the Lapis
Cup everlasting
The Fleece
The magnificent everlasting
With his sleepawake eye shining

On to the quays where the airships are docked
The pirates atr bats roosting in the slum eaves
And one bat got loose in a brothel
A pilot perfect and sails fill'd with gold
See the X glowing
Glowing and shining
See all the sinning it buys
So saith the ghoul deaped in lies
