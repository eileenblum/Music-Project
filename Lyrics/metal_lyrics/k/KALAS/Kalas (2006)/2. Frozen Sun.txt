The shelter has given dawn to light
Wind walker has taken the after sight

Aloof in the snow on a cloudy day
Lost in the woods and there's nothing left to say
A spirit is seen in the frozen sun
Human condition has become undone

Away with the mind of an acid child
Reveal the secrets of atlantian age
A journey is taken through the arcane sea
The medicine man hands the key

A prince of earth choice dealt a pawn
His father's blood must spill beyond
To salvage a race for a greater good
A throne usurped by the blades black hood

Release the guillotine and face the frozen sun
The gods have passed decree to let the souls live on

The hand of fate unmoved by deed
A god of judgment less appeased
The tide of earth brings the greater doom
A civilized age an ocean tomb

The shelter has given dawn to light
Wind walker has taken the after sight
