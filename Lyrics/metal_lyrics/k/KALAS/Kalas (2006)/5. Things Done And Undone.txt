If we never could
Don't you know we always would
And if we couldn't be
Un-live our reality

And if you follow me
We'll do things that set us free
And if the storm has grown
Live what we've sown

What if our gems don't shine
Don't you know that it all takes time
Won't you just be my friend
We'll drink this to the end

Look at me somber now I'm lost in my space
Can't you wait counterfeit soul clouds in my face
Centering opposites flow, world of my soul
Under me rivers that flow with blood

Androids lift dusk upon, fall away masks of dismay
Sacred heart psalms upon rivers of stone made of clay
Witches soul cast atop mountains that led us astray
Knowledge is sown in this song of dust
