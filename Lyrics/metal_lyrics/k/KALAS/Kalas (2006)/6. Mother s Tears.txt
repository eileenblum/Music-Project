Mother of tears torn down, death betrays
Fallen my friend, now are glasses are raised
We've walked a million miles are we saved
So young and bold in the hour of death
We lived a life full to the last breath

Our ways of living had led to the tomb
Regrets away not scared of our doom
The fall of myself has appeased other wounds
The spider's web silver light in the gloom

Oh how I prayed for you my wayward bastard son
Edge of life the reaper's done
And if I say to you I miss your holy soul
Death the dealer digs your hole

Mother of tears torn down death betrays
