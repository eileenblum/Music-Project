Sacred, wicked, godless victim
Bastards pain the blind
Earthly garden, re-seek Sodom
Eat thrice, jackals hide
Dead black flowers, all that cowers
Drugs that clear your mind
Lesser demon, dark their treason
Opiate divine

Black gates crumbling, death comes tumbling
Praying for your time
Sacred liar, troubles dire
Shoot your way to high
Dead black flowers, all that cowers
Drugs that clear your mind
Lesser demon, dark their treason
Opiate divine

We walk amongst this crowd
With one foot in the grave
We talk amongst this crowd
And miracles would save
And if you cared to listen
You'd that we were slaves
The blind, the blind

We desolate our veins
With pleasure in our cage
We kill the light inside
And replace it with rage
The blind, the blind
