Voyager burns off the fuel
And enters the sky
Wasted the progress of man
As asteroids fly by

Liftoff has taken us out
Ascending from earth
Afterburn rockets have fallen
To give us berth

Dark are our days
Black are our nights
Cosmonauts know
That we could die

Wondrous sights have unveiled
The crimson dusk
Faltered the landing approach
Father to child

Dark are our days
Black are our nights
Astronauts know
That we could die

Falling fast, forgotten past
Seeking the life of new spheres
Runes arcane, found to be
Promising life after earth
Terraform, planet's core
Could possibly sustain our lives

Driving our souls, our endless flight
All of us know that we could die
Driving our souls, our endless flight
All of us know that we could die

Voyager burns off fuel
And enters the sky
Wasted the progress of man
As asteroids fly by
