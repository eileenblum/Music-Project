Infecting you, force my addiction to keep you confined
Handing you rope that's not enough to climb
Waste your days, I'll put you in your place and you will find
Cash you in for something drunk enough to climb

Glass princess, you know you're not too young to shine
Kneel to me, do what you have to survive
Worshiping, barely breath to stay alive
Woe

Too young to die
You're not too young to die
Too young to die
You're not too young to die

A serpent's kiss
A vein you might have missed
And now you cry
Tragic mess
Now that you've scored your test
You're fucking high
Woe

Poison gifts I give to you
Junkie
Construct your prison that's been in mind
Victim
Altered death with your last breath unkind
Whoa
Woe
