Malevolent incubus born unto forgo its name
Sword in mouth rips apart nations who conquest to gain
Killing the media turns screws to twist tongue its tales

Rebuilt the Babylon forged upon ashes of flesh
Construct machinery, chokes and constricts you to death

The soldier is left behind
All he has is his state of mind
Do you care to death defy
Now we're dropped behind enemy lines

Curmudgeon reprobate speaks forth
And Proclaims his name
All those who've fallen and worshipped
Are seared by his flame
Flame

The soldier is left behind
All he has is his state of mind
Do you care to death defy
Now we're dropped behind enemy lines

The soldier is ill
His war has begun
