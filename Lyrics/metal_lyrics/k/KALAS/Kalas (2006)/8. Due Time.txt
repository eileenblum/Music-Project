Unclean souls seek the divine
Earthly pleasures so unkind
Won't you take away
This pain from a tattered life
Don't you heal and help us find

Faded memories have died
All that haunts us is alive
Walk us through the gates
And show us what to find
Living darkness we are blind

Lost our souls, seek the divine
Earthly pleasures so unkind
Hands are tied upon the wheel
Beaten down we shall not kneel

Congregate, dominate, tied down tight, this is our time
Dig your holes, you're made of gold, now you will learn how to die
Ears will bleed, ignore your plead, your mind now anticipates death
Pleasure to enforce on you for all of the gold that you kept

Lost our souls, seek the divine
Earthly pleasures so unkind
Hands are tied upon the wheel
Wayward
