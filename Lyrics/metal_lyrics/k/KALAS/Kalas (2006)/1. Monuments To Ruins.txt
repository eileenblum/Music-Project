Cry for the children who die
For the ones who hang below the bridge
Are punished for their crimes
Hate, and don't you hesitate
For they take the world by storm in bombing runs
And kill for their mandate

We are the ones who watch
We write in every law
We bring the hammer down
And crush you big or small

Bow, for the end is now
For your eyes have swollen shut and killed your life
So long you live in doubt
Crawl to the terrible fall
When your reasons give away to torture you
There's nothing left at all

We are the final wall
We pinpoint all your flaws
We break the hourglass
And cut you with the shards

Some people say the end of time
Others have seen and just deny

Cry for the children who die
For their sacrifice in this earthly vice
Red for the blood they shed
For their holy beds
Cause they're living dead
Because they're living dead

We are the ones who watch
We write in every law
We bring the hammer down
And crush you big or small
We are the final wall
We pinpoint all your flaws
We break the hourglass
And cut you with the shards
