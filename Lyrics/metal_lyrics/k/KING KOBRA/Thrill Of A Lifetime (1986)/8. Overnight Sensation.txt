Gettin' ready for the shake up
Tonight's the night you steal the show
Crusin' down the exposition
You laugh to yourself 'cause they don't know

It's been a long road to the top
You keep on going
'Cause you know you'll never stop
But they think...

You're an overnight sensation
You got your wish upon a star
The latest thing across the nation
Just an overnight
Another overnight sensation

A girl is walking down the boulevard
She wants to be a movie star someday
She gets a call from the picture man
He says honey I think you've got what it takes

It's what she's worked for all her life
But they don't know
They say she made it overnight
They say...

You're an overnight sensation
You got your wish upon a star
The latest thing across the nation
Just an overnight
Another overnight sensation
