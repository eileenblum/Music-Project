It's after midnight, the magical time
You've got that look in your eyes
The creature within you begins to emerge
You start to realize

Your instincts are sharp, like the blade of a knife
To serve your every need
Stalking your prey, like a wolf in the night
The hunger starts to feed

You're hearts beating faster
And your pulse starts to rise

You're a party animal
Running throught the night
If you dare to cross the line
You're a party animal

You seek to find your forbidden desire
And nothing stands in your way
Releasing the anguish of unhuman emotion
You need it every day

It's part of a nature
We all have inside

We're the party animals
Running through the night
And we dare to cross the line
We're the party animals

We're the party animals
Running through the night
And we dare to cross the line
We're the party animals
