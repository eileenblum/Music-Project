Look around, what do you see
Wounded lovers in retreat
Two by two, they're carried away
Never to admit their defeat

Drop your guard and your weapons
We all need someone to love

Girl, we'll fight our battles side by side
'Cause girl, only the strong will survie
They will survive

Keep your eyes turned toward mine
And you won't see the shadows
Of lonely days and lonely nights
Where there are no tomorrows

There's no need to run and hide girl
We all need someone to love

Girl, we'll fight our battles side by side
'Cause girl, only the strong will survive
They will survive

Drop your guard and your weapons
We all need someone to love

Girl, we'll fight our battles side by side
'Cause girl, only the strong will survive
They will survivie
...We will survive
