I've been waiting for this
And waiting for you
To wake up and be the one you need
You sure need me now, I won't let you down
See, there's an old friend who's still around

Seems I've been waiting forever
For so long I've carried this torch
And I feel the spark burnin' brighter
Than it did before

This raging fire
Will never go out
This raging fire
Will light our way home
This fire
Will never go out
It'll burn through the doubt, tell you you're not
Alone

So many words
That you always say
Afraid they'd be frail and
Fade away
You said that was love
With only one look
I read every glance like our
Favorite book

I feel like I'm keeping a vigil
And not really sure you'd be there
But I'll catch the flame of a candle
That burns for you, I swear

This raging fire
Will never go out
This raging fire
Will light our way home
This fire
Will never go out
It'll burn through the doubt, tell you you're not
Alone

I've been waiting, waiting forever
For this raging fire
