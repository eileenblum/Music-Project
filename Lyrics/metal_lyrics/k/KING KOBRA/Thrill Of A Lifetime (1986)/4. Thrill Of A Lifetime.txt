People say I'm crazy
But I'm crazy for you
For you there's not anything
That I wouldn't do

'Cause everytime you touch me
You're driving me insane
Your love is so satisifying
It makes me want it again

'Cause you're a thrill
A thrill of a lifetime
You give me such a thrill
A thrill of a lifetime

I know that I've been waiting
My whole life through
To find the kind of love I need
From a girl like you

'Cause when I feel you touch me
It's driving me insane
Your love is so satisifying
I've got to have it again

People say I'm crazy
But I'm crazy for you
And there's not anything baby
That I wouldn't do, oh no
