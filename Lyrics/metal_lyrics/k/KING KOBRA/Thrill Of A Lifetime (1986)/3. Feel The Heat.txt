You're feeling by the heat
Won't you walk into the room?
Watch a change in the weather
You're just one man on moon

If she only knew what she put you through
Every little motion spots a fire in you

Feel the heat
Rising from your desire
Feel the heat
Oh, She's gonna set your heart on fire

You get this burning sensation
From the fire in her veins
Give in to her temptations
And you won't feel any pain

Temperatures keep on rising
Liftin' you up off the ground
Take it to the limit
She won't let you down

Feel the heat
Rising from your desire
Feel the heat
Oh, She's gonna set your heart on fire

She use your heart
Like a summer breeze on a winner's night
Just steal your love
...Of the night
She makes you feel so right
