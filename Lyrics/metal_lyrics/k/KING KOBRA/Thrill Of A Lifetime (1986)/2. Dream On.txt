When I was a kid
I still see what we did
We were always on the run
It would seem
That you had a dream
That you could be anyone

I remember one day
An old man passed my way
He looked at me and he said:
Boy don't you cry
You reach for the sky
Boy you look straight ahead!

If you know what you want
And you know how to get it
Don't let any man
Let you forget it
If you know what you mean
You won't regret it
Dream On
That's what I say
You Dream on
Till love comes your way
You Dream On

And as time went by
As the many nights
The love and I would hide
Love to me
Was so easy so free
With no concerning, no burning inside

And the words of those nights
In the citylights
As the poisonbee, we went wild
She looked at me
And these words I can see
As plain as when I was a child

If you know what you want
And you know how to get it
Don't let any man
Let you forget it
If you know what you mean
You won't regret it
Dream on
That's what I say
You Dream On
Till love comes your way

You Dream On

Dream On

You better Dream On

You Dream On

So if you love and you lose
And you pay that fuse
And the times life don't work out
Don't you cry Jack
And don't you look back
You let these words ring out

If you know what you want
And you know how to get it
Don't let any man
Let you forget it
If you know what you mean
You won't regret it
Dream On
That's what I say
You Dream On
Till love comes your way
You Dream On

You better Dream On
You Dream On
You better Dream On
You Dream On
You better Dream On
You Dream On
You better Dream On
You Dream On
