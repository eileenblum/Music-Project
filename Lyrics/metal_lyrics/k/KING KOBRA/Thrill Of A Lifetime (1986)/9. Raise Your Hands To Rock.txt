The time has come to set the story straight
Kick out the lead and not be left to wait
We gotta stand and fight, shout until
We're heard
So come on hit the streets, get out and spread the word

It's time that we upset the nation
The fever is rising across all the lands
A passion, a power, a brand new sensation
Raise your hands, raise your hands

Raise your hands to rock
Rock, rock, rock
Raise your hands to rock
Rock, rock, rock

Show no mercy, never tell them why
Take no prisoners, sound the battle cry
We've got the wheels in motion, time to start the clock
Just stand up and believe, raise your hands to rock

We won't be put down any longer
We'll raise a new flag, where our Kobra Korp stands
Our numbers are growing, stronger and stronger
Raise your hands, raise your hands

Raise your hands to rock
Rock, rock, rock
Raise your hands to rock
Rock, rock, rock
