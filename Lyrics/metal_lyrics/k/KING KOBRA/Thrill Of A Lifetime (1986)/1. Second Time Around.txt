The bar was dark that night
But through the smoke filtered light
I saw the tears in your eyes
You knew our love was on the line
It was the second time
That this fool believed your lies

You'll never change
You had a good thing girl but
You threw it all away

What are you looking for
When you're walking out that door
I hope it can be found
Maybe you'll find love the second time around

Our love was my mistake
I knew that it would take
So much more than i could give
I hope we can be friends
'Cause i know that in the end
It's how you and i were meant to live

But i hope you change
So when you find a good thing girl
You won't throw it all away

What are you looking for
When you're walking out that door
I hope it can be found
Maybe you'll find love the second time around
