I can do anything when I choose
Got everything but I got nothing to lose
Go anywhere from heaven to hell
I might find the devil, you can never tell

There's a thousand hills and valleys
A million dams and streams
An ocean of eternity
Between my hopes and dreams

Never say die, iron eagle
Nothing's forever, now or ever
Never say die, iron eagle
Never look back, never say die

Don't try and bring my soul to the ground
My spirit remembers old mountain magic sounds
Against all odds I'll come out on top
'Cause I never learned the meaning of what meant stop

There are walls and there are bridges
But no problems when you're free
An adventure past the horizon always beckons me

Never say die, iron eagle
Nothing's forever, now or ever
Never say die, iron eagle
Never look back, never say die

Never say die, iron eagle
Nothing's forever, now or ever
Never say die, iron eagle
Never look back, never say die

Never say die, iron eagle
Nothing's forever, now or ever
Never say die, iron eagle
Never look back, never say die
