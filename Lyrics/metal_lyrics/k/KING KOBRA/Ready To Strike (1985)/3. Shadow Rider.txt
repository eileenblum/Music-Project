[King Kobra / H. Banger / Proffer]

[Chorus:]
Midnight is my time
I'm the Shadow Rider
I come from the other side
I'm the Shadow Rider

Dark shadows and shifting eyes
There ain't no trust on the street
Broken windows and alibis
You can feel the tension in the August heat

I hear the call from the firing line
I hear the sound of the bell
When there's some action, I make it mine
And I do it well

[Chorus]

I'm lookin' for danger signs
Don't let me catch you out of line
Midnight is the time for the Shadow Rider

Every night is another scene
And I'm a part of it all
Life is more than a magazine
Cause the harder you run, the harder you fall

A chain reaction of dominoes
If your back's to the wall
I'll stand beside you and take the blows
I'll catch you if you fall

[Chorus]

[Solo]

A chain reaction of dominoes
If your back's to the wall
I'll stand beside you and take the blows
I'll catch you if you fall

[Chorus]

I'm lookin' for danger signs
Don't let me catch you out of line
Midnight is my time, I'm the Shadow Rider
