[Proffer / Gillstrom / Gillstrom / Langen / Christon / Harvey]

When I see what I want
I'm gonna take it
If it's against some law
You can bet I'm gonna break it
My need to feed
Gives me the will to survive
I gotta find it fast
To keep me alive
I can't believe my...

[Chorus:]
Hunger - I want it so bad
I can taste it
It drives me mad
To see it wasted
When I need it so bad that it's burnin' me
I'm hungry

I'd do anything to get it
And feel no regret
But time is running out
I ain't found it yet
I can't believe my...

[Chorus]

[Solo]

It's burnin' me
It's burnin' me
It's burnin' me
It's burnin', it's burnin' me, burnin' me
