[King Kobra]

[Chorus:]
Breakin' out
And I'm singin' it from the heart
Bustin' out
I'm bustin' out of this empty shell
Breakin' out

Sit alone and look into my eyes
Wonder who it is I see
Listen to the voices on the radio
Everyone I've tried to be

All my life I've always wanted to be known
The way to find my happiness
I'm just tryin' to prove to someone I'm myself
This is me I must confess

[Chorus]

So I moved and made my home another place
The city lights where I'd be seen
People say I'm takin' chances with my life
There's nothin' else I want to be

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
