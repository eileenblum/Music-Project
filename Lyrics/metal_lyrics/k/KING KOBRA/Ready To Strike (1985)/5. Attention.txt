[King Kobra / H. Banger / Proffer]

Let's go!

[Chorus:]
We're gonna get your attention
Before the night is through
And when we get your attention
The we're gonna voodoo you
You know we're gonna voodoo you

Electric night
Standing room only
You'd sell your soul for a backstage pass
There's a buzz in the crowd
The amp lights are glowin'
Cause good news travels fast

Keep it steady
Dim the lights
The boys are ready to rock tonight

[Chorus]

We're casting a spell
We've got you surrounded
There is no escape for you now
You'll be barkin' at the moon
Before the night is over
And you thought that you did not know how

The beat is steady
The time is right
These boys are ready to rock you tonight

[Chorus]

[Solo]

We're gonna get your attention (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're gonna get your attention (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're gonna get your attention (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're gonna get your attention, we're gonna get it, get it now!

[Chorus]

Oh, got ya!
