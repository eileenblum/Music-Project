[King Kobra / H. Banger / Proffer]

You grew up on rock 'n' roll
So why deny it now
To leave your passion in the cold
Just won't be allowed

Everyday your mom and dad
Tell you it's a sin
But your rockin' brothers and sisters
Will stick by you through thick and thin

And the beat goes on and on and on
And you can feel it proud
A generation rockin' on

[Chorus:]
Get ready of the shake up - uh huh
Everybody wake up - oh yeah
Get ready of the shake up - uh huh
Get ready of the shake up - uh huh

You've got homework and yard work
It's way too much hard work
But that can't hold you back
Come Friday night on the boulevard
You'll have a rock 'n' roll attack

They'll be raisin' their fists to the power chords
Playin' on the radio
Sayin' this is what we've all been livin' for
Cause we're all part of the show

And the beat goes on and on and on
And you can feel it proud
A generation rockin' on

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus (x2)]
