[King Kobra / H. Banger / Proffer]

Up here on this tightrope
Tryin' not to fall
The spotlight is on me tonight
I want to have it all
Feelin' stronger
I'm a wild beast in my prime
I need to feed my appetite
I've got to make you mine
And you can't fight this obsession
It's a dam that's bound to break
I was born with this aggression
There is no escape, cause...

[Chorus:]
I'm Ready To Strike
Cocked and loaded tonight
I'm Ready To Strike
I've got you in my sight
I'm ready

I've got these primal instincts
These animal desires
And I know that you know
The kind or urges you inspire
It's a hunger
I'm a raging carnivore
As soon as a devour you
I'm ravenous for more
And I'll give you private lessons
On survival in the wild
Leave some permanent impression
Make a woman of a child, and...

[Chorus]

I'm wild - I'm an animal
I need to feed my appetite
I'm waiting, and Ready To Strike

[Solo]

[Chorus]
