[King Kobra / Proffer]

You're gettin' all dressed up
On a Saturday night
I'm afraid to ask where you're goin'
Cause it always starts a fight

You tell me that you're goin' out
With a couple of friends
But with that perfume that you're wearin'
Those friends make no sense

And you never want to give me a straight answer at all
Every time I try to take command
You say, "Honey, try to understand"

[Chorus:]
Having second thoughts about you
Should I play or walk away
What should I do? (What should I do?)
Having second thoughts about you
Second thoughts about you

Together our love is hot
We set each other on fire
And it's only for the moment
But there's more that a require

Every time I find myself
On this merry-go-round
There is one thing that I'm sure of
It's either up or down

And you never wanna listen to what I gotta say
You never wanna listen babe
Every time I try to take command
You say, "Honey, please try to understand"

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]

Second thoughts about you
Second thoughts about you
Should I play or walk away
Second thoughts about you
