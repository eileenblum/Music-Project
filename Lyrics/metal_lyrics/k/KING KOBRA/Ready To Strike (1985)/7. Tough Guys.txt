[King Kobra / H. Banger / Proffer]

The sound of thunder crashed down the alleyway
Who can remember the last time it rained
As you pushed through the crowd
Into the mean streets of town
There was something I needed to explain

You accuse my of having a heart that was made of stone
I'm hard on the outside, that's how I survive
Baby deep in my soul
Is where you had complete control
But you'll never see a teardrop in my eye

[Chorus:]
Don't ask why...
Cause we all know that tough guys don't cry
The world's greatest lie
Is that all of us tough guys don't cry

It's three thirty-seven, just me and my empty glass
My vision is blurred, it's so hard to see
Was I really so blind
Was I out of my mind
But you'll never hear my apology

[Chorus]

I'm a tough guy on the outside
And I'm cryin' on the inside
Hear me cry...

[Solo]

[Chorus]

You know all of us tough guys don't cry
Yes we all know that tough guys don't cry
Yes we all know that tough guys don't cry
Yes we all know that tough guys don't cry...
