[Proffer / Gillstrom / Gillstrom / Langen / Christon / Harvey]

[Chorus:]
Just give me a piece of the rock
All I need is the key to the lock
Just give me a piece, a piece of the rock

Cast out, lost and all alone
Exiled, my existence unknown
My belief in myself
I can make it on my own
All I want is a piece, a piece of that rock

All the paths that I've walked on
All the doors that I've knocked on

[Chorus]

I promise I'll never stop
Just take me right to the top
Just give me a piece, a piece of the rock

[Solo]

Am I foolin' myself, or am I foolin' you?
Do I need to fool anyone at all?
I think I'll follow, no, maybe I'll lead
On my piece of the rock, I'm gonna stand tall

All the paths that I've walked on
All the doors that I've knocked on

[Chorus (x2)]
