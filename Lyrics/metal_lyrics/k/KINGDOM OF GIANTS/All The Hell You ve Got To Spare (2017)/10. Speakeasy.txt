You have your visions and I have mine
And they may be different but
Who's to say who's right
I'll give you space and I'll take mine
But I'd rather find a way to coincide
Oh you think I'm living wrong
I should live in fear
I should play along
"Where will you get if you're only singing songs"
I guess I'll know when I blow out both my lungs

You keep trying to save me
Trying to save me
But you couldn't save yourself
(you couldn't save yourself)
You keep trying to save me
Trying to save me
But it wasn't any help
You only know what you've been told
But you put it on yourself to buy the lies they sold
You put it on yourself to buy the lies they sold

I watched the leaves turn
I watched them rot away
I saw the snowfall
And turn back into the rain
Years are flying by you're living in a cage
I think it's time you step outside
And feel the sunlight glisten off your skin

You keep trying to save me
Trying to save me
But you couldn't save yourself
You couldn't save yourself
You keep trying to save me
Trying to save me
But it wasn't any help
It wasn't any help

The fear of failure
It has us play the cards we're dealt
The fear of suffering
Is worse than suffering itself
It's funny how it all worked out

You keep trying to save me
Trying to save me
But you couldn't save yourself
You couldn't save yourself
You keep trying to save me
Trying to save me
But it wasn't any help
You only know what you've been told
And if you don't know
Well now you know

You keep trying to save me
