Feeling like I am made out of string
Getting caught up on everything
The only way to escape any pain
To pull away and leave my body frayed

I'm a bit run down my friend
I'm a bit run down at the moment
I'm a bit run down they said
But they said it like I hadn't noticed

Feeling like I am running in place
Two steps back for every one that I take

When my demons come out to fight
They claw and they bite
They bring their own knives
They don't fight fair
Now I need them to open my eyes
Shed light on my life
They keep me in line

I'm a bit run down my friend
I'm a bit run down at the moment
I'm a bit run down they said
But they said it like I hadn't noticed

You don't know the half of it

They told me I need a religion to follow
Don't we all though
They told me that I need religion father
He looked right down and told me
Son don't bother
There was never a time that I prayed in church
And now I find myself praying for the
Whole fucking world

I'm a bit run down my friend
I'm a bit run down at the moment
I'm a bit run down they said
But they said it like I hadn't noticed
