When I open up to speak
You hear another voice it's so frustrating
Paint a picture in unlikely shades
(a world in which we get our shit together)
Which side of the grave are we on in the end

I can't shake the thought
That I'm a fading memory
I can't turn it off
It's like a wave of disbelief

Every time we're forced to fill the spaces
With another love another lie
Do you ever wonder can we escape it
Give it another go another try
Hesitation as I turn to leave
'cause when I look at you my world stops spinning
Which side of the page are we on in the end

I can't shake the thought
That I'm a fading memory
I can't turn it off
It's like a wave of disbelief
