Can I find my way through this maze before it turns to grey?

Will all I ever say be more than just a copy?
Or am I living in a world stuck on repeat?

I know, I should find comfort in similarities
But instead it's draining me of any creativity
And now I fear we're merely tracing outlines
Left by others overtime
I've been on the search for reason
Looking to make sense of my life
While breaking down true meaning

Will all I ever say be more than just a copy?
Or am I living in a world stuck on repeat?

How many times, (How many times) can we use the same old played out lines?
(Sever the ties, Open your eyes)
I've heard this shit a thousand times
I know I'm guilty and so I'll still be
Searching for my way out of this maze

Do I have nothing new to add?
Do I have nothing left to offer?
The scary part of it all
Is that everything I'm saying has been said before
So say your line and move along, move along

I've been so scared of getting older
Pushing 27 now with nothing to show for
The time spent and dedication
Spilling out my guts onto this piece of paper
Yea

Can I find my way through this maze before it turns to gray?

Will I ever be anything more than a fucking copy?
Will I ever be anything, anything at all

Can I find my way through this maze before it turns to gray?
