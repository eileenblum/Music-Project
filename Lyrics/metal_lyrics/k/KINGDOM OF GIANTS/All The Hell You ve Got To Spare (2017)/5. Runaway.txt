Should I follow the birds
To some place warm
To get away from the clouds
And get away from the storm

Can there be a change in me?
It is an art, becoming who you are
Is it too late for me to be set free?

Should we follow our nerves
To some place far
We'll leave without any trace
And reinvent who we are

It seems no matter how many times I run
How many miles I put between us
Just when I think I am safe and sound
You find a way back in and there's no way out

Can there be a change in me?
It is an art, becoming who you are
Is it too late for me to be set free?

[Bridge]
I used to think that I could change the world
Now I'm afraid I can't even change myself

Can you see
A change in me?
It is an art
Becoming who you are
Can there be a change in me?
It is an art, becoming who you are
Is it too late for me to be set free?
Can you see
A change in me?
It is an art
Becoming who you are
