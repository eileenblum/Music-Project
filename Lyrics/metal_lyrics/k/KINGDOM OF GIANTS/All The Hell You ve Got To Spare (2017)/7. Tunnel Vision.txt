[feat. JT Cavey]Have I been consumed
Calculating every move
As if I've got something more important to prove
As if I am someone more important than you
Would I do it any different if I could choose
It feels so lifeless
It feels so numb

Achievement
Is the death of endeavor and birth of disgust
This is the trap of having something to live for
Everything else feels so lifeless
Feels so lifeless
Feels so cold and empty here
Follow your dreams
Abandon your losses
No matter what the cost is

Disregard your sanity
Leave it behind with your friends and family
You're under a spell not in front of a gun
Another rat in the race
Not fooling anyone

When did my body become so heavy
When did my actions start effecting so many
Through a life of contradictions
And a heart of good intentions
Will I ever find the balance
Between love and competition
I'm starting to lose my focus

If you're always pushing forward
Unable to see what you're moving towards
This isn't disease it's a disorder
Ego manifests defense as stubbornness
Again and again and again

Is it in my head
Is it all in my head

You're under a spell not in front of a gun
Another rat in the race
Not fooling anyone

When did my body become so heavy
When did my actions start effecting so many
Through a life of contradictions
And a heart of good intentions
Will I ever find the balance
Between love and competition
I'm starting to lose my focus

What once was full is empty now
A raging river into a drought
The landscapes that were shaped
Have been laid to waste
What once was full is empty now
A raging river into a drought
The landscapes that were shaped
Are forever etched in the messes we've made
