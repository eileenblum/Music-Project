Give me all the hell that you've got to spare

Death hovers over an immense distress
Playing victim after victim
Without missing a step
I am so sick of this
Watching everyone I love just die around me
I'm not alone in this
Am I gonna be a man or will I cry about it
But it wont change that

I felt the pain for both of us
As you stared in silence 'til reality struck
I made amends it tore me up
Tears rise to distressed eyes
But I wont go blind

Young enough to hurt like hell
And old enough to understand
What a deadly combination
For two confused young men
An underlying pain
Somehow you hid it away
Listen up don't worry kid
We'll be OK

I felt the pain for both of us
As you stared in silence till reality struck
I made amends it tore me up
Tears rise to distressed eyes

Tears rise to distressed eyes
But I wont go blind

Give me all the hell that you've got to spare

I felt the pain for both of us
As you stared in silence till reality struck
I made amends it tore me up
Tears rise to distressed eyes

And now I've got the world on my shoulders
My heart in my hands
I feel my face getting colder
With the sun to my back
I am too young for this
Why does everyone I love just die around me
But I'll man up for this
Am I gonna be a man or will I cry about it
