I was young and innocent
NaÃ¯ve and ignorant
When they told me it was time
It was time to choose time to decide
How I would spend the rest of my life
"Be careful what you're learning
We don't care about your happiness
We only care about your earnings"

Lost without control
Can someone help me
Find my way back home
(how can I find my way)

Ignorance is blisters on my hands
Sweat dripping from my face
Only twenty dollars left
If I can make it stretch to the next check I'll be OK
I'll be OK

I didn't follow my heart
"You'll never have a future"
Because you said there was no money in art
"All you care about is happiness
You'll always be a fucking loser"

Lost without control
Can someone help me
Find my way back home
(how can I find my way)

I might be broke
I may not sleep in my own bed
But I can live with myself
And never think what could have been

They told me put my
Hands in the air now
Life isn't fair
Run it
Hands in the air now
Life isn't fair

Lost without control
Can someone help me
Find my way back home
(how can I find my way)

I told them put their
Hands in the air
My life isn't theirs
Fuck it
Hands in the air
My life isn't theirs
