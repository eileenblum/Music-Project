Dig in our heels
Rattle the cage
Banish the weakness
Assemble your strength
Why settle for failure
When success is within reach
Do I need something tangible
To replace what you cannot see

Distance travelled
Never measured
Put pressure to pavement
Keep your head centered
Through all of the trials and disbelief
I'm getting deeper and deeper into the game

I'm tired of leaving
But I'm bored to death staring at my ceiling

Moments lost
Tears in the rain but at what cost
Dig in our heels
Rattle the cage
Banish the weakness
Assemble your strength

I'm tired of leaving
But I'm bored to death staring at my ceiling

What a heavy burden to carry
Are you sure you want to be a visionary
You know you're living
When it all becomes a blur
Morally bankrupt and insecure
