[feat. Rory Rodriguez of Dayseeker]This awakening
This questioning of our mortality
This awakening
this questioning of our mortality keeps us alive

You didn't ask for my permission to take his life
You didn't ask for my opinion or those he left behind 

No matter how dark it seems to be now
Where there is life, there is always hope
Give me something to believe in when the world has turned it's back on me
Now let's go

Give me something to believe in while my heart is in my hands
Give me something to believe in when the world has turned it's back on me
Please don't give up on me

I'm here to write this letter
I've got this pen and paper
I'm here to write this letter to show things will get better.

I'd like to leave an echo whispering down the ways
Of happy times, laughing times, and bright and sunny days
I'd like the tears of those who grieve to dry before the sun
To live in peace and solace when the deed of life is done
I turned to music when my father passed
and when my brother left this world there was no turning back
I know I'm meant to be the rock but lately I've been feeling weaker than I
ever thought

No matter how dark it seems to be now,
Where there is life, there is always hope
Give me something to believe in when the world has turned it's back on me

Oh god the mistakes that I have made
How many souls have I harmed along the way?
I was certain until now there was no heaven or hell
But when you're laying on that bed you will take anyone's help
All I want is to be remembered
To leave a mark and to live forever
Etch my name into the stone for eternity and forevermore

I know
I know what it's like to feel alone
Everything i touch now either dies or turns to stone

Now press rewind
And play it back a thousand times
You can pick me up or you can throw me down
You can chew me up and you can spit me out
My heart grows founder, it only makes me stronger
To anyone that's picked me up and to anyone that's
held me down
My heart grows fonder, it only makes me stronger now
Stronger now
It only makes me stronger

Oh god the mistakes that I have made
How many souls have I harmed along the way?
I was certain until now there was no heaven or hell
But when you're laying on that bed you will
take anyone's help
All I want is to be remembered
To leave a mark and to live forever.
Etch my name into the stone for eternity and forevermore.
