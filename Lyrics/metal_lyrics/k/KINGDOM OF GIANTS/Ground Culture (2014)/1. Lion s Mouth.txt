Drifting through the desert you will find them
Pledging allegiance to pursuits of immortality
You think they're misled and blind to the truth
When they essentially believe the same fucking thing as you

Their very core beliefs permeate our city streets
A death cult convening on every Sunday
A single spark of doubt Illuminates the darkest corners
You're casting shadows on the walls ignoring your desires
You claim "divinity"
I insist it's insanity
When let loose the hounds of hell won't tell us apart
They'll rip us apart
They won't tell us apart
Every man, woman, child
They'll rip them apart
Blasphemous or innocent
We'll be blown apart.

I don't need a lion's mouth to command greatness
I don't need a lion's mouth to bring the storm

Burden ignorance with understanding
To the "kings" and the churches "saints"
To everything that is weak with age
Crawl back to the caves that you came from
Choke on the scripture every last page.

A single spark of doubt Illuminates the darkest corners
You're casting shadows on the walls ignoring your desires
You claim "divinity".
I insist it's insanity
When let loose the hounds of hell won't tell us apart
They'll rip us apart
They won't tell us apart
Every man, woman, child
They'll rip them apart
Blasphemous or innocent
They'll rip the world apart

I don't need a lion's mouth to command greatness
I don't need a lion's mouth to bring the storm
