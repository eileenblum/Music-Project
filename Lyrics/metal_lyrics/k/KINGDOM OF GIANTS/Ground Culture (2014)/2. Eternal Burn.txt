Your so-called "faith"
your precious path through Heaven's Gates
What is the price you'll pay living a life of hate?
You focus on the past and Holy Ghost
when your fellow man and present are what matters most
So sweep your filth under the carpet
Always remember:
No harm, no foul,
No guilt, no conscience

You seem to think there's only two ways out
Beneath the surface or above the clouds

What if I could show you that we all are one?
What if I could show you we were born from love?
What if I could show you that we all are one?
What if I could show you we were born from love?
Will I burn? Will I burn?
Can I speak my mind or am I out of turn?

I know its up to me, and I know it's hard to breath
I know it's up to me, and timing is everything
And now it's killing me, I'm foreseeing everything
Your hopes are upon a shelf
History repeats itself

Just know that fear does not control me
It's just a product of imagination
Fear does not control me
It's deprivation to my self creation
Burn

You seem to think there's only two ways out
Beneath the surface or above the clouds

What if I could show you that we all are one?
What if I could show you we were born from love?
What if I could show you that we all are one?
What if I could show you we were born from love?
Will I burn? Will I burn?
Can I speak my mind or am I out of turn?
Will I burn? Will I burn?
Can I speak my mind or am I out of turn?

I'd rather die standing on my feet than live a sheltered life from on my knees
If we are here 'til the end of time
Let's take a chance and give love a try
I'd rather die standing on my feet, than live a sheltered life from on my knees
There's so much more to learn without living in fear of eternal burn
Without living in fear of eternal burn
Can I speak my mind or am I out of turn?
I'd rather die standing on my feet than live a sheltered life from on my knees
If we are here till the end of time, let's take a chance and give love a try
I'd rather die standing on my feet, than live a sheltered life from on my knees
There's so much more to learn without living in fear of eternal burn
