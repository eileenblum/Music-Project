Here, we need to reach the sun.

Awaken the Vesper,
Let the midnight hour come to a stand-still
And you will see me for what I am inside.
A creature, a monster,
I'm anything but ordinary.
You will see for what I am inside.
A creature,
I'm a monster.

I cannot control the urge to kill
As I no longer know
Who I once was
Who I once was
Who I once was
Who I once was

Your time will come.
Take the lives of man before they pull the trigger.
I cannot control the urge to kill as I no longer know.
Trade your innocence for insanity,
Trade you teeth for fangs.
Take no prisoners is our strategy
Our survival means your casualties.

You'll never reach the sun.

Awaken the Vesper,
Let the midnight hour come to a stand-still
And you will see me for what I am inside.
Who I once was
Who I once was
Who I once was
Who I once was

And now these bones will break until all of you know we're monsters,
Within us all are monsters.
