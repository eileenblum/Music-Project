Time is running out

I'm at a loss for words.
My mind i aching searching for inspiration
In every little thing now
I live in hesitation

Why would anyone care what I might have to say?
I don't know anything better than anybody
You put your trust in my voice I promised I would guide the way
Now I need your help to light the path, so dim
That I have seemed to stray.
That I have seemed to stray

My nerves are in a knot
I need to write a novel but I cant construct a thought
Over-thinking every line, I swear I've heard it all a thousand times

Hold on! Hold on!
The feelings there and then it's gone
I'm done! I'm done!
This is what I get for waiting so long

My voice is straining, searching for inspiration
In every little thing now I live in repetition.

Why would anyone care what I might have to say?
I don't know anything better than anybody
You put your trust in my voice I promised I would guide the way
Now I need your help to light the path , so dim
That I have seemed to stray

The art of survival is a story that will never end

I'm supposed to be an artist, to be there when you need me most
I'm supposed to be an artist, to inspire when I'm nothing but a ghost

I thought I had it but the moments lost, I tried to grasp it but it was a
fleeting thought
Drawing blanks and crooked circles trying everything I can
I can't help but ask myself, why would anybody even care?

That'll work
No it won't
Don't give in
Make it worth it
Make it worth it.

Why would anyone care what I might have to say?
I don't know anything better than anybody
You put your trust in my voice I promised I would guide the way
Now I need your help to light the path, so dim, that I have seemed to stray

The art of survival is a story that will never end

I'm supposed to be an artist, to be there when you need me most
I'm supposed to be an artist, to inspire when I'm nothing but a ghost
