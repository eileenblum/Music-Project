Every fear is manifesting
A coward stands before me
Transparent, I feel there's nothing I can do

I can't stand idly by
There are no whites in his eyes
Only in a child's fist as a tear falls from the sky
These embers turn to ashes, these ashes turn to dust.

What would you want me to do?
What would you want me to do?
I am the man now we are family through and through
You'll never understand that the bottle's taken over you

Take another sip, take another sip
When you're feeling down I hope you drown in it
Take another sip, take another sip
I hope you fucking drown in it

And now a boy cries out
Cries for his brothers hand
Together they have the strength of a thousand men.

My body is still
My eyes are closed
My bones are heavy
My senses go numb.
A soul deprived of the chance to live
Haunting memories, suppressed and dismissed

Under watching eye, her wings were stripped as you stood by
When the almighty won't make a stand,
I'll take things into my own hands

The door bursts open splintering into wooden bits
Revealing his hands held tight around her wrists

Time stands still for now everything has slowed down
It's not what I call love
We have no common ground.
This is a vicious cycle no one should live inside of

Swinging blindly in the dark
A son's promise unspoken
The dastard flees the scene bleeding, beaten, bruised and broken

My body is still
My eyes are closed
My bones are heavy
My senses go numb.
A soul deprived of the chance to live
Haunting memories, suppressed and dismissed
