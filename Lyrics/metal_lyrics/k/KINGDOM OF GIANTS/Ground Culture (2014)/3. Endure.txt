[feat. Ricky Armellino of This Or The Apocalypse]All I feel are parasites
And all I see are blinding lights
They've been brought here to shield your eyes
I might be hurt but I can fight, I can fight
I can fight

Terrified but I don't shake
My mind is ready I won't wait
These hands hold a story
Of hardship and heartbreak

We've been buried alive
Thrown out and left here to die
The doors of change have been
Locked from either side
Now the waters where I learned to swim
Will be the same that I drown my shame in

The vultures circle us
Showing us what's to come
Oh they hail the sun
And cast their shadows on everyone
Where were you the day we took it back?
Where were you when love was all we had?
I won't sit back and relax
Not while we're still fighting back
Where were you when love was all we had?

Time doesn't go back, doesn't go back
To the time that we thought that we had
I stare at the ground in my sleep
These things keep on following me
I tear apart all of the thread
That gave me a place to put down my head
Hide my fucking face
How many possibilities exist inside your world?
When you gonna wrap your head around?
What we've endured? What we've endured?

We've been buried alive
Thrown out and left here to die
The doors of change have been
Locked from either side
Now the waters where I learned to swim
Will be the same that I drown my shame in

The vultures circle us
Showing us what's to come
Oh they hail the sun
And cast their shadows on everyone
Where were you the day we took it back?
Where were you when love was all we had?
I won't sit back and relax
Not while we're still fighting back
Where were you when love was all we had?

They've failed their words but we won't fall again
They've failed us all, this is the end

Yeah

The vultures circle us
Showing us what's to come
Oh they hail the sun
And cast their shadows on everyone
I won't sit back and relax
Not while we're still fighting back
Not after everything that we've been through
I said I'd give this my all
I said I'd give it my heart
Now they've taken everything from me

Now they've taken everything from me
I won't sit back and relax
Not while we're still fighting back
Where were you when love was all we had?
(When love was all we had)
I won't sit back and relax
Not while we're still fighting back
Where were you when love was all we had?
(When love was all we had)
I won't sit back and relax
Not while we're still fighting back
Where were you the day we took it back?

This is the end
They use our fear as a selling point
They have us cornered
We fall apart
Unravel, unwind
Distract, divide
