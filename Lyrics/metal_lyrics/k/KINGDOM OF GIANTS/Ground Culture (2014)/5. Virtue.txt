Will I ever find my place?
Lost in this world of hopeless faith
Can I prove myself or have a sealed my fate?
When the man you wish you were meets the man that you became
Stop searching for a place to hide your blame

This song is for the dreamers
Laughing in the face of those who gave in and settled and say
that you should do the same.
This song goes out to anyone who knows their heart is strong
Who would do anything to protect anyone they love
This song goes out to all the kids who never had a chance
Who gave their everything but never seem to get it back
This song goes out to anyone who knows their heart is true
This song goes out to you
