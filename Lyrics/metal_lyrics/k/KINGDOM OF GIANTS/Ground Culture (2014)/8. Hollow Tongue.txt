Bring forth your faults 'cause they're all you've got
I'm sick of sorting through your words, are they lies or not?
Is it all in your head?
Do you really believe?
Humor me, is it pride or self esteem?
Tell me now, is it pride or self esteem?

I'm not blind
I see right through you
You're like an open window
Lie like the boy and the wolf
'cause I'm not falling for you

If fortune favors the bold how will your story unfold?
Speaking with hollow tongues
Every word is a waste of breath from shallow lungs
Everything that you ever said turned out to be just dead noise in the end

You're fucking dead to me
So swallow every memory
The stench of failure's on your skin and travels to your bones.

Desolate in your own skin
Keep trying masks till you fit in
Shifting shapes to steal the light
You're burning out before you even shine

If fortune favors the bold how will your story unfold?
Speaking with hollow tongues
Every word is a waste of breath from shallow lungs
Everything that you ever said, turned out to be just dead noise in the end.

You've made your bed
Now toss and turn
As all your bridges burn
Lie like the boy and the wolf, because you'll never learn.
