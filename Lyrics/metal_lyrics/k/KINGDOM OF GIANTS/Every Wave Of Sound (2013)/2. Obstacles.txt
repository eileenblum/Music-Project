We are the power in everyone.
We are the dance of the moon and the sun.
We are the hope that will never hide.
We are the turning of the tides.

Left in the dark with our lives in your hands.
We trusted your judgement, you promised us fans.
Month after month we wrote checks in your name.
With nothing to show it's all part of the game.

We are the power in everyone.
We are the dance of the moon and the sun.
We are the hope that will never hide.
We are the turning of the tides.

Left in the dark with our lives in your hands.
We trusted your judgement you promised us fans.
Month after month we wrote checks in your name.
With nothing to show it's all part of the game.

This is all that we know, and to see us for what we've become:
A burning creation that has grown on our own.
We stand, we fight, to break ourselves into the light.
Leaving nothing to chance, nothing to luck.
Your only intention to make a quick buck, you fuck.

They'll make you an offer you can't refuse,
and they'll promise your dreams will come true.
Just be careful who you trust, you won't amount to much,
if you let them walk all over you.

Make sure you let them know,
That all is to move and grow.

We are the power in everyone.
We are the dance of the moon and the sun.
We are the hope that will never hide.
We are the turning of the tides.
We are the power in everyone.
We are the dance of the moon and the sun.
We are the hope that will never hide.
We are the turning of the tides.

Our patience is wearing thin, and our composure as short as your walls.
I want to hear you admit you were wrong.
Say it to my face, you knew it all along.
Our patience is wearing thin, and our composure as short as your walls.
I want to hear you admit you were wrong.
Say it to my face, you knew it all along.

Fire Burns Brighter In The Dark (Burns brighter in the dark)

This is a wake up call To all those living underground,
we need you here we need you now.
To all those living in the dark,
don't be afraid to speak your mind before they buy your heart. (Buy your heart)

We are the power in everyone.
We are the dance of the moon and the sun.
We are the hope that will never hide.
We are the turning of the tides.
We are the power in everyone.
We are the dance of the moon and the sun.
We are the hope that will never hide.
We are the turning of the tides.
We are the power in everyone.
We are the dance of the moon and the sun.
We are the hope that will never hide.
We are the turning of the tides.
