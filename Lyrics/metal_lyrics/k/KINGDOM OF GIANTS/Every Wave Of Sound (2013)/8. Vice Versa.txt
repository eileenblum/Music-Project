"Be brave, don't back down"
These words are an echo to an ending
Passive I may seem but anger brews beneath

I watched their loyalty drift away
While my heart just sinks like a stone

How dare you step on my feet
To make up for your insecurities
What lies behind us and what lies before us
Are tiny matters compared to what lies within

We build, everything that you destroy
The hands of time aren't on your side here anymore
It seems like you have nowhere left to turn
You've found your way out
Now go find a place to fucking burn

And I hope you're happy now
Living in a world where no one ever wants you around
Marked with an "x" you're now a silhouette
Once a mountain of a man but you're a little bitch

I've grown tired of being angry
It's starting to wear me down
I'm done waiting for you
To come around you never gave a shit anyhow
I've grown tired of being angry
It's starting to wear me down

Don't ever run from your fears

You put your name on the line and now it's written in stone
I put my world in your hands you left me out in the cold
Whatever helped you sleep? I hope you're up counting sheep.
You put your name on the line and now it's written in stone
I put my world in your hands
You left me in the cold
I hope you know

We build, everything that you destroy
The hands of time aren't on your side here anymore
It seems like you have nowhere left to turn
You've found your way out
Now go find a place to fucking burn

Don't ever run from your fears
