I never used to dream like this.
Sifting through the sand.
Searching for something worth keeping.
Something to believe in.
I never lie awake at night.
Staring at the ceiling.
For the answers I'm seeking.
Is anybody listening?

I hear you knocking at my door, but I'm not ready. (Not Ready)
I sense you glaring down my back. I feel the hairs are standing on my neck.
I'm not afraid of you, is that all you've got?

I've, been through it all.
You've taken my father and brother and left my whole family alone.
Stronger we grow.
Closer together yet so far apart.

Standing face to face with darkness.
I can see it in your eyes.
And as much as you hate to admit it.
I will live another night.

If it weren't for the mistakes I've made along the way.
I wouldn't be where I am today.
I look to the decisions set in place.
To shape the character of the future me.
While others put theirs hopes on a shelf,
and let their lives be controlled by someone else.
I stand tall.
And I believe in myself.

You know me well enough by now.
(I believe in myself)
Look at what yo've started, over my dead body,
will I ever let you haunt me again.

I know that I am far from perfect.
But this pain should prove I'm worth it.
With all these choices, what brought you here to me?
I've learned so much, and I have lived to little.
What makes you think that you will take this from me.

I never used to dream like this.
Sifting through the sand.
Searching for something worth keeping.
Something to believe in.
I never lie awake at night.
Staring at the ceiling.
For the answers I'm seeking.
Is anybody listening?

I'm done waiting in line for my life to fall in place.
Afraid to close my eyes.
So death will have no chance to show his face.
He'll have no chance to show his face.
I'll be the one to dig my grave.
But only when I'm ready.
I'll be the one to dig my grave.

So come at me now.
With everything that you've got.
I'll be waiting here.
With one arm behind my back.
