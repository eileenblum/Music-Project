This is a war of art.

How many times you've said,
"Do you remember when?"
Reliving memories to justify the choices you have made.

Seeking accomplishments, but I am not one of many hopes.
You live in a memory, your memory is but a ghost.
You can't keep learning, you can't be living.

You have no concern for your future or what you're meant to be.
How can we kill time without injuring eternity?

All it takes is one wasteful goodbye.
After that one you'll be wasting your time.
Why don't you stand up? Don't throw it away.
With your hands up you'll waste your life.

So tell me, what will be left when you've drained the light from every soul?
Content to walk inside the shadows of your dreams.

And I don't want to leave any moment uncaptured.
Any newborn discovery is welcome.
And I'm no longer chasing a dead dream, it's taken a part of me.

This is the moment you've been waiting for.

All it takes is one, wasteful goodbye.
After that one you'll be wasting your time.
Why don't you stand up? Don't throw it away.
With your hands up you'll waste your life.

Where is the passion? I used to see it in your eyes.
Your inspirations are setting with the sun.
There is no guide to tell you how to live your life.
But one thing is clear : You're only living to survive.
I'm waking up.

When it's all said and done, and they're digging your grave.
Looking back upon your life, what will they be able to say?
