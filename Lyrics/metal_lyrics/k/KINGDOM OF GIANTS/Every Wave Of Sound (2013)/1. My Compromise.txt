Every wave of sound
Has been pointing me in the right direction
It's telling me to move on from this protection

I'm trading my life for this I'm giving everything

I never thought it would all come down to this
But I never said I would settle for any less
My compromise is the only thing left
From this life that they have put on a pedestal

They came from the rooftops
The evil ones and their tainted endeavors
Where is my muse?
My point of view is gone because of you

Before I go, I'll leave a trail to follow
A path to show you the way
For all I know, this life I lead is hollow
Can someone show me the way, home?

My life, my pride
Is on the line this time
And I know why
I'll put the past behind
We have been ignored, we have been betrayed

I found my cathexis
Filling empty spaces I always knew were there
Rewriting my maps and chart a new course
For open water

Before I go, I'll leave a trail to follow
A path to show you the way
For all I know, this life I lead is hollow
Can someone show me the way, home?

Every wave of sound
Every wave of...
