We lay under the starlight
Trying to find a way home
We live, we strive
To make our way through
This life between us and our hearts

And I won't be surprised
When looking to the sky
If you ever came back for me
I will be here waiting
And if it isn't true
And if these feelings grew
I will be here waiting
Whatever the future brings
