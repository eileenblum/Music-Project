[feat. Stephen Rezza]Too long, too long, too long we've been waiting on.
Too long we've been waiting on the sun to fall so we can live it up.
Too long we've been waiting on the sun to fall so we can live it up.

These are more than good intentions, I've given everything I have,
This is more than a positive message, you'll never catch me looking back.
Now walk that narrow path and never go astray, your's has gotten you nowhere,
But look where mine has taken me.

There's way too many of us, struggling through everyday,
This is a home where troubles are withered away,
This is my one chance, I live it day by day,
There's nothing stopping us now, there's not a thing in our way.

What, can I say, where can I go.
This, road, feels like home. Oh.

Too long we've been waiting on the sun to fall so we can live it up,
Too long we've been waiting on the sun to fall so we can live it up.

While you're dreaming, I'll be living,
While you wait for what you think you deserve,
I will appreciate every move my body gives me to make,
Until the day I lay still.

I have seen the world but you have only heard my screams,
I have shared my words and you have looked into my dreams.
I know you fear the worst, and I know that you have a choice,
All I ask is one thing, put your trust in my voice.

And I know you fear the worst,
And I know that you have a choice,
So put your trust in my voice.

Too long we've been waiting on the sun to fall so we can live it up.

Too long, too long, too long we've been waiting on.

Too Long we've been waiting on the sun to fall so we can live it up.
