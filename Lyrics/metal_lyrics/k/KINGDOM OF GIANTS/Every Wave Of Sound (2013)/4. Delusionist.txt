Every second I waste, every moment away
I've taken ever breath I think I can take
I'm done with all the games
You claim that you can change but it's over
It's over

Take back everything you ever gave to me
Absolve your surroundings

I've never met someone so distracting
With all your talk you'll never do a damn thing.

Walking away, finally I can keep all of my feelings at bay
I can get this off of my chest
Your hearts filled with secrets and regrets
You never wanted more than a puppet and with my hands tied
You throw your blindfolds aside to the wind
I don't want to hear your words again
Speaking silently through the voices in my head

And now inside I'm feeling alive cause` it's over
It's over

These sidewalks have tested my endurance
And left my conscious mind in a state that I cant escape from

Fuck you and your negativity
Keep your shallow visions lacking empathy
Fuck you and your narrow minded ways
Always judging us before you know our name

Walking away, finally I can keep all of my feelings at bay
I can get this off of my chest
Your heart's filled with secrets and regrets
You never wanted more than a puppet and with my hands tied
You throw your blindfolds aside to the wind
I don't want to hear your words again
Speaking silently through the voices in my head

Walking away works for the best
Finally I can get this off of my chest
This has been building up in me
This has been building up
Walking away
