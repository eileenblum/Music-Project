You can see them for miles
You can count them for days
Overlooking the ground where the dead soldiers lay

There is a lesson to be learned from this
The gathering clouds of war can be extinguished

How far are you willing to take this
How far are you willing to go
Are you ready to go

Whether we win or lose
We've lost too much to compare the two
Whose side are you, whose side are you on?
Don't let the small smudges blur out the big picture
You fucking be the one to tell their mothers
Their sons are never coming home

You try to wash the blood off your hands
But the oil's too thick it won't come clean
It seems you've tried everything
From black water to gasoline

We are staring down the mother of all messes
This is so ridiculous
Do you have any idea what our children have in store?
They will be fighting our wars
Paying our debts
They will suffer the outcome of our own regrets
And it's a sad fact to face to know
That this is the truth

Their words stagger like a drunken man
Manipulative like the bottle in his hand
Is the the world I see in front of me
A world before
Is this the world I see in front of me
A world of war

This is a game of chess and we are all the pawns
It's just a pattern they expect us to follow
It's just a pill they give that's too big to swallow

You try to wash the blood off your hands
But the oil's too thick it won't come clean
It seems you've tried everything
From black water to gasoline

So tell their mothers their sons are never coming home
You fucking be the one to bring that news back home

Self righteous you stand on your hill at the top
It's a beautiful view but how much did it cost
You can see them for miles
You can count them for days
Over looking the ground where the dead soldiers lay
Some young and some old, a family a friend
These are women these are children
What will it take for an end.
