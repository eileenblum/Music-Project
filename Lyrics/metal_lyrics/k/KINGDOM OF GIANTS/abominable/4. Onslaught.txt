So they cheer for the kill.
We stand in awe,
We bow at the sight of those that want our blood.

Scream slaves versus kings,
They sing,
Let the steel ring.

The crowd cheers for bloodshed, but they won't take me
Hephaestus hear their screams,
We have no place to flee
We fight side by side like brothers in arms.
No mercy from our captors,
We'll stand victorious.

Let's end their lives.
We are the heartless warriors fighting to live another day
But most of us will be taken by the blade.

And I won't be the sun to glaze over your shoulders,
You're so helpless.
[x3]

I won't be the beholder
Everything we know
Amazing you are so helpless
The lessons we made are to never retain your own fears.
It's life after life, pride over pride we've seen.

Life after life,
Pride over pride.
Life after life,
Pride over pride.

I won't be the sun to glaze over your shoulders,
You're so helpless.
And I won't be the sun to glaze over your shoulders,
You are so helpless.

The blood paints the sand red, but none belongs to me.
Heads taken from their shoulders, torsos fall to their knees.
We fight side by side like brothers in arms.
No mercy from our captors,
We'll stand victorious.

We are the heartless warriors fighting to live another day
But most of us will be taken by the blade.

I taste your fear.
In my arms you'll die.
By my hands you will suffer.
Let the chilling hands of death take hold.
