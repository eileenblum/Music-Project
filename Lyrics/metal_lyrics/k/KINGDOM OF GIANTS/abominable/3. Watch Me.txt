Finding out the truth behind those blue eyes was the hardest thing I ever had to do.

I'm writing out the truthful things I never said to you.

I tried so hard to change your mind.
There's no remorse in your eyes.
I'm finding out the truth of why my dreams are falling through, through.

All I could have told you would have saved my eyes from being blinded by fury and tears.

Now take a breath,
You've tried so hard,
And you're giving me all that you've got,
Now take a stand for everything, for everything.
I'll suffocate.
I won't regret the memories, the memories.

I'm writing out the truthful things I never said to you.
I tried so hard to change your mind.
There's no remorse in your eyes.
I'm finding out the truth of why my dreams are falling through, through.

Just watch me,
I can't escape.
Just watch me,
I can't escape.
Well then you walked through the open door without even listening to me.
Tongues tied with words that I abhor,
Everything you fucking said to me.
Just watch me,
I can't escape.
Just watch me,
I can't escape.
Just watch me,
I can't escape.

No more promises,
No more giving into you,
You won't hurt me again.

Now take a breath,
You've tried so hard,
And you're giving me all that you've got.
Now take a stand for everything,
For everything,
For everything.
