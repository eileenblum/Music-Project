This is a notion empowered by an individual motivation.
I've given most of my efforts to have not just a single person to rely on.

This obelisk of discouraging actions was all washed out by a tidal wave of art and soul,
And this will never make a coward of me,
I'll ride this wave up to the top.

The day I needed you summoned before me,
Became the day,
I was left all alone,

A test of my survival,
A test of my strength,
A test of my survival,
Everyone is distant!

The day I needed you, I watched you turn your back away from me,
And I'm all alone.
I never needed you anyway.
Cried out to you.
We are alone, we are alone.

I wouldn't trust you just as far as I could throw you.
I wouldn't ask for a single fucking thing from you.
I wouldn't trust you even if I've always known you.
I wouldn't ask for a single thing.

The day I needed the numbers beside me became the day that I was left all alone.
You never notice that people, they leave you, but you can do this on your own.

The day I needed you, I watched you turn your back away from me,
And I'm all alone.
Cried out to you, cried out to you.
We are alone, we are alone.
