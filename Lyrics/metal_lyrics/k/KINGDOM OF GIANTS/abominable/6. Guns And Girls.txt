This source of pain is all that's left of you.
This misery is all because of you.
End this life
Not that you would care.
Take these dreams
Watch your fucking step.
I won't be walked upon,
Watch your step and I'll watch mine
'Til the day we take our own paths.

Held down by these things you've created,
They pierce the flesh and poison the mind.
Poison the mind!

Pray now for the life that you think that you deserve.
There is more to life than living with regret.
Life is a gift.

You held the syndicate but gave into lies.
Forget the times I spent captured by your eyes,
I cannot believe I wasted my time.
Forget the lies, the pain is all in your mind.
I let this go.
Your turn to fucking move on.
Forget the lies, the pain is all in your mind.
Now let this go home.

And I'm still working on the fact
That this is just a symptom and I'm going through phases.
When this world fades to black like all the universe is now
I'll be calling your name.
And if your heart should judge me for the little work I've done,
Where will you go?

There is more to life than living with regret.
Life is a gift.
Life is a gift.
Even with all of these flaws, promise not to change.

I'm still working on the fact that this is just a symptom and I'm going through phases.
But when your heart should judge me for what little work I've done,
Where will you go?
You've been holding on forever and I just don't understand
Everything that I remember, I will soon enough forget
And what did you teach me?
To never miss a note, no, no, no, no,
Where did you go?
