I'm writing out the truthful things I never said to you.
I'm finding out the truth of why my dreams are falling through oooh oh
[x2]

Now take a breath,
You've tried so hard,
And you're giving me all that you've got,
Now take a stand for everything, for everything. Oooh oh oh yeah...

I'm writing out the truthful things I never said to you.
I'm finding out the truth of why my dreams are falling through oooh oh
[x2]

And just watch me, just watch me...
Then you walked through the door
Tongues tied with words that I abhor
Just watch me, I can't escape [x3]
I can't escape... yeaaaaha...

Now take a breath,
You've tried so hard,
And you're giving me all that you've got.
Now take a stand for everything,
For everything, for everything...
