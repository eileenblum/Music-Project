ALL STOP... imagine,
lash out just this one time no control
take their sight
still there but now they feel
instead of reading, talking, laughing just feeling
now we're here
pieces of us in my hands, on the floor, in my pockets
RED GLORY
my god, the smiles, the sneezes, the talking
we're in that place again
we're gone, erased, RED, feel, feel
no good times in here
RED GLORY
change you, be gone or I'll...

oh my god
erase i can
away
its gone
truth is changed
falses naught
one - two - three times
eyes close
they're gone
odd what was normal
inconsistent
raptured
my god
erase i can
truth is changed
falses naught
one - two - three times
eyes close
the hunt
the change
that's what i love
follow stare remove
truth is changed
falses naught
one - two - three times
eyes close
follow
stare
wipe out
only red - make red
RED GLORY
timeline finish
done
erase i can
truth IS change
the falses stay
away, away, we're gone

one - two - three blinks
gone
not gone
red
the hunt
the follow
that's i love
follow
stare
erase
gone
truth is changed
falses naught
RED GLORY

ALL STOP... imagine,
lash out just this one time
