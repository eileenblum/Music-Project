Who says I can't have?
Closer come closer
One step closer to somewhere
Almost home
Almost home
My home
My house
One step closer to nowhere
This is happening...
In my house
Mine for now sing with me
Lovely sound
Sing with me
Strapped and tied
Sing with me
Latent thing
Someone's treasure crush
Cry for now
Lovely sound
Cry eat devour
Feel me eat
Feel me eat
Sing to me
Sing to me
Together we sing
Comely thing
Together we sing
Strapped and tied
Lovely bundle
Sing to me
Pretty thing
Talking thing
Someone's treasure crush
In my house
This is my house
Mine for now
This is happening...
I can't have?
Who says I can't have?
Closer come closer
Almost home
Almost home
One step closer to nowhere
Closer come closer
Almost home
Almost home
My home
My house
Basement
