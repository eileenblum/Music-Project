I've got a bone to pick
Maybe it's yours
Someone said
If you worked hard enough
Ran fast enough
Learned enough
You would amount to something
Fail
Trying is not enough
I'll hold you way too long
It's cold when I touch you
A release
And everything you are is on the ground
Broken open and spilling
Leaves soak they drink
You are blood
That's all
Fail
Trying is not enough
I'll hold you way too long
It's cold when I'm near you
A release
And everything you are is on the ground
You are blood
That's all
Blood
Fail
Trying is not enough
I'll hold you way too long
It's cold when you're down
Release
And everything you are is on the ground
Broken, opened and spilling
Leaves soak they drink
You are blood
That's all
Fail
Trying is not enough
I dragged you too far down
It's cold when I release blood
A release
And everything you are is on the ground
Broken open and spilling
Leaves soak they drink
Blood
Fail
Trying is not enough
I held you way too long
It's cold when I'm near you
A release
And everything you are is on the ground
And everything you are is broken
Opened and spoiled the body
Fail
Trying is not enough
And there I am above you
I won't let go
It's cold when you are down
It's cold when I touch you
And there I am above you
Opened and spoiled
You were blood nothing more
Leaves were soaked
You were blood that's all
Opened and spoiled the body
You are blood nothing more
It's cold when I release blood
It's cold when you're down
I'll hold you way too long
I won't let go
It's cold when birds fall from the sky
It's cold when I'm near you
Fail
Trying is not enough
