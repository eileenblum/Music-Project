It went down bad
And it's a sad life
When angels break
So easily
I was bad
And it's a sad life
When clean hands go foul
Help me for the way I am
Before it wanes
Forgive me
Broken angel
Broken angel
Would an angel forgive?
Would I let her?
I was bad
And it's a sad life
When clean hands go foul
Angels are easily broken
And I broke one

I broke one because I could
Broken angel
Broken angel
