Every God Damn Thing
Am I dying?
I hope it's soon
These people
Screaming with their walking and talking
They're making me die
They're making me die
Hell
This time it's real bad
This hell
This dying
I want this dying
Screaming, these people talking
I need dying
Make it soon
They
On fire screaming
Living
It's all bad
Get out - my head
It's all bad my head my hell
You're all hell

Hell
Hell is every god damned thing
Everything poison
The sky
The dirt
People
Hell
Herds of people
Insects
Grin dog faced
Walking streets
Awake
In my hell

Hell
Hell is every god damned thing
Roaches, stepped on
You're all hell
Stained on my boot
Who's laughing?
No one
If they're on fire
You're on fire
In my head
In my hell
Who's laughing?
No one
If they're on fire
You're on fire
In my head
In my hell

Hell
Hell is every god damned thing
Children deform
You can hear them
Hopefully in pain
Screaming love songs
In my head
In hell

God damn awake one more time
The daily death blow
Birds sing promise of a day pathetic
I'll break your wings and you'll stop singing
Like breaks window
Brings hope
Absurd
It's all bad
It's all bad again
It's all bad
It's all bad again

Out there someone's dying
Hopefully
It should be all of them
I'd step on them if I could

If I could
Maybe it's me
Maybe I'm dying
I'm the one
On fire
It's all bad
It's all bad again

Am I dying?
I hope it's soon
These people
Screaming with their walking and talking
They're making me die
They're making me die
Hell
This time it's real bad
This hell
This dying
I want this dying
Screaming these people talking
I need dying
Make it soon
They
On fire screaming
Living
It's all bad
Get out - my head
It's all bad my head my hell
You're all hell

Hell
Hell is every god damned thing
Everything poison
Even flowers disgust
The sky
The dirt
People
Hell
Herds of people
Walking streets
Awake in my head in hell
It's all bad
It's all bad
It's all bad again
Again
It's all bad again
It's all bad
Get out - my head
