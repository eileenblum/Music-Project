I made this corner for you to stand in
Prison I wrought
To speak brings torture
Words are war
Hit
A voice means you get cut
Don't you talk
Don't you move
Corner
Don't move
Stay in that corner

I made this box for you to soak in
Slump over folded
Shiver
Don't unfold
How dare you tremble?
Box trembles
Kick when I want
Stay folded
Stay in that box
Don't dare shiver
Don't you move
In that box

I dug this trench for you to drain in
A cheerless day
War
Don't hold on
How dare you hold on?
Dispute the blurry
Arms legs flail
Yield
Slow river flow
Don't you move
A kick will fix it
Stay in that trench
In that box
In the corner
