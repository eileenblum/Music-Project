Silent tear, pinned, screamless . Like a dead pile, time, seamless
Silent tear . Human shield
Say it, say - you'll give me your skin...skin...skin
Fold back, crawl inside, your pinned
Like...wet...pile... Peel...now...feel
I wear, a human shield . Through the elements, stay warm
I put you on, crawl inside . Human shield, skin fold back, crawl inside
