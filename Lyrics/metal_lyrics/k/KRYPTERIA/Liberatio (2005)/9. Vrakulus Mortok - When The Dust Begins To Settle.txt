All alone at night no chance

To rest your weary head
Cause i am the creator of all pain and sorrow
I'm out to get your soul and once
You see me all hope is dead
For all your dreams there's no tomorrow

Try to escape my eyes,you run
But you cannot hide
On your knees,go lick up the slime.
Your master has arrived

When the dust begins to settle
And the victory is mine
All your bones and teeth will rattle
Till the end of time
I will bring eternal darkness
Fear forever and a day
When the dust begins to settle you'll obey
Or else you'll be swept away

You better don't turn around
I'm right behind your back
You're never gonna get a chance
To make it out of here alive
I'm really looking forward
To sink my teeth into your neck
There ain't no power on earth to break me

Try to escape my eyes,you run
But you cannot hide
On your knees,go lick up the slime.
Your master has arrived
