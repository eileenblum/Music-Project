Memories of how we got startedAnd the joy of having you by my sideRemind me of the day you left my lifeLoneliness has been my companionAnd all hope has slowly faded awayI find it hard to stand those empty days I have to face that without youAll the love is goneWill i find you Tonight.Only tonightMemories of mine flying through timeTonight.Only tonightIf i could turn back time i would tonight Memories of how it all endedAnd the pain i feel 'cause you're not aroundRemind me of the tendernessAnd love we had foundPart of you will always be with meStill there's lneliness that i have to standIf only i could drown in your eyes again I have to face that without youAll the love is goneWill i find you Tonight.Only tonightMemories of mine flying through timeTonight.Only tonightIf i could turn back time i would tonight
