You think you finally made it 
That you escaped eternal fire 
And you're about to save your 
Oh-so-precious life 
But you will die 

Soon your lifeless body will 
Be dragged through mud and slime 
I'll eat your worthless little soul 
At the gates of hell tonight 
And you will die, you will die, you will die, 
Burn in hell forever 

Better get the hell out of my way 
Better say your prayer cause darkness is coming 
You will not see another day 
Get the hell out of my way 
Better say your prayer cause darkness is coming 
My Bloodstained reign is here to stay 
I'm coming for the prey 

I guarantee cold shivers will be 
running down your spine 
Don't turn around cause I'm closing in from behind 
And you will die 

How do you dare and try to fool the evil king 
Your time has come your chances are running precariously thin 
And I will win, I will win, you will die 
Burn in hell forever 

Better get the hell out of my way 
Better say your prayer cause darkness is coming 
You will not see another day 
Get the hell out of my way 
Better say your prayer cause darkness is coming 
My Bloodstained reign is here to stay 
I'm coming for the prey 

Pugnacitas captivitas dominatio 
Miseria tristitia desperatio 

Better get the hell out of my way 
Better say your prayer cause darkness is coming 
You will not see another day 
Get the hell out of my way 
Better say your prayer cause darkness is coming 
My Bloodstained reign is here to stay 
I'm coming for the prey
