You feel it's time to surrender,
Feel like a victim of circumstance,
You made a promise, don't you remember?
It's time that you understand you are the only one
To turn the key to destiny.

Remember, you need to stay true to your heart
And don't forget who you are.
For then she eventually be back in your heart,
A brand new start.

Trust your heart and make up your mind,
It's time to lay it on the line
And search for answers deep inside.
Trust your heart and make up your mind,
You know that time flies, got to cast your fears aside.

You said come hell or high water,
When things get rough, she could count on you.
Hmm, can't you see you're about to hurt her?
It's time that you understand you are the only one
To turn the key to destiny.

Remember, you need to stay true to your heart
And don't forget who you are.
For then she eventually be back in your heart,
A brand new start.

Trust your heart and make up your mind,
It's time to lay it on the line
And search for answers deep inside.
Trust your heart and make up your mind,
You know that time flies, got to cast your fears aside.

Remember, you need to stay true to your heart
And don't forget who you are.
'Cause then she eventually be back in your arms,
A brand new start.

Trust your heart and make up your mind,
It's time to lay it on the line
And search for answers deep inside.
Trust your heart and make up your mind,
(Make up your mind),
You know that time flies, got to cast your fears aside.
