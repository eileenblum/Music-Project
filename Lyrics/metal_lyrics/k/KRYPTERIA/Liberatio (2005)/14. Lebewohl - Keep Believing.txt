Dark is the light day turns to nightThe end seems to start feel emptiness fill my heartHarvest of stone flames burning lowWinter arrives the end by my side But there's hope you should knowLove won't go Keep believing someday we'll meet againI know our story just won't end this wayKeep believing and try to understandAlthough I go some things will never changeI'll be there by your side night and day come what may Stars fade away leaves turn to greyThe end seems to start feel emptiness fill my heartOut in the cold darkness unfoldsWinter arrives the end by my side But there's hope you should know Love won't go Keep believing someday we'll meet againI know our story just won't end this wayKeep believing and try to understandAlthough I go some things will never changeI'll be there by your side night and day come what may
