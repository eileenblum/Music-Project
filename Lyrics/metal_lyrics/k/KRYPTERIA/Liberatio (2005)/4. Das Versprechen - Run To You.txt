There's a raging fire that is burning in my heart 
Lift your spirits higher cause we're closer than you think we are 

I'll climb the highest mountain 
I will fly to distant stars for you and 
I will swim the deepest sea 
To save your lonely heart 
I'll do I'll do 

And I will run to you, come to you 
Rescue your soul from bleeding 
Together we'll step into the light 
And I will run to you, come to you 
Promise to keep believing 
I will be there by your side 
By Your Side 

Nothing's gonna stop me now 
I'll make it come what may 
My neverending love for you 
Will guide me all along the way 

I'll climb the highest mountain 
I will fly to distant stars for you and 
I will swim the deepest sea 
To save your lonely heart 
I'll do I'll do 

And I will run to you, come to you 
Rescue your soul from bleeding 
Together we'll step into the light 
And I will run to you, come to you 
Promise to keep believing 
I will be there by your side 
By Your Side, by Your Side 

And I will run to you, come to you 
Rescue your soul from bleeding 
Together we'll step into the light 
And I will run to you, come to you 
Promise to keep believing 
I will be there by your side
