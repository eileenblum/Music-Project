So here we stand your face is beaming
I take your hand feels like I am dreaming

I will shelter your heart till death do us part
I promise I'll do
At the end of the day only one thing remains
I love you

I just drowned in your eyes and I've found a new life
You're in my heart for eternity
I just drowned in your eyes
A love that's larger than life
They just can't take this away from me

Just you and me hear my heart beating
You turned the key made me believe in love

I will shelter your heart till death do us part
I promise I'll do
At the end of the day only one thing remains
I love you

I just drowned in your eyes and I found a new life
You're in my heart for eternity
I just drowned in your eyes
a love that's larger than life
They just cant take this away from me
