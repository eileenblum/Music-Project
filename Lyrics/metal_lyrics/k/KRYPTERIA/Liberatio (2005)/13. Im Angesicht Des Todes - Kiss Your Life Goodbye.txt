So it's you again, fool,
You're a stupid little thing
Who really picked a bad bad day
To irritate the king
You challenged my existence
Much to my chagrin
I pity you 'cause your future's
Looking extraordinarily grim

So you climbed the highest mountain even
Tried to catch the stars?
Well I'm quite impressed but that don't mean
I won't rip out your heart
I will never fall to noone,
You don't seem to understand
Let alone to such a sorry little man

Boy you better kiss your life goodbye
In a minute you will face eternal fire
You best believe it, I really mean it
In hell you're gonna fry - bye bye
Boy you better kiss your life goodbye
Don't you see that your rebellious ass is mine
You best believe it, I really mean it
Kiss your life goodbye

Take your final breath now,
Say farewell and be my guest
And witness how my bloodstained sword
Will open up your chest
Get ready for release,
Yes you will sense a touch of steel
But I seriously doubt you will
Appreciate the feel

So you climbed the highest mountain even
Tried to catch the stars?
Well I'm quite impressed but that don't mean
I won't rip out your heart
I will never fall to noone,
You don't seem to understand
Let alone to such a sorry little man

Boy you better kiss your life goodbye
In a minute you will face eternal fire
You best believe it, I really mean it
In hell you're gonna fry - bye bye
Boy you better kiss your life goodbye
Don't you see that your rebellious ass is mine
You best believe it, I really mean it
Kiss your life goodbye

I've had enough of all this noble stuff
So someone soon will lose his head
Spread my hate at the fateful gate
Then I'll drown your mates in a sea of red

Boy you better kiss your life goodbye
In a minute you will face eternal fire
You best believe it, I really mean it
In hell you're gonny fry
You'll die, you'll die, you'll die, say goodbye

Boy you better kiss your life goodbye
In a minute you will face eternal fire
You best believe it, I really mean it
In hell you're gonna fry - bye bye
Boy you better kiss your life goodbye
Don't you see that your rebellious ass is mine
You best believe it, I really mean it
Kiss your life goodbye
