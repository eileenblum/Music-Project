There is one thing you should know, the way you need to go It's dangerous indeed, your destiny you'll meet The prize youu will receive is the answers to your needs You are the one to break the seal  I can't turn back the hands of time But hear me out, seek and ye shall find  Try, try and maybe you will find find another place in time Time to resurrect your mind, just try Try, try and maybe you will see, see a different reality Be the best that you can be, you can be, just try and see  There is one more liefe to save, a heart still firm, still brave It's worth it, carry on and save the precious bond The prize you will receive is the answer to your needs You are the one to break the seal  I can't turn back the hands of time But hear me out, seek and ye shall find  Try, try and maybe you will find find another place in time Time to resurrect your mind, just try Try, try and maybe you will see, see a different reality Be the best that you can be, you can be, just try and see
