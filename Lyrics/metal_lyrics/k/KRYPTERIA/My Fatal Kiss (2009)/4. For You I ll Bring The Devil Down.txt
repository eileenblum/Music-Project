Out of words, searching for better lines to express what's going on inside
All of the good ones must have been used a billion times
Words come hard, I don't know how to start
What I have, really, don't seem too smart
But I just hope you still like it, it's straight from my heart

For you I'll bring the devil down / corona tenebrarum
For you I'll set him up and steal his crown / corona tenebrarum
I'll go to hell and back for you
For you I'll bring the devil down
For you I'll take him on and shut him down
I'll go to hell and back, I'll do
For you I'll bring the devil down

Yes, I know it's quite a thing to say and it just might be some lame clichÃ©
What can I do, it's you who makes me feel this way
By the way, speaking of overused, here's a line that I think has long been due:
Baby, I love you and I'd do anything for you

For you I'll bring the devil down / corona tenebrarum
For you I'll set him up and steal his crown / corona tenebrarum
I'll go to hell and back for you
For you I'll bring the devil down
For you I'll take him on and shut him down
I'll go to hell and back, I'll do
For you I'll bring the devil down

If you talk the talk you've got to walk the walk
I won't back down from what I say
Because of you I feel this way

For you I'll bring the devil down / corona tenebrarum, corona tenebrarum
I'll go to hell and back for you
For you I'll bring the devil down
For you I'll take him on and shut him down
I'll go to hell and back, I'll do
For you I'll bring the devil down
