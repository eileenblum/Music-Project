How well I remember all those moments when we touched
But memories are all I have left
HE took you away from, took you away from me

I'm dying to love, I'm dying to live again
Dying to love, to follow you
Dying to love, my life I shall give
I am dying to love, to finally live again

Time moves on without me
As I yearn for this to end
How long must I bleed in this life
When there's nothing to bleed for, nothing to feel anymore

I'm dying to love, I'm dying to live again
Dying to love, to follow you
Dying to love, my life I shall give
I am dying to love, to finally live again

I'm dying to love, I'm dying to live again
Dying to love, to follow you
Dying to love, my life I shall give
I am dying to love
In death I will live again, live again, see you again, again
