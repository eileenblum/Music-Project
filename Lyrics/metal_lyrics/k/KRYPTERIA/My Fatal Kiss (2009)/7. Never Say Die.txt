How dare you tell me how to feel and what to do
When it's so obvious that all you care about is you, yourself and you
How come that though you said you'd always have my back
You're sitting pretty while the noose gets tighter around my neck

I'm going on without you
I'm moving on without you now
I'm gonna find a way to bring this monster down

Never say die, never say die and don't back down
Nothing's gonna faze you, you're gonna breakthrough in the end somehow
Never say die, never say die and don't back down
No one's gonna break me, I'm gonna make it in the end somehow
Never say die

How dare you ask me to submit to your command
When all you do is serve yourself and screw me over time and time again
Too bad I've heard this one too many times before
No, I ain't gonna let your demons drag me down no more

I'm going on without you
I'm moving on without you now
I'm gonna find a way to bring this monster down

Never say die, never say die and don't back down
Nothing's gonna faze you, you're gonna breakthrough in the end somehow
Never say die, never say die and don't back down
No one's gonna break me, I'm gonna make it in the end somehow

Where am I? What have I done?
Where am I? Is my salvation ever gonna come?
Where am I? What in the world have I done?
Now I'm staring down the barrel of a gun

Never say die, never say die and don't back down
I'm gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it in the end somehow
Never say die, never say die and don't back down
No one's gonna break me, I'm gonna make it in the end somehow
Never say die
