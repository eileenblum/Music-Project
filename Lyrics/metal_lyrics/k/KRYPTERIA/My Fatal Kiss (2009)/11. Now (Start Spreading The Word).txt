So the world is calling you a fool
Hear them laugh as they prophesy your doom
Now, before they bury you alive, fight their lies and reignite
Go scream the truth right in their face: No, it ain't over

Now start spreading the word
Now make sure the whole world will hear you
Now just prove the absurd
Now and don't let nobody stop you now

So the world has labelled you a fraud
Here they come, they'd even pay to see you fall
Now, before they have you stigmatized, ridiculed and petrified
Go slam the truth right in their face: It ain't over

Now start spreading the word
Now make sure the whole world will hear you
Now just prove the absurd
Now and don't let nobody stop you

Now start spreading the word
Now make sure the whole world will hear you
Now just prove the absurd
Now and don't let nobody stop you
It ain't over, it ain't over, it ain't over
Now!
