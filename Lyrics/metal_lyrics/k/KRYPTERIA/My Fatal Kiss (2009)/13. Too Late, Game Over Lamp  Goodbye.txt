I apologize for the end of our paradise
I figured it was time to clench my mind and turn things over
Maybe it's cause I'm too much of the difficult kind
Or maybe all we shared just up and died

Who cares / Cause now it is too late, game over and goodbye
No matter what you say or do it's over
It's sad but you won't see me cry
There's no more me and you
I'm oh so over you

I was in denial that our game plan went awry
But then I had to finally realize this "we"-thing's over
I don't know why you killed us from inside
You made your choice, I made us sever ties

Who gives a shit / It is too late, game over and goodbye
No matter what you say or do it's over
It's sad but you won't see me cry
There's no more me and you
I'm oh so over you

Too late, game over and goodbye
No matter what you say or do it's over
It's sad but you won't see me cry
There's no more me and you
I'm on to something new
Too late, game over and goodbye
No matter what you say or do it's over
It's sad but you won't see me cry
There's no more me and you
I'm oh so over you
