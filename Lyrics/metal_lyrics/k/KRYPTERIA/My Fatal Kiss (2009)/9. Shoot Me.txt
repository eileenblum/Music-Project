Tell me do you remember all the pain you put me through?
You forgot? I did not, I never will
I really hate you right now, I really do
I'm gonna make you pay now
There's only one way out of this left for you:

Shoot me, better shoot me now
Shoot before I knock you out
Yes, I'm gonna knock you out
Shoot me, better shoot me now
Shoot or else you're going down

You'll pay the price for every single thing you did to me
You can run, you can hide, I'll chase you down
Crying won't help you, no one will rescue you
It's time for you to pay now
There's only one way out of this left for you:

Shoot me, better shoot me now
Shoot before I knock you out
Yes, I'm gonna knock you out
Shoot me, better shoot me now
Shoot or else you're going down

So now you say you're sorry about the things you did to me
It's too late, way too late, you're going down

Shoot me (shoot me), better shoot me now
Shoot before I knock you out
Yes, I'm gonna knock you out
Shoot me, better shoot me now
Shoot or else you're going down
