There's nothing wrong here
Just trust us, we'll soon show a movie and serve another drink to you
Isn't this comfy?
Well, yes, we're being led by the blind but at least we'll go down amused

Ignition, but who sent me out on this mission?
I can't believe I applied / infirmatur quis in vobis
Ignition to my personal demolition
And no one to stop this ride / tristatur aliquis vestrum
Oh, why?

Don't worry, we have a plan
We just brought in a monkey to save us from crashing down
Mmh, ain't we the smartest, most brilliant and... oh, by the way:
It's officially time to panic now!

Ignition, but who sent me out on this mission?
I can't believe I applied / infirmatur quis in vobis
Ignition to my personal demolition
And no one to stop this ride / tristatur aliquis vestrum
Why, why, why?

Et oratio fidei salvabit infirmum et adlevabit eum Dominus
Why, why, why?

Ignition, but who sent me out on this mission?
I can't believe I applied / infirmatur quis in vobis
Ignition to my personal demolition
And no one to stop this ride / tristatur aliquis vestrum
Why?
