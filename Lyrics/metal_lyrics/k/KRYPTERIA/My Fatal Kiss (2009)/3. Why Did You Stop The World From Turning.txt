Am I done and dying, has my destiny caught up with me?
There is no denying I am lost in this, the life of me
Seems like you've been lying through your promises, your guarantees
Anybody crying over everything it could have been?
I hear the words but I think I'll never understand why it hurts
Won't you tell me, tell me

Why did you stop the world from turning?
The final curtain is going down in flames
Why, why did you have to go and end it
And leave me stranded one million light years away?
Why, why did you stop the world from turning?
I'm still hurting, my inner soul's been slain
Why, I just cannot understand it
I am stranded one million light years away

You got the best of me, now go ahead and take the rest that's left of me
I just lie here waiting for hell to break loose on me
Tell me why must love end in tragedy eventually?
Could it be that it's just part of one sick, your sick strategy?
It's only words yet I think I'll never understand why it hurts
Won't you tell me, tell me

Why did you stop the world from turning?
The final curtain is going down in flames
Why, why did you have to go and end it
And leave me stranded one million light years away?
Why, why did you stop the world from turning?
I'm still hurting, my inner soul's been slain
Why, I just cannot understand it
I am stranded one million light years away
One million light years away

Why, why?
Why did you stop the world from turning?
The final curtain is going down in flames
Why, why did you have to go and end it
And leave me stranded one million light years away?
Why, why did you stop the world from turning?
I'm still hurting, my inner soul's been slain
Why, I just cannot understand it
I am stranded one million light years away
One million light years away
One million light years away
