Trapped in total darkness
No dawning evermore
A mile below the ground, that's me
I cut myself to see if there's something left in here
Like a bullet to a gun,

God, I need someone, just anyone, to save me from what I've become
God I need someone, just anyone, to stop me from pulling the trigger on this gun
God I need someone

A thousand shattered pieces
No motion anymore
A mutilated doll, that's me
I cut myself to see if there's still fight in me
Like a bullet to a gun,

God, I need someone, just anyone, to save me from what I've become
God I need someone, just anyone, to stop me from pulling the trigger on this gun
God I need someone

The night keeps growing darker and the fight is getting harder in here

God I need someone, just anyone, to save me from what I've become
God I need someone, just anyone, to stop me from pulling the trigger on this gun
God I need someone
