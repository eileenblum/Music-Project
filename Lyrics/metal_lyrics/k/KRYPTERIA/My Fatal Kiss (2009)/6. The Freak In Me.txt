I never thought I would feel this way
Something's happened and I've changed
Could it be that I only found you to lose myself?
But you'll never know, you will never know
Cause you can't see my eyes following you from a distance
Hungry for each move you make
I'm watching when you dream at night, can you feel my pain?
But you'll never know, you will never know

Cause you won't see the fight inside, the cuts and bruises
See the side I hide that's so damn ruthless
See the fight inside, so sick and useless
I won't free the freak in me
I gotta die on my own

I barely can control the way I'm feeling
You're alone, asleep, I'm here
I'm so close I can almost taste you, I feel you breathe
Got to stay away, got to stay away

So you won't see the fight inside, the cuts and bruises
See the side I hide that's so damn ruthless
See the fight inside, so sick and useless
I won't free the freak in me
I gotta die on my own

I just cannot stand it any longer
Can't control the urge so strong
The other side is finally taking over now
I can't help myself, I can't help myself

It's time you see the fight inside, the cuts and bruises
See the side I hide that's so damn ruthless
See the fight inside, so sick and useless
I won't free the freak in me
I gotta die on my own
See me, feel me, free me, bleed me
Now I'll free the freak!
