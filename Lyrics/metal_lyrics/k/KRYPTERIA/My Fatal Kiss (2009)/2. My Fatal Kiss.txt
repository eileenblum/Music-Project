Before the two of us will take this any further
You've got to tell me if you're ready for a sacrifice, a little death, a little kill, a little murder
And if you do it good I promise I'll be extra nice
Can you handle this?

My fatal kiss, so sweet it is
A taste you'll never want to miss
My fatal kiss, so sweet it is
Here it is, my fatal kiss

The time is right for a little death, for another kill, another murder
Say are you willing, are you able to meet my demands
Are you ready to take me a little further
Or do I have to take matters into my own hands?
Can you handle this?

My fatal kiss, so sweet it is
A taste you'll never want to miss
My fatal kiss, so sweet it is
Here it is, my fatal kiss

Can you handle this, can you handle this...?

My fatal kiss, so sweet it is
A taste you'll never want to miss
My fatal kiss, so sweet it is
Here it is, my fatal kiss, so sweet it is
A taste you'll never want to miss
My fatal kiss, so sweet it is
Here it is, my fatal kiss
