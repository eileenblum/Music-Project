I have to reinvent myself now
I could use some help
Where's everybody else gone?
I need a new "me" to arise, feed my shell to the fire
A reputation built on lies
I don't want to sell myself
Leave that to someone else

Headfirst into a sea of flames to burn the sins of yesterday
The time has come to change and dive into a sea of flames
Headfirst into the jaws of death to get myself out of this mess
For me to rise again it's straight into a sea of flames

I never thought I'd come to this point
The edge of everything there is, at least to myself
It's time for me to take this step
To resurrect and reignite the me that I once used to be
I don't want to sell myself
Leave that to someone else

Headfirst into a sea of flames to burn the sins of yesterday
The time has come to change and dive into a sea of flames
Headfirst into the jaws of death to get myself out of this mess
For me to rise again it's straight into a sea of flames

FIRE!

I don't want to sell myself
Leave that to someone else

Headfirst into a sea of flames to burn the sins of yesterday
The time has come to change and dive into a sea of flames
Headfirst into the jaws of death to get myself out of this mess
For me to rise again it's straight into a sea of flames
