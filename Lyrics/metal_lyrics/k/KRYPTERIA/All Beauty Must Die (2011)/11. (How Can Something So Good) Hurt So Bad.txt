Here we stand, our time is up and the world just seemed to stop
The end is knocking on the door now
Tell me why love had to die and tell me, why did you decide
To leave me shattered on the floor?

How can something so good hurt so bad?
How can a smile make your soul feel so sad?
How come my heart's crying tears of red?
How can the best thing in life you ever had hurt so bad?

Heart's been broken, heart's been lost since you nailed it to the cross
And cut it open with a dagger
I don't want it, it's all hurt and without you it don't work
Just leave me shattered on the floor

How can something so good hurt so bad?
How can a smile make your soul feel so sad?
How come my heart's crying tears of red?
How can the best thing in life you ever had hurt so bad?

If this is it, our last goodbye and our final serenade
Wish me well on my way to hell

How can something so good hurt so bad?
How can a smile make your soul feel so sad?
How come my heart's crying tears of red?
How can the best thing in life you ever had...?
How come that something so good hurts so bad?
How can a smile make your soul feel so sad?
How come my heart's crying tears of red?
How can the best thing in life you ever had hurt so bad?
