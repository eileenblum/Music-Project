Come and enter my life, come and change everything from within
Come and penetrate my mind, come and resurrect what might have been

Turn the world around
Come on, bring it down and break it, turn it inside out
Turn the world around
Come on, bring it down and shake it, turn it upside down
Turn the world around
Come, bring it down, come, bring the whole place down
Turn the world around

Come and enter my mind, come, eradicate the demons in me
Come and resurrect my life, come and rescue the rest of me

Turn the world around
Come on, bring it down and break it, turn it inside out
Turn the world around
Come on, bring it down and shake it, turn it upside down
Turn the world around
Come, bring it down, come, bring the whole place down
Turn the world around

Burn the whole place down, burn it to the ground
Burn the whole place down and dive into the fire
Burn the whole place down, burn it to the ground
Burn it down, burn it down, then rearise
Burn the whole place down, burn it to the ground
Burn the whole place down to build it up again
Burn the whole place down, burn it to the ground
Burn it down now!

Turn the world around
Come on, bring it down and break it, turn it inside out
Turn the world around
Come on, bring it down and shake it, turn it upside down
Turn the world around
Come, bring it down, come, bring the whole place down
Turn the world around
