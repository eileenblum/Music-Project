Feel the moment, it's time to begin, see your path into the light
Hear the roar of the world coming in
Now rise and make this your time: Victoria!

Victoria, imperium, concordia in aeternum
Victoria et gaudium in saecula saeculorum
Victoria, imperium, concordia in aeternum
Victoria et gaudium in saecula saeculorum

Here it is, your one moment in time, make them remember your name
Tear it up, this is your time to shine
Now scream as loud as you can: Victoria!

Victoria, imperium, concordia in aeternum
Victoria et gaudium in saecula saeculorum
Victoria, imperium, concordia in aeternum
Victoria et gaudium in saecula saeculorum
