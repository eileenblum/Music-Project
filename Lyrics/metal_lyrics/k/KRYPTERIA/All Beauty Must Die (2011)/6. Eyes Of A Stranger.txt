Inducas nos in tentationem
Ne inducas nos in tentationem

What to do now, where to go now, what to try now?
I must confess I am impressed, that one's a knockout
What I feel seems so surreal, should be illegal
How 'bout me trying to be a goody good girl?
That don't bother me at all

I like his game, I'm all aflame, that's what it's all about
I should resist but I insist I get my share now
Want some of this, want some of that before it's sold out
I am free, this is me being a bad girl
I can stop it anytime

Falling into the eyes of a stranger
Running into a fistful of danger
I dive headfirst into the fire to serve the altar called desire
Falling into the eyes of a stranger
I throw myself into dark realms of danger
Like dancing blindfold on a high wire, I'm craving for this stranger's fire

What to do now, where to go, how 'bout another game?
I must confess I am obsessed, want more of the same
Need more of this, need more of that before it's over
I am trapped, I am lost, I am falling
Can't control it anymore

Now he's gone, it seems so wrong, I'm starving somehow
Guess how it feels, take it from me, it's a bad deal
I need a fix, I need it quick, I need it right now
I am free, I am being a very bad girl
And I'm coming back for more

Falling into the eyes of a stranger
Running into a fistful of danger
I dive headfirst into the fire to serve the altar called desire
Falling into the eyes of a stranger
I throw myself into dark realms of danger
Like dancing blindfold on a high wire, I'm craving for this stranger's fire
