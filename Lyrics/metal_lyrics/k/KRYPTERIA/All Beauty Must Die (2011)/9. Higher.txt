I don't care 'bout the stars, I don't care about trips to Mars
And I don't care 'bout Venus, no I don't care 'bout flying to the moon
There's better things to do between me and you, we are

Higher, right here, right now, we're higher
Much higher than the highest star in the universe
We're higher, inside the fire burns, yes it burns

I don't want you to catch a star for me, don't want to own the galaxy
And I don't want no diamonds in the sky, no I don't want you to fly me to the moon
There's better things to do between me and you, we are

Higher, right here, right now, we're higher
Much higher than the highest star in the universe
We're higher, inside the fire burns

Comets blazing, burning red, supernovas in my head
Suns erupting millionfold and the galaxies explode

Higher, right here, right now, we're higher
Much higher than the highest star in the universe
We're higher, inside the fire burns, yes it burns
