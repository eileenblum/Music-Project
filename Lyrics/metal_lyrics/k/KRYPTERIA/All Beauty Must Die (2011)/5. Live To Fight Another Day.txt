Searching for you, running round in circles all the time
I can't find you, guess I'll have to keep on running yet another mile
Endless searching, still I won't quit believing you'll be mine
I will find you, I will find you, even if it means I'm searching till the day I die

I'll live to fight another day for you
And I'm gonna find a way to you
I'll live to fight another day for you
One day I'm gonna find my way to you

I will keep on searching, keep on looking for you all my life
Till I find you, till I find you, even if it means I'm searching till the end of time

I'll live to fight another day for you
And I'm gonna find a way to you
I'll live to fight another day for you
One day I'm gonna find my way to you

I'll live to fight another day for you
And I'm gonna find a way to you
I'll live to fight another day for you
One day I'm gonna find my way to you

I'll live to fight another day
I'll live to fight another day
I'll live to fight another day
One day I'm gonna find my way to you
