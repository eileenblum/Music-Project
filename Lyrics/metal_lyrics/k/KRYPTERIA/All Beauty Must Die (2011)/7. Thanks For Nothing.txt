So you think you're smart
I recommend you check again cause you are not
I should have seen your true colors right from the start
Well, better late than never

I'll try to make this quite clear
It ain't pretty but at least I am being sincere
Ya ready? I got something to get off my chest
If only for the record

Thx 4 nth / Thx 2 u / Thx 4 nthn
I'm so glad we're thru
Thx 4 nthn / F u 2 / Thx 4 nthn
I'll run over u

So you think you're God
I recommend you check again, you're just a fraud
I finally called your bluff, now I'll rough you up
Well, better late than never

I'll try to make this quite clear
It ain't pretty but at least I am being sincere
Ya ready? I got something to get off my chest
If only for the record

Thx 4 nth / Thx 2 u / Thx 4 nthn
I'm so glad we're thru
Thx 4 nthn / F u 2 / Thx 4 nthn
I'll run over u

I tried to make this quite clear
It ain't funny but at least I was being sincere
Ya got me? Well, I think I'll just tell you again
If only for good measure

Thx 4 nth / Thx 2 u / Thx 4 nthn
I'm so glad we're thru
Thx 4 nthn / F u 2 / Thx 4 nthn
I'll run over u
