Hunted and hopeless I'm trying to escape a world that's coming after me
I have been struck by a barrage of hate and not a soul on earth could rescue me

How did it get this far and where did I go wrong?

As I slowly bleed the whole world's after me
When I close my eyes I feel them coming
I slowly bleed, they're closing in on me
I am scared but I must keep on running
So red the street as I slowly bleed

Fallen and helpless, still trying to wake up, wake up from what I hope is just a dream
Instead I'm staring at reality raising its ugly head and not a soul on earth could rescue me

Why did it get this far and where did I go wrong?
Did I cause the pain to deserve this?

As I slowly bleed the whole world's after me
When I close my eyes I feel them coming
I slowly bleed, they're closing in on me
I am scared but I must keep on running
So red the street as I slowly bleed

Out for the count, come and get me now, out for the count come and hit me now
Out for the count, come and kill me now, I'm waiting
Out for the count, come and get me now, out for the count, come and hit me now
Out for the count, come and kill me now, I'm waiting for you

As I slowly bleed the whole world's after me
When I close my eyes I feel them coming
I slowly bleed, they're closing in on me
I am scared, I am scared
So red the street, so red the street, so red the street as I slowly bleed
