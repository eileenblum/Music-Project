Will we remember, where have the memories gone
What are we here for, how can we know
Who will we turn to, what's in the future of ours
What lies ahead of us, where will we go?

Fly away with me and find me something to believe
You can feel it in the air somehow
Fly away with me and find a dream to live right now
You can feel it anywhere
Fly away with me, come take my hand and feel it now
It is everywhere

Where do we come from, what are we going to be
Will there be better days, how can we know
Who will we run to, what's in the future of man
Who can we turn to, where will we go?

Fly away with me and find me something to believe
You can feel it in the air somehow
Fly away with me and find a dream to live right now
You can feel it anywhere
Fly away with me, come take my hand and feel it now
It is everywhere

See the world through the eyes of a child
And tell me what you feel
Say, don't you see what we need?

Fly away with me and find me something to believe
You can feel it in the air somehow
Fly away with me and find a dream to live right now
You can feel it anywhere
Fly away with me, come take my hand and feel it now
It is everywhere
