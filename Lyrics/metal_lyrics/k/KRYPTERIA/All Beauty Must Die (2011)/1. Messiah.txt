Liberate vosmet ex inferis, ex inferis
Liberate vosmet ex inferis, ex inferis

Do you remember, do you remember who you are?
Just a pretender, just a pretender who has gone too far
Don't try to tell me, don't try to sell me this is Jesus' way
Good luck, you'll need it bad, you'll need it bad come judgment day

No, I don't buy what you say, no, I don't buy what you say

You're no messiah, you're no messiah
You've set them all on fire but I can't keep on living in denial
You're no messiah, you're no messiah
I used to think you were but you are nothing but another liar

Do you remember, do you remember all those lies you told?
You selfish gambler, you sold your friends, you'd trade your soul for gold
But I will never fall for all your bullshit again, no, I won't
No, I don't care what you say no more

No, I don't buy what you say, no, I don't buy what you say
No, I don't buy what you say, shut the hell up, just go away

You're no messiah, you're no messiah
You've set them all on fire but I can't keep on living in denial
You're no messiah, you're no messiah
I used to think you were but you are nothing but another liar

You're no messiah, you're no messiah
You've set us all on fire but I can't keep on living in denial
You're no messiah, you're no messiah
I used to think you were but you are nothing but another liar
No, you're nothing but a liar, no, no, no
You're no messiah, you're no messiah
I used to think you were but you are nothing but another liar
