Down I go, a heart's been shot, you already left the scene
Tell me why this had to die, did my dreams play tricks on me?

Whatever happened to us, where did we go wrong?
And what happened to the love, where did we go wrong?

You killed me, you killed me
You killed my love, my everything
You killed me, you killed me
You killed my everything

Silence screaming in my face as I slowly bleed
The only sound I hear is hope as it shuts the doors on me

Whatever happened to us, where did we go wrong?
And what happened to the love, where did we go wrong?

You killed me, you killed me
You killed my love, my everything
You killed me, you killed me
You killed my everything
