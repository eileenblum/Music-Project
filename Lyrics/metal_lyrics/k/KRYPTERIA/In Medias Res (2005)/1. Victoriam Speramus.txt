When all the lights go down and when the final curtain falls
When there is nothing left to say
Eternity eventually will linger through abandoned halls
Will leave us struck in disarray

The time has come for us to earn ourselves a new day
Go down on bended knees and pray

Victoriam speramus, damnate timiditam
Concordiam optamus, iuvate libertatem
Victoriam speramus, negate subversorem
Concordiam optamus nunc

One man's peace of mind might be another man's despair
In these our enigmatic times
While some pray for redemption
Some hope they'll redeem themselves through prayer
To each his own, this is your life

The time has come for us to earn ourselves a new day
Go down on bended knees and pray

Victoriam speramus, damnate timiditam
Concordiam optamus, iuvate libertatem
Victoriam speramus, negate subversorem
Concordiam optamus nunc

Victoriam speramus, damnate timiditam
Concordiam optamus, iuvate libertatem
Victoriam speramus, negate subversorem
Concordiam optamus, victoriam speramus
Negate subversorem, concordiam optamus nunc
