Will the sun rise again, will the morning come
Will there be another day before we come undone
Will we set sail again or is this our last stand
Will tomorrow smile on us or have we reached the end

Who knows?
But this I know for sure
They can't take that away from me
My memories of you will live

Always and forever
Aeternitas veniat
Aeternitas coniunctionis
Always and forever
Aeternitas veniat
Aeternitas sponsionis
Amor vero sicut est anulus, finem non habet
Always

Will the moon shine on us, will she be our guide
Will we find a way to slow the floating sands of time
Will we see the light of day or must we say farewell
Will tomorrow smile on us or are we bound to fail

Who knows?
But this I know for sure
They can't take that away from me
My memories of you will live

Always and forever
Aeternitas veniat
Aeternitas coniunctionis
Always and forever
Aeternitas veniat
Aeternitas sponsionis
Amor vero sicut est anulus, finem non habet
Always

Always and forever
Aeternitas veniat
Aeternitas coniunctionis
Always and forever
Aeternitas veniat
Aeternitas sponsionis
Amor vero sicut est anulus, finem non habet
Always and forever
Aeternitas veniat
Aeternitas coniunctionis
Always and forever
Aeternitas veniat
Aeternitas sponsionis
Amor vero sicut est anulus, finem non habet
Always
