As I awoke this morning and realized you were gone
I wondered what life would be like if we were over and gone

And I know that
I can't replace your face, your touch, your smile
I miss you like crazy, I'm lost inside
I promise I'll wait for you wasting my time
Trying to count all the tears I cry

When I'll rest my head tonight this house just won't feel like home
And I'll lay there helplessly yearning, staring all night at the phone

And I know that
I can't replace your face, your touch, your smile
I miss you like crazy, I'm lost inside
I promise I'll wait for you wasting my time
Trying to count all the tears I cry
The tears I cry

No, I can't replace your face, your touch, your smile
I miss you like crazy, I'm lost inside
I promise I'll wait for you wasting my time
Trying to count all the tears I cry
The tears I cry
