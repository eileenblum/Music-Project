Carry me away to a brighter day
Carry me away, spread those wings for me

At the end of the day everyone falters
No time to waste with sands running low
So I capture the wind, I will shed my skin
I won't consider what might have been
Embracing the sky, the ultimate high
My heart and my mind and my soul will fly

Animus liber - carry me away
Animus liber - to a brighter day
Animus liber - carry me away
Spread those wings for me

By the end of the night lightness takes over
New sights ahead, places to go
So I capture the wind, I will shed my skin
I won't consider what might have been
So I'll walk through that door unlike before
My heart and my mind and my soul will soar

Animus liber - carry me away
Animus liber - to a brighter day
Animus liber - carry me away
Spread those wings for me

Animus liber - carry me away
Animus liber - to a brighter day
Animus liber - carry me away
Spread those wings for me

Carry me away to a brighter day
Carry me away, spread those wings for me
