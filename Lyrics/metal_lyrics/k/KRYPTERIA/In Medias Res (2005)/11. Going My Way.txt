You promised that we'd stick together like glue
With me you'd even take a trip to the moon
I can't understand how a man makes such plans
Then dances the dance to a totally different tune

I'm out on my own now but I'll make it somehow
You just can't keep me down

I'm going my way, no matter what you say
It's about me baby come what may I'm going my way
Oh I'm going my way, better listen what I say
It's all about me baby come what may I'm going my way

Well I might have fallen but I tell you darling
That soon I'll be back on my feet
I sorted you out boy the bail's in your court now
Go find a way to make it up to me

I'm out on my own now but I'll make it somehow
You just can't keep me down

I'm going my way, no matter what you say
It's about me baby come what may I'm going my way
Oh I'm going my way, better listen what I say
It's all about me baby come what may I'm going my way
I'm out on my own now but I'll make it somehow
I'll go my own way, you can't keep me down
I might be wrong but I'll keep holding on
Oh and try all my best, baby, I'm here to stay
Cause I'm going my way

I'm going my way, no matter what you say
It's about me baby come what may I'm going my way
Oh I'm going my way, better listen what I say
It's all about me baby come what may I'm going my way
I'm out on my own now but I'll make it somehow
I'll go my own way, you can't keep me down
I might be wrong but I'll keep holding on
Oh and try all my best, baby, I'm here to stay
Cause I'm going my way
