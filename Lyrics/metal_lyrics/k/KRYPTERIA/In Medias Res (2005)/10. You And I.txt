You gave me oh so much that I never wanted
You gave me everything I can't stand
You're like a ton of dust when I'm lost in the desert
A bag of bricks when I'm stuck in quicksand

You're a pool of fuel when my house is on fire
You're like a blindfold in the dark
You're like a glass of water when I'm drowning in the ocean
A bag of tricks when all I want is straight play

Vade retro inimice vade retro nunc - make my day say byebye
Vade retro inimice - there's one more bridge to burn

You and I were like angels in the sky
Till we both came crashing down
This you-and-I thing's over now
You and I were like angels in the sky
Till we set our wings on fire
This you-and-I thing's bound to die

Tell me whatever happened to our bed of roses
And why it turned into a bed of thorns
I'm the bird on the beach too bad that you to me
Are like the oilpollution coming to kill me

To me you're just as lovely as a nasty train-wreck
I'll miss you like a hole in my head
So do us both a favor go and hit the road jack
Please get lost cause I'm sick off fighting

Vade retro inimice vade retro nunc - make my day say byebye
Vade retro inimice - there's one more bridge to burn

You and I were like angels in the sky
Till we both came crashing down
This you-and-I thing's over now
You and I were like angels in the sky
Till we set our wings on fire
This you-and-I thing's bound to die

Thanks for absolutely nothing, thanks for absolutely nothing

Vade retro inimice vade retro nunc - make my day say byebye
Vade retro inimice - there's one more bridge to burn

You and I were like angels in the sky
Till we both came crashing down
This you-and-I thing's over now
You and I were like angels in the sky
Till we set our wings on fire
This you-and-I thing's bound to die
