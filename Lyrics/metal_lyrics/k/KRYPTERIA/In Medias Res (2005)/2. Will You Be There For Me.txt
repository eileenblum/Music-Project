Will you be by my side or are you gonna leave when it all falls down
Will you stay with me all the way or will I find that you're nowhere to be found
Would you rescue my life or would you break the promise that you once made
Say would you carry me all the way or would you leave me out there in the rain

Everything's been swell so far but one thing I need to know

Quo vadimus?
Will you be there for me, will you be near to save me and dry my tears
Quo vadimus?
Will you be there for me, will you be here, I need you to be sincere
Quo vadimus?
You may never know how much this means to me
Will you be there for me
Quo vadimus?

Would you lift me back up or would you shove my face
In the drift for good
Would you stick to the things you said
Or would you tell me "baby, you misunderstood"
Will you be there for me or don't you give me a damn about what I feel
Say would you carry me all the way or could you care less about my needs

Everything's been swell so far but one thing I need to know

Quo vadimus?
Will you be there for me, will you be near to save me and dry my tears
Quo vadimus?
Will you be there for me, will you be here, I need you to be sincere
Quo vadimus?
You may never know how much this means to me
Will you be there for me
Quo vadimus?

Everything's been swell so far but one thing I need to know

Quo vadimus?
Will you be there for me, will you be near to save me and dry my tears
Quo vadimus?
Will you be there for me, will you be here, I need you to be sincere
Quo vadimus?
You may never know how much this means to me
Will you be there for me
Quo vadimus?
You may never know how much this means to me
Will you be there for me
