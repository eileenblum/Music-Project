Here we stand and we made it very far
Hey I catch you in my heart
It's been a long time coming but here we are
Start the journey to the stars

You can count on me, I'll never let you down
You're a part of me, I'll help you out

[Refrain:]
(Concordia) We can make it through the night
(Concordia) If we only hold on tight
(Concordia) We will make it through alright
(Concordia) I'll be forever by your side
As long as we stand together, our dream can come alive
The time has come for us to step into the light, we'll be alright

When you're feeling down or need a friend
There is one thing you need to understand
We're in this together now and then
If you need me just reach out your hand

You can count on me, I'll never let you down
One thing I'll guarantee I'll bail you out

[Refrain 2x]
