How, how do I know what's real, tell me how, tell me now

How, how do I know what's real or what a girl supposed to feel
When all around me seems so weird, tell me now

No more lies - veritas tecum
The pries I have to pay is way too high
No more lies - veritas tecum
No I don't want to make this sacrifice
I never will cause I don't want to live with all your lies
No more lies - veritas tecum, veritas

And how, how do I know what's true or what a girl's supposed to do
Will all the lies you put me through, tell me now

No more lies - veritas tecum
The pries I have to pay is way too high
No more lies - veritas tecum
No I don't want to make this sacrifice
I never will cause I don't want to live with all your lies
No more lies - veritas tecum, veritas

I, I decided long ago that I won't take this anymore
I just can't this anymore, no more

No more lies - veritas tecum
The pries I have to pay is way too high
No more lies - veritas tecum
No I don't want to make this sacrifice
I never will cause I don't want to live with all your lies
No more lies - veritas tecum, veritas
