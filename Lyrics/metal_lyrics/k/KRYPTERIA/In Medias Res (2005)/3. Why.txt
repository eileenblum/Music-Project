Questions questions intertwined, a secret to be told
I need some answers to ease my mind, I need them to unfold
Pages turned under pallid light, my confidence out cold
The truth a lie, but why, tell me

Why do you leave me in the cold
Why did you break this heart of gold
Why did you lie to me, tell me why
Respondate confestim

Answers answers you've been found, the secret stripped and bare
Reality turned upside down, the truth has left me scared
I need to break away right now instead I'm trapped in here
The truth a lie, but why, tell me

Why do you leave me in the cold
Why did you break this heart of gold
Why did you lie to me, tell me why
