Oh how sweet that the thoughts and dreams are free
My emotions flying high, imagination running wild
Just the thought of you makes me giggle like a little fool
How I wish that you were near to quickly get me out of here

Won't you save me, set me free, unbreak me
Save me, get me out of here and take me home
Cogita rationabilis, carpe vitam honorabilis
Save me, set me free, unbreak me
Save me, I'm waiting here please take me home

Thanks to you I saw places that I never knew
That one moment in time made all difference in my life
Being away from you makes me feel the darkest shade of blue
How I hope that you are near so you can get me out of here

Won't you save me, set me free, unbreak me
Save me, get me out of here and take me home
Cogita rationabilis, carpe vitam honorabilis
Save me, set me free, unbreak me
Save me, I'm waiting here please take me home

Say you'll be here, say you'll be here, say you'll be here

Won't you save me, set me free, unbreak me
Save me, get me out of here and take me home
Cogita rationabilis, carpe vitam honorabilis
Save me, set me free, unbreak me
Save me, I'm waiting here please take me home
