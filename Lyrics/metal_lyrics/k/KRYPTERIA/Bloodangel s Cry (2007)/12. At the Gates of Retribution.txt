I can't hide the scars I wear from once promising affair
I should have never signed that deal the wounds it caused won't heal
So be careful of desire beware the tempting fire it might be fatal
Can I drive this message home and save a life from going wrong, am I able?

The game is over I've come to the end of this road - I lost my soul on the way up if only I had known
The game is over I'm facing the ruins of my life but I won't go down in ashes without one last cry

Did I make myself heard by shaking up the world? Say was it worth it?
Were my actions justified or just another waste of time and do I deserve this?

The game is over I've come to the end of this road - I lost my soul on the way up if only I had known
The game is over I'm facing the ruins of my life but I won't go down in ashes without one last cry

Et quiscere faciam multitudinem canticorum tuorum et sonitus citharaum tuarum non audietur ampilus

The game is over I've come to the end of this road - I lost my soul on the way up if only I had known
The game is over I'm facing the ruins of my life but I won't go down in ashes without one last cry
