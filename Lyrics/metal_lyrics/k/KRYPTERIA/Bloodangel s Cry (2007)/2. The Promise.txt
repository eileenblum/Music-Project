He said:
Just sign your name across the dotted line and take advantage of the goods I have to offer
It won't cost you much
Just a single drop of blood
And I'll hand you the things you have long been wishing for

It's an easy way to choose
What do I have to lose?

Will I fall? Opulentiam aeternam gloriamque te promitto
Will I stand tall? Quidquid agis prudenter agas et respice finem
Will I fall? Venustatem infinitam gloriamque te promitto
Will I stand tall? Quidquid agis prudenter agas et respice finem

Should I sign and end this lifelong string of broken dreams of failure,
Shattered hopes or trials and tribulations
It won't cost a thing
All the world will hear me sing
And I'd have all the riches, the fame and everything

It's an easy way to choose
What do I have to lose?

Will I fall? Opulentiam aeternam gloriamque te promitto
Will I stand tall? Quidquid agis prudenter agas et respice finem
Will I fall? Venustatem infinitam gloriamque te promitto
Will I stand tall? Quidquid agis prudenter agas et respice finem

Should I sign and blindly dance along to the pipers tune
Or should I rather trust my inner voice to guide me
I don't own a lot
But I still get one last shot
So do I need to believe in a promise and its seed
Am I willing to chose when it's myself I could lose?

Will I fall? Opulentiam aeternam gloriamque te promitto
Will I stand tall? Quidquid agis prudenter agas et respice finem
Will I fall? Venustatem infinitam gloriamque te promitto
Will I stand tall? Quidquid agis prudenter agas et respice finem
