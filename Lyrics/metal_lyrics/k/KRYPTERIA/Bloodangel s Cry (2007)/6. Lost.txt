I'm trapped under ice, my veins about to burst - all shattered broken empty and scared
I honestly don't know what frightens me worse - me going under or you not being there
I thought you'd remember the promise you made - I am scared
To never leave me all alone in the rain - so scared
But it seems to me like you never ever told me the ugly truth - misled
Excuse for not understanding about being a fool

I'm so lost where are you when your supposed to save me and make sure that I will make it through alive
Lost and waint for you the one who once betrayed me only to tell me everything will be fine
Seems like my hopes are only a joke away - cause I've never been lost all the way

My sould hase been flogged , crucified out there - ever since you bailed I've run all out of tears
I honestly can't tell you what's harder to bear - me slowly dieing or you not being here
I thought you'd remember the promise you made - I am scared
To never leave me all alone in the rain - so scared
But it seems to me like you never ever told me the ugly truth - misled
Excuse for not understanding about being a fool
