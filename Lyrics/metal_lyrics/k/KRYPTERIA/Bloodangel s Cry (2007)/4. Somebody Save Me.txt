I bare my soul on a silver platter - my back to the wall blindfolded tied up battered
Yearning for someone someone to end this misery but will that someone anyone every come to rescue me?

Somebody save me, I'm close to the edge - someone to fill me with life give me dreams I've never had
Somebody save me and answer my pleas  - someone to lift me back up and put my heart at ease
Somebody help me please

Outcast alone searching but never finding - I'd give my all for a trace of silver lining
Yearning for someone someone to end this misery but will that someone anyone every come to rescue me?

Somebody save me, I'm close to the edge - someone to fill me with life give me dreams I've never had
Somebody save me and answer my pleas  - someone to lift me back up and put my heart at ease
Somebody help me please

There's not much left for me to lose can anyone heal these wounds?
Someone to start my life anew - where's that someone where are you?

Somebody save me, I'm close to the edge - someone to fill me with life give me dreams I've never had
Somebody save me and answer my pleas  - someone to lift me back up and put my heart at ease
Somebody help me please
