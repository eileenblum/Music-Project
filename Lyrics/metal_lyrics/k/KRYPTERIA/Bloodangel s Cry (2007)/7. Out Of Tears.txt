The flood is rising I am deep within the ground starts sliding now it's time for me to sink or swim
Can't find the shoreline God knows I've tried - I'm close to drowning in the ocean I cried
Too late for me to stop the seething tide

I'm out of tears was it worth it? No tears to cry over you
I'm out of tears but your still thirsty - no tears cause I've wasted all I had on you

You can't imagine how bad it hurts - the fact that you sucked the lifeblood off my eyes just to quench your thirst
I'm going under your high and dry - still I'm drowning in the ocean I cried
Too late for me to stop the seething tide

I'm out of tears was it worth it? No tears to cry over you
I'm out of tears but your still thirsty - no tears cause I've wasted all I had on you
