As I look back at all the things I've done and see the person I've become
I realize I have to pay the dues for setting lose this sea of flames
As I review the path I chose all the damaged that I caused
Judgement day for me has come, was it right was I wrong?

This is the night all the angels cry, and their tears set the heavens alight
This is the night of screaming the sky is bleeding and no one but myself is to blame
This is the night all the angels cry, as their falling with wings of fire
This is the night of screaming the sky is bleeding and I'm the one who has to pay

Now that I'm done reflecting on my past for me there will be no peace at last
Cause I can't wash my hands of all the bloodshed all the pain I've caused
And as the sands of time run low can't find my way home
Judgement day for me has come, was it right was I wrong?

This is the night all the angels cry, and their tears set the heavens alight
This is the night of screaming the sky is bleeding and no one but myself is to blame
This is the night all the angels cry, as their falling with wings of fire
This is the night of screaming the sky is bleeding and I'm the one who has to pay

The time has come for you to go now everybody's got to pay somehow
Step up and take your final blow now make sure to close the door on the way out

This is the night all the angels cry, and their tears set the heavens alight
This is the night of screaming the sky is bleeding and no one but myself is to blame
This is the night all the angels cry, as their falling with wings of fire
This is the night of screaming the sky is bleeding and I'm the one who has to pay
