"Stupid me why did I sign?" I ask myself as here I find myself sinking into the quicksand of your crime
Have I not done enough for you? Now that you've taken the best of me we're even so why don't you let me leave?
Read what you signed - it tells you that you relinquished all your rights

I can't breathe I'm in trouble - I never knew that I could bite off more than I could chew
I can't breathe burst my own bubble- I'm through with dancing your tune
we are through

How can I have been so blind to fall to all your pompues lines and embrace you only to get stabbed from behind
You nailed your victim to the wall and put me on display for all to see - I'm sick of living behind the eight ball
Read what you signed - it tells you that you relinquished all your rights

I can't breathe I'm in trouble - I never knew that I could bite off more than I could chew
I can't breathe burst my own bubble- I'm through with dancing your tune we are through

Read what you signed - it tells you that you relinquished all your rights

I can't breathe I'm in trouble - I never knew that I could bite off more than I could chew
I can't breathe burst my own bubble- I'm through with dancing your tune we are through
