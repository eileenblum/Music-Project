As the lights come crashing down without the slightest sound we turn this page for good there's more to this book
With the echo of the chimes still ringing in our mind we have to move ahead because we are not done yet
Capture the wind change your skin

Dream yourself far away start spreading your wings now let your mind disobey capture the wind
Dream yourself far away embrace the unknown now free yourself from all the chains

When your gazing at the sky with a heart all strapped and tied resist your fate unbind set sail free your mind
Complete the task at hand the end is not the end despite all the dismay we'll live to fight another day
Capture the wind spread your skin

Dream yourself far away start spreading your wings now let your mind disobey capture the wind
Dream yourself far away embrace the unknown now free yourself from all the chains

Time to move on, dream yourself to a new place your chance to travel to a whole different time and place

Dream yourself far away start spreading your wings now let your mind disobey capture the wind
Dream yourself far away embrace the unknown now free yourself from all the chains
