Have you ever felt the urge to bid the world farewell - disenchanted by the taste of your own personal hell?
I don't need no sympathy just a little honesty would that really be too much to ask?
But in all probability my intangibilities are causing problems letting down your mask
'Step back look at that' everybody's lack of the ability to hear a person out
'A little too loud, a little too proud' wanna find out what I'm about

I scream but no one around seems to hear me - I scream - got something to say I deserve to be heard

Have you ever felt the need to turn your inside out only to find out nobody gives a damn what your truly about
 don't need no sympathy just a little honesty would that really be too much to ask?
But in all probability my intangibilities are causing problems letting down your mask
'Step back look at that' everybody's lack of the ability to hear a person out
'A little too loud, a little too proud' wanna find out what I'm about

I scream but no one around seams to hear me - I scream - who cares they just lock me out
I scream yet no one around seems to care about me - scream - got something to say I deserve to be heard

I scream but no one around seams to hear me - I scream - who cares they just lock me out
I scream yet no one around seems to care about me - scream - got something to say - listen
