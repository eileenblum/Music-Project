A quest of ancient fear
Open up the grave
Our reign will last forever
At the cast of all these slaves
The build a sacred kingdom
It blocks out all the light
Now hear the cries of thousand
As the tyrant comes in sight

[Chorus:]
Save us god
We still have hope and faith
All we need is the courage to
face the truth
But we're under the
curse of the pharaoh
And the sky is turning red
Our greed calls up the
faceless dead
So we're under the
curse of the Pharaoh

For a thousand years the curse
still remains in our land
For a thousand years the darkness
whirls the sand
I bear a final stone, step by step
up the stairs
This love of selfishness causes tears
We are heading for war

[Chorus]

Do not trust his darkling wings
He is just an ordinary king
And his mystery will crumble soon

Instead of running blind
I opened up my mind
May all these souls divine
Make the pyramids fall
