Riding my horse
Raising my forse
I don't believe in destiny
There is no regret

Fighting with your sword
Finding treasures
I don't believe in destiny
Going ahead

Crying until
No tears left
I don't believe in destiny
Going ahead

My hair is waving
My blood is boiling
I don't believe in destiny
Going ahead

[Chorus:]
I used to be timid
Now I am
Stronger than before

Leaving the top floor
Open the door
No time for rest
Time goes by
Make a decision

[Chorus 2:]
I'm searching for a rainbow in the night
It's invisible to my eyes
Where are you now
Your voice in echoing in my head

I forget the words you said
For the soul of me
I can not remember
Tell me again

I'm searching for a rainbow in the night
It's invisible to my eyes
It slowly comes into my sight

Now i can see your real reason
Memories flow nowhere

[repeat chorus and chorus 2]

[Solo guitar]

[Chorus 2]
