I hear the voice from nowhere
Message from above
"keep your purity, and the queen appears"

Getting through this twisted world
I've put away my purity
I reliaze i'm all alone
In this desolate scene

Out in the cold
Standing alone
Where are you now?
I get closer
But you keep in distance

[Chorus:]
The queen wore mystic purple
Gold ashes fall
The queen wore mystic purple
Silver rains falls
The queen wore mystic purple
She knows all of me

Save me and
Take me now
Pleasa raise me up
To the sky

White wings turned into gray
And fell out slowly
I'm getting weakened
Losing control

I was captured in the cage
But she saved me
Bleeding her holy blood

[Chorus]
