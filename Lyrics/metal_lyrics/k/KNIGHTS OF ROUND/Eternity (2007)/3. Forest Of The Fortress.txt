Under cover of the sound
of shaking leaves
Something is breathing
Be careful
Sinister night
Feeling of evil from the forest 
builds up especially
in such a storming night

[Chorus]
The claws tear silence 
in the darkness
The fangs pierce your heart
Behind you
gleaming yellow eyes are 
aiming at a game
Run away now!

It changes many preys 
into the power
Growling at even the god
The strongest beast of the war

It ridicules our civilization 
Do you know the tragic end 
of missing hunters?
The heavy body is lit
by many of lightnings
A kingdom of beast
is being built now

[Repeat chorus]

It changes many preys 
into the power
Growling at even the god
Forest of the Fortress

It changes many preys
Into the power
Growling at even the god
Forest of the Fortress
