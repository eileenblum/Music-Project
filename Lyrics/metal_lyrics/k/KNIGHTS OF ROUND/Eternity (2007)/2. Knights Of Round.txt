Under the press into the dark
People are suffering heavily
Standing by lies full with this world
I grieve for lacking of hope

Oh but I believe the light
I cannot but finding and fighting

[Chorus]
We must go into the right
Hesitating is a waste any more
Break the shell, show them the will
We are the knights

Through a lot of villages and towns
Across many mountains and valleys
Cold wind rain like bullets
It prevents our journey

Oh but we cannot give up
Our determination is harder than the steel

Hold the mind, Metallic spirit
Never yield under compromise
Rise the soul of steely serenade, it lights the world
Now is the last We never lose
We finally overcome all fears
Fortune favors the brave, us
Knights of Round

If angels were crying into the deep hole of lament
We would never doubt our hopes
Fly the destroyed sky and run tone ground
The time has already come

[Repeat chorus]

Remember that when we were the men of that ancient legend
Cut the evil with melodic sword
