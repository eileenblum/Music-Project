What was I born from?
Where am I heading for?
I'm repenting in my heart

Moment of eternity
Silent fury
The figure is insecurity
The grass is trembling in the tender breeze
The sun always gives us a light
We think the same thing around the history
We feel we're foolish and powerless

Many white balls of fight are rising from the battlefield
They will fly high in the sky and gather around the tree of life

We know those are waste of time and men
I'm driving for a castle of illusion

Lives some around the earth,
I'm watched by god and nature force
We will know our sings after this world
Regret is too late
The time for judgement is coming soon
The order of the universe
Never change

Believing that it is paradise
But there are no secrets any more
Searching the truth and finding the path
We can't get ourselves

The time to reward comes to everyone
You will notice that life is infinity

Rising the memory
And you will find that endless way
We make a journey
Wearing the shabby shoes
Turning forevermore like an ocean of life and death
I saw the records of god and truth

Lives some around the earth,
I'm watched by god and nature force
We will know our sings after this world
Regret is too late
The time for judgement is coming soon
The order of the universe
Never change

Rising the memory
And you will find that endless way
We make a journey
Wearing the shabby shoes

You're allowed to make a new world
Be a son of our god
All of the sights and all of the sounds call you
They want their last leading

You may know
You're the only one
Pierced by the reason of our universe
Grieving for weakness of the mind
But you know that it is yourself
I want to run until the end
Meaning that I struggle with me at any time
Desires are beaten for hiding the goal I want to run until the end...
