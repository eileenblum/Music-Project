I looked up
the high ramparts
which defended us
from the legion of hell
I don't want to think
that our things
which we saved
crumble with vulgar noise

Judas!
Even this country has
already decayed
Perhaps the gun
will bear on my motherland
I don't know
what I can believe

A tear
like a sapphire was shed
A tear
lighted all of the land
All of the towns
All of the shrines
All of the skies
All of the nests

After all
everyone like themselves
Desires are limitless
like the universe
Now and then
such a truth causes
believer's sadness
The nobles tone my mind
Money gathers around
the place where
there is a tree of money
Poor people cannot
change their life
Oh! My injustice world

A tear
like a sapphire was shed
A tear
lighted all of the land
All of the towns
All of the shrines
All of the skies
All of the nests
The world will fill with hope

Judas!
Even this country has
Already decayed
Perhaps the gun
Will bear on my motherland
I don't know
What I can believe

A tear
Like a sapphire was shed
A tear
Lighted all of the land
All of the towns
All of the shrines
All of the skies
All of the nests
The world will fill with hope

I feel I lost
my fortune
which I should guard
I was covered with vanity
There was a beautiful aurora
in the sky
A group of flying dragons
in front of it
The world will fill with hope
