This jungle no longer lives above the lies that make them strong
We`re the ones without fear, But still can't find what keeps us here

Everything we've done, Everything we've gained
It all means nothingâ¦that`s what they say

They`re searching for a reason to condemn what they see
We are the ones without name But without us there`s no one to blame

âYou don`t see me leaving, thatâs what you`re missingâ

They don't know what's going on but they know that something`s wrong
We`ve got to move, weâve got to find our way
Under the cold stare of the trees, we walk away
