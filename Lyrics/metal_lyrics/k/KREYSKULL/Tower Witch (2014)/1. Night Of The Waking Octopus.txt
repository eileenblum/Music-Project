Your world comes crushing down
When the ugly truth will rise
Doesn`t matter where you stand
just wait and see, you`ll pay the price

No one can stop what has begun
it`s too late now, when all is said and done

Tonight you better believe-it`s coming and it ain`t no dream
Tonight you better believe what you see-it`s rising from the sea

No one has seen your face, only writings on the wall
Don`t matter who are, you thought you had it allâ¦but no !!
