Vultures circling in the sky
Everything is changing, nothing will ever return
My days have changed and rolled by
I`m on the trail to nowhere, â¦am I ever gonna learn?

That`s where we will meet- Soulwayâ¦station
Where all the beers are for free- Soulwayâ¦Soulway station

I have a one-way ticket, life will come and go
Don't know what is waiting for me
Life is the passenger and soul is the road
Now say what you're gonna say,my demons are running free
