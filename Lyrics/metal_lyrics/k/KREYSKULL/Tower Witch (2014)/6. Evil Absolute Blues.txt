Roll the dice and you`re mine
You don`t know what`s wrong and what`s right
Say the words, don`t you hide
Your ass belongs to me, in the end of your time

I tempt your soul, until you can feel no more
I play games with your mind, until you lose control

Steal a life and I`ll take yours
This is recycling in the name of evil, of course
Speak no truth, just cross the line
Don`t get me wrong, i`ll take back what is mine

Crack the whip and youâre my slave
Iâm the one who feeds you with fortune and fame
Go ahead, make them pay
Make them kneel down when truth is coming your way
