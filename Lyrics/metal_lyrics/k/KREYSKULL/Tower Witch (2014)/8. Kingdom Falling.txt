Do you think we really care what happens to you?
For far too long we tried to get the sad message trough

âFor years and years we tried to speak, 
For years and years we waited in the state of sleepâ

How can you call yourself a king? 
When the world beneath you is dying
oh, you king of greedâ¦your kingdom`s falling


You know it`s true, We just can`t bring back your mighty glory
Maybe it`s time to end what used to be your story
How can you call yourself a king? 
When the world beneath you is dying
Oh, you king of pain...your kingdom`s falling

It feels like we`re dying every day
For far too long you ruled this land with mental chains
it feels like we`re dying every day
for far too long you drove us to an early grave
