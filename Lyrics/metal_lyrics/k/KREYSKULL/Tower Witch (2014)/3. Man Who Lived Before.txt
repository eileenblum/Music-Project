I`m haunted, i`m haunted by myself

Life is a dream and you`re keeping me awake
I`m not alone , you`re the stranger living in my head

You locked the door and hold the key and now you're staring out the window
For the worldâ¦

There`s nothing above, There`s nothing below
This is not the first time, You`ve been here before

Your words echo from the buried past, things and stories that never meant to last
There are things that I cannot see, until the same face is looking back at me
I cannot run from the truth that you have shown, it`s hard to believeâ¦that no one knows
Nothing here is what it seems, we`re covered by lies..but in dreams we`re free
