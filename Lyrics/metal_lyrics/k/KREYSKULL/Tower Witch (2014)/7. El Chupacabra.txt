You want everything, more than you need
This world looks so different to what it used to be
What You say and do are never the same
All the lights are gone; as I waited for changes that never came

There comes a time when I must realize
Who and what really follows me here in this life

The more I have to hear the more I will fight
But I don`t believe until you strike

Now what do you think? How can this be for real?
There are some things you weren't meant to see
Can't you see what you have brought here?
All the lights are gone; you`re moving all in the name of feast
