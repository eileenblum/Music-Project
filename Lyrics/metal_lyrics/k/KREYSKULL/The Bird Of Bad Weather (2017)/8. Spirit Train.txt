In the dying light the shadows grow
I'm heading back to the world of grand delusions
The strange key is all I have in this world of my own
Maybe I've got something there to find, through dreams and illusions

I'm leaving on Spirit Train
I'll be out of sight, out of frames
It's never lateâ¦ the Spirit Train

They'll show what's real if you'll only go inside
There's no final curtain, so it is time for me to know
Searching for something, that always haunts my mind
Everything comes to an end, at the end there's a window

I'm leaving on a Spirit Train, I'll be out of sight, out of frames
It's never lateâ¦ the Spirit Train

When the time is right, I will know and understand
You said, "Welcome to the afterlife," but soon I have to go
When the time is right, I will know and understandâ¦
You said, "Welcome to the afterlife"â¦ Under the eyes of the great unknown
