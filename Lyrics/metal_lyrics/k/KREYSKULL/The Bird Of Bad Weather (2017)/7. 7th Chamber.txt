Could my eyes deceive me? I'm caught between the living and the dead.
No matter how hard I try, I've got a rope tied around my head

Time will come, time will tell
Will I ever see the daylight again?

Nothing here is what it seems, this place is forever changing
There is a road to walk out of pain, before the dead end is closing in the 7^th chamber

These walls have eyes; I feel their presence all around me
Heaven knows the story is not over, in this place where even demons will bleed

Time will come, time will tell
Will I ever see the daylight again?

Nothing here is what it seems, this place is forever changing
There is a road to walk out of pain, before the dead end is closing in the 7^th chamber

You feel like a king but you lost your bloody mind!
Oh, you poor bastard, you don't see the end, even bridges burn so bright

Nothing here is what it seems, this place is forever changing
There is a road to walk out of pain, before the dead end is closing in the 7^th chamber
