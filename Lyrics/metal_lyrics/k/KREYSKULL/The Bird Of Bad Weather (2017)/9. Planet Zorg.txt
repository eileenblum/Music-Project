I think you know more than you're telling me, my eyes are open but I can't see
Maybe there's a reason for everything, but we just stand here in this garden of stupidity
Why should they ever light our way? Demon faced gods, they just make us kneel and pray
Something's always going on, believe it or not!
They aren't what we thought they were
Maybe there's a treason for everything, there's an open road that leads nowhere
Why should they ever light our way? Demon faced gods, they just make us kneel and pray
Demon faced gods! Time will come and we will see
Demon faced gods! Life beyond this so-called reality
Demon faced gods! Time will come and time will tell
Demon faced gods! Are we living in paradise or are we standing in the mouth of hell?
You only know where you stand, but what you see is not real
Truth will set you free, but your hands will never be clean

Where do you stand when you know?
Death is not a real, it's just a fear supreme
Where do you go when the wall comes down?
Are you gonna run among the chosen ones?
