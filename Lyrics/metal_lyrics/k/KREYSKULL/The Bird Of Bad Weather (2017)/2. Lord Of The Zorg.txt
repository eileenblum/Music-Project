Trapped inside, still searching for the light
Who's turning the wheel? In a place where no one sees

Beware the lord, The lord of the Zorg watching above
Beware the lord...the lord of the Zorg taking us all ...if we know!

We run these streets under the black rain
While the great eye's looking for a feast
The man-made illusion the endless game
Where no one knows who's feeding the beast

Bring down the lord...the lord of the Zorg watching above
Bring down the lord...the lord of the Zorg taking us all ...if we know!

Where time has no meaning, we're so alive but dreaming
Where time has no meaning, high above where the monster is sleeping
