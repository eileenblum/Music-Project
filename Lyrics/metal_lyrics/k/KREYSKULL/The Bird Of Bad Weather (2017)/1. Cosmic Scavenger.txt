Trying to be one they never will be
In the daylight we've never seen

Who will take you to the sky? When you knowâ¦when you know

Nothing stops the madness turning
We're all gathered here to see the truth burning

Who will take you to the sky? When you know death is just a lie
Who will take you to the sky? Build the walls and close your eyes

Showing no escape to the ancient past
We've waited so long, but the time's running fast. Oh yeah
Showing no escape, the great shadow in the sky
We've waited so long to leave it all behind

Who will take you to the sky? When you know death is just a lie
Who will take you to the sky? Build the walls and close your eyes

There's nothing left to say, they don't know what's right
There's is no more price to pay, we're smiling for the end of time

Who will take you to the sky? When we know death is just a lie
Who will take you to the sky? Build the walls and close your eyes
