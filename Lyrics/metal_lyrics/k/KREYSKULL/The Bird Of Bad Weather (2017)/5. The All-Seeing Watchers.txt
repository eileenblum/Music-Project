I see the sky with such different eyes
I can't speak or something takes me to the sky
But I know why the truth won't see the light of day
It's too strong a threat if we're not afraid

I see the sky with such different eyes
I can't even whisper or something takes me to the sky
But I see who's ruling the world, hiding the ones who refused to shine
It's too silent and clouds start to move, there's something in the air that is not right
Just believe, there's nothing to find

"They're watching, they're hearing"
