"Lost in an evil dream, but be sure to never ever scream"

There's an end to everything, but somehow you always find your way
The candles are burning out, every time night fades away

Do you remember? When the devil spoke so kindâ¦
Do you remember? When the flames burned so brightâ¦

There's a time for everything, we've been waiting quiet too long
The time is running out, light's gone and the wind blows strong

Towerâ¦ tower witch, from the distance you see fires burn
Towerâ¦ tower witch, we're waiting for your final return

You danced with the devil and you danced so wellâ¦
You just can't leave 'cause you're caught in a spell

She's still aliveâ¦ still reaching for that door,
She's still aliveâ¦ still smiling after our world lives no more

So sick and tired of waiting, still watching flames crying out loud
Among strange creatures, dancing clownsâ¦ we all stand still without a sound

You can't see the flames, but you feel the burn
Just like I've told you before, you always return
