Something's not right in here, our eyes are blinded from the slavery
Don't be afraid, even the time's closedâ¦ the answer's not so far from here

It's rising, it's coming from the moon
If this is the end now, fire it up the Armageddon groove

Through their visions I will see, days become as dark as night
They are the reason why we're standing here,
Now the sky opens up before my eyes

It's rising, it's coming from the moon
If this is the end now, fire it up the Armageddon groove

Flying god machine
Flying god machine
Do you think there's a chance that we might survive
Do you think there's a chance to see what we never believed

Can you walk away from ancient wheel and see the sings so clear?
Before all the blue skies are gone and we're facing another fear
