Take me to the other side and show me the magic world
When my demons dance around the light
Take me to the other side, show me the secrets untold
Roll the dice, when the lonely moon rides high

Somewhereâ¦ deep in the woods where the spirits move alone
I close the door behind me, far away from the world I've known

Take me to the other side, and show me the different world
When my demons dance around my life
Take me to the other side, show me the secrets untold
Say your prayers, when the lonely shadow rides high

I open my eyes, and see what's standing before me
Should I open the door or should I close the door to the house of forevermore

So far away from everyone else, so far away from the world we've known
I look at this life in which I breathe, where do we come from?

Maybe they just want your soul... and take you where you don't belong
Maybe they just want your soul... so be careful what you're wishing for
