Smooth stones beneath me
Cool air surrounds
Soft and saviourey
You can take me to god
You can take me to god

No it doesn't take your will to set your brace on me
I never doubt your possibilities
Please let go of my sleeve

Ahhh
Ahh Ahh
Ahhh

Smooth stones behind me
Cold air surrounds
Soft and saviourey
You can take me to god
You can take me to god

No it doesn't take your will to set your brace on me
I never doubt your possibilities
Please let go of my sleeve
