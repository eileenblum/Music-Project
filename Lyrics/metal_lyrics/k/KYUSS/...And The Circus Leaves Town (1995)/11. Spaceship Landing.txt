You've been in back of me
Yeah
Feeling sensibly
Yeah
I'm tired of the words
When my my back ain't around here
No more you and me
Yeah
No more listening
Yeah
Tired of your words, all your words are so backwards
Whoa
Whoooaaawhaaa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoooaaawhaaa
Being as lost as can be
Yeah
Touch of purity
Yeah
If you're gonna go now, well I want to go with you
Ahhaa
Whoooaaawhaaa
Ahhaa
Whoooaaawhaaa
Oh Yeah
Your a fucked up man with a fucked up plan
Oh Yeah
Your a fucked up man with a fucked up plan
Oh Yeah
Your a fucked up man with a fucked up plan
Oh Yeah
Oh Yeah
Did I say too much, you didn't want to hear
Did I say too much, I didn't want me to see here
Ohhh
Did I leave too much, I'm not sure what to leave here
Did I hate too much, I'm thinkin' someone should bleed here.
Ohhh
Why the finger? It's all right
Me and you could ...., It's all right
Straighten me out, It's all right
Guiding my life, It's all right

There you go, It's all right
Wait up for me, It's all right
Helping you out man, It's all right
Help me man, I just might
