"Yeah, yeah, put it in gear, baby.
Hell yeah, that's a what I like about you, baby,
you're always on time."

Wherever you go is where I go.
Whatever you say keeps it running.
When the wind blows,
when the sky breaks,
to the horizon,
and believe it.

Where you want me to be.

In the morning when it's raining,
I couldn't believe it,
no complaining.
Fuck the others,
fuck the teachers,
they've never known this,
is he crazy?
