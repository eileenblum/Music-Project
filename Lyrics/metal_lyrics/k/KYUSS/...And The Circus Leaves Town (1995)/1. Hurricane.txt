I feel nothing,
said I don't feel nothing,
and I won't feel nothing at all.
I felt something,
said I really felt something
and I won't take nothing at all.

Hurry up, hurry up, now something
our life has blown me away.
I can't breathe, said I can't breathe nothing,
and I won't/can't fucking breathe at all.
