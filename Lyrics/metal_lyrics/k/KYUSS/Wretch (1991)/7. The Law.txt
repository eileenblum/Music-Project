Darkness, imprisoning me.
Feeling, that darkness in me.

Me and it's you, and I run over you.
So let me be.
Swing low,
Into the blood off of me.

Me and lie on the streets of law,
Breaking down the road.
So bringing me down,
Well in to the ground.
No one sees me, and no one talks,
Cuz we all know it to be mine.
