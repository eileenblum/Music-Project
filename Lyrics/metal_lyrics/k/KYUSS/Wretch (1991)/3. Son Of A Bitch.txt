God damn son of a bitch,
See the young ones play,
And say what you want to hear.

You have a-long legs,
Long Hair,
Big tits,
You got a big arse.
Your butt/pot will never last.
Never Last...

God damn son of a bitch,
See the young ones say, well and play,
What they want to hear, from you.

You say your not fucking with them,
You say they are fucking with you,
Compete with them and you'll never win,
Never Win...

Well its cold where we come from,
But not to make me freeze.
I look around me at what I see,
The world deeper than before,
They put a change in me,
Things are looking pretty blurry.
I keep a wishing she would wake me,
And tell me it was just a bad dream,
But I guess your gonna' be awakened,
Well your already wakened to reality.
Yeah.....
