I've got a wall inside my head
It's got to set your soul free
I've got a Wheel inside my head
The wheel of understanding

I'm a loading, a loading my war machine
I'm contributing to the system,
The break down scheme

I'm a shutting down, I'm shutting down, your greed for green,
I am here to gun it down
I gotta do

I see pretty flowers at my feet
cool breeze, clean air, hospitality,
pretty please, a pretty please, pretty please,
get the hell away from me

I'm a loading, a loading my war machine
I'm contributing to the system,
the break down scheme

I'm a shutting down, I'm shutting down, your greed for green,
I am here to gun it down
I gotta do

HaS
Sht 

I've got a wall inside my head
It's got to set your soul free
I've got a Wheel inside my head
The wheel of understanding]
