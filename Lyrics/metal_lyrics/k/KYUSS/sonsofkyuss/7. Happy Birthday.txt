Happy, happy birthday
Two years dead today
You can't keep me running
You can't keep me from hiding from you
Don't mess around with me
I'm down to the wire
And I'm burning
I'm burning higher and higher and higher
I keep on running
I never seem to get away from you
I can't escape the memories
That haunt me every day and night
Just you leave me alone
I'm down to the wire
And I am burning
Higher and higher and higher
