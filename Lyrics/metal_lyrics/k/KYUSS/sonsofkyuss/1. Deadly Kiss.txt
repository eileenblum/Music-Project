Look into my face now
Stare into my eyes
Hell fire in my veins
In my veins...
I can see through your eyes
It's no disguise to me
I can see through the lies
No one can make a fool of me
Drowning in your loneliness
Gonna bring me down with you
No one buys your innocence
Gonna break your walls in two
In two...
No one buys it
No one wanted you
You...
Dig your grave for two
