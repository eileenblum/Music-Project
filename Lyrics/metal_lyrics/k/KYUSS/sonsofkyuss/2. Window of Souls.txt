Two worlds separate us
I'm alone and waiting -
Waiting for you
Little princess
Come by my side
Come around
Come around to me
Endless waiting for you
Time has held me back no more
End is waiting for you
No one can keep me from you
My life long dream
Come to me for sure
Vowed eternal soul
Now envelope me...
I offer thee all...
All for you
Soul stealer, it's time to be
Spirit away now...
