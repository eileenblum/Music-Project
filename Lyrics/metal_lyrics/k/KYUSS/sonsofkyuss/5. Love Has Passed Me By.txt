Do I look blind
Or deaf
Or dumb to you
Do you see blank pictures on my face
It didn't take long
To figure out
What's wrong with you
Fuck off, I'll put you in your place
Could it be
That love has passed me by
Could it be
You're just a thorn in my side
All I see
Is you walking away from me
All I know
You'll never change me
The hate in me
Is boiling in my veins
I'm gonna take it out on you
And make you feel my pain
Cold caresses
As you walk away
Babe, things aren't
Supposed to be that way
