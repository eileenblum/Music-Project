Don't try to take me away,
Like I can't live without you,
Today, makin' love tomorrow,
So way, swooping you're so fragile,
Die today, you disgrace the mortal.

Fight me lately,
Tried to someone,
We've been laughing,
Since you've been gone,
ANd I want to know,
Did you all enjoy the show?
It's so sad to see you go

And you know

Hanging low today,
I replace the highway,
Love the only way,
Linking hands the wrong way,
So I bare to see you go,
It's so sad to see you go,
I just thought I'd let you know

And you know
