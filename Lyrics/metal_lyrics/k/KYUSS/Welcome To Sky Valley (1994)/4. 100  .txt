Step on it,
I beg you please,
Jus' 100' I'm on my knees,
It's the one you blow,
It's the one you show,
So then you know I'm right_

There's been a place built for you,
Sit by the fire tell, me truths,
Don't blind my eyes turn them blue,
And then I'll dry my face on you

Step on,
I beg you please,
Jus' 100' so I freeze,
Drowning in that ice I fly,
It's a great white place,
And the heat's diseased (*)

one hundred degrees
