I'm standing alone on the cliffs of the world.
No one ever tends to me.
Sitting alone, covered in rays.
Some things are so my mind can breath

Waiting is hard
Fucking takes so long
Draped in sun - hands in sand
Earth acid cleanses me, cleanses me clean
But the world, it never comes

It never comes
It never comes
It never comes

I lay on my side in the edge of the room
She never expects anything from me
Gone are the days - the days of naive
I know I'll miss that part of me.

Waiting is hard
Fucking takes so long
Draped in sun, hands in sand
Earth acid cleanses me, cleanses me clean
But the world it never comes

It never comes
It never comes
It never comes
It never comes
It never comes
