one blow till I take ya down, I'll take ya down
one spoke and your head spins around and around
chrome mags, a million drags, a never lags,
and old transform queen momma you've never seen

hear a purrin motor
and she's a burnin' fuel
push it over baby
oh makin' love (un)to you

power booster, I'm talkin' to god and more
crank it up and above my head
smell my shit eatin grin on the skids of my world
six hundred sixty six miles per hour

hear a purrin motor
and she's a burnin' fuel
push it over baby
oh makin' love.....

hear a purrin' motor
and she's a burnin' fuel
oh baby burnin'
push it over baby
oh makin' love (un)to you
makin' love (un)to you
makin'

get back, get back a rolling
get back, get back a rolling
get back, get back a rolling
get back, get back the motherfucker
get back, get back a rolling
get back, get back the motherfucker
get back, get back the motherfucker
