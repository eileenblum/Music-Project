I awake up tomorrow today,
Just help me burn my head (*)

I could be dead,
What to go,
What to say when you're crossin my line,
Oh, give me time,
Oh, give me time,
Oh, just like they said

I live my life alone,
Never going home,
Just like they said,
It's just a song the same,
It's just a song the same
