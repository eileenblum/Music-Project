I am drinking
I am rolling (you can't stop me)
I am hiding
I am running (you can't stop me)

But I'll never forget you (anyway)
But I'll never forget you (anyway)
But I'll never forget you (anyway)
But I'll never forget you

I am drinking
I am rolling (you can't stop me)
I am running
I am rolling (you can't stop me)

But I'll never forget you anyway
But I'll never forget you anyway
But I'll never forget you anyway
But I'll never forget you

See our family to realize
As it's running down today
I love the city love the day

No fool for you
In this I am
I'm never gonna run about
