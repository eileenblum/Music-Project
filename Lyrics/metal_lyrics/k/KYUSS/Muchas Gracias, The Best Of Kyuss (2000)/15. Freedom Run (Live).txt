Freedom run [Repeat]
Free to run [Repeat]...
Freedom run [Repeat]

No break through,
I steal for you.
I need ya,
And there's nothing you can do, yeah.

Walked hundred miles of desert sun,
To grasp the chance that I'll be gone,
Be one with you, yeah.

Freedom run [x3]

Well I'll break through,
Well I steal for you.
Well I need ya,
And there's nothing you can do, yeah.

No form in past
I hope you last.
You're in my grasp
I loved you oh yeah yeah...
