[Lyrics: Mario Linhares/ Music: Bruno Wambier &amp; Marcelo Barbosa]

Deep inside the night,
Flies a vulture of a vampire,
Searching blood on lamb's neck.
Losing my human reason,
I can't be stoped.
Deep inside the night,
I look for peace which I cannot find,
There are demons dancing,
Deep inside my heart,
They say I must avoid,
Touching the light.
All I ever knew about the sun,
Or somebody told me or
I heard by chance.
All I ever heard about the light,
Say that this power
Can break up my heart.
I've got to get that blood that,
Keep's my wandering death alive,
Killing many souls
And bringing all the darkness
To our side
