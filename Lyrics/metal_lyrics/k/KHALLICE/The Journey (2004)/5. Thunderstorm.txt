[Lyrics: Mario Linhares/ Music: Bruno Wambier &amp; Marcelo Barbosa]

So she came, and shut the words in my voice.
Just waiting, the smile shinning in her face.
But there just fears, that drop from her eyes.
Behind the mask,
The brightness of the other side.
She couln'd hide what she was felling,
Even though her heart is crying loud.
Dissimulating what she really feels.
Decieved all she darkness, my mind and soul.
[Chorus:]
Thunderstorm, show me how to fight!
Because your strengh makes my eyes so blind!
Thunderstorm, I will make of my way.
With or without you each and every day.
She came and said I bring good news.
The wind is blowing in another direction.
And told me about her newest dreams.
They're traveling trhough another
Thunderstorm!
