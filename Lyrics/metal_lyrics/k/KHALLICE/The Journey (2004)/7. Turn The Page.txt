[Lyrics: Alirio Netto/ Music: Bruno Wambier]

You came to me offering some shelter,
And I sacrificed all I was dreaming off.
Searching in my reflection, for a glimpse of another me.
We have made to each other all those broken promisses!
Hey my friend, let's turn the page!
Hey my friend, I will not save you again!
If there's a choice, it's up to me, is my decision!
You don't want that again, so let it all go wrong.
Time can be so precious, when you throw your life away.
You,ve gotta learn that
Everything that's small has to grow, just let it go.
I can't stand, living this way, falling in tears I can't go on!
Knowing that my is gone, this time has gone forever.
Tell me when the kiss of love, becomes a lie.
Your eyes seems like gethsemani, I used to trust, oh fairy tales!
But you gave a juda kiss! Hey my friend, let's turn the page!
Hey my friend, I will not save you again!
Don't you know that's your only fault.
This burn is growing inside my veins.
I'm trying keep this hate out of my head!!!
Hey my friend, let's turn the page!
Hey my friend, I will not save you again!
