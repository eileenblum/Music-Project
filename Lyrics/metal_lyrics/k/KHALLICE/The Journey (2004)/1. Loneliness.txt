[Lyrics: Alirio Netto/ Music: Marcelo Barbosa]

Loneliness has found a home in me.
Happiness has been no friend to me.
And now the sound of silence is louder than everything,
I cannot take it anymore!
Wanting to break the wall,
Which never gave me a reason to be there,
There's nothing I can do about it.
I've been trying to find the meaning,
But I'm afraid to lose myself.
I don't know who I should call I'm losing my mind.
Maybe if i set myself free,
From this world who's punishing me,
Bleeding me, killing me, I'll be alright!
God! I'm bleeding, and now!
I see you, help me! I'm asking, please god!
Don't leave me, save me!
Or I'll fall, please god!!!
Loneliness has gone away,
And happiness is my new best friend.
I learned from the silence how to fly.
Take a look around, it's easier now cos' I found a reason.
I learned from the darkness how my fellings have changed,
Love can save me, love can save the world!
