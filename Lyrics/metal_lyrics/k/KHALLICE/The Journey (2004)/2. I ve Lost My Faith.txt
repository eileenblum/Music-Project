[Lyrics: Alirio Netto/ Music: Marcelo Barbosa]

I've been looking for peace to rest my soul. 
I've been learning,
That the angels are not friends. 
I've been dreaming,
With shadows in my mind.
I'm only asking, just let me breath!
[Chorus:]
I'm blind, how many years have gone?
Help now, my mind is going away.
I'm blind, it's doesn't seem to matter,
I'm blind, and I don't give a shit !
Deep inside me I've lost my faith,
Deep inside me, I wanna hear it all!
[Chorus:]
I'm blind, how many years have passed?
Help me now, my mind is going away.
I'm blind, it doesn't seem to matter,
I'm blind, and I don't give a fuck!
With no guilt, with no shame,
With no sorrow, with no pain.
I told the truth, my hands are tied.
I told the angels,
They could sing to someone new.
They will to someone new!
I wanna hear it all !
