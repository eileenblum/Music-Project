[Lyrics: Mario Linhares/ Music: Bruno Wambier &amp; Marcelo Barbosa]

Fantasies from fanatic's,
Who throw you out from paradise,
The dirt living inside human beings,
Makes me put in you my spite. 
Many times I advised you,
The dangers of evil,
But you've just ignore my words,
Exchanging them for gold.
You just keep on praying,
All these wrong words!
Lost into the ages,
Are the secret books of shit, and full of lies.
Saved in blackness insanity,
Desease of human kind. 
Now the time has come for suffering,
Punishment, and reckoning. 
All the cursed ones who would be on the left,
Will be burned forever.
Many times I advised you,
The dangers of evil, 
But you've just ignore my words,
Exchanging them for gold.
Your future will be black as dark as the night,
You'll pay for all your mistakes
Untill the end of time,
This is gonna bring the end!
