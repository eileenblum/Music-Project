Should I really have to coax nothing but a half a heart that comes and goes, but never really stays? Will desperate words from a desperate song do anything but hurt us both? I'd rather not this time. So give me back what's left of me and I'll settle on my own you can find what you're looking for, I'll wait here, and wait for yesterday. So redraw the maps. we're lost again. Or maybe we were never going anywhere. If only we could trace the steps, we'd never find this place again...But they always wash away. You're asking, I'm trying now, but we passed the starts and found there's nothing really there. There never was. So let's go back again...again.
