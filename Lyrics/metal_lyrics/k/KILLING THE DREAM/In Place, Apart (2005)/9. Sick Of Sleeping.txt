For everyday, for all the years. I tried to try and fell and failed. And you were always here. I tried to write...this is all I got. I tried to sing, but this is how it sounds. Every thought, every word, everything I don't deserve I've held your hand I've weighed you down for far too long now, and I'm falling again. I'll try to let go, to pick myself up now but before I fail again... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (this is so much bigger than me. So much greater than it all. You're so much better than me).
