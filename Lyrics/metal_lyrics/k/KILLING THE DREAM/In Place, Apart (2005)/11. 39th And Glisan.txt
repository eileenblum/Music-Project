We've lost it all, but in the ashes we've found what's been gone for so long. From the deepest pain comes the greatest joy. Remember that if nothing else. And those days we spent our nights running from are never far behind We owe them nothing, but we'll never get away. So we'll pay our debt with blood and sweat from these moments. Just words and the hearts where they were born. Our pockets are as empty as our heads, and that's just how it should be. We're sick and we're tired but we're finally happy. Sometimes all it takes to find a home is to leave. And a thousand miles is all it took this time. We've lost it all but what matters is tonight tomorrow the same. Tonight, we're home, and no matter where we are we'll never be alone.
