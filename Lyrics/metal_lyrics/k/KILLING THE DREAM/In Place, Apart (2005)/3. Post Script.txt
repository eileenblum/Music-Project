(This town is fucked) There's only one way out, and it's down. Down...fucking down. They're all waiting for the end to watch you fall waiting, just to fill the space, there's only one way out, and it's never the right way. We're always right because they're always wrong. We're always right because they're always gone. Everyone foregets in time, and there's always time to kill right now. And while you hear, just try to see, maybe nothing is sincere...Fuck...they're always wrong, they're always wrong, they're always wrong. Fuck this town, fucking walk away. Just walk away to die. Fuck this town, fuck everything, our youth is spent fucking blind. Fuck this song, fucking stop the tape...there's nothing left to say. Fuck this song, just stop the tape. Maybe you'll see in time.
