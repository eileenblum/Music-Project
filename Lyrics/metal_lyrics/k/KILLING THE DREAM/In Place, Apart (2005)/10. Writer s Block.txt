It doesn't matter what I say, it could be anything. All that matters is what they hear, and fuck, it can be beautiful Fuck. We'll turn it into something grand. We killed the meaning, there's nothing to hear. Say it again, we're all shooting blanks. We're reckless and we've got nothing to say. Fuck, I could be way out on a limb, but I don't think you're hearing me. You only like the words that are cliche but then again, who gives a fuck? most of you just want to fuck each other up. I doubt you even hear. I doubt you even care. Fuck.
