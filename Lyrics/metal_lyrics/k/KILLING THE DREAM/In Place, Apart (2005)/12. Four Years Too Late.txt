Just pick up a place, and I'll be there. Pick anything that's what I'll be. Give me anything to say, even if it's nothing. That's all you'll hear. Everything was never enough for you. Do you ever say my name? Or do you ever write down broken thoughts and turn them into songss to throw away? Do you ever close your eyes and wish they'll never open again? I do, it's always worse in silence...No lies to tell no one to hear. When air turns cold. We sleep alone. Everytime I try to say your name it's always worse on nights like this. And every night is just like this. How many times have you closed your eyes and wished to just be happy? Every night ends just like this, for me because we'll never be. We'll never be.
