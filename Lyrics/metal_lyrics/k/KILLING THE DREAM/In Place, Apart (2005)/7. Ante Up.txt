Let's just let them fucking hang. I fucking lost, so let's hang them all. We'll never hang ourselves. You got my all but fucking trust me you're the last one. You got me down, but I got up and now they'll fucking hang. Maybe once I break them down they'll know. And maybe once they're dead inside, they'll start to feel. Because I played my cards and fucking lost. I played my cards, so now they'll die. And everybody dies, but that was my last time. They're all dead, and it's all because of you.
