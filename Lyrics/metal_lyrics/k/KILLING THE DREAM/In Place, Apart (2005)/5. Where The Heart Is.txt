It's been so long since it rained this hard, so I'll drive with the windows down to remember how iot felt to feel alive. The sky starts to clear as I'm passing by your house for the second time again, you're still away...and I'm still here. How long has it been since you've been at home with me? I'm trying to hold on, but I'm just keeping you away. You said "I'm still standing. I'm just looking for a reason" I'm standing right here but I'm holding on too tight. You're looking right through me...or do you feel me at all? And this will never be enough, but if you're going down, this is all I have, just fucking take it. This is all I am, it's always been for you. Choke and break and steal. Take it all again. Just to say you'll n ever leave. Just never leave.
