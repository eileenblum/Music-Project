Sing. You've heard this all before. These words are yours. Scream. You've felt this way before, and you're feeling it again. Sometimes it just seems we're the ones who hope forgot, but sometimes, it seems we're the ones who forgot to hope and you're feeling it again. These words are yours, so scream, everyone. Because we're feeling it again. Scream everyone. So fuck it all, let's burn everything. It was never ours to lose. Our sight is gone, what we see is what we hear, and what we feel we'll believe. We're all fucked, so fuck it all. There's nothing we can do. We're all going down on this ship we'll never make it home...Nothing ever changes because everything was meant to fail. And we're feeling it again. Scream.
