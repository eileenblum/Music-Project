Tonight, one night can last forever, tonight one night can last for years. And damn, maybe they're all right but damn i know they're wrong. Every night reminds me of everything I never had. I still dream in color, it's just the days are black and white. I know where I want to be, I just don't know where I am. And I know your face so well, I just don't know where you are. Hope, I just don't wait, just don't stay. It's all a mess. So I'll take another breath, I'll take another stop again so now I've searched, so now I know all we do is decay.
