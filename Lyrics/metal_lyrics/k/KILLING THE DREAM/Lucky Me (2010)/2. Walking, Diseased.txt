He walk, diseased... This place, it suffocates you
And when it's dark, you're blinded by the light
I've never been a light, never did I was
But I won't stop you from telling me I shine
It wasn't us, it was them
They're the sick ones - Can't you see?
With sunken eyes they stare
and tell me I'm diseased

With empty hearts, in broken voice
They ask me why I am the way I am

And I don't have the strength
To muster up the truth
So I lie, and tell them "it was you"
And they just stare

I wonder how it ends for them
To just slip away in a dead town
If I believed in anything
I'd pray for them

Next town, brighter lights
Sadder stories
Darker eyes
This is where I'll call my home for now

Please, If you believe
Say a prayer for me who walk
Diseased
