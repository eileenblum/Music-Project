We walk in circles. We love in circles. We talk in circles. We live in circles. 
i can't live like this. i can't live like this. i can't keep living 
this. i can't keep living this again. we're always moving on, always 
moving back. back to the same place. so familiar, but it isn't home...
just where we come to forget. how many times can you write the same 
song in a different way? how many times can you live the same life 
on a different day? nobody lives in circles, they just forget. they 
just survive. we live in circles, the same people with different 
faces. we sing the same songs in different keys. we love in circles, 
a little less with every turn. i've never loved like that before, 
and i don't think i will again. and it's coming back again, it's 
ending where it started. and i'd give everything to do it all again. 
you never love like that again (the first time), and the longer that 
you live, the less you feel alive. and we don't die for anything 
anymore. i'd kill to feel like that again, but i'm never going to 
feel like that again. so move on, hold on, or fucking fake it. either 
way, we're losing. either way i'm losing. remember when this was 
everything? in a way, it still is. i want to feel that way again. 
but you don't feel in circles, you just live. you just fall. i'll 
find it again, in a different place. in a different time, with a 
different face. i'll keep moving, because i've got to keep moving. 
just take whatever's left. my heart is dry. this is my last breath. 
this used to be everything. i gave everything.
