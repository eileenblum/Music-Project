We were like that once...when you could die of a broken heart, and 
just one smile could fix it all. we'd get back up when we'd fall. 
and we believed the songs we sang. we knew everything...except 
that it would end, at least the way we knew. i've never known it 
more than i do now. and we would never be like this. we believed 
in forever, because we still had it. somehow it got lost along the 
way. we had things that we lived for, and we'd die for even more. 
we're not colder now...just a little older. and we can't go back,
i just i would have known.
