We should have quit back when we learned this wasn't everything, 
that it all fades. but we never learned how not to care. somehow, 
it still fades. these are the days that should have killed me...getting 
to comfortable with pain. going nowhere in the name of hope, growing 
into broken bones. the fractures have all healed, and i forget that 
they were there. 'sometimes' becomes every time. just wait, it will
be any time. and you'll forget where you come from, if you can say 
it to yourself for long enough. but you're not going anywhere. long 
enough' becomes your life...forgot how you got there. we aren't 
letting go. we aren't letting go. this is letting go. And i'll forget 
where i come from. said it to myself for long enough. I can't go 
anywhere from here. been living 'long enough' to know that it's been 
long enough. i'm letting go.
