One eye open, and you're calling out the blind for all that they 
can't see. i hate to disappoint you, but this is how it's always 
been. a life spent in the dark. it's just now you see. i never 
said i'd fucking stay forever, but when it's time i'll pull the 
trigger myself. and if we're going straight to hell, fuck...
we'll see you there. i'm no fucking martyr, i'm just living the 
time before my turn to die. because a life lived pressed under 
your finger, i'd rather be fucking dead. i know who i am...no one 
can take that from me, especially not some self-centered fuck. 
what if you're just like them?
