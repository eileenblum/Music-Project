the dead are fucking dead, and that's how they should stay. 
why dig them up when you killed them, buried, spit and walked away? 
and then you gave the requiem of a lying, cheating, thief. 
we're better off now that he's dead.' and everyone is safe again. 
the dead are fucking dead, and that's how they should stay. for all 
the years i've spent down here, nothing's really changed. we can 
act like nothing happened, and it's so easy to forget. i was never 
sorry, but don't think i didn't bleed. i can smile now but it 
doesn't change a thing. and if you wonder why you've never heard 
this before, i shouldn't have to tell you in a song. just don't say 
this isn't way you wanted.
