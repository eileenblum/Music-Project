So much wasted time, i've got to catch up now. but i was never really 
lost because you were always found. anything i'll ever be, i'm just 
trying to be you. the only reason i believe in anything is you. 
sometimes you can't see angels because you see them every day. 
you are angels. 
you are my angels.
