Woke up from a nightmare and tried to go back to sleep. these days 
it's not the nightmares that are killing me, it's what comes next. 
at least in nightmares, i know what i'm running from. and i'm scared,
but fear seems better than the truth. these days, my dreams are all 
that's real...it's my life that's all just make believe. and i know 
how it ends, but i can't help but watch. so caught up, i'm breaking 
down. it's getting harder to pretend i care where i land. i want to 
feel, i'm just scared of what that means. i remember when i could 
smile without feeling like such a liar, i just wish i would have 
wrote it down. you ask if there's an end in sight...i wish i had 
an answer. you should have asked me back when i was young. because 
i've had everything, and all i want is more. when you're sick of 
standing, you just fall.
