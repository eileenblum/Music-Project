Pull the shades, I'll stay here in the dark tonight. Because I'm afraid I might catch a glimpse of myself in the light. I hate this fucking song, but I'll turn it up if it keeps me from hearing what I have to say. So I'll tell myself that it's all right, and I'll be fine, but in the end, it's all just lies. Nothing's all right, and I'm not okay. So long I've burned the truth trying to make it right. Tonight I'll spark the flames just one more time. Everything's gone wrong. And I know that it's all my fault.
