[Lyrics: Javid Amini]

A kid from this pure darkness
I vomit my smile from me the conqueror hunter
What's the meaning of life?
Bitter pathetic feelings surround my naked body
However I'll be the eternal evil charm
Regret and sorrow overcame me canker
Pushed me to this eternal darkness
I wonder what is the meaning of my existence?
Day by day my soul becomes more empty
Can't count my wounds
Now I'm becoming to join hell
My inferno is forever and dirty paradise is dead
Spit your essence if you think hell is acrid
Now my maggoty wounds sing in the darkness.
