[Lyrics: Keyvanoth]

You were born
Our fate is also a sad and painful one
And then there was only pain
When did the pain start?
I don't know
You will enjoy it
Life is now mingled with grief
Falling down
You're going to get depressed
Why we cannot stand solitude?
What a disgrace !
Die, goddamn it
Woe unto you, hypocrites
I've cursed myself, I'm damned
Life is a big lie
But in the end, you're still in agony
Your emotions, your memories are dead
My thoughts turn dark
Evil thoughts
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen
Now, self-destruction
Now, self-destruction
Now, self-destruction
"The Philosophy and Empty Deception" of the world
Sadly, though, the cold reality is this: We are mortal.

You're dead!
Lie!
Lie!
Lie!
Lie!
You're dead
Lie!
Lie!
Lie!
You're dead!
This life is big lie!
Lie!
Lie!
You're dead!
