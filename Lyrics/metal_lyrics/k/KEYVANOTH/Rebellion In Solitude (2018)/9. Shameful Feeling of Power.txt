[Lyrics: Keyvanoth]

The end of my life.
The angel rape my soul
I don't feel pain
A new world has opened
I won't give up

The breathes
Tired of repeating
A person like me
Destroyed in this war
Solitude is marching
Toward me
"Hate" is making love with me
That destroys them all
I'm a stranger among these generations
Finally, your life raped in me
Naivety I speak
This is our derogatory lives
These lies are numerous
This is the valley of sincere virgin girls

Hate and solitude and war again
Hail solitude
Death to world
Death to trenchers
Curse on society
I have nothing to do with this world
I'll fuck it like a wolf chasing the blood
These shrieks are repeating from the soul
This jail is resistant
Idiot convoy is fighting with me
What do they think?
That I'm the burner of the world
That I infusion the pain and grief
On this shameful feeling of power

Sexual slaves of the world
The valley of numerous ovum
Creating this thought again
In our minds
The birth of this mental destruction
That makes me thirsty for this debacle
