[Lyrics: Keyvanoth]

There"s no freedom here
My homeland was destroyed
There"s no life here
There"s no news
Which is not...
This is not the world
Today news is pain and sorrow
Today news is end of life
Today news is lie and deceit and hypocrisy

To live
Is to die
When will I die
Confusion
Depression
Frustration
To live
Is to die
When will I die
Confusion
Depression
Frustration
