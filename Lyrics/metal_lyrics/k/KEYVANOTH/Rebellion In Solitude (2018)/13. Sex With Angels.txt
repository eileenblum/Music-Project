[Lyrics: Keyvanoth]

What is my choice? [3x]
Either death or rebellion [2x]
What is my choice?

The hands are bloody
Beliefs are based on money
Superstitions quoted from absurdity
The image of the world becomes like blood
When misguidance and destruction took my breath unwillingly
My world dirtier than ever degrades
I'm narrating accounts of this nasty and mean country
These mischievous thoughts are being drawn on my unlucky mind
I say...
Alas, my life was ruined
Alas, my youthful was broken
Alas, in my childhood I wished to be a teenage
Being youth was my teenage dream
I also spend my youthful days wishing elderliness
It was ruined it was ruined
It was ruined
This was this life was entirely ruined
At the corner of the room my breath got fucked
I'm cheerful for this promise: Sex with angels
To my favour be this nakedness and body
So that my rebellious soul enjoys it
What is my choice? [3x]

Alas, my life was ruined
Alas, my youthful was broken
Alas, in my childhood I wished to be teenage
Being youth was my teenage dream
