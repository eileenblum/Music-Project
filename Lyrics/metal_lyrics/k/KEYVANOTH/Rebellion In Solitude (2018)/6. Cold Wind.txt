[Lyrics: Mehrzad]

Passing through snowy mountains
The cold penetrated deep in me
My life was always cold
Spend my past full of hopelessness
Can't see any future, just living in moment
Cold wind on my body
As life used to whipped me
The silence breaks by cold wintry winds.
Once upon a time I was
Living in a cold and dark room
Far away from people
The silence break by drops of water
Winter, my painkiller
Winter is my life
In winter, facts become clear
Ultimate destruction
Frozen tears of mine, can't fall from my cheeks
By the night I'm relaxed
Winter embrace me
Winter take my soul
Winter take my soul
Winter take my soul
