You can't choose â what you want
In a maze â where someone â else has made the rules

Like a beast â in a cage â you freak out
In sheer rage â life's like in a zoo

Tell me why can't you see â this is your destiny
Welcome, welcome â welcome to the jungle

Hide your head â leave no trace
Or you will â be a blaze â in this masquerade

Dog eat dog â there's no mercy
So watch out â some are free â otherwise you're prey
