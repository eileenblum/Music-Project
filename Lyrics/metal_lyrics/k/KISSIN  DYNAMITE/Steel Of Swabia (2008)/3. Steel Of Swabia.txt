Rock On! Take Off! Hey, buddy! Shout to the top!
Comeâ¦on the stage, keep rollin'!
We'll never stop â you're dynamite
You're thunderbolt â you're rollin' straight away
Rock On! Take Off! Hey, buddy! Shout to the top!
We know we'll never be â We'll never be the same
We feel your energy â It is risin' like a flame

This is steel â Steel of Swabia
We're gonna rock your world â With steel of Swabia
This is steel â Steel of Swabia
We're gonna rock the world â With steel of Swabia

Rock On! You got it, buddy! Shout to the top!
You keep the moshpit rollin'!
Don't wanna stop â You're the fuel
And you're the spark
You're rollin' straight away
Rock On! Take off! Hey buddy! Shout to the top!
We know we'll never be â we'll never be the same
You are the energy
And you feed the swabian flame
