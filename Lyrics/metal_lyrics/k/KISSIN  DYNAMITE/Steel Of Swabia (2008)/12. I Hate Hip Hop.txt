Hey you motherfucker
You rotten hiphop sucker
You call yourself a rapper
I call you wannabe

You talk 'bout pimps and bitches
You're having me in stitches
You talk about your rhyme skills
Ain't that ridiculous

I hate, I hate
I hate hip hop (hip hop)
you know what I mean
I hate trash pop (trash pop)
so stupid and clean
hip hop trash pop
I give a fuck
I'm the Hip Hop Hater
I need rock, rock

Hey bloody techno DJ
You're showing off the whole day
You think you're a musician
I call you wannabe
Your girl's boobs look fantastic
Everything is plastic
Your music is just playback
It's trashy, cheesy, cheap
