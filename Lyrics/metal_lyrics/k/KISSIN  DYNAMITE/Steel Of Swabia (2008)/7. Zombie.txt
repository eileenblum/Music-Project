Hey, wake up! I break up
When you throw sticky eyes to me
Hey fat neck! Please get back
To your hole, I don't wanna see
All these love bombs you drop into my face
All your love guns, I'll touch you in no case

Oh, you say that I'm too shy
Oh, your bad breath makes me cry

You're like a zombie (zombie)
Like a zombie to me
You're like a zombie (zombie)
Like a zombie to me
I wanna cry out â hey, spy out
Why can't you see
You're like a zombie (zombie)
Like a zombie to me

Hey, wake up! Please break up!
Yes you damn make me spit white foam
Hey fat neck! Please get back
To your nice old people's home
Though I'd sit a hundred years in jail
I will never fuck with an ancient whale

Oh, trust me I'm not shy
Oh, but your bad breath lets me cry
