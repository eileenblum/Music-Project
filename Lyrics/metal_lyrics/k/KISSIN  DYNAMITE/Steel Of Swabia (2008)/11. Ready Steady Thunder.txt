Were running wild â while we're waiting on the line
We live to ride â yeah, we'll fight against time
All eyes on me â see me speeding like a gun
Fast as a bullet
The race has just begun

Watch out...
I've got a heart of chrome
Watch out...I'm ready to explode
'cause gasoline is running
through my veins
And I am totally insane

Ready, steady, thunder! Ohohohoho
Ready, steady, thunder! Ohohohoho
We are speeding hunters Ohohohoho
Ready, steady, thunder! Ohoh

A cloud of dust â and a thousand smoking pipes
At twisting speed â of a thousand screaming bikes
A flock of steel â heading through the burning air
It's almost like â riding an electric chair

Ready, steady, thunder!
