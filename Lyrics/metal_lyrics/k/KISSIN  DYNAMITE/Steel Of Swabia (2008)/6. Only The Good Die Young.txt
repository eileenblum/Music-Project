I wanna burn â in any case
I live a dream of a rocking race
I'll never stop â how fast the game will go
I have to burn â bright like a star
I'll always drive the passing car

I'll never sleep â how long the race will go

Hey now, what we gonna do
Hey now, taste something new
I'll never rest â how far a game will go

Only the good die young
Living as a rebel â dying as a rebel
Only the good die young, you know

I've got a kiss â of speed'n'roll
I'll gain the race for my soul
I'll never stop â how fast the game will go
