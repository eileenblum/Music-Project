Your tears are runnin' â runnin' down like a waterfall
I'm sittin' here but â I don't know what you want at all
What did I tell you â tell me what have I done to you?
What happened to my girl?

You said âyour girlâ â your girl has to leave this place
Another tear is â running down through your beauty face

A very last kiss â shut my eyes but you shut the door
To leave me here behind â but girl just keep in mind

Out in the rain â where all the streets have no name
Out in the dark â you will be lost and apart
But if you run away with a desperate heart
You will stand alone again

Out in the rain
Will you never â ever â come back again

My eyes are starin' â straight ahead in an empty room
Somethin is tellin' â tellin' me that you'll come back soon
Knock on my door â find my way to your home again
I know you're missing me â but I don't want you to beâ¦
