You stand at the fry pan as every day
All you've been dreaming â it faded away
They took you all but they can't take your pride
We will break out in the night

You and me against the world
they can't stop us now
You and me against the world
We'll make it somehow
Come with me, we're free like the wind
breaking all the chains
It's you and me, you and me against the world

You are in a treadmill, it's like ball and chain
That stupid system â it makes you insane
Let's blow up the whole shit, we pack up, my friend
Go on a journey with no end
