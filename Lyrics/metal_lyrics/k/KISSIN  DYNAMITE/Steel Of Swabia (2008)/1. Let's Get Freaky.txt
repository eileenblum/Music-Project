Excitement overdose. 
Panic coast to coast
We bring a wave of madness
We bring a wave of row
Let your head explode

Hey out there â you better be aware
Here comes psycho-scare
Are you ready for the shock?

Let's get freaky â freaky, freaky, freaky
Let's get freaky â we go insane
Let's get freaky â freaky, freaky, freaky
Let's get freaky â give up your brain

Forget about the rules. 
The risk is our fuel
We bring a wave of madness
Let chaos be our tool
Burning down the school
