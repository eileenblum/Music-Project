I wanna take you on a ride
Walk on a tightrope through the night
Not just a dream, it's real oh yeah!
We walk ahead high in the air â walk over there!

Oh, my girl what we're doing â is more than just a game
Yes, whatever we're doing â we're shining like a flame
A never dying flame

You should lie for me if you wanna be my girl
You should cry for me if you wanna be my girl
hey, don't look down tonight
Cause I'll catch your fall â the best obsession of all
Would you lie for â would you cry for me
And tell me, would you die for me?

I'm gonna take you on a plane
We start a skyjack once again
But they won't catch us, trust in me
A moment for eternity â yes, you will see

Oh, my girl what we're doing
Like surfin' on the light
Yes whatever you're doing
You won't forget this night
Don't forget this night!
