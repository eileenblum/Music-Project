I got a sign from the god of rock'n'roll
I hear his voice when I'm caught down in a hole
My blood is screaming,
it's drumming through my veins
Only my amp could break all the fuckin' chains
Shut down your church â now it's judgement day
Shut down your church â let the guitar pray

My religion Is rock and roll
My religion will save my soul
My religion is rock and roll
My religion will save my soul

I feel the kiss from the queen of rock'n'roll
Run to the moon and back, out of control
My blood is boiling, it's blasting in my veins
Inside my head I feel diving aeroplanes
Shut down your church â now it's judgement day
Shut down your church â let the guitar pray
