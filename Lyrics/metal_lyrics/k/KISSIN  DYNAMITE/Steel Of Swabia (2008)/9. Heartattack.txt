She was sexy, almost evil, she was a devil in disguise
she ripped me off â I had to pay the price
Versace was her prayer and Prada was her creed
She hijacked all my credit cards to satisfy her needs

Achtung â I'm on a road to ruin
Achtung â she's got me by the balls
Achtung â I don't know what I'm doing
She's driving me insane

Oh my god I get a heart attack,
oh my god I get a heart attack

Gimmeda gimmeda gimmeda money back
Oh my god I get a heart attack

Of course she needed diamonds
of course she loved champagne
Her noble nose was stuck in pure cocaine

She ate me up with Gucci, she killed me with Chanel
She led her life in luxury â I had to pay the bill
