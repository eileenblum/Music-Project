I want it, I need it, so I'll make sure I seize it
My cross line will see it, crash bang
I always beat it
Cold booze and hot lovin'
Is what reloads my power
I'm sorry, dear darling
Already have my sights on you 
Close - up view

They call me ego-shooter 
I'm shooting for the thrill
I'm an ego-shooter 
The living overkill 
Like an ego-shooter 
Infinite fire mode 
Call me ego-shooter
'Till you are off the road
I'm an ego-shooter

New highscore, no fair play
My joystick moves the right way 
Babe, don't you believe me? 
Join in and play my mad game 
Next level, on reset
I want you maiden targets
I see you, you feel me
I'm sure you just want me to score
This means war
