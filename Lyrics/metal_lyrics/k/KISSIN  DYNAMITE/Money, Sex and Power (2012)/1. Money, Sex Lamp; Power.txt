I'm a moola junkie
Bucks run through my veins
Daily cash infusions
Dough is my cocaine

I'm a crook, I'm a fraud, I'm a cheater
In my tinted high end limousine
All the gread and the risk and the gamble
I'm a money made machine

[Bridge:]
The demon sleeps
In you and me
But he won't do
Forever

[Chorus:]
Do you like money, sex and power
The everlasting law
Money, sex and power
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more

Do you like money, sex and power
The never ending game
Money, sex and power
I'm insane, I'm insane, I'm insane

I'm a horny engine
Powered by the drive
Greed for satisfaction's
Keeping me alive

All the whores and the sluts and the bitches
With their chambers of twilight and sin
All the lust and the zest and temptation
Very well then, I give in

[Bridge:]
The demon sleeps
In you and me
But he won't do
Forever

[Chorus:]
Do you like money, sex and power
The everlasting law
Money, sex and power
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more

Do you like money, sex and power
The never ending game
Money, sex and power
I'm insane, I'm insane, I'm insane

[Bridge:]
The demon sleeps
In you and me
But he won't do
Forever

[Chorus:]
Do you like money, sex and power
The everlasting law
Money, sex and power
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more

Do you like money, sex and power
The never ending game
Money, sex and power
I'm insane, I'm insane, I'm insane
