Cold heart, black soul
I'm a nasty little guy
Vicious antic
'Cause I got the evil eye
I'm seeding the sleaze
And injecting the beast
As ever, forever, as ever, forever

Don't waste your time
This is the deal
I will debauch you, head over heels
But when I'm done, I end in smoke
As ever, forever, as ever, forever

The devil, he may care
So catch me if you dare

We are we are we are
Hot stuff
We are we are we are
Real tough
We are we are we are
Sleaze deluxe
Sleaze deluxe

We are we are we are
Great shit
We are we are we are
Steel gift
We are we are we are
Sleaze deluxe
Sleaze deluxe

Ohh...

Untamed, ill famed
Got a mind that's so obscene

Bare meat, sick deeds
Love 'em dirty, love them mean
I'm spawn of hell
And take you under as well
As ever, forever, as ever, forever

Just like a blitz, I'm striking in
I'm wicked spook
Spreading vice and sin
Before you see, I'm miles away
As ever, forever, as ever, forever
