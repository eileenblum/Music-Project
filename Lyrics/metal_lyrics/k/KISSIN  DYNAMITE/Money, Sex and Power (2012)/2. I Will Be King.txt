Hereby I'm declaring
You're my chosen one
Satisfy your highness
Hey, all along

You may be my jester
Amuse me every day
Woe you bore and pester
I'll hang you straightaway

[Chorus:]
I will be king
I will be king
I will be king
I'll rule forever
You're gonna be
Royal private property

I will be king
I will be king
I will be king
You're gonna be
Just a grateful
Slave for me

Hail Hail Hail to the king!
Hail Hail Hail to the king!
Hail Hail Hail to the king!

Hope your dungeon's comfy
Let out just to fight

Beasts are waiting hungry
Hey, what a sight

Sleazebag, please me faster
Blue blood flows so well
I'm your puppet master
My heaven is your hell

[Chorus 3x:]
I will be king
I will be king
I will be king
I'll rule forever
You're gonna be
Royal private property

I will be king
I will be king
I will be king
You're gonna be
Just a grateful
Slave for me

Hail Hail Hail to the king!
Hail Hail Hail to the king!
Hail Hail Hail to the king!
