Fell light, flashing in the night
Peoples of the world stand side by side
We'll have ourselves a final ball

Seals break, evil is awake
Get another drink while planets quake
Dance with the dead 'till skies will fall

[Bridge:]
And when stars will burst and mankind's been erased
Far far away we'll say, we seized each of our days

[Chorus:]
Operation Supernova
We will dance 'till the party's over
For the first time, for the last time
Now the day has come

Operation Supernova
Hold the line while the end comes closer
All the lovers, all the haters
'Till the work is done

Sky's clear, now the end is near
We just keep on groovin', waste no tear
All elements give what they got

Stars fall, collapse to the core
Putting in my favourite song once more
As wild winds blow me to the gods

[Bridge:]
And when stars will burst and mankind's been erased
Far far away we'll say, we seized each of our days

[Chorus:]
Operation Supernova
We will dance 'till the party's over
For the first time, for the last time
Now the day has come

Operation Supernova
Hold the line while the end comes closer
All the lovers, all the haters
'Till the work is done

Ohh...

[Chorus:]
Operation Supernova
We will dance 'till the party's over
For the first time, for the last time
Now the day has come

Operation Supernova
Hold the line while the end comes closer
All the lovers, all the haters
'Till the work is done
