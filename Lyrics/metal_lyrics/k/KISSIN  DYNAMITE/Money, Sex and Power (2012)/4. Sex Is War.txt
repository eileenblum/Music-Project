Heads up
My bomb is on the way
She loves to be my lighter

This time
I blow her right away
Tonight she's my igniter

I'm a mean war machine
And my weapon is obscene
It's known as strongest fighter

Need no red light to thrill
No explosion overkill
My light's still shining brighter

[Chorus:]
Ohhh
Are you crying for more
Can't wait to fight the battle
Because sex is war

Ohhh
Are you crying for more
Sex is war
Sex is war
Sex is war

Blood boils
My flame begins to rise
The fuse is getting shorter

Can't stop
She goes off in the skies
All night I find no quarter

She's narcotic for my mind
Makes me deaf, makes me blind
She causes sweet delusions

As the countdown resounds
All the walls are shaking 'round
We bang in great profusion

[Chorus 2x:]
Ohhh
Are you crying for more
Can't wait to fight the battle
Because sex is war

Ohhh
Are you crying for more
Sex is war
Sex is war
Sex is war
