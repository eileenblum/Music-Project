Scratch me - bite me - kill me

Still on the loose, no excuse
She blacks out the daylight
Caught in her squeeze, cannot breathe
When she holds me real tight
Sly evil eyes, suck me dry
Walking on the wild side
Hell, what a treat, head to feet
When she fights at first flight

Scream shout - knocked out
Still she wants more

She's a killer killer killer
She's after me tonight
She's a killer killer killer
She's eating me alive
With her wild and hungry roar
She is screaming out for more
She's a killer killer killer

One's not enough, never stop
She's aiming higher

Roaming the streets with her cat eyes
As bright as fire
Claws made to fight, gonna spike me
I can't defy her
Led by the thrill of a kill
There's a beast inside her

Scratch me - bite me - kill me

Scratch me - bite me - kill me

She's a killer killer killer
