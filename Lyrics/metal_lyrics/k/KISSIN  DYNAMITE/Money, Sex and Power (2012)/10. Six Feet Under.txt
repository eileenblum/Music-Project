It feels good here, six feet under
And I still wait and wonder
How could I stay there all the time

In my grave itÂ´s warm and cozy
ItÂ´s safe, no one disturbs me
I feel fine until the end of time

IÂ´ve got some sad girls some bitches crying
Some pour souls more that are whining
Six shots in the back thanks for the attack

It feels good, it feels fine, this place is mine
This place is what I find itÂ´s all mine
ItÂ´s my home, IÂ´m alone, no one controls
This place is six feet under, six feet under

In some nights I think of lifetime
Sunlight and how the Stars shine
Bit by bit I forget Â´bout it

But I guess IÂ´m feeling happy
Unstressed and sometimes sappy
On my own here on my wooden thone

IÂ´ve got some sad girls some bitches crying
Some pour souls more that are whining
Six shots in the back thanks for the attack

It feels good, it feels fine, this place is mine
This place is what I find itÂ´s all mine
ItÂ´s my home, IÂ´m alone, no one controls
This place is six feet under, six feet under

It feels good, it feels fine, this place is mine
This place is what I find itÂ´s all mine
ItÂ´s my home, IÂ´m alone, no one controls
This place is six feet under, six feet under
