[Limited Digipak Bonus Track]Had a lot of guests here
A lot of flesh to chop
Each with a special flavour
And each with neck and crop

Welcome, just step inside
My meat machinery
Don't be scared 'cause fear tastes bad to me

[Chorus 2x:]
My name is Hannibal
Hannibal the cannibal
My name is Hannibal
and I want you

Let me pay your dinner
Look so frail and weak
Dude, just use a service
Cause I want juicy meat

Now we come together
on my barbecue
Hot and spicy
Main course
That is you

[Chorus 2x:]
My name is Hannibal
Hannibal the cannibal
My name is Hannibal
and I want you

[4x:]
I'm ticking like a ticking like a ticking
like a time bomb
ticking like a ticking lika a ticking
like a bomb

[Chorus 2x:]
My name is Hannibal
Hannibal the cannibal
My name is Hannibal
and I want you

My name is Hannibal
