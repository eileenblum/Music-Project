[Chorus:]
Forever 27
That's the age we gonna die
Let's crank it up in heaven
We'll make the angels cry
Forever 27
Next stop will be the last
Come on, Jimi
Beam me up
Welcome to the club

[Verse:]
Died too young for being wise
Assigned just at the peak
Preserved right in the prime of life
Immortal our mystique

Too old to be marionettes
Gave bosses hell
All times one listens to the wind
Still hears our rebel yell

[Bridge:]
We need to rock
We never stop
We hit the spot
We're just on the top

[Chorus:]
Forever 27
That's the age we gonna die
Let's crank it up in heaven
We'll make the angels cry
Forever 27
Next stop will be the last
Come on, Jimi
Beam me up
Welcome to the club

Still we rock the other world
Drink whiskey, smoke cigars
A crowd of souls is calling us
Fuck harps, we've got guitars

Steal the angel's innocence
Displace the gods
After show forevermore
This party never stops

[Bridge:]
We need to rock
We never stop
We hit the spot
We're just on the top

[Chorus 2x:]
Forever 27
That's the age we gonna die
Let's crank it up in heaven
We'll make the angels cry
Forever 27
Next stop will be the last
Come on, Jimi
Beam me up
Welcome to the club
