When stillness and desert once covered the land
When Rock was a dark horse, no Roll was on hand
A brand new species world conquer the place
Shocked, rocked, shook the musical base
Where one has been stillness, now ear splitting sounds
The hell bells are ringing, kickstarted hearts pound
In rivers through wastelands adrenalin flows
Moves, thrills, hits my body and soul

[Chorus:]
Dinosaurs are still alive
Dinosaurs, they will survive
Please my mind and make me jive
Dinosaurs are still alive, yeah...

The world was besotted with glorious noise
Paradise cities and attics with toys
This flush made them lose all their fear of the dark
Killed their pain, as fast as a shark
But even the keenest of heroes will fade
The mission is done but it's only their shape
Their legacy's saved and the spirit will last
Gods of Rock, a singular class

[Chorus:]
Dinosaurs are still alive
Dinosaurs, they will survive
Please my mind and make me jive
Dinosaurs are still alive, yeah...
