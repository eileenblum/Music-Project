Shadow and light
Playing games in my mind
I just want you to please me
Come on hunt me down
If you want me to stay
It's like dead or alive

[Bridge:]
We are wasting away
We are burning alive
We both know it's a game that we play
On the wings of the night
Between dark sheets we're feeling alive

[Chorus:]
Killing with love, we are assassins of pleasure
Killing with love, we are assassins of lust
A heart made of stone
That cuts to the bone
We are assassins of love
We live on the edge
Between life and death
Killing with love

See me explode
It's like pleasure and pain
Cause inside I am burning
It's after dark
And we're glowing like stars
There ain't no place to hide
