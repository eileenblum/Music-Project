You broke my dreams, I went insane
You stole my thoughts, you fucked my brain
All night long, all night long.

You drank my blood, my veins ran dry
You made my hell, I had to die
All night long, all night long.

[Bridge:]
Payback â each attack builds up my force
Payback â I revenge without remorse

[Refrain:]
You better run, run, run for your life
You better run away.
Run, run, run for your life
It's time for you to pay
It's time for judgement day.

I have endured the pain too long
You gave your best but I was strong
All night long, all night long.

The tide has turned, I'm hunting for you
I wish you pain, It's overdue
All night long, all night long.
