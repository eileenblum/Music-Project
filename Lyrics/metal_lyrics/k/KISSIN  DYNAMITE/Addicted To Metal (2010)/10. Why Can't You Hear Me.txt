Our souls were kindred twins
Like an eagle spreads his wings
Each of us damned to the core
Alone
Then this day made earth to hell
The day my pride began to swell
I condemn this time to death
Forever

[Bridge:]
This aching loss erodes my brain
How long can I endure this pain?

[Refrain:]
Why can't you hear me?
Can't you hear my cry?
I stand alone here and
I'm afraid to die
Why can't you hear me?
Can't you hear my cry?
Can't you hear me
Can't you hear me
Can't you hearâ¦my cry

The Angel on my shoulder won
But the devil ruled too long
Trying to undo my faults
For years
You were the victim, now it's me
But now I realize and see
That there will be no return
To old times

[Bridge:]
This aching loss erodes my brain
How long can I endure this pain?

[Refrain:]
Why can't you hear me?
Can't you hear my cry?
I stand alone here and
I'm afraid to die
Why can't you hear me?
Can't you hear my cry?
Can't you hear me
Can't you hear me
Can't you hearâ¦my cry
