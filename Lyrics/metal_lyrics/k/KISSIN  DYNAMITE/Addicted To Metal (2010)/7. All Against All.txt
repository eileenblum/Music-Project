Destiny promised a hero
A prophet whose vision is pure
Under the false guise of seven
He lead them to famine and war

[Bridge:]
Oh oh
Angels and kings we'll be too
Oh oh
Follow the grid to the truth

[Refrain:]
Born to kill, born to die
In holy war
Aiming high, shooting low,
All against all
Born to kill, born to die
Sound the war call
Head 'em up, here we go
All against all

Riding shotgun at zero
All of you legend and whore
A chorus of puppets in rapture
Caught up in a shadowy storm

[Bridge:]
Oh oh
Angels and kings we'll be too
Oh oh
Follow the grid to the truth

[Refrain:]
Born to kill, born to die
In holy war
Aiming high, shooting low,
All against all
Born to kill, born to die
Sound the war call
Head 'em up, here we go
All against all
