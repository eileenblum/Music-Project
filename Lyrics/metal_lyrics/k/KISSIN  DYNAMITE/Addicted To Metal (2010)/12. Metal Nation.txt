Metal knows no borders
Over land and over sea
It removes the order
âCause metalheads are free

Everyone around us
Shall feel the pounding force
That lets your head bang harder
Merciless and coarse

[Bridge:]
Deep inside my soul
Now I loose control
Hear the metal howl

We meet at holy places
To hail the chosen ones
Watch the different faces
From everywhere they've come

The metalgod himself
Is present on this day
Oh lord, retain this moment
âCause metal shall prevail

[Chorus:]
We are one
Metal nation
Worldwide
On of a kind
We are one
Metal nation
Our soul
Is rock'n' roll

One tribe
One clan
One kind
Worldwide
We are one
Metal nation
