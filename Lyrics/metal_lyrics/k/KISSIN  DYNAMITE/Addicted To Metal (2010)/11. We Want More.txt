Waking up hung over
Driving endless ways
On and on forever
No idea of time and place

Keep the madness going
To hell and back we ride
The grass is always greener
On the other side

[Bridge:]
We've licked the blood, there's no doubt anymore
We've licked the blood, to win this crazy war

[Ref.:]
We want more â more, more, more
Rock n Roll as destination
âTil we die
We want more â more, more, more
To receive complete salvation
âTil we die â We want more

Disaffected faces
Driving you insane
Have no clue âbout nothing
This way is full of pain

Harder, faster, louder
We're always on the run
Occupied completely
This game has just begun

[Bridge:]
We've licked the blood, there's no doubt anymore
We've licked the blood, to win this crazy war

[Ref.:]
We want more â more, more, more
Rock n Roll as destination
âTil we die
We want more â more, more, more
To receive complete salvation
âTil we die â We want more
