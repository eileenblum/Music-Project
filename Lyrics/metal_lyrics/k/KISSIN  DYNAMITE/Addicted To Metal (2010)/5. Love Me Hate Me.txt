I'm on my way
Thunderstruck I ride
Here and today
So better step aside
Change me, derange me
There's no point in that
I'm âbout to stay
Nothing left to add

Earthquaking speed
Always aiming high
Ready to bleed
I want to touch the sky
Ban me, scan me
Shout it out aloud
A fat lot I care
Fucker, check it out

[Ref.:]
Love me hate me
Even try to break me
I'm standing tight, just like a rock
Love me hate me
Even try to break me
I (don't) give a damn
It's dog eat dog
