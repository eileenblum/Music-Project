I give myself a shock, feel the power in my brain
The voltage keeps on rising yes metal is my game
We push it to the edge, breaking bones n' bursting veins
We only get the vibe at the borderline of pain

It sets my teeth on edge, hear the hammering guitar
Adrenalin explodes, fulminating as we are
That metal all alone brings the force we need to play
Watch out âcause hell for leather, we'll blow the place away

[Refrain:]
We are addicted to metal
We are addicted to Steel
We are addicted to metal
Forever, we keep it real

We are we are, we are metal
We are we are, we are Steel
We are we are, we are metal
Forever, we keep it real
Forever, we're addicted to Steel
