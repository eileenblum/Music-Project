[Written by Tommy Shaw, Jack Blades, Ted Nugent]

I don't wanna hear about it anymore
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore
There's a fire in my heart
A pounding in my brain
It's driving me crazy

We don't need to talk about it anymore
Yesterday's just a memory
Can we close the door
I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say when you called me baby

[Bridge:]
Don't say goodnight
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh oh Oh, all the way

Refrain
Can you take me high enough
To fly me over yesterday
Can you take me high enough
It's never over
Yesterday's just a memory

I don't want to live without you anymore
Can't you see I'm in misery
And you know for sure
I would live and die for you
And I'd know just what to do when you call me baby

[Refrain:]
Can you take me high enough
Can you fly me over yesterday
Can you take me high enough
It's never over
Yesterday's just a memory,
I'm running
I was running for the door
The next thing I remember
I was running back for more
Yeah...
