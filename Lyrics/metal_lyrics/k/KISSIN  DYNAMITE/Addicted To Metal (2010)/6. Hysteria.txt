Call me Mr Sin
Hell ends where I begin
God hangs between my legs

You all scream for more
You pussy's in a roar
Hey I'll drive you insane

You know my reputation
Feel your dedication
Comeon, sing in a choir

[Refrain:]
Hysteria, hysteria
you'll praise my godhead whereever you are 
Hysteria, hysteria
And I'll fullfill simply all your desire

Serve my golden key
With your gates of destiny
Oh let God rise up high

G-spot rock n roll
I control your libido
I'm the climax of all
