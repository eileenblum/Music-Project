He spreads fear and terror
He was never ever seen
The phantom killer's clever
Unpredictable and mean

Master of disaster
You are in his demon eyes
You can run but he is faster
You can hide but he is sly

Fingers made of razors
Mystic twinkle in the shade
With his supersonic laser
And his heavy metal blades

Dashing through the nightlife
Flying high to shoot you down
Is what the super killer likes
As he starts another round

[Bridge:]
Sooner or later
He will come to start the fight
Speeding and wheeling
In the night

[Refrain:]
He's a super â sonic- super sonic killer
Super Sonic â killer
