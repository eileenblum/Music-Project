[Intro]
At all times, forever
My mindset's been defined
For justice and freedom
I leave all things behind
If you don't respect me
Then you can kiss my ass
For justice and freedom
I raise my iron fist

I'm proud
I'm free
As hard as knights can be
I kill
This sleaze
With the impure-heart-disease
There is no battle I would loose
I'm fearless and I'm true
They're weak
I'm keen
Vendettas are routine

[Bridge:]
Step back cause here I go
I fight for those living low

The laws
Don't care
Regulations everywhere
I take
The right
To invent my own tonight
I am the only one to be
I'm fearless and I'm true
For that
I'll strive
The spirit shall survive

[Bridge:]
Step back cause here I go
I fight for those living low

At all times, forever
My aims are still the same
For justice and freedom
It burns, the Swabian flame
If you don't respect me
Then you can kiss my ass
For justice and freedom
We proudly beat our breast
