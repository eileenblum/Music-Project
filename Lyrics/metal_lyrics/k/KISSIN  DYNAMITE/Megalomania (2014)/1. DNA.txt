I'm a bad bad boy
And I go for your toys
Yeah Yeah Yeah

Because your long long legs
Get me high to the max
Yeah Yeah Yeah

Ram your claws in my flesh
Bang my head on the ground
Suck me dry if you please
You can do what you want

I'm a mad mad fool
Babe, I'm coming for you
Yeah Yeah Yeah

It's in your DNA
This is our DNA
We gotta do our dirty duty,baby,right away

It's in our DNA
This is our DNA
Another round, another pleasure every night and day

We roam about in the street
Just running after our feet
Aiming high
Shooting low
Satisfying our needs

It's in our DNA
This is our DNA
We gotta do our dirty duty,baby,right away

Got my big big balls
Baby,balls to the wall
Yeah Yeah Yeah

With you swing swing groove
You just know how to move
Yeah Yeah Yeah

Come and eat me alive
It doesn't matter at all
No, I couldn't care less
If I ride for the fall

Love your sweet sweet roar
Gonna come back for more
Yeah Yeah Yeah

It's in our DNA
This is our DNA
We gotta do our dirty duty,baby,right away

It's in our DNA
This is our DNA
Another round, another pleasure every night and day

We roam about in the street
Just running after our feet
Aiming high
Shooting low
Satisfying our needs

It's in our DNA
This is our DNA
We gotta do our dirty duty,baby,right away

YEAH YEAH YEAH

YEAH YEAH YEAH

It's in our DNA
This is our DNA
We gotta do our dirty duty,baby,right away

It's in our DNA
This is our DNA
Another round, another pleasure every night and day

We roam about in the street
Just running after our feet
Aiming high
Shooting low
Satisfying our needs

It's in our DNA
This is our DNA
We gotta do our dirty duty,baby,right away
