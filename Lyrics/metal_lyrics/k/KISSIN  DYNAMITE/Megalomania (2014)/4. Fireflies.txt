As I wander the streets
Empty faces I meet
Turning up, going by,
My, oh, my

At the end of the day
I cannot remember

Lives are painted in blue
Every day in the same view
Like a rainy July
My, oh, my

Deep inside I desire
Sunlight in December

Hello, world
This is me
On my way to far horizons
And I feel
There's a brand-new start tonight

Hello, world
This is me
On a never-ending journey
Look around
Guiding lights light up the skies
Fireflies
Fireflies

In mysterious ways
From an alien space
Many thousands I see
Wild and free

Just a blink of an eye
Feels like it's forever

Just a magical hush
'til the everyday rush
Makes a colorful day
Fade to grey

As the radiant sparks
Fall into the never

Hello, world
This is me
On my way to far horizons
And I feel
There's a brand-new start tonight

Hello, world
This is me
On a never-ending journey
Look around
Guiding lights light up the skies
Fireflies
Fireflies

Hello, world
This is me
On my way to far horizons
And I feel
There's a brand-new start tonight

Hello, world
This is me
On a never-ending journey
Look around
Guiding lights light up the skies
Fireflies
Fireflies
