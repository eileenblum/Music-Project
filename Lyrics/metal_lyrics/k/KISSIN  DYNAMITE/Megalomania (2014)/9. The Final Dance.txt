Close together
Nothing mattered
Only you and me and air and love
Yeah we dreamed of taking on the world

We were finding
Silver linings
In ourselves and God, how could we know
One of these days, our dreams would hurt?

Let me fly
Let me fly
I have learned to live without you by my side

Let me fly
Let me fly
May I only have this final dance tonight

Lying by you
Cannot break through
Try to read in your unseeing eyes
There's a body, but I miss your soul

Cannot grasp you
As I ask you
If you're gonna be alright tonight
All you say is that you wouldn't know

Let me fly
Let me fly
I have learned to live without you by my side

Let me fly
Let me fly
May I only have this final dance tonight

Like an illness
Empty stillness
Slowly creeped inside our weakened hearts
As it seems there's nothing left to say

Live your own life
Be a good wife
To the one that brings you peace of mind
'Cause tomorrow is a better day

Let me fly
Let me fly
I have learned to live without you by my side

Let me fly
Let me fly
May I only have this final dance tonight
