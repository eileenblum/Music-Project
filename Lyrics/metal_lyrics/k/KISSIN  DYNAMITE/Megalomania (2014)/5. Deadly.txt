I should have known better
By the devil in your eyes
I should have known better
That faithful night
I should have been stronger
I told you
Hey
you
Get out of my life
Get out of my life

Deadly
From the moment I touched you
From the minute I let you in
I was buried alive
Deadly
Like the poison on your lips
I'm going down

You couldn't look colder
As you set my life on fire
You shouldn't get closer
I die

Deadly
From the moment I touched you
From the minute I let you in
I was buried alive
Deadly
Like the poison on your lips
Your love is deadly
Your love is deadly

Now I follow you
Like a new age religion
Swallowed up
By your x-max vision
I can't fight off this
Vicious addiction
You're so deadly

Deadly
From the moment I touched you
From the minute I let you in
I was buried alive
Deadly
Like the poison on your lips
Your love is deadly
Your love is deadly
Your love is deadly
Your love is deadly
