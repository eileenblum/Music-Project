I hear you wondering weather youÂ´re dead or alive
I taste the salt of every tear in your eyes
I feel your spirit suffering from a disease
I see you, down on your knees

DonÂ´t hang your head down, this is the voice from inside
No need for sorrow, dude, it is all in your mind
You long for fortune? Hey, what about a quick prayer?
Call me in any old affair

Hear me, hear me when your eyes go blind
Feel me, feel me when youÂ´re losing your mind
IÂ´m the truth inside your dÃ©ja vu
None and all is me surrounding you
IÂ´m the key to all your dreams come true
Pray to me, IÂ´m the God in you

I am your savior, your supernatural guide
Your magic mojo, not ever leaving your side
Your private heaven, living in each of your cells
So donÂ´t you take me for hell

DonÂ´t be a fool Â´cause only a fool goes astray
YouÂ´r run in circles, better believe what I say
YouÂ´re born in my world, youÂ´regonna die here, my dere
Trust me, your motherland is here

Hear me, hear me when your eyes go blind
Feel me, feel me when youÂ´re losing your mind
IÂ´m the truth inside your dÃ©ja vu
None and all is me surrounding you
IÂ´m the key to all your dreams come true
Pray to me, IÂ´m the God in you

IÂ´m the God in you

Hear me, hear me when your eyes go blind
Feel me, feel me when youÂ´re losing your mind
IÂ´m the truth inside your dÃ©ja vu
None and all is me surrounding you
IÂ´m the key to all your dreams come true
Pray to me, IÂ´m the God in you
