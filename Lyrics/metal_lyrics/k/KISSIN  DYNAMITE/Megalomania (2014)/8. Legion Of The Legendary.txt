This is me
Me and my legion of the legendary
And we came to win

We're at the end of time
The Last of our kind
The world on deadlock
This ship is high and dry
We're gonna hide away
We're waiting for the day

Oblivion's all around
We live at the speed of sound
Inside this neverland we're
Getting out now to break new ground
We're walking on broken glass
All covered with virgin grass

This is me
Me and my legion of the legendary
And we came to win
Me
Me and my legion of the legendary
Yeah we're marching in

Me
Me and my legion of the legendary
And we came to win
Me
Me and my legion of the legendary
Yeah we're marching in

We came to heed the call
'Cause we are one for all
We're all for one, yes
Still, we are standing tall
Heaven's about to rain
The Gods will know our name

We shine in another light
Look into another sky
We're gonna conquer the lost
Paradise lying open wide
It's our legacy
'Cause we're the ones to be

This is me
Me and my legion of the legendary
And we came to win
Me
Me and my legion of the legendary
Yeah we're marching in

Me
Me and my legion of the legendary
And we came to win
Me
Me and my legion of the legendary
Yeah we're marching in

We have been the last
Of a universe in shatters
We will be the first
It is now or never
Me
Me and my legion of the legendary

This is me
Me and my legion of the legendary
And we came to win
Me
Me and my legion of the legendary
Yeah we're marching in

Me
Me and my legion of the legendary
And we came to win
Me
Me and my legion of the legendary
Yeah we're marching in

We have been the last
Of a universe in shatters
We will be the first
It is now or never
Me
Me and my legion of the legendary
