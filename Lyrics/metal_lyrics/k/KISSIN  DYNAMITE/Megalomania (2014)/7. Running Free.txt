The time is right
The spot is sweet
I sniff the change

No fool around
No compromise
No song and dance

I need to free
The monster-me
ItÂ´s hard to kill

IÂ´ve got the guts
IÂ´ve got the the balls
IÂ´ve got the will

Yeah-You canÂ´t catch me
Yeah-Long gone I laugh and go for another round

Hey - IÂ´m running free
Gotta break away
Gonna make my day
Â´Till I cease to be

Hey â IÂ´m running free
Spinning Â´round and Â´round
Never losing ground
Life is up to me

IÂ´m running free
By land and sea
Nobody knows
IÂ´m running free

I mocked the deuce?
And shrinked away
Againts the odds

In holy halls
I wine and dined
With kings and Gods

I tempted Sirens
Looked into
MedusaÂ´s eyes

I am a phantom
Daily changing
My disguise

Yeah â You canÂ´t catch me
Yeah â Long gone I laugh and go for another round

Hey - IÂ´m running free
Gotta break away
Gonna make my day
Â´Till I cease to be

Hey â IÂ´m running free
Spinning Â´round and Â´round
Never losing ground
Life is up to me

IÂ´m running free
By land and sea
Nobody knows
IÂ´m running free

Hey - IÂ´m running free
Gotta break away
Gonna make my day
Â´Till I cease to be

Hey â IÂ´m running free
Spinning Â´round and Â´round
Never losing ground
Life is up to me

Hey - IÂ´m running free
Gotta break away
Gonna make my day
Â´Till I cease to be

Hey â IÂ´m running free
Spinning Â´round and Â´round
Never losing ground
Life is up to me

IÂ´m running free
By land and sea
Nobody knows
IÂ´m running free
