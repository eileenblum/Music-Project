May I ask for a dance
Ditch your mind, take a chance, yeah
'Cause where demons play and angels fall
You'll be right for the Maniac Ball

Big entertainer
Smooth operator
So many names I call my own

My celebrations,
Famous sensations
In glitterati widely known

The lights go out
The curtain falls
Welcome inside my unholy halls

May I ask for a dance
Ditch your mind, take a chance, yeah
'Cause where demons play and angels fall
You'll be right for the Maniac Ball

Champagne in showers
Pleasures for hours
Those greedy gluttons go too far

These souls I've eaten
Flavoured and sweetened
My every bit of caviar

The lights go out
The curtain falls
Welcome inside my unholy halls

May I ask for a dance
Ditch your mind, take a chance, yeah
'Cause where demons play and angels fall
You'll be right for the Maniac Ball

May I ask for a dance
Ditch your mind, take a chance, yeah
'Cause where demons play and angels fall
You'll be right

May I ask for a dance
Ditch your mind, take a chance, yeah
'Cause where demons play and angels fall
You'll be right for the Maniac Ball
