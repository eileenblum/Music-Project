For the great and bitter
For the strong, so weak
For the heavy hitters
Playing hide and seek

For the rich man living
With a frozen soul
See the poor man dying
With a heart of gold
With a heart of gold

ThereÂ´s a chance to come
DonÂ´t miss your one way ticket to paradise
Ticket to paradise
Let it lead your way

Settle in the sun
Go get your one way ticket to paradise
Ticket to paradise
Every single day

ItÂ´s right here
ItÂ´s right now
Let it lead your way

ItÂ´s right here
ItÂ´s right now
Every single day

For the tragic heroes
For the number-ones
Set it back to zero
You cannot be wrong

For the sunshine squealers
For you talk in vain
Hear the wise man singing
In the pouring rain
In the pouring rain

ThereÂ´s a chance to come
DonÂ´t miss your one way ticket to paradise
Ticket to paradise
Let it lead your way

Settle in the sun
Go get your one way ticket to paradise
Ticket to paradise
Every single day

ItÂ´s right here
ItÂ´s right now
Let it lead your way

ItÂ´s right here
ItÂ´s right now
Every single day

ThereÂ´s a chance to come
DonÂ´t miss your one way ticket to paradise
Ticket to paradise
Let it lead your way

Settle in the sun
Go get your one way ticket to paradise
Ticket to paradise
Every single day

ThereÂ´s a chance to come
DonÂ´t miss your one way ticket to paradise
Ticket to paradise
Let it lead your way

Settle in the sun
Go get your one way ticket to paradise
Ticket to paradise
Every single day

ItÂ´s right here
ItÂ´s right now
Let it lead your way
Let it lead your way
ItÂ´s right here
ItÂ´s right now
Every single day
