We live in a nighttime world
We dwell in the ashes of the dark, of the dark

We've been burnt by the flame
Soaked, in acid rain
Forgotten, who's to blame?
Will the sun rise?

Our world is on fire tonight
Our world burns in flames tomorrow
Lest we stand together and fight
We are but servants of sorrow

Would you still remember my name
After the fall?

On your weary face
I see the world's intolerable pain, in vain

We are the cure
We are the war cry that echoes through eternity

Our world is on fire tonight
Our world burns in flames tomorrow
Lest we stand together and fight
We are but servants of sorrow

Would you still remember my name
After the fall?

Deeper and deeper into the night
The solace of shadows kills the light
Darker and darker grows the night
The solace of shadows lights up the night

Out of the shadow world
The realm of the night
Through mist and shadows
Into the light

Out of the shadow world
The realm of the night
Through mist and shadows
Into the light

The world's intolerable pain
The world's intolerable pain
The world's intolerable pain on your face

Our world is on fire tonight
Our world burns in flames tomorrow
Lest we stand together and fight
We are but servants of sorrow

Our world is on fire tonight
Our world burns in flames tomorrow
Lest we stand together and fight
We are but servants of sorrow

Servants of sorrow
Servants of sorrow
