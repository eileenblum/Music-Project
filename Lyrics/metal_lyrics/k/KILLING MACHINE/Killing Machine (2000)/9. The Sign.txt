Watching the world slip away, slowly into an abyss
I've seen the horror each day, one more deadly kiss
Riding the storm out again in My mind
How can we all be so blind

The sign, the warning we fear, watch for it, watch for it

Lining the streets with their plague, eternally suffering
Burning their souls with the hate, eternal flames

Hiding the rage that is bulging inside
Knowing there's nowhere to hide

The sign, the warning we fear, watch for it, watch for it
In time embrace the voices we hear, watch for, watch for the sign

Sinking, preparing yourself for war
Fighting until you can't take anymore

Nowhere to turn, what did we learn in our madness
What did we find, ignoring the signs, only sadness why

The sign

Where can you turn, what can you do
Inside you're dying, I'm running through your veins
