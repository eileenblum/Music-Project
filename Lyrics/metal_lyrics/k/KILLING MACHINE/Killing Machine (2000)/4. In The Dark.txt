Taking your chances and playing with fire
Your destiny left in your hands
Confusion in your mind tears you apart
Folding to heartless demands

I wait in the dark, I'm under your skin
Inside yourself the torture begins

Tonight, won't ever end
Despite your will to defend

Just like a puppet hung from a wire
Censoring your every move
Feeling the evil, fear in your heart
Nothing left that you can do

I wait in the dark, behind every corner
Killing yourself, time's taking its toll
