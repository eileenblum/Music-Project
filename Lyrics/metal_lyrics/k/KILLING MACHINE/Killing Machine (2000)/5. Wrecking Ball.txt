Hit me, I want you
Try me, I dare you

I don't give a damn, why should I care
Destroying everything I see
Swinging down, dismantle brick by brick
The job gets done I guarantee

I don't bleed, methodically crushing you
I don't need a thing but pain

I'm a wrecking ball
Destroying all

Watch me. I'm in you

On a deadly mission of my own
Levelling, cutting you down

I won't sleep, I won't rest a minute
Until the job is done. I need pain

Taking all
