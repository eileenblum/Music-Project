Cries of denial, raves of a madman
Poisoning innocent minds
Living a lie, nothing but madness
Leaving the sentenced behind

No mercy is given just taken away
Killing then bleeding it dry
Understanding for no one, ignoring their desperate cries
Time is the evil just ticking away
Day after day in this hell

No more time to waste
No more dreams to chase

Now this vicious circle, eating you alive
It goes on and on and on
Just look in the mirror it blood you thrive
On and on and on and on

Pray for your souls, prey on the madman
Casting all mercy aside
It's kill or die, nothing to reason
Fight you can survive

Waiting for vengeance, counting the seconds
Fear of this hell as it crawls up your spine
