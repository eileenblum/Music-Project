Tell me what is ticking in your head
Are all thoughts you've bled
Taking control
In your eyes I see a certain fear
Confusion everywhere
Taking its toll

This hole you're falling in never ends
You scream with all your will and no one hears

No way out

No matter where you tern there's no way out

Clouded memories filling up your mind
In fear of what you'll find
When you awake
On the edge of no reality
Not knowing what to believe
You start to break

This hole you've fallen in never ends
You scream and no one hears you

No way out
Black hole of no return there's no way out

Not one shred
