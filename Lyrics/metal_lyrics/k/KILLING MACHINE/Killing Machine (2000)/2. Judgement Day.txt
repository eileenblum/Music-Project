Sign of the coming, sign of the cross
Judgement for heartless thieves
Stand and be counted, nowhere to turn
How could you be so naive

You knew this day would come
Believe me, you're not the only one

Judgement day

Sins unforgiven, say what you will
Nothing can save you now
The trust you were given, is dust in the wind
Only so much can be allowed

Time after time
You crossed the line, ignored the sign
You lived a fool
What did you learn, where can you turn
Nowhere to hide
