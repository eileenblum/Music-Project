Giving you a chance as we're holding out our hands, an offering you can't defy
Following no rules, deadly fire that it fuels, electrified
Living for the night, the flames that we ignite, just waiting now to strike the fuse
It's ready to explode, can you feel the power grow, there's no way to lose

Trust me I have what you need
Just believe me

It's in your face, your fears erased
We're in your face
Showing you the way, to get through another day, living with no sacrifice
Can you feel the fire, it's feeding your desire, paying no price
Feel the thunder in your heart, your body starts, it starts to shake
Your hunger now it feeds everything you need, with no rules to break
Trust me, I have what you want
