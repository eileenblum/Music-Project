I'm bad, no good
I'm misunderstood
Just one haunting page from this book
I'm in your head
The fears that you dread
Are real and there's no turning back

Slipping in, are you dreaming
One more breath, then it's done your soul is mine
Killer
I'm a Killing Machine
Killer, engines pumping
In the Killing Machine

No pain, no love
I'm craving your blood
Every inch of your life I'll devour
You're part of me
Now you've got the disease
Stronger it grows, feel the power

Slipping in, you're not dreaming
No more time, now it's done your soul is mine

Watch yourself, there's no hope in the Killing Machine
Pistons pumping
