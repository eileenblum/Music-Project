Gazing into night, forces of one unite to make a stand
The time has come
In a frenzied mess, the few and chosen and blessed

Will rise, rise up, defend, fighting 'til the end
To live another day, our way or die

Stand and fight, make it right
Stand and fight

Madness sucking in, all our ugly sins enraging within
The time is here
In a fiery blaze, to hell we send the face of evil

Into the darkness, facing our fears
Riding into unknown frontiers
