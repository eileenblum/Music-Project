Tearin' down the walls, taking what we can
The ecstasy of each and every man
Inside you feel the power, the lust that we devour
Delving in the realm of no mans land

No dealing
No mercy
All hell's breakin' loose
Unleashing Our venom
All hells breakin' loose

Feel the ground it's shaking, the powers that will be
Won't ever be mistaken, it's here to set us free
Turn it upside down, turnin' inside out
Leaving devastation, and never leaving doubt

No dealing
No Mercy
All hell's breakin' loose
Unleashing
Our venom
All hells breakin' loose

Infernal, eternal flames
Lighting the way
Unfeeling, revealing
Forsaking the day
