Their sacrifice we praise tonight
The hours come to rejoice
Our chant is heard around the world
Speaking out hear our voice
Join the revolution we'll take command
Taking course evolution the times finally at hand

Raise your head and see the break of dawn
Raise your fist march on and on and on
Praise the final day come kneel and pray
Praise the final day
Praise the final day let's hear you say
Praise the final day

From the ash we raise again
Raise your glasses solute
To the day of reckoning
Those who parish refuse
See the light and praise the day
Watch them fall, dominions see them slowly decay
Praise the final day
Praise the final day
