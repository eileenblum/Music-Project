Waited through the centuriesto make the final stand
Wiping out the enemy bless the holy land
The hour strikes, attack begins
Blood begins to flow
Thrusting force will destroy
Feel the deadly blod

United we stand
Commence killing spree
Conquest to claim victory

Fearless... heading the call
Helpless... in numbers they fall
Faceless... death is unveiled
Killing Machine prevails

Terrified by sonic screams caught dead in your tracks
Crushed in palms of metal hands sound of breaking backs

Scanning eyes coming in targeting the prey
Steel and flame engulf the land
Face judgement day

Head the call
Make the stand
Watch them fall
Take command
