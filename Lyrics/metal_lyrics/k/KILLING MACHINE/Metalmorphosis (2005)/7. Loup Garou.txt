On the run, complete frenzy
Nourished by the moon
Under the spell, this mystery turned into a loon
The midnight sun upon me shines and wets my appetite
Helplessly pacing the night trying to win this fight

Apathy is my destiny
In my heart, in my veins

Loup Garou

I'm the hunter, shape-shifting phase
Taunted victim, whatcan I do?
I'm the hunter transformed to prey
Heaunted victim called Loup-Garou
I'm the hunter left in a daze

Loup-Garou

Horrified reality
Schizophrenia takes hold
Spun into crazed illusion
Mass hysteria unfolds
This undeserving curse lives on
And the nightmare has begun
This silver touch can only
Save the innocent
The taste I crave
