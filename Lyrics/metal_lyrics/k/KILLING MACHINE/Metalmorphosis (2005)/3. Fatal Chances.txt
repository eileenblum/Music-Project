The fighting is now over
The light of moon reveals
Spilled masses of blood
Reflecting on the ground
Genuis of destruction
You blind king of fools

Decisions you made brought death without a sound

What have you done?
What has been won?

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Fatal chances
A world in rust
The fatal chance was taken
A molten sky remains
Horizons in flames
Now what is left to gain?
Tyrannies deception
Let to your demise
Strategies of error
Dominator gone insane
