Deity within your mind
Judgmental quite insane
Your twisted sense of life
Denying that you're to blame
Sickness of your made mirage
Falseness within yourself
Sultry pride steps in the way
Prestige sits on a shelf

Always trying to wipe the blood off your hantis
Always lying, hoping that we'll understand
You pass your judgment on me
What makes you God?
Unwrap this leash around me
I'm not your dog

Crucifying constantly
Unworthy of you
Ripping down ones self esteem
Selfishly you do
Foolish god is what we see
Washed up entity
Your regime has crumbles down
Deluded mastery

Deity within your mind
What makes you God?
Crucifying constantly
I'm not your dog
Sickness of your made mirage
What makes you God?
Foolish god is what we see
I'm not your dog
