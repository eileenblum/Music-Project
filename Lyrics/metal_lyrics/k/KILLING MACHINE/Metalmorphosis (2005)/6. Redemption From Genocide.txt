Dreaming, believing in this masquerade
World so deceiving fabled serenade
Visions in me head sacred prophecy
Reaching for heaven and it's legacy

Where is the light that leads the way
Keeping me sanem show me the way
Where is the sign that helps me see

Redeem from genocide

The lost and the lonely in dakrness wait
For wings of salvation
From this twisted fate
Release your lost soul from deceptions hand
Redemption from madness they you'll understand

Fall into your knees
Silencing your pleas
From this human disease and it's atrocities
Do not fall sadly from grace
Step outside this destructive race
Oblivion at their fingertips
The kiss of death upon their lips

Do not fall sadly from grace
Step outside this destructive race
Take our hand, we'll find the way
And together we'll praise the day
