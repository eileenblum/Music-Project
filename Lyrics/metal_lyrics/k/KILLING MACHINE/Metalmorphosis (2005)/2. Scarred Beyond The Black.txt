Trained to kill, trained to die
With honour &amp; pride
A mission of the brave
We watch them die fellow me
Brothers in command
We shut their eyes we dug their grave

We're the victors of treason
Battle cries locked inside my head

Scarred beyond the black
Torn beyond healing
Scarred beyond the black
Can't stop the screams
Haunting dreams, memories

Traumatized for life
The price the final cost

Pledged to fight until death
Till the bitter end
How many souls are lost?
Heroes in your eyes
The few, the proud, that didn't die
