Adrenaline rush, going for the throat, shoot you in the back, show no remorse.
Target found, hunt you fucking down, blow your skull, I will never die.
Going berserk, another hit and run, collect the cash and hunt you down
Out of your mind, looking for the thrills, collect the cash and hunt you down.

(fuck you Iâm fucking die)

Get in my way anâ I shoot you down, might be a killer or a overrated clown.
Sneaking upon you like the pro Iâam. either way youâll fucking die.
Guns or gadgets to help me through, moral majority death to you.
Violence soaked, Iâm in the mood, moral majority death to you

Ainât such a thing as game over
Ainât such a thing as game over

Violence coming in every shape, Iâam the master and feed on hate
Never a failure, proud to kill, another mission, going to the thrill.
Find new ways to kill you all, bullets flying, cops are dying.
Need new power, assassinate, bullets flying, cops are dying.

Ainât such a thing as game over
Ainât such a thing as game over

Ainât such a thing as game over
Ainât such a thing as game over

Adrenaline rush, going for the throat, shoot you in the back, show no remorse.
Target found, hunt you fucking down, blow your skull, I will never die.
Going berserk, another hit and run, collect the cash and hunt you down
Out of your mind, looking for the thrills, collect the cash and hunt you down.
Hunt you down

Bahâ¦
