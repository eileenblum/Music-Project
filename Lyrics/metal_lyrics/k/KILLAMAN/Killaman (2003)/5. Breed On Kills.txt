You never should have fuck around
Now Iâll hunt you fucking down
Betrayal is the trigger word

Sunset kill is closing in
Sunset kill is closing in

Breed on kills â I fucking breed on kills
Breed on kills â I fucking breed on kills

Pleasure is what I seek
And youâll be the one that meet the
Sharp edge of my axe

Iâm the fucking thrill killer

You though you could hide from me
Now Iâm right behind you
Feel my blade next to your skin

Sunset kill is what it is
Sunset kill is what it is
Sunset kill is what it is

Breed on kills â I fucking breed on kills
Breed on kills â I fucking breed on kills

Pleasure is what I seek
And youâll be the one that meet the
Sharp edge of my axe

Iâm the fucking thrill killer

Fuck you, Iâm the king of kills
Fuck you, Iâm the king of thrills
Famous, Iâm the king of kills
Famous, Iâm the king of thrills
