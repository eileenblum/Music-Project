Increase in adrenaline
Breathing patterns quicken
Body movements become erratic

Body movements become erratic
Scour the scene for danger
I am behind you

Your skull explodes from hammer blows

Your skull explodes from hammer blows

In darkness stalking human life
I claim their goals and dreams
The pleasure mine, which I derive
From their struggle and scream
The pleasure mine, which I derive
From their struggle and scream

Postmortem exploration
Of your parents slain possession
Feel the power of god

Feel the power of god
Human mutilation
Iâam behind you
