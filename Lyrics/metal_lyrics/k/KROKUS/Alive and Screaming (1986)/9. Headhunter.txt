Aaahhh

I am the animal
My god, I am the beast
I love to see you bleed
So welcome to my feast
We're serving human flesh
To keep you satisfied
With every bloody bite you eat
Another's going to die

Aaahhh

Don't give me politics
Don't give me public schools
Just keep the cops and t.v. police
From breaking all the rules
I am the raging bull
No fear, no sympathy
Sex and drugs and rock and roll
That's my cup of tea

Ooohhh

[Chorus:]

Feel the heat
Throw your bodies into the fire Instant Song Lyrics
Time to feed
Headhunter
Headhunter
Headhunter
Headhunter aahh

My axe is clean and sharp
And blade is shining bright
She's hungry for her midnight snack
And heads will roll tonight
I am the hunter
Not easy to please
Stand in line, she cures their lust
Victims on their knees aahh

[Chorus]

Headhunter
Headhunter
Headhunter
Headhunter
Headhunter
Aaaaaahhhhhh
Headhunter
