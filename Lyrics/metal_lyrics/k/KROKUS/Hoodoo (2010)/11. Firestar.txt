[Fernando Von Arb - Chris Von Rohr - Marc Storace]

My love burns like Texas heat
I'm goin' up in flames
She got me back on sturdy feet
Now I'm on my way

Feeding on my wild desire
Heals my weary soul
Holds me down in a hellfire
'till I lose control

Firestar! Firestar!

She fixed my heart and broken dreams
Energised my head
Helped me find a will of steel
Saved me from the dead

Hold me babe 'cause I'm your man
Melt these heavy chains
I will give you all I can
To take away your pain

Firestar! Firestar!

So hold me babe 'cause I'm your man
Melt these heavy chains
I will give you all I can
To take away your pain

Firestar! Firestar!
Firestar! Firestar!

Burnin', burnin', burnin', burnin'
Fire, firestar!
Fire, firestar!
Fire!
