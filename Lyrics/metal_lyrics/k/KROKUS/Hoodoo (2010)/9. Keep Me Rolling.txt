[Fernando Von Arb - Chris Von Rohr - Marc Storace]

Woman, you make me hot
I said woman, I need a lot
Enjoy your lovin' enjoy your blues
And when you're rockin', you blow my fuse

Oh when the night is young
And the dark has come
I wanna share your love

You keep me rollin', through the night
You keep me goin', and that's alright

Lady, you got style
I said lady, I love your smile
Your tender body, your gypsy soul
This kinda magic, will never go, go, go!

When the night is young
And the dark has come
I wanna share your love

You keep me rollin', through the night
You keep me goin', and that's alright
You keep me rollin', through the night
You keep me goin', baby hold me time
Hold me time

When the night is young
And the dark has come
I wanna share your love

You keep me rollin'
You keep me rollin', through the night
You keep me goin', and that's alright
That's alright, yeah, that's alright
Hold me time, tonight
Baby, baby, baby, baby that's alright
Hold me time,
Right now
