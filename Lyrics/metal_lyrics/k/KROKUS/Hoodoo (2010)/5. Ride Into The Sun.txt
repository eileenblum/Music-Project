[Fernando Von Arb - Chris Von Rohr - Marc Storace - Mark Kohler]

He come across the mountains
He sailed across the sea
Looking for adventure
Riding with the free

No stone was left unturned
No forest unexplored
And villages he burned
In his quest for more

We ride into the sun
When dust is comin' down

Got mental revolution
Sacred fantasy
Voodoo evolution
Cannibal reality

The future holds no pity
Warriors shed no tears
Broken hearts in the city
True love is killed by fear

We ride into the sun
When dust is comin' down
We ride into the sun
The smoke is comin' round

We ride into the sun
When dust is comin' down
We ride into the sun
Desperadoes on the run
