She blessed all dirty water
On a stormy full moon night
She walked through sand and fire
Never caught in a fight

He got that rattlesnake fever
Red dust on his boots
Demons and fallen angels
Got the black spider blues

Mama was a hoodoo woman
Papa was a hoodoo man
Mama was a hoodoo woman
Papa, was a hoodoo man

She's drivin' hard that Chevy trail
Burnin' on both ends
She rocks the town of New Orleans
With her gypsy blend

A mean shootdown in Ed's Saloon
Spirits join the sky
The undertaker said "I'll never forget the day, the whole town cried."
