[Fernando Von Arb - Chris Von Rohr - Marc Storace]

Red lights town is in full swing
Hold tight almost anything
The band is playing rock'n'roll
Stripper slidin' up and down the pole

I walked to the doll with the red dress and said
Come on let's drive it in, drive it in

Moonshot beast is on the loose
Straight cut blow away my blues
A little bit of lovin' let it go
Hallelujah, free your dying soul, yeah

I walked to the woman with the black dress and said
Come on let's drive it in, drive it in
Drive it in, drive it in

Passion lady took my breath away
She said love it baby come out and play
Tattooed body tight leather 'n' lace
Said I could have it all over at her place

Hitched with the mama with no dress and say
Come on let's drive it in, drive it in
Drive it in, you gotta drive it in
Drive it in, baby, drive it in
Drive it in, oh, drive it in
Come on  drive it
Keep on drive it
Guilty, face believe baby
Drive it in baby
Drive it in baby
