[Fernando Von Arb - Chris Von Rohr - Marc Storace]

One life, one love
Gettin' ready to ride
New name, new place
And the feelin' is right

She takes care of the man in me
Ooh yeah! Sets the bad boy free
Don't understand the way live
Knows when to take and knows when to give

Too hot, too hot to handle
Lay me down right now
Too hot, love is a gamble
Don't stop let it out

One head, one heart
Sweet child is born
New shoes, new face
And the passion is strong

Workin' hard it's tough on the street
Her love gets me back on my feet
The flame is high she feeds the fire
Nothin' can stop my burnin' desire

Too hot, too hot to handle
Lay me down right now
Too hot, love is a gamble
Don't stop let it out
Let it out, let it out, right now

Too hot, too hot to handle
Too hot, too hot to handle
Too hot, too hot to handle
Too hot, too hot to handle
Too hot, too hot to handle
Lay me down right now
Too hot, love is a gamble
Don't stop let it out
Too hot, too hot to handle
Lay me down right now
Too hot, love is a gamble
Don't stop let it out
Let it out, let it out, right now
