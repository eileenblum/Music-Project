[Fernando Von Arb - Chris Von Rohr - Marc Storace]

We've been around for so long
Losin' ground but getting strong
We've seen it comin', we've seen it go
So come on loosen up breakaway
Hey! Hey! Hey!

Gimme a rock'n'roll handshake
Set your spirit free
Gimme a rock'n'roll handshake
Turn around slap one on me

Breakin' the fight with an old song
Making it right 'cause it was wrong
Cover my back and I'll cover yours
So come on shake it up break away
Hey! Hey! Hey!

Gimme a rock'n'roll handshake
Set your spirit free
Gimme a rock'n'roll handshake
Turn around slap one on me

One for all and all for one
Life is short to jump the gun
So come on crank it up break away
Hey! Hey! Hey!

Gimme a rock'n'roll handshake
Set your spirit free
Gimme a rock'n'roll handshake
Slap one on me

Gimme a rock'n'roll handshake
Set your spirit free
Gimme a rock'n'roll handshake
Turn around slap one on me
