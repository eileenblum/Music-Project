[Fernando Von Arb - Chris Von Rohr - Marc Storace]

Blame it on the street
I gotta get some lovin' tonight
Lay it down on me honey
This girl is outta sight

One night stand
Travellin' with the band
Passion in a motel room
A magic touch, never too much
Then she blows me right over the moon

I'm goin' down
Down on dirty street
I'm goin' down
Down on dirty street

Hangin' at the bar
Slippin' on a hurricane
Said bye, bye Lucy
You're drivin' me insane

Lady of the night
Don't give up the fight
The band is gettin' ready to roll
Devil in my heart
Tearin' me apart
My misery is hard to control

I'm goin' down
Down on dirty street
I'm goin' down
Down on dirty street

I'm goin' down
Down on dirty street
I'm goin' down
Down on dirty street

I'm goin' down
Down on dirty street
I'm goin' down
Down on dirty street

Dirty street, all alone
On my own
I'm so lonely of love
Down on dirty street
Baby on the street
Baby on the street
Baby on the street
