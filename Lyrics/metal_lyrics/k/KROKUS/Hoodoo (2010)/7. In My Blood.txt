[Fernando Von Arb - Chris Von Rohr - Marc Storace]

She kisses like the devil
Talkin' like a nun
She holds me like an angel
Hits me like a gun
I feel the rollin' thunder
Down on me
But the love she gives
Just sets me free

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
You got it
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
I need it

She's in my blood, in my blood
Under my skin
She's in my blood, in my blood
Under my skin

They tell me she mean trouble
I can't resist
My heart beats double
I taste her lips
Backstreet rhythm
She comes on strong
Such a merciless lover
She bangs the gong

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
You got it
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
I need it

She's in my blood, in my blood
Under my skin
She's in my blood, in my blood
Under my skin

She's in my blood, in my blood
So help me gone
Mama

She's in my blood, in my blood
Under my skin
She's in my blood, in my blood
Under my skin

She's in my blood, Yes she is
Under my skin
She's in my blood, in my blood
Under my skin

She's in my blood, in my blood
Under my skin
