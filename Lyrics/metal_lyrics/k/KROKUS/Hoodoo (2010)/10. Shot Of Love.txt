Don't want your money
Don't need your trash
Don't want your fake smile
Don't need your stash

Don't need your limousine
To get me out of my bed
Don't bring me caviar
Back talk hurts my head

I need a shot, shot of love
In a world of fools
I need a shot, shot of love
That's what I need, yeah

Don't sell me lifestyle
Don't need your blues
Don't want your perfume baby
Don't need your booze

Don't feed me cocaine mama
It's more than I can bear
Don't bring me ecstasy
I don't need to be square

I need a shot, shot of love
In a world of fools
I need a shot, shot of love
Gimme what I need,

I need a shot, shot of love
In a world of fools
I need a shot, shot of love
Gimme what I need, yeah

I need a shot, shot of love
In a world of fools
I need a shot, shot of love
That's what I need, yeah

I need a shot, shot of love
In a world of fools
I need a shot, shot of love
Gimme what I need, yeah

Gimme a shot of love
