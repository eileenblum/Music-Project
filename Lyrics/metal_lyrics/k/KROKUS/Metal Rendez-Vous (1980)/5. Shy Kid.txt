It's a lonely evening
In a lonely town
I ain't too old to cry, now
But a woman gets me down

Way down in Boston
They sent me right away
Way down in Memphis
I know I'm gonna say

She's a shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, yeah
She's a shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, yeah

I got an empty bottle
And an empty face
I ain't too young to see
I'm just some rock-and-roll man

She's a shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, yeah
She's a shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, yeah

She's a shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, yeah
She's a shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, yeah

She's a shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, yeah
She's a shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, shy kid, yeah
