I know you call me
A dirty lover
But thats's exactly
What you need

It's not the talkin'
Not even the jokin'
It's bedtime action
Baby till you bleed

Heatstrokes fire burning smoke oh yeah

I got to do it
Twice or more tonight
Oh baby I need you
Your pants are so tight

Let's get some shelter
I need it fast and hot
So take your umbrella
And we can do it on the spot

Heatstrokes fire burning smoke
