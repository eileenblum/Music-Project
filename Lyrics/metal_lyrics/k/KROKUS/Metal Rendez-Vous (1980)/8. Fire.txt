You've got no real ambitions
You're just hanging around
All you try to do
Is keep from falling down

You feel so sick and tired
Nothing left to see
I hear you calling and calling
Oh lord what you're doing to me

Fire,fire is what you need
Fire,fire,we've got it for you till you bleed

It's no bed of roses
To be in a desert so long
All those silly drawbacks
You take them one by one

Nobody shares your burden
They only say you're blind
We try to give you power
To leave your dead life behind

Fire,fire is what you need
Fire,fire,we've got it for you till you bleed
