I wanna kiss my baby in a cadillac
Driven by a chauffeur,sitting in the back
"Johnny you can drive us anywhere
But I need time before arriving there"

Gliding through the city to the concert hall
My baby holds me tight,I hear some rock'n'roll
I tell the driver "come on let's go through the door
Wanna do it to the music but I need some more"

Hey now,back-seat rock'n'roll
Hey now,do it with your soul

We'd drive into the hall straight ahead to the stage
The music's growing high upon our lover's cage
She's rocking me,I'm rolling her
People peeping through the windows,I don't care

Hey now,back-seat rock'n'roll
Hey now,do it with your soul

Thanks to enriquedawson for sending track #5 lyrics.
