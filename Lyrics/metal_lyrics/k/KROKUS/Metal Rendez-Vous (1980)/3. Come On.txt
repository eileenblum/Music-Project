We're gonna hit your lazy town
With amazing sounds
Everybody's hot to get this noise
Good evening ladies &amp; boys

We fly into the rising sun
With your body &amp; soul
Everyone of us has all we need
No limit in turn and speed

Come on,come on to the place where the evil dies
Come on,come on to the stage in the other skies

It saves my life,it makes me cry
No need to die
High energy the key of life
Nobody kills my drive

Another day,another place
Make-up on my face
It makes me turn and wonder why
I'm living in a rock'n'roll sky

Come on,come on to the place where the evil dies
Come on,come on to the stage in the other skies
