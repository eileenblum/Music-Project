The show is over you got to go home again
Late in the night you're dreamin'
Of the guitar-man
The radio station plays his latest song
It says your way of life is kind of wrong

Do you hear your bedside radio ?
Do you hear your bedside radio ?

You wake up early in the morning
With the radio news
But in your blood is still
This dose of blues
The sound of the band
Has turned you upside-down
Instead of going to your office
You're leaving the town

Do you hear your bedside radio ?
Do you hear your bedside radio ?
