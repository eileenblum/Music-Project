You've taken my time
You've taken my soul
I got so hung up on you

I was out in the cold
And out in the rain
You found me all alone

You meet me at the corner
Giving me your hand
Took me in another land

Your eyes were so pretty
Your lies so sweet
I gave you everything I had

Lady double dealer somewhere in the night
Lady double dealer alright

You're playing all my records
Instead of making love
You take but never give it back

You're telling me some stories
I'm hanging on your lips
You're turning my mind away

You're sweeter than the morning
When the sun comes up
But you say it's time to split

Sometimes in the night
I wake up without you
I keep on calling your name

Lady double dealer somewhere in the night
Lady double dealer alright
