See the evening lights
Day has gone, the stars begin to shine
Shadows move so slow
Holding for the forest further on

Darkness and disgrace
Silver moonlight's falling on your face
But love you're not alone
Turn on with me and try to keep this song

I'm a streamer in the night

You're just out of sight
But need of spirit's crying in the night
Near the railway line
A fallen angel's waiting for a sign

I'm a streamer in the night

[To Beatrice and Magi]
