I see you crying
I see you dying
You keep on trying
To stay in my life

But there is no future
In our dream
I'm out on the run
Ready to scream
I'm dealing with danger
Don't believe what you read
Baby forgive me
I'm not what you need

I see you falling
I hear you calling
You keep on strolling
All around my place

But there is no future
In our dream
I'm out on the run
Ready to scream
I'm dealing with danger
Don't believe what you read
Baby forgive me
I'm not what you need

No way to stay
No day to play
