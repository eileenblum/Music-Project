Last night when I was lying in my bed
Had a dream of a flag in white &amp; red
Swiss cross turned into the japan dot
A yellow girl appeared and made me hot

She took me to her place-A geisha house
There was tea,rice-booze &amp; ceremony
I got undressed,she had me washed
I felt her body and I was lost

Tokyo nights,hot burning lights
Tokyo nights,you took my mind away
Made me obsessed by loving fights

Soon I remembered I stayed in a dream
And I could make a try to change the scene
The geisha girl was just too hot for me
I tried to wake up - Unsuccessfully

And even as the big alarm-clock rang
Outside my window the first blackbird sang
My yellow girlfriend didn't leave my head
Got to stay forever in her bed

Tokyo nights,hot burning lights
Tokyo nights,you took my mind away
I'm in the spell of your delights
