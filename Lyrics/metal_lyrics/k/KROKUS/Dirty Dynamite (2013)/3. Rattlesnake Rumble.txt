Standing at your window
Honey I've been here before
Waiting for the chance
Darlin' I'm checkin' your door

I want you in the day
I need you in the night
Come on
I'm rollin' on the floor
Don't keep me hangin' on
So long, that's right

Mama... I got the rattlesnake rumble
Mama... I got the rattlesnake blues

Try to hold you close
Baby you keep slippin' away
Need another dose
Strike me in the heart again

Please don't be so cruel
Come and kiss away my pain
Oh yeah
Take me in your arms
Let me feel your magic charm tonight
Alright
