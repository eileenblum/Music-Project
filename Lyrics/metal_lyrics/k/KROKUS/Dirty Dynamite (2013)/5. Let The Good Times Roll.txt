I get up in the morning too early to wake
Been hittin' hard an' my poor bones ache
I look at the time then I look at my face
Seven lovely women from a different place

Livin' ain't easy when they call
Hey hey hey
Let the good times roll... let it roll

From Tuscon Arizona to the Sunset Strip
Ask me no questions I shoot from the hip
Workin' for the dollar till my back is sore
Good to see you babe at my door

Sweet taste of whiskey, women and song
Hey hey hey
Let the good times roll... let it roll

New Orleans Belle comin' my way
California blondes ready to play
Texas red party in bed
New York City doll left me lyin' for dead

Life's too short I'm havin' a ball
Hey hey hey
Let the good times roll... let it roll
Sweet tastin' whiskey, women and song
Hey hey hey
Let the good times roll... let it roll
