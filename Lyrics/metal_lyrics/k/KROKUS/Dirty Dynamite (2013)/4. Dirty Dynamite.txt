When I walk that lonely road
Feel the loving words she wrote
It breaks my heart it's a crying shame
No one else but myself to blame

I want my girl yeah I want my love
I call my seven angels above
Bring me back the one I need
This fading taste of bittersweet

She's dirty dynamite
And I'm a crazy fool
We need salvation
Can't play it cool

I love the way she walks
And I love the way she talks
Yes you can tell me what you want
Say you're leaving honey don't

Remember how I use to touch your hair
There was a golden magic there
Oh can you hear the distant call
Yes you and me we had it all

You're dirty dynamite
And I sure need more
There ain't no future
When you walk that door
