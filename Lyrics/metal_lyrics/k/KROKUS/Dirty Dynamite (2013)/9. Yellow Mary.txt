I've been in love for a long long time
I see her in the dark
Wanted to know where she's coming from
Dance in the dark

I need to go to the place she lives
She's so damn nice
Hey morning flower wanna hold your hand
And look into your eyes

Yellow Mary - shining light
Won't you come to me
Yellow Mary - feels alright
Girl you set me free

She took my hand healed my broken heart
Fixed my shattered dreams
Gave me the wish to believe in love
As hard as it seemed

Sweet tastin' cherry in a smokey night
Love your golden smile
You take me to the place I never was before
Make me feel so high
