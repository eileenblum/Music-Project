We sleep all day and work all night
When it's dark we feel alright
Thunder and lightnin' hit the sky
Rainbows risin' we're ready to fly

No more troubles
No more chains

I live ma life the way I do
We play it wild in a human zoo

We say it clear and say it loud
Got no fear rockin' proud
Hell it ain't easy just livin' free
We're sailing high on seven seas

No more troubles
No more pains
