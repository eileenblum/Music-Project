We're gonna have a party
We're gonna be rockin' tonight
With a whole lotta rollin'

Honey we can make it
Honey we can take it all night
When the beat starts knockin'
And the sweat comes runnin' tonight

I'm a hard rockin' hard rockin'
Hard rockin' hard rockin' man
I'm a hard rockin' hard rockin'
Hard... rockin' man
Yes I am

The joint is swingin'
Balls on fire tonight
Kissin' and a huggin'
No one's here for a fight

Honey we can make it
Honey we can take it all night
And the world starts shakin'
'Cause the band keeps jammin' tonight
