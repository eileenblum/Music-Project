If you got problems with your ramblin' girl
She's giving you the blues
You wanna little more
She gives a little less
She's treating you so cruel
Pick up your life you're never alone
When the hard times rule

Come on over honey
Listen what I say

Go... go baby go
Go... go baby go

You've reached the point of no return
You look her in the eye
When the goin' gets tough the tough gets goin'
You take her by suprise
Now your life's back on the track
'Cause you're a highway child

She hit you once
She hit you twice
Don't need no dirty lies
