You want cash I want love
You need time I feel fine
You say stop I say go
I believe what I know

You're my girl I'm your man
I will do the best I can
I say yes you say no
I feel high and you feel low

I'll tell you what you need

Hallelujah - come and get me
Hallelujah - set me free
Hallelujah - can you feel it
Hallelujah - rock'n'roll

Life is short it's a crime
Got to see eye to eye
Raise your head shout it out
Hear the call sing it loud
