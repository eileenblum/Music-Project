I'm a man and I want my share
Got nothing to loose
Been around for a long long time
Still going for the blues
I pack my bags and I hit the road
In my black Suede shoes

Tell me here and now my friend
What in the whole wide world is...

Better than sex
Yeah baby that's the rule
Better than sex
So wild and cool

It heals my heart and it save my soul
Like rock'n'roll
This physical marriage of human flesh
Sweet touch'n'go
A love exchange of sensual joy
Comes free for all

Tell me here and now my friend
What in the whole wide world is...

Better than sex
Yeah baby that's the rule
Better than sex
So wild and cool

Better than sex
(Better than sex)
Yeah baby that's the rule
(Better than sex, better than sex)
Better than sex
(Hey hey hey)
So wild and cool
(Better than sex)
