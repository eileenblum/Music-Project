Sit and wait another day
She left me hangin' out in the rain
Nothin' worse than an empty heart
My head is spinnin' I'm fallin' apart

Now... you know it hearts me babe
Now... breakin' my heart again

I got the bailout blues
Day and night
I got the bailout blues
Baby's out of sight

Here I stand in torment and pain
Heartbroken ball and chain
My mind is racin' like a midnight express
Come baby please get me outta this mess

Now... you know it hurts me babe
Now... breakin' my heart in vain
