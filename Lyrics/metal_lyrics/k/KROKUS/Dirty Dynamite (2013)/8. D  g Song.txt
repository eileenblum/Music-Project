Come around come around
I see your good intentions
With a love so strong
You're my only true redemption
Sometimes it comes
Sometimes it goes
We're gonna have a party
Yeah we're gonna have a ball

Alright - come on
All night long - You gimme what I need
All night long - Yeah

Move around shake around
Gimme your emotions
Feel your heart beat
To this music devotion
Spirit is high
As we rock the floor
And nothing gonna stop us
No nothing at all

Alright - come on
All night long - the world is at your feet
All night long - yeah

Alright - come on
All night long - the world is at your feet
All night long - yeah yeah yeah
All night long
