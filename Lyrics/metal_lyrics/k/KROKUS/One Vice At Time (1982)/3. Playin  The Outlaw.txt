Oh! Alright!
Come on now . . .
Get a life
Get a life! (gather up?)
Flat on my back in a hotel bar
With the sound of a jukebox in my head
Wonderin' how I came so far
Truth be known, I should've been dead, yeah
Cruisin' around in a beat up car
High noon comes in a four door saloon
Spending the night with a ten dollar whore
Private hell in a padded room
Playin' the outlaw
Takin' the back door
Playin' the outlaw!
Listen kids to the story so far
Never get caught with a five ace hand
Don't shoot the man with the iron star
You can bet the hangman won't understand
The judge's wife don't ever cheat
But her daughter's body can bend the law
Can't stand the lovin', can't stand the heat
Life's for livin' and that's for sure
Playin' the outlaw
Takin' the back door
Playin' the outlaw!

[Guitar Solo]

Playin' the outlaw
Takin' the back door
Playin' the outlaw
Playin' the outlaw!
Brother, around [?]
