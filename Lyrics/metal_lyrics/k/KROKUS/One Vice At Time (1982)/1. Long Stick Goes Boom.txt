Y'all know about sixty-nine
Burnin' bones and bedside time
Once again we meet tonight
Get that touch of a magical night

We're gonna hit it
We're gonna kick it
We're gonna break through the ice
You give us fever
You give us sweat
You're gonna make us live it twice
Tonight long stick goes boom!
Tonight long stick goes boom!

The time is right for a ride tonight
To be with you I'd risk a fight
My stick is tight my blood is hot
Let's do it right here on the spot

We're gonna hit it
We're gonna kick it
We're gonna break through the ice
You give us fever
You give us sweat
You're gonna make us live it twice
Tonight long stick goes boom!
Tonight long stick goes boom!
