[Written by Chris Von Rohr, Fernando Von Arb]

The spaced out freak with a silver steel guitar
Was a god of rock, he was a superstar
Speeding around in a red hot flashy car
Drinkin' vodka of the seventh Russian Tsar

Rock 'n' roll is in my soul
Rock 'n' roll you get it all
Rock 'n' roll is in my soul
Rock 'n' roll just get it on

Doin' the movies, he lets in action T.V.
Has a million-dollar contract, just like Elvis P.
Goofin' off with acid gettin' light on par
Takin' trips and enemies (Ooooh...) He likes it a lot

Rock 'n' roll is in my soul
Rock 'n' roll you get it all
Rock 'n' roll is in my soul
Rock 'n' roll just get it on

Shakin' up with Molly givin' a fill a screw
Begin' fill and folly, babe gimme somethin' new
When the angels call me "I'll be very brave"
So brave, so brave
Hopin' one tell, call me lyin' dead in my grave

Rock 'n' roll is in my soul
Rock 'n' roll you get it all
Rock 'n' roll is in my soul
Rock 'n' roll just get it on

Speed around in a red hot flashy car
Drinkin' vodka a superstar
He's out on TV, this Elvis P.
High on pot and he loves it a lot
Giving you somethin' new
Very brave in my grave
