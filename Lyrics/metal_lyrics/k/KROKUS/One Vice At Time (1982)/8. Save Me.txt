Sittin' here in a backstreet bar
No future spirit is low
Ain't no money for a grey hound ticket
Bad stories all in a row
Hair splitters tail gunners all over town
I'm a stranger this city is bringin' me down

Save me
Save me
Save my life

No chance for a first class hooker
Can't even pay my booze
They wanna bend me the way they need me
But I'm not bound to lose
Don't want to get called up
I'm not gonna fight their ways
I'm a free man black stallion
Come to my door
