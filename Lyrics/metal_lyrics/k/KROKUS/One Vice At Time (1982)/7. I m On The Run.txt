Standing at the station
Waitin' for the train
No money for a B.L.T.
Can't afford the plane
Sat me down in a smoker
Rolled me up a jay
Time is up, runnin' hot
This boy is on his way

I'm on the run, I'm on the run
Loaded like a gun
I'm on the run, I'm on the run
Silver bullet to the sun

Meet a million people
Tell me what to do
All the slimy leaches...yuk!
Make me feel so blue
But the booze in the bus
Hot legs round the neck
State to state coast to coast
Hey guys! I'll be back...

I'm on the run, I'm on the run
Loaded like a gun
I'm on the run, I'm on the run
Silver bullet to the sun

[Guitar Solo]

I'm on the run, I'm on the run
Loaded like a gun
I'm on the run, I'm on the run
Silver bullet to the sun
