The heat is getting stronger.
Come and feel the Power.
Shield your eyes from the flame.
Straight into the fire.
Let it get you higher
It's a passion you can't tame.

[Pre-chorus:]
Sure you wanna rock. Sure you wanna play. We've got something for you.
Hot stuff, shakin' it up. The only message is we only do it for the fun.

[Chorus:]
Burning up the night. Everything's gonna be all right. Burning up the night.
Don't give up the fight.
Burn it up... yeah!

The cool and reclusive.
Wild and exclusive.
Come alive at the show.
All you crazy dancers.
One night romancers.
Just let it go.

[Pre-chorus:]
All who wanna rock. All who wanna shout. We've got something for you.
Big Bang! Join the gang. The only message is we really wanna rock you out.

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Pre-chorus:]
Only wanna rock. Only wanna play. For an hour or two.
Big Bang! Join the gang. The only message is we really wanna rock you out.

[Chorus x4]
