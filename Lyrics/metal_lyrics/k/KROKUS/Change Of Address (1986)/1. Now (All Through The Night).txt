When the moon light
Silver shadow
Cover me over
With your live
And ease my sorrow
She gave me everything I needed
Shelter in the pouring rain
Now I do anything to have her back again

All through the night
I keep fighting the heartache
Fighting for you
All through the night
I keep dreaming about you
Screaming without you x2

I said now
I can't wait any longer now
While the passionâs stronger now
And I wanna please you now
Need you here to free me now

Taste of true love
Made of fools love
Blinded by magic
From the start I gave you my heart
I don't wanna live for the future
I never gonna live in the past
I need your love right now
That's what I ask

All through the night
I keep tossing and turning
Dream about you
All through the night
I keep dreaming about you
Screaming without you
I said now
I can't wait any longer now
While the passionâs stronger now
And I wanna please you now
Need you here to free me now

All through the night
I keep tossing and turning
Dream about you
All through the night
I keep dreaming about you
Screaming without you

I said now
I can't wait any longer now
While the passionâs stronger now
And I wanna please you now
Need you here to free me now
I can't wait any longer now
While the passionâs stronger now
And I wanna please you now
Don't you know I need you now
