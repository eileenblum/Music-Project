A child was born on a cold and windy night
Not far away from the burning village lights
Another son in a poor family
Bit short on money but the loving ran free

And as he grew from a boy to a man
His mama cried but he didn't understand
Somehow she knew oh that someday he would go
Into the world and a life of his own

Say goodbye but never deny
All the love you're leaving behind
Don't forget all the feelings you know Instant Song Lyrics
They'll be with you wherever you go

Out in the world he's been living the good life
House, car and money with a true and loving wife
A child is born to this new family
They gave her everything with love guaranteed

And as she grew and the quarrels began
Her papa cried but she didn't understand
Somehow he know oh that someday she would go
Into the world and a life of her own
