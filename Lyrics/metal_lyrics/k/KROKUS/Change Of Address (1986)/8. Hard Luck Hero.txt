Teenage rebel, nothing to lose
Back against the wall, mad and confused
Every conversation seems to end in a fight
Older generations say
They should know what's wrong from right

But all he ever wanted was freedom to say
Leave me alone, let me live my way

Hard luck hero, can't you see
Gotta run, run, run if you wanna be free
Hard luck hero, you and me
Gotta run, run, run, like a river runs free
For you and me

Cool sunglasses and a fast machine
Black leather jacket, old blue jeans
Never liked to fight, but he knew he could
Going through life, hustled and missunderstood

But all he ever wanted was someone to show
A little bit of love, but he never know

Hard luck hero, can't you see
Well we got no cause, but you wanna be free
Hard luck hero, you and me
Gotta run, run, run, like a river runs free
For you and me
For you and me

Driving through the hills, running fast and free
Racing to the edge high above the sea
Couldn't slow down, had to pay the price
Never being bound to living someone else's live

No matter what happened, no matter what they say
He was a rebel 'til his dying day

Hard luck hero, can't you see
Well we got no cause, but you wanna be free
Hard luck hero, you and me
Gotta run, run, run, like a river runs free

Hard luck hero, can't you see
Well we got no cause, but you wanna be free
Hard luck hero, you and me
Gotta run, run, run, like a river runs free
For you and me
Yeah, for you and me
