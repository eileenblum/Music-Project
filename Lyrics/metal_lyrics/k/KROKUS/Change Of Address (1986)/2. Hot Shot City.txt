Everybody get up,and let the good times roll on you.
Give me one more round,for all my friends and my lover too.
Feeling alright got a squeaky pair of dancing shoes,uh huh.
Better hold on tight,gonna boogie through the night,
You'll never be alone with all your friends around you.
This town gets down everybody turn around,
Hey hey it's a hot shot city.
This town gets down everybody turn around
Hey hey it's a hot shot city.
Dancing out in the streets,every boulevard and avenue,
Such a crazy crazy crowd,it's like a carnival for me and you.
Feeling alright gonna have myself a dance or two,uh huh.
Better hold on tight,gettin down tonight,
You'll never be alone,with my arm's around you.
This town gets down,everybody turn around,
Hey hey it's a hot shot city.
