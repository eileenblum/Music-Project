In my mind I can see
All the childhood reflections of me
Walkin' through the memory of long ago
So long ago..

We were young, we free
There was nothin' that we couldn't be
Searchin' for adventure
Lookin' for love..

Here as I sit alone in the dark
Million miles away
Wishin' that I could go back to the start
Knowin' that time won't bring back those days

I'm a long way from home
And I feel so all alone..

Now my world's far away
And I'm travellin' out into space
To the edge of the universe
It's where I must go...where I will go..

Through the stars, sailin' free
With the memory of what used to be
Searchin' for adventure Instant Song Lyrics
Lookin' for love..

Here as I sit alone in the dark
Million light years away
Wishin' that I could go back to the start
Knowin' that time won't bring back those days

I'm a long way from home
And I feel so all alone..
I'm a long way from home
And I feel so all alone..

[Solo]

Here as I sit alone in the dark
Million miles away
Wishin' that I could go back to the start
Knowin' that time won't bring back those days

I'm a long way from home
And I feel so all alone..
I'm a long way from home
And I feel so all alone..
