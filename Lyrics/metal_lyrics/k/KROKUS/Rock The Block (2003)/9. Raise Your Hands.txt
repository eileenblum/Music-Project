One love, no war
I know I'm not alone
I like to live my life in freedom
So don't you close the door

Around the world too many people wastin' their lives away
They can't tell what's right from wrong at the end of the day

Life is hell, no peace for the wicked where evil rules the game
Spreads like a wildfire and burns you down
We've gotta fight it, gotta stamp out the flame

Raise your hands for a better world
Make a stand and let your voices be heard
Raise your hands if you want a better world
Make a stand, I say that truth is the word

I know I'm not alone
I look in your face
Can see yer sparkling shine of innocence
I'm in the best right place!

Life has its burdens, too much pain
She can be a good bitch
Let's put this sufferin' all down to experience
And let her make us all rich, ha ha!

Life is hell, no peace for the wicked where evil rules the game
Spreads like a wildfire, destroys all dignity
We've gotta fight it, gotta stamp out the shame

Raise 'em high in the air
Make that message clear!
