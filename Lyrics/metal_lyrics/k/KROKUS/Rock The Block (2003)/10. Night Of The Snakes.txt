I'm a hot blooded man
Girl I know you like how I am
And I'm gonna sit back close to you again
Rushes thru' my body, quivers up my spine
This feeling when I see your curves of desire

Your gentle looks can kill
So full of lust within
Let me caress your flesh
Unveil your passion, turn you on!

It's the night of the snakes

X-rated scenes ahead
Time to put the kids to bed
Explore the mysteries of our bodies
Release some tension from this moral flesh
Lick one hundred beads of sweat!

You are the one for me
Your passion sets me free
I'm glad you feel the same
I love to hear you, call my name!
