Dark was the night, tears on my face
We gathered in the candlelight as the whole world stood still

How can I forget that prayer for the dead
Underneath that blackened sky
As close as we could get

It's the age we're livin' in
A dark sign of the times
Can't let the madness kick us down to the ground

We'll rise, we'll rise
We'll shine in the night
We'll rise, we'll shine from the ashes of eternity

We'll rise, we'll rise
We'll shine in the night
We'll rise, we'll shine to eternity

Another starry sky, another silver moon
And soon the sun will shine warming our roofs

Gather your children
We must move with the wind
to make a fire bright from the flames within

We'll rise, we'll rise
Like an eagle flies in the sky

'Cos together we're strong
And we'll rise, we'll rise
