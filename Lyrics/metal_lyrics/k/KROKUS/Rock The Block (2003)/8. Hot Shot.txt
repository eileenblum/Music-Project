Mmm yeah
Yeah listen!

He was born with a silver spoon in a house at the edge of the town
Before his mama would let you play you had to lay your money down

"I'm alive
You'd better read my lips before you see me go
'Cos here's what you should know!!!"

Hot shot on the hill
You can do what you like
'Cos your mama pays the bills
Hot shot on the hill
Sitting alone
Like a fool without a thrill

Nobody trusts him
He's the biggest joke in town
You can hear some crazy stories of how he liked to cheat around

Goin' just too far now
Breakin' all the social rules
Steppin' on his 'would be' best friends
When there's someone new to use!

How do you sleep in the night?
Does your conscience tear you up and make you cry?
I don't think you even have one, oh no!

Hot shot on the hill, like a fool without a thrill
Hot shot on the hill
Hey, who pays the fuckin' bill??
Ha ha ha!!
