Yeah!

I saw her walkin' down the street
My heart jumped up and missed a beat
Boy she looked sharper than an arrow
Her skirt too short and really narrow

No risk, no gain
But I must have made a pass too plain
Her hand came flyin' and it really was a shame!

Well I guess she was throwin' her china
With a steamy temper no one could stop
Yes I guess she was throwin' her china
Too sexy when she blows her top!

Next day I saw her in the park
If I was a dog I would have barked!!
In a pink bikini by the lake
Her perfect body lay to bake

No risk, no gain
But I must have blocked her sun away
Cold ice came flyin' and it landed on my face!!

Lyin' in the sunshine by the lake
The girl is givin' me a heartache
No risk, no gain
I'm runnin' out of cards to play
Another time, another place
I just gotta win the race!!

Too sexy when she blows her top
Watch out, there she blows
