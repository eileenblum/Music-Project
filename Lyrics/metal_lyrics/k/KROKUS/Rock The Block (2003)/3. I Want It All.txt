Yeah yeah yeah
Can't sit around and I won't look back
Runnin' outta time
Here comes the train tearin' up the track
And I know it's mine

You put high stakes on me
Now I've gotta go
I'm gonna take a chance on a winner's streak
The only way I know

When the lights are burnin' bright come on, say yeah
I can feel your spirit by my side touching me with every song

I want it all
Yeah, I want it all
I want it all
And I won't let you go

My life has changed in oh so many ways
I don't regret a thing
Yes we just pushed-on-together-thru'-some-tough-and-cruel-days
Whatever life would bring

You put your trust in me
Now I've gotta go
I'm gonna take a chance on a winner's streak
The best way I know

Oh honey stand by me, yeah!

Babe, you're magic
And you know honey... my life is in your hands
