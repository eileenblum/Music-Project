Well the sky is grey, streets are cold
And it's rainin' in my head
Stayin' at home is drivin' me nuts
Gotta boogie thru' the life out there!

Can't let bad weather mess up great plans for a wild weekend
Gotta meet my friends at the Rock Cafe on the corner of the city gate

There's a place open all night
Music is loud and the girls make eyes

We'll rock the block
We'll rock the block-block-block-block, one, two, three
We'll rock the block
'Cause we can't let the rain screw up all this fun
We'll rock the block
Yeah yeah! Take it away!!

We'll rock the block
The neighbourhood
Oh yeah!

We're gonna shake it!
We're gonna make it!
Gonna shake it!
And gonna rock it!

Shake the neighbourhood
Ah ha ha
We're gonna rock, rock, rock!!!
