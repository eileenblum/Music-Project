We've got a damned good reason for livin'
A damned good reason to be
We bring you back wild nights of pleasure
We'd like to set your souls free

The bus is back on the road again
And we don't spare no gas
We're gonna hit your lazy town...

A new age we're livin' in
But the party don't stop
Don't say you'll be no part of it
Join in the show!

Leadin' the pack
We're leadin' the pack
No turnin' back
We're leadin' the pack, yeah!

Women dancing, Shakira hips!
Sweating into a trance
Don't lose your cool, just read my lips
Boy we know where it's at, ha ha!
Why in the world are we waitin'?
We're comin' right to your door
Come stick your face in the crowd, my man!

The bus is back on the road again
And we don't spare no gas
We're gonna make some noise again
Come on, kick ass!!!

The bus is back on the road again
And we don't spare no gas
We're gonna hit your lazy town
Come on, kick ass!!!
