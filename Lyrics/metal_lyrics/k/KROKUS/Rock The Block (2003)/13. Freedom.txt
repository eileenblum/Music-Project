Zips up her warm leather jacket
Sits on the back of his bike
And with the sun rising from behind
The road of freedom they ride
High on love and adventure
Another weekend escape
To touch the wind and make fire burn
Sleep in a wood and feel the earth turn

A time to forget trouble
A time to heal the soul
No counting days by the hour
Good feelin's go with the flow

Freedom - that's what they call it
Freedom - it's all worth the fight
Freedom - don't waste your life away
Freedom - take the time to unwind

Bob and Jill are two friends of mine
Their days are counted you know
Both HIV positive
I'll really hate to see them go

Can't go waste your life away
Find the time, enjoy the day
Live it, love it, fight it, feel it
Spread your wings and fly away, yeah!

Need to have a good time!
