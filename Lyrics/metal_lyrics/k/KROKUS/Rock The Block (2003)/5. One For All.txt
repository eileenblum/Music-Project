One is a child in the ghetto
One is a beggar in rags
One is a victim of circumstance
One is a queen dressed in black

All working hard for the dollar
Money to keep 'em alive
It's one big fight for survival
And I just cannot walk on by

One for all, all for one
Now won't you give 'em a dime?
One for all, all for one
A little drop of your wine?!!

One is a veteran soldier
One is a man of the cloth
Here come the sisters of mercy
Collecting all that you've got

With respect to your religion, man
Your culture and your skin
Just don't believe in your selfish gods
Share your wealth and stop the terror from within!

That's no way to go you know, yeah

You get greedy, you get fat
And when you die you just can't take it with you
Anyway, so, that's it brother

The poorman gets poorer!!!
