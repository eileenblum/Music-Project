Hey! Gimme a break

Going crazy, insane
Got a load on my brain
Canât stand it another day
Broken down family ways

Got a beat up Cadillac
Slipping out now I wonât be back
Thereâs a party down the road
Got a girl, gonna take my load

Turn up the music
Turn it up loud
Turn up the music
Turn it up, turn it up loud

Out to lunch
Get up and dance
Let yourself go into
A rock ânâ roll trance
Out to lunch
Get up and dance
Let yourself go into
A rock ânâ roll trance

Crazy mama taking pills
Street legal dirty cheap thrills
Good for nothing old man
Living life in TV land

You and I have better ways
Rock ânâ roll is here to stay
Give it to me all night long
Let it in till the break of dawn

Turn up the music
Turn it up loud
Turn up the music
Turn it up, turn it up loud

Out to lunch
Get up and dance
Let yourself go into
A rock ânâ roll trance
Out to lunch
Get up and dance
Let yourself go into
A rock ânâ roll trance

Out to lunch
Get up and dance
Let yourself go into
A rock ânâ roll trance
Out to lunch
Get up and dance
Let yourself go into
A rock ânâ roll trance
Out to lunch
Out to lunch
Out to lunch
Out to lunch
