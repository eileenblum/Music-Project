I can tell by the way you hold your head
Tell by the way you smile
Youâre telling me lies
But I donât need to know
Itâs your life

When weâre together babe
Itâs love al the time
Living in this heart of mine
You tear me apart
Now I donât wanna hear you start again

Please donât ask no questions
And I wonât tell you lies
Digging in the dirt
Only gonna hurt
Itâs time you realized

If you got something to say
Go ahead and fire away
No matter what card you play
Itâs you Iâve always needed

Our love will never die
Donât know why
Itâs a feeling inside

We both had lovers out of town
Both like fooling around
It doesnât really matter
Because weâll never fall apart again

Please donât ask no questions
And I wonât tell you lies
Digging in the dirt
Only gonna hurt
Itâs time you realized

If you got something to say
Go ahead and fire away
No matter what card you play
Itâs you Iâve always needed

Our love will never die
Donât know why
Itâs a feeling inside
Our love will never die
Donât know why
Itâs a feeling inside
