Iâve been travelling down the road
With my friends all across the nation
And I met a lot of girls
Help me live my fantasies

Down in New Orleans
I found the right combination
She made me feel like a king
Boy she was so good to me

I felt her eyes follow me across the stage
Touch my body with a tigerâs gage
I slipped into her dream
Didnât even say goodnight
In the morning she just told me
In a letter

Hot stuff
I got love to suit you babe
Hot stuff
Guaranteed to make you temperature rise
Hot stuff
I donât want to lose you babe
How I hate to have to say goodbye

Back on the road
Another show, hot stage, new city
Love connection
Slowly fading away

I felt her eyes follow me across the stage
Touch my body with a tigerâs gage
I slipped into her dream
Didnât even say goodnight
In the morning she just told me
In a letter

Hot stuff
I got love to suit you babe
Hot stuff
Guaranteed to make you temperature rise
Hot stuff
I donât want to lose you babe
How I hate to have to say goodbye

Hot stuff
I got love to suit you babe
Hot stuff
Guaranteed to make you temperature rise
Hot stuff
I donât want to lose you babe
How I hate to have to say goodbye
