Have you heard itâs the new sensation
Bringing magic in the air
It feeds your imagination
Put the colour everywhere

Bright lights, blue smoke
Whatever turns you on
Push your body through the crowd
Get close where the musicâs loud

Looking through your magazine
Turn the pages, find your favourite dream
Rock ânâ Roll hanging on your bedroom wall
Turn the lights out, dream about the show

1, 2, 3, 4
Rockâ¦ Rock the nation
Rockâ¦ Rock the crowd
Rockâ¦ Rock the nation
Rockâ¦ Play it loud

We cross the seven seas
To satisfy your needs
Weâre playing in your town
Weâll burn it to the ground

Strike you like the Blitz, ooh yeah
Feel the power coming from the stage
Rock ânâ roll generation going wild
See the action, sing it with the band

1, 2, 3, 4
Rockâ¦ Rock the nation
Rockâ¦ Rock the crowd
Rockâ¦ Rock the nation
Rockâ¦ Play it loud
