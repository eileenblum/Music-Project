Party time, pass the wine
Anything goes tonight
Shot the moon, call the tune
Nobodyâs getting uptight

See the girls getting on down
Dancing and doing it hot
Snakey hips, sexy lips
Giving it all that theyâve got

Stepping outside, ready to ride
the boys are on their way
Burning steel, spinning wheels
Better get out of their way

Never surrender, go all the way

On a boysâ night out
On a boysâ night out
Gonna scream, gonna shout
On a boysâ night out

Dream machine, driverâs dream
Take me on this flight
Worked till noon to get her tuned
Donât let me down tonight

Weâre gonna make it
Weâre gonna take it
Take it to the edge tonight
Follow the noise
And the boys
With the fastest machines around

Never surrender, go all the way

On a boysâ night out
On a boysâ night out
Gonna scream, gonna shout
On a boysâ night out

On a boysâ night out
On a boysâ night out
Gonna scream, gonna shout
On a boysâ night out
