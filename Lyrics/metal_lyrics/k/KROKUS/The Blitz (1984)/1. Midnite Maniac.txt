Did you read it in the paper
'Bout the danger comin' your way
She'll tear you up at midnight
Killer on the loose get out of her way

Sex machine terrorizin' dream
Lock the door tonight
She's got it all she can walk through a wall
Better run for your life

And in the light of day
In hidin' she will stay
Watch out at midnight
Feel her shadow on your face

Midnite maniac: she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac: lock your door
Cause she can't be far

Did you hear it on the radio
Crimes of passion makin' the news
It happened after midnight
In your neighborhood could've been you

Sex machine terrorizin' dream
Lock the door tonight Instant Song Lyrics
She's got it all she can walk through a wall
Better run for your life

And in the light of day
In hidin' she will stay
Watch out at midnight
Feel her shadow on your face

Midnite maniac: she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac: lock your door
Cause she can't be far

Midnite maniac: she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac: lock your door
She knows where you are

Midnite maniac: she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac: lock your door
Cause she can't be far

Midnite maniac: she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac: lock your door
She knows where you are
