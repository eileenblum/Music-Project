In a restaurant
Drinkin' beaujolais wine
You're with your favourite girl
And you're passin'the time
Well you look through the papers
Holocaust in the roxy
Five hours later
You're lovin'your lady

I can see
Burnin'bones of war
I can see
Ashes on the floor

There stands a soldier
In a barbed-wire land
The fear of death in his eyes
And a bottle in his hand
But now the wine he's drinkin'
It's got the taste of blood
No more plastic war movies
To show him what it's like
