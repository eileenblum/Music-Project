I can see by your eyes what you need
I'll be out of your life
I may get depressed cause I tried so hard
To be somethin'special for you
Words of love that are still in my ears
Days when I kissed your tears
Long crazy nights spilling into days
Times when I lost my fears

She's got everything I need
And it's drivin' me insane
She's got everything I need
Makes me smile and makes me weep

Love needs a heart and I need to find
If I was treatin'you right
Angels and sailors rich girls and us
Are searchin'for true love tonight
