Mother's got a lover half as old as she
Father's got a gamblin'house in capri
Sister sue's a junkie dope and L.S.D.
Sells her arse to the arabs while others
Get it free
So I'm the black sheep
The only hang up I've got
Is an old guitar
And a cat named lisalott

Mad racket...you've got it
Mad racket...you've got it

Women's undergarments are simon's bag
He's a transvestite he's a fag
Auntie ann is a schizo crazy as they come
She thinks she is a chicken stickin'feathers
In her bum
So I'm the black sheep
The only hang up I've got
Is an old guitar
And a cat named lisalott
