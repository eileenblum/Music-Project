I've been waitin'for so long
Gettin'had and treated wrong
Sleepless nights and dirty lies
Makes no difference if you live or die

But it's over now

I'm a winning man
'Cause babe
I live my life the way I choose
Satisified not much to loose
If you don't feel you'll never know
Just what I've been goin'thru'for so long
