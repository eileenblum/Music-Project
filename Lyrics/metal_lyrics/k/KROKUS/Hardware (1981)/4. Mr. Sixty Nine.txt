Mr. sixty nine has suddenly come to rest
He died on the job that he did best
Oh you lucky angels
Heaven will be fine
Havin'lots of fun with Mr.sixty nine

Take care...he's hot
Take care...he's cool
Beware...little angels
Beware...here he comes

Mr.sixty nine sweet sixty nine
Mr.sixty nine Mr.sixty nine

It's a bad joke the way in which he died
He did choke on a lady's sanitary pad
Oh you lucky angels heaven will be fine
Havin'lots offun with Mr.sixty nine
