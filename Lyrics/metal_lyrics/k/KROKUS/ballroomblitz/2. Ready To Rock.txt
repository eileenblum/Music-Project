Ready to rock, ready to roll
Ready to rock, ready to roll

Get ready to give me
What I want, what what I need
Keep coming, need more
Got a sweet tooth, sheâs my candy store

Iâm gonna rock that girl tonight
Keep it up, do it right
Been waiting so long
Got my hands full, sheâs amazon

The way she teases
She really drives me wild
She always pleases
And I love to hear her say

Sheâs ready to rock
Ready to roll
Ready to rock
Get ready
Ready to rock
Ready to roll
Ready to rock
Are you ready

Iâm lightning, sheâs rain
Giving pleasure to ease the pain
Sweet thunder like a storm
Winds that blow till youâre ripped and torn

Sheâll be where the girls in the crowd
Love to rock, love to scream out loud
Got a fever inside, gonna find that girl
Keep me satisfied

The way she teases
She really drives me wild
She always pleases
And I love to hear her say

Sheâs ready to rock
Ready to roll
Ready to rock
Get ready
Ready to rock
Ready to roll
Ready to rock
Get ready
