Please tell me what I need to know
How much time before she blows
Itâs in every magazine
Always in the TV screen

Feel the tension everywhere
Driving people to despair
Politics and misery
Throw the world into a deep freeze

Just a few with all the power
High above in ivory towers
People thrown into the streets
Had too many ends to meet

Pressure danger crime war
Out out out out

Out of control
Donât feed the fire
Itâs out of control
Out of control
Too hot to handle
Itâs out of control

Hate becomes a way of life
Cuts survival like a knife
Dying blindly in a war
They didnât even know what for

Running junk into the brain
Temporary shield of pain
Digging deep into a hole
Suicidal overload

Pressure danger crime war
Out out out out

Out of control
Donât feed the fire
Itâs out of control
Out of control
Too hot to handle
Itâs out of control

Out of control
Donât feed the fire
Itâs out of control
Out of control
Too hot to handle
Itâs out of control

Donât feed the fire
Itâs too hot to handle
