I walk the city streets and I'm looking for some tushie
I want to feel, I want to touch, and not just some hoochie koochie
9 to 5, half alive, devil in a sheepskin, time to die, the beast is out
I'm going down in sin, I remember shadows, I'm leaving for my grave
Something's in the air tonight, you can smell it all the way

Night Wolf, Night Wolf, burning with desire
Night Wolf, Night Wolf, turn my heart on fire
Night Wolf, Night Wolf, burning with desire
Night Wolf, Night Wolf, turn my heart on fire

I get my kicks, from rock and roll, attracted to sensation
Getting high, going out of control, there's a fire in my soul
I'm a tail right on your tail, looking to get laid
Murder's up, cheap for some, good times going to stay
Hanging in the shadows, I'm looking for some more
Open up your pearly gates, I'm standing at your door

Night Wolf, Night Wolf, burning with desire
Night Wolf, Night Wolf, turn my heart on fire
Night Wolf, Night Wolf, burning with desire
Night Wolf, Night Wolf, turn my heart on fire

Night Wolf, Night Wolf, burning with desire
Night Wolf, Night Wolf, turn my heart on fire
Night Wolf, Night Wolf, burning with desire
Night Wolf, Night Wolf, turn my heart on fire

Turn my heart on fire, turn my heart
Turn my heart, turn my heart
Turn my heart on fire, fire, fire, fire
