It's gettin' so late now, I'm headin' for the city
I've got a date and she's so pretty
Jump in my car and no hitchin' for a ride
Goin' to hit that high speed all the time

Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn
Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn
Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn
Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn

She's got chrome wire wheels, bucketseats made of leather
She's as tough as steel and light as a feather
You feel the power as you touch the petal
She's hot as hell, she's real heavy metal

Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn
Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn
Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn
Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn

She's got plenty of power, she feels real good
Well put together for the neighborhood

Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn
Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn
Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn
Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn

Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn
Are you Ready To Burn, Ready To Burn

Hit the road Jack
