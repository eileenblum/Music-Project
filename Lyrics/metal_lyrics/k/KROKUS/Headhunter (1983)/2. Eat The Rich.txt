I've been down, I've been beat, I've been tossed into the street
Beggin' nickels, beggin' dimes just to get my bottle of wine

Some say life she's a lady, kinda soft, kinda shady
I can tell you life is rich, she's no lady, she's a bitch

They suck my body out, but friend there is no doubt
I'm gonna pay the devil his dues, 'cause I'm sick of being abused

Eat The Rich, Eat The Rich, don't you know life is a bitch
Eat The Rich, Eat The Rich, out of the palace and into the ditch

Steal my money, steal my car, took my woman and my old guitar
Runnin' crazy, runnin' wild, blind alley in my mind

Just can't fight the temptation it's become my inspiration
Gonna get myself an axe, break some heads, break some backs

They suck my body out, but friend there is no doubt
I'm gonna pay the devil his dues, 'cause I'm sick of being abused

Eat The Rich, Eat The Rich, don't you know life is a bitch
Eat The Rich, Eat The Rich, out of the palace and into the ditch

Don't stop me

Eat The Rich, Eat The Rich, don't you know life is a bitch
Eat The Rich, Eat The Rich, out of the palace and into the ditch

Eat The Rich, Eat The Rich, don't you know life is a bitch
Eat The Rich, Eat The Rich, out of the palace and into the ditch

Out of the palace and into the ditch
They suck my body out
