And you know we're livin' every hour, as if it were the last one
Let's stand up to evil powers, in just a second we can be gone
We don't believe in superstition, when by the words we come
And there's only one conclusion, to rid the world of all the scum

Stand And Be Counted, millions together as one
Stand And Be Counted, back to life, livin' through the danger zone

Some people call it revolution, while others, well they just frown
So far away in their illusion, it's our job, let's get it done
I live to taste a sense of shadow, the kind of places we all know
Let's not wait until tomorrow, time is right we gotta go

Stand And Be Counted, millions together as one
Stand And Be Counted, back to life, livin' through the danger zone

Stand And Be Counted, Stand And Be Counted
You know you got to Stand And Be Counted
Come on, come on, come on
I said Stand And Be Counted, alright yeah
I said Stand And Be Counted
Come on, come on, yeah
Stand And Be Counted, yeah
