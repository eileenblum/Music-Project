Across the border and down the plains, the tiger meets the bear
No one is right, no one is wrong, nobody seems to care

They fight for power, they fight for lust, spilling their blood on the dust
A thousand miles without names, fear remains the same

Russian Winter, broken pass, cold winds in the dark
The goose is loose and kills tonight, full moon burning bright

Run for your life, run for your life
Run for your life, run for your life

So the bear and the tiger lost in the snow, Tashkent's far away
To feel the fire, to save the bear, nothing can stand in his way

Five fields of death, it's hard to predict, the battle in the white emptiness
The king on his throne is all alone, will this madness go on

Run for your life, run for your life
Run for your life, run for your life

Run for your life, run for your life, run for your life, run for your life
Run for your life, run for your life, run for your life, run for your life
Run for your life, run for your life, run for your life, run for your life
Run for your life, run for your life, run for your life, run for your life
