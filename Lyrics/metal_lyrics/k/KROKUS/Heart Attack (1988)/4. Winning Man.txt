I've been waiting for so long.
Hand in hand treating wrong.
Sleepless night and dirty lies.
Makes no different if you live or die.

But it's over now.
Just life, I'm winning man.

But it's over now.
Just life, I'm winning man.

I live my life the way I choose.
Satisfy not much to loose.
If you don't feel you'll never know.

Just what I've been going through for so long.

But it's over now.
Just life, I'm winning man.

But it's over now.
Just life, I'm winning man.

It's over now...
I'm going to go for help.
I'm going to change my life.
yea, yea over over over over over now
