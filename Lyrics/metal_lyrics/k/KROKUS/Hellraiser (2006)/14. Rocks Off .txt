No time to hang around
You're always on the move
No time to fool around
Gotta stay fight on the groove
Got a job...
Got a job to do!
People out there beggin'
For your job that's true
Can't stay up late...
Can't sleep too long!
A couple of cool beers on the slate
An' you hurry on back home

9 to 5 existence
A slow commuting distance
Fast food resistance
(Pick up a pizza)
(Another TV dinner)
Goin' down the hole

Gotta get you gotta gotta get your rocks off!
Gotta get you gotta gotta get your rocks off!
'Fore Monday comes
You gotta get your rocks off!
On the weekend...
Gotta gotta get your rocks off!
Yeah!

Found love in the heart of the city
A pretty maid of gold
She gets down to the nitty gritty
You carry her over the threshold

Here come the kids... ha! ha!
No time left for you
Turnin' into a handyman
Lookin' for a screw

[repeat chorus]
