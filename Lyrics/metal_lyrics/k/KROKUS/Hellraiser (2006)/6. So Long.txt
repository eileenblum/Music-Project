Alone...
Been walkin' the road far from home
Used and abused
Rejected by hearts made of stone
Hot blood...!
Shoots through my veins I'm alive
When I look into the mirror
I see man, puttin' up a fight

So long I'm movin' on
Been waitin' too long
So long
I'm movin' on
While I've still got the chance

Evil days
Like rose-thorns stuck in my head
Emptiness
Turnin' my live in to a livin' death
Memories...
I'm holding this shield to my brain
When the night falls...
Don't wanna give in, to the pain

So long I'm movin' on
Been waitin' too long
So long
I'm movin' on
While I still got the chance to start over... Oh!

[chorus 2x]

While I still got the chance to start over...
While I still got the chance!!!
...to start over...
