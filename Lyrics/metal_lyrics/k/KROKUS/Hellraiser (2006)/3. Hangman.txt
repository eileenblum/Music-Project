A beacon, lights in the dark
The poison is deep in her heart
Not one drop of kindness
Fills the world, she's leavin' behind
No flickering sparkle of life
In the bed where she lies

Hangman... Hangman
Don't cover my eyes
Please do your job well
Hangman... Hangman
I'll meet her in heaven
Can't stay in this hell!!!

A rainbow, bursting with light
In the rain, my eyes turn to the sky
Decay and corruption
Fill the void, when the good die young
Her murder they planted on me
But the maker knows, all that should be!

Hangman... Hangman
Don't cover my eyes
Please do your job well
Hangman... Hangman
I'll meet her in heaven
Can't stay in this hell!!!

I can't stand it! I can't stand it!

No flickering sparkle of life
Only intrigue and lies
