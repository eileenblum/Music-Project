Something's happenin' in my life
An' I think it must be love
I can feel that springtime itchy foolin'
Stirrin' up my blood

Guess I'm... high
Yes I'm... high
Guess I'm... high, high
High in you!!!

Got a light hearted dizzy head...mmm
A long long winter's end...ugh!
Gonna get my kicks like the birds and bees
Oh the birds and bees
Just pour a drink my friend

Guess I'm... high... waoh
Yes I'm... high
Guess I'm high... high
High in you!!!

Love will survive
Love will survive

(You know it goes... Everybody knows!!!)

[repeat chorus]

(If there's one thing that keeps me alive)
Love will survive
(A little bit of love and you know I will survive)
Love will survive
(If there's one thing that keeps me alive)
Love will survive
(A little bit of love and you know I will survive)
Love will survive

Thank you!
