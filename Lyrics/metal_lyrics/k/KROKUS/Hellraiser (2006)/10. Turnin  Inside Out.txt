Round and round
I'm' gettin' dizzy
Get me off this carousel yeah!

Don't think don't smoke
Don't laugh don't joke
Gonna take my woman
Drive down the coast
(You can take this job 'n' shove it down to your throat)

Listen to the music
Let my spirit fly
See the stars shine bright
In the open sky

Makin' thunder
Out in the rain
Doin' what I want
No one to complain
(an' I got no shame)
Forget my troubles
Far from town
"Life's a circus
But I ain't your clown"

Turnin' inside out
Upside down
Inside out
Watch me burn
My world around

Don't think don't smoke
Don't laugh don't joke
Gonna take my woman
Drive down the coast
(You can take this job 'n' shove it down to your throat)

Guess the Circus never reached this town!!
