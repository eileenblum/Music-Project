You know I'm not superstitious
No I don't wear no good luck charm
In the morning when I wake up
I reach out... turn the music on
Turn it on!
Everyday the same old story
Freaks on my left! Jerks on my right!

No risk no gain
No fight no glory
Just playin' the game
It's all hunky-dory!

You know I'm not over ambitions
Keepin' it simple doin' no harm
In the night when wild wolves howl
In the cold my baby, keeps me warm
Oh, she turns me on!
Everyday the same old rat-race
Freaks on my left! Jerks on my right!

No risk no gain
No fight no glory
Just playin' the game
It's all hunky-dory!

...take it away

Dance to the music!
[chorus 3x]
