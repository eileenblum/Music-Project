Where are we going? What's on your mind
So full of anger...
It's hard to swallow your pride!

Where are we going? What's on your mind
So full of anger today
I know it's hard to just swallow your pride
Can't make the pain go away

Cold ambition, on the slog
Now you're steppin' on friends
Doomed to be a slave of your own damned job
Dyin' lonely in the grave... yeah

Justice is just
One step from freedom
And it's slippin', slippin' away
Justice is just
One step from freedom
And it's slippin' away... yeah yeah!

What are we doin'? Lord are you blind?
So full of hatred and pain
Loosin' control now you're loosing your mind
And you're just lettin' yourself go to waste!

[Chorus 2x]
