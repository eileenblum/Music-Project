I heard the pourin' rain
Under a blackened sky
I felt a young man's pain
As he watched his mother die

All across the land
Betrayal and illusion
No one to make a stand
Chaos and confusion

Take my love to the sunlight
Till the day turns into dark
Sing my sorrow to the moonlight
Till the sun comes up at dawn

I got down on my knees
An' let the white doves fly
We blew the pipes for peace...
That vanished in the sky

All across the land
Betrayal and illusion
No one to make a stand
Chaos and confusion

Till the sun comes up...
Comes up...
At dawn... wohoo ohoo!
