There she stood
At the edge of my bed
Flowers sweet
In her long long hair
Angel... beckoned me to follow

She took my hand
And spread her wings
Freein' my spirit
From earthly things
Far from the starlight and narrow

Angel of my dreams
Look into my eyes
Tell me we will never fall
Angel of my dreams
Look into my eyes
Tell me we will never fall!

She placed my shaft
On her feathered bow
She aimed high
And let the arrow go
Deep in her ancestral heaven

I could  feel this strong
Celestial force
A natural mystical
Divine source
Flyin' me to a new dimension

[repeat chorus]

Never never never never fall
