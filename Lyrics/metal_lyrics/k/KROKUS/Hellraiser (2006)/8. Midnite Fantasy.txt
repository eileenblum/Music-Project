Come home from work... this empty room
Everyday I'm goin' through the... same old gloom
Come the weekend... loneliness is hard to bear

I'm hanging around... with some old friends
Tryin' my best to amuse myself
With memories of you... killin' my head

Alone in my midnite
Midnite fantasy
Alone in my midnite
Midnite fantasy

Telephone bills eatin' up my pay
'cause I've got to hear you talkin' to me... every day
But you know girl... this is not enough

Only one way to keep me... satisfied
I need to feel your passion, look into your eyes
Hold you close... feel your magic touch!

Alone in my midnite
Midnite fantasy
Alone in my midnite
Midnite fantasy

Only the way to keep me satisfied
Gonna buy me a ticket
Get me on that flight
'cause I need to hold you baby...
Close to my side yeah!!!
