Leave myself, try to come back as something else.
I'll explode.
It itches and crawls.
Drift along, sweep down and I'll cry for help.
Hide until morning comes.
It will all be over soon.
Movements in the unseen
It's the last time
Can't you just prove I'm wrong?
They hide in the dark
Cannot see clear
Can't you just stay with me?
Eyes stay shut
Rabbit-heart speaks loud and clear
Teeth and claws Wishing you were here
Won't make a sound
See them coming through the walls
Left as bait Weigh a thousand pound
All be over soon.
Movements in the unseen
It's the last time
Can't you just prove I'm wrong?
They hide in the dark
Cannot see clear
Can't you just come with me?
All be over soon
Movements in the unseen
It's the last time
Can't you just prove I'm wrong?
They hide in the dark
Cannot see clear
Can't you just come with me?
