Closing time and there you are
Beat in turns... I'm off
I couldn't run, count blows while I'm down
I couldn't run

I felt your touch
Been missing for weeks now
Somethings that are so very hard to grasp

And you are gone
Your voice died in silence
Somethings that are so very hard to

Closing time, I'll leave for you
Screams that reached the shore
I couldn't run, count blows while I'm down
I couldn't run

I felt your touch
Been missing for weeks now
Somethings that are so very hard to grasp

And you are gone
Your voice died in silence
Somethings that are so very hard to

If I could change you know I would
Reaching back through time
I'd risk it all
I'd save you somehow
Like you saved me

I felt your touch
Been missing for years now
Somethings that are so very hard to grasp

And you are gone
Your voice died in silence
Old memories come back to haunt me still
