As silence strikes, just for a minute
Together for a few seconds time
As mourning sweeps
It comes and cleanses
The scent of what you left behind
Candle flickered and blew out
Scorched soul searching through the night
I came to listen
Through oceans depth you're fighting life
These burning bridges
Your life ran by
I caught your light
When no one knows and no one questions
What hides beneath those old scared eyes?
Candle flickered and blew out
Scorched soul searching through the night
I came to listen
Through oceans depth you're fighting life
These burning bridges
Step through, sink slowly out of sight
I came to listen
So many thorns, sleepless nights
These burning bridges
Your life ran by
I caught your light
Cause I came to listen
Cause I came to listen
Your life ran by I caught your light
