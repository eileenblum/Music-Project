Maybe I'll break this heart in two
Hail the ones with nothing left to lose
You thought you were safe inside your nest
I've followed your footsteps, giving you away
I can see you through the fog
Closing time. Don't panic or hit the alarm.
Stay calm.
All adds up, eating from inside
Nerves like snakes
Nothing left to hide
You thought you were safe inside your nest
I've followed your footsteps, giving you away
I can see you through the fog
Closing time. Don't panic or hit the alarm.
Taking aim. I've waited to come here, to see what you look like.
You're just like me. You'll panic and hit the alarm.
Stay calm.
