Stare is blank, lips spore
They speak my name
Who'll be the first to get thrown overboard?
Guess we can stay right here
Try to keep ourselves warm
Cross our hearts and pray
For someone to come and take us home
Hijacked mind comes clean
Speaking through tears
How I dearly wish you were not here
Guess we could stay right here
Try to keep ourselves warm
Cross our hearts and pray
For someone to come and take us home
Who'll be the first to get thrown away?
This ocean will drag you down
I can't lie to myself
Cross our hearts and pray
I'll wait here with you
Going down.
