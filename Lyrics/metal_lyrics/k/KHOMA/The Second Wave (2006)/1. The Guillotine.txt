Guess you can't hear a sound
In the shadows all tied down
Cause these beats dwell
Inside our hearts

Only one thing left to do
I can hurt someone like you
Tear you out for all to
See these lies

Now you sing back to me
In a strange harmony
Head of state facing up
To the guillotine

Give me no choice but this
Give the man in me a lethal kiss
Root you out relentlessly
At last
