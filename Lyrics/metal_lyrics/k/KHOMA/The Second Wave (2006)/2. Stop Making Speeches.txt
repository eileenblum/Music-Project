All accounted for
Marked sheep, sold
Matched and numbered, weak
Downsized, uptight

It's about time

Stop making speeches
We can't hear you
From the bunker bed
It's not like the movies,
Where hatred made clearer sense

This time around
Grey sharks. Down
Betrayed for personal wealth
Twelve feet under ground

It's about time

Stop making speeches
We can't hear you
From the bunker bed
It's not like the movies,
Where hatred made clearer sense

Stop making speeches
We can't hear you
From the bunker bed
It's not like the movies,
Where hatred made clearer sense (clearer sense)
