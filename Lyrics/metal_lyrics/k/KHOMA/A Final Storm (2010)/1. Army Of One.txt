I've nailed history to the wall
Remembering us in a time when all mattered more
Have i gone off? Did i stray too far?
Watch us drift apart as currents grow
It breaks in two
I'll stay, cling on to this army of one
Grew weak. I'll take them on
Man the walls
They've go you nailed to the ground
Stab all we've found
Turn all that's white into red
A fool's commitment
Like a wounded child i won't leave this place i'm from
It breaks in two
I'll stay, cling on to this army of one
Grew weak. I'll take them on
Man the walls
