Numb, feel it spreading
Tear its way through hearts
No one to avenge the fallen
No one to remember our loss

What if I'm in it for fighting?
A lost cause, break it all

Come, stand to face them
You who brought this cold
Lost all that made me feel human
Lost what was rightfully ours

What if I'm in it for fighting?
A lost cause, break it all
What if I'm in it for fighting?
A last call, head to the wall

I'm lying down where you left me
Seconds before it turns dark
All of these dreams that could have been
Pumping, leaving my heart
