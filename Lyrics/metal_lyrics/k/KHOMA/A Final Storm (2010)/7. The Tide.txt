Watch the waves, bring you closer to home
All too silent. A wish to follow the tide
Nailed to your heart, all you've seen
Hear the sea call
Leave. You were never here
Light these candles and run
Leave. It was never safe
Keep all knives out. Head down
Seen you watch from a distance, in tears
As the waves come. Steps all gone now. And you?
Wish to let go
Leave theses shores with no trace at all
