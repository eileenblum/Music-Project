Tell me what went wrong inquisitor
Rest my case. Burn at the stake
The corners of this room, these silhouettes
Leave me here. You'll survive
Hands still search for cracks in darkness
You are through, run and hide
Holding my breath and counting
Hidden beneath too long
Hold on against the tide now
You will be here, and then,
all around. It's time
You will come hold me down
All around. It's time
You will come hold me down
