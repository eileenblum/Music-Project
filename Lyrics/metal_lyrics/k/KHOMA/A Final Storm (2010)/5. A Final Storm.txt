Held your head, felt you leave
As night touched you from inside
Felt the weight of your fears
As night reached in over earth
All of life wrapped in black
As night held on for too long
A tightened grip. You let go to answer
To leave us all
The day all sounds went quiet
Come empty. Haunts us, just can't stay calm
It keeps repeating, coming back
Lower your head, now you hit the ground
Nowhere to hide, a final storm
Nowhere to run to, this is home
In the blink of an eye, all changed
Turn restless winds to storm
Lay to rest by your side. No comfort
You've left us all
