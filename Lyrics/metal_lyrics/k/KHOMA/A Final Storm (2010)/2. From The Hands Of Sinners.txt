As light came, revealed our loss
Scattered on the ground
Words written by the hands of ire
the day you turned on us
As we took it to the streets and lost
Cursing all that ties us
Took it to the streets and bled
Resting in the arms of ...
Dark caves
We fly like stones from the hands of sinners
Words spoken by the tongues in rage
Leaves us in the wind
As we took in to the streets and lost
Cursing all that ties us
Took it to the streets and bled
Resting in the arms of death

You're the one with stones
You'll reap what you have sown
As we took in to the streets and lost
Cursing all that ties us
Took it to the streets and bled
Resting on theÂ ?
