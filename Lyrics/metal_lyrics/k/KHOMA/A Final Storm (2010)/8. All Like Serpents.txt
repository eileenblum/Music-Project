Feel their eyes
Watching, don't make a sound
All like serpents
Silence our voices
Lights go out
Carrying this white flag
Your shoulders are sore
Eyes turn away as they come close
Here they come
Feed on our hope to stay alive
Way too close now
Nowhere to hide, we're out of time
Carrying this white flag
Your shoulders are sore
Eyes turn away as they approach
Speak to the buried
Can't hear what i hear
The dead tells a tale of what to fear
All painted black. Just close your eyes
I'll keep your voice safe throught all
Just speak to me once more
