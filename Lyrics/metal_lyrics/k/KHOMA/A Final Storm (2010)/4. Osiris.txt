And behind me
Behind the pale
All these people without faces
The've been standing here for years
Carrying me inside their shadow
Carrying too much load
Won't carry all this guild on my own
Water runs in
Hidden beneath us. Hidden low
Cannot lift any of these stones
The're lending their eyes
Lending their ears
Carrying me inside their shadow
Carrying too much load
Won't carry all this guild on my own
Water runs in
Sore hands to the wall
Won't carry all this guild on my own
Water runs in
