Innocent? Like any good liar
With all that money, weapons of war
Slit their throat, U.S. vampire
Have you heard?

They can hide everything,
but not the stench of the dead
Inside, so deep
You hide the kids and women

I've seen evil inside your eyes
Breeding hate, truth turns to a lie

Raising hell, capital at war
The only way you can survive
Bring them on, U.S. vampire
Have you heard?

They can hide everything,
but not the stench of the dead
Inside, on our way
The fifth colon is working

I've seen evil inside your eyes
Breeding hate, truth turns to a lie

When this is over we can feel alive
('Cause) I've seen evil inside your eyes

I've seen evil inside your eyes
Breeding hate, truth turns to a lie

When this is over we'll feel alive
I've seen evil inside your eyes
