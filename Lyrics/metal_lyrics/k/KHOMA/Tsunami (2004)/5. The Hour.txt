Making plans for a future that
won't come at all
None of these angels will make up
for the loss that I've caused

This time I'll run from harm
Remember me? Should have broken your fall
If I could stop the clock, consider me
I'll play your part

Friends for a lifetime, lost at sea
Sinking slow
None of these angels will get home
until were close

None of them ever could make up
for the loss of you

This time I'll run from harm
Remember me? Should have broken your fall
If I could stop the clock, consider me
I'll play your part

This time I'll run from harm
Remember me? Should have broken your fall
If I could stop the clock, consider me
I'll play your part

Run from harm
(Remember me? Should have broken your fall)
Stop the clock
(consider me I'll play your part)
