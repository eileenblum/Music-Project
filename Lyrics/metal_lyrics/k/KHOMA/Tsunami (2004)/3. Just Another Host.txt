Tonight I surfaced from deep,
with a new love.
Tonight I roam your house while you sleep.
In search of signs of humanity.

End is getting near.
You'll be the death of us.
Won't even shed a tear.

Tonight I carved straight through your chest,
thoughts came wired.
All that you know, cherish by heart.
Disconnect and fall apart. 

There you go - knife me trough the wall.
There you go - alarms are setting of.
