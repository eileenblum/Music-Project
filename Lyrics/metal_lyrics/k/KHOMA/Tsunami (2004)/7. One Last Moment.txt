Thoughts colliding.
Please don't wake up from your dreams.
See right trough me,
drying tears make me feel alive.
Thoughts colliding.
Any second they'll be here.
You'll have to breath for both of us.
Make sure you stay alive.
Carry our memory with you.
You only wanted me to hide.
Thoughts colliding.
All these visions, one sad mistake.
Hear them panting.
These black skies bring out tears.
You only wanted me to hide.
