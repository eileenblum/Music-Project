Careful with what you're wishing for
They'll lead you down below
Careful with what you're thinking of
Don't want to see you at the end of a rope
Take it one of us must hang
One of us must go
Stand-off is rigged, this trap must close
Take it one of us must hang
One of us must go
Ears are ringing, alarm come near
Careful with what you're speaking of
For how long can you hold your breath?
Careful with what you're dreaming of
They'll hunt you down
Collapsing walls
Take it one of us must hang
One of us must go
Stand-off is rigged, this trap must close
Take it one of us must hang
One of us must go
Ears are ringing, alarm come near
