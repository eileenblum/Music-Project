Here you learn the past was a mistake
Pretending you're still strong
I recall the right to life came dead
You flee and lose control
As the autumn clashes
Somewhere between our greed and desire
Did you fail to question?
Is life worth living when you retire?
You'll keep taking to yourself
In world were humans act as prey
You'd hope to find it here, so alone
All those lost loves long gone
Here you learn the past was a mistake
Can't you hear them call?
As the autumn clashes
Somewhere between our greed and desire
Did you fail to question?
Is life worth living when you retire?
You'll keep taking to yourself
In world were humans act as prey
You'd hope to find it here, so alone
All those lost loves long gone
You'll keep taking to yourself
In world were humans act as prey
You'd hope to find it here, so alone
All those lost loves long gone
