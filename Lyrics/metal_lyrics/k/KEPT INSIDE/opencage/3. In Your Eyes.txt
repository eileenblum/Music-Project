You created a paranoid world on your own
Alone, with a bitter taste of anger
Fed by all the scorn you've undergone
Holding a time bomb they made bigger

Isolated and fearful rat
Prepared, ready to pull the trigger
And put an end to this, you've been waiting for it
At last, your sweetest dreams come true

Allowed to keep and bear the fear inside
Enabling the death toll to rise

Torn are the souls of many brothers,
Many friends, many lovers,
Blind to their pain, deaf to their cries,
Tears in their graves, death in your eyes

So be safe and be brutal
No matter what, just defend yourself
The gun under the pillow
To chase your nightmares away

Terror makes this circle of violence go round
Chicken, did the egg come first?

To the library, to the battlefield
The flame consuming you is gonna burn them down
Distrust spreads the plague

Saw it on the screen
Now you want it for real
Frightened, you fight them
Sniping to kill your pain
