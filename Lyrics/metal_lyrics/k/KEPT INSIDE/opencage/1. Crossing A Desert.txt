You struggle to extend my half life
While I crave only for freedom
But my days are worthless, my nights are dreamless
I'm bound to this bed, crossing a desert

We keep fighting this battle
With no aim at all
Ashes of memories
Scattered with apathy is all that remains

A hopeless heart barely beats
A broken man can't be

Persisting to breathe the same air
Fanning the fire that's burning me

Can't see the puppet below my mind
Can't see the strings, this flesh's no longer mine

We keep fighting this battle
With no aim at all

A hopeless heart barely beats
A broken man can't be
Draw the curtains
The world looks better in the dark

Is that what you call respect?
Is that what you call dignity?
I've become nothing more
Than a locked-in ghost
Is what you call dignity?
I'm nothing more than a locked-in ghost

What you need isn't what I want
Set me free

Feel no guilt for setting me free
Set me free

You can't kill me I'm already dead
The choice is mine
You can't kill me I'm already dead
Set me free
