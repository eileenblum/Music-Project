At ease
Hidden in the dreary shadow of a fake happiness
Living to own,
Forgetting to be.

"Day after day" had trapped you
In its prison of comfort

Your reason never loses measure and control
This life has become an early death

And now you can't remember the face
Of your old friend the "day by day"

Passenger of your own train, staring out the window
No driver inside, just following the line

Confined and suffocating
Step out of your shell and breathe in

Passenger of your own train, staring out the window
No driver inside

You are your choices
Your smiles, your sorrows
You are shaped by your own mistakes

Sometimes you rise, often you fall
But dreams aren't always unreachable

Don't fear your tears, face your fears
Fly, jump, dive, burn, explode
Tremble with joy
As you climb to the top of the mountain
Of your senses
