Here we go, here we go again
Ready to get insane
Let's play our favorite game
And drown our fucking brains
Here we go again
No gun, no knife, no rope, no flame
This is how we kill the pain
And escape into another cage

My evanescent wings grow, once more
The higher I fly, the harder I crash

My chains always bring me down
I fall down in this spiral

We walk slowly towards
Our unavoidable fate
Nothing good may come out of this world
Where happiness is only drinkable

It's half past a bottle o'clock
We've reached a state in which nothing seems impossible
But reality is like a rock
Coming back right to your face, ripping your soul

My evanescent wings grow, once more
The higher I fly, the harder I crash
There is no point to pretend
This is how our torments end

Wow that's awful, where did you get that?
Who cares? Welcome to wonderland!

Everybody get your seat belt loosely fastened
Because the ride may last quite a long time
This will be our home tonight
Let's go for our daily descent into death

The process of self-destruction is almost complete
Can my alarm clock wake me up from it?

We no longer make the rules of this game
We've failed to bury our torments, game over
