In this quiet town, a random man lives
Away from troubles, away from all of it
After a day of work he needs to rest
Thanks for the brainwash, everyday

He's not a genius, though he knows how to read
He's been taught to listen and to eat
He can even swallow every word through his eyes and ears
Thanks for the brainwash, everyday

Looking for the best story to tell them all
To sell as much as possible
Looking for another tarnishing scandal
To spread as much as possible

Now all you can hear is my deep voice
You slowly slide into a deep sleep, don't fight
See, the anesthesia isn't painful

(Rationality belongs to the cool observer
But because of the stupidity of the average man
He follows not reason but faith
The naive faith of the proletarian requires necessary illusion
And emotionally potent over simplifications
Which have to be provided by myth makers
To keep the ordinary person on the right course)

The truth is twisted again
Leading to fear and confusion

They create shock with hasty conclusions
Don't give in to their power of persuasion
They create shock with hasty conclusions
Don't fail to control your own perception
