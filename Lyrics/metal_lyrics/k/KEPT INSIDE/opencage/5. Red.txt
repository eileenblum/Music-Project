[feat. DY]RejetÃ©s car le discours semble plein de haine
Mais sommes-nous Ã©coutÃ©s ?
L'onde qui nous fait tant vibrer est censurÃ©e

Your voice was strong
When our screams weren't loud enough
Your words were wise
But all they did was laugh at us and despise us

Nos Ã©crits, c'est pas d'l'attaque mais du self-defence
T'y as consacrÃ© ta vie, on n'oublie pas cette belle dÃ©pense
C'est pour ceux qui militent jusqu'Ã  leur limite
T'Ã©tais loin des dÃ©lits de l'Ã©lite, des rÃ©cits qu'on Ã©vite
Pour toi on restera entre l'art et l'arme
Entre lettres et lutte, avant l'heure de chute

Nous rÃªvions d'un monde qui encourage la crÃ©ativitÃ©
Et qui n'enterre pas la diversitÃ©

You showed so much passion
You tried to give us perspectives

Your voice was strong
When our screams weren't loud enough
Your words were wise
But all they did was laugh at us and despise us

The keys to unity were in your hands
But couldn't open the mind of the ignorants

No, we haven't forgotten
And we will always remember
Your nerve will be respected forever
No, we haven't forgotten

Our red guardian
An outstanding man
No, we haven't forgotten
