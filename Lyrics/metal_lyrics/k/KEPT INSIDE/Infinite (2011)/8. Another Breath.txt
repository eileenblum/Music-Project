Know that it's never too late
To take your life in hand
Know that it's never too late
To take your life in hand and clean up your soul

In your shell, you're full of anger
You feel you're left behind

But there's no reason for you to be spared
So kneel down, kneel down to the rules

It's not too late
So far this life has seemed so meaningless to you
And I know you can no more hold this
It's not too late

Don't you grieve? Just look around you
Don't you grieve, don't you grieve for what you've done?

But there's no reason for you to be spared
So kneel down, kneel down to the rules

Telling yourself that
There won't be consequences
If there's any balance
Someday you will

You will get what you deserve
For we always reap what we sow

It's lasted for too long
Make up for your mistakes
Make up for your mistakes
Redeem yourself

Take another breath
Tread a safer way to salvation

It's not too late
So far this life has seemed so meaningless to you
(make up for) and I know you can (your mistakes) no more hold this
It's not too late
