You try to lighten your burden
Relying on a maker
But the answers are above
We're lost with no aim

My dreams, my dreams seems so sensible
Everything down there is inconsistent

Alone and silent
I'm losing every perception of truth: Is this real?

Find the answers
And escape from this hell
We won't grow with no roots underneath
So we're

Seeking again the bounds of time and space
But don't deny it : we're locked in our heads

I can't remember how
How I landed on this place

We entered a vicious circle
But can't find the way out

For ages we've strived to open our eyes
And yet, this mist still blinds us

We've failed to anchor our convictions
And we fake to master our existence
We've failed to anchor our convictions
Write down the words of what we can believe in
