Oh, wasting your life wondering about yourself
Look in the mirror, you will find the truth

And you keep pretending to be a man you're not

You fake being a (No one sees)
A man you're not
(The face) the face hidden
Behind the mask of despair

Wasting your life, everything is worthless
You say, you say nobody shall tell you what to feel
But it seems
You're filled with despair

Escape this hell in you
Don't let your doubts, don't let your doubts torture you

Go

Things don't turn out to be what you pretend they are, your selfish pride turns to shame
You're not to blame

And you keep pretending to be a man you're not

The face hidden
Behind the mask of despair

You keep pretending to be
Escape this hell in you. Runaway
