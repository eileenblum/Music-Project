Your words of love still reside
And I'm whispering your name again
Eyes wide open, hold my breath
Haunted by memory, the pain consumes me

This was passion
This was addiction

You've poured this poison, you've poured this poison in my heart
It's spreading in my veins
I'm so broken hearted
Haunted by memory, the pain consumes me

This was passion
This was addiction

I'm still drowning

Still drowning
Cause this everlasting pain consumes me
Sinking in deepest sorrow
My soul is torn

My soul is torn, my soul is torn once more

This is what you've done
And no matter how much you beg for forgiveness

Once more

Will I ever reach the surface?
Will I ever find hope?

This is what you've done
