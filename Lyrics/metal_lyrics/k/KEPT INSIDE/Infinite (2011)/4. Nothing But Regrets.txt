Tell me how could you forget
Every purpose you had?
It seems you're about to break
However still you look so deprived

You can't let go
No, you were not supposed to ruin it all
You used to be so hopeful
No, you were not supposed to sink

You'll stray in misery
Just live with your regrets
Cause there's nothing else left
There's nothing else left

Tell me how could dreams come true?
When you've embraced nightmare
It seems you're about to break
However still you're deprived

Your behavior will make you fall

We can't save you, can't save you from decadence
Your behavior will make you fall

You can't let go

You used to be so hopeful
No, you were not supposed to sink

Listen, how could you let disappointment stand in for hope?
No, no, don't let apathy spread
