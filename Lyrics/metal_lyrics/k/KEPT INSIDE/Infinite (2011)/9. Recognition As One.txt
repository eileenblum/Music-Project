Recognition as one

What's the point, what's the point trying to
Value yourself in relation to me
When there's no comparison to make
To move forward

I need to go the distance between us
And free myself from your influence

I am I with my weakness and my strengths
I am I so

Can you just stop spitting your venom on me

To what extent are we the same?
I'm just trying to, trying to differ from you

Why are you stealing everything
I've tried hard to make my own, to make my own?
