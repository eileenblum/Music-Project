You think you know me well
Trusting in appearance
You think you can judge me
You only trust your prejudice

This is me

Everything I keep inside
All the hatred I hide
Now I scream into your face
Hear my soul scream

Try just to know me well
Who are you?
Who are you to criticize?
Who are you to judge me now?

This is me

Everything I keep inside
All the hatred I hide
I should spit onto your face
To show all my rage

Now you look down on me, you feel so powerful
You feel so powerful

But I don't give a shit, you mean nothing to me

You think you know me well
This is me
