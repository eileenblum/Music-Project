The impossible, the unfeasible has become
My deepest obsession
Trying hard is all I have to reach my goals

I'd
Never forget that everything is possible

This is what you've taught me
Don't give it up
Believe in your dreams
Keep that in mind

Haven't you noticed yet ?
There's no truth to find from these deceptions
The only person standing in my way
Is me

I'd never forget that everything is possible
Never forget
And I take the blame
For what I become

This is what you've taught me
Don't give it up
Believe in your dreams
And in yourself

You don't need to say it again
Yes I know I must show myself how strong I am

I must fight the weights against me more than ever
Now it's time to feel the power hidden inside

Dig me up from my mental grave
Help me to work out this chaos
Dig me up from my mental grave
Remind me where my strength lies

Where my strength lies
Remind me where my strength lies

There's only one step between failure and achievement
