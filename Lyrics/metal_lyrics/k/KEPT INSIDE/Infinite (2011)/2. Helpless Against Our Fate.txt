Yeah, can't you feel something escaped our will?
Look at the lives we're leading

Once more it seems everything
Everything we undertake is out of control

We believed in such depraved lies, and now we wander as doomed souls

Helpless against our fate
Can't you feel something escaped our will?
Helpless against our fate
Look at the lives we're leading

Now the truth bursts in your eyes
Making its shape out so clearly
You know there's nothing you can do
We're all running to a dead end

We believed in such depraved lies, and now we wander as doomed souls

It starts to fall apart
Something we've always trusted
That we know can't be checked
It starts to fall apart

Can't you feel something escaped our will?
Look at the lives we're leading
