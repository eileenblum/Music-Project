How they produce such a lasting effect, it's not hard to understand; Just unfortunate. Talk about shattered confidence. Heaving forward in quiet desperation: these are mere fronts; Productive, but fronts nonetheless. Anything to stop my mind from wandering; Anything to keep you out. It's mostly a lesson in toque that applies under these circumstances. The ol' guess and test; A torturous process, as it's proved historically to wear on the patience of this rambler. One line on an empty page: "When can any of this be changed?" When these spiteful pieces of you won't come back down and time stands still. This has been a trap for far too many years. We've seen others abandon ship; But we'll follow this one to the bottom it seems.
