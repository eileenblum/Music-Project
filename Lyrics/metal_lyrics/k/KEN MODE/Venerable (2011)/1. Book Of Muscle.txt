I've been spreading myself thin again and very little is getting the attention it fully deserves. There are several causes for this strain and half the time I'm doing my best to arrange their conclusion: But how effective van half-mast truly be? How about we brood a little more? Every time my mind wanders, I sink a little further. Scratch that scab that I'd so dearly wished would just become a scar. I suppose it's those figurative bats that keep swinging mat my head that's preventing my escape. It's a long road that's been chasing me. While that knife goes into my brain... Bur I'll swing a little harder. I'll run a little faster. I've got the tools: I just need to use them.
