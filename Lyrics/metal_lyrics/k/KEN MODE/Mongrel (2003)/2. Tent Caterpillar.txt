It's a constant humanity overhaul. Clear cut, and cut to fit. Wild cries of purity deafened and drowned out by the bellows of domestication: control. Steady flowing lights pouring through the night sky, running down the drifters of this "empty darkness". Urbanization and industrial manipulation, bleeding the sphere of its life creating pride, bleeding it of life. Imagine redemption....Covering its surroundings like nets; a blanket of life. Consuming what we take for granted....Yeah if only that were true. But the cocoons haven't changed a thing, nor will this arthropod. We'd all like to believe that it takes only one solution to solve the problem. But the truth is dedication and work. I guess naturalism has become passe.
