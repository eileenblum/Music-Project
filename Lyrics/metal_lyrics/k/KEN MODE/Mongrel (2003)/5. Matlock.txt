It's a psychological lash-back this time blaming sex. It's not your fault, but inevitably you will pay for the mental obstacle course of adolescence. Subject to subject, you will be used and discarded. Empathy is for the weak. You'll wait and let it destroy you, never realizing your insignificant roll in this most eloquent scope of narcissistic grandeur. Warrior of the broken hearted, taking redemption past its boundaries, entering the realm of the obscene. You spent that last breath on something never said. That situation left for dead. Breaking their will isn't hard. Neither is leaving them dead inside. Feel lucky, it isn't everyday someone is born a god. I feel lucky, because I found I am my own god. You belong to me my dear.
