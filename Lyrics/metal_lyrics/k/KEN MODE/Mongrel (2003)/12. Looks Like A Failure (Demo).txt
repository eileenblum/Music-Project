There are times when that stimulus just isn't there. This is one of them. This information just isn't getting through this troubled smokescreen. Trivialize what I have accomplished to rationalize your shortcomings. Disregard dedication and desire and explain it with shallow rhetoric. You call self-actualization your explanation. Take a look at yourself. Using dogma to suppress the overwhelming realization of the inevitable consequences of your actions. Try to take me down a notch. Make me petty. Create the "illusion" that you have me beaten; that I am weak. What face will you put on in a few months? When this one is tired and bled? Too many experiments I wish I never took part in. Continually creating monsters that must be quarantined. I'll turn my back this time. Looks like a failure from the start. I'm just too tired to deal with it anymore. Totally consumed by this overwhelming exhaustion. Looks like a failure.
