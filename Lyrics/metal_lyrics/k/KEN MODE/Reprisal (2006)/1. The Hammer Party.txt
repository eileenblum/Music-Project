How many of you are wasting your time? Self-gratification becomes the norm, with a total disregard for taste. My problem lies within this concept. A fundamental lack of respect exists and is far too apparent. A lack of control; of tact; of class. This is the issue I'd like to address; and ram down your fucking throat. People volunteering for enemy positions on a halo effect. Let ignorance be your guide straight to living hell my friend. Claiming democratic process is an insult to the history of such a concept; a selfish cop-out, pinning down another scapegoat. Just pray to your god that the tables don't turn. When the power's in these hands we won't even attempt to disguise the slap in the face coming your way the way you have time and time again to us. Like a hammer smashed clichÃ©. Don't instigate a preview. When I lose control; what will be left of your date-raped fantasy?
