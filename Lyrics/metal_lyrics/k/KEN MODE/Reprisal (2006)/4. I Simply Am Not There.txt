Taste is something that's, more often than not, taken for granted; but not by me. Dressed to the nines and ready to roll, with the creativity and overwhelming drive to bury your aspiration-less life. I'm looking down on you; don't forget: I'm watching you and judging. You're convinced I think I'm better than you, well you're wrong; I know I am. Nothing sells love like a mace. These tin snips will solve my problems; it's the perfect setup for the perfect coward. You were so busy vilifying me as a self-assurance; you never saw it coming, now it's too late. Coward, you'll know my face, as it's the last you'll ever see.
