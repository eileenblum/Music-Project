You've become so neutered and weak. Apathy can be a two way street; once yours, now belongs to me. Though it would be unfair to dismiss this as such; as this tastes much more like spite to me. You cut the rope and watched the boat drift away. This is a dark place. The air is stale, everything aches and sentiments are set to the quintessence of contempt. Perhaps these walls have transformed themselves into the very prison that they used to contest; from sanctuary to death row cell. Our allies vanished: weakened and fallen; the horizon stained grey by their ash and the rules of the battle we are not able to see. Proditio.
