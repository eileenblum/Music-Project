You move with such elegant authority; with the kind of power that could end wars and crush the most driven of egos. From a sea of a thousand faces, your eyes shined through with such beauty and charisma. Attitude, intrigue; desire. I am powerless in approach. This time, on a whim, a lone flare fired off that ledge into evident purgatory, assumed lost, but returned with playful curiosity. I'd never be the same again. These words have struggled to reach the surface; as their previous purpose was spitefully driven: the sole existence bent retribution. This frustration melted away with a tingling of my nerves; straight down my spine. Living for that smile; those piercing eyes. When just the thought of being next to you separates the clouds and gives colour to this world. There's nothing like this; nothing like you.
