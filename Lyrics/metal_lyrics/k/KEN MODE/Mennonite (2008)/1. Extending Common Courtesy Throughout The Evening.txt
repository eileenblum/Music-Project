Don't worry about me, I'll be just fine. Continue the seduction, as we're running short on time. Or is this just the beginning of your systematic accord? A penchant for twisted luck, with a hum in my vocal chords. I'll raise my glass to vanity and all its subtle delights in this dwindling hour, as the audience is spent and setting their clocks to waking arms. Hold that thought as I'll be with you in the morn'. Seize the day, but lose the girl; working this curse to the bone. Never forget what you live for.
