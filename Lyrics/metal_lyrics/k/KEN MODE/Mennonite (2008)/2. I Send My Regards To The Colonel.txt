The jack of all trades. This is lust; and this is good. You've raised a prize fighter, a risk taker. They call me the million dollar species. Brought back there through their faces: insincere smiles and baited laughter; surrounding us like vultures waiting for that last leg to give. Your point is driven home with force. They want me to move mountains in a little red wagon; squeeze blood from a stone. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. How can I thank you? I cannot thank you enough for this. Smile for me?
