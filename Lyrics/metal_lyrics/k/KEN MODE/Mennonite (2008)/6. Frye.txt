Feed me this massive impact. I've got my hat on, my shoes tied tight; I'm as ready as I'll ever be. I'll wager my shins beat your fists; but that's not the battle you had in mind, was it? Either way, I'm not impressed, and I don't play to lose. My guard is down; eyes focused; stance strong. Oh was it worth it? Maybe not, but I'll go down swinging as hard as I can.
