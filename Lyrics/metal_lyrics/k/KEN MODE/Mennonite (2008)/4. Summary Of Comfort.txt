Once again recycling our muffled foray. Terse to a fault, and carelessly wavering on that fine line where hallucination becomes reality through relentless obsession. Believe the hype. Believe what you felt. Turn the clock sideways and frolic in this inhibition; just don't doubt its rare nature. You've lost your way and I'm left hoping that you'll come back, through this calloused door shut; an icy burn. A poor hand dealt under unchosen circumstance. Within the struggle lies. Like grinding gears and insect flesh; imagery devoid of light. This is where I am lost without you. I know I'll never be the same again.
