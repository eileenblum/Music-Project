When you've got that beat in your head and you can't stop can't stop can't stop. Rolling: hot, sweating, absent to all but one, and fixated beyond all comprehension. This is it and you're all that exists; and you feel it too. This magnitude: more than mere attraction, but an epitome of passion - that words are incapable of describing and unhinges your very essence. And we'll bask in its intense rays 'til waking hours when I'll meet you on the other side of bliss; hoping that we'll never awaken from this insanity. It's our shared catharsis.
