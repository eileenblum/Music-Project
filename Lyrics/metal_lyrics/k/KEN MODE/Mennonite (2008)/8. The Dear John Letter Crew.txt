I'm unloading, and I'm bored as hell. We've been travelling westward for several days and we've hit that place where your mind flies free through all insecurities and false hopes. This heat just keeps on burning. Oh my brothers, do you feel this curse? That one that takes us all? This lost cause can't be dropped that simply; my guard's been down and I'm on my knees. I'm feeling naked, lately and I am in pain: wait till they get a load of me; nothing earned, nothing gained. But we'll continue to pour sweat into what we believe, and take them all by force. This is uncertain, but at least it's rooted in reality.
