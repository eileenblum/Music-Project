A day when southern Manitoba could not be more sublime: âGodâs good blessing to you my friend!â

A freshness unparalleled, with budding leaves, a gentle breeze, rays of the sun bleaching my soft hair. The first insects of the season, zipping about in the usual exuberance that they might convey if they had human emotions. Bird calls ring through the air, a symphony
of ambience. I sit, lounging in patio furniture, plaid shorts, a short tee, absorbing all that is before me. These illusions pay no mind to the shaking of my nerves. IâveÂ  recently been sent here to tell you that your story is not a good story at all: the all-natural
fuckeasy. Â Well Iâd rather be a whore, than a slave: this is an illusion of despair.
