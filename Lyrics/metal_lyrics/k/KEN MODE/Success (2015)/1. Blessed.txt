We can play this game a little bit longer, but we all know we're not really welcome here. Handfuls of proverbial shit tossed over and over against that same proverbial wall, willing heads mashing it in; this stubborn battering ram of perpetual loss. Thank you for
humoring it, though nobody should condone this. We're blessed. That enraged feline knows what's coming one last time before our place is set back behind that big black desk. A walking parody in black jeans and the seventy mile strut. There's something to be said for that
old underdog tale of woe; but very rarely do the full stories fulfill your hearts desires. We're blessed.
