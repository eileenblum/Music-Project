What was the last thing youâve done that mattered? A loaded question but does any of it hold any weight? Always clearing the path of the past: a nice day for a walk to the end. Hot blooded; a chaos ruling my veins.
Down. Drawn. Dust.
This afternoon soundtrack to annihilation; I sit here alone, listening to the crashing of waves against the run of a strong current. All is so still. When the laughter stops, and Thereâs no fitting end.
Always clearing the path of the past. A nice day for a walk to the end.
