I would like to learn how to kill the nicest man in the world; make him feel uneasy, make him feel strange. I am that scholar of spite and I am that top fiend: change my life you handsome terror; cover me with your sin, I don't want to be clean.
Hard drugs in the sex ads, its the tale of the desperation of men. No let him be teased, this experimental girl needs a casual flex now and then. Well where is Cade's mom? I've been faking my way as I roam. the pit boss granted you true love in your lap, now take it back
home
And when we all lose; this certainly was not well planned. And then we all lose: pointless negativity on demand.
I would like to learn how to kill the nicest man in the world; make him feel uneasy make him feel strange; value propositions clearly unfurled. Can we trust that the true goth strikes inward? Fairy-tale love just isn't for you. In the end, as long as you're having fun;
which we're not - this damnation's for two. The macho man's lips, it's like a lunar eclipse; Iâve been shifting in my skin while you're been shaking your hips. we can talk 'til the break of dawn, but Iâll be rolling down the highway while the point's past gone. And when
we all lose - the heart is beyond repair. And then we all lose; there is no heart, there's only despair.
