The most simplistic way is to pretend that everything is A-Okay, Â though Iâve been failing at fun since nineteen eighty-one so can you taste me please? This story has so many dead pets;
They canât feel your touch.
It could be worse, because youâre good at sex, I just donât care all that much. Like a prairie mountain â itâs a garbage hill. Hot salad for the eater of hair, itâs a void you just canât fill.
Yeah, yeah, this forever; and we all lose, why donât you show me sometime?
