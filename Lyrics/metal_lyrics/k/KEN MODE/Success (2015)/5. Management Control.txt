Itâs a luck that matters. Did you enjoy your walk through the moonlight? I cut out those letters, fastened them to the concrete oh so tight. âWhere does money come from?â the conversations within are far more interesting than your petty agenda against sin. We lived in a
privileged world; use it for something we believe in. Iâd rather confess to the girls in the brother. And (we) walked along our usual path, focusing on something much less awful; like the relationship between things, itâs all a matter of change. The divine proportion,
itâs the physical rhythm â much like a dance â memories accumulate, the recent ones float to the top and the others fade away. Itâs a luck that matters.
Seeing a face might bring them back, reality transcending imagery; the movement of a man in relation to his inner self; his absolute being. Playing his true self, like shaking an outstretched hand. Itâs a luck that matters. Management control.
