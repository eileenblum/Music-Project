I thought Iâd learn, but Iâm an idealist. I thought Iâd wait, but I deserve it. How about we go out of our way to complicate the process? Thereâs a certain thrill to this strategy, no matter how idiotic it may seem. Letâs blur the lines until the flames drown in wax and
thereâs nothing left to give/take. I want it: all. This close to dawn I'll relinquish to a single word. I refuse to live like I'm alone given this framework. Give me a sign that I'm not simply being absurd. I've stumbled through years on broken time to reach such
conclusions. These are the promises of god.Â
