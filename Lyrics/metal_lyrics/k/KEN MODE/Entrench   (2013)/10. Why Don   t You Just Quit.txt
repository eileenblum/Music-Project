Have to keep my words close; keep them safe and succinct. So much has changed, but I canât tell just how thoroughly. Maybe this ice age is reaching its twilight and weâre reading too far into the damage done - maybe there is still hope; maybe this is ridiculous.

Expression is suicide, admittance: sure death. Granite to steel, familiar bookends to this chronically distorted heightened perceptive state. I hate this hell; this is weakness, this is forfeit.
