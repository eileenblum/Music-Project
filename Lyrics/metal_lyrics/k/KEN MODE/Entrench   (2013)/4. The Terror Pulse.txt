Iâm not playing. Logic keeps me bound; keeps the pieces in check, and every beginning has its orchestrated conclusion. This is a lack of everything that was claimed to have stood for. A lack; skittering and unapologetic: within the eye of the storm, taking refuge in
small comforts; easy answers. Playing Judas and shirking accountability. A serious lack. That was wrong, it wasnât okay and no, Iâm not okay. This is goodbye to the man you once knew. Or did not; it doesnât matter anymore.
