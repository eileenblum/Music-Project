The odds are not in our favour.
Thereâs little hope left.

What optimism existed has been strangled to the very last breath.Â  Shuddering on strangers floors at 5 am; focus a shattered mess near the litter box that this apartmentâs aroma resembles far too clearly; allies become foes in the blink of an eye.

But This
Wonât
End.

Augment me.Â  Cut out the poison; detach from chaos; pacify desire; quell instinct;

But donât
Quit.

Too many hours logged, too many miles conquered, too many grey hairs.

Too much love to let go.
