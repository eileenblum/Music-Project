âPoor baby boy, is that a negative spell honing in like a loaded black cloud set to burst? Hang in there for just one minute while I trivialize your emotion, your motivation, your hopes, your dreams.Â You cannot feel ire, you will not shed tears. A lesson to learn: as
long as there's pain, as long as there's fear you should feel ashamed of every instance of indignation youâve ever felt. As long as you are male, you donât deserve this un-fulfillment. Your pigmentation disallows your choler.â

Iâd like to thank you for the speech youâve delivered from your condescending high-horse, like youâre the only one thatâs lived; traveled; experienced destitute from an elevated Maslowian bubble. Youâre smarter than this, and human psychology is more complex than you
prefer to credit. But I wonât argue. Iâm not seventeen anymore.
