I feel like something profound and meaningful should be espoused from this platform; words wise beyond their years - a message of some purpose or consequence. There is nothing. I pretend to dig deep, but the words are passionless, derivativeâ¦the sentiment is painfully
hollow. Slumped over in a chair once hoped forgotten, facing enemies passed as quick fixes to greater, deeper set issues. Suitable diction proves elusive â as my mind dances like a mongoose âround a cobra - but Iâll bury broken muses; my own hidden Burgess Shale. Pull up
another black hood, warming my cold weathered hands, curl up in lose fit flannel and self-preserve.
