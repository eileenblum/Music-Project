Help me limp through the hour where the last remnants of my sanity are plagued by the burden of consequence. Encourage focus from chaotic despair; focused indifference; focused repudiation. Frustration, not chaos, reigns.Â  I am the weapon to usher in your destruction: I
am control; I am command. This is for the survival of the fittest; repercussion be damned âa tradition of bridge made ash. Letâs break this situation down like an old world primate; driving the point home more poignantly: this simply will not stand. My brain turns to a
dry porous sponge as the broken record skips; reminders of just how loathsome youâve become. No; I am in control.
