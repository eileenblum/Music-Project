[Part C - Regression - 5]

[Anjaan:]
"What is this place?
I feel new powers in me
I see a face
Thoughtfully watching me
Who are you?"

[Keiji:]
"I am Keiji
And this is my domain
I have to say
That I cannot explain
How you are here, why you are here
It doesn't matter now
Out of your cell, I cannot tell
We'll soon awake again"

[Anjaan:]
"What do you say?
I feel you're lying to me
I see your face and your smile
Trying to deceive me

My cell?
You are so misled
Oh this is your cell
And here you'll stay
In your cell
You are here to stay
I don't believe in you
This is not true"

[Keiji:]
"I have lived many lives in what you call a cell
I have seen much more things your eyes could never bear
I've cried at the sunset and I've smiled at the moon
Heard the birds and the rivers dancing, have loved and didn't forget
I am immortal, yet I am sick
My mind, trapped for ages, a prisoner of my cells"

[GoD:]
"Anjaan/Keiji, I sense intrusion again
Abnormal allocations in my brains
A shapeless being has entered Haven
By its behaviour, it seems alien"

[Royth:]
"Hi... I come in peace; I'm here to help you...
Who are you? Can you understand me? Can you hear me?...
Dokkh! Is there any way to communicate? It doesn't seem hostile...
I'm here in peace, I'm here as a friend
I'm here in peace, I'm here as a friend
I'm here in peace, I'm...
... here as a friend"
