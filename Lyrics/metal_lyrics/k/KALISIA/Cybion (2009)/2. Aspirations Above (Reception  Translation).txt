Year 2024.
Life on Earth has reached a new stage, and advances in technology and global networks complexity have finally revealed to mankind its true status: we're cells of the Cybion.

Cybion's neuronic network has been ridden by The Pheonix wings
The whole world knows
Now the mystery's over

The greatest scientists of the Earth
Spent a year trying to solve
The meaning of this note

[Cybion]:
"We're not alone
Here in the night
We will find a way
Find a way
Fly away"
