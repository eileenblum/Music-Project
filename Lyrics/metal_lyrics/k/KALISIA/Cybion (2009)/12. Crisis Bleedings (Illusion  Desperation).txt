[Part C - Regression - 2]

[Anjaan:]
"Life
Flowing waterways
My life is like a game
I am so happy with my life
Today's another day

Where the rules are so unreal
I can fly in the sky, walk among the clouds
I can go deep down underseas of high into space

I can change my skin
I can do everything
There's no distance
There is no rule I can't break
What my mind creates it gets
All this is so real"

[Keiji:]
"No this is not real
All this is just fantasy
Our lives
Are so useless

I can't bear it anymore
This has to come to an end

I am the only one that has the power
To make it all stop now

I am so lifeless
We will never be found

Our lives are so useless
I can't bear it anymore
I am the only one
To make it all stop now

To set my people free from their cells themselves
So I have to fathom GoD"
