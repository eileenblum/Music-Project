[Part B - Elevation - 1]

[Stephanie &amp; Keiji]:
"So how does it feel to see all your friends and relatives grow old and die around you?"
- "It's hard at first. But you learn to live with it, and detach yourself from others."
"Can you really learn such things?"
- "I thought so..."
"Immortality...  I wouldn't like it."
- "Why not?"
"I'd rather die than live alone."

End of the twenty-second century.
Breaking the oath of the Circle of Immortals, Keiji decided to meet the girl he'd been thinking about for years.
Too long has he been alone.

[Keiji]:
"The pain from the past is left behind
I'll break free from these chains that hold me back

My lonely empty shell became plural
Flooded with your essence
I now truly feel immortal
Emptiness no longer fills my hollow existence
Now we are one

My heart is smiling, I'm in love
A spark in Nature's alchemy
She transcends stars and shines above
Oh, Stephanie"

For years, Stephanie and Keiji live together secretly, hiding from the world.
But as the years were passing by, Stephanie was getting older, while Keiji was not.
But their inequality before time wasn't going to be an issue anymore
Slowly, Stephanie was fading...
Disease was about to take her
A cell rebellion... cancer...

[Keiji]:
"No!

I can't let her die this way
There has to be another way

I am not ready for you to leave me now
Ecoute-moi
Je prendrai soin de toi"

[Stephanie]:
"I am dying
I'm feeling darkness all around me Keiji
Only you can save me with nanotechnology".
