[Part B - Elevation - 4]

Keiji then learns about his rescue fomented inside the Circle itself and has now to decide what to do: to escape death, he must leave the Earth... forever.

[Keiji:]
"To go into exile, banished from my own planet.
Treated like a criminal, when all I ever did was guided by love.
Ha, Love...
Such a destructive feeling.
What have I become because of love?
What has happened to her?
Did she only knew how the events turned out?
Did she die, lying in her bed, thinking I've betrayed her?
Will I ever love again?

I've got nothing left here anymore...
Nothing to hold on to, no one to cherish nor to shelter.
All I have now is my so called humanity."
