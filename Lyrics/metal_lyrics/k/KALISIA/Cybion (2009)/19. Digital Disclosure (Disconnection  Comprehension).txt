[Part D - Extinction - 4]

Into Haven
Royth has entered...
The dark!

[Royth:]
"Beauty, complexity
Of this heaven
Which seems frozen

Walls are closing around me
I cannot move, I cannot see
A strange voice is talking to me
Words that I don't understand

[Anjaan &amp; Keiji:]
"Who are you? Where are you coming from?
You are new to this world, thou shalt speak anyhow"
- "He is from the outerworld
- Coming to rescue us"
"From what?"
- "He is our awaited Messiah
- Coming to take us home"

[Anjaan:]
"Home? I am home!"

But Anjaan doesn't understand Royth's explanations about the dry desert planet outside, this cold universe, this dying sun.

[Anjaan:]
"What is your real world? Could mine be all just fantasy?"

Accepting Royth's proposal, Keiji and Anjaan are disconnected from Haven and awoke in the real world.

[Dokkh:]
"Welcome on board young friend
We hope you like your mortal frame
Out of Haven you now see
What is reality"

[Keiji/Anjaan:]
"My mind is so confused"

[Keiji:]
"I understand now, when we left Earth
We have travelled through time, but did not fold space
We have been thrown to a far future now at the end of time"

[Kreis:]
"Now at the end of time,
The countdown to extinction of life
We are afraid of the darkness"

[Anjaan:]
"Come, into the light..."
