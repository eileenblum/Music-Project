[Part D - Extinction - 5]

Before they enter Haven again, Keiji looks at the sun, and cries

[Keiji:]
"Finally my time has come
I say goodbye to this life
May my travel lead me to serenity"

[Kreis:]
"Final breathes of our God
End of time, end of all life
Make our travel sweeter to eternity

Final breathes of our God
End of time, end of all life
Make our travel sweeter to eternity"

[Kreis &amp; Keiji:]
"Final breathes of our God"
- "We have lost our future"
"Testimony of humankind
Early glorious episode"
- "Over time and nature"
"Your history is far behind"

Far behind
