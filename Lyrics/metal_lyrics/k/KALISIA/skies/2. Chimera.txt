Rising from nowhere on the horizon
Do not be deceived by her call
Its divine chant is an illusion
The siren's beauty is hiding the evil

Loosing their essence beneath appearance
People of this lie obscure your conscience
Glowing chains &amp; rings however stay cold
Only the blind ones will be dazzled

The weak are misled
Their minds are dead

Artificial exterior
Simulated behavior
Pretension
Presumption

Artificial exterior
Simulated behavior
Hallucination
Imagination

Pain overwhelms the deceived mortal
As he bites the poison inside the apple
The weak will never make the difference
Between the fancy and the essence
