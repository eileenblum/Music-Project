Tower ! Tower ! Rising high
In the deepness of the sky
Object of the human pride
Mankind you will divide

Mankind ! Purblind ! Can't you hear
Storm &amp; might that you should fear
Only meant to built a shrine
Your slaves will be chastised

(Presumptuous men always try to rise to the sky, seeking power.
They can't realize they are but men.
Every stone added to their creation takes men higher in the sky,
but further from reality)

Vanity, has taken control of your mind
Inanity, rules a perennial strife

Can't understand, don't listen anymore
Harmony's lost, confusion blurs the world

Turris caeli, Gloria

Tower ! Tower ! Shades of light
Burning dark sight in the night
Object of inhuman pride
Worship is left behind

(Arrogance and vanity steer the weak toward strength, money and power.
They no longer care about their spirit.
They wanted to rise a temple devoted to the greatness of God,
but conceit diverted them from their aim)

Do you think you can - scale the sky
Do you think you will - by material ways

Renewal of the rent primordial axis
Wholeness of the three worlds: heavens, earth, underground

Can't understand, don't listen anymore
Tyranny, frost, delusion lies the world

Volition is a mark left by the Lord on his creation, an unhindered absolute power.
But without any external control, as resulting from individual thoughts,
this power becomes endless, 'cause always free.

What do you think you can't be
When even God can't change your mind ?

Still you don't understand, scattered and confused
Locked in yourself, you don't listen anyway

Anyway
