Somehow all these dreams will come to life
from my mind
projecting thoughts
this won't be for nothing
now, what is this purpose that I seek
speak to me now voices
your chorus of creation
so many worlds
so many galaxies
soon the worlds will quake at the whisper of my name

master
masterful mutation
all will
all will become one,

now
this won't be for nothing now
what is this purpose that I seek
speak to me now voices
your chorus of creation

amalgamate these creations from my mind arise
powers beyond the comprehension of all mankind

watch as the churning of the cosmos pulls everything into the void
all will become one
with a power of unconquerable strength
levitation, fucking anything
fearful to all, who stand opposed
this is my fate, judgment and be now past down
diligent sentinel, never wavering from my task

at the wake of the dawn
as the dust settles upon the fallen
I shall stand above then in repose
praying for war,

this will be the end

this won't be for nothing now
what is this purpose that I seek
speak to me now voices
your chorus of creation

amalgamate these creation from my mind arise

this is, this is my own salvation
sacrifice, all that I have sacrificed
