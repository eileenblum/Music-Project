These savages stood no chance.
Fire and thunder erupted as I eclipsed the sun.
And the blood of the innocent, oh how it did run. The smell so toxic.
I must indulge in just one.
No time yet they must hunted gathered herded.
Object of terror I force my will upon them.
The flash of my blade that leaves their children dead.
Will see them fall to their knees slaves to my sadistic fantasies.
And I'm still hungry.
Gather the dead for I must feast on these flesh bodies still dripping with fluids.
Erect a monument, a testament, to the one god-king to be worshiped.
A tree the height of fifty men, toiled endlessly and adorn by bones.
These people I have slaughtered and consumed.
Hail to the usurped heavenly throne.
Gore bathed soil.
Sifting through the blood of their families.
Fear of being the next one to be boiled and disgustingly slurped down my chin.
Will be the next of your kin.
A monument of subjugation
Obey me or suffer eternally
Confluence of flesh constructed
With haste

A desperate attempt to
Appease and delay their fate
To stave my wrath one more day
Such pitiful ignorance

Unquenchable appetite never sated
The end to all
Is in sight

Carving a totem pole atop blood mountain whilst enslaving the local mountain folk population as cattle
