Master of the stars
Come forth and embrace us in black
Impurity enshrined
What we sow we now shall reap.

Sorceress divine,'neath blue seas of woe
Engulf us in your wake

Morality in flames
Jester of the sands bide your time
The seven seals align
Worlds fall as oceans rise

Behind our soulless masks
The shadows dance on our graves.
