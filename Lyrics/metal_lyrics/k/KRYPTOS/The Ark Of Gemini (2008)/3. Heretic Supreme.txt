One with your mind
Denounce the robe
See through the false
And reclaim your soul.

Rip off the masks
Wade through the blind
Wash away the grey
And you'll see the light

Never to be seen
Never to be heard,ever again
One with the stars
I am.... Supreme.

Confront the truth
Deny the lies
And taste the bittersweet grapes of wrath.
