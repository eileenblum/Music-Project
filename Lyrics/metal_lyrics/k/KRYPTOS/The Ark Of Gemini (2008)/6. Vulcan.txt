Through centuries forgone,
And ages beyond time,
Burning through the heavens
A poisoned gift for all mankind

Ready the force for battle
Blood, iron and steel
Invoke the secrets of fire
Shadows upon the oaken wheel

Stoke the furnance of truth
Rekindle the desire and sin
For i am the amoral
The hammer on mortal free will

Through centuries forgone
And ages beyond time
Burning through the heavens
A poisoned gift for all mankind.
