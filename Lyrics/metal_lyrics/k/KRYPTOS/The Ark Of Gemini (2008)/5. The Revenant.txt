Welcome the sinners
Let them remind us of what they've done,
Hold back the screams,hold back the dreams,
Hold back the tears,forever forlorn.

Nothing is sacred
Nothing is real
Deceit is law

Fight through the pain
Fight to the end
For we are one.

A symbol of solace,a symbol of power
The battle is won
Never give up, never give in,
Never betray, for we are one.

Ride, into the night on chariots of fire
Usher their ends with glistering steel
Chatter the heavens with cries of the damned.
Vengeance!inferno! blood of the weak

Never give up!
Never give in!
Never betray!
We are one!
