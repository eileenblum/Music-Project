Born in flames we all fall from grace
Never known and never seen
Suffer loss.. fade to grey
Drinking the wine of what might have been

Shroud of sin our shroud of faith
Blind us now from our virtue's face
Spilling blood in the name of our god
Seven is your day of loss

Walk through halls of shattered realms
Cloaked in echoes of empty words
Empty thoughts bear empty deeds
Drink the wine of what should have been

Caged by walls of blackened gold
Trade your heart for an empty soul
Architects of the coming fall
All for one and none... for all

Manipulate our destiny
Magnify our greed
Infiltrate our senses
Plant the chaos seed
