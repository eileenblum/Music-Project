Scale the walls of time
Watch the veils unfold
Breathe in deep your last
And await thy crystal shores

Fools, where are your gods?
Fools,your time has come.

The end of days is nigh
Ye servants of the sun
Blackened are your truths
Now heed the coming storm

Bash the tongues of sin
Strip away your pride
Walk into the shadows
The end of time is now

Fools, where are your gods?
Fools, where is your chosen one?
