Into the depths we go
Across the astral planes
The winds of Khet blow foul
Beneath the cloak of night

Into the womb of the Nile
The blackened heart of the damned
The scarab's eyes glow black
With shades of death

Hail! O sorceress, dark mistress of Set
Bathe my soul in unholy light 
Master of the spheres
Keeper of the spells
I am Anubis, The jackal head

Into the spectral void
The spiral halls of the dead
Within this sepulchure
The mask of plagues

Hail! O temptress, vile minion of Thoth
Sear my soul with infernal fire
Monarch of the ages
Guardian of the wells
I am Anubis, the jackal head. 

Burn Osiris! God of the Dead
Hail Anubis! The Serpent flesh

Into the moonlit spires 
Of ancient ruins past
The shifting sands of time
Bring a ritual sacrifice

Hail Nephthys! Witch mother on high
Praise Herrut! Viperian liege
Patron of the sinners
Defiler of the saints
I am Anubis, Immortal death
