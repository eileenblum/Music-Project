Plunge the world into chaos
Scorch the land with flames
Night descends from the heavens
Leviathan rides again

Ride the waves of sin, steer your ship of glass
Walk the path of treason; we were never built to last
Falsify existence, don the mask of shame
Unholiest of servants, we are two faced..

Gemini!

Drink the meads of malice
Dishonour is the way
Solace lost in sorrow
Leviathan flies again

Fear the luminous eye, lord of the sun, twister of life
He's blinding you
Fear the ivory sage, lord of the snakes, deceiver of light
He's blinding you

Fear the luminous eye, lord of the sun, twister of life
He's blinding you
Fear the ivory sage, lord of the snakes, controlling your mind
He's blinding you now!
