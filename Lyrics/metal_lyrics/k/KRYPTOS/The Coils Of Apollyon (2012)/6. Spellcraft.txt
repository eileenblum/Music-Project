A spiral force of crystal fire
Tears the flesh unborn
Illuminate my bleeding heart
With burning crowns of thorns

A forked tongue of confession
Of a serpentine decree
Enslavement of the mother soul
In black infinity

I dance with wolves tonight on circle pyres
A tribute to the void
Litany of the wretched lamb
Cower beneath my coils

Entwine the light in shadow realms
As phantoms cast their spells
Drag me from my hollow tomb
To the burning gates of hell

Scars of arcane rites
The jagged thorns of spirit flesh
Rise! Ophidian born
The scourge of man, spear of night, desolate king
I am reborn

Under eternal skies
The snakes of god uncoil

I dance with wolves tonight on circle pyres
I dance with wolves tonight on holy spires
I dance with wolves tonight on circle pyres
I dance with wolves tonight on holy liars
