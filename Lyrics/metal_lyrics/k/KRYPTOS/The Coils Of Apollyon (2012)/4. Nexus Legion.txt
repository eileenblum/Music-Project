Tattered Flags, allegiance to the fallen sun
Raging winds, on Iron angels we fly
Gods of war, desecrate the tree of life
The eagle falls to crushing thunder on high

We are legion
Glorious death
Never surrender, we will stand against the odds
Now! We are legion
Glorious death
Fierce and proud, we will stand against the fates

Ripping fire, screaming sirens of steel
Chaos descends over fields of crimson soil
Now! As we plunge through the night, bitter glory in our eyes
Our names will live on in the sands of all time
For we are the few who must sacrifice
For victory for those who we left far behind

We are legion
Glorious death
Never surrender, we will stand against the odds
Now! We are legion
Glorious death
Fierce and proud, we will stand against the fates

Maelstroms of mortar fire below
Into the rancid jaws of hell
We fly!!!

Now! We are legion
Glorious death
Never surrender, we will stand against the odds
Now! We are legion
Glorious death
Fierce and proud, we will stand against the fates
