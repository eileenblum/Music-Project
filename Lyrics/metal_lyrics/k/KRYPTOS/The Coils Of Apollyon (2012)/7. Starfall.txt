Now that the time draws to a hand
An oracle moon peers through the veil
Charon awaits the souls of the lost
The seance begins in circles of thorns

Darkening skies, harbingers of doom
The cries of the witch shatter the night
A gathering storm, the omens align
In temples of gold we baptize our blades

Raise you blackened steel
Sound the horns of hell
When the snakes of god uncoil
The stars will fall again

A prophet appears on an altar of sin
Defiling our minds with tablets of sand
Entomb the liar in crystalline shrouds
Silence the tongue of illusion's son

Discordant hymns to the enslaver of man
A casket of bronze for the apostles of greed
Longinus soaks in the blood of the saints
The martyr falls to the spear of fate

Raise you blackened steel
Sound the horns of hell
When the snakes of god uncoil
The stars will fall again

Bow down! Treacherous angel flesh
Bow down! Twisted virgin wraith
Bow to me!

Beyond the realms of infinite time
Seraphim suns cry out in vain
Eden falls to the god of the void
Sire of Cain your destiny waits

Onwards we march through deception's gates
At the center of heaven - the codex of life
Draconian gods fall to our chains
Immortal blood, thy kingdom is mine

Raise you blackened steel
Sound the horns of hell
When the snakes of god uncoil
The stars will fall again
