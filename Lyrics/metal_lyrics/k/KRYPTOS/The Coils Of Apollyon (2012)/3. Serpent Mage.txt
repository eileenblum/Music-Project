The candles burn, the luminous eye calls your name
A whispered word, the shadows dance once again
The dragon moon, the sigil of night on your skin
Crystal claws, sacred fire, the spell is cast on poison wings

The witch's grail, a cosmic cage for mortal men
Feeble cries, a prelude to your dying breath

The tome of suns, magic spells and blackened cross
Fallen stars, golden orbs
Creation in his trembling hands

The serpent mage
Calling you again
Mocking you in death

Three horned wolves, desolate souls of worlds below
Capricorn, servant of fire, chaos steed
A trick of light, the twisted stare of sullen eyes
Crescent moons, the riddle is set in grains of sand

Hidden hands draw near
The acid touch of a million dying stars

Spinner of fate with cursed tongue, vision of the demon eye
Shape of age, spectral form, scarlet king of sacred fire
Profane beast, demon creed, brazen sage of infamy
Libertine!
Serpent mage, shadow spawn, soulless son of crimson dawn

The candles fade, the luminous eye hides its gaze
A dying hymn, the shadows wane once again
Velvet cloak, shards of grief on your skin
The pit of time, welcomes you with icy winds

The endless fall
Hounds of doom guide your path
Acheron calls
Eternal night and unseen dawn

Hidden hands draw near
The acid touch of a million dying stars

Spinner of fate with cursed tongue, vision of the demon eye
Shape of age, spectral form, scarlet king of sacred fire
Profane beast, demon creed, brazen sage of infamy
Libertine!
Serpent mage, shadow spawn, soulless son of crimson dawn
