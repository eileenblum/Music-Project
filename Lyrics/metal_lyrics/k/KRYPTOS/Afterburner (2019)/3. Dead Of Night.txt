Shadows all around
The night's movin' in
The day wastes on by
As darkness looms ahead

It's the midnight hour
We gather for the feast
On these streets we ride
Disciples of the beast

Silently we slither
As the world slips away
Spawns of the moon
Carving out the stars

As the city sleeps
The hunt gathers pace
Phantoms of the black
In twilight we rise

Spectres from beyond
Glide through the mist
Blood is our wine
A never-ending, insatiable lust!

Children of the sun
Ride with us tonight!
In the silence of the void
Lies the sweet kiss of death

Hear our cries!
Come to us and we will sanctify
Purify your virgin heart

Hear our cries!
Come with us and we will sanctify
Consecrate your virgin soul

Hear my cry!
Come to me and let me sanctify
Purify your virgin heart

Hear my cry!
Come to me and let me sanctify
Consecrate your virgin heart
