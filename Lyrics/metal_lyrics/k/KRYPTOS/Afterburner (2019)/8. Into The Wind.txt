Into the wind
Out on my own
Like a wolfen child
I call the night my home

One with the wild
I'm standing tall
No one can stop me now
I hear the echo of freedom's call

Ain't no more chains
That can hold me down
I'm gunnin' for nothin'
And I won't look back

Nothing's what it seems
Nothing's what it used to be
But it goes on and on
In this spiral dream

Hold my hand and never let me go
Till I am one with the wind and I roam the stars far beyond
No more fear and there will be no pain
For I am one with the night
And I'm never alone ever again

Ashen skies
Over roving fields I run
I let my spirit fly
Into the great unknown

Unearthly lights
As far as the eye can see
At the gates of wonder
That's where you and I will be

My soul is free
To wander through
Never-ending time and space
I face the cosmic truth

Nothing's what it seems
Nothing's what it used to be
But it goes on and on
In this spiral dream

Hold my hand and never let me go
Till I am one with the wind and I roam the stars far beyond
No more fear and there will be no pain
For I am one with the night
And I'm never alone ever again
