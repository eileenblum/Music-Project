Vengeance from the heavens, the judgement day comes
Rage and retribution, a hammer to the heart
Your eyes swell with fear, your maker slithers down
Burnin' through the wasteland, you're prey to the carrion

Afterburner comes roaring
Watch out!
Afterburner comes roaring
Watch out!

White neon demon, the bearer of light
Truth and broken nails, fight for the fight
Tearing down the kings, kickin' down the crown
Gutter constitution, it's brimstone retribution

Rusted knuckle-dusters are ready to go
The buzzard cries above the massacre below
Electric laser vision burning down the road
Out to batter and bruise, it's time to fuckin' go!

Afterburner comes roaring
Watch out!
Afterburner comes roaring
Watch out!

Fear his name!
Afterburner comes roaring
Watch out!
Burn in flames!
Afterburner comes roaring
Watch out!

A swing of the axe, glint in the night
Scream out of fear, nocturnal fright
A swing of the axe, maniacal eyes
Afterburner's raging, he's comin' tonight!

Curse of the day, spellbound by hate
Shape-shifting demon, he sharpens his blade
Tyranny of gods, his burning desire
To come into town and set it on fire!

A swing of the axe, a thrust of the blade
A scream splits the night and now it's too late
Hunched over victims, watching them plead
Watching them cry, watching them bleed!

Watch out!

Not a soul stirs, it's the dead of the night
One false move and he's ready to strike
An axe on the left, a blade on the right
He means good business, good business tonight

Now that he's done he wipes down his wares
His eyes burn with fury, he sharpens his gaze
Afterburner's his name, hunting's his game
Better watch your back, here he comes again!

Afterburner comes roaring
Watch out!
Afterburner comes roaring
Watch out!

Fear his name!
Afterburner comes roaring
Watch out!
Burn in flames!
Afterburner comes roaring
Watch out!
