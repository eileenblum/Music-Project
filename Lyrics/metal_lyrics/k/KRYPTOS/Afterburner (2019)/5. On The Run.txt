That sinking feeling
Burnin' at my soul
The day you walked away
Now I'm far from home

I stand persecuted
Face judgement alone
No one can save me now
Now I'm on my own

I find no reason
But I pay the price
A raging, searing madness
And memories cold as ice

Storm clouds gather above
Ain't easy to stand tall
These chains of grief that bind me
I'll never shake 'em off

'Tis the season of grey
All alone in the rain
Don't you shed your tears for me
Or cry for yesterday

On the run I fight for you
Locked away you know it's true
These thoughts they come back to me
My tears stain these empty streets

I'm on the run back to you
Left for dead, you know it's true
These thoughts they come back to me
My tears stain these empty streets

So please come
Set me free!

Now that we're near the end
It's been a long, old while
My wretched, bleeding heart
Yearns for days gone by

The room grows smaller
As the night closes in
My whole world's crashing down
Now I'm all alone once again

On the run I fight for you
Locked away you know it's true
These thoughts they come back to me
My tears stain these empty streets

I'm on the run back to you
Left for dead, you know it's true
These thoughts they come back to me
My tears stain these empty streets

I've been
On the run!
