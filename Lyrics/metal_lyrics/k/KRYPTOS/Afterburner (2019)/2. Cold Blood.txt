Every waking moment
Wonder what's out there
Every ignorant second
The many masks you wear

They inch closer
They see through me
A million piercing eyes
Planting their wretched seed

Every secret whispered
You think aloud
Every step you take
Towards the light, you will fall!

They turn to break you
They bring you down
Infiltrate the thoughts you dare to think

Desolate realms
Are yours to rule
King in the gutter, jester you're the fool!

The secret moon
Arise the star!
Don't dare question
From the throne you will fall

Razor sharp eyes
Shine through the night
Two-moon massacre
Unholy, formless divine

Better count your blessings
Understand the pain
He stands high
Colossal dealer of pain

Liberty's chains
Dominion sought
In the end
Was it worth the fight?
