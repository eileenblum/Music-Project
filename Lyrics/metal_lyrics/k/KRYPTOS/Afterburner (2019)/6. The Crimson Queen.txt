In the dark she spots me
The crimson queen
One look in her eye
Rapt in a deathly dream

There is no escape
It's the end of my life
Trapped by her wicked mercy
My soul's fading light

Heed her evil eye
The crimson queen arrives
The chant goes out tonight
With every dawn I die!

The hunting ground is Grief Street
For the filthy, easy meat
The night court's soon adjourned
Come now! The gathering completes

From her dagger drips the spell
Darkness falls across the realm
Her words whip me in a trance
Into the void I hurl myself

Heed her evil eye
The crimson queen arrives
The chant goes out tonight
Upon the altar, sacrifice!

Heed her evil eye
With every dawn I die!

Where can you run now?
Her eyes will burn you down
Where can you run now?
Conjure the spell, bring forth the night!

Blinded by her cunning hate
I fall prey to my doom
A victim blinded at the stake
A serpentine gift to the moon

Shadows dancing all around
She howls across the plains
From her grave a glistening light
Behold! The queen of the dead!

Heed her evil eye
The crimson queen arrives
The chant goes out tonight
With every dawn I die!

Heed her evil eye
The crimson queen arrives
The chant goes out tonight
Upon the altar, sacrifice!
