The beast roars, motor gospel
Down the road with no bends
Straight cast, needle point
On my own to the bitter end

Chrome winds through my hair
All or nothin', fortune spent
Lord knows I won't change
On this ride nothing's ever the same

Rev it up! The coast is clear
A tyrant sings for the young ones
Wind in my sails, Mach-speed running
Thunder roars and you'll never bring me down!

Crank it up! The night's upon us
A beggar's claim for the throne
Wind in my sails, Mach-speed running
Thunder roars and you'll never bring me down!

On through the blackest night
Chrome monster, wicked ride
Burnin' up the beaten path
Turbo-charged, I'm killin' time

Storm-born, devil's child
Stained by the sinner's blood
Movin' up to a speed that thrills
Stand down! I'm comin' in for the kill

Rev it up! The coast is clear
A tyrant sings for the young ones
Wind in my sails, Mach-speed running
Thunder roars and you'll never bring me down!

Crank it up! The night's upon us
A beggar's claim for the throne
Wind in my sails, Mach-speed running
Thunder roars and you'll never bring me down!

Hell's wheels, motor breath
Thunder-strip psychonaut
The fire still burns inside
A mob of one, I'm runnin' wild

Follow me to motor hell
A place where the rebels dwell
Won't bow to any man
Crash and burn, I don't give a damn!

Rev it up! The coast is clear
A tyrant sings for the young ones
Wind in my sails, Mach-speed running
Thunder roars and you'll never bring me down!

Crank it up! The night's upon us
A beggar's claim for the throne
Wind in my sails, Mach-speed running
Thunder roars and you'll never bring me down again!
