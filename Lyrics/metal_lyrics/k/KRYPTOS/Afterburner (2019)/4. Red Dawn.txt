From far-flung galaxies they come
Ghostly discs of fire, there's nowhere to run
In stealth mode, undetected, they are closing in
I wake up in chills, god knows where I've been!

Pitch-black darkness in the city tonight
The heavens are lit, a threatening sight
Startling silence shattered by a piercing scream
I wake up in chills, god knows where I've been!

Shadows from beyond
Rain terror in the night
Deadly imperial force
Of primal ancient might

The signal is beamed in a binary stream
The skies are crawling and it seems to me
My hideous visions bear a deadly truth
I scream their name, what did I do?

Malevolent voices usher me to the hall
The invasion is nigh, everyone shall fall!
From the skyline it beckons to me, all eyes can see
I scream its name, I don't know where I've been!

Shadows from beyond
Rain terror in the night
Deadly imperial force
Of primal ancient might

A cipher code for the eternal being
In ones and zeros, dÃ©jÃ -vu complete
Cosmic parasites reveal their carbon queen
I wake up in chills, oh god what have I seen?

Deafening sirens sound from light years away
Impending doom, orbital decay
Mass enslavement, thunder from above
This is our final stand, listen to what I say!

Annihilate!
Replicate!
