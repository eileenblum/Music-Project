If you are forever, then why your tears?
Y' know your pride will bring downward to the ground.
And your mystery mining, that's for no more tears
(You say) Evolution is a curse.

Reach for me 'cause I'm Clandestine Element
Partake, and align them, Clandestine Elements

Ever look'd me up later
I defy your cost,
To be one and one be lost.
Never will they find me in those years
Now I'm taken for what they might hear.
Ever free, never bought
So, what's so clandestine about my thought?

Reach for me 'cause I'm Clandestine Element
By the stake I'm found to be Clandestine Element
