Twilight, in grace embrace the night
She waits on the landing biding time
Heavy boots she could hear

She wishes for wet, verdant grass
Meadows, where she used to lie imploring stars

Close your eyes, you could dream away those times
Improper, visions, you see are in twilight, Grace

So dismayed she's lost, yet elated 'cause he's gone
He misty stolen eyes narrate the horror that once was

Speak the truth, bleed the liar, kill the abuser
Head - hold it high, grace, you will be reckoned in time
