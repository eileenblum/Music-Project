Can you see the game from below?
Do they have to claim me now?
All of their faces creep from the ground
Transcend from the brown.

Do they scare the dawn away?
Do they pave their time?
Opacity of a heart so divine
A miser's laugh to abide

Independence rising form these, denied
Forlorn winds caress their minds, denied.

Longing for their middle earth
They fight for spiritual life
Catatonic marches mar their sight
These hymns of lost divide

Their stars awake to snap those fragile chains,
Innocence barred from reality
