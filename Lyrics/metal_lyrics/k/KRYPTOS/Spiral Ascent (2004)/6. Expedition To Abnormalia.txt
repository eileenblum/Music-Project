Vexed my way out of the land of ice
Followed my greed to Abnormalia
24 years of perseverance

Bury my trail of tears, 
Bury my lies
As I wander this mono seasoned land

Independent as a bird I could fly
While the witch conjures dark thoughts
My voracity overtook me and my craving grew
Here in utopia, I seemed to be in fault

Come here to where you belong
A portrait you might become
You are your mother's son
