Proverbial presidents on an astral sky,
Despotic mortal in disguise.
Black cloaked mystery men will rob your soul,
Psychosis has captivated you
Your growing old.

Tales of carnality and bereavement
Land of ice where lies and infidelity are born.

Malignant misanthrope perverse newborn minds
Superficial mothers disburse themselves on wine
Lion hearted fathers confront over borderlines
Blood stained diapers like coral on the waterfront
