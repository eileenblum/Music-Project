As your smile swells to crying
Dreams are one of a kind
I will take you down
Imprinting madness, frowning
Forsaken lives how their sadness calling.

As we dream of them dying,
And their smiles they wait too long for you,
Father made you talk funny rhymes,
Friends you've made have warned to sin in time around me.
