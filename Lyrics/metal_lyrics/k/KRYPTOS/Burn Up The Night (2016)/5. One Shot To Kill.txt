Stand your ground
Don't let 'em in
Hold the fort
The hunt begins

Target locked
Tween the eyes
The barrel screams
Cold as ice

Watch your back
Don't turn around
Danger lurks, hell bound
Strain your eyes, you will see
Shotgun screams, beg mercy!

One shot to kill
Shoot for the thrill
One shot to kill
Shoot for the thrill

Metal gods stalk the night
Pleasure to kill, pick a fight
Hell wind, flames of grey
Burning sand, widow's way

Venom brew, you will fade
The devil rides this way
A phantom land, you will roam
Scarred for life, the street wants more!

Don't hold back!
Go for broke!
Don't hold back!
Fight! Till dawn

One shot to kill
Shoot for the thrill
One shot to kill
Shoot for the thrill

Lightning fast!
Hybrid soul!
Broken teeth!
Brawl till dawn!

Wind howls through the night
Scarlet dreams under neon signs
Law is dead, the street is yours
Break the chains
On your knees, crawl!

Lightning fast!
Hybrid soul!
Broken teeth!
Fight till dawn!

Lightning fast!
Hybrid soul!
Broken teeth!
Brawl till dawn!
