Shadows swallow the neon sun
In dark waves of cosmic night
Damnation of the crystal realm
Operation: kill the light

Donât breathe a word
Donât you dare
Plunge now into certain death
A black voyage to the other side 

The megalith it calls
From depths beyond space and time
Crimson gods are watching you
Through spheres of endless eyes

Graven portals to an unknown void
Dawn breaks over desolate realms
Red shift: obliteration
Face to face with the fallen star

Sentient moons crumble to dust
Dark matter annihilation 
Spiral down, infinite darkness
Plummet into stellar hell

Donât breathe a word
Donât you dare
Crimson gods are watching you
Through spheres of endless eyes

The megalith it calls
From depths beyond space and time
Plunging into certain death
A black voyage to the other side 

Gaze upon the Promethean wall
Where madness calls and chaos reigns 
Threshold infiltration
Behold! Dimension Adramelech

The megalith it calls
From depths beyond space and time
Crimson gods are watching you
Through spheres of endless eyes 

Blackstar horizon
At the edge of no return
Plunging into certain death
A black voyage to the other side
Its certain death
