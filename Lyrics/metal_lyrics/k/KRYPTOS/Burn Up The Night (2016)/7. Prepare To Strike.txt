Banished to the far post
Don't care what I'm fighting for
The blade is warm and the end is near
These illusions trapped in fear
Upon the empire's flank they disappear

Trust the blade
The heart it bleeds
Thrust the blade
The heart it bleeds

Atomic rain floods the city streets
Naked and battered they cry to be free
Nuclear lights that burn up the sky
Robot armies, mind control device
They watch from above, a race enslaved
Master control, the inhuman race

Fight the war that isn't for me
I never, never, ever believed
The dead tell stories, I recall
Ancient devil, carnal history

I watch the human race disappear
A colony of death, misery and fear
Programmed minds armed by hate
Relentless warriors storming the gates

Undead auras shine through dark
The desolate one blesses them all
In one fell swoop they stand their ground
The once dead army prepared to strike
