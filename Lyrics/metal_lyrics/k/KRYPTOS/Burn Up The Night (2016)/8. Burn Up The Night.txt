The road goes north, and another to the east
I do what I want, I got the world at my feet
The motor rumbles on, can you hear it scream?
Too close to the curb
Burnin' rubber, the road's my queen

Oceans part, my vengeance peaks
Climax now, I swear it will never leave
I'll run you down, I'll tear through you
And you'll never get away
Thundering warrior, here I come
Iâm gonna burn you down

Lord of the road
I got you in my sight
In for the kill
Ready for the fight
Here I come!

Lord of the road
I got you in my sight
In for the kill
Ready for the fight

Listen close and you better wait your turn
When you hear my motor you better turn and run
Ripping, raging, I can hear the sirens come
Hard and heavy, here I come
The motor rages on! 

On and on and on
Forever on and on

Lord of the road
I got you in my sight
Full speed ahead
Let's burn up the night

Let's burn up the night
Let's burn up the night
Let's burn up the night
