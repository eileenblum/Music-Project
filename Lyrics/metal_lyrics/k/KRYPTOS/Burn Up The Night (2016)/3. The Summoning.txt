Gather around, under the oak
The drawing of the moon has begun
There is no escape from the eyes of the night 
Relent to the call of the dead

A pact is now made, the ritual begins
The master is calling your name
Hear the howl of the wolf, a cry from the dark
The kiss of the beast on your lips

The summoning, it comes from the hills
Tremble at the sound of the bell

Look to the heavens as the horror descends
The coronation of ruin begins
The Sabbath is near, the deed must be done
Your last rites are read, you are doomed

Demons surround the unholy one 
A shapeless wraith from the void
Spectre of night, black angel of death
From out of the fire he comes

The summoning, it comes from the hills
Succumb to the sound of the bell
He calls, to you
The summoning, it comes from the hills
He calls, to you
Succumb to the sound of the bell

Spells of the old, the crucible flows
Manic shapes in the mist
Men of the cloth, the witch's creed 
Crystal Templars on ancient wings

Spirits of Earth
The marble throne
Violent mourn under the moon 
A child of the sun
A fatal storm blows 
The land is now in ruins 

The summoning, it comes from the hills
Succumb to the sound of the bell
The summoning, it comes from the hills

He calls, to you
Succumb to the sound of the bell
He calls, to me
Succumb to the mark of the beast
He calls, to you
The kiss of the beast on your lips
He calls, to me
One with the lord of the night
