Your saviour, what does he say?
An oath, what does it take?
Rude and mean, we are here to stay
Ruthless night, fight to find a way

Fight!

Burn it up!
Ram it down!
Full throttle!
Underground!

Wicked. The gangs round up tonight
Knuckle duster, justice served right
Blood stains the street alright
No fear! We own the night
We own the night

Burn it up!
Ram it down!
Full throttle!
Underground!

No fear! We own the night
Stay clear! We won the fight
No tears! You wanna stay alive
No fear! We own the night
We own the night!

Burn it up!
Ram it down!
Burn it up!
Underground!
Burn it up!
