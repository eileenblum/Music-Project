Forged in the streams of time, an entity unknown
Beneath the veil of death, twilight is my home
Out of the multitude of dying stars I rise
Elysian dynamo, a being of endless fire

Waverider
Turn the hands of time and the wheels of fate
Solar genesis, consecrate my name

Just like a shooting star burning through the sky
Tearing through oblivion's gates, on beams of light I ride
I've seen the barren depths in a universe of ice
I've seen the heavens burn beyond the gates of time

Waverider
Turn the hands of time and the wheels of fate
Solar genesis, consecrate my name

Still I ride!

Ripping through lunar winds with devastating force
I blaze a trail into the heart of the midnight sun
Guarding the doorway, a phantom of the night
I face my destiny and slip into the light

Waverider
Crusader
Turn the hands of time and the wheels of fate
Solar genesis, consecrate my name
