I shiver as I recall
All the things I've done
I have been the light
A fallen knight, an angel of sin

Upon this earth I roam
Banished by the heavens above
Suffered in the pits below
Forsaken by the hope deep inside

I shudder as I recall 
The spirits of my past
Their icy fingers pointing at me
The horrors seem to last

Waiting for the heave
I leave this world, no regrets
Bury me, I will return
It's goodbye for now

I shiver as I recall 
The victims of my past
Dead eyes staring at me
Iâm blinded by the sight

Hear me now
For this night is so long
And it never ends

Dream away, the end is here
I hear them coming, coming for me
Shadows of my vengeful past
I am yours forever in death
