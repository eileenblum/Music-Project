[Verse 1]
Heavy is the head that bears the crown
When the world you know turns upside down
Vultures circle from above
We're all a pile of bones

Burn bright my friends you kings and queens
Through endless nights, worst ever seen
Dark so cold, sticks and stones
We're all a pile of bones

[Bridge]
I grind my teeth at night, I clearly see
We share the same destination
I grind my teeth hard through the night, transmissive I clearly see
We share the same destinationâdeath!

[Verse 2]
Still need something by my side
Chasing something undefined
A sickness turning in my head
But I'm not dead

Searching through my desert soul
An empty heart, without control
One more chance to make things right
Before my shadow slowly dies

[Chorus]
Transmissive
In every step that I take, head for a destination
Wake up, think ahead
Dissmissive
You destroy, I create
Why build it up to tear it down

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Transmissive
In every step that I take, head for a destination
Wake up, think ahead
Dissmissive
You destroy, I create
Why build it up to tear it down

Wake up, wake up
We share the same destination
Wake up, wake up
We share the same destination

[Chorus]
