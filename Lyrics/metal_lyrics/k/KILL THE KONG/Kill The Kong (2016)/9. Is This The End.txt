[Verse1]
Embraced underground, you are safe. I will keep your soul
No sound will reach outside. I'll feed your life; I'm your soul protector

Lie downâscreams won't help you here
Be calmârage won't break these chains
Be mineâyou will understand, in the end, this is the end

[Bridge]
Precious can't you see that I care?
Safe in the hole, alone in the dark
This is the place where they cannot eat your heart
Can't you feel that it's love?

[Verse2]
Confined beyond sight, there's no light
And they can't steal your soul
The sound will stay inside
I'll be your life; I'm your soul protector!

Your mouth without voice, no voice
Closed watery eyes, dead eyes
Panic clenched fists
Find your inner paradise

[Bridge]
Precious can't you see that I care?
Safe in the hole, alone in the dark
This is the place where they cannot eat your heart
Can't you feel that it's love?

[Chorus]
This is my gift, my haven for our love
Once you understand
I will spill the red underneath your voice
Devour your heart; you'll forever remain in me

[Stick]
Red of love pours through my veins
This is how I save you; this is the end

Red of love pours through my veins
This is how I save you; this is the end [2x]

[Outro]
My shivering hand makes traces of fear
Loneliness screams, my heart doesn't understand
The beautiful red embraces your pale
What have I done? Is this is the end?
