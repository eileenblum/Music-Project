[Verse 1]
I've known this far too long now
You've tried to bring us down
I never knew that you could
Cut us all off
You've try to climb the ladder
I can not see why
Dominate by false affection to conceal the...

[Pre chorus]
â¦pain you feel inside
Is turning into reckless sabotage

[Chorus1]
One more is all you need to lose it all
You are out of control
One more is all it takes to make you fall
Stop denying reality

[Verse 2]
The foundation you build on
Is made of our bones
There is no way that
We will praise you
Your soul is clouded blind
Left behind with a broken mind
You're one delusional 'king of the hill'.

[Pre chorus]
Pain you feel inside
Is turning into reckless sabotage

[Chorus 2]
One more is all you need to lose it all
You are out of control
One more is all it takes to make you fall
So when you're seeking restitution
Stop denying reality
Our screams sounds in silence

You are left behind with a broken mind
A heart torn apart
I sense your doubt both day and night
A heart torn apart

[Chorus 2]
