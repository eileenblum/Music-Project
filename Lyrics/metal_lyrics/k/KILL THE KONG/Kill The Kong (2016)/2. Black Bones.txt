[Verse 1]
There is no empathyâI feel a dark inside my bones
Chasing the coldâaway from my soul
Chose my fate in sanityâI miss the pain I felt before
I guess the blind deliveredâdown there is a hopeless sinner

[Chorus]
This is where we are nowâblaming ourselves
I'm not standing stillâI'm running away
From the scenes that we share
From the moments I regret
I'm fading away

[Verse 2]
Failing to reconcileâwith a ghost dragging me down
Into the voidâa darkness in me
This pit is bottomlessâabandoned, nailed down to the ground
What have you done? I wonder cause

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
In these moments I forget, time will not heal
In these moments I forget, that I am sick
In these moments I regret, I didn't believe
In these moments I regret, I did not live!

Don't try my patience when the tide is high
Gasping for a breath of air
Stuck in the deep, with every lie comes a
A moment, a moment of decay

In these moments I forget
Time will not heal
In these moments I forget
That I am sick
In these moments I regret
I didn't believe
In these moments I regret
I did notâ¦ live
