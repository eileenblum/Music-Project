[Verse 1]
I've crossed the thin red line, to the brink of lunacy
Shielded inside my mind, I'm caged for eternity

[Bridge]
Cut the ties offâliberate my entity
Cut the ties offâopen up my eyes

[Chorus]
Give me a chance to stay alive,
Sever the noose around my neck
Show me the fire to ignite againâ¨
Give me a chance to stay alive,
Sever the noose around my neck
I need a fire to ignite again

[Verse 2]
Until the clouds unveil, the bright burning sky
The shadows own my soul and soon my whole life

[Bridge]
Cut the ties offâliberate my entity
Cut the ties offâopen up my eyes

[Chorus]
Give me a chance to stay alive,
Sever the noose around my neck
Show me the fire to ignite againâ¨
Give me a chance to stay alive,
Sever the noose around my neck
I need a fire to ignite again

Open up my eyes
Open up my eyes
Open up my eyes, eyes, eyes
Open up my eyes, eyes, eyes
Open up!

[Chorus]
Give me a chance to stay alive,
Sever the noose around my neck
Show me the fire to ignite againâ¨
Give me a chance to stay alive,
Sever the noose around my neck
I need a fire to ignite again
