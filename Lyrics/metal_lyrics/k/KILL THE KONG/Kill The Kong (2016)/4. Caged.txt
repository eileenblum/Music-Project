[Verse 1]
Who are you, where's your self-esteem?
You are a dead fish in a stream
You wanna be someone so really really bad
I feel quite sorry for your sorry little ass

[Pre-chorus 1]
Follow me, come join me [3x]
Gonna make you insane and poison your system
Follow me, come join me [2x]
Get the fuck up, oneâtwoâthreeâjump

[Chorus]
You ain't got no spine at all
You're always told when to jump
You just need to know how high
Get the fuck up, domination

[Verse 2]
You didn't want this, there's a hole in your soul
I am forever in control
You want to be someone, just follow my command
In the end I'm with the whip hand

[Pre-chorus 2]
It's so cold down here it's clinical
You are sinking in a sea of shallow clones
Trapped in a cage like an animal
You are brain-dead
Psycho-social, I'm in your head

[Chorus]
You ain't got no spine at all
You're always told when to jump
You just need to know how high
Get the fuck up, domination

[Outro]
Jump, jump, jump
You are always told when toâ¦
Jump, jump, jump
I want you to fuckingâ¦
Jump jump, jump, jump!
I want you toâ¦
Jump jump, jump, jump!
