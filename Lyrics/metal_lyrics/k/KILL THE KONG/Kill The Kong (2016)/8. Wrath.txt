To darkness bound!

[Verse 1]
Treading dark waters, I'm sinking too deep, dragging my chains in mud, crawling on bones, tethered and weak will I, will I survive the flood?
Reaching for ropes, to pull me ashore
Beaten, broken, bruised and aloneâ¨
Dim is the light, fading my sight, am I, am I beginning to lose?

[Chorus]
Wrathâ¨
If I could I would let it fall on you, let it crush your
Pride
If I could I would let it destroy you, let the wrath untie my
Mind
If I could I would let it ruin you, let it crush your
Life
If I could I would let it bury you, let the wrath untie my mind

[Verse 2]
Can't comprehend, the way you've become
Are you completely numb?
Am I forgotten and led astray? Am I, am I to darkness bound?
You took my all, from my bare hands
Betrayed, misled and used (betrayed, misled and used)
Then I fell on your command
I hope, I hope you're grandly amused

[Chorus]
Wrathâ¨
If I could I would let it fall on you, let it crush your
Pride
If I could I would let it destroy you, let the wrath untie my
Mind
If I could I would let it ruin you, let it crush your
Life
If I could I would let it bury you, let the wrath untie my mind

What is holding me from letting go?
All that's left is buried deep below

[Chorus]
