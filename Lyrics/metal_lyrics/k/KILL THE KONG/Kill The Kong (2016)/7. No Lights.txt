[Verse 1]
Reliance dies, now you're dead inside
And the sight is blind (the sight is blind)
No wrong or right, when there is no light
You're on your own, survive

This mask is turning into
Into my face
Destroy, erase, remove
From the ashes rise

[Pre-chorus]
Paint the walls, paint em' red
Make a draw, create the dead
Shaking voice, fucked up head
You're all dead

[Chorus 2x]
Paint the walls (hey!), paint em' red (hey!)
Make a draw, create the dead
Shaking voice, and in my fucked up head
Every single oneâ¦

[Verse 2]
This time there's nowhere to hide
It doesn't matter if you pick a solid side
Listen up, get your act together
I'm coming after you, run forever

[Bridge]
Dark times, fading lights
Dark times, fading lights
Dark times, fading lights
Dark times and fading lights

[Chorus 2x]
Paint the walls (hey!), paint em' red (hey!)
Make a draw, create the dead
Shaking voice, and in my fucked up head
Every single oneâ¦

Paint the walls (hey [3x]), paint em' red (hey [3x])
Shaking voice, and in my fucked up head
Every single one drops dead.

[Bridge]
