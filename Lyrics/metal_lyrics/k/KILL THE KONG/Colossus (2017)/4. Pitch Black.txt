'Nuff said, time to roll heads
My finger's on the trigger, my pockets full of led
Lights out, a fist without a doubt
I'm your hell I'm your god I'm everything above

Death from the inside. I cannot hide
No one's left. Just darkness my old friend

Pitch black! All I see is
Pitch black! Bone to blood is
Pitch black! Everything is
Pitch black!

Repeat, my demons unleashed
Last man standing, dead bodies at my feet
Breakdown, a joker with a crown
Tainted soul, sober head, everything is

Pitch black...

Death from the inside. I cannot hide
No one's left. Just darkness my old friend

What came was an ocean of chaos
Was there even a tipping point?
I'd taken trips to the other side
Was I trembling blind?

What came was an ocean of chaos
Was there even a tipping point?
What came was an ocean of chaos
All I feel now...

Death from the inside. I cannot hide
No one's left. Just darkness my old friend

Pitch black...
