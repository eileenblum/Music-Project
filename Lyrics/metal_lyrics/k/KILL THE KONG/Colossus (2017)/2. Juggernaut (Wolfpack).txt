Wolfpack, full attack!
Don't you worry we've got your back
I never fought the pain inside of me
Don't go back!
Keep on moving head for change in your mind

You talk about your goals but never take a first step
To walk that extra mile
Step out of the shadows no more rest
Get your shit together, you're not here forever
Donât be static, be on the move, under the gaze of the full moon

Wolfpack full attack!
Don't you worry we've got your back
I never fought the pain inside of me
Don't go back!
Keep on moving head for change in your mind
Wolfpack full attack!
Don't you worry we've got your back
I never fought the pain inside of me
Don't go back!
Keep on moving head for change in your mind

I paint my endless rage with words
There is a storm inside of me
Listen to my voice don't be a fool
Fuck what they say, make your own rules

Wolfpack...

I was lost in the night. All lost in the dark
I was stuck in a torment. Is this where I'll die?
I saw the days passing by
Once stuck in a limbo. With no easy way out
This is my last goodbye
I was stuck in a torment. Is this where I'll die?
I saw the days passing by
Once stuck in a limbo. With no easy way out
This is my last goodbye
