Every time I close my eyes I'm bound to a world so demonized
Osmosis in my head, I can't explain, I go insane
I break the barriers in rage, break the silence in your head
There is more than meets the eye, I fill your head with lies

I pull the strings... You won't get rid of me...

Paranoid, lost my way, I'm lost in a haze
You won't get away, I'll never let you go
Shut your eyes I'm in control
Terrified, let me go, I'm losing control
You won't get away, I'll never let you go
Shut your eyes I'm in control

Here we go again, I'm drowning in a melting pot of dreams
Every night I close my eyes my head fills up with screams
I pollute your mind with endless lies, much more than you can take
In the end I'll watch you bleed, cut you 'til you break

Paranoid...

I am so drained, dancing with the devil
Now and forever, dancing with the devil
I am so drained, dancing with the devil. Now and forever
This is hell! This is hell!
Paranoid...
