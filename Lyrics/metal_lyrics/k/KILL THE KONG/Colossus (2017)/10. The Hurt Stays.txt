You left me stranded in a dried-up wasteland running in circles
No tools, no beacon of light underneath a dying twilight

Reflection numbs my mind
How do I ease the pain?
Memories fused in all five senses
All I feel is unbroken rain

Clean cut, now what? Phantom pain every day
Frozen tears don't leave no trails
What happens when blood fails?
Clean cut, now what? Phantom pain every day
Frozen tears don't leave no trails
What happens when blood fails?

The moon is shining, I am breathing ice, swallowing all of your lies
Thatâs when I knew I changed, connected with the raged

Reflection numbs my mind
How do I ease the pain?
Memories fused in all five senses
All I feel is unbroken rain

Clean cut...

A clean cut, now what?
Frozen tears don't leave no trails
What happens when blood fails?
A clean cut, now what?
Frozen tears don't leave no trails
What happens when blood fails?

I just wanted you to be there
Fuck your thirst
I didn't need you wicked and sick
Fuck your burns
I just wanted you to be there
Fuck your thirst
I didn't need you wicked and sick
Fuck your burns
