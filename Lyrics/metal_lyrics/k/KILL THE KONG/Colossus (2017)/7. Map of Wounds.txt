Impending gloom evolving rapidly
Lifestyles in first class catastrophe
You feel as he's coming, he's here to collect
Foreclosure of all life, instant affect

We seal our own demise, a truth we can't deny
We seal our own demise, new life denied

Don't hold your breath
Damnation
Death by your own creation

Vultures of greed in human disguise
We devour the hand that fed us with life
Like cancer we spread, we evolve and excel
How can we find a cure from ourselves?

We seal our own demise, a truth we can't deny
We seal our own demise. From apathy, new life denied

Don't hold your breath
Damnation
Death by your own creation
The end is near
Addiction
We fuel our own extinction
