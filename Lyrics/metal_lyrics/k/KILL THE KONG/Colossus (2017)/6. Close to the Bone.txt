I split my mind, I slice and dice
Got no time for bicker and bullshit
My heart commands my tongue
Every single time

All my life, pouring gasoline into the fire
All that burns, is not worth holding onto

Still playing games but you don't keep up
So close to the narrow edge
Covering up doesn't take the smell away
From rotten to dead!

I don't think you feel me but your eyes are right
You know the truth, you know the truth
There is something missing, you are out of your mind

Shut your mouth and do think twice
Don't be such a goddamned hypocrite
Your words reveals it all
I'm close to the bone

All my life, pouring gasoline into the fire
All that burns, I leave behind

I don't think you...

Is the truth bitter, does it burn?
Is the truth bitter, does it burn?
You fake fucking piece of shit!

I don't think you...
