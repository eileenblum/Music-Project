A breath of death
There was something holding me back
I turned around everything went black
So give me more, I need a fix
Where is the sign with the 666

Trails up in the sky, born to defy
Bring the heat, not ready to die
I see it in your eyes, fear starting to arise
Time is running out

I can feel you inside of me, Reveal yourself
Come set my world on fire, light it up and burn the stains away

Turn me, give me a taste, I'm burning can't you see
Been down so long, I hear the devil singing his song
Free me, your lies are killing me
On and on I hear the call, bring the heat, hell disappoints me

The end of days
And the flames got brighter,
I can't kill the pressure inside
In my heart hate will illuminate
A breath of death

Trails up in the sky, born to defy
Bring the heat, not ready to die
I see it in your eyes, fear starting to arise
Time is running out

Turn me, give me a taste, I'm burning can't you see
Been down so long, I hear the devil singing his song
Free me, your lies are killing me
On and on I hear the call, bring the heat, hell disappoints me

My words echoes in your head
I am everywhere
Now my words echoes in your head
I am everywhere

Turn me, give me a taste, I'm burning can't you see
Been down so long, I hear the devil singing his song
Free me, your lies are killing me
On and on I hear the call, bring the heat, hell disappoints me

It fucking disappoints me!
