You're down on your bloody knees!

I know that you feel you are out of place
Don't push your head too deep into the game
Snake eyes is what you got the very first round
But a life long journey demands a rebounding heart

Let go your desperation
Broken by false perceptions
You're down on your knees
Hold on, this is your last chance
Broken by false perceptions
You're down on your bloody knees

I know that you're connected to your heart and soul
The obstacles are many and they never stop
Your head is like a stone cold haunted house
Make friends with your demons or they will tear you down

Let go...

You are living under the wing
Living under the wing of regress
Emptiness steals you along
'til you flat-line, 'til you flat-line, 'til you are gone!

You are living under the wing
Living under, under the wing of regress
You are living under the wing
Living under, under the wing of regress

Let go...
