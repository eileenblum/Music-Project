You will die as you lived with hate by your side
Surrounded by all your demons.
Too late for regrets, the path has been set
Different circles of hell which one will you choose?

As you wither away
In a shallow grave
Time is fading away
As light will decay

You tell me the world has changed
You tell me the world has changed
When you are the one that changed

A stray from the heard, leaving trails of dirt
From a mind that is shattered to ashes
Repel! Reverse! Ignorance was your curse
Now watch as the bridges will burn

You tell me the world has changed
When every step leads you down to the edge
When no one is left to blame
Will you enjoy your fall from grace?

A once thriving kingdom has turned to dust
Can you taste the failure?
A sickness growing deep inside
You become a slave to your mind

You tell me...

You preach to the choir but leave the truth untold
Make them sing the anthem then let the story unfold
