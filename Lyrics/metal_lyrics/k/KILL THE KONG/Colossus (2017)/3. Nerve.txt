I know we are from different worlds you and I
In the end we rest together, underground we realign

The promise that you failed turned my shelter to a grave
Nothing lasts forever

I lost my nerve and then I lost it all
Under the waves of betrayal, I cannot breathe at all
Cast into the sea, I am left for dead
The water is turning red

Nothing left but an empty heart and a broken mind
Siberian kiss, a last goodbye, a fate denied

My head tied to a noose, I've got nothing left to lose
Nothing lasts forever

I lost my nerve...

Left for dead with a broken mind
Siberian kiss, a last goodbye
One last goodbye, one last goodbye

I lost my nerve...
