[Bonus Track]Dark drops are soaking me wet
Once again reminded bout' the struggles of the past
Seeds of fire, exploding sky
My heart is racing while my mind is at ease

Ashes!
Gray becomes us all
All the bane will fall away
Ashes!
Gray becomes us all
You will face the fallen, you're ashes is the wind

Wet soil underneath my feet
Walked these roads a million times, this shit is all the same
Cold dead hands, this is a defeat
I got it from the start, your clothes just entertain

Ashes...

Once again, I sink beneath the rayless waves
I close my eyes, I'm drifting away
Now I walk, I walk among you
You can't see me, I am ashes in the wind

We are waiting for a change to come, and it always comes
A grand final transition

Ashes...
