In a state of drunkenness
Staggering stumbling
It's cheap and dirty just as I like it
And I wouldn't want to be anywhere else
Pink neon tombstone

Let this place be my graveyard
Let this be my graveyard

I raise my glass
In a trance like state
You'll find me there
That's where ill be
I offered myself
Sacrificed myself
Here pretty smile around my cock

This will be my graveyard
Let this be my graveyard

Laughing dancing screaming

I'm drowning
Degraded
I'm consumed
I dulge

I'm falling...falling
Towards sovereignty
Towards death

I'm laughing my way down
Laughing my way to the grave
