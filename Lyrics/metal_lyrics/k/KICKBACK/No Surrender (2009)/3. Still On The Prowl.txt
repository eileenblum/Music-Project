Slow animal motion
My contribution
Plunge into
Learn to adapt
What you want and what you get
Disease ridden nights
Amongst the lifeless
The unfamiliar places
But it's always the same

And sold so many times
Innocence is lost from the start
Fed cock day after day
Painted faces neo lights
The old pros and the new recruit
Or the tenderness of unsolid flesh
Private pleasures of most neinous type
Pariah kind of divine rights

Where the action is
Acrid stench humid flash
Stricky floor urine soaked
Broken dreams

Wretched lifeless indulge
Animal lust provokote
Taited pleasure waylow
Libertine degrade celebrate

And you walk these streets
Full of life and so naive
And you walk these streets
Untouched or so you think

LOWEST OF THE LOW
LOW

Amongst the used and the users
The liars and the takers
I embraced it all

Amongst the lowest of the low
I embraced it all
The wickest way

The truth is I fit here perfectly
