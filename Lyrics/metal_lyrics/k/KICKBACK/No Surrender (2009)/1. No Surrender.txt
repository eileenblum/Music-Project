You know me
I am the pariah, I am the enemy
Those seedy streets have raised me and left their marks on me
The shadow of death, follows my every step
Ten crowns for seven heads, carved into my flesh

This is for us, this is not for you
This is for us, this is not for you

Crowned in filth
Reign supreme
Hell is now

This is for us, this is not for you
This is for us, this is not for you

Seven crowns
Kingdom of pain
Bringer of doom
I am the spear in the side of your dream
Your false paradise
Soaked in sin and stinking of death
I won't give in
I inflict and spit in your face 'til the day that I die

Sink my teeth into this world of robots
Leave marks
Leaving marks

No remorse
No surrender
