This goes beyond your tepid standards
There is no crusade
It's just whats there
It's all right here
It's all around
This life shatters and I feed of the vibes
Deepthroated emotions
Your tears incite

I'm stained I'm marked and I'm scarred
But I rise baby all the time!
I've burned countless bridges to survive
And I [censored] anytime!

Enter my sideshow
My rusty perverse playground
Nothing could please me more

OLDER
COLDER
STRONGER
