Another unique daybreak
Hanging in the gutter
Drinking with rats
In the early hours
I've crossed borders
Interzone frontiers
Neon light guise beacon

Crystal clear

She gives me another hit
Pours me another drink
It ends between her legs

In flashes of red and pink
I've been awake for 20000 days
Trying to shake the urge
But it wont go away

Theres as pale white figure
Smiling at me
It follows me around now and I got used to it

My sheepskin clothing is all ripped apart
My fangs are showing now all the time
