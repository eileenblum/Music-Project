i look inside for something i can't find
same answers over and over again
a lifetime in hell but you are the crime
dragging me out and pushing me back
try to break free try to escape
no one can help what have i learned?
rise above - i'll take back what once was mine
see what's real - beyond a wall of lies

when a brand new day has risen
and the past is lost forever
i'll do anything i can
to take back what's mine

wounds are open never to close
blaming myself but i've been betrayed
will i sink deeper or will i rising again?
buried alive
everyday, i must ignore the pain
a waste of time if i don't rearrange

[chorus]

buried alive - beneath your lies
reborn again, breaking my shallow grave
[x2]

when the past is lost forever
i face a brand new day [x2]

[chorus]
