You stand in line waiting for the call
Forced to exist you wait for the fall
Day after day you get nothing but lies
The colors have faded i've seen their disguise

Represent, represent [x2]
You seek respect but end up in a grave

Six feet under a new home for the brave
Misled by their rules to suppress our pride
We must realize the power lies inside

[CHORUS]

Life of rorment, it's tearing miself apart
Disillusion, constant pressure, pain...
Never give in

[CHORUS]

I will be free I'll do what it takes
We were born to die vhat do we have at stake?
I stand accused but I won't take the blame
I'm going for mine I'm so tired of this game

[CHORUS]

I'm so sick I'm so tered of this game
Endless pain I won't live a life of shame
I resist - break the chains
As I stand against this world
