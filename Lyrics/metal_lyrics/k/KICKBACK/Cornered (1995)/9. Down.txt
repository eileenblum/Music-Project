When I think about those days
I sometimes wish to bring then vack
But living in the past ain't no way to live

I stand alone with no love to hive
See me rise and see me fall
Scarred indide I'll never forget
Rely on hate to heal the pain
Cos' nothing will never be the same

It took me down
It broke my will
I remenber what you did to me
As I stand and watch and watch my past slipping away

It gets so hard to contain
All the anger I've kept inside
Cos' now I know it's too late
For me to comprehend and to forgive

It took me down
As I stared at all my hopes and dreams
tumbling down
It broke my will
What you fucking did to me
It broke my will
I remenber what you did to me
As I stand and watch my past slipping away

[Repeat 1st verse]

[CHORUS]
