face the truth so harsh
it' ll take you to your knees
cause of the choices you' ve made
nowhere to hide and nowhere to run
and now you can' t turn back

why don' t you face the facts?
it will come back at last
no one fuckin' wins in the end

caught up by your act
it knocks you off you feet
cause you' re in too deep
nowhere ti hide and nowhere to run
as fear makes your brain go numb

bumrush - will you fall or will you stand
bumrush - and stay true till the end ?
