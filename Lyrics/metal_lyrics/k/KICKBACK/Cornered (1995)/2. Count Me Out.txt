i've turned my back
on the lies of my youth
i ' ve had enough
i couldn't go on like that
alone again
i thought you were my friend
i found a way to ascend
and left it all behind
count me out
all the foolish games you fuckin played
count me out
no fuckin' regrets

i won't be led blind
like i was before
i won't give you my trust anymore
alone again
i thought you were my friend
you never gave a true fuck
you never cared

[chorus]

faces came and went but really few knew
what it really meant
they played the part oh so perfectly
but never were true
faces came and went but really few knew
what it really meant
i thought you'd be there
i thought that you cared
but realized you were fake

count me out - i thought you were my friend
count me out - you fuckin fake
count me out - no fuckin' regrets
