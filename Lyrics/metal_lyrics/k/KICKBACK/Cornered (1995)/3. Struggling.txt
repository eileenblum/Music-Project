i've harden myself 'cause i won't get trapped
in this world of confusion
never give up and never give in
always just trying to stay alive
struggling to survive

thought i was broken but my will is strong
i won't fuckin bend
i think for myself i think for the best
and seek the truth till the end

[chorus]

no matter what i do i can't seem to get ahead
there's always someone messing with my head
you think you know what life is really about
it' s easy to see there's no way out

and when all the things you believe in
fall through....what are you gonna do?

cast aside i won't go out like that
all this pain it's tearing me apart
i'll never surrender i will fight back
seekin' the truth till the end
