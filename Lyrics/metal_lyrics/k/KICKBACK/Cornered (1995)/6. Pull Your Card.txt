don't fuckin' tell me
how i should live
you talk so much shit
all you do is deceive
you think you know it all
and that's your mistake
thought you were in control
but never had what it takes

[chorus]

i pull your card - you played yourself
why can't you see ?
i pull your card and expose your fantasy
i pull your card - you played yourself
why can't you see ?
i pull your card and draw the line between you and me

anger grows in my head
cos of the rules you make
the lies that you spread
from the start you were fake

[repeat 2nd verse]

you think you know me
but you don't know shit
just stay away from me
you're the one i fuckin hate

[chorus]

i won't change my way
you're the one who fronts
you must pay
