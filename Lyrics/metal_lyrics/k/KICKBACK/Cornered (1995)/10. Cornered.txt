If only I could break through this wall
This wall that surrouds me
I know I will be free
All alone in my hell... Where are you ?
Try to tempt me
I think I'm going insane
So many fuckin' path
Lead to hell

If I let down my guard
Who will save myself, I'm asking ?
Who will save me ?

Torn again
Between the wrong and the right
This never-ending fight
That drives my life

To feel again
When your will is broken
I must escape
Let me go

[CHORUS]

Cornered
Temperature's rising
Demon awaken
No one is spared...
