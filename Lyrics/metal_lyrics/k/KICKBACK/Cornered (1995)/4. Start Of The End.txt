are we gonna be the witness of our own destruction ?
persistence of hatred
the fall of civilization
morals are gone and greed rules our lives
our times has come
hell on earth
mass demise

the start of the end
we all die - the start of the end

what have we learned ?
the world is in it' s final state
ignorant and careless
we chose our own fate
we are guilty facing our demise
our time has come
hell on earth
we all die

[chorus]

don' t we see what the fuck is going on ?
innocent dies, survival is at stake
we decide our own fate with no regards
for anyone else as we' re killing our world
