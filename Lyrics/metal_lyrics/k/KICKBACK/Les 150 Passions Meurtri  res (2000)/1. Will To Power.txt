Splatter this world with blood
Crimson murder to stain the earth
Your prayers to empty skies
None shall be saved, none shall be spared
Watch it all come to an end - unholy triumph
Our glorious rebirth this very night
Into chaos we rise

So let it all come down, let it all fall
Let it all burn down, your weakness and your lies
Now and forever as your feeble world turns to dust
Let this second coming be the death of you all...

To new kingdoom, new domain
How will I ever be the same
Again ?
My earth's cold yet I burn
Crush your face and watch you bleed to death
Your suffering, now my pleasure
Feed my lust and the fire in my heart

Bloodsoaked visions of genocide - murderous passions
Our celebration, your demise - the elite march on

Conqueror of self, unbridled and free, carving our names
Eternity finally opens, our selfish pleasure has no limit
The gates are open wide

My hands wrapped tight around your throat
The crown held high in infamy
Exterminate and dominate

The use of violence with
Awesome strength
The brutal fuck with
Maximum Destruction

That's yours
That body's yours
The ultimate pleasure
It's your nature
Your right to kill

She'll die in pain
Buggerfuck the whore
Peel off her skin
Hammer her skull
And tear out her guts
Feel the power
And spill out your fuck
As you drink her blood
