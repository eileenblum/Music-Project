The day darkens, chaos spreads across the land
Murderous season, mass decay
It infects everyone, in every city
Crawling menace slithering into your home
Cornered and trapped in the depths of my mind
I stand alone at the crossroads of my life with
Nowhere to turn
And no one to trust
Breeding sickness
All that I have hidden inside now resurface
I embrace the darkness and ready myself for the
Killing
No emotions, no feelings
My flesh spits my nightmares
I need to hurt you
To turn your world upside down
Burning anger, opening wounds
Burning anger, impending doom
I embrace the darkness
My blood is boiled
The final hour
Machine disfunction
Bloodlust erection
In my dreams I've killed you all
In my sleep you beg and crawl
No one escapes
No one is spared
