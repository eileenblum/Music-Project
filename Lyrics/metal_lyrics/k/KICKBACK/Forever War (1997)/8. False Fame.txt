You claim your fame
That is not true
Back in the days
You would never have made it
Through
The past is gone
But I'm still here
And in your eyes I see nothing
But fear
Live what you say
Say what you live
You're talking shit
And violence's what I'll give
Your and your weak crew
Won't last long
Now it's time to show you
You're wrong
Hitting you hard, hard as I can
Knocking your teeth
I'll bring you pain
You claim your fame
That is not true
Back in the days
You would never have made it
Trough
You wanna be down
Jump on my dick
I'll have no mercy
For you and your fake clique
Live what you say
Say what you live
You're talking shit
And violence's what I'll give
