Everyday loosing faith
Cold wind brings emptiness
Burning eyes cast into stone
Engulfed in darkness
Hell is now, we are lost
I finally claim my throne
2000 years alone
Suffocate under this pile of shit
Called society
A bitter taste follows me everywhere
Disease is all I see
I refuse to be the next sacrifice
My soul confined to a fortress of ice
I've tried to grasp
At something real
Fighting the hands of time
Burned, but I've learned
One day your kingdom will be mine
I'll rise while you sleep
So many ways I can hurt you
Your weakness I despise
Open the gates to the fiend that lies
Within you
One more time I rise
Thrown in this world
I've never asked for it
Better to reign in hell
Than serve in heaven
Open the gates to the fiend that lies
Within you
Unleash the beast inside
