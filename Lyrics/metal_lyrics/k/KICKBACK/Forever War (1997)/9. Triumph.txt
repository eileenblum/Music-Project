Arisen from the ashes
I walk the path of the resurrected
My destiny unfolds
My fate is marked
Animal senses keen and alert
What I do to myself, you'll never
Understand
Arisen from the ashes, I'm set out
On my own
In this sick dying world, you get what
You deserve
It all began in my dreams
Something you'll never know
Time is running out for me
My enemies surrounds
Burning all my bridges
I knew it from the start
