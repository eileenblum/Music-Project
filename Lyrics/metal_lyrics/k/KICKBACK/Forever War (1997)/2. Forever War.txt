Never understood the way I feel
Never got it right
Stare at me, look in my eyes
Now tell me what do you see ?
I am your product
You made me this way
Eye for an eye, tooth for tooth
I'll take you got
Vengeance burns in my soul
You think you know how I feel ?
Enter my mind if you will
Fear not what you will find
You'll never ever take what's mine
Either with me or against me
Don't get in my way
Fuck'em all, I do what I have to
