Awaken by a clear vision
Of where my life was going
Ripping through the bitterness
That plagues my mind
Shedding skin, my empty shell
Is left to rust
This lifeless body turns to dust
Alone and forsaken
Climbing my way up
Born again at the end of this
Winter season
Winter ends
Burning palace, decaying throne
Birth of the new age
Breathing time in this cage
Innocence is lost from the start
Dreams torn apart
Banned from the outside world
Revenge slips trough the cracks
A wolf in a guise of sheep
Plotting my attack
Reach out of the dark
Revenge slips through the cracks
Reaching out of the dark
Reaching out of the dark
