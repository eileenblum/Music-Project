Imprisonned, entrapped into flesh
Locked up for life int his world of lies
Clawing my way in disbelief
My path to wisdom through pleasure and pain
In excess, the road to freedom
My endless quest, my crown of thorns
Beyond good, beyond evil
My suffering has only begun
Plunge inside the heart of all your fears
And seek power
That which does not kill me will make me
Stronger
Useless quest for salvation
Reborn, absorbed into one
No gods, no masters shall stand before me
Death defying and numbed by life
Into the abyss my eyes wide open
In excess, the road to freedom
My endless quest, my crown of thorns
Beyond good, beyond evil
My suffering has only begun
Whispering voices calling out my name
I've got demons crawling under my skin
When the moment of truth comes I will be
On my own
Godless, unshackled, unbowed, untouchable
Until the end
