Lost all your hopes, lost all your
dreams
In this shithole we call earth
Things are as sad as it seems
There's no love, no comfort inside
here
No love, no comfort you're living in
fear
Living like the worms that crawl
the earth
Living like the worms that crawl
the earth
Discared like the worms that crawl
the earth
Squashed like the worms
that crawl the earth
You wanted love but I will bring
you the end
Let us render to the tender darkness
Into the silent infinite darkness
Let us render to the tender darkness
We shall some day return
Disappear
