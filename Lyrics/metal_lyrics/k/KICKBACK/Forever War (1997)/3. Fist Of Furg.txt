Hammered by existence
Life beats me down
Blow after blow
It takes me to the ground
I stand in the corner
Waiting for the bell
I'll fight my way out of this living hell
A I stand and feel my world
Crumbling to pieces, slipping away
I try to hold on, I try to maintain
I live this fucking life alone
My soul is bleeding
From the suffering of life
I have to fight back
Clenched fist, I stare at the sky
Burning anger in my eyes
Bleed and the pain is sweet
On the edge but I won't fall
I'm falling and I can't turn back
No return
I live this life alone
No return
My soul is bleeding
From the suffering of life
I have to fight back
Using fists of fury
