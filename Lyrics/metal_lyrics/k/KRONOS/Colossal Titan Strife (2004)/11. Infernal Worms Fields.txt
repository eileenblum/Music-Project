Only ashes and tears lay on this ground
on mortal realm, slaughter has to reborn
we need some help to accomplish out work
minds forgotten to brandish our revenge sword

Banished from Olympian kingdom
deprived from our dream existence
now, we spend our time to plot
against worms living above us
sad human tribe crawling aimless
we learnt to curse what can be destroyed

Reduced to an infernal worms field
...Swarmin to pathetic breathing corpses
...Soulless puppets
...Infernal worms fields
...Creatures from god mud

Banished from Olympian kingdom
deprived from our dream existence
now, we spend our time to plot
against worms living above us

Now, we pull the strings to manipulate you
epidemic, plague, and suffering
pain, violence, and disaster
discord, betrayal, and scorn
all these seeds of evil will grow
in your infernal worms fields
hecatomb reign divine
vermin kills vermin
hate breeds hate, misery the despise
vicious circle eternal
A war here, a carnage over there
A death or a cataclysm somewhere
we are just the triggers of unnatural hailstorms
just to exterminate the infernal worms fields

Only ashes and tears lay on this ground
on mortal fields, slaughter has reborn
from jupiterian skies, gods gaze at...
Unpowerfully the bothered fallen ones
