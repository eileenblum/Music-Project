...I am Kronos
The Mighty son of Ouranos
Secretly stolen then hidden
far off appetite of my father
I grew upon a revenge way
Cause mother earth Gaia beseeched me
to kill our undivine killer
such is the fate of my birth

Cause no one but him
Had the right to ascend the throne
Cause no one else but him
had the right to pretend to the crown
...I am Kronos
born from divine copulations
amongst seven, I'm the last titan son
apart of the first divine generation

I took a flintstone's scythe
and violently, I cut genitor's testicles
...Left hand is now a bad omen
a terrible scream unleashed the universe
Vomit devine
The son of a fear symbolic...fall eternal
With Rhea as bride, I resigned on Eliderealm
I am the one...The one who dominates
I am Kronos

Once enthroned
The father madness filled my empty veins
better than ever to be alone
What's use to be several?
To share is a human weakness
once enthroned
my sons declared the war
and gathered as one for the colossal titan strife
a war I lost, thundered by my son Zeus...

I am Kronos
born from divine copulations
amongst seven, I'm the last titan son
apart of the first divine generation...
