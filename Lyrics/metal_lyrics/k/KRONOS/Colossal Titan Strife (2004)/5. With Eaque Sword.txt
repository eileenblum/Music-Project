Feel the sword violently rip your head
Each neck bone cracking under wrath blade
a deep neigh in the burdensome mist
the preludium of the blade symphony

no eyes...but I see
no ears...but I hear
no blood...but I live
no mind...but I feel

guided be my fate by the eaque sword
again I shall kill, I behead with true rage
headless bodies walk, then on their knees...they fall
I rule this land of fear with eaque sword
I ride, night's veil hiding tears of a diving sun
I obey the owner of my head
till the day it becomes mine as before

embodiment of a blood justice, reign of terror
sleepy hollow has become a hatred haven
where dwellers are hidden as vulgar rats
awaken in my death handled by mistress of fury
a judge of hell...the devil's advocate
guided be my hate by the eaque sword

Feel the sword violently rip your head
Each neck bone cracking under the wrath blade
a deep neigh and a sarcastic laughter
the postludium of the  blade symphony
again I shall kill, I behead with true rage
headless bodies walk, the on their knees..they fall
I rule this land of fear with eaque sword
I ride, night's veil hiding tears of a diving sun
I obey the owner of my head
till the day it becomes mine as before

bell of trial echoes
The call of retribution
She whispers to my skull
and I behead the chosen one with eaque sword

embodiment of a blood justice, reign of terror
sleepy hollow has become a hatred haven

...with eaque sword
