Obedience to a god or to a cult
civilization blinded by beliefs
damned to walk, the eyes full of dust
damned to believe soulless for their lives
never seen, never touched, revolt...submission

lies, decay, prey...submission
mind, plague, religion...submission

skyfire reached by ages
unholy words are forbidden
in a third-eyed land
for the sun, you have to pay
for a god, you have to obey

the altar is full of blood
the blood of your faith
the altar is full of blood
the blood of the submitted
