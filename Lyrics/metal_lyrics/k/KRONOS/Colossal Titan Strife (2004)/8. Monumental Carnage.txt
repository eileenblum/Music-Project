There's blood unforgotten
all these wounded souls tortured by Christ's faith
the ground was strewn with so much beheaded pagan corpses
but now, the bell rings two centuries later

A furore normannorum
the devil and his demons summoned from the sea
libera nos domine
within anger, there's the hate you'll never see

There are slumbers unawakeable
wolves of war have broken their chains
uncontrolled spirits of their revenge
remember...blood calls blood

Monumental carnage has a name
tribe of the north...horsemen of the sea
shields against shields
axes are stronger than words

Come to see, fury of the northmen
come to see, playing with beheaded monks
come to feel their asshole hotter than hell
"Oh my god...hail this irreligious sodomy!!!"

Monumental carnage has a name
tribe of the north...horsemen of the sea
shields against shields
axes are stronger than words

Hail to the north law
condemned virgin to the Norglaw
you are the ones, the sons of Wotan
who with his blinded eyes, see the dying dawn

Lindisfarne revenge...in memory of the proud ones!
