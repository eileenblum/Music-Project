Gaia infuriated by Zeus
Because of the giants defeat
Mated with Tartar
To bring Typhoon in the world
One of the most filthy creature ever
To accomplish her will of vengeance

Higher than earth's children and mountains
Winged body covered with snakes
Hundred arms, eyes spitting fire
Frightened Olympus with his sharp hissing

Desirous of ruling the universe
Started to launch attacks against the sky
With fire balls accompanied by terrifying howls
And vomiting fire floods
In front of this cataclysmic scene
Gods changed into animals and fled to Egypt

Higher than earth's children and mountains
Winged body covered with snakes
Hundred arms, eyes spitting fire
Frightened Olympus with his sharp hissing

Zeus stroke him first
And hit him with his steel sickle
Wounded, sheltered on Casios mount
And finally tracked down
Tied up but the creature's snakes
Immobilized the thundergod
Stole him his sickle
And cut his tendons with

Typhoon's lair become the tendons hiding place
Watched over by Delphynes the dragon
Hermes and Egypan will catch his napping
And bring Zeus his tendons back

Then started the final battle
A huge cataclysm
With thunder and flying mountains
Henas mount went flooded under that bloodbath
But the creature won't survived
It finally died squashed by the Etna

Higher than earth's children and mountains
Winged body covered with snakes
Hundred arms, eyes spitting fire
Frightened Olympus with his sharp hissing
