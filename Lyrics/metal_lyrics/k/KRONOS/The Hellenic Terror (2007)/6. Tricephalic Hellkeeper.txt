Two monsters Echidna and Typhoon
Couldn't father nothing else but a monster
And Cerber came to life
A huge dog with three heads
A neck bustling with snakes
And teeth which, as the viper
Poisoned you at each bite
His mission would be to watch over
Banished human flesh

He became the hellkeeper
His lair on the Styx side
He was the one who welcomed
The shadows of the dead in hell
But never let them come out

Tricephallic Hellkeeper!

The fate of the mortal ones
Who attempted to get into his domain
Was death, cut to shred
By the inflexible gaoler

He was the hellkeeper
His lair on the Styx side
He was the one who welcomed
The shadows of the dead in hell
But never let them come... out!

But Cerber was not so invulnerable
Even he, had weaknesses
One was gluttony
Twice wheedled with food
By Psyche and Diphobe
To walk through the gate of hell
Orphee put him to sleep with singing

Lastly, humiliated
Subdued and brought back to earth
Half choked by Heracles
But the earthly land was not a place for him
Unequalled underworld rampart
He was given back to the kingdom of the dead
The kingdom of the dead

He was the hellkeeper
His lair on the Styx side
He was the one who welcomed
The shadows of the dead in hell
But never let them come out.
