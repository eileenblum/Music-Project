My native land is now far away
Over the seas and mountains
Beyond the temples and olive groves
In Persia, east of the Hellenic world
There, where Zeus is no longer revered
There, where men called me Griffin

My predatory claws slash better than a sword
My eagle beak pierces better than a spear
My lion body is harder than a Greek phalanx
My flaming eyes chill everyone

I have flown through the sky to Scythia
At the extreme north of the continents
In the fabulous land of the Hyperborean
In charge of the great god Apollo's mission

That's why, I've been chosen
To keep a gold and emerald treasure
That's why, I am the chosen one
Powerful protector of the Olympian wealth

Time and time again... I have repelled too envious men
Time and time again... I have fought to accomplish my mission
Time and time again... I have risked my life in my.. quest!

Once again, against hyperborean's neighbouring people
The arismapes' warlike cavalrymen
With only one eye and long hair tier with a golden brooch

I have struggled for hours
Against this battalion of knights
And I have never given in
Killing my enemies with no compassion

I am condemned to fight my whole life
Apollo has taken my freedom
I have sacrificed my existence
To accomplish my glorious but relentless destiny

We don't discuss the god's decisions
We live to execute the Olympian divinities' wishes
So I'll guard this treasure of gold and emeralds
Until the end of time!

My predatory claws slash better than a sword
My eagle beak pierces better than a spear
My lion body is harder than a Greek phalanx
My flaming eyes chill everyone

That's why, I've been chosen
To keep a gold and emerald treasure
That's why, I am the chosen one
Powerful protector of the Olympian wealth
