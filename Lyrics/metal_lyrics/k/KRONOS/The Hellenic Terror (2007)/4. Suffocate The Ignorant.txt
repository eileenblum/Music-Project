Thebes, lost in the heart of Beotia
Strangled by the mythic strangler
Well-known under the name of sphinx
Demon of bad luck, destruction and death
Sent by the goddess Hera
To reprimand the royal murder

Sphinx!
Winged lion with a female head
Fruit of an unhealthy copulation between Typhon and Echidna
You accomplish your vile destiny
Devastating meadows
Terrorizing Inhabitants

A regicidal people...
A kingdom cursed by gods...
A devastated country...
A city on fire and blood...

Installed on a high rock
You call out to the passer-by
Submit them a riddle learnt by the Musesa
And strangle with no mercy... to suffocate the ignorant!

Creon, regent of the bloody city
To stop the carnage
Decides to offer the Thebes crown
To anyone who might annihilate the scourge
Everybody fails
The beast victims number is still growing

Oedipus!
Courageous hero
Coming from nowhere and searching for glory
You are the only one
Defying the guardian of the truth
You will liberate this decimate land

[Sphinx:] "Welcome courageous mortal, endeavour to give me the right reply or you will die..."
[Oedipus:] "Ask me your question, I'm ready and I will find the answer!"
[Sphinx:] "What animal is that which in the morning goes on four feet, at noon on two, and in the evening upon three?"
[Oedipus:"] "... Man! Who in the childhood creeps on hands and knees, in manhood walks erect, and in old age with the aid of a staff"

Sphinx!
A simple mortal solves your riddle
So mortified!
You hurl yourself on your stone
And perish... Eternally!

This is the end!
Of the malediction
Let's begin
The reign of Oedipus!
