Desires don't control themselves...
The Olympian gods don't except this rule...
Poseidon, under a spell of a gorgeous woman
With beautiful face and superb hair
Like a simple mortal
Charms this jewel of femininity
Satisfying his sexual desire in the Athena temple

Ultimate profanation...
The war goddess is so furious!
Divine vengeance is coming...
Malediction of unfortunate mistress
Now Gorgon is here!
Evil female with serpent hair
Fruit of the goddess anger

Medusa, magnificent living creature became repugnant
Medusa, victim of divine vengeance
Medusa, your eyes father death
Medusa, created to eradicate

Petrifying beauty!

On a faraway country
Near the two immortal sisters Euryale and Stheno
Accomplishment of a sad destiny
Wander... turn people into rocks...
Only one man could stop this curse
Perseus, Zeus and Danae's son
Courageous hero

Because Polydectes, king of Seriphos island
In love with Danae
To get rid of the powerful warrior Perseus
Send him to get the most precious head of the Hellenic world

Medusa, magnificent living creature became repugnant
Medusa, victim of divine vengeance
Medusa, your eyes father death
Medusa, created to eradicate
