[Labyrinth of time]

[Music : Grams - Lyrics : Tems]

Master Kronos guides our soul inside the trap of time
In a land where time and space have no rules
Malefic whirlpool of forgotten memories sink our mind
In the dephts of emptiness... of cruel distress
Time, a mindtrap, a labyrinth of neverending questions
A jigsaw of the thoughts
All the illusions are just unhallowed realities
An useless fight for an endless victory
Time, the judge of our life
Past is a black hole where fallen thoughts
Are forever painful cries

Past is the death which unleash tears of a black heart
For eternity he'll live in darkness... a place of distress
Master Kronos has no pity for lost souls which
Remember the past
Time, a mindpast a labyrinth of neverending questions

A jigsaw of the thoughts
All illusions are just
Forbidden realities
Fight in despair... time

An hopeless life, time rules supreme
In absolute master, future is the unborn
This one which will soon see the light
It's only fate is to become the past
Its hatred brother
Future is the undead, its death in its birth
Abyss has closed its arms
And time has opened its gates

Above the human race, on his dark throne
Master Kronos guides our soul inside the trap of time
He rules the time, we're born dust, we live dust
Times is our destruction, we must die
In a land where time ansd space have no rules
We are dead, dust to dust, ashes to death
Malefic whirlpool of forgotten memories sink our mind
In the dephts of emptiness... of cruel distress
