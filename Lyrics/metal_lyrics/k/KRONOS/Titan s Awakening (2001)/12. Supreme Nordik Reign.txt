[Conquerors of the dark age]

[Music : Grams, Tems - Lyrics : Tems]

Mighty demigods whose nothern tales
And viking legends
Tell the life of those powerful monsters
Crossing the seven seas
With the hunger of destruction
Frightening heads of the dragons
Unleash the oceans of blood

Master of the sea
Cold winds show their path
Coming from bloody snow of the north
Demons ride the oceans
Water is their own kingdom
No one can win the battle
At the horizon the land shows its face
It is the time to declare the war
A cup of blood before the fight
Far off, one could hear sceams of terror
Fear, fear cowards we arrive
Step after step
They walk on the land
For the slaughter

Step after step they shake the earth
Torture of those bastards
Wich suffering falls in chaos
Torture, blood and burning corpses
Guts and flesh fly, sound of cracking bones
Vision of hello, they shake the earth
Gold and jewels we take, all children we kill
Eradication of the race
Vision of hell
Coming from the north with malefic intentions :
Slaughter
Mighty demigods which nothern tales
And viking legends
Tell the life of those powerful monsters
Crossing the seven seas with the hunger of destruction

Frightening heads of the dragons
Unleash the oceans of blood
Year 793
Worrying phenomena
Appeared in northumbrie
And frightened dwellers
Sudden gleams arose the sky
Ferocious dragons crossed storms
Clouds, famine
Crashing down on the land
8th june pagan thievings
Destroyed lindisfarne church
Devastating and slaughtering
All which were within range

Unbelievable power of destruction
Slaughter comes from the nordic lands
Merciless butcher
Preachers must die, churches must burn
Christians must rot
Nordic invasion, reign supreme
Servants of devil war, masters of the seas
Spread as plague, christians plague...war
