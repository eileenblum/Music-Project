[Under my domination]

[Music : Grams - Lyrics : Tems]

Malefic power of damnation of mighty possession
Hypnotized by infernal dance of the goats
Around the fire of hell
Bewitched by eternal praises of your lord
Leviathan
Unholy rites for a black mass, sacrifice the
Chosen virgin

World of fire, evilish war
Rotting flesh and corpses to butcher
Human is your toy
And massacre your jog
Bewitched by eternal praises of your lord
Leviathan
The right is the devil path, smelling fresh death
Fill your eges

Spread your blood
Crucifixion, you're under my domination
Power of damnation
Demoniac possession
Bewitching desecration
Eternal domination

Welcome to you in my kingom of fear
Take my hand to this better world
Bewitched by eternal tales
Of our lord leviathan
Unholy organsm in the pleasure of damnation
Where bible and Christ are just a desolation

On your cross you die and slowly rot
By our flesh our victory is nearer
Support the wear against hypocrisy
Join our army of truth

Power of damnation
Demoniac possession
Bewitched desecration
Sadistik retribution
