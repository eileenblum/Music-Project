Only god of the depths can stop this
Machiavellian machinery
As a majestic complex structure
Devoted to end the human race

The equilibrium 
Of fallen mortal souls
Must never be interrupted

I am the unseen, The sovereign
Of the third divided
Sometimes my skin stinks of the vomit
Of my fainthearted father

But once fallen from his throne
We became the mightiest ones
Never someone else could pretend
To steal it

Klymenos
Underwrath
The rage
Of the underworld

None has forgotten
The colossal titan strife
Fury of all that savagery
Quintessence of alliance and treachery

Tartarus still recalls
The dreadful row
Awaken shall be
Every sleeping infernal legion

From Tartarus
Sombre rumours of retaliation are spreading
All these dethroned opponents
Stop their unrewarding tasks

Dragged out of ice ponds
And sulphur lakes
Huge silhouettes appear
Adrenalized by hatred

The rage of the underworld

How can this world
Endure another
Global confrontation

How will our siblings
Accept another
Savage rivalry

Spread your wings
The portent flapping of the chaos
My cursebearer flies above your palace
And infinite torments, will proclaim the disaster

Look deeply in their bloody-flowed eyes

The equilibrium 
Of fallen mortal souls
Must never be interrupted

Limits written millennia ago
Shall ceaselessly be overtaken

How can this world
Endure another
Global confrontation

How will our siblings
Accept another
Savage rivalry 

How can this world
Endure another
Global confrontation

How will our siblings
Accept another
Savage rivalry
