"O Zeus, much-honoured,
Supremely great, to thee our holy, rites we consecrate
Ours prayers and expiations.
King divine, for all things to produce with ease through mind is thine"

Never could you have imagined this stalwart coalition
All these years dominated by the sky master collapse
Never could you have realized this strange fervour
Whatever the violence of your wrath your lighting will strike
Whenever the paroxysm of your hate is reached
Arisen new era...

Your triumphant ephemeral reign becomes so measly
[We] all sat facing you, admiring the ceaseless incarnate selfishness
Once your crown abdicated by the announced warning.

Your throne unhurriedly whittled away.
Falling ancient tyranny...
Never could you have expected such a diabolical strategy
Never could you have thought such a revolt so sudden
Zeus was dethroned

Thundergod haphazardly throw his lethal weapons
The names of the Olympian entities will never cease to be praised
A conflict within, laughing by worms...
Whoever faces the king of gods

Stairs leading to Olympus seem to crumble
Under the weight of your vanity...
Columns of your palace inexorably sag
Time for retribution finally comes...

Never could you have imagined this stalwart coalition
All these years dominated by the-sky master collapse
Never could you have realized this strange fervour
Whatever the violence of your wrath your lighting will strike
Whenever the paroxysm of your hate is reached
Arisen new era...

Bloody battles were lead in treachery and sarcasms
Legendary carnages have revealed the strangest alliances
Thirst of conquests have always generated the worst
So brothers, lets trigger the hellish struggle...
