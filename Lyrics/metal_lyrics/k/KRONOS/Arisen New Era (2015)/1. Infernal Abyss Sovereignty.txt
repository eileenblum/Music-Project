Whirling souls brutally engulfed by the unmercifel Phlegethon,
while Cocytus gleans the ashes of a cruel bloody war.
scared frontiers for too long were overstepped with impunity.
Even our vomiting second collective birth can't tolerate this once again!

Emperor of the seas, my sphere is the indestructible pillar.
might imposing .columns never collaps under the weight of 'above'.
My silent and obscure realm welcomes every vengeful thought.
unfathomable deepest waters...

For too long, kingdoms and domains were banished form my will.
My temptations were reduced to several refusals.
however, I shut the massive bronze gates of Tartarus.
I am one of the godly three ruling this earth....

Strength through unity...fraternal congregation for the ultimate conflict.
divide and rule...when time to share has come...

Infernal abyss sovereignty
battle for underworld and sea...
Decline of our might family...

A sovereing abyssal conflict slowly echous as an inexorable humming.
A burdensome silence suddenly appears between the clinking of ambrosia glasses...

enosichton, as one stentorian choir. My faithful disciples claiming themselves to galvanize my terrific wrath...
adrenalized am i now...burden of the past is leaving me.
An oppresing desire calls me to war, Grief and torture...

Kingdoms and domains were banished form my will.
My temptations were reduced to several refuslas.
I shut the massive bronze gates of Tartarus.
I am one of the godly three ruling this earth....

Strength through unity...fraternal congregation for the ultimate conflict.
divide and rule...when time to share has come...

Infernal abyss sovereignty
battle for underworld and sea...
Decline of our might family...

Rage-triggers storms and raging deafening waves; please announce my hate.
My none-divine cohort and my godlike kinship follow me till the elysian fields...
