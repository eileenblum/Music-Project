I watched you look through me,
I've seen this all before,
And I've watched with whom you speak,
But I hide so you don't know that.
And I even watch you sleep,
It's become to me a bore,
As I rise triumphantly I take what's left and run...

Can it be its grown old?
Inside of me no control,
The past has been to me cold,
But now you're here with me

As I sit and watch you bleed,
I give thought to those you knew and
It then occurs to me that this happened before

Can it be you're so cold?
I haven't been in control,
I have released my black soul,
And that's why you're here with me

I now condemn this body
I now must reap what I have sown
I can't bare the thought of heaving earth...
Anymore.

Can it be you're now home?
Can it be you're disowned?
Can you be cold like stone?
And now you're here overgrown
