She was revealed to me a succubus. 
and she was revered to as an angel. 
And she got me hooked upon the Satan. 
Iâve crossed paths with lifeâs most precious bargain. 

Its never-ending, transcending, 
I choose to ignore. I am apathy. 
Surrendering, to me everything, 
to become a whore for the man it seems. 
And now I am your souls companion.. 
I will reveal your revelation. 

To you 

Luciphoria 
I live for it all 
Luciphoria 
Iâll live on and on. 

To be unravelled into nature. 
To feel at ease with how a life may go. 
To realise there is no future. 
and realise that Satan lied to you.... you 

Its never-ending, transcending, 
I choose to ignore. I am apathy. 
Surrendering, to me everything, 
to become a whore for the man it seems. 
A once beating heart so old and overgrown. 
This deal with Lucifer has taken its toll. 

Luciphoria 
I live for it all 
Luciphoria 
Iâll live on and on. 

And now my homeâs beneath a mantle. 
All ground above seems oh so fragile. 
My beating heart becomes my own black robe. 
This deal with Lucifer is taking control. 

Luciphoria 
I live for it all 
Luciphoria 
Iâll live on and on 

Iâm never-ending, transcending, 
I choose to ignore. I am apathy. 
Surrendering, to me everything, 
to become a whore for the man it seems. 
And now I am your souls companion.. 
I have revealed your revelation. 

Luciphoria 
I live for it all 
Luciphoria 
Iâll live on and on
