Would you care for me? 
Bring me fruits and wine? 
Two kind souls are we.. 
Legend told me why. 

I canât escape the fear of whatâs been done to me. 
The anger thatâs inside of me wants to be seen. 
An animal, no sense of fear, to be unleashed. 
A metaphor for all the things this world has done to me. 

Would you notice me? 
When thereâs no more time? 
Two kind souls are we.. 
Legend told me why. 

I canât escape the fear of whatâs been done to me. 
The anger thatâs inside of me wants to be seen. 
An animal, no sense of fear, to be unleashed. 
A metaphor for all the things this world has done to me. 

Would you care for me? 
Bring me fruits and wine? 
Two kind souls are we.. 
Legend told me why.

An animal, no sense of fear, to be unleashed. 
A metaphor for all the things this world has done to me
