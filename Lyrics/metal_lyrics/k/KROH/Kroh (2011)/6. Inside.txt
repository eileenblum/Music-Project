We riseâ¦.my thoughts are taking over. 
Insideâ¦.they have revealed their final show. 
Iâve criedâ¦.I canât get any lower. 

Why do you think that Iâm ordinary? 
Itâs what we all would like to know? 
I keep on telling you my thoughts are scary! 

These liesâ¦.are all diseased and left alone. 
They hideâ¦.but once revealed itâs over.

Itâs your fault you did not want to know. 
You just kept on telling me âIâm ordinaryâ. 
A narcotic fuelled one final show.
