See my gentle lady wander, 
through the grounds of Armathwaite 
See her bow her head in sorrow 
as she walks into the night 
how i wish that i could know 
what her past held years ago 

was she torn from her sweet slumber 
by the night birds ghostly call 
was she then aware i followed 
down the stairs across the hall? 
how i wish that i could know 
what did happen years ago 

now shes seen me and she lingers 
wondering weather to approach 
whilst her nervous trembling fingers 
fumble with her moonstone brooch 
how i wish that i could know 
what her past held years ago
