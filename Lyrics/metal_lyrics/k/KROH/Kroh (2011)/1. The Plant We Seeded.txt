Speak through me, sympathy, 
I have cried these eyes dry. 
Spoken words, and symphonies, 
all expressed through white lined smiles. 

All in the name of Lucifer. 
The plant we seeded, Lucifer 
There when we needed. 

Broken hope, still lingers in, 
My obsessed pathetic life. 

All in the name of Lucifer. 
The plant we seeded, Lucifer 
There when we needed. 

My body twisted into shapes that I have done to me, 
All for the art of being set free. 
One tiny drop of the elixir lets the third eye see. 
Too spread the word through he who sings. 

Lucifer 
The influence of Lucifer, 

To feed upon what will become the feathered angel wing. 
And crystallize this foreign fear. 
One day we will return and look upon the faces dear. 
But just for now we will revere. 

Please free me 
Please 
Please free me 

Lucifer 
All in the name of Lucifer. 
The plant we seeded, 
Lucifer 
There when we needed. 
Lucifer 
All in the name of Lucifer 
The plant we seeded, 
Lucifer
