Maybe I died? 
How would I know? 
It feels like I lost a soul. 
Something inside tells me I know, 
it tells me where to go. 

Give back my mind, 
give back my soul, 
and give back a sense of control. 

Still wonder what is real and what is fantasy, 
still walking down the path of distant memories, 
still haunted by those melodiesâ¦ 
youâve taken away from me. 

No sense of time, 
I should have known, 
too much to take in whole. 
And I panic, why? 
I do not know, 
these butterflies turn to crows. 

And they do not fly, 
thereâs nowhere to go, 
they burrow into my soul. 

Still wonder what is real and what is fantasy, 
still walking down the path of distant memories, 
still haunted by those melodiesâ¦ 
youâve taken away from me. 

I canât contain this hunger, 
so weak yet pain grows stronger, 
you fed me insanity, 
look what you have done to me. 

Maybe I died, 
how would I know, 
feels like I lost my soul. 

Still wonder what is real and what is fantasy, 
still walking down the path of distant memories, 
still haunted by those melodiesâ¦ 
youâve taken away from me. 

ahhhhhh
