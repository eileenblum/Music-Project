[performed by Kroh]I always wanted
to feel so weightless
to smother faces and
leave them breathless
But this wasn't to be...
the tables turned upon me

You run your fingers through my old familiar hair,
wishing I was someone else

White Lies

To take what's precious and leave it hated,
to speak a tongue so enunciated
To bring these words out of me,
his suicide so appeased

You run your fingers through my old familiar hair,
wishing I was someone else

White Lies

We are received. We breathe the air.
All eyes on me, speak what is said
To hold the seed, behold the heir
A throne out of me... of bone and hair

You run your fingers through my old familiar hair
Wishing I was someone else

White Lies
