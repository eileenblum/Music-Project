Seething allergy,
Hunger inside me,
Seems to desolate
all humanity.

Atrophy, malady
Atrophy, malady

No oneâs gonna mend the ill.
Climbing up Golgotha hill.

Crawling out my ears,
Sliding down my spine,
So much senseless death
In the name of what?

Rusty fingernails,
Dragging down the wall.
Silent massacre
In the name of what?

No oneâs gonna mend the ill.
Climbing up Golgotha hill.

Atrophy, malady
Atrophy, malady

No oneâs gonna mend the ill.
Climbing up Golgotha hill.
