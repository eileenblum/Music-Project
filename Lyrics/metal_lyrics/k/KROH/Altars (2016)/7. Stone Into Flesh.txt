My blood flows in sobs,
The way the fountain overflows.
But thereâs no wound,
And he cries as it goes.

It covers all living things
And keeps them all well fed.
It turns stone into flesh
As it covers the world red.

The dead lie laughing as I drink
The needles in my happy eyes,
Like sin in holy water fonts,
I feel their tortured howling rise.

My blood is my bones,
The way a mountainâs overthrown,
But thereâs no wound,
My own skin, not my bones.

They dead they bow before they drink,
The seed is sown before my eyes.
Like sin in holy water font,
My undead is a surprise.

My blood is my bones,
The way a mountainâs overthrown,
But thereâs no wound,
My own skin, not my bones.

Flooding lakes of blood is where all your sorrows sink.
What haunts the heart brings my sacred blood
For all the whores to drink.
One crimson tide and scarlet wave offering short supply
What haunts the heart boils the sacred blood,
As I begin to drown.

My blood flows in sobs,
The way the mountainâs overthrown.
But thereâs no wound,
And she cries as she goes.

It covers all living things
And keeps them all well fed,
It turns stone into flesh
As it covers the world red.

The dead lie laughing as I sink,
The seed is sown before my eyes.
Like sin in holy water fonts,
I feel their tortured howling rise.

My blood is in my bones.
The way the mountainâs overthrown.
But thereâs no wound.
My own skin, not my bones.

Ave! Ave! Ave! Ave!
