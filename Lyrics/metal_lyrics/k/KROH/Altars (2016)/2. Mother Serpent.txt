Narcotic sweetness,
The finest of them all.
Lying in stillness,
like glass eyed feeble doll.

How do you like me now?
Angelic in my skin?
Following like a lamb,
The purest gold on earth
Erasing every stain.
Exposing inner shame,
Unholy kiss of death,
Ancestral sin.

Delicate surface,
Upon my loverâs chest,
Cathartic silence,
I take you to my grave.

How do you like me now?
Angelic in my skin?
Following like a lamb,
The purest gold on earth
Erasing every stain.
Exposing inner shame,
Unholy kiss of death,
Ancestral sin.

Following like a lamb,
The purest gold on earth
Erasing every stain.
Exposing inner shame,
Unholy kiss of death,
Ancestral sin.
