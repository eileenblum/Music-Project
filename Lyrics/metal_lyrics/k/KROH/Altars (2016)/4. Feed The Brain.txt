Split my brain and perforate the mind.
Drill away to leave me pure and kind.

Feed the brain,
Feed the brain.

Shape the clay of memories in time.
Human flesh; so weak yet so sublime.

Feed the brain!

Watch Belial descending, descending.
Watch Belial descending, descending.

Neuro void, identity decay.
Child reborn, shaking in dismay.

Feed the brain!
Feed the brain!
