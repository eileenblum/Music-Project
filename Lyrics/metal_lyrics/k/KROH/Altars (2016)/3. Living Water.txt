Loving father makes his children burn.
Cleansing slaughter takes its final turn.
Crows and angels cannot be in love.
Cain killed Abel, sold his putrid soul.

Who will find joy in your torment?
Who will silence your last lament?

Ignite this holy fire,
Build chasm in the sky.
Misguided by desire,
They slander and conspire.

Guilty pleasure rules the sacred laws,
Wealth and treasure dominate the world.
Sinful daughters praise the bleeding sun,
Living water washes filthy hands.

Who will find joy in your torment?
Who will silence your last lament?

Ignite this holy fire,
Build chasm in the sky.
Misguided by desire,
They slander and conspire.

Whereâs your brother?
I can hear his blood.
Calling my name,
Six feet under ground.
Green eyed monster
Caught him by the neck
He took his final breath.

Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy!

Ignite this holy fire,
Build chasm in the sky.
Misguided by desire,
They slander and conspire.
