Dear Lord, can you hear my beating heart?
Pounding inside my chest to be ripped apart.
My swollen eyelids shut, mouth open wide.
Thereâs just one final step. The noose tightens up.

I only wanted to be someone else.
I only wanted to be someone else.

On the other side there is no sound.
No one calls your name deep under ground.

The colours fade away to bleach all the scars.
Inhaling all my fears was never enough.
Hands tied behind my back, limbs paralysed.
Slowly escaping life, eternal demise.

I only wanted to be someone else.
I only wanted to be someone else.

On the other side there is no sound.
No one calls your name deep under ground.
Heavy filthy mud filling my lungs,
Brittle precious bones break and collapse.

Close your eyes. You have never been alive.
Close you eyes. Thereâs a devil on your side.
Close your eyes. You have never been alive.
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

On the other side there is no sound.
No one calls your name deep under ground.
Heavy filthy mud filling my lungs,
Brittle precious bones break and collapse.
