Darkness inside this prison
Is taking my breath away.
Shrinks never try to reason
With voices inside my head.

Burning my eyes with embers,
Turning my skin to dust.
Drawing blood from my vessels,
Glorious essence of life.

Leaving me cold and empty,
Keeping me locked away.
I used to be the master.
Now I am just a slave.

Oh, can you hear them calling?
Oh, canât you see itâs coming?

Break the bread son of Seth,
Feed the prey, bless profane.

Enslaving all my senses.
Iâm catching a hateful stare.
Everythingâs blurred and hazy,
I have become a prey.

Covering me in slashes,
Bruising my filthy hands.
Iâm taking back my freedom,
I have become a god.

Oh, can you hear them calling?
Oh, canât you see itâs coming?

Break the bread son of Seth,
Feed the prey, bless profane.

(Iâm not insane. Iâll break the chains.)

And right in this moment I want to die.
And right in this moment I need to die.
And right in this moment youâll see me die.
And right in this moment you watch me die.

Break the bread son of Seth,
Feed the prey, bless profane.

Iâm not insane. Iâll break the chains.
Another slave fading away.
