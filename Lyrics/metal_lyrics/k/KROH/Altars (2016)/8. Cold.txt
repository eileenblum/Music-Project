I saw endless crowds of people roaming senselessly
Spreading the pervasive sickness of divine justice.
I tasted the septic poison of fabricated truth
Warping the sense of morality with oppression and greed.
I heard the cries of prodigal sons returning home in vain,
Forever lost but never found.
I touched the void between the space and time,
I walked the bridge between the darkness and the light,
The alpha and omega.
I shed my own skin to rid of the fear and loathing
That I was feeding with from the day I was born.
I rebuilt from the ashes and dust.
I need no one to save me from the floods,
No one to save me from the hunger and war,
No one to save me from the burning pain of human existence.
Nobody owns me, nobody commands me.
I am my own prophet.
