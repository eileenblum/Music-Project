As a flower's stem rips its way through the soil 
And a neonate takes a breath, 
The earth was born as a child to the mother of all 
From the universal force, eternal and infinite 

As life flows and the bliss erodes, the will to be 
Gains strength in a growing soul 
For us to see the beauty of a perfectly carved stone 
Durga Maa, preserve thy seed, for the seed has grown! 

Om Dum Durgayei Namaha 
Slayer of the ignorant 
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha 
Face the one who is deceived 
Om Aing Hring Kleeng 
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha 
Chamundaye Vichchey Om 
She who holds the divine smile 
Om Aing Hring Kleeng 
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha 
Chamundaye Vichchey Om 

As petals fall and leaves dry out, 
Eyes turn white, becoming a mirror inside, 
Which pictures the cosmic cycle free of sin.. 
Durga Maa, erase the seed, may new life begin! 

Om Dum Durgayei Namaha 
Slayer of the ignorant 
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha 
Face the forever naive 
Om Aing Hring Kleeng 
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha 
Chamundaye Vichchey Om 
She who holds the divine smile 
Om Aing Hring Kleeng 
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha 
Chamundaye Vichchey Om 
Cast your light on the world 

Ananta, Sarvavidya, Sundari, Devamata 
The power of all, the power beyond the world - 
Durga Maa, mother of the universe 

Om Dum Durgayei Namaha 
Slayer of the ignorant 
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha 
Gift the one who believes 
Om Aing Hring Kleeng 
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha 
Chamundaye Vichchey Om 
She who holds the divine smile 
Om Aing Hring Kleeng 
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha 
Chamundaye Vichchey Om
