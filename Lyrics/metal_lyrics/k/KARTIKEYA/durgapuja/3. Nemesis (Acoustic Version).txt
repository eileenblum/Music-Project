The beast arrives once more!
Art thou in benefit or loss?
This is the Eschaton once more!
O, mighty one, take my hand!

Many thousand years have passed me by
As I watch games of gods
for men's lifes,
They bet souls on souls!
Catastrophe awaits
to flow down on sinful
bodies of pityful ones

The beast arrives once more!
Art thou in benefit or loss?
This is the eschaton once more!
0, mighty one, take my hand!

I am thy Archnemesis!
And I take you as my redemption
for all...
