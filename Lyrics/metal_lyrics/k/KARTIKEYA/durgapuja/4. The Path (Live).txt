Parting with the ways of forgotten tribes
And becoming a grain of sand
In the desert of hypocrisy, filth and lies
Lost is the grip of divinity's hand
Parting with the ways of the fallen ones
Drowning in the waters of sin
Dweller of the worlds of shadows and grief,
May thy path begin!

Open your eyes and let them be
A guide through the mist of hate
Make your demons finally see
A fortified wall with a locked up gate
Find yourself in this burning pit
Of damned foresaken souls
Free yourself and show your wings
To the beings left below

Open every door
That stands between you and the Light
Breaking through the core
Of hatred left inside your mind

Learning from the lands of the universe
Speaking the words of bliss
Gaining wisdom from the past
Crushing the blight with divinity's fist
Following the ways of the fallen ones
Floating in the waters of grace
Sculptor of the stone of infinity
Thy path has just begun!

Open every door
That stands between you and the Light
Breaking through the core
Of hatred left inside your mind

Breaking every wall surrounding
Keys to domes of sanctity,
Spread your wings and fly forever
Cleanse your mind and set it free
