Kingdoms merge in the quest for might
Lords seek pleasure to feed their desires
Reigning in gold yet losing the truth
Meaningless yagya pouring oil into fires

Vedas divide as does a Brahmin's mind
Souls separate from the cosmic essence
Sri bhagavan, will they keep what they find
Leaving their faiths with no defence?

One obtains false desires
The other falls from grace
Brothers stand on the opposite sides
He who plays with the fire
Gets intensely burnt
When he steps on the path of a liar

Behold the rising wall
Dividing the sacred realms
And the worlds of man

Behold the waking faces of dawn
As the supreme lord returns to his above

One obtains false desires
The other falls from grace
Brothers stand on the opposite sides
He who plays with the fire
Gets intensely burnt
When he steps on the path of a liar
