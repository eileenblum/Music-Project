Bow thy head
Before the golden throne
Before the chariots
Before the divine might
As armies grow, countless people rise
Legions of the holy war machine prepare to fight

Lay thy hand
On the sacred blade of truth
That splits an evil heart
And spills the blood of the impure
As banners rise above the heads of men
That shall stand for their lords
And battle to the end

All heads are turned towards the west
All torches burn as souls unite
They lay their hands upon their chests
A million eyes, they shine so bright

Panchajanyam Hrishikesho
Devadattam Dhananjayah
Paundram dadhmau maha-sankham
Bhima karma vrkodara
Sa ghosho dhartarashtranam
Hridayani vyadarayat
Nabha cha prthivim caiva
Tumulo bhyanunadayan

All heads are turned towards the west
All torches burn as souls unite
They lay their hands upon their chests
A million eyes, they shine so bright

Bow thy head
Before the void
Of countless deaths
And broken lives
