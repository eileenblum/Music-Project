Nityasundara
Beloved of the evershining star
Sarvatapana
Divine destroyer of filth and blight
Kailashnath
Dweller of the sacred mount
Mahadeva
I bow before thy grace

Om Namah Shivaya
I pray 'til the end of days in solitude
I perform my tapasya for you

Raise thy hand upon my faith
I devote myself to thee

Bhairav
The darkness that enlights the blinded night
Kamalakshana
The eye that cleansed the world of false beliefs
Chandrapal
The moon crowns thy head
Bhooteshwara
Ashes of the fallen ones shall be thy bed

Lay thy hand upon my soul
He who carries the head of Brahma,
Speak thy word

Lingadhyakshasa
Thy lingam, worshipped by a million souls
Nataraja
The cosmic dance that crushes countless worlds
Rudra
By your command I sacrifice myself
Sadashiva
Thy feet I lay upon my head

Om Namah Shivaya
I pray 'til the end of days in solitude
I perform my tapasya for you

Om Namah Shivaya
