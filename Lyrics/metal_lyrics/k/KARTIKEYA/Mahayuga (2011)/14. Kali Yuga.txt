Thou shall be denied, o holy one
By ignorant fools who plague the dying world
I hear the winds blowing over ashes and ruins
Of all that was sacred for every soul
May the end begin for it was told
That the cycle shall end to be born once more
I stand in the dust of once sacral soul
Humbly chanting thy name

See the father cry as the mother eats her child
Awaking an orgy of sacrilege and blight
See the genocide and bloodshed, raging armies rise
In the desecrated fortress of hatred and lies
Hear the harlot's scream, see the drunken smile
Sodomic rapture, cauldrons of bile
Innocence is raped by godless desires
Leaving the whole world vile

Sanctity in life, purity in mind
Sacrificed on the altar of blight
Suicide and lies, ignorance inside
What is pure is left to die

All ears are closed
And eyes are turned away
As children cry

So many years of carving faith
Put to an end by peoples hate
We are slaves
We are the end
Blasphemers reign in gold, as the holy drown in filth
All hope is lost as the sinners rule the earth

Sanctity in life, purity in mind
Sacrificed on the altar of blight
Suicide and lies, ignorance inside
What is pure is left to die

Those who seek salvation in this dying world
Shall find eternal peace by chanting the name of the lord
