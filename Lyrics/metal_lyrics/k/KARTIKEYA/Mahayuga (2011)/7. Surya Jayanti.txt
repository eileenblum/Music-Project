Rays pierce the clouds
In transcendental rapture
Waking all those
Who have fallen asleep
All crooked thoughts
And raging disasters
Vanish in the ocean
Of prayers and joy!

Om Suraya Namaha
Om Suraya Namaha
Om Suraya Namaha
Om Suraya Namaha

Becoming one with the divine grace
I raise my hands in order to reach the skies
Om Suraya Namaha, leave thy trace
In countless human lives

Open your eyes, open your heart
Let the sun dry every tear
Open your mind, open your soul
Embrace the light of the burning sphere

We celebrate the birth
Of the bringer of light
And drown in the essence
Of the newborn sun
Fear not, those captured
By the night
Chant the name of the
Burning one!

Om Suraya Namaha
Om Suraya Namaha
Om Suraya Namaha
Om Suraya Namaha

Becoming one with the divine grace
I raise my hands in order to reach the skies
Om Suraya Namaha, leave thy trace
In countless human lives

Open your eyes, open your heart
Let the sun dry every tear
Open your mind, open your soul
Float in the rays of the burning sphere
