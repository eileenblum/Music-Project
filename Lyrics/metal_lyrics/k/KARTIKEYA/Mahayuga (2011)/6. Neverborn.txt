I am a symbol of a golden age
Where pain is blind and pleasure reigns
I am the master of tranquil waters
Which bear the essence of peace and grace
I am the serpent who lies upon
The golden statue with wings of stone
I am the eyes of a fallen god
Who once could see the truth
That remained unknown

I am the keeper of faith
I am the sun that fades away
I am the one whose life is torn
I am the child that was never born

The voices of million souls
Collide with the light
The tears of a million eyes
Forever denied

I shall be the never born
One whose life is a lie
I shall sleep on a bed of thorns
I shall be crucified

I am a sage with a broken soul
A sacred lake that has no shores
I am a seed that never grows
A ruined home with countless doors

I am the keeper of faith
I am the sun that fades away
I am the one whose life is torn
I am the child that was never born

The voices of million souls
Collide with the light
The tears of a million eyes
Forever denied

I shall be the never born
One whose life is a lie
I shall sleep on a bed of thorns
I shall be crucified
