We seek illuminance!
Cried the blinded mass
For being cast down
To the depths of depths they are
A million prayers
Vanished in the void
Another voiceless soul
Is banished from the universe

I see the absolute darkness
I scream in a moment of silence
I feed the mouthless ones
I lead the choirs of oblivion

Forsaken is the beast within
Destructed is the will to live
Aborted is the only child
Chosen by fate
As the savior of light

As I seek someone below
My own consciousness
As I seek someone below
The smouldering pit of ancient demons

The banished servants feasting on the dead
Are waken only to fall asleep again
I summon thee, o fallen king of blasted world
For here thy will is the will of all!

As I seek someone below
The flame that burns my feet
As I seek someone below
My own self, which is one with eternity

I see the absolute darkness
I scream in a moment of silence
I feed the mouthless ones
I lead the choirs of oblivion
