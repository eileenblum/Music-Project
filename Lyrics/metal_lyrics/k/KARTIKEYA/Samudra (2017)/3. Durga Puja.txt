As a flower's stem rips its way through the soil
And a neonate takes a breath,
The earth was born as a child to the mother of all
From the universal force, eternal and infinite

As life flows and the bliss erodes, the will to be
Gains strength in a growing soul
For us to see the beauty of a perfectly carved stone
Durga Maa, preserve thy seed, for the seed has grown!

Om Dum Durgayei Namaha
Slayer of the ignorant
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha
Face the one who is deceived
Om Aing Hring Kleeng
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha
Chamundaye Vichchey Om
She who holds the divine smile
Om Aing Hring Kleeng
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha
Chamundaye Vichchey Om

As petals fall and leaves dry out,
Eyes turn white, becoming a mirror inside,
Which pictures the cosmic cycle free of sin..
Durga Maa, erase the seed, may new life begin!

Om Dum Durgayei Namaha
Slayer of the ignorant
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha
Face the forever naive
Om Aing Hring Kleeng
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha
Chamundaye Vichchey Om
She who holds the divine smile
Om Aing Hring Kleeng
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha
Chamundaye Vichchey Om
Cast your light on the world

Ananta, Sarvavidya, Sundari, Devamata
The power of all, the power beyond the world -
Durga Maa, mother of the universe

Om Dum Durgayei Namaha
Slayer of the ignorant
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha
Gift the one who believes
Om Aing Hring Kleeng
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha
Chamundaye Vichchey Om
She who holds the divine smile
Om Aing Hring Kleeng
Om Dum Durgayei Namaha
Chamundaye Vichchey Om
