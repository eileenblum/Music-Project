It reached out its claws
To crush the tender stem of life,
To puncture the lung of faith,
Leave it to choke to death.
Quenching its thirst with tears
Of children as they cry,
Begging mothers to breathe...

As a traitor you are sentenced to live your life in fear
And face death with a sudden dagger in your back!
As a traitor you are sentenced to fall from the throne
As you left endless veins without serum...

For you have betrayed the divine!
You have betrayed your kin!
But they shall suffer no more!

The horrors of home
Feel the weakness of your soul,
The horrors of home -
So unforgiving...
The horrors are not alone
In their sacrificing role.
The horrors of home...

The curse is forming roads
That promise no return,
Leaving no time to think
And look behind.
Bleeding your way
To end the terror from inside?
Bodies shall pave the trail...

As a traitor you shall be denied by every single being
Which bares the spark of mind in its eyes!
As a traitor you shall never survive the billion arrows you shot
As they turn back upon you and strike!

For you have betrayed the divine!
You have betrayed your kin!
But they shall suffer no more,
Your horrors freed them from sin...

The horrors of home
Feel the weakness of your soul,
The horrors of home -
So unforgiving...
The horrors are not alone
In their sacrificing role.
The horrors of home...
