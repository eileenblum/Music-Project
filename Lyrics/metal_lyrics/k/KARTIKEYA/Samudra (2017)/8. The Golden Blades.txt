See the waters divide
As we rise from below
See the sparks in our eyes
As the sun guides our will to grow

See the vortex
Churning the ocean
Raising waves to the sky
See the fire
Burning all demons
Gracefully muting their cry

Gather, gather
Warriors of light
We stand united
And ready to fight
Let the sacred virya
Prosper within
Cleansing our souls from sin
Gather, gather
Sons of the gods
Never surrender
Against all the odds
We are born to bring down
Thousands of gates
We are the golden blades!

Feel the presence, divine
As our blades turn to gold
Pave the way of the prime
As we gather to face the world

Hear the horns of
A holy parade,
The victorious call
Hear the voice of
The devas upon you
Blessing to conquer all

Gather, gather
Warriors of light
We stand united
And ready to fight
Let the sacred virya
Prosper within
Cleansing our souls from sin
Gather, gather
Sons of the gods
Never surrender
Against all the odds
We are born to bring down
Thousands of gates
We are the golden blades!
