In vain are all efforts
Of judging the will of the mighty saviour!
Corrosion of earth is cloaked by words.
Today I see you at his feet,
Frustrate you never will The Almighty One!

"Worship the savior!"
"Worship the savior!"
Or die in inhuman pain
Or feel the wrath of Ra

Lost in a stream of godlike creatures,
Serving and lauding for eternal peace.
Today I see you at his feet,
Frustrate you never will The Almighty One!

From the Nile I hear too many prophesies to learn
About retribution of the Mighty One
"Feel the wrath of Ra!"
"We are to pray eternal!"
"Here comes the world damnation!"
"This is the end!"

For Gods you are a slave,
One from a tribe of slaves!
For freedom you can pray,
Only no need - you will get none!
Today I see you at his feet,
Frustrate you never will The Almighty One!

"Worship the savior!"
"Worship the savior!"
