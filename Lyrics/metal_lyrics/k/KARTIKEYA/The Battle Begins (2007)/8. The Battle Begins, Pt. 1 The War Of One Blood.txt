When kingdoms
Hold might never seen before,
When being so powerful,
When their lands cover half of the world,
When kingdoms hold temples
And monuments that reach the sky
Even brothers can fall into jealousy,
Can make a brother die!

The monolithic Pandavan empire
Never ever tore apart
For its men were forever
Bond by divity and blood.

But once blood fails!
Former brothers turn into foes.
Dhuryodana's legions willed to claim
Their part of the world!

The choice was made!
Never could the empire be divided.
Not even Krishna could make
The Pandavan surrender.
The war of one blood began!

When kingdoms
Hold might never seen before,
When being so powerful,
When their lands cover half of the world,
When kingdoms hold temples
And monuments that reach the sky
Even brothers can fall into jealousy,
Can make a brother die!
