Harsh lines of endless sands I meet on my way,
On my way to the oasis I seek
Closed are my eyes in protection from the blight,
Feasting on the fallen beasts, vultures cry...

Heat of wind!
Fire of earth!
Ancient gods!
Cloak the...

Oasis!
From mortal sight...

Trying to pave the way to my eternal goal,
This pool of godly fluid, juice, granting life
There is no passage for retreat,
Too this journey was for going back...

Further went the line of my sight,
I saw a God in the sky.
My humble soul, tired in its cage,
Was now willing lo leave!
From now I travelled without the burden of flesh
For I was free in my thoughts and will,
I could now reach the end...

Life's harder than that,
Dream is like reality.

Heat of wind!
Fire of earth!
Ancient gods!
Cloak the...

Oasis!
From mortal sight...

The taste of the holy essence gives me immortal life,
I had dreamt of from the beginning of all.
As said by the gods, this life is not for mortal beings,
And they will feel the pain of disgrace!
