O, king of demigods!
Raise a hand upon my head
We forever sacrificed
Our souls to you!

Your thunders penetrate the skies,
Cleansing the earth from filth and lies!

Shaking the unshakable,
You travel alone, crushing foes.
The skies, the earth, mountains and rocks
Stand still by your will, by your command!

Your thunders penetrate the skies,
Cleansing the earth from filth and lies!

O, king of demigods!
Raise a hand upon my head
Let me get a second of paradise!
Let me get your blessings for aeons!

Your thunders penetrate the skies,
Cleansing the earth from filth and lies!

Bless my name!
Bless my faith!
Bless my flame!
Bless my hate!
Bless the light
Of my soul!
All this blight
Away you throw!
Bless the earth!
Bless the soil!
Bless the waves!
Bless my grave!
Bless the fire
In my heart!
For thy blessings
I'll tear myself apart!

Your thunders penetrate the skies,
Cleansing the earth from filth and lies!
