From now I see die downfall of the human race itself!
Come down my child, for I will show you the way to eternal hell!

Enter my dome and I will teach you how to sink
Into the darkness of mankind and its will.
Corrosion of earth is gaining endless gifts
Of humble lives and souls tormented and with no hope left.

Will thou see me through scales of lie?
Will thou feel sick in claws of death?

This is often getting on your feeble nerves,
Your irritating helplessness does serve the lord of sin.

From now I set the downfall of the human race itself!
Come down my child, for I will show you the way to eternal hell!

Enter my dome and I will teach you how to sink
Into the darkness of mankind and its will.
Corrosion of earth is gaining endless gifts
Of humble lives and souls tormented and with no hope left!
