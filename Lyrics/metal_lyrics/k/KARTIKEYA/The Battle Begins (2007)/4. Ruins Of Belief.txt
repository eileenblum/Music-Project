Endless lava streams,
Stars and skies
Bare the memories
Of ancient traditions forgotten by man!
The reason for bloodshed,
The reason for wars,
The times when sacred Vedas
Were brought to our hordes!

For two thousand years
Our people starved
Under the reign
Of priests of a new god.
O, Shiva!
Grant us the sound of thy name,
the will to crush poverty,
the strength to tear our chains!

Arise!

Let it be done,
Let it be done,
Let me be strong
To carry on!
Let it be done,
Let it be done,
Grant me with flame
To make me live!
Let it be done,
Let it be done,
Tell me a word
As to a son!
Let it be done,
Let it be done,
Let it be done!

When thy word is heard
Memories of elements return to man!
