I spit out the venom
Brought to me by life.
I denied my sacrifice,
I didn't let myself to
Arise!

I spit out the venom
Brought to me by a demonic curse!
Destroyed is my life,
I didn't let myself to arise!
Too many injuries I have,
To many bleeding wounds,
Lying on the ground
I leave you my words...

Choking, we are unable to breathe,
The darkest angels cry upon us.
Too natural to be a dream!
My life is drained...

Unleash thy spirit!
Unleash thy spirit!
Let it fall into
The abyss of time.
Unleash thy spirit!
Unleash thy spirit!
Make a gift for the heavens -
Your soul divine!
Unleash thy spirit!
Unleash thy spirit!
It is too fragile
For your flesh...
Unleash thy spirit,
Let it fly,
Before you leave life,
Before you die!

I spit out the venom
Brought to me by life.
I denied my sacrifice,
I didn't let myself to
Arise!

Unleash thy spirit!
Unleash thy spirit!
Let it fall into
The abyss of time.
Unleash thy spirit!
Unleash thy spirit!
Mike a gift for the heavens -
Your soul divine!
Unleash thy spirit!
Unleash thy spirit!
It is too fragile for your flesh...
Unleash thy spirit,
Let it fly,
Before you leave life,
Before you die!
