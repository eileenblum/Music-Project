The secrecy of the fierce night
Overwhelmed me with a great fright
And sanity with a wild blast
cruelly unleashed the beasts of past

Shocking me Killing me
Trashing my Destiny
Still this man Trying to
Tear down all That I am

Beyond this sham stands a man
Trying to kill all that I am
Still this man trying to
Tear down all that I am!
