You bid my name, I crawl and take the blame
your tears dry, leaving me only stains

reminders where you laid your face...
right next to mine, in our final embrace.

empty words fell from your lips
falling away, you plead then betray

I'm bound in pain, my doom delivered
To dead memories, a silent surrender

the earth beneath our bed shifted
light as shadow you were lifted
you hid where I couldn't follow
your voice sounded so hollow

with the promise of a lonely eternity,
I pledge myself to keep our memory.
and while the world burns to ash and cinder,
with my dying breath, a prayer I send her,
raising the flames of my funreal pyre...
don't turn your back to me now, my ashen liar
