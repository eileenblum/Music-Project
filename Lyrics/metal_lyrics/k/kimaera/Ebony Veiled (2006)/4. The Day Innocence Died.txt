Every shred of hope has been doomed to decay
Withering away from my forgotten eyes
I knew innocence until this very day
Now I'm rendered to another faceless shade

The light has ripped quickly away
As evil unleashed its wrath upon purity
Beautiful altered to morbid and plain
And smears of lust stain what was fairly white

Ignorant of evil unaware of darkness
In the great abyss of frailty, I tripped
Enthralled into agony and pain
From my childish dreams unshamefully I was stripped

I cannot cease the stream of sorrow
Lone I bask the frissons of wickedness
A shroud enslaving my whole existence
Burying me in past throes..

Tis pitiful to succumb such outrage
Beauty and the beast the horrid fairytale
A mortifiying happening dims
All the fortunes of a lifetime
