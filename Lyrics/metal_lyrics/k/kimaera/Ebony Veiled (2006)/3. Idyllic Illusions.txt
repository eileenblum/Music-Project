Born inside of U and fed from ur body
Lost inside ur eyes and found in ur heart
I'll kiss ur sweet tears and taste grief from ur lips
I'll die with ur hopes and fly with ur dreams
Still bereavement defeats my ardour

- your brawn will be my grave
- And your soul my heaven
- U will carve away my life
- And my bones shall become dust
- I will drink your blood
- I will wipe your frozen tears
- I will hold your fear
- your pain shall fade away

Come and fly with me my fallen one
There's a place we have to find
In this gloomy world we drowned
Hold me now to set us free.
