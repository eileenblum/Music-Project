Chained and locked inside of me
Waiting for the loss of time
To unfold her mystery
Before the tomb of my crime

The nights can be so blackened
When I'm hanging upon doubt
And these smiles can be so saddened
When they're only painted out

In his darkest hours he smiled to me
And his eyes clasped a reverie
He cast away my wistful yore
And all memories of pains I bore

Still she dwells within her past
Trying to deny it's real
That her love could never last
Am I the cure for her to heal?

But It's me (her)
And just me (her)
So misled
Here among the dead
