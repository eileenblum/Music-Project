The hole U digg in me
Is deeper everyday
This broken man U see
Is slowly in decay

Pain enslaved my soul
Left me no place to hide
Watch me now as I fall
I fall away from pride

Agony has shattered my will
I have become so fucken ill
Get out of my way I'm somehow dead
U cannot know wut's in my head

This hate inside of me
Is raging just like hell
Clawing my shallow skin
Breaking free from its shell

I can no longer cope
My heart is died in black
I've simply lost all hope
Now all I do is attack

Come behold my inside and U shall see
I'm just a mess of hostility!
