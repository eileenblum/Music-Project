Lo a perishing rose
As graceful as dawn
Stormed by depravity
Ravished... Left in demise

Harken her threnody
Chanting a lost elan
Succumbed by scattered dreams
Lost hopes and helplessness

Behold her crystal tears
Brooding her pallid cheeks
Sad eyes throttling a shade
Quenching my glutted heart

Her dying hand burns mine
Her frozen lips sear me
Jaded breath... Idle gaze
Wretched spirit carving me

Stale reveries loom within me
Meddling before my bleak eyes
My stark heart yens for your warmth
But demise defeats my urge

Her dying struck his darkened heart
In despair he lusts for her still
His glowering spirit longs for her soul
Uttered in angellore

In woeful secrecy I crave for you
For my grim heart no longer owns your love
Captivate my heart with your love dirge
I'm forsaken to death, the cruelest of all plots
Into your solacing arms I give way
Still my heart cleaves to yours forevermore

I hunger for her eyes
My smeared eyes for yours only crave

My ardour with her dies
Your love I shall take to my grave

Forsook by the heavens
You dwell within me evermore

I'm aghast... Mend my fears
Forever I chant your dear tears.
