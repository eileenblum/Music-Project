"Woman! Go and sin no more!"
Crawl back in, to your darkest shell
Steal the light and turn day into night

Then tear this flesh apart and devour me
Feed this bestial urge, oh lustful villain
Swallow my dripping blood and kiss me coldly
Embrace the remains of a hollow man

I chant to you hymns of purity and tunes of virtue
Blessed I am, daughter of eve, among all women

Come be crowned and be queen
To reside in your rightful place
Build your throne with my broken bones
Upon this broken will of a man

Seek me, under this eternal spell
Take me, away from this Hell
'Tis so tragic to see what has truly become of us

Feed me your lies, burn the memories I left behind
Make them undone, your shadow haunts me down
