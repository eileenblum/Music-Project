You heirs of sin, invite me in
Crawl through my pale skin
Bid welcome to my desire

Come break me down, come choke me up
Smother the human in me and set that wicked free
Shaped of filth and shame, cursed by thy name
With head held low, flows of pity and woe

Pierce my hollow self, the vanity of a wretched one
Satiate this sickening void, with profound looks of scorn

Bite hard, bite deep, your bitter poison I keep

The shroud of gloom falls upon me
The rivers of blood stream from my devoted veins

Behold and lo, the ruins of me
Speak of me not! With your poisonous tongues
Words will shatter in your books of rust
Oh you ancient serpents of lies and lust!

Unfold this rapture and that horror
From these dark eyes of the abhorrer
The heirs of sin, they dwell within
The venom they sire, their burning fire
Fear them not, their haunting shadow
Dare to succumb, drag you below

Tempt you not, their vicious charm
No time for lament, but only harm!
