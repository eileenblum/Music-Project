Our dark room, lying there bereaved
Drowned in woe, our fate is sealed
Your bleak body, wrapped in mine
Shredding red, like a glass of wine

We stare and we share
Our deepest misfortunes
With every death, with every sigh

And with the last bit you sipped
Our dismal souls are ripped

Hold on to me, as we fall
Demons await, the blackest of all
Deep and horrid is the hole
Bitter was the taste of woe
