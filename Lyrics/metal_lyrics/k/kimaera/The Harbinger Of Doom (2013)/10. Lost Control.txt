[originally by Anathema]Life has betrayed me once again
I accept some things will never change
I've let your tiny minds magnify my agony
And it's left me...
With a chemical dependency, for sanity

Yes, I am falling...
How much longer till I hit the ground?
I can't tell you why I'm breaking down
Do you wonder why I prefer to be alone?
Have I really lost control?

I'm coming to an end
I've realized what I could have been
I can't sleep so I take a breath
And hide behind my bravest mask
I admit I've lost control
