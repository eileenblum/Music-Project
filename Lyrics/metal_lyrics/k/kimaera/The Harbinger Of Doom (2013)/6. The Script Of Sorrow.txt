Life stands still, aroused by a lusterous gaze
Clinging unto moments of timeless joy
Unharmed, unscarred, torpid, dwelt never before
Splendor, passionate, complete, the lure if it all
Fragile, delicate, devoid of her bestial cruelty
As death awaits the yielding of our remains

Keeper of the faith, herald of despair
Bless me oh thy bloody Majesty
As I lie down, with my suffering
Piteous be thy glorious son

Never shall we fail the mourning darks
Never shall we weep the demise of the sun

With wretched hearts and burning fire
These cold hands and open veins
We lay down the script of sorrow
Sealed with blood and a pledge to woe
