Under feverish throes of confused pain
Melts an image in tears, of a girl made of glass
Breaking under the weight of her sorrow
Scattered across the echoing floor

I know pain by a lot of names
But I have only loved it by yours
I've always been alone
But learnt loneliness, by your side

Oh the inconsequence of a casual stray
Her heart's a broken compass
Always pointing to him
Finding a million ways to lose herself in him

While reminisce plays deceitful tunes
Entraps her in wistful longing and sweetly wounds
She is perishing in bloody ceremony
Under the lasting thought of him
It's in his heart, hers seeks its echo
It's his image it clings to and won't let go

Many nights spent in prayer
Loving on bended, bloodied knees
For a caress of hair
For these lips and yours to meet

As life dims all around me
And prospects wither and fade
Lay my body down among the dust to devour me
Just another shadow among the shade
In this wide gulf of tears
Waiting for you, all these years

Still as the cold consumes her
And silence overtakes her
She cannot forget the words
To her song... Only One
