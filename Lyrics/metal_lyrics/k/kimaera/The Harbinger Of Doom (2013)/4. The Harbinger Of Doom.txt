Oh fruit of the divine, bless me with a glimpse
As I kneel before thee and praise thy glory

Bringer of Doom, behold the flame
For angel will fall, fall in thy name

High on your throne, crowned with scars
Your majesty bleeds, blood of the Gods

Your sons of the Earth
And daughters of the sea
Bow before me in shame
For your sins remain

Lay down and give in
As I sing to you this amending hymn
Fall for me, my wasted strife
And I cry for thee, for your life
Bone, flesh and blood, no longer remain
He awaits, the bringer of Doom

Come embrace me, oh my child...
Cursed in life and conquered by death
When you fall, you fall in my name
For I have held, held the flame
