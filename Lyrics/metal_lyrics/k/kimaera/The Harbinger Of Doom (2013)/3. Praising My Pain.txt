Your black hand scars my brawn
Carving your name
Your screams pierce the void
Praising my pain

And the shadows that haunt me still
Silence my throbbing pulse
Awaken to this pitiful reality
But then again, slumber invades my limbs

Nailed to your merciless cross
Rid me from this sickening burden
My fallen empire, a stolen legacy
As Eden crumbles beneath your feet

Kneel before my dying memory
And wither into oblivion
You wallow in your sorrow
I cherish my false Heavens

Your colorless eyes
Your cries of desperation
Your arousing touch still burns my skin
My shameful past, a river of regrets
Drifting along, all that is left
So forgive me as I praise
This unbearable pain
