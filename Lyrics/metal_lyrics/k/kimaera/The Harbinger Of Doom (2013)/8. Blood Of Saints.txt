Feed on me, bleed with me
Misery, our destiny
Shadows fall upon us all
I kneel down so hear my call
When he dies, the Earth cries
Embracing the blackest skies

Cold hands, strike hard with pain
Red tears, fell down like rain
Dark eyes, see right through me
Cruel voice, mourns my body
Your deathless Gods and all their pleas
The Heavens above there at your feet

Take me, we'd be undone
Cut me, we'd lie as one

The blood of Saints on your hands
Nothing left for amends
The guilt, the lies, the cries
Mercy fades from your eyes
