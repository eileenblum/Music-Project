I gave myself to the devil.
With blood, heart, soul, spirit, and mind.
Do adore the baptism ritual, embrace the cold dark night.
I gave myself to the devil. Addicted, And knowing no fear
Renew the contract year by year,
in cruel Faustian visions of might.
A covenant for life and death, a covenant with Hell...
Elohim dead in my way. do not count the corpses slain.
Satan is within me. Know that I am Him.
I am the chosen one for sure, the one for evermore.
Satan is within me, know that I am insane.
Hear the word unspoken, see the things unseen.
And I reach Katharsis. Know that I am Him.
...And the blood of the sun chilled my thirsty throat...
So I met my doom, far off in the haze, where men turn to coal
with a fear in their hearts so sharp.
And so awesome and piercing their screams. Where the tongue
Of the others cannot reach and the black rocks loom.
This is a deliverance of peace. The future shaped deep in my mind
Magnificently. As a piercing sound. And the path of no god...
Where deep waters (eternally) flow... Alas! Possess me through
that liquid essence. A drug like blizzards through my veins.
A sunken land before me -
Dead - so I am... or am I Thy killing hand...
