Sunless woods. Ancient wraiths feast
on the shrieks and the perished
Mighty shields, lances long - Realize my wolfish thoughts...
The world hath gone and lost its glory, pale white moon is to enlight
Scenes so grim and scenes so morbid, And my mad abyssic mind.
Wings of death shadow the mountain where I summon from below
Raise my ripping silver dagger, time standeth still, it moveth so slow...
Dance for the crawling kaos. The blood harvest of centuries...
Ghoul procession. Archangel of Insanity, take my hand! Lord,
Thou tetramorph black, invested with rays! Daimonozomenos I am, Thy son.
Fallen in trance - I can hear His legions - magic din, Horn of Satan...
Bleak wintry graveyard, devastated - make this offering with furious fascination...
Fog surroundeth me - fog enshroudeth me - sickest rapture before the altar...
Fulfill the rite for the Evil Ones yearn in their astral Castles.
Highpriests of the Dark Kingdom, where Death our paths uniteth...
For in my mind they speak to me so shall their will be done
I see the moonlight clearer now. And know the Kingdom cometh...
It will redeem me from this earth, I need another life
Come down and rule the universe! I am ready for their strife.
