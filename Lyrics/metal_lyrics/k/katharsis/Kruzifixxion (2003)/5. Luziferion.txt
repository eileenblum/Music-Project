Praise hail the lord of all abomination,
Master of hellfire and annihilation
Praise hail the One who will conquer the land
Bow down and pray for your death is at hand
He is the dead embracing dark, the holocaustic throne
He ruleth the world, He rideth the wars,
So kneel down and atone in fire...
He is the black ethereal light, He is the shining one
He is the lord of falling stars, He is the blazing sun
Praise hail the Lord on the Holocaust Throne
Worship the King our Infernal Lord
deathstrife and terror crush all you once owned
Luzifer rules, your scum idols - dethroned
