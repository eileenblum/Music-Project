Cruel Sadistic Evil erects the Realm of Darkness
Unholy forces, Powers of Madness...
Holocaustic Throne of Hell,
Pedestral of the Light
Father - Master - Lucifer,
rideth the sea of blood.
Pyroclastic maze grotesque
conquereth what was day
Black Archangel, I call Thee!
Take my soul away...

For in the mirror my face turneth greener
Powers of Madness call from the other side.
Mocking my shadow cast by the candles
Lit where ,y ship wrecked at the seven cliffs of time.
I bathe in flames. Eternal journey.
Into the cauldrons. History melted.
Tentacles touch me. They are the guardians.
Abominations cleansing my mind...
... And the Black Grail shineth.
