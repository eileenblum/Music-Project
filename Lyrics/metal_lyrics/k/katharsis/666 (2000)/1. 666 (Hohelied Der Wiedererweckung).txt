The chains are broken, The gates are open
My paleness turneth to brightness
Where thousand seals inflame the night..
The chains are broken, The gates are open
My mask is sheer terror, but I bring the final calm...

An incarnation of kathairein flesh
Deathcult and Flakk Ameth at trident attack
Replacing hope and holiness...

666 Sinister seed.
Rise from the depths where mortality shall breed
I am the Archangel's bestial eye,
I am the murderer of the holy childe
666 devestator of the suns,
Devestator of the skies, Devestator of the light.

I am the crawling chaos. I am the shining victor.
I am the living death.
So watch your fading vision
While I enter heavenly ground.
So dream your failing prophecy
While I eat your world...

In the battle of conquest be upon the enemy
Give me their flesh to eat.
Hail the one, the blessed beast

Worship Him with swords and spears,
Lift His throne and place
Light devouring gods and men.
And another king shall reign.

Eternal ecstasy of hell
For from the North cometh the pain...
None shall before the One,
Angel of the Bleeding Sun.

Imperial forces raging blow.
A storm of steel awaketh
Cruel pounding hammers of His law
Triumphant Lucifer on the ruins of the world.
