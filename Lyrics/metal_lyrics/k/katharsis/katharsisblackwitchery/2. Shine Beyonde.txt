[performed by Katharsis]It was long times ago
Far yesteryears forever
In my rememberance

Shadows flew so cold and darkk
And I died between the trees

I froze
My blood even fell in crumbs
Instead of a stream out of veins...

I've seen the eternal damnation
It is true it really exists
Immortal torment light
Strong fires
Bright
Shining on through the mist

My eyes: Blinded, bleeding
And a horrible wind blew
Right into my face

Standing as stiffen
In purest pain and fear
I could not move
It was too late

Returned I as a knowing
To tell the mortal race
About the face of future
For everybody waits...
