[performed by Katharsis]What askest thou for light
When thy eye is broken
What askest thou for a gate
When a chasm hath been opened
And made so wide
Come to me - 
Deathwards, deathwards
The splendour of hell
The glory of sin
The first is the last
And death is my art

Keep the furnaces burning...
