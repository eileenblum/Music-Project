Spiritual war-fare, churning mÃ¤elstrom
Twisted bodies, possessed, trapped -
Under siege, cryptic words,
Tongue of the angels,
Knowledge - sorcery - re-incarnation
Winged gargoyles, malformation
Terror to the living
Quintessence of secret doctrines-
From The Mouth Of A Psychopathic God
Bow down as ye enter his kingdome!!!

Bottomless, unbound
A reality behynde reality
An infinity behynde infinity
A truth behynde truth
Forgotten ones
Striving hard, grim retaliation
Atrocious rays
Guardians at the gate of time
Ascend, ascend and sacrifice

Creatures impaled on the horns, of death
Tayste poison from the chalices of doom
Sulphure dreams
Faceless shaypes, depths
Strength of madnesse
I will succeed
Morbid ways
Dungeon fields
Nightfall obeydience
Fullmoon shyne

Kult of fear, spell of sin, shadow wings
Black magick rite

Macromoniall mastership,
Nockturnal malediction

Tyrant in wrath, I hold thy sigils
Dance through the flaymes
I'm growing still
Mysterious and colde place (of) spectre ruins
Here alone we are - the force-that-is...

Skarrs
Give me the power to desecrate
To turn this earth to ashes
A journey across the innermost spheres
I shall not return for a myriad of years

Ascend, ascend and sacrifice
Invoke the pandemonic storms of nighte
