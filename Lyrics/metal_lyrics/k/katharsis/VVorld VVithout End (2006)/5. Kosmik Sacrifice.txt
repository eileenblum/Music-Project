Seven flames encircled by ravens
On the cold vast towers of night.
Defiance and unlight, northern hell,
In dreamcast state betwizt nocturnal shadows
Drinking from my woe, and leave thy soul defiled
Pikes of iron molten in starfire rain,
Curse of the godless, kaoz blackness supreme

The outermost abyss, the horror of emptiness,
Citywalls ground down to debris,
Flying triangle of flame, ruin, and madness,
Destruction, formless creating all forms
Mighty Lord, Archon Ialdebaoth Samiel
Unholy dragon, demon of blindness awake
Bring forth destrucktion ultimate,
Principle manifest, watchers awake

Equinox calling, vision and voice,
Sacred warning, lightning and flash
Behold! the supernal macrocosmic realm
and all the plagues governed by him
He that soweth hatred and violence,
Serpent one risen out of the sea
Upon his heads the name of blasphemy

"But Whosoever Believeth In Him Should Not Perish, But Have The Everlasting Life"...

Now is come strength now is come honour
Multitude of thine fires brightness
Kosmik sacrifice of uncreation absolute,
Instruments of righteousness delightfull
Distress among our foes eternall anguish,
Tyrant reign upon the throne of mastershil
So powerfull, unholy perfecktion...
Daemonarch trinity, infernall destroyer
Deathsoul coldwizzard awe and pain
Looks like knifeblows,
Eternall regency granted no morrow,
We shall die in hate and trance of koronation
Invoke the drunken lusts in shrines
Of winged sepulchral horror
Twisted minds and vicious ways
Of priests unpure, a godless sin
Archaic sacrifice by blood
Thy forces wrathful summoned
Stellar abomination's curse
Leaving the zonei tron and slain
