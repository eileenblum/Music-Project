The birth of legend so long ago
Now holds the truth for those of us who know

He spread his wings, to face his god

Now as the sunlight is burning my face
Throwing my mind out of time, out of place
Traitor to the human race
I have to try
The ghost of Icarus behind my eyes

The freezing end so close at hand
We have one shot for the future of man

We spread our wings, to face our god

Now as the sunlight is burning my face
Throwing my mind out of time, out of place
Traitor to the human race
I have to try
The ghost of Icarus behind my eyes

I spread my wings, to face my god

Now as the sunlight is burning my face
Throwing my mind out of time, out of place
Traitor to the human race
I had to try
The ghost of Icarus behind my eyes
