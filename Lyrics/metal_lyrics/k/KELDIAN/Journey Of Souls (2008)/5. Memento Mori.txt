Awoke to the sound of the dripping of water
The wailing of shells far away
I sat up and listened, I rose and got ready
To greet the last day of my life

Far away, I can hear your prayer
And I know it means goodbye
Far away, nothing I can say
On the last day of my life

All of the day, all the waiting
It drives me insane
Don't want to go, don't want to stay
To find my fate
Stuttering guns drawing ever nearer
Faster the pounding of my heart in fear

Far away, I can hear your prayer
And I know it means goodbye
Far away, nothing I can say
On the last day of my life

Standing in line, side by side
All awaiting our doom
The whistle blows
Now the trenches will soon become tombs
No more than men, we are not immortal
No more than them, on the field we are equal

Far away, I can hear your prayer
And I know it means goodbye
Far away, nothing I can say
On the last day of my life

Far away, I can hear your prayer
And I know it means goodbye
Stay with me, safe as i can be
On the last day of my life

Then there is nothing but the sound of silence
It feels like I'm falling asleep
I know you can't hear me
But you will remember
This was the last day of my life
