Out of the ashes, risen once again
The last of the fallen, will not die in vain
Invincible armies, made from steel and hate
Escape on the wings of fate

The storm is here
We will show no fear
We will lead the way
Across the last frontier

Hunting a legend, flee from star to star
Relentless raiders strike out from afar
Resurrecting nemesis behold
Prophecy will unfold

The storm is here
We will show no fear
We will lead the way
Across the last frontier

For the lost we have to find
For all we left behind
For all of mankind
For the hope that sleeps within
For all that could have been
For the last of our kin

The storm is here
We will show no fear
We will lead the way
Across the last frontier
