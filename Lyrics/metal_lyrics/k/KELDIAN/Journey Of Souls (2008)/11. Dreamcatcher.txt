Deep in the night
Restless, I feel my mind wander
Caught in the light
Drifting to find what's beyond here

I'm feeling scared
Something is whispering to me
Something out there
Lost in a world that I can't see

All my life I've been crossing borders
Transcending time and again
In my dreams I can see the future
A journey of souls to the end

It opens up
A window to something that I believe
It rushes in
Emotion, the knowledge, the certainty

All my life I've been crossing borders
Transcending time and again
In my dreams I can see the future
A journey of souls to the end

All my life I've been running away
Hiding from hurt and from pain
In my dreams I can shape the future
A journey of souls to the end
