We master the elements
Our breath is the winter wind
We harness the seven seas
We're keepers of the mariner's dreams

To the north
In the land beneath the darkened sky
We are gods of the winter
And a speck of light
Ever night
In cathedrals woman, man and child
Speak our name
We are lords of polaris

Bleak gale, midwinter's storm
Our duty keeps us warm
We serve the frozen sun
Unmoving, eternal one

To the north
In the land beneath the darkened sky
We are gods of the winter
And a speck of light
Ever night
In cathedrals woman, man and child
Speak our name
We are lords of polaris

Under domes of ice, frozen city lights
This is our dominion
Rivers here don't flow, every change is slow
In the land of polaris

To the north
In the land beneath the darkened sky
We are gods of the winter
And a speck of light
Ever night
In cathedrals woman, man and child
Speak our name
We are lords of polaris
