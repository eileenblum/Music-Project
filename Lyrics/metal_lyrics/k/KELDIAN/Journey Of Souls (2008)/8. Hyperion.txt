I saw him in a dream so real
I heard my future calling me

From ash to ash
Come the fall of all we know
From dust to dust
As we watch the heavens glow

We all serve the lord of pain
Now the world will change again
In atonement we will be
To the end of history

From far away, across the stars
I heard the spirits calling me

From fall to rise
The shaping of another world
Shadow to light
As we watch the heavens burn

We all serve the lord of pain
Now the world will change again
In atonement we will be
To the end of history

On hyperion we find
Final fate of human kind
And when all we know is gone
May our lord help us move on
