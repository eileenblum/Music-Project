To the land beyond the sea
On a journey under stars, you follow me
So behold your deepest dream
Land beyond the sea, and life eternally

To be first of men
To be pioneers
No more words without meaning
To be setting sail
For the open seas
Ever hoping and dreaming

Land beyond the sea
Life eternally
It's our destiny
Immortality

To discover worlds
To be lords of lands
On the far side of oceans
To be among gods
For eternity
To inspire generations

To the land beyond the sea
On a journey under stars, you follow me
So behold your deepest dream
Land beyond the sea, and life eternally
