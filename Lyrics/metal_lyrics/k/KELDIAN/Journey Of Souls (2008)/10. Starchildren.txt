Life, arise
Exceed existence with burning eyes
Believe, break free
Illusions of boundaries and mortality
Into eternity

You are not alone, you are not alone

Forever in this life, we sail the sea of stars
We ride the winds of light, across the cosmic night

My mind, blazing bright
Eternal life in frozen lattices of light
I feel, I see
Order in chaos and destiny
Into eternity

You are not alone, you are not alone

Forever in this life, we sail the sea of stars
We ride the winds of light, across the cosmic night

Firstborn, first free
Freed from matter, beyond all life
Into eternity

You are not alone...you are not alone

Forever in this life, we sail the sea of stars
We ride the winds of light, across the cosmic night
