I don't like the way you smile
I don't like to say goodbye
I don't like the words you say to me
I don't like the way you cry
I don't like the way you talk to me
I would like to be alone

Fallen angels, I have kept my word
And yet here you stand among the damned
Keep your promise and obey my command
We won't wash this blood off from your hands

Would you like to play a game?
Do you think that I'm insane?
It's a question of mortality
I will never be the same
Oh my god, they are still hurting me
In my darkness all alone

Fallen angels, I have kept my word
And yet here you stand among the damned
Keep your promise and obey my command
We won't wash this blood off from your hands

You put the devil in me
You put the devil in me

Fallen angels, I have kept my word
And yet here you stand among the damned
Keep your promise and obey my command
We won't wash this blood off from your hands
