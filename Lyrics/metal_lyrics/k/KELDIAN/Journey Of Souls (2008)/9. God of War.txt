God of war, god of war
God of war, god of war

Beneath a veil of red
An entire world is lying dead
It's buried deep below
Man must never know
Man must never wake the sleeping god again

Beneath the sands of mars
Fell to rest at last, lost among the stars
The dark spiritual curse
Death of the universe
What once was must never come to life again

God of war, god of war
God of war, god of war

God of war, god of war
God of war, god of war

The secret must remain
I will seal the tomb and endure the pain
So I have lived in vain
All my children slain
May I never see the light of day again
