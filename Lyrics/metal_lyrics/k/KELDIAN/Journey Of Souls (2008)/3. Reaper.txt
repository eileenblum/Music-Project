I can hear your voice, echo from afar
Every word you sing, treasured in my heart
And at night when you go to rest
The chill in the air is me
I'm here

Here for you

Now I lay you down to sleep
Pray that i your soul will keep
Don't be afraid, only death divides us

It has been so long, watching from afar
Every day alone, you know it breaks my heart
So this night will be your last
Your last alone
The ghost on the wind is me
I'm here

Here for you

Now I lay you down to sleep
Pray that i your soul will keep
Don't be afraid, only death divides us

You will die before you wake
Pray that I your soul will take
Don't be afraid, only death unites us
