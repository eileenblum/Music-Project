There's a voice inside me
A distant memory
I know I've lived before

The elder world has fallen
To an age of wars
The tide has turned again

By the mercy of our sins we live our lives
In a world made of dreams
Open your eyes
Release your astral ties
And you will transcend
Beyond the stars

I can hear the suffering
The hate inside
And it pulls me to the ground

Bleeding hands are trembling
Can you forgive?
Is there courage to believe?

By the mercy of our sins we live our lives
In a world made of dreams
Open your eyes
Release your astral ties
And you will transcend
Beyond the stars
