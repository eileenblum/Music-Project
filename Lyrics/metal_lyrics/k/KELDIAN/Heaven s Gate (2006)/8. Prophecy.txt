Glowing embers of our past
Memories are fading fast
Where you came from, where you go
I can never let you know

Shadows on the castle walls
All stories that I know
Mysteries of ancient times
Are flowing in your blood

Such things I could not believe
Words and stories, disbelief
In the light from a new sun
I have sworn to tell no one

Shadows on the castle walls
All stories that I know
Mysteries of ancient times
Are flowing in your blood

I live on in you forever
Prophecy comes true
Secrets lie so deep
And are forever yours to keep
