Let it go, give up the starlanes
It's the final frontier
We have come, out of the embers
We have come to conquer

Another chance, a new beginning
No turning back now
Who we are, yet undecided
Time to create now

Set our hearts alight
For the stars we fly
One of us will be the saviour
And our souls will fly
Hope will never die
In the heart of this crusader

We are lost, the unforgiven
Brought our world to ruin
Crucified, still without penance
A universe of martyrs

Day by day, memories fading
Of what used to be
In our dreams it is still living
And we fight for the memory

Set our hearts alight
For the stars we fly
One of us will be the saviour
And our souls will fly
Hope will never die
In the heart of this crusader
