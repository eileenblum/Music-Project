Ten million tons of steel hurled across the sky
Our final sleeper ship, none left to say goodbye
For all our wisdom couldn't save her from the night
Now hear our children sing their requiem for the light

I want to stop the wheels of time
I want it, I need it
The light that gives me life again

Ten thousand years in space, we slept across the dark
Towards a burning star, we sailed a gliding arc
But soon we had to journey back into the night
And hear our children sing their requiem for the light

I want to stop the wheels of time
I want it, I need it
The light that gives me life again

Can you feel her burning love?
Mother of all life, blazing glory from above

A requiem for the light

Far too old and far too young
Behold another fading sun
Gaze with hope into the sky
But know that all our stars will die
The eternal night we must survive

A requiem for the light

I want to stop the wheels of time
I want it, I need it
The light that gives me life again
