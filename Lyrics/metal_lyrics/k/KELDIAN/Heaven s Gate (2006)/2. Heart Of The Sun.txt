Since the womb I grew too fast
Days of childhood would not last
And I shed my tears in vain

Solve the mystery, hope of man
I don't want to but I can
And I shed my tears in vain

In the sea of photons
I'll be waiting till eternity finds me
Alone in the heart of the sun
For forever more
I'll be your guide, I'll be your shepherd
But I'm lost in the dying heart of the sun

I am far away from home
For eternity alone
And I shed my tears in vain

Mind was young but body died
Among particles I lie
Out of tears to shed in vain

In the sea of photons
I'll be waiting till eternity finds me
Alone in the heart of the sun
For forever more
I'll be your guide, I'll be your shepherd
But I'm lost in the dying heart of the sun

All you ever wanted to
Was make my life mean more to you
I'm alive but I'm alone
