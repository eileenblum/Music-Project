I'm sleeping in darkness
I feel my mind shutting down
A distance you can't fathom
Oceans of time and more

I ran off at random
To save all that we know
So I risked all and I lost all
But I found even more

All alone I hear your voice
Inside my head so strong

In the cold embrace
In the deep of space
Far across the plains of forever
There is no way home
I will die alone
I will slowly fall to forever

My memories in the thousands
Now so little filters through
But you'll follow, this I know
This future waits for you

All alone I hear your voice
Inside my head so strong

In the cold embrace
In the deep of space
Far across the plains of forever
There is no way home
I will die alone
I will slowly fall to forever
And I feel you still
As my body chills
In eternal dreams I will hold you
In a close embrace
In the deep of space
Far across the plains of forever
