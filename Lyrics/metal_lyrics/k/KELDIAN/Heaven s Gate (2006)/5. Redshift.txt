So we're leaving you behind
Footprints on your shores
Washed away forever more
Looking at you one last time
As the wheel of heaven turns
We are never to return

I see it in your eyes
As the sky draws your gaze
Did you get to say goodbye?
Did you see her sad face?

Now we're leaving her behind
Nothing stays the same
Never to touch this ground again

I see it in your eyes
As the sky draws your gaze
Did you get to say goodbye?
Did you see her sad face?

The planet below will soon
Disappear into space
And now when you close your eyes
You will see us falling away
