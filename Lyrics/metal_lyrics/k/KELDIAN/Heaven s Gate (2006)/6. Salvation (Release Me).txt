Out of the dark sky
The brightest light I've ever known
You're descending
A revelation to be shown
And I know you
I feel that I've met you before
On the borders
Between this land and ever more

How can it be?
I feel your thoughts inside my head
Can you save me?
Or are you leaving me for dead?

What do you want?
Coming to take my life away
To release me
You're in control
I couldn't fight the will to stay
So release me

Into the dark sky
The blackest void is in my mind
We're ascending
Leaving all I know behind
And I'm sure now
I know that I've met you before
And I take your hand
This time will be forever more

And I let it go
And I let it go away
