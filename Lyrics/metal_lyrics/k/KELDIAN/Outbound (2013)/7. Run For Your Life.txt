The sound of shackles in the night
The flash of a blade, so cold and bright
The sound of steel smashed, gates open wide
I felt so strong when I heard them screaming outside

Run for your life
Run for your life

Hopes and dreams race through my head
Even though I know I'm dead
Like the wind through the jungle, on bleeding feet
I'll never stop, freedom tastes so sweet

Run for your life
Run for your life

Ice comes running through my veins
I can hear them shouting as I run across the plains
Out of the fire, into the unknown
On the road out of Hell, you are on your own

Run for your life, Run for your life
Run for your life, Run for your life

Run for your life, you run, run for your life

Run for your life, you run, run for your life
Run for your life, you run, run for your life
Run for your life, you run, run for your life
Run for your life, you run, run for your life

Run for your life
