A single thought, slowly taking hold
Until all you know is the calling from afar
A single dream, slowly coming true, passed on from me to you
The path between the stars
A single quest, with no turning back
To risk the wayward track and never coming home
A single truth, the only thing I seek
The secrets that they keep, the Silfen and their paths

I wish I was a child, the keeper of the light
Journey into endless nights to find the Silfen Paths
'Cause I still have a dream, to see the things unseen
Journey bravely into light to walk the Silfen Paths between the worlds
And here I am, and I realize

I'm alone - I wasn't ready yet
I'm alone - Is there no other way?
I'm alone - I can't stop wondering
I'm alone - Why don't you answer me?

Into the foggy night, the temperature's not right
Drifting, straying, no way back - We found the Silfen Paths
This land of snow and ice, crossing the Rubicon comes to mind
See the beacon shines a light - We walk the Silfen Paths between the worlds
And here I am, and I realize

I'm alone - I wasn't ready yet
I'm alone - Is there no other way?
I'm alone - I can't stop wondering
I'm alone - Why don't you answer me?

'm alone - I wasn't ready yet
I'm alone - Is there no other way?
I'm alone - I can't stop wondering
I'm alone - Why don't you answer me?

We head into the night, Orion by my side
What we're seeking, came to find, these hidden Silfen Paths
I feel your dying world, I hear and see the past unfurl
I sense the secrets of our fate, I feel the Silfen Paths connect all worlds
And here we are now, and we realize

We're alone - And we are ready now
Far from home - We'll find a way somehow
We're alone - And we are powerful
Now we know - We sense the way to go
We are one - And we are ready now
We are one - We'll find a way somehow
We are one - And we are powerful
Now we know - We sense the way to go

A single bridge, connecting all our minds
Leave time and space behind and walk with me a while
A single song - Heard across the stars and felt in every heart
The Silfen Paths we tread
A single hope
