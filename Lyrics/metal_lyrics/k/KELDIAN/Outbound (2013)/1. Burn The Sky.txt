Preemptive, conclusive - Master of Heaven and Earth
Extensive, exclusive - There's no escaping my reach

I'll prosper, I'll conquer - All of your heroes are dead
It's my time, it's high time - To be outbound, to rule the world

Heavens fall when we burn the sky - We are heading out, you're the sacrifice
End the space race and burn the sky - And you will never make it out of here alive

Abundant, redundant - All I can think of will be
Eternal, betrayal - All of our worlds will belong to me

Heavens fall when we burn the sky - We are heading out, you're the sacrifice
End the space race and burn the sky - And you will never make it out of here alive

I have, you have not
I have, you have not
I have, you have not
I have, you have not

I have, you have not
I have, you have not
I have, you have not
I have, you have not

"We need to maintain nuclear strategic superiority...
Fight and win multiple, simultaneous wars ... control cyberspace...
Create space forces with the mission of space control."
- Project for the New American Century, 2000

Heavens fall when we burn the sky - We are heading out, you're the sacrifice
End the space race and burn the sky - And you will never make it out of here alive
