I don't need a human race, no promise of co-existence
I don't need a sense of blame, no concept of conscience or of shame

I don't need humanity, nobody else to worship me
I just want the universe, I want all the systems to myself
And no one is gonna stand in my way

I am Morning Light Mountain - Now the boundary's broken
I am Morning Light Mountain

I am everything, everything there is I am - I am everything, everything there is

I don't need morality, there is no peace for you and me
Your interference is heaven sent, no shackles on progress and ascent

I was trapped inside the sphere, millennia were passing me
Now I'm out, I'm here for you, I'm gonna be all life by myself
And no one is gonna stand in my way

I am Morning Light Mountain - Now the boundary's broken
I am Morning Light Mountain

I am everything, everything there is I am - I am everything, everything there is

I am Morning Light Mountain. Resistance is futile.
Annihilation inevitable.  

I am Morning Light Mountain - Now the boundary's broken
I am Morning Light Mountain

I am everything, everything there is I am - I am everything, everything there is

I am Morning Light Mountain - I am one with my children
I am everything out there - Now the boundary's broken
I am Morning Light Mountain
