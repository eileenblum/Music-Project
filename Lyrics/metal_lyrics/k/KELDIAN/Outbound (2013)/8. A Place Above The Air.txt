The father captain's going down
His treachery has been profound
The bastard let the one who teaches get away
In the skies of T'ien Shan
We will lance him to the ground
He will never be a treat to us again
Let the heavens roar!

Thunder from above - Millions of lights that draw your stare
Evidence of war - Hanging in a place above the air
Shining like a star

We cannot let the virus spread
And let our faith be left for dead
This is a question of the future of the church
On the mountains in the clouds
She is hiding from our shroud
We must extinguish every fire that she burns
Let the heavens roar!

Thunder from above - Millions of lights that draw your stare
Evidence of war - Hanging in a place above the air
Shining like a star - Running into fire everywhere
We know who they are - Dying in a place above the air

Thunder from above - Millions of lights that draw your stare
Evidence of war - Hanging in a place above the air
Shining like a star - Running into fire everywhere
We know who they are - Dying in a place above the air

Thunder from above - Millions of lights that draw your stare
Evidence of war - Hanging in a place above the air
Shining like a star - Running into fire everywhere
We know who they are - Dying in a place above the air
