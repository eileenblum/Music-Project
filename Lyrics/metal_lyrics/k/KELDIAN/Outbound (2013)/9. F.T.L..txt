As the engines start to spin - Childhood dreams from deep within
Believe this day is finally mine - writing history this time
This is the captain, all is go - Let's do this right and take it slow
My mind is so clear - Stand fast show no fear - Engage!

Jump sequence starts and the bow begins to turn
Fighters in formation see us off beyond the stern
How I miss the soft rains of home on my face
We shall return, heroes from outer space

Singularity stand by, our distance to Earth is safe
Time to fly, hear how she roars goodbye

(BOOOM!)

Heavier than a star, no place is too far
Not even space and time can touch this ship of mine
Heavier than a star, no place is too far
Not even space and time can touch this ship of mine
True pioneers leave everything behind

Split second darkness and the blaze of a foreign sun
An eerie silence, the second countdown has begun
Mesmerized we gaze into the dawn of another age
Our kind will spread across the stars
Explore, colonize, engage

Singularity stand by - Trillions of miles from Earth
Let her fly, hear how she roars goodbye

(BOOOM!)

Heavier than a star, no place is to far
No even space and time can touch this ship of mine
Heavier than a star, no place is to far
No even space and time can touch this ship of mine
True pioneers leave everything behind

"For the eyes of the world now look into space, and to the planets beyond
We have vowed
That we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest
But by a banner of freed and peace
We have vowed
That we shall not see space with weapons of mass destruction
But with instruments of knowledge and understanding
Man, in his quest for progress, is determined and cannot be deterred
The exploration of space will go ahead." - President John F. Kennedy, 1962

Heavier than a star, no place is too far
Not even space and time can touch this ship of mine
Heavier than a star, no place is too far
Not even space and time can touch this ship of mine
True pioneers leave everything behind

We are heading out - out of here alive...
We are heading out - out of here alive...
We are heading out - out of here alive...
We are heading out - out of here alive...

(BOOOM!)
