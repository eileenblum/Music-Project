Our mortal feet safe on the ground - We leave it up to you
Our dizzy heads are in the stars
And you're the ancient dream come true

Scanning the surface, looking for shadows, what do you see?

Searching the souls of 100,000 stars, the atlas of the gods, the time has come
Reaching out to 100,000 stars, the time has come for Kepler and 100,000 stars

One tiny drop in darkness calls - Across the distant face
A tiny hope for kinship grows
That we are not the only race

Until you find them, we will be waiting, we will believe

Searching the souls of 100,000 stars, the atlas of the gods, the time has come
Reaching out to 100,000 stars, the time has come for Kepler and 100,000 stars

You're all alone now, you can't go home now, light-years away
We will remember, never surrender, we carry on

Searching the souls of 100,000 stars, the atlas of the gods, the time has come
Reaching out to 100,000 stars, the end has come for Kepler and 100,000 stars
