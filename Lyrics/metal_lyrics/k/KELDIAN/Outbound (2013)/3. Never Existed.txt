I don't wanna be a hero anymore

"A man is but the product of his own thoughts.
What he thinks, he becomes." - Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi

I'm gonna go to sleep and wake up, far away, as someone else
And all of this, and my whole life, just a terrible dream
But it's still my eyes staring back, in the mirror, cold and black
Is this for real? Tell me now! Am I the fear in your hearts?

This cannot be happening to me
It's all wrong, just a dream. What have I done?
No hope, no way out of this
Please just let me die now. I don't want this fate
I don't want to be a hero anymore
Can't breathe, can't do it, just let me fall
We're all lost. Fighting enemies that don't exist
And they turned us into this

I'm gonna take it all back, I'm gonna tear up this track
And all this pain and hate within will never have been
But the fear keeps coming back, in my mind so cold and black
Is this the end of us all? I'm the fear in your hearts

This cannot be happening to me
It's all wrong, just a dream. What have I done?
No hope, no way out of this
Please just let me die now. I don't want this fate
I don't want to be a hero anymore
Can't breathe, can't do it, just let me fall
We're all lost. Fighting enemies that don't exist
And they turned us into this

I'm gonna go to sleep and wake up, far away, as someone else
And all of this, and my whole life
Was just a terrible dream
Murderer, endless wrath, belligerence, unforgivable sins
Live in fear, live the lies
Can we never forgive or forget

This cannot be happening to me
It's all wrong, just a dream. What have I done?
No hope, no way out of this
Please just let me die now. I don't want this fate
I don't want to be a hero anymore
Can't breathe, can't do it, just let me fall
We're all lost. Fighting enemies that don't exist
And they turned us into this

This cannot be happening to me
It's all wrong, just a dream. What have I done?
No hope, no way out of this
Please just let me die now. I don't want this fate
I don't want to be a hero anymore
Can't breathe, can't do it, just let me fall
We're all lost. Fighting enemies that don't exist
And they turned us into this
