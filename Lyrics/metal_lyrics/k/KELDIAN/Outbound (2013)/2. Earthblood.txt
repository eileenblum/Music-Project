So much time has been wasted
Too many years have passed us by
From the moon we went nowhere
We mourn the past
Wen our souls forgot to fly

Blood of the earth, draining to Heaven - Counting the stars only we can see
Blood of the earth, rivers are running - What will become our destiny?

We don't know what is out there
The constellations drifting by
When closing in on a new world
We mourn the past
When our eyes forgot the sky

Blood of the earth, draining to Heaven - Counting the stars only we can see
Blood of the earth, rivers are running - What will become our destiny?

We're the blood of the earth, we're coming home again
We're the blood of the earth, we're gonna live again

We're the blood of the earth, we're coming home again
We're the blood of the earth, we're gonna live again

Blood of the earth, draining to Heaven - Counting the stars only we can see
Blood of the earth, rivers are running - What will become our destiny?

Blood of the earth, draining to Heaven - Counting the stars only we can see
Blood of the earth, rivers are running - What will become our destiny?
