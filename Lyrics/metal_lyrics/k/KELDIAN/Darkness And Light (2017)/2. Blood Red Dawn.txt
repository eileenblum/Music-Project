We'll keep you yearning in darkness
With dreams all so petty and small
We'll keep you fighting our giants
Until you are nothing at all

You'll keep on dying in our wars
'Cause blood can turn dust into gold
You'll be defending our power
Until the earth is all drained, dead and cold

Snakes of the earth
I know that you are out there hiding
Snakes of the earth
I know that you have played us all for fools
Snakes of the earth
I know that you are out there hiding
Snakes of the earth
Awake the sleepers to a blood-red dawn
Snakes of the earth

Empowered puppets in control
The governing stage has been set
As history plays out by our rules
Generations dismiss and forget

'Cause we have been here for a long time
We've mastered deception and fear
A kingdom with no flag or borders
With daggers and fangs everywhere

Snakes of the earth
I know that you are out there hiding
Snakes of the earth
I know that you have played us all for fools
Snakes of the earth
Your day of reckoning is coming
Snakes of the earth
Awake the sleepers to a blood-red dawn
Snakes of the earth

So you'll keep on craving the circus
Until all your knowledge is lost
Disabled by poisonous comforts
A slave to the grind at any cost

One by one we'll lay siege to all freedoms
And finally to liberty's walls
You'll shed no tears when they crumble
No, you'll be demanding they fall

Snakes of the earth
Your day of reckoning is coming
Snakes of the earth
Awake the sleepers to a blood-red dawn
Snakes of the earth
And we will tell our children of your deeds
Snakes of the earth
Your kind will never slither earth again
Snakes of the earth

We know that you are out there hiding
We know that you have played us all for fools
Your day of reckoning is coming
Awake the sleepers to a blood-red dawn
Snakes of the earth
