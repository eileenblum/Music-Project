To the Exodus cluster, code red, no response to our hail
The Geth have landed on Eden, machines from the Perseus Veil

You brought war to our colonies, now war comes for you

We are the saviors, watch us falling from the sky
On wings of thunder, we come to fight by your side
To a symphony of blazing guns
Life and death under strange new suns
We have come from afar, just tell us where they are

The Collectors attack, seeker swarms cover the sky
Through the Omega 4 relay to uncharted space, stand by

You brought war to our worlds, now war comes to you

We are avengers, watch us falling from the sky
On wings of thunder, for those who died by our side
To a symphony of blazing guns
Life and death under strange new suns
We have come from afar, just tell us where they are

The cycle continues and reapers emerge from the void
Every 50.000 years they return to see life destroyed

You brought war to our galaxy, now war comes for you

We are the saviors, watch us falling from the sky
On wings of thunder, we come to fight by your side
To a symphony of blazing guns
Life and death under strange new suns
We have come from afar, just tell us where they are

We are avengers, watch us falling from the sky
On wings of thunder, for those who died by our side
To a symphony of blazing guns
Life and death under strange new suns
We have come from afar, just tell us where they are
