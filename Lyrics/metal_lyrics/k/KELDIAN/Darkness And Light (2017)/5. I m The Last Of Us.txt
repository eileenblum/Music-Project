Rest, our time is over now
I lay you down, you sleep forever now
It's been so long, the past is in the ground
Reclaimed and overgrown, just a few more footsteps in the sand

No more cities in the sky
No golden ships to cross the veil beyond the clouds
I scream, but there's no sound

There will be no redemption here
No absolution from this

I'm carving letters, rusted metal into stone
One perfect moment in time, before it's all gone
For the last of us
I'm the last of us

Fly, you are a memory now
This was our dream
A place of light amidst the dark
We, were made of greatness once
Seeded new life and reined the power in our stars

No more keepers in your skies
No golden ships to kindle dreams beyond the clouds
I scream, but we're all alone now

There will be no redemption here
No absolution from this

I'm carving letters, rusted metal into stone
One perfect moment in time, before it's all gone
For the last of us
I'm the last of us

No one remembers our name
But we were here
And we died in vain

No one will remember us
No one will know our name
A glorious empire lost in time
Gone, like tears in rain
