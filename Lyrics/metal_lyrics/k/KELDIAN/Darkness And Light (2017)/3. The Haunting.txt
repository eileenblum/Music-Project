Do you come from the sky?
Do you fly on a silver wing?
I will be paralyzed
You will harvest my body and my mind

Do you rise from the grave?
Have you come from the underworld?
You want me for a slave
I will be just a living dead in chains

Tonight comes the haunting
The night will be frightening
Tonight comes the haunting
And I will be wanting the universe to stop

Do you ride on the wind?
Are you what people call a ghost?
I will not let you in
And still you will be floating through the walls

Do you walk on the lake?
Have you come from the spirit world?
I will be yours to take
For I can't let go of my own self

Tonight comes the haunting
The night will be frightening
Tonight comes the haunting
And I will be wanting the universe to stop
