I am just a simple man, I just do what I can
I am no leader but they follow me
I give no promises nor lies

We used to share this dream
Now it is lost it would seem
Your greed for power, your precious policies
Your laws took everything from me

All channels hail
To hell with all confederation sails
There'll be no talking today
This place is our own, we're not going away

Broadside!
It is you who can't hide from our
Broadside!
She was the hammer of the stars
Broadside!
We will never stand down from our
Broadside!
Striking fear in your hearts

This is a lost man's path, one of vengeance and wrath
But there is hope for those who follow me
You may see liberty again

We came from light years away
Relentless, defiant, we stay
No silver-tongued emissary can save you now
You took everyone from me

All channels hail
To hell with all confederation sails
It is a good day to die
All weapons free, light up the sky

Broadside!
It is you who can't hide from our
Broadside!
She was the hammer of the stars
Broadside!
We will never stand down from our
Broadside!
Striking fear in your hearts
Broadside!
