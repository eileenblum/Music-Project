Darkness calls me, beckoning me
In the failing light I dread the night
Out beyond the shadow, I strain to see
To the other side, to the other me

Darkness kills the light
We fall, nightfall
You are not alone in the fight
Night falls on us all

My racing heart and my skin of ice
And my pitch black thoughts shut out the light
No time to live and no place to be
This vertigo is drowning me

Darkness kills the light
We fall, nightfall
You are not alone in the fight
Night falls on us all, night falls on us all

Darkness calls me, beckoning me
I defy the night and I conjure light
Out beyond the shadow, it's plain to see
To the other side and the other me

Darkness kills the light
We fall, nightfall
You are not alone in the fight
Night falls on us all, night falls on us all
