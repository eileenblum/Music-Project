Ancient light in the sky, billions of years are passing by
Defying comprehension, space and time

A tiny speck in the dark, perfection in a graceful arc
A little piece of who we are, shooting star

Dance away the night
Children of the moonlight
Hold your head up high
Claim the crown of starlight

No darkness that can take us down, no evil that can break us now
The light of beauty never dies, perfect spheres

Old mother sun is you and me, stardust beyond eternity
On the intergalactic sea, breaking free

Dance away the night
Children of the moonlight
Hold your head up high
Claim the crown of starlight

Future's edge, ever shine
Queen of space, king of time
