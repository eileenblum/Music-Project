Eyes on the terminal, eyes on the door
We are ghosts and shadows, decks on the floor
The patch is good, signals five by five
We are jackin' in, I will see you inside
A jolt down my spine and we're riding the light
I see the grid lines coming down in front of my eyes
The hunt is on but it holds no thrills
Being legends is easy when you got mad skills

Black I.C.E., another high-rise, this is life in Night City
And even if you're half as good, you know thieves never should
Cross their hearts and hope to die

Push me and I'll push you back
Stay with me, no system we can't crack
I feel alive and I'll always be like you
You can love me
I will love you too

And the world will change tonight
Yes, the world will change tonight
We will change the world tonight
Just two outlaws on the highways of light

Pay data secured, we are heading back out
Nodes are compromised, need to reroute
A weird surge on the grid, dammit, somethin' ain't right
Loading combat programs, we explode into light
I yank the jack from my head in a dump shock daze
Rebooting cyberware, I touch your face
Your lips ain't movin' and the patch is fried
The door is breached, nowhere to hide

Black I.C.E., another high-rise, this is life in Night City
And even if you're half as good, you know thieves never should
Cross their hearts and hope to die

Push me and I'll push you back
Run with me, no system we can't crack
I am alive but I'm no longer like you
Can you love me?
I will love you too

And the world will change tonight
Yes, the world will change tonight
We will change the world tonight
Just two outlaws on the highways of light

Beautiful colors, rolling waves on laser rays
Bullets and blades flying through the crimson haze
Sparks, dust and neon lights, all dancing with the dead
Chaos slows to silence as the stims reach your head

Shadows in code on every screen
I know that style, you are still in
Electric angel wings and burning chrome
She whispers
Run
Run

And the world will change tonight
Yes, the world will change tonight
We will change the world tonight
Just two outlaws on the highways of light
