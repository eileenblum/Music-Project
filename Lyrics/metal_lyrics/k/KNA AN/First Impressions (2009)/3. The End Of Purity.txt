Temptation...

As leaves fall on a perfect autumn,
Sorrow takes part in us
As summer springs a perfect blossom
Shadowed by mistrust

We face ourselves
A picture broken
And to the end -
We are dust

Betrayal comes through serpent's eyes
Shattering old lies
Consuming autumn beauty
Bringing winter's sighs

An encrypted waterfall
We no longer understand
Ignorance knows nothing
While wisdom cries

Cold and unsafe
We reach for our own mind
The heart is now forgotten
Long lost it was blind

Father teaches us all
Yet we know none
Suddenly all vivid
And our purity is gone

Regrets we have few
Not for show - but for pondering
To seek within our souls
What our thoughts are now binding

An encrypted waterfall
We no longer understand
Ignorance knows nothing
While wisdom cries

Exiled for unveiling
The misty clouds of god
Temptation - are we different?
For truth runs in our blood

Is this the end of choices?
A divine end - I must say
Fools remain in heaven
While as humans we must pay
