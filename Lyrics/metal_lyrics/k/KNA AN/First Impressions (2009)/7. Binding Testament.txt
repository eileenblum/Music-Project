[Abraham:]
"I've climbed the highest mountain
I've traveled across this land
All my deeds by god's command

After all we said
After all I've done
Has it come to this
Killing my own son?!

To build this altar of bones
Build this altar of blood
All in greater cause
All in greater sacrifice"

[The altar boys:]
"Devoted acts of madness
Crazed acts of belief
Who is this god to say
This boy is to be killed?"

[Isaac:]
"My life
Given to god
My death
Could it be all wrong?"

[Abraham (to the altar boys):]
"On this path we must carry on alone.

Am I to slay
My only son
Can I really be
The chosen one?

Endless sorrow
Immortal grief
My heart now shattered
As I give you this gift"

[God:]
"Don't send your hand at the boy!

For now I know
You are the one
Now you must spare
Your only son

For many you'll have
Like the sand of the sea
This testament now sealed
Between you and me"

[Abraham:]
"After all is said
After all is done
It has come to this
Keeping my only son"
