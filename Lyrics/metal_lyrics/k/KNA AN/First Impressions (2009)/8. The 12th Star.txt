[Joseph:]
"Gather round, my brothers
Gather close to me
For I have dreamt last night
And in my dream I see:

11 stars surround me
Alongside sun and moon
I stand there in the midst
Your bowing will come soon"

[Judas:]
"The dreamer crossed the line
His fatal sin of pride
All sins have consequences
For his arrogance he'll die"

[Reuben:]
"Have we turned to demons
So anxious for the kill
Although he had enraged us
Our brother he is still"

[Storyteller:]
"In Goshen land
Where dreams prevail
Derived by hunger
They meet again

So they see their brother's face
They can't recall their own disgrace
But he recalls, the dreamer sees
To repay with their own deeds

In bursting years of sorrow
His anger overrides
Blaming them with theft
Deceiving them with lies
Imprisoning his brother
The youngest of them all
In a twisted quest of vengeance
His morality now falls

Through endless years of sorrow
They took away his son
As he awaits for darkness
The hope is almost gone

The presence now embracing
All that once was pure
As he reveals his secret
11 stars obscured

You cannot hide from sins
The cycle always turns
He who plays with fire
Forever shall be burned

You can't escape from demons
Reaching from the past
What you take for granted
Pursues you to your last

Although the bond's forsaken
The ties forever last"
