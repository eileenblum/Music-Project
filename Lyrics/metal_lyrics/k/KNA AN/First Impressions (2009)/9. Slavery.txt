[Hebrews:]
"Slaves we are
Slaves to Pharaoh
We can't see
Nothing but sorrow"

[Pharaoh:]
"All men born to the Nile will be thrown
Though females will keep living on"

[Storyteller:]
"We were meant to serve with rigor
Mortar and bricks made us bitter
In Egypt, slavery
Pain, 400 years"

[Moses:]
"Pharaoh let my people go
Or thou shalt suffer so
Ten strikes upon your soul
Until the last Egyptian falls

Pharaoh let my people go
Or thou shalt suffer so
First blood upon the Nile
(And) last your first born one shall die

Let loose thy chains of wrath
Upon this foul land
This is my command

My people in pain
My efforts in vain
I yearn for your aid
Show me the way"

[Storyteller:]
"And so god strengthens the heart of the king
For him to feel the pain within
We were made to serve with rigor
Building the pyramids we feel so shuddered
In Egypt, slavery
No rebellion, 400 years"

[Moses:]
"Pharaoh let my people go
Or thou shalt suffer so
Ten strikes upon your soul
Until the last Egyptian falls

Pharaoh let my people go
Or thou shalt suffer so
First blood upon the Nile
(And) last your first born one shall die"

[Storyteller:]
"(And so) the angel of death
Is passing over
Hebrew's houses
Killing the first born sons
To set the nation free..."
