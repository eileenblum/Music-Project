[Cain:]
"I gaze at this pool of blood on the ground
I sought completion but emptiness I found
As the sunset ends my longest day
Flesh and blood I have slayed, myself I betrayed

His spirit blows with the wind and the stroke of my hand
And finally, mortality I will understand
Am I to escape, to forget, to deny
To empty myself to the day I will die

Is there a punishment that will suffice?
Fulfill my need for redemption
Slowly, I raise my head to the skies
Oh father, grant me salvation

Now I rise
Scarred forever
With the mark between my eyes
I walk the nether

Can this really be the price to pay?
It's priceless to push the guilt away
It haunts me still to remember him
But it's even harder to try and forget

A death in silence is never the answer
This mark is for the lives we end

Is there a punishment that will suffice?
Fulfill my need for redemption
Slowly, I lower my head to the ground
Oh father, you didn't grant me any salvation at all"
