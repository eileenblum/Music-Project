These days are red
Can you hear the bells of the dead?
The devastation, steel, smoke and lives taken
The hell fire burns inside the faith of the forsaken
Feel the loss, the death, hysteria, chaos and
No rest for the wicked

Behind the bars of your mind you try to edify
Feelings, faith, beliefs
Now you all will see the lie
You'll see the lie

Genocide
Purifies
The divine
Sanctified
God

Genocide
Purifies
The divine
Sanctified
God

The silence embraces the fire
From my suicide desire
Am I condemned to hell
Like the one from heaven fell?
