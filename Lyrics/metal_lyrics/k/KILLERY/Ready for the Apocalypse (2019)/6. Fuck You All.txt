I am devilish
I can not rest
Life of hypocrisy
Lies are truth

Many motherfuckers
Empty-headed
Why are you better?
You need a beating

Hey, worms
Betrayers
You must fear
Fuck you all

Justice is not blind
Scale of make-believe
Two weights and two measures
Paper weighs more than lead

Look to these vipers
Money can't buy everything
Asshole deluded
Listen to my poem

You can't go out
You can't resist
No use in crying
Sucks!

Hey, worms
Betrayers
You must fear
Fuck you all

You are a shit
Look in the mirror
You have seen the nasty bugs
These are your true faces

Hey, worms
Betrayers
You must fear
Fuck you all

Your days has come
I already faced bigger monsters
I'm not afraid of ugly faces
I'm not afraid of your threats and your shouts
If you want to daunt me
Forget it
Here is a blood of war
Here is a blood of war

You'll burn in the hell of traitors
It's useless urinate in your pants
'Cause it is a fuel for rats
That act in the shadows
Your specie will be extinct of the earth
Your heads will be our trophies
You don't deceive me anymore
Unsuited thieves with branded clothes

Hey, worms
Betrayers
You must fear
Fuck you all
