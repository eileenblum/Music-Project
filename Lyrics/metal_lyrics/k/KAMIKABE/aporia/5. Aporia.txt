And finally the halls of marble dissolved around me. The blackness stung my
eyes. And my insides burned with this forbidden access. And I laugh at this
sand I hold in my hands. This, I used to think I held the key. The door was
always open. And I remain to stare at my reflection, as I am randomly switched
back and forth from either side. My insignificance becoming insignificant. And
all my pointless shouts at the universe fall back upon my skull like pelting
rain. I smash my fist into the mirror until my body is soaked in blood. And I
laugh uncontrollably at this shattered reflection. I let my hands bleed as they
finally touch the truth. All the pain and torment. The sum of humanityâs
suffering. It was worth everything I have lost. To finally understand these
beautiful roses blossoming forth from the hollow torso of humanityâs blood
drenched history. I lost my tongue with the shards that splintered into my
mind. I am not amused. Bloodlet my skull now. Acid rain on my lungs. Ending all
life now. I stand on God. Drain this world from my eyes. My insignificance has
become insignificant.
