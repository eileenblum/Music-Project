Planate perfection falsified by stark pallor, a fever from the inner workings, constructed by flaws.
Suffocating the individual slowly breaking down.
The body moves along enduring the modern day atrocities.
Shrieks of terror fill the mind, inner workings begin to erode.
The resolve of a once proud individual begins to shake the foundation.
Every sense of understanding dissipates leaving only uncertainly.
The atrophy is thriving, a nemesis that conveys unfathomable apprehension from depths that cannot be defeated.
The dread beast, the purveyor of shame.
The individual is nothing more than a misplaced memory, remembered by none.
The entity that is the dread beast remains unscathed, unconquered claiming another.
