i must repair, i must rebuild even that of which i despise for it is who suffers at its peril.
it is known that i cannot salvage the inequities of all and still i am scourged by all for failure.
my flesh becomes leather to bear whips of the indignant and frustration becomes the sepulcher where my patience is laid to rot, a shrine of depraved, unwillfully erected by my own shame.
this is empathogen that i must digest has no mercy on a mind bescorn, a painful enterprise of self-hate.
in pertpetuum i am forced to suckle the breast of mother grief lest i starve.
the torturer tortures the sufferer suffers and i am the orphan of these the bastard child of inquity.
