i stare into the abyss only to rest my eyes on the deceptive nature of mankind.
the desire for progression has only damned us with hypocrisy.
a generation consumed by devotion overlapped by absense of morality.
the populace is blinded by self manipulation, to condone its destructive nature.
the submissive are led astray stumbling down a path of self righteousness.
mastering the art of contradiction, disobeying their sacred laws.
the fanatics are devoured by gluttony, endless act of repitition.
they're the pillars of disaster, the foundation of corruption.
I know all things must come to an end.
End to the lunacy, end to the absurd desire for dominance.
In my disgust I rejoice for I am not bound, but my lack of perception leads me to question this existence.
I persist for I wish not to be deterred.
I will discover resolution on my own terms.
Not through the pandemonium driven machine, fueled by the distorted opinions of the meek.
