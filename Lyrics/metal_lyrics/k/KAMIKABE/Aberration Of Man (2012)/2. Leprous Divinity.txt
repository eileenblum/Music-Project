i am the witness to the monstrosity.
the witness to the deleterious.
lives lost in the name of ignorance.

pestilence spreads cursing the mindless with crooked tongues.
obsession and devotion intertwine stretching the individuals reality into deadlock.
the infectious pattern of monotony continues, it leeches consumes, drains, the free willed devolving them into drones.
they claim to have purpose, a path of restoration.
their diatribe is deafening.
the pestilence continues slowly plaguing the ones defiling our society.
the body that is touched by the words of god, they enter with such force only to be spewed down their lips.
the masses drink deeply absorbing the false benevolence.
they fall victim.
they become mesmorized.
the transpiring of malice begins to take form.
