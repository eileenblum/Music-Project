An ember in the back of my throat glows orange,
crackling with every breath.
The ash fills my chest
and boils the flesh around my heart.
The time of filling the cup to extinguish my despondent fury is no more.
You have punctured my temperant
and now I deliver a torrent of spirits to the smoldering wrath enlivened by your torment.
I will swell with seething rampancy,
so viscious am I my embrace will consume you with the heat of a living star.
Relentless I will destroy you.
The flames have peeled away all that was man and you will lie beneath the foot of agony.
I have chosen to die so that I may become,
and as you writhe in this wretchedness you too must choose to die so that your fat and bone may become me.
I shall claim another in everlasting flame until all the world is enveloped in ash.
The ember returns to earth where it may spawn new life worthy of existence.
