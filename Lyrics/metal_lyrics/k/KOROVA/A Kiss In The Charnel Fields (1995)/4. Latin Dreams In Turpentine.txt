Kiss my trembling Fingers
Covered with your Blood.
Sister, please forgive me,
And the Sun is shining bright.

Sweetish Stones burn on hot Floe
To evitate in Vapour State.
Pink Noises maim my talking Ears
As your Eyeballs fill my Guts.

Evaporation is changing my Aggregate State,
And gaseous I travel with the Wind.
I'm filtering the Light and many Fraunhofer-lines
Enrich the Colour Spectrum, dispersed by a Prism.
