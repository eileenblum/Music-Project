You goddamn ShadowHordes, I've watched behind your Play 
Now I know all your Games of mesmerizing Fright 
My whole Life was repressed by your false Ideas 
Models flogged into my Head - now you are unveiled 

Circus is closed, the Flocks trapped in Circles 
Crippled Puppets hang on the Wheel 
Chuckling Mechanics full of my Vomit 
Our Realm is not of this World 

Falling down through the Cyclone of Mania 
Right into the Eye of the Storm 
Lost are the Fools all around 
In the Black of the Void waits the Gold of the All 

The Carnival is over - The Clowns come to an End 
The Mirrors of my Madness crystallizing bright 
This stupid Melody of Robot Dolls and Gnomes 
Does endlessly repeat until I'll be at Home 

Fountains explode from the Mouth of the Dragon 
As Cattle Mask falls down from his Golden Face 
The Fangs of the Lion drill deep through the Flesh of the Bull 
On the Day when Korova was killed 

Slain are the Herds, for too long they have gathered 
To hinder the Flight of the Eagle so cruel 
Now overflown and destroyed are their Stables, consumed 
For it's just a Fool's World 
Such a Fool's World
