Burnbeating Heartglows in the Skull-Halls 
Pulsing FlameFalls prance through the Night 
And the Grim Old Master Stonecold 
Grasps his Raven as Clefts crack his Throne 

Within the SunStorm 

Boilbrimful Heartblows melt the SnowWalls 
And the Moon falls in flickering Fires 
Mighty Wings fold for a Soul sold 
All the Waters now tremble in Steam 

Within the SunStorm 

Shall his Claws no longer lead 
In the Snake's wise Whisper's Bite 
No hidden shall survive... 

Within the SunStorm
