Follow us to our Realms of Pleasure 
You will not want to return 
All the Pain of Veins not open 
Streams away here in our Lap 

Leave me be here in my Darkness 
Do not search to loose your Heart 
Hundreds tried, now crying forever 
All my Paths are stained with Blood 

Come, return, and rest a Moment 
Leave the peaceless Storms behind 
Tired you are from your long Journey 
Rest a While here in our Arms 

Go away, my Curse is hopeless 
See my Scars not healed by Time 
Lost are those who want me staying 
All my Tears were just Goodbyes 

Do not smell my poisoned Roses 
Do not drink my heavy Wine 
Lost are those who've kissed my Fevers 
All my Words are just Goodbyes 

Once I've touched the Queen of Undines 
Unreal Dreams she brought to me 
Just one Kiss made her immortal 
Through my Soul now unredeemed
