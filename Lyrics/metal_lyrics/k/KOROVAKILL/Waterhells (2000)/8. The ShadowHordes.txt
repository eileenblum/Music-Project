Into the Portal of ulcerous Bones 
For Relief seems to wait there so glorious 
Dreadful Wails echo from frozen Stone 
Drill through my Head in a Rush of enchanting... 

...Lives &amp; Deaths &amp; Understanding, 
Blent for evermore - 
Staring at this false Illusion's Fall 

White is the purest Beginning 
Red are the Blood &amp; the Fire 
Blue is the Greater Dimension 
Black is the enshadowed Light 
That guides the Blind! 

Enshadowed - 
The Beast of Dogs and Wolves and Scum 
In the Pit of a Thrillion Myriad Haunters 
The ShadowHordes ride on 

Enshadowed- 
The Beast of Dogs and Wolves and Scum 
The Stampede of a Trillion Myriad Horses- 
The ShadowHordes rave on 

All silent Devils awake from their Sleep 
All once Killed and the Sins deeply hidden 
Bestial Wars cleansing all that survived 
With the Scorpio the Gatekeeper's Shadows rise 

Red is their Sword of Aggression 
Red are their Stallions Eyes 
Black is their Shield of Deception 
Drunken the ShadowHordes ride
