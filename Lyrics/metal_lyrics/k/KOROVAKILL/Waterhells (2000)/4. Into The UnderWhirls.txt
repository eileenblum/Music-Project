And down I sink into the wet Womb's open Graves 
Sweet Fingers draw me to the Ground 
Follow us to the Realms of Untime 
My Lungs breathe Water and, old Hell, it tastes like Weed 
The Drop returns to the Great Sea 
You're the Well and we are the Ocean 

To cross the final Frontier 
To reach the deepest Sky 
To dive beyond the Shores of Time 

To leave beyond all Senses 
To kiss the Mermaid Tongues 
To fall &amp; swirl deep down the Whirls 
Into the UnderWhirls 

A lurid Gleam shines from the Bottom of the Sea 
Behind a Cliff appear strange Lives 
It's the Entrance to Castle SkullBrain 
The House of Horns stands there with BoneWalls full of Kills 
The Blood returns to the Red Sea 
It's the Well of our poisoned Ocean 

To seek the lost Dimension 
To drift one World away 
To die into new liquid Skins 

To find the real Origin 
To drink the Salt of Fate 
To gaze beyond eternal Gates
