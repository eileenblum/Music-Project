Below the bleeding Mermaids 
Blue thrones the Skull Palace 
Two Tower-Horns, one grinning Gate 
Into these Jaws I'm swallowed 

In pale white Halls of Marble 
Stare Faces carved in Stone 
Parades of sleeping Statues 
So still, but for how long? 

And here all Time is frozen 
And here all Pain is stunned 
These silent Walls just waiting 
For one Drop of my Blood
