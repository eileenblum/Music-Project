There's a Mirror dancing on each Water's Edge 
It reflects like a Fist, without Masks and Pride. 
Only Few dare to enter and die for a Dive, 
But just here on the Ground the Kaleidoscopes shine. 

There's a Treasure House on each Water's Ground, 
At the End of the Quest through the Shadows. 
Drink the gruesome Wine of the Waves Divine 
And the Black turns to varied Creatures. 

There is Horror found in deep Whirls unbound, 
Here at House Bizarre grimly burning, 
Where the Rooms are filled with my Past Lives killed, 
All the Figures and old Skins begone. 

Onto the other Side - All Bridges burned behind 
Beyond the last Goodbye - Into the Tunnel's Gleaming 
The Dance of Children shines - All Walls seem golden Skies 
The Fire storms inside - Lord Golden Blizzard Rise 

Lord Golden Blizzard 
Grand Sun Orb 
Electric Waterfalls 
Breathe Galactic Snow 

In dreamlike ThoughtDeserts 
A golden Flash of Light 
Rains little FireAngels, 
Hailing all the same one...
