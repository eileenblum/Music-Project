The Winds blew Cuts into my Skin 
as I woke up just drifting aimless; 
Water, Water everywhere, but not a Drop to drink. 

I swim exhausted reeling Streams, 
all Past erased, a jerking Nameless; 
Water, Water everywhere and several Miles to sink. 

Watching for Ships somewhere passing 
or Islands touching the Edge of the Sea. 
Moving to resist this Pulling, 
a downward-grooving Drown Symphony 

Water, Water everywhere... 

The Wind brought Sound of Men on Board, 
a Vessel-Sign so hopeful flickering; 
All around &amp; all around, but nowhere Ships to see. 

Waves &amp; Skies so endless Lord, 
Vessel-Noise and Voices raving. 
From deep down they call my Name 
and there I sink and sink...
