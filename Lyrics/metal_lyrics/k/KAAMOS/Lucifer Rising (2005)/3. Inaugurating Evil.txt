Threatening Constellations
Mocking In Their Radiance
Transmitting Unto Earth
Unearthly Haunting Light
Like Eves In Death
Gazing Blindly Beyond
The Veils Of Life
To Borders Of Insanity
Outside Countless Aeons
Darkness Is Transmitting
Awaiting To Awaken
From Slumber Into Reign
Resounding Incantations
Disturb Its Shallow Sleep
From Cosmic Tombs of Old
Residing In The Deep
Threshold To Iniquity
Darkness And Heresy
Acherontic Mystery
Inaugurating Evil

Ademonist
Behind The Cross
Demonifuge
Lost Its charm

Summoning
Funest Ones
Primordial
Unto Time
Ethereal
Chaos Gods
Of The Dead
Now Manifest
Tangible
Satan - Spawn
Divine In Sin
Terror Born
