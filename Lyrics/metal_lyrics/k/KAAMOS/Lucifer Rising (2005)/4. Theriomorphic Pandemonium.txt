Down there In the shadows
Abominations, Divine in Darkness
Pandaemonium, Abode of Demons
Creations Shunned, Apostate Ones

Theriomorphic
Pandaemonium

Down There In the Abyss
Beyond the Light, In the Dark
Sparks Expelled In Chasms Thrive
Unholy Essence, Cryptozoic

Theriomorphic
Pandaemonium

Down There In the Depths
Labyrinths of the Black Flame
Shrouded Secrets of Baphomet
Whispered Beyond the Gates

Theriomorphic
Pandaemonium

Crowd of Gods, Dripping Poison
On the Mouth of the Holy
Tongue of Fiends Marks the Father
Derides the Son and Holy Ghost

Theriomorphic
Pandaemonium

By Spells and Magick
Conjure ye Them
In Tongues of Olde
Enchant ye Them
By Laws that Govern
Evoke ye Them
With Signs of Evil
Greet ye Them
