Dark skies - You don't look up
Secrets - You don't ask why
The flame burns, the world turns, the waves rise
You shut your ears from the noise that comes from deep inside
Your heartbeat against your chest!
It all starts here

Silence and sound
What is the earth?
A little fire to the black sky
A little fire to your whirlwind life to
Light the minds and shut the mouths
Stand still, breathe and set
A little fire to the right books
A little fire to the wrong men
We are

Starless - What is this world?
Starless - We are the eyes, we are
Starless - What is this world?
Starless - We are blind

Rejoin, rejoin with stars
Destroy, destroy the below
Rejoin, rejoin with your heart
Embrace, embrace the inbetween

Void with a form
So pitchblack the night
The light is between the stars in us
And there are words inside as there are worlds entwined
It's you and I - We are one pulse
The rhythm of the universe
Starts beating here

We're all of them
Eyes of the earth
We're the fire to the black sky
We're the fire to your whirlwind life to
Be with beasts and water
We're whole, our hands bare
A little fire to the right books
A little fire to the wrong men
We are

Starless - What is this world?
Starless - We are the eyes, we are
Starless - What is this world?
Starless - We are blind...
