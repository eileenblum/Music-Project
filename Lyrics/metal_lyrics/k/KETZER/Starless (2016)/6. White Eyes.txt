This place is the darkest inkblot
On these pages of starfilled nights
My eyes, always open
But I'm blind, so blind

This room it is filled with you
And serpentine mistakes
My mouth is always open
The hunger, the hunger

White Eyes
Black Heart
Take a long breath
To tell tales of the stones and the wind

Outside is the dream and the fall
From the edge of the world to an ultimate end
Inside the mothers' heart
The greatest gift of them all of them all of the

Knife and the blade that cut away
Like sunbeams' light through green
Shine black the rays through white eyes
On the pathways

To the feather of the fowl
To the worm's tail
On the deer's hoof
To the sky and the earth
And the stardust in between
To the worm's tail
And the boar's teeth
That dig through truth
