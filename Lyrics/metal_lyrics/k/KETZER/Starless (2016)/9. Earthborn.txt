Earth to earth, moon to moon
Locked eyes
As the sun rises
There's a cry before the cry
Like the shot of a gun before the bullet arrives

But it arrives
Like seeds grow in soil
And there's a cry before the cry
When you know that you're alive, âcause you are

Earthborn - You are all
You are not mine but I am thine
Earthborn - You are the dark blue sea
I am of you and you're of me

Closer
Come Closer

âThou art the dark blue bird and the green parrot with red eyes.
Thou hast the lightning as thy child. Thou art the season and
the seas. Having no beginning, thou dost abide with immanence,
whereof all things are born.â
[Excerpt from the Upanishads]

A heart of salt
A crystal tongue
And eyes of gold
The tidal one
Far away, far away
But we're here and we hear

Down from the skies to your
Rivers and your hills
Calls the cry before the cry
The call of life, you are

Earthborn - You are all
You're not mine but I am thine
Earthborn - You are the dark blue sea
I am of you and you're of me
