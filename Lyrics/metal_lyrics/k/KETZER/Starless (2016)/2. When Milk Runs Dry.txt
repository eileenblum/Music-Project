Stop waiting at the window, mother
There will be no return
Just like the wind took the seeds away
You knew you'd have to cut

The blades, the bonds, the wire
The notion of yourself
And as the wind took the seeds away
I have become the streams

Das Messer schneidet tief ins Fleisch
My blood feeds the earth
Das Messer schneidet tief ins Fleisch
When hearts grow wild

We're of the same blood
The death of a child
Your love is a punch, pull, death and a cry
When milk runs dry
