No place
No home
No light
Black marks on white

No place - The great planes
No home
No light - In darkness
I will become

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight, nine,
Ten thousand specks of dust
Ten thousand worms
Ten thousand blades of grass
Endless - The winding path

My earthbound flesh won't last
A lifetime goes by so fast
In the flickering light I close my eyes
As the years go by, go by...

This prayer is a six branched tree
Read aloud! Shout out!
Mouth to mouth! Ear to ear!
Lip to lip!
To the spheres of eternity

Not a song for the dead but for those
Who are willing to live 'til the end of time
Water carves the stone
And I stand alone, I stand aloneâ¦

Beside the six branched tree
Read aloud! Shout out!
Mouth to mouth! Ear to ear!
Lip to lip!
To the spheres of eternity
