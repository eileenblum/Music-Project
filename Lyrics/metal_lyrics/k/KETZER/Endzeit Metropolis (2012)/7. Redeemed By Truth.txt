My mind is a fortress
My mouth is a trench
My tongue may execute
My words, the swords
I am the poison in your veins
I am the cancer, the wisdom in you

"And ye shall know the Truth
And the truth shall make you free"

Free from:
Your feeble existence,
That is bound to believes,
Which never achieved
So now, pray and kneel!
Free from:
Your mindless fellowship
Can`t you see,
I am redeeming thee?

From where do you take
The self-imposed right
To speak in the name
Of unknown high powers?
This cannot be
The way of a creator
This must be
The way of a traitor

Killing to the sound of trumpets
Is Righteousness
Stealing in the name of the lord
Is Justice
Redeemed by truth

Raping the minds of millions
Is Guidance
Glorifying their ignorance
Is Strength
Redeemed by Truth
