Night has come, my friend
Feed our fire with wine
For we will, while the world`s asleep
Kiss the moon in the darkest deep

My name is not the same...here
My vein is not the same...here

For I am:
Collector of worlds
Burning heart!
Come forth, never regret the choices IÂ´ve made
As long as the horizon...fades

So will I at the end of the line
Will I find my way or will I fade away?
Disappear in the heat of the night?
Without sight, lost my roots, I am never to find...

Again, `cause the heart is so bleak
like an ocean so deep
Never regret!

Never regret, never look back!
Tremble, but never fall!
I hear a voice, so clear
Through the sounds of the world

And I see and I tremble
A pale face, blue eyes
Against the bleeding horizon
In shades of grey, in shades of black
Lavender mist, a purple dust

Fade in strange worlds
Fade in shades of black
Whispering walls are breaking
Into earth and dust
Open wide and float now
For I am...

Collector of worlds
Burning heart!
Come forth, never regret the choices IÂ´ve made
As long as the horizon...fades
