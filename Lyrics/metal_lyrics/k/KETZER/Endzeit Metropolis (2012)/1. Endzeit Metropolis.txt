This is the End!

These desolate streets of Metropolis
You`re longing to suck up the night
Take your last chance to drown in life
Fuck the night, breathe it`s air
`cause this is the End!

Metropolis, the hatred, the love!
Endzeit, the coming of the dawn!
Metropolis, the darkness, the light!
Endzeit, the pulse of time!

These lonely streets of Metropolis
You`re longing to kiss for one last time
The lips of the darkness around you
The womb of the ruins above you

Here`s to the end of times
In this darkest night of nights
Let`s dance into wicked crowds
As worlds collapse and hearts arouse
Drinking `til dawn in these desperate times
Until Aurora`s glance shines
This is the End! 

These are my final words
Metropolis, this is for you
As I walk on broken glass
Into the vision of a thousand eyes
I have made my peace and I`m ready to die
This is it!

Metropolis, the mother, the whore!
Endzeit, the coming of the dawn!
Metropolis, the darkness, the light!
Endzeit, the pulse of time!

As I walk by the stars, hanging head-high
Shining on a dark path
I walk towards the light
Open eyes, with open eyes I am gazing
At the sky, hoping for sunrise
Loved ones, forever gone
Are the thoughts in my mind as I see the skyline
Endzeit Metropolis
A chain on my heart, a death inside

First rays in my face
Still crawling from behind
It`s the feeling of the Endzeit
