Is there beauty in darkness and disgust?
In darkest horrors?
Can`t you see the grace of mass graves,
the thrones of decay?

Joyfully, my eyes are filled with tears...
When I see the pain
and the undying misery...
...of the world!

Take a walk through Eden
To trample down it`s flowers
Cut throught the faces of the beauties
And burn the monuments of our times

Tomorrow or today
The glance fades anyway
Lest we forget?
Let us destroy!

Come! Come! Play the Requiem!
Come! Come! Sing to Beauty!
Dance! Dance! In the shadows of the night
Let the horrors shine in brightest light

Dance in fire, dance in flames
Sing songs in burning ecstasy
Dance in ashes and dance in ruins
For a burning world, play a
burning song that`s called:
A requiem for beauty

Is there beauty in darkness and disgust?
In darkest horrors?
Can`t you see the grace of mass graves,
the thrones of decay?

Take a walk through Eden
To trample down it`s flowers
Cut throught the faces of the beauties
And burn the monuments of our times

Tomorrow or today
The glance fades anyway
Lest we forget?
Let us destroy!
