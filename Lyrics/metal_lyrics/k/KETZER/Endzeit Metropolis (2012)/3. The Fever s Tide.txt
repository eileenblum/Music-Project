And when the silence of a bird rips
through the loudness of the world
When the touch of a feather tears the
softest skin to tatters
I close my eyes and wait to die
A thousand deaths in a world with no light
A thousand deaths in a world without sight

In darkness I see
Through minds and flesh 
I dream a dream
of my own death

Hear, hear...the rocks are rolling,
the horror, the fear
Dream, I dream...of scorched earth
and mountains
Breathe the air...through lungs filled
with ashes I choke in despair
See, I see...the overflow, now I`m drowning...

Inside
The Fever`s Tide
Waves break in
Fire in veins
Hot blood fever
Sweat on skin
The salt on my lips is a nightmare`s kiss

Kiss of fever
Heat in mind
Cloth on skin
The wake of a dream pulls me 

Inside
The Fever`s Tide

Face to face
Now so sudden
I see clear
Wisdom through sickness
sight through fear

As I drown in death I see through
tunnels of light and fear

Fear the Tide
Floods of heat against my knees
Grace of Fever
Rolling rocks like beating hearts

And when the kiss of sweet lips
feels like the punch of a fist
When the silence of a stone cuts
through flesh, teeth and bones
I close my eyes and wait to die
A thousand deaths in a world full of light
A thousand deaths in a world with clear sight
