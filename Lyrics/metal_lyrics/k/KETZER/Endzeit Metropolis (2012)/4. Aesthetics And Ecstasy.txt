My life is a fire
And I`m its flame
Fulfilled on surface
Yet I am empty

So many chances
Why not take them all?
So many roads
I`d take them all?

Can you hear,
can you hear the sounds?
And the echoes of the sounds that fulfill me
As I bath in loudness
and the splendour of tones
As I sink into visions
and the splendour of colours

Words open worlds of haunting beauty
Those desperate phrases,
enlightening through dark

It is mine, this Beauty
...this Ecstasy
But suddenly it`s like I got nothing
`cause it`s not mine, your Beauty
...your Ecstasy
Only one wish: to drown in your skin!

And in your eyes
And in your bones
And in your voice
Those pleasant tones

Deeper and deeper
Into the dungeons of your mind
Never ending, my wishes lair
That is you flesh, bones and air

And in your mouth
And in your scent
When will those wishes ever end?

Sounds and colours
Meet as one
Don`t meet in me
Not anymore

Nothing moves me,
nothing pulls me,
nothing takes me
Towards and into
...the Ecstasy
