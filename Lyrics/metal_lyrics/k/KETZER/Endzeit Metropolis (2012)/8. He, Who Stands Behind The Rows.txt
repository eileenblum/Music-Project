No guardian angel
And no healing saint
But a pofane demon
And a reckless beast

Fill black blood into clear water
Poisoning the womb
Bring down the upheaval
They will never return to the fold

He, who stands behind the rows
And he, who burns a thousand thrones
His seed is hate, his harvest is death
...and power

Decisions over death and life
Made in the blink of an eye
Carving wounds that never heal
`cause dead flesh cannot feel

Turning the skies and the rivers
Into a formless crimson red
You drown your tears in shallow water
You will never be the same again

The End - A shattered world
-Dystopia
Marked by the absence of love
The End - Earth torn apart
-Tyrannia
A reign in glory and tragedy
