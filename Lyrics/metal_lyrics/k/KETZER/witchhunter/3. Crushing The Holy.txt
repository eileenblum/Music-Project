Christianity sent from god
Sent with peaceful and blinded thought
Praying to symbols which don't exist
Demonstrate the metal fist

Kill the christ!
Crush the holy!
Make them sliced!
We are unholy metal giants!

666! We are the ones
We were born as satanic sons
Avengers of the northern race
Hunting the divine fucking trace

Crush down!
The holy crown!
Kill the Christ!
Tortured and sliced!

Hate, my weapon to kill
Wrath, my force, satanic will
Evil, my courage, my spell
Bloody revenge, you will die in hell

Metal command, destroying force
We take our power from the infernal source
Burn the churches, disgrace the graves
Metal warriors, not Jesus slaves!

Kill the christ!
Crush the holy!
Make them sliced!
We are unholy metal giants!

Christian culture will find its end
Satan will rise and reign the land
We're on his side full of honor and pride
Now this is the day where christianity died

Crush down!
The holy crown!
Kill the Christ!
Tortured and sliced!
