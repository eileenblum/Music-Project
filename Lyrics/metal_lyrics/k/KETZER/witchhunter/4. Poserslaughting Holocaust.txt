Posers and traitors are trying to make their round
Beating them up and smashing them down to the ground
The sound of metal is spreading the violence around
We are the metal elite, we are standing blood bound!

Posers, slaughting!
Traitors, thrashing!
KILL!

Our agressions are stronger as theirs ever will
We see only one solution which is to kill
Defending the scene by playing out our skill
Breaking their bones cause blood has to flow and to spill!

Posers, slaughting!
Traitors, thrashing!
Until they DIE!

Poserslaughting Holocaust!
Poserslaughting Death!
Poserslaughting Holocaust!
Poserslaughting Death!

Only the true maniacs will fight and remain
Cause metalized blood is spilling into their vein
Wimps must be tortured to feel the endless pain
Don't stop the massacre there's no time to explain!

Posers, slaughting!
Traitors, thrashing!
KILL!

Fuck off and die, we are the thrashing force
Chains and leather are our violent source
Crushing their face we will show no remorse
Metal command - we are fighting coarse!
