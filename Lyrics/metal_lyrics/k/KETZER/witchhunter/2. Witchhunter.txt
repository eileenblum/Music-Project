Witches scream in fire storm
Damned to die before theyâre born
Being under devils spell
Burning fire screaming hell
Time to die the flames are shining
Endless pain the witch is whining
They are evil they must die 
The night is filled by a painful cry

Possessed by evil living in hell
Living in the ban of satans spell
Bringer of torture bringer of curse
Witching hour the infernal Force

Witching hour! Witchhunter! Witching hour! Witchhunter! 

The blazing torches the burning pyre
The flames are shining higher and higher
Hellfire No escape
Dying women Witching rape
Obsessing screams through the night
People watch infernal light
Death through pain and through heat
Fire burnes the bones and the unholy meat
