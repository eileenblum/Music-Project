Riven by bullets
Tattered by grenades
Suffered through toxic gas
Horrible death, brutal warlust

Fire
Be prepared for war
Fire
The time to strike is now
Fire
Warlust is unleashed
Fire
Humans turn to fucking beasts

Seeking for vengeance
Terror over the land
Nuclear strike to win the war
Horrible death, brutal warlust

Steel is melting
Firce is burning
Bombs are crushing
Hail eternal war!

Fighting soldiers, forced to die
Lost in battle, a soldiers cry
Marching to the front, hell is breaking in
Preparing now to die, the fire licks the fucking sky

Captured by the force to deliverance
spilling the death down in the trench
Soldiers killed by countless shots
In countless wars for countless gods

Storming the battle
Storming onto the field
Bullets cut the poisoned air
Horrible death, brutal warlust

Fire
Be prepared for war
Fire
The time to strike is now
Fire
Warlust is unleashed
Fire
Humans turn to fucking beasts
