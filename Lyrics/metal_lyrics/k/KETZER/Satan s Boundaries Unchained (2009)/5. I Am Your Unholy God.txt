I Am Your Unholy God!

I have the force to command
I am the bringer of Satan's demand
I have the mission to kill
I spread the chaos 'cause it's Lucifer's will

Follow the steps to your grave
To the gates of horror and death
Follow the path of the damned
To puter my realm and my world
Follow me into the abyss
To see where this march will end

I Am Your Unholy God
Desire to conquer the hall of the gods
Master of eternal oppressive infinity

I reign the day and the night
I am the bringer of, of darkness and light
I storm the earth and the fields
Wrath is my sword and Satan's my shield

I proclaim terror and war
I am the bringer of death and disease
I break the light of the day
Till death unites us in fucking decay

Follow the steps to your grave
To the gates of horror and death
Follow the path of the damned
To puter my realm and my world
Follow me in the abyss
To see where this march will end
