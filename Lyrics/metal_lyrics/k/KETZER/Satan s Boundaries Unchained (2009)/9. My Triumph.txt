I followed a path
Leading towards death
Marching through hell
My inner spirit destroyed

My will to prevail
Conquers my soul
Success and termination
My own Triumph

No senses to crush
To crush, invincible
As a servant of doom
I begged for salvation

I enter the distance
Try not to return
I break my resistance
My memories shall burn
I follow the spirit
The mighty and strong
Denying the past
My memories and thoughts

This is my triumph to doom the past
This is my triumph to revive from dust

I found a new way
To return to old rules
With the help of all mighty power
I crush my fucking mind

My triumph is now eternalized
In veins of power i feel my new born spirit

My return, forever eternalized
In veins of power I feel my new born spirit

Salvation is done
Pride will rise again
Reconquer my flesh
My body and sou;

Immortal the wounds
Eternalized
See my spirit ablaze
I return those days....
