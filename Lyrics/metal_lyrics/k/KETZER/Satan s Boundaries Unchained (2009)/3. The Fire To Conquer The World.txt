Wake up the sleeping power from hell
The dead become the invincible force
Blinded the legion, follow the master
Soon they incur the wrath of the gods

Bring us the fire to conquer the world!

Slaves of the burning power
Flames claim the sky
Reaching to the stars
Lighting up the earth

Forced to conquer the world
Through the force of fire
Magic of the sky
Light up the pyre

Bring us the fire!
Our will to conquer the world
Bring us the force!
Never bound in fucking chains
Bring us the power!
Emblazed by the mortal flame
Bring us hail!
Punishing unending reign

Tied to a rock of bones and of skulls
Chains control the demonic force
Vultures revolve the bleeding god
Bring back the fire to conquer the world

Spreading disease from the hell of the gods
Sickness and death reaches the world
Time controls life and death
Punishment from the hall of the gods

Slaves of the burning power
Flames claim the sky
Reaching to the stars
Lighting up the earth
