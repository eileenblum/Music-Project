Honour to those who know truth
Honour to those who know pride
Honour to those who know trust
Death to those who tried

Marching forward, come strike a new path
This is your last chance to complete this world
Follow my steps to eternal redemption
To Each Saint His Candle

Slaves of disgrace I call you
Dishonoured souls
Fall into gloomy and despair
Where is your strength and pride?
Don't sleep and dream about heroism
Beyond the world
This is real, this is your nightmare
Dishonoured! Dishonoured!

Search the truth
To become wise
Search for pride
To preserve your heritage
Search for trust
To keep the world apart
Search for your inner morality
Search for your mighty gods
Search for your unique possession

Honour to those who know truth
Honour to those who know pride
Honour to those who know trust
Death to those who tried

Salvation, puter the hall of the brave
As a reward for speaking the truth
Your name shall be written in eternity
To Each Saint His Candle
