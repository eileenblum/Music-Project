Marking the black abyss
The sign of Satan's sorrow
The unholy inverted cross
Leads to an age of horror

Inverted cross
Blasphemy
Inverted cross

The symbol of the satanic cult
brings you to your knee's
Dying through the inverted cross
You'll never rest in peace

Rising from the crypts
Feel the mighty force
Destroying metal command
Defending the unholy land

Inverted cross
Blasphemy
Inverted cross

Steel, pain, fire
It's the inverted cross

In Satan We Trust
Evil has taken command
My force through the cross
With satanic spell
I am possessed by the spirit
Of the inverted cross
The power of darkness
I will go to hell

Formed and forged in blaze
In infernal flames
It's lucifer's desire
Rising up in fire

Inverted cross
Blasphemy
Inverted cross

The symbol of the satanic cult
brings you to your knee's
Dying through the inverted cross
You'll never rest in peace
