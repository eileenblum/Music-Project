Humanity I'm not one of you
Sell my soul like Faust
All that I believe in
Standing still towards
Others at forehand
I'll make my stand
I will command
I am the bullet
That takes you to your darkness

Aesthetic vampires

Aesthetic vampires suck away my life pigeon hearted
Following the horde like fucking sheep but always crave for glory
Aesthetic vampires suck away my life pigeon hearted
Following the horde like fucking sheep - I tell you:

Never you will live the way that I live, I am free
I live my life without forbidden religions
I am my master my own god sophisticated and real
That what's seen in reflection I raise my head up high

I'm free!
