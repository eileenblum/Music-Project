Whore of hades
Embrace me with your lust
The pleasure of death
With one simple touch

Tempter of sin
Traveled throughout the ages
A wicked devilish grin
I'm spellbound again

Possessed by lust
I crave the succubus

Demonic passion engulfs me
Exotic suffering flows through me
Hellish torture beckons through the night
Withering away I crave more

With her unholy charm
There is no limit
The faces of death cry out
Lusting after souls eternally

Suc-suc-suc-suc-succubus

Bewitching all in her path
Possessed to do her will
A diabolical thrill
Cold as ice she'll kill
