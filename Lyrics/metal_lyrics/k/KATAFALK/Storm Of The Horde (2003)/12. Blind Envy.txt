Make that the bastards go away
They stab you in the back and watch you bleed
Cowards without hope in their sorry lives
No matter what they to do they'll be never understood

Gossip they spread around
Tabloid paper for the masses
But keep it outside my reach
Cause I don't fucking care

Act like they are some kind of god
Arrogance written all over their faces
Not for once they will criticize themselves
Unable to see their faults and learn from them

Specialized in comments
Graduated in stupidity
Blinded by envy
Driven by frustration

Try to make it work for once and maybe you will find
That producing instead of reducing is a better way to spend your time
