Talk to me with the voice of a priest
How dare you ask about me
The answer doesn't really matter
Cause there's no one who will listen

You love each other so much
Floating by on your little calm cloud
I won't it hope rain today
I won't it hope rain today

So how the fuck can you talk of love
When millions are torn apart
How can you talk about peace
When war rages every single day

Talk to me about the spirit
While I'm here in the flesh
Talk to me about how things must change
While I only wish it would end

Empty talk an empty mind
Empty acts an empty life

Pretend that you care
Show off your pitiful brain
Ready made answers
Without a will of your own

Not for once can you understand
What is raging through my head
Life and death are just abstract
And war is just so far away

Talk to me about a spirit
While I am here in the flesh
Talk to me about how things must change
While I only wish it would end
