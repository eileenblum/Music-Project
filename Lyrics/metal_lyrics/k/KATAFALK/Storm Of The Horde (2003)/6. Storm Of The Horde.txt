Bonded by blood, horns point to the sky
For far too long we couldn't find our way
Blazing through the night, a never-ending fight
By our might we shall crush the light

Bring a storm this hallowed night
Make a chorus of chaos to quench this plight
Our time of vengeance has begun
No longer dormant under the sun
Dark knights spread plagues of sickness
Annihilate our enemies with quickness
For those who stand in our way
There will never be a darker day

A storm is on its way
You have no time to pray
Our swords raised high
Blackhearts never die

Onward into battle - rushing (storm of the horde)
Sound of metal - crushing (storm of the horde)
Onward into battle - rushing (storm of the horde)
Sound of metal - crushing (storm of the horde)

All around is darkness
Fear becomes your friend till the bitter end
