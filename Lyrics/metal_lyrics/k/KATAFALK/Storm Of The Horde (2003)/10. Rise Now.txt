Goddamn crowds!
Together they will fall
Ruled by one of the same
Awaken by one call
Like hypnotized they walk
Like zombies their minds die
Follow the flock
With the blind as your guide

Living without will
Is like heading for the end
When doing nothing
Your life's already spent

Nothing good is gonna happen
While you wish for the best
Paste yourself together
But you spread like the rest

You're going totally numb now
You live without hope
You're better off dead
With life you can't cope
