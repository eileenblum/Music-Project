Dancing in the moonlight
An ode to flesh and blood
Ritual of death
The pact with darkness has begun

A cursed place awaits
Possessed by an unseen force
The will to kill grows stronger
Sacrifices will take course

The memories forever stay alive
The memories forever stay alive

Bloodstains tell a story
The howling winds sing a serenade
In a sadistic way
The ancient cult of hate

Everything is wicked
Everything is black
Under the spell of death
Evil forces will come back

The memories forever stay alive
True evil has arrived
The memories forever stay alive
Baptized in fire

Awaken from an ancient slumber
Infatuate
You'll meet your fate

Baptized in fire
Evil desire
Baptized in hell
That's where they dwell

Awaken from an ancient slumber
Infatuate
You'll meet your fate

Dancing in the moonlight
An ode to flesh and blood
Ritual of death
The pact with darkness has been wrought

Beware of the evil place
Possessed by the unseen force
For if you enter there
They'll baptize you without remorse
