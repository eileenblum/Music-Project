In a cold breeze at night
A newborn life's conceived
Lying in its cradle
To expect nothing yet

Devil's child - thy name is black
Devil's child - your cries diabolical
Devil's child - rise from the womb
Devil's child - give'em hell

Hellish child

Look at me now
Devil's breed
Veiled in misery
Ready to rule the world
With honor, pride and glory

Your penetrating eyes gaze into mine
They're reflecting the spare moonlight
Your cries reveal the wars from previous lives
Little hellspawn grab the night
There's a whole world inside yourself
Lay down and look inside yourself

Pick me up
Take me away
Give the world
Your ancient wisdom

Maybe we will all learn
Draining knowledge from your source
...from your source!
