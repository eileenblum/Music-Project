The pavement is hard and cold
It's red and and grey and it's raining
I can't feel my legs and my head hurts
I just can't stop complaining

The reason why I started this
Is no longer clear to me
I'm getting colder
I'm feeling weak

One last flight, out of my life, one last dive
One last flight, out of my life, to end it all
One last flight, out of my life, one last dive
One last flight, out of my life, to end it all

It's getting quiet outside
No one's walking by
I try to stumble some last words
Like "I did it my way"
One last flight
Out of my life

My flight has ended here
All pain flows away
Lighter and lighter I feel
To meet my destiny

Lying flat on my back
Looking up through a blur
To the building I just jumped off
Now I've landed here

I try to remember what happened
I remember the last words I wrote
To no one especially
Just some stupid quotes

One last flight
Out of my life
One last alive
To end it all now
