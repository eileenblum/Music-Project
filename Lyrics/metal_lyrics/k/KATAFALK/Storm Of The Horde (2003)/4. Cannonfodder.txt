You never were in touch with reality
You never were the brightest light
Tried to fit in with the crowd
But always wanted to stay on the sideline

But it's going to be different now
This time you have your friends
Speak proud your opinion
At least at the tendency

You stand so proud in your Nazi crowd
You're the first they bury
You're too blind to even see
That eventually you're the scum they curse
You are the one to help them on the way
You spread the word for them

You're fucking cannonfodder
You're bloody cannonfodder
