So you think you lived a hard life in pain
With all your rules and prohibitions
All its limitations are going to end
And realize all your words were in vain
So many times you had to tell your story
So many times you had to bother me
Prepare to meet your maker now
No need for you to be sorry

In state of trance you mutter some words
Not of any interest for the world
You think of the better times and had
I will end your days and make sure that it hurts

I'm your redeemer
I lead you to the fight
I'm your redeemer
I end your fucking life
I'm your redeemer
I lead you to the fight
I'm your redeemer
Here to end your life
