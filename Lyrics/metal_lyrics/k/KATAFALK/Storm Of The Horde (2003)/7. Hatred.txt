Raise my fist against it all
Ram my head into a wall
Is this my final call?
Fighting through till I fall

Pushing harder to the limit
Stretching further to reach all the things man never had

Oh hatred fills my heart
This I felt right from the start
Is this my final part?
This life's so fucking hard

Speed up to the limit
Live fast, die today
Speed up to the limit
Live fast, die today

I can't relate
I devastate
Asphyxiate
Don't hesitate

666 miles to death
666 miles to death
