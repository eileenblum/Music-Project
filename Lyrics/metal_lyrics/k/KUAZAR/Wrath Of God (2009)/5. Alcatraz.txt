Living in the darkness / screaming pain and madness
Surrounded by poor flesh / standing nowhere
Living in a prison / sickness is tradition
Spitting blood is normal / the voice of death is calling
There is just one way / to get out of here
No fear of death / no fear of dying
This poor flesh gets sick my soul / the death is only way out of here
This poor flesh gets sick my soul
The death is the only way out of this inner prison
Alcatraz / I am confuse / alone and refuse
Biological sickness / biological death / there is just one way
To get out of here / no fear of death / no fear of dying
This poor flesh gets sick my soul / the death is the only way out of here
This poor flesh gets sick my soul
The death is the only way out of this inner prison
Alcatraz / we've made bombs / now we make plagues
You feel the death inside you / and it eating all your brain
Living in the shadows / totally confuse alone and refuse
My body is a prison / I can't escape from Alcatraz
