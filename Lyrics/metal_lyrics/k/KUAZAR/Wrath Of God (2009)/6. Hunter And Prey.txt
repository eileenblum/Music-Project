I'm hunter you're prey / this I'll look for you / Desire is my sickness
I'm hidden in the dark / but my eyes have already caught you
Get closer, get closer / hunter and prey / I'm hidden in the dark
But my eyes have already caught you / the flavor of death is in the dark
But my eyes have already caught you / the flavor of death is in your mouth
Butchery insanity is all I see right now / you're gonna die motherfucker
Death is on my mind / your flesh is all I need / this felling is taking over me
Sometimes I believe / there are no angels in the sky
Only demons inside our minds / will to kill
Insane minds / I'm not a freak of nature
I am the deadly fist of God / Death is on my mind
Your flesh is what I need / this feeling is taking over me
Sometimes I just feel / there are no angels in the sky
Only demons inside our minds / Hunter And Prey
