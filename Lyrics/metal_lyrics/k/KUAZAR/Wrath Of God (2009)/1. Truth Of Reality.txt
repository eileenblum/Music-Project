Furyâ¦
Makes me realize the truth
The night makes me feel like killing you
The world war is near
We're all living under the shadow of fear
Reality
Reallity twist your mind
Dissolution is the solution
The dark sun is raising destroying illusions
The Pollution is our contribution
To be owners of our own hell
Breathe the pollution
This is the truth of reality
This is the truth of reality
This is the truth of reality
