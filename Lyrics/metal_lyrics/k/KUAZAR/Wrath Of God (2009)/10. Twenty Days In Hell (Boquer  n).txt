Twenty days in hell
Boqueron was the place where i died
I put my soul on the battlefield
âcause our honor will never die

Sixty years after the big war
My country face the hell once more again
To defend our land
And boqueron represents the pride of my nation

March, march, march
This is our land  weâll figth âtill we die
Surround the fort theyâve taken
No one comes out, no one goes in

Twenty days in hell
There isnât food no water anywhere
The battle always destroys your soul
But this country canât stand betrayers anymoreâ¦

No rain, no peace
But we will stay, we will win
Paraguay is my country i will die for it
This place represents our honor

No rain, no peace
But we will stay, we will win
Paraguay is my country i will die for it
This place represents the honor of my nation

BoquerÃ³n...!

The last day  the White flag
Shows thath the victory is ours
There is no pain
Only a weird joy as i scream to the limit of my voice

Now i put my life and my soul
On the hands of our good lord
Forgive me for the life i took
And i give this miserable soul     This miserable soul
