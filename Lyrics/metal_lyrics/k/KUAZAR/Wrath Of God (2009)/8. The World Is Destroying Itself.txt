We are / living inside an eternal chaos
The mankind is destroying everything
We have to be a little bit more responsible / If the word dies we die too
Wake up / don't be stupid / Be the first to scream against the system
Be the first to release your fury / You don't have to wait
Just do it, And I will follow you / The World is Destroying itself
The fucking world is destroying itself / Feel the last moment of your life / Hear me is exactly the same/ The world feels the same / I can't stand this hell
OÃ­l against life / Corruption, Opretion / Destroying everything
The world is destroying itself / The fucking world is destroying itself / I can't believe
We are selling our world / To a madman / We are selling our soul to the devil / We must release our fury / Against the system / Because the world /
The world is destroying itself
