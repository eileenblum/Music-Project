Black soul / dressed in white
You just have to look behind the mask
I am your hell / white soul / dressed in black
That's what you want to believe
But you need me / and I will make
I will make you die / make you die / can't you see?
The world lives the total chaos
Why don't you / don't you fucking believe / I'm your worst nightmare
I'm your sweetest dream / you're mine you can't deny / I am the boss
You're my slave / and I am controlling all the world
Ambition is my name / and I will spit / spit in your face motherfucker
'cause the world is under my control / hate is my name
Black soul, Black soul eating your mind.
