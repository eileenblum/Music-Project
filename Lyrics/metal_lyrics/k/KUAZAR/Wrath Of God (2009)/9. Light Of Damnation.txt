In the dark of the night / you've never walked alone
Take carefully a look
Around you 'cause the shadows are deforming the pictures
You feel somebody is watching you
Between the twisted pictures of the night
Maybe is the first time you feel fear or maybe the last light of damnation
You can't avoid it / light of damnation / it ain't your choice / light of damnation
Lucifer is watching you / light of damnation / your destiny is in my hands
You are so alone and afraid
Without forces to follow your way / without hopes without destiny
There are no places to go / there is a light / so far away
Shinning in a distant way / you are so confused now
Because this is / the light of damnation / light of damnation
You can't avoid it / light of damnation / Lucifer is watching you
Light of damnation / your destiny is in my hands / your destiny is lost
