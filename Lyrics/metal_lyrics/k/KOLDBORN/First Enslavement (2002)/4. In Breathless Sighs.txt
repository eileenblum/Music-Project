I am a slave, a slave of the condemned
Conjured back into life again
Brought here to return in reign
Rise from slumber now

[Chorus:]
Long lost desires incarnate, reincarnate
Healing so foul sores
Long lost...
Profound souls gone found once more

I am a slave, I am enslaved
I am a slave, enslaved in breathless sighs 
In fragments of absence I drown
Dethroning me from kingdoms beneath the ground
Pressure is forcing me down and

[Chorus.]
Long lost...
Hidden moans are restored
Long lost..
Profound souls gone found once more
And I rise, repent, rise

In breathless sighs - look deep into these eyes 
Everything is sacrificed in our breathless sighs
