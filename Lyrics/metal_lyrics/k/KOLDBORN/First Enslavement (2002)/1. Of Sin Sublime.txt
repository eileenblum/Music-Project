Emancipate the forever enslaved 
Devouring sources of dismay 
Consuming the not consumable 
Controlling the uncontrollable 

This solitude arose to abdicate
Lords of a distant world evoked within
Dethrone the kings of Old
Enthrone the extract of sins so cold

[Chorus:]
Forge the sins sublime
The sins sublime

Foul soils ignite transcendent abnormities
Conjured, employed by mad beliefs
Foul soils ignite grim lying deceit 
Insubstantial concise; ignorant disease
For belief, just for belief...

[Repeat Chorus.]

Vague cries of dark distant times...
Arose for abdication dissolved 
Dethrone kings of Old 
It's my time... 
-the extract of sins so cold

I devour what thou can't digest
Turn soils sour, thy orders infest
Holy father moan &amp; confess
Preached totems; convalescence in death

Behold the forge of sins sublime
Of sins sublime - the sins so vile
