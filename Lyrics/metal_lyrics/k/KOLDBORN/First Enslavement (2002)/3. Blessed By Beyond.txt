Sorrow locked my coffin &amp; forever I will dream
Nightmares never to be stopped &amp; forever I will scream
Haunting mortals, blessed by death
Longing, yearning for their last breath

I'm Blessed by beyond 

Sacrifice commence, my hatred unfolds 
Seeking the power of secrets untold
....Blessed by beyond

Gates be opened, minds be locked
Prayers be whispered, calls be answered

To make the sun disappear, the earth I turn
Divine prophecies in hate I will burn
Man in fear of what to come 
Yet I am the chosen one
...Blessed By Beyond
