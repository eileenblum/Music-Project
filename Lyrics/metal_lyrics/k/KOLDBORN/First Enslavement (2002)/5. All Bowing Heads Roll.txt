Rise lords of our curse, anciently banished
Posses the glory of worthy as gods
Sealed in water boiling cold of no faith
From the abyss they sense our pledge

In awe all bowing heads roll
Disfigured, defaced worshipping hate
Skinned follower feeding a deathwish
Soulless dread, they reach their claim

Revealed in waters boiling cold of pure faith
Disfigured, defaced feeding on our hate

But in awe bowing heads roll
