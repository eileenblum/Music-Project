The cold embrace of Thanatos...
The blackened kiss received through death...
Living this life of loss
I embraced thee, master Thanatos

Suffer, wrath, decay
Kill, murder, slay
Nigrescent is this way
Blackened this life stays

As you reveal my presence 
I release the pure hatred
Created through centuries
I consume the pleasures in death.

Vengeance flowing in my veins
Pure, red, evil rules again
The beast lies within
Beyond is where I've been

Now consuming the pleasures 
Of an everlasting revenge
-The eternal embrace of Master Thanatos
