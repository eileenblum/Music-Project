"Why am I the altar of your fate?"
I hear your cry, celebrate your fate
Seasons change, you age - my feast
Sin, deranged - still in rest
Nameless, the beast

[Chorus:]
Dwelling in the blackened tomb
Resting in the sickened womb
Emerging from the lower gates
I'm the releaser of your hate
-The altar of your fate

Concealed behind the rivers of desires womb
Rising from the mist of blackened tombs

Agony, feeling the pain
Only the pain remains
Nocturnal powers regained
Now I reign, again &amp; again
Only your pain remain

[Repeat chorus.]

Inferior, receive your fate 
Deny forever Heavens gate
