i have seen this placebefore he said where people hurt themselves just for fun my memories are buried here under these rocks i begin to scream but hear no sound they continue to tell me that everything will be okay i never asked to placed on this broken pedestal they hoist me up too cloud their lie and spit on me they're eyes are daggers they're compassion is poison i never asked for this but they've forgotten about me forgotten my smile unattractive celebrity consider me lifeless sincerity my ghost indifference my mask nightmares always end in the morning i won't sleep in this bed anymore leave my name off of the tomb i've been gone along time and i'm never coming back.
