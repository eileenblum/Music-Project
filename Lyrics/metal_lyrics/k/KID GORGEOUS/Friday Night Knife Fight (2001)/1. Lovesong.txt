turn off the hallway light the sheets are covered in blood i wasn't here last night there's red lights and candle wax the air smells like death we breath smoke from the friction the air still smells like death from you i tore my heart out in the white room with broken windows this left me dry i want to know you not like that with poison fingers romancing in sweat no sleep tomorrow when you're on fire you're like fucking razors spit these diamonds out it's not easy we only live six years.
