now that you're dead we're going to make a film of your life were you a ventriloquist or a poet and what we see you're very clever living in a glass house that had been tamoered with your costume is marvelous dress it up and paint it red make it bleed and sleep around some more the ivory tower speaks does it feel like a new sun when you're devoid of misery will you remember us when there's knots in the strings i remember laughing what pills what rope what razor what gun these black sheep are hung ry and i'm still waiting for that perfect sky but you never knew me i never sold you misery you've never seen a gun like this and i 'm glad you're dead a killing machine with rusty gears left for dead it's breathing time again.
