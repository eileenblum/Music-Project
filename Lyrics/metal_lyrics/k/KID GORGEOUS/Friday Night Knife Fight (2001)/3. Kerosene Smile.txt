she's like flowers on the pavement i smother them i feel wanted she's a silent film that never ends saw this coming from miles away these flowers are death and i'm crucified black roses for angela looks like i've waited for too long black roses for angela what a girl a gravedigger out with the old in the wind the noose next time you keep the axe and i'll tear the dime that night you burned me black roses for angela she don't love cause she don't know me and that's the problem if i were to kiss you here they'd call it terrorism no let's take our knives to bed and dance all night i haven't felt this alive since the last time i died.
