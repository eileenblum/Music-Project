I wish you all the worst. These are not model citizens. This behavior is nothing to be proud of. They can't afford this. They can't afford me. As boys we slaughtered vultures and became men, drowning whit thoughts in black water like nothing more than the laughter of children. Ever get that feeling that they've lied to you? We'll all see rainier days. They're going to forget anyways. I've been talking shit and you bought it.
