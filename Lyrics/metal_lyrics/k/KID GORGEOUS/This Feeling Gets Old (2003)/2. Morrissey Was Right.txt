These are for you. These black roses have succumbed to time. There's blood on the petals but no tears in the blood. Not enough to make these flowers grow. Don't cry. Say goodbye to sad songs. Say goodbye to the ocean. I never heard a smith's song that I didn't like. Say goodbye to the memories. Her past is not my problem. She'll look better in cement.
