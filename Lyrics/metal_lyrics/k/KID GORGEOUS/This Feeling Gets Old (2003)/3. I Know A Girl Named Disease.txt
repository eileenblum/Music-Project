Feed me your poison love character. So I can stand eye to eye with an angel. Your open arms leave me black eyed. I stirred this potion that put me under. You're the devil. A fucking liar. I see two. I choked on your black kiss. It melted my face. Left my head spinning. I heard you cry, "the end, the end." My only salvation is fucking, fucking and more fucking.
