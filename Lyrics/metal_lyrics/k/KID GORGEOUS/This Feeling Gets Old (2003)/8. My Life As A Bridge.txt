If love is inspiration, I beg to differ. I wish you stopped breathing so I could fuck your cold dead brains out. It's like you whispered in my ear, "I love you, but pleast just stop." My hands will disappear and I will become sand. I want to stop breathing so you will know just how I feel. we're never close enough to death. Someday we'll laugh again. The earth will love me and I'll close my eyes forever. So youcan walk all over me. Walk all over me.
