Is this what you wanted? It's back to the pen for me. This picture that you've painted is all wrong. So I've smeared your dreams with black. I tore my heart out my plastic heart. You've never seen me bleed. Turncoats don't make good comedians. It's time to stop smiling. It's time to stop breathing. Don't tell me to stop screaming. You never could keep a straight face. What's it like singing my words? How's it feel to bare my name? Remember that cold ember night? This one is for you. They tried to break glass. The wind will break their necks. Is this what you wanted? Is this rock n' roll? I'm gone. Is this the life you wanted? This is rock n' roll? He's gone. It's going to take more than a few hundred bones and a song to break skin. I'm out to walk the earth on a path of the blood of the ones who once surrounded me. This time you've jumped with no parachute. This time I've become a trapdoor and I've found a way out.
