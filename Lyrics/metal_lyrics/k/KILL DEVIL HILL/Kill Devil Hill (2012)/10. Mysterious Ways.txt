Starlight shines by river side
Far away from the city sky
When I'm with them midnight fire burns,
Troubles fade away in strange mysterious way

Summer night under another moon
How do you shine so bright?
Will you light the way to paradise?
Here I'm and ahead strange mysterious ways

Time has taught me all too well
What lies ahead we just can't tell
Trails it got to our own heads
I later came to understand
No matter what they seem to me,
Things aren't always what they seem
