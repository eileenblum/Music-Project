Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
We live together and die alone
Leaving only our names carved upon our stone

Hangman is callin'
I feel the end closin' in
And now there's nowhere left to run
Here comes the hangman

Another ghost of days gone by
Like the souls of ancient times
We all must fall and slip beneath the surface

Hangman is callin'
I feel the end closin' in
And still there's so much left undone
I hear the darkness call my name
As I climb aboard this lonely train
The memories are all that remain
You can't stop the hangman

From the reaper there's no escape
By nature we were born to die
No apologies can save me now
As hatred weighs around my neck

Hangman is callin'
I feel the end closin' in
And still there's so much left undone
I hear the darkness call my name
As I climb aboard this lonely train
The memories are all that remain
You can't stop the hangman

Hangman
Hangman
Hangman
