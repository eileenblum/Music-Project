Feel the pressure
Tunnel vision
Is this for real, or am I dreaming?

Faces of death fade to gray
As generals justify
The price that must be paid
To feed this war machine

Choose your weapon
Set your sights
Pull the trigger of obligation

Faces of death can't look away
Haunting troubled dreams
No choice to must obey
Can't stop the war machine
Faces of death fade to gray
As generals justify
The price that must be paid
To feed this war machine

Reach for your holster
Look over your shoulder
No tellin' what's up around the corner
Lying in wait
A dance with fate
The sense fade
As instincts take over

Faces of death can't look away
Haunting troubled dreams
No choice to must obey
Can't stop the war machine
Faces of death fade to gray
As generals justify
The price that must be paid
To feed this war machine
