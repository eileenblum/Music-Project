As we walk through the hell that found us
Desolate and cold
Nothing left but the stench of death
And purgatory stone

Daily nightmares, shattered dreams
The twisting fires dance to the distant screams

In the valley of the shadow of death
Compassion turns to dust
Nothing left but the wreckage of greed
Remains of misplaced trust

Revelation fire and flood
Caught in the undertow in a river of blood

Beyond the gates of hell
Suffer in pain
Forever in flames
Waiting for the sun that'll never shine 

Beyond the gates of hell
Suffer in pain
Forever in flames
Waiting for the sun that'll never shine

The end is just the beginning
