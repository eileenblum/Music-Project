Burning brighter than a thousand candles
Lighting up the night
Round and round there's no escape
Pull the needles from my eyes
The pain is such sweet pleasure
With a body so hot and a heart so cold

The road to ruin's one hell of a ride

Sister of sin I'm bound to give in
She's our dirty little voodoo doll

I'd make a deal with the devil, girl
Just to taste those wicked lips
Savor the sweet temptation
Until it reaches fever pitch
Follow your blackened finger
Until we touch the sky and set our souls on fire

Filthy little one-shot lover
Why do you keep on haunting my mind?

Sister of sin I'm bound to give in
She's our wicked little voodoo doll
Cuts you in half, then look back and laugh
She's our dirty little voodoo doll

Sister of sin I'm bound to give in
She's our wicked little voodoo doll
Cuts you in half, then look back and laugh
She's our dirty little voodoo doll

Sister of sin
I'm bound to let you in
Cuts you in half
Look back and laugh
