Blinded by the fog of Deception
Can't you see that they're selling a lie
Becoming rich on the profits of pain
As freedom's well runs dry

Step by step
Into the darkness
We're walking down
A dead end street
Criminals and shameless traitors
They get away with murder

There's no way out
You dug this grave
There's no way out
You can't be saved

Infected by the power of corruption
Put out your fires with gasoline
No respect
For the trust you betrayed
Headed for the end of the line

Step by step
Climb the gallows
Justice will be served
The house of cards
Comes crashing down
Salvation at the end of a rope

There's no way out
You dug this grave
There's no way out
You can't be saved
