Wait in the dark for the nightmare to end
No will against my burning sin
Restless no sleep and these days I can't eat
Been hopeless from
This loaded gun

Tortured myself from the eyes of the world
Distance lost hope and from the lies
Was forced out and torn up never realized
I was the one to cause this misery

Time to learn to live without
I will leave this behind
Leave this behind
Slowly learn to cast aside
The curse inside
I'll leave it all behind for you

What does this life mean
How do I move on
I've heard it all
And seen it all
So anxious to live
I am left here to starve
Nothing left to give
I feel the end

Tortured yourself in the fear that you hide
Distance lost hope and the lies
The weight of the world
And I see it in you eyes
You've always said you'd make it out alive

Time to learn to live without
I will leave this behind
Leave this behind
Slowly learn to cast aside
The curse inside
I'll leave it all behind for you

Slowly fade to grey
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
Fade Away

Time to learn to live without
I will leave this behind
Leave this behind
Slowly learn to cast aside
These lifeless eyes
The curse inside

Time to learn to live without
I will leave this behind
Leave this behind
Slowly learn to cast aside
The curse inside
I'll leave it all behind for you
