Under the darkness the fallen souls
Reach to crawl inside
Drawing the evil so close you can see
Through the devil's eyes
Voices start calling from behind
Demons haunting
I feel like I'm losing my mind

Fear
Where angels dare to roam
Fear
Where angels dare to roam

Shatter the silence suffer the screaming of agony
Spirits descending below heaven's gate 'til eternity
Voices still calling from behind
Demons still haunting
I feel like I'm losing my mind

Fear
Where angels dare to roam
Fear
Where angels dare to roam

Unholy they come
Blackened and numb
Shadows dancing all around
Dark lies the sun
Healing undone
Spirits drifting lost

Unholy they come
Blackened and numb
Shadows dancing all around
Dark lies the sun
Healing undone
Spirits drifting lost

Fear
Where angels dare to roam
Fear
Where angels dare to roam
