Daylight fades into darkness again
The moonlight makes us strong
Wake now and rise from the grave
To a world where we belong

Snake bite punctures the skin
As we invite the demons in
Our spirits glow as we let go
Wake up the dead
Wake up the dead

Underneath the smiles and lies
There's always something wrong
Wise eyes see through the disguise
Betray the siren's song

The face of sin a sinister grin
As we invite the demons in
Our spirits blow as we let go
Wake up the dead
Wake up the dead

Snake bite punctures the skin
As we invite the demons in
Release your soul just let go
Wake up the dead
Wake up the dead
