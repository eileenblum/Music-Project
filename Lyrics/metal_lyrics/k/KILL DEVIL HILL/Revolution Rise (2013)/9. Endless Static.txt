Lately I've been hearing you've been talking smack
And smiling to my face all the while
You're telling stories like a comic book
As if it all rings true but I see right through it

Screaming you're so dramatic
You're dreaming it's endless static
All this make believe
It makes me laughed out loud
Hiding behind your smile
Drowning in sweet denial
The web you weave
It makes me laughed out loud

Why can't you find the guts to say it to my face
Instead of hiding out behind the lies
The truth is I don't even give a damn
The face of your deception it's your reflection

Screaming you're so dramatic
You're dreaming it's endless static
All this make believe
It makes me laughed out loud
Hiding behind your smile
Drowning in sweet denial
The web you weave
It makes me laughed out loud

You make me laugh
You make me laugh
You make me laugh out loud
