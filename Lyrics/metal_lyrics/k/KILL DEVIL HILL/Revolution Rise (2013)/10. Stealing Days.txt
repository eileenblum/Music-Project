The least of us
Falling from he heart
The say that we'll rise again
This pain I feel inside is all too real
This fate that's been chosen for me
Is better said than the silence
Or is I'm told
It's cutting me deeper every day
This dark edge of my life runs cold

Stealing days
I'm broken from the storm (I'm broken)
Stealing days
I'm broken from the fall (I'm broken)

What's this holding me down again
There's blood stains on the hands you hold
Cursing the sky where did we go wrong
It's cutting me deeper every day
This dark age of my life runs cold
Face to the sky where did we go wrong

Stealing days
I'm broken from the storm (I'm broken)
Stealing days
I'm broken from the fall (I'm broken)
Stealing days I slowly fade away
