I've been searching
For all this time
Waiting for the day to come
Cause no one gets out alive

It blows my mind
That this torn down field is mine
The rain keeps pouring
But the weather is fine

When the sun meets the earth
Reflections of the moon are cursed
Mirrored stained glass sadness
Lives in all of us
A fire that burns so cold

Waiting for the sun to shine
As the wind blows cold
All the leaves keep changing
As this darkness fills my soul

When the sun meets the earth
Reflections of the moon are cursed
Mirrored stained glass sadness
Lives in all of us
A fire that burns so cold

When the sun meets the earth
Reflections of the moon are cursed
Mirrored stained glass sadness

I've been searching
For all this time
Waiting for the day to come
Cause no one gets out alive

When the sun meets the earth
Mirrored stained glass sadness
Lives in all of us
Stained glass sadness
