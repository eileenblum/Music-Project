Beyond the walls of misery
Away from the shadows of grief
Lies a road beyond the past
Where only the truth lies beneath

Falling so helpless
The hope is all but gone
Rising from the ashes
Let it go life goes on

Escape the storm of tragedy
You're turning in circles again
On our own we rise or fall
The power must come from within

Endless temptation
Black before the dawn
Rise above the ashes
Let it go life goes on

Heal the wounds of the scarred and the blind
Cutting ties to the evil inside
Lost turning nowhere you're right on the line
Face to the future and nothing behind

It's all gone wrong
So dark before the dawn
The past will never change I must move on
So hard to let it go out life goes on
