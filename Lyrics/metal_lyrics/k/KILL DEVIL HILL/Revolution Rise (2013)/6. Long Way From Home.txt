Seems like only yesterday
How did I drift so far away
A prisoner of the distant sand of time
The damage done in days gone by
A tangled knot we can't untie
Memories e left so far behind

I'm a long way from home now
I've been gone so long
Will I ever find a way back to where I belong

Would the past forgive me now
If I could travel back somehow
Across the miles down that old familiar road
Chasing the stars with no regret
A darkened heart I still can't forget
The little things we loved so long ago

I'm a long way from home now
I've been gone so long
Will I ever find a way back to where I belong
