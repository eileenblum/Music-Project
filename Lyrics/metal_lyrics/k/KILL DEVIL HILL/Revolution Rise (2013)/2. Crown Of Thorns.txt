Overcast of anger
In an underworld of pain
The guilt outweighs the blame
Twisted roots of anguish
Taste the blood
Of a broken heart
Deceived then torn apart

Now I'm nailed
Through the hands of despair
There's no escape
I'm too far gone to care

I bear this cross alone
Just doing my time
Under a crown of thorns
'Till I die

Broken wings of angels
Cannot save the tortured souls
A drift out in the cold
Unforgiven demons
Wear the scars of acid rain
The moth draws near the flame

I'm shattered far beyond repair
There's no escape
I'm too far gone to care

Now I'm shattered
Too far beyond repair
There's no escape
And I'm too far gone to care

I bear this cross alone
Just doing my time
Under a crown of thorns
