We're drifting further
Everyday I feel the weight
As we go down now
What once was sacred turned to grey
And alone I'll die in the end

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide the secret
Faith begins to fade
Nowhere to hide the truth
You've been deceiving
Trust has been betrayed

Why you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied,
Why can't you look me in the eye

Unholy fields of disbelief
I hold the light as it goes out now
There is no way I can explain
But the scars you left never mend

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to keep your secret
Words have led astray
Nowhere to hide the truth
You've been concealing
Eyes that bleed in shame

Why you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied,
Why can't you look me in the eye

I only hope that you see why
I always ask you twice
I only hope that you see how
The truth turns into lies

Why you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied,
Why can't you look me in the eye
