Animal Breath Leads Alarmingly
Ardusing The Concience Of Possession Of A Haze - Forgotten Property
... To Hidden Moment In Which You Stand
Further Than The Sense And Fear Allow
The Truth Shudders From You - Covered With A Lie.
Closer And Closer
My Frozen Hearts - Increases The Higher Meaning
And The Energy Spirits From The Bottom Of The Kataxu Abyss
The Truth Shudders From You - It knows That It Was Hidden To Confine
Now It's My Turn - To Enter The Taste Of Instinct
Now It's My Turn - To Destroy The Fast Circles
... Deeper Understaning Of Time
... Transfiguration Of Original I
Pulsing Vibrations - An Art Above The Thick Eddies Of Torents.
I Am The Abstract Prospect
I Am The Mirror Of Birds
Looking At Your Glare Take My Steel And Hear My Scream
Among The Words I Can't Catch Up With - Great Desire
- What Is My Former Name?
- Get Deeper And Recognize Your Sign!
- I Can't See But The Earth Caress Me!
- Your Pagan Faith Will Lead You!
... Torn Parts Of The Mysteries, Catching By The Hunger
Behind Me They Are Submerged...
I Am Swimming But When The Peace Decreases In Wave
Of The Forest, I Will Find My Name From The Forest
Again With Each Tremble Of My Soul
I Will Find It
My Name From The Forest!
