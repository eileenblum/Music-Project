[Instrumental / Ambient, the following is written accompanying it in the booklet:]

Burning Reflections of War's Walls!
Rivers Of Blood Are Endless
The Revenge Of Gods - Enemies Are Lost In Pain!
Look!
Like, Living Candles!
- Let The Laughing Of Witches Spread Disease!
- Let Their Land Become Barren For All Eternity!
- Let The Swamps Swallow Their Bodies!
- Let The Wombs Of Their Woman Rot!
- Let The Sukkubus in Their Beauty,
Like The Running Eye Holes, Tear Apart Their Souls!
