[Instrumental / Ambient, the following is written accompanying it in the booklet:]

Eagle, Come!
Let Your Wings Sing A Song, Guide The Last Comet.
Trees Are Living Again, The Saturn's Season
Herbs Are Flowing Down The Hands Of The Warrior
Constellation Of My Breaths, Because Here Is Great Turning Point
And My Great Lonely Thought
Cloudy Coat Covered My Pride
With Stony Rain I Hammer Every Tear For My Fatherland
Aryan Eagle - Satisfy
Let They Carry Through Milky Way - To The End of Zenith.
Now On The Million Ways of Pre-Darkness.
Cosmic Key In Nine Candles Of Destiny
In Eternal Trance Of The Universe, I Praise The Slavonic Gods
... My Last Words
... Substance Flows Down, And Inside Me Hot Eye's Tatoo
... With Stenc Of Colours I Give Them Farewell!
