I feel it
I sense it
The weight of a thousand years
What have we done, the powers unknown have been released
I've been there
We don't care
Just living with no fear
Now say your prayers all mankind will be deceased
Once upon a time
One big explosion
Once upon a time
They've been telling
Once upon a time
Things were set in motion
But we are soon through
You see it
You feel it
What are you gonna do
Turning your ahead away pretending to be cool
It's time now
To wake up
And stake a point of view
We are already running out of tools
