Funny how I have realized
People like you so high and wise
Telling us how to live our lives
Speaking 'bout things you just surmise
They call you Mr. Know-it-all
So proud contriving in your clever mind
But do you really have the balls
Or could it be you're weak inside
And that you've got something to hide
Seems like you always know it all
What ever I say you're never wrong
If this was a game you'd own the ball
Time and again the same ol' song
Look at you you're never wrong
There are people who want to be
At the center of every scene
Hard as they try, fail to impress me
I'm telling now, you're not supreme
