As I walk out of the plane
I feel the warm air flowing in
Bringing back old memories
Reminding me of the wonder
I've been here many times before
Yet you remain a mystery
What lies behind the closed doors
Senses pulling me under
Tell me, are you the one that I've known
So take me in your warm embrace
I recognize the streets
By neon lights I navigate
I'll never be the same
Crossing through the center of it all
Wings of the night carrying me
To a place where once before
I was calling for an answer
As my gaze is wandering around
You set my mind at ease
And I go on searching for myself
Keep on coming for more
Show me something that I've never seen
So take me in your warm embrace
I recognize the streets
By neon lights I navigate
I'll never be the same
The city welcomes me again
It leads me to her heart
With neon lights I find my way
We're never been apart
