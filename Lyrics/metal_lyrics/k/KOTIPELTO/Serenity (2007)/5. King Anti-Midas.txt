It seems to fall on darkened days
Like trials of the sinner
A thousand and one hundred ways
Just a question of when
All that I put to rest
My deepest desires
Like dreams now put to rest
All brought to an end
Time and again it burns in my head
Frustration, the demons of ego
Losing my grip, the ultimate slip
Dragging me deep down below
Look at me, King Anti-Midas
High upon my throne
Always reaching, not succeeding
Failing to capture the gold
Setting out to rule them all
Falling short of glory
A king with no distinct resolve
Only seemingly strong
Once had such golden dreams
Fueling my desire
Like the Silver of the stars
Soon faded by doom
