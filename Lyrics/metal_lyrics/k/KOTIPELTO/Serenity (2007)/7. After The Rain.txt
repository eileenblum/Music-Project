As the rain pours on
And all is gray
So the leaves fall down
And soon decay
When there is pain, there will be light
And soon the sun will shine
It will brighten up the night
And everything is fine
If the rain would wash away
All the tears from your eyes
Would you find your way back in the darkest night?
Would you still cry?
There is sorrow in your eyes
But still you're so strong
I will hold you in my arms
Caress you with my song
If the rain would wash away
All the tears from your eyes
Would you find your way back in the darkest night?
Would you still cry?
