I don't need a virgin
I don't want a whore
I can't get an angel
I'm not sure what I am searching for
My dreams and reality
Are worlds which collide
Confusion, illusion, are dancing side by side
Why don't you take, why don't you make me
Believe in something real
Don't hesitate, don't you push me away
Come the dawn, finally
I've been alone, but barely holding my own
Here waiting for you to call
Can't you see the wound inside of me
That's bleeding
Time after time
I've been left in my despair
What have I learned
Is it just not to care
Is it too much to ask for
The will to be free
How can I sift through all the lies
The pressure is starting to tear - it's all I can bear
Why don't you take, why don't you make me
Believe in something real
Don't hesitate, don't you push me away
Come the dawn, finally
I've been alone, but barely holding my own
Here waiting for you to call
Can't you see the wound inside of me
That's bleeding
Still I'm here waiting, for a miracle, so damn frustrating
To believe at all
