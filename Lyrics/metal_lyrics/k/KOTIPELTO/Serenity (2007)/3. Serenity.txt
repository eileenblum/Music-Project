By the river all alone
Staring deep inside of my soul
Speaking to my intuition
But the words disappear
As the waters rise and fall
So the tides they are within me
Running to a place unknown
To a place that I fear
Where lies my peace of mind
Tranquil serenity
You can't see me
You can't hear me
Yet you feel me
Deep down inside
Drawing near a seeping dam
Where the streams become a trickle
Running 'tween the barren stones
Destination unknown
Vacant spaces in my heart
Hardened by the constant turmoil
Jaded by the sands of time
In my world all alone
Where lies my peace of mind
Tranquil serenity
You can't see me
You can't hear me
Yet you feel me
Deep down inside
I can't see you
I can't hear you
Still I feel you
Inside of my mind
