Yesterday is like a dream
Nothing's what it seems to be
Another hit, just another score
No emotions will I show
My Blood is frozen to the bone
Feeling so dead inside my soul
SO many things I'll never know
Stalking behind, you are the prey
Waiting to stumble down my way
Sleep well, my baby
Dream on, my darling baby
Sleep well, my baby
I'll be back one day
Lost in a world so cruel and dark
Caught in a haze far off the mark
Try to evade that road to hell
Loneliness, my only friend
Cast in my shadow till the end
A slip of the knife or a twist in the jest I know too well
Irony's hand, writing the play
Leading me down this maze
Sleep well, my baby
Dream on, my darling baby
One day maybe
I'll be back to stay
Tell me are you afraid
That I won't come back to you again
Asking if I'll stay
If I could, I would babe
