[Music &amp; lyrics: Kotipelto]

The stars are aligned, the moment has arrived
Holy light radiates
I feel it flowing, my power's returning
And slowly the air vibrates

Far beyond the stars my mind travels on a search for
guidance
To a place where it can grow and be completely free
I can't deny what I've learned
But it takes so much time to understand the things
And to lay them out for the people to see

I've been there before
And each time I've acquired more
Life is a gift, priceless
The pain inside my heart that's tearing me apart
I feel it disappear, I'm fearless

Far beyond the stars my mind travels on a search for
guidance
To a place where it can grow and be completely free
I can't deny what I've learned
But it takes so much time to understand the things
And to lay them out for the people to see

Now my journey is over
And a new life is awaiting
The stars have given me their powers
My spirits are returning
The time has come for me to arise

As I look around there's not much to be found
Only dust everywhere and a torch without the flame
I see my canopy jars opened by the Spirit Ba
Who's been calling out my name

Far beyond the stars my mind travels on a search for
guidance
To a place where it can grow and be completely free

Now my journey is over
And a new life is awaiting
The stars have given me their powers
My spirits are returning
The time has come for me to arise
