[Music &amp; lyrics: Kotipelto]

Let me take you on this journey
As we go back many years
I will tell you about the things that I've seen
I know it might sound like a dream
I was born into a poor family
Just dirt floor under my feet
Far away from any city
I had to struggle in the burning heat
I learned how to fight and how to cheat

So now we fly
On the wings of my memories
Just hold on tight
And we will travel through time

When I was younger
Hunting on the plain
And the prey went in to the cave
As I followed through the opening
I felt like stepping in to my own grave
The I saw it and I heard the voice
I have a secret for you, it's your choice
Do you want to be born again?
I'll give you something, a mission for you
So come along in to the light

So now we fly
On the wings of my memories
Just hold on tight
And we will travel through time
