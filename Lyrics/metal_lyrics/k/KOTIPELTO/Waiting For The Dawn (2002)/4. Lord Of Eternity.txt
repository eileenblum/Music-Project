[Music &amp; lyrics: Kotipelto]

Now that your life has come to an end reveal your sins
Anubis will bring the scales of justice
Is your heart as light as the feather of truth, soon
we'll see
An evil heart can't enter heavenly bliss

I am the Lord of Eternity
I will guide your way
I am the Lord of Eternity
You'll meet me on your last day

My brother's betrayal made me enter the afterlife
By dying I became the most powerful one
I'm the king of darkness the souls, just follow me
Duat is waiting for thee

I am the Lord of Eternity
I will guide your way
I am the Lord of Eternity
You'll meet me on your last day

I have the power
I've got your destiny in my hands
I will decide your fate
I'm the ruler of the darker lands

I am the Lord of Eternity
I will guide your way
I am the Lord of Eternity
You'll meet me on your last day
