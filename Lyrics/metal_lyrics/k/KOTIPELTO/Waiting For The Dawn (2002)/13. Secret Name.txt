[Bonus track in Japan]

As the days grow longer I feel so alone
Seems like the hours are passing too slow
When I think about everything I've done
They can't understand how much I know

I've been waiting for another sign
My mission isn't completed yet
I've been the one sacrificing on the shrine
And trying to forget

They don't know why I must hide
My secret name, why I became
What I am, immortal
Waiting for my time to come

If my image is erased
And my true name is brought to light
Then my soul will never return
But it will stray in eternal night

They don't know why I must hide
My secret name, why I became
What I am, immortal
Waiting for my time to come

With all my regards.
ROCK'n'ROLL LIVE FOREVER!!!
