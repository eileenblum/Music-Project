[Music &amp; lyrics: Kotipelto]

A dry void within the universal waters
And a mound soon to arise
A heaven's dome, the earth
On the first day came the first sunrise

The Sun god is in his boat
Travelling through the night
Fighting the evil serpent
He will bring the light

Before creation there was chaos
And then the maker rose from the sea
He created more new deities
And that's how life was set free

The earth and the sky formed the first couple
And the descendants were born
The forces of good and evil appeared
Before the first dawn

The Sun god is in his boat
Travelling through the night
Fighting the evil serpent
He will bring the light

Before creation there was chaos
And then the maker rose from the sea
He created more new deities
And that's how life was set free
