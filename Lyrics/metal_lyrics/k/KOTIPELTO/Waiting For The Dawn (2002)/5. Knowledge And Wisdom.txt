[Music &amp; lyrics: Kotipelto]

For thousands of years he's been guarding alone and
gazing towards the east
Noble and calm through night and day on the sand lies
the beast
Under his paw all the secrets of mankind can be found
A rock-cut temple and a tunnel leading to a lake
underground
There I roam forever

Why don't you listen to what I have to say tonight
I want to tell you about the things I have seen in the
past
The knowledge and wisdom that I have gained in my life
All the secrets I've been keeping can't be learnt so
fast

Some legends claim the existence of a secret corridor
But it's well hidden, nobody can ever find the door
In a secret temple there were ceremonies held every
night
Praying for the god to defeat all evil and bring back
the light
And I roam forever

Why don't you listen to what I have to say tonight
I want to tell you about the things I have seen in the
past
The knowledge and wisdom that I have gained in my life
All the secrets I've been keeping can't be learnt so
fast
