[Music &amp; lyrics: Kotipelto]

I'm first to the king, his adviser
Working behind the scenes, making the decisions
The powers given to me I use wisely
Trying to find all the best solutions

Here I walk again, I'm talking to myself
I stay awake all night till dawn
I've been thinking, hoping for some answers
In this game I'm just another pawn

I will fly in a dream
And wake up to my scream

I've been noticing everyone's deceiving
They are trying to avoid my gaze
But I know about the bribes they've been receiving
I see through their lies, I know their evil ways

Here I walk again, I'm talking to myself
I stay awake all night till dawn
I've been thinking, hoping for some answers
In this game I'm just another pawn
