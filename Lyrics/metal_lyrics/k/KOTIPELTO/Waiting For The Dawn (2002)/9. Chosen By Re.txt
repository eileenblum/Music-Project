[Music &amp; lyrics: Kotipelto]

Born to rule as a future pharaoh
He learned how to play the game
Building monuments and temples
They were to spread his name

Ramses the Great inherited the throne
He wanted to restore Egypt's might
As a living god he would to be known
And he was leading his troops in to fight

A warrior whose name rings all around
A pharaoh who rules over the lands
A living god who wears a double crown
He is chosen by Re

When the nation was in jeopardy
As pirates were attacking from the south
He ambushed them, no one broke free
He proved himself to be a leader and he came forth

A warrior whose name rings all around
A pharaoh who rules over the lands
A living god who wears a double crown
He is chosen by Re

He reigned for over 6 decades
And his legend still lives on
We can see pictures on the walls
Hear about the battles he won

These were days of glory never seen before
And his people adored him even more

He made a pact with this enemy
And took a foreign princess as his wife
During his reign the nation grew
And he brought security and happiness into everybody's
life

A warrior whose name rings all around
A pharaoh who rules over the lands
A living god who wears a double crown
He is chosen by Re
