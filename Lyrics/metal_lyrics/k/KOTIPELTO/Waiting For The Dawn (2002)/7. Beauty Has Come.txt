[Music &amp; lyrics: Kotipelto]

Life can't be measured in gold
But in the feelings that you hold
With all your hopes and all your fears there's so much
to share
She always let her beauty shine
It was something so divine
I could lose myself in her eyes and the wind in her
hair

She comes to me in my dream
More beautiful than I've ever seen
And whispers words of love and hope into my ear
I don't want her to go away
She tells me she would like to stay
As I see her wipe away a lonely tear

Time cannot take away her grace
I can still see her face
It's been carved in my heart, buried deep
I just wait until the night
When she and I unite
She will be all mine as long as I'm asleep

She comes to me in my dream
More beautiful than I've ever seen
And whispers words of love and hope into my ear
I don't want her to go away
She tells me she would like to stay
As I see her wipe away a lonely tear
