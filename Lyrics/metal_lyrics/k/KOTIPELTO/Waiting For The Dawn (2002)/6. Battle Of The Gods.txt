[Music &amp; lyrics: Kotipelto]

He was raised to avenge, to make things right
He could feel the anger running in his veins
In a foreign land he began to understand
He must overthrow his uncle from his reign
Learning how to fight using his might
Getting ready to avenge his father's death
With power in his arms and a will to win
He will fight until the last breath

They have started the great battle of the gods
Who'll be ruler, it goes on for days and nights

When the fight begins Seth seems to win
More powerful than ever before
But Horus has the thumb that Seth once cut off
By swallowing it he wins the war
Now Seth is captured his hands are tied
But he gets some help from inside
Using the surprise Seath plucks out Horus' eyes
And plants them in the ground with pride

They have started the great battle of the gods
Who'll be ruler, it goes on for days and nights

They meet again and the fight begins
The battle rages on until the end
Finally Seth is beaten and Horus wins
But will that turn an enemy into a friend?

They have started the great battle of the gods
Who'll be ruler, it goes on for days and nights
