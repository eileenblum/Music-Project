I feel I've seen what I've needed to see
And some things would have been better off unseen
What have I learned and how should I feel
When nothing seems to move me or make me cry

I walk away - don't have a need to stay
I turn my back - I've seen enough for today

I've been around, I've been here and there
It seems to me like everyone's gone mad
The same things are going on everywhere
And it all makes me feel so sad

I walk away - don't have a need to stay
I turn my back - I've seen enough for today

Hopelessness is a state of my mind
All that's here now might not be around tomorrow
The answers are sometimes so hard to find
The more I think the deeper I sink to sorrow

I walk away - don't have a need to stay
I turn my back - I've seen enough for today
