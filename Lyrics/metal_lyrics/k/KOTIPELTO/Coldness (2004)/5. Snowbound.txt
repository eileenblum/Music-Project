All that I feel now, the things inside
They keep on coming, haunt me till I die
No use in going somewhere to hide
The beauty of life, has it been a lie?

So many opinions, it's so hard to see
Sometimes I don't know what's wrong or right
Mist fills the ground below, the moon's leading me
And I'll find my way through the darkest night

All that I have seen on my journey
Have gone away lost in the maze
I shut my eyes and dismiss what I see
My dreams torn apart, they decay in my memories

Everything I see is white haze
It is all around like a nightmare
I've been snowbound
