As I walk down the streets of this town
Completely new to me, what will I see
The darkness is settling down, warm whisper of the
wind
I follow the crowd but don't know where they're
leading me

Can you hear the sound
Drifting through the air tonight
Coming from the underground
It can be heard so bright
I must find more of that kind
The sound of freedom's call

And as we reach a park where campfires burn
It's already dark and it feels so good
Then I see an old man singing with all his heart
I join the circle now watching him enjoying the mood

Can you hear the sound
Drifting through the air tonight
Coming from the underground
It can be heard so bright
I must find more of that kind
The sound of freedom's call
