I'm racing down this empty road
Leaving all the black clouds behind
The last rays of the sun are marking the day
A visions that is one of a kind

I've been away from all that I love
But now I'm back for good or for a while
Going back home, I've been away too long
I am a stranger, I feel like an exile

All I need is here around me
I've been searching in all the wrong places
Here's my home where I feel I am free
I am among the ones that I love
