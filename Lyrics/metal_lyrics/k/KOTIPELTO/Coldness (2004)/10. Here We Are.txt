You can see them everywhere, just look around
They don't even try to hide
You've been doomed to fail no matter what you try
Unless you're standing on their side

Here we are
Holding on to our dreams
We will find the way
Through the foggy and hazy day
Nobody can stop us now, we are on the run
We shall move so fast
They can't catch us, our journey's begun

Making all the right moves to please someone
Would it get you somewhere
Going by the book obeying all the rules
The time has come for some fresh air
