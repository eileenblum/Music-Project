All the words that have been said are about to grow
If there only would be someone who'd listen to me,
stand by my side
The time has come to open old wounds and let it flow
There's loneliness in the eyes of a man standing on
the shore, gazing at the tide

As the evening's falling
I am shivering on the shore
And the wind is calming down
I'm in peace once more

So many days I've been here all alone
And waited for a miracle to appear clearing it all
The summer's been kind to me but soon it's gone
As I watch the sun going down I recognize the first
signs of fall

As the evening's falling
I am shivering on the shore
And the wind is calming down
I'm in peace once more
