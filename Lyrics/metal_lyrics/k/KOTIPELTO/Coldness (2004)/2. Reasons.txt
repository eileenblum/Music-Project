Can't you hear me awaiting
Listen to the sounds of your mind
And everything I've been saying
Don't you see or are you blind?

These are the reasons - Take a look around
Another season - All the things you've found
These are the reasons - Lying on the ground

Hear me call your name
All the things I say

Can't you see me walking
I'm trying to find my way to you
And all the things I've been saying
Are from my heart tried and true

These are the reasons - Take a look around
Another season - All the things you've found
These are the reasons - Lying on the ground

Hear me call your name
All the things I say
