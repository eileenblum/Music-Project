[Bonus Track]As the dream begins again
And it just seems so real
I recall it all from the past
All alone in the night
Still I don't feel the fright
Just wonder how it will be and how long it lasts

What I've seen many times before
The lights were flashing when time was bent
In the end I saw a door
The dream was changing the deeper I went

Beyond the dreams lies the truth
It could turn to go that far
It is so twisted, almost a lie
Cold sweat on my forehead
A shaken mind with scars
Hard to believe what I saw during the night

What I've seen many times before
The lights were flashing when time was bent
In the end I saw a door
The dream was changing the deeper I went


Thanks to strato-fan for sending track #11 lyrics.
