When the circle is fulfilled and the levels are low
It's time to sit down and think for a while
I've been burning my fuse down, no energy to show
All the instructions are in the missing file

How did I reach this point where no bridges can be
seen
To carry me to the promised golden lands
Instead I roam alone in waters not so clean
In the end I stand with empty hands

As the dawning of the day
Comes the clear the fog away
And the coldness of my mind
So I stand here alone
Silent memories that I've known
Thinking 'bout what I have left behind
