Yesterday is like a dream
Nothing's what it seems to be
Another hit, just another score
No emotions will I show
My blood is frozen to the bone
Feeling so dead inside my soul
So many things I'll never know

Stalking behind you are prey
Waiting to stumble down my way

Sleep Well My Baby
Dream on darling beauty
Sleep Well My Baby
I'll be back one day

Lost in a world cruel and dark
Caught in a haze far off the mark
Try to evade that road to hell
Loneliness my only friend
Cast in my shadow till the end
A slip of the knife, or a twist in the jest I know to well

Irony's hand, writing the play
Leading me down the maze

Sleep Well My Baby
Dream on darling beauty
Sleep Well My Baby
I'll be back one day

Tell me are you afraid
That I wont come back to you again
Asking if I'll stay
If could I would babe
