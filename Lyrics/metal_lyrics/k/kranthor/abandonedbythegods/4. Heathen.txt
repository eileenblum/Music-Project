Sun gives life to the earth
Earth presents all I need
Fight with nature for birth
Of continuous man seed

Hear thunder blast and fear
Seek for shelter to hide
Cold dark clouds now have tear
Crops will grow side by side

Heathen from birth to death, just believe in force of nature
That was created and presented to mankind by mighty Gods

Lay in the grass and smell
Scent of earth after rain
Gaze at the sky and question
Who is there behind scene

Heathen from birth to death, just believe in force of nature
That was created and presented to mankind by mighty Gods

Inanna, keep our breeds alive and Dumuzi, fill all depots up
Enki, enlighten our minds, along that light Nanna, bring peace
Otherwise Ningirsu, wage a war and Ishkur, strike with your thunder
Utu, build justice over the world and Enlil, save us forevermore!..
