Mothers cried till the last drop
For the souls of all suffered sons
Just wanted to honour and upbear
Sculpting in stones for beloved ones

When the tears blended with sky
Mothers started to sing, stopped to cry
To waken their sons whom they miss
All forsaken spirits died in flames

Now
It's time for all to die
You'll cry
Spirits are alive
Just try
To escape from their wrath
You'll cry
Spirits are alive

On the road of death
Where pains were set
They rode their horses
To fight and die for their ironclad oath inside

Sons died to save the fatherland
With their blood ground was painted
After that day land embraced the freedom
But not much later people forgot them all

Spirits feel nothing but grief
Sons brought the freedom but could not live
Nothing's left, there are just memories
Which all turned to dust, they are forsaken
