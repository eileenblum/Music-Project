Before the battle of human races,
The sky was Nile, the Nile seemed calm
Enemy caused us to feel nervous
He headed this war, I hadn't expected

Nature resisted to produce blood
For this time there wasn't a flaw
But my bloodstained throne was defeated
The corpses dispersed around my field

The bloody rain
On our heads
Fear caught us
By sudden ways
We couldn't see
Our destiny
These are funs
Of the death

Then I saw the tears for her son
Only eight years past after his birth
She was so upset and a little odd
That was the time I couldn't move

We were in battle there must've been dead
But he was little and I couldn't defend
Now I'm walking all alone through
The place which once I belonged to

The bloody arrows
Coming from hell
Not enough words
For me to spell
The eternal life
Left me behind
For nothing that
I must blame

I wish to take back the time
I know I lived with lies
Greediness made me blind
I'm now at the end of life
I sold my soul to Apep
Putrid flesh and hopeless
Piles of hopeless bones
Nothing to embrace, just pain

When you walk on that road alone
You feel coldness of your dark throne
Souls of the men that you killed
Surround you it won't be the last while you breath
