Our land was fast asleep
When the horror came flying
Holding large grey shields
And swords made of steel

A sandstorm covered the sky
Bringer of the horsemen
The carnage soon to emerge
Blood will rain from the sky

The darkness of the night
Replaced the men's souls
The cold wind whispered
You all will die

Treason
Caught men in their beds
Freezes
Blood in our veins
Mention
Bloody ground full of dead
Reminds us
Why our flag is red

The horror came near
With bloodthirsty foes
Old and young were
All about to kneel

Sun rose behind the mountain
Clouds born in red
They had no chance to wake
Death was their fate

Treason
Caught men in their beds
Freezes
Blood in our veins
Mention
Bloody ground full of dead
Reminds us
Why our flag is red

That night earth pours out
Nothing but blood
Some of us that can breathe
Will avenge, it's their oath

Betrayers keep on living their lie
But someday their time will come
That treason there's no reason
It will not ever be forgotten
