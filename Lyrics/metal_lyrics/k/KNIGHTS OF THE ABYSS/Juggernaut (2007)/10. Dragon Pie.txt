I'll drain your blood
You'll taste my sword
You'll feel my wrath through this knife
I'll take your life
The hole in your head
Exposes lust
You never covered your sin
You cant kill me
I'll hang your corpse before me
I'll stand and watch you burn
I'll hang your corpse before me
I'll hang your corpse before the world
My hands are covered in blood
A needless murder to say
I laugh as the blood sprays
I'm gone
Chainsaw to the pussy
And you'll bleed inside
Kiss the ground as I stomp your head
Give me a reason to feel wrong
Your pain builds inside your mind
Your hate bellows from your lungs
I should have slain you
Like that dragon last week
I will not stop
You cannot fucking stop me
I will keep fighting
It won't be over until you're in the ground
