What's left is the sham of creation
Across the nation people sing
Their affiliation searching for a revelation
Banking on their reputation
The church becomes a military installation
Growing from lack of information and discrimination
I will proclaim my denunciation of this abomination
Who gives them the authorization to change our innocent nation?
Into one of a specific religious orientation
For hundreds of years we have lived under this persecution
Now its time they pay the restitution
Embracing science and the notions of evolution
Piecing back together vital tenets of the constitution
Give people back control of the financial institution
Take the bible as nothing but a book of illusions
Give way to our counter-revolution
We're not the problem, more of a solution
Counter-revolution
