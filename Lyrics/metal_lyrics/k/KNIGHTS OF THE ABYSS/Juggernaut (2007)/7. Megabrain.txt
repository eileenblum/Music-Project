The fire, it rises from the depths of hell
Fear is shown in all eyes
Our lives considered lost
Those who draw swords, prepare to die!
In darkness it awaits you
It won't die until you die
A bloodbath to remember
Come night you won't exist
Here comes the unwanted creature
This beast stands driven by fear
The taste of flesh satisfies its never ending want
The screams grow louder
I hear the children crying
What do I do?
Do I sit and watch this hell?
I highly fucking doubt it
I feel the need to kill
And with these hands
Your days are numbered
And with these hands you'll be dismembered
I will not fall away
The moon lies darkened
No light for them to see
Our blood boils with hatred
