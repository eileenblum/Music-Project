All of you deserve death for forgetting we want peace
An obsessive cesspool bathing in Burger King grease
The poor are doomed to continue falling in the crease
Never with a chance to get their own piece
You sit idly while obeying corrupt priests
You're waiting anxiously for a phony press release
Censoring every action fearing the secret police
Viewing poverty as a conversation piece
Selfishly striving for a fake golden fleece
I can only pray, we can make you obsolete
For the future to escape a now gloomy fate
We will now begin to re-educate
We will rebuild the culture you attempt to desecrate
Blindly allowing the unemployment rate
To grow higher, you turn ambition to an idle state
This restless generation slowly becoming more irate
You force your views into every political debate
Making sex something used to only procreate
Your fucking views aim only to sedate
The ambition within this state
We will rise and kill your brainless hate
We will not stand for a fucking police state
Your sole concern your bank rate
Until we get our clean slate
Fuck you!
We will never be your running mate
Until you realize power in us is something great
Our emancipation!
