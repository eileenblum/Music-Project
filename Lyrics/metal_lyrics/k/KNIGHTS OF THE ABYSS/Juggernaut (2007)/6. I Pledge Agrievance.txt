An army of war pigs to do the work of one man
Without even trying to devise a plan
Innocent citizens under suspicion
Unaware of their next inquisition
Domestic terrorism at its finest state
The victims never thought they'd relate
Until the invasion
Of pigs attacking in the name of their nation
Some stand to the side in mockery
What have we come to? Enforcing only hypocrisy
Becoming more corrupt, each and every day
We need a resolution we need a better way
Completely innocent yet treated like a criminal
Justice served to them all in the most minimal
Super citizen caused a scene
Fed the civil war machine
Their eyes always glow for green
Fed the civil war machine
The uniform of oppression
Leads to a false confession
All to teach innocent men a fake lesson
