So here I wait
As death unfolds
A life once embraced
Now carried away
To burn in hell
Alone I must wait

They screamed in horror
As the blood of man fell
They watched in sorrow
As I brought them hell
Now all skies darken
And I sit with laughter
Your ignorance to life
Will bring forth your end
Amused at such dismay
Your lack of will
Shall inspire us to kill

I ask for nothing more
Just stand the fuck up and fight
Your death draws near

At sunset we strike
We shall draw our swords and fight
No more will we feel this way again
Put an end to it now

Just stand the fuck up and fight
Your death draws near
Just stand the fuck up and fight

Never will I feel
Never will I feel defeated
