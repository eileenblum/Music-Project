Hell, splitting open at its seams spews utmost evil aground
Villages burned now lie in the wake of the crown
What once was a faithful chapel practice a new darkened faith
Demonic armies begin judging the whole of mortal mistake
The blood of all human man death begin to flow
Down the immensely deepened crevasse to the ninth gate we shall go

This retch, the unholy one motions to his sacred throne
Our earth he takes to crudely fashion into rightful vile home
Through towns he walks evoking his demonic thoughts
Spreading sin and prophesying fate
Roaming Elysian Fields eternally

Lurking deep beneath the feeble minds of all mortal men
Pulling the feet of masses lining the streets and there seems to be no end

As the moon begins to wane and the night attempts to speak
The rise of the evil father brings out the beast in me
Possession to him we are; reciting his blackened creed
Our hearts lay in his war torn palms; rising to our calloused feet

Down the immense crevasse to the ninth gate we'll go

Eternal fire from the sky bringing humans to their brink
Malodorous muck engulfs the damned as they regretfully shriek

As the moon begins to wane and the night attempts to speak
The rise of the evil father brings out the beast in me
Possession to him we are; reciting blackened creed
Our hearts lay in his war torn palms; rising to our calloused feet
