First to the death are the sins of the flesh;
those who lurk shielded by the night
The leopardess shrieks thus unlocking inner lust, desire and strife
For those who are not strong, these urges, to life they are drawn
To commit sins of lust means to be aimlessly thrown at the will of an almighty storm

This raging tempest does exhaust the mind as the bodies are torn about
The screams of the unholy cannot be heard over the thunderous shout
Eternally blown in violent winds of hail their bodies do beg rest

The sins for which we pay, appeal to the most lustful of men
Hunger for depraved acts of flesh entombing your soul in sin
Your skins with boils and puss must burst the wind beats your back
For the morals with which you stay heaven's eternity you lack

Those who spend their mortal lives in industries immersed in sex
Treacherously crave for flesh this penalty should not perplex
To lose oneself in a diabolical path is to needlessly wonder
The storm fulfilling the ultimate wish leaving souls to forever ponder

In this realm, which you now dwell: in the second circle pit of Hell
