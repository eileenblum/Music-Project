Enslaved for eternity the shades of humans await
Final judgment from the gods shall leave hell in their wake
During they're stay in this putrid land
Encased in tombs at the satanic hand

As the gates creep open they reveal the crimes of the inner circle of hell
Ones knowingly betrayed against good judgment and will
Here dwell the heretics who worship unorthodox gods
Epicureans alike burn in this realm for their unholy thoughts

Forever in stasis to which they've been damned
Trapped in a fiery tomb
Dwelling in terrible gloom

The future to them is in sight
For the present to them is like night

Dis the sinister city of evil, a constant reminder of wicked deeds
Tombs of the heresy line this town, testament to obey his creed
For those who mortally dethroned their god; building their own idol
Thrown to their case of unbreakable might eternity spent in fire.
