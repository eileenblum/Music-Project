Come forth and rise it's time for demise
So stand and watch as humanity dies
I'm tired of caring I'm tired of lies
So stand and watch as infidelities rise

I'm dead to affliction, I'm dead to reform
I'm done forgiving and they still want more [x2]

I've completed the circle once more I'm abase
Nothing to give and I'm stripped of my pride
I'm nothing inside and I'm made up of lies
So stand and watch as humanity dies

Faced with the truths of humanities hate
I spew hostility for I see my own fate
I'm done pretending I'm done with this game
Let's take it back remove all this shame
Remove our shame

Facing the end of a life so corrupt
Your reign so over extinct you become
Nothing to show for a life of heresy
Forever you sail on the seas of dismay

Facing the end of a life so corrupt
Your reign so over extinct you become
A blanket of fear now covers humanity's eyes
Dead to the world that is so filled with lies

What's next for us
And we shall see
The toppling of humanity
With new found eyes
And we will be
This world will see
Persevering relentlessly
