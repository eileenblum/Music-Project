Thine will be done 'neath thy serpent sun
Thy servant son hath now been shunned
From all the land where blood was shed

Thy rotten lamb you shall be fed
Sacrificial oath that poisons most

Creating a demigod that shall provoke
You're rotting but your wealth you retain
Lavishness is showered upon your ancient bloodlines
This garden planted with plagued seeds is sprouting and
They sing:

Give into temptation!
Give in to the sin!
Give into the evil ways of thy wealthy kin!
Give into violence!
Give into the lust!

Lie cheat and kill if you must!

A blood oath evolution of ones self
Transforms thy world into a worsened hell
Hail! Hail! O' angel that fell!

Creating a demigod that shall provoke

Good bye to mortality
Good bye to laws
Good bye to all
They sing:

Give into temptation!
Give in to the sin!
Give into the evil ways of thy wealthy kin!
Give into violence!
Give into the lust!

Lie cheat and kill if you must!

A blood oath evolution of ones self
Transforms thy world into a worsened hell
Hail! Hail! O' angel that fell!
