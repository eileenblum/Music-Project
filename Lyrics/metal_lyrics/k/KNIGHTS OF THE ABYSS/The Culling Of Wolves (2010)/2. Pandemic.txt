Behold this epic pandemic molding a nation of fear
Breaking laws of genetics immense empire draws near
Getting off by playing god absurd malicious fraud
They germinate the populous

They germinate the populous plaguing all that's in sight
Forming a robotic metropolis
And so the cancer spreads with no hope for a cure
We are the anti-bodies this struggle we endure
Getting off by playing god absurd malicious fraud
They germinate the populous [x2]

Born into a pool full of failure we did not choose this fate

Take control of these reigns before it's too late born into a pool full of failure we did not choose this fate [x2]

Bow down you fucking slave
We are the anti-human race
Now dig your fucking grave
Humanities ultimate disgusting disgrace
We are the villainous vermin the anti-human race
A whole new meaning of self-loathing sin pandemic of epic proportion begins

Take control of these reigns before it's too late born into a pool of failure we did not choose this fate [x2]

We are the anti human race [x3]

So come with us and you will find
Hidden evils inside your mind
Give up all hope and your battles within
This is where the pandemic begins

So come with us and you will find (you will find)
Hidden evils inside your mind (inside your mind)
Give up all hope and your battles within
This is where the pandemic begins (pandemic begins)
