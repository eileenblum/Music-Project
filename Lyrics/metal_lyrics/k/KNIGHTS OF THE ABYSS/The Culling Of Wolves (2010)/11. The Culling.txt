This world is evil  their souls are corrupt will we stand for truth or be
tossed about they are like brute beast creatures of instinct  born only to be
caught and destroyed unite gather their kind unveil the darkness of these
troubled times reveal the elite for what they truly are uprise and come forth
soldiers of revolt sons and daughters of this desponded  world stand against
their poisonous of plots hear the cries of the silenced cleansing fire is near
as darkness emerges stand without  fear beware the years of seven the stage is
now set the years of seven the stage is now set overthrow these tables of
unjust men overthrow this temple of countless sin face the truth of your final
demise Its your turn to bow in fear stand for justice stand for truth undo the
practice of repulsive abuse bleed them out force them down refuse their lies
and may truth resound eternally treason among the sworn they've shut the mouth
of humanity arise the soldiers of light
