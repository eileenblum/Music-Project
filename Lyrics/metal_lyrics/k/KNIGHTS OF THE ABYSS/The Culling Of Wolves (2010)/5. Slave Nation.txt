Endlessly torn on the lives which they once lead, on innocence they so sadistically feed
Swiftly they'll destroy what's placed in their hands, none shall diminish their hatred most putrid of wrath this army

Are we hopeless against this timeless machine?
They're taking their throne and completing their scheme
Open your eyes,
Realize your demise,
Your slaves to malarious materialistic lies.

Secrets they share taking endless control this is the culling of warriors behold
The takers of blackened corrupt evil souls forcefully stopping their hidden control
Bask in your filth you creature of self
Selling your soul for a moment of wealth
As you now rise we too shall plot to halt this machine from reaching the top

Are we hopeless against this timeless machine?
They're taking their throne and completing their scheme
Open your eyes,
Realize your demise,
Your slaves to malarious materialistic lies.

Hopeless we're not, to the cynical counsel of the corrupt
Your hundred year reign is exposed to the world that your order has fooled

So form all ye brothers
Prepare for a war
Take back our nation in a fiery storm
Stand for your pride (stand for your pride)
Stand for your life (stand for your life)
They'll over come if we don't stand fight
They'll strip away our pride with weapons of dept at their sides
So form all ye brother prepare for a war

Destruction of the so called divine,
Destroying their disguising disease,
Take this back [x4]
