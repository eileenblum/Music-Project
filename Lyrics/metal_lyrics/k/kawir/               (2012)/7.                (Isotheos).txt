THE FIRST ORIGIN OF MY ORIGIN
THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF MY PRINCIPLE
THE FIRST BREATH THAT YOU ARE INSIDE ME
THE FIRST FLAME OF FIRE  INSIDE OF ME
THE FIRST DROP OF WATER INSIDE OF ME
THE FIRST GRAIN  OF EARTH INSIDE OF ME
FROM TODAY AND THIS MOMENT
WITH IMMORTAL EYES AND SPIRIT
I GAZE AT HTE LORD OF THE FLAMING DIAMONDS

ACCEPT ME CAUSE I AM THE SON

I DON'T FEEL A HUMAN BEING  NOR ANY LIVING CREATURE
NOR SENSE ANYTHING OTHER OF EARTH
BUT I AM ABLE TO SEE ALL THE IMMORTAL BEINGS
THE GODS MOVING IN THE UNDESCRIBABLE SIGHT OF STEAM
NAILING ME WITH THEIR EYES 
RUNNING FURIOUSLY TOWARDS ME

THEN I SEE THE GODS LOOKING AT ME WITH KINDNESS
AND WHEN THEY WELCOME ME I HEAR A PAINFULL SOUND

I AM A STAR THAT WANDERS ALONG WITH YOU
SHINING IN THE ABYSS
