Sinn, goddess of the moon, immortal of the immortals 
Supreme queen of darkness, blazing goddess of the moon 

Looking beyond, the endless horizon, where darkness unites with infinity 
Where hate, embraces passion, where fate belongs to me 

"The wind was dark until... then formed the light of the golden crown 
As the blaze shines upon the oar, she wets her body in the water of the ocean" 

The nocturnal eye, is crying, in darkness resounding, his howling 
The trees are singing the calling, for Sinn, the forbidden goddess Sinn... 

"She is dressed with her cloak, which moon-lights the earth 
As she rides her strong horses to the sky 
Hail Sinn! Hail the goddess! Hail blazing queen!" 

The howling of wolves, the winter in my soul, whispers of snakes sting my mind 
My passion for you is still alive, Oh! your passion...screams of pain 

Sinn, goddess of the moon, immortal of the immortals 
Supreme queen of darkness, hear my death-call 

Mother of blasphemy, mother of unholy creatures 
Let me offer you my soul in your deep-black arms 

Coming to my embrace...
