Erebus, Erebus.
The never ending chaos.
The source of every life.
Gave birth to darkness and
The black night.
Darkness, darkness rules everywhere.
Lighting flashes tear it apart.
Thunders hit the mountains of mother earth.
Slowly the rage stop and the earth sinks.
In eternal darkness.

Darkness again.
Darkness again.

Darkness rules everywhere.
Lighting flashes tear it apart.
Thunders hit the mountains of mother earth.
Darkness, darkness faithless darkness.
And this eternal night who feeds on truth
In the abysmal chaos.
Darkness which grew in thy womb.

Oh mighty gods
