We invoke the powers of planets.

Zeus give us the wisdom.
Mars give us the mighty energy.
Lunar give them feelings.
Venus give us the power of attraction.
Mercury give us the ability of logic.
Saturn give us the primitive science.
Uranus give us the strength of evolution.
Pluto give us the power of disaster.
Neptune give us the chaotic mysticism.
Sun give us the ultimate reign.
