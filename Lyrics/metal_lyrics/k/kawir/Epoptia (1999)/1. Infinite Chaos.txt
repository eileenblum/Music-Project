In the beginning, the eternal chaos ruled
The everlasting one.
The one that had sank in the depths of darkness.
Chaos was the source of life.
Chaos is the source of life.

Everything has come from the infinite chaos.
The whole world and the immortal gods.
The planets and the stars by its cosmic breath.
Gave life to everything...

There were no planets but it gave birth to them.
There were no moons but it gave birth to them.
There was no earth but it gave birth to it.
And even tartars were born by chaos.

In the beginning there were no stars but
They were born by chaos.
Chaos gave birth to dreadful darkness and
To the eternal night.
There were no comets no meteorites, no planets.
But there was chaos, only chaos...
The infinite chaos.
