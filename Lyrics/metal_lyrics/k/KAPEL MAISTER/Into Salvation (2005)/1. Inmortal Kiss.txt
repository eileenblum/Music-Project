I feel the endless
Death in barren lands
The sun's hide in the sky

My holy quest
Has come to an end
Victory far away

Now we all shall die in the realm of warriors and kings
I will live again and will carry on until the end

My sweet heart will always understand
If you can give me the immortal kiss
Eternal pain I will soon forget
If you can give me the immortal kiss

Where's my princess?
I will not give up
I will not close my eyes

Dying with glory
Now I understand
She was never there for me
