Centuries ago a struggle began
Through time battles were fought
The beast was forced to hide
But it kept coming, evil darkness
Once again is rising from the shadows

We had times of light
Times of love and peace of mind
Those days have ended

His shadowy eyes had found
A new unaware soul
My sweet little girl is the chosen one

The sky is turning black
The light is fading away
Her guardian angel is crying
For her arms are bind until the storm
Destroys this innocent soul

From the depths of hell
Merciless, he will take her soul
Strongest pain ever felt
Screaming inside, no way to resist

Help me Father, I am lost in this dark place
So alone crying tears of ice

Feeling hopeless and cold
Waiting for your healing hand
To softly caress my shattered soul

GLORY TO GOD
Savior of everyone
GLORY TO GOD
His kindness is greater than the skies
GLORY TO GOD
