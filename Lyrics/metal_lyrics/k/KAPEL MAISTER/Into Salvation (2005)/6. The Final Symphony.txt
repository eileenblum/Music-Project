We are living in a dream of grief and doom
Cruel darkness of the night will never die
And walking through this path we'll reach the eternal salvation
Waiting for the light to come
Victims of this endless tragedy

With the shadows of the night you'll see it come
And mankind will cease the fight and realize
The end of war will come when you find out who you are
Look deep and hard inside your soul
And you might live all eternity

Look far beyond the sky
Try not to close your eyes
The angels are coming for you
Now you will hear again the glorious epic song
Right here lays the final symphony
