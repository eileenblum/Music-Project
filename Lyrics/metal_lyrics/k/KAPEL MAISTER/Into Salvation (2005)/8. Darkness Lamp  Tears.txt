[Part I â Last Tears Fall]

[Part II â Dark Marriage]

Many thousand years have past
But the sky is always black
As the depths of my broken heart
Still I remember those empty days
Nobody holding my hand, no one to guide me

Suddenly on this warm and misty night
I heard your sweet voice, calling me softly
Among shadows you came to show me
The kindness of your cold heart

So I felt thy sharp blades in my neck
Leaving the sun behind
Together under the moonlight
Loving each other through endless nights

I'm just a motherless child
Lost in the mists of eternal life
Waiting for answers alone in the dark
Yearning to be right by his side again

Long ago, everything was perfect by your side
Nothing could make us part, But I was wrong...
Those days are gone... Now death is here for you
Hold me tight...

Now you will hear my voice
Unholy Death... Shall not hide from me anymore
I command thee! Show me your eyes in the sunlight!

[Part III - Reunion]

And take me to the final kingdom
Where he dwells in silence, waiting for me
I'm coming, my love
To rule the afterlife
Safe by your side
