Every time is just another nightmare
Look all around, I only see shadows
Is the abyss of existence
That fills my life with pain

I am bleeding out, dying to live
I pray for salvation

They're always haunting me
Those daemons from my past
Will keep coming forever
To devour my soul

I am bleeding out, dying to live
I pray for salvation

God of the holy skies
I beg for your magic light
Strike down with the mighty power
Of the Thunderforce

Can you feel the pain
My god will slain you all
The legions by his side
I live again with peace inside

I am bleeding out, dying to live
I pray for salvation

I was bleeding out, dying to live
I owe you everything
