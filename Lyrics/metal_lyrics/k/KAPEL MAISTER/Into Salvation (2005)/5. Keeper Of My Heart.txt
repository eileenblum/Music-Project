Darkness is rising in my life
Sadly I must hide in this frozen prison
You can't see or touch, defenseless
And fearful I hear the Great Storm is near

Now I feel safe in your arms
And you're looking at me
With those beautiful eyes
Bliss and love are back in my life
You are the keeper of my heart

Walking through this meadow of sorrows
Knowing there is no way out

I reach the edge just to see
Death is waiting for me

ï¿½Take me awayï¿½, crying I whispered
But suddenly the voice of angels was heard
Only you could make the Endless Night go away

Both angels and daemons are on their knees
While you proudly walk towards me
To end all this pain
