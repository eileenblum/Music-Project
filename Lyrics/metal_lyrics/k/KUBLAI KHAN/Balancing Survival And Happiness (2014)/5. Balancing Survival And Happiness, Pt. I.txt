In other people I've lost most faith
But who's to say I'm not viewed the same
[2x]

Here's to me

I am in need
Because I want not need
Not feeding the hungry
No soothing relief
Now look down on me
I am the worst of these
Because I beg for more
Knowing other's need

Applaud me
I'll bow
As I pat my own back
For thinking good thoughts
Tilt your nose up
The balancing act

Hang my head as these problems
Scream out
You selfish fuck [2x]
Children cry
People die
Countries fight &amp; all I
Do is think of myself

Such is human nature
I've lost my way

But I was given two hands to help too
Human rights
Drone strikes
War
Public lies
What can I do? [2x]

In other people I've lost most faith
But I'm trying to fix my mistakes

We're all balancing survival &amp; happiness
