One step forward two steps back
I've lived
To little to have lasted
This long
Face facts
Life's fast
Catch up
To what I ask
Your dreams?
Hear me

I'm no scholar
No touch
I'm no one with the locust
Who left his shell behind in search of second life

I'm not
What you had
Ever hoped for

I learned more from music
Than from any teacher or text book

But I never asked for that
I remember being young &amp; all I wanted was to be beautiful in your eyes
But I've come to one fucking conclusion
There's no place for
Me

The youth war is over but I don't know if I've
Won or lost
I'm no one with the locust
Who left his shell behind to live a life of sleepless nights
Sleepless nights

I'm not what you ever hoped for
