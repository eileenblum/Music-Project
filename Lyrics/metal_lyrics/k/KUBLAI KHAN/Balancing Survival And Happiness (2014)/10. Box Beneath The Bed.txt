Why can't life be like the photos
Stored beneath the bed?
The joy of a moment
Forever frozen
Keeping us alive
Paper fortress
Who's sole
Purpose
To remains &amp; never change
But the people &amp; places
They never stay the same

Time waits for no one
Why would it wait for me?

Losing my life
I'm chained to memories

Despite all the years passed
It won't change
If a picture's worth a thousand words
I can't stay quiet

Why can't life be like that thin moment
When everything made sense

Time waits for no one
Why would it wait for me?

Losing my life
I'm chained to memories
