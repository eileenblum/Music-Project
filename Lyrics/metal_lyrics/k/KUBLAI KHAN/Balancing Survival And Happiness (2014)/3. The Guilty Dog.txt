Lonely
Am I though I try
To look otherwise
Laugh or smile
Disguise or rather hide
The insecurities is it I feed
You ask
Why mask what the fuck is going on with me?
Fuck

Why should you care?

&amp; I remember thinking to myself
God if you're up there send me down someone
Who gives a fuck

It's hard living, it's hard times
In my mind
Doubt everything around me
Yet I say
You're not fine
I tell myself
You're not right

It's insane the things I wish that I had felt
Like the piercing sting of a father's belt
Because tough love is still love
Love's tough, I know this much
I'll tell you right now motherfucks life's harder when you got none
Shit
&amp; yet still I try

They say the guilty dog barks first
&amp; I've been barking till my fucking throat hurts
[2x]

For many years I've tried
To escape what makes me, me
But all I wanted my whole life was for someone to give a fuck
