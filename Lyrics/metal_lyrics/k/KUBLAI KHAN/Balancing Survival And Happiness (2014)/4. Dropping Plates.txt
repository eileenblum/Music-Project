I dread
Waking up in the morning
No time to breathe
This is my life
Nine through noon
Noon to night

I clock in
Seen as a servant
Every hour another nerve is hit
My rage boils deep behind my eyes
I smile while 'Please sir I apologize'
Somebody please get me
The fuck out of this place

Now think back to what you're working towards
Fuck this shit
Keep it together
Keep moving forward

So I keep my composure
Don't hesitate
I play the game though I feel
Like dropping plates
Fuck

I tell myself that it's for the best
Collect tips &amp; cash empty pay checks
From fucks who can't even remember
My name
One simple thing
I'm dropping plates
