Plastic flowers
On a cold level splay
Cigarettes lay sizzling
In your
Tarred ash tray

46 &amp; always sick
My hopes
They were all gone
Vacuum lips &amp; every bit of smoke
Is withdrawn

Get up [2x]

A rush of fire burns
I'm in its light
Choked up or chained down

&amp; I burned with it
&amp; I burned with you

Every time you coughed
I feared the very worst
Thinking you ate smoke
To cure your belly's thirst

Like loose change in a coffee can
Your throat it would burst
&amp; I wanted better for you
Strangled your days were cursed

Charred lungs
&amp; breath that smoldered
I just couldn't see it
Till I got older

You spoke through crackles
&amp; you walked as if you were shackled
Slowly but surely
It got you too

&amp; I just watched
I did nothing
Fuck
