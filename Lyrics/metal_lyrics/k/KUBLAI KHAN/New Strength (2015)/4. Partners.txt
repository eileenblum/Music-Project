Poverty
Dwells inside of me.
See sweet innocence
Taking what Iâm given
Twisting any sense left struggling inside of me
Your heart is a pit where my actions make a new nest
To lick their wounds
My mistakes congregate.
My weak traits
All lie in wait
For love and lust
For the two to separate
But they always find a way
Get away
In the silver moonlight they both dance
In a perfect course
Soft steps set the pace
Slow moves sweep
Night after night the two meet
They lose themselves
As the tension builds
Temporary fix for a
Heart impoverished
You canât change me
Hopeless. Just leave
Iâm never who you thought I was
Empty life with a fake agenda
Iâm the worst kind. Fooling hearts
Your pain your hate
In the silver moonlight they both dance
Your hate courts your heart
And they twist about.
Your hate courts your heart
And they twist about.
