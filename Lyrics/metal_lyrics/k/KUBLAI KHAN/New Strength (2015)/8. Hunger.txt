I canât take it
Yet I try not to admit
My lack of action my refusal to comfort is dangerous.
Iâll put it off I say
Iâll wait until another day
But just remember
There are dogs out there who are always hungry.
Looking to get their fill
When you slow down they wonât
That success. Hard earned sweat. Becomes someone elseâs meal.
So keep your head down and work it out.
Think it through. Time to choose
If youâre left. Wishing youâd tried more.
Are you where you wanted?
Instead of being haunted
By maybes and question of doubts asking what if?
Donât waste your time donât even rethink it.
The world wonât wait for you
So you gotta do what you do
The world wonât wait for you
So you gotta do what you gotta do
No one will wait for you
Caught in between
Reality and my own dreams
I see where I want to be
Just seems I never know how to get there
Forget your sense of entitlement
Complain. Expect. But wonât work for shit
Waste away I could give a fuck less
Iâd rather earn it
Id rather die than be useless
So keep your head down and work it out.
Thin it through. Time to choose
If youâre left. Wishing youâd tried more.
Are you were you wanted.
Instead of being haunted.
By maybes and question of doubts asking what if?
Donât waste your time donât even rethink it.
If every dog has his day then whereâs mine?
Keep my head up but life wonât let up
Wonât hope for better days work til they come my way
Wonât hope for better days work til they come my way
