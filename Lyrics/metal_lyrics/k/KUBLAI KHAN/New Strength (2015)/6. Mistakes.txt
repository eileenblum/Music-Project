I sink again
Goddammit, I want to break all I do is bend
Iâm sick of waiting. On fucking maybes
Iâll twiddle my thumbs while you
Make up your mind that
Weâre not worth the time and
Fucking effort never
Resentment rests in my bed
No sleep for me. Hang by a thread
Worth-less self worth
I sink lower
I wasnât
Always like this
Heart break
Reshapes
But it cannot erase our mistakes
I push through
What else can I do?
Just push through what else can we?
Such a bitter bitch life is
To discover you're not worth shit
Not what others want to see
Not even who you wanna be
I dig deeper
Maybe my problem is me
Still thereâs got to be more
Were we meant to live this way?
To drift away?
I refuse
To believe
Thereâs no way out
Tunnel visions got me seeing
Little past this sour feeling
Patience and clarity
Grant me new strength
Somethings arenât meant to last
My nature's to the live the past but it
Proves to do me no good
Iâm thankful for you
Gave me love gave me time gave me you but
No more
Time will pass on
