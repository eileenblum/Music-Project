In the night glows mimic
Embers in the tail lights.
In the back seat hidden I rest my eyes
I hear the words 
I follow the visions
Imagine thereâs no heaven
Or the hell that I live in
Imagine thereâs no countries
It isnât hard to do
Imagine all the people you thought you knew
Hatred. Violence. Discord
No hell below us
Above us, sky
Nothing to kill for 
None forced to die
No possessions
Imagine if you can
no greed, no hunger
A brotherhood of man
Virtue. Justice. Embrace.
Imagine all the people sharing the earth 
You may Iâm a dreamer
But Iâm not the only one
I hope that one day
A day so soon 
I can join you
And the world as one.
