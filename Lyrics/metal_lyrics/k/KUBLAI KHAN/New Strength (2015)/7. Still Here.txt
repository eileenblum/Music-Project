Something on my side
Built me up
And gave me pride
Helped me cope
Helped me survive
A choice in life
Helped me define
Myself in time
Of both body and mind
How you live is
Your choice
I hold this close
To me
I know its hard enough as it is
Trying to motion through every day bullshit
Growing up fast
Seeing my
Mother fall helplessly victim to
Substance abuse
Fuck
If Iâll ever become that
A better life better chance
Better plan
Still learning
Still listening
Still searching
For my myself
I know itâs hard enough as it is
Trying to motion through every day bullshit
I know itâs hard enough as it is
Trying to motion through every day bullshit
This is for us, the few left
The ones still standing. Fuck what they think
Still here. Still clean.
For Susan Griffith, eating pills
My brother Shawn, a drunk driver killed
In this life
My choice remains the same
Forever unchanged
