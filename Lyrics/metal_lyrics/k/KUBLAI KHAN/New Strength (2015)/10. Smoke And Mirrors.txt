Set it off
Early in life the act of hearing art
Kept me from falling apart
Craving to create
I couldnât be like them
I couldn't settle down then
Dry up and die
Why the fuck we survived is to my surprise.
Six years of sweat and fear
That was all we ever had
It was just enough
But for what?
Fast love
Fake fucks, bad luck, and all those impossible months
The best times imagined
We were broke and dragging
Our lives behind us laughing
The youth war passing
If I knew then, what I know now
I would have slept less
No memories to be missed
Everything has changed
Now itâs a game of numbers
A competition, fucker
Know your place
Egos dominate and
Money discriminates and
I donât fit
I look at others and I see beneath
While others look my way to look down on me
I never had shit to prove
For myself to get the kids like me through
And that will never change no
Youâre the self-proclaimed heir to the industry
But this industry never meant shit to me
Youâre the self-proclaimed heir to the industry
But this industry never meant shit to me
Never blessed with the mind of a business man.
Nor impressed with the depths of the feeders hands.
Never blessed with the mind of a business man.
Mind at rest with the heart of a simple man.
I know itâs never too late
Thatâs why we choose to display
New strength
