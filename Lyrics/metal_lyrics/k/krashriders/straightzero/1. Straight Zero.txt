You aren't born for the way you choose,
Straight from zero, got nothing to loose

Don't forget â things that made you try
Be the man who never lets down

Never give up, hold until you're done
Keep the will, You are on your own,

Get the dream, hold it tight
Stretch your arm, you gotta rise

STRAIGHT from ZERO
STRAIGHT from ZERO
STRAIGHT from ZERO
STRAIGHT from ZERO

You care about â futile things of life
Whatever! You won't get out alive

Don't forget âthings that made you try
Move forward before you get down

'Cause one day somehow, you'll be out of time,
Straight to zero, to the other side

Gimme thrills, lead the fight !
Get the dream, or fall aside

STRAIGHT to ZERO
STRAIGHT to ZERO
STRAIGHT to ZERO
STRAIGHT to ZERO

Aren't born for the way you choose
Straight from zero got nothing to loose

One day somehow, you'll be out of time,
Straight to zero â¦ To the other side !
