[Bonus track]

[The Gathering cover]

I close your eyes with my mouth
Now you don't see anything
But you feel my breath all over
I can feel you too
Although I don't really know you
I don't really care
Cry with me, make my day
Tomorrow all will be gone
All the sweetness and all the fun
No, I don't wanna know...
Although I don't really know you
I don't really care
Now that you're gone I don't know
How to really feel inside
Baring the hope to see you again
I guess I never will
Now that I do really know you
Yes, I really care!
