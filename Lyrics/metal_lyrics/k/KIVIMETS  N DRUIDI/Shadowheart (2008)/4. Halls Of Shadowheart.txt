Time of the fallen has come as the darkness falls.
Beneath the earth our army dwells in the ancient halls.
Hunger for death tearing our souls apart.
Oh black blade, show us the path.

We are the ones you will obey.
We are the ones that will remain.
We will bring your doom.

Halls of Shadowheart, the temple of the flaming hatred.
Bleow the mountains, beneath the earth so dark they rise.
Nest of havoc, the fortress of hideous mind.
Once the fallen shall arise.

Shadow over (the) lands, the light fades away.
Faith and hope drowning in the pool of blood.
Army of darkness, victorious today.
Time has come for the last prayer for your god.

Fluid of life flows through your chainmail,
your weapons are useless against our might.
Lifeless corpses and blood cover the ground.
Try to yell, your throat won't make a sound.

We will bring your doom.

Shadow over (the) lands, the light fades away.
Faith and hope drowning in the pool of blood.
Army of darkness, victorious today.
Time has come for the last prayer for your god.

Through burned villages we march.
Spreading fear, leaving only death behind.
Die fighting or without, the choice is yours.
White flag won't make a difference, life denied.

Your kingdom, now slavery for my kin.
Hunger for death, still guiding our warriors.
In your halls we raise our horns for victory.
But thirst for blood, that will never go away.

We will bring your doom.

Shadow over (the) lands, the light fades away.
Faith and hope drowning in the pool of blood.
Army of darkness, victorious today.
Time has come for the last prayer for your god.
