Born under the moon of the elven goddess of battle.
Raised by the elves, the mighty dwellers of the woods.
FIRE in the heart of this divine son.
BATTLE, his destiny's to fight the evil.
Many shall be thy enemy,
and great is the danger that'll seek you.
Signs of your birth made you to be the one,
so carry your sword with honour.
For many years he fought, many years he spent in battle.
Soon was to be known the divine strength of this elven youngster.
FIRE in the heart of this divine son.
BATTLE, his destiny's to fight the evil.
Many shall be thy enemy,
and great is the danger that'll seek you.
Signs of your birth made you to be the one,
so carry your sword with honour.
All the way through the valley of the magical beasts he fought alone.
Finally he reached the dungeon of the undead wizard.
"Fear me, feel me, you can't beat me."
"I don't fear you. You'll be gone soon."
So has the last battle began.
The ending of this duel is a mystery for every one.
Never seen is the wizard nor the elven man anymore.
FIRE in the heart of this divine son.
BATTLE, his destiny's to fight the evil.
Many shall be thy enemy,
and great is the danger that'll seek you.
Signs of your birth made you to be the one,
so carry your sword with honour
