Beyond the gates of no return,
behind the curtains that will rise no more.
Lie the fields of no mortal,
the land covered by mist and darkness.

There's no twilight to show the path for the lost one,
no stars to guide his way.
This is my path, this is where I belong,
here shall I roam forevermore.

The hand that led me here,
was none else's but the one I trusted.
That trust is no more, nor it matters,
Your betrayal I will return by the hardest.

The wounds already healed, as f they never existed,
but too deep are the cuts of the blade of your betrayal.
Upon the ones you've ever known I'll lay my curse
and by the death of them I'll gain, gain my revenge.

I will gain my revenge,
Gain my revenge,
I will gain my revenge,
My revenge.

Beyond the gates of no return,
behind the curtains that will rise no more.
Lie the fields of no mortal,
the lands covered by mist and darkness.

There's no twilight to show the path for them,
no stars to guide their way.
This is now their domain (our domain),
the lands they will roam forevermore.

Under these clouds that will not fade,
in this eternal cold and silence,
beyond the gates of eternity I proudly wander
among all the ones you've ever cared for.

The wounds already healed, as if they never existed,
But too deep are the cuts of the blade of your betrayal.
Upon the ones you've ever known I'll lay my curse
and by the death of your loved ones I'll gain my...
Upon the ones you've ever known I'll lay my curse
and by the death of them I'll gain my revenge.
