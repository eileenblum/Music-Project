"Brother, oh brother! I saw such strangeness,
a man, a creature of unearthly kindness.
Of such stories he told, such places,
fates and fights and the future's dangers.."

My sister-where ever have you been
why the fever, what claim you have seen?
This is senseless, a rambling daydream,
End the riddles, keep in mind what Elders tell us!

Strange creatures fly between the world,
neither ghosts, nor mortal spirits
kind or malicious, we do not know.
Maybe this is what you witnessed.

But the hour seems unreal
He asked me to leave, he asked me to follow
with him to other fields beyond...
beyond the ones I ever will know

Stronger in these dull fields
would surely not go unnoticed.
Poor girl, you must have dreamed him
in your lonely moments.
Had you left with him, had you followed,
where would we have found you?
Fallen dead at the end...
...but with a smile on your face?

Strange creatures fly between the worlds,
neither ghosts, nor mortal spirits
kind or malicious, we do not know.
I know what I have witnessed!

But the hour seems unreal
He asked me to leave, and I will follow
with him to other fields beyond...
beyond the ones I ever will know

Come full moon, I shall leave and follow
blessed or cursed by him, true or shallow
Seeker of truth, may your courage lead me!
Bringer of light, wait for me, you light I shall see...

Cry not for me for I must go...
