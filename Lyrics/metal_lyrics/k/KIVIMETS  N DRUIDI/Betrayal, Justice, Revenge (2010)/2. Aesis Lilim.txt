Stone-white fortress of flowers of steel
ancient home it is for strangest of kin:
Silent warriors Lilim of name,
Fierce with weapons, solemn are in their faith.

All-Mother, the eldest, the wise,
Daughters, quick of hand, with steel in their eyes
Sweet Grand-daughters, to be taught the Code
Grand-Sons, in eight-of-years must go on their own

Judge not
Speak not, lest for true reason

Lie not
Deceive not
May truth alone leave your lips

Be wise
Be strong
Respect all, trust but Self

Each one
to Her own
Always keep your own counsel

Stone-white fortress of flowers of steel
ancient home is for strangest of kin:
Aesis Lilim, her path long and true
fought beside the heroes far-known and pure.

Remembering the words of All-Mother that day
when she was to be a Lily at last
"Tell us now what is to be your name
May you hold our Code pure-hearted and fast"

And always, always allow each soul to walk its own path

She is sorry for those she hurt
She regrets the ones she killed.
She is tired of being strong,
She is tired of all the fighting

Given the choice
She would not undo what She did
She would not undo what She is...
But the blade had two edges:
the one that hurt
for the one that did the hurting

Her body is broken
her spirit yearns to rest.
She is Aesis Lilim
and she is coming home.

Stone-white fortress of flowers of steel
ancient home is for strangest of kin:
Aesis Lilim, her path and hard
fought and fell in nameless battle so far.

No before me I see my journey's end
No before me lies the Reckoning Day
Aesis Lilim, this is my name
At long last I will come home to remain.
