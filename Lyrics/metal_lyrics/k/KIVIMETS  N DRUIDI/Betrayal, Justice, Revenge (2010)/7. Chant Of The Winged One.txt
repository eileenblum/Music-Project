Eternal fire inside me,
restless darkness shadowing my heart.
Claws of thousand demons,
my insides ripper apart.

I am soon to release the pain,
no sanity left to refrain the desire.
Endless whispers of the winged one,
I can't deny my lust to feed.

Free to do by their will,
Still trapped behind the mask of deceiver
in their mindless thirst for chaos.
No one can see the truth,
though would we even care?
We are to diminish 'til we are none.

The scent of your sweet flesh and blood,
ore than enough to awake the thirst.
Seek shelter and you better hide good,
there is no turning back, no hope for you.

Free to do by their will,
Still trapped behind the mask of deceiver
in their mindless thirst for chaos.
No one can see the truth,
though would we even care?
We are to diminish.

The world as you know it will be no more...
The age of the winged one shall begin.

One human, now something much more,
blessed with power and life immortal.
Kneel before me and you shall see,
your death more quick and less painful.

Free to do as they are told
still trapped in the cage of the deceiver.
In his mindless thirst for chaos.
Yes they can see the truth,
But there's little they can do.
They are to obey until they are none.
