For two long years you've been suffering
Now you've belonged to heaven
These pains and sorrow you have left
In angel's arms you are safe

I swear I'll never forget you
I'll never forget your wise counsels too

You've been with us but not for so long
Now you belonged to heaven and this song is just for you
You've been with us like just for a moment
Farewell till God bring us together again

When I am listening to country songs
Mem'ries of you will flash in my mind
"Miss you" and "love you" all I can say
You're a part of me, oh.... in my heart you'll stay

You've been with us but not for so long
Now you belonged to heaven and this song is just for you
You've been with us like just for a moment
Farewell till God bring us together again

Thank God, he set you free from misery
From touch of earthly cares you're free
In God's loving arms you'll always be

[Solo]

You've been with us but not for so long
Now you belonged to heaven and this song is just for you
You've been with us like just for a moment
Farewell till God bring us together again
