After the dawn the sun rise
My alarm wake me up, the whole night I sleep
Carried away by many dreams
Then morning came 'get back to work', a voice spoke deep within
Morning oh so bright, cool breeze blowing
Sweet songs of the birds, they light my hope my dreams

Everyday is a newday, yesterday is dead and gone
We'll start a new, we'll go on. Everything has a new beginning
Everyday is a newday, yesterday is dead and gone
Behold the future. Yeah! Let's keep going on.

The whole day has passed and gone
Now the sun is set, 'Listen to crickets' singing
For night is coming
We're called back home, around the hearth families are gathering
Darkness is reigning, a peaceful rest we make
When tom'row comes, a new journey we take

Everyday is a newday, yesterday is dead and gone
We'll start a new, we'll go on. Everything has a new beginning
Everyday is a newday, yesterday is dead and gone
Behold the future. Yeah! Let's keep going on.

[Solo]

Everyday is a newday, yesterday is dead and gone
We'll start a new, we'll go on. Everything has a new beginning
Everyday is a newday, yesterday is dead and gone
Behold the future. Yeah! Let's keep going on.
