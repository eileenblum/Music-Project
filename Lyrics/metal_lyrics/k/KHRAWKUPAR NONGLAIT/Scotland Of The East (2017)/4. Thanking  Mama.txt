Like a prodigal son, I've always made you cry
But how you have always cared and loved me I can't deny
How your ringtone wakes my 'phone whenever I'm late at night
Whenever I'm wrong, you teach me right

Thank you Mama for what you've done to me
For you are the love that can never be replaced
You've always been there whenever I needed
Thank you for lighting me up the perfect beacon, of unresolved love

Right from the cradle, you've raised me by yourself
You've been through pain and sorrow, shaping me for tomorrow
I'll never get enough to thank you, just this song I've got for you
Your love will always remind, that I'll never cross the line

Thank you Mama for what you've done to me
For you are the love that can never be replaced
You've always been there whenever I needed
Thank you for lighting me up the perfect beacon, of unresolved love

Sorry for all I've done, sorry for all imperfections
But thank's you never count 'gainst me,
That's your perfect, love I see

[Solo]

Thank you Mama for what you've done to me
For you are the love that can never be replaced
You've always been there whenever I needed
Thank you for lighting me up the perfect beacon, of unresolved love
