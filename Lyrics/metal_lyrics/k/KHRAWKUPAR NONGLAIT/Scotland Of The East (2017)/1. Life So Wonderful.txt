When we were young we're wild and free
Never bother about the future
So life means being happy
There's no such things that breed worry
It ain't easy to forget those days
Those golden years faded away

Oh life... so wonderful
Sweet memories flood my soul
Eternally it's gone
Never shall it return

As years passed by were growing old
Sweet memories of the past unfold
I wish I could again be a child
To turn back time to young and wild
But shadows are looming nearer to the grave
This life have just to accept.

Oh life... so wonderful
Sweet memories flood my soul
Eternally it's gone
Never shall it return

[Solo]

Being a child, and a youth,
Happy and free that is my world
Those days were gone, I am growing old
Life so wonderful

Oh life... so wonderful
Sweet memories flood my soul
Eternally it's gone
Never shall it return

When we were young we're wild and free
There's no such things that breed worry
