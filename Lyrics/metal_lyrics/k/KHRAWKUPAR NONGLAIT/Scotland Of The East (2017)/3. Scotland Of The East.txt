From dawn to dusk, my soul and my thought,
Wander's all around, loving they watch
In awe and wonder, so long I behold,
The rays of grandeur, with magical touch
Let thy face show, let thy heart demonstrate, thy greatness and beauty
Here you stand oh, so unique thou hast made history.

Oh lovely lovely land, mesmerising
Oh home of the God, captivating
Thy green hills and rivers, thy sweet wa'fall glow
Land of enchantment, where clouds could come home
In the blossom of the god's sweet flower bloom
From the plain of Surma across the sea,
Scotland of the east thy fame they envy

Our fore father gone, to eternity,
In thy sands of time their imprints I see
Shall their great names thus â fade to oblivion?
I made these promises â their souls be reborn
Here I do belong, here I proudly roam, forever my home
Where would on earth could I pour my heart? To the land bless by the gods.

Oh lovely lovely land, mesmerising
Oh home of the God, captivating
Thy green hills and rivers, thy sweet wa'fall glow
Land of enchantment, where clouds could come home
In the blossom of the god's sweet flower bloom
From the plain of Surma across the sea,
Scotland of the east thy fame they envy

Oh lovely lovely land, mesmerising

Land of enchantment, where clouds could come home
In the blossom of the god's sweet flower bloom
From the plain of Surma across the sea,
Scotland of the east thy fame they envy
