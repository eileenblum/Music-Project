Mask of madness
Clings so tightly
How long till the fever breaks
Pale skin and vipers blood
The disgust of man's worth

Acting fast and thinking slow
A premonition of human failure
So unaware cold eyes watching
Bath in dissolution

Lambs to slaughter
Bathe in ruin
Blinded by hesitation
44 senses scream danger
Leap of faith into a shallow grave

Never question
Never falter
Never question
Never falter

The time for fear has long since passed
Trust leads you off a cliff
A place so dark light has no meaning
Shadows beacon onward

All you knows means nothing here
Dead languages fill your thoughts
Hope died here long ago
Faith is what killed it

Splayed a spawned in another plane
Molecules divided with haste
Blackened eyes golden guts
Cower in sanity's eclipse

The blind walk amongst the dead
Path to promise paved
With deep seeded hate and ancient ignorance
