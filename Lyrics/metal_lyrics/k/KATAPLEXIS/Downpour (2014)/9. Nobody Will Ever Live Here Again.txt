Shadows of death litter these halls
No escape

Tortured souls
Foul air
A specter between planes

Pale and
Unseen
Spilled guts
Unclean

Haunted for so long
Only death may own this home
Whispers of tortured souls
I die a little every day

Death was so silent
Defiled rotten remains
The air is so stagnant
The wind ushers pain through

Brutality form long ago
Still hangs in this place
The blood has long since been cleaned
But paint won't cover a wraith
Torture echos through these halls
Now only ghosts remain

A kill site for far too long
He dragged them here to take their life away
Hundreds of violent deaths
Now hundreds of violent shades

It seems desolation will never leave this place
Bodies piled under his name
