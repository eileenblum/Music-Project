Scratching sanity
Nails torn
Voiceless

Messages seep out the walls of padded rooms
Been here for years
Water drips the same
Sinister thoughts and blackened heart
Patients come and go
But my cut throat can't be tamed

Stainless steel leather straps to hold me down
Open mouth to scream a whisper in this ghost town
Trying to swallow tongue to end this horror
Induced seizures don't stop lust for gore

Dark red
Sundress
Bleached skin
Lifeless

Blue eyes
Flicker
Until life
Leaped away

My souls as strained as the scene of the crime
Cut her for days but I kept her alive

400 volts
Electricity
Trying to purge me

Cleansing
Therapy
Dark passenger
Won't leave

I know I don't have to do this
Begging for your life won't help
I know I don't have to do this
I fucking want to

What's point of being alive?
With concrete on all sides
Why take another breath
If I can't take yours?

Punished by evil nature
This mind is a cancer
Trying exorcise the ghost
Kill the parasite kill the host

A monster lives within me
Released by true beauty
The roots of evil run deep
In a mind that never sleeps

What can't be cured
Must be endured
Acolyte
Weak of mind

Made to kill
Lidless eyes
Insomnia
No control

Scratching
Sanity
Nails torn
Voiceless
