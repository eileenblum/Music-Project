A sculpted sacred altar
A place where thoughts consume
A wish turns into ashes
My company

Is hate

This bark won't peel off my wounds
Distrust
Wall my way to suffocate

I hear the heretic calling
He carries me away
Shattered into a thousand insects
Of disbelief

This taste
Will never leave my mouth now
Suffer
While my sanity mocks me

He refused to embrace it and I struck him down
It blessed me with sight
I could not look away

Open every door
Let the light shine in
Close all contact
High council in your mind

Used to be a man with dreams
Desires and aspiration
Now all I welcome is agony
My thoughts swarm to them

The vastness of this place
A second sacred home
Make my thoughts falter
Snapped under the weight

Black light
Is the only light I can see now
Down here
Smothered with my thoughts clinging to life

I fought a thousand serpents
I tread on holy ground
My minds contamination
A sacred second home
