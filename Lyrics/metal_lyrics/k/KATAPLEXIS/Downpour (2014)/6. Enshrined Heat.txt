Keep in mind
Your dream
Means fucking nothing to me

Entry
Silent
I slip into your home

Safety
Shattered
A figure looms and waits

Tied up
Beaten
Perfect for a sacrifice

There's no fight in you
Nothing left
A shell of a man

Best years have long since passed
A lifetime wasted on a righteous path

Ambition
Crumbled
Around your
Model home

Casket
Cleansing flame
Set you
Free

That day you thought you saw God
But he wasn't looking back at you
A broken spirit from fruitless efforts
Life's worth is relative

Beast is hungry
I must feed him
Gluttony
Sacred flame

Without a face to hide behind
Embers scorch
Purify

Present the offerings and he shall devour it

Flicking flame to birth you anew
I waited so long for this
Strike the match
Burn this home

Summon him forth
Enshrined heat inferno tempts me
The blaze coaxes me away
Portal to a new life

Patiently waiting for a weakness
All contracts signed all fate is sealed

Salvation lies in immolation
Very shortly you'll see
So eager for your arrival
Do not keep him waiting

After years of putrid silence
I opened my eyes
And I was home

Refuse to carry this burden of life
A new age is dawning deliver me from filth

Tools of chaos ignorance isn't bliss
Failure results in glorious reconstruction
