Slow construction
Dooms day machine
Systematic oppression
Money's bright gleam
Gnawing gashing teeth of steel
Free market to erase free will

Pulling teeth and breaking backs
Common man grow tired while the rich grow fat
Print and print without the gold
Buried with your servants like the pharaohs of old

Pathogens created for war
Running out of oil and we'll always need more
Return to the burial site
North America ground zero for the worlds demise

Running out of room without a plan
Rescission marks the time to bite the hand
Faster stronger won't be long
Take their homes and give them bombs

Military occupation
Under flag and gun
Inferiority complex
Eyes locked on who's next

Appease the war gods
Outsource the shit jobs
Calling all allies
Scorch the Earth
Burn the skies

Fearless
Tyrant
People
Stagnant
Hopeless
Force fed

The economy is dead
Still we press military agendas

Obey
Obey

We need your fucking money
And we need your fucking sons

Obey
Obey

Swimming in debt
And basking in oppression

Obey
Obey

Never gonna stop
Till we invade the fucking sun

Obey
Obey

We're all at fault
We sit and wait
The flock won't rise up
Till we drown in the rain

Do what we want
And laugh at the U.N.

Obey
Obey

Under cloak and dagger
No weapon like distraction

Obey
Obey

Obey
Obey
OBEY
Obey
obey
obey
