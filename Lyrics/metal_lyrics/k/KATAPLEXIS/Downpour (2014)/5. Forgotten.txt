Trapped here no sunlight
Cloaked in the human failure
Break bone fever aching
No will for life

Death has no place here
Healing winds mend and warp
Lend me your sight
I cower in total blindness

Mirrors
In a pool of fear we sink alone
Absence
The war is over we are forgotten
Waiting
For a rescue that will never come

Tortured for information we don't have
Deprived of sleep and killed revived again
Constant darkness the hounds drown out our screams
I just want to die

Life please let go
