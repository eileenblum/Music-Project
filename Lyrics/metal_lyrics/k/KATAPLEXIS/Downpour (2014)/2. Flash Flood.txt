Flash backs
Night terrors
Anxiety
Flash Flood

The scars have long since healed
I lie in waste still
The monster I've become to serve
Country
Their eyes still cut with piercing intensity
To take my own life is to wash
Hands clean

A true hero scarred for life
The bodies piled under my name

Under orders but a butcher just the same

No wounds on my body
Shattered wars long ago

Dead are so silent
They welcome me home

Freedom from the living
Greatest gift I've ever received

As the tensions mounting
And the trigger so close
I often question why I held on so fucking long
