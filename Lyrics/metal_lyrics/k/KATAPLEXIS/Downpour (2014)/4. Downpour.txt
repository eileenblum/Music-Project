Poring rain has soaked her bones
Veil of fear covers her eyes
She can sense she's not alone
Cling to comforts deep inside

Makeup runs as fast as her
Her heartbeat stops time
Brain shuts down
Panic sets
Strangers disappear

Beauty
Pours out of her soaked skin
Grasping
For a hope that won't exist

Feel as though she born for this
You were made to bow
Beast of burden Roman's blood
Not meant to survive

She exists within my mind
Just a false perspective

In her
Cold gaze I no longer feel
I steal
Her thoughts for the first time
Shatter
Comfort tries to grip at life
Last breath
Exhaled to the void

Our paths will cross when light dilates
I pass you with a smile
Suffocated in the rain
A fitting cross to another plane

She breathes through me now
It burns my lungs
What have I done?
The first time is always the hardest
