The honeymoon is over
The laugh riot's done
Nobody lives here now

Remember years ago
Darkness in man shone through
Picture perfect painting of abuse

Corridors of ancient hate
Only ghosts remain
Trapped in a vow of misery

And all the pieces fit
Into broken bones
Public sickness overflows

And when enough's enough
In a fragile mind
Bodies is all you'll find

You're a waste of skin
And now a million voices curse this home
Since the day the bodies were found
A solitary man glazed frozen eye
The basement
Where so many died

Waste of skin
You're useless to him
Nothing but pain
Open your eyes

These cold concrete walls
The stench of curdled blood
The quiet orchestra
Of a thousand death rattles

He drags them into darkness for the last time
He burns their souls with apologetic eyes

You're a waste of skin
You're useless to him
Nothing but pain
Open your eyes

Down drag them down
Down drag them down
Down drag them down
Down drag them down

Stench of the bodies
Seep out over time
Over 50 corpses
And he vanished without a sign

Waste of skin
You're useless to him
Nothing but pain
Open your

Waste of skin
You're useless to him
Nothing but pain
Open your eyes

These cold concrete walls
The stench of curdled blood
The quiet orchestra
Of a thousand death rattles
