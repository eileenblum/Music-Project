Liar the word that fits 
Treachery is only a friend 
Who said I feel fine? 
Turning off ray sanity 
Hate bleeds 
Something's wrong with you 
Acting out another's needs 
Who do you think you are? 
The pain unbound pulverizes you! 

True black human 
A heart of stonecold black 
Falsified splits 
Immense decay 
Demented lust 
What kind of a fool do you take me for? 
Living in sin 
There is no conscience inside of you 

Praise! Fake! Grace! 
Rise! Rage! Hate! 

What is a lie, what is the truth? 
Explain the truth again to me 
Living by the lies 
Swallow the lies until you are dead 
I won't give into the false 
I'll bring you down to your knees 
I'll bring you to hell 
You're gonna meet your fate 
It's time to die 
There's no time for your imploring pleads 
Come to me 
Ask for help 
The words I don't understand 
All what I want is death 

Fear caught in your eyes 
Pray to live 
Do what you have been told 
Feeling fear of dying 
I've lost control of my mind 
Death is what I give 
Creature of the fie 
Burning with the flame of death blood.
