I hear your words 
Camouflage 
Promise 
Obvious resolution 
Dejected mind 
Blunt judgement 
It will make the same trust 
You resign progress 
You keep your position to degenerate a strange 
Your deeds show that you can't select common choice 
For fucking you 

I have seen a fucking foolish man 
Sadly no consideration, no deed 
It's all the same 
You are exactly the same as a clone 
Repeat the same mistake 
Selfish construction egomaniac 
Your pleasure was disturbing a stranger 
Nothing saving way for me 
Nothing worthy or saving for me 

Bring someone down of your base deed 
I have lost my hope by disallowing deeds 
You don't have too much 
Trust in your power to find out 
You are going to find a mere chance to stalk me 
Your web of lies 
Anyway you look it there's nowhere to run 

Your web of lies 
It is getting to the point where you shall die 
With my hatred and your remorse 
You are caught in a trap 
Nobody can escape your web of lies
