Dark side prisoner 
You have no alternative 
Be obsessed by a delusion 
Intending to kill 
Infant terrible 
Someone's fate's changing 
Reality is all over again 
Without fail 
Have something inside the brain 

Be stained with bloodlust 
Lost of humanity 
Distorted greed unbound 
Destroying the human heart 
Start a chain reaction 
Slaughtered in vein 
Eyes that bleed 
The reaper manipulates your mind 
Bringing you to your death 

Tear you down! 
Feel the deadly cold 
Shame on you! 
The helpless minds of you 
Deep inside of you! 
Devils that drive you 
Losing your mind! 
The last thing you'll see: 
Hell! Grave! 

In human violence 
Looking for sacrifice 
Straight out of hell 
Prevail your life 
You were way out of line 
Covering the truth 
I can't believe my eyes 
Without fail 
Have something inside the brain
