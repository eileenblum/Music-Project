I can't struggle and feel the pain 
Only looking at death 
Keep down 
Change desire for desperation 
All thoughts going to waste 
Never feeling the pain 
Seeing things in agony 
Deep inside of me 

Unclear to others 
Endless sorrow and pain 
Mean and infectious 
About to explode 
For my own peace of mind 
Stealing your souls 
Get ready for the pain 
I smell of death 

Darkness lies over me 
Reality turning to hell 
Everytime 1 think of you 
A soul that will never rest 
No sights 
No mercy 
No warning 
No feeling 
Invading my brain 
Keep driving my thoughts to the killing 

Delete screams (Bring your death) Shadow of fear 
Endless screams (Pray for death) Never feel death 
Delete screams (Bring your death) Shadow of fear 
Endless scream (Pray for death) Ever the feel the hate

You will die 
You soul in black 
In my head I hear you cry 
Outbreak 
Hate 
Pray for life 
You mutilated soul 
You dream of death 
You face the dead 
Scream for me 
Without pain I watch you die 
No right to live 
Wishing for death 
Blind inside 
I reek of hate 

You'll see hell 
Repeating thoughts of lies 
I'm waiting for the day you are dead 
There is nothing more for me to say 
I fight hard 
In a world that feeds on hate
