Reigns Insanity Spilling Killing all in sight 
Bloodstains on my hands 
Broken body in a wreck 
Frantic minds fight for possession 
Magnifying the power 
The world is rough 
The end is near 
Desperation's all around 

Blood runs everywhere 
Screaming for your life 
Death is the fate 
In fife and death we deal 
I will never die 
Violence 
Misery 
Engaged in war 
Fight on, but what's to gain? 
Vulgar 
Parasite 
Artificial peace 
Corroding from inside 
Through the endless desperation 
Where you'll live your last 
Don't need to hear the truth 
I know what to do 

Not for the power 
Not for the fame 
Down on myself 
Hold fast to your faith 

Screams so loud 
Struggle to survive 
A deadly scream 
Run for your life 
A state of mind 
I taste the fear 
Living on the edge 
All your life
