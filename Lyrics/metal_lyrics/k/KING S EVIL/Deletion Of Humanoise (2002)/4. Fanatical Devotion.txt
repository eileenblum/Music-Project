Worship of god 
No zest for me 
No mind to find out 
Seeing through you 
Hoping to be a spurious god 
Make a cat's paw of me 
No agreeing No defeat 
Fed up with your talk 
It's absurd trying to obey 
Bloodshot eyes with insanity 
Noways of judging 
No sense of right and wrong 

You make a mess of my creation 
Caused by a cowardly act 
Get out! 
Distaste! 
No need for me 
You attract the attention of a man 
Make use of groundless words 
Groundless words! 
You tread down my good wishes 
You try to play tricks on me. 
Get out! 
Distaste! 
We're you grown to be a god? 
You're watching yourself in the looking glass 
You seem to be mad 
Reflection in the mirror 

Excess mind! 
It's your limit! 
There's no future! 
Take displeasure! 
Discontinuity! 
Lose your mind! 
Self-destruction! 
Never come to me! 
Die out! 

Mad faith maniac 
Over the grasp 
Getting around in the darkness 
No eyes 
No thoughts 
Showing ass in my field 
Mastery offering me a light 
Rotten to the core 
From the inside are you 
Hard of revising for you 
You don't see around 
You turn a deaf ear 
You'll see that nothing can be done 

Your behaviour brings disgrace to my way 
Sacrifice me for the benefit 
Get out! 
Distaste! 
No need for me 
You are left behind with infirmity 
You are left behind with a gloomy hope 
Take it for granted 
You bring me on 
Lost emotions revive 
I decided on a course of action 
Raging! 
Hatred! 
Pay your tribute of praise 
You don't turn away your eyes 
Find the solution from the eager world 

Excess mind! 
It's your limit! 
There's no future! 
Take displeasure! 
Discontinuity! 
Lose your mind! 
Self-destruction! 
Never come to me! 
Die out! 
You make a mess of my creation 
Caused by a cowardly act 
Get out! 
Distaste! 

No need for me 
You attract the attention of a man 
Make use of groundless words 
Groundless words! 
You tread down my good wishes 
You try to play tricks on me 
Get out! 
Distaste! 
We're you grown to be a god? 
You're watching yourself in the looking glass 
You seem to be mad 
Reflection in the mirror 
You are dregs 
Brainless 
You die 
You are the worm 
Black-minded 
You'll vanish
