Dark 
Blind 
The evil lives in your mind 
Erase 
Faith 
Never trust in you 
Abuse 
Stain 
The fucking ways you deceive me 
Doom 
Disorder 
Terrible disaster to you 

Killing off my soul 
You torture me 
Killing off my soul 
You deceive me 
See the truth and see your lies 
You must be mad 
Selfish ways to bring you down 
Death has come for you 

Cry with you desperation 
(Laughing at your desperation) 
God gave you termination 
(Awaken to your manipulation) 
The flesh and spirit elimination 
(Attacked by my hallucination) 
Wishing for your ruination 
(Arrive at my destination) 

Demon 
Insane 
Mind 
Torture for evil 
Enemy 
Reject 
Testify against me 
Abject 
Desire 
The end justifies the means 
Dust 
Inflame 
Alive to your own interests 

Killing off my soul 
You torture me 
Killing off my soul 
You deceive me 
See the truth and see your lies 
You must be mad 
Selfish ways to bring you down 
Death has come for you 

Cry with you desperation 
(Laughing at your desperation) 
God gave you termination 
(Awaken to your manipulation) 
The flesh and spirit elimination 
(Attacked by my hallucination) 
Wishing for your ruination 
(Arrive at my destination) 

Fall from grace (Resist) 
Morbid minds (Despite) 
All mean tricks 
Forlorn hope 
See through you 
Mindless fools 
(Exile) 
I see red 
(Exist) 
Need to kill 
Needless human beings 
It's in vain 
(Resist) 
Tell a lie 
(Despite) 
Keep up the show 
You're making for excuse 
Victim of justice (Exile) 
Corrupting the time (Exist) 
A nest of wrong 
Change of the insane world 

Eyes of the greed 
Green with fear 
Screams of pain 
I'm killing you
