Vain 
Shining faint light in the dark only for myself 
Curse 
Without a shame in your vicious mind 
Light my fuse 
Pride 
The craving never seems to go away 
You're gonna see 
Faith 
You look down around all the humans 
At all times 

All sensation of feeling 
Beyond my imagination 
My emotion treads down 
Without minding about me 
Deceptive shape 
Can't bear the sight of you 
Most needless type for me 
For progress of my way 
It's you 

False pride... 

Defect 
Living inside of you 
Infectin Waste 
Putrid blood Infecting me 
Thinking down to your level 
Blind 
Ruling my brain 
Ripping my soul 
Out of my way 
Blood 
The sights of you 
The thoughts of you 

All sensation of feeling 
Beyond my imagination 
My emotion treads down 
Without minding about me 
Deceptive shape 
Can't bear the sight of you 
Most needless type for me 
For progress of my way It's you
