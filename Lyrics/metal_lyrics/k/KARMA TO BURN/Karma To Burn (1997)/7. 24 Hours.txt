[Joy Division Cover]

So this is permanent
Love's shackled cry
What once was innocent
Turned on its side

A cloud hangs over me
Marks every move
Deep in the memory
What once was love

Oh how I've realised
How I wanted time
Thought it too protective
Tried so hard to find

Just for one moment
Thought I'd found my way
Destiny unfolded
I watched it slip away

Excessive flashpoints
Beyond our reach
Solitary demands for
All I'd like to keep

Let's take a ride out
See what we can find
My newest collections of
Hopes and passing times

I never realised
The lengths I'd have to go,
All the darkest corners of
A sense I didn't know
Just for one moment
I heard somebody call
Looked beyond the day
And there's nothing there at all

Now that I've realised
How it's all gone wrong
Gotta find some therapy
This treatment takes too long

Deep in the heart of
Where sympathy felt swayed
I got to find my destiny
Before it gets too late
