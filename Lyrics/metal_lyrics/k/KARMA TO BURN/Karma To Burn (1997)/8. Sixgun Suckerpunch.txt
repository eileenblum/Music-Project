A pale, haunted man
Walks through this crowded land
He holds his gun like a girl
Teared down this last stand
Choking on spit and lead
He wants his women to scream

The lights shudder, reach you motherfucker
The lights shudder, reach you motherfucking clown

You're not alone, man
Cause when you die it's like, like falling asleep
Only you never dream and you don't ever wake up
I only strip the bleeding
