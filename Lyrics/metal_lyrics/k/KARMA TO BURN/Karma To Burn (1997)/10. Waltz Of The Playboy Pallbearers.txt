Why do I borrow, Cecile my dear?
Battling with no-one, you'll have to kill
Why don't you kneel? I never will
Now that I'm missing your backpack still

Just hang on, while the sun still shines, on and on

Am I in your gutter to sell all my fears?
I'd like everything I came here to steal

Just hang on, while the sun still shines, on and on

Last time you borrowed seems all too real
To suck on reality until you bleed

Take all you can swallow, Cecile my dear
This is your home to show to ever leave here
