Another winter has past and gone
All his desires still remained
Having God on the run
Another winter's on it's way

They like to suck the dead to life
Smell the rot inside
Hearts, hands, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes

Too many people have lost their souls
Damned to a life of decay
Been a lover for far too long
Without the power to refrain
