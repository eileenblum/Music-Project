Our lady of more [Repeat]

Our lady of more, this saddened whore
How I adore her, when she's on the floor

Lonely love is blind to ashes
Lonely love is blind
Lonely love is blind to ashes
Lonely love unwinds

She's like the twilight, their needle sings [?]
Skin of the mayflower, a pale reflection brings
