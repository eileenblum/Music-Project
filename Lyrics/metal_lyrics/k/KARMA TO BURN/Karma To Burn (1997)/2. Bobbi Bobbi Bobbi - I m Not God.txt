Down to the flower, down in the dirt
A girl named Bobbi, washes her hurt
Her momma kneels down, [?]
[?]

Don't buy any longer
Dont buy any more

Under the stone lies Daddy's head
Under the stone, in the cold, to the shade
Fellow died burnt from the sun
Dried for days and had never begone

Daddy, do you like me? (Do you like me?)
Ever get with me?
Daddy, do you like it? (Do you like it?)
Take it on your knees (knees)
