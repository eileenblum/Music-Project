I look forward to my death
Excitement has me short of breath
Catholics have me mystified
When they're good, they're afraid to die

Laughing at the law, the brothers say you like to get high
Mother said "You're gone", tripping on the fourth of July

When Lazarus died Jesus went
To read up on his faith in death
Bridge of souls that beg the rest
To build this dream they must invest
