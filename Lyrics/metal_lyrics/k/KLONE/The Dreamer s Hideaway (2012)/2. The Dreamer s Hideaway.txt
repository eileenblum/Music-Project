I need to keep walking
Walking and never stop
My craving is waking up till it dies once more

There's only one place
Where I can lose myself
I need to go astray
To the dreamer's hideaway

And I'm still suspended
Like a neutral species
From the possible to the real

Nothing to keep me on the ground
That's why I'm here
That's why

There's only one place
Where I can lose myself
I need to go astray
To the dreamer's hideaway


My first step down
Makes me realize I'm here
The first step down
It's not an ordinary place

Nothing to keep me on the ground
I'm fully suspended
Nothing to keep my longing down
In the wake of my need

A world to see with blinding light

Walk and never stop
Never
Till my heart falls to the floor

There's only one place
Where I lose myself
So lead me astray
To the dreamer's hideaway
