Take off through the rocket smoke
The greatest of my dreamy load

Crossing a blood red sky streaked with dust
Between the shooting stars
I'm ready to rush
Fuel my elation under a meteor shower
Our climax closer to a burning sun

Let's go higher to shine
The greatest of my dreamy load
Soaring over a starry field
Let's go higher to shine
And take off through the rocket smoke
Laying beyond the stratosphere

Leave the ground till we probe
The depths of our yearning
We're only passenger
To the far side of the time
Spreading straight up
No return to the earth
Slicing the air Burning fast Fire lines

Let's go higher to shine
The greatest of my dreamy load
Soaring over a starry field
Let's go higher to shine
And take off through the rocket smoke
Laying beyond the stratosphere

Leave the ground till we probe
The depths of our yearning
We're only passenger
To the far side of the time

Soaring over a starry field
And laying beyond the stratosphere

Let's go higher to shine
The greatest of my dreamy load
Soaring over a starry field
Let's go higher to shine
And take off through the rocket smoke
Laying beyond the stratosphere
