[feat. Dug From King's X]Come to life
Make stories come alive
You're only a vibration
Just a friction in the air

Go ahead
It's time for you to play
A craving runs to you
Cause you're a friction in the air

Ride the rythm flow
Let the music sound
All over the road
The march is on

Raise your voice
Embrace the sound of noise
Let yourself be carried away
By this slow and massive wave

Come and sing
Dance on the groove machine
A strong pulse in your hands
Like a slow and massive wave

Ride the rythm flow
Let the music sound
All over the road
The march is on

Shape the melody suiting your moods
Shape the melody suiting your groove
One finger snaps
A strong pulse from the inside
A friction in the air
Has come to life
Let the music sound
Make stories come alive
Make and come alive

Ride the rythm flow

Let the music sound

All over the road

The march is on
