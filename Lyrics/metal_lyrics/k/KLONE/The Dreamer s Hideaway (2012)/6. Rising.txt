Not one day
Goes without leaving trace
Save my screams
It's time to let the monster rise

Hell is not real
Feel the fire in your hands
Feed my flames
This strong core inside me

From the illusion to reality
Bring to light what can only be seen at night
And back from the brink

Die to be reborn once again
Tirelessly
Rise from the ashes

Crawl under my skin
Keep me wild
In metamorphosis
I feel the monster rise

Strangely sealed in a violent grace
It's a new beginning

Die to be reborn once again
Tirelessly
Rise from the ashes
From the illusion to reality
Tirelessly
And back from the brink

Crawl under my skin
Keep me wild
In metamorphosis
I feel the monster rise

Hell is not real
Feel the fire in your hands
Feed my flames
This strong core inside me

Crawl under my skin
Keep me wild

Not one day
Goes without leaving trace
Save my screams
It's time to let the monster rise
