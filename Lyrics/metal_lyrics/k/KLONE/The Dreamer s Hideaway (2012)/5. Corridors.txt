Here I am
A slave of a new disorder
Trapped inside a labyrinth
Condemned to wander among my worst fears
Anywhere
There's nothing without solution
Still I've to discover mine
Looking forward to my resurrection

Hear the crying corridors
The secret of whispering walls

I'm awake
Pain makes me aware I'm alive
Reminds me of my condition
Am I a prisoner of this universe
Every night
I dream of a well of light
Clarifying my gloomy hope
Revealing the path of my own fight

Hear the crying corridors
The secret of whispering walls
Here I am

Never ending loop
I am the target
I must reach the center
It's my only way

Condemned to wander among my worst fears

Here I am
A slave of a new disorder
Trapped inside a labyrinth
Condemned to wander among my worst fears

Hear the crying corridors
The secret of whispering walls
Never ending loop
I am the target
I must reach the center
It's my only way
