The memories take up space
They're boundless
Sometimes I invoke them for tomorrow
And this solar eclipse freezes my open eyes
No detail is insignificant

Always on the run
I run alongside
Am I a free electron
When you are on my ride

There are no rules to defy the gravity law
Rooted in the moment I'm made of steam and smoke
I feel like a giant freed of his weight
Ready to rope the moon
In absolute control

Broken reality
I'm high in the air
Am I a free electron
When you are on my ride

In absolute control
Deeper in my thoughts
No detail is insignificant
I can hear the inaudible

Rooted in the moment I'm made of steam and smoke
There are no rules to defy the gravity laws
Take shape against the current
With the smile of the wind
Then I am free among the big black clouds
Even deeper in my own thoughts
Buried in a perceptible amnesia
No gravity laws

Among the big black clouds
Rooted in the moment I'm made of steam and smoke

Take shape against the current
With the smile of the wind
Then I am free
Even deeper in my own thoughts
Buried in a perceptible amnesia

Always on the run
I run alongside
Am I a free electron
When you are on my ride
