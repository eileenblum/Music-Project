Lost in the middle of nowhere
Drifting in an ocean of tears
Some rocks appear at the surface
And voices call me from the abyss

I can't resist to this delight
The taste of your deadly kiss
The water's so bright I surrender
Profoundly into the night
With the siren's song

Lost in your kingdom
Where tales become true
A fate prey to your divine beauty
Then you consume me
Beneath the surface
You entice me with you bewitching might

I can't resist to this delight
The taste of your deadly kiss
The water's so bright I surrender
Profoundly into the night
With the siren's song

When stories turn to life

Here I am in paradise
A prey to your sacrifice
The water is so bright
You entice me with you bewitching might

Here I am in paradise
A prey to your sacrifice
When stories turn to life
I'll give myself to you entirely

Lost in the middle of nowhere
Profoundly into the night

I can't resist to this delight
The taste of your deadly kiss
The water's so bright I surrender
Profoundly into the night
With the siren's song
