Thin lines circle slowly
Endless cycles collide
Bodies melt in twisting
Set your mind in motion

Lava flows in your veins
One eye in the spiral
The essential is invisible
The superficial too
A body in eruption
Hostile deep and sad
You're my edible poison
A shiver down my spine

Come and dance for me
Dance
Until you fill the space

A constant temptation
On the edge of a fall
It's time to feed your addiction
In your search for the void
The twisting of your flesh
Contortion of the mind
Face the fear to feel what's fake
And walk on the wire

Come on and dance for me
Dance
Until you fill the space

Thin lines circle slowly
Endless cycles collide
Bodies melt in twisting
Set your mind in motion

Come and dance for me
Dance
Until you fill the space
Hope will crystallize
Dance
Until you feel the space
