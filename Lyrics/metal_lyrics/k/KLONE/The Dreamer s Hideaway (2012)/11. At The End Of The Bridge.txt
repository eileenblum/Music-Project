The days are numbered
Drop by drop
Always different
But so similar

Some birds remain
Waiting for the rest
Everything doesn't happen by chance

It's another world
Where silence is word
And the freedom is free
At the end of the bridge

Hit
Move the lines
To draw your landscape
It's time for you to join me on the other side

It's another world
Where silence is word
And the freedom is free
This world will be exactly
As you want it to be
At the end of the bridge

Hit
Move the lines
To draw your landscape
It's time for you to join me on the other side

It's another world
Where silence is word
And the freedom is free
This world will be exactly
As you want it to be
At the end of the bridge

The truth will be what you make it to be
