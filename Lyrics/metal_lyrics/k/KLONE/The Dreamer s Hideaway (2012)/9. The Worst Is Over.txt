Back to stay
Back to remain
Back to feed on this sweet and common state
The worst is over
The best is yet to come
Today nothing will ever be the same

I've nothing to do outside

Back to freeze myself in this trip
Back to unravel my own mysteries
The worst is over
The best is yet to come
Today nothing will ever be the same

I feel so complete
On the edge of fullness
From the land of living
I make up for lost time

Today nothing will ever be the same
Connected

Dismantling the structure of my harmony

Today nothing will ever be the same
Connected

Deep in the pleasure of feeling sad
Nestling in an emotional pit
An indestructible happiness
I've nothing to do outside
Deep in the pleasure of feeling sad
I've nothing to do outside

From the land of living
I make up for lost time
