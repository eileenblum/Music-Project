And if we devour each other?
To give rise to many landscapes
We feel like foreign bodies
The torn flesh forever

Nightfall on the eye of needle
And now we feel like foreign bodies

You seem different when I dream
Nobody may  knowâ¦
whatâs our destiny?
The hole is now gaping
And nothing can prevent
us from crossing
We are and we'll stay without fearâ¦

And if we swallow each other
To digest our mistakes
Like a snake under my skin
The torn flesh forever

Nightfall on the eye of needle
And now we are like foreign bodies
The bright stars appear in the sky
Something that we canât imagine

â¦(and) deeper inside
Something
We canât imagine

Give me something that seems real to you
Something that keeps our story up
Do you  think I am innocent when you dream?

Nightfall on the eye of needle
And then weâll rot like dying bodies
The bright stars appear in the sky
Something that we canât imagine

â¦(and) deeper inside
Something
We can't imagine
Give me something that seems real to you
Something that keeps our story up
Do you  think I am innocent when you dream?
