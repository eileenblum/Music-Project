I can't wait to find some explanations
I have to go back to where I came
Should I fight against my new condition?
Leaving this place could be my solution

All seem so far away from me now
What does separate me from you?
I can feel (the) time slowing down
The descent is gonna be longer

[Refrain:]
We are forgotten among the zombies
Can we keep on living in this illusion
We are forgotten among the zombies
Can we keep on living

Please help me ton find my own direction
I can go back to where I came
Give me everything you've got
Give it to me give me
Give it to me
Even what you 'll never get

I feel so far away from you now
Why canât I be closer to you?
I can feel (the) time coming down
The descent is gonna be longer

[Refrain:]
We are forgotten among the zombies
Can we keep on living in this illusion
We are forgotten among the zombies
Can we keep on living in this illusion

Iâm still hungry for your flesh
The best I hope for, is wasted away

I feel so far away from you now
Why canât I be closer to you?
I can feel (the) time coming down

And I realize
Iâm still hungry for you
The best I hope for, is wasted awayi

I forgot the place Iâm from
and the time is slowing down
A painting appears to us
a landscape weâve never imagine
We are forgotten among the zombies
Can we keep on living in this illusion
