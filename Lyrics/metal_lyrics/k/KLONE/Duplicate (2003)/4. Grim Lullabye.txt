I call you in the dead of night again
Youâre alone, angel in a cage
Vulnerable, horrified
As the rain lashes at your windowpane

Turned your back
Walked away from me
Broke my heart into pieces

Can you hear me ? Iâm watching you
Lurking in the dark
You canât hide, donât you run
I am to come out into the open

You seem like a veal
Screaming its lungs out
In the corridor
Of a slaughterhouse

Turned your back
Walked away from me
Broke my heart into pieces
(open sore bleeding sorrow)

Tonight, in a last embrace
Iâll stretch you out on a slab
I will take one last chance
Letâs share one last dance

Turned your back
Walked away from me
Broke my heart into pieces
(open sore bleeding sorrow)

Can you hear me ? I am watching youâ¦
