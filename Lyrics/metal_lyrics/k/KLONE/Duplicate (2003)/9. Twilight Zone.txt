Have you ever wondered
What's behind the mirror ?
Behind your reflection
A parallel dimension
Who's the man in front of you ?
Is it you or your clone ?
Is he real ? Is he fake ?
Are you ready to break.break the glass ?

Expect the unexpected (You know you really got to.)

It's way too late
You're way too far
You know too much
To back up and shut the door
You need to know
And you wanna see
But nothing's for free

So here you are
Face to face with yourself
Step off the line
Keep your eyes open wide
And prepare for the show
You're the one who's inside the light

Expect the unexpected (You know you really got to.)

It's way too late
You're way too far
You know too much
To back up and shut the door
You need to know
And you wanna see
But nothing's for free
