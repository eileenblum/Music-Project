Chaos in my sight
I alone witness of the process
Mass production of humanoid clones
Faces without identity
Living proofs of human inanity
Self-inflicted pain of a reckless society
Strangling itself
Putting its head in the noose
The countdown is on

No senses
No feelings
Nameless, faceless ghosts
Am I the next ?

Blessed are the blind

Spreading infection
The reign of duplication
Aftermath of DNA manipulation
Breeding replicas
Xeroxed, copied
Conformity is the way to evolution
It makes me sick
It makes me sick
I wish I was blind

Can't you see
We're heading straight
For disaster
Condemned like dominoes on the fall
And you are the next

Blessed are the blind
