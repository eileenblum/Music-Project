Here I suffocate
And I got to escape
My chances are faint
To survive in this place
I donât belong here
Got to find a way
To evacuate before I fadeâ¦
Awayâ¦

I donât belong here
Help me escape
Away from here
Take me away

Here I suffocate
And I got to escape
My chances are faint
To survive in this place
I donât belong here
Got to find a way
To evacuate before I fade away
Gotta get away
Itâs now or never
Take me with you
Take me awayâ¦

I donât belong here
Help me escape
Away from here
Take me away

Youâre my last resort, my last solution
My last recourse, my salvation
Take my hand across this land of desolation

Awayâ¦take me awayâ¦
