I invite you to share
The benefits of a community
In which everything may seem to be perfect
To join us, you only got to accept
That we wash your brain

Look at you
Thatâs what youâve become
You no longer exist, now you can see through my eyes

I have made you my pets
Surrendering to every single word I say
I feed on the weakness of your awareness
And then stab you in the backâ¦Poisonâ em

Look at you
Thatâs what youâve become
You no longer exist, now you can see through my eyes

I help you to regress
You owe me respect
The confusion of your fascination makes you deny progress
Slaughter of the enemies of truth
Letâs leave parasites behind
To eventually find peace
Behind reason looms insanity
As the curtain falls with your illusion
Let the pain fade away
Letâs Armageddon come
(Comeâ¦comingâ¦itâs coming)

Now you can see through my eyes

Look at you
Thatâs what youâve become
You no longer exist, now you can see through my eyes
