I wonât break, I wonât bend, I wonât bowâ¦never
I wonât yield, I wonât kneel, Iâll stand stillâ¦forever

Iâm not afraid to die
I hold my head up high
As you twist the knife in the woundâ¦

Iâm left to my own devices
And to my torturerâs vices
God wonât save me nowâ¦

Crucify me
Nailed to the cross
I wonât beg for mercyâ¦

Break my bones
Burn my eyes
Scare my skin
My soul will overcomeâ¦

My heartbeat
Strikes my timples
Like no bullet woundâ¦

The movie of my life
Passes before my eyes
As my forces leave meâ¦

Still I hold on tight
Donât give up the fight
I know freedom will comeâ¦

Break my bones
Burn my eyes
Scare my skin
My soul will overcomeâ¦

The downward spiral of pain
Cracks open under me
I clench my teeth, I clench my fists
Before I breathe my last

I wonât break, I wonât bend, I wonât bowâ¦never
I wonât yield, I wonât kneel, Iâll stand stillâ¦forever

I wonât break, I wonât bend, I wonât bowâ¦never

I wonât yield, I wonât kneel, Iâll stand stillâ¦forever

I wonât break, I wonât bend, I wonât bowâ¦never
I wonât yield, I wonât kneel, Iâll stand stillâ¦forever
