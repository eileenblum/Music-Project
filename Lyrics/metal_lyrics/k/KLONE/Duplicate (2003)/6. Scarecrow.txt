Bound and gagged
Blindfolded
Tortured and
So abused
Paralyzed
Mesmerized
Tied up in barbwire

My pride
Integrity
Self esteem
Sanity
Ripped apart
Scared for life
These wounds will not heal

You made me your fucking scapegoat
Iâll become your scarecrow

Submitted
But conscious
I swallowed
My anger
As you raped
My innocence
âTill I broke the leach

Nothing
Can ease
My pain
Now I âve
Found my
Antidote
You will taste my poison

You made me your fucking scapegoat
Iâll become your scarecrow

Iâm no longer your fucking slaveâ¦you see
The puppet has grown up
The strings are goneâ¦Iâm free
You ainât shit to me
You always used to be
(nâ) I spit on your name
(nâ) Iâll piss on your grave

Rage
Revenge
Punishment

(Iâll become your scarecrow)
