Sweet immersion
Slowly inside
Deeply to feel this matter
This core is alive
Hand me some space
Hand me some time
To deal with the end
The eyes open wide

Free your inner landscape
Draw me your most perfect line
And join me in this resistance
Ignore the walking shade
Speak your mind and keep the light
To feed our same peaceful strength
