Like a game
Nothing's what it seems
So you can share your illicit dreams
Everybody will think you're insane

But now you don't care about it
You don't feel the need to explain yourself
And the words fade into the fog
Between you and them

Hear them pray
Wash away all sins
They sing for you
Impure beast
The only thing to fear
A foreign sign

But now you don't care about it
You don't feel the need to explain yourself
And the words fade into the fog
Between you and them

Like a game
Nothing's what it seems
So you can share your illicit dreams
Everybody will think you're insane
You don't care about it

You don't care about it
