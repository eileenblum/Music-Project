You're the only one
Who can save what remains
Give us one more sign
You're the only one
Who cannot be insane
Watching through your eyes

Turn the night into day
Hear our echoes
You must give yourself away
To leave us and go

All is coming true
Nothing cannot be lost

Come to our rescue
Come to deliver us

Turn the night into day
Hear our echoes
You must give yourself away
To leave us and go

You're the only one
Who can save what remains
Watching through you eyes
We can all see the main

Turn the night into day
Hear our echoes
You must give yourself away
To leave us and go

You're the only one
Who can save what remains
Give us one more sign
