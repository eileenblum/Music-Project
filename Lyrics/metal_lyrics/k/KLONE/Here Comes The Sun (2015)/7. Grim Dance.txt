Enslaved in their grim dance
A disturbing game
They've chosen you as a perfect prey
This wind full of voices
Stifling your cries
The concealed poison begins to to take life

You will always be by their side
As an eternal passenger
Here you are this ghost that they've taken control of

Oyu complete soul
Your fertile mind
Condemened to sate their appetite
And there's no silver linig
The time of a fleeting shadow
They will trap your memories in a cracking cold

You will always be by their side
As an eternal passenger
Here you are this ghost that they've taken control of

They will trap your memories in a cracking cold
They will trap your memories in a cracking cold

You will always be by their side
As an eternal passenger
Here you are this ghost that they've taken control of
