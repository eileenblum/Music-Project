An amazing place
A sound engraved in stone
Hear the right tone
And let it go in space

Getting into the stride
One lasting moment with the clouds
Enjoying the elements
From the wilderness into shade and light

Leave well enough alone
Comforted by this silence
A place that will forever
Be etched in my remembrance

A wandering mind
Walking among mirages
On a reverse sky the boiling horizon
Forgetting how the world was so loud

Leave well enough alone
Comforted by this silence
A place that will forever
Be etched in my remembrance

Leave well enough alone
Comforted by this silence
A place that will forever
Be etched in my remembrance
