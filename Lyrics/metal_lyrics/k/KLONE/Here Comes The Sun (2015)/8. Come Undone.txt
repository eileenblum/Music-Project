Lost in contemplation
Facing up to a static light
The indefinable cannot be tamed
A new world is coming
Soaking up what you require
You watch all around as far as the eye can see

You wish it would never end
As a trail of delight
You wish it would never end
As if it were the first time

Thin particles
Rain and slide on your skin
In a blink of an eye
A constant enjoyable state
In your inner perception
Deeply extracting the feeling of being alive

You wish it would never end
As a trail of delight
You wish it would never end

Everything comes undone
Even if everything has to be redone
Even if some things are left to understand
You know your life is a circle wtih an end

You wish it would never end
As a trail of delight
You wish it would never end
As if it were the first time
