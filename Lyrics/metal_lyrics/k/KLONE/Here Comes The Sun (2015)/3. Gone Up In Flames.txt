he wakes up wondering
if he's touching the ground
here some wilted flowers
show him the long time elapsed
and his body complains
he feels weaked and tired
he just need to find the strength
to see what's outside
the empty corridors filled by absorbed silence
only the glass is crying under every step

all he could remember went up in flames
everything is gone without leaving trace

the daylight disappears and reveals the blending of the night
a long incessant ballet takes slowly place until sunrise
the he says he has to enshrine these memories
not to forget this time and fight the fear of falling asleep
