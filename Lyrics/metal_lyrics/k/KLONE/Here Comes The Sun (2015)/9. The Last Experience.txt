The journey ends
Slowly in silence
Everyone is ready
For the last experience

We're intimately tied
Cause there's no place to hide
Each one's keeping his secret
Staring into space

Only memories survive
To tame our enslaved minds
It's our last destination
At the dawn of a transition

We dream of safe places to be
But hopes are gone there's no light we can see
And now we've never been so close
To being only the same walking shadows
