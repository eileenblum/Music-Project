The yearning for flesh
Obsessed my brain
Extermination my only aim
Spilling blood
Carnal lusts
Screaming victims
Grinded to dust
Crushing the skulls of my enemies
Slashing their throats and make them
bleed
Abominations to mankind
Pleasures to me
Agony
Unsilent screams
Horrible dismemberment
Twitching bodies
Streamed with blood
Shattered bones
Left to rot
Credulous
My chosen ones
All they are
Condemned to die
Ripping flesh in ecstasy
Blood thirst
It's a part of me
Violence without boundaries
Desecration
Piece by piece
Slaughter takes no end
As my axe continues to hack
Decomposing
Mutilating
Helpless victims
Hung dead bleeding
Perverse with the dead
Feasting on their flesh
Fulfilment
Though murder
