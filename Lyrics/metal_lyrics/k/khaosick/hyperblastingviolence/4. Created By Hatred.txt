I am the master
For all the elder gods
Legions crush Jehovah
Chaos - marching on
Destroy all that is holy
Raping souls of Christ
Prepare for final judgement
Infant-sacrifice
Perish in flames
The god of gods awaits
Descent into the abyss
Where the blood forever rains
Killing fields, rotting corpses
Darkness spreads its wings as the realm
Of madness dominates

I am - the dark
The blackness, maze and dusk
I am - the lord
Of chaos and eternal night
I am - the lurker
Who brings you illusions and lies?
I am - infernal
Raping the souls of the dead
Raping the souls of the dead!
Blackened skies
Screams of anguish all around
Destroy the whole humanity
Descend into - the realm of death
Apocalypse
Blood fills the air
The holiness is burnt
Shades of chaos everywhere
No salvation
No prayers needed
For I'm your god
The lord who gives you life
And who takes it away
Created to burn stupidity
Created by hatred
Fuck!!!
