Manhunt
For thrill
Driven
To kill
Blood red
Portraits
Putrefied
Remains

[Chorus:]
Defleshed
Wade through blood-Intense
Defleshed
Psychopathic sense
Corpses
Coldness
Stabbing
In trance
Anguish
Torture
Malice
Slaughter

[Repeat chorus]

[Bridge:]
Ripping out the guts
To satisfy my lust
Capturing a corpse
Is in what I trust

[Repeat 1st verse]

[Repeat chorus]

[Repeat bridge]
