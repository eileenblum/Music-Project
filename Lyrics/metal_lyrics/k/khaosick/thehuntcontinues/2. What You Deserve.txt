[Chorus:]
Unfounded peace
Inside my mind
Pain's haunting me -
My knife shines bright
There is no reason
To be false
A descent into hell -
This is what you deserve
Tribulation
Pure hate is born
Panic strucks -
Your blood flows free
Horror comes straight
As you meet my blade
Pain is what you await -
This is what you deserve
I see through
Perfect facade
No morality
Just betrayal and your wicked lies
Only death is real
Soon you will believe
Memories -
Pain of day -
Victim of delusion
Scream for me!!

[Repeat chorus]

[Bridge:]
It's so nice
To hear you cry
Join the dead
No compromise
Coursing to death
Banished out of life
Realize -
There is
A time to
Die
Life is flowing away...

[Repeat chorus]
