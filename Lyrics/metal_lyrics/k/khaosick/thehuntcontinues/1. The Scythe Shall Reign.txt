Demonic silhouette behind you
I am always there
Welcome to my dark kingdom
It will be your last resting place

[Chorus 1:]
The scythe shall reign
To thy commands
Destroy one by one
Who ever cross my way
Saints and sinners
You all shall die
Ripping through the centuries
To hell they will be sent
From day on they buried me
Make sure I'll always come back
In the depths beneath the sea
You can't kill what's already dead
You whimpered screams now silent
When I slowly slice your throat
Your pain-racked eyes now blinding
When I cut your head from neck
In camp blood my curse dominion
Sinful I'll take every human's life
And you won't stop me!!

[Chorus 2:]
Revenge is the reason
For human hunting season
Guiltiness dies by my hand
Their pain is the shrine
To my mother's disgrace
The bastard ones deserve to die
Friday â the date of annihilation
The blackest day of god's creation
Dehumanizing living beings
With my utensils
Your death shall be atonement
Murderous intent
