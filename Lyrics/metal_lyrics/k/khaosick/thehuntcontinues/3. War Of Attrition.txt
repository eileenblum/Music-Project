You're the reason for my anger
Now you pray for life
You'll pay for my dark past
Now it's time to die
To suck your life out of you're veins
This is what redemption means
Forgive me not
My emotions are dead

[Chorus:]
Psychological warfare
Stop the war of attrition
Absorbing my essence
War of attrition
Resurrection
Stop the war of attrition
Break with the past
War of attrition
Affinity
Adoration
You've lost you're chance
Now you meet your damnation
You're the reason for my anger
Now you pray for life
You'll pay for my dark past
Now it's time to die
And if I'm not the one you love
I'm the one you love to hate
Can't stand the pain
The suffering drives me insane

[Repeat Chorus]

Yeah!!
You're the reason for my anger
Now you pray for life
You'll pay for my dark past
Now it's time to die
To suck your life out of you're veins
This is what redemption means
Forgive me not
My emotions are dead
