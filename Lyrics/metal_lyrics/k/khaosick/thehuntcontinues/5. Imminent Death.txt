Apathetic in every minute -
My emotions are blind
Forsaken pleasures attend me -
Forced by the face of surrealism
I'm waiting in the dark -
Projections of a stained mind
The silence creeps around -
I'm ready to unfold

[Pre-Chorus:]
The time has come to say goodbye
I'll take your life -
And you will die
Now you taste the smell of death -
No time to waste `till your last breath

[Chorus:]
Hiding in shadows
Your nearness a dying reflection
Dry lounge fast beating heart
An adrenaline experience

[Bridge:]
Shocking sequence
Staring in the face of death
Your end is near
Piece by piece I'll desecrate
Bad feelings inside me
These thoughts I haven't chosen
Darkest fears, depths of a mind
Now become â Reality
There is no time to rest
Imminent death
Uncontrollable desires offered me
insanity
With every second rage is growing
The urge to murder's taking scorn
I want to see you die -
Kneel to me, pray for your life
I love the fear in your eyes -
Tormenting through perversion

[Repeat chorus]
