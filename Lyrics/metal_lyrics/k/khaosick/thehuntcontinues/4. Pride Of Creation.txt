Try to erase
But we cannot die
Spreading the disease
Look into my eyes
Guard your tongue
Vicious rumours for the blind
Beware of the damned
We're not of your bastard kind

[Pre-Chorus:]
You are a big mouth
As we know there's nothing in it
Come on and shut up
We're the pride of creation

[Chorus:]
We don't care what you play and do
All we got to say is
Fuck you!!
Enrichment of glory
You're just a thief
Art to the artists
We practice what we preach
Look into the mirror
It will tell you the truth
A shockwave to the crowd
We're the unwanted youth

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
