Carnal lust
The vice of flesh
Addicted to female skin
Warped bitch
Spread your legs
I like it when you scream my name
Bloody lips
Announce your death
Desires burn my soul
Fatal step
You won't forget
I am your decline

[Chorus:]
I am your tempter
I am your pleasure
I am your master
And I am your god
I am morbid
I am a filth pig
I am sadistic
But I am your lord
Broken man
Lost his way
He tries to close the wounds
Emptiness
In his heart
Hurts him every day
You know why
He had to cry
He's the bringer of pain
Infinite hate
Here and know
Cleanse his sickening mind

[Chorus:]
I am your tempter
I am your pleasure
I am your master
And I am your god
I am morbid
I am a filth pig
I am sadistic
But I am your lord
I can't
Stand it
Anymore
Don't pretend
You understand me
âCause fucking is my only salvation
Fucking is my only salvation
It's my salvation!
Carnal lust
The vice of flesh
Addicted to female skin
Warped bitch
Spread your legs
I like it when you scream my name
Bloody lips
Announce your death
Desires burn my soul
Fatal step
You won't forget
I am your decline

[Chorus]
I am your tempter
I am your pleasure
I am your master
And I am your god
I am morbid
I am a filth pig
I am sadistic
But I am your lord
