[Music: Xaphan - Lyrics: Xul]

Flames consume the conquered Christ
Bodies lie, wasted desolation
Apocalypse, feed the flames
Mutilation, fulfill the cursed rights

Persecution
We deny
Inquisition, kill the accused
Abomination, morbid truth
Extermination
Burned at the stake

Storm the gates - Heaven in flames
Storm the gates - Bring horror and terror
Storm the gates - Darkness damnation

Frenzy, overtaking
Screaming, deafening
Vengeance, annihilation
Storming the gates

Flames consume the conquered Christ
Bodies lie, wasted desolation
Apocalypse, feed the flames
Mutilation, fulfill the cursed rights

Persecution
We deny
Inquisition, kill the accused
Abomination, morbid truth
Extermination
Burned at the stake

Nocturnal hunting
Invoking armies of darkness
Warcult summoning
Storming the gates

Hammer â Drums
Xul â Vocals, bass
Xaphan â Guitars, Vocals
