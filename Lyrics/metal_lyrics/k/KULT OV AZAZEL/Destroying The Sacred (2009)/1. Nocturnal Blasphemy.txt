[Music &amp; Lyrics by Xaphan]

Bred from perversion
Born of sin
Blood Made Flesh
Evil ascends

To spread sin and doubt
Upon the human race
Pestilence and death
Those in His image die in pain
War and disease
Amid mortal planes
Destruction and plague
His creation will be erased

Angels tremble in fear
Saints denounce my name
For I am the plague
The plague of humanity

Destroyer of worlds
Perveter of thought
Abomination unto Heaven and Earth

Devourer of light
Corrupter of life
Violator of souls
Plagued humanity

Vengeance divine
Angelic blood from the sky
The kingdom has crumbled
Heaven hurled from aether planes

I am forever the plague of angels
The plague of humanity
