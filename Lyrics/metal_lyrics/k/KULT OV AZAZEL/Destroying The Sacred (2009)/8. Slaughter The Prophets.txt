[Music: Xaphan - Lyrics: Xul]

Fury rises, reborn from summoning
Ravish the captured, bastards impaling
Rivers of blood, bestial awakening
Bonded by flesh, take these burnt offerings

Nocturnal blasphemy
Dark horrors will decimate
Horned spirits will celebrate
Sacrificial lust
Inflicted oblivion
Demonical perversion

Breeding the damned
Possessed necropolis

Nocturnal blasphemy
Infiltrate the innocence
Dominate with our existence
Sacrificial lust
Demons smile with contempt
Repent with abhorrence

Transfix the bodies, refuge the nightbreed
Your living hell, condemned in misery
Divide with genocide, breath in the burning
Release of carnage, creative killing

Nocturnal blasphemy
Dark horrors will decimate
Horned spirits will celebrate
Sacrificial lust
Inflicted oblivion
Demonical perversion

We are the damned
Horror and sodomy
Nocturnal blasphemy
