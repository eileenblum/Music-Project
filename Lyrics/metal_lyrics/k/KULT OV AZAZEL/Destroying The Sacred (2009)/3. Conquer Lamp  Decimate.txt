[Music: Xaphan/Xul - Lyrics: Xul]

Let the fires burn
Give shadows form
Serve the dark flame
Cursed to live in black

Endless search for wisdom
Hatred, anguish and pain
Burning the souls reflection
Armageddon rises
Conjure forth the beasts
Command the unholy prophecies

Weapons for war, will destroy their world
With rotting flesh, a path is paved
Chaos is born

Tyrant's blood
A daemon's feast
Blackened shadows
Flames burn flesh

A thousand storms
Unleashed upon the northern sky
Angels weep
Serpents gather
Lords of war
Conjure forth the scorched ancient evil

Confessed sins imprisoned
Damnation unites the scorned
Angel's burn in flames
Slaughterer of the horde
Nightmare holds the future
Destroy the Holy Spirit
Unleash the possession
Eternally

Let the fires burn
Give shadows form
Serve the dark flame
Cursed to live in black

Harvest the blood, crimson wine thick with sin
Altars of death, tribute in hell, baptized in flames

Tyrant's blood
A daemon's feast
Blackened shadows
Flames burn flesh

A thousand storms
Unleashed upon the northern sky
Angels weep
Serpents gather
Lords of war
Conjure forth the scorched ancient evil
