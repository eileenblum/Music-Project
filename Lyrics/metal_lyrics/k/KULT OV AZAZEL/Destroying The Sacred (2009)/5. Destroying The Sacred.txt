[Music: Xaphan/Xul - Lyrics: Xaphan]

You are doomed to suffer
Destruction brought upon you
The words and lies you conjure
Will forever be silence from your lips
Slaughter the prophets
This is unholy war
Slaughter the prophets
Words of God are no more
Slaughter the prophets
Behead and cauterize
Slaughter the prophets
Let holy blood run free
Christ the idol bound by flame
Puppet Muhammad denounces his faith
Moses the hustler writhes in pain
In Hell they rot with Allah's remains
Slaughter the prophets
You pray for death, your death will come
Slaughter the prophets
Execute in cold blood
Slaughter the prophets
Desecrate and destroy
Slaughter the prophets
In sacrilegious hate
Popes and priest their faith is raped
Spiritual leaders of Islam lie maimed
Rabbis confined and hung in vain
Bishops tortured, death their fate
For your faith you suffer
Abused then mutilated
Sent to meet your maker
Only to find betrayal
Slaughter the prophets
Massacre the messenger
Slaughter the prophets
End your lives, slay you all
Slaughter the prophets
Behead and cauterize
Death of the prophets 
Slaughtered and blasphemed
