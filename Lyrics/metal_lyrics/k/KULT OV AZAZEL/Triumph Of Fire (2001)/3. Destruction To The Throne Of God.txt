Renounce the putrid body of christ
The one condemned to wear a crown of thorns

Praise be given to the great Black Goat
Faceless one that walks in the night

Fires forever burn in the heavens
Our war on humanity has just begun

Fall of the angels - Rape the virgin pure
Evil of Ancients
Fall of the angels - god's death has come
In Nomine Satanas

Show thy will unto the world
Smite the herd with hammer and claw

Hold high the sign of Satan
Through hell we are the unholy ones

Bring forth the pestilence of a thousand young
And destroy the holy cross

Fall of the angels - Heaven still bleeds
Summon the demons
Fall of the angels - Fires still burn
Rege Satanas

Death shall come to those that follow the light
Do as thy wilt shall be the whole of the law

Fall of the angels
War has been won
Slaughtered holiness
Destruction to the throne of god

Unholy massacre of evil enthroned
God is dead and so it is done
