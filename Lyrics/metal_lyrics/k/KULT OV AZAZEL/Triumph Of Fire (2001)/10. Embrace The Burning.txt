Bloodstained
Ridden with plague
Black Blood
Tears of eternity fade

I search the winding mazes
With the glazed eye's of evil
The stench of death lingers eternally
To inhale its rush for pain

We hail the dark flame

(The) marks on the wall will tell you
(The) screams for justice through pain
I drown the holy cross
With the venom of my hate

Am I dying?
Embrace the burning
Through the red walls
Forever to be

Blood
Fire
Death
I am

Blood stained
Ridden with plague
Black blood
(Tears of) eternity fade

The prophecy of genocide

I want to see the heavens
Survive in a world of hate
We will set them on fire
With our legions rage
