Lamb of Jesus
Your death I have seen
Goat of Satan
Your blood washed me clean

And now I can praise you
Till I die
I am lord, I am king
God is a lie

Through the rites of Lucifer
Pleasure is pain

Inverted cross pointing to hell
Our sacrilege reigns

Hear the names of Abaddon, Dagon, Sekhmet

Reborn through Blasphemy,
Within the Black Flame

At the altar of Satan
Profanation
In the days of darkness
The lord lies dead

Before the sign of hell
The flag of hate is raised
Underneath the black mark
Demonic wrath is waged

Death to all
War for blood
And blood will spill
In Nomine Dei Nostri Satanas

Through the rites of Lucifer
Pleasure is pain

Inverted cross pointing to hell
Our sacrilege reigns

Hear the names of Valefor, Belial, Zepar
Reborn in Blasphemy,
Ordained by Baphomet

At the altar of Satan
Desecration
Glory in the power of darkness
Power through Satan
