[Music / Lyrics by Xaphan]

Praise death, praise war, praise suffering
Hail violence, hail murder, hail agony
Glorified bloodshed, killing humanity
Massacre, slaughter, demise of the weak
Conquering by might with authority
Overthrowing enemies with no impunity
Campaigns of atrocious inhumanities
Snuffing out life, ridden with disease
Fuck your world of absurdity
Filled with the useless roaches of society
Onslaught brought upon by the elite
A world ruled by violence and misery
Rejoice in a universe of depravity
Immersed in evil and tyranny
Witness the horrors of butchery
Genocide, humanised, a swift cleansing
The world is full of violence
And the inherit in us all
Praise death, praise war, praise suffering
Hail violence, hail murder, hail agony
Glorified bloodshed, killing humanity
Massacre, slaughter, inflicted brutality
By might conquering with authority
Discarding rivals impulsively
Crusades accumulate mass casualties
Useless corpses of subhuman breed
The way of the will is the law of the self
Heckling life and commanding death
Violence is needed to weed out the weak
Disposed by means of savagery
Destruction through vehemency
The ugly truth of reality
Witness the horrors of butchery
Genocide, humanised, a swift cleansing
The world is full of violence
And violence breeds within us all
