[Music / Lyrics by Xaphan]

In the name of Satan, king of the earth
Ruler of the world, open wide the gates of hell
Command the forces of eternal darkness to manifest forth from the abyss
With chalice raised, we honor thee
Emperor of all that is and is to be
From thy seed we are spawned as offspring of infernal flesh
Of one blood, born from sin, anointed as kin of the elder race
Possessed by the spirit of Satan
An earthly instrument of damnation
Admit evil in the heart, into the mind, body, and soul
Come Abbadon, father of lies, fallen angel of destruction
Imperator mundi, father of pain
Engulf thy host, the anointed one, within your immerse evil power
In the name of Lucifer, prince of flame
Ender of life, opens the portals of death
Plague the weak with suffering
Exposure to affliction and war
Lighting death, tempests of flesh
To all of sin and everlasting death
Given the purpose of sacrilege in a world void of life
