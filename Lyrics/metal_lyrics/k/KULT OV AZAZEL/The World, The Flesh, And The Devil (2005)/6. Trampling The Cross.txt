[Music by Xaphan / Nocturath, Lyrics by VJS]

Summoned into the night
Led by luciferian light
To his infernal revelry
A nocturnal mass of mockery
Where we worship in perversion
A pentecost adored in sin
In praise to the master
The shadowless one crowned in horned
Trampling the cross with diabolic devotion
Bleeding unpure blood upon Christ's image aflame
Attaining damnation forever
During the last sabbat
Blaspheming a fallen trinity during unholy copulation
A nocturnal mass of mockery
Where we worship in perversion
A pentecost adored in sin
In praise to the master
The shadowless one crowned in horns
Trampling the cross with diabolic conviction
Lacerating altars of flesh in absolute obedience
