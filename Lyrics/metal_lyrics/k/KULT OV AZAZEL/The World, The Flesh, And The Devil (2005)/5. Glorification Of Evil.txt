[Music / Lyrics by Xaphan]

Come mighty all
Powerful king of darkness
Accept this sacrifice we humbly offer
The chosen one is awaiting you
A faithful offering to you as a sign of devotion
Dedication and honor, the glorification of evil
This is what the devil does
He grants us earthly depravity
Extending his infernal kingdom
Which is the only valid one
Satan, master, lord, and prince
Blasphemers as long as we shall live
Renouncing all gods and saints
Spitting upon your fucking cross
Praise be the lord of evil and darkness who is our sole salvation
Prince of hades, come forth and claim the body prepared for you
Master of horrors, homage is paid
Through dedication and salvation
We honor you more than the moon and the fires of the sun
Receive this sacrifice we offer
May our blood spill in transgression
Oh mighty light, burning flame of agony
Enter the body purifying its worthy soul
Burn in the name of Satan, lord of fire
Consecrated under the sign sealed by blood of condemnation
This is what the devil does
He grants us earthly depravity
The worthless Jehovah revoked by trampling upon the holy cross
Come mighty all, powerful king of darkness
Accept this sacrifice we humbly offer
The chosen one is awaiting you
A faithful offer to you
As a sign of devotion
Dedication and honor, the glorification of evil
Oh mighty light, burning flame of agony
Enter the body purifying its worthy soul
Burn in the name of Satan, lord of fire
Consecrated under the sign sealed by blood of condemnation
Praise be the lord of hate and sin who is the glory of evil
