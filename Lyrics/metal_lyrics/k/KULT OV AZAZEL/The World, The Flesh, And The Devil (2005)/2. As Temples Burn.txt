[Music / Lyrics by Xaphan]

Fire, ignite the skies, torched houses of god
Burn, burn to the ground, reduced to ashes and soot
Sanctuaries become tombs, fiery deathtraps of doom
Ridding the world of your kind, smashing your faith
From the synagogues of Jerusalem
To the mosques of Mecca
From the basilicas of the Vatican
To the churches of America
With flame and hate your walls will fall
Altars scarred by sacrilege
Desecration to your holy words
Religious scripture charred and torn
Icons of dogmatic left to rot
Broken in scorn
Behold the blaze, our terror campaign
We stand in glory as temples burn
Death replaces life, a shattered Jehovah of lies
Allah swallowed by hell, shrines to holiness fell
Jesus Christ defiled, Mohammad bonded in fire
Theistic reign now ends, let the inquisition begin
Crosses inverted become swords of rage
Gutting heaven's earthly domain
We are destruction and anarchy
Stormbringers of endless misery
Destroyer of pious morality
Feel the scorching winds of blasphemies
From the synagogues of Jerusalem
To the mosques of Mecca
From the basilicas of the Vatican
To the churches of America
With flame and hate your walls will fall
Altars scarred by sacrilege
Desecration to your holy words
Religious scripture charred and torn
Icons of dogmatic left to rot
Broken in scorn
Behold the blaze, our terror campaign
We are the victors as temples burn
Monks slaughtered like flies
Rabbis left to die
Imams butchered and scorched
Priests are hung by the noose
Ministers baptized in flame
Within this blasphemous reign
All will share the same fate
Christian, Muslim, Hindu and Jew
