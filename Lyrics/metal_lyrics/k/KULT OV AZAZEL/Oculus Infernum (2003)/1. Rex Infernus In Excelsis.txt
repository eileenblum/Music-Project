Rise - Seven heads of blasphemy
Attack - On wings of anarchy
Guarded - By the armor of Baphomet
Destroy - The heavenly hierarchy

Enshrouded by darkness Blessed in sin I hold the keys to death and hell
Born in fire Bonded by blood Spawned beneath the devil's mark
Empowered by wrath Son of revenge Before your death you'll live torment
Those saved by the lamb shall be torn by the beast
On earth as it is in hell, there will be no reprieve
From the abyss I rise
To claim my crown (As) heir to Infernal Majesty
Deliver your death. Carnage by ritualistic means
Defile holy temples (The) flames of glory burn within ash
Ascending my throne. Trampling upon the inferior cross of Christ
His flesh denied (the) filthy prophet of life
I bring world demise to take what's mine
Angels will die (Behold) your savior sacrificed
Destroyed by hordes of demonic warriors
Apocalypse for hell's first born
I curse you all to eternal damnation
Aligned with evil by hell Summoned forth from chthonic lands
In league with Satan Assassin of light To rule a kingdom without end
Destroyer to man Lord of this world King of hell in the highest form
