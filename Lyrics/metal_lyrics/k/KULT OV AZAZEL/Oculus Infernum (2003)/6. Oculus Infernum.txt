Within this pain lies no salvation Impurity strengthened  by mutilation Branded by wrath
of ageless pyres Excrement's of purgatorial: fire Endless lashes across Christian flesh With
sick instruments of suffering Forged from the bones of their own master Malevolence will never be
condoned Void - horror Hell: Black vomit dungeon Punishment is now a forever sanction
No repentance, worthless flagellation Void - horror Abyss: Oculus Infernum Scarred, burnt, an
Esoteric coat of rust Carnished chrome cuts through holy crown Mangled catastrophe, rivers of
carnage Tied down, strung up, hung from inside out Void - horror Hell: Sodomy and
Suffering punishment is now a forever - sanction Clench the wheel, taste the flame Void - horror
Abyss: Oculus Infernum Within this pain lies no salvation Impurity strengthened  by mutilation
Branded by wrath of ageless pyres Excrement's of purgatorial: fire Into the eye of Hell
In a gathering of horns Into the eye of Hell the tormentorium is born With iron blades of
hate we split open the hopeless hearts of God Raped and racked: resistance dies by suffocation
Blasphemy and sickness hails - leads to reign of perversion Sick act after another, Christendom is
forever imprisoned Torn from within - throats removed The bastard prayer spoken no more
No purity dwells within caustic blades That skin and sever books of sacred beliefs Void - Horror Hell:
charred Eucharist Punishment is now a forever - sanction Sermon of torture: holy genocide
Void - Horror: Oculus Infernum
