Sworn to evil Enemy of God Baptized in fire Blessed by hell Spawned by hate
through demonic birth Raised by fiends of the pit Put on earth to ruin mankind
Crowned prophet of death

666 is my mark Vowed to destroy The armies of Christ

I bring eternal suffering Your lord I will dispose To see sheep of Christ crushed
The self destruction of his whores Your worthless savior will be extinct When time
Comes for your mortal end With power from the realms of hell
I conjure forth the hordes to do my bidding on
earth As I execute my plans of war

I have come to destroy your world
Mark of the devil The number of might Behold the image Of the fallen Christ
With spite and vengeance I plague humanity Through abhorrence the flag of hate is
raised Immersed in blood upon the empty coils Battered and slaughtered by legions of hell

666 Is my mark Forever empowered 
By the devil's mark

Christ has fallen Indeed he has fallen
Slaughterer to men holy lies Blasphemed with the sign of Satan Jehovah's
clan will die Renouncing the trinity of lies World is shattered by the majesty of thy
glory Torture, molested by satanic force Sadistically torn apart
Eliminated piece by piece Underneath the Devil's mark
