Extinguished all. The scripts lost prayers Death to all; The Cadence
marches  on From the dark hills that harbor Infested minds internal
contracts His majesties royal ash Commands the fallings will
Infernal Majesty I invoke thee, take my offering Ceremonies
celebrated with flames The lambs are our slaves Blood traces thin
symbols of blasphemy Pain invoked reign, corpse pound black arts
decorate Endless storm the angles fall once more Subconscious worlds,
align empty skies Dark matter rise To the fallen we praise
Invoking the Infernal Majesty Black Skies summon flames
upon the heavens Dark matter rise Ceremonies celebrated with
flames The lambs are our slaves To the fallen we praise Invoking
the infernal majesty With broken wings, darkness brings Death
(for) centuries Seasons of doom, conjure this black trip Broken
chains, holding back the thrones' seeds Prophecies, take from through
the dark realities
