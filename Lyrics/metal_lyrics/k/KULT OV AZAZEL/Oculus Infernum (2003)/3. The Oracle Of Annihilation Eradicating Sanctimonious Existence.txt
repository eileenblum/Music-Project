Our black altar is your world
Your blood our sacrifice
Your lord our enemy
Our sanctity is your death
On this night we call on thee
Extinction through Annihilation
Come now, manifest and appear
Bring forth human devastation
The cries of the faithful are silenced by diabolical might
Holy faith lays slaughtered viewed through bloodstained eyes
Holiness dies Destroyer's of life
Purity torn Anointed in scorn
Power be to that which makes us stronger
All the weak will be left here to suffer
Desecration of the Divine Liturgy
Shattering all spiritual validity
Cursing the holy name of trinity
Summoning destructive forces to end humanity
The oracle of Annihilation
Eradicating sanctimonious existence
Holiness dies Destroyer's of life
Purity torn Anointed in scorn
Expunging the existence of the bastard Christ
Death consumes the masses, there shall be no reprieve
Your god is dead Your religion destroyed
Faith has been shattered By the legions of hell
