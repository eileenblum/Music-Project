Sacrifice The Virgin's child We'll destroy Your paradise Storming forth on
Baphomet commanding hordes of blasphemy Annihilating the holy three The Trinity
of Mockery Summoning Death our hate breeds war Spilling the blood of Jehovah's
whores The son of god will be exposed No more will a bastard be adorned Desecration
of pious lives Elimination to the flock of Christ Under the sign of Azazel We wage
unholy war!!! We blaspheme thee Cursed fucking deity Your name will be destroyed
Henceforth and forever more: Rege Mortalis Letum!!!

Storming forth on Baphomet commanding hordes of blasphemy Annihilating the holy
three The Trinity of Mockery Summoning Death our hate breeds war Spilling the
blood of Jehovah's whores

Genocide Of holy life Conquered by Infernal might By the virtues of Hell
victory shall be done God's creation lay wasted by scorn Extermination of the
righteousness Conjuring warriors from the Abyss The flesh of Christ has been denied
Through slaughter of Christian life Butchered in the triumph of sacrilege Complete
death to all that is pure We renounce thee Wretched Nazarene Crushed by the diabolic
force Powered through misanthropy Destruction of innocent flesh and blood - 
For the:
Perpetual Demise of the Bastard Son
