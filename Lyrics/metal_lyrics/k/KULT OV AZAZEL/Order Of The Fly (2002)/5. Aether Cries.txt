Banished from a kingdom
Fools, they lie dead

Turn Black
Blood will be shed
With tears of lust
Of pain in your existence

I will see you suffer
I, and pain, we bleed, from light, as one

Mist from your breath
Sweat with blood
Tastes of vengeance
For terror and tears

The sky cries....
My soul can express
No more pain
For these black tears of rain

The sky is left with scars the sun will die
