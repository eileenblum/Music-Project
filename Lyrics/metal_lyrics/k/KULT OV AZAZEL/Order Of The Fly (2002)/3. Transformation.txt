Raised upon the throne of life
Raised upon the throne of death
Answered in cries/kill jesus Christ

Beginning the transformation
Life after death
Mortal shell, skinned and scarred
For my new life
Past forgotten, future behold

Darkness the way into my new life

Throne of sin, Lost in light
Bleeding my soul
For my blood lust
Lust, lost
Lust, lost

Calling upon Hecate
Frozen feeling fills my body
Skin dripping, melting violence
My body begins to fight

My soul is falling, no one watching,
Abyss is swallowing, my empty life
