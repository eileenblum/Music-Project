Lurking
Cursed in the thought
Cursed to rot
Alone

Time.... Will tell you different
Revenge...will fuck your soul
Lay Waste

Black Flames upon
A blood drenched corpse
Dead, sucked dry
Eaten, by the garden of shadows

Raped by the light of Christ
Betrayed once again

Garden of shadows - lost forever
Garden of shadows - invader of darkness
Garden of shadows - my plague is planted
Garden of shadows - behold the erosion

The black sun feeds
Into the skeletal season
