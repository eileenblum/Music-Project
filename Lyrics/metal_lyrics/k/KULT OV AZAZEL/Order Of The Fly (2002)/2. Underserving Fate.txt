At the Gates of hell
I sit and wait
What have I done
To deserve this fate

An eternity of darkness
A life of hate

Nothing sweeter than this evil taste

Burning...flesh melting from my soul
Scared...eternal judgement

Flames whisper to a deafening silence
Searching my maze of a mind

Eternal Darkness
Reaches out to me
My soul is calling, calling to be free
