Sold men
humanity dressed itself in pain
Sheep manipulated by evil minds
They accept the rules
destroy them
Surround by walls
I feel death What can I do?
My heart beats slowly
blind me as a bliyyard
How many days have passed?
How many ideas have died?

My blood,
my soul,
gone crazy in the darkness
My head spins
making me dizzy
my silence freezes

Bastard command
I don't resist
flight against time
You decide your future
You aren't a robot
you don't have an owner
