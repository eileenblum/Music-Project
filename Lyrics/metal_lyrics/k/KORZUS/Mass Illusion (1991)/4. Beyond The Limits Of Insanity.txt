The heroes are silent
money brings power

The heroes are deaf
money lights the way

The heroes are resting
Money is peace

My crime is to die
My crime is to die
My crime is to die
My crime is to die

The heroes breathe all the air
I'm in an abyss of blood
My broken heart
My tied hands
My slashed soul
My crime is to die

Have to laugh to hide the tears
Have to laugh to hide the tears
just to die!

They are partying
mones is fun
suffocated
asphyxiated
Our bodies hurting
Our minds don't stop
My crime is to die

The heroes breathe all the air
I'm in an abyss of blood
My broken heart
My tied hands
My slashed soul
My crime is to die
