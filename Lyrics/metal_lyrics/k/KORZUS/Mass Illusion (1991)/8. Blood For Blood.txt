Among so many lies
I take a mirror out of my mind

Under the ashes
my memories fall like stars

Blood for blood
Throw my reality into your pain

Break my handcuffs
let me talk to your soul

Every ay my eyes crystalize like icebergs

A completed retarded neurosis
like a lone being

Schizophrenic
I feel like a Glass toy

A lone warrior
society's miserable rat

I keep on reliving my backward steps
backward for human intelligence
like a lone being
the only invunerable one
of a schizophrenic society

Blood for blood
