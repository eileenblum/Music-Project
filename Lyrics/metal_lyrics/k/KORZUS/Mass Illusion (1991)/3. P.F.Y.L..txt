You fool yourself
you lie to yourself
The price is high and painful
you pay for what they make you believe
you pay for what you believe

They promise worlds
you vote for them
after you pay, pay and pay
You pay through smoke
you pay through war
You pay through the trash you eat

Someone tells you to stop
You swear at him
But he knows the price is your soul
the price is high and painful

Pay
Pay for
Pay for your lies
Pay for your lies
You are paying
maybe unconsciously
You're only fucking yourself

You fool yourself
you lie to yourself
The price is high and painful
you pay for what they make you believe
you pay for what you believe
They promise worlds
you vote for them
after you pay, pay and pay
Pay
Pay for
Pay for your lies
Pay for your lies
