Buried alive
suffering day by day
The black forces
in your own hell's throat
Death's shout
paralyses your sense
Pleasure in suffering
cries out for blood

Fear
From side to side
Pain
crossing in pur minds
Evil 
Was born in the human brain
A dream?
No way

Red lights
like hearts in pain
black sun
burning in your eyes
Maniac life
can't see the great problems
Horror and terror
determining the world

Fear
From side to side
Pain
crossing in pur minds
Evil 
Was born in the human brain
A dream?
No way

Straw men
Straw minds
crossed way
Tied up with no way out
No expression
No liberty
blocked feelings in the Death industry

Fear
From side to side
Pain
crossing in pur minds
Evil 
Was born in the human brain
A dream?
No way
