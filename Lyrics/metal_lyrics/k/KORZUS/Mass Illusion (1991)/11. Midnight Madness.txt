A weak mind in search of pity 
His brain is erupting 
A young face ready to be betrayed 
Alone, depressed, internally destroyed 

He never tried to fight 
To discover his own life 
Now he's just a toy 
A toy one step from halt 

It's eleven o'clock 
His anxiety is great 
Only 30 minutes till madness arrives 

There's no mystery 
Ifs all routine 
He doesn't feel hunger, pain or love 

Almost midnight the high arrives 
The dose is strong 
His anxiety is great 
The needle relights the night 
It's midnight
He's dead!
