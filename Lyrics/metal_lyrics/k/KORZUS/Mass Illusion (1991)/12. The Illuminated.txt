Born under the eyes of the moon 
The arms of death can't embrace them 

His gift is unique 
It's the sign of fire 
He knows his mind is eternal 

From him 
Nothing can be hidden 
His life is dominated by premonitions 

His truth 
Is hidden in his soul 
There isn't and never was an explanation 

His power sometimes 
Is stronger than his mind 
It invades every thought 

Everyone says 
He is the illuminated 
But in really nobody knows 

He feels 
His reaction 
Controlling 
His reason 
Restless visions 
Consume his mind 
He doesn't judge 
Himself a prophet
