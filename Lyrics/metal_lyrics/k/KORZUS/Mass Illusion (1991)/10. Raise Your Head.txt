I don't breathe peace
I'm suffocatinh in misery

I feel my blood running
I'm alive and I cry

There is no enemy
There is only greed

Open your eyes and see the truth
This is real

Stop
enough illusions
Stop, stop
enough parasites
Stop say stop
Don't turn yourself in
Raise your head

They steal your pride
your faith, your worth

you feel like an
elecronically programmed Android

Look in the mirror
and you won't see anything
Your country doesn't matter
There is only one program

Stop
enough illusions
Stop, stop
enough parasites
Stop say stop
Don't turn yourself in
Raise your head

Stop
enough illusions
Stop, stop
enough parasites
Stop say stop
Don't turn yourself in
Raise your head
