on't say you love me
Don't say you're sorry
Trust is something
That doesn't last

Don't hide anything
don't beat araound the bush
I feel your coldness
Inside of me

Don't Worry!
I'll kill you!
Don't Worry!
I'll kill you!

Don't take me for granted
that's a waning
your eyes hide
nothing for me

I gave you my world
I'll give you death
Lies are always
Short lived

Don't Worry!
I'll kill you!
Don't Worry!
I'll kill you!

When you're with me
Don't try anything
See it in my face

If not, things
Will get rough
Don't worry
You will die!

Short lived

Don't Worry!
I'll kill you!
Don't Worry!
I'll kill you!
