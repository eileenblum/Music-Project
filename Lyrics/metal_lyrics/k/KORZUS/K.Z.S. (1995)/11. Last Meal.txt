Good evening mom'n'dad
I've got a big surprise
Tonight i made dinner
At first my friend heart
Don't worry mom'n'dad
Because your wish is pure shit
I cooked in your honor
Now you can eat my brain

The last meal [x3]
The last

Wait mom'n'dad
You are my special guests
Taste my lung soup
And drink my hot blood
Don't worry mom'n'dad
there's satisfaction in your eyes
I was your slave
Living in your lies

The last meal [x3]
The last

But it was prepared with so much dedication
That I forgot to live for myself
I wanna find the light
To discover what's right
I need war to learn how to fight

You sold my life to the lies
I see my death! Are you blind?
Like a storm out to sea
I need to be free

It's easy mom'n'dad
My life, it's mine
You'll never leave the table
Don't fucking cry
You've got to realize
That you made me this way
Now, do you understand me?
I'm free
