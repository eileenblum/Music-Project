Pick me up
Take me there
If you wear that, i'll stay home
You stink
Go shower
I'm tired
Yuo're late
Who are you staring at?
Where are you?
I don't trust you!!!

What a pain!
What a pain!
In the ass!

Look at me
I'm perfect
I'm right - You're always wrong
Don't sit there
Sit here
Don't say that
Say this
All you do is embarass me
You say you love me
I don't even like you

What a pain!
What a pain!
In the ass!

Get up
And do the dishes
Then you can cook some food
You can't
Go to bed
I'm not tired so you're not either
Open your eyes
I want company
Misery loves company
