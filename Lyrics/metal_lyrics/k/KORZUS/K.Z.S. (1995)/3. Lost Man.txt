A boring day
With the same image
Both in the concave
And the Convex

What a day
A day I chose to think
An internal thought
No melody

Put with the same sonority
Of a melancholy sream!

What a day I chose to laugh
What a day I chose to write!

A lost man

What a day I chose to talk
Someone
Who hates me
What a day I chose to fight
A lost man
What a day
What a day
What a day
A lost man
What a day
