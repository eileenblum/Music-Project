You may swear
And forget your reality
You feel closed
An invisible jail you see

Never saw
The taste of liberty

You never fight!
You blame the time!
You think you're light!
Bullshit!

You don't want
anyone to take you out of bed
You've got nothing to persue
And it's very sad
never took, never used
the chance you had

You never fight!
You blame the time!
You think you're light!
Bullshit!

Bullshit

You're a slave of the night
Of the easy life
Never thought, Never Walked
Never saw the light
In your head there's a hole
And it's three feet wide

You never fight!
You blame the time!
You think you're light!
Bullshit!
