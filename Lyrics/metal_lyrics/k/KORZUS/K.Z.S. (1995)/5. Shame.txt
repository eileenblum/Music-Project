See all this blood
I'm nothing but a nervous wreck
Screaming for your spirit
You see the final stop has come
Back

Search for your magic key
Black silence embraces me
Hear the call from hell
It's coming, can't you tell?

Mercy, rest, the mask!
Fight, Light, it's right!
Heart, Head, Hate!
Fucking bloody lies!
Shame! [x4]

You are Sucking my life
Consuming my soul behind my back
I see the wounds, but not the cure
await a senseless death
close the gates of war!
I need to escape the storm
Hear my mind, please!
You think my life's a shit

Mercy, rest, the mask!
Fight, Light, it's right!
Heart, Head, Hate!
Fucking bloody lies!
Shame! [x4]

close the gates of war
I need to escape the storm
Black silence embraces me
I see the wounds, but not the cure
Shame!

Shame!
Shame!
Shame!
