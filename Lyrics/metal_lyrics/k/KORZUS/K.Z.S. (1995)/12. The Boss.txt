C'mon boy, get me a pen quick
C'mon boy, clean this fucking shit
I'm the law, nobody can deny
I'm the boss, I'm gonna make you cry

Just work'n'work'n'work hard!
You're never gonna get too far
you're low class, you'll never learn
you've got two choices die or burn!

Your mission if to serve me
You'll never achieve every goal I've got
I can hear your Heart beat
I'm gonna use you to clean my feet

Just work'n'work'n'work hard!
You're never gonna get too far
you're low class, you'll never learn
you've got two choices die or burn!
