Bolling, turmoiled
Swimming upstream
In a hurricane swept
Thrash until you die

Laughing, killing, smilling
Run you fingers
Through your heart!

Soft city on the broken face
But looking like a million fucking pieces
Eaten alive by empty stares
A face is a rottenness
Beware!

Spit, shit, and grit
Caked on faces like soup in a bowl
Tousled hair
The scalp of hate
Iron mask
It's the first place

Soft city on the broken face
But looking like a million fucking pieces
Eaten alive by empty stares
A face is a rottenness
Beware!

A cross thrust in the ground
Sunshine smiles after crying
Break down!
Breathing fire!
This city could usa a shower

Soft city on the broken face
But looking like a million fucking pieces
Eaten alive by empty stares
A face is a rottenness
Beware!

Soft city on the broken face
But looking like a million fucking pieces
Eaten alive by empty stares
A face is a rottenness
Beware!

Soft city on the broken face
But looking like a million fucking pieces
Eaten alive by empty stares
A face is a rottenness
Beware!

Soft city on the broken face
But looking like a million fucking pieces
Eaten alive by empty stares
A face is a rottenness
Beware!

Beware!
Beware!
Beware!
