Sadness
Made of Glass
Shattered Against the Wall
Smeared, Filthy
It Stinks, It's Gross

Overrun by an Old Truck
Of a Dishonet Construction Firm
Which Launders Milliions
For the Underworld

Cacaine
Which is Old
And Bought, Then Brought Home
That Goes up the Nose
To the Blood of the Human Body
It Makes You Trip
It Brings You
Sadness
Sadness
Sadness
Made of Glass

Shattered Against the Wall
Of a Prision
Of the Mind
Of an Addiction

Overruled
By Fear, By Fire
Consumes More Than It Makes
Oblivious
To the Lives That it Takes

Sadness Made of Glass
Sadness Made of Glass
Sadness Made of Glass
