Your stick your finger in my face
And tell me what I must do
Why don't your respect me?
Your truth is not mine

I'm tired of always hearing
Time is passing
And you never learn
I'm looking in your eyes
And won't see your soul burn

Respect
Respect my time
Respect my life
Respect your mind
Respect

When your judge yourself
Look at your life
Everyone knows
That you're weak
My power is my mind

Your sins were born in your soul
Imposing rules to everyone
Your physical force is bullshit
I know
Now!

Respect
Respect my time
Respect my life
Respect your mind
Respect
