Twist my spine if you can
Show me your nightmares
I'm screaming higher and higher
I'm ready every time

Revenge shines in my eyes
Dive deep down
Do you know me
Who am I?
You must die?

Don't follow my sins
Don't follow my hate
Don't follow my anger
Punisher in mu name

Mortal way of life
Feeling the smell of fear
Your heavy breath don't stop
Blood, sweet, tears

To live like a pariah
Is my strike
Death walks with me
Hell's kitchen rises

Don't follow my sins
Don't follow my hate
Don't follow my anger
Punisher in mu name
