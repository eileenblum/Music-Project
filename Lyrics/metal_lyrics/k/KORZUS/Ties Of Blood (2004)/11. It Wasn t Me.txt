Isolated from the world
I was imprisoned
It is not fair
I should pay
A step away fom death

I don't know
Under pressure
I live in hell
A step away
From the end
The final vote
The blood law

It wasn't me!
And death sleeps at my side
It wasn't me!
And death sleeps at my side

Death sleeps at my side

Isolated from the world
I was imprisoned
The law is hard
I was clean
They took waht was mine

I don't know
How long I will live
Death around me day by day
My rest is my dream

It wasn't me!
And death sleeps at my side
It wasn't me!
And death sleeps at my side

Death sleeps at my side

Death! At my side!
