On the skin
Of the misery
Suffering hard until you die

On the peak
Of the fear
The end isn't pain
Lose or live
Run or stay
A bunch of blinds
Don't see the way

Who am I talking to?
You only get to know people that
You're talking to
You only get to know
Until you death

A bunch of blinds
You only turn around o he evil sight
A bunch of blinds
You only turn around o he evil sight

On the skin
Of the misery
You keep living don't you cry

In the reign
Of destruction
There is no solution
From misery
To death
A bunch of blinds
No rest

Who am I talking to?
You only get to know people that
You're talking to
You only get to know
Until you death

A bunch of blinds
You only turn around o he evil sight
A bunch of blinds
You only turn around o he evil sight
