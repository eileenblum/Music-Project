World!
I'm crazy
World!
World!
Ties of blood

Songs of anguish
Suffer without rest
Invoke the heavens
And cry out for mercy

To change your destuny
To dream in vain
There is no light
The world is living in pain

I won't speak of flowers
I'll just speak of blood
The chances are few
In this worl

World!
World!
I'm crazy
World!
World!
Ties of blood

Songs of anguish
Suffer without rest
Invoke the heavens
And cry out for mercy

I see the crisis
Thar can't be delained
Inforgiving chaos
Cannot be refrained

I won't speak of flowers
I'll just speak of blood
The chances are few
In this worl

World!
World!
I'm crazy
World!
World!
Ties of blood
