I've been walking
With no direction
Homeless faithless
Kicking bones

Fed by poverty
Among the disunion
Show your face
You are lying

You hate me
You bled me
Did you breed the man
Never get me down

You incite me
You hurt me
Did you breed the man
Never get me down

Shred by a blade
That your coldly
Gripped and created
My pieces are all that remain

My failure
Is your pleasure
Show your face
You are lying

You hate me
You bled me
Did you breed the man
Never get me down

You incite me
You hurt me
Did you breed the man
Never get me down
