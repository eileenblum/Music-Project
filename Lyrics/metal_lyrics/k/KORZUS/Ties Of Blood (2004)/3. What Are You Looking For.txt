Memories
Making the present harsh
Sometimes you are a burden
I have to drag around

But do I really have to?
Give me my life
You only hide from everything
And I waste my time

I see your death
What are you looking for?

In the beginning
You understood me
Now you forgot everything
Now I can see

My fate is to suffer
Silen, stick, alone
I can free myself
Runnig on my road

I see your death
What are you lookiung for?

You
Are
A pain
In the ass
