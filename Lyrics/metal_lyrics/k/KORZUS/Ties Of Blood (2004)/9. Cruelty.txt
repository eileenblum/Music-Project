Condemned
To live in hell
No limits, no barriers

When hatred
Touches you soul
In the shadow of desolatuion

So much suffering
So much disunion
The control
The power
The reason
Just remorse
Only darkness
Only pain
No conditions

So much
Misery
In this shadow world

Replacement
Catastrophic
Objects in the scale of
Progress

So much suffering
So much disunion
The control
The power
The reason
Just remorse
Only darkness
Only pain
No conditions

Cruelty to kill
Cruelty to kill

Continement
Some brains think
Others vegelate

Criticize
Ride equality
Love and liberty

So much suffering
So much disunion
The control
The power
The reason
Just remorse
Only darkness
Only pain
No conditions

Cruelty to kill
Cruelty to kill
