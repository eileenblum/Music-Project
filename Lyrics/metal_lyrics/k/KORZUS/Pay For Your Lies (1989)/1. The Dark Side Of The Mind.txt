They say about me 
They prefer my defeat 
To reaching their own success 
They hurt me 

Like snakes 
They're betrayers 
They destroy my image 
In front of me are my friends 
Behind me my executioners 

Lies, lies ! 

Is the dark side 
The dark side of the mind 
Lies, lies ! 
Is the dark side 
The dark side gotta die 

They want to see me grovel 
Get down on my knees 

They don't fight 
They cheat easily ! 

Disloyal, disloyal ! 
Envy is their trademark 
You keep on believing them 
And you'll get stabbed in the back 

Lies, lies ! 
Is the dark side 

Lies, lies ! 
Is the dark side 

The greatest sadness 
Is a lack of shame 
They distort the truth 
Poisoning my name 
They're people without honor 
They are all two-faced
