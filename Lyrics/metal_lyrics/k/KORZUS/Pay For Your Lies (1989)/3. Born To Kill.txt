The end resistence arrived 
It can't be changed anymore 
The black night comes to warm 
Her belly cames the sin 

His soul is his power 
The damned return to kill 
The time is now, it's the end 
Listen to what he will say : 

"I am back, 
You must come to me 
I have no mercy 
I am born, born to kill"
