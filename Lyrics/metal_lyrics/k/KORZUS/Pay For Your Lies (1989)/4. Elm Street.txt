Spew the blood from your mind 
Sharp razors are cutting you 
Death in your dreams is your nightmare 
Escape, hide yourself, don't go crazy 
There is no peace, he's a bastard 
Crazy revenge marked on you 

Live in the dream just to kill 
Know that from the dream, you'll not wake up 
Power and fear are his weapons 
Violent agony sustains his life 
Children suffering with his pain 
Elm is the street, die for it 

Prisoners, prisoners, of Elm Street 

His nails screeching are his signal 
His feverish voice doesn't let you wake up 
Today is the end, he's going to kill you 
Dream, dream a lot, Elm Street is your home
