My brain has been changed 
You hear my screams 
My blood flows painfully 
You hear my plea 

I am in my tomb 
With hands tied 
I am stuck in the rot 
The fever is the brain wash 

The surgery is near the end 
There are no memories 
Is like a shadow produced by the mind 
Do you hear my plea ? No ! 

Life knows only life, force know the truth 
Only my voice ! 
Only my silence ! 
The illusion is full of pain 

My brain is suffering ! 
My brain was stolen ! 
My brain is washed ! 
My brain was frozen !
