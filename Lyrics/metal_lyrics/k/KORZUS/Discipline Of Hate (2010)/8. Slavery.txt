He descended the stairs of illusion
And opened the door of conceit
He sat at the table of falsehood
To devour a banquet of deceit

He tasted hypocrisy
Spat on the plate of misery
Drank the liquid of domination
And for dessert, slavery

He left in search of wealth
It was part of his stubbornness
To get in the street of greed
To overrun benevolence and kindness

He tasted hypocrisy
Spat on the plate of misery
Drank the liquid of domination
And for dessert, slavery

He entered the tower of power
And ordered with no pity
He proclaimed himself owner of the world
With a streak of cruelty

He tasted hypocrisy
Spat on the plate of misery
Drank the liquid of domination
And for dessert, slavery

Dark soul, Owner of the world...
Dark soul, Owner of the world...
Dark soul, Owner of the world...

He tasted hypocrisy
Spat on the plate of misery
Drank the liquid of domination
And for dessert, slavery
