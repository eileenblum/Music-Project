Sit on the chair
I feel the change inside of me
What was I?
What am I?
Now I can see

Closing my eyes
Judgement time
Last memories
Last life
My spirit flies
I can believe
Is this insanity or sanity?

Where is my soul?
In the last world

In my head
Many questions
The light is coming
My past is a mistery
It's my reality

Closing my eyes
Judgement time
Last memories
Last life
My spirit flies
I can believe
Is this insanity or sanity?

Where is my soul?
In the last world [x2]
