You feel so lame: "why was I wrong"?
Such a bad choice to fight me alone
There is no change you could have known
That in my fists lie is your doom

There is a cause for everything I do
My growing anger now devouring you
Seek for the truth
Seek it in you
You know the shit I had to bear for you

You reap what you sow
I had to bear for you
You reap what you sow
I had to bear

I feel ashamed and don't know why
I ever trusted a shit like you
There was no change I could have known
That in that friend I had a foe

There is a cause for everything I do
My growing anger now devouring you
Seek for the truth
Seek (it) in you
You know the shit I had to bear for you

You reap what you sow
I had to bear for you
You reap what you sow
I had to bear

I had to bear for you
You reap what you sow
I had to bear for you
You reap what you sow
I had to bear
