Skies darken
The sun fades
Resuscitation underway

A holocaust
Cities drown
Fire consumes everything around

Losing time
2012
Time unwinds
2012

Ice melting
A virus spreads
In time humanity is dead

All is lost
Gods are gone
Religion never sees the dawn

Losing time
2012
Time unwinds
2012

Imminent the pressure of a perfect prophecy
I can see it as a growing possibility
Sacrifice the day to find
The end is born to cleanse mankind

Skies darken
The sun fades
Resuscitation underway

A holocaust
Cities drown
Fire consumes everything around

Losing time
2012
Time unwinds
2012
