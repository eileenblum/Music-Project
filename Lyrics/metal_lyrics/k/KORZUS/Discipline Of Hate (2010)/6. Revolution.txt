You see... Sinistry!
Your eyes... Monopolize!

In you there's nothing left to gain
Securing endless disarray
You're lost, you're blind
Fascists control your mind

Civilization
Slaves to the TV
A revolution
Burns inside of me

You see... Ignorance!
Your eyes... Innocence!

Born in the sickness of their hate
Media strives to reinstate
The fear, to dream
Reality to be

Civilization
Slaves to the TV
A revolution
Burns inside of me

You see... Sinistry!
Your eyes... Monopolize!

In you there's nothing left to gain
Securing endless disarray
You're lost, you're blind
Fascists control your mind

Civilization
Slaves to the TV
A revolution
Burns inside of me
