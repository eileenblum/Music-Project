Thousands of stone eyes seal my fate
Woth rotten mouths full of hate
Feeding my poison
Serpent's hands
Give me a silver goblet
With the devil's brand

I feel my body enter a shell
Closing my eyes
Living this hell

I check my calendar
There are no appointments
i cover great distances
Between past and present
Returning from a tunnel
To once again behold the light
I'm stuck in my body
Immune to wrong or right

I feel my body enter a shell
Closing my eyes
Living this hell

I check my calendar
There are no appointments
i cover great distances
Between past and present
Returning from a tunnel
To once again behold the light
I'm stuck in my body
Immune to wrong or right

I feel my body enter a shell
Closing my eyes
Living this hell
