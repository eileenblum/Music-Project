With a nod of his head
And a wave of his hand
Pain and blood covering my eyes
It's the reign, reign of lies

March! Destroy! Slay!
Crushing, breaking my brain!
March! Destroy! Slay!
Under his command!

Nations fall before his might
Lay shattered at his feet
That is their plight
He will never accept the light

March! Destroy! Slay!
Crushing, breaking my brain!
March! Destroy! Slay!
Under his command!

Reign of lies...

March! Destroy! Slay!
Crushing, breaking my brain!
March! Destroy! Slay!
Under his command!
