Now I hear my internal voice
In my visions just my mind
How can we end this darkened misery
Abandoned dreams lost in time

Walking, forcing my soul to rise
Letting go of the past we create a new paradise
Destiny embrace immortality
Rising up, no fear in my eyes

Die! Die! Die!
I now know why
It's in my eyes
I'll never die

Envy breeds your disgrace
Slowly leading you off your trail
Rise up once again for your life
A chosen path that we will not fail

Die! Die! Die!
I now know why
It's in my eyes
I'll never die

Now I hear my internal voice
In my vision just in my mind
Walking, forcing my soul to rise
Destiny is in my eyes

Die! Die! Die!
I now know why
It's in my eyes
I'll never die
