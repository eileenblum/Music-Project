No guilt, no pain, no sorrow
In this head
In the eyes of god you seek
Forgiveness

(Free yourself)
No reason to be afraid
You have to follow your own way
So you can finally feel
The bliss of serving your own will

No life without awareness
Only pain
Spend so much time in madness
A mistake

(Time to change)
No longer wasting the years
you must shed all your fears
Before it comes to an end
You must bow the...

Truth!!! - in your spirit
Truth!!! - in your mind
Can't!!! - avoid feeling
The massive force of the mind
