Raise your soul

Here in the light
Of darkness, end of times
There I see
In front of me insanity

A bitter life to seek revenge
A bitter end
I'll turn my back to what I lost
And make amends

Raise your soul

Here in the light
Of darkness, end of times
There I see
In front of me insanity

A breath of life we will ascend
And without end
Embrace all life, respect the earth
For what is worth

Raise your soul

A bitter life to seek revenge
A bitter end

Raise your soul
