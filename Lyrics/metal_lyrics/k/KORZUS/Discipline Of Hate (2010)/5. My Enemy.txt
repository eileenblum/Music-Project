In the mouth, the taste of blood
On the hands, the trace of hate
Words cut sharper than a blade
Attitudes that time will dictate

You can't hide - from me
Take off your mask - for me
Show yourself - to me
Now you are - my enemy

From the eyes a tear drips
In the heart sadness beats
Words don't mean anything
Attitudes you can't understand

You can't hide - from me
Take off your mask - for me
Show yourself - to me
Now you are - my enemy

My hate unveils the mystery of your flesh
In your decay a reason to celebrate
On your knees,
You look to me and you perceive
The sight of death is so alive

In the mouth, the taste of blood
On the hands, the trace of hate
Words cut sharper than a blade
Attitudes that time will dictate

You can't hide - from me
Take off your mask - for me
Show yourself - to me
Now you are - my enemy
