We desecrate
Feed the fire of anger and hate
For a moment you will taste
The evil that your mind can create

Trust - deep in your soul
Hate - you can't control

Discipline of hate
Spread the world of death and shame
Discipline of hate
Forget your god, become a slave

Organized
Like flocks of cattle you share
The same ideology
Rock bottom for life in society

Trust - deep in your soul
Hate - you can't control

Discipline of hate
Spread the world of death and shame
Discipline of hate
Forget your god, become a slave

Trust - deep in your soul
Hate - you can't control

Discipline of hate
Spread the world of death and shame
Discipline of hate
Forget your god, become a slave
Discipline of hate
Discipline of hate
