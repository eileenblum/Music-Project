Rivers of greed
Rage through their souls
Visions of power
Their only goals

Darkness is looming
Creeping in your brain
Cobwebs in your mind
Causing blinding pain

Seek the crossed bones
Above their twisted throne

No thought for the suffering
No care for the ill
All they can think off
Is moving in four the kill

[Chorus 4x:]
Don't scream out loud
Your time has come

Fight for peace
Believe their dreams
Arrogant sycophants
And their evil means

Pure evil is ascending
Your life is your game
No regard for your suffering
For your death they aim

[Chorus 4x]

[Solo]

[Chorus 4x]
