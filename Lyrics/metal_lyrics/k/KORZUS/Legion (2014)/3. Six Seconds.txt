Now I know my final destiny
Resurrected forged in steel

[Verse]
Sounds like fury
Feels like hate
Breaking your necks
It's the metal faith

You can feel the power and glory
It's our deal we are never sorry

[Verse]

[Chorus 2x:]
One, two, three
See you in the mosh pit
Four, five, six
Six seconds to be free

We can see from first to last
Brotherhood of the brave and best

[Solo]

[Verse]
[Chorus]

One... Come with me
Two... Six seconds
Three... To be free
Four, five, six
Six, six, six, six seconds
