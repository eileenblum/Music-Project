I speak with the dead
I know what they want
I see things that have no meaning

[Chorus:]
Lifeline, death row
Storm of death, death for all
Lifeline, death row
Lifeline, storm of death, death for all

I'm chaos and hope
The reason for all change
The pain of your suffering

[Chorus]

I am the pain of creation
I am the name of conspiracy
I am harpoon deep anger
I am your insanity

[Solo]

I speak with the dead
The reason for all change
I see things of your suffering

[Chorus]
