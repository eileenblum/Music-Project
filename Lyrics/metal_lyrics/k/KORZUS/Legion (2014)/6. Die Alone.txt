Lies with pain
Skull and bones
We fight in our safe
Retreat while death
We breed

Domain, lay siege at your own demise
Blood, death comes in spree my sacrifice

[Chorus 2x:]
Mother of all bombs
Spread your flesh, die alone

Lies with blood
Skull and veins
We see in our hate
I believe your death agreed

Hell, your grave
Suicide, no way
Black night, your disgrace
Your mind, just hate

[Chorus 2x]

[Solo]

[Chorus 2x]

Die alone...
