Aim and shoot, destroy the other side, and now it's time
Paint a red, ground of blood, beyond the dust
Chaos, pain, death, blood, they all die young
Kill the plague, no time to lie, no place to hide

[Pro-chorus:]
Today, extinction
Today, all must pray

I'm your judge by my hands, you die fast or slow
Greed, hate, cursed fate, embrace your disgrace

[Pro-chorus]

[Chorus 2x:]
No way, no lie
No place to die
Bleeding pride

Aim and shoot, destroy the other side, and now it's time
Paint a red, ground of blood, beyond the dust
Greed, hate, cursed fate, embrace your disgrace
I'm your judge by my hands, you die fast or slow

[Pro-chorus]
[Chorus 2x]

[Solo]

[Pro-chorus]
[Chorus 4x]
