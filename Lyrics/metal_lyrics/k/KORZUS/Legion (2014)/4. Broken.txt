Breaking news just another fool
Despicable people rule
Prevaricating manifests
Questioning common senses is the test

[Chorus:]
Why should the world be yours?
While we open all those doors
It seems as if the truth was stolen
Society indeed is broken

By the millions serve and relay
On our nation's good will in place
Bestowing upon common folk
Dependency, conformity

[Chorus]

[Solo]

How can only a few of them
Lead millions into despair
Like lab mice expendable
By the masses they must be hanged
