War, misery, chaos and death
The boiling blood of my nation
Reality, you cry

Pain, anguish, fear and revolt
The boiling blood of my vision
Reality, you cry

[Chorus 2x:]
Legion, buried up to your neck in shit
Legion, your food is around you

Weapons, army, reason and life
The boiling blood of my creation
Reality, you cry

Pride, peace, heart and soul
The boiling blood of my mission
Reality, you cry

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus 2x]
