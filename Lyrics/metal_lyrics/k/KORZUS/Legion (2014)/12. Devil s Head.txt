The tip of death is warhead
To heaven it will destroy
A steel shell rides the bomb
Go to aim and explode

Any way man is to blame
The trigger without faith
The blood shed by anger
Fire, just hate

[Chorus:]
Devil's head
Hope was gone
Pain your blood
Evil minds, devil's head

The damage was gone
The flesh rots, buries and burns
The guilty knows the power
Shatter flesh and bones to dust

The seeds of chaos
That cries out for revenge
The final stage to the world for you
Lost your face

[Chorus 2x]
