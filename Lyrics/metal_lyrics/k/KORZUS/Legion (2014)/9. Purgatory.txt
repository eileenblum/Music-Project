Purgatory!

I'm confused, lost in chaos
I'm adrift endless trails

[Pre-chorus:]
Pain, it kills me
Hate, it kills me
Pain, it kills me
Hate

Am I crazy? I don't know
On the verge of losing even my soul

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
Inside my soul, purgatory
Poisons my blood, purgatory
Beyond my death, purgatory
Eternal pain, purgatory

I feel hopeless, dead in life
See no future or what I left behind

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
