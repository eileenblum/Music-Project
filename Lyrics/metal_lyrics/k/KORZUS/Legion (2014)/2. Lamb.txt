[Verse]
There is no such thing as preference
We're all so small to the universe
Then for once control your arrogance
Hate towards the old or new
Self entitled chosen few
Tiny mind and giant certainty

[Chorus:]
Illusion resolution
Inherited reactions
Inquisitor in black
Wolf transvested lamb
Wolf transvested lamb

Learn along this path so short
How to live, how to endure
While the mirror hurts you bad
Confused and contradicted
Backwards all pain inflicted
Above all hate you're a believer

[Chorus]
[Verse]
[Chorus]
