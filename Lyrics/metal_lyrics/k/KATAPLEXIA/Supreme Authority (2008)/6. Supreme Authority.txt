Unconsciously developing a vast fury
for being constantly refused
Denied into the superficial society

Traumatizing and repressed hateness
Deliberated through all the years of corruption
Engendering new devastating brains

Under treating the overincredulous masses
Living a continuously world of mediocrity
Believing in a false testimony of promises
where the laws are ruled by a supreme authority

Rivalry between the madness and purity
betraying the anguish with countless abomination
political preaching of subliminal supremacy
overrule the terror over the populations

No more uncompleted desires
Injustice punishments blasting behind the cells of bitterness
No more ironic suicides
Tormenting remorses into a cheating subconsciousness

Rivalry between the madness and purity
betraying the anguish with countless abomination
political preaching of subliminal supremacy
overrule the terror over the populations

Puppets of war, Pigs of The world
Protecting the faith of Corruption
There is no more justice for all
Our voices are shat against the law
Cheating our rights with
Monopoly and Obliteration.

Under controlling the overincredulous masses
Living a continuously world of mediocrity
Believing in a false testimony of promises
where the laws are ruled by a superficial society

Unconsciously developing a vast fury
for being constantly refused
Denied into the supreme authority...!
