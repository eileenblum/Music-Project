Deeper I fall, deeper the fallgreater the solemnity of the Fall.With everlasting dirt they paint my nameNightmares gnaw my dreams and rape the visionheadless and heartless still striving forwardwith strong burden through timeless Rust.Bare naked hands with slippery fingersA face with scars and frozen lipsMouthful of tragedy, passion and disgustMy soul aflame is all I craveDeath came from the tips of my fingers,now I leave soul to reach the end of the light.The weak one of me decays, the True one out breathes..."I shall speak and Blood from my mouth will flowAnd no soul shall seek no path, no longer..."
