Life-drain to the waters of origin.A scar in the chests and a bliss of the infinite space discomfortwhere breath is nothing but a stain inside these lungs.ThetruthisDeath; beyond many waves; many voids: in Solitude.A soulful betrayal (of This and Herein)Where Abyss' gleam and I became One Black eyethere your semen (my hatred) and all of its ways drowned in...I am the Knowledge. I am the VoiceWhere it All ends, I am the Beginning.Continuous, the worst.Shadows that stare - may you never come...
