(I) Kill (Me)and plague with invocation of Time when I'll erase All and the Self and lead your souls into (the) undying Hateflowto spread the stench of naked infected fleshwhen no longer any word is spokenthrough the sealed mouth.. rotten mindThrough these flaming eyes I'll see All of the Earth shining bright in its pain...its living shell burnt to ash, in disgust...Enter the Black Flame hall / My cold nourishing specter of dreamsEnter the Black Flame hall / Revival of the long gone Wisdom in pure destructive filth:A void to final Consumption
