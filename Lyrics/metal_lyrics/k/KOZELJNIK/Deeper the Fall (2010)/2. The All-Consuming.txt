My (non)body's drowning downWith rotting snakes wrapped around my neckDown to the parallel world to purify itself in your filthLay your hands deep down in dirtembrace thy great Earhtfall in all its gloryfor obedience to thy saviors' path is now wrecked in contrastCarry solemn death's torch and deny yourself as a great thought!Praise the Oldest of all Crowns, shining bright and high again!Flaming circles are inflicting the view, behold not, but receiveÂComing silent like a cancer into every living beastThe All-consuming breath of S.A.T.A.N.
