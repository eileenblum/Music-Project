Illumine! Ashes of the Underskin - cry is thine my lungs to mournBefore my eyes... pale was the earth (yet so bitter within itself)In bleak light, with bleeding sigh...A name, in grief desired to be spoken loud when silentnever shall be retrieved, never again...A wind, caressing your flesh in deceitnever shall be retrieved, never againOf you who praise mercy and grace this presenceShall barely one fragile soul be spared?!Down, rape the truth with your flesh in woeReverse all... Earth corrodes and flesh dissolvesWith faith and death of thy bereaved pathBlessed be, by invoked afterspirits, their emptiness given...
