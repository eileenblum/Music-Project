Supreme Law of the Filth kindA rule and denial of theoriesDeep below this surface it dwellsChaosphere Injection into life-laden gravityI re:live the Nothing in its circles and variationsI - Life of which Death takes form / I - Death of life being bornGreatest Eyehole with blind sightDead to all the streams of progressionDragging words in forlorn... be gone voices!Anti-direction, no paths, no stars...
