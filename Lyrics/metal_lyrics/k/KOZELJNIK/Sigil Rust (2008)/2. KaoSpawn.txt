Despise unloving will divine,
Gave no light, but the freezing one shouting in despair..
...and shadowed the moon,
Gave all the strength to - kill life and kill life!

Formed was I, with dirt lust
Hard-pierced murder in the heart....
Given birth from the devilish flesh.
the purest womb...

I am the Deathstar signed within names
I am He, you obey to
Dying through the will of Kosmos
- take this Storm with you!

Ageless...
Fire holds the Wind you breed
Bleed once more...

Rest with the scars, Kaos needs you!
Fire I am, fire you breed
- take this Ageless with you....
