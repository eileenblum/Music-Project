Oh yes fathers, I've followed the Beast
for He's my beautiful, primal Bloodking
You deny and call Him odious,
you deny His strength, but time couldn't kill

His shadow fades... I die in his sleep
Deathdrops cover his sigh... I die in his sleep...
and with the stone cold sickness..
He took me

Darkest spheres have welcomed me, the blessed, truly given path

Come forth, lurkers of the sacred,
is your will indeed so strong?

(Oh yes, I've followed my Beast...)

Please me, a knife to my chest,
I want my body filled with holes
Oh, I want your lips, after you hang me on the rope
...breed in me

I've overdosed myself with this pain
and eternity will not decline it...
Grant me thy hand... burn within me
I seek for Thee, deep down to internal hellgleams, for eternal enlightened

Dead... spiritualized in the Devil's icon
