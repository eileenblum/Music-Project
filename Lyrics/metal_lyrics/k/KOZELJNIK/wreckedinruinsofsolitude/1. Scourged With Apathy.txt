Behold the horizon!! - hewn apart.
...you: first apparition thereafter...
The other: yours, the Nothing.
Scourged in depth, now dare and see -
mirror reflection gives an altered shape,
skin merged in White, your blood congealed...

And your Nothing crawls,
at the end of your shivering voyage.
Dragging down a clod of Flesh,
or an offal &amp; disgust of the shameful one?!

In cold fog it disappears again.
Lifeless, yet widen in unknown...

You're so empty now,
So damn lost with a joy of being Human!
...be gone now, let this final dream gives
what you strived for, all the lifewater you swallow...

I wonder how long will you deprive me from breathing...
