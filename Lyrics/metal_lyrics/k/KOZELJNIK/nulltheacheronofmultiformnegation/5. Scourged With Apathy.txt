Behold the horizon, hewn apart
You: first apparition thereafter

The other: yours, the Nothing
Scourged in depth, now dare and see

Mirror reflection gives an altered shape
Skin merged in white, your blood congealed

And your Nothing crawls at the end of your shivering voyage
Dragging down a clod of flesh or an offal and disgust of the shameful one

In cold fog it disappears again
Lifeless, yet widen in unknown

You're so empty now, so damn lost with a joy of being human

Be gone now, let this final dream gives
What you strived for, all the lifewater you swallow

I wonder how long will you deprive me from breathing
