Protruding seeds of the fallen
shall ever flourish on the mortal soil
And cast out the light from the hearts
of those willing to transgress my path

May their cries echo through the void
For I bleed their Reversal

Bestow upon me, queer reign of nether
Speak through me, in thousand, thousand tongues
Through the pores of nights awake me!
Oh, let thy sermon be cherished!

In Void's light, an infinite disgrace
shall storm down upon all their kindred
May their cries echo through the void
For I bleed their Reversal

Thus all the spirits walked blind behind
Wrung by agonizing quest, one after one
And never would they reach the source
Unleashed, yet shapeless, shunned from sight

Up the scale of emptiness
Tragic souls remain in the outer
Distant and frightened,
with hearts alone left bloodless
