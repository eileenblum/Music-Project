Hear the wind's whisper in the shadow deep?
Once forgotten now emerged to avail
A scornful spell he casts, while night he drags
Severance of dreams (wrecked and slain)

Its virtue immensely shaped aura of beings
Where breath of the last sun's spat out
And moon rays have quietly fallen
o'er the graves of remembrance long

Rivers run low
deep underneath the earthen soil
Within their waters grim
Such horrid truth untold they withold

Blood runs low
yet the world appears without end
Dweller in the deepest deep,
Thy vision perplexed beheld

Dying lights, teal, then grey, inwrought with shadows lay
Doom to all and a rise to fall
Circles of souls senile, dull, estranged
Dead and gone and no roots remain

From a far, begotten, pulsing energy of ages has come
as from a time of sullen age of yore undone
Beneath the earth's core perfidious, vast Abyss loathes
Enraptured breed unsilent, unleashing its scorn
