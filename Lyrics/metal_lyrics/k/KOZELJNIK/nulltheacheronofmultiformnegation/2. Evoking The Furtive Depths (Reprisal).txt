"He who sought was the One who found
and thus endured ere long All was but Dust and silenceâ¦"

He, who revealed thus,
was crowned in deep clouded ghastliness
Worshipped by arts
that razored shape of Him in their carnal
And In his lake of spit
Cleansed, indulging and drunk with lust
Forever cast out spirit of the earth
from their poisoned wombs.

Last tears of the presence aforeknown
have filled his cup with enduring sorrow.
As He, with His eyes by darkness inflamed,
gazed upon the shores once luminous.

And whereas the matter of all Evil appeared the shadow of Him
He baptized the Reversal of I.
Of all the worthless sacrifices judged by His hand,
not a soul was ever reborn in bliss

By the horrid path with Alongside Death to redeem,
Banish all the hearts that in secrecy weep
With no light to emerge everafter
And, with Claws of Shame, tear the dawn

No thought carries figures away from their shells
No mourning will ever claim the fallen spirit
"In Him, We who sought, in Him delight We found
and thus laved in the waters of Individuum"
