Through the cold breaths once called: the living

Abandoned the carnal shape of mortal into light-path
Darkened by the shades, strong virtue, S.A.T.A.N. majestic

Once... forsaken man believed God, in own plague arise and fell

Where voice of yours echoes through the mist, a deaf listener awaits
And he, behold, poorly tries your words to serve, as they never appear

Once... forsaken man believed God, in own plague arise and fell

Glorifying, seeing you as highest, the trace without a reach
Yet stabbed you cry, tragically remained

Where voice of yours echoes through the mist, a deaf listener awaits
And he, behold, poorly tries your words to serve, as they never appear
