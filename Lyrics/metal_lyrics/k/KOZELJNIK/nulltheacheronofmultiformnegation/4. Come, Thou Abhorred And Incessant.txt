Come forth Spirit of arcane, Lava!
Formless god of putrid aeons
Eldest spawn, father of lies
Urge of the sick, spasm of the current.

Behold the pallor of the autumn sky
And wisdom of the age long gone, inhale!
Engirdled with the longevity of purity
Oh, such godlessness of Reason..

Now inflame the world.. Worm!
Earth is yours to devour
Forge thy way of savage Rigorism
Condemn the shining light of folly.

I am the Source
Faceless judgement of unruling scepters
Shred thy skin and crave my wisdom
Source is I. I shall endure..

And now, that the Old Blood dies,
new one shall be born
Ever-saturating the veinâ¦.
â¦.of Old.
