Hopes, remorses
Like yours and mine
I found this meanings
Living my life.

I doubted the good man when I was down
And I felt so afraid that I could never win
Crying and waiting.
I asked for the star to obey to my will
And I tryied to escape from the moments of hate
Running and hiding.

Love and hate, trust and betrail
Fire and water, corage and fear
Demons and angels, the sun and the moon
This is my life" , or maybe is not.

Hope was my lonely friend, I trusted
In you again with my blinded eyes.
Hate you will strike again, haunting
In my mind, beating up my will.
All the hate in me, is bitting now my heart
And my restlless soul.
And I'll return defeat, to hide
Shadows land where I lived before.

The time is to hate
To seek memorize
To kill what you feel.

Hopes, remorses
Like yours and mine
I found this meanings
Living my life.
