There are too many questions
And not too many answers
If you'll try to find the essence
You'll find everywhere silence.

I am asking who we are
Why we're living why, the day is after night
Who created us, who's the father
Of the Earth of sky and red fire.

Those searches to insaine
Simbol of human nature
Those searches are in vain
Are simbols of our lifes.

Who conquers the time?
It's all a lie
It's a special lie
It's A WASTE OF TIME"

My eyes, will see, the lies"

Running for eternity
I am listening to the voices from the past
Who are praying for relief
From this endless pain of hoping and crying.

Those searches to insaine
Simbol of human nature
Those searches are in vain
Are simbols of our lifes.
