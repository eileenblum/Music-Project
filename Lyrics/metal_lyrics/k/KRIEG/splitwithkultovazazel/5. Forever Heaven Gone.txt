Red walls drip the blood of jesus christ denied
He's in your head
Now...Die

Weep for your god's throne
He is a lie
With this fear
Day of darkness, Arise...

All life is pain
Forever, deny
Engulf my hate
In this never ending
Dream

Forever...Heaven...Gone...
We...Want...Jesus...Dead...

Thoughts of a new life come together
I want to see Satan laughing
For this new millennium dying

Lie, dead, facedown, ashamed for he is the king of the Jews...
