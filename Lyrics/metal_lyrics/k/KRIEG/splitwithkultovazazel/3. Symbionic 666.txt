Our power is one
Red eyes of hate march onward
Pulse of fear is thick with pain

Fear turned to hate, my misery
Lust, for death with perverted praise

In, my, own ashes
I stand here, without a soul

Gag on your own vomit - blood tainted
Eye's full of blood - glazed stare
Awake to the world - as black as night
Hail him your new creator - the mech world

Lost...plagued...broken...

No more control
Your host has taken over
Symbionic 666

Fear turned to hate, my misery
Lust, for death with perverted praise

What have you taken
Alone with death surrounding

I have been possessed - Satan
Awake to the world - as black as night
Rid this disease - festering
Death is only the beginning

Lost, plagued, and broken
