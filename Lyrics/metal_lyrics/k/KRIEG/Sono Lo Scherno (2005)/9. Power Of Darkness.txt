Power of Darkness fills the land
This evil incarnate the devils hand
Minions of hell blacken the sky
Christians of God are about to die

From the north Ice and flood
From the south holy blood
From the east a witches birth
From the west the end of the earth

Burning bodies on the ground
Sadistic curse a horrid sound
The ones of Christ I summon your death
Destroying your sight and shredding your flesh

From the north Ice and flood
From the south holy blood
From the east a witches birth
From the west the end of the earth
