It's so hard not to think
That what joined us
Was the same that divided us
And forced us to go further apart
You can't save me, what d' you want from me?
Help me smile in this endless sea
I need to feel that I can't forget
That everything I see is
Towards the light
Towards the pain
I wish to know that now it's the end
I will refuse the false happiness
Crucified by loneliness
I feel it's inside me
Speaking inside me
Screaming inside me
And it's taking part of me
You can't save me, what d' you want from me?
Help me smile in this endless sea
I need to feel that I can't forget
That everything I see is
Towards the light
Towards the pain
I wish to know that now it's the end
You can't hide what you want from me
Injecting all your poison in me
