Seized behind the door of a labyrinth
I look everywhere and I don't find any way
I can feel that my breath is ending
This is a nightmare from which I can't awake
Where is the labyrinth's door?
Going out from here, this is a nightmare
Living like that, I haven't got much time
I can't find the doors that open my way
This nightmare doesn't end
I don't see anything the light switched off
I turn and turn disorientated
I can't find the way to go away
This is a nightmare from which I can't awake
Going out from here, this is a nightmare
Living like that, I haven't got much time
I can't find the doors that open my way
This nightmare doesn't end
I cannot find the way
I haven't got much time
I can't find the way
