They evoke the belief for a god
So occult and imperceptible
Lie against our understanding
They pronounce their rules to dominate
Thrown to hell's gates
For thinking differently
Rejected by heaven
For an insane and damn soul
Holy book from heaven
If you don't believe it's true
It will proclaim the genocide
Living to die, we don't know the truth
The faith in his god is not for me
Thrown to hell's gates
For thinking differently
Rejected by heaven
For an insane and damn soul
Followers of the holy faith
Instilling their truth
Humiliating happiness
Is this what you call faith?
Living to die, we don't know the truth
The faith in his god is not for me
