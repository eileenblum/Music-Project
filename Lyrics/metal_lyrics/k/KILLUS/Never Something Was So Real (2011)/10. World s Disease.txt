LetÊ¼s go and come into my mind
ItÊ¼s the way where you can spread
Your seeds under the ashes
Your skin under the ashes
Predestination is domination
ItÊ¼s the way that you can take
Predestination is domination
We fall with worldÊ¼s disease
Groan turns black in your sorrow
WeÊ¼ll fight like motherfuckers in the night
The devils wanna to play with us
Predestination is domination
ItÊ¼s the way that you can take
Predestination is domination
We fall with worldÊ¼s disease
Groan turns black in your suffer
WeÊ¼ll fight like motherfuckers in the night
The devils wanna to play with us
WeÊ¼ll never stop to fight with our guns
The devils wanna to play with us
Here is the worldÊ¼s disease
ItÊ¼s time to devilÊ¼s creation
Here is the worldÊ¼s disease
ItÊ¼s time to devilÊ¼s reflection
WeÊ¼ll fight like motherfuckers in the night
The devils wanna to play with us
WeÊ¼ll never stop to fight with our guns
The devils wanna to play with us
