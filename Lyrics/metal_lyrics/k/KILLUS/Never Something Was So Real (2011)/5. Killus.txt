The train that would derail in front of us
With the only idea to die killing
Drowned in the fire of our rejected heart
And inspired by this 4 souls
Like aliens in your world
We are the 4 mother fuckers
We hurt ourselves years and years nonstop
You won't like what we believe
This is Killus
You can try it one more time, my death is your sway
This is Killus
From that place so improper for the rest
We encourage each other and arise
As we see inside ourselves
We understood that nobody would follow us
We love being so different from the rest
And we just don't care what you think
You feel that
Everybody's got something
About you
You take advantage of me
And look what a whore you are
I'm a god for you
