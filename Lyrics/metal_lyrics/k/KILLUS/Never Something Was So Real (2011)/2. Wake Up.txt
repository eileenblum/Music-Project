You were opening your mouth
Little by little putting every fly
In danger without listening
To any words with some intention
You didn't even feel the cold
You couldn't see my shadow
You drowned lying
You killed saying
Just wake up
Acquiring a big power
Without knowing that everything burns
Showing your teeth
Just before we meet
You believed to be a hidden fist
In the darkness
You were a big puppet
Made of vanity
The cryings that you caused
Burnt the worlds that you demolished
And now it's time for the payment
It's time to wake up
Just wake up
Wake up and come with me
Wake up you are not alive
I will take you to a place
Where you'll never stop to scream
