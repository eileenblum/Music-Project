Breaking dawn after a long night being unable to sleep
Screams will drive me crazy at the moment to leave
An holocaust is coming crushing the existence of this place
We are ready for our names to create vehemence
It's the howl of my shot, where is the human's pain?
Everything is disappearing, it's the end of humanity
Misery invades our sensibility
Humankind falls down without any necessity
We'll fight without rest, extermination of this place
Apocalyptic end announced where the fuck is your god?
Where is your god?
It's the howl of my shot, where is the human's pain?
Everything is disappearing, it's the end of humanity
