Everything starts
In something that never ends
Waiting for
The sign of my exile
I never stop looking for
A reason to find
I don't stop following
Always have where to go
Thousands of fallen angels
They will break your scar
It is in your heart
And then you will bleed
You'll never be free
Everything ends
Across the universe
Hoping for
Everything to start again
Angels are wanting me
Their glances reflect my end
They will break your scar
It is in your heart
And then you will bleed
You'll never be free
Trying to run away, it's the end
Thinking that anything won't be the same , it's the end
Drawing a cold smile, it's the end
Feeling that anything won't be the same , it's the end
