I feel something inside me
I feel something cold
I can't hear your cryings
the lights are turning off
Towards the pain
Towards forgiveness
All I wanna know is after
That sinister light
What is what you want?
You can't escape
What is what you want?
Never something was so real
I'm finding myself
Everything falls around me
The souls are disappearing
Result of this sacrifice
This is the song of my pain, it is buried deep in a gray sky
I cannot forget, it is buried deep in a gray sky
