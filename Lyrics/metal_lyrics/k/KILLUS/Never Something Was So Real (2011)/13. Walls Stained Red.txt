Following your steps
After getting dark
Dragging my glance
To the desire after going mad
This gloomy room without exit
Is gonna burn
You will never escape
From the end of this final nightmare
Drag me to hell
I don't care where you are
You have to know that I need you to be here
I'll come back from the shadows
I'll look for you and I know that you'll be there
Walls stained red
Is all you can see
Close your eyes
Don't say you want to know what you're gonna see
You hear steps and steps coming closer
You will hear his excited breath
Nearer and nearer you
Try to remember how you must escape
A horrible attraction
Inside this room
The heaven's call arrived
It is time to leave
Shocking obsession
By this dark sensation
