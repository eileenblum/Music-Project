Fear of feeling
That I'll never stop falling
An uncertain hole
Hides an intense pleasure
Bled by the fright
Of seeing that everything ended
I can't stand not having you here
A beautiful light will emerge from your eyes
To look for a direct way to boundless love
Surviving for a dream that I lived
We will escape towards a paradise where we will be able to dream
Come and save my soul from this sad situation
Cross the land of Babylon in search of my affliction
The sadness begins to overcome without fear
Come closer to me and break my grief
My desperation starts
It is getting dark in here
Wandering without knowing
Where I'll find you
Longing for a whisper
Towards this cold place
Anxiety bursts out to take control on me
Come and save my soul from this sad situation
Cross the land of Babylon in search of my affliction
The sadness begins to overcome without fear
Come closer to me and break my grief
A beautiful light will emerge from your eyes
to look for a direct way to boundless love
