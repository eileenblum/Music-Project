My neck is covered with a rope
While I fix my eyes on you
Something so intense that i feel the weight
Something so intense inside of me
Manipulated by an illusion
That will never see reality save, save, save yourself.
Save, save, save, save your beloved
You'll fade away like everyone else
Pray, pray, pray, pray for your life
You'll walk away from self-destruct
You're scared, stop thinking and imagining
In the careless world where we live
You're a prisoner, it's the path of the forgotten
Now I have to heal your satiety
Manipulated by an illusion
That will never see reality save, save, save yourself.
Save, save, save, save your beloved
You'll fade away like everyone else
Pray, pray, pray, pray for your life
You'll walk away from self-destruct
Every time that you go
Every time that you fall
In my empty world it will never get light
