Nobody's gonna be oneself
Because now it's too late
This is the call of destiny
We can have no sympathy
Anthem sung to heaven, symbol of determination
Fist raised fearless asking for devastation
Suffering, it is pain, this is the call of eradication
Suffering, it is pain, grey sky falling by dysfunction
The beginning of the fallen man
With no soul to supplicate
Army with no compassion
Driven by destruction
Anthem sung to heaven, symbol of determination
Fists raised fearless asking for devastation
Suffering, it is pain, this is the call of eradication
Suffering, it is pain, grey sky falling by dysfunction
The new army without fear
Forced us to submission
Missing without a place where to arrive
Missing after a devastating holocaust
Suffering, it is pain, this is the call of eradication
Suffering, it is pain, grey sky falling by dysfunction
