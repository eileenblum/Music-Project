You were my existence
Remember to not forget you
Feel that everything starts
When I get up
You see my stars falling
From the great sky
You can see my universe
Everything starts to end
Everything starts to flow
The distress that I felt
The end that I faced
My blood ended up
My short breath ceased for you
You wished that we had met
In another context
All of your glances start
Feeling something new
Listen to my voice
Everything starts to end
Everything starts to flow
The distress that I felt
The end that I faced
My blood ended up
My short breath ceased for you
I can't stand all that
You've always expected of me
The distress that I felt
My blood ended up
My short breath ceased for you
You think that everything ends
You don't know exactly why
You think that it is the end
Of something that never ends
You think that everything ends
It never ends
You can't know why this world
Will have to end this way
