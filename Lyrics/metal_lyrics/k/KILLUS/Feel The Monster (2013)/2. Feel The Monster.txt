Welcome to our dimension
You'll discover reality
The visions of our monster nation
Will catch you in your dreams

We feel your fear tearing your insides
We see your soul is fading, is fading

You won't be alive
4, 3, 2, 1

Feel the monster
He stalks you
You're not alive

Feel the monster
He knows that
You lost your life

We feel your fear tearing your insides
We see your soul is fading, is fading

Feel the monster
He stalks you
You're not alive

Feel the monster
He knows that
You lost your life

He stalks you
He catches you

Feel the monster
He stalks you
You're not alive

Feel the monster
He knows that
You lost your life

Feel the monster
He stalks you
You're not alive

Feel the monster
He knows that
You lost your life
