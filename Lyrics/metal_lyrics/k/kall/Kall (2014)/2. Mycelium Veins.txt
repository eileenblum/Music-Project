The fumes of blood and wine
intoxicates me
Boiling black bile
emerging through mycelium veins

The path is crooked
but goes straight forward
Through the vast emptiness
embracing there plains

Hear yourself shatter
as a symphony to the void
Orchestrated silence
breaking the chains
