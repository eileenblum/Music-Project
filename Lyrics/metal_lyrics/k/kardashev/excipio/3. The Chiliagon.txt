Creation without
A true visualization.
One thousand new worlds.

Internal.
External.

Wisdom was forward.
Confused representation
Centralized.

Spacial concepts had since dissolved.
Walkway to the infinite.
Mankind made humble
At sight of endlessness.

One of one million six hundred thousand
Will multiply exponentially.

Oscillating light -
A speed no longer challenged.
Reality folds.

Cyclic oscillator.
Infinite power source.

Removed causality.
No understanding.
Yet they sought outlying worlds
And never intervening space.
Faith placed in the unknown.
No understanding.

Distance fades away,
A newly flawed conception.
Precipice. A door.
