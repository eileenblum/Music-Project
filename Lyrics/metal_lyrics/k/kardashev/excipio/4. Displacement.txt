Immersed in emptiness.
The mass of other bodies pushed aside.
Soft echoing of solitary footsteps.

This hollow station is alienation.
Off world advance
Had trapped her withing.

Where had such wonder gone?
Every hope had been taken for granted.
The fabric of reality torn apart.

Alone and unprepared.
No restitution.
Mortality of flesh
Is realized.

Sphere
Of exotic matter
Folds the fabric of the universe.

"Know us not by our names
But by the dark that created us."

Pale flesh abominations
Brought forth from other worlds.
Initial contact was
Met with aggression.

Each being spoke with ten voices,
Droning words from their sides.
The depths of space had been
Named as their father.

Cold.
Empty.
Void.

Displacement.
To be alone.
Alone.

Cold.
Empty.
Void.
The dark that created us.
