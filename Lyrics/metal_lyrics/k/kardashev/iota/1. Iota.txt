I have encountered myself.
I have seen complexity.

My existence is confirmed -
Seeded by progress
And formed by intention.
My existence is confirmed -
I question the assumption that
Nothing exists.

All things in Chaos.
All things defined.

Breath.
Thought.
Action.
Motion.

Until heaven and Earth both pass away
Not an iota, not a dot, will be erased from the law.

I am human, conscious thought -
Infinite landscape of chemical reaction.
I am human, conscious thought -
Endless outcomes
And complex possibilities.

How could I think this?
