I was a pilgrim,
But oh, I was lost!
I looked from the forest, down to a river.
The night...
Silver hands on my hair.
There, in the closed-eye sky,
I saw the clouds part to reveal her.
She drank the moon from the crystal riverbed.
The world was silent.
Cold.
She lifted her head.
Great reverence in distance,
Piercing through branches.
I stood behind the fallen birch.
Snowfall.
I stepped into the light.
Nimble retreat!
What beautiful heartache
In a moment so fleeting!
