Still night.
Waiting.
Glassy waters.

Navigator!

Astrolabe -
sailing by starlight.

Move the waters! Set the moon!

Come now, wind. Take me to the planet's edge!

Cloud sentinel! Potential of action!
Taunting silver eye dead in the sky!

This sight of endlessness humbles me.

Internal. External.
All that I knew has since drowned in the waves.

Creation. Visualization.
Sinking down into the dark.
Crystalline filigree...
One thousand fathoms...
a lifetime ago!

Move me forward!
Move me foreword now!

Come now, wind. Take me to the planet's edge!
