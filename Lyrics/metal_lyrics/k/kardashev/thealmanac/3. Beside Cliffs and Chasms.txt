The view given to me is vast.
Seemingly infinite.
If there is an end, I do not know it.
There is no curve of Earth.
Just the unending axis that crosses the cradle.
Where cardinals are born,
And the last frost of winter makes way
For the first rose to grow.
Hands on the edge of the cliff.
Stone-texture, awake! Great depths of land, whisper!
Here I stand as a stranger,
Yet each crack in the Earth
I have seen here before.
Hear me, fluttering winds. Take back the breaths that I'm made of.

I cannot see more, yet I can see clearly.
All things that I have lost I can now find again.

My language never heard.
My name soon forgotten.
Power above, cradled below -
Flawless in design!
A shadow!
Sun-zealous sky!
Sidling earth!
12389,
Place of my birth!
"Hear me, fluttering winds. Take back the breaths that I'm made of."

I cannot see more, yet I can see clearly.
All things that I have lost I can now find again.
