Once, long ago,
With eyes eclipsed -
My thousand-fold mind cried
"I have all answers!"
I saw shadow.
Shadow, my law.
O, wavering journey
And infinite circle.
My thoughts swell with the sun
As I enter the room of my birth.
I saw shadow.
Shadow, my law.
Every footstep
Returns to the dirt.
Two clear voices -
"Accelerate replication!"
"Authorization denied!"

Please! Come now, wind!
Bring back what I've lost!
I see shadow!
Shadow, my law!
I'll drink in the stars
And then hunt down the moon!

Swaying light, shine.
Distance, fade away.
Opening door,
O, shrinking sun,
Compress!
A diamond!
Sundering roar,
Opening eyes,
Ignite!
Be still!
What place is this?
Ia raue oun soal.

I stood so still.
Vead cuarne courpaion.

Where have I gone?
Laj o zeov ial andea.

What words are these?
Alunea, dag ua nai.

When I returned, all the seeds had grown without me.
When I returned, all the streams, they flowed without me.
When I returned, all the trees, they fell without me.
When I returned, all life came and went without me.

Alunea.
