Intentional omission.
Quiet, fertile ground.
Unfinished thought...
Hovering word -
Rising up from the Earth.

Steps with no echo.
Breath heard by no one.

Wake up!
Waking!

Dried dirt and grit in our teeth.
Cracks in the mud on our hands.
Breathing out the dust in our lungs -
Unity without a sound.
Until the light takes us,
Until the dawn...
Bleary eyes that see the sun -
Unity without a sound.
We step, and the clouds move!

What place is this?
Should, and should not -
Swaying field of convention.
Knowing and doing simply to choose.

Follow!
Fall!
Stand!
