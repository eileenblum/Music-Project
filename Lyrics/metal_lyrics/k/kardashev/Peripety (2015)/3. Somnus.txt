This is where all things are forgotten -
Craft of our hands feels nothing as
We fade away.
Meaninglessness -
The first creation.
In every action, in every breath,
Strength of illusion.

Torn in two -
The sky breaks like a seed
Spreading its blueprint on the Earth.
All things beyond the man-made
Culminate and fall...
Passionate. Intentional.
Assault your lungs with the greatest of all war cries -
We are! We exist!

I, the offset -
The only word we know.
Light, alignment -
A truth that can be known.

Veil held across the sun,
Only we can burn you!

This is when all things can be sacred -
Held to fire.
Removal of all that we know.

Torn in two -
The sky breaks like a seed
Spreading its blueprint on the Earth.
All things beyond the man-made
Culminate and fall...
Passionate. Intentional.
Assault your lungs with the greatest of all war cries -
We are! We exist!
