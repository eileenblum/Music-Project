Be still and at peace!

What is the equation of this?
What is the sum of all parts?
Here, all things grow on their own.
Earliest of mornings -
Awareness before birth.

It was there -
In my dreaming...
Pressed tot he ground.
Every law, and all I had felt
Dissolved into sound.

Now I have come to know
That all of this is meaningless
As I fall deeper into love,
Waking from this slumber.
