Wake!
This is silence and silence is still!
Blossomed fist! O, altruist!
I am immortal. I am dead.
I have everything. I have nothing.
I am immortal. I am dead.
I have everything. I have nothing at all.
Nothing at all.

At each core, soft approximation.
Delicate abstraction.
Function and form.
So maintained -
Ceasing acquisition.
True manifestation as I become dust.

Great reversal!
This - a fleeting formation of matter!
Self defined!

We are immortal. We are dead.
We have everything. We have nothing.
We are immortal. We are dead.
We have everything. We have nothing at all.
Nothing at all.

Yet now my eyes on a darkened mirror -
Seeing everything in part.

We are awake!

Millions stare back! All of our kind!
We will know each other as we are known!
