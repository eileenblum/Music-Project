The structures of this planet
Have become complete;
Survived the birth
Of harnessing
Earth's energy.
Calculations
Have brought this civilization
To global scales,
And they prevailed

Isolated cultures
Form a nucleus -
Breaking social strain.
Opposing thought
Released.

Past their organic lattices
And those of their beasts
They have harnessed the technique
Of using the unseen
To utilize,

Energy consumption is at
Four times ten
To the nineteenth power.

Energy consumption is at
The Earth's command.

The dominant race on Earth
Has shown resistance
To eminent progress.
Some sat silent.
Can a race so volatile
Reach our advancement?
Can they trace us?

During cultural fusion,
Many became one
Global nation -
They fought themselves.

The structures of this planet
Will soon be obsolete,
They'll lift a skyward eye,
To a new source of energy,

Exploration of global advancement
Integral for stellar achievement.
