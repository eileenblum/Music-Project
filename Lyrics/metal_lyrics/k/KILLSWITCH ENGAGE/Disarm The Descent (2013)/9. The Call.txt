The sound of footsteps approaching
A storm of shadows reveal a figure forlorn
Whispering voices that slither into our ears,
As temptations sings and beckons us to fall
Under the skin, the blood begins to crawl
Rush to the heart, drain it from the soul
Come face to face with all you can't escape
Will you hold your ground or turn away

Release your inhibitions and answer to the call

The sun shines down to reveal a true image
Salvation sings and shows us all we know
The road is treacherous and lonely
Filled with the empty inventions of the soul
Under disillusion, run from confrontation
Or do we heed the judgment call?

Release your inhibitions and answer to the call

Leave behind this shell of flesh and bone
In the end we will answer to the call
The burning question remains - how much is too much to give?
Do your wings have the strength to carry on?
When we see redemption, how long will we wait for deliverance?
It takes everything to keep from falling now
Let go

Release your inhibitions and answer to the call

Leave behind this shell of flesh and bone
In the end we will answer to the call
