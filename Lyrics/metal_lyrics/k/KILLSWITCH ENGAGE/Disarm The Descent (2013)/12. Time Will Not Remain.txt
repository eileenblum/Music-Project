These are the days our lives will change and we will see our worlds collide
Life is a journey throughout the years that pass a lesson to be learned
There is a purpose to all that we encounter in this existence
What builds us up may one day break us down

These days, search your heart
These days, let courage overtake you
This precious time is slipping through our fingers
Become the change you have been searching for

These are the days,
Our lives will change and time will not remain
These are the days,
Right before our eyes, we see our worlds collide

These days, there is hope
These days, never letting go
The definition of existence is to be aware of consciousness

These are the days,
Our lives will change and time will not remain
These are the days,
Right before our eyes, we see our worlds collide
Worlds collide

None of us should be thought of
As anything less than a potential to change the world

These are the days,
Our lives will change and time will not remain
These are the days,
Right before our eyes, we see our worlds collide
