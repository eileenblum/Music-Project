Step back to see the vision
Seduction of our minds
The skin becomes illusion
She pulls me down and I fall behind
The weakness of flesh is to settle for less than we
Have the potential to be
Song of the sirens call

There is a fire within her eyes
Blinding my senses
(Now I am searching)
For what's beyond the flames

What drags us down to ruin
Where is the power that ignites within
Seeking the substance that can't be corrupted or changed
We remain beyond the flame

Her dark embrace will suffocate
Choking my senses
(Now I am searching)
For what's beyond the flames

There is a fire within her eyes
Blinding my senses
(Now I am searching)
For what's beyond the flames

Now it's just a touch, then she feels a rush
Her dark seduction will suffocate

Her dark embrace will suffocate
Choking my senses
(Now I am searching)
For what's beyond the flames

There is a fire within her eyes
Blinding my senses
(Now I am searching)
For what's beyond the flames
