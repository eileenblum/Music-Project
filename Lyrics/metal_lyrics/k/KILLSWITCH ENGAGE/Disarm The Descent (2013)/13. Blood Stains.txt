[Bonus Track]A river runs through the path you walk
Got to find a way to carry on through this
Ghosts from the past like a noose around your throat
A constant reminder of all the lies
Haunted by the darkness that follows every move you make
That feeling, nothing will ever be the same,
But you're the only one to blame
The blood stains

Disarm the lies that follow you
Will the truth soon see you through?

Disarm the lies

Down through the deeper water you're choking
No escaping
Retribution will find you

Disarm the lies that follow you
Will the truth soon see you through?
Disarm the pain that's burning through
Have no power over you

Drowning
As the pressure builds, will you make amends?
Calling
Hear the voices sing, cast into disgrace
Falling
Can't conceal the blood that stains your hands
Someday
Will you break the curse and face your hell?

Disarm the lies that follow you
Will the truth soon see you through?
Disarm the pain that's burning through
Have no power over you
Disarm
