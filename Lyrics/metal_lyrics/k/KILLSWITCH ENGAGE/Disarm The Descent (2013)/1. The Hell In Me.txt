Fall down into the chaos
Staring into the depths of pain, darkness and suffering
I will not be moved from this place, inside of me
Until I understand this part of me that bleeds and captures my spirit
If it's the death of me, then I will loosen its grip.

Protect me from the hell that burns inside me.
No one can see, this is the hell in me.
The hell in me.

Bring light into the darkness.
Awaken and stir this war within us all.
Reveal my true intentions.

No one can see this is the hell in me
Will you set me free?
This is the hell in me.

Lead me out of the darkness.
Strengthen and protect the voice that makes no sound.
Suffer and bleed for me.
Pulled from the hell that is in me.
Set me free.

Protect me from the hell that burns inside me.
No one can see, this is the hell in me.
Will you set me free?
This is the hell in me.
