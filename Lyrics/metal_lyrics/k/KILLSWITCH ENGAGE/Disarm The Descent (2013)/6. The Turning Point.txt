In these days that pass before me
There was an anxious feeling that would hold me down
Tearing me inside
Bleeding my spirit

This is the turning point, the rising of the tide
No fear inside
This is the change that takes the suffering away
No more wasting time

Face the pain that suffocates
As the past returns to torment me
Wallow in my scars
Save me before I break

This is the turning point, the rising of the tide
No fear inside
This is the change that takes the suffering away
No more wasting time

Find the strength to maintain
Give me, give me a reason to believe
Search for truth that will not change
Give me, give me a reason to believe
[x2]

Find the strength to maintain
Search for truth that will not change
