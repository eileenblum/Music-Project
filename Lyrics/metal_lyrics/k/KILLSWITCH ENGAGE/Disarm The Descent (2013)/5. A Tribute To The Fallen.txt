These are the times that will challenge our resolve
Living in the days of the fallen
A voice that once spoke of strength and hope,
Now sings the dirge of the hopeless

You cannot break this love with hate
A tribute to the fallen
Your choice is made so go your way
A tribute to the fallen

With a new dawn we rise in renewed strength
Knowing we've just begun to fight this war within

You cannot break this love with hate
A tribute to the fallen
Your choice is made so go your way
A tribute to the fallen

Walk the path you've chosen
Our faith remains unbroken
Even if we die tonight
This is an endless fight
Our spirits will live on in the hearts of those we leave behind
With broken bones and our will of stone
In the end we will not stand alone

You cannot break this love with hate
A tribute to the fallen
Your choice is made so go your way
A tribute to the fallen
A tribute to the fallen
A tribute to the fallen
