This day will resound in our melodies
The voices of fate
A testament to all we hope for
They will learn of the passion and tragedy
That lies in wait, when they stand up
Stand up against the onslaught

Nothing could ever tear us apart

Our spirit is never ending
I'll be the protection when you fall
Our spirit is never ending
So tell them it's us, us against the world

This catastrophe will serve to redeem our purpose
Do you believe, they could never come between us

Our spirit is never ending
I'll be the protection when you fall
Our spirit is never ending
So tell them it's us against the world
(It's us against the world)

The saga unfolds, the legends of old will guide us all
The crack of the skull, the blood and the soul
We heed the endless call

Our spirit is never ending
(Never ending)
I'll be the protection when you fall
Our spirit is never ending
(Never ending)
So tell them it's us against the world
(It's us against the world)
