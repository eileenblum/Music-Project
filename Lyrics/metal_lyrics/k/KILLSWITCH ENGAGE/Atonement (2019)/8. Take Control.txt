In the darkness swallowed into the night
Trapped in the clutches of my indecision
Falling further past the point of control
So desperate to cast away this feeling

Cry out for rescue
Cry out for relief and give me peace
There must be a way to stifle this decay
There must be a means, means to an end

When the fear and panic takes a hold
You must take control
When your sorrow drags you down below
Take control
(Take control)

No more wallowing, battle my constraints
I'm the sinner and the saint

When the fear and panic takes a hold
Look within your soul
When your sorrow drags you down below
You must take control
Your strength will unfold, take control

I must find a way
So my words can penetrate
And I pray that you understand
(You understand your pain someday)

When the fear and panic takes a hold
You must take control
When your sorrow drags you down below
You must take control

Look within your soul
Take control
