Bow down to no one
Resist the system

Lost in uncertainty, divided in our strife
No comprehension of the conflict of our lives
Become enslaved in a technological haze
In the crosshairs of a weapon
That dissuades our brains

The target is in site
Mental imprisonment
They'll take you down from the inside
(Inside)
Self-destruction on command

Resist â and fight back
Our minds â under attack
Destroy â their authority
And know your enemy

Protest â demonstrate
We must â retaliate
Bow down â to no one
And know your enemy

Locked and loaded, waiting to explode
Pawns of illusion subjugating to control

Resist â and fight back
Our minds â under attack
Destroy â their authority
And know your enemy

Protest â demonstrate
We must â retaliate
Bow down â to no one
And know your enemy

It runs much deeper than you think
You'll never see who pulls the strings
You've got to know, know your enemy
Force-fed illusions
In this world of confusion
You have to know, know your enemy

The target is in site

Bow down to no one
Resist the system
Bow down to no one
(Bow down to no one)
Resist the system and fight back

They can't subjugate a mind that's free
No more force-fed reality

Resist â and fight back
Our minds â under attack
Destroy â their authority
And know your enemy

Protest â demonstrate
We must â retaliate
Bow down â to no one
And know your enemy

They'll take you down from the inside
Resist and fight back
And know your enemy
