I never knew the words to say
At a loss, as the world was falling around me
I see that look upon your face
Feeling so desperate as we count down to dismay

How did it ever come to this?
Pick up the pieces and know something's got to give
Don't lose your faith
(Don't lose your faith)
Try to believe
(Try to believe)
That the ends will justify the means

Divided we've become, this fight has just begun
But I can't be the only one
Together we overcome with a truth they can't outrun
But I can't be the only one

I see that look upon your face
(Your face)
Feeling so desperate as we count down to dismay
How did this come to be?
There's so much more to this then what we all see

Don't lose your passion
(Your passion)
Don't lose your love

It can't just be only me
(Only me)
It must be us in unity

Divided we've become, this fight has just begun
But I can't be the only one
Together we overcome with a truth they can't outrun
But I can't be the only one

I can't do this on my own
What have we become when there is no love?
I gotta believe that things will change

And I believe things will change

Divided we've become, this fight has just begun
But I can't be the only one
Just begun, and overcome
But I can't be the only one

United we overcome
Undivided we are the sum
But I can't be the only one
