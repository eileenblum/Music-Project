Swallow the sun in shadows as they suck out the marrow
The hopeless suffer in the fear of tomorrow
We count the cost to measure it against our loss
The sacrifice of the innocent

Separation
The lie from the truth
(The lie from the truth)
Our division is our proof

We can't allow this to stand
Oppression on demand
Led by liars and thieves
As desperation bleeds
They brought us to our knees
So bite the hand that feeds

All their poisonous belief
Lead us only to grief
Led by liars and thieves
As desperation bleeds
They brought us to our knees
So bite the hand that feeds

Altercations spread through violent sanction
Mother give your children to the beast
The battles of the poor will soon be called to war
For the wealthy and their war machine

We can't allow this to stand
Oppression on demand
Led by liars and thieves
As desperation bleeds
They brought us to our knees
So bite the hand that feeds

Pushed to the breaking point
Awake from your slumber
Kick back the shroud that humanity's under
The beckoning call of our so called masters
Subjugate us to the brink of disaster
All for what cause?
To perpetuate their endless wars

We can't allow this to stand
Oppression on demand
Led by liars and thieves
As desperation bleeds
They brought us to our knees
So bite the hand that feeds

All their poisonous belief
Lead us only to grief
Led by liars and thieves
As desperation bleeds
They brought us to our knees
So bite the hand that feeds

Where do we go from here?
We won't go quietly
It must be the end of apathy
We let go of the grip of our sanity

What would you...
What would you kill for?
What would you...
What would you die for?

What would you...
What would you kill for?
What would you...
What would you die for?
