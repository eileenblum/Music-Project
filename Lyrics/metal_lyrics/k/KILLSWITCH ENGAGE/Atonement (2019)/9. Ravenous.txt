Flesh from flesh
To bring forth this endless quest
This endless quest

Yearning for something to consume
A long lost spirit to exhume
A hunger burns in me
An all consuming voracity

Flesh from flesh
(Flesh from flesh)
To bring forth this endless quest

Staring at your countenance
To seek beyond impermanence

Lost in translation, misconstrued
Forgive them all for what they do
I'm ravenous
(I'm ravenous)

Ravenous
In this vision beyond impermanence
Ravenous
For an undying truth in all of us

Cut down â deep below the dermis
Unwound â from the tangle of indoctrination
Breakdown â the message and the purpose
Fall down â to my knees in demarcation

I choose a life defined by evolving belief
A truth undefined is where I will find my peace

This undying desire

Ravenous
In this vision beyond impermanence
Ravenous
For an undying truth in all of us
Ravenous
For a new form of consciousness
