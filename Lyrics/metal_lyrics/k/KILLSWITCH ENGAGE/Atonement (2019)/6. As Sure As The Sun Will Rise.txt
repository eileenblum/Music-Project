Lay your hands upon me
Give me the certainty to fulfill my destiny
Fill my soul with light
As it courses through my veins like a river after rain

Healer
Seeker
True believer
Summon the storm to smite deceivers

Through the perils we face
(We overcome)
Through the treacherous days
(We overcome)
Nothing stands in our way
Sure as the sun will rise again

Take
My
Words
Let them feed humanity
A sacrifice to demonstrate
A willingness to take the hate
And use it as our strength

Healer
Seeker
True believer
Summon the storm to smite deceivers

Through the perils we face
(We overcome)
Through the treacherous days
(We overcome)
Nothing stands in our way
Sure as the sun will rise again

We gave our souls to the will of the fates tonight
With honor, the brave will live far beyond this life

Pulled from the darkness, reborn in light

Through the perils we face
(We overcome)
Through the treacherous days
(We overcome)
Nothing stands in our way
Sure as the sun will rise again

We overcome
Sure as the rising sun
