[feat. Chuck Billy]Abolition to this illusion
And all the monuments of hypocrisy

Burn them â burn them to the ground
Destroy them â they're useless to us now

Tear down reminders of a crownless king
This impostor claims authority
Indignation is closing in
You choose a war, a war you cannot win

No one â no one can save you now
Cast down â where no mercy can be found
No willingness to bow to a king without a crown
Where the virtuous can't be found

Defy you â to the depths you descend
I defy you â to the death we defend
Defy you â your rule will come to an end
I defy you â you've become the crownless king

The penitent pray for the downfall
Of your, of your reign
The warrior soul shall break the hold of constraints
In the end you will suffer

Defy you â to the depths you descend
I defy you â to the death we defend
Defy you â your rule will come to an end
I defy you â you've become the crownless king

This storied confusion, distorted and diluted
Will come undone when the balance shifts
And the framework breaks
The framework breaks

To the depths you descend
Become the crownless king
Defy you â I defy you
Defy you â we defy you
