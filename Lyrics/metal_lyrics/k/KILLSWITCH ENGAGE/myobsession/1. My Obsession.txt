She's my addiction, withdraws never end
The needle in my vein that I need to live
Her voice is compulsion when I call her name
Now I am burning inside an undying flame
Beautiful sleeper, know that I am watching

You will always be mine until my dying breath
Possessing my soul, you're my obsession

I can still see your eyes like burning stars
Even in you dreams we can't be torn apart

You will always be mine until my dying breath
Possessing my soul, you're my obsession
When I'm without you, I'm dying a slow death
Possessing my soul, you're my obsession

Wherever you are, I will follow
Now you know true love

Don't be afraid
We cannot be torn apart
Don't be afraid
I know I can change your heart
