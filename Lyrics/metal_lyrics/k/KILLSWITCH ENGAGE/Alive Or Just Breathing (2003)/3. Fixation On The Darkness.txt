Fixation on the darkness that engulfs this world
Drain the life force of our people, change
Return to the womb, new life
Lay your head to rest, mercy
To give you a peace of mind, lay your head to rest
Come together inside, this body is only a shell
Change, the only way we will survive
Light transfiguration of the soul, of the soul, of the mind
Tell them they will not hold us down, it's time for a change
