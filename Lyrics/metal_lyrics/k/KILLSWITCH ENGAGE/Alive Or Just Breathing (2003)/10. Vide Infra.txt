I have opened my eyes to see the world the surrounds me daily
I refuse to be led by the majority
Can't compromise I and I
To pass judgment
Judgment will be passed upon you
I will stand up for who I am
Never moved by condemnation
No one is placed higher than another
No matter race or creed or gender
We must teach forgiveness and compassion for all life
Through understanding of our differences
We will find respect for one another
We are all flesh and blood
I am not afraid to speak my mind
No matter the consequences
Stay true to yourself
Through the humble eyes of a child we will realize true equality
They can not take me from me
