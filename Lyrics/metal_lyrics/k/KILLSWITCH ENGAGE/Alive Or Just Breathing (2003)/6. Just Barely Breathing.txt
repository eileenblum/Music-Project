Descend into hysteria
Chaos of mankind but who is listening to the voice of hatred
Tortured souls lost so completely lost
Weakened in the concept of decline, deception
Are we alive or just breathing
Don't close your eyes, see the images
The sky weeps tonight, our bodies washed away
I am waiting for you, deliverance
The sun falls through the clouds
Hear my cry
