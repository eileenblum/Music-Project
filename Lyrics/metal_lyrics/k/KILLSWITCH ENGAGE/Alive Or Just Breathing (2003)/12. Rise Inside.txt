Rise inside (free your mind)
Raise your fist (to signify)
We stand in defiance of hatred and deception
If I stand alone I will fight for you
The time has come to make a difference
Why have we forsaken love
The time has come to raise our voices
So rise up and fight with me
Embrace what we have
It might be the last time
In this life (in this life)
We will rise (we will rise)
If we find the strength to unify
Hatred is a weakness
You become the victim
I believe love will overcome
Time has come to make a difference
Why have we forsaken one another
Time has come to raise our voices
So rise up and fight with me
Time has come to raise our voices
So rise up and fight with me
The time has come (the time has come)
The time has come (the time has come)
The time has come to rise inside
Rise inside
