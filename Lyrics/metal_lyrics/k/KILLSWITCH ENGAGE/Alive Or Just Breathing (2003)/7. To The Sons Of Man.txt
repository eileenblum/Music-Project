You son of man I am here as a witness
You son of man can't you see what burns inside me
This fire will consume as the flames purify
With the peace that passes understanding
This is my outcry
From dust to dust we will return
The flesh is temporary
The soul is eternal
Son of man can't you see
Son of man can't you save yourself
