Make me feel serenity when all is revealed
So easy to look back in life and question
But I must seek to find the strength
To push forward (forward)

Want to see what's so beautiful inside
As we drink of life
Absolve me, through your suffering

Make me feel serenity when all is revealed
So easy to look back in life and question
But I must seek to find the strength
To push forward (forward)

Teach me to inscribe these words on my heart
Cover me with the shadow of your hand

I will not lose myself in everything that tears me down
Because you stand by me
No one to blame
No one to blame for my transgressions

Teach me to inscribe these words on my heart
Cover me with the shadow of your hand

I will not lose myself in everything, that tears me down
Because you stand, stand by me

Want to see what's so beautiful inside
As we drink of life eternal
Absolve me through your suffering

I will not lose myself, in everything that tears me down
Because you stand by me
No one to blame, no one to blame
