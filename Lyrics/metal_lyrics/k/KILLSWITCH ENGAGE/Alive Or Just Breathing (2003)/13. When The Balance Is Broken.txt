[Bonus  Disc Track]Take comfort in these words
You are not alone, there is a purpose
Through the loneliness, depression
This is not in vain
Through the tribulation, find redemption
This is not in vain
The frustration we've endured
The struggle continues
Don't let them drag you down
Keep your eyes wide open
Don't let them drag you down
Keep your focus unbroken
Take refuge in these words
There comes a day for retribution
Through the loneliness, depression
This is not in vain
Through the tribulation, find redemption
This is not in vain
Don't let them drag you down
Keep your eyes wide open
Don't let them drag you down
Keep your focus unbroken
All will be revealed when balance is broken
Balance is broken
