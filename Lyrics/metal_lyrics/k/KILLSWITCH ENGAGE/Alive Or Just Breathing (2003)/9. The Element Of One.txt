Breathe me in [x2]

I, I disbelieve in separation
I close my eyes to see you
This is for you, everything I am
This is for you, take it from me
I, I disbelieve separation
I close my eyes
there's no escaping me
This is for you, everything I am
This is for you, take it from me
In your heart in your soul
I perceive rejuvenation

Breathe me in
I am forever
Deep within I am eternal [x2]

I will return to you
I am with you always
I will never turn away from you

Breathe me in
I am forever
Deep within I am eternal [x2]
