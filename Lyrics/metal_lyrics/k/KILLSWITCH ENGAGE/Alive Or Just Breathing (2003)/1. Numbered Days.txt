The time approaches
Fall
This is the voice of the voiceless,
We have learned by making choices,
After persecution and delusion,
We have severed a solution,
To build our foundation on natural elements to preserve life
We will rise, this babylon (fall)
Fall
Chanting inspiration for the righteous
dislocation from the social order
Kingdoms will rise to power
but kingdoms fall to dust
Fall, fall, fall
[repeat last 5 lines]

The ashes of the dead will be a sign
The time approaches
(No One hear you cry as you fall)
The time approaches
Arms raised (raised)
Eyes gaze (gaze)
Tongues of fire whisper
this life (life) will soon (soon) slip away
Fall
Babylon, your days are numbered
The time
The time approaches
Arms raised (raised)
Eyes gaze (gaze)
Tongues of fire whisper
this life (life) will soon (soon) slip away
Fall
Babylon, you will fall
Your days are numbered
The time approaches
No One hear you cry as you fall
Fall, fall, fall
