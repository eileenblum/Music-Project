This venom spreads like infection
Poison our minds with misconceptions
The division of society all in the name of ideology

Who are we to judge how to define love

Love is not manipulation to control
All we've got illuminate our souls

Who are we to judge and condescend 
Compassion never leads to intolerance 
Take a look at yourself and realize 
Love can not be reduced or compromised 

Who are we to judge how to define love
Blinded by intolerance

Who can judge another's struggle, another's pain
Another's strength to overcome comprehend and maintain

But you just can't see it and its hard to believe it
The way that you define love is delusional

Who are we to judge how to define love
Who are we to judge love
