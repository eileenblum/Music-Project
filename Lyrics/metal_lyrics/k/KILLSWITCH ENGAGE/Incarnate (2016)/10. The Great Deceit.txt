Resound the outcry, raise the signal of distress
We are compromised
They have silenced our dissent
A dull complacency covers humanity
This systematic hate of deceit

How many more will die before we realize the truth has been disguised?

[Chorus:]
Violence increased no justice and no peace
In the great deceit
The discontent silenced or put to death
In the great deceit
It's mental slavery

Our segregation is further fed by ignorance
This disconnection through color of the flesh
Blood of generations, saturate our roots
But history conceals the truth

[Chorus:]
Violence increased no justice and no peace
In the great deceit
The discontent (the discontent) silenced or put to death
In the great deceit
This is a great deceit

How can we breathe?
The silence is killing me
How can we breathe?
Who is the enemy?
How can we breathe?
Suffocate humanity
How can we breathe?
No justice, no peace

[Chorus:]
(Violence) â¦no justice and no peace
In the great deceit
The discontent (the discontent) silenced or put to death
In the great deceit
It's mental slavery
