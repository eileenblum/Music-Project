Yeah...
Born into the world of hatred
We are born free
From the restrains of this society.
Helpless to what is instilled
Yeah..
To all those who raise us,
Mold us and shape us.
There is a time to separate from this
A reason why, a state of mind.
There's a disconnection.
A judgement made
Fueled by hate. It's your mistake.
It's a choice you made.
It's tearing us apart!
Hate
Hate by design
Is destroying our lives
Seek to find some understanding.
Redefine your life!
Consequence
Affected in a life that is rejected.
Anger misplaced a burden on our hearts that's keeping us apart.
No love, no understanding.
What we design is hate inside.
A misconception, a judgement made.
It's our mistake we create when we lose compassion.
It's tearing us apart!
Hate
Hate by design
Is destroying our lives
Seek to find some understanding.
Redefine your life!
Redefine your understanding.
Redefine your own life!
Hate
Hate by design
Is destroying our lives
Seek to find some understanding.
Redefine your life!
