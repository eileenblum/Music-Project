(Carry on, carry on)

Morning breaks from a night awake
Itâs laid my heart to waste
Here in this anguish
Knowing what will end just begins again

[Chorus:]
Somehow through it all
We carry on (we carry on)
Raise you up when you fall
We carry on

Heal these wounds to break the skin again
Whatâs done is done
Nothingâs the same
Vacant expression
As the waves wash over your motionless face

[Chorus:]
Somehow through it all
We carry on (we carry on)
Raise you up when you fall
We carry on

Bury the past (bury the past)
Wounds remain, but the wounds remain
Through it all (through it all)
A desire to live again

[Chorus:]
Somehow through it all
We carry on (We carry on)
Raise you up when you fall

(Carry on) [3x]
Carry on
Carry on
