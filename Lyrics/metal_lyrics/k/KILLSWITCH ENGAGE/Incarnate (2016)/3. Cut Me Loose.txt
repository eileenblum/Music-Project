Lost in thought,
Recounting the cost when sanity became askew
When turning the pages of life.
Concentrated on killing the sorrow that tears us in two
A faded memory of what used to be
The burden and the noose
And just cut me loose
Just cut me loose.
It can't be mistaken, the spirit is vacant.
When hope for tomorrow is nowhere in view
Living so close to a weakness,
That continues to keep you held down
Hear the sound of the voice that is screaming.
What's lost is now found
A faded memory of what used to be (used to be)
The burden and the noose
Just cut me loose.
Oh.
Ah.
Ghosts of the past no longer torment me
I release the anguish
A faded memory (memory) of what used to be
The burden and the noose
Begging you to cut me loose
The burden and the noose
Just cut me loose
Cut me...cut me...cut me loose
