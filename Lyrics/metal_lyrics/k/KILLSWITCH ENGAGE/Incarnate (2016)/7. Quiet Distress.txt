How many times? How many lies?
Does it take to demonstrate?
To change the apathy that's ingrained
The screams, the cries
Behind the lies
The victim and the villainy, taking all your dignity

[Chorus:]
Quiet distress covers scars and bruises
Quiet distress leaves us lost and desperate

Night after night, search for the light
Relive the fear and misery
Disguise the pain (the pain)
The blood will wash away (wash away)
But the wounds still sing of your agony

[Chorus:]
Quiet distress covers scars and bruises
Quiet distress we can't afford indifference

Hearing screams and cries, over and over again
Wash the blood away, over and over again
The victim, over and over again.
Becomes the victor in the end

[Chorus:]
Quiet distress (distress)
Wonât cover scars and bruises
Quiet distress leaves us lost and desperate
Quiet distress (distress)
We can't afford indifference
