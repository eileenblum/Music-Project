[Chorus:]
It all falls on me, brings me to my knees
This feeling that's inside
Where's the peace that you promised me?
You promised me

Desolation fills this hollow heart
Seeking all the answers, as we drift apart
Where is the light? Where's the sanctity?
In this choir of voices, that deceive

[Chorus:]
It all falls on me, brings me to my knees
This feeling that's inside
Where's the peace that you promised me?
You promised

In disarray I find a place to come undone
Where all of my anger and all of my pain bleeds into something I can't contain
Release me from this moment, left here with nothing to hold onto
Your voice is still speaking, my vision is clear
And through the distance I feel you near

I feel you near

You donât see me, you can't hear my voice
Left me with nothing without a choice
Memories of what could have been
Remind me it will never be the same again

It falls
It falls on me [3x]

It falls
