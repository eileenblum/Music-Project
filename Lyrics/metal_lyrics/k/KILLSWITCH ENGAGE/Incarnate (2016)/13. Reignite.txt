In modern humanity
We lack a sense of urgency
Where lies our ambition (our ambition)
Speaking words that don't hold weight
Lack of pure integrity
Leaving nothing to be gained

Nothing but insincerity
Just masking insecurity

Where's the passion
The urgency? Where is vitality?

Hanging on by a thread
Fading spark of light within
Reignite the ignition (the ignition)

There is no greater defeat
Then not fighting for what you believe
For what you believe

What do you believe in?
What do you stand for?
It's time to back, back up your words
(live this life) with passion
Has the world drained all our hearts?
Has the love been torn apart?
(live this life) with new direction
With knowledge to maintain
To determine what must change

With positive mentality
An attitude that sustain
Reignite the ignition

Yeah!

(live this life)
It's in your hands
(it's our time)
Take nothing for granted
(take this life)
It's in your hands
(live this life)
Stand and fight

Reignition
Ignite the blaze
