A lifetime of searching
Questioning existence and purpose
From the setting sun
To the vast expanses
Death from birth in reverse
Examine the dimensions in suspension of disbelief

The search continues
The soul escapes
Our existence
My soul aches

Beyond the aether, pass into the veil
Dissolved into nothingness
No hands can grasp
There is no answer to the questions
In the span of the infinite
To the concept of all time

[Chorus:]
I'm upraised a feeling I can't explain.
My soul aches still searching is my refrain

Prepare the body for when the soul escapes
The last caress before the great awakening
Beyond all
All of our comprehension
Beyond all
Disbelief

Spread my ashes into the sea
Embrace the journey
Death where is thy sting

[Chorus:]
I'm upraised a feeling I can't explain
My soul aches still searching is my refrain
I'm upraised (upraised)
Still searching for what remains
My soul aches (my soul aches)
This feeling I canât explain

Silence the voice of the self-righteous
Condescending and without grace
Give sight to those who are blind with hatred
To see beyond hypocrisy

My soul searches beyond the aether
Beyond the dogmatic haze I still believe, I still believe

I, I still believe
I, I still believe

(My soul searches beyond the aether as I still believe)
