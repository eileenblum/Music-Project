Holding on to something
That I know I can't control
And I could not have it any other way
Restless anxious is all I've known
Defenseless against this
This change in my soul
What was once reluctance soon becomes the will to grow
And I would not have it any other way
So I let go. Lose control.
Let go to the unknown
Nothing changes in refusing to grow
Wisdom engages those who will grasp for something more
Take this leap of faith
There's no time to waste
And I cannot have it any other way
So I let go. Lose control.
Just let go. Let go
See behind the hue. Reject what I once knew. I'll let go. Surrender
