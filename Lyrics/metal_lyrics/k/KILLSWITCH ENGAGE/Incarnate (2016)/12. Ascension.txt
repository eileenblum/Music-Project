This is a dawning
A calling to face down consequence
No honor in hiding behind a wall that keeps you sane

Shed the skin of past mistakes
No remorse and no escape
The burden of your consciousness

Don't turn back
Your time has come

[Chorus:]
Draw your breath
Define your ascension
Put your fears to death
Define your ascension

As the tension builds within you
Let conviction conquer
All those who stand before you

This is fair warning
No turning back
There is no indecision

Don't turn away
Your time has come

It all ends today
Your time has come

[Chorus:]
Draw your breath
Define your ascension
Put your fears to death
Define your ascension

(this is fair warning)
(your time will come)
