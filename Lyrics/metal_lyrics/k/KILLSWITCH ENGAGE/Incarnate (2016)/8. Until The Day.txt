The reverberations escape and embrace me to a lonely sleep
As thoughts hold on to me
With words left unspoken
I couldn't ease the pain so easily
Drown my sanity

[Chorus:]
The distance apart, the longing in our hearts
I will remain until the day I die
We keep this path alive, never break the ties
I will remain until the day I die

The open spaces
Another city passes as we sleep
And it calls to me

The rhythm tears me open
Another crowd, another chance to bleed
Through this release

[Chorus:]
The distance apart, the longing in our hearts
I will remain until the day I die
We keep this path alive, never break the ties
I will remain until the day I die

And I taste the pain
No looking back as it begins again
I wouldn't change a thing
I'll give it everything until the end
Until my final breath

I will hold fast
Never turning back
I will hold fast
Until the day I die

(Forever I will remain)

[Chorus:]
The distance apart, the longing in our hearts
I will remain until the day I die
We keep this path alive, never break the ties
I will remain until the day Iâ¦
Until the day die
