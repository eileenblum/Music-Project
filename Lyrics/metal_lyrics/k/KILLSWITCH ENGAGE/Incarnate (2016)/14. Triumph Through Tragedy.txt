[Special Edition Bonus Track]Triumph through tragedy

Every decision
Every choice that we make
All it takes is just one victory
Or just one simple mistake

[Pre-chorus:]
To change the course
Count the loss
Determine the road that we must take
The road that we create

[Chorus:]
(strength will be)
Through the determined
(can't you see)
There is triumphs through tragedy?

Cause us be
There's no illusion
This life will drag you through so much despair
Draw your own conclusion
Through reason and purpose we persevere

[Pre-chorus:]
To change the course
Count the loss
Determine the road that we must take
The road that we create

[Chorus:]
(strength will bleed)
Through the determined
(can't you see)
We have a purpose
All we need is to believe
There is triumph through tragedy

Never give in
To despair and hopelessness
Never give in
When your will begins to break
Never give in

Yeah!

When you're on the edge (step back) to find your balance
When the walls are closing in (closing in) tear them down

[Chorus:]
(strength will bleed)
Through the determined
(can't you see)
We have a purpose
All we need is to believe
There is triumph through tragedy
