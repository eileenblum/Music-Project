"Justice for my sister and her children."
"If you want justice you've come to the wrong place."
"I disagree. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice and all those who've wronged me are right here."

The twin blades brings the vengeance raised
Forged from the flames
Piercing through the blood-red sun
To the watchers in the southern skies

Fighting until our last breath
Fearless and tempting death
Through honor and victory
We will be avenged
Avenged

Loyalty until the grave
Unbowed, unbent
We are unbroken

Forked tongue to blind and divide
Choking on these venomous voices
We overcome our enemy
Until all are vanquished

Flames course through the darkness
For life to be avenged
Through honor and victory
We make amends

Loyalty unto the grave
Unbowed, unbent
We are unbroken

Loyalty until the grave
Unbowed, unbent
We are unbroken

Silence these venomous voices
Forged from the blades
Her death won't be in vain
Loyalty until the grave

Loyal until death
Loyal to the grave
Loyal until death
Loyal to the grave

Loyalty unto the grave
Unbowed, unbent
We are unbroken
