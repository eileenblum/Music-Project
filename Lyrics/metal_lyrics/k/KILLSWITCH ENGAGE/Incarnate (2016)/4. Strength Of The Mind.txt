Strength of the mind!

Looking back on the life that I lived
What I leave behind
Mistakes and memories serve to remind (they serve me to remind)
The reflection staring back from the mirror
No longer looks like me, like me!

Strength of the mind to fight whatâs inside
It takes strength of the mind
Before I lose control

Who can raise you from the fall and save you? Only you
Who can take the pain away and change you? Only you

A thousand miles between this never ending feeling
Just looking for something more
Searching for a release
Iâve seen rock bottom and Iâve smashed my fists against it
Just keep telling yourself it will be alright

Who can raise you from the fall and save you? Only you
Who can take the pain away and change you? Only you

Gather all your pain and suffering
Turn them into strength and weaponry
To overcome the enemy thatâs in you
Come face to face with a war that rages in you

Who can take the pain away? Only you!

Who can raise you from the fall and save you? Only you!

Strength of the mind!
Before I lose control
