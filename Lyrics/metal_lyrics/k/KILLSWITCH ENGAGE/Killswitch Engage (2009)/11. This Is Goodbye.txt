This is my goodbye [x3]
But please don't say a word.
I don't exist, I can't be heard.
Each day is a new failure
Every trial is permissive
Every step I gain I only fall back faster

This is my goodbye
But please don't try to stop me

There is nothing left
There is nothing left

[Chorus:]
It's over, please lay me to rest
Forgive me, let me go
It's my choice so please lay me to rest
Forgive me, let me go

I am no martyr, this place overwhelms me.
Once again I could last
I see no way to be free
I search for the answers
Is there no solution?
I realize my reflection
My reflection is my demon

[Chorus]

It's my blasphemy, hoping not to wake.
(Each day...) it's a nightmare, sleep in freedom
You gave but it was not enough
Your strength, it was not enough, never enough.

[Chorus]
