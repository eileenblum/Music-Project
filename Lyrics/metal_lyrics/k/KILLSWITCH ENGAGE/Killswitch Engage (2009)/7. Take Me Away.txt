Watching once more, as the world passes me by
Surrounded but still all alone, Am I living a lie?
Empty faces,
Empty eyes

Are staring right through me
No regrets
But I still ask why

Take me away
To a peace I've never known

This is the price I've paid and it's taking its toll
Can it be too much to ask for the time it stole?
Empty faces
Empty eyes

Are staring right through me
No regrets
But I still ask why

Take me away
To a peace I've never know
Take me away
Where my life can be my own

I only wish that I had stayed
I only wish that I had known

Take me away
To a peace I've never know
Take me away
Where my life can be my own
Where my life can be my own

Take me away
Take me away
