You were once the source of a pureness that can't be defined
And now you curse the day, how can you leave your faith behind

Just look at yourself do you like what you see
I want no more of you, watch me walk away

This is your last time you are forgotten
You let your dreams die you are the forgotten

Placed your ego above all but misplaced your innocence

Just look at yourself do you like what you see
I want no more of you, watch me walk away

This is your last time you are forgotten
You let your dreams die you are the forgotten

What have you given up will never return again
Now you're dead inside I hope it was worth the cost
I hope it was worth the cost I hope it was worth the cost
Now you're buried alive

This is the last time
This is the last time you are forgotten
You let your dreams die you are forgotten
