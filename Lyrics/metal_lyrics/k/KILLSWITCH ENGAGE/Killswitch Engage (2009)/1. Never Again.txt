I want you to suffer, as I have suffered
This is a war of attrition and I won't cease

Nothing can change what you've done
Nothing can change the way I feel
You will never, be forgiven
Nothing can change what you've done
Nothing can change the way I feel
I hope you suffer as I have suffered

You are dead to me, and time won't heal what you've done
You have made your grave, now make your pledge

Nothing can change what you've done
Nothing can change the way I feel
You will never be forgiven
Nothing can change what you've done
Nothing can change the way I feel
I hope you suffer as I have suffered

Never again will I be betrayed
Never again will you crush me
Unforgiven, unforgiven
Remember these words, remember my face
Suffer as I have suffered

[Guitar Solo]

Nothing can change what you've done
Nothing can change the way I feel
You will never be forgiven
Nothing can change what you've done
Nothing can change the way I feel
I hope you suffer as I have suffered

This is what you deserve
