Alone, once more alone as the memories weave and fade away
Separation mocks me frustration consumes me
Inspiration has grown cold, even as the longing renews

Desperate, I return to you. Broken, I return to you
We circle over and over. But still I return to you

What will it take to escape you? What will it take to escape you?
Is this what you wanted, to see me humbled
Is this what you asked for, the final word

Desperate, I return to you. Broken, I return to you
We circle over and over. But still I return to you

I would tear my eyes out to never see your face
But all of these scars can never be erased
Choke on your words that have left me bleeding
And may your tears burn

We circle over and over...still I return...I return

Desperate I return to you.
Broken, I return to you
We circle over and over.
But still I return to you

What will it take to escape you
What will it take to escape
