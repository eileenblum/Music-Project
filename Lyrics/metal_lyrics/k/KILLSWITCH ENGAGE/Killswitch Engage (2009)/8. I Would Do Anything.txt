The words die in my throat and there is nothing I can do
From a child to a monster, and now a child among monsters
Your life is a mockery twisted in the wind
Is this your legacy of ignorance

I'll give my heart and soul to see you free again
I would do anything

So many mistakes have led to this disaster
Ten years of reflection don't waste a moment
Are you loathe to seek the truth you must choose

I'll give my heart and soul to see you free again
I would do anything
If you could see the hope I've always seen in you
I would do anything

The weight that's crushing can be relieved
Leave the sins of the past at your feet
Pray for life or bleed to death. Pray for life or bleed to death

I'll bleed the reddest blood to see you live again
I would do anything
If you could see the hope I've always seen in you
I would do anything
