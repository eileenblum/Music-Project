I see so much corruption
And it's hard to ignore
Living on greed and possessions
Is this what we're dying for?

Now choose this day
Who you will serve
To be the light in a darkened world

Many are willing to only live for themselves
Turning away from morality
Nothing can save you now

Now choose this day
Who you will serve
To be the light in a darkened world
You feel dissolved and the water's beginning to rise
Become the light in this darkened world

This is destiny
The choice is now defined
No more deception
Now change will come

It's in your hands
It's in your hands

Now choose this day
Who you will serve
To be the light
In a darkened world

It's in your hands
It's in you hands
Become the light in this darkened world
