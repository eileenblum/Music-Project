It's even louder in the silence and it's always the same
The darkness always finds me when I hear your name
It should have been me and I want you to know
That I'll hold you in my heart and I won't let go
Just take away this sorrow it's too much to bear

Drifting from your memory. I'm lost, lost without your love

Now the time goes by, but the torment remains
If only I could wake and see your face again
There would no more regret for all the things I never said

Drifting from your memory. I'm lost, without your love
It's getting harder to face another day without you
I'm lost, lost without your love

I wish as I was as strong as you were in the end
But the darkness claims me, and I fall once again

Drifting from your memory. I'm lost, without your love
It's getting harder to face another day without you
I'm lost, without your love
It's getting harder to face another day without you
Lost
