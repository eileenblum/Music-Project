The empty skies turn black,
Their bones turn to figments,
Desolation is in the air
This is distention

Though we linger off,
It dies
Before our eyes,
It dies

As far as the eye can see,
Only destruction
Is it hopeless?
What can be done?

Is it too late?
Are we too late to save ourselves?
We're living in, in a dead world

Crying out for a change
What can be done?
Each day we slip further away,
On the edge of ruin

It won't be long
Before we shut down
Is it hopeless?
What can be done?

Is it too late?
Are we too late to save ourselves?
We're living in, in a dead world

It's so cold
And we're no one to blame,
Blame ourselves

Now this is our fight
Because there is little left
To hold on to
And to beg forgiveness
For willing blindness
Now I can say:

It's not too late, oh! Not too late
To save ourselves
It's not too late, oh! Not too late
To save ourselves.
