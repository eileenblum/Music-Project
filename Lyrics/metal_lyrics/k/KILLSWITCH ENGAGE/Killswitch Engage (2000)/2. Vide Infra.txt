I have opened my eyes to see the world that surrounds me daily
I refuse to be led by the majority can't compromise I and I to pass judgement
judgement will be passed upon you I will stand up for who I am never moved
by condemnation no one is placed higher than another no matter race
or creed or gender we must teach forgiveness and compassion for all life
through understanding of our differences we will find respect for one
another we are all flesh and blood I am not afraid to speak my mind no matter
the consequences stay true to myself through the humble eyes of a child
we will realize true equality they cannot take me from me
they cannot take you from you they cannot take I from I
