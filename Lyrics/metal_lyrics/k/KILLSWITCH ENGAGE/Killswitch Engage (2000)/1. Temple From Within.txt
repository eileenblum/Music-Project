make me feel serenity when all is revealed so easy to look back in life
and question but I must seek to find the strength to push forward (forward)
forward I want to see whats so beautiful inside as we drink of life
eternal absolve me through your suffering teach me to inscribe these words
on my heart cover me with the shadow of your hand I will not loose myself
I in everything that tears me down because you stand by me
no one to blame for my transgressions no one to blame but myself
