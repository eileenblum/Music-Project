gazing at the horizon lost in the cryptic majesty gazing at the horizon
so lost what have we done a slowly dying earth a suffocated wasteland
for convenience and so called progression visions of prophecy faces
pushed in the earth nothing will change unless we inflict transition
praying on bended knees (empty) closed eyes will not see (empty)
praying on bended knees (empty) is there still time...
the sands of time will are slipping through our fingers will we stare
into the eyes of nothingness burned and raped in the name of humanity
enslaved earth I pray for death for your release
