separation from the faceless majority step on the outside
look on the inside tear tear it apart, a prisoner only in your own mind
individuality will bring you life time to rise above to freedom
so much love lost, what have we become rise against the oppression,
resist and question burn the system kill the system kill the mindstate
of indifference step into the unblind reclaim your life
