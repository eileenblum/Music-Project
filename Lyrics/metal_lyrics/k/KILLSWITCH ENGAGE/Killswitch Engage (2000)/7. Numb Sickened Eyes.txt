enter into a circle of light, engraved in flesh stare in my eyes,
I will not bow down, the only truth pulling words form my lips tearing me
within this life will remain a mystery to you until the day you pass away
speak lies spilling from your lips as clear as crimson (as clear as crimson)
I sacrifice what I most desire to you I spoke my vengeance
with only a smile to you casting out deception to you
