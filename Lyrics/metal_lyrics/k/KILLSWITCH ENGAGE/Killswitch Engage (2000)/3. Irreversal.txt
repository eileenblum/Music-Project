Look behind what lies on the surface
Rituals to read the signs
Signify the life I leave behind...
Behind, lies

I am (I am) not alone
This is (this is) greater than I

I am (I am) not alone
This is (this is) greater than I

Set me free,
Release me,
Embrace me,
Cleanse me

Rituals to read the signs
Signify the life I leave behind
Behind, lies

I am (I am) not alone
This is (this is) greater than I
I am (I am) not alone
This is (this is) greater than I

Set me free
Release me
Embrace me
Cleanse me

Look behind what lies on the surface
Humbled soul to reveal a purpose

Outstretched arms to welcome the sacrifice of this body
Outstretched arms to welcome the sacrifice of this body
