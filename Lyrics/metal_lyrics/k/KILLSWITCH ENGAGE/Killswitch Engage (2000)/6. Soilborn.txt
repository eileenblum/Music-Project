time will not stand still today is the day, the day of salvation
living for more than just synthetic force fed existence
this is my disposition I will strive for the truth
time will not stand still today is the day, the day of salvation
living for more than just synthetic force fed existence
this is my disposition I will strive for integrity
time will not stand still
we are the soilborn we are the children
soilborn!
washed in blood
because we are blind we must not take this life for granted
in this everlasting thirst to maintain...to maintain...vitality
this is my disposition I will strive for rebirth
we are the soilborn! soilborn!
today is the day of salvation life has only just begun today is the day
