[special edition track]

We have come too far
to let our fulfillment fall away.
I must refuse to renounce my integrity.
We stand in defiance to their ethics.
Let the grief that they have inflicted serve as our call to arms.
Are you ready? Are you willing to be the catalyst?
We can no longer be indifferent.
Restore this dying world.
From misery we have turned away, ignite the past, let the bridges burn.
My eyes watch the unholy be left in the distance.
The division of our souls from our blasphemous tongues.
This is our atonement.
From misery we have turned away, ignite the past, let the bridges burn.
From sorrow, we have turned away to the past, let the bridges burn.
I have bled for the truth.
There is no surrender.
Move forward.
Commit yourself.
Destroy all lies.
From ashes to ashes, from dust to dust.
From misery we have turned away, ignite the past, let the bridges burn.
Let the bridges burn.
