As I live and breathe
I'm watching, watching the world die
We greet this with apathy no longer

Consumed by self
We walk through each day
With no mind to deprivation and moral decay

We must destroy and rebuild
We must destroy and rebuild
For the sake of all, it starts with one
With one

As I live and breathe
I'm watching, watching the world die
We greet this with apathy no longer

If we cant break the silence (how can we survive?)
Search inside yourself (and know that you're alive)
We must break the silence
Now we are alive
Silent no longer

Make this world, take notice
The change is in our hands
The battle has just begun
We are not defeated

If we cant break the silence (how can we survive?)
Search inside yourself (and know that you're alive)
We must break the silence
Now we are alive
Silent no longer

With all that I am
I will lift my voice
To start this revolution
It starts today
And it starts with me
Time is no longer

With all I am
I will lift my voice
With all I am
It starts with me

Break the silence [3X]
We are alive
Break the silence [3X]
We are alive
