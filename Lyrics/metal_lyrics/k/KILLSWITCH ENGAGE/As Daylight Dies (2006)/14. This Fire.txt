[special edition track]

All I've ever wanted was destiny to be fulfilled,
it is in my hands, I must not fail,
I must not fail.

Even through the darkest days,
this fire burns, always.
this fire burns, always.

This is the broken ground
Misery begins to rise.
Turn away from yesterday,
tomorrow's in my eyes.

Nevermore to be held down
by the wings of history.
Nevermore to be cast aside,
this day is mine.

Even through the darkest days,
this fire burns, always.
this fire burns, always.

I will not be denied
in this final hour.
I will not be denied,
this day is mine.

The passion inside me,
is burning, is burning.
The passion inside me,
is burning, is burning.

Even through the darkest days,
this fire burns always (always).
This fire burns (fire burns) always.

Always (always).
