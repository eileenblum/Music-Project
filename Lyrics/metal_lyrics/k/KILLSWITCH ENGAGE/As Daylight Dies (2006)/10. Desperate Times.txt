Time and time again
I stand at the crossroad
Where the weight of my burden
Eclipses my resolve
This broken path I've chosen
I walk it alone
Though I feel forgotten
You've carved my name in stone

In these desperate times
This I plead
When all else fails
Remember me

This is daily crucifixion
And these rusty nails leave scars
My jagged crown is on my side
Because it never fell

In these desperate times
This I plead
When all else fails
Remember me

This is a blood-oath
They are nothing to me anymore
But your voice means more to me than you'll ever know

There's no question
You're the answer
I will find you...

In these desperate times
This I bleed
When all fails
Remember me
In these desperate times
This I bleed
When all fails
Remember me
