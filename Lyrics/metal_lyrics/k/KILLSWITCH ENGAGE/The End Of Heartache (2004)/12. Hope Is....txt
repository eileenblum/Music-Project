This is our moment
Will you stand with me?
Hope is not lost
Hope is not lost

Let the strength of your words
Be the spark that ignites the flame
Proclaim your freedom
Give voice to your liberation

This is my confession
Mark these words, we will rise

Weep no more
We will prevail
Grieve no more
We will prevail

Revoke the needless way of affliction
Revoke and abandon
We are the authors, finishers of our faith
We are the solution

This is my confession
Mark these words, we will rise

Weep no more
We will prevail
Grieve no more
We will prevail

Hope is...
Hope is not lost

Weep no more
We will prevail
Grieve no more
We will prevail

This is our moment
Will you stand with me?
Hope is not lost
Hope is not lost
