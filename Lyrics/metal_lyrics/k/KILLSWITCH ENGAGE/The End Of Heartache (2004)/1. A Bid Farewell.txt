I will bid farewell, sever the ties
This is all I am, this is all that's left
Turn from deceit, the love of self is death
Deliverance is given to you

I will bid farewell,
Sever the ties

Now your heart beats black with deception, you have been forsaken
Leave behind (I will) all reminders of you

I will bid farewell
To all lies
I will bid farewell
Sever the ties

Searching, always searching
Hoping for a change
I will never be satisfied
I will now bid farewell

I will bid farewell
To all lies
I will bid farewell
Sever the ties
