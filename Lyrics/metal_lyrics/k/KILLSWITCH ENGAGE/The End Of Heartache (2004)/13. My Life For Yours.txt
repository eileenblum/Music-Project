[2CD album edition version track]

It's all a nothing, been dead for long
For far too long the illusion falters
This illusion falters
Suffering (suffering)
Despite the struggle
Remaining helpless
My heart can no longer (my heart can no longer)
No longer be frozen (no longer)

Take my words (This truth)
I will never
Never leave you

It must be now, we must revolt
Invoke the strength, turn the tide, stop it now yea

Take my words (This truth)
I will never
Never leave you

The winds of change will cleanse away
What still remains
Let our doubts and indecision pass away

Take my words (This truth)
I will never
Never leave you

My
Life
For
Yours

Free me (my)
Again (life)
My life (from)
For you (you)
