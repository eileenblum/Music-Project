Abandon the safety of mindless following,
Abandon what holds us captive to suffering
Pierce the blinders, behold
The path that leads before you
Let us forsake - forsake all the things
That lead us to our demise

Open your eyes,
See the divine
Open your eyes,
See the...

Destruction of innocence
Watch it breathe it's last

Open your eyes (behold the path before you),
See the divine (forsake our demise)
Open your eyes (behold the path before you),
See the...

Abandon the safety of mindless following

To the grave we take this oath
To leave this world behind
Hear the words of the voice
That lives inside

Break free, this is your time
Break free.

To the grave
Take this oath
