We will not return to the countless mistakes of the past
I will not relive the failures of the man I once was

Only through dedication will I destroy all preconception

No longer will I let myself be truly satisfied with the standard
We will not return to the countless mistakes of the past

Only through dedication will I destroy all preconception

Let this be
Be the day
Day of my
My declaration
Let this be the day of my declaration

Join me,
Walk with me

Shatter the bonds that tie us
To what we strive to never be

Join me,
Walk with me
