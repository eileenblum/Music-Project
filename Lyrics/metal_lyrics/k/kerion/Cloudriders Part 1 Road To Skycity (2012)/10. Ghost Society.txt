Walking far from light
Hidden in the night
Away from your sight
I go on my fight, go on my fight
Looking for knowledge
Lost in the ages
This will be my pledge
Yes my road is waged, my road is waged

Trapped in darkness
My soul will fall into madness
All that I know
Must stay forever in the shadow

Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare

[Chorus:]
Changing the world into masquerade
Where kings and pawns parade
This ghost society
Makes grow high its sad conspiracy

Living for power
I'm the real master
The secret keeper
Danger awaits, danger awaits,
All my devotion
Leads to frustration
Does my salvation
Become damnation?

All things have changed
I see the rise of technologies
The final last breath
Will sing to me sweet symphonies
