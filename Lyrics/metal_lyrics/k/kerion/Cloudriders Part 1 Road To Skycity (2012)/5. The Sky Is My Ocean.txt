Black curtain of the night
Has fallen on the sea
Sailing under the moonlight
A thousand stars I see
(a thousand stars I see)

Wind is blowing in the veils
Caressing my skin
Let the clouds become our waves
And find the secret within
(find the secret within)

Flying to mysterious realms
I feel new sensation
Beyond my most insane dreams
The sky is my ocean
(the sky is my ocean)

Does this travel have an end?
I'm not sure to know
Which fate lies in my hand?
Anyway I will go
(anyway I will go)

Guided by a silver glow
I keep my eyes open
Waiting for a new tomorrow
While slowly the night dies
