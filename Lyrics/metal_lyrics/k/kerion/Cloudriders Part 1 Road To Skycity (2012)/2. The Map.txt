Beyond seas and beyond grounds
Lost in the sky among clouds
A mystical town, says a legend

Find its secrets!
And you will become the master
Of a new order!

Beyond hills and beyond mounts
Lost in deep blue swept by the winds
A mystical town, says a legend

One sees wonder!
One sees the power!
Another danger!

[Chorus:]
They're all looking for the map
But she's the only one
Who holds the truth
And she's asking the stars
What's hidden at the end
At the end of the road

Beyond edge and over the land
Lost in thoughts of an old wise man
Unreal town, says a legend

You will become a clouds-rider
With the whole sky for empire!

Beyond dreams and beyond time
Lost in deep blue swept by the winds
A mystical town, says a legend

Open up your eyes
And dream among the clouds
Find the hidden town
