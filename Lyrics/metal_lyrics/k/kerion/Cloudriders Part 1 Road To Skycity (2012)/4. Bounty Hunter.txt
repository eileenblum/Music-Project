I'm not of any country or any banner
I don't belong to any master
I don't care about rules and power
I don't fight for any cause
I have no road, no purpose
Forgive me, I'm not what you suppose

Every day passing I take another way
All I do moves my soul away
Time will come when I'll have to pay
I don't fight for any people
I have no doctrine, no moral
Forget me, I don't wanna see you fall

No one can explain your choice
You don't listen to any voice
No one can understand your choice
Silence speaks louder than noise
I don't fight for any land
I have no kingdom, no home
Forsake me, I should not take your hand

[Chorus:]
I'm not a defender
Nor an avenger
I'm a bounty-hunter

You cross the world alone
On a rope between good and evil
I'm looking for someone
Into darkness you bear its call
