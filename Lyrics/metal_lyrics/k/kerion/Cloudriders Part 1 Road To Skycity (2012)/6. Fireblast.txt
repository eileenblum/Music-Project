They have soiled the ground with the blood of their prey
They have burned the land with the fire they spit
They have blackened the sky with the smoke of towns in flames
Bringing forth destruction and death

They have sold their soul to the prince of evil
They have changed the world to a sad battle field
They've engraved upon their flesh with the number of their victims
Bringing confusion sorrow and war

[Chorus:]
Dragon rider, all fall under
The flames of your monster
Dragon rider all fall under
And I wonder
Will we see the walls of Skycity?
Will this tale tum to reality?

They've spread throughout the winds the smell of ash
They've declared violence and fear as their emblems
They have lost their minds into darkness for deep madness
Bringing destruction, terror and tears

[Chorus:]
Will we accomplish our destiny?
Will this story stay in memory?
