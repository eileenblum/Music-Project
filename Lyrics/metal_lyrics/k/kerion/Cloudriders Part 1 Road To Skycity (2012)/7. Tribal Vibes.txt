Come on here we are!
Masters of dark and wild forest
Fight us if you dare!
I promise that in peace you'll rest

Listen to our song!
Surrounding all over our land
To wood we belong!
Against its enemies we'll stand

No matter who you are!
In this place even kings have no crown
Your home is so far!
There's nothing here that you can own

Go back to your land!
Before loosing what you know
Don't you understand?
This jungle'll never let you go

[Chorus:]
Lost where sea and sky become
One in deep blue
In this emerald kingdom
You will find the truth
Last when golden sunlight
Fades in the night
A mystic strange lullaby
Rises to the sky
