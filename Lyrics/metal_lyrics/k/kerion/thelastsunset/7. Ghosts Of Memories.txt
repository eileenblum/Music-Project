There is blood around me
I never felt so misery
Dust and mud cover my skin
Death and fear fly in the wind

When I closed my eyes
Ghosts disturb my memory
Far from a dream
Now it's only ice
And darkness which surround me

The pain is nothing
When I see my hands in blood
I gave everything
To be free until the end

How many survivors
How many death
Not to live the horror more
Not to see these faces again

This battle is the last one
My sword is broken
I gave all that I have
To the last drop of my blood

When I closed my eyes
Ghosts disturb my memory
Now it's only ice
And darkness which surround me

The pain is nothing
When I see my hands in blood
I gave everything
To be free until the end

The same rage, the same passion
No more place for compassion
Under the armours of the warriors
Elves, men, dwarfs together
Will not be any more

I hoped for the day of glory
