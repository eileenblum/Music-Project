Behind the men who spit fire
Balls of jugglers flyin' higher
Grelots tinkle your costume shine
I hear the crowd acclaim
Up are glasses of wine

Make them laugh that is your task
But fog has spread in your eyes
Who may hide behind the mask?
I see one face smilin'
Whereas the other cries

Jumpin' in front of your Master
Now it's time to start your show
Fast as the thunder
In the sky you grow

The blows of drums are beatin' rate
Under the applause(s) you create
Funny crazy new steps of dance
"Hail!" scream all the lords
Still their only sentence

When you tighten me the hand
Sure I beware of your kicks
Tell me the secret of this land
The way to the truth is like your acrobatics

You say I will see you later
And just as a robber you go
Real friend or liar
I promise to know!

Fantasy and mystery here is your way
Keeper of the key with my nerves you play
To the king of the muddle the price I pay
In the town of Sephiria for the truth I pray
