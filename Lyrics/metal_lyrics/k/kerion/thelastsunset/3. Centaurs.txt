Dark is the dawn
Under the shadow of the trees
Doubt has been sown
In the land of my fairies

Strong is the sound
Of your mighty shoes when you are
Striking the ground
Which forever will be your

Mighty centaurs keepers of the enchanted forest
Proud defenders of the mystic creatures face my quest

My wish for all
Hide and protect this cursed human
Until the fall
Evil forces look for her

Ride Jeniss far
Faster than the blindin' thunder
Prevent the war
Warn the king of the danger

Mighty centaurs keepers of the enchanted forest

The Holy wise chimeras
Always stand to defend
Your beloved innocent magic world
Glory with your allies
The loss for the enemy
Overcome either the sad conspiracy
