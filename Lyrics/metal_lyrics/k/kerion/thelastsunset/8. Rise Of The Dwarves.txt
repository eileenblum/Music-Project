Sailin' to the seven mines
I swore to save mine
On the ground my brothers lie
I can't trust my eyes

Break the chains of your slavery
Thousand screams of victory

Mad goblins and wolf-riders
They all fall under
The elves arrows and my axe
Blood and death, their tracks

Break the pain which made me cry
Thousand fists up to the sky

Rise of the dwarfs
Hear the beat of your heart
Feel the rage of freedom
Flowing in your veins

Rise of the dwarfs
The mountains, the rivers
They all sing you are
The sons of the earth

Step by step now we make one
And become the arms
Of our glorious revolution
Liberty kiss(es) my hands

Break the pain which made me cry
Thousand fists up to the sky

Rise of the dwarfs
Hear the beat of your heart
Feel the rage of freedom
Flowing in your veins

Rise of the dwarfs
The mountains, the rivers
They all sing you are
The sons of the earth

Rise of the dwarfs
In spite of the darkness
Don't let the power
Of the thunder fade

Rise of the dwarfs
The mountains, the rivers
They all sing you are
The sons of the earth
