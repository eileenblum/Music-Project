Time has come for the ancient allies to meet again
Time has come for them to face the last threat of darkness
In the castle of the king Phagus
The gathering of the united lands is goin' to begin

From the land where dragons fly
Fly high!
From the town lost in the misty woods
Here come the glorious elves
The lords of the mystic forest
From the land where the nights fall faster!
Than the sunlight shines over the hill
From the high snowy mountains
Comes the last hope of... the dwarfs people

From the land where sunfire
Fire!
Browns the weeds and cracks this injured ground
From the black abyss of Hell
Come the last defeated warriors
Thanks to the brave amazons Goddess!
Thanks to the holy mighty griffins
They escaped from the bloody
Legions of Orcs and... Evil black Elves

After having to listen to Kelvar the king taken word.
"I make a point of congratulating you and I thank you for your precious help, we can trust you ! You have deserved your place among us!"

Olof (is) looking for (the) ones
Who'll stand and fight to save his owns
The  elves promise to join
Him to free the slaves
When the black clouds precede the storm
Announcing the  age of chaos
The old rancours are forgotten
United we 'll win the servants of Hell vae victis

Suddenly a keeper opened the door and a not awaited girl ran in the room.
"I'm the cleric Jenniss, Erwin the wizard sends to me to warn you!
Beware of the malefic necromancer!"

At the end of the gathering, Flinnt the chosen-one of the elves people, said to the warrior the truth about the tragic death of his beloved family.
After having massacred the villagers, the warriors killed their green-skinned allies and spread their corpses among the other victims.
But your father tore off the black pin of his attacker and he hid it in his hand. He gave the pin to Kelvar and suggested to him going to Sephiria.

I swear to find your murderers!
I'll fight till my last breath
I will avenge you!!!
