In the centaurs temple somewhere in the mystic forest, Jenniss and Eleanor, the amazons chieftain, take care of the beast.
They must prevent the evil forces from realizing their dark project.

From the sky came the threat
Thousand shadows flying
Under the light
Hiding the sun
Till the horizon becomes darker
Than the night now
Strike the harpies

The keepers of the ground
Get ready to face
Wings of darkness
Claws of the death

The centaurs proudly
Raise their bow to the sky
Shooting on the
Giant black swarm
But as soon as one
Falls two others appear
How long can we
Face the enemy?

Is this the end of the beloved land?
The last day of our reign
Death and fear spread in the air
Tears and blood flood the ground

The last hope of the livings
Flew away in the wind
Now the chaos is coming
Only the void will stay

Whereas the battle made rage,
The soul of the necromancer was growing fast out of control.
Erwin screamed to Jen.

"You've to kill it before it completely takes possession of her mind!
Now Jenny! Do it! (You must) kill it!"

The cleric was ready to stab the beast but in a reflection of her blade she saw the tears in the eyes of her human friend

"Sorry...I can't ...I can't do it..."

Black clouds in the reddish skies
Announce a bloody tragic dawn

Now the wizards sing
In vain their magic rhymes
The king of pain's
Era is waged
With the lord of dead
The chimeras fly
Back to their den
Screaming their joy
