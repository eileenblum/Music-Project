She has the beauty of the devil
How strong is the temptation to see her face
Monster with hair made of living snakes
Their whistle seduce my soul

Queen of the dark forces of evil
Mistress of the Beasts guardian of the Thresholds
Her deep glance will turn me into stone
Her dragonbody moves so close to me

All around the temple where she dwells
May be seen the sad stony figures of men
Torn apart my mortal illusions
Her wet tongue slips on my lips

As a young and beautiful woman
She's the symbol of fertility and life
As crone she consumes like a fire
Her dragonbody moves so close to me

Medusa queen of the Gorgons
You won't turn me into stone
Cruel tempting song of the Gorgons
Inside my head always resounds
In the reflection of my sword
You can't escape from your dark gaze
Ironic end for Medusa
Petrified with her magic sight

She has the beauty of the devil
Mistress of the Beasts guardian of the Thresholds
Torn apart my mortal illusions
Her dragonbody moves so close to me
