All I see around me makes my sorrow stronger
The sky is crying on my land
All which was still shining
Has now become darker
The tears of angel are falling ... in my hands

But I feel the breath of heaven reviving the embers of my dying heart
Shining like stars in the night

All cold ashes and dust have blackened the green plain
The sun will sweep (the) shadow
All this blood on my ground is now washed by this rain
The world will always rebirth...I know

And I feel the breath of heaven reviving the embers of my dying heart
Shining like stars in the night
