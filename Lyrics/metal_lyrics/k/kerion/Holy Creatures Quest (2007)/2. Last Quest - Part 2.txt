Far away over the rivers
Far away beyond the hills
Far away this magical journey
Ride with me under the moonlight
Ride with me across the trees
Ride with me in green valleys where the sun shows all its light

Far away over the mountains
Far away beyond the seas
Far away tenacity will pay
Ride with me red is the twilight
Ride with me proud to be free
Ride with me in virgin skies where the winds blow all their might

Come with me follow me follow me my friends
For the land for the ground the misty forest
Victory in my hands fight until the end
Together forever to win the last quest

Far away over the rivers
Far away beyond the hills
Far away this magical journey
Far away over the mountains
Far away beyond the seas
Far away in green valleys where the sun shows all its light

Come with me follow me follow me my friends
For the land for the ground the misty forest
Victory in my hands fight until the end
Together forever to win the last quest
