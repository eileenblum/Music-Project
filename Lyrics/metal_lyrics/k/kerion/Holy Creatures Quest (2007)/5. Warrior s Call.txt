Into the light of the dawn
To all my brothers I swear
Fear, death and sorrow
Won't live tomorrow

Red blood boiling in my veins
My heart pumping for revenge
Always I will stand
To defend my land

So fight with me my friends
Liberty will shine again
In a cloudless clear blue sky
Listen to the warrior's call warrior's call

Before the end of the day
To all of you I promise
Darkness and shadow
Will change in rainbow

Time has come for them to pay
Screaming my anger stronger
Now you understand
This battle will end

So fight with me my friends
Liberty will shine again
In a cloudless clear blue sky
Listen to the warrior's call warrior's call

Heroes of the land
Riding with the Sun
Fighting for the day
Where freedom will reign
Once and for all
