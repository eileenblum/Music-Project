Pillar of the dark forces of chaos
Perfect symbol of might and bestiality
Fantastic monster...looking for warriors to fight

Being neither fully human or beast
Haunting corridors into the labyrinth
What makes him live (is)... "actions speak louder than words"

His thirst of blood grows fast out of control
Violence rules so, he can't resist to its power

Tempus est invidiae... tempestatem

Striking with an heavy hammer of steel
Shaking shields, armors, crushing helmets and skulls
Nothing can stop the...fury of wild Minotaurus

Body of a man but head of a bull
His upset mind belongs forever to darkness
Condemned to roam through... the lands for battlefields

Ultimate rampart for valiant heroes
Before wizards cast their magic spell
Against the legion... of dead, walking to your town
Pillar of the dark forces of chaos
Haunting corridors into the labyrinth
Nothing can stop the...fury of wild Minotaurus
