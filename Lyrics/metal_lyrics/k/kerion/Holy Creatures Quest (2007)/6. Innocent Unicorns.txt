Cum prima luce when the morning mist covers my land
Somewhere in a mystic forest a wonderful glade behind the trees

As pure as the water which flows in a river strong,
Wild and fierce impossible to tame by man
Only a virgin with the freshness of the dew
Sitting against the knowledge stone could catch a delicate unicorn
Cum prima luce when the moon and sun shine together
Keepers of dreams and fantasy
You run free across hills and mountains

Riders of innocence, show me your might
For the safety of the land
Let me touch your alicorn
Riders of innocence, help me to fight
The dark forces of evil
With the power of your horn
