Today I fight for tomorrow
Now comes the fate of the hero
This is my last battle I know
Sun shines over the shadow
Can my sword carry the final victory
Open a way to your own destiny

My friends, I promise, you will show
To your children the land where they will grow
This is the old dream I follow
My hope stronger than my sorrow

Can my sword carry the final victory
Open a way to your own destiny
Winds of revolution blow their might on the ground
Warriors of oppression, we will fight you until the end

Time has come for the final strike
All united against the legion
Time has come for a new twilight
All united to win our freedom
