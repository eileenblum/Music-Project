Step by step walking to your land
One by one all your walls will fall...you will fall
Dust to dust you will return to the ground
Face to face with the devil as guest...came for your rest

Now you are the witness
Of the cruel rise of darkness...you seem hopeless
Bloody battle is going to begin
From your castle do you think you can win?...can you win?

Time has come for you
To face the legion
Skulls and walking-dead
Scream in unison

Here we are the legion of chaos
Fighting for death and sorrow
Here we are the legion of chaos
Coming from the flames of Hell

Day by day we are growing fast
And you ask how long it will last?...it will last
Striking like a volcano blast
Do wizards know the spell to cast?...what spell to cast
