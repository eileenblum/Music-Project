In a world of fantasy
Where the sun shines eternally
We will fly high to be free
Over the land

Bounty hunters and wizards
Pirates and dragon riders
We will fight them one by one
To free our town

You'll pay for it all 
We'll break the wall
And you will fall
Once and for all

Warriors into oblivion 
Will rise throughout the kingdom
And join our quest for freedom
Until the end

Soldiers and mercenaries
Sailors and navigators
Who will change the course and make
This world a better place?
Take me on take me on
Through the waves of the ocean

Take me on 
Far away
Take me on take me on
Through the dark, eternal night
Take me on
Far away from lands
