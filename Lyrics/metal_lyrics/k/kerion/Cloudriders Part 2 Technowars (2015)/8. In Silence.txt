I'm reminded of the days where we used to laugh and play
I'm reminded of your eyes when you'd whisper lullabies 

I'm alone so alone I'm crying in silence because

You're the one only one who gave me eternal love
You're the one who gave me all you had and more

My life is turning grey but I have to make my way
Starless are my skies when I look at the sunrise
I'm alone so alone I'm crying in silence

The memories will stay even if you have gone away
My sweet dream now dies I know it won't realize
