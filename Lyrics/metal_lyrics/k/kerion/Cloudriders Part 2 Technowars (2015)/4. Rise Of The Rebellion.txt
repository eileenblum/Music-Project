We've spent many years in the night
While waiting for the final fight
The time has come now for us to go to
The last battlefield

We're ready to stand for our rights
We're riding beneath the moonlight
Far over the hills and the mountains

We want to make the tyrant pay
And make him go so far away
That he becomes an old memory
Forgotten by all

United we face the enemy
Together we fight to be free
From the golden dawn to the reddish twilight

Tonight we're hanging
The flag of freedom
On every wall of your
Fallen kingdom
Rebels are rising,
The arm of justice
Strikes like a fire blast
And brings us peace

We've stayed too long in the shadows
You must know, that it's time to go
There is no shelter where you can
Hide, you can't escape

We're leaving our children and wives
And we're going to risk our lives
To defend and to protect what we love

I see clouds on the horizon
Revealing a tragic vision
Darkness falls all across the land
And blackens the sky

United we face the enemy
Together we fight to be free
From the golden dawn to the reddish twilight

Tonight we're hanging
The flag of freedom
On every wall of your
Fallen kingdom
Rebels are rising,
The arm of justice
Strikes like a fire blast
And brings us peace
