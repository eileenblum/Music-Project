Men of Skycity save your legacy
Will you survive through this tragedy?

There was a place somewhere lost in the sky
There was a time where ships were able to fly
There was a world where heroes were prepared to die

There was a place somewhere covered by sand
There was a time where warriors of steel walked the land
There was a world which came to a tragic epic end

Open your eyes
Wake up and arise
To fight under darkened skies

Over the clouds illuminated by sunlight
There were people fighting their ultimate fight
Against evil forces that surpassed their might

Open your eyes
Wake up and arise
To fight under darkened skies

Masters of technology will rise
Your power strikes through infinity
Guardians of time and virgin skies 
Your wisdom shines through eternity

People of Skycity will you save your legacy?
will you survive through this sad tragedy
Are you strong enough to defeat all your enemies? 

Beneath the earth somewhere far beyond your sight
There were robots waiting for years to arise
Against evil forces that surpassed their might

Open your eyes
Wake up and arise
To fight under darkened skies

Masters of technology will rise
Your power strikes through infinity
Guardians of time and virgin skies 
Your wisdom shines through eternity
