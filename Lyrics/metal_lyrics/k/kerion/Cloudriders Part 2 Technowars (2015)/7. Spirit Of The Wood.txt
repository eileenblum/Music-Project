Fire and smoke fills the air
Embers and dust cover the ground

Down to the trees
Far from towns and crowns
We lived in harmony and used to be free

High in the sky
Black shadows and claws
Have burned our green forest and broken it's rest

I promise that they will not destroy us
We have to unite and to keep on the fight
I promise that they won't be victorious
We have to unite and to keep on the fight
Keep on the fight

Deep in our memories
Your spirit lives within
And tell us to never forsake our fight
Deep in our memories
Your spirit lives within
And tell us to never betray our soul

Fire and smoke fills the air
Embers and dust cover the ground

Willing to win
Beyond faith and death
Together we will stand and walk through the land
Ready to die
Beyond fear and tears
Far away from our home we'll strike for freedom

I promise that they will not destroy us
We have to unite and to keep on the fight
I promise that they won't be victorious
We have to unite and to keep on the fight
Keep on the fight

Deep in our memories
Your spirit lives within
And tell us to never forsake our fight
Deep in our memories
Your spirit lives within
And tell us to never betray our soul
