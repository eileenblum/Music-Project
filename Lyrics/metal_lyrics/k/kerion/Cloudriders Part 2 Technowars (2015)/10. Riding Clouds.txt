[feat Elisa C. Martin]High in a clear blue sky
Over the clouds we fly
Led by a golden light
We're following our flight

We gotta get our past away
And live for the day

Crossing a dark forest
Beneath the trees we rest
Listening to the whisper
Of a hidden river

We gotta get our past away
And live for the day

We're riding clouds
Beyond lands and seas
To save their legacy
Until the end of time
We're riding free
We're riding clouds
Beyond lands and seas
To rescue skycity
Until the end of time
We will fight together

Sailing on the ocean
Led by constellations
A thousand silver stars
Carry our hopes so far

We gotta get our past away
And live for the day

Across mountains and valleys
We keep on with our journey
When I look in your eyes
I will find Paradise

We gotta get our past away
And live for the day

We're riding clouds
Beyond lands and seas
To save their legacy
Until the end of time
We're riding free
We're riding clouds
Beyond lands and seas
To rescue skycity
Until the end of time
We will fight together

High in a clear blue sky
Over the clouds we fly
Led by a golden light
We're following our flight

We gotta get our past away
And live for the day

We're riding clouds
Beyond lands and seas
To save their legacy
Until the end of time
We're riding free
We're riding clouds
Beyond lands and seas
To rescue skycity
Until the end of time
We will fight together
