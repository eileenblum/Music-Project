Missiles drop 
On your town and your home
Gone are the days of innocence, gone like freedom
It seems so far away, so far today
You are
Baptized in the fire
You have to survive just to fight another day
The sound of bombs resound
Beyond the battlefield

Warriors of the age of chaos
Rise and answer to my call
Iron soldiers save us from our loss
Please don't let us fall

Target locked
On your child and your wife
Gone are the nights of peace and love, gone/lost like your life
It seems so far away, so far today
You are
Brothers in the battle
You have to fight for what you have and what you love
The smell of powder spreads
Across this no-man's land
