Can't you see the world burning?
Are you blind? Open your eyes!
Can't you feel the anger growing? 
Are you asleep? Oh, can't you see?
It's time to rise
Show them that we are alive

Can't you hear the children crying?
Are you deaf? Oh can't you hear?
Don't you know that people are dying?
Are you awake? Are you hypnotized?
So hypnotized
Show them that we are alive

I hear you calling â I hear you calling
Always calling our name
Darkness is calling us
Always calling my name

Don't you think the fall is coming?
Are you lost? Lost in stormy skies
Can't you trust the words I'm saying?
Am I the only one to see passed the lies?
See passed the lies
Show them that we are alive

Can't you hear the bells ringing?
Here we are, now comes the sunrise
Don't you see your dream is ending?
Are you ready to become wise?
To become wise?
Show them that we are alive

I hear you calling â I hear you calling
Always calling our name
Darkness is calling us
Always calling my name
