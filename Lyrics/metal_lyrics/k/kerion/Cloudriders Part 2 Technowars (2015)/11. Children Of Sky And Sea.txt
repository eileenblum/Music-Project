Night has fallen on my town 
and I'm closing my eyes
Everything around me turned out to be all a lie" 
I had to make my way through darkened stormy skies
I had to climb the clouds to paradise 

I can't get you out of my mind, how you mesmerize 
The sweetness of your lips whispers lullabies 
Help me to find the key and together we will rise 
I will bring you back home, yes I promise, I promise 

Here we are children of sky and sea
Flying high to see
The sun shining for all eternity

Fear and doubt have poisoned my thoughts so I wonder 
In my long troubled nights, will I find all the answers? 
Sometimes I am tired of trying to become stronger 
And I wish I could put my head on your shoulder 
The moon enlightens your face with gold and silver 
Everything about you just makes me feel so better 
Now my destiny belongs to you forever 
And I'm longing for the touch of your fingers 

Here we are children of sky and sea
Flying high to see 
The sun shining for all eternity
Even if the world is burning, we will be together
Even if the sky is torn apart by thunder 
Even if our hopes sink like a stone under water
I will be close to you and you'll be mine forever 

Even if the world burns we will be together
Even if the sky is torn apart by thunder
Even if our hopes sink like a stone under water
I will be close to you and you will be mine forever
