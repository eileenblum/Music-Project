[feat. Rachel Aspe]Warriors of the ancient times
Guardians of a secret past
Now come back to life again
Rise and fight to save our world

Sleeping for many years in the ground
Waiting for a signal to awake
Time has come now ti rise and defend
Our beloved holyland

Steel against spells,
Fireblast and swords
Iron warriors will stand and protect
Our peaceful flying world

Long before and far beyond your reign
Robots of the ancient times will blow
You away from our sight, away from our light

Warriors of the ancient times
Guardians of a secret past
Now come back to life again
Rise and fight to save our world

Proud guardians of knowledge and wisdom
Mighty masters of technology
Fight with us for glory and freedom

All over the kingdom
Dragons spit fire on your metal skin
Shred and pierce your armor with their claws
To destroy the soul within

Re-awake from a dark tragic past
Reloaded resurrected you'll go
Through mountains and deserts, forests and rivers

Warriors of the ancient times
Now come back to life again
Guardians of a secret past
Rise and fight to save our beloved land

Warriors of the ancient times
Now come back to life again
Guardians of a secret past
Rise and fight to save our world
