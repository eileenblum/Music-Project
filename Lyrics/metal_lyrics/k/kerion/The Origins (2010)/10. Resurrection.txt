Too much temptation leads to frustration
Everyone would like a resurrection
Another light, another day
Another life to take a new beginning

Too much deception leads to abdication
Everyone would like a sweet illusion
Another night, another pray
Another dream, to wake up in a new world

Too much regression leads to submission
Everyone would like a revolution
Another fight, another way
Another hope, to make a new tomorrow

[Chorus:]
Into the light of the dawn
My kingdom falls
The flame in my mind
Is now burning on my land
In the shadows of the night
Darkness grows up
The ghost in my mind
Is now flying on my land
