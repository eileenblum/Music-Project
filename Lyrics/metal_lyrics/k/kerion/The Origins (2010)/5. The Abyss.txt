Sun's burning over our heads
Ground is breaking under our feets
My helmet falls on my eyes
We're walking since many days
Sunlight's warming our face
Suffering's growing more and more
I've never felt my legs so loud
I've never felt my soul so void
In my mind whistle resounds
In the blue sky shadows fly
A black rain is striking
On all my brothers in arms

Far from my lovely home
Comes a tragic battle long
Swords of steel rise in the sky
Far from my so beloved land
Comes an epic end
Swords of steel rise in the sky
Time has come to fight !

One by one, we're falling
We're lying on the dust
All around me is shaking
All my body's petrified
Time doesn't pass anymore
My breath is hanging on
My heart is pumping faster
Screams of pain tear the sky
Smoke and ashes paint the place
I can't see beyond my arms
I'm a lost in darkness
Lost in the depths of (the) abyss

Far from my lovely home
Comes a tragic battle long
Swords of steel rise in the sky
Far from my so beloved land
Comes an epic end
Swords of steel rise in the sky

Night is coming on the field
Sun is fading behind mountains
Strong winds are blowing the sand
I'm looking for survivors
Cold is freezing my hands
No one answers to my calls
I wonder if I am alone
I wonder if I am alive
I feel warm tears on my cheeks
The smell of blood in the air
I'm waiting for my hand
Far from my so beloved land
