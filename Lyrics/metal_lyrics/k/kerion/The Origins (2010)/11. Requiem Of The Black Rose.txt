A cold night has fallen black as the ashes
Surrounding us black like your eyes
All around has collapsed like a sand castle
Swept by the waves of raging seas
A fire is burning red as the embers
Covering our land red like your blood

All that we had was changed
Into smoke and dust swept by the winds
High in the sky, all our hopes fade away
Like a sweet sunset disappearing into darkness

[Chorus:]
Fallen angels are singing
The black rose requiem
Death bells resound in the air
Announcing our end
Now the black rose is crying
On the tomb of our world
Her tears spread within the land
Announcing our end

[Bridge:]
Our dreams have become
Scary as nightmares
Haunting your mind
Tearing your soul
