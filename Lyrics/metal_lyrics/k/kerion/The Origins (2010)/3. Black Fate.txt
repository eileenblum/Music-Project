Alone in my jail
My screams get lost in the void
My thoughts get lost in the night
I'm waiting for the jury decision
Now I know, the verdict has fallen
I'm asking for my hopeless salvation
From the shadows grow up the fear
Striking my mind
I'm close to madness

Why don't you trust me ?
Believe me, I am not guilty
Let me tell you the truth
I'm innocent !

I can't escape anymore
Prisonner behind this door
Will I see te sun again
Shine over my land ?

Always alone in my jail
My soul gets lost in the black
My hope gets lost in the doubt
Betrayed by me ancient frinds
I really can't understand
Why ? I wanna know why
I really can't believe it
Why ? I do wonder why

Why don't you trust me ?
Believe me, I am not guilty
Let me tell you the truth
I'm innocent !

I can't escape anymore
Prisonner behind this door
Will I see te sun again
Shine over my land ?

I can't escape anymore
Prisonner behind this door
Will I see te sun again
Shine over my land ?

I can't escape anymore
Prisonner behind this door
Will I see te sun again
Shine over my land ?
