In this dark cloudy sky
Blasts a deep far thunder
A cold rain is kissing my face
Moving my soul away
Black crows are flying on my head
Shadows are running on the field

All around me I can see
My fallen brothers' bodies
All around me I can hear
Their slow agony

In this nightmarish land
Covered by grey ashes
I thick fog is hiding the light
And spreading in my thoughts
Demons are fighting in my head
Madness is surrounding my mind

All around me I can see
My fallen brothers' bodies
All around me I can hear
Their slow agony

It is the end of the road ?
Alone and so far from home
Your memories seems so old
I will never see you
I will never go back
Now I am waiting for the sweet kiss of the death
The sweet kiss of the death

Angels of the last hope
You've crossed the sky to save me
From this nightmare
Take me with you

Godess of the last chance
You've crossed the night to save me
From this nightmare
Bring me to life

It is the end of the road ?
Alone and so far from home
Your memories seems so old
I will never see you
I will never go back
Now I am waiting for the sweet kiss of the death
The sweet kiss of the death
