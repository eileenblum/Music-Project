There's no way to go back
There's no more escape
Time has come for me now
To fight my deepest fear
Do I have another solution ?

I am lost in black
Alone in this place
Far away from light
Far away from my land
I wonder if I'll find my salvation

I feel I'm not ready
I feel I don't believe in
My force and my victory
What will happen if I fall ?

I have to face the beast
It's my only choice
Try again and again
Stand until the end

I have to cross mist
Find a blue sky behind
Let me find a way to escape from hell

Fight I will fight
Fighting for right
Rage burns in my heart
No matter the cost
No matter the end
Anger feeds my soul
And reach the grave
