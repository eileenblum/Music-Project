Somewhere the whisper of a river rises from a forest
A new day comes, a new breath of life
Somewhere a flower opens its heart to the sweet red light
A new day burns, a new breath of fire

Across the lands and beyond the far oceans
Beneath the sunlight we will go
Across the lands and beyond the far oceans
Beneath the sunlight always we'll go

We will never know how long long is the road
And how it ends, but yet we go
We will goooo

Somewhere the whistle of the wind spreads in a deep blue sky
A new day goes, a new breath 
Somewhere the silver glow of a moon shines among the stars
A new day dies, a new tomorrow

Across the lands and beyond the far oceans
Beneath the sunlight we will go
Across the lands and beyond the far oceans
Beneath the sunlight always we'll go
