Soft wind blows out the last flames
Under a starless sky Kelvar dreams

I can't see you dying
Dying

Tears and warm blood flood the earth
Those I loved are no more

I can't see you

These whoring Orcs burnt my home
Cold ashes are our towns now

I can't see you dying

Tears and warm blood flood the earth
Those I loved are no more

I can't see you dying

Tears and warm blood flood the earth
Those I loved are no more

I can't see you

Eager for revenge how could I
Have led my friends to my fall

I can't see you dying
Dying
