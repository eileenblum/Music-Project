Black clouds hide the moon
Pelting rain swells the river
Violent lightnings tear the sky
Awaken by a fantastic thunder
Erwin the wizard thinks in his room
"Darkness have swarmed over the magic town"
From the ceiling came up the beast
Striking Erwin she 'scape the library

(Bad) surprise (for the) wizard
(When) he saw all around him
Outlines stealing (the) spell books
He tried to face them

Conspiracy is growing fast
She made an other victim
Who could rise against
This sad evil masquerade

Coming out into his room
Dark Evil book and black bones
Were lying on the broken floor
Banished from the holy school
He promised them to revenge
For this malefic trap
He promised them to revenge
For this terrific trap

(Bad) surprise (for the) wizard
(When) he saw all around him
Outlines stealing (the) spell books
He tried to face them

Conspiracy is growing fast
She made an other victim
Who could rise against
This sad evil masquerade
