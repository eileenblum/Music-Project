Thieves liars and other dealers
Naive stranger beware of this town
Where you all can buy

Dark taverns and narrow alleys
Walk far from cut-throats lied behind
Black nooks and sad walls

Whispers Rumours
Who lies and who tells the truth

Bounty Hunters
Pirates and mercenaries

Wide sewers under the pavement
A guild of thieves has settled in this place
The rats they are called

Sam her friends and other members
Of this guild have been put in jail
Empty were the cells

Durin' the night
Keepers took them away

In the sea-port
Boats were waitin' for them

Close to the mystic elves'kingdom
Among  dunes of white sand
Linin' a sky blue wide sea
Here stands this city
Close to the mystic elves' kingdom
Among  dunes of white sand
Linin' a sky blue wide sea
You will never see
Linin' a sky blue wide sea
Here stands this city

Slowly waves kiss the hull a thick
Fog has fallen on the sweet calm sea
On the deck wearin' a long black
Cloak a cowl hiddin' his face
The ships of darkness
The dark lord is watchin' to the sky-line
