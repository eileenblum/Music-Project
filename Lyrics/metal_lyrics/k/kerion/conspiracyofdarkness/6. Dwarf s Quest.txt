Frozen winds and snowy mountains
Frozen rocks and icy lakes

In this earth brave proud and uncouth
Dwarfs have dug many galleries

One day humans were there
Makin' an offer
Dwarfs should beware
Telling them to work in the mines
They have promised them to bring marvels

(Hard winter and bad wheat-crop
Pushed them to leave their land)

The  night men were sayin' they found their slaves
When Olof overheard
Tryin' to ward off the others
In a dark empty cave they shut him up

(Full of hate became his heart
He reached to 'scape from his jail)

On my axe for my people
I swear not-to rest
Till I'll set you free
And make these bastard paid

(The way is long
The way is hard
But I will never forsaken my owns)

On my axe for my people
I swear not-to rest
Till I'll set you free
And make these bastard paid

(Hard winter and bad whreat-crop
Pushed them to leave their land)

(Full of hate became his heart
He reached to 'scape from his jail)
