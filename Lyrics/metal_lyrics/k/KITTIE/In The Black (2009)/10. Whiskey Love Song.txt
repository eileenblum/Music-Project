Curse your name
A thousand times
Love and hate
Worlds collide

Doors swing open
Fate decided
Take that first taste
In your arms it kills me slowly

[Chorus:]
And I love
You for all
All these nights
I can't remember
And I hate
You for all
All these nights
I WANT TO FORGET!

Amber love
Say my name
Whisper disappointment
Bring me heartache

Doors swing open
Fate decided
Take that first taste
In your arms it kills me slowly

[Chorus]

I DON'T KNOW WHY I LIKE THE FEELING
YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO LET ME DOWN
AND I'M NOT ONE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT
BUT I WILL DRINK YOU TILL I DROWN

[Chorus]
