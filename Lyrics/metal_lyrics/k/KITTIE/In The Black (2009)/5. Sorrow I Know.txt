This feeling is endless
Hollow voids cannot be filled
This unrest relentless
To want and never, ever have

I know
Sorrow I know

This longing is ageless
Underneath the blackened sky
I still remain nameless
The night's ablaze and so am I

I know
Sorrow I know

Beckoning, spiraling
Do your bidding
Angels sing

[Instrumental Break]

Oh, I know
Sorrow I know
