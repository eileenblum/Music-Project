Hopelessly in love with death
The beast, she breathes her lonely breath
To cast away the last of love until there's only heartache
From love to lust
From death to dust
The things we feel, we cannot trust
The emptiness consumes my blood until this love's a burden

I know, I know the truth that hides inside
I know, I know the truth becomes a lie

I know, I know what it's like to burn alive
Full is never as burdened as emptiness
Rotting conscience left behind
And they will bow down before me
Pledge allegiance on one knee
And there is nothing else,
Only hatred
Fuck the world
It's just you and me

I know, I know the truth that hides inside
I know, I know the truth becomes a lie

Is it the truth or is it a fucking lie?

Fucking lie
No, no, no

Lie, no
