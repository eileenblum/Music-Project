I want to hate this
I cannot lie
Candy suicide
I think that I might die

ENDLESS TORTURE PLAYED OUT
TIME AND TIME AGAIN
WIPE THE BLOOD AND TEARS
I MUST LET THIS IN

[Chorus:]
This is the sweetest kiss of death
It's now or never, do or die
This is the sweetest kiss of death
It's now or never, do or die

The sweetest ending
Without a name
Every corner's dark
And everyday's the same

CRUCIFY THE WICKED
TIME DISTORTED PAST
THIS TIME IT'S SHOOT TO KILL
Let this be the last...

[Chorus]

The sweetest kiss of death...
It's do or die...
Do or die...

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
