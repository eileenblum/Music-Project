The path through life
Unseen and unheard
Of babies' breath or less
Blind to the truth
Like sheep led to slaughter
A rose will bring an end to this

Let them fall behind, let them see
Vanishing the light

Destroy the weak
Learn to think before you speak
Oww!

Ready, aim... riot!
Ready, aim... riot!

Enslaved like beasts
By unseen hands
Your kind will cease to thrive
To burn like brush
The flames arise
Until nothing's left alive

Let them fall behind, let them see
Vanishing the light

Destroy the weak
Learn to think before you speak

Ready, aim... riot!
Ready, aim... riot!

Destroy the weak
Learn to think before you speak
Let's raise the bar
Rid us of the ones who are...

[Brief Instrumental Break]

Destroy the weak!
Learn to think before you speak!
Let's raise the bar!
Rid us of the ones who are...!

Ready, aim... riot!
Ready, aim... riot!

Ready, aim... riot!
Ready, aim... riot!
