Now the party's over
The last stone is cast
Your days of destruction
Will surely be your last
Just swallow this pill
YOU'LL SUFFER UNTO ME NOW!
One foot into the grave

[Chorus:]
Die! Die! My darling
I wanna see you fall tonight
Die! Die! My darling
I wanna see you fall...

Now it's curtains for you
You've done wrong
You're so vain, I think you'd take
Credit for this song
The blue pill, the red one?
YOU'LL CUT YOURSELF DOWN ONE DAY!
One foot into the grave

[Chorus]

COME CLOSER! STILL CLOSER!
I WANT TO SEE YOUR EYES DIM!
COME CLOSER! STILL CLOSER!
I WANT TO SEE YOUR EYES DIM!

Die! Die! My darling
I wanna see you fall tonight
Die! Die! My darling
I wanna see you fall tonight
Die! Die! My darling
I wanna see you fall tonight
Die! Die! My darling
I wanna see you fall
I want to see you fall
Fall, fall, fall...
