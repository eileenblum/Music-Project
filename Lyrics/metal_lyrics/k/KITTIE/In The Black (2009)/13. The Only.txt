[Bonus Track]

I can see that Iâm not there
I can feel it in the air

I can see that Iâm not there
I can feel it in the air
Iâm still reeling from it all
Pain and despair
Foggy mornings take their share

And I say
Youâre the only one who looks right through to see the truth
Take it back
Donât look back
And I do what will

There are things that I cannot say
Ugly truths get in the way
Iâm still reeling from it all
Donât ever say
I can make it go away

And I still say
Youâre the only one who looks right through to see the truth
Take it back
Donât look back
And I do what will

Youâre the only one who looks right through to see the truth
Take it back
Donât look back
And I do what will

Dead inside
Why do I deserve this?
Dead inside
I must bring this to light
I have tried
I canât take it all back
Full of lies

God dammit youâre the only one

Dead inside
Why do I deserve this?
Dead inside
I must bring this to light

I can see that Iâm not there
I feel it in the air
