And what of passion?
And what of shame?
We have suffered both the same
And what of regret?
And what of hate?
The price we pay is all too great

[Bridge:]
Callous are your thoughtless ways
I hope and pray for better days

[Chorus:]
Disguised behind the lies
Do you not realize?
This is heartless, this is heartless
Disguised behind the lies
Do you not realize?
This is heartless, this is heartless
THIS IS CUT THROAT!

And what of forgiveness?
And what of blame?
Does your venom spew my name?
And what of resentment?
So what if I'm damned?
Vicious actions deserve reprimand

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
