In between life and death
I need a place where I can rest
Not black nor white
I've tried my best

Always grey is where I hide
I never want to choose a side
Not dark nor light
Always unsatisfied

I've fallen down again
I've fallen down again

In the midst of pain and pride
In solemn center I confide
The rising tide
Swallows the light
(SWALLOWS THE LIGHT!)

I've fallen down again
I've fallen down again

[Brief Instrumental Break]

I've fallen down again
I've fallen down again
And...
I've fallen down again
I've fallen down again

I've fallen down again...
I've fallen down again...
