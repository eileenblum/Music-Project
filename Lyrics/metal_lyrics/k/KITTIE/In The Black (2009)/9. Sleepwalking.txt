Watching me fall
Into the flames
Of a broken soul tonight
No stone overturned
This graveyard of mine
Allows me no peace

[Chorus:]
Sleep as day dies
Sleepwalk with the dead
Wander aimlessly through the night

Love and regret
Course through my veins
As I slowly fade away
Please let me sleep
Just one last night
Before I must wake

[Chorus]

And I walk with these ghosts
And I walk with these ghosts
And I walk with these ghosts...

[Chorus]

Sleep as night falls
Sleepwalk with the dead
Hope keeps me alive
Through this life
