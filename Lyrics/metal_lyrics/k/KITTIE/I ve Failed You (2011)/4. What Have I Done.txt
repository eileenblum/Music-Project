These tears I've cried a thousand
I'm slowly losing ground
Oh, what have I done?
Oh, a setting sun
Oh, what have I done?
Oh, a setting sun
In silence Cold December
Just barely treading water
If to live is to suffer,
I have lived a thousand lives
Over and over, had my happiness denied
Lifeless and souless and
loveless and hopeless
A pathetic mess in a heap on the floor
I am the catalyst,
destroyer of my own world
