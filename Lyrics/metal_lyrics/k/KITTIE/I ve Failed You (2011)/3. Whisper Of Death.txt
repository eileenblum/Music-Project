All that I had,
I let slip through my hands
Poison to everything I touch.
The things I've done, so ruinous
Decaying love, a bondage broken,
Crumbling in my hands
Every word, destroying us
From my lips, born plague and death
The ghosts of the past come back to haunt me
Dressed in ash
The coldest whisper of death,
Breathing the end
Burn it down like a wildfire,
Goodbye my friend
I've learned to live without life
Defeat has taken my dying light
Lay down your arms, lay down your heart
The weight of your gravestone
the weight of my regret
A heavy heart as cold as marble
The promise, defying us
Weakness became my
greatest strength
