Tied to this post, without foresight, of what's to come
The lamb he sings, the song of the martyr
He is the chosen one
The one to help us fail. The one to let us grow
The torch is passed on. We are the lamb
And who have we become now? A life longed to be lived?
Our fierce love, destined to destruct
By our own selfish hands.
The one to help us fail As blood runs cold
The torch is passed on, We are the lamb
We have so much to gain,
But our hearts won't let us learn
Blinded by the pain of loss
And who have we become now?
We are the lamb
