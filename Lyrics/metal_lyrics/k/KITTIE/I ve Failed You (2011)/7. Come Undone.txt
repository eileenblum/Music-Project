I cast away the last of these cahins
A loveless servitude awaits
A starlight delusion, the whisper of change
Feeds me like a starving wolfe
The blood of your own act
Marking the night sky
And follows you wherever you go
Freedom of will, extends out before me
Into the unknown
Out Of the fire
Rise from the flame
I've come undone
Born of a bad sign
As black as the night sky
The endless darkness heaves
A prison, built of our own flesh
Painted with the blood of deceit
To break away from the comfort of safety,
And dance with an untamed beast
Enslaved by an unrest, a self imposed exile
To mourn alone, my only release
There's no turning back
We will forever be,
united in loss
