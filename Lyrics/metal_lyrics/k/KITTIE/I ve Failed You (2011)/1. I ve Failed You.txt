The colors of my summer dress have led out, faded to grey
I wear it like a scarlet letter, I cannot wipe away this stain
Can't you see that I've failed you
Look now I've failed you
Ugly and telling, I rub my hands but still, the dirt remains
Just let me lie here,
For its the fucking bed I made.
Can't you see that I've failed you
Look now I've failed you
