You learn to swim, if it doesn't kill you
Cried this ocean to reality
Tides will wash away what's left of the city,
And the flood will pull you under with me
These streets have all but been abandoned
Even empires will fall
And here we are, we sit in silence
There is nothing left to say
Our lives lay scattered in the
midst of the ruins
Giving up is the only way
These streets have all but
been abandoned
Even empires will fall
These castles somehow built
to crumble
Even empires will fall
Let the waves overtake me
As I fall to the floor
Let the black water fill me
Love exists here no more
