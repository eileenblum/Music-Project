Destroy the spirit and the body will follow,
unraveling before you
No pulse, the void of my heart
Warmth and meter cease
I felt the end upon me but
I was already dead
A silence without warning
I was already dead
I writhe amongst the worms,
mmy words are now my spade.
Raising my hands to the sky,
The light forever beyond my reach
I felt the end upon me
I was already dead
A silence without warning
I was already dead
This is my curse
A waking nightmare
The plague of man defies me
I fear the worst
There is nothing inside me
