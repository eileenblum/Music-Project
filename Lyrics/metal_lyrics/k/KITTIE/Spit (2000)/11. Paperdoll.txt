I Look At her In That Paper Dress.
I Wonder Why She Won't Burn.
She's Just A Paper Doll, Thats All, Just A Paper Doll.
I Dress Her Up She Knocks Me down [2x]
They Try Her On For Size, she Fits Nice.
One Size Fits All [2x]
Now Her Soul Is Dead, Now Her Bodies Raw, You Can Numb Her Pain
Watch The Blood Run Down Her Face.
But Don't Take Notice.
Watch The Blood Run Down Her Arms.
Please Don't Take Notice.
I Know You Have Her Soul.
(and) I See It In Your Eyes.
She Knows You Have Her Soul.
(and) She Sees It In Your Eyes.
Now Her Soul Is Dead, Now Her Bodies Raw, WASH AWAY HER PAIN
She Wants You To Eat Her Pain.
She Wants You To Eat Her Remains [2x]
