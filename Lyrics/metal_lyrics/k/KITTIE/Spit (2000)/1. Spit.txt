COWARD!!

spit I think I'll spit
For all those girls, who speak contradiction
The guy who crept through the shadows everyday to clutch his own conclusion
Watch all the blood, as it drips from your veins you coward
Godspeed, may your death come quickly

I think I'll take this hate and , SPIT, SPIT, SPIT

Now as it's passed onto the next one I feel a bloodrush come right over me
You know you will never be right in the eyes of the ones who know
You trusted the devil and she will betray you

Low

Why do I get shit all the time from you men
You are swine
You think dick is the answer
But it's not [x2]
