The knife is on the table
I put myself to sleep
All I know is all I know
Remember, what you sow is what you reap

How could I fucking believe you?
This is too much for me
The little sheltered girl
Is what I'll always be

Self-loathing, inconsiderate
Too scared of what I'll be
I look into the mirror
The whore is all I see

Like you
Like me
Diminished, self-imploding
I'll never see
Like you
Like me
I never want
To be like me

Do you think I'm a whore?
I'm a whore
I'm a whore
I'm a whore

Why can't I fucking believe you?
This is too much for me
The little sheltered girl
Is what I'll always f*cking be

Self-loathing, inconsiderate
Too scared of what I'll be
I look into the mirror
The whore is all I see

Like you
Like me
I'll never change
I'm stubborn you see
Like you
Warned me
Lonely
For eternity

I'm a whore
I'm a whore
I'm a whore
I'm a whore
I'm a whore
I'm a whore
I'm a whore
I'm a whore
I'm a whore
