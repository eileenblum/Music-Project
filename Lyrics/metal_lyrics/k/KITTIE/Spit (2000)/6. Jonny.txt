What does he tell me this time? We're just whores on a fucking assembly line.
Believe me I was there. Take what I want and get the fuck out of here.
let's raise the wall, somebody, to raise the wall.
Suck me. Johnny's been a very bad boy [X3]
Johnny's been a very bad boy....This door is so high.
My life is oblivious to you and the sun hurts my eyes,
but remember you were not going to raise the wall.
stop me, to raise the wall.
(ooh) and you look at me, see through me,
I am nothing to you, you look at me, see through me,
I am nothing to you, what does it want to be?
you know you love me.
you want to ruin me, I take this end.
Destroy this in me but if you want someone...
one will come down fighting for you!
