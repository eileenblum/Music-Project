Your hate sustains me
Such suffering comforts me
Your failures take me elsewhere
Your choices set me free
I know you watch me
I know your every move
This game is over
There is nothing left to prove
This is the end of Eden
This is my last goodbye
I've laid to rest the demons
Still, I'd love to watch you die

There is nothing left to cry for
My blessing is your curse
I've had enough of torture
I hope you feel it worse
I know you watch me
I know you every move
This game is over
There is nothing left to prove
There are no enemies left
Such things are born from grief
I grow stronger with every glance
Each time my name you speak
