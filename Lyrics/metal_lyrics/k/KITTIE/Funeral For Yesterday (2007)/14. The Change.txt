Deposition
I'd lay to rest my being
Solemn death march took in stride
Funeration
That was my elegy
Open casket full of lies
The last rites have been spoken
It's time to die, then rise
Out of the flames
Unearth the change
Nothing can stay the same
Out of the flames

We'll rise again
Dying is not the end
Sweet revenge for
Attempts to bury me
Suffering will serve you right
Deliverance from
This cry for amnesty
I will stand and take what's mine
All mine
The last rites have been spoken
It's time to die, then rise
