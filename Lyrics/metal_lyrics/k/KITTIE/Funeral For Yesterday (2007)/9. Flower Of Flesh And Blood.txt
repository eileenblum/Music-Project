My sweet obsession
My greatest masterpiece
When I undress you
Everything falls in place
I will control you
This flower of flesh and blood
True crimson blooming
I'll tear the petals off of you
Flower of flesh
My love will die for it

Boundless and red
My love lies motionless
My own creation
My one and only slave

Into the darkness
The hate of hell is boundless
This blade consoles you
True beauty staining through
This love destroys you
And there is nothing you can do
