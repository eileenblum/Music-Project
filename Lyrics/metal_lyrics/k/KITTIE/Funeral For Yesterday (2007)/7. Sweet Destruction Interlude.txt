Life is cold when you're wounded
Nothing stings so deep
I'm in love with this weakness
It's becoming me
I'm not here
In this moment
Will this last forever?

Oh my sweet Lies,
Destruction
Be the death of me
There are things
Left unspoken
Built on broken dreams
I would end my life for this
Would you die for me?
