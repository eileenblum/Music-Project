Straight faced
In your embrace
Gripped around my heart
Innocent I plead my case
I'm never going back
Please don't unwind
This tether twined
Around your heart
This tether breaks

Decay
Erase
Finish what you start
I know that it's not too late
To save us from ourselves
Remember when your smile
Made everything worthwhile
Finish what you start
