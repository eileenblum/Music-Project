An act of desperation
When will this ever end?
My sorrow turns to hatred
You'll get my sweet revenge

Lies, deception
I've never been so strong
Lies, deception
You've never been so wrong

Never again will I let this
Never Again
You'll beg for mercy now

Never again will I let this destroy my plans
You'll beg for mercy

I'm bitter to the core now
I've seen those kingdoms fall
All trust has crumbled slowly
I'll build up higher walls

Lies, deception
I've never been so strong
Lies, deception
I've never been so wrong
