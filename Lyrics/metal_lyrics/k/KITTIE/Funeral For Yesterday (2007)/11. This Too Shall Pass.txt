My heart's a scar now
Thick skin will never mend
I've learned my lessons well

I've felt destruction
The harsh reality
Everyone leaves you in the end

So tear the memories Burn them all
(There is nothing you can say that can change it)
I take them all back
This is final
(I have severed all the ties and am moving on)

There's no forever
You're all you'll ever have
My hates eclipsing all
This too shall pass
This too shall pass

They'll leave you hollow
Stranded no hand to hold
A bleak epiphany

I take them all back
I take them all back
I take them all back
