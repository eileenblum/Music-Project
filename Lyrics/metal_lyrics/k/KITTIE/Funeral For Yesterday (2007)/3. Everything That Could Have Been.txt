There is an art, to falling apart
Just follow steps 1 through 10 and you're done
When you don't know yourself, anymore
It's time to get out of here
Just take my hand there is nothing to fear
Another day is wasted again

And everything that could have been
A burden I still bear
Even though you're gone
I'm still holding onto everything that could have been

Even though you're gone I'm still holding onto everything that could have been

Mistakes, I've made a few
Look at the mess that I've made and you'll see
That things don't always go as planned
Mistrust, the source of this pain
You say you're angry, there's no one to blame but you and the choices you've made

I wonder what could have been
Is this the end?
I wonder what could have been
Is this the end?
