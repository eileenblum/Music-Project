And this love will be the death of me
Blank eyes see no end
Pulse is weak
Your skin is turning blue
I can't let go of you

Hope is gone
The light is dim again
I'm praying for a sign
Fragile hearts
A face so porcelain
This blow surely break you
I am at the end of all of life's decisions
It's not too late

Can you, will you please be there for when it all comes down?
In slow motion
I'll hold on to this empty shell
It's everything I have
Lower me into the ground before all of these crumbles onto me
And I will hold you
And I will hold you down
Alive to see your death
You'll never make a sound
And I will hold you
And I will hold you down
You'll be forever
And never make a sound
