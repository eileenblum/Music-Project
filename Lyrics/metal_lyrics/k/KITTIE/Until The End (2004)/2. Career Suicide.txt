Vindiction bleeds you
From every pore
Until hope runs out
Until my feet leave the floor
The first trace of that too familiar feeling
Smiles and daggers
Hearts are bleeding

Don't say no
I'll soon know

[chorus]
Convictions see you through
Are you all you know?

Your faded costume is wearing thin
Was there no comfort in you own skin?
You always were a slow learning inside your ugly living lies
Tell yourself that
Next time you cry

Don't go
Don't go
Don't do it
