I feel trapped and it's all in my dirty hands
These walls are closing in

You always were so hard to please
You thought you had me on my knees

I think I'm going under
Red flags for all of this

You're cold and calculating
A knife held to my lips
And this anticipating
Blade bleeding for a kiss

[chorus]
This is the day, and you wait
Is this fate, laying waste
And you'll stay here forever
Stay here forever

And all that's left are scars
And lies
Whispering while beauty dies

I claw my neck for answers
As last life slips away

Take me away
