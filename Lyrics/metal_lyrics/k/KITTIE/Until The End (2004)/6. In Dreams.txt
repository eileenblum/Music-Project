Everytime I speak
Wipe away all these tears
Living every day in fear
Finding nothing but empty

[chorus]
Wide awake and dreaming
Is this what it seems?
Close my eyes forever
I'll wake up

Desperation strips me
These last days have not been free
Stealing every breath from me
Whispering defeat

And I see it in your eyes
Long gone
And i feel it in your heart
Long gone
And I see it in your eyes
Long gone, long gone
