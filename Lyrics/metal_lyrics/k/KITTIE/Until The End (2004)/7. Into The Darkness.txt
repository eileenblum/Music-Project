I feel helpless, waiting
Could this all be the end?
It's coming down all at once
Am I losing you?

No way out

[chorus]
Until this all crashes down, I'll hold on
Into the darkness, not knowing at all

Are you out there waiting, wondering about me?
I've never felt so alone as I do now

Hold on to me
