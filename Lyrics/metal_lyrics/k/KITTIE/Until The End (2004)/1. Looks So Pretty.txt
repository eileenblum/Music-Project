Say what you will
I will walk past that plate of glass
Your time has passed

Don't ever say it's my time
Burning hatred will light my way

A choice not an echo

And as your world comes down,
I will be there

[chorus]
You look so pretty, digging your grave
You look so pretty, what's left to save?

Say what you will
Eyes to the skies

You look so pretty right now
