Hell above
Your star is below

There's no comprehension
There's no voice of reason here

Fairy tales dividing
Broken wings unfold
Before you

Take a look at what you've become

[chorus]
Hell above
Your star is below
All I see
Covered in dirt
Hell above
Your star is below
All hope dies
Burning Bridges

I'll take the truth before trust
When the world comes crashing down

Embrace the pain
In a world of lies

(YOW!)

I'll take the truth before trust
Flight betrayed you
Clipped your own

Take a look at what you've become

One truth for you
