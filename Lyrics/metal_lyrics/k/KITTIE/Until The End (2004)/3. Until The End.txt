Wings spread, poised
Fantly Convulsing the sky
How will I know?
Bask now in this graying light
Search for that word
Something likened goodbye
How will I know that they will cry?

[chorus]
We were blessed
(in this lifetime)
Laid to rest
(all we live for)
We were blessed

Voices ring on
Autumn is always at hand
Angels corpses
Hollow and stolen so fast
I heard your voice
And it spoke softly to me
We have this time
And then we're free

Take me under
Take me under
