I feel helpless, stare in disbelief
How can you still sleep at night?

Hold her with just one look,
Just one foot she's innocent
Put your hands around my neck
Stripping me of all my dignity

Vendetta black against her
Your bloody mouth against her

Raped of everything she owned
It's so lonely at the bottom
Putting pieces of a puzzle
Back together we've forgotten

[chorus]
Throw your daughters down
Hold your daughters down

Seeing beauty turn to waste
Let your ego be the death of me
Hand held tight behind my back
Stealing all that's precious to me

Would you do this to your own?
Breaking, lying to my face
I can see you're still the same
Killed before and kill again

I WILL FIGHT UNTIL THE DEATH
