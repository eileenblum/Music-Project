I can taste the wreckage
Of dismembered dreams
Ghostly disciple, nothing as it seems
I will follow you until this dark cloud recedes
Pain of another, heal this I plead

My heart still bleeds for you

[chorus]
Take the long way home
My heart still bleeds for you

Solemn times stain us like
The blood of all that's unknown
This cursed you the worst
Give me your love

Solemn times stain us like
The blood of all that's unknown
