Trusted you
With my life
Shattered dreams
Broken glass
I hope there is closure
Down your path
For I have yet to find
The means to forgive
So what if you were all I had?
Is it over?
Wasting away
And forget to see
Go choose your way
Leaving everything
You walked away
Did it make it easier on you?
So what now?
Life must go on still haunted
You know how hard it is to face this day
I hope it is good for you
I tried, oh how I tried, but it's broken
Let me go, I could have died
