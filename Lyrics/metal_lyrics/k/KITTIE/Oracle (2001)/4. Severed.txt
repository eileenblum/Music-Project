Look at you now
Eyes wide open
Truth begged to be told
I walk around in circles to revisit Where I've always been
You spoke of where your heart was 
I thought
I knew you well 
Ties that bind you have been severed
Look at you now
Eyes wide open
Truth begged to be told
I want to make you feel this
Trusting arms let me fall once again
I stood close to an enemy and Closer to a friend
Ties that bind you have been severed.
Look at you now
Eyes wide open
Truth begged to be told
