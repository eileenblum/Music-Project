A glance over your own shoulder 
A vow that today will stand out Caged in a routine
Intent unknown
The element Of surprise 
Impact undetermined but vast
Mark me...
Brandishing a cold loaded smile Simplicity, 
subtlety, discordance fate and allegory
Everything has it's purpose and you will suffer for what you've done
