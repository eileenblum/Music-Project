Indeed I will condescend
Exhausting every trace to give you,
What you asked for
Everything you demanded you bleed right from me
At last, I will be free
And the phoenix rises
Invasion of my last hope
For once just know your place
We are only human
Everything you demanded you bleed right from me
So weak you cannot see
Corruption at its finest
