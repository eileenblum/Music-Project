In the darkness
Troubled water
Lies a flicker
Of hopes fire
Come to your senses
Wager a risk
I won't let go
Waiting for this
It's wonderful
Reality
I watch as
This golden bird flies free
Down
Never
When this breath, is done
And know me I can't
See
For what happend to be
And the end...
In this ash-vault
A rose garden
These walls will never
See me just to
Save me
Save me
