Blood spilled 
Heart-felt 
Head filled 
Play dead...
Consider yourself now, my friend Enemy number one
You are bound and gagged, sacred circle broken trust
Now the plague has been cast in your town, acid tongue venom word
Why bother to lie? 
Leave the lamp behind.
Your mouth full of (lead and lies) 
Don't walk in to fire 
You might find that you'll get burned
What a find dirty face 
Guilt at last, is this a lesson that's learned? 
Can you hear your own blood in your veins, calling out your demise? 
Silence a word to the wise...
Your mouth full of (lead and lies)
I can't hear you scream 
Drowning so it seems your mouth is full of poison...
