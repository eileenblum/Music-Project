I feel your pain
Almost lost it all
You are all the same
The wounded bleed to death
Tarnish my name
You deserve nothing at all... 
You knew that life was a game...
You deserve nothing at all... 
You must endure your own PAIN!
Life in the dark without a light
Hollow empty 
Let's get it right
You deserve nothing at all... 
You knew that life was a game...
You deserve nothing at all...
Red dress serpent... 
Just stop it.. 
Just stop it...
Red dress serpent and you'll stay here!
You deserve nothing at all... 
You knew that life was a game...
You deserve nothing at all... 
YOU MUST ENDURE YOUR OWN PAIN!
