You fell to the ground like rain
On deaf ears your cries met hands And knees were blistered
Shouting from the tallest tree
You declared wrong
But they never listen
There's safety in numbers 
This cold-hearted world! 
The Coldest Winter...
You don't see me like I know you
Hiding behind glass
So sickened by grief
You can't let them win
They'll have you
Playing life makes death so good
This cold-hearted world! 
The Coldest Winter...
You don't know, And you never will!
