Opened up it's revealed
Savour this
Dont get lost in a lie
Hit or miss
Beside, my self, with doubt
push on what's to come must be proved
Focus bliss
Charcoal stares
One foot at a time
Smear those lies
I thought I found (once i fought)
What I always wanted
Bear with me (bear with me)
I thought I found (once i fought)
What I always wanted
Bear with me (bear with me)
Certainty
Not at hand
I can't keep my eyes shut
Chose not to listen
I thought I found (once i fought)
What I always wanted
Bear with me (bear with me)
I thought I found (once i fought)
What I always wanted
Bear with me (bear with me)
I got what I wanted
I got just what I always wanted
I got what I wanted
I got just what I always wanted
Once
I
Fought
