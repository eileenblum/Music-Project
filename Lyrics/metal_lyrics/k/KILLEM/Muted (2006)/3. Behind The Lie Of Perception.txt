[Music: EscaÃ±o. Lyrics: Nissen]

Pierced by a thousand doubts

Confusing path
Abstract voice
Endless stream
of intellectual void

Trapped into oppressive
individuality
Blinded by the dark light
of corporeality

Subjective perspective
of what reality
has hidden deep inside
the plane of humanity

Frustrated
by the uncertain
Now I am searching
the way to know

Shocked by the unknown

Introspective
questioning
of the pillars
of existence

Perception is a lie
that conceals the real form
of the universal truth
from mankind's erratic thought

What are the true barriers
of our consciousness?
What's behind human mind?
Soul or just emptiness?

Frustrated
by the uncertain
Now I am searching
the way to know
