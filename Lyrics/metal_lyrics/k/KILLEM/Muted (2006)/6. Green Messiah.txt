[Music: EscaÃ±o / Silvestre. Lyrics: Nissen]

Forget all your convictions
and follow the only religion
Here the sinner is the poor
A master of corruption
that feeds on your ambition
The holy rule is to want more

Green messiah,
The only god of the human race
Obsessive desire,
Looking for weak minds to degrade

In this faith souls are for rent,
creed grows with your investments
Property is the worshipped cult
Profits are the true blessing,
sacred are your belongings
Greed is the dogma to survive

Green messiah,
The only god of the human race
Obsessive desire,
Looking for weak minds to degrade
