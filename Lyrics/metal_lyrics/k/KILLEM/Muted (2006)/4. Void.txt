[Music, Lyrics: EscaÃ±o]

Burns, like the fire, destroying everything
Faith, a desire, rotting the brain
No perception, no reaction, imagination's tomb
Muted voices, silenced noises by a thousand gods

Feel the void in yourself
Follow the mass that thinks for you burning every hope
Rage's annihilated and the mind's void grows
Be born or die but don't disturb, the screen will build the path
Collect possessions with obsession, but don't raise your head

Feel the void in yourself
Follow the mass
Feel the void in yourself
Follow the mass

Feel the void in yourself
Follow your way, scream and shout, make their eardrums explode
Fight, don't conform, make your dreams come true
Change your luck and change your life, react, refuse, improve
Go your own way, seek your place, and find your own truth

Feel the force in yourself
Follow your way
Feel the force in yourself
Follow your way
