[Music: EscaÃ±o / Silvestre. Lyrics: Nissen]

Narrow-minded king of the streets
You are the parasite
It is time to eradicate you
Before the infection grows

Violence is the medicine
to make you understand
You're a malignant tumor
that has to be removed

I've found the cure - The cure is death

You are the Cancer
I am the surgeon

There is no anesthesia
this time you'll feel the pain
The operation time has come
Your suffering has begun

Brutality is the vaccine,
my hands will tear apart
all the corrupted tissue
infected by your breath

I've found the cure - The cure is death

You are the Cancer
I am the surgeon
