[Music: EscaÃ±o / Silvestre. Lyrics: Nissen]

Against weakness
I stand
I don't need your tricks
I'm completely fueled by hate
Power
pumping through my veins
Perfect engine, burning soul
I won't take the shortcut
your chemistry's offering me

Emancipation
Through determination

I can feel the fire,
The will to improve myself
It's burning inside
the core of my integrity
I don't need your
dose of artificial strength
I live with full force,
no need to poison my blood

Fuck your chemical
supremacy
Adrenaline's flowing free
pounding deep inside my heart
Don't
try to match my speed
It is pride what gives me strength
An internal flame
impossible to put out

Emancipation
Through determination

I can feel the fire,
The will to improve myself
It's burning inside
the core of my integrity
I don't need your
dose of artificial strength
I live with full force,
no need to poison my blood
