[Music, Lyrics: EscaÃ±o]

Rivers of death flowing near
More children are dying again
There is not victory, there's just pain
in killing people without care

Madness has begun
Innocent faces lose their voice
The crime starts again
when lightning becomes flames

Their hands in blood make them stronger
Disjoining helps them to kill
Suicidal men that are puppets
when they arrive at the field

Changing gold for blood
Making heroes that eclipse the sun
The story's the same
when lightning becomes death

It's the neverending pain

Fear is not an option now
Weapons spit and people die
Killing in the name of a flag
tainted red by years of fight

Selling peace with war
Politicians trade with human souls
Seeking glory in death
when lightning becomes pain

It's the neverending pain
