[Music: EscaÃ±o. Lyrics: Nissen]

I wonder if my life
could be so empty
I wonder if you exist
and a shiver burns my soul

I prayed so many nights
to fight my reason
But everything's in vane,
Inside me still lies the question

Tormentor
conflict within

Redemption
now seems a lie

No way to
hide from disgrace

I'm waiting
to face the truth

Holy Bible's been my guide,
sacrifice my way of life

Selfishness is the only way
to end this dark crisis of faith

No way to justify
what I am going to do

If you exist, punishment
is what this poor soul deserves

Suicide becomes the way
to unveil the secret
If my god really exists
for this sin I'll burn in hell

A holy minister
twisted by stigmas
Ashamed of my heresy,
as a sinner I'll end my priesthood

Tormentor
conflict within

Redemption
now seems a lie

No way to
hide from disgrace

I'm waiting
to face the truth

The end is coming
I can't stand this suffering

Now I will be freed from a life of pain and agony

I'll take this weapon,
with a shot I'll end the doubt

It's worth losing my life to know the truth... Forgive me lord
