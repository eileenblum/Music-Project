[Music: EscaÃ±o / Silvestre. Lyrics: Demise / Nissen]

People get shocked when I arrive
To this wheelchair I am chained
But my mind's alive
trapped in this broken shell

Trying to control my spasms
While my dribble stains my clothes
And my eyes are begging
"please take my hand"

I only need understanding,
I am not dead yet
I don't wanna be shut in myself,
I wanna run away

I am trying to express myself
but my mouth won't say a word
I would like to stand up
shouting my name

If only I could understand
why god did this to me?
A misdrawn caricature
that's what I am

I only need understanding,
I am not dead yet
I don't wanna be shut in myself,
I wanna run away

You can see the same again,
people are pitying me

My life lies in others' hands
like a puppet without strings
I'm completely useless,
but they're keeping me alive

Who cares about what I do?
If my fate's already sealed
I think they must let me
follow my way

I only need understanding,
I am not dead yet
I don't wanna be shut in myself,
I wanna run away

You can see the same again,
people are pitting me

Am I dreaming? Am I dead?
All my thoughts are sinking into the void

I can stand up, now I can explain
All I've felt throughout this endless pain

I am falling into the unknown
Darkness never seemed so bright before

For this poison, I have to thank
The friendly hand that finally freed my soul
