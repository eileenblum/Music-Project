[Music: EscaÃ±o. Lyrics: Nissen]

It's only goddamn hate
against your cowardice
You just don't have the guts
to face me head to head

Hate, just hate, Hate

It's only you and me
no knives, no guns, just hands
Don't try to call your friends
I'll take you one on one

Hate, just hate, Hate

Hate, pure hate, hate
