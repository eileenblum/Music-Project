After the storm we rise again
Though we've been in the depths of a dark world
We see the light compelling us forward
And once again, begin a new ending

Sounds from heaven, voices of angels
Or the curse of damnation
To live forever, to live forever
Until the end of time

The truth is false, the wrong is right
The world keeps going on and on
We stand in line, the line of fire
It never seems to end

To live forever, to live forever
The world keeps going on and on
To live forever

To live forever, to live forever
The world keeps going on and on
To live forever

Sounds from heaven, voices of angels
Or the curse of damnation
To live forever, to live forever
Until the end of time

The truth is false, the wrong is right
The world keeps going on and on
We stand in line, the line of fire
It never seems to end

To live forever, to live forever
The world keeps going on and on
To live forever
