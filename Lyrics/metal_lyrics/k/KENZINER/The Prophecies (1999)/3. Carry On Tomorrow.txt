Within my dreams I hide
One place where I decide
In my mystical state of mind
I see clear through the darkest night
I have visions of other times
Am I embracing the afterlife

Carry on - tomorrow will save me
Carry on - tomorrow awaits me

Now, it's clear, as I, escape what holds me here
I'm wandering, freefalling out beyond reality

Within my dreams I hide
One safe place to reside
What's the purpose of here and now
Really which way is up or down
My confusion it feeds my doubt
Is there silence with so much sound

Carry on - tomorrow will save me
Carry on - tomorrow awaits me

Within my dreams I hide
One place where I decide
In my mystical state of mind
I belong to another side
Crying out for another time
Who can say we really die

Carry on - tomorrow will save me
Carry on - tomorrow awaits me
Carry on - tomorrow awaits me
