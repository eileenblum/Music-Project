The spirits warned us, many years ago
Of a plague of white, but was not the snow
To lie and cheat and kill for our sacred land
We had no escape, from the great white man

Suffer the innocent, for so many years
We left our blood and souls
Along the trail (of tears)

We tried to resist the best way we knew how
We really had no chance, we all see that now
More and more they came, driven by their greed
We were all exiled, it was their final deed

The trail of tears, driven far from our home
The trail of tears, From where we all belong
On the trail of tears

The trail of tears, driven far from our home
The trail of tears, From where we all belong

Suffer the innocent, for so many years
We left our blood and souls
Along the trail (of tears)

The centuries have passed, since they did appear
On and on they go, we still all live in fear

The trail of tears, driven far from our home
The trail of tears, From where we all belong
The spirits warned us so many years ago
The trail of tears, silence is the warrior's song
The trail of tears, driven far from our home
