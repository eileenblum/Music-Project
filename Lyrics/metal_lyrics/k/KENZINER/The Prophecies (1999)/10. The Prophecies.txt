The time has gone
And dreams are lost in the past
As we make for the end
We find our lost destiny

Voices came from other dimensions, visions are quite clear
Day by day it gets a little stronger, as prophecies come true

For ever and ever, we seek relief from our pain
The final solution, finding the way
How much longer must we wait our time is wasting away

Take me to a different time
Where there is no pain
To another dimension
Where all visions came
Where all visions came
Where all visions came

We have labored, through the darkness
To behold a shimmer of hope
How much longer must we bear this
Burden of our sinking souls

Save our souls, break our chains
Lead us to freedom, confirm the belief
Take us back in time, to eternity

Will we, ever see, visions to behold
Will we, ever hear, we believe in the prophecies

Save me from this loneliness
Free the tortured souls
Save us from this insanity
Take us from this hell
When all seemed to be lost
Nothing could save us, no future no past
Darkness, despair was our life
No one would believe
Then, the visions came
All believed in the prophecies
In the prophecies
In the prophecies

We have labored through the darkness
To behold a shimmer of hope
How much longer must we wait
Our time is wasting away
Wait until this emptiness ends

After all the years
The prophecies all came true
It was the promised words we heard
We could not believe till now

How much longer must we wait
Our time is wasting away
Forever and ever, we seek relief from the pain
The final solutions, finding the way
We survived, the hell fires of darkness
And now eternity calls
Time is short, will we return
Only prophecies will tell

The time has gone
And dreams were lost in the past
As we come to the end
We found our lost destiny
We found our lost destiny
