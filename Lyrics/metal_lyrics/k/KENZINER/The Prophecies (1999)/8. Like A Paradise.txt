Even now I wonder why and where you have gone
The years pass oh so slowly, now where do you belong
We had the world, in the palm of our hands
We had it all, our own promised land

I stare far out, the window and up the road
I wait for word, that can't be again I know
When you left me and now that we are apart
Now that you're gone you took with you my heart

Like a paradise - When you came into my life
Like a paradise - When you said forevermore
Like a paradise - The time stood still it seemed
Like a paradise - As you loved me once before

I sit and count, all the times that we made love
I know it will never be, like that once again
You touched a place, that no one else can
You made me feel, no one understands
When you left me you took with you my heart
Like a paradise - When you came into my life
Like a paradise - When time stood still it seemed

Take me tonight to the place where you wait
Like paradise, that once was our fate

I visit time, when we were always one
My lonely soul, cries out for you
I wish it could, be you forever close
For life seems a waste, where love never bleeds
When you left me and now we're apart
Now that you're gone you took with you my heart

Like a paradise - When you came into my life
Like a paradise - When you said forevermore
Like a paradise - The time stood still it seemed
Like a paradise - As you loved me once before

We had the world, in the palm of our hands
We had it all, our own promised land

Like a paradise - When you came into my life
Like a paradise - When you said forevermore
Like a paradise - The time stood still it seemed
Like a paradise - As you loved me once before
