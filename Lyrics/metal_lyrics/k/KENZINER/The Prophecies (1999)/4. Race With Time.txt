I look in the mirror to see a face I do not know
I see inside the man, to his fears and beliefs
Once more to start again, I'd live another way
Take me from the sorrow and take me from grief

I sense the resolution - Race with time
To my own execution - Race with time
It's the final solution - Race with time
To end my revolution

Yesterday seems like a long lost friend
No need to worry so far from the end
Life wakes me up so painfully, all I see is misery
If I could do it over again, I'd live my life differently
Yesterday seems like my only friend
Tomorrow brings me closer to the end

Race with time, race with time
It's the final solution - Race with time
To end my revolution - Race with time

I sense the resolution - Race with time
To my own execution - Race with time
It's the final solution - Race with time
To end my revolution

Yesterday screams, to come back for more
The future awaits, with the answers in store
Hold me and tell me that all will be again
If not in this life, then on the other side
The road goes forward, where does it end
If it's not me, who will decide

Race with time
We're all racing - Race with time
I sense the resolution - Race with time
To end my revolution - Race with time
