Once again, we return
&gt;From whence we came, the hell fires burn
Through all these years, the torments the same
Through ageless lore, we've been here before

Time after time, we have foreseen
Vain attempts to mould our destiny
Lost in a dream, never awaken
Life is confused, we are forsaken

Captured souls, eternity
Beware behold, eternity
Over and over, we stay the course
Seeking the answers to evermore
We've come full circle again and again
The questions remain, it all looks the same

Time after time, we're back to the future
The prophets they sigh, no better the loser
Can't you read, the signs in the daunting sky
The dark runs from light
Now's the time to arise

Captured souls, eternity
Beware behold, eternity
Edge of time, eternity
Bridge of life, eternity

Over and over we stay the course
Seeking the answers to evermore
We've come full circle again and again
Through ageless lore, we've been here before

Time after time, we have foreseen
Vain attempts to mould our destiny
Lost in a dream, never awaken
Life is confused, we are forsaken

Captured souls, eternity
Beware behold, eternity
Edge of time, eternity
Bridge of life, eternity
