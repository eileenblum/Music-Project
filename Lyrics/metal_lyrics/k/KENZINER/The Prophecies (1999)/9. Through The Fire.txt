We march through the mud, to the field we're sure we'll die
As we look around, it's all we realize
To kill in war, the queen says it's so
No reason given, our rank does not know

The long bows, swords of valor

Well even now, we see the foe's long lines
We're outnumbered, by at least five times
The drums beat faster, as we run to the fight
Glory for all, who falls before the night

THROUGH THE FIRE! The battle rages on
THROUGH THE FIRE! For the queen far at home
THROUGH THE FIRE! The battle surges on
THROUGH THE FIRE! My comrades fall unknown

As the sun, sets slowly in the west
The field is red, we did our duty best
No one can leave, until all are killed
No one survived, from all the blood that spilled

The long bows, swords of valor

As we march through the mud, to the field we all will die
We all look above, and pray towards the sky
To die in war, the queen tells us so
For what reason, till death we did not know

THROUGH THE FIRE! The battle rages on
THROUGH THE FIRE! For the queen far at home
THROUGH THE FIRE! The battle surges on
THROUGH THE FIRE! My comrades fall unknown

The battle rages
Through the fire
The battle rages
Through the fire
