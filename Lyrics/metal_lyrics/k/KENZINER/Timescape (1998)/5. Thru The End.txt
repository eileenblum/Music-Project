[1]
I don't know where the time has gone 
I don't know why it's taken so long 
All I know, is you're still in my mind 
All I know, is you're not lost in time 
[2] 
Take me home before tomorrow 
Take me home where we once loved 
Call me now lost in sorrow 
Call me home before tomorrow 
[3] 
Hold me so tight, like the first time again 
Tell me within, it's now thru the end 
Touch me so real, as if time will begin 
Tell me within, it's now thru the end 
[4] 
Who can say where it all goes 
I don't know all the answers 
Who can tell where it travels 
All I know it's thru the end...thru the end 
[repeat 2] 
[repeat 3]
