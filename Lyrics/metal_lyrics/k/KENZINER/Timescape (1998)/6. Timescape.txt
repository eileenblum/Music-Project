[1]
I will follow, where the stream goes 
I've begged spirits, for solutions 
I have asked all said, times and illusion 
We were never meant to be 
[2] 
We've spent our lives, searching for ways 
Looking for clues, within the maze 
But fate it seems, to have it's demands 
To keep us apart, oh once again 
On and on and on it goes, where it stops we do not know 
Another face another life, through the fire and through the ice 
Oh through the Timescape,Oh through the Timescape 
I called your name it seems, through all eternity 
I have searched the ages through, it's hard to believe 
We never will be, We never will be? 
As I look across our lifetimes, I feel the casualities of the past 
As I look into the future we only have that forecast 
Oh through the Timescape,Oh through the Timescape 
[3] 
So one more time, we missed our crue 
So one more time, we've lost in the truth 
I kinow it's you and you know it's me 
For what we had, we'll never concede 
On and on and goes, where it stops we do not know 
Another face another life, through the fire and through the ice 
Oh through the Timescape,Oh through the Timescape 
I called your name it seems, through all eternity 
I have searched the ages through, it's hard to believe 
We will ever be, We will ever be? 
I will search the world over, for our answer of mercy 
I will call to the gods , to please just let us be 
Oh through the Timescape,Oh through the Timescape 
[repeat 1]
