We see the future signs... 
[1]
We've seen a thousand winters And we never felt the cold 
We've swam a thousand rivers Through our minds and our souls 
We've never known the answers We were really never told 
We've made the many journeys Maybe now we will know 
[2] 
It's all about us now We see the future signs 
It's really oh so clear We seen the future signs 
The road is before us We see the the future 
We shall be again We see the future signs 
[repeat 2] 
[3] 
We've only touched the surface Of what will really be 
10.000 years of practice To retrieve true harmony 
But now we've seen tomorrow Through the words of prophecy 
Our home is on the horizon It's time now to believe 

We see the future signs...
