[1]
I didn't believe in the power of love 
I've never seen love at the first sight 
I don't know how ypu ever found me 
I didn't know of this old misery 
I soon realized the connection was there 
Now I knew that this was despair 
[2] 
And we've been there before 
Through the seasons of strife 
[3] 
Visions of yesterday 
Mesmerized so far away 
Flashes of yesteryear 
The seasons soon disapear 
[4] 
I've seen...the seasons 
I've lived...the seasons 
[5] 
You are the keeper of my lost soul 
You have the way to make us whole 
I've called to ypu so many times 
I did not know where to try 
[repeat 2] 
Now I believe in the power of love 
Now I have seen love at the first sight 
[repeat 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5]
