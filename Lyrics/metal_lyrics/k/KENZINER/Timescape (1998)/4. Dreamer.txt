[1]
Dreams of what you said would be 
Dreams that died so uselessly 
Dreams that died, dreams that died, dreams that died...yesterday 
[2] 
How well I remember, the words you spoke 
Of how we'd be, forever more 
I've come to realize, the act you played 
A tragedy of heart, you set the stage 
[3] 
Everyday, I face the abandonment 
Leaving me with nothing but emptiness 
Why was I, sentenced to banishment 
Live or die, guilty or innocent 
[4]
All the nights, the cold lomely nights 
Wondering why, I'm still alive 
[5] 
Cries of the dreamer, dreams of how you said it would be 
Cries of the dreamer, mourning the loss of lost fantasy 
[6]
You never told me that, you never loved me 
Youi just kept me around to bleed 
You said you loved me but you never warned me 
You just kept me for your needs 
[repeat 3] 
[repeat 5] 
You never told me, you never loved me 
[repeat 5] 
[repeat 1]
