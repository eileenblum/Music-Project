[1]
In a ime long ago 
And a place no one knows 
It was such a different world 
A place of gold, diamonds and pearls 
[2] 
You were the queen 
Of a land no one's seen 
10.000 years 
A lifetime without tears 
[3] 
We ruled together all worldwide 
We ruled together with passion  and pride 
Our people's blood was never spilled 
To see our powers or lives fulfilled 
[4] 
Land of shadows, Land of shadows 
In the Land of shadows 
[repeat 1] 
[5] 
We shared the laughter 
We felt no pain 
We were the masters 
We shared the fame 
[repeat 2] 
[6]
All our people, they lived in peace 
All our peoples, both west and east 
The Gods showed favor, through our reign 
Until we returned, from whence a came 
[7]
Land of shadows, Land of shadows 
Dream world of shadows 
A kingdom of shadows 
Queen of shadows, King of shadows 
Land of shadows
