[1]
All we everwanted was life alone 
All we ever did was always known 
We searched throughout the world 
It was always the same 
The only way out was walking in the rain 
[2]
I never knew, what we were due 
At the first light of the day, we were always betrayed 
I know the writings on the wall 
I hear it screaming out our call 
[3] 
It's just another heartbreak 
It's just one more tragedy 
You always were my hero 
You're now immostalized 
[4] 
Even though the play is over 
And the curtains are drawn 
And though the crowd, left you alone 
The memories live on 
We all seem to know, you're not really gone 
[5]
Walking in the rain... 
Forever Walking in the rain... 
Timeless Walking in the rain... 
Forever Walking in the rain... 
[6] 
For know it's true, I'm without you 
Since that tragic day, we were both betrayed 
[7] 
Evem though the rain is over 
And the time moves on 
You're in the hearts of all 
Forevermore, so long 
I count the minutes of, our yesterdays alone 
I know it's true, I'm withouth you 
At the first light of day, we were always betrayed 
[repeat 5] 
All we ever wanted, was life alone 
Walking in the rain...
