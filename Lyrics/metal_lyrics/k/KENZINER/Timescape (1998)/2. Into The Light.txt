Step into the light... 
[1]
I hear the voice call from another day 
I close my eyes slow, is this her home? 
I reach my heart out for another sign 
The cabdles blow out, we're all alone 
I've counted all days, through all years 
!'ve always wondred why, you seemed so near 
[2] 
Step into the light...into the light 
Step into the light...look into 
[3] 
Look into my eye, look through my soul 
It's forever, soon you will know 
As you are today, so I once was 
As I am today, you will become 
[repeat 2] 
[4]
Am I dreaming, or am I awake 
Please don't leave me, no not again 
Well I shall follow, wherever you will go 
I know the answer to bring the end 
As you are today, I now will be 
As we go today, we shall be free 
[repeat 2]
