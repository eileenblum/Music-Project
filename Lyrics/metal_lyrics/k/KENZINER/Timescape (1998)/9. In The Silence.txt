[1]
We awake to the sights 
They're hard to ignore 
We see the angels home 
As we walk through the door 
It seems our minds are one 
We shall want no more 
[2] 
We've lived through another life 
We've missed the chance it's true 
[3] 
In the silence 
Where it all begins 
In the silence 
We say goodbye again 
[4] 
We must choose your fate 
As look into your eyes 
Another journey awaits 
This we must visualize 
[repeat 2] 
[repeat 3]
Maybe once again we'll be 
As we have so before 
It seems we are as one 
We shall need no more 
[repeat 2] 
In the silence...
