[1]
I call destiny, by the moon in the dark of the night 
I scream angerly, for a chance to plead your plight 
I cry remorsefully, to the stars within my sight 
I feel desperately, it wasn't fair nor was it right 
[2] 
Then the wind, the rain and the hail 
All came crashing down 
The balme, the pain and the shame 
All came around 
[3] 
Face to face with love...images 
Turn your back on above...images 
We walk hand in hand...images 
It's all teh masters plan...images 
Images of the past 
[4] 
We will never forget, my mind is clear 
Time goes ever so fast, images of the past 
[repeat 3] 
[repeat 2] 
We will never forget, my mind is clear 
[5] 
I couldn't endlessly, all ways to make us whole 
We hold eternity, in our hearts and in our souls 
I shake violently, with the thought that I've been told 
We stand gallantly, for the love that we still hold
