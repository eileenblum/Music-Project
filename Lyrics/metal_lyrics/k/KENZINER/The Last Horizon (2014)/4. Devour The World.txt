When I choose between my pleasure and the common good
Surely always I'm the winner
Delicious fruits of hard labor, by sweat and tears deserved
There's no way they'll take my dinner from me

Ragged stranger
Preach your danger but
Let me keep my crown

"You're a monster
Slave of passion
Devouring the world"
That's your opinion
Your sad reflection
Vain envy fuels your pride

Sky is burning
Mark the fall of endless night
Wheels are turning
And the winds of death blow over mankind
There's no heaven
Where sins will be undone
No one remembers
Our deeds when all is gone

"You're a monster
Slave of passion
Devouring the world"
That's your opinion
Your sad reflection
Vain envy fuels your pride

So you claim our world is dying, that we're running out of time
Oceans crying, I know your story
Sad but true, you little dreamer: time to open up your eyes
I will not give up my glory for free

Ragged stranger
Preach your danger but
Let me keep my crown

I'm a monster
Enslaved by passion
I devour the world
That's your opinion
My new reflection
Vain envy fuels my pride
