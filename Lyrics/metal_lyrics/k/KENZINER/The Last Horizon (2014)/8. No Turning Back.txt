It's the first day
When I'm in control of my life
Finally it's time
To leave the past far behind

No pain, no gain
The stakes are higher than ever
No need to believe
You'll know when you see me fly

Today I'm greeted by sunlight
The way goes where I choose
Chains (they) hold me no longer
Play the game by my own rules

Here I'm standing in the doorway
Glancing back I hear them calling
"Raving madness, he won't make it"
First step taken; now I'm on my way

There's no turning back
No more
No longer in chains
Never again
