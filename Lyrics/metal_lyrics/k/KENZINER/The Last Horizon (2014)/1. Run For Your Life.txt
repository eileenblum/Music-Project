Run, you better run there is no time to waste now
It's coming down on you
Strive, you gotta strive to keep the word you've given
To not appear the fool
Curse the day you signed the contract with your life's blood
It has become a tool
Used to gain control of your small ambitions
Greatest visions too

Do you feel that you still know what's living?
If you need to fly, why don't you try?
It's time to break free

Run, run for your life
You'll never win their race against the time
Fight, fight for your rights
Living for yourself can't be a crime
Run for your life

Game, the game is on and you know who is winning
They always change the rules
Flame, your flame is directed to do their bidding
The easy way to take
Break, you need to break the limitations of your mind
Put your life at stake
Build, you can build a better world if you want
You've got all the tools

Do you want to know what they call real living?
If you need to fly, why don't you try?
It's time to break free

Run, run for your life.
