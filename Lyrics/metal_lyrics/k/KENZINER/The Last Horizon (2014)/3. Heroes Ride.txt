Clouds approaching from the west, they are not hesitating
Heroes ride to spread the truth
Neutralizing all the followers of evil masters
They stand united; they're after you

Where can you hide now?
Life's tough for ones like you
Where are your friends now?
They are also hunting you

With righteous zeal they clean
Freedom is not your right
Towards a world serene
Just give up, put up no fight
You don't have what they need
Death for delusion

Brave heroes ride
Forge the sign of their times
Stay down and hide
Don't get caught in their crimes

Crowd is dancing in the streets; they have been liberated
From all and everything they knew
A new beginning not bound by the chains of long tradition
Who writes the rules; it's up to you

They offer you freedom
While a virgin's pouring wine
They've shattered your kingdom
Vultures circling in the sky

With righteous zeal they clean
Freedom is not your right
Towards a world serene
Just give up, put up no fight
You don't have what they need
Death for delusion

Brave heroes ride
Forge the sign of their times
Stay down and hide
Don't get caught in their crimes
