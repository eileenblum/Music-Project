Here I stand in the rain
Remembering all the times we shared
What is the reason for our open hostility?
We are so foolish, we don't even care

I pray on my knees, help me please
Let me find a way out of this maze

Keep the flame alive
Will you still keep me in the rain?
Cast out of heaven
Keep the flame alive
Won't you please let me in again?
Don't keep me locked outside forevermore

It's easy to keep the faith when life treats you well
But when all your dearest dreams get crucified
Will you stay true to yourself and your reason to live?
Will you still keep the flame alive?

And when you are teased you turn a blind eye
You need to be pleased, wish you could fly

Keep the flame alive
Will you still keep me in the rain?
Cast out of heaven
Keep the flame alive
Won't you please let me in again?
Don't keep me locked outside forevermore
