I am, I see, I feel, and I live
I hurt, I bleed, I cry and I survive
I will make this your essence, my child
I'll pour into you my heart tonight

Simplify, crystallize, sure I can make it
Sketch with this pattern, I do it all time
Amplify, visualize to better transmit
What I feel, what I mean with my fourth rhyme

You'll be circling the world by tomorrow
Making your and my name known
Common moments of joy and sorrow
Hearts of millions will be your home
Oh, you will bring us fame
And their knees will bend

I am eternal, last forever
Time will only make me greater
Memory won't fade away, never
Footprints will be followed later

You are, you hear, you feel and you dream
You hurt if you bleed while I dream about a life
My perfection is what you admire
It's my lack of fault that makes me cry

Prisoner of your work, there's no escaping
Flawless portrayal of what you lived through
Forever jealous of how you are shaping
Lives all around you with words untrue

I've been circling the world, bringing honor
Making your and my name known
Common moments of joy and sorrow
Hearts of millions have been my home
Yeah, I have brought us fame
I have made your name

I am eternal, last forever
Time will only make me greater
Memory won't fade away, never
Footprints will be followed later

I am I see, I feel
I hurt, I bleed, I live
My perfection's what you admire
You are, you hear, you feel
You dream, you hurt, you bleed
It's my lack of fault that makes me cry
Makes me cry
