Let's go!

You're what
I endeavor,
I love you forever but in this constant pain and suffering we lost our path, and went astray

I was told:
It could be worse but deep inside it really hurts
You said:
You would love me forever
Forever!

Hey nothing can change what you mean to me but nothing leaves me blind
Say: Nothing can change what you mean to me
Hey nothing can change what you mean to me, gotta leave it all behind
Say: Nothing can change what you mean to me

I fall apart, but you still make me smile, even though you're the reason
I die
You're the reason
I die!

I fall apart!
The problem is that
I still care
This isn't fair
This isn't fair

Hey nothing can change what you mean to me but nothing leaves me blind
Say: Nothing can change what you mean to me

I'm waiting for someone to tear down these walls, is anyone out there to answer my call?
Is anyone out there?

You said, you would love me forever
But how long, is forever?

I'm waiting for someone to tear down these walls
Is anyone out there to answer my call?
Can't you see the sadness within me?

I'm waiting for someone to tear down these walls
Is anyone out there to answer my call?
Can't you see the sadness within me?

Tear down these walls
To protect my heart
