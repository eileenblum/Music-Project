How many times have
I prayed to you?
How many times?
How many?

"The Creator" a name they gave you
One of many
So many
Why can't you just let me be?
Why have you blinded me to see?

Embrace or defy, my voice to the sky
Let it be heard my life, for your word

They say, we are your creation
Made from love, forged by your passion
So tell me is it all or nothing
I keep pushing and shoving

I'm moving on, without an aim
You want me to fight, so tell me how?
I'm moving on,
I'm not to blame
A king without a crown, won't hold me down
You want us to fight so tell me
How?!

I'm on my way, the sky covers your face
I talk to you, but you fade

Order, chaos, peace and war
Is this what we're fucking praying for?
Up and down, the pulse of life
So set me free
I wanna feel alive

I'm moving on, without an aim
You want me to fight, so tell me how
I'm moving on,
I'm not to blame
A king without a crown, won't hold me down
You want us to fight so tell me, how

I can't, wrap it in words
Please listen to my heart and let me tell you my story of joy, hate, love, anger and glory
Glory!

I'm on my way, the sky covers your face
I talk to you, but you fade
I'm on my way, the sky covers your face
I talk to you, but you fade
