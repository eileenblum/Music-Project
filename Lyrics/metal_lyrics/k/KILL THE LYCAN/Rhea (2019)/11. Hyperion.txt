How can
I pull it together, when
I'm falling apart?!

Losing myself in search of my redemption, but
I know, it's not the end of the line
Is this my way?
The path to go?
You reap what you sow

My body is numb
My mind lies in pieces
Worse than a million diseases
Why are we so indifferent?

Dead
Ended, declined, bound and confined
The tie has been broken, it's all in my mind
Is it all just me.
Is it all just me?

So tell me what do you stand for?
Why is it so hard to survive?

These voices echoing inside
Still
I'm forced to hide

It's the light that colors me, but it's the darkness tempting me
I don't know why,
I can't deny either way

So tell me what do you stand for?!

So stop your smothering
Find meaning in suffering

It's the light that colors me, but it's the darkness tempting me
I don't know why,
I can't deny either way

Branches in heaven,
Roots down in hell
So fragile, man
I've got stories to tell

There's a dream deep inside
Trying hard to survive
Hear the sound of the world falling deep in demise
Watch me burn, watch me crawl
In the dark there's still one call

We believe, in the heart and soul
We believe, can you hear their call
We believe
Far away from here
We believe
There's a place to go

Surrender to darkness
A vessel in the name of the light
Surrender to darkness
Every story has different sides
