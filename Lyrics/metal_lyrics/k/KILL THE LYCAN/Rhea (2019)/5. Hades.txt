I am a mess
I am broken
The silence prevails
So many words unspoken
Where is my will to fail?
Routines and patterns are my jail

I wanna know
What it is, that cuts right through your soul
I wanna know
What it is, that cuts right through your soul

This is the end of all the darkened moments
Can't you hear, that
I'm the one in torment?

So how can
I breathe
All these countless nights drowning in my grief
So how can
I say, that
I'm not strong enough to change my ways?

When tears run down your face
Can't keep moving on
I can't keep on losing
When tears run down your face
It's all about myself

You hear my lies
You see my broken soul
I'm out of control

And
I see you suffer
I'll change myself for the better
And
I see you suffer
Comfort's still stronger than the pain

When tears run down your face
Can't keep moving on
I can't keep on losing
When tears run down your face
It's all about myself

And
I'll keep fighting
And
I'll keep trying
No hope, no gain
My will is bound to fail
Your words, my deeds
Why do
I bite the hand that feeds?

I wanna know
What it is, that cuts right through your soul?
I wanna know
What it is, that cuts right through your soul?

I try,
I try, to change myself for the better
I try,
I try,
Comfort's still stronger than the pain

Please forgive me
For everything, for all, that
I've done
I'll change myself,
I'll change myself for the better
I promise
But please, please
Don't go
