This is a heart born in misery
This is the story of my motherfucking sanity
So hear me out, can't take me down, take me down
So listen closely, cause you won't feel better now
So listen closely, cause you won't feel better now
Days go by, my soul gets colder
So have a fucking heart and take it off my shoulder
Look into my bleeding eyes, see the woe, see the lies
So tell me, so tell me!
Take me back to the day where it all began
So hear me out, my tears ain't gonna save me now
Broken, torn and defiled
So hear me out, your pride ain't gonna break me now
Broken, torn and defiled
Broken, torn and defiled
Broken, torn and defiled
Broken, torn and defiled
Constantly oppressed, my life is a mess
