Face your deepest fear
Brace up, take a step towards it
And watch it disappear
Don't tell me, it was all a dream
Inside myself my soul still screams
Demons, angels,
I am in between
It's so hard to wake up when everything's so real
Everything's surreal
Still everything remains unseen

Tell me, am
I awake
Shake me awake
Before
I break
And
I've got so much to take
I've got so much to take

You're in my soul
You're chained to my nightmares
The hand on my heart
Drains me from the inside
Glad
I'm not alone
Our memories haunting me, until
I fall

Until
I fall

The worst enemy -is the memory -of you
The monsters don't wait under my bed
They sleep inside my head

Tell me, am
I awake
Shake me awake
Before
I break
And
I've got so much to take
I've got so much to take

Face your deepest fear, brace up, take a step towards it and watch it disappear
Face your deepest fear
Watch it disappear
