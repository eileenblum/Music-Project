This is our time to reflect
This is our time to rebuild what's left

All the scars
We left in this world
Leaving me blind
Purpose declined

So
Is this a scene right out of a dream
Respect all beings
I won't give in

So who do you want to be, in the face of this tragedy?

So tell me, is it right or wrong
To stand up
To speak up
Just stand up

So tell me is it wrong or right
They can't stop our will to fight

Want you all to see
What we all could be
Face the truth to set us free

Want you all to see
What we all could be
Take the chance to change our legacy

This is our time to shine
So face me
Disgrace me

Throw me in the dirt of your shame
So face me
Disgrace me

This is our time to reflect
This is our time to connect

Our vessel, our life
Our mother, our world
The truth must be heard

So is this a risk, that you're going to take?
Our vessel is broken

So is this a risk, that you're willing to hold?
This is the truth to be told

Want you all to see
What we all could be
Face the truth to set us free

Want you all to see
What we all could be
Take the chance to change our legacy

This is our time to shine
So face me
Disgrace me

Throw me in the dirt of your shame
So face me
Disgrace me
