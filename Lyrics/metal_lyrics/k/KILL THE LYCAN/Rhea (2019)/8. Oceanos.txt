Every drop
I give away
Every wave
I can't control
Give me all, give me everything

Every life you end today
Deep down the heart of the sea
We take it all, we take everything for granted

Here
I stand,
Got nothing left
Nothing in my hands
What
I do is all
I am

See them fight, see them die,
All the suffering denied,
Take a stand and see that nature's divine

Watch us burn as worlds collide

Now we, we are the fire
We are the light inside ourselves
Now we, we are the fire
We are the light inside ourselves

We break these chains

We're part of this game
Now is the time
Let's go

What will your children say?
What could the say?
Tell me, tell me now

What could they say
If they find out you did nothing

The sea is a teacher
Unbound and free (so unbound and free)
Is anyone out there?
Left alone in my mind, left alone in my life

So many lives won't see the break of dawn
So many lives you see them holding on
So many lives, washed away

Now we, we are the fire
We are the light inside ourselves
Now we, we are the fire
We are the light inside ourselves
We break these chains

This is our life
Our sacrifice
