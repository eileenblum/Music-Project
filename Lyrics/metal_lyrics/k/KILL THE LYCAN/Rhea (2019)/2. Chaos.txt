A life astray it's time to throw it away

Constantly searching for meaning
Salvation's at hand
A life so misleading

Is this the price that we pay?
Is it the truth we're alone?

Confusion and mayhem
We crawl 'til we're dead
We're fighting ourselves hanging by a thread

This is the price that we pay
It is the truth
It is the truth we're alone

It is the truth we're alone
This is the price to be paid

The times I'm left alone
Bring guidance to the answer
A guidance to trust myself
I need to trust in me

Give me trust to fight
Give me love to care
There is no wall to guide me
The world and me collide
I just stop and stare
Embrace the void or getting destroyed

This nothingness feels wrong to me
So who am I?
Who am I?
If there's no reason to be

A fight to win
A war to lose
The stage has been set
It's our burden to choose

This is the price that we pay
Is it the truth we're alone?

We drown ourselves in never-ending thoughts
Day by day, a train that never stops

This is the price that we pay
Carved in stone
It is the truth we're alone

Give me trust to fight
Give me love to care
There is no wall to guide me
The world and me collide
I just stop and stare
Embrace the void or getting destroyed

Fall down, fall down
Resist, you and
I we never cease to exist

Stand up, stand up
Reach higher
The hardest steel goes through the hottest fire

Born in the darkness
Raised by the storm
Shattered to pieces
Reborn

Born in the darkness
Raised by the storm
Shattered to pieces
Reborn
