This is my time, this is my life
What
I do?
Leaving you to survive

Leaving you to survive

When all hope is gone, and every will is lost
Regain control
At any cost

I treated you the way, you treated me
That's why hate me

And the man that
I've become
Is more than
I can take
I'm lost and so alone
I don't believe that
I'm okay
I don't believe that
I'm alright
But
I'm alright(
But
I'm alright)

I am what
I am for all to see
For all to see
Not a bad person nor your enemy

Don't push me down

Comfort in silence, lost in a maze
Your redemption is pushed to the grave

Only silence
Your redemption is pushed to the grave
Don't push me down

I don't believe that
I'm OK
I don't believe that
I'm alright
But
I'm alright

I am what
I am for all to see
For all to see
Not a bad person, nor your enemy

Push me down

My anger turns to tears
The breaking point for my fears
All these energies leaving my heart
Letting go of what, keeps us apart

Your heart is so empty
Full of resistance
Time to make a difference

Your heart is so empty
This is my time, this is my life
What
I do?
Leaving you to survive
