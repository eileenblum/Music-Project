[originally by Bachman-Turner Overdrive]Goodbye, I lied
Don't cry, would you let it ride
Goodbye, I lied
Don't cry, would you let it ride

You can't see the mornin', but I can see the light
(Try, try, try to let it ride)
While you've been out runnin', I've been waitin' half the night
(Try, try, try to let it ride)

And would you cry if I told you that I lied
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride
And would you cry if I told you that I lied
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride

Seems my life is not complete, I've never see you smile
(Try, try, try to let it ride)
Baby, you want the forgivin' kind and that's just not my style
(Try, try, try to let it ride)

And would you cry if I told you that I lied
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride
And would you cry if I told you that I lied
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride

I've been doin' things worthwhile, you've been bookin' time
(Try, try, try to let it ride)

And would you cry if I told you that I lied
And would you say goodbye, would you let it ride
And would you cry if I told you that I lied
And would you say goodbye, would you let it ride

Would you let it ride
Would you let it ride
Would you let it ride (yeah, yeah)
Would you let it ride

Try, try, try to let it ride
Try, try, try to let it ride
Try, try, try to let it ride
Try, try, try to let it ride
Try, try, try to let it ride
Try, try, try to let it ride
Try, try, try to let it ride
Try, try, try to let it ride
Try, try, try to let it ride

Would you let it ride
Would you let it ride
Would you let it ride
Would you let it ride
