Merciless winter with spears of frozen rain
Crystals of mourning for those to come and those who've came
Slipping through whirlwinds of vision quests of loss
They're all but orphans of the peace within the frost

Merciless winter
Taking the givers
Knees at the foot of the willow
Under one thousand eyes that shine for every soul
Kneeling at the foot of the willow
Leaves of fallen ones
Vowed forever weeping

Oh arctic sapphire with painted shields of rust
Solstice of life's warriors in gales of diamond dust
Heart of horizon, veins of crystal gloss
They're still but orphans of the peace within the frost

Merciless winter
Why do you linger?
Kneel at the foot of the willow
Under one thousand eyes that shine for every soul
Kneeling at the foot of the willow
Leaves of fallen ones
Vowed forever weeping

Leaves! Of! Virtue!
Leaves! Of! Virtue!

Holy leaves of fallen angels
Vowed eternal
Weeping willow

Kneel at the riot of the willow
Under one thousand eyes that shine for every soul
Kneeling at the foot of the willow
Leaves of fallen ones
Vowed forever weeping
