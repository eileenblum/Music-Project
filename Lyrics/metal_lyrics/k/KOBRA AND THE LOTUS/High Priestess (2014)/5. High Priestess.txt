I seek enlightenment on lotus black and white
Tell me of my destiny while I am still alive
Oh goddess of the dead, what's carved upon your stone?
Of existence and denial, in a veil of the unknown

All seeking rider
Your journey now begins
High priestess
Show me what you see
High priestess
Who I am and what I'll be
High priestess
Secrets that you hide
High priestess
Come to me

High priestess is the justice
High priestess is the knife
That leaves the wicked bleeding
Yet she has spared my life
What's behind your curtain
Saviour of the damned
Reveal to me this ecstacy
I honour your command

All seeking rider
Your journey's reached the end
High priestess
Show me what you see
High priestess
Who I am and what I'll be
High priestess
Secrets that you hide
High priestess
Come to me

She brings the sun
When the black moon rises
As I hear her call
Fills me with light
And the will to guide us
As I take her throne

Come to me
Come to me

High priestess
You will worship me
High priestess
I was always meant to be
High priestess
Secrets are all mine
High priestess
Bow to me
