Hello! My friend! I can't wait to see you again
I've counted the seconds, and minutes, hours
Wondering if you're thinking the same

And the moment comes
As the seasons change
And nobody knows
What are we waiting for?!

Hold on my love
Hold on before it's taken away
So long my love
So long to these pale blue days

So close, I can feel it, can you taste it?
I'm here, there, everywhere the light fills your holes
I breath just to know you're alive

And the moment comes
As the seasons change
Still nobody knows
What are we waiting for?!

Hold on my love
Hold on before it's taken away
So long my love
So long to these pale blue days

Hold on my love
Hold on before it's taken away
So long my love
So long to these pale blue days

Take me back so I may crawl into your heart deep within
Take me back to your home where our life can begin
Take me back to where these pale days are no longer blue
I've hidden your word so I never may sin against you
I never may sin against you

What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?

Hold on my love
Hold on before it's taken away
So long my love
So long to these pale blue days

Hold on my love
Hold on before it's taken away
So long my love
So long to these pale blue days
