Shoulder to shoulder stand upon this tortured ground
Breathing the cold, withered ashes with borrowed breath
My human will is bound to broken souls I've found
Pain of despair only relents to death

Oh I will find a way
To live another day

Whoa
Pray for the sunrise
Battle of souls burn in the sky
Whoa
Angel of mercy
Breathe in the gloom that clouds my eyes

The steel may pierce my arm, the battle rages on
Through my veins rushes insidious conflict
If I survive my fate an emptiness awaits
Leading me hollow and tempted by death

Oh I will find a way
To live another day

Whoa
Pray for the sunrise
Battle of souls burn in the sky
Whoa
Angel of mercy
Breathe in the gloom that clouds my eyes

Shoulder to shoulder stand upon this tortured ground
My human will is bound to broken souls I've found

Marching! Your feet are marching
You fall!
Marching! Your feet are marching
You fall!
Marching! Your feet are marching
You fall!
Marching! Your feet are marching
You fall!

I feel it
It's coming
I'm in the final hour!

Oh I will find a way!
To live another day!

Whoa
Pray for the sunrise
Battle of souls burn in the sky
Whoa
Angel of mercy
Breathe in the gloom that clouds my eyes

Whoa
Pray for the sunrise
Whoa
Angel of mercy
Whoa
