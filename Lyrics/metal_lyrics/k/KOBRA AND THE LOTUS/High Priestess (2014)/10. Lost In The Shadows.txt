I've been searching for answers in the river of my soul
Aimlessly seeking the holy who will take me from this cold

Timeless night
I am lost and have no where to go
Bring me sight
So I may find my home

As I kneel my heart in the field of frozen memories
Looking up I am asking to stop the ground crumbling from my feet

Timeless night
I am lost and have no where to go
Bring me sight
So I may find my home

Shine for me now sweet cosmic eyes
I am singing to you from the shadows
I feel lost in this dark without your light
Oh cosmic eyes! Sing to me from the skies!
And guide my way!
Guide my way

Gone with my sweet surrender
Shining bright, all knowing eyes
I'll find my way back home!

Shine for me now sweet cosmic eyes
I am singing to you from the shadows
I feel lost in this dark without your light
Oh cosmic eyes! Sing to me from the skies!
And guide my way!

Whoa!!
I am lost in the shadows, guide my way
