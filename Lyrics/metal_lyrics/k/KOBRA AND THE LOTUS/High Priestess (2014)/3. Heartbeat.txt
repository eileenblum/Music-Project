One night I heard the forest calling out my name
Whispers of stolen magic from the darkness came
Walking in the rain
Sacred grains of dust
Through the moonlit valley
Warm winds I trust

I hear the calling of a heartbeat
Aching from what we have done to this earth
Silence a symphony of beauty
Taking its life, sacrificed for rebirth

Carelessly light the match and watch the future burn
And now I see we've made a path of no return
Songs of ancient words
Chanting from the earth
Echoes to remind me
Where I came from

I hear the calling of a heartbeat
Aching from what we have done to this earth
Silence a symphony of beauty
Taking its life, sacrificed for rebirth

I hear the calling of a heartbeat
Aching from what we have done to this earth
Silence a symphony of beauty
Taking its life, sacrificed for rebirth

I hear the calling of a heartbeat
What have we done to this earth?
Silence, a symphony of beauty
Life sacrificed for rebirth
