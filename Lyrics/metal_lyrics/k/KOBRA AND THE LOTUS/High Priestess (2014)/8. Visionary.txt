Commence the kingdom in the valley where she lay
Dreaming an arising prophet, the blessed they would say
Sacred the mountain where they bathed her in perfume
Fair was the body, placed the lotus in her womb

I will reach the highest heaven
This is my last birth
Cross the ocean of existence
Foremost of the world

Jealous of his meditation
Seduction claimed by death
Witnessing his worthiness, he pointed down
Earth shook its head
Shook its head!

I will reach the highest heaven
This is my last birth
Cross the ocean of existence
Foremost of the world

Mother! Can you see her pure intention?
Visionary of the world
Mother! Can you see her pure intention?
Visionary, to dare this child of the earth
Child of the earth!

I will reach the highest heaven
This is my last birth
Cross the ocean of existence
Foremost of the world

Child of the earth
