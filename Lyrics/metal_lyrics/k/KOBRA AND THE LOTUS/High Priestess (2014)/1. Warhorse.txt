Trampling creation, a vision destroyed
Eternal dissident noise
Crippling the earth as it falls in his void
Fearing the hate in his eyes

Show no mercy, leave no pride
Life of ruin, leave them blind
Dark lord, he will betray
Discord, infecting with decay

Here comes the war horse
Built to destroy you
Here comes the war horse
Burn in hell!
Here comes the war horse
We will destroy you
Here comes the war horse
Burn in hell!

Galloping malice, a thunder of fear
Brought by a steed of demise
Capturing, torturing, sucking them in
With gifts of corruption and lies

Show no mercy, hear them cry
As they suffer, they will die
Dark lord, he will betray
Melkor, infecting with decay

Here comes the war horse
Built to destroy you
Here comes the war horse
Burn in hell!
Here comes the war horse
We will destroy you
Here comes the war horse
Burn in hell!

Where do we go from here?
War horse is getting near
How do we get away?
This is the end of days

Where do we go from here?
War horse is getting near
How do we get away?
War horse has come to slay!

War horse!
War horse! War horse! War horse! War horse!

Here comes the war horse
Built to destroy you
Here comes the war horse
Burn in hell!
Here comes the war horse
We will destroy you
Here comes the war horse
Burn in hell!
