Come a little closer, let me tell you who I am
Iâm the bleeding bullet hole infecting all the land
Killing off humanity, a craving mouth for war
Burning skies I leave behind for generations more

I am devastation
I am retribution
I am delivering hell
You tell me why

I am, I am all thatâs inside you
I am, I am evil burning through
I am, I am the seed of your destruction
Self fulfilling prophecy

Look into the glass and tell me what do you see
Is is your reflection or the devil running free
You spread temptation with your pestilence greed
Self-afflicting genocide and endless misery

I am devolution
I am execution
I am condemning us all
You tell me why

I am, I am all thatâs inside you
I am, I am evil burning through
I am, I am the seed of your destruction
Self fulfilling prophecy

I am the plague of suffering
I am the bane
You are the same

I am, I am all thatâs inside you
I am, I am evil burning through
I am, I am the seed of your destruction
Self fulfilling prophecy

I am, I am
I am, I am
I am, I am
Self fulfilling prophecy!
