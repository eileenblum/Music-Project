Fear, fear in his eyes
Knowing the end has come
And there's no where to run

Flashing before him
A lifetime in seconds
His brothers lay dead on the ground

Holding his destiny inside my hands
With my gun I am crushing his dreams
And I see blood

In my eyes (in my eyes!)
I will die a benevolent soldier
Take my life oh this gift of mine
In my eyes (in my eyes!)
I will fall a benevolent soldier
My demise behind enemy lines

I, I walk away
Is there a consequence
For this decision I've made?

Feeling a sting in my back
I fall questioning
What my compassion has done

I put my destiny inside his hands
It's kill or be killed with my honour
And I see blood

In my eyes (in my eyes!)
I will die a benevolent soldier
Take my life oh this gift of mine
In my eyes (in my eyes!)
I will fall a benevolent soldier
My demise behind enemy lines
Whoaaaa

In my eyes (in my eyes!)
I died a benevolent soldier
Take my life oh this gift of mine
In my eyes (in my eyes!)
I fell a benevolent soldier
My demise behind enemy lines
Take my life!
