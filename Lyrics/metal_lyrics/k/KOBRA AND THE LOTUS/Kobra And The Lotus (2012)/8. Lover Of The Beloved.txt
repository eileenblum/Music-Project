Through all her history the picture had been perfect
Escaping all affection she evaded proof
I've fallen into your sky
Do not come looking
I will never return until you are mine

Lover of the beloved
My sacrament is you

Began compassion
Dawned a richer view
She saw the divine inside him that lit her blackened room
Only in reverence she kneeled to his feet
To testify her worthiness, her unconditional deed

Look at her as she falls endlessly
Staring into his eyes
She won't give up this time

Lover of the beloved
My sacrament is you
Lover of the beloved
Patiently she's waiting for you
For you

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Lover of the beloved
My sacrament is you
Lover of the beloved
Patiently she's waiting for you
