That night the earth stood still screaming in silence
Flailing in a ravenous will, born beyond possession

Infernal fire
It's killing you
It's killing me
You dug a grave and I'm still digging

Yeah
Welcome to my funeral
Yeah
I hope that you've had fun
This monster I've become

We are the tarnished chains
All our inner entities are tragically enslaved
I see right through you! We're almost made the same
Cleverly placed beside you, designed for your decay

Infernal fire
It's killing you
It's killing me
You dug a grave
I'm still digging

Mirror of imperfection
I tear it down, I tear it down!

I hope, I pray, to find illumination in my way
My soul, I keep
Release these lifeless chains and set me free

Yeah
Welcome to my funeral
Yeah
It's killing you, it's killing me
You dug a grave, I'm still digging!

Yeah
Welcome to my funeral
Yeah
This monster
This monster I've become
