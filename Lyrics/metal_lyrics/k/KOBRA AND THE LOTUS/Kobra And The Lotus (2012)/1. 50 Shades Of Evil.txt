Oh you've seen this all before
Never feeling satisfied
And always wanting more

Slipping into your system
Opening up the gate
Flooding real with lust
Until it is too late

Whoa, the advocate of hell
50 shades of evil
Only the devil could wear well

Behold the river of desire
Carelessly you're bashing down on heads to get you higher
You will die!
As empty as you started
You'll never have enough
Your greed cannot be mended

Whoa, the advocate of hell
50 shades of evil
Only the devil could wear well

You have become
Whoa
50 shades of evil! 50 shades of evil!
Advocate of hell! Advocate of hell!
Only the devil could wear it well!
