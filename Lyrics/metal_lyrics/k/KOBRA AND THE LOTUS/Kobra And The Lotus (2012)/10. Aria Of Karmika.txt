One life has gifted you a path 
with an unwritten face
Two hands have given you the chance to build a
better place

As pure as the moonlight
Knowledge floods the pain
Darkness fades away

Aria of Karmika
Aria of Karmika

One mind to learn from actions past
Two feet to walk a righteous path

As pure as the moonlight
Knowledge floods the pain
Darkness fades away

Aria of Karmika
Aria of Karmika

One life

I see the cruel intention 
blinding us as fear prevails
on and on
Returning for redemption 
bearing seeds of sorrows
'til we're gone

Aria of Karmika
Aria fades away
