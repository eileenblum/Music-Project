All alone in this world unfolding
All alone in this world I long to stay
All alone in this world surrounding
Trusting no one, I will always be alone

Whoa in my sanctuary
Whoa lonely sanctuary

This restless place surrounds my shoulders
Eternal faces in an empty room

Truth or die
How do I get inside?
Am I sane? I struggle to decide

Whoa lonely sanctuary
Whoa lonely sanctuary

I had a dream this feeling ripped my heart
Couldn't breathe as I drowned into the earth

Truth or die
How do I get inside?
Am I sane? I struggle to decide

Whoa lonely sanctuary
Whoa lonely sanctuary
Whoa lonely sanctuary
Whoa lonely sanctuary

Intoxicating essence of fabricated tale
I barely hold myself back in fear that I may fail

This is my life, lone soul
I'm so alive, hollow
Lonely Sanctuary
Lonely Sanctuary
