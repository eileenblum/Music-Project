I asked myself why this is happening
Behind my wall I can't reply
I taste the colours and start panicking
Scared to believe that I may shine

Can't see past the carnage I have created in my mind
Forever forgetting to myself I must be kind

Nayana, no one will ever see through my eyes
Nayana, you have yours, these eyes are mine

One hundred years inside a garden
Thinking the flowers had no scent
Smashing the water for its honesty
Boundlessly swimming in repent

Can't see past the carnage I have created in my mind
Forever forgetting to myself I must be kind

Nayana, no one will ever see through my eyes
Nayana, you have yours, these eyes are mine

Nayana, Nayana, Nayana, Nayana

Can't see past the carnage I have created in my mind
Forever forgetting to myself I must be kind

Nayana, no one will ever see through my eyes
Nayana, you have yours, these eyes are mine!
