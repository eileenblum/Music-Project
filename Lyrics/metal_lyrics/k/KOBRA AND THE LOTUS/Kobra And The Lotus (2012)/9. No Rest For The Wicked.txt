There will be no rest for the wicked

Misery is what she feels inside this never ending hole
Wonders if he'll be back again
He's left before and he'll do it again

Every morning the sun forgets to rise
Sacrificing the loyalty
Shattering the spine

Another familiar story in a more familiar place
Kissing their kids goodnight
They struggle without a trace
Is this the life they're leading? A fake distorted lie?
Until it hits inside that nothing good lasts forever

Strung high on delusion
Integrity is falling down
Betrayal's the voice of it all
Reflect as they suffer

Every morning the sun forgets to rise
Sacrificing the loyalty
Shattering the spine

Another familiar story in a more familiar place
Kissing their kids goodnight
They struggle without a trace
This is the life they're leading, a fake distorted lie
Until it hits inside that nothing good lasts forever

No rest for the wicked!

Come a little closer, let me show you where they hide
Ruining their disguise
Stabbing is a wicked game to play, exposing all the signs
Now wake up to the reality that nothing good lasts
forever!

Another familiar story in a more familiar place
Kissing their kids goodnight
They struggle without a trace
Is this the life they're leading? A fake distorted lie?
Until it hits inside that nothing good lasts forever

There will be no rest for the wicked
I said nothing good lasts forever
There will be no rest for the wicked
