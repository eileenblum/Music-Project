Twisting and turning
I can't stop this feeling
It grows in me everyday

Started so clear
No revenge in my air
Now I slay all not my kind

Oh my life coming undone

Damage of the ages
I wasn't a part of but chose to defend

I have no remorse
I'm born with no pity
But now I feel something is wrong

Oh my life coming undone
Oh my life what have I done?
What have I done?

You trained me to believe the gun in hand's the enemy
Brainwashed by words you've said
I've justified this sea of red
I'm fighting for your past but why did all the anger last?
Now open eyes I see the killer always has been me

I am the weapon of mass destruction
With open eyes I see the killer always has been me
Always has been me and I see it in you too

Go!

It's my life
(My! Life!)

It's my life
(My! Life!)

It's my life
(My! Life!)

My life!
(My! Life!)
