Crowning the Kobra and turning the page
This is deliverance day
Kneeling before us defending the faith
We are the keeper of strength

Rise up
Breaking the Silence
Rise up
Unleashing the pain

Bearing the burden for liberty rising
The coming of age

We are forever one

Bring me the masters of reality
Courage that enemies fear
Merciless soldiers, we're paving the way
Giving our blood, sweat and tears

Rise up
Bringer of justice
Rise up
Slayer of fame

Crushing the ego
Destroying the self
We are but one and the same

We are Forever One

Can you all feel it now?
Our future is growing
A universal voice
We'll be forever one
Forever one
