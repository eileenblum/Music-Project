Hey! Dark addiction! You cannot take my life!
I won't give in to this decay, I will not die!

Bittersweet
Vindication of my fight
So so bittersweet
Return my existence
This is the way

I awaken catching my fall taken from grace
With Heaven's Veins
I am breaking this feverish way
With Heaven's Veins
Heaven's Veins

Why? You've forsaken! Left me cold and dead inside
You! Were deceiving, making me self-victimize

Bittersweet
Vindication of my fight
So so bittersweet
Return my existence
This is the way

I awaken catching my fall taken from grace
With Heaven's Veins
I am breaking this feverish way
With Heaven's Veins
Heaven's Veins

Vengeance you'll leave me now
Vengeance you'll leave me now
Vengeance you'll leave me now
Vengeance you'll leave me now!

I awaken catching my fall taken tram grace
With Heaven's Veins
I am breaking this feverish way
With Heaven's Veins
Heaven's Veins
Heaven's Veins
Heaven's Veins
Catching my fall from grace
Heaven's Veins
Awaken Heaven's Veins
Heaven's Veins
Awaken me!
