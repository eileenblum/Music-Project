Tormented endlessly, an internal purgatory
I am tortured by the thorns of my will
Violently grating the layers off any inhibitions
My deepest secrets are exposed (reveal yourself)

I'm vulnerable, bleeding uncontrollably
Inconsolable, drowning in the pain

Hey! Can you hear me? Can you hear me calling?
I'm locked behind these walls and can't get out
Anybody, if you hear me, can you help me?
I am trapped inside this mortal prison cell

Scraping the mortar with my blood encrusted nails
My demons lacerate the virtue in my head
Slowly unhinging I am rocking with insanity
I'm fading farther into darkness
I am dancing with the dead

They're maleficent (maleficent)
So treacherous (treacherous)
Can anybody hear me? Anybody?!

Hey! Can you hear me? Can you hear me calling?
I'm locked behind these walls and can't get out
Anybody, if you hear me, can you help me?
I am trapped inside this mortal prison cell

Hey! Can you hear me? Can you hear me calling?
I'm locked behind these walls and can't get out
Anybody, if you hear me, can you help me?
I am trapped inside this mortal prison cell

Whoaaa
