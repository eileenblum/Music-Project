New found awareness
I finally think I've walked down the right road
Breath in the fullness of running with the choice to let it go
Let it go, let it go

I am alive! Manifesting destiny
Are you alive?! Manifest your destiny

I am a child swimming in an ocean of possiblity
(Become the love you seek)
Learning the lessons of how hard it is to love unconditionally
We can change how we see

I am alive! Manifesting destiny
Are you alive?! Manifest your destiny

Happiness, happiness, could you imagine that?
True happiness, happiness, wouldn't you want that?

Open, open your hands if you want to be held
See the sky will catch you
If you fall thru every moment with a curious mind
Be silent

Manifest! Manifest! Your destiny
Manifest! Manifest! Your destiny
Manifest! Manifest! Your destiny
Manifest! Manifest! Your destiny

Are you alive?! I am alive!
Are you alive?! I am alive!
Are you alive?! Are you alive??
We are alive!! We are alive!!
