I don't get it, the way you're wearing your pride arond your knees
You're always finding another reason to trigger and release
And blame
Blame anybody but yourself for your mistakes
Why won't you awaken, awaken!
Open up your eyes and see that

Life! is all you get!
And there's no coming back
Why would you live it like it's a renegade?
Throwing it all away

You're a reject (total misfit)
Feel like a defect but you're no different from anyone else
There's no place here for all your anger
Stop feeling sorry for yourself

Don't blame
Don't blame this good good life for throwing shit in your face
Why won't you awaken, awaken!
Open up your eyes and see that

Life! is all you get!
And there's no coming back
Why would you live it like it's a renegade?
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away

Life! is all you get!
And there's no coming back
Why would you live it like it's a renegade?
Your life is all you get!
There are no second chances
So, why would you live it like it's a renegade?
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
You're throwing it all away
