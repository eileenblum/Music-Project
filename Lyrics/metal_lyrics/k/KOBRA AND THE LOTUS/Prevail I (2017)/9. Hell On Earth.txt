Trapped in a prison of sickness and pain
Watching the world go by
Sitting in torment, I hear people calling but I can't reply

I'm locked out by my misery, scraping my knees on eternity

Whoa, this is hell on earth
Whoa, I found the devil
The devil's inside me

Oh how I love the taste of my own blood

I am an addict to all my excuses
Belive me I'll find a new vein
Don't try to help me
I won't take it kindly
I'm confortable in my decay

I shut out possibility
I won't admit it, that would make me weak

Whoa, this is hell on earth
Whoa, I found the devil
The devil's inside me

Whoa, this is hell on earth
Whoa, I've let in the devil
For the devil will never blame me
Ha!!

Sympathy, empathy, give it all to me!
Am I sick? Is this a trick?
A devil inside me

Did you think it was going to be that easy?
I'm addicted to my disease
You can't help me!

Whoa, this is hell on earth
Whoa, I found the devil
The devil's inside me

Whoa, this is hell on earth
Whoa, my own hell
My hell on earth

Hell, hell on earth
Hell, hell on earth
Hell, hell on earth
Hell, hell on earth
Hell, hell on earth
Hell, hell on earth
Hell, hell on earth
