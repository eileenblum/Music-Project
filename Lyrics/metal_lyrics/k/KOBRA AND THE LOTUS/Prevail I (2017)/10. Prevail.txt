Gather around all my brothers and sisters
For today is the day we change everything
We've travelled so far in this journey of existence
Don't you think it's time we had a little peace?

This is for all the non-believers
The ones who said we'd never make it out
This is for all the adversaries in our heads
That filled our minds with failure and self-doubt

Hear our war cry!

We will prevail
And we're never backing down
With the flame of courage in our eyes
Magnificence!
We will prevail!

So tell me, won't you tell me all the ways you were denied
I assure you everyone here's been there too
Don't forget we are all lions born of strength and fortitude
So get up, lets fight the battle of our lives!!

This is for all the non-believers
The ones who said we'd never make it out (I'll make it out!)
This is for all the adversaries in our heads
That filled our minds with failure and self-doubt

Hear our war cry!

We will prevail
And we're never backing down
With the flame of courage in our eyes
Magnificence! Magnificence!
We will prevail!
And we're never backing down
With the strength and courage, we survive!
Fight for your lives!
We will prevail!

Whoa

Hear our war cry!

We will prevail
And we're never backing down
With the strength and courage, we survive!
Fight for your lives!
We will prevail!
We will prevail!
We will prevail!
We will prevail!
