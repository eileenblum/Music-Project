Pretend the fire will never touch you.
We're coming back stronger than before.
Please hold the gate.
Because we're coming home soon.
Don't abandon me in this, our finest hour.
We're coming back stronger.
Don't abandon me in my finest hour.
I'm coming back stronger.
I won't fall back so you'd better watch your head.
