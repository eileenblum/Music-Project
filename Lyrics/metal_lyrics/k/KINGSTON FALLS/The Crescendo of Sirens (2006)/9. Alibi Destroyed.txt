To send our own world would be suicidal.
You're not royalty, so you can wait.
If this was lead by another then there'd be no fault.
Mislead funds opened the floodgate.
Blame the poor, the drained us anyway.
(He we are, we're coming back for more.
We've said this once before.
Let us run away from here).
Here we are, we're coming back for more.
An open handed push to the concrete.
(Let the waters drown our fathers).
Seems to be a fine solution.
