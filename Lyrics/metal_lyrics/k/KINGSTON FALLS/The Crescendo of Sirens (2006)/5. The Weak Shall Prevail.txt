The enemy has broken through.
And seized the gate.
We've held them off this long.
We won't do down without a fight.
Show no mercy.
For you shall receive none.
And if my comrades should fall.
I will stand my ground.
(And if my comrades should fall, we'll be right there to catch you.
Not one can touch this for us.
Between this band of honor, between what makes us stronger.
That's why we do this.)
I fear neither pain nor death.
