Tough Love; a despair traced in passion.
This is the end of all games.
Dear (your name here).
I won the wager.
I'll be back to collect.
End statement: Tough luck.
Ripped out, silence on.
No one makes me bleed my own blood.
Ready your rifles.
It's all downhill from here.
We've flown past fail safe.
The red button won't save us now.
We are the most desperate beings alive.
All will end in carnage.
Yours truly, Never.
