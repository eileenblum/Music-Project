The plague has found our dwelling.
A sober institution.
It's at our houses.
Living, feeding on the helpless.
A false try from behind a razor blade smile.
We hold the children in our hands and guide them.
There are no innocent victims.
My only light need be the light of experience.
This is the massacre of tranquility.
