This puddle of cowardice, rear back on the harness.
So salt the wounds intoxication's in the air.
Sail into the port of the insincere.
And fill the chalice when you feel discarded.
I've seen your heart.
And it's going nowhere.
(Clarity is all we need, wish for something absolute and let the blessed show us through.
Clarity is now a dream so let the light shine on these dark times)
It's all been overlooked.
Kiss the fury.
And look at what is told.
Kiss the fury.
And watch my skin unfold.
Look what she fed us.
Her trophy full of charities.
And look at this.
We've found the light.
We'll never loose the strength we've had inside.
