Time to rise,
daring a leap in the dark.
Now that you're here and remind me
to love this life,
so good, I lightened my heart,
and I will tell everyone.

Once I was young, never unsure,
free from all doubts, fear of failure.
All that I've done, thought I did right,
people who cared, I put aside.
'Bout not a thing I gave a damn,
later I saw, something was wrong.
Thorned like a rose, I felt alone,
aching for you, bringing me home.

It is time to rise,
daring a leap in the dark.
Now that you're here and remind me
to love this life,
so good - I lightened my heart,
and I will tell everyone.

Years they passed by, I realise
I'm not immortal, I am not wise.
Now I am old but you're still with me,
holding oh hands, embracing the tree.

It is time to rise,
daring a leap in the dark.
Now that you're here and remind me
to love this life,
so good - I lightened my heart,
and I will tell everyone.

Time to rise,
daring a leap in the dark.
And I won't ever forget
that I love this life,
cutting my name into the bark
and you should tell everyone.
