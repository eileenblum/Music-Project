Living easy, loving free, season ticket on the one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be, taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme, ain't nothing i would rather do
Going down, party time, my friends are gonna be there too

I'M ON A HIGHWAY TO HELL
HIGHWAY TO HELL [3x]

No more stop signs, speed limits, nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it, noboby's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, paying my dues, playing in a rocking band
Hey mama, look at me, i'm on the way into the promised land

I'M ON A HIGHWAY TO HELL
HIGHWAY TO HELL [3x]

Don't stop me
Hey hey hey

I'M ON A HIGHWAY TO HELL
HIGHWAY TO HELL [3x]

And I'm going down on the way
On the Highway to hell
