[originally by Rufus &amp; Chaka Khan]Captured effortlessly, that's the way it was
Happened so naturally, I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you holding me close
What was I gonna do? I let myself go
And now we're flyin' through the star
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you, it's been so long
I knew just what I would do, when I heard your song
Filled my heart with your bliss, gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist, I needed someone
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody loves me better
Makes me happy, makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody loves me better than you

I wait for night time to come and bring you to me
Can't believe I'm the one, I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel, I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real, I need this feelin' I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody loves me better
Makes me happy, makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody loves me better than you

And first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh my nights are warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Ain't nobody loves me better
Makes me happy, makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody loves me better than you
