[originally by Scooter]Let's go out for a walk to the other side
Get the sound, join the crew and you feel alright
No more fiction go back to reality
It's the message so listen and you will see
No illusion the spirit is what you feel
Get the volume tonite, you can make it real
I explain once again, we won't let you down
That's what I pronounce

We're getting Fasterâ Harderâ Scooter

From Japan and Brazil to the U.S.A.
Let me ask you if there is a better way
I believe reminiscing the time we had
Don't you know we just want you are going mad
No bad rumors or charges could make us stop
Now the time has come we will reach the top
I explain once again we won't let you down
That's what I pronounce

We're getting Fasterâ Harderâ Scooter
