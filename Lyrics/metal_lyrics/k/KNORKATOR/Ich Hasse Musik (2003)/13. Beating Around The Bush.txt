Smiling face and laughing eyes
But you keep on telling me all those lies
How do you expect me to believe
Honey I ain't that naive
Baby I got my eye on you
Cause you do all the things that I want you to
Stop your crying and dry your tears
I ain't that wet behind the ears

You can throw me lefts
And you can throw me rights
but where was you last night
Beating around the bush

Wish I knew what's on your mind
Why you're being so unkind?
Remember those nights we spent alone?
Talking on the telefone
Thoughts of you go through my brain
You told me that you felt the same
You told me that you love me too
Tell me who was there with you?

I was talking birds
And you was talking bees
Was he was down upon his knees
Beating around the bush

You're the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're looking for
(You ate | you've eaten) your cake, you want some more
I'm gonna give you just a one more chance
Try to save our romance
I've done everything I'm gonna do
The rest is up to you

You can chew it up
And you can spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beating around the bush
