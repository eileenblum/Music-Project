So complacent in your life
It's all just laid out
In front of you
You'll never make a difference
Just do what they say
Do everything they want you to
Drone
You're a slave
You're a drone
Complacent
Never live your life
You're s slave
You're a drone
Worker ant syndrome
Life is more than living
