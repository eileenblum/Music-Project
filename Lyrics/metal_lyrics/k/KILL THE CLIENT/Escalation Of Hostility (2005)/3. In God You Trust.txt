You sinner
The crucifix your cause
The white collar your disguise
Your inner demons hunger
The altar boy's demise
A Christ predator
Out hunting angels
Destroyed their souls
You raped their minds
They'll never get back
You ruined their whole future
And yours
Your false devotion
Doesn't change who you are
In God you thrust
Their lives crushed
In God you thrust
Their destiny crushed
You are pure sin
