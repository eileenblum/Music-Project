Cower in fear while no man stands at the pulpit
Itâs not as if we could do any better
A flash of light
Itâs 3 AM
Hereâs your wake up call
Red phone ringing
No one home
Another vacation
We've reached critical mass
And incompetence is life
Systematic failure is a go
The empty suit is here to stay
But itâs not like I could do better
No one can lead us
To the other side
To the light
They are all corrupt
They are all greedy
They all lie
They all steal
They all fail
They all die
Just like you
