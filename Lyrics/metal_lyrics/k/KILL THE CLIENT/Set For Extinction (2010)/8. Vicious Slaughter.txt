Heads on poles, screaming child
Innocent fools are meant to die
Beating humans from head to toe
Lost my mind a long time ago
Vicious fucking slaughter
No care for the weak
Time to do whatâs right
Kill everyone I see
Impaled bodies, limbs blown away
No more listening to what they say
Murder your family and laugh while you fret
Revenge for abuse I canât forget
Vicious fucking slaughter
No care for the weak
Time to do whatâs right
Kill everyone I fucking see
Fuck you if you canât comply
Itâs my world and you must die
