Why donât you go kill each other
Release me from this social bullshit
Donât judge me - Iâve got problems of my own
Donât ask me - Iâm beyond the point of caring
Iâm not your demigod or talking head or Q &amp; A man
Posing questions to a brick wall
Would yield a better result
Step one, my own best effort
Step two, repeat step one
Step three, fuck it
