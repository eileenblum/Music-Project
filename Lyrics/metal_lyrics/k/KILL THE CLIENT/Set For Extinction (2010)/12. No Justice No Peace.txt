Declared war upon the species
No planned end in sight
Complete breakdown
Of all moral codes
Cultures, habitats, societies
Taken at gunpoint
The future course of life
Set for extinction
Marketed modified foods rotting stomachs
The poor starve as you count McMillions
Take off your blindfold
No justice, no peace
Your sword is useless
Your scales have been compromised
Now youâre only hiding from yourself
From your own bullshit
