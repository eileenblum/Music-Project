Lean, mean fighting machine
Fueled by patriotism
Red, white, and blue illusions of world peace
Bringer of death
Youâre welcome
The battlefield in my mind
Canât stand my own reflection
This fighting machine is broken
Soul crushing reality
Smashed mirrors and pools of blood
No spark, no life
No love for the walking dead
This mission will never be over
