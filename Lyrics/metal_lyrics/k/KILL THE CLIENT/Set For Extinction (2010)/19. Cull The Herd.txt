Cull the herd soft
Weapon deployed
A global sickness
The antidote you canât afford
Extermination of the commons
Global elitism at its worst
Eugenics guarantees their future
Sterilization of the nation
The poor paid to dig mass graves
Stack the bodies, cull the herd
Population control
For the greater good
