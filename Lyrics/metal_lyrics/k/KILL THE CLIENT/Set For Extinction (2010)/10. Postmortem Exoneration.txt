The so called divine system of truth
An overall indictment of failure
Callous, morbid, and foolhardy
The mental torture of an innocent
No one to turn to
No one to believe you
Appeal upon appeal, denial upon denial
The revolving door locked upon entry
Stuck at the dock without the toll
Your sentence reversed
Your chains removed
Futile restoration for the dead
The final insult from an unfair world
The repeat of abject history
Insufficient
