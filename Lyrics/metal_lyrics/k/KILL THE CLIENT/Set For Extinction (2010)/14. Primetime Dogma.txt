Fifty-five inches of heavenly delight
A sick god on an altar
All hail the mighty television
Technologically advanced
Civilization put to sleep by 200 channels of shit and fear
Bask in its truth and knowledge
For its heavenly light shows us
The way to salvation
What to buy
How to sell
Weâre saved
Youâre fuck
Clicking and roaming like sheep
Looking for their shepherds
Beamed direct to the masses
Live via satellite
