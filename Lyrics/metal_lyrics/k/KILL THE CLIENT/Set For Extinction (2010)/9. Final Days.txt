Wild shooters roam the streets
Head shot snipers hide above
Machetes work the houses
Selling final moments of horror
No law left, no retribution
No one to stop the insanity
Civilians turned demons
Inhaling the power of fear like crack
I sit here waiting for the door to be forced
Prepared to execute my own hatred
I have waited my entire life for this moment
