Formulating scenarios
Creating ample markets
To prey upon your fears
Crossing the line of sanity
Always something more
To protect what you buy
Spending wonât make it last longer
Fear drives the purchase
Stop screaming at me
Associating self doubt
With boredom and a wallet
Cashing in on the worst case scenario
Something new to tie you down
Turning risk into revenue
Spending needlessly for anotherâs
Financial well being
Turn off the business of fear
