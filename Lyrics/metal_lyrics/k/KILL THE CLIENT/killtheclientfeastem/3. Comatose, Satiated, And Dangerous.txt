[performed by Kill the Client]Your life is so easy 
that it hurts to move 
to even really think 
a pain unknown 
in fear of outsiders 
a stupid sense of superiority 
in fear of a god 
a disgusting sense of piety 
indignant idiocy runs rampant 
a people controlled by sloth 
you deserve this and worse 
ignorance has never equaled freedom 
and you are a revolting slave controlled 
ignorance has never equaled freedom 
and you are a revolting slave 
controlled 
eat shit
