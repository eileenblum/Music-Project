[performed by Kill the Client]cold war mind control 
radiation disease 
propaganda lived by a generation. 
hammer the red button 
and call the bluff 
greedy two party system 
tabloid journalist 
leading to inevitable human failure 
it feeds fools, nothing but worse to come 
the sickness of a dying planet 
bring back the fear 
erradicate 
all out force 
now end it all 
smile on the face 
planetary demise
