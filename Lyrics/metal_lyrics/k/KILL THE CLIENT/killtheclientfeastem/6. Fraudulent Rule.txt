[performed by Kill the Client]your encroachment upon society is despicable 
thou shalt not steal unless you are the state 
preaching non-violence 
robbery resold as taxes and war as 
you bless the troops for their participation 
liars and thieves 
frauds who demand to rule 
subserveant peasants groveling 
for crumbs and approval 
for what? you have no claim to any of this. 
for what? you are nothing
