Observe this shell this wondrous creation
Why is it forced to ache and to bleed?
Wise men, of old, promised to end the suffering
But their legacy planted the seeds of war

I've dreamt the dream of true revelation
It struck me down then forced me to rise

So walk the path with me
Through the glass, the walls, the wire
Climbing 'til there's no higher
Somewhere beyond
Awaits the crown of kings
Kings of an unseen nation
Reigning with a true intention
To excel and ascend

Your eyes longing to see what can't and won't (be seen)
Secrets too deep in the cosmic design
You crave the truth
Yet seek in the wrong direction
And thus the walls close in on you
