Divine, unscarred and electrified...
Such words of power echo through your mind
Never stop and never break
There's always time to rest in your grave

No time to play around
Move fast or the world will bring you down
Throughout your trials you'll sweat and bleed
But certainly that's how life's meant to be

Conqueror - Your finest hour's still yet to come
Your lucky star is still rising
Seeker - Patience paves the winding road ahead
Somewhere your future is smiling - smiling

Pay no heed on to the mindless herd
Their babble is both worthless and absurd
Never will they understand
Your actions, reasons or your master plan

Set your mind on the task at hand
Fuel your wrath with the misery you've had
Throughout your trials you'll sweat and bleed
But certainly that's how life's meant to be
