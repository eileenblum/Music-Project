stronger than ten tied with blood put together
cooler than shades on a statue of ice
more prestigious than words bound in leather
always untouched by the ignorant lies

I've finally seen myself through the eyes of the others

we chase our dreams, we sacrifice
we know that's what makes us better
though more of me means less of you
I have no doubt this is something that I have to do

faster than bending the end to beginning
sharper than wit that is parched beyond dry
more courageous than honest in sinning
always untouched by the ignorant lies

I've seen myself through the eyes of the others
I can accept that they won't understand
I've seen myself through the eyes of the others
I've shed it all to be able to stand
