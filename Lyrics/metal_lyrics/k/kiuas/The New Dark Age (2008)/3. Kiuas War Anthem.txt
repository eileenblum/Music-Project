We come with a calmness that only years
Spent out there can give you
We stand out - We wear it with style
From the ranks of the gifted, a single line of
Excellence - lifted
It's time to purge your ears with flame

Wall of sound - Cutting your head -
We trust you've learned your lesson
From the depths - Tearing the ground -
The hands that drag you down
One by one - wiping you out -
This siege cannot be broken
Until the end - this regiment of rumble marches on

Our secret is simple
We're simply better by far
We stand armed and wait for the sign
The beauty of conquest,
The rush that seems to last a lifetime
It's time to purge your ears with flame
