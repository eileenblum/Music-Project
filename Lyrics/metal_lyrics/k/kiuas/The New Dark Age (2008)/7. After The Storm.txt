By morning, it had blown over
We venture out to see, what remains
It had been creeping, closer and closer
But so far we dodged it, time and time again

I used to try just to live my life, the simple lie
I was afraid, to own up to the truth
We're not like you, we will never be content with what we're given
We will pursue this to the end
Left no trail of crumbs behind

Friends that i had have since become strangers
After the storm it was perfectly clear
Ones that i loved warned me of danger
But by now there's no place for fear

I used to try just to live my life, the simple lie
I was afraid, to own up to the truth
We're not like you, we will never be content with what we're given
We will pursue this to the end
Left no trail of crumbs behind

We're not like you, we will never be content with what we're given
We will pursue this to the end

I used to try just to live my life the simple lie
I was afraid to own up to the truth
We're not like you, we will never be content with what we're given
We will pursue this to the end
Left no trail of crumbs behind

I used to try just to live my life the simple lie
I was afraid to own up to the truth
We're not like you we will never be content with what we're given
We will pursue this to the end
Left no trail of crumbs behind
