Words spoken without intent
songs borrows and used and spent
I need myself to remember
what I tend to forget
in realms hidden in the mind
where power and truth reside
the beast sleeps waiting to
hear its burden call

come through the stars
come through the earth
grant me illumination
I see it clearly now
this blessed revelation
by my own will
drawn from within
the veil is taken from my eyes
the me inside me tearing through
loud and demanding in its cries

in a hole with no light or walls
endless rows of locked up doors
a secret is hidden
concealed from us all
and so it remains
to those who are not willing
to challenge the rules
reap what you sow
I know I will
