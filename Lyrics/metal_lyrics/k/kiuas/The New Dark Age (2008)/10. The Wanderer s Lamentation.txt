I walk on the burning sands
I walk in the freezing cold
I walk from the verdant woods
to desolate rocks and stone
air it speaks to me
ground keeps me company
carrying me on my journey

they call me the Wanderer
i seek the truth
i read between the lies
they call me the Wanderer
I wonder am I doomed
to seek but never find

songs -- give me powers to cross the seas
to reach the divine frontiers
my feet are numb
I'm blinded by the burning sun
hear -- I will not abandon this now
I can still prove myself somehow
restore my strength
and I'll go to the ends of the earth

I long to wander free
throughout, across, within
I hurry patiently
I move with no movement at all
when the way ahead looks narrow
let me flow through like a stream
when a wall stands in my way
let It crumble right away
