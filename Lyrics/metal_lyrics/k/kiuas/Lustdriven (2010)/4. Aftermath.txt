Snakes in your mouth
Their tongues whisper a venomous lie
So well disguised
They deceive even you

They're not to blame
They're just part of this game
Where egos make the moves
And hearts always lose

[Chorus:]
Anger grows in me
Twisting my sense of reality
This sweet dream shattered
Beauty and bliss that could have been

Now â as you're weak and bleeding
Dwelling in your tomb of misery
I â still undefeated
Enjoy the spoils of my victories
Too late to see my divinity

With blood and with sweat
I've paid for my success
Even more dedication
I would've offered you

But you're a disease
A parasite I do not need
Gladly I leave you on
The withered killing field

[Chorus]

Now â as you're weak and bleeding
Ditching your soul in a rotten tomb
Sick, alone and needing
You hope I'd be there to comfort you
Your time for pity is overdue

[Chorus:]
Anger burns in me
Releasing me from this misery
One sweet dream shattered
But now I know who I'm meant to be

Force â it gathers in us
Leading us on to our destiny
With might now handed to us
We shine with joy, grace and unity
You just did not want to follow me

You â alone and needing
I â still undefeated

You lie weak, cold, alone and needing
I move on forever undefeated
