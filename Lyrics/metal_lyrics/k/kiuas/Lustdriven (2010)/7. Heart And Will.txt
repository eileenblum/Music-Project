Calm and still
Emotions do not disarm me
Heart and will
See what my eyes cannot see

Once I'm here I will not stray
On this path I will remain

Calm and still
Is the forceful mind
Firmly guided by
Heart and will
Wells of endless might
For those in turn with life

Each day begins
Greeting my life's foundation
Every moment
Receiving full dedication
