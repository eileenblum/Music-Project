No chance of an escape
A war of roses, hearts astray
As others like them they lived just to take

I failed this one last time
Honesty my only crime
Just couldn't see behind that deceiving smile

Yes, you have seen me fall
I might stumble but never will I crawl... and you?

Now you're dropped from the sky
Can little angel fly? Tears in your eyes
It's you who are weak this time

Cruel is the night
So run, angel, run and hide
No one by your side
Cry, little angel, cry

Step into my world this time
Let's see can the beast survive
Its fangs are helpless
When the truth destroys the lies

It feeds on hearts it breaks
Never gives and lives to take
The devil's pretty angel wings are fake
