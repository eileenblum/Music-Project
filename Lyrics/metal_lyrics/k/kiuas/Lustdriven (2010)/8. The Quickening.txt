Scorched once by the fire
On one of those long trips to hell
And my demons are still alive and well

Dark reflections
Of what I have left behind
Haunt my rest and leave me tired

Found my direction
My sails are full tonight
And my trials have left me inspired

I'm ready and willing,
So just let the dice roll

I was scorched once by the fire
On one of those long trips to hell
And my demons are still alive and well

But now their master has tamed them
For they couldn't break my spell
In my own utopia is where we dwell

Sweet temptation
A passion that was denied
Her venom poisons me no longer

New revelations
Have healed the wounds inside
And my will keeps growing stronger

With all new eyes
Now the future king sees the world
