He came along across the snows
Spitting curses from his mouth
Striding through the icy land
Grasping steel within his hand

Humiliation he suffered
Such that a man cannot forgive
But must deliver revenge
Like a true warrior he will

A bitter man - a void embrace
Weariness toward the human race
Soul torn to pieces
By chains of despair

Finally he arrived
And from the gates he announced
Time to wake for I have come
The reckoning is here!

But first let's drink your finest ale
Let our spirits free
Let it rise into our heads
Before I'll make you bleed

YksinÃ¤Ã¤n hÃ¤n vaeltaa mis' varjot lankeaa
Halki usvan ja roudan vain terÃ¤s seuranaan
SydÃ¤mensÃ¤ kylmÃ¤ on kuin maa routainen
Mutta silmissÃ¤Ã¤n viha polttava kuin kiuas tulinen
