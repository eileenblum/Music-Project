Somewhere within the darkest moors
between black cliffs like the devil's teeth
a child was born with a warrior's heart
son of the stars, of ice and flame

he marches with pride in his every step
with an iron will and a mind sharp as a demonblade

but darkness builds up in his mind
as a cold breeze moves across the sky
in battle sworn to die 
he unsheats the blade with fire in his eyes

warrior soul blazes through the land of frost and snow
his pagan heart and flesh built to endure the cold
warrior soul to the death against all foes he fights
he's born under the northern lights

deep within the shadows of the woods
among the beasts that dwell in the darkness
a child was born - 
a daughter of the night and the rising moon
she runs like the wind 
and in her heart she carries the secret powers of the elders

but darkness builds up in her mind
as a cold breeze moves across the sky
in battle sworn to die 
she unsheats the blade with fire in her eyes

warrior soul blazes through the land of frost and snow
her pagan heart and flesh built to endure the cold
warrior soul to the death against all foes she fights
she's born under the northern lights

[solo]

in the dark we must find our own way
though we know the winding path leads to the grave
still battles left to fight
we must keep our pride until the end of time

warrior souls blazing through the land of frost and snow
our pagan hearts and flesh built to endure the cold
warrior souls to the death against all foes we fight
we're born under the northern lights

warrior souls blazing through the land of frost and snow
our pagan hearts and flesh built to endure the cold
warrior souls to the death against all foes we fight
we're born under the northern lights
we're born under the northern lights
