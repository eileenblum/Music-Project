Silently and high we stand where we've been for ages
carved from the primal matter an infinity ago
lone eagle soars by and greets us with it's echoing cry
silently we welcome him to join us under the evening sky

we - we are the witnesses of countless legends
we - know the secrets of the gods

we've been here since the earth's creation
here we stand holding up the sky
we posses the shards of ancient wisdow
standing high we are the birthmarks of time

someday our time will come 
since nothing is eternal
when the final profecies are fullfilled 
we are the last ones to stand

we - we are the witnesses of countless legends
we - we know the secrets of the gods

we've been here since the earths creation
here we stand holding up the sky
we posses the shards of ancient wisdom
standing high we are the birthmarks of time
