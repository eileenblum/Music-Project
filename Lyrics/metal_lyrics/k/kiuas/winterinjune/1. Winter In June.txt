[VERSE:]
Fall on me black snow 
(fall on me black snow)
Freeze my lonely soul 
(freeze my lonely soul)

[CHORUS:]
Thrown off the edge by a cold hard winter breeze
I break inside as the black snow falls on me

You betrayed me, you scarred me, you broke me, 
brought darkness and frost to embraze me
The sun burns my skin but the cold inside opens my wounds
Thanks to you now's my winter in June

[VERSE:]
All gods hear my cry
(all gods hear my cry)
Grant me wings to fly
(grant me wings)

[CHORUS:]
'Cause I'm
Thrown off the edge by a cold hard winter breeze
I break inside as the black snow falls on me

You betrayed me, you scarred me, you broke me, 
brought darkness and frost to embraze me
The sun burns my skin but the cold inside opens my wounds
Thanks to you now's my winter in June

[SOLO]

[CHORUS:]
Thrown off the edge by a cold hard winter breeze, aaajee!
I break inside as the black snow falls on me, yeah!

You betrayed me, you scarred me, you broke me, 
brought darkness and frost to embraze me YEAH!
The sun burns my skin but the cold inside opens my wounds
Thanks to you now's my winter in June, IN JUNE, IN JUUUUUUNE!
