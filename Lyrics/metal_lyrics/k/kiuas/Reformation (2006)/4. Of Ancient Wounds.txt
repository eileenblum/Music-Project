Once long ago,
Guiding them across the open steppe
On their land the sun god rose and set
They ran and rode like the wind,
Their hearts and future open wide
As free children of the earth and sky

[Chorus:]
Brothers rise and greet the pagan sun
So long forgotten in the darkness
Now, praise the resurrected gods,
Awakened from their age of silence

Then the enemy arrived
Bringing death and plague in their stride
The shadow of the cross spread far and wide
Now the destruction complete,
Reign of old cultures obsolete
Waiting for centuries to be reborn

Just like the children of the plains
So long ago, so far away
Our forefathers shared the same forgotten pain
But now the silence will end
As the pagan sun rises again

Our ancient wounds opened again
Crying to the winds for revenge
A 1000 lakes,
A 1000 tears,
Unspoken for a 1000 years

Our scars have been buried deep inside
Anger took so long to ignite
And wash away the North Star's pain
As the pagan sun rises again
