Man's old curse - the lust for power
Consumes the weak like an infection
Toying with forces they can't comprehend
Their despicable minds never see the deception

A masquerade and a carnival of fools
Dreaming of diabolical powers
They will never learn the source of the true infernal spring

[Chorus:]
With eyes of the night
I'm staring inside the heart of the serpent
Though it's always disguised
I can almost reach the flame

Turn away from the heavens, the truth is closer to grasp
Forget the dreams of afterlife,
The day is here and it's fleeting fast

A masquerade and a carnival of fools
Dreaming of God's salvation
They will waste their lives
Never seeing the supreme divinity

[Chorus:]
With eyes of the night
I'm staring inside the heart of the serpent
Though it's always disguised
I can almost reach the flame

With my eyes of the night
Getting used to the light,
Seeing now what I've never seen before,
I can only smile knowing I still cannot find a way to reach what
I'm holding inside
