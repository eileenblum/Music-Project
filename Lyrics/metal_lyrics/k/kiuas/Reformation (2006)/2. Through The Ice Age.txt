A cold and icy world lies around me
I journey on with a weapon of might to conquer all
A heart forged out of flame,
Bearing my name,
Burning everything that stands in my way
Yearning the world for itself

[Chorus:]
Born to stride in the cold
Shielded by my guardian demon horde
Led by their flames
Through the coldest ice age to where my throne awaits

Haven't had much sleep since I can't remember
No time to rest, the path lies ahead
Whipped by the winds of chaos,
Bit by the frost right through my spine
But still I go on to reach my crowning
