The shadows that keep haunting your soul
Drag you again into the cold
Time to rise!
The challenge is being thrown down from the skies

[Chorus:]
Hear the call of the horns singing the anthems of war,
Hear the call to arms
Our future's been forged somewhere on the anvils of the gods,
Time for the first strike to land!

Plagued by the demon of throes,
Exploiting your weakness
Cast aside your fears, raise your sword!
And laughing sends the demon back into the abyss
