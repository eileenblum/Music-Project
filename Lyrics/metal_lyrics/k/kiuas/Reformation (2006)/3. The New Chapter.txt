Running through the hourglass of time
Another day passes by
Turning into a sleepless night
Yearning for something I don't know
Tension inside me still grows
Until the new chapter unfolds

Seems no matter how hard you try
The thorn still burns in your side
Throughout this test that we call life
We win and lose everyday
It's like you've heard the Christians say:
"The Lord giveth and taketh away"

[Chorus:]
Breaking the walls surrounding me
Rising with integrity
Into a new supremacy
Forging dreams into reality

Reaching high into the stars
Beyond what once seemed too far
With the force that lives within
The new chapter shall begin

No scars, no wounds too deep to hide
Yet feeling hollow deep inside
As if something there has died
The restless heart of a child
That keeps visions, dreams alive
Still dwells waiting inside
