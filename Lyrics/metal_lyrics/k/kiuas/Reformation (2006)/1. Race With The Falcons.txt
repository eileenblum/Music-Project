O' mighty one, thou who once reigned the earth and sky
I call you, come forth from the darkness
Grant me the knowledge to see all and an engine of war,
With it to strike down my foes,
To fly across the reformed world

[Chorus:]
Like the lightning in the night
Slashing through the pitch-black sky,
Reaching towards a new horizon
Let me rise again and ride
With the north wind through the sky
And feel the taste of a new conquest
...and race with the falcons

Too long I've dwelt in shadows once again
Waging the war inside my head
Now hardened by the cold to be
Unbroken once and for all
With the gods by my side,
Armed and ready to strike
