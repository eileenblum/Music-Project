A pure young soul, thrown into this world
- Left alone out in the cold
A hungry heart burns with the taste for life
But wicked is the flesh and fast the seeds of evil
grow
As temptation waits in shadows of the night

We've lit the fuse that slowly burns away our lives
Just like the burning bridges we have left behind
Cold shadows crawling to devour us from within
As the pain eats us slowly from inside

On winds of death we ride

Feed the hunger that never dies -
The flesh needs to be satisfied
Although it kills the purity inside
Innocence long since torn away
Like beasts we now just seek our prey
Accelerating fast towards the grave
