The ship of life sets out on its course
Sending out a challenge to the gods
As the cold black sea waits silently
We embark to find our destiny

Left alone in the arms of fate
The world sees and feels our every move
With an open restless mind
We leave the first shore behind

Surrounded by the voices of the night
We struggle on and try not to look behind

Washed away by waves of love and hate
To be swept around by the hands of fate
Dark skies whip me with silver tears
The night whispers secrets into my ears

Winds blow cold across the raging sea
Singing songs of what used to be
Anxiously we embrace the storm
(Until we reach the shore)

Currents flow around me
Carrying other souls just like me
Drained of strength by the burning sun
Frozen by fear of what's to come
But one day this journey will greet death
And the time will come to leave the deck
Birth to death and shore to shore
Maybe the journey will begin once more
