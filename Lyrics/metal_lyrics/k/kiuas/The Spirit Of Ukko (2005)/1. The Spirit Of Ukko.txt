Greetings, we are here tonight
To bring the flames of Ukko to your hearts
On this black night the stars are aligned
These ancient fireworks play their parts

Born from the dark to light a flame
What once had died shall rise again

Winds sweep the snow, resurrecting songs of darkness
Born from the cold to light a flame within our hearts
Winds sweep the snow, resurrecting songs of darkness
Born from the cold, now it's celebration time...
... The spirit of Ukko will burn with us tonight!

Let's bring back the good old times
When the true gods used to reign the northern skies
For centuries they've been away
But the memory and spirit still remains
