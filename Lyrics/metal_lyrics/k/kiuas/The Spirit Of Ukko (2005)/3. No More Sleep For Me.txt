I went down to the river and what did I see
The waters they ran bloody red
Ten thousand people all looking at me
Wishing that I was dead

The sins of my brothers they came down on me
I fled for my pleas were in vain
There was no pursuit they lacked strength but not hate
My conscience was left with a stain

Disillusioned and haunted
Now there's no sleep for me

We have the choice we have the strength
Now where's the will
I don't know 'bout your cravings
But I just can't stand still

Memories growing so distant with time
No longer do I even care
Still, when I wake up the screams in my head
Remind me of what I left there
