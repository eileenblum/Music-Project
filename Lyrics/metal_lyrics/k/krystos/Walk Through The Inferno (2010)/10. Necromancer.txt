With this new light
Taken from horror and beauty
Both passion and fright
Love is what's to find
As evil rages are stricken
With heavens moonlight
Who once was born unholy
Bringer of the dead
Evil stirs inside
Troubles you have fled
Demonic was what used to be
Changes your aim instead
Align with me and you'll come
To find the madness in their end
Pleadings begun
Contemplating the curses
From witches leads on
But strength will survive
As evil rages are stricken
With heavens moonlight
