"Don't need the light to blind me
Better off in sin surrounding
To the first attack of the stunning display
Swarming immensely for those first to pay
Caught by the site of limbo's cruel torment
To search for the reason
Reason for abysmal pain and haunting torment
Placed in pace just for the souls who rejected
A place to situate a dying race
To a barren wasteland made for those who
Rejected his name
Of frozen light for ages
Don't bring us back to damnation
Of frozen truth for ages
