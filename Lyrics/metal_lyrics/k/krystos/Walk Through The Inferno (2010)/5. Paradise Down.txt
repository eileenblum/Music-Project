Led into a passing of faith
A crushing blow for mankind
(Forever more)
The power in ambient display
No rest for a darkened mind
Revolt and reject what life's gone
To seamlessly bind and will blind all mankind
No logic to truth but to greed it will prove
That your war and your hurting will bring
The Paradise down!
The paradise down!
Peril and sadness takes place
Betrayal first of its kind
(Forever more)
Left them in ambient display
Punishing the hateful minds
