Is it the coming of fortune or years of infinite pain
What we find hiding inside all the tyrant who've slain
Only in time will it teach you only in time will you learn
Drowning in remorse the furies bring fear to those who walk this
Human reason covering a shield to fight for all in which I stand
Destined to journey on fear is not my call
Will the dark in sin shine through us all
From their punishment forever
Cross the crimson river
Life is the coming of fortune or years of infinite pain
What we find hiding inside are the tyrants who've slain
Taking in what I teach you
Only in time will you learn
May the crimson river
Guide the way!
