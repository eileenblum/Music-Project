Torn
The flesh from he soul of my own
I made my voice be heard
Sin
Jeremiah's sin I've acted
Violence for which I'll burn
Expelled
His divine light and love
Twisted roots of my demise
Remorse
No sign or trace or pity
Myself I have denied

Fall to themselves they have slain
I will fall to a death embracing pain
Fall to themselves they have slain
I will fall to a death embracing pain
Fall to the woods of suicide!

Now
A scream I will exalt
In pain my voice comes true
See
A student comes from the ashes
Knowledge he has subdued
Revolt
Your feelings of hate and cower
Embrace the sacrifice
Rebirth
Eternally last forever
Enter paradise

Fall to themselves they have slain
I will fall to a death embracing pain
Fall to themselves they have slain
I will fall to a death embracing pain
Fall to the woods of suicide!

Walls
Within an enclosed mind
Merciless uprise!
Torn
The flesh from he soul of my own
I made my voice be heard
Sin
Jeremiah's sin I've acted
Violence for which I'll burn
Expelled
His divine light and love
Twisted roots of my demise
Remorse
No sign or trace or pity
Myself I have denied

Fall to themselves they have slain
I will fall to a death embracing pain
Fall to themselves they have slain
I will fall to a death embracing pain
Fall to the woods of suicide

Torn
The flesh from he soul of my own
I made my voice be heard
Sin
Jeremiah's sin I've acted
Violence for which I'll burn
Expelled
His divine light and love
Twisted roots of my demise
Remorse
No sign or trace or pity
Myself I have denied

Fall to themselves they have slain
I will fall to a death embracing pain
Fall to themselves they have slain
I will fall to a death embracing pain
Fall to the woods of suicide!
