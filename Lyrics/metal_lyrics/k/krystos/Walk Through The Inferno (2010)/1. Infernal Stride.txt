Threescores of life I found myself alone
Dark wood of error a lonely road
The unholy mountain will lead to him
Tremble now in fear before the three great beasts
And of that dark path a figure rose
My mortal reason and salvation
Exit all light and enter here
Now without hope only truth to bear
"Thy soul is lost"
You won't change me
"In your ways you've served yourself!"
Now it is time to bring light for me
Now it is time
Walking dark halls all of less appeal
Eternal pain falls in much too real
As if my conscious could never tell
Lead into a place that all call Hell
"Thy soul is lost!"
"You won't change me!"
In your ways you've served yourself!"
Now it is time to bring light for me
Now it is time
Walk!
Through!
The inferno
The inferno
The inferno
The inferno
Threescores of life I found myself alone
Dark wood of error a lonely road
The unholy mountain will lead to him
Tremble now in fear before the three great beasts
And of that dark path a figure rose
My mortal reason and salvation
Exit all light and enter here
Now without hope only truth to bear
"Thy soul is lost!"
"You won't change me!"
In your ways you've served yourself!"
Now it is time to bring light for me
Now it is time, to face the enemy!
