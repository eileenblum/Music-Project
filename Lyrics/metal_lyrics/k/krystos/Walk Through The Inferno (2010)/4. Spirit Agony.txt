For his own fate downfall the only other way
My blossomed snake
Now Lucifer controls this world
Attempt for prey
Hunter trapped weakened in dismay
Heart locked in hate
For him I've seemed to wonder
Why he can't just pray and give into the shame
The fueled fire and hissing wounds of pain
Scars shall map the fortunes made
Love and pain both uninsane
Glance into and unknown fate
Agony is now his name
Spirit agony
He would plan for domination with no remorse
Set now in course from a time lost deep in wonder
What's it like to see a tragic heroes destiny
What's life could be for him I seem to wonder
In time you will see my spirit agony
In time will you learn
In time will you learn
