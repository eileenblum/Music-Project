Through gazing eyes
Piercing all time
Betrayers corruption
Would weaken their kind
Time will not tell
Fate is the test
An eye for an eye
Will not put them to rest
I am the concept of your sorrow
And apprentice of your sin
When all hope is finally lost
I am the one who dwells within
I am the calling
And the source of all your lies
I am the doubt
Who would justify your demise
The falsifier!
