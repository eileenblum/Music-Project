Enter a storm now closing in
The compulsive power
And silence when they fall
Heron burned upon this hand
Sworn from the tower
Age is at its end

(All memories fade away)
Just keep them marching on
Deliverance
And in the end they pay the price
Just keep them marching on
In ignorance
Memory of Light

Shadows crept from seven seals
The wheel turns, this world is broken
World dreams falling fast to ruin
Curse the day the madness comes

Blood Moon rose from boiling seas
Sworn into secrecy
Crown of swords ahead
And through the storm we reach the end
At Tarmon Gai'don
Battle closing in

(All memories fade away)
Just keep them marching on
Deliverance
And in the end they pay the price
Just keep them marching on
In ignorance
Memory of Light

Twice reborn, third age at end
Winds of Time will soar again
