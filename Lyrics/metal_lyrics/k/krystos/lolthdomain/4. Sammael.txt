In cryptic lines of ages
I had searched the pattern's cast
Found enigmatic traces
Showing hope was to its last

And in the swarm of hell I fought
Foreboding destinies
I murdered light to fill the dark
The void resides in me

Shards of memories have pierced my mind
And what I'll leave behind
Sovereignty is bought by will
When those before me die

I'll stab them at the heart
I've sworn to tear them down
Where my hammer falls lies judgement
And the end of all

A million lies to take the course
Where all creation spreads
To take the source, deny remorse
I'm crowned in wickedness

All that was good is so far behind
All hail to the great Destroyer of Light
As we have come to the face of time
Our will shall break as our hope is lost

Face him now
At the weave that's falling down
In dying eyes
See the realm where Sammael reigns
Terror strikes

Shards of memories have pierced my mind
And what I'll leave behind
Sovereignty is bought by will
But what would be the price?

In cryptic lines of ages
I had searched the pattern's cast
Found enigmatic traces
Showing hope was to its last

And in the swarm of hell I fought
Foreboding destinies
I murdered light to fill the dark
The void resides in me

All that was good is so far behind
All hail to the great Destroyer of Light
As we have come to the face of time
Our will shall break as our hope is lost
