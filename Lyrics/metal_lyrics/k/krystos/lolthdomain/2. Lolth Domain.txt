Dark Maiden of Lolth
We yearn for the strength of our savior
Our wretched creator

Tell of what's to come
World-God's Betrayer

(Ravenous in the Queen's hive)
From the UnderDark we sought the one
who sundered structural heavens

Guide us near, Lolth of the Forgotten
Guide our way throughout the plane
Lolth Domain

Dark Maiden of Lolth
In pureness we seek to corrupt
Or seek and destroy it

Suffer unto thee
Queen of the Pit

(Bless are the screams of their young)
From the undertones of her song
Tortured rhythms bled from her den

Guide us near, Lolth of the Forgotten
Guide our way throughout the plane

"Hopeless subjects longing for the light
This hell breaks you of the will to stay alive"
