In coldest terror comes,
Brings power unto me
Moves the blood
Body parts of the mind

And in the final act
And where I lay attack
And those who stand their ground
Join all that fall

I will not stand aside
With terror, the rising king strikes

Enter the terror reign
As darkest entities fight
And dominance that they gain
By unbreakable minds

Enter a new day
Where all will not stand
Apart by the rights of life
But in the ever growing
Minds of terror

I will not stand aside
With terror, the rising king strikes

In coldest terror comes
Breath power unto me
Will of blood
Will of thoughts in my mind

Eldest memories and
Darkest centuries
Have broken fear of my mind
For the ones born in part of the night

I am the source of the dead in the night
As many kingdoms are falling
Led by the dark, the uprising starts
Lead all to heed on the call
His strike

I will not stand aside
With terror, the rising king strikes
