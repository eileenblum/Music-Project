More listen to my story
And you'll forget your glory
Don't step into my land
Get million miles away

All night the sparks were falling
The nature became more gloomy
Eyes blinded â no more sight
And feelings are not mine

You've seen the ice and mountains
which I craft my soul in
Here is a wilderness anywhere
You'll be buried under it

All night the sparks were falling
The nature became more gloomy
No matter where you're in
You'll be buried under it

Skylines of mountains grew red
You're blinded by shades of my lords
I've seen the avalanches come
And no more my listeners
Again I'm only one

Skylines of mountains grew red
You're blinded by shades of my lords
It seems something telling to you:
"For you I'm sounding a death knell now!"
