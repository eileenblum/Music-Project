Through the magic gates from this land of tears
I shall fly away on my wings of dreams

I can see a smile of conformity
Staying at the gates to eternity
Through the magic gates from this land of tears
I shall fly away on my wings of dreams

To dimension lost into world's nowhere
To be king of the castles in the air

I can see a smile of conformity
Staying at the gates to eternity
Through the magic gates from this land of tears
I shall fly away on my wings of dreams

...on my wings of dreams!
I'm on my wings of dreams!

For midnight I wait to fuse with the universe
Changing my fate I leave godforsaken earth
Filled with remains of creatures could only crawl
Away from dark plains
Even fly is eternal fall

...on my wings of dreams!
I'm on my wings of dreams!
...castles in the air!
