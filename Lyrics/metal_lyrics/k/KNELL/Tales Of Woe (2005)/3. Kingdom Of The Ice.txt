They're losing the way in my kingdom of the ice
Peaks are risen so high and deepest caves alive
Here the moment seems like many days
There's no happiness in my yards and caves

Dusk was born here in this land untouched
It's getting colder, I am tired
Crawling, falling, crying on the knees
Who are you for me
Friend or enemy?

Try to survive there till the first sunrise
With the white flamed trees those never dim
Crying to the moonlight in the skies
The wounded wolves praying for their lives

Perhaps someone wonders what you would do
If it under rubble was you
Winter's souls are flying above the grounds
In my kingdom of the ice

Sleep if you can
Hoping for something
Sitting and starring
Chaos season's starting

Sleep if you can
Tired and lonely
Wasting to nothing
Buried under rubble

You have no-where else to live
Hug it in your arms to the beating heart
Someone wonders what you would do
If it under rubble of you was you
