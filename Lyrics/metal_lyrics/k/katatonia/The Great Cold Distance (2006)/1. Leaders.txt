Leaders come
Stand in line
Reveal your true self &amp; conform
I sold my song
Crossed the borderline
I found something I'd never adjust to

Come here
I've Paid up for you
I have sold my weakness too
Come here
I split my heart in two
But you don't have it in you
Do you

Carbon soul
Transparent &amp; played out
See you soon in non-fiction
I sold my song
My mouth was sewn
but it's coming undone &amp; that's why I sold out
