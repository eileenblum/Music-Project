Movement
Subdued back then
So quiet now
Subsequent
Systematic violence
The great cold distance

The itch
The urge

Make way
Think of something
Thin out the fear
Past the tracks
Part the Ways
One stand here
Medicate
Kill the itch
Check the air
And push to get there

Monochrome
Symbol on the surface
Reduced Illumination
Chemical Inheritance

The lies
The Fever
