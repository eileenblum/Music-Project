Pushing the will
Being alive
Well I have been
I came far
The process of trying
To act unharmed
It will fade out

Thoughts will unwind
No longer mine
They are for you
When you come
So long
I'm cutting here
And the water's blood
When you come

The sky moves faster at this time of year

Recorded at Fascination Street studios, near rebro, Sweden.
Mastered at the Cutting Room in Stockholm, Sweden.
Total playing time 51:52
