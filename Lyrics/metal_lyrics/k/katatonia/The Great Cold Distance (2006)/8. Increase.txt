Vapor
As thin as it gets
I stare right through
The severe sickness in this room
Not mine
It comes from you

Soul cold
Indeed
There won't be a time when I'm at ease
Increase coldness
Increase ignorance

Please
Rewind and look at you
As on film
You will see a mask of shame
I think you will
Perceive
Your position in life
So unworthy

Find and twist the answer
Save no one from harm
As seen in the vision
Sick sleep sick dead earth
