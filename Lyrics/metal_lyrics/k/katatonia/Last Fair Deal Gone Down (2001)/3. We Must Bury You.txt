we had you down on your knees
we were kicking you in the head
we tried to hang you from the trees
we didn't stop until you were dead

we must bury you
we must bury you
we must bury you so deep
that noone should find you

forgive me for covering my eyes
forgive me for not saving you
forgive me for being so unwise
forgive me for letting this
be true
