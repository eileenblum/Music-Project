I have been destroyed
by the perfection that is life
see I'm moving soon
see my feet are already on the road

and if you know where I'm going
don't tell a soul

I live all for this thing
that I heard someone sing
when you have noone

noone can hurt you

IT WAS SO EASY TO SEE
HOW FUCKING GOOD IT ALL COULD BE
