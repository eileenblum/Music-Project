she's got black hair
and she has got a black dress
she's pretending
that her life is a mess
but I cannot rest
with so many worries
I can't lie down
and say I am done

I live 'cause I need more light
I hope I can change today
she would never think of changing
too much fucking emo, it's false (I know)

she stops me in the street
and asks me to follow

I would if I could
if I wouldn't mind breaking her.
