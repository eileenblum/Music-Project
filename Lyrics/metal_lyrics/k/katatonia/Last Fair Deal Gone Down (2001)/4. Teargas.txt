why have you put so many things into my eyes
that I can't see clear
who's paid you for telling me what I'm worth
and run in fear
it has been for me a strain to see already
what have you done
the rising noise
the sharpened smells
the deadened sight

what is it in my eyes
a piece of broken glass
is this the time I should be on my knees for you
is this your way of telling
another has been found
now I know,
it's teargas in my eyes
