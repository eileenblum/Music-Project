this is no good way out
but it's a challenge or so I see it
death's head upon my wall
afield lies nothing but disorder

no good can come of this
whatsoever I can tell you
no good will ever come of this
the road to happiness I never knew

I read a letter I never sent
and saw me smiling on a picture
this is nothing I remember
whatever made me feel so

there are children
on the freeway
I have my ways
playing with death
