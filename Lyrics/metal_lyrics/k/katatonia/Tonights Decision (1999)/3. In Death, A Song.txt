you came back to a place without sun
and you don? t seem to know what you've done
to me
now I see
darkness is what you left in me

you went with nothing to fear
came back with nothing to lose
and with summer leaving us here now
we? re thinking of what to chose

I know so well what is wrong
a language that is hard to speak
for all of us lies in death a song
in times when truth is turning weak
