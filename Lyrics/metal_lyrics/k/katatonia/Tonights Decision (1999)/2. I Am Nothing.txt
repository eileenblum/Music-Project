tonight I'm nothing
it doesn't matter where I've been
delay of reaction is
the unseen movie of this life

I remember one of my friends
telling me to go ahead

water on every side
there's a dead spot in my eye
if I listen close at night
there's something coming my way

like someone called my name
but I didn't care to look that way
I just fixed my eyes into the crowd
it would have been strange to turn around

if you would tell me that I was someone
then for a second I would think
just like I would try to consider
how it would feel to know

I have to get on with this
it's a decision for tonight
out to look for chances
it is murder of my mind

once I was someone new
I was chosen for a while
then with time I am changing
at least that is what they say

what is worth with being here
I pray so often for a change
