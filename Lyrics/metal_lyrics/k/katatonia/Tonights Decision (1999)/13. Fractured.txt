knew i would fall if i tried
so i held back for a while
you pushed me so hard, i had to go
i tried to be strong, then i failed 

i would like to say this
just in case you didn't know

well your soul is fractured
i know what it's like as well
i have sold my soul
i traded it for hollow gold

Thanks to jhva_elohim_meth for sending lyrics to the tracks 12, 13.
