I sense infliction in the air
it's only me
I'm fucking up old times
it's a remembrance

o this
black session in my mind
o the black

I was too weak to fight
once more I let go
it is a black session
an invitation of sorts

I keep on living in this my only wish
that life will be good someday
I keep on losing my sleep because of this
seems so hard just to stay

so if you come by just this last time
I'll be here
and I will talk to you like
if this had never been

o this
black session in my mind
o the black
