i've turned down all devotion
i'm so far from being here
can't bring forth more power
than i have already done 

tonight i'm trying
and i see all dread in me

but then i lose again
all hope of being someone
this lack of devotion
will put me to an end

so if you want to save me
and stop me when i run
just tell me that i'll have now
a day less to live when i'm done
