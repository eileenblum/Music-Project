I'm drawing back time
to feel things once again
as when I had found them

I saw you grow older
saw myself grow older too
but not as much as you
if I only knew

I had sulfur in my heart
but not enough strenght to give it a spark
I didn't know when to start
when we were bright or when we were dark
I had a wind in my chest
blew as hard as it ever could
I could have written books for you
if I only knew

I held my head down I know
and you walked around in circles
I'm sure you already knew
if I only knew it too

so much I want to ask you
you have no time to let me do so
there is no light in my pathway
you must tell me where to go
