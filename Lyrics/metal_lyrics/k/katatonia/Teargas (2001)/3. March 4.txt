left with spring alone
I withdraw from this
I lived so differently
it wasn't good enough

I was with you alone
winter was gone

things once blurred are twice sharpened
when I think of what I could have
blood has left me even before you
can never return a second time

I lived so differently
did it all for it
but everything is now
a film on rewind
