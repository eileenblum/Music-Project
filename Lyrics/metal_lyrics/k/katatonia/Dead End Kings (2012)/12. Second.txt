[Music by Jonas Renkse, Anders NystrÃ¶m, Lyrics by Jonas Renkse]

Sun has lost
Mountains fell
What took away our anchor
Snow in the old sky
Escape is a long dead end

We need to rise higher

Temples burn
Fires underneath
What controls our anger
Moon coming in
Sun has lost
Did you know
Mountains fell

Letting one second go on
To go over a lifetime
We were such good friends
Will you find me where I am now
