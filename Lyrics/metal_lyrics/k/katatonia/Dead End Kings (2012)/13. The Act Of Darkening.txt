[Music &amp; lyrics by Anders NystrÃ¶m]

So dark
Once an amusement park
Troubled whispers sound
On a mute merry-go-round

So cold
Once a playground of gold
Caved in long ago
And then poisoned with the snow

Oceans of time
Broken patterns align
Hearts washed upon the isle

It carries your name
Like radiance in the rain
The wailing sirens alarm

Old memories hang on and gravitate by weights of sorrow
Through cracks and wounds our pain reflected in a thousand mirrors
It is time for deeds to take the shape of vows and codes of promise
The time to let our minds speak silently in the act of darkening

Out of reach and gone from view
Now light is one step behind you
On the other side of the soul
The void resolves one final role

Collapse into absence
