[Music by Anders NystrÃ¶m, Lyrics by Jonas Renkse]

Dim my lights
Time is frail
You shut my mind
But oh well
Trapped and choked
Erased my trail
Split the chest
My heart couldn't feel more pale
Only once
Could I see clear

Vexation
Internal void
My dreams are getting darker and darker
And darker

This life before me
Its blood runs so still
The call of the bird
The song that makes the hours go

The change
Inactive
Dead letters
Form these words

Dim my lights
One by one
The sordid pale
Broken run
Confined in escape
On burnt grass
Below the crest
Lie in wait for the ending

Songs that make the hours go
