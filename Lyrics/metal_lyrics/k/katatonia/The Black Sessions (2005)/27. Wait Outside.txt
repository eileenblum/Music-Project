I burn the bridges behind me
Can't tell you the truth so I lie
I'm waving at someone behind you
I filter my eyes when I look at the sky

Time to lose
Tell them everything
Say I lost my light
Your word means everything
I cannot say it right
I withdraw
Lost my everything
My vision is unclear

Wait for me outside
Will you hold on
Can you hold on
