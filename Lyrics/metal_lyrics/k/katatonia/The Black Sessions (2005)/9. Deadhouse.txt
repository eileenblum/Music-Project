Somehow better without this
Headlights fuck the city
Somewhere I'm broken
No sensations nevermore

What do you say when you speak
I sense no time
Discouraged television sleep
Not awake until it's dark

Somehow I never leave
This deadhouse
Somehow I don't mind being gone
And if you think you've seen me
I have to prove you
That you're wrong
