Left with spring alone
I withdraw from this
I lived so differently
It wasn't good enough

I was with you alone
Winter was gone

Things once blurred are twice sharpened
When I think of what I could have
Blood has left me even before you
Can never return a second time

I lived so differently
Did it all for it
But everything is now
A film on rewind
