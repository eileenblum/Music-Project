I've turned down all devotion
I'm so far from being here
Can't bring forth more power
Than I have already done

Tonight I'm trying
And I see all dread in me

But then I lose again
All hope of being someone
This lack of devotion
Will put me to an end

So if you want to save me
And stop me when I run
Just tell me that I'll have now
A day less to live when I'm done
