O my sweet nurse
Pull the curtain aside for a while
So that I can for once have
The sun in my eye
You smile and say
It's a fine day

O my sweet nurse
Pull the curtain aside for a while

Then like a ghost at night
You come around all dressed in white
Talking to me
And so I have to drink
The water with your poison spilled
For no more will

O my sweet nurse
Seems you have so little time
That you rather put
Me to sleep than sit by my side
