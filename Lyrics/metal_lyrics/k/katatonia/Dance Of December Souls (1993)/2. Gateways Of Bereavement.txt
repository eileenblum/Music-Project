[november 92]

I stand as I cry
Mourning in the Silent rain
Death will light my Burden
Endless is my Sorrow
Gateways so Dark
All these years of Dying

Gone are dreams of Velvet Voices
I am you, we were one
Vast are fields I walk
Where sorrow never dies
The Sky unities with the Blackened Rain
Summon with my Tears
Now descend on WinterWings
My withering Soul.

Let me Die.
Gateways of Bereavement
A Temple of guilt
Falling Deep
Embraced in Grief
My withering soul
Let me Die

Farewell life and all I died for
now my time is over on Earth
Another journey has begun
Alone I died, not praying for mercy
nor praying for Salvation
A lonely Journey in a Darkened Dream
Time has come to spread my Wings

Slow...
Descending from a Silent sky
Death comes to take me away
And from the Gateways you hear me
cry...

...I love you...
