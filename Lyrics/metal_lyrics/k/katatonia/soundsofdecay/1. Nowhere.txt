atmosphere decays in me i fail to convict my useless days
the lack of substance circle of downfall
exitless ways into pale wake tired attempts to crush the design
it's like nowhere i cannot sell the plight that is mine
everything is real but i'm  not here i've lost my strength somewhere
nowhere used to care about weather used to plan the days that came
used to try and watch you used to know my name
someone said remember but i can't remember anything at all
anything at all
