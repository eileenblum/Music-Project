all my presence died today i breathe to memories
guess i'm closing down torn and tired of my heart's sound
what's worth to me when life's not around
i will sleep tonight to sleep tomorrow if i sleep at last
a promise has been broken the essence of
love in rust one in a million i'm the one turning pale
any colours to express apart from bleak is hard
and where you are my thoughts are in guilt so forget me forget me not
time to catch something since my ticket says the end
all my flowers withered today the room is quiet guess it's
growing cold dead calm without my heart's sound what's worth
to you when i'm not around i will sleep tonight
to sleep tomorrow
if i sleep at last
