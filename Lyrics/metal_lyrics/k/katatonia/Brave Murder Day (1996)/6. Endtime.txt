[Stuart Ullman:] ...because, uh, for some people, solitude and isolation can, of itself become a problem.
[Jack Torrance:] Not for me.
[The Shining, 1980]

Now fall into a vacant sphere
Pierced by the darkness
They called it death
And surrounded me with sleep

They lost the Earth in fire
Waved it into a sea
This is not what you saw
The Earth in fire

Now fall into a vacant sphere
Pierced by the darkness
They called it death
And surrounded me with sleep
