[Chorus:]
Loving mother
He has come
To take your son

Listen
How he strides the earth
When only animals are awake
When the shattering of ideals begin
God of ruin
Will come to you

[Chorus x2]

Fallen
From the faded sky
Nephilim comes through foul air
And when morals will decline
God of ruin
Will come to you

Lalalalala lalalala lalalalalalala lalala

[Chorus x2]
