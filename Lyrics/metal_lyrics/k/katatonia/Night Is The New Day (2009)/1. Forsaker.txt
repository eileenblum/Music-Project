Rage from a distant
The name unfamiliar
Spikes reach the heart
Time set for rewind

[Chorus:]
The dark will rise
Abandon your freedom
Give up the right to find the true self
Forsake your own reasons

Forsaker [x2]

Hand of a leader
Bleached by snowfall
Opposition is drugged
The great end is sweeping in

[Chorus]

Forsaker [x3]
