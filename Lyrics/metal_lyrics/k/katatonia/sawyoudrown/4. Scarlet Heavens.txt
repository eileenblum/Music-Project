only for the wind I lay myself down
feeling this scarlet scent of death
under ebony shades I dream of a child
dancing in heaven, dancing in heaven

I must have seen this face before
a monument of shallow sorrows
under ebony shades a child now dies
but grievance won't regain

something grasp for my soul
I think it's god
but my sorrow is dragging me down
through my sins

where is god in his heaven
why am I a twisted mind
now I see the light above
but in darkness I must fall

for my soul you pray at last
will I find my place?
the stench of sorrow that pierce my flesh
can never be pure

when the blackness overwhelms me
where shall I turn
to run away to never look back
to run away from evil
