as through your shattered eyes
it all came together
and your heart cries
weeping through the weather
another way to change your mind
I'm weaker than they say
to leave this world behind
the only way to stay

don't you know
I'm the end of what we'll be
and right below us
the last thing you'll see

in the water
I saw you drown
down the water
I saw you drown

as through my shattered sight
you're no longer here
and my heart cries
sleeping through the light
another way to change my mind
never is the day
to leave this all behind
the only way to stay
