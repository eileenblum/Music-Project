Human Birds Watch The Sky
Where Dark Formations Sail
Infecting The Area of God
Jhva Elohim Meth

I Am God - Creator of Life
I Am God - Enchanter of Death
Death That Now Marks You
Life That Slowly Pass Away

Screams of Fear Dismembering The Wind
Helpless Souls Drowning In Pain
But Storms of Dawn, A new Age
A Dawn Without God

My Spirit Filled With Hate Sets Free
A Force of The Golden Dawn
Without God...Entomb Your Fear

The Spirit Is Free
Jhva Elohim Meth
Satan Laughs
Jhva Elohim Meth

I Raise My Fist To The Sky
Swear The Ancient Oath of Black
The Lambs Shall Bleed, Eternally Bleed
God Is Dead and Shall Forever Be...
