God - burn me for I am a sinner
I have sold my fortune to the beast
Murders scream for my empty soul
Forever hiding in the life beneath
I lie underneath their grace eternal
Pure white shroud of innocence
God - burn me for I am a sinner
I have killed the love of the swan
I am a murdurer
I  scream
I pray for death
