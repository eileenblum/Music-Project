We saw it all pass by
And you went by
And I can't control anything
When you said that life can't be what you want 
And I really want everything
When I pray
When I believe
I saw it end long before it ended
Life itself turned pale and ended
I saw you cry out acres of your image
Life itself does not heal me
Like a slow scenery 
I'm losing all my faith
In lifeless motion 
you're walking like you're dead
We saw it all pass by
And you went by
And I can't control anything
When you said that life can't be what you want 
And I really want everything
