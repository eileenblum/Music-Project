Well, these are the words that you won't find.
This closure is not what you had in mind.
Commemorate and relive the harm.
The treason conclude.

Lest we forgive what did bring us here.
This closure is not what you had in mind.
I try to remember you as it was, fragments.

Ghost of different shades, 
cold day up ahead.
I glide away into the dark, 
two hours till morning's due.

And I wait here for you,
to see you rise like the tide.
Graced and admired.

I fall away across the dark.
It will inspire, fell inside!

Touched upon deadened virtue.
Made it burn through weights of courage.
Conformed to all those already hidden.
Their crystal ground!

Steel made wall, see the barrier stand tall.
Ascend through the air and find a heart yet undefined.

Well, these are the words that you won't find.
This closure is not what you had in mind.
Commemorate and relive the harm.
The treason conclude.

Lest we forgive what did bring us here.
This closure is not what you had in mind.
I try to remember you as it was, fragments.

Source of withering code of dust, of deceit.
Can't proceed without a guide.
Intuition abandoned you, I'm clouding the view.

See you rise like the tide.
Graced and admired.
I fall away across the dark.
It will inspire, fell inside!

Touched upon deadened virtue.
Made it burn through weights of courage.
Conformed to all those already hidden.

Conformed to all those already hidden.
Their crystal ground!
