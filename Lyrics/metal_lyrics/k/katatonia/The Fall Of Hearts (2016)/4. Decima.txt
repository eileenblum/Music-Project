Leaving the choirs behind to sing,
of anything fair, of lilac spring.
A dream of truce behind my eyes.
A life of journeys will unwind.

Emerge through idle air.

Born under a troubled sign.
Will it hurt to see me find,
the long lost peace of mind?

Darling, you had me here for a while.
It breaks my heart to see you cry.
In the wake of incomplete time.

Darkness overthrows!

Map of nowhere is in my hand.
The roads are blurred, sojourners land.
So take however long you want, but don't forget my love.
You've pledged yourself to come along.

You're lost in reveries, holding back the tears.
Faint sound of the wires.
The butterfly is in the fire now.

Lost in a memory you're holding my hands.
One heart is in the ground.
The other is veiled in silver all around.

Born under a troubled sign.
Will it hurt to see me find,
the long lost peace of mind?

Darling, you had me here for a while.
It breaks my heart to see you cry.
In the wake of incomplete time.
