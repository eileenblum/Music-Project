I am ready to find the lost way to vanishing days.
I write words void of worth, in my youth I will always stay.
There's room for every lie they put on my shoulders, 
I let it inside.

Inseparable growth marks us still.
Abundance won't come, purge our will.

Cut out and resign.
Overtaken and left behind.
It's in our racing hearts,
the things we never let go of.

They spill into my love!

I'm thinking if torpor had left my soul, voices would sing!
I would submit my heart to the sentiment within,
and let go of the night that is abiding here.

Old songs lost their grace.
Send some light back to this place.
There's room for every lie they put on my shoulders, 
I let it inside.

Inseparable growth marks us still.
Abundance won't come, purge our will.

Purge our will...

It's in our racing hearts,
the things we never let go of.

Cut out and resign.
Overtaken and left behind.
It's in our racing hearts,
the things we never let go of.

Abiding here!

I'm thinking if torpor had left my soul, voices would sing!
I would submit my heart to the sentiment within,
and let go of the night that is abiding here.
