You wait by the river.
Days are long and melt right into nothing.
You wait for my eyes.
And who else is waiting for the summer sky?

Your still voice drives me further under now.
No tomb or blessing, buried in the poisoned ground.

Unbearable to have the beast untied.
The coming of my ruin, age tears the spine.
The devil inside comes back to escort me.

I burn, this fever drives me straight into your arms again.
Unspeakable, drop your withered pride, come back and forgive me.

Freezing in the blue light,
I hid my plan under a blanket of dust.
The pressure of the years,
delivers me back into your grip.

I am pledging my love to you, still waiting.

Breathing under siege,
oppressed by the dreams I have to feed.
Crushed by the flood, I won't let you go.

Born unwise,
seeking trust in a broken creed.
Crushed by the grey, I'm waiting for colour.

You wait by the river, you wait for my eyes.
And who else is waiting for the summer sky?

Your still voice drives me further under now.
No tomb or blessing, buried in the poisoned ground.

Unbearable to have the beast untied.
The coming of my ruin, age tears the spine.
The devil inside comes back to escort me.

I burn, this fever drives me.
Come back and forgive me!

I burn, this fever drives me straight into your arms again.

Breathing under siege,
oppressed by the dreams I have to feed.
Crushed by the flood, I won't let you go.

Born unwise,
seeking trust in a broken creed.
Crushed by the grey, I'm waiting for colour.
