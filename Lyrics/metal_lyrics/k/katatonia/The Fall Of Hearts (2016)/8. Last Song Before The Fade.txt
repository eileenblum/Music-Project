My memories like deleted film.
Awareness of this fire, kerosene.
Ignite the trial of my mind.

Above the horizon now,
upon the freezing tracks.
Grasp for the embers of my life.
You came back but so did I.

Who's in control?
Spite, so cold in this light.

Reflective summary froze me in a frame.
My time had run out before the future came.
Depart from insight, breach was made.

How could I ever forget our days?
I drown in silver, set to go.
Unafraid into the blue, blue waves.
Though I had hoped to hear your voice there.

Last song before the fade!

Who's in control?
Spite, so cold in this light.

Arise to other heights now!
Make me transcend into your still heart.
Beyond this world of stone,
let me surrender to the streams of nought.

Last song before the fade!

Sick days behind me now.
Winter wails through the chest.
Dim the lights as I pass, will be no harm.

Arise to other heights now!
Make me transcend into your still heart.
Beyond this world of stone,
let me surrender to the streams of nought.

Last song before the fade!
