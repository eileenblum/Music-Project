In the morning
The battle for endurance has been lost
Sold my worth and dignity the same
I am shade
And essence of corroding time

So pale next to my love
In every way
Meaningless scar
Through the evening
Where our wisdom turns to rust
Fill the gap with lost integrity
I become the one you haven't seen for years

Liberating rain
Two shots and I need more
Adapt to the flow
A taste of the void
Get back and focus again
More of the fire

It churns the blood
The waves of dependence
Await to be slain
By memories of old
It churns the blood
The waves of dependence
Await to be slain
By memories of old

In every way
Meaningless scar

I become the one you haven't seen for years

Liberating rain
Two shots and I need more
Adapt to the flow
A taste of the void
Get back and focus again
More of the fire
It churns the blood
The waves of dependence
Await to be slain
By memories of old
It churns the blood
The waves of dependence
Await to be slain
By memories of old
