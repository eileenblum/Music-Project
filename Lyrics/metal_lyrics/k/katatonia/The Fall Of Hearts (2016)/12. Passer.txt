You came in to my circle of trust, arriving late.
You could have done better, but it's okay!
Contemplating summer and what could have been.

Who knows?

But I fear you took the words from my drunken heart,
and they're vanishing with you.
Closing down, leaking my inactivated mind into you.

Memorial!
Let's put everything underground now.
Your void eyes!
How long until you come back around?

5 A.M., I'm fading!
Ghost on the pavement.
I celebrate futility within.
I am wretched, all colors blur to one.

You did well to make me believe!
It was a way to survive, to run a scar inside.

Ascend now, as your chain of rust has swayed me.
Observing dead air, so worn out.
Contemplating summer and what could have been.

Who knows?

But I fear you took the words from my drunken heart,
and they're vanishing with you.
Closing down, leaking my inactivated mind into you.

Memorial!
Let's put everything underground now.
Your void eyes!
How long until you come back around?

5 A.M., I'm fading!
Ghost on the pavement.
I celebrate futility within.
You did well to make me believe!
It was a way to survive.

You took your gear and hit the trail,
I was there by the runway.
Above spires and buildings now,
you have passed the horizon.

In time another star will rise, dissimulation.
On the wind comes the message now,
you have passed the horizon.
Divide like wings!
