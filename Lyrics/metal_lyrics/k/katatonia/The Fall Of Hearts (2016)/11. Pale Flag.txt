Our burden fell down,
once shared but waged war on my mind.
So told my love farewell now.
No loyalty to find.

When you vanish over the skies.
I am forsaken beneath the ground I lie.
Was banished from this hurtful life.
I am forlorn, all dreams have turned to strife.

Winter winds take flight,
circling over my grave.
A haunting voice amidst the trees,
rising up across the sea.

You vanish over the skies.
I am forsaken beneath the ground I lie.
Was banished from this hurtful life.
I am forlorn, all dreams have turned to strife.

You vanish over the skies.
Survival, it was destined for your name.
I am forsaken beneath the ground I lie.

Was banished from this hurtful life.
Compassion, brings you here when the rain falls on mine.
I am forlorn, all dreams have turned to strife.
