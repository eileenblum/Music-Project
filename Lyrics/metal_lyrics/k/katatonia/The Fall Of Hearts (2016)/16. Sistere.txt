You stay out here in the snow
All night beside the road
But there's fire so keep warm
I'm leaving soon
It's bleak
And inside you can't hold your thoughts together
The slumber within a dreamer of stars
In a house of ash and scars
So many miles apart
And all we see is white tonight

Goodnight lover, sleep well
I'll get you here
I'll call early tomorrow
It's time for allies to rise

Are you in baby
The sunset is shattering
Time waits for no one

A winter song inside the heart
Won't you hear me when I call
It's time for you and me to fall
