Spiraling nights in the void.
Weathered coat and a dagger.
If I dream back my youth I can still hear you sing.
A voice that will die on a mountain.

And I fear that I've stayed here just a little too long.

I had to go where you couldn't follow.
In my weariness I still hear you singing in my mind.

All the fortunes they took away!

The shifting earth beneath us.
Nothing to observe!
The clouds at our feet.
Nothing to observe!

The sun was made a jewel.
Nothing to observe!
When at night it did sleep.
Nothing to observe!

Cast in a trench of fire.
I can see the sky is a ceiling.
And when my heart dies down,
I am long gone on the fields of summer's green.
Away from fall and famine!

In my weariness I still hear you singing in my mind.
All the fortunes they took away!

The shifting earth beneath us.
Nothing to observe!
The clouds at our feet.
Nothing to observe!

The sun was made a jewel.
Nothing to observe!
When at night it did sleep.

I am in every season,
the one you have always known.
Life did not reward you!
So find your way to the river and let go.

The shifting earth beneath us.
Nothing to observe!
The clouds at our feet.
Nothing to observe!

The sun was made a jewel.
Nothing to observe!
When at night it did sleep.
Nothing to observe!
