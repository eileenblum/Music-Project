Rid my mind of residual thoughts,
until knowledge will arrive.
They closed my eyes,
and cold stars would align.

In the city the lights are many,
but I can't find it amusing anymore.
I watch the night unfold and vanish,
stood on the highway.

So hey,
let's celebrate, there's no need to cry.
No one can comfort you, there's no one around.

But baby,
Can you hear the sky blowing at night?
It's our wealth!

And I'm ready to go if you're already there.
Saw your trail in the snow,
did you find the way to freedom?

It's the last day I'm here,
can you hear the sky fall down?
Collapsing over ravaged ground!

The sickness rising,
the towering wall, going for the fire.
Found the signs of the road I was looking for.
Bend my desire and fade from their sight.

The dents is all that I had,
the tidings from our fading sun.
Made me wiser!

Take your time,
everyone will want to go:
Step by errant step!

Degraded my heart,
that's what you do when you have nothing more to find!
Degraded my heart,
that's what you do when you have nothing more to find!

The dents is all that I had,
the tidings from our fading sun.
Made me wiser!

But baby,

Saw your trail in the snow,
did you find the way to freedom?

It's the last day I'm here,
can you hear the sky fall down?
Collapsing over ravaged ground!
