Bring on salvation!
I have a way to find mine: I swallow light!
And what if I move, lapsing into failure.
In the lowering night, in the lowering night.

I had waited for you,
though I was certain you wouldn't come back, no.

Into the after hours!

Smudged my heart for all to see.
But it's so quiet now, makes it harder to shine.
Had a dream about tomorrow!
But with nothing more to think about, I fade out.

Bring on sedation!
I have waited a long time and dragged myself a long way.
There's a flight to MedellÃ­n, twelve hours of drinking gin.
Awakened by summer!

Sever the ties that were once unyielding.
Packed my money under night's neon curtain.

Smudged my heart for all to see.
But it's so quiet now, makes it harder to shine.
Had a dream about tomorrow!
But with nothing more to think about, I fade out.
