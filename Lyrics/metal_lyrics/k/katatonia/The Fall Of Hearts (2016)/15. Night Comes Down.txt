In the last rays
Of the setting sun
And the past days
That's where our memories run

And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Call me and I'll wait forever
For a love that's only good

As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

Oh no, you won't be there tomorrow
Oh no, say it isn't true
Can't take this pain and sorrow
Can't you see my heart is broken in two

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
