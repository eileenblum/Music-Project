O my, your fever is high
I lay my hands upon you
O my, haven't you heard
The truth is untrue?

Now I'm breathing
I could not breathe until you did
I'm one second after you
Now I'm breathing
I could not breathe until you did
Just a second after you

[2x]
Someone inside your room
Who is it there behind you?
What does he want from you?

Sleeper what did you see?
I close the window to the street
Parents died, left a child
Unattended for a while

Now I'm breathing
I could not breathe until you did
I'm one second after you
Now I'm breathing
I could not breathe until you did
Just a second after you

[2x]
Someone inside your room
Who is it there behind you?
What does he want from you?

Sleeper's song will you listen to me sing
The bird is here I can see the edge of his wing
If you die now how can I then live on?
Don't give up, you must live on

Sleeper's song will you listen to me sing
The bird is here I can see the edge of his wing

If you die now...
