under lights that never go out
we drive
and focus on the change
you become my face as I replace it
with the mirrors and the glass
and the houses that we pass

we drive all night
you've come a long way to find
emptiness
we hear it all night
see it flicker overhead
so void of life

in due time all of this will pass
in a sudden storm
when you take my hand
so cold this april
don't you think
we call on the void
the void will answer us
