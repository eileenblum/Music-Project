[written by Will Oldham, published by royal stable music (ascap)]

it's us i liken to a covey
a polar bear has breached a
pup
the palace walls are 
strewn with tapestries
and the window panes are
splintered and shattered
with a crumbled dog 
on every landing
and every stranger cowers
the dress is torn,
the tone demanding
the canine's latent strength

and would her loins 
would yield a yelp
a beating purr to steal the
time with
here's where we walk, 
hand in hand
o how i despise it
o how i enjoy the light
of the first morning forever
wisdom, wealth tag 
on like afterbirth
i will love you forever

and if i don't 
and if i do
the difference exists in a
fiction
the day has cooled, 
the time will too
and we will call upon the light
