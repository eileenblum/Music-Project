to completely dissolve, 
what method is used 
i cannot sleep, 
my hands are bruised
there's a hole in the wall, 
torn up anew 
one dead eye, 
the colour of you

to vanish for life 
and promise to stay 
away from the knowing, 
bird in a cage
i'd give so much 
for the courage to go
if i ask for your help, 
then you will know

so help me disappear
or to believe in a change
no way out of here
that i can see
or the nightmares that burn
into my head at night
make them disappear
so i can breathe

looked out the window twice, 
just to be sure
that noone was standing 
outside the door
but it's just as calm 
as it was before
they're all gone now, 
not there anymore

isolated myself 
for the sake of freedom
i clenched my fist 
for the sake of kindness
i read a book full of strange
words
loneliness is a disease
