At city centre 9 pm
Just like you wrote
And i try to think about
Snow coming in
Just like before
I will be on stand-by

Releasing the vapour
Into the lung
Letting the wings unfurl
And for a moment i feel young
I call on the bird
Unfurl

Itâs time to chose side now
Thatâs what you said
When we talked on the phone
So white our eyes
You are still
Are you paralyzed
