False
The dream is so far
Come and take the consequence
Few things are as certain
Oppressive wait

Evacuate
Assemble here
Soil's song
In you throat
Future death
In your reach
Who's first
OK

Mask
Your face well hidden
Keep your last words in your hand
Fold it and open up
Time to go
Release the glow
