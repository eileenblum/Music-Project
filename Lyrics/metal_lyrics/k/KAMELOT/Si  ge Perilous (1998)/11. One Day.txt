[Bonus Track]Can you remember the morning I told you goodbye,
Just when a new was dawning a piece of me died...

somehow I have to try to
getting used to being alone
If I could only hold you once again
I'd never let go

save me a prayer
when day turns to night

lord won't you
show me the light
one day - I'll find back to my heart and soul again
one day - I swear swear by your name

memories keep me awake
and you're there by my side
I wonder if its only in my mind
that I am alive

save me a prayer
when day turns to night
lord won't you
tell me I'm right

one day - I'll find back to my heart and soul again
one day - I swear swear by your name
