I've been witness to so many wars
that I'm blind to affliction
no ability left to remorse
it's my faith and conviction
wide awake
in this world
full of hate
I unfurl

but I am damned
if life itself is condemnation
I am immortal
thus my freedom is captivity
flying all across the highlands
searching for a way
to finalize my history
rising high above the mountains
reaching for the sky
closer to my sanctuary

all my life I've been trying to die
reach complete segregation
I am ready to open my eyes
to a new revelation

lost in time
there's no place
for my soul
in his embrace

for I am damned
if life itself is condemnation
I am immortal
thus my freedom is captivity
bound to live eternally

However; the line thus my freedom is captivity is incorrect.
the correct line for the second and third time they sing this
bridge is:

I am immortal
and I can't escape my destiny.
Bound to live eternally
