[Vinyl Bonus Track]Breathe...
Help me breathe
I'm shoulder deep in water

Use...
Use me like you want
'Cause I just wanna feel

Another drop
As time goes by
I wait for you

If we lose this moment
How will we ever know
If someone can define our pain?
If we stay in silence
And wait another night
This chance will be forever lost
At first light

If we only had a minute more
Would you waste it here beside me
Or keep it to yourself?

I throw myself down at your feet
And every day I die a little more
For I just wanna feel!

Another drop
As time goes by
I wait for you

If we lose this moment
How will we ever know
If someone can define our pain?
If we stay in silence
And wait another night
This chance will be forever lost
At first light
