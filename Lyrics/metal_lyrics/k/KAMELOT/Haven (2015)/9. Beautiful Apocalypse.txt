Gravity is pulling me
And I donât really wanna be
A child of desolation anymore
My inner world is quaking
So tired of my trivial self
A paradise corrupted to the core
Standing on the edgeâ¦

Something old and
Something new
Something borrowed
Something blue
Itâs time for us to celebrate
Our beautiful apocalypse

Always know that you are not aloneâ¦
Take my hand
My gutter child adventure
Iâll take you where the lovers go to sleep
My borderline affection
Now close your eyes, donât be afraid
Youâre not aloneâ¦

Tumbling in the multitude
On our way to new horizons
Drowning in a mass of refugees
Liberation in demise
Revolution in disguise
Failing to survive these battlefields
Weâre standing on the edge

Something old and
Something new
Something borrowed
Something blue
Itâs time for us to celebrate
Our beautiful apocalypse

Always know that you are not aloneâ¦
Take my hand
My gutter child adventure
Iâll take you where the lovers go to sleep
My borderline affection
Now close your eyes, donât be afraid
Youâre not aloneâ¦

You are not aloneâ¦
My gutter child adventure
You are not alone
Iâll take you where the lovers go to sleep
My borderline affection
Cause you are not alone

Take my hand
My gutter child adventure
Iâll take you to a place where lovers leap
Now close your eyes, donât be afraid
Youâre not aloneâ¦
