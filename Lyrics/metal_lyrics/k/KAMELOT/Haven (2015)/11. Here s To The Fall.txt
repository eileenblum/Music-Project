I am your god
Tell me whatâs on your mind
My demons are haunting me
Eating me alive
I fear the unknown
The darkness before me
Will we ever start anew
Wait and you will seeâ¦

Hereâs to the fall
The fall of us all
Are we nothing but leaves in the wind?
Hereâs to the fall
Hereâs to the darkness to come for us all
Turning day into night

When Iâm weak in my faith
Will you still believe in me?
My cynical imagery
Feeds my disbelief
And when Iâm lost in the dark
Will you still save me?
God why wonât you answer meâ¦
What is left to see?

Hereâs to the fall
The fall of us all
Are we nothing but leaves in the wind?
Hereâs to the fall
Hereâs to the darkness to come for us all
Turning day into night

Help me to see
Through your masquerade like
Perfect disguise
Open my eyes
Help me to see
Hereâs to the coming fallâ¦

Hereâs to the fall
The fall of us all
Are we nothing but leaves in the wind?
Hereâs to the fall
Hereâs to the darkness to come for us all
Turning day into night
May our souls surviveâ¦
