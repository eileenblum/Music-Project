You are my reason to stay
Even if daylightâs a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Sometimes the weight of the worldâs
Coming over me
A feeling I canât forget
Sometimes I find myself caught in a storm
And my futureâs a nightmare away
When Iâm dreaming

Sometimes I fear
I am losing your sympathies
A liar demands respect
Sometimes I fell I am losing control
And feed on the absence of love

Walking this world like animals
And into the light weâre fading

You are my reason to stay
Even if daylightâs a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Sometimes Iâm lost in the silence of empathy
A moment I canât reflect
Sometimes I feel like Iâm loosing control
And feed on the essence of hate

Walking this world like animals
And into the dark weâre wading

You are my reason to stay
Even if daylightâs a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Somewhere in time
A story seldom told
Somewhere in history
Our destiny beholdâ¦

In the dead of the night Iâm just a corpse
Awoken the enemy sleeping inside
In the eye of the storm weâre just the same

'cause you are my reason to stay
Even if daylightâs a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven
My song for the lost
My song for the children unforgiven
