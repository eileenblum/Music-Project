Tell me do you remember
The games and the laughter
Far from the choices weâd have to make
A kiss on the lips
Turned the toad to a prince
And the end was a lifetime away

I pour myself onto this page
I am writing a swan song for ages
I will leave it behind
And just maybe you will
Remember meâ¦

Itâs the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence

Now itâs me and my knife
And the will is my temple
Numb from the choices I have to make
Slowly we all took a bite of the apple
And laughterâs a lifetime away
Remember meâ¦

I pour myself onto this page
I am writing a swan song for ages
I will leave it behind
And just maybe you will
Remember meâ¦

Itâs the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence

Of innocenceâ¦
Where do we go from hereâ¦?

Itâs the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence
