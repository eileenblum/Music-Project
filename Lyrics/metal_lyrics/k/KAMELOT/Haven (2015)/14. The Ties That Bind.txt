[Japanese Bonus Track]Resurrection in a life beyond the black
I am not afraid
I know what I must do
Preparation for the harvest of my deeds
There is no looking back
Salvation isnât free

Before my eyes a world benign
I stand to protect what is mine

Word by word and line by line
I follow your voice through the fire
And nothing will disarm my mind
To cut the ties that bind

Jurisdiction to enforce the only truth
And when I say your name
Forgiveness is for meâ¦

Appear before my feverish eyes
I trust you to lead when Iâm blind

Word by word and line by line
I follow your voice through the fire
And nothing will disarm my mind
To cut the ties that bind

I have sold my soul
Hesitationâs for the weak
Iâm your faithful tool
Dispose of me as you wish
I say your name again and put my blame aside
And I tell myself the end
Will justify my selfish meansâ¦

Word by word and line by line
I follow your voice through the fire
And nothing will disarm my mind
To cut the ties that bind
Cause no one can disarm my mind
To cut the ties that bind
