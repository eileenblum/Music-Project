Pull the trigger now
If you're craving a hero
Or say life after death
Was it you or was it me
Who had to fake
Implementation
Of a lonely heart
So warm and oh so weak

My fractured eyes
In the mold below
The fattest lies
Hold your needs

Wait for the morning
Come a different day
Carry the weight of all
You say is wrong
We would both deny
There is a secret fate
A seal of woven years
Of waiting flying by

Rush my head
Into your wall of complaints
And crush me softly
Like you crushed yourself asunder
You better leave me be

Now go
My soul was sold
For a rainy day
But it's not too late
For a full retreat
Â 
Wait for the morning
Come a different day
Carry the weight of all
You say is wrong
We would both deny
There is a secret fate
A seal of woven years
Of waiting flying by
Â
