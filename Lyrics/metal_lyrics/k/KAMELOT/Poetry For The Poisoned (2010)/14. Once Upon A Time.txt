I am scorn in this heavenly scheme
With a stench of destruction
I'm a reaper of beautiful dreams
And she knows
I'm on the edge
Sacrilege

Push me over

Tell me once upon a time
I close my eyes
And see myself reborn
Righting the wrong
I won't stay to stand in line
Or wait for God to shine all over me
I wait for the storm

I am you
And know that you heard
You and I are the last
At the end of the world
Then we talk
And we run
And we hide
Then so what
The human race
Suffocates

Leave me breathless

Tell me once upon a time
I close my eyes
And see myself reborn
Righting the wrong
I won't stay to stand in line
Or wait for God to shine all over me
I wait for the storm

Move along
Through the ashes of a dream
Move along
And see myself anew again
