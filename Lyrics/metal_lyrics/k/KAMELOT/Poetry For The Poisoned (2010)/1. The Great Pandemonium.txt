War, war, war, war, war, war, war...
On a silent shore
I spoke to God
The sun is down
Assemble the great pandemonium
War

One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create

And my eyes sweep a shore
that was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

One more, just one more
Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I had to sell
One last trick that you can't debate

War

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to God
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium

[Growls:]
Red light
Put the breaks down
Red light
Put the breaks down

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to God
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium

Just one, just one, just one more day
Just one, just one, just one more day
Just one, just one more
War
