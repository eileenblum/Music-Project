There was a time when I was young
A boy with bold ambitions
There was a time when I could tell the crooked from the wicked one

There was a song that someone sung
A hint of recognition
There was a time I knew you well enough to know you won't be gone

[Chorus:] Come with me tonight

Tell me how it feels to be alive

There was a time I had respect
A name of reputation
There was a time when I could watch myself without being disgraced

[Chorus:] Come with me tonight

Let us find a place where we can hide

[Chorus:] Come into the light

Let me show you how we stay alive

[Instrumental]

The word "incubus" means "to lie on", and it was believed that any feeling in bed, such as a weight pressing down on your chest, especially accompanied by nightmares, was a sure sign that an incubus had attempted to have a nocturnal intercourse with you.
Given the religious fervour of the Middle Ages, it is not altogether surprising that the idea of a demon lover was believed to account of this phenomenon.
