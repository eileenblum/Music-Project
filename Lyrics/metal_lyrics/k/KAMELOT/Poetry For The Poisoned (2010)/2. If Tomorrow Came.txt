I'm not sure
If she could ease your pain
You've been gone for awhile
Crushed you heart and soul
And teased your bane
Hush your mouth
Here she comes
Watch out

She can see you
Like the hounds of Hell
Smell your fear when you flee
Here she comes
Velvet ocean paradise
The power sorceress
At your fingertips
God made flesh
Perfect Alibi

You saw her walking
Over poison ivy leaves
Nobody knows her name
But something must have
Opened your eyes it seems
Cause nothing is quite the same

I'm not sure about a thing
You know
Days are long in the haze
Here she comes
Velvet ocean paradise
the power sorceress
Get a glimpse of God
Here she comes
With her good advice

You wanted every single moment
You've resigned
Knowing there's none to blame
You might as well
I swear on my life you tried
As if tomorrow came

Searching in the deepest forest
Merging with belief you saw her
All you've seen and all you've known
Tells you that she kept you warm
