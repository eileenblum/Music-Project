A minute more
'Til the light of day is seen
Lay down
I know you must be nearly there
A bloody kiss
And the vision of a dream
For the last of your days in the sun

In the white light I am calm
Yet peculiarly cold
Silent slumber
And wide awake
Lord have mercy on my soul

So long
Your sorrow be gone
(Show me how it feels to be alive)
No more denial
So long
(Let us find a place where we can hide)

You fed me long
And by God you fed me well
Sleep tight
This day belongs to you my dear
And I am bound
Like a beast onto its prey
We are one of a kind you and I

Pale moon wander
I'm wide awake
Lord have mercy on my soul

So long
Your sorrow be gone
(Show me how it feels to be alive)
No more denial
So long
(Show me all the splendors of the night)

So long
The little last of your attention
Sorrow
This flood to wash your mind
See me
The God of your imagination
Feel me
Come with me tonight

So long
Your sorrow be gone
Show me how it feels to be alive
No more denial
So long
