She was so kind to me
She sang her little shadow song
And I could not resist it
Bitter blood, come sing along

With your hand upon the bible
Would you swear that is the truth?
(The whole truth and the truth alone)

If she had only shut her mouth

Shattered memories of quiet cold rejection
A careful devil's irony in pure perfection
In pure deceit

You ask me
Was it all I had to tell?
Was it all I could recall?

Know that I broke her neck
A twisted china white visage
I may seem unaffected
But don't we all want to be god?

Is it all you can remember?
Would you swear it on your life?

You will never really know my name without reflection
A careful devil's irony in pure perfection
In pure deceit

But in the moment it's so beautiful
Flow along with a hunger
With the nature of the beast

These are shattered memories of quiet cold rejection
A careful devil's irony in pure perfection
You will never really know my name without reflection
A careful devil's irony in pure perfection
In pure deceit
