[music: youngblood, lyrics: Warner]

Look towards the sea,
Tell me what do you see?
Will you know what it is when you've found it?

You searched high above and you searched far below
But it still seems so far and you know it

Time - It dwindles away
There's a clock on the wall
And it seems that is calling your name
But you can't run away
He'll be right there behind you
Reminding you it's not a game

I will conquer the beast and I'll swim the seven seas
And my heart will still beat and I'll never give up
I will walk desert plains and endure gruelling pain
And my heart will still beat and I'll never give up

Heaven is a heartbeat away for your dreams of
Tomorrow could end today
Heaven is a heartbeat away for your dreams of
Tomorrow could end today.
