[music: youngblood, lyrics: Warner]

Heat from the ground feeds the fire
My desire to live with this rage
With thoughts of you filling my nights
And my days...

Sounds of the speaking of tongues
Visions of circles undone
Keeps this heart of mine beating
For the time of our meeting will come

Now, I turn to the gods
Whichever will listen
From below or above

Hear my cry,
Feel my pain
If I should fall,
I'll start over again

Hear my cry,
Feel my pain
If I should die,
I will rise again

I scream to the sky full of anger
My body increasingly weaker

[SOLO]

I won't die for you
I won't die for you
Heaven is a heartbeat away

Hear my cry,
Feel my pain
If I should fall,
I'll start over again

Hear my cry,
Feel my pain
If I should Die,
I will rise again.
