Let me play a melody for you
While searching for the light
And a way to live forever

Your flaws make sure you never contemplate
And see the consequence
Of trying to survive

[BRIDGE:]
Like the shadows in my head
You will play that ghost again
(Do you think salvation waits for you?)
As I lay you down to sleep
All your tears are mine to keep

[CHORUS:]
Falling like the Fahrenheit
Someone will always lose
You will never see another sunrise
My cyanide in paradise
That someone's always there
And I will never see another sundown in your eyes

Let me share a memory with you
Imprisoned in the sound
Let us dream away together
Every single note is bound to send
A flower from this world to whither with a smile

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

Give me a sign
To take what is righteously mine

Give me the secrets that you keep
I'll save them for no one else to see

[CHORUS]
