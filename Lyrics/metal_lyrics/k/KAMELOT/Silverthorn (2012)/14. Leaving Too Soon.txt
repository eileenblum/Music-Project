[Japanese/Korean Bonus Track]Close your eyes and count to ten
I dare you
I will catch your fall
It takes a dreamer to believe

Make a wish and take a stand
I promise the world to you
The sun will paint your face with gold

Saying you don't have to live afraid

Because we're all leaving too soon
In a moment of sobriety we learn to see
We are not meant to stay for eternity
Don't use the time you have to dream away

Weigh the future in your hand
Tomorrow, today has gone to sleep
Only to wake up yesterday

Cross the borders of your land
The soil beneath will crumble
The sun will light the fire in your eyes again

Saying you don't have to die afraid

Because we're all leaving too soon
In a moment of sobriety we learn to see
We are not meant to stay for eternity
Don't use the time you have to dream away

Because we're all leaving too soon
In a moment of sobriety we learn
We are not meant to stay for eternity
So use the life you have to live your dream
