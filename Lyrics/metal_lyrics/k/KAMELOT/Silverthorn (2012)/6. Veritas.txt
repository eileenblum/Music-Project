In the mirror my reflection lies to me
That is not the man I want to see
But every harvest takes me closer to my aim
I will be there as soon as darkness falls
My life is but a heartbeat away
And all you've ever had will soon belong to me

[Chorus:]
(In morte ultima veritas)
You will kneel before me
And you will confess that I'm god
(Vincit veritas in omni re)
Send me your prayers
But death is the answer to life

While you're weeping, feed my anger I stay calm
'Cause I'm sure that you won't let me down
Fading gently to the sound I can't forget
And don't you know that when the music dies
My life is but a heartbeat away
And all you've ever had will soon belong to me

[Chorus]

(So short but innocent
It always will remain
And all I know is
It was good
My childhood memories
And I was blessed to live)

(Please, please let it die
Or brother this is my last goodbye
I'm begging you)

[Chorus]
