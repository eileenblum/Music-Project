There's a shadow in the cold white light of day
I hope that someday you'll forgive and set me free

While standing in the pale white light, Jolee is lost
I wrote a letter to the angels to follow me into the light again.

Underneath the velvet letters of my heart
Always will remind me that I'm hurt and sad

[Chorus:]
I'm sorry but I can't stop the bleeding
Crying and it's all because of you.
One look in the mirror to see
What's real and fake, Jolee.

There's a princess captured in a wooden frame.
I'd trade eternity for one last look at you.

Not playing by the rules
We played the game of loss.
I'll keep on writing to the angels so you're safe 'til the moment we meet again.

Underneath the make-up the scars that sear my heart,
Unspeakable reminder that I'm hurt and sad

[Chorus]
I'm sorry but I can't stop the bleeding
Crying and it's all because of you.
One look in the mirror to see,
What's real and fake, Jolee.

I'm sorry but I can't stop the bleeding
Crying and it's all because of you.
One look in the mirror to see,Â  what's real and fake,
Â 
Jolee.

Oh.
One look in the mirror to see, what's real and fake, Jolee.
