[Part I: Funerale]

Essence of beauty
Taken to soon
Princess of hope
Deep in our hearts you live on

Essence of goodness
Goddess of light
Give us the power
God gave us strength to live on

[Part II: Burden of Guilt]

(How could this happen
What have we done)

How could this happen?
Oh, what have we done?
Will our tears ever pay for our sin?
Mother forgive us
We need all your love
To fight and to carry the burden of shame

Hereby we swear that for as long as we live
We will not soil our name
The truth made of iron
Will see it with pain until death
Our secret remains
Until death our love remains
And in death our love re-framed

I need a way
But worlds unwind
Lovers in blood
Now divided in heart

[Part III: The Journey]

My grief and sorrow always trying
To repay
Behind the palisade
This is destined life
Music and the tears I hear you say
Through the walls
Turns to nightmares and there's no escape at all

Oh joyful childhood
You died so young

Every child follows blind
On the journey we call life
Learn it every day
Given love or given name
Determines everybody's fate in life
Be careful what you give

Stranger to love and affection
On the run
In search of shelter in the solitude of sin
A drifter in the dark
A soldier of the pain
A constant slave under the belt of misery

Oh joyful childhood
You died so young

Every child follows blind
On the journey we call life
Learn it every day
Given love or given name
Determines everybody's fate in life
Be careful what you give
