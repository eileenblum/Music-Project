Like a pendant on the neck of a queen
Ten thousand scars, an embrace of the stone
As we dance on a steady canopy
Accuse me, fool me, take all my pain away
My friend singing my final song of honor
Betrayed but still I never came around to open my mind

[Chorus:]
I was torn by the storms in my head
Like a victim of fate
Born to regret
Still denied by the spirits of hell
A call to repent
'Til the visions still stand in silence like a shadow

Like a martyr that is nowhere to be seen
Ten thousand stars I've prayed for (have prayed for the calm)
As we drift on this neverending sea
Clear me, keep me, take all my pain away, my friend
Singing my final song of glory
Betrayed but still I finally came around and opened my eyes

[Chorus:]
I was torn by the storms in my head
Like a victim of fate
Born to regret
Still denied by the spirits of hell
A call to repent
'Til the visions still stand in silence like a shadow
Like a shadow

[Solo]

Torn by the thorns in my head
Like a victim of violence
A call to repent
Denied by the spirits of heaven
Take me up again to the music of dawn

[Chorus:]
I was torn by the storms in my head
Like a victim of fate
Born to regret
Still denied by the spirits of hell
A call to repent
'Til the visions still stand like a shadow
