[Limited Box Edition Bonus Track]Watch me passing through
Your odd dimension
Youâre standing there
Carrying the cross that I gave

Iâm a northern light
The stars above you
I whisper your name
Oh, feeling strange

Youâre falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
Itâs not over
Youâre falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
Itâs not over

Come and breathe inside
My celestial sphere
Feel the rush in your fragile flesh

I can feel your anxiety
Restless mind
Searching for love to embrace

Youâre falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
Itâs not over
Youâre falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
Itâs not over

Donât despise me
I am the truth
Donât be indifferent
You wonât be condemned
Will I ever reach you
If I open my arms
You lose, you die
Turning my heart into stone

Youâre falling down from grace
Youâre feeling kinda strange
Itâs not over
Youâre falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
Itâs not over
