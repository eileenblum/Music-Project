Give me a sign
Sing the words of innocence
And broken pride
Make my conclusions fail

Send me a sign
Hear this broken melody
'Cause each night i die
In hell

[CHORUS:]
My god has shown his sympathy
For all the spirits lost
I'll pray for salvation
And peace for ages
Standing in the summer breeze
Inhaling life again
A new day has come
A chance to relive
Forget and forgive

Somehow I wasted all
They sealed my voice and wisdom
But my soul was born
On the battleground

Justice and blood
Long awaited fix of me
And tonight you die
In hell

[CHORUS]

I bind my eyes
Inside my mind
We're bound together
This is my confession
So may your enemy
Alone in my religion
Release my heart
Unfold my tongue

Save a place for me in heaven
We'll meet another day
I found forgiveness
And the meaning of it all
My fear is gone
Gone

[CHORUS]

Forget and forgive
