On a dim December morning
A glass of "I forgot the name"
I can't turn wine to water
I won't come back again

And the minutes turn to hours
I keep spinning cards that look the same
And I so await the moment...
To talk to you

Please shine oh night my dear, embrace me

It's time again,
All light is banned
My soul is free
And blessed to see

[CHORUS:]
Sometimes when I'm out of reach
And sometimes when I'm there
That is when our souls agree and join in solitaire
Sometimes when my will to love has gone away
That is when I hear your name

Now the pale sunlight is blinding
It's here to claim my sanity
And I just can't stand the waiting...
To revive ecstasy

Please shine oh night my dear, embrace me

It's time again
All light is banned
My soul is free
And blessed to see

[CHORUS]

I won't sustain another day
My love, my darkness
Daylight reflects my starving soul
And open wounds for everyone to see

[CHORUS 2x]

I want to hear your name
Hear your name
