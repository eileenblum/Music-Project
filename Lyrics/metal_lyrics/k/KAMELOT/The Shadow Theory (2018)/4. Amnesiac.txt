Say my name,
no beautifying filters.
I'm craving that honest pain!

These perfect lines
are always out of place.
Only you and I were born
to break the chain.

Caught in the framework,
dying to belong.
Escape the wasteland,
don't forget who you are.

Amnesiac!

Don't let the world
revolve around you,
don't wait another day
to re-erase your memory.

Amnesiac!

Don't let the dream
dissolve without you.
The more you know,
the more they hold you back.

Amnesiac!

Mortal peace
pushing through a needle,
observing your every move.

A thousand lies
to avoid the question why
Because the more you know,
The more they hold you back.

Caught in the framework,
dying to belong.
Escape the wasteland,
don't forget who you are.

Amnesiac!

Don't let the world
revolve around you,
don't wait another day
to re-erase your memory.

Amnesiac!

Don't let the dream
dissolve without you.
The more you know,
the more they hold you back.

Amnesiac!

No beautifying filters
beyond the perfect lines,
this effortless intrusion.
Stop, erase, rewind!

Amnesiac!
Escape the wasteland,
don't forget who you are.

Amnesiac!

Don't let the world
revolve around you,
don't wait another day
to re-erase your memory.

Amnesiac!

Don't let the dream
dissolve without you.
The more you know,
the more they hold you back.

Amnesiac!
