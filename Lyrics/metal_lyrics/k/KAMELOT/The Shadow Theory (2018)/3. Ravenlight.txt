Silent tears
in a sea of sorrow.
If only God would talk to me
and promise me tomorrow.

Drowning in myself as
I am facing imperfection.
But the pain makes me feel
I am still alive.

In Ravenlight you came to me,
from silence rose a symphony
of coming winters white.

Paralysed,
caught in desperation.
Endless nights revisiting
internal conversations.

Finally I made my peace
with self intoxication.
So I bleed just to know
I am not alone.

In Ravenlight you came to me,
from silence rose a symphony
of coming winters white.

May light embrace
the darkest hour.
Let it shine to orchestrate
the shadows of the night.

In Ravenlight you came to me,
from silence rose a symphony
of coming winters white.

I love the way you sing to me,
from silence to a soaring symphony.
My rose in winter white!
