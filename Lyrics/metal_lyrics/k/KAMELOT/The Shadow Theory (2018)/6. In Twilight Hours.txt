Tell me, tell me God,
what is left here for me?
Iâm a ghost in the window,
oh God set me free!

And in twilight hours
I await forgiveness
that never comes.

In an ocean deep,
on a river wild,
the water pulls me down,
never to be found again.

You never really know...
How could I know?
How many tears you own.
Until the day they were gone!

Gone without a trace
until the day fall anew.
Fall anew...

Tell me, tell me God,
what is left here for me?
Iâm a ghost in the window,
Oh God set me free!

And in twilight hours
I await forgiveness
that never comes.

Out there in the cold,
remember me!
Along the broken
road of reveries.

When youâre
rising from the dead,
reviving from the dust again.

Like in a winterstorm...
Iâll cover you!
Iâm burning in the cold...
Iâll keep you warm!

But I know Iâm not alone
as long as I believe in you!

Tell me, tell me why,
share your burden with me.
Youâre the ghost in the window
and Iâll set you free.

When in twilight hours
you await forgiveness
that never comes.

Tell me, tell me God,
what is left here for me?
Iâm a ghost in the window,
Oh God set me free!

And in twilight hours
I await forgiveness
that never comes.

Forgiveness will
come for you!
