I am all you ever wanted,
I'm a new dimension.
Immortality perfected,
phantomized.

Expansion of life!

Generation of light,
finding every deviation
just to keep the future alive.

Under a phantom divine,
touched by the light
in ambrosial grace.

No applause for the old pantomime!
In the shadows of our dreams,
a phantom divine.

I'm the face of the selected,
I'm your chain reaction.
I am mortally rejected,
I am the empire.

Connecting the mind,
and I'll die just
to keep you alive.

Under a phantom divine,
touched by the light
in ambrosial grace.

No applause for the old pantomime!
In the shadows of our dreams,
a phantom divine.

Under a phantom divine,
touched by the light
in ambrosial grace.

No applause for the old pantomime!
In the shadows of our dreams,
a phantom divine.

There is still hope for you,
I am the empire.
All that you see is true,
I am the empire.

There is still hope for us
under a phantom divine.

Under a phantom divine,
touched by the light
in ambrosial grace.

No applause for the old pantomime!
Like impulses of our dreams,
a phantom divine.

Under a phantom divine,
touched by the light
in ambrosial grace.

No applause for the old pantomime!
In the shadows of our dreams,
a phantom divine.

I am the empire...
