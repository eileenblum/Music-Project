In the dark again
that borders to the
old imagination,
the inside of my soul.

Once again lost, my friend.
So ashamed of what I've done!

All alone again
with nothing but the
silent voices screaming
from the dark side of my heart.

Once again there, my friend.
Where my fears are torn apart!

Talk to me,
because the shadows
won't stop haunting me.

Talk to me,
stay by my side
to the bitter end!

What if we fade
like the midnight sun?
In the last rays of darkness
a journey begun.

What if we fall
like the April rain?
When the last day of sunlight
swept the pain away.

Reaching in again
to the void that I
so carefully protected.
Imaginary friend!

Out of reach, safe from harm.
My shell within a shell!

Talk to me,
because the shadows
won't stop haunting me.

Talk to me,
stay by my side
to the bitter end!

What if we fade
like the midnight sun?
In the last rays of darkness
a journey begun.

What if we fall
like the April rain?
When the last day of sunlight
swept the pain away.

Talk to me,
because the shadows
won't stop haunting me.

Talk to me,
stay by my side
to the bitter end!

What if we fade
like the midnight sun?
In the last rays of darkness
a journey begun.

What if we fall
like the April rain?
When the last day of sunlight
swept the pain away.

What if we fade
like the midnight sun?
In the last rays of darkness
a journey begun.

What if we fall
like the April rain?
When the last day of sunlight
swept the pain away.
