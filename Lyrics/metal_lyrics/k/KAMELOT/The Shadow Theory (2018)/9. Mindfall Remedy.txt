When youâre trapped
in your doubt and anger,
and youâre wailing along
like you relish the fail.

When your life
turns to be deception,
and youâre scratching
the walls on your cell.

Each step requires mad devotion!

No one else will catch you,
only you possess the key.
Mindfall remedy!

All those rules
were dissembling a future,
and you feel like you
burn in emotional Hell.

With the absence
of love and compassion,
every stone is a mountain high.

Each step requires mad devotion!

Mindfall Remedy!
No one else will catch you,
only you possess the key.
Mindfall remedy!

I feel my tower crumbling
With my resistance low.
Iâm living in a vacuum,
Iâm falling to the core.

In the core of resistance,
to face my inner self,
lies the key to my existence
to help myself.

Mindfall Remedy!
No one else will catch you,
only you possess the key.
Mindfall remedy!
