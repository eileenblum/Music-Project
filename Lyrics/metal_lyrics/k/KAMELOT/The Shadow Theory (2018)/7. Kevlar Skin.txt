When fatal thoughts in winding sense
strive to go past the terminal line,
is it cruel to ease the pain
of those who seek redemption?

Dare I take a leap of faith
knowing my fears will materialize?
I lay myself down at your grace,
in stillness I surrender.

Because underneath this kevlar skin
I am waiting for you to uncover me.
And in this armoured prison cell
I'm hiding my scars.
Come discover me!

Tell me what is pain if not just fear,
saying goodbye to a poisonous mind.
I let it hurt and hope that you
will be my soul's salvation.

Because underneath this kevlar skin
I am waiting for you to uncover me.
And in this armoured prison cell
I'm hiding my scars.
Come discover me!

My solitude, a loyal friend,
you kept my darkest secret.
And guarded my monotonous immortality,
keeping the fire away!

Because underneath this kevlar skin
I am waiting for you to uncover me.
And in this armoured prison cell
I'm hiding my scars.
Come discover me...
