Welcome in, Iâll walk you
through the unknown.
Say a prayer if you wish.

In my hand all of the
answers to your nightmares,
just let go of your
broken dreams.

Let the journey begin
like a leaf in the wind.
Youâll be taken away to
a world of visions unseen.

Imagine if far beyond the set horizon,
nothing can turn into everything.
But hurry before itâs too late
and the old Ballerina takes her fall.

Let me show you a place
where the blind can see
the light of a shooting star.

Like a dancer up high
on a silver string,
let your actions
define who you are.

Tell the stories unheard!

Follow me,
Iâll take you
to the unknown.
Discover me, let me in.

Please honor me with the
choices youâve been given,
remember me when my
breath is cold.

As the journey begins,
let the stories you
tell be your own.

Let me show you a place
where the blind can see
the light of a shooting star.

Like a dancer up high
on a silver string,
let your actions
define who you are.

Tell the stories unheard!

Though I love you
Iâll leave you forever,
praise the time I was here.

Celebrate all
our chapter together,
have no fear when Iâm gone.

Let me show you a place
where the blind can see
the light of a shooting star.

Like a dancer up high
on a silver string,
let your actions
define who you are.

Tell the stories unheard!
