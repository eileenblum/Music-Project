We teach them to pretend
not to break the line,
to always look away
and never ask why.

We sit beside the cradle,
we tell them to be brave,
but when the warning sounds
it echoes to the grave.

We keep blindly moving
along the same old path,
no common sense would
guide us back to life.

Now look at us,
the pinnacle conception.
How we assumed
these walls would never fall.

Sleep!
Farewell forever, child.
Farewell!

We are the last to walk the earth
and watch the passing ages slowly sail.
How it burns to embrace
that, below the lilac skies,
Eternity is just a breath away.

In lockstep to damnation,
to our dying breath,
every reckless footprint
leaves the smell of death.

On the wilting meadows
we let them out to play.
We said "No need to worry",
now they never may.

Sleep,
farewell forever!

We are the last to walk the earth
and watch the passing ages slowly sail.
How it burns to embrace
that, below the lilac skies,
Eternity is just a breath away.

Sleep,
farewell forever!

We are the last to walk the earth
and watch the passing ages slowly sail.
How it burns to embrace
that, below the lilac skies,
Eternity is just a breath away...
