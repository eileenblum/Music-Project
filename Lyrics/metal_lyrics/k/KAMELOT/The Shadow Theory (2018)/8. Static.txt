Stay until the morning
light reveals my ruins.
I was starving, now I hunger to feel
and let your curiosity dismantle me.

Now I just need your breath
like a veil upon my skin.

Come lay with me,
this chemistry is static.
Like space debris
we're perfectly chaotic.

So come and merge
your storm with mine
and save me.

Stay, hold me as
I'm trying to survive
and wrap me in your comfort.
My fears, I give them all to you
to keep them safe for me.

Because I just need your breath
like a veil upon my skin.

Come lay with me,
this chemistry is static.
Like space debris
we're perfectly chaotic.

So come and merge
your storm with mine
and save me.
