She wrote down this line on the barren wall
to not forget her trail of dreams.
But through the haze of her fevered pain
her thoughts were hard to understand.

Born without a name on the darkest day,
her future was already written.
As fantasies turned to poems on the stone,
the world began to come alive.

She made me smile
though years passed by.

Come day, come night,
my crimson bride is dancing
on fields of gold.
This scenery will never fail
in my dreaming mind.

Dreaming mind!

All through these days
I have held your hand,
we never left the velvet cage.

Vespertine,
our memories relive.
My irresistible demise!

She made me smile
though years passed by.

Come day, come night,
my crimson bride is dancing
on fields of gold.
This scenery will never fail
in my dreaming mind.

Vague are the images around me,
and old is the color of the night!

She made me smile
though years passed by.

Come day, come night,
my crimson bride is dancing
on fields of gold.
This scenery will never fail
in my dreaming mind.

Dreaming mind!
