You know just who I am
Don't be so distant
Cause when you're lost
I am solely there to share your grief

Wailing in you're sorrow
Is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow you're lonely
I name your solitude
I speak the truth

Now tell me all about you're pain
Down to the detail
Don't say it's love
Your frail heart feeds my contempt

Wailing in you're sorrow
Is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow you're lonely
I name your solitude
I speak the truth

Chase the heathen call
We belong... You and I
Unison in all you deny

I am the thorn in your side
That seeks accomplishment
Reminding the mortal of death
I am the spore of your pride
An angel heavensent
The master of all
I am the urge of the flesh...
