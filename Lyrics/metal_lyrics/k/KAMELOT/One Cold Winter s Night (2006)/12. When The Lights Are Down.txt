Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny

I've come to soak my sorrow
In hate as black
As black as the seed of my soul

'Cause when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Love is the real pain
An eternal revolution in my heart
And when the lights are down
You're so far away
Tell me your real name
In the silence of the darkness we unite

Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny

What can protect me from the past
And all the things that I have done
She told me
And then she went out

But when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Deep in the shadows
Where the last of my delusions
Make their stand
'Cause when the lights are down
She'll take me away
Tell me her real name
In death we'll live the love
We never had

Wellcome all you faithful
Meet the moon
Meet the moon
Into the body as one
Marching on

'Cause when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Love is the real pain
An eternal revolution in my heart
'Cause when the lights are down
She'll take me away
Tell me her real name
In death we'll live the love
We never had
