Come wind come snow come winter land
I have resigned myself to death
Come will to show the heathen hand
So I can draw my final breath

You could take me higher
So you said I trusted you
I may be a liar
But betrayal lies on you

I could feel where the journey ends
Final cough of a last defense

Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told

I possess a power
Of survival in the cold
Life is like a flower
As it stumbles out of fold

We all know when the time has come
This is where I will linger on

Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told

Darkness come tonight
Nothing can take my faith away
Darkness come alive
Life turns to black from silver gray

Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told

Darkness come tonight
Nothing can take my faith away
Darkness come alive
Life turns to black from silver gray
