[Part I: Mirror Mirror]

Mirror can you tell me
How to stay forever young
Let me know the secret
I will hold my twisted tongue

Please protect my beauty
Velvet skin so pure and white
Hear my name resounding
Like a hymn at dead of night

Once I struck a servant
She's a virgin free from sin
Drops of blood caressed me
And refined my aging skin

Could this be the answer
Uncorrupted carmine red
Voices keep resounding
In my dazed bewildered head

Have I found myself eternity
Someone has heard my prayers
Now I'll become divine

Have I found myself divinity
I'm no longer a slave
To the vicious hands of time

[Part II: Requiem Of The Innocent]

Mother can you hold me
One more time again
Whisper "I still love you" in my ear
Mother did you lie
Would you tell me why
There is something deeper that I fear

Justify the evil I portray
Daggers in the darkness find your way
When the moon is full and piercing bright
Drench me with your innocence tonight

Don't you want to die
Walk beside me evermore
Don't you feel alive
Like you've never felt before
Visions of the future
Unprofound and blurred
I have passed the point of no return

Justify the evil I portray
Let me keep my beauty one more day
When the moon is full and piercing bright
Drench me with your innocence tonight
Don't you want to die
Walk beside me evermore
Don't you feel alive
Like you've never felt before

Don't you want to die
Souls transcending, silver shine
Don't you feel alive
Your blood preserves my place in time

[Part III: Fall From Grace]

Breathe in deep
Smell these halls of hate
Carve your name into these walls
Before it is too late

Cold and twisted
They resisted
What was I to do
All I ever wanted was
A fraction of the truth

Walking in the shadows
Of my blackened mind
Lost inside this shallow
Vanity of time

What if there's a God a hell and heaven
Fire is the torment I must face
Dying by the souls I have forsaken
No one's going to catch my fall from grace

[Bleed on me]
Watch me from your cage
As I rejoin my painful prime
[Suffer and exhale]
You and I are relics
We provoke and we recline

Walking in the shadows
Of my blackened mind
Angels crave my sorrow
Sorrow they will find

What if there's a God a hell and heaven
Fire is the torment I must face
Dying by the souls I have forsaken
No one's going to catch my fall from grace

Walking in the shadows
Of my blackened mind
Angels crave my sorrow
Sorrow they will find
