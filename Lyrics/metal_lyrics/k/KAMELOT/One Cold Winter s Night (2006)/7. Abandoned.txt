Once my life was plain and clear
I recall once my ignorance was bliss
Nightfall came like a serpent's kiss
To my troubled mind

Why, oh why, my god
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me across the river wide

Binding promises were made on my soul
Grand illusions led astray
Ice cold winds swept my heart away
Bring me back to you

Why, oh why, my god above
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me across the river wide
