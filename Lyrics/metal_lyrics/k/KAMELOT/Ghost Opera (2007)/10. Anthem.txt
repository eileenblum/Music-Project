What's the miracle, if life itself is not?
Who am I to praise it's worth
With a hymn??
I may stumble over words that I forgot,
Just as life itself will slowly begin.

Sing me a song for the mountains to move,
Sing me the anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem of life.

I'm sceptical, I like my glass of wine,
I don't know your name, or what I am to do.
One day you'll wonder why I read between the lines,
And you will sing for me, the way I sang for you.

Sing me a song for the ocean to part,
Sing me the anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem of life.

So another page is turned,
Pray I understand what's happening,
But if anything, I do know this,
I'll be the best I can.

Sing me a song like the angels rejoice,
Sing me an anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem,
Sing me the anthem of life.
