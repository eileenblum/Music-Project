[Limited Edition Bonus Track]

In a garden in a hand
Lies a key to shadow land
You're far from feeling strong
The worst begins

In the sediments of life
In the comfort of a knife
You hold your breath
And pray to god it won't take long

And you wonder where the rainbow ends
With its autumn setting sun

[Chorus:]
There's a way from it all
Though the chances are small
We'll come back again
Won't you think it over

Life is a pendulous fall
But maybe worth the pain
And soon enough we'll go
Where nobody can touch us

Like a mother you were aimed
And you gave her what she claimed
Just like a good old friend
In the abyss of the mind
You found all there is to find
Bet we all have broken hearts to mend

So you wonder where the rainbow ends
Where the world must have begun

[Chorus:]
There's a way from it all
Though the chances are small
We'll come back again
Won't you think it over

Life is a pendulous fall
But maybe worth the pain
And soon enough we'll go
Where nobody can touch us

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
There's a way from it all
Though the chances are small
We'll come back again
Won't you think it over

Life is a pendulous fall
But maybe worth the pain
And soon enough we'll go

Life is a pendulous fall
But maybe worth the pain
(So you wonder where the rainbow ends)
Where nobody can touch us
