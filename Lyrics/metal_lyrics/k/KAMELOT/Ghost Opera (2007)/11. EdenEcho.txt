First you said that you would never leave me
Merry were my days
Then you told me life is never easy
And left without a trace

But how come I want you
Like the soil yearns for the rain

Won't you light up
Won't you light up my life
Let my soul breathe
Tell me wrong tell me right
You're my mind cage
Like a mountain far away
You were always there
Dressed in summer white

You will never know how much I miss you
Or open to my fear
Find a maze I make my way through
and enter if you dare

How come I want you
Like the soil yearns for the rain

Won't you light up
Won't you light up my life
Let my soul breathe
Tell me wrong tell me right
You're my mind cage
Like a mountain far away
You were always there
Dressed in summer white

Remember my name
And paint the darkness with your light
Go sing your song for all the broken hearted
Like Eden echoes in my head
The unforgiven gave you all

Won't you light up
Won't you light up my life
Let my soul breathe
Tell me wrong tell me right
You're my mind cage
Like a mountain far away
You were always there
Dressed in summer white
