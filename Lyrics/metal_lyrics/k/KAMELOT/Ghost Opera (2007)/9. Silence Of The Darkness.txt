I don't dare to take it slowly,
Cause time may pass me by.
Restless like a newborn morning,
I am hard to satisfy.
Will you take me away?

In the silence of the darkness,
I can't pretend I'm wide awake,
Afraid I could go under.
In the silence of the darkness,
I stumble for the light of day,
But the journey never ends.

I can paint the world with flowers,
grown by heaven's gate.
and reckless like the stormy ocean,
I could cover them with hate.
But it all sounds the same.

In the silence of the darkness,
I can't pretend I'm wide awake,
Afraid I could go under.
In the silence of the darkness,
I stumble for the light of day,
But the journey never ends.

In the silence of the darkness,
I can't pretend I'm wide awake,
Afraid I could go under.
In the silence of the darkness,
I stumble for the light of day,
But the journey never ends.
