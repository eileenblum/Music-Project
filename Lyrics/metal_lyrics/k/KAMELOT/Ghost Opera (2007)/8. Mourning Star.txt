On the fields you restore your beliefs,
Like an old man in church on a Sunday.
crawl the dirt on your elbows and knees,
Any minute you know you could die.

So come save us, turn water to wine,
Give me words of unfathomable wisdom
As I'm crossing the enemy's line,
Where the wounded and dead show the way.

(Show me the way)

Tell me when the night is gone,
Like washed away,
Make a wish beneath the mourning star.

How can there be a reason for war?
For the life of a human that suffers
I remember, I heard it before,
Tell me all when the new day begins.

(The new day begins)

Tell me when the night is gone,
Like washed away,
Make a wish beneath the mourning star.
When the victory is won,
The old clichÃ©,
Underneath the same old mourning star.

[rest in peace all that be good]
why please tell me why
[rest in piece thy fatherhood]
You gave the world all this pain

Tell me when the man is gone,
Like washed away,
Make a wish beneath the mourning star.
When the victory is won,
The old clichÃ©,
Underneath the same old mourning star.
