When a new day reaches dawn
I feel it's worth the wait
But I tumble and I fall
When up against my fate

When the barricades come down
I build them up again
When I'm just about to drown
I still don't know the end

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I tremble
Like a little child
That faces morning
With a broken smile
Sometimes I crumble
When the shades unfurl
Sometimes I feel that
I could rule the world

[Solo]

When the morning comes alive
Release your love brigade
At the end of day it's night
To suck it up with hate

[Chorus x2]

(That faces morning
With a broken smile
Sometimes I crumble
When the shades unfurl
Sometimes I feel that
I could rule the world)
