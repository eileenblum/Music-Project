See the cemetery sky
Carmine red and deep
Watch the oceans rising high
It's the human stain

Talk about the growing hunger
Ask why with deep concerned
Don't you think the human races
Is ceaselessly vain

[Chorus:]
But it hurts to be
Alive my friend
In this silent tide
We're driftwood passing by

Don't you wish you
Were a child again
Just for a minute
Just for a minute more

Hear the ticking of a clock
The sound of life itself
No one really wants to die
To save the world

Tell me that you're torn asunder
From how we fail to learn
And tell me if the Earth goes under
Where's your anger now

[Chorus:]
So it hurts to
Be alive, my friend
In this masquerade where
All one day must die

Don't you wish you
Were unborn again
Just for a minute
Just for a minute more

[Solo]

Tic-Toc
The ticking at the tear asunder
The beating from a heart of stone
The loss of your divine prosperity

[Chorus:]
'Cause it costs to
Be alive, my friend
And this life that someone
Merely gave to you

That's the price you take
Minute by minute
You beg for a minute more
