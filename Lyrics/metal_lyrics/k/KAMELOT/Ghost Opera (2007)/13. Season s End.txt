[Japanese bonus track]

Once in my life
A second of eternity
Seems long in my mind
What used to be
Keep changing over time
Don't go
Please don't say it's over 'til it is

Don't say goodbye
Like we'd never meet again
Leave me a lie
At the season's end

Moments in time
Seems to be so long
In my old mind
My images of may
You gave me a sign
I took the chance
Of never looking back
I hope you understand

Don't say goodbye
Like we'd never meet again
Leave me a lie
At the season's end
Come lift the light
Into heaven with a song
Don't say goodbye
'Cause it's been so long

It's been so long
It's been so long

You gave me a sign
I took a chance
By never looking back
I hope you understand

I hope you don't say goodbye
Like we'd never meet again (Say goodbye...)
Leave me a lie
At the season's end (Season's end)
Come lift the light
Into heaven with a song (With a song...)
Don't say goodbye
'Cause it's been so long

It's been so long
So long
