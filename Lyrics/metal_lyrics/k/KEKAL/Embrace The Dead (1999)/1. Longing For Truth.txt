If I had a little time to empathize
On how the Earth suffers the most
Tortured landscapes and dying forests
Witnessing the quality of mankind

Greed, corrupted minds
Perversion, misled goals
Something wrong here...

Life's not an imaginary time sequence
A reality line which forms the chronicles of our deeds
From birth time to our demise we spend
Our days of irresponsibility

Our civilizations continue to bottom-line
The plagues of Earth that emphasize its severe conditions
History proved it
No one can escape from this fact!

Desperately - seeing our corrupted world
Done by hands - that help build and destroy
Who's to blame - for all degeneration?
Inside us - we are longing for the Truth

Longing for truth!

Crying in confusion
Who will save this world
...from its destruction?
