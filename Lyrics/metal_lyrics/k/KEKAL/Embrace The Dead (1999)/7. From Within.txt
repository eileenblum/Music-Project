I am, a creation of dust and made by dust
I am, a free entity with all the choices in front of me
In me, there is a will to live my life
In me, there is a destructive tendency built by hate

Questions asked, never satisfied with my existence
"To where I have to go? The purpose of my direction"
"Why must I face all these sufferings?"
I've been longing to find my reason to exist

A life of sin is reality I must accept
The Book cleary refers to fall of our ancestor
Many would call it as a tale and nothing more
But I can feel its Truth in my own bad blood

Until I find the reason of my suffering...
...through the knowledge written in Bible
No one could make me satisfied with the answer
No one knows me, except The One whoe gives me breath

In fact there is only way God has prepared
I don't think it's wise to take all things just for granted
In fact that there are many distractions around
Try to keep myself from knowing His will
