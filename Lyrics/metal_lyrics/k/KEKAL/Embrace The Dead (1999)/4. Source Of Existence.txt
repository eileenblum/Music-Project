From the Earth minds are wondering
How could this great universe runs so well
Space and time, both follow the order
It makes us to think who's behind such things

Hail to the forests...
For they are the lungs of Earth
Hail to the mountains...
For their amazing scenery

Look down into the smaller scale of reality
These living beings, exist to occupy our planet
The biological orders within our own bodies
They make us to think who create such things

Hail to the oceans...
For they bring the majestic waves
Hail to the rivers...
That keep flowing until the call
Of The Last

"I am the Alpha and the Omega
... who is, who was, and who is to come
The Almighty"

It would take faith
To believe there was a process of creation
It would take more faith
To believe there's a coincidental existence

The quest for reason
Keeps compelling my thoughts and my emotions
Towards the fact
That there is an existence of a Higher Being

I bow to the Source of universe
The Creator of all things seen and unseen
