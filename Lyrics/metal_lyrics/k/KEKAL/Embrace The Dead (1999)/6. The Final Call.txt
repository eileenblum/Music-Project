These are days of our revival
The las moments for reaping the seeds sown
Civilizations must to be aware to all the signs
Signs of the end of our earthly time

Let the people see the coming of the Son of Man
The return of the Thunderous Might
We shall see the Holy One upon His Throne
We shall meet the Risen face to face

Love has opened the gate to the eternity
Love that heals our wounds and scars
Love who washes away the dark taint of sin
The same Love who once crucified

Let the people see the coming of the Son of Man
The return of the Thunderous Might
We shall see the Holy One upon His Throne
We shall meet the Risen face to face

Down here, seeing our corrupted world
Drowing with its deadly desires
Religions, ideologies, and moral teachings
Cannot save us from the state called death

The Spirit has warned us time to time
As voces that heard beneath us
Calling the ones who are dying to see the Truth
The ones who want to be saved

There is a way, a path to follow
A path of the great escape
A path where Truth belongs there
Hear the final call...
