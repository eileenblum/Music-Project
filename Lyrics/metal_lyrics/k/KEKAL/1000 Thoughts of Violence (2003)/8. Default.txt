[music &amp; lyrics: Jeff]

a vanity rises in the middle of our motion - with ever-changing colours of
illusive existential components - unfictitious presence, scars and
withdrawal, leaving us to wonder... - i want to see, but my eyes are blind
- should i seek for a guidance of my life? - beyond a flock of confusion -
i ask for a return to original form - without any agreement or concensus -
determination has already been chosen - free us from a process of
decadence - free us from a procession to our graves - back to the state
where things just started - back to the place where i belong - i want to
see, but my eyes are blind - should i seek for a guidance of my life?
