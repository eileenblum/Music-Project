[music &amp; lyrics: Jeff]

we're in the beginning of the end of time - in the middle of the countdown
- it's impossible to turn around - but who's aware of it? - lost in the
fields of thick deceptions - up all nights and all days, creating more
goals based on worldly views - here it is, anywhere we look around we'll
see - proove of mankind's grand achievements - backed by technological
sophistication - but should we proud of it? - lost in the fields of thick
deceptions - up all nights and all days, creating more goals based on
worldly views, in worldly ways - what's in our minds? - with all these
philosophical kinds of-modern frames of thoughts - a new-found old
insanity - as we lost in the fields of thick deceptions - up all nights
and all days, creating more goals based on worldly views, in worldly ways
