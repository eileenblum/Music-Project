[I. 404 - The Broken]

404 - file not found - 404 - broken Link - 404 - virtual void - 404 - and
so it stands - a universal code  - of all unfound files - deep within the
world - of hypertexts - a message presents in the absence of URL - unable
to access and to download - the web as a holistic approach - for us to
collect all information - a dream of more accessible world - in this
cybernetic ivory tower - powerless, as it appears at our monitors - the
world of imperfectness, the world of ours

[II. 911 - The Black]

3 digits on a dialing code - to access departments of rescue - numbers
known for help-assistance - related with a social security - lines of
governmental services - working in a complete duty - units seemed to be
flawless - with funds that appropriately flow - still, the world who never
sleeps - it will never give up its darkside - even the rescue code can be
taken - as a symbol to create one big tragedy - when the very eyes of the
world - moved by a singular defining moment - those numbers became a point
for another meaning - at time when people both cry, or rejoice, in the
awakening of war!

[III. 70x7 - To Forgive is To Suffer]

how often shall we forgive - up to 3 times? up to 7 times? - no, it is up
to 70x7 - we hear a sound of weakness in our minds - the rhythm of the
twilight, and rhythm of the night - to give the guilty ones their second
lives - and death was only price, a suffering and pain - for us, the
unforgiven who get redeemed for free - so can't we give our "enemies" the
unconditional state of forgiveness? - to forgive is to be hurt - to
forgive is to suffer
