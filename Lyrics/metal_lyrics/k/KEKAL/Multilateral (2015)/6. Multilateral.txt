have you ever ruminated about over-imposed vanity 
trying to keep the ground from floating into obscurity 
any attempt to summarize manifold complexities 
will find itself in a position where truth is just a mere property 
this room shall blend all the sounds of ideals 
coming from distinct opinions and theories 
unity is chaos and pandemonium on a set of wheels 
walls will administer contrasting sources without partiality 
set your attack - set your decay 
i want to believe there is assurance beyond all reasons 
maneuvers that eliminate contradictory matters of distinctions 
twisting perilously until all sounds start to dissolve and fade 
this selfishness will shatter as space inside began to agitate
