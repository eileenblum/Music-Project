explore and discover new things each day 
follow the progress, riding the waves of change 
even burden always weigh heavily in the mind 
resistance is futile, there is no need to confront 
we cannot fight our time when clock is ticking on 
we cannot stand still when the earth rotates 
this is how we live and we are getting old 
generation ends another generation begins 
life only becomes precious when we make it be 
dreams will manifest when we seize the moments 
god knows our wishes, understands our pain 
there is an essence of our very existence
