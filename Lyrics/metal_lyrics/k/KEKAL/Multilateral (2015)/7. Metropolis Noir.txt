imagine a city without access to the open sky 
gloomy day is an everyday scene up above 
dark smog thickens my point of embattlement 
i could see, on its face, elucidation of despair 
seen so many times before, so many times 
these pages will not just turn by themselves 
world is so twisted that human life renders no value 
getting worse makes the element of progress 
you could tell wisdom is measured by profits 
granted limits beset chosen destiny 
if only you would swallow and digest everything 
the epitome of greed, was not a single stranger matter
