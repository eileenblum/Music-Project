you are your own enemy 
the power you seek is the power to oppose 
seize every opportunity 
where by itself is the source of problems 
your face is as a book 
where men may read strange matters 
your mind is a search engine 
to feed morbid curiosities in a virulent way 
fortune comes from unusual places 
if you ever believe in the unconventional 
let mind becomes the arch-captor 
entrance from this worn nonsense down into enigma
