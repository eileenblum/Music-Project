one would argue it was far too close 
for a greater society reversing into calamity 
unbolted its threshold of fear and angst 
confusion heightened at the crossroads of destiny 
somehow nearing the boundaries of turmoil 
karma, justice, divine intervention 
equalizing intermingled imbalances 
from gloom, rise forth the glowing spirit of hope 
we should never dissolve our leap of faith 
keep reeling out to the omnipresent reality 
stretching our mere limits of understanding 
where the end is really just the beginning 
perceive what matters most to earn contented state 
realize its true forms of the animating principle 
the past, the present, the future as well 
god shall reconstruct our microcosmic aspirations
