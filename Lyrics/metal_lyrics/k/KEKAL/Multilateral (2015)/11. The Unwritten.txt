what makes things certain 
the element that crawls 
from the edge of a beginning 
to the center of the end 
one may leave to question 
the validity of proclamation 
such thing exists in a written world 
a world full of manipulations 
what makes you wonder 
about what would aggregate 
misery and adversity 
becoming a singularity 
existence does not require confirmation 
experience is a gift of enjoyment 
be grateful of what you have today 
and you will be alright
