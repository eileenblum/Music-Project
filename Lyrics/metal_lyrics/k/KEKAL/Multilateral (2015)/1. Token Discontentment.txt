nothing makes you feel bitterer 
than being removed from the core 
autonomy without sense of realization 
speeding towards non-destination 
like a demon in the family of angels 
an alien within my own existence 
there is no place to fit in 
regardless of what i do and who i am 
learning the mechanism of pain 
that follows the same pathway as mine 
as suffering is part of oneâs experience 
in life that should never be denied 
i have become a slave to my own way of understanding 
there is no place to fulfill my desire to escape from reality
