humankind of an equal essence 
should be given equal participation 
equal access to information and knowledge 
be part of open society in an open world 
one portal that fits everyoneâs expressions 
eliminating hierarchies within social construction 
and to cease governmental interference 
in order to achieve preservation of neutrality 
absolute power corrupts absolutely 
realization of an ideal should be done collectively 
information sharing as a part of contributive mindset 
but this will always challenge our human nature 
elimination of self is the one most effortful condition 
in a society where the most popular act is to play god
