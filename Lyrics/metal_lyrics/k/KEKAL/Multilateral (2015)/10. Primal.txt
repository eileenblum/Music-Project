we cannot exist without exposure to adversity 
for life itself is spiced by elements of pain 
learning how to weather the storm that passes day by day 
remaining vigilant as far as mind can see 
to begin with, seasons are here for us to watch 
sometimes imaginations set us up for troubles 
as age flies by we cling to the first importance 
regain a footing after all the loss and failures 
find a way to ease our pain 
life unfolds in a passage of time 
bringing forth the sense of hope 
here we are, off we go
