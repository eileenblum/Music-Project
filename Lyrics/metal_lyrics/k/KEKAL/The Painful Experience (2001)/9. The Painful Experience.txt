Would you like to share the pain with Me?
Experience those darkest moments I once had.
You have bcome a part of Me and I'm inside you,
reflecting all of Myself through this suffering.

With pain, I have gained a victory over your death,
entered the darkest realm to give a light for you.
I was here, born as "a loser" in the eyes of the world,
bitterness that was taken, flesh that was torn.

Would you like to feel the pain that I felt?
Experience those darkest moments I once had.
If you said that you love Me and believe in Me,
won't you leave your glory and carry your cross with Me?

The wound, the blood, the torture,
the mockery, the humiliation,
entered the darkest hell to give a light for you.
I was here, hanging on a tree of hate and disgust,
bitterness that was taken, blood that was spilled.

Does it really matter now?
In this age of technology,
will you forget all My pain
and refuse your suffering?

A cross to take, your cross to take.
Suffer with Me,
suffer with Me...
