Shame on me, now I'm standing alone
when I turn my face far behind
the shadow of yesteryear's sighs.
Gradually his shape fades,
degrades under the law of time,
swallowed by the book of memories.

Forgive me for what I've committed.
Many times I fly, in the light, in the dark.
I just did it pointlessly,
reaching for something,
so distant...so alone.

Dreaming for another touch, I fly so high,
I just let myself falling,
wildly drifting on the air.
Marching the sounds of my inner ill,
hear the weeping of the bleeder...shout!

Crawls...reveals...this drowning hope here beneath.
Many times I give my mind a crown and lay down,
stiff unmoved and yet posed a dying mortal flesh.
Piercing the limits, stretch upon my hollow painted nest,
keep on questioning my daily breath...what a day!

No matter how intense I strike,
the anger still here and breed inside.
I hate myself, hating the light,
this pain I feel kills me outright.
What should I do to break this chain?

It's only you, my only strength to fight,
facing my mirrors of ideal reality.
Morning's pride arrives, enter my two wounded eyes,
brings her another ugliest blazing wrath.
Will I keep survive under this earth burning sun?

Why can't I seize the dusk,
the only chance I give my misery eulogy?
Dear Lord, I chocked by the plans of Thee.
Severely amazed, torture in doubt,
questions I've drawn, left and forgotten,
I pass the answers, I let my light dimmed.
