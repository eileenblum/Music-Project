It's just another extraction of sense,
watering the troubles of order
to invert the truth.
Build the empire upon the sand,
more lies behind this game, internal hollow.

In this life, anything can go too far.
All shall die.
See how long it could stand on there
with gold that won't be forever last.

Feel the time's running on and on,
all those have done would be in vain.
It could have been better
when it comes from the truth.

Earning every penny out of sweat and tears,
above the solid ground,
those walls will stand still.
The Rock makes it stronger, up against the winds.

In this life, reality tests it all.
one shall live.
See which one will survive at last...
one who built it upon the rock or sand?

When these rain, floods and winds come in,
who shall live and who shall die?
So it's life for those who follow the Truth.
Salvation.
