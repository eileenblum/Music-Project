Far from this age,
from the beginning of all creation,
it has been an order...
when or where we will be called to exist and to demise.

All is in control but not ours,
the law, free will, I give you...
know what it means: "The highest creation"
given to us freedom and authority,
wisdom and knowledge, and enough brain
to think and to learn, to grow with self-sufficient.

The law, free will, I give you,
won't you realize of your existence?
All is the best for you,
now as became the fallen ones,
you are unable to think even for yourselves.
How can you start to doubt Me in the minds?

With your hearts that turn to stone,
I can understand what pains you feel away from My presence.
I never blame you for your fragile minds,
now I give you My Word to know Me easier.

Words that fit to the corrupted
Words that fit to the sick
Words that fit to the disabled
Words that fit to those who doubt
Words that fit to the ignorant
Words that fit to the weak
Words that fit to the arrogant
Words that fit to all of us.
