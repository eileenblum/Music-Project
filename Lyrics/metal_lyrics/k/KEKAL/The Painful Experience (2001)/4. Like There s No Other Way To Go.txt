"What life means to you, my friend?"
A question asked to everyone I know.
It was so simple but carries the weight of mind,
as no one wants to know and even cares about.

Newspapers cover the same stuff everyday:
wars, crimes, disasters, problems still exist
as seen on TV and on Internet.
That costs our time with all those mortal affairs,
wondering why we should be here
surrounded by the literal horrors.
Should we accept this stagnant situation?

Like there's no other way to go,
many have found their ways to live,
creating philosophical types of reactions.
Realize it's only counter-concepts,
none would give a real solution.
Knowledge that comes from these crippled minds:
wars, crimes, disasters, problems still exist.
Register names on "club of ignorance",
partake in the state of confusion
the hearts that have been pierced from both sides...

None shall last forever, not even this life,
for we brought nothing into this world,
we cannot take anything out of the world.
Let's think about tomorrow, seek another day,
heading to the one world beyond, keep the minds free.
