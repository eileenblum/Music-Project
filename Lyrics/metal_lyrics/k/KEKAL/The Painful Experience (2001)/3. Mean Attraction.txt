Televisions, breaking news popped out that night:
another explosion's attacked the city again.
Hospitals were filled with innocent victims,
death tolls are high, but none would down in fear.

Mean attraction, horror in sight,
spreading the terrors, to kill was not the mission.
But yet only death appears at the frontline.
What lies ahead, a situational chaos?
How far they've succeded, none exactly knows.

Mean attraction, terror in sight,
human, the only species
with mass-murder capability.
Seething with disconcent,
political visions to obscure resolutions.
What reasons that stimulate madness
out of these poor brains?
Purpose never reached, when all become a part
of business as usual.
