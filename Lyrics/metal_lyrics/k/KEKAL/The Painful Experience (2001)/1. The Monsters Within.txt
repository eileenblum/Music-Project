Welcome to the world of violence,
hear the chants of hate,
where all anger and confusion
mixed down all this way.
Society won't take the blame
on these brutal acts.
Burning people, torture, killing,
what else can I say?

Blood is spilled on the ground,
body laid down in weakness.
They won't hear his pleading
when they pour the gasoline.
Paid in full for a little crime,
man, he's been kicked and beaten.
No more chance to escape,
just wait for his last breath.
Burn! Die!

Something sure must happen
if law is not functioning.
When the crimes are on the top,
none can take it any longer,
wilder than defined "anarchy".
"You cops, stay away!
We are kings of own neighbourhood,
to protect and to kill!"

Worse than the animal,
evil is the nature of man.
Driven by sadistic plans of action,
can we save ourselves?
There is no one righteous, not even one...
what should we do to take away
all these monsters within?
