It feels like our world
has been pushed to the edge
where beauty is being exploited
without the sense or respect.
Billions are doing theirs, never expecting the things
that would manifest themselves in a time to come.

With my eyes, I see you and your world is going down,
the colors fade away as black replaces all.
With my eyes, I see you and your world is going down,
images fade away as death replaces all.

Put the shadow in its place
as it supposed to appear.
The black shades are here beside us
as reflections of ours
when there is a light against
the antithesis of man-made knowledge.

From the void that comes through our optimisms,
we've learned to deny the potential excess,
where "why" is taboo and "how" is hyped.
Drifting from our very own pitiful existence,
minds that create an illusion of accomplishment.
Back from the tombs, the tragedy defines itself,
leading the ways to nowhere, where death is at the end!

With my eyes, I see you and your world is going down,
the colors fade away as black replaces all.
With my eyes, I see you and your world is going down,
images fade away as death replaces all.

A dismal portrait of mortal life,
betrayal of mankind's existence.
So many blind ambitions
with false motivations and false directions.
Caught in a cold confusion,
bearing all the lies of men.
I wish I could see my future life,
to look behind all these seemingly closed doors.
Illuminate me with true divine light,
O owner of the key to the world beyond...
