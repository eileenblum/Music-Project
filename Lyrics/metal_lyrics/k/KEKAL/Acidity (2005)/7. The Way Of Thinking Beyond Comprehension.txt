Out in a confusion
When we no longer know how
To decide and to make a choice
What is right and what is wrong
A second next before deadline
Reality testing, an asymmetric completion
Is this what we call "life"?
Caught in a state of endless stagnation
When we are tired to swallow it
Digesting our immobility of experience
To become a machine of our society
Stamped down within these concrete fields
Think harder and think again
We are what we become
Think harder and think again
We are not the present "us"
Nothing is plain impossible
Even for things beyond human capability
As long as there is a chance
And there is time who provides moments
