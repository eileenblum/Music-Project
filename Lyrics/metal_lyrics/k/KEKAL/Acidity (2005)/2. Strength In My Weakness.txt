It came along in one concrete form
A knowledge that turned me upside down
Let us put it this way: a new experience
Of living a life without me as I
Accept the nature and origin
Of our human condition
Believe that something defective
Flows down inside the blood of mine
Not a best thing to do, from the world's mindframe
To see all my pride diminishing
Given away this kind of strength once I had
To be replaced by a thing called faith
Accept the nature and origin
Of our undisputable weakness
Believe in something invincible
To take control of my whole
Accept the nature and origin
Of our undisputable weakness
Believe in something invincible
To take over my self
