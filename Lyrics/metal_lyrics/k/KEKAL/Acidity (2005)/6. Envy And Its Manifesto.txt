Let's talk about something we know well, and its name is envy
Certainly not a similar kind with jealousy
And it is not about relationship, nor politics, nor a system
But instead, it is something do do with an individual drive
I see a path which is leading towards a life of depravity
It is clear, the ignorance acts as a destroyer of limits
A conscience set by one's ethical values is now questioned
When the initial point for the crime is about to be committed and executed
Walk this way
Gaining a chronic Cain-complex
Fade away
And kill the core of contentment
Every page of a book has its own substance that linked to the rest
The same thing applied exactly to humankind
People were born with all different shapes and patterns and uniqueness
Imagine what would happen if everyone owns the same everything?
Walk this way
A lifeline has been made dysfunctional
Fade away
And kill the core of contentment
