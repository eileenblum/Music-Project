Feel our time is descending
A metamorphic significance
In a dream for a moment
It comes near as strange as we are
Communicate omni-verbally
Centers hope and facility
Let the spirit prays what we long
To redesign our future needs
Portal of our wishes
Entrance to a stage of balance
A spiritual archetype
To survive the miserable world
Communicate omni-verbally
Gathers hope and facility
Let the spirit prays what we long
To redesign our destiny
Beyond our frail elements of conscious
There is a multi-dimensional capacity
Creating strong synergy of wish and reality
A drive to idealize values and quality
