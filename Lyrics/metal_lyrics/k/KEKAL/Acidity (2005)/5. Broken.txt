These feelings I can't explain
Months and even years of yearning
For the beauty that never come
Each day I find only dying souls
I know we have to enjoy the life
Yet I'm still complaining everything
Ever seems like never... No more
Colours translated as black in sight
Overshadowed by uncertainty
When will it become calm again?
Storms of disillusion wrecked my mind
Pull me to the state of total chaos
I know we have to enjoy the life
Yet I'm still complaining everything
Where is my faith as I had in the past?
I need to get it back right now!
