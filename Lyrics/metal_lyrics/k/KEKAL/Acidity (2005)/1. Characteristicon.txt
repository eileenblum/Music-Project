Set to believe in a peculiar way
Under a hyperlogical mental occurence
A truth beyond standardization
Beyond structural represtentation
As we can see
As we can hear
As we can feel in many ways
Images from distinct classifications
Elements of thoughts minus speculations
Bizarre primary definitions
Demand no equivalence
Equipped by senses and imaginations
Systematic cycles of consistency
Individuality within a solid uniformal characteristics
Now we can see
Now we can hear
Now we can feel
We are not the same
Blessed with different gifts
