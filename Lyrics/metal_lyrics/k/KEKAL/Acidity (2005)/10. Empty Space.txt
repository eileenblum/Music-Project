Shadows, a presence of a void within
Journey towards the edge of life
Frigid, an iced-filled blood inside
Keep me from the state of being alive
Numbness, deleting passion in one strike
Running, wandering through these empty roads
Darkeded, to paint myself into black
Kept me from the state of being alive
Pushing these eyes to get the second sight
What I feel is no pain
What I sense is emptiness
You got to fill me now
You got to kill my flesh
You got to mold my brain
Restructuring my thoughts
You got to burn my vein
And boil my ice cold blood
You got to set me free
And break my chains away
