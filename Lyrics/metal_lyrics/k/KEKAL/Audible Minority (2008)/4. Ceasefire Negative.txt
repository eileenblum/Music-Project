An acquired savor is underway
Never to let it pass
Facing tremors and discordance
With vigor and persistence
You cannot stop me from believing
In things you don't understand
This passion is my firm weapon
To kill all mediocre thoughts
Tear down these solid walls
And liberate the spirits inside
New dawn shall greet us all
True believers of new renaissance
Off the beaten path, we walk
With eyes and minds wide open
Confronting ignorance
And counter-cultural conformity
You cannot stop me from conceiving
About things you don't relate to
Hoping someday you will realize
This war is for our good
