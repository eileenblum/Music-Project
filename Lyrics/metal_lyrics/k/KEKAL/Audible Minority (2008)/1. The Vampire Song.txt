The good, the bad and the ugly all share one side of a coin
While the other side has the x-factor we never want to come across
So many things beyond our control, so many possibilities adjoin
Preparing promptness to accept either gain or loss
I never thought of getting myself so deep
Into facing this kind of reality
Searching for a common response to every individual happening
Experiences brought us a coping-formula with lots of "how"s
But not even one came close enough to suit with another
Preparing promptness to look for a supernatural guidance
I never thought of getting myself so deep
Into facing this kind of reality
Which sacrifices everything out of me
Here I stand naked before the mighty destiny
I never dreamed of taking a pilgrim's role
Settlement was the only wish I made
Arranging visions and expectations
My goals slowly fade when life takes over
