Shining - darkened - warming coldness
I am, you are, in this mortal coil
There is something inside you who always try to fight against me
And something inside me who always want to deny you
An animal of pseudo-consciousness I have become
A light of truth is hiding inside my illicit darkness
So many years of seemingly unending contradictions
So many times I'd given up in battling this depression
An animal with lack of self-esteem I have become
Always mean to keep these devils within my cavities
