Sympathy for the ones who lost in their battles
Giving extra courage to the dying others
Life would easily devour us in the most evil way
While we try to identify with the law of nature
They might believe in a survival of the fittest
Some say it's a survival of the luckiest
Or maybe even survival of the prettiest
In the end, you will just see someone survives
Religions teach methods of a survival of the holiest
You would rather be a survivor of the luckiest
Or maybe even survivor of the gentlest
However, we do desire us to survive
In our world of randomness
We wish to design our grand destiny
Avoiding any factor of changeableness
Steer clear from option towards extinction
In our world of randomness
We wish to design our grand destiny
A destiny which is entering into the psyche
And in our world, it's beyond our control
Having open oxygen to breathe easily
Freedom from now, but this does not work that way
We never know if someday we must pay-per-inhale
As we cannot expand our dimensional limits
