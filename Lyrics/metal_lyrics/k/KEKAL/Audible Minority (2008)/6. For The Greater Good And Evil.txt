I am the bearer of this pain
Holding sunset of my dying race
Existence diminished
As the genes of darkness crossed my very path
Watching chances go away
Passing bridges of nothingness
There is no such love or hate
Passion with life is what I long
It's all for the greater good
And evil that is still lurking
Waiting for the right moment
To attack me from the inside
