Innocent eyes of a child
Could give us an insight
On how she sees the world
In a much different perspective.

We've passed our innocent days
Since many years ago,
Traded them with anger and despair
And with constant discomfort.

The way we stand together,
The way we fall together,
The way we deal our lives together,
It's all that matters.

Yesterday has gone for good,
Tomorrow will never be the same.
Today is the most difficult time,
For us to understand the plan.

The way we walk together,
The way we cry together,
The way we risk our lives together,
It's all that matters.
