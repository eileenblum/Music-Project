Something's surely not for everyone
Never know
Never want to tell, to share
Adjusting my dream-to-reality ratio
Should I go
Should I face against both extremes?
I need to be
A man who enjoys his fear
Try to get used with this opacity
I need to see
Beyond those clouds of doubts
To play around with this obscurity
A fusion of dreams, wish and illusions
At some degree
My mind just told me: "That's unreal"
Sometimes I feel tired of praying everyday
Asking god same kind of thing over and over again
I need to be
A man who walks his shoes
Try to invent my own felicity
I need to see
Beyond those clouds of doubts
To play around with this obscurity
