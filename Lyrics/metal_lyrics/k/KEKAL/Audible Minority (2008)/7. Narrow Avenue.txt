There was time that we were wary of our life
All those days we spent taking instead of giving
Watched my world collapsing in front of my eyes
I'd exchange its debris for a small new beginning
In the coldest freezing breeze of winternight
I see stars on my path all the way back home
In my dream I could embrace my whole world
And the future that is here within a reach
I must take the narrowest way
