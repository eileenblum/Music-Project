Us in the state of constant change.
Conservatism has lost its meaning.
Left behind all lies and deceit.
Us in a carrier, driven one way forward.

Purity's an illusion, life has its proof.
To one's heart's content, openness upsurged.
Sustain singularity within set patterns.
Let us blend!

Together we stand, as a fusion of styles,
the magic of colors, alluring dynamics,
where differences made new pathways.
Let us blend!

Shall we attain hybrid sophistication,
piercing right into the core of being?
Our character shall be preserved
even in an absence of homogeneity.
