Finding truth in lies, reading between the lines.
See through deceptions, sense through periphery.
An intrinsic macrocosm, essential and constitutive,
entirely in totality.
Gestalt principles of matter perception.

A multitude of perceptive decay.
Reasons interact within acceptance,
built into somatic habit and regularity.
Unquestionable yet undecidable.
