Beyond the mental image of a man
lies a blueprint made by God.

I am standing here recalling to
all the roads we have passed through:
Always hard to understand,
always hard to comprehend.

Yet it's always easy to believe
we are not here for no reason.
So many mistakes and failures,
so many elements of imperfection
formed by our sense of free will.

Causing sadness that never disappear
when life has broken into pieces,
we realize everything has gone so wrong.

Beyond man's own nervous breakdown
lies a blueprint made by God.
And here I am standing on a line
between reconstruction and destruction...
