Welcome to the world of endless transformation,
a universe of continual permutation.
Having no mark of culmination,
Kekal in its primordial signification.

Seeking justice through resolutions,
an outbreak from the years of stagnation.
Mankind is an empty space - a floating void,
waiting to get materialized and vectorized.

Take eight as a sign of infinity.
This gate is a portal of liberty,
and I'm taking you with me, baby.
Let the dead bury the dead.

Your progressive journey begins here,
through the alleys of pain with me.
