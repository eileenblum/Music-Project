Utilize proper logics through modal thinking,
a root of analytical dialectics.
Philosophize, ratiocinate all nonsense
until my mind simulates pandemonium.

Morale, rationale came off unforeseen.
Idleness in the way we generate conjecture.
Downsizing expectations to the bitter end,
feeling trapped within this segmental aperture.

See the whole world revolving around me
while I found myself in a stationary struggle,
only to collapse without one single movement
as visions expanded beyond mental capability.

Die down in personal responsibility,
and I'm looking forward to it.
