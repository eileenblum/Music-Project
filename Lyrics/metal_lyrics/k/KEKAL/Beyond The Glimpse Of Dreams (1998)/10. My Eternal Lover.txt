Remembering the day when You were crucified
Hung and nailed to the cross, a sacrifice for mankind
Your precious blood wash away the sin
More than just a hero, You are my Savior

Remembering the day when You were arose from the dead
A total victory, banish away the stain of death
Your precious love lasting eternally
More than just a hero, You are my Savior

I feel the warmth of Your love embraces me
Through the last days of imperfect life, there's a hope

Come quickly, come quickly,
come quickly O Lord Jesus
Come quickly, come quickly,
come quickly, giver of hope

You are the only truth, all praise and glory to You
Lord, I am waiting for Your second coming

Come quickly, come quickly,
come quickly O Lord Jesus
Come quickly, come quickly,
come quickly, my eternal lover
