Evil horror comprised within rhymes, 
fascinated to the darkside's representation
Hiding behind the sensational lines
a reference to somewhat blasphemous

Upon mankind's dark fantasies
Evil's stabbing from behind
Ignorance calls as he always tries 
to use the words until he dies

When we looked others in need,
we must realize we're capable to care
How can we expect good respect from others
if we're still demonstrating apathy to society?

Upon mankind's dark fantasies
Evil's stabbing from behind
Those sensations soon will be
forgotten forever in the clench of fire

Paradoxical life causes suffer to mind
All harmonies only found in Christ
Reality must we face, image of God
Feel the power of good, change the fate
