Deceiver of this world, beware
Tremble in your heart, you scared
Your destruction time is near
Have no mercy for your fear 

Serpent's legions, devil troops 
Terror drift in cries of war
The air is thin and time stands still
Soldiers ready for the kill

Prophecy shall be completed
as Satan crushed immortal
New world order, souls shall fall,
but the armies of God stands tall

In fire the earth devoured 
Scattered bodies, eternal pain
Satan will be tormented
with his servants burned to dust

Prophecy shall be completed
as Satan crushed immortal
New world order, souls shall fall,
but the armies of God stands tall

When God destroy all heavens,
no star will be reserved
Fire came down from Heaven
No evil thing shall be survived

Burning flesh, tainted wounds
Second death will follow soon
For the wicked, the price is death
when the book of life's been read

In fire the earth devoured
Scattered bodies, eternal pain
Satan is now tormented
with his servants burned to dust
