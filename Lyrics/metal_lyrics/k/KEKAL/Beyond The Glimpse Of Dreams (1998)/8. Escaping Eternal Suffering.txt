No one is good in the eyes of almighty God
Creation inherit the seed which be the cause of death
Since the first man's fall, we all suffered the separation
No matter what norm and laws we create, we shall not be saved by them

Nobody but God himself who change the fate of human being
Far beyond the glimpse of dreams and longingness of these earthly wisdoms

Living by a faith in the son who was born as flesh and blood
He took over the natural consequences
Which was directed to us
The death and resurrection of Christ had paid the cost of damnation 
Escaping the eternal suffering, reconciliation between God and mankind
