I was born in the place of the fear
with all the difference surrounding me
The only knowledge I got was so dark
"Satan is the only Lord", they said

Lived in darkness, served the serpent 
Nothing that's good I had to follow
Committed all crimes, "do what thou wilt" 
Something evil stored inside my head

Rose from the ashes of confusion
I did not know what the truth's about
For this I was charged of being guilty 
of all crimes against humanity

Something happened within my life
In my darkest hour, came to me
the light of Christ, real divine love
I felt ashamed of all I have done

Forgiveness I found, He gave me a new life
Knowledge of the truth open up inside
The devil might steal my youth away,
but now he cannot stop my will to be free

Satan never fulfilled his promise to me
He just invert all the truth
Now I have a chance to live eternally
In Christ, my soul has been freed
