Why should we proud to take
a direction we know it is not for mankind?
To astray we shall be
Why should we glorify the Hades and the death? 
Those things are not the same
Completely lost their power

Too many aspects in this life will hurt us all
In control of sin, evil hides inside us
All our pain is real, darkness seems to be our nature
Easy to hate, but please open your eyes and see

The devil is defeated, darkness has lost its power
Fire and brimstone will torment him eternally
Death is overcome and never to rise again
What a waste of time to glorify his existence!

Jesus Christ shed his blood, took the sin of mankind
He provides us a way to attain life in eternity

Take the time to learn from the knowledge of the truth
Darkness will rise no more, it is reality
