Deceived by the lost one, you worship the wrong idol
He told you he's the bringer of liberation 
Manipulate and brainwash your mind with his lies
Enjoying cult following from the ignorance of man

Satanic dreams never become reality
Wasting life walking on path of deception 
Relying on "the hope" that never be fulfilled
At the end, only eternal torture you must face 

Is there any evidence of Satanic victory? 
It's all in your mind, awakened by sin
A hope without faith in God is impotence
Illusions of power and glory are part of his deception
A logical philosophy?
You've betrayed, you've deceived
All creations belong to God the creator!

Face the fact, God is the only Lord
He give us Christ to banish all the sin
Satanic philosophy comes from nothing but lies
When you die, you will know who is right
