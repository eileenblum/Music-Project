Life, a picture of frustrating reality
Oppression surrounding the masses
He who has the power tends to be corrupt 
What the hell, it's business as usual

War and murder in the name of God
Manipulations under the name of religions
Fraud in conspiracies for gaining profits
Those religious persons commit crimes everyday
Leave us here, they warp our perceptions
Hatred slowly grows in our hearts
Feeling hurt in the most delicate way
Screaming in a rage at those hypocrisies

Looking a place for our feet to show them
"We are not like you"
They are on God's side, so we are on the other
Does it make sense?
Minds are blind for the mistakes taken in hating hypocrisy
In fact we're all the victims of our hatred

Under the influence of sin, there is no way to live
an ideal life by our own strength
Religion hurts, but God will never let us down
Find the way in Him
