Now as I walk through the scenes of disruption,
I see the dying of our generation
Adolescents are trapped, bound by chains of sin
Live as the living dead, putrefy until total death
Not to be the fools of the dark
who are deceived by father of the lies

Life goes on, the Earth still spinning around
But one day it shall be vanished,
be reduced to ashes as destruction comes
No hope or no mercy for the putrefied ones
Not to be the fools of the dark
who are deceived by father of the lies

We don't want to follow,
don't want to be the rotting youth
[2x]
Leave the scenes and follow Christ
