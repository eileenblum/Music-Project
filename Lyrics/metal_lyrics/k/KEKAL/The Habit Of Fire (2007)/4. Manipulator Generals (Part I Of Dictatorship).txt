Dictatorship...
We are the untouchables
Governmental system manipulators
Architects of power over people
Creators of laws and constitutions
Now we can freak you out
Suck you in, crush you down
And we can change the pace of your social motions
We are generals of corrupt nation
Put order that is within our hands
The absolutes of obstinacy
With weapons on our side we rule
Failure is the system
Power is in control
Now we can burn your home
Take your rights out, execute you
And then you will disappear from the surface of our land
