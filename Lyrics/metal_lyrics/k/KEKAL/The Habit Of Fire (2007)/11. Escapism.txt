[Movement I - WHAT ON EARTH AM I HERE FOR?]

What on Earth am I here for?
Trapped in this piercing circumstance
With no sign of hope to pull through
A nation full of parasites
And you don't know how much I hate this place
With countless sad stories of failed survivals
Every step is a miracle
I can't exist for no reason
Where there is a faith, there is a way
It is my own test of guts and brain
Finding out how, in plan for my escape
Leaving this place as far as I could get

[Movement II - THE HABIT OF FIRE]

I have let myself floating away
My mind drifts out from my head
To look behind all these closed doors
Something seemingly unreachable
As I manage to move out, silently
From the community of hypocrites
My plan for escape is getting stronger
I should not belong here, anymore
They have failed to spot me
Refused to join me
They will never see me
No way to stop me
Reaching out for another day
Marching on, pass without a sound
Time has come to approach an ideal state
Where passion will finally get its proper place
Taking one good chance worth dying for
Never turn around
Fire is within me, I shall overcome
But it has never been an easy way
Each step I take requires a mature plan
And a bit of faith

[Movement III - SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS]

[Movement IV - A ROAD ABOVE, A ROAD AHEAD]

Appended pathways;
You never know their end,
so we make one speculating choice
A route to somewhere
I left my past behind,
To greet a hazy form of future
Taking a step as I walk...
Trip of significance
They took 40 years to freedom,
Wonder when I will get mine?
A faith so clear now
Either use it waive it or leave it,
Yet we all know we always need it
Hurting my knees as I crawl...

[Movement V - FINDING A WAY TO STAND UP AGAIN]

A road above, a road ahead
And I shall never stop believing
In such a mode to recuperate
Future is given, but choice is mine,
To find a way to stand up again
