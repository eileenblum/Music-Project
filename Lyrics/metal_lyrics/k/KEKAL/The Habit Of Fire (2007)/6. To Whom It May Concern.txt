Anyone, could you see the pain that dwells inside of me
To whom it may concern: I ask for justice, even in a small piece
If I had lived in this place since its inception
I would see...
All the process of degradation, what a waste!
Thousand years, yet we see nothing
Not even a thing to be to be proud of
Always cling to our past fortune
But that was made by our forefathers
Does anyone care?
Enough of this hell
Fading solemnly to obscurity!
If you had lived in this place since its inception
You would see....
All this process of deterioration
