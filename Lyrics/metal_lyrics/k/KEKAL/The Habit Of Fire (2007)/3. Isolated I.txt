You are knocking at my private door
Yes, you - the shadow of my very soul
A covert companion in my part of darkness
No common world-light shall connote to illuminate me
Together, we travel into my deepest realm
Together, we invert the law of material bliss
I don't need fake sympathy
Let my world spins, I will not be there to care
I will remain isolated
Until the coming of my time
I have my 'truest identity'
And the real side of me will be kept off-surface
I am here but they will never see me
It is no matter what if they would call me insane
Together, we laugh at the every day's issues
Together, we seek for pleasures of a loner
I don't need fake sympathy
Let my world spins, I will not be there to care
I will remain isolated
Until the coming of my time
