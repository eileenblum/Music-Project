We are part of the mass
Post-industrial working class
Empowered by commands to be
The Black Ants assembly
I feel trapped
here within their system
as the workforce
Diligent and industrious
Voluntarily focused
Disciplinary in-use
Slaves of this modern world
Beyond reasonable doubt
Strains coincide with fear
Harder still to make a will
and sacrifice our surviving-selves
Here; our lives on their hands as an asset
Stagnation; walks in circular direction
Lack of inclination
Self-induced submission
Undisputable fracture
Tracking to consequence
Aging to reluctance
A hell of industry...
