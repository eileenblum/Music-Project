A challenging task out from the mind of the visionaire:
Recalling all melodies created in those dreams
Cathartic responses popping out from the nerves
Through this musical kind of free association
I have tried to submit, to submerge to the system
But something inside me wanting me to be insane!
Is it the message from outer space?
No, I think it's just me tired of everything
Here is the moment to break free
Free to express our deepest thoughts
Now is the time to elaborate all those past hesitations
Into something lunatic, but awfully honest!
Here is the moment to break free
And bring all these fresh storms of brain
Now is the time to give some edge
Fighting against the guardians of mediocrity
