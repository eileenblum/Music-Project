Watching a domino effect
Linear sequence produced through time
Continual route of tumbling down
To reach the point of total mess
Linkage to country's past troubles
Now bear the consequence
This mentality will not improve
Corrupt mind stays in place
Right here, right now, a truth to face
The wheel of time waits for no one
So many years have lost in vain
I wonder, how to stop the rust
Linkage to country's past troubles
Now bear the consequence
This mentality will not improve
Fruitless deeds stay in place
Patterns repeated
Under a state of mind
A bleak outlook of political course
One new breed of dictatorship is expected
