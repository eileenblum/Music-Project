Seeing the world, right from different angle
Happy as it seems, but it is not
Just take off its clothes you will see the fear
The fear I need to talk about right now
In reality, no place for pessimist
But a pessimist is sure a pragmatist
"There is no use to fix the world
All we do is to watch it falls"
Self-help books are still selling a lot
A sign of us, that desperately need aid
Religions are rising rapidly
Into a state of irrationality
Any chance to heal the world?
All we clearly see its fall
One war ends, another begins
You are crushed, yet life goes on...
One piece of action, ten pieces of reactions
Contradictions will rise, waves shall emerge
Surrender to the system is not an option
Fear only makes us die
Hesitation kills our survival instinct
