humankind of an equal essence
should be given equal participation
equal access to information and knowledge
be part of open society in an open world
one portal that fits everyoneâs expressions
eliminating hierarchies within social construction
and to cease governmental interference
in order to achieve preservation of neutrality
absolute power corrupts absolutely
realization of an ideal should be done collectively
information sharing as a part of contributive mindset
but this will always challenge our human nature
elimination of self is the one most effortful condition
in a society where the most popular act is to play god
