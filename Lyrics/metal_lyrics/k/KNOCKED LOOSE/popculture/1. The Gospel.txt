Bury me, I'm counting down the days
I like the way you stand with God when you're too afraid
You'll spend your whole life running, and you'll still end up with nothing
But I've washed my sins in the blood of Jesus
Bury you 'til it fucking hurts, but I don't want to be a member of your fucking church
Tell me, why are Christians so accepting of death?
Does that mean that I don't believe in God?
'Cause I'm not ready to leave yet
No I'm not ready to die at all
But you, you've got it all figured out
You're counting down the days, but what makes you so certain you're the one to be saved?
'Cause let me tell you, love like this must cost and arm and a fucking leg
Because my tongue will not move, no matter how hard I beg
