I was born by the river, dirty and mean
Learned how to fight for everything that I need
You try and you lose
A game called life just another day
Being born on the wrong side
Who the fuck is this?
Another try hard, boring, same outlook, same story
But I've seen it too many times
You are not one of a kind
This is what separates the boys from the men
You are not like me, you are just like them
Weak and distraught, you don't fucking know me
Fingertips and ears in my trophy case
Just another victim
I refuse to be a part of your try hard system
All of these men are just boys
Separate them, take them out, do whatever to replace them
It's getting harder to sleep, I've been gritting my teeth
They want an easy way out, but have never seen the streets
Whether you die on your feet or on your knees, at this point you should take what you can fucking get
You are the wrong side of the hill, where snow doesn't melt
You are a fucking waste of space, just waiting for hell
