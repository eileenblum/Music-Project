I dwell above the sea of flames,

I dwell,
Above the sea of flames,
Waiting for the moment,
When my harness breaks,
And I burn,
Burn like my idols,

Nothing is pure,
No nothing at all,

Reality hurts,
My demons stripped from the earth,
Connected by flesh,
That I'm not comfortable in,
It wasn't me but it should've been,

I lost a stranger,
And my heart is crushed,

No longer blind,
To deaths cold touch,
No longer hurt,
Just scared to burn,
Like the rest,

All my heroes went to hell.
