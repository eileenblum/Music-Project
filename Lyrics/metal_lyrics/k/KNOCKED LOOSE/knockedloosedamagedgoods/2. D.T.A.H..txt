Did you think of that all by yourself
Or was it somebody else?
Did you read it on the Internet?
I can't believe that you don't get it yet
Grow up

I have no hope for this world
Kill em all

You are a bad liar
A snake, a hypocrite, a fake
"Shut your fucking mouth"
Bad liar

I have no hope for this world

All the bodies
Stack em' high, stack em high
You don't belong here
This is my fucking house
&amp; you're just a cancer that refuses to leave

The tree of life bears no fruit
Unless it's rotten to the fucking core
