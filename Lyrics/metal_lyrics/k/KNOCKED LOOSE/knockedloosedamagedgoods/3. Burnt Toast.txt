Underneath the surface of my skin
There is nothing
Cause I won't let anyone in
I've got you stuck between my teeth
I'll spit you out
I'll spit you out but you won't get away from me

Ball and chain, cut me loose
Ready to die
Head in the noose

Set me free

&amp; I've been through hell and back
With these chains around my feet
These chains, won't break
I need you to set me free

I live for you
&amp; it's miserable at most
You see freedom
Like I see Jesus in burnt toast
