&amp; if I'm filthy let me be

Let me wear his skin
What makes me less then him?

Self conscious, admit it
You're just stuck behind an image
&amp; these kids, they need a gimmick
I don't get it [2x]

&amp; if I'm filthy, let me be filthy
Dirty &amp; haggard, always guilty
I'm way too down on myself
No matter how much it hurts
&amp; I am stuck forever
Trapped inside this damned Earth
