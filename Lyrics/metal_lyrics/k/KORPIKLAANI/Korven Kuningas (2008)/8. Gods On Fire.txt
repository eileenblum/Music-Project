The snow failed to appear,
This year the winter never begun,
Furious storms keep raging,
Nature shows her powers,
Her revenge will be cruel,
Now it's time to pacify our deeds
Against her,
And hope we still have some time butt...

Seems like it's too late
And cannot appease
Gods are on fire
Gods are on fire
They won't lend a hand
What is done, is done

We burned all our bridges,
We thought, we have lot of time,
We dicided to leave our debts,
To our children,
Perhaps they are richer,
But there was something we disregarded,
The nature is in us and all the time,
We were hanging ourselves with our own rope,
We are not goin' to see the kids...

But it's too late
And cannot appease
Gods are on fire
Gods are on fire
They won't lend a hand
What is done, is done
