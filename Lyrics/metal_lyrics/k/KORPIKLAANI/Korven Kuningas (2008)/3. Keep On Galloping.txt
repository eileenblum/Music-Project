Keep on galloping
my black horse
carrying me
to unknown shores
through these outlandish woods
and with confidence back home

LennÃ¤, laukkaa heposeni,
lennÃ¤, laukkaa hallavaharja,
kiiÃ¤ halki kangasmaitten,
murjo poikki pientareitten,
kanna minnuu maailmalla,
kulettele kuskiasi,
nÃ¤ytÃ¤ kaikki nÃ¤htÃ¤vyyet,
uuet maat ja uuet paikat.
[English translation:]
My horsey, keep on galloping
My shadow, keep on flying.
Rush over moorlands,
Break through banks.
Carry me around the world,
Take your rider with you.
Show me all the sights,
Show me new countries and new places.

MikÃ¤s tÃ¤ss' on matkatessa,
mikÃ¤s tÃ¤ss' on elellessÃ¤,
kaikkee saam mie matkav' varrelt',
kaikkee mitÃ¤ tarvittenki.
Paljon nÃ¤hty maailmalla,
paljon vielÃ¤ nÃ¤htÃ¤vÃ¤tÃ¤,
monta maita minun mennÃ¤,
Kuulla noita tarinoita.
[English translation:]
I have a good time traveling here,
I have a good time living here.
I get everything along my journey,
I get everything I need.
There's so much everything in the world,
There's so much to see.
There's so many places to be
To hear those hoofs.

Laulan, tanssin, soiton soitan,
revin riemun nÃ¤istÃ¤ teistÃ¤,
nÃ¤istÃ¤ teistÃ¤, elÃ¤mÃ¤stÃ¤
tÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ PohjantÃ¤hen pÃ¤Ã¤ssÃ¤ .
TÃ¤Ã¤l' on miun kotopaikka,
tÃ¤Ã¤ on reissun pÃ¤Ã¤tepiste,
heposeni tallipaikka,
liinaharjan syntysija
[English translation:]
Singing, dancing, playing my song
I enjoy my life along this road.
My life so sweet along this road,
Here at the end of the North Star.
Here's my home,
Here the road ends.
Here's the stable of my horse,
Here was born my silver haired mount.

Keep on galloping
my black horse
carrying me
to unknown shores
through these outlandish woods
and with confidence back home
...back home
