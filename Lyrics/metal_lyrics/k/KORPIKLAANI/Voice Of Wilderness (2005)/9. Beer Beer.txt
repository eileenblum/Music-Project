From evening to morning
And morning to evening
I wanna drink
Something stronger than a man
From evening to morning
And morning to evening
I wanna drink
Cause that's what I am
Beer, beer
I want beer
From beer I get really drunk
Beer, beer
I need more beer
So much I pass out
For beer I'm working
For beer I'm fighting
For beer I'll do
Whatever I have to
When drunk I'm talking
When drunk I'm joking
When drunk I can be as I've
Always wanted to be
