Huntin is going on
we are a part of the wilderness

Hunting is going on
only the fast will survive
in the forest we prowl
looking hard for deers
Hunger croaks in our stomachs
our eyes like the wolves'

We run after meat as the possessed
and we kill without pity
we rejoice and we laugh when the deer falls
hunting's more than just killing for the food.

Hunting is going on
we are a part of the wilderness

Hunting is going on
only the fast will survive
Away they will not get, those four legged
not even the smallest one
we live in the forest here only fast ones live
only strongest will survive
