I was born in a deep forest
I wish I could live here all my life
I am made from stones and roots
My home, these woods and roads

All my life I loved this sound
Of the woods all around
Eagles flies where the winds blows free
Journey is my destiny

Free, free as a journey man
Feel, heat in the moonlight
Free, free as a journey man
Feel, heat in the moonlight

Ragged trousers, rucksack in my back
Narrow road behind me
I never look back
Long way is in the past
As in front of me
Hunger keeps me going
I don't care where it leads
Fire burns under my feet
Journey men pleasure and destiny
Sky is black, stars shows me the way
Moon whispered how to keep my faith

Free, free as a journey man
Feel, heat in the moonlight

Free, free as a journey man
Feel, heat in the moonlight

Free, free as a journey man
Feel, heat in the moonlight

Free, free as a journey man
Feel, heat in the moonlight
