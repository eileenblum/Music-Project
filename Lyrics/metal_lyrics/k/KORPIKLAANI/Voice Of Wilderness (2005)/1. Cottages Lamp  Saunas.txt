Attack forward you Nordic boy
Fire to the balls
Attack without fear through the enemy lines
Attack and let it burn
Here we had built our cottages and saunas
From the swamp we have shovelled our fields
Nobody can take it away from us
Not for free, and that's for sure

[Chorus:]
Here we had built our cottages and saunas
From the swamp we have shovelled our fields
Nobody can take it away from us
Not for free, an that's for sure

[Chorus]

We eat iron, we shit the chain
We never let them live
Gunfire pounded night after night
Ant then all was quit here
We saw the forest full of bodies
Nobody could escaped
And horses' carcasses among with the bodies
And everywhere there burnt

[Chorus x5]
