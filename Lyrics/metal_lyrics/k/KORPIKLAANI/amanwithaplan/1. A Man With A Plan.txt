(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

When I first set myself on the road,
I was stunned by sights untold,
By the sea and across the lands,
With a calming drink in hand!

Italian way, grappa grappa hey!
Deutschland lager, Ã¼ber alles!
If Aquavit left me feeling bleak,
A pint of bitter will make me cheers!

(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I'm a man with a plan!
The plan is to booze as much as I can!
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I will be this way, until the fall of my final day!

(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I'm a man with a plan!
The plan is to booze as much as I can!
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I will be this way, until the fall of my final day!

Spirits are high tonight,
Mostly of bottled kind!
Our clan is gathered here,
And the plan is loud and clear!

Everyone in full swing,
Brothers of kin will attempt to "sing"!
No one cares what tomorrow brings,
And the sauna burns down again!

(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I'm a man with a plan!
The plan is to booze as much as I can!
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I will be this way, until the fall of my final day!

(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I'm a man with a plan!
The plan is to booze as much as I can!
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
I will be this way, until the fall of my final day!

(Hey Hey Hey!)
(Hey Hey Hey!)
I'm a man with a plan!
(Hey Hey Hey!)
I'm a man with a plan!

(Hey Hey Hey!)
(Hey Hey Hey!)
(Push it!)
(Hey Hey Hey!)
(Hey Hey Hey!)
