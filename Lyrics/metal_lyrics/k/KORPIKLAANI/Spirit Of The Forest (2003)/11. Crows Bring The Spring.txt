End of the Winter
End of the coldness
End of the day
Crows come to this forest
Flies through this woods
Over the dark water
Where ice will die soon
Winter surrenders finally
Spring rises it's wings
Unleash sun's burning flames
Bring warmth with crows
Reveals stones from the snow
You can see the snow
On the mountain tops
And brook's to the sea
Soon sun rises over the hills

[Chorus:]
Endless sky burning red
Purple clouds touch the top of the high mountain
And in the wind I hear those crows
They bring the spring
And take the cold away
