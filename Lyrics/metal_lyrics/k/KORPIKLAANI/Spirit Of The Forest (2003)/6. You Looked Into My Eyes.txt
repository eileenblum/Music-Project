We are here alone
Only the camp fire
Shines on your face
I touched your hand
But you disappeared
As the smoke the air

[Chorus:]
You looked into my eyes
You have me hypnotized
And I do what you want to

We are here alone
Only the moon
And wolves are with us
Fire swallowed
You and your hair were ablazed
But you still laughed loud
I'm alone again
And old pine tree
Asked me, where's your woman?
I said: Shut up
Or I make of you another
Firewood

[Chorus]
