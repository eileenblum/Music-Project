[Music &amp; Lyrics: Jonne JÃ¤rvelÃ¤]

If you can hear the whisper of the wind
And the words of the woods

If you can hear the whisper of the wind
And the words of the woods

Then you'll find your way,
Out of the dark to the other side of shroud,
Away from the shroud of mystery,
Away from the shroud of mist

If you have the lasting happiness
And the peace in your heart

If you have the lasting happiness
And the peace in your heart

Then you have to hide your riches
From the hungry hunters,
Away from the filthy animals,
Out of snakes' reach
