Growing up with the wild bears
Breathing the smell of burning wood
Rain and clouds my only friends
Sun and moon and stars and light

Now it's time of a midnight sun
The eternal light and a breathing night
Call the gods with bones and drum
Join the shaman's magic

[Chorus 1]

Flames are dancing in the night
The shadows seem to be alive
The forest is calling my name

[Chorus 2]

Flames are fading in the dawn
The spirits are back to their world
I've seen the future and it's good
