He sees himself as the saviour of the world
His will is strong and he's feeling good

Ive known him since the first taste of beer
I will meet him many times in a year

Happy little, Happy little, Happy little boozer...

He thinks he is the most famous guy
He smiles and laughs and he has a loud voice

He can be very nice he can be full of anger
He'll behave very well, right after misbehaving
