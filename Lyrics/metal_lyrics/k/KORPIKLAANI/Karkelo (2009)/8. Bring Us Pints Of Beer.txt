Bring us pints of beer
If you dont't drink, you can leave
Bring us pints of beer
We gonna drink now and here

We've been around the world
We've devoured endless roads
We've seen many towns,
Can't remember all of those

Sometimes it's so hard
But we can't change ourselves
We are the journeymen
And born to live this way

Bring us pints of beer
If you don't drink, you can leave,
Bring us pints of beer
We gonna drink now and here

We don't know about real work
We might not be good-looking
This is the only song we know
These are the cards for us

Comfort from bottles,
Cheers form beers
The guitars are our weapons
And we know how to kill
So...

Bring us pints of beer...
