VODKA,VODKA, VODKA, VODKA!
Hey!

Vodka, you're feeling stronger
Vodka, no more feeling bad
Vodka, your eyes are shining
Vodka, you are the real MAN
Vodka, wipes away your tears
Vodka, removes your fears
Vodka, everyone is gorgeous
Vodka, yeah vodka

[Chorus:]
Drinking is good for you, soon you are unconstrained
Drinking is good for you, here comes the womanizer
Drinking is good for you, not anymore lonesome
Drinking is good for you, and you will feel awesome
And you will feel awesome.

Out of respect for nature, our vodka and drinkers.
Promising that the vodka we serve is as pure as it was thousands of years ago
