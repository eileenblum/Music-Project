Pelto palo,
loimo nieli viljatÃ¤hkÃ¤t,
ulenhenki tarpahutti,
roihu raiskas' rukkiin varret.

KÃ¤vi kato kauhistava,
kurja onni kammottava,
menetyski musertava
turha sao, masentava.

Kump' ei iskis' LiekkiÃ¶inen,
lostais' karu meltohenki!
Kump' ei iskis LiekkiÃ¶inen,
muistas' ilikijÃ¤inen!

LeivÃ¤n leivon leppÃ¤sestÃ¤,
hongsar' revin ravintoni,
kÃ¤rsin nÃ¤ljÃ¤n nÃ¤rimÃ¤llÃ¤
vuotan uutta kylvÃ¶kautta

Kump' ei iskis' LiekkiÃ¶inen,
lostais' karu meltohenki!
Kump' ei iskis LiekkiÃ¶inen,
muistas' ilikijÃ¤inen!

[English translation:]

The Revenge Of LiekkiÃ¶

Whole crop burned to ashes.
Flames swallowed the spikes.
Fire spirit trampled on.
Blaze raped the rye straws.

Harvest was appalling.
Back luck hit hard.
Loss was shattering.
Worthless crop, depressing.

This is the stroke of LiekkiÃ¶
A black revenge of the fire spirit.
This is the stroke of LiekkiÃ¶
Reminder from the evil one.

I make my breda drom alder.
I tear my food fro pine trees.
I will not surrender to hunger.
I will wait for the next growing season.

This is the stroke of LiekkiÃ¶
A black revenge of the fire spirit.
This is the stroke of LiekkiÃ¶
Reminder from the evil one

[Korpiklaani note:
One of the most important features in ancient Finnish agrarian culture was the underground fire of growth. One of its manifestations was the fire spirit LiekkiÃ¶. Fire of growth helped the grain to grow and made a good harvest. In this song the protagonist has forgotten the rites and beliefs of growing grain, which turns the positive fire of growth into negative and destroys the entire harvest.]
