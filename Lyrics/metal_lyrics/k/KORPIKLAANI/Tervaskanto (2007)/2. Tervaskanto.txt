[English translation:]

Resinous Stump

Great old man, steady as a rock
The eternal untamable hero.
The guardian of the forests.
Keeps his eye in the wetlands.

He has seen it all, he has heard it all.
He knows it all, he is the master of ot all.
But still he has a lot to see, to experience and to hear

Resin-like blood in his veins.
Hair like spruce needles.

He had seen it all, heard it all, known it all.
He ha mastered it all, seen it all, heard it all.
He had known it all, mastered it all, seen it all.
He had heard it all, known it all, mastered it all.

He has seen the th was.
The battles in his backyard.
He saw the years of hunger.
He lived through the famines.

He has seen it all, he has heard it all.
He knows it all, he is the master of ot all.
But still he has a lot to see, to experience and to hear

It wil take many more years
until the death carries the stump away.

He had seen it all, heard it all, known it all.
He ha mastered it all, seen it all, heard it all.
He had known it all, mastered it all, seen it all.
He had heard it all, known it all, mastered it all.

The age of nine heroes.
Has lived the old man.
His roots in the frozen ground.
Hardening his back skin

He has seen it all, he has heard it all.
He knows it all, he is the master of ot all.
But still he has a lot to see, to experience and to hear

He has seen it all, he has heard it all.
He knows it all, he is the master of ot all.
But still he has a lot to see, to experience and to hear

He had seen it all, heard it all, known it all.
He ha mastered it all, seen it all, heard it all.
He had known it all, mastered it all, seen it all.
He had heard it all, known it all, mastered it all

[Korpiklaani note:
Tervaskanto is not just a stump of a tree, but also a metaphor for an experienced old man, who knows about all aspects of life. All around the Fenno-Ugric language area man has always associated himself with a tree. This can be seen in the significance of for example the wooden seitas of the Sami people or the sacred garden trees of the ancient Finns.]
