Tahtomattamme synnyimmy,
synnyimme turvat urmeess' vuotaen,
vuotaen syksyisnÃ¤ sateena,
sateena, verestÃ¤ni mustan.

PunasilmÃ¤mme hohkavat,
hohkavat korvain lÃ¤pi Ã¤Ã¤net,
Ã¤Ã¤, huudot ja kirkukna,
kirkuna ilikiÃ¤n naurun.

Me veriset Ã¤pÃ¤rÃ¤iset,
ihtiriekit ikevÃ¤iset,
korven karkien kÃ¤tkÃ¶issÃ¤
matkammiestÃ¤ metsÃ¤stÃ¤mme.

Oli isÃ¤llÃ¤mme tuuria,
tuuria vahingoksi Ã¤idin,
Ã¤idon kantavaksi saatetun,
saatetun, hÃ¤piÃ¤ksi kaikkien.

PimeydessÃ¤ me kÃ¤rsimme,
kÃ¤rsimme aina jos on tarvis,
tarvis kallotuopist' juopa,
juopa matkalaisten kiusaksi.

Me veriset Ã¤pÃ¤rÃ¤iset,
ihtiriekit ikevÃ¤iset,
korven karkien kÃ¤tkÃ¶issÃ¤
matkammiestÃ¤ metsÃ¤stÃ¤mme.

[English translation:]

Bloody Bastard Children

We were born against our will.
We were born with bloddy faces.
Bleeding like an autumn rain.
A rain, black from blood.

Our eyes flaming red.
Echoes through our ears.
Voices, cries and screams.
Screams of evil laughter.

We are the bloody bastard chldren.
We are crying ihitiriekkos.
Hiding in the rough forest.
Hunting the travelers.

Our father got lucky.
His luck was misfortune for our mother.
Our mother impregnated..
Disgrace for everyone.

In the darkness we suffer.
Suffer if we have to.
Have to get drunk from the skull.
To get drunk to tease the travelers.

We are the bloody bastard chldren.
We are crying ihitiriekkos.
Hiding in the rough forest.
Hunting the travelers

[Korpiklaani note:
Ihtiriekko was the ghost of a dead child screaming terribly in the dark forest. In the past it was quite common to get rid of unwanted illegitimate children by just killing them and abandoning them in the forest.]
