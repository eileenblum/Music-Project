The skies that once shined blue for us
Were overwhelmed by a cold night.
A tempest rises and tears us apart,
With thunder and lightning it swallows all light!

We're on the edge to lose it all,
Less than a step and we will fall.
Through the seas of clouds we dive
Before in sanity we arrive.

All last years they made us sad,
Hope their conscience now makes them mad.
Soon we'll be awaken with all our grief taken
The wind of change rushes your hair
And blows away what was so rare

We're on the edge, weâre on the edge to lose it all,
Less than a step and we will fall
Through the seas; through the seas of clouds we dive
Before in sanity we arrive.
Every minute we waste is a minute too much,
We waste no more time leading this life.

Every minute we waste is a minute too much,
We waste no more time living this hell!
A final look into your eyes,
They're full of love and freed from lies
To eternity we rise...
