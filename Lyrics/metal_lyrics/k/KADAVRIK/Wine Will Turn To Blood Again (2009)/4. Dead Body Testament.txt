Should I open a maggot ranch?
Or better choose the death in fire?
Epically burned in the middle of a lake
Like a true heavy metal sire.
I donât really care what happens to my body
It will vanish, burn or rot.
But the funeral should be really odd -
I wrote it down!

What to do in the end?
Itâs all in my dead body testament.
Just my hull without a soul,
Beyond the grave thereâs no control.
No one knows what will be:
Eternal sorrow or serenity?
Eating grapes in paradise,
Or being barbecued for all the lies?

Itâs all in my dead body testament.
So do your bloody work!

If you want just lay me down in flora
And see what faunaâs doing to me.
Flesh flies will claim my body
So just like in life it will be.
I donât really care what happens to my body
It will vanish, burn or rot.
But there are some lines in my testament
Saying it should be odd.

What to do in the end?
Itâs all in my dead body testament.
Just my hull without a soul
Beyond the grave thereâs no control.
No one knows what will be:
Eternal sorrow or serenity?
Eating grapes in paradise,
Or being barbecued for all the lies?

Itâs all in my dead body testament.
So do your bloody work!
I know that you will be creative
Whatever youâre gonna choose.
Conserve me in a bottle of liquor.
A tasty booze with the color of ooze!
So keep my corpse for the upcoming shows.
Thatâs a lot more striking than a pigâs head.
Every eye will be caught:
The first band member dead!

What to do in the end?
Itâs all in my dead body testament

No one knows what will be:
Eternal sorrow or serenity?
Eating grapes in paradise,
Or being barbecued for all the lies?

Dead body testament
No one knows what will be:
Eternal pain or serenity?
