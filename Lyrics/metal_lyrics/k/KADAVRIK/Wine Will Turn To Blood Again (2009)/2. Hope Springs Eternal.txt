Just one night to change our lives,
To turn us into different people,
Turn us into murderers,
To send us all to hell!
It was quite a thrill - no doubt -
But once a lifetime's yet too much.
In my mind the screams -so loud -
Will never disappear!
Hope springs eternal!
This burden is a piercing pain
Forever on our mind
And all hope is in vain.
In fear we're bleeding,
For punishment praying.
Catharsis through death,
Not through our conscience decaying!
Floating on lakes of liquor,
Horizons shined bloodred.
"Who's man enough to kill a man
And who will not regret?
We're drunk, we're friends,
Never will they get us -
We take this to our graves,
'Till then our mind enslaves us!"

Hope springs eternal!
This burden is a piercing pain
Forever on our mind
And all hope is in vain.
In fear we're bleeding,
For punishment praying.
Catharsis through death,
Not through our conscience decaying!

"No! break the silence!
We are here to create our fate!
We should smile and think of better days
And let disappear the blade.
No one never ever say a word!
Hopeless springs eternal -
This night remains unheard"

He just walked by,
The blade shined bright, it lit our sight
âAlcohol our friendly guide,
Good idea - hell yeah!- alright!"
His flesh swallowed the blade,
Cut his throat, he squeals so loud,
Sorry, Mr. Noonenknows, sorry Mr. Neverfound!
Never we had hope in life,
From now on we are different.
It's no luck but my first hope
To get rid of my inner strife.
âSurrenderâ is an evil word,
But just faint hearts try to hide.
Still, being found won't help to find
A way to relieve our mind!
In fear we're bleeding,
For punishment praying.
Catharsis through death,
Not through our conscience decaying!
