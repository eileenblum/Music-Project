Once I saw a weak man standing right in front of me.
He was crippled, frail and his dark eyes I couldn't see.
His feet could hardly keep him up, he almost fell,
Four words he whispered: I go to hell!
Something you did wrong!
"Life has made me weak."
He goes on: "Once I was strong."
- I don't care, I'm not that aware!

A failed man you are,
You have gone too far.
Calm down take a rest
to take some weight of your chest!
Hero you'll never be.
The sky you'll never see.
Calm down take a rest
To take some weight of your chest!
There is no more to take,
Give your heart a break!
The failed man you are
Pushed it too far.
Calm down take a rest
To take some weight of your chest!
Hero you'll never be.
The sky you'll never see.
Calm down take a rest
To take some weight of your chest!
Run out of life!
Self-destructive drive!

Please come down and take a rest
To take some weight of your chest!
Realize you've gone too far!
Maybe it is not too late to try to escape your fate,
But the sky you'll never see!
Look at you! Take one good look!
In half a year your nothing more than dust is.
If you ask me: This is Justice!
You look like a living scarecrow with bottle of strong rum.
Your skin fells like a piece of paper - what have you become?
There is more alcohol than life in your veins.
Your flesh taints!

You have pierced a bleeding hole
Into the beauty of your soul.
Please come down and take a rest
To take some weight of your chest!
Realize you've gone too far!
Maybe it is not too late to try to escape your fate,
But the sky you'll never see!
I feel glass instead of skin
When I try to take your hand.
In your face I see a grin,
In this mirror all I see
A skeleton of what once was me!
