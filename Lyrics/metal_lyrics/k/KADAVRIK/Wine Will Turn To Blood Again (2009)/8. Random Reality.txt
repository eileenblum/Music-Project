Born by hazard, driven by chaos,
Killed by the undefined
Random reality!
Thereâs no justice, only coincidence,
Prayers remain unheard,
The strong dictate the fate.

Blame someone for misfortune
Accuse! â Punish! â Kill!
All we needâs a scapegoat
Responsible for misery.

Losing grip on reality
In a world man cannot see.
If everything is meaningless
Letâs seek to kill â seek to kill!
Losing grip on reality.
Are you the one to bleed?
For the course of history
Letâs seek to kill â seek to kill!

Born by hazard, driven by chaos,
Killed by the undefined
A random reality!
Thereâs no system, no structure, no plan!
But we need a guilty man we can indict and hate.

So who`s the scapegoat?
Just roll the dice of fate.
The gods of chaos
Will show us whom to slay.

Our violence needs a valve!
Kill!

Born by hazard, Driven by chaos,
Killed by the undefined
A random reality!
No explanation for death and misery.
We canât accept this! Victims of insanity!

Losing grip on reality (So who`s the scapegoat?)
Are you the one to bleed? (Just roll the dice of fate)
For the course of history (The gods of chaos)
Show us whom to slay in this random reality!
