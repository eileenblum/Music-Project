Iâm with him, heâs the evil inside
Iâve lost you, but it was not me!

In my mind Iâm not alone
There is someone with me
Strangest faces he has shown
Will he ever set me free?
Itâs wasting all I ever had
This voice beside my own
I wish I cried and showed regret
But he is me and Iâm alone!

Feeling so strange, thoughts have gone wild
Feeling so weird, someone else is guiding me!
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
I kill you, my voice inside
Yes, Iâll shoot myself!
Someone else is guiding me!
You wonât break me!
You wonât break me!
You wonât break me!
I will break you!
You wonât break me!
I will break you!
I kill you, my voice inside
Yes, Iâll shoot ourselves!

In my mind Iâm not alone
There is someone with me
Strangest faces he has shown
Will he ever set me free?
Itâs wasting all I ever had
This voice beside my own
I wish I cried and showed regret
But he is me and Iâm alone!
