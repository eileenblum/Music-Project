My feet are numb and cold
Frozen flesh turns blue and black
âCause winters fist rose up
To hold me down
Hold me back from you
Away from here, far away from my dear
Snow and ice, my biggest fear
Cried far more than one tear
Please donât let my heart freeze
I regret! Cryophobia!
Warm me! â He wonât!
Melt the icecold winterâs grave!
You freeze? â I do!
Wait for your icecold winterâs grave!

Frost, you freeze my heart
Which breaks apart
Resurrect me!
Snow like a shroud on my mind
You shall just find
An icy rose
Where icewind blows

So cold, âcause winterâs fist rose up
To hold me down
Hold me back from you
Away from here, far away from my dear
Snow and ice, my biggest fear
Cried far more than one tear
Please donât let my heart freeze
I regret! Cryophobia!

Cryophobia!
Warm me! â He wonât!
Melt the icecold winterâs grave!
You freeze? â I do!
Wait for your icecold winterâs grave!
