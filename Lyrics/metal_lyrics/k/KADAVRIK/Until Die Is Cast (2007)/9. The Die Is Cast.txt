Gun in my neck
Men dressed in black
Iâm digging grave â âJust a troughâ
No this is for my funeral
My skin is wet, the tears, the blood, the sweat
In despair I cry as I could not say goodbye
To the ones I love, but I will from above
Glimpse of hope drowned in the mud
Did I hear a shot?

Rain from the sky
Where I will lie
On my own â so alone
Yes, I will forever and ever
I will be strafed
At Asburyâs Ave
The die is cast, I will not last
âTill the break of dawn!

Losing my track with this gun in my neck
Iâm digging grave â âNot deep enoughâ
God, I need a miracle!
My skin is wet, the tears, the blood, the sweat
In despair I cry as I could not say goodbye
To the ones I love, but I will from above
Glimpse of hope drowned in the mud
Did I hear a shot?

Rain from the sky
Where I will lie
On my own â so alone
Yes, I will forever and ever
I will be strafed
At Asburyâs Ave
The die is cast, I will not last
âTill the break of dawn!
The die is cast!

Rain from the sky
Where I will lie
On my own â so alone
Yes, I will forever and ever
I will be strafed
At Asburyâs Ave
The die is cast, I will not last
âTill the break of dawn!
Then I heard a shotâ¦
