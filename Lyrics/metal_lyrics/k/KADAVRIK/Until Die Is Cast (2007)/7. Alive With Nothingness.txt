Raging fist smashes innocent face
Iâm helpless in their brutality maze
Alive with nothingness!

The pain of others is your only way to feel above
Your violence helped me to believe in an evil god
Far beyond enlightment your perverted values rape my ideal
Torturing the poisoned world I once wished to heal!

The hateful declare: Rise of stupidity
Their rusty blades slice the roots of humanity
Alive with nothingness!

The illusion behalf charity is just another tale
Forgotten in the depths of hate, youâve chosen the dark trail
You destroy what I create, your only sense in life
Is to trample down for what I fight, and hail the savage drive!

Born in the dark
On the side
Whereâs no guiding light
Seek for a sense and find disgrace
I should feel sorry!

The pain of others is your only way to feel above
Your violence helped me to believe in an evil god
Alive with nothingness you have to go your way
Leading to hell on earth, not catching any ray of hope!
Alive with nothingness!
