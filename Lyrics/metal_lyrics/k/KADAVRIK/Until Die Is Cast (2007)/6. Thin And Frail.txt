So feet deep in the soil there is their hidden home
Outcasts of society, now living on their own!
Desperados under cities, no one really cares âbout rights
You wouldnât care if you were one who for survival fights!

Who knows where they live?
Who knows who they are?
Malformed and so pale
Malnourished, thin and frail
Thin and frail!
Thin and frail is what they are
They live in hell underneath
What seems to be the perfect world
Where total peace is the law
Who knows where they live?
Who knows who they are?
Malformed and so pale
Malnourished, thin and frail

Children fall into the mud right from their motherâs womb
Their lives are rested wretched and quickly end in their dark tomb
Their skin is cold and pale, as they never saw the light
Forever banned down there in the eternal night!

Who knows where they live?
Who knows who they are?
Malformed and so pale
Malnourished, thin and frail
Thin and frail!
Thin and frail is what they are
They live in hell underneath
What seems to be the perfect world
Where total peace is the law
One day they will come up!
One day theyâll take revenge!
This is the day we fail
Though they are the thin and frail

One day they will come up!
One day theyâll take revenge!
This is the day we fail
Though they are the thin and frail
Thin and frail!
Thin and frail is what they are
They live in hell underneath
What seems to be the perfect world
Where total peace is the law
One day they will come up!
One day theyâll take revenge!
This is the day we fail
Though they are the thin and frail
Thin and frail!
