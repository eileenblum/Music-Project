The morning after all
Sick abuse of alcohol
A pleasant gift and party all night
And all the lights have shined so bright

But I lost all my control
Baptized in alcohol
Put me into rage
My mind has left its cage
Former friends told me what Iâve done
Lost all my control
Baptized in alcohol
I hurt them, I know for sure
Too much beer and vodka pure
Yesterday it was my cure!

Now my word breaks down on me
Thoughts are driving me crazy
Hammer beating in my head
Shivering Iâm hopeless
Feel like dying in my bed
Fell the guilt and I confess
Iâm baptized in alcohol
Iâm baptized in alcohol
Hammer beating in my head
Shivering Iâm hopeless
Feel like dying in my bed
Fell the guilt and I confess

But I lost all my control
Baptized in alcohol
Put me into rage
My mind has left its cage
Former friends told me what Iâve done

I feel like living shit
Alcohol abuse I commit
Blurred vision and dirty thought
I admit, it was my fault

Lost all my control
Baptized in alcohol
Put me into rage
My mind has left its cage
Former friends told me what Iâve done
Lost all my control
Baptized in alcohol
I hurt them, I know for sure
Too much beer and vodka pure
Yesterday it was my cure!
