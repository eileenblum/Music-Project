I outlive the lust | I outlive my love | I avoid the thrust | As from below | So from above | I
have chosen Mort | Instead of a Christian lord | Paradigm will conquer me | My entities, my I and
self | Ignite, flicker and cease the light of life | Make my last sense yet so intense | I enjoy the final
drip of wax upon me | Ignite, flicker and cease the light of life | Make my last sense yet so intense | I
accept my fate to cease | When I find my old peaceful mind | In a room of gloomy lights | I will eat
what fate serves | I will love who deserves | Live strong and don't bow | Not for above, not for below
| NOT FOR ABOVE, NOT FOR BELOW | I confirm myself to fate | The equalizing weapon of his choice
| Bound to obey and trust | The apodictic judgment of death | Ignite, flicker and cease the light of
life | Make my last sense yet so intense | I enjoy the final drip of wax upon me | Ignite, flicker and
cease the light of life | Make my last sense yet so intense | I accept my fate to cease | When I find
my old peaceful mind | IN A ROOM OF GLOOMY LIGHTS
