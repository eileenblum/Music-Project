"I cannot have you killed by the order of the king and my son | For you, too, have become a
part of my heart | That better may no longer stayâ | So she's hurt, so she inwardly weeps | How
much pain can a queen bravely take? | How could she know the devil's hands would intervene again?
| For now all hope is gone | For now all hope is in vain | For the life of a queen does not mean
anything to a bitter fate | For now all hope is in vain | I wish it wasn't so | I wish it wasn't so | For the
life of a queen does not mean anything to a bitter fate | For now all hope is in vain | Oh, they were
all so terribly wrong | They were all so trapped in the feint | No fortune saves our lifes from evil
hands | Taking any chance to curse us 'til the end | For now all hope is gone | For now all hope is in
vain | For the life of a queen does not mean anything to a bitter fate | For now all hope is in vain | I
wish it wasn't so | I wish it wasn't so | For the life of a queen does not mean anything to a bitter fate
| For now all hope is in vain | For the life of a queen does not mean anything to a bitter fate | And so
she withers away | I WISH IT WASNâT SO
