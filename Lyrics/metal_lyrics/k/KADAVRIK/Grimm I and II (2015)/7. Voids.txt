Once upon a time | I walked a straight line | Holding on to destiny | There was no fear and no
need | To abandon the illusion | Life was a tale | I walked a straight line | Holding on to destiny | As
a king I walked the earth | With everything to lose | I write those stories in my skin | I leave voids
and ink within | I cannot learn or live from pain | For there's nothing else to gain | I write those
stories in my skin | I leave voids and ink within | I suffer more than all my tales could tell | Can't hope
for love but hell | At night I slide away | In memory of childhood's day | And tales of fear and
laughter | Heroic ever after | Every night I slide away | In memory of childhood's day | And tales of
wolves and queens | About what moral means | Life has never proven this | Hear me speak | I write
those stories in my skin | I leave voids and ink within | I cannot learn or live from pain | For there's
nothing else to gain | I write those stories in my skin | I leave voids and ink within | I suffer more
than all my tales could tell | Can't hope for love but hell | I write those stories in my skin | I leave
voids and ink within | Is it wise to disenchant | To give in to the foregone? | Cause belief is for the
weak | And hope is for the crippled | Cause belief is for the weak | Hear me speak | Life has proven
this
