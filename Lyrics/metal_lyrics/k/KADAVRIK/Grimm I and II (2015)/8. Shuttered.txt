I'm charming so you follow
They all follow if I want to
You're mine so you obey
While I'm out just for a day
Stay alone and calm
So curiosity won't harm
Agree, my dear, so you won't fear
You're warned and now agree
Little wench broke plighted word
Disturbed from all whom I've hurt
I'd pity for you, little miss
But I'm a man to walk the talk
You know my secret and you will keep it
Cause it hurts you more than me
You know my secret and you will keep it
See the bodies bleeding?
None of them is speaking
Never seek for skeletons in my closet
Cause it hurts you more than me
Wrench the wenchâs hair
Axe to neck, she dared
So she deserves a bloody dish
That's best served cold
I won't argue for my word's your law
You should have known before
"You went into that chamber against my will
Against your will you shall now go into once againâ
You know my secret and you will keep it
Cause it hurts you more than me
You know my secret and you will keep it
See the bodies bleeding?
None of them is speaking
Never seek for skeletons in my closet
Cause it hurts you more than me
