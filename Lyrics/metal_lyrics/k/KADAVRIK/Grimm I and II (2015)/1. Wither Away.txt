Let me introduce | The miller's daughter | Her martyry and her countenance so heavenly | Alongside
with her bravest thereness | She had thoughtful but yet simple mind | You will see that once upon a
time | She showed thereâs luck to find | For those who give not up on anything | âDear father, Take
my hands and do as you please | Take my hands and do as you pleaseâ | "Help me in my need |And
forgive me of the evil | That I'm going to do to you" | Words of a broken father | From the grace of
greed he became a misled one | His fallacy was of a cruel kind | "Dear father, do with me what you
will | I am your childâ | And with these words she stretched forth both hands | He dropped the axe
and chopped them off | âHere I cannot stay, I will go forthâ | By sunrise she set out on her way | To
go forth and away | To go straight all the day | With her arms bound to her back | And a lack of trust
| A mind so white leaks a trail of red | From the grace of greed he became a misled one | His fallacy
was of a cruel kind | âDear father, Take my hands and do as you please | Take my hands and do as
you pleaseâ | "Dear father, do with me what you will | I am your childâ | And with these words she
stretched forth both hands | He dropped the axe and chopped them off | I AM YOUR CHILD, YOUR
CHILD, YOUR CHILD | And so she withered away | An armless maiden | Daughter of a cruel mind
