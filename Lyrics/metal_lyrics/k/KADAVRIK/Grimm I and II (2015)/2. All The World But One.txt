âThough your fingertips 
May never touch my skin 
I am a heartful king 
I hide your drama in disguise 
You are wise and you will see 
You mean the world to me 
You're forsaken by everyone 
YET I WILL NOT FORSAKE YOUâ 

But when he sleeps she weeps 
For she will never be complete 
In silvern hands there lies a weight 
That only she can take 
But when he sleeps she weeps 
For she will never be complete 
The silvern hands disguise her past 

âMy silver hands shine bright in light 
But at night when we are two 
They are too cold to comfort you 
Will I ever trust enough 
A king's promise and a husband's love? 
I am no spirit, I'm a mortal deserted by allâ 

From the inside she can see 
What has been and what will be 
IN SILVERN HANDS THERE LIES A WEIGHT 

COMPLETE 
But when he sleeps she weeps 
For she will never be complete
