Embrace the solitude | The old treeâs soul | Roots in the womb of earth |
Drain away the pain | In sylvan lands for seven years in fortitude | There all dwell free | But she
struggled to believe | That one day all her pain will vanish | Cause she learned too well | That when
fortune smiles upon her | Her damned fate will give her hell | And it took time to understand | And
tears not to surrender | Itâs worth the pain | When tears one day flood you back to love | Far away in
the kingdom | His eyes saw clearly then | What a fool heâs been | They were deceived | They were
deceived | He rode to find his wife | A love to risk his life | He did not eat, he did not sleep | Before
he could hold her in his arms again | He knew he would | One day he would be with her again | And
it was true | "MY GRIEF ENDS WITH YOU"
