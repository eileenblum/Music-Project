Every day we build a wall
So high that it will fall one day
Every day we all ignore
What we have learned before
Every day, every day
We build this wall
So high that it will fall one day
Every day we all ignore
What we have learned before
Every day, every day
We need to break this downward helix
We need to break it down
The ocean tide swallows our statues
We are like sediment
Watching the omens fall
When the well has flooded us all
We are now sediment
We knew that we will drown
When the tides have pulled us down
When the well has flooded all
We drown ourselves in pity
And as we drown it seems so easy
When the well has flooded all
We drown ourselves in pity
And as we drown it seems so easy
But yet too hard for us
We need to break this downward helix
We need to break it down, down, down
WE NEED TO BREAK IT DOWN
The ocean tide swallows our statues
We are like sediment
Watching the omens fall
The well has flooded us all
We are now sediment
We knew that we will drown
The tides have pulled us down
