Eye, eye of night
Staring at me, run
Run, don't hide
Neverending haste

Eye, eye of night
Staring at me, run
Run away
Away!

I am hunted all night long
I'm afraid of death behind me
When it touch's me I'll be gone
Purgatory will surround my
Soul

I am hunted all night long
I'm afraid of death behind me
When it touch's me I'll be gone
Purgatory will surround my
Eye

Eye, eye of night
Staring at me, run
Run, don't hide
Neverending haste

death, death behind you
wants, wants to touch you
takes your life
takes your soul
kills your pride
ends your fight

Eye, eye of night
Staring at me, run
Run, don't hide
Neverending haste
