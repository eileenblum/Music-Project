Deep in my soul... fighting hard
Fearful eyes that i regard
Feeding the deads, nothing to lose just my
Lonleyness i'd like to abuse ... now!

My fearful eyes I regard
The last to go when sorrows grow

I feel hate deep in my soul
Fear tonight, good night to die

Breaking the rules, no respect
Not knowing what I should expect
So much I heard 'bout life in hell
No will to suffer, so I hope I'll burn well

freakshow in a dead man's mind
not hard to find
see the actors pray, pray for voilence
see the creature cry, cry for silence

Last chapter in the book of life
The pages are cut by my own knife
Don't care what you said, never thought I was wise
Tears of blood cried by fearful eyes

My fearful eyes I regard
The last to go when sorrows grow

I feel hate deep in my soul
Fear tonight, good night to die

My fearful eyes I regard
The last to go when sorrows grow

I feel hate deep in my soul
Fear tonight, good night to die

Fearful Eyes!
