The wait is soon at endAlways charge never bendMorning is here, make your standLive for honor, glory, death in fire! Total war is hereFace it without fearAge of sword, age of spearFight for honor, glory, death in fire! See the fire riseFlames are raging highSoon all will burn and dieBurn for honor, glory, death in fire! Storm of lethal flamesOnly death remainsRagnarok is closing inDie for honor, glory, death in fire! Forces of chaos is on the moveEveryone, choose your sideAnd know the end is coming soonThe day for all to die The day is here when Bifrost breaksNor sun or moon will riseWhen the dead rise from their gravesand Surtur spreads his fire All you know will wither awayAnd sink into the seaA new world will be born one dayWhere everyone is free The warming sun returns againAnd melts away the snowThe sea is freed from icy chainsWinter is letting go Standing on the ocean sideWe can hear the wavesCalling us out with tideTo sail into our fate Oden! Guide our shipsOur axes, spears and swordsGuide us through storms that whipAnd in brutal war Our ships await us by the shoreTime has come to leaveOur country, family and homesFor riches in the east Some of us won't returnBut that won't bring us downOur fate is written in the webWoven by the Norns
