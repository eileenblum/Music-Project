I don't wanna hear the things you say
Lied to me, kicked me away
Why dont you just leave me alone?

Forever we have thought
That this would f'rever last
But your false pride
Just broke apart us fast.
You do not seem to care
What you have done to me
Our friendship, you did dare
To betray, don't you agree?

You agree? don't you see?
Betray! skies turned grey!
So grey

I blame you
I hate you
Look me in the eyes

Come on, die!

I bury you deep in my mind
Somewhere very deep inside
Noone may ever do again
What you have done to me, false friend

I dont wanna hear the things you say
Lied to me, kicked me away
Why dont you just leave me alone?

Forever we have thought
That this would f'rever last
But your false pride
Just broke apart us fast
You do not seem to care
What you have done to me
Our friendship, you did dare
To betray, don't you agree?
I bury you deep in my mind
Somewhere very deep inside
No one may ever do again
What you have done to me, false friend

I hate you
I blame you
Look me in the eyes

I dont wanna hear the things you say
Lied to me, kicked me away
Why dont you just leave me alone?

Forever we have thought
That this would f'rever last
But your false pride
Just broke apart us fast
You do not seem to care
What you have done to me
Our friendship, you did dare
To betray, don't you agree?
I bury you deep in my mind
Somewhere very deep inside
No one may ever do again
What you have done to me, false friend

Come on, die!
