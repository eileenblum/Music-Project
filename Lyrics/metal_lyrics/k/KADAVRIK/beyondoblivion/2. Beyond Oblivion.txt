Graves without a nameJust a lie of fameWhite crosses all I seeanonymous eternitymemories remain Beyond OblivionBeyond OblivionFallen heroes in decayBeyond OblivionFires scorching birds of preyBeyond Oblivion Graves without a nameJust a lie of fameWhite crosses all I seeanonymous eternitymemories remain Beyond OblivionBeyond OblivionFallen heroes in decayBeyond OblivionFires scorching birds of preyBeyond Oblivion Graves without a nameJust a lie of fameWhite crosses all I seeanonymous eternitymemories remain Abused as weapons made of fleshThey rot beyond oblivionAbused as worthless warmachinesThey rot beyond oblivionFallen heroes in decayBeyond OblivionFires scorching birds of preyBeyond Oblivion Weapons made of flesh
