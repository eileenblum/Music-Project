Eternal nights
Eternal dreams
Like cruel rites
There's nothing, nothing as it seems

Just one last pray
But no one to obey
Ask me if its worth it

Drifting away
To a world that seems grey
Someday, someday it will die

Eternal nights
Eternal dreams
Like cruel rites
There's nothing, nothing as it seems

Just one last pray
But no one to obey
Ask me if its worth it

Drifting away
To a world that seems grey
Someday, someday it will die

This existence
Not worth living
Cruel rites
Made me fall
... So deep
