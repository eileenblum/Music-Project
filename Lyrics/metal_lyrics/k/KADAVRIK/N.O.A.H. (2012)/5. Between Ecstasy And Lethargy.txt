My heat spreads into you
Your chill creeps into me
My mind jerks between
Ecstasy and lethargy

And it will always be too late
My skies are filled with regret

Every day i battle gods
Far beyond my might
Cast out to exile
For i shared their light

And it will always be too late
Your eyes are filled with regret

The more we search the more we are lost
The more i break out the more i feel trapped
The more we build up the more will collapse
The more i seek sense the more i feel numb

There were great times but they were a tale
Told by myself and they were dead
The more we search the more we're lost
The more i break out the more i'm trapped

Every day it eats my heart
To remind me of the pain
Tear me open one by one
Every night it heals again

The more we search the more we are lost
The more i break out the more i feel trapped
The more we build up the more will collapse
The more i seek sense the more i feel numb

The more we search the more we are lost
The more i break out the more i feel trapped
The more we build up the more will collapse
The more i seek sense the more i feel numb

The closer you get the further i want to push you away
The further you go the deeper i want to push me in you

The closer you get the further i want to push you away
The further you go the deeper i want to push me in you
