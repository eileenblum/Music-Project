Imprisoned by ourselves, gambling all or nothing
We're all in, high rollin', we're falling and failing
Once in the air you can't walk back
Once love is lost it all runs black

The times i loved the handcuffs round my arms
Are long forgotten, as it harms and hurts me now
And now that hate is my emotion
I see there's nothing left and there is no devotion
Let's go!

Imprisoned by ourselves, gambling all or nothing
We're all in, high rollin' we're falling and failing
Once in the air you can't walk back
Once love is lost it all runs black

The king is dead!
Ain't no cardiologist and don't need one to see
What is wrong in our hearts, why we can't no longer
Be the couple that is you alone, you're on the throne
And i revolt, the king is dead
The king is dead

Can't stand the walls you built for me
And these walls can't stand no longer
I will make your world a ruin
I will ruin everything
(i ruin everything)

Vengeance is the mirror of our souls
And the mirror's what i love to see
What i loved to see

The times i loved the handcuffs round my arms
Are long forgotten, as it harms and hurts me now
Trying to domesticate the life i loved and had
Made it easy to forget-out of my head!

Imprisoned by ourselves, gambling all or nothing
We're all in, high rollin', we're falling and failing
Once in the air you can't walk back
Once love is lost it all runs black
It all runs black
