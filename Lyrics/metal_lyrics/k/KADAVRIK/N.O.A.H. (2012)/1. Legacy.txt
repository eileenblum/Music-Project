We have nothing to fear but fear itself
This is the war we fight alone
This is the war we fight alone
Hell abandoned-all the demons are here
Winding through the entrails that we own

Purify me from the first born's legacy
Rescue me and one day I'll be free

I travel to the inside
Where nemesis awaits
There is no place to hide
And it's lurking in the shades
A hundred times he kills me
And gains the upper hand
But if I win I'll get the key
To my promised land

Lust for revenge, the urge takes over
This is the war we fight alone
This is the war we fight alone
How can I build up a core of resistance?
Strengthen me to endure what I see

Purify me from the first born's legacy
Rescue me and one day I'll be free

I travel to the inside
Where nemesis awaits
There is no place to hide
And it's lurking in the shades
A hundred times he kills me
And gains the upper hand
But if I win I'll get the key
To my promised land
