Manifested fears
Overkill of thoughts
Never stop to run
It's right behind us
From inception to downfall in a sequence
How will this end tonight?

I am a dreamer lost in a sunken hall
Will i withstand the fall?

We dive through the oceans that are not but seem
To open dark portals, 0 come, let us dare
You look into my eyes and whisper "this is just a dream"
That never was enough-i want to make it real

I look at the stars but they are not real 'cause they're moving
Just airplanes to nowhere-there is no reason to care

If that's all a dream why does pain make me cry?
They say i wake up before i hit the soil

Manifested fears
Overkill of thoughts
Never stop to run
It's right behind us
From inception to downfall in a sequence
How will this end tonight?

I was a dreamer in a sunken hall
Before i broke through the wall

We dive through the oceans that are not but seem
To open dark portals, 0 come, let us dare
You look into my eyes and whisper "this is just a dream"
That never was enough. i want to make it real

Let us take everything, everything we get
We are the masters when we choose to act
Or we'll get stuck in the mud of our chaos
And the monster behind can catch us

We dive through the oceans that are not but seem
To open dark portals, 0 come, let us dare
You look into my eyes and whisper "this is just a dream"
That never was enough. i want to make it real

Together we storm the gate
Let all desires gather
With all our love and all our hate
We live this dream forever
