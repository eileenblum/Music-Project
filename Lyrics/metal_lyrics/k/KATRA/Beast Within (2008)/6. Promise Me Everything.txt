For every fallen tear there is a broken dream
After every wasted day there comes the night
As the truth becomes a lie I loose the last sunbeam
And the second wrong makes me feel I'm right

The more I climb to reach the sky, the more I fall
And I feel like I'm best at ruining my own life
When I'm down and out and standing back against the wall
Then please come to me, make it all alright

Promise me everything
Give my heart this lie
Words to believe in
Don't let me die

Promise me love and more
As if it was true
Something to fight for
Promise it's you

Although I am lost and fallen from grace
There's a flame of hope lit somewhere in the dark
As a lie becomes the truth maybe I'll find a place
Where you come to me and take me to your heart

Promise me everything
Give my heart this lie
Words to believe in
Don't let me die

Promise me love and more
As if it was true
Something to fight for
Promise it's you
