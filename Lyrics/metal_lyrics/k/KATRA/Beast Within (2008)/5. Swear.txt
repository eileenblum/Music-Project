I have tried to find out
who is she
The girl in the crowd
the rest call me
by my own name

She has been lost and then found
and I just pray
there will be a ground
to stand one day
before it's too late

Swear on your love
Your life won't go waste
you will find your place
Swear on your love
if you have one desire
you do it before you die

She hasn't always done
for what is right
But who am I to judge and pull the line
on her own game

It may sometimes be
too hard to keep
on my dreams and try to seek
that girl inside me
