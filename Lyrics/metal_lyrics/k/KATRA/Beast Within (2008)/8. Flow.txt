See the hearts that deeply woe
On the banks of Nile they watch their loved ones being washed away

Path of life as we all know
Isn't wide enough for all of us to walk through the day

Flow with the flood of Nile
Hear the cry of deep waters
Go to the distant isle
Where the sunset glows

Flow with the flood of Nile
Leave your sons and dear daughters
They will still stay awhile
While the river flows
While the river flows

Sorrow's sister human joy
Shall not bring the tears of laughter in our eyes today

Ferryman's grave load on joy
And we lay to rest our loved ones in this mournful way

Flow with the flood of Nile
Hear the cry of deep waters
Go to the distant isle
Where the sunset glows

Flow with the flood of Nile
Leave your sons and dear daughters
They will still stay awhile
While the river flows
While the river flows
