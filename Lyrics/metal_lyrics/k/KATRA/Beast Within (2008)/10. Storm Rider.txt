Hide behind the shadows of the night
In no light

She's riding
With whirlwind
And with the angels
She's crying
Betrayal has poisoned her heart

Hide before the good and bad collide
In no time

She lives in
Cloudbursting
And with that anger
She's striking
Betrayal has torn her apart

And when the time has come she rides the storm
Like wind she howls for all betrayed, deceits are born
And with the rain she comes and rides the storm
For there's no love no more, she makes the great rain fall

Hide 'cause all the nature's on her side
This dark night

She comes in
Storm riding
And with the angels
She's crying
Betrayal has poisoned her heart

Fall great rain
Wash away all the pain
And blow with the wind again
Cool down and mend

And when the time has come she rides the storm
Like wind she howls for all betrayed, deceits are born
And with the rain she comes and rides the storm
For there's no love no more, she makes the great rain fall
