There's a story about this land
Dunes that keep the secret in the sand
Bowl from ancient history
Hiding an eternal mystery

And truth lies somewhere in the desert's secrecy

In wind I hear the whispering
The greatest treasure there has ever been
So far like a glory shining star
A tale about the Grail of Sahara

Old oasis up the hill
Fountain's water dreary standing still
Chest of victory and death
Hidden in oasis' holy bed

And truth is buried in the sand till man's last breath

In wind I hear the whispering
The greatest treasure there has ever been
So far like a glory shining star
A tale about the Grail of Sahara

In wind I hear the whispering
The greatest treasure there has ever been
So far like a glory shining star
A tale about the Grail of Sahara
