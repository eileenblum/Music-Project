Two eyes lurk in the darkness
Can you see, can you see that creature
fallen from the grace

Once joyed that feline touch
but lingering and the pain came along you
light left no trace

The kindness that you lack
can turn pure heart into black

Beast within
under skin
I'm denying
what was before
exists no more
when beauty became the

Beast within
under skin
say goodbye to
that beauty
who once was me
when beauty became the beast

Irritated near the madness
what I see, I see a reaction
drawn on your face

You drove me to the edge of sadness
to that point, to the end of reason
end of the day
