There you close the door
I've never lost someone before
As clouds always lead to rain
Tears come with the pain

We don't share the bed
And sorry's the only word unsaid
So how can we know at all
What's behind the wall

There's so much unspoken
And silence unbroken

We fade to gray
We fall down and drift away
And silence's the loneliest word
I've heard
We decay to a shade

Love has left this home
We are together but alone
Thought you would know my heart
But we're so apart

Have faith in me
Like children who doubtlessly believe
As clouds always lead to rain
Tears can ease the pain

And we fade to gray
We fall down and drift away
And silence's the loneliest word
I've heard
We decay to a shade

We never talk
We never speak
Don't recognize that feelings
And buried so deep

We fade to gray
We fall down and drift away
And silence's the loneliest word
I've heard
We decay to a shade
