Wish I had a soul more free than a butterfly
But I am too weak to try
It's over now
All but the crying part
You make me fall apart
Take me down

Wish I had a heart harder than the hardest stone
Cause now I must walk alone
It's over now
You say that no one dies
Then shoot between my eyes
Take me down

You made all the scars in my heart
Cuts in me, all those wounds so deep
Wish they'd make me strong
Give me more strength to carry on
Walk the door; be gone

Wish I had a dream more pure than reality
Somewhere up ahead for me
It's over now
All but the falling stars
Wish time would heal the scars
Somehow

You made all the scars in my heart
Cuts in me, all those wounds so deep
Wish they'd make me strong
Give me more strength to carry on
Be gone

You made all the scars in my heart
Cuts in me, all those wounds so deep
Wish they'd make me strong
Give me more strength to carry on
Walk the door; be gone
