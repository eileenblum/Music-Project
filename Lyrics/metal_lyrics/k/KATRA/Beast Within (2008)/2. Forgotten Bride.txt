This is for the heavy-hearted
Those who've left their love behind
And who have seen
Those who know how pain can be
Sorrow that can't be unwind
Despair of the whole mankind
This love's killing me

He's gone fighting for his homeland
Far away across the sea
Desert and sand
Once I stood beside my man
We had all eternity
Tell me why he had to leave

This is the heart your love left yearning, soul that burning died
These are the eyes that still are crying, tears I'm trying to hide
I'm his forgotten bride

Years have passed and wars are outdone
Men came home and wounds were healed
Except for one
My dear love is yet to come
Destiny's thus can't be sealed
Fighting my own battlefield

This is the heart your love left yearning, soul that burning died
These are the eyes that still are crying, tears I'm trying to hide
I'm his forgotten bride

Once hand in hand
There I stood beside my man
We had all eternity
Tell me why he had to leave

This is the heart your love left yearning, soul that burning died
These are the eyes that still are crying, tears I'm trying to hide
I'm his forgotten bride
