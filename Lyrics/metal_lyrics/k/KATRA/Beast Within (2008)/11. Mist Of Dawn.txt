We feel it running in our blood and veins
Life withdrawn
Eternal mist of dawn
Leave. it's time to break the chains
Today we will go all the way
And love's all that remains

Come, my love, embrace the death
Rise above the final breath
For my love, it's not in vain
Mist of dawn will take the pain

We are all walking in the sands of time
As we hear
The bells and chimes so near
See how your life can be so cruel
You fall, when you thought you had it all
Only what we have is true

Come, my love, embrace the death
Rise above the final breath
For my love, it's not in vain
Mist of dawn will take the pain

Aa-aa-aa-aa...

Come, my love, embrace the death
Rise above the final breath
For my love, it's not in vain
Mist of dawn will take the pain
