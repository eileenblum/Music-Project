Look into his eyes and see
How humble in love he can be
Any given day he's gone
Just when you thought you were one

Was it all a lie of hearts and blind eyes
Illusion of a timeless dream that dies

Mystery
No way to understand the world we live in
There's that mystery
In every heart and every soul that's breathing
Soul that's breathing

How can I tell it's true
If love is so charmingly cruel
He would say he'd die for me
But am I supposed to believe

Was it all a lie of hearts and blind eyes
Illusion of a timeless dream that dies

Mystery
No way to understand the world we live in
There's that mystery
In every heart and every soul that's breathing
Soul that's breathing

There's that mystery
There's that mystery
In every heart and every soul that's breathing
Soul that's breathing
