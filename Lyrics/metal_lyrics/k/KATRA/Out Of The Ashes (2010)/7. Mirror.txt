Can youSee those eyesBetrayal and lies Staring at meForcing to scream Is this a dreamNightmare I mean I cannot withdrawI'm gonna fallOut of reachIf what I see face to face,is my pure reality Is there more more to be seenIn the mirror than just meIs there more more to be seenTrough my sin of vanity What have I becomeOh, how to come undoneGive me a gun It hauntsme every timeNo way to hideIt's there inside Tearing my heart trulky apartI see the scarsThey will remind I'm gonna fallOut of reachIf what I see face to face,is my pure reality Is there more more to be seenIn the mirror than just meIs there more more to be seenTrough my sin of vanity What have I becomeOh, how to come undoneGive me a gun
