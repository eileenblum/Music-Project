Seeking for my truthWhere's the ending where I'm going to?Am I on my way?Should I care? Do I have to faceI am losing my path and traceAll I know for sureCan't get trough DeliriumI close my eyesI'm lost inside DeliriumNo life lineI've lost my mindInside Riding for a fallCannot see, if there's a wallBlinded by the rideNo clear sight Do I have to faceI am lying my life to wasteAll I know for sureI can't get trough
