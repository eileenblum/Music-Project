Again the same old dream,I wake up in the nightThe sound of my own screamMake me wonder Why I have to feelYou're walking over meEven when I sleepYou pull me under Maybe it's becauseI just won't kneel youLike the other doI see you trough I have to endureThe pain, but at leastI know what's the truthI know that you are "Lying, luringIt is just an actNot true, not a factTrusting and fallingThey look up to youAnthem for a fool" You love to wear that crownYour statue of deceitYour secret will come outI'll make sure of it Take the stage for nowI have no will to fightGo mislead the crowdRemember that you are "Lying, luringIt is just an actNot true, not a factTrusting and fallingThey look up to youAnthem for a fool"
