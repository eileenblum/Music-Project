The house is so silentThat I can hear my own blood rushingI am too scared to breatheTerrified if I wake youShh... Quiet I feel like a phantom,Too restless and just too torn to forgetAll what you've done to meI will count one and then two, wait for three I told you Just blame it on meMake me crawl once moreJust blame it on meI will make you see Just blame it on meI will not forgiveUntil you sufferUntil you knowThat I'm not guilty The last act of violenceI see the look in your eyes, just beforeI make the final strokeNow who's the ghost? Is it you?Surprised? Don't try to judge meYou don't even know what I've been putTroughIt's now my game, my turnOne final lesson you still have to learnI told you The story of us twoWas too beautiful to be trueI was alone and a foolYou made me fall for youMy head up in the skyCouldn't tell it was all a lieI had no strength to cry,Just smile and everything's fineWhen the days turned to yearsYou made me learn what is fearand forced me to sayI am the one to blame
