See the fire raging through
Trough the land where roses grew

See the village turning to
Devil's furnace with it too

All my memories
Burning to ashes
All my misery
Fading to grey

Would you fly with me?
Be another soul
With whom to flee
Could I rise with thee
From the ashes of
Yesterday

Dying under rising Sun
Whom the Gods love do die young

See those ashes on the ground
There are roses growing now

All what future holds
Hiding in shadows
New dawn awakening
After the end

Lead me away from the pain
Lead me fire to rain
Lead me away
