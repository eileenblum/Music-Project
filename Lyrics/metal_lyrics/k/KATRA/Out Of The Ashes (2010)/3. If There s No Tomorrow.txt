It has been goneJust too longSince the sun fell asleep Everyone's dyingSeeking and tryingTo keep their sanity The fatal moon is ruling over this land My hands are freezingHeart slowly beatingI can see my own breath Why all the sufferingTorture and agony The fatal moon is ruling over this land If there's no tomorrowWill you forgive all the things that I didIf there's no tomorrow, being wrong it's sohard to admitIf there's no tomorrowWhy do I have to endure all this painIf there's no tomorrowWhat was the pointIf it all just ends today The suns ain't risingThe day is dawningNo ray of light to be seen Why if the miseryLoves to have companyI'm here all alone The fatal moon is ruling over this land Sealing my doom,crying for the moon
