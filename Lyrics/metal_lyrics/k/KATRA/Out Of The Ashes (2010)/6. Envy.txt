I linger outsideIn winter's nightI can't come home,you await me inside I rather freeze thanNow face the truthThis fight had nothingTo do with you Trying to swallow the words breakingTroughI took myself away from you I step aheadand come closer to the doorWhen the cold's getting in my core You made me wonderWhy I blameYou for something myself ought toshameIt's just so easy to ignore what you saidThe voice is screaming in the back of myhead EnvyOh, my foolish prideThis feeling, it drives me mad I know this gameBut not how to playSo I can't explain awayWhy I suffer and make you bleedIt's beacuse of my shattered dreams How could I say "I envy your lifethe show you lead should have beenmine" EnvyOh my foolish prideEating insideEnvy I'm like a childNot your brideEnvy, oh my foolish prideEating insideThis feeling it drives meMad! I want to let go of my pastSay it to you and make it lastThis fight between us, I will tell:Has now ended, the door's wide openI'm home -Alone
