The moon is shining
Above the frozen lake
She's all alone
Casting a shadow
In front of her way
Where can she go?

The silence around
Is nearly making her scream
The savior that she need
Cannot be seen

Help me

Hide and seek
I'm too afraid of the night
When the lights go out

Hide and seek
At the end of the time
We are all alone in the dark

Just like a child
After having a bad dream
She cannot sleep
By herself she's
Waiting for someone
Help her sleep

The twilight of the sky
Fading slowly away
The savior that she needs
Cannot be seen

Hide and seek
I'm too afraid of the night
When the lights go out

Hide and seek
At the end of the time
We are all alone in the dark
