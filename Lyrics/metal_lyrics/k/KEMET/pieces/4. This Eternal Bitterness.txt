A thousand stars disturb my dreams witnesses of my tears
A slow caress pulled me from my sleep
I'm waking up but my eyes stayed closed.
The taste of reality will now leave my lips
My new mistress, the one you call Death
The one you dread will received my soul
In its last residence.
La mort, ultime delivrance
Va briser les chaines qui liaient mon ame
A ce spectre du passe
Que le sang puisse effacer
Cette promesse bafouee.
A garden of roses, of peace and quiet,
Will make so sweet the feeling of eternity
In their words forever lost, could they just think
It was the only way for me?
The blood and sorrow
Have dicted their laws
It was the only way for me, to be by your side
The pain, the cold compain of existence
The pain, brought me to new landscapes
The pain, spilling in my veins, like the memory of your grace.
It was the only way for me
To be by your side and forget these cold nights
To take me to the other side.
Just a word, a sign to breath the rope
Forget these gloomy hours
A word to leave this cold night.
A sign, too much for you to give
You left me behind you under this black sky
The back whipped by a boling rain
That swept away my soul.
The wording, the last act we played
Is coming back to me, like ghosts wandering in my head
And here the storm subsided.
A slow caress pulled me from my sleep
Waking up but my eyes stayed closed
An iced kiss, then froze my lips.
An iced kiss, then froze my lips
My flight just failed
My suicide rimed aground...
And only wander in the ruins of my past
Trapped in the embrace of
This eternal bitterness.
