[I. Lovers Guided By Desire]

See them sparkle, the embers of dawn
Vipers in the garden of love, unknown clandestines in
The Kingdom of delight, take on the night.
Disloge the inhabitants of this blessed domain,
Lovers guided by illusion, take on the night.
Attractive rapists with pure faces unknown clandestines in
The kingdom of delight.
A blessed domain, only the ones who know cross the line,
Evading in a shared magical dream.

A magical dream... rocked by betrayal that dirted my existence.

[II. Lovers Collide With Reality]

And the spell worked:
Feeling this passion
Paralyzed in this rising hell
Too wake up is too hard
Perishing in the embers of dawn.

A blaze in the mists of your heart
Punished my act, punished my act
You, mastering the end as a thought
Punished my act
Hear this requiem in two parts
Embers in the fire of dawn glide and collide
A dying sun shines on each of my days

In the widow of my hopes that strungled my own hands,
The story ended in a last caress of faith.
As purity, leaving with this yearning
This load prevents me from moving forward
Dazzled by the light in your eyes
Sparkling as the embers of dawn.
