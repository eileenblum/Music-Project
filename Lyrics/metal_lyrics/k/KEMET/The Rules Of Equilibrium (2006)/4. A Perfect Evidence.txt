It was an harmony of fates
A perfect evidence:
We were tightrope walkers above lives

And suddenly the rules changed
Do you know them? No place for hazard
And suddenly, the opponent changed
How many risks did you take?

You carit follow me in decline
Do you hear me "in decline"?
Trapped in myself I am the prey
I carit listen to your lies, listen to your lies
Trapped in yourself, the mentor became a martyr
Its just an harmony of fates I must forget
Am I courageous enough?

And suddenly the rules changed
Do you know them? No place for hazard
And suddenly, the opponent changed
How many risks did you take?

You can't break, this equilibrium, kill this harmony
What am I supposed to search?
A shelter or an asylum?
You can't bury this evidence, its our living wage
Who am I supposed to pray?
A courageous devil or a cowardly god?

Wait... I must have a break to realize...
That the mercy of the sky... all the mercy of the sky
Worit break... the velvet ropes festering me to you...
And worit heal these deep wounds digged by your words...
I'll never regret. I could be silent forever
I could hide the truth forever
But I confess... that I'll soon destroy what remains of me...
Never regret... this kind of feelings... can you hide it?

I spent so much time to try to convince myself
I spent so much time to think that disillusions fade away...
But I still feel the same...
Nothing seems to change
I still feel the same... convictions are away

And suddenly the rules changed
Do you know them? No place for hazard
And suddenly, the opponent changed
How many risks did you take?

It was an harmony of fates
A perfect evidence:
We were tightrope walkers above lives
