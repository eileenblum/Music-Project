Here we are, back on our first steps where expectations fall
Here we are, waiting for a sign of mankind
A human existence proof to decide to carry on... or not...

By my side... you can't seek an answer now
Oh, by my side... but further each second now

Is there a possible u-turn, a path to come back in their world?
To feel your joy again, instead of this pain...
You walked during hours, vomiting your mistakes on each of your steps
Is there a possible u-turn, a path to come back, not on your knees?
Because you can't wait... because you can't count anymore
The dead people that you did met on the road
Fate is a burden... from your birth to the grave

Without you I can't break the distances of truth anymore
I'm a disarmed warrior a clandestine passenger on the rails of perdition
Without you I can pretend I am alive anymore
I can't give to the light another shape anymore

A respite just another day to find an exit
Can't you give it to me?
Hear this calling! Hear the calling!
Just a rest, just another break to slow its arrival
Can you feel it's coming?
Hear this calling! Hear this calling!

By my side... you can't seek an answer now
Oh, by my side... but further each hour now
But further each hour now
But further each hour now

A respite just another day to find an exit
Can't you give it to me?
Hear this calling! Hear the calling!
Just a rest, just another break to slow its arrival
Can you feel it's coming?
Hear this calling! Hear this calling!

Here we are, back on the first steps of our days
Here you are... in a funeral dress
Here we are, back on the first steps of our days
Here I am to take you back... to take you back... in my fight...

A respite just another day to find an exit
Can't you give it to me?
Hear this calling! Hear the calling!
Just a rest, just another break to slow its arrival
Can you feel it's coming?
Hear this calling! Hear this calling!

To take you back... to take you back... in my fight...
