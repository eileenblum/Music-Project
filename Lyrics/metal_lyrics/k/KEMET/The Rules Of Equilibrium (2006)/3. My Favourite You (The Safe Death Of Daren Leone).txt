Please wake up
Will you wake up?
I don't have the words to explain
Please stand up...
Will you stand up?
It was a simple matter of lust
Will you condemn my gesture?
Where could I find enough control?
Could you stop the curse?
Could you stop it?
I never had so many regrets
To express...

I carit feed your bliss...
I carit freeze the bleed forever
Is it a last breath you take before your death?
I carit fill the film...
And skip this last scene for ever
It is too late... for a second chance

Addiction / Extinction
Is it the endless cycle of passion?
Accusation / Self-destruction
An alibi for acid rains?
Expectation / No evolution?
Creeping on a long road of delusions...
What's the reason? Is there a reason?
Was it to prove ourselves we were alive?

Long on the rails of desire...
Waiting for an higher existence...
I now carit look now at your ill body

I carit feed your bliss...
I carit freeze the bleed forever
Is it a last breath you take before your death?
I carit fill the film...
And skip this last scene for ever
It is too late... for a second chance

Safe death. Did you ever feel so well?
Safe death. Behind the curtains of hate
Safe death. In these times of disgrace...
Agony is deliverance

Safe death. Did you ever feel so well?
Safe death. Behind the curtains of hate
Safe death. In these times of disgrace...
Agony is deliverance
