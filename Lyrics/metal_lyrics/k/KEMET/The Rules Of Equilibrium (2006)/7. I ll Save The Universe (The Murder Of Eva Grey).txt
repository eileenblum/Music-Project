Stay calm for a while. The reunion has just begun

I can now find outside what is still consuming me frim inside:
There's a part of me waiting for a promise
Can I now find inside the strength enough to master outside?
This part of me guiding me to nowhere?

La vita senza te, la vita senza te...
Will save my world
Dicami perchÃ©
Let me close your eyes, let me close your eyes...
And change all that comes behind... behind...

Madness is waiting for me inside
With its velvet arguments from outside
An immaterial heroÃ¯n?
Or your metamorphose?
It gave me a weapon from outside
And covered my wounded mind with a sigh
I'm a child who found a knife
Ready to revenge the lost

It's me. It's me
You never knew me so fragile...
It's me, can't you see?
You never worried so much
For me, for me and the sanity of my thoughts
It's me. It's me, can't you remember?

La vita senza te, la vita senza te...
Will save my world
Dicami perchÃ©
Let me close your eyes, let me close your eyes...
And change all that comes behind... behind...
