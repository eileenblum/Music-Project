Hold on my breath my resonance
The sun was really be (...)
Be sure it won't be the same... Another world will arise...
All these x-rated emotions
All the blood on my hands did don't make me change

Look at the tears
On my cheeks
The tears on my cheeks
Are from the child who
Used to cry in your arms

All innocent tears
Are fallen
They won't delay
My curse this time

All innocent tears
Are fallen
They won't delay
My curse this time

La vita senza te, la vita senza te...
Will save my world
Dicami perchÃ©
Let me close your eyes, let me close your eyes...
And change all that comes behind... behind...
