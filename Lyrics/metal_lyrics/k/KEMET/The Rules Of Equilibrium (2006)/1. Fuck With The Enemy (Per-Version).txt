Hold me now

I can't break the chains of this sorrow
I can't break the chains of this sorrow
Can't hold me now and my sanity
At this bloody edge of the chasm

Just say next to me
When the demons are asleep,
When the demons are asleep, we are as one

I can't break the chains of this sorrow
I can't break the chains of this sorrow
Can't hold me now and my sanity
At this bloody edge of the chasm

Leaving me, entering you
Will you master this feeling?
This mandatory weakness,
In a frozen conscience.
I'm the only witness of my execution

I love when you have no defence
I love when distress makes you cry my name
Just stay next to me
When the demons are asleep
But every time I kill you, I am the one who dies

In front of reality, the voices of the city
Are no more there
I meet my worst enemy: it is you
So it is me 'cause we are as one

Every belief, every fault
Every lost corpse on the road
Every cathodic shout
Every glass which saw you drown
Every girl who saw you strong
Every reprieve before riot
Every death in the family
Every porno-love story
Every heart surgery

Leaving me, entering you
Will you master this feeling?
This mandatory weakness,
In a frozen conscience.
I'm the only witness of my execution
