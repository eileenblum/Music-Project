Fear
There's a shadow you can't hide, a dark omen on your town
A personal wander but you can't hide
Even in your pride, even in your dreams
You were difficult to find but
You were unchained by my side
With your pathetic scheme as a weapon
Call it innocence, I call it betrayal

Hate burns in me like a bad omen that makes me fall
To save my reality, someone must die...
Prove me your love if you can...

Share it, I share it, this dependency, this so cold addiction
For it... eternally, fighting for the cross against oblivion

Our powerful lights are fading to deep dark
There's a nonsense executing my reason now...
Charmed and disarmed...
And my world that is loosing its face...
Charmed and disarmed...

There's no running away, no fucking escape
No enlightned highways to delete your scheme

Share it, I share it, this dependency, this so cold addiction
For it... eternally, fighting for the cross against oblivion

Fear
There's a shadow you can't hide
A dark omen on your town
There's no more place for your fear
Fear
You were difficult to find
But you were unchained by my side
You were addict by your fear

There's one thing I can't forget
It's your scheme, it's your scheme
The one that gave to my life a taste of pain

There's one thing I can't forget
It's your scheme, it's your scheme
The one that gave to my life a taste of pain

I guess you know the way
No fucking escape
It's your scheme, it's your scheme
I like to thy waste
To delete and to shame
It's your scheme, it's your scheme
I guess you know the way
It's your scheme, it's your scheme
To give me a just and
It's your scheme, it's your scheme
I guess you know the way...
It's your scheme, it's your scheme
I guess you know the way...

Share it, I share it, this dependency, this so cold addiction
For it... eternally, fighting for the cross against oblivion

Hate burns in me like a bad omen that makes me fall
To save my reality, someone must die...
Hate burns in me like a bad omen that makes me fall
Prove me your love if you can...
You will hide to forget
