Something disappeared
Can't you feel it in the air?
Is it a member of our family
Or a rumour scattering outside?

It is certain I will fall
Put my secrets on the floor...

Just a fever, a painful fever
But it turned to fire...
And it's over now
Than I pulled the trigger
Just to find the answer
The correct answer
And it's over now

How many faces did it take?
Was it sleeping by our side
Here, in our house?
What was the name you gave to it?
Did you call it "premonition" or
Did you call it "faith"?

It is certain I will fall
Put my secrets on the floor
Then spend an entire life to remember
That you left me on the floor...

Just a fever, a painful fever
But it turned to fire...
And it's over now
Than I pulled the trigger
Just to find the answer
The correct answer
And it's over now

It's over now

Each day a mistake
A step behind to your favour
The ways that I found were
Paths to the night
Can golden lures of your radiance
Be washed by your blood?
You turn my truth by your lie
You turn my truth by your lie
Can golden lures of your radiance
Be washed by your blood?

Just take the cross tight
Against you chest
And smell the air of its absence
Just take a last merciful look at me
In the name of your father
Do you see a soul in this ill body?

Just a fever, a painful fever
But it turned to fire...
And it's over now
Than I pulled the trigger
Just to find the answer
The correct answer
And it's over now
