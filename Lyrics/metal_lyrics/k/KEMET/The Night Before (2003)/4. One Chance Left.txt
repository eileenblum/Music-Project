Truth in front of us, how could you overcome it?
Dead ode to desire, the light above is gone.
I don't think you'll try, the night is so long, the gap is so large.
I don't think you'll try, the faces are so hard to recognize.
Trapped behind your landmine, can you see I'm not the one that will change the score, that will bring truth into the light?

The more that I can give to you, the more you can accept is no remedy to your never ending distress.

Trapped behind your landmine, can you see I'm not the one that will change the score, that will bring truth into the light?
What could I do to show you that the best is about to come?
I can't cut myself in two anymore.

Can you see I'm not the one that rules your days?
I don't want to be your accomplice that switch off the light to dissimulate the crime weapon, near your dead body.

Face to your dusty fate, you can't fight the one you are.

Trapped behind your landmine, can you see I'm not the one that will change the score, that will bring truth into the light?
What could I do to show you that the best is about to come?
I can't cut myself in two anymore.
