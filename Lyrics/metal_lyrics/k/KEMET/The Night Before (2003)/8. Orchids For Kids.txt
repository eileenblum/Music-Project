Winter is coming. It brings for us the promised night that we've both always been waiting for
Winter is coming. It brings for us the ultimate event in which we'll learn who we really are
Orchids for kids. A present for an obscene night

Find an exit for tonight, a controlled fall
Find an exit in our demise
Orchids for kids, tonight
Our controlled fall is a present for the naives

How long will it last?

We heard about betrayal
We heard about painful tragedies
We heard about dependencies and melancholies
Is it the mistake of our life that we are making?
We heard about what people call the high fall when love is gone and emptiness that waits behind
Nothing will be like before

When the light begins to change and suspicion grows
What will we bring with us?

And the pallid sky will open
And the pallid sky will open
And our hearts will begin to beat in an other rythme
And the pallid sky will open

White orchids in your hands for the kids that we were

Well, when begins to change and no doubt remains
From now, purity will turn to grey
You used to be what I was made for, until this murderer night
Now you are what I'm dying for...
