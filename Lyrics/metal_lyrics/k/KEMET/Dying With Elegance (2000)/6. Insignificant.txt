So much patience and devotion, but the world never got
On
We fought it so many times, but the world never got on
We thought the best could happen to the ones who can wait
We thought others could save us but have a look at them;
They are all insignificant

Do it for me it you can, in a slow motion, in a slow motion
Blow this endless melancholy, at a slow motion, at a slow motion
Don't let me alone facing it, the world of others, the world of them
Take my hand, tonight I feel insignificant be in it

We can't rewrite the story, I know it's too late
Our prints in time will disappear, I can't deny it
In our fairytales heroes die, princesses never wake up
But let try to find for a last time, enough strength
To arise together

Every minute shouts its sermons
The distress of living flagellates our hearts
In hate of this insignificant world
We can find strength enough to arise

Our life is behind us, far behind
Have a look at them all, they are all insignificant

Do it for me
