When Your eyes will find these words, my reason won't be anymore...
Will you forgive me?

See my decline
Between the flesh and the blood
My soul tired of living is going out
Muses scream their symphony for the dying part of me
What a sad dusk tonight

I spent my life
Waiting for nothing
Expecting this morbid night

Fighting to loose
My mind here like an enraged beast
Shut up vicious voices that shout since years and years
Leave me endless hours and take with you pages
Of my life dirtied by boredom
And you my love, forget me

Madness... take me
The hopes caressing my heart are the fact of your coming
Each beat of it, shapeless bride, will be yours
'cause your the only one

I feel you by my side
Whispering my name
Drying my tears
Here is the term of my wait
Here is the term of my agony

The pure side, guide of my schemes is now leaving my body
Protect me of the fear of the unknown
Prevent me of regretting her love
My reason bleeds on the autel of non-sense
Escaping from its cell: my head broken by shame

Will you forgive me?
Nothing rational left, I must break our promise
The words we shared were too hard to honour for me
