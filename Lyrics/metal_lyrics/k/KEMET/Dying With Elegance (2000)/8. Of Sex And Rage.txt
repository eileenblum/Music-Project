The reflect of the mirror throws me again
The picture of our bodies
In a cold vicious embrace
Vision of sex and rage

Innamorata mia, sink in my eyes,
And you'll feel behind pleasure the strongest embrace

Is it velvet or is it blood that is gliding along my skin?

In this suffocating air, searching for my breath, I can see
Him horrified

Feed my desire with the words, feed my vanity with the looks
Guide my hands I know that we can cross the threshold and
Find together the way to reach immortality

And leave this bastard race, rapist of our existence

Prepare your soul, prepare your mind, this embrace is a ceremony
Hidden behind our golden kiss, lays a pure hate against humanity

Allonge ton corps sur ce lit de narcisses
Prolonge encore, cet instant exquis

I can see him, the Christ on the wall
Horrified, by the scene played under his eyes

Prepare your soul, prepare your mind
Cause the scene we are now playing is the key of everything

In this life, all I could let behind was the scent of your skin, the hate in your eyes,
Was it me the predator or was it you?
In this life, all I could let behind was the memory of your grace,
Your heart beating for mine
Was it me the submitted or was it you?

Making a break through cosmos, the fleed was not blood
It's the hate that's unites us through the lie

The sweet feeling that I felt was my vital fluid escaping

In this life all I could let behind was the scent of your skin, the hate in your eyes,
It was not me the predator... it was you

Ah, the curtain getting down on me, announces the end of all
