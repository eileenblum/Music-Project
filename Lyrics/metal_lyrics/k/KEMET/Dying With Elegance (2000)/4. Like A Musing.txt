Life passes like a sigh around me
The cruel spiral intoxicates me
I'm sinking day by day in this perpetual motion
A slow endless fall written for me

Like a musing, my empty life
Like a musing, a sigh

Life told me the worst lies
And I could only swallow them

I am nothing living the life written for me
I try nothing disgusted by the salt of my tears
Life told to me and I could only swallow them, the worst lies

I don't want to wake up
'cause I don't want to take control

The past is always here like an infidel lover

Promise me there will be no tomorrow
Promise me everything has an end
Promise me soon the shroud will cover me

Life like a musing

I endured so many years
These things so hard to accept
