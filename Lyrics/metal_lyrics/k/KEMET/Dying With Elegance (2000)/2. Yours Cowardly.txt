Am I the one I think, the one I hope
Prisoner of my own state of mind?
Is it me who looks at me through the mirror?
Or is it the betrayer imploring?

The ones I met in my endless nights seem so real
Dreams are war fields, ruined churches on infinite plains
Children live here, they are dying. dying by using
Each of their breaths singing gruesome songs again... and again

Patience
The only way to catch the light
Give me the illusion to live
Give me the rain to wash my past years, give me the wind
To move torments away
Give me the lfame to burn her memory

Time bastard time, cruel enemy
You use your more efficient weapon on me
Chrisantemums now rot on the coffin
You wore her down, now you wear me down
Life like a requiem, a monotonous requiem
Declaration of war! Fire! Water! Air! Take my pain away!

Take my dying planet away!
Take the children that cry away!
Take the doubt haunting me away!
And bring my dignity back.

For me the days have lost all of their savour
Pathetic agony, sadistic oblivion!

A dying wish, a last prayer, show me the boundary ou la nuit s'acheve
Fire!
Water! Air! Take my pain away!

Whe... Did time... Put... its bloody lips... on mine

Of dear mistress, you who gave me a sense to my existence
Oh dear mistress, this dance is a trance to eternity!

...may these landsxapes be mine, and let have a trip to them... together

A trip far from my dying planet, a trip dar from the children that cry.
Bring my dignity back and accept all my apologies

The end seems now so near! Doubts now wear their blackest dress
Open my veins and you will find two colours of blood spilling of them
One for hers and one for mine, the one feeding me, the other poisoning me
Sick and blind, weak and blind, the one I was, the one I am

The sea in which I'm now drowning is the one that she filled with her tears
The sea in which I'm now drowning is deep... enough... to erase... all traces of me.
