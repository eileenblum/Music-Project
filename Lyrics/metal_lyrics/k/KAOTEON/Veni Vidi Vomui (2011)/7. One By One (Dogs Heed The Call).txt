Like pigs, gathered for a feast
Mocking, laughing, slicing, crunching
With jaws dripping, gorging, snatching.
You feed on the entrails of the weak
Mocking, laughing, slicing, crunching
Jaws dripping, gorging, snatching.

The Chaotic order has to be terminated
The rule of the fuck-head, down the shitter
Dim-wits, morons, shit-heads, retards
Fill the streets, dictating a future.

Fuck them all, one by one
The righteous are six feet under
Dogs heed the call, dogs heed the call
Dogs heed the call, dogs heed the call
Dogs heed the call, dogs heed the call
Dogs heed the call, dogs heed the call
Dogs heed the call, dogs heed the call
And unto the streets. Rampage.

I wash my hands of you, and your ego
I wash my hands of you, and your race
I wash my hands of you, and your morals
And this foul belonging.

Like pigs, gathered for a feast
Mocking, laughing, slicing, crunching
You feed on the entrails of the weak.
Mocking, laughing, slicing, crunching
Jaws dripping, gorging, snatching.

Fuck them all, one by one
The righteous are six feet under
Dogs heed the call, dogs heed the call
And unto the streets. Rampage.
