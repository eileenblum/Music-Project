For my sweetest two, life my mentor
And all the cunts I have previously trusted,
All the temptations you have put me through
And the contemplations that came along your warm existence.

Dearest life, you stepped over my dreams
Deprived me of the slightest fragment of hope
Buried me alive, and proved youâre good at nothing but fuck

For all my wretched dearest loves
My most trusted cunts and whores
Only the ingredients of my pukes
May amount your status within me

Au lieu de l'amour vous m'avez rempli de l'haine pure
You object of paradoxical beings.
Respect makes you crown yourselves over me
Neglect succumb you on your knees and beg
