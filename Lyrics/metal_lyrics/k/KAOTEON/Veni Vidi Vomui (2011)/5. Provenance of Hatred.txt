I bid you welcome to my gallery
where my paintings are beheld by the few
the ones who swam across murky waters
and life fed their hunger with despair
those who enswathed their cold bodies
with the stars of the pale horizon
acknowledged sympathy of no form
and feasted upon the morbid banquets of hatred
Within the paintings of my gallery
lurks evil of mortal deeds
within the walls of my gallery
forever your are marked as the child of Cain
marks of pain, marked as the scion of Cain
denounced for a sect you were abducted unto
exiled for what was forced upon you
ostracized for falling to the temptation of a dissimilar love
Enter the suicidal fences
the lair of long dormant hatred
prejudice is what nourishes my Elysium
in a bleeding state of attaint they'll make you dwell
Bane of religion? Or bane of your fanatic existence?
Maggots claiming to be unite under the name of one God!
You've buried your God with your retarded manners
You've soaked your religion in crimson stained shame
carved upon our foreheadsthe mark of Cain
heavily our bodies totter
holding the mark of the slain
I bid you farewell from my gallery
Blessed you are for marching this field of crucifixion
Blessed you are for inhaling its putrid air
Blessed forever we'll be with this mark of damnation
