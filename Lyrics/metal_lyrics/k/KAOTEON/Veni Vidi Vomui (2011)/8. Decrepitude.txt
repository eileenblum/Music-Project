Liar, is each man at heart
A pig in a more sociable form
never can he keep a word
and never can resist the more.
Perjurer, defecate of god
deceiver marked since yore.
You harlots in elegant cloths
molds of mud, can't make gold.
Perverted collections of filthy rot!
slaves of your own desires.
Bags of fart and semen,
mammals of stupid existence.
The seeds of pain you have long sough
have burst emotions of gore
my hatred unleashed, in rivers it streams
as burning lava will melt your bones.
nations ruled by penises
brainless obsessed by the smell of cunts,
giants in the size of cockroach' balls
feeding on the hearts of the living dead.
Mortal, lame mortal, ye concubine,
ruthless, tyrant, enthroned by man,
the crown, he wears, is morbid... putrid,
reigning, coronated by blood shed and lies
with empty promises, he infests his own tribe
feasting on the blood of his brothers
our wrath, of years, long held inside
this land, no longer, will show obedience
hence I label you as you have long marked me
I sentence you with banishments,
expel you from my universe... my society
eventually castigate along... my own self.
