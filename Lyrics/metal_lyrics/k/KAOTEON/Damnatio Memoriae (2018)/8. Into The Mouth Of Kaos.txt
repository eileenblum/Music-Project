The absolute definition of insanity is man's life;
You burn your days, rushing through,
Yet you continuously look back at yesteryear with a sigh,
While still pissing away today.
Over, and over, and over, and over again.
Over, and over, and over, and over again.

An imprisoned easy life instead of freedom,
Domesticated, you surround yourself by people who don't fucking matter,
Intoxicated by poisonous media, slow seated death, for a timely cheque,
Modern slavery for the modern man, drown into the century of panic attacks

This system that man created, is but a virus with a single purpose,
Nothing but self annihilation, it lives off the host until the host is parched.

Driven by an insatiable lust, it performs its natural order and kills itself.
Self termination by depletion,
Day after day after day after day
You hunch to the grave.

To belong to a society that doesn't give a shit
Perform, produce, masticate, reproduce
A dead man's cycle

You did forget how to breathe, how to dream, how to feel, how to care, how to laugh and how to scream
In this Chaotic Eon be a wolf
Break from the herd, from the sheep
Be a wolf, in this chaotic eon

Into the mouth of chaos we descend
Out of the chaos as wolves we're reborn
Into the mouth of chaos we descend
Out of the chaos we drink our skulls full

Into the mouth of chaos we descend
Out of the chaos as wolves we're reborn
Into the mouth of chaos we descend
Out of the chaos we drink our skulls full

Chaos is the one law of nature
Wolves dance amidst its storm
Tame man is a broken man, accept not this absurd world
Refute, refuse, reject, reconnect, recollect, reclaim your mind

Here's to us, the few, we who drink to the stars while we howl at the moon
Ad noctum, for the fabrics of the night love madness and in madness our souls resonate

In this chaotic eon be a wolf
Break from the herd, from the sheep
Be a wolf, in this chaotic eon

Into the mouth of chaos we descend
Out of the chaos as wolves we're reborn
Into the mouth of chaos we descend
Out of the chaos we drink our skulls full
