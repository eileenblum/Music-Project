My heaven differs from yours.
Where is the loving light? Where is the eternal peace?
Desolate, grey, tyrannic, lonesome
Lit with my passion to burn

I do, however, see a kingdom.
Paved by the bones of the innocent
Washed by the blood of the weak
Built for mortals who empty the bowls of the earth
In search of glittering shit
while he rests upon His everlasting throne.

The source of light, warmth and love,
commands the children's hearts to flow with passion,
as it commands their cells cancerous,
To love a figure, so careless, negligent, irresponsible, indifferent
One who made us in his image, hateful, vicious, savage, ruthless
Is to love nothing but filth, oozing with decay,
remnants of fear-worship by an undeveloped mind

Lest I be tested by trials and fears so deep,
My heart prayer to know
A sin to the Wolf in me
An offence I cannot allow

And should my decaying body ask for warmth,
I rather direct it to the raging fire than to this hypocritical light

Fury, wrath, rage,
lust, and sulfur,
you are the bone of my bones,
the essence of my marrow,
my grapes of wrath,
the shadows of my busy days,
the demons of my lonesome nights,
I possess your very existence,
I command thee by the power of my will,
Cloud my beating heart,
cleanse my soul,
ravage my mind till it's free of this weakness,
curse any remains of their existence, of their memory,
Blight upon blight upon blight upon blight upon blight upon blight upon blight upon blight

This worldâs salvation is in one resolution
Retaliate with your nails, your teeth and choke them with your veins
If all fails, curse them from beyond the grave
Eradicate them from all memory, Damnation Memoriae
