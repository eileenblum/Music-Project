Cloak me from the scorching cursed-sun
Parched with no life to drought
These figures roam in absolute chaos and turmoil
Soulless! Purposeless! Tottering emotionless

Life has no toll, death reigns over all
Echoed the dunes across the desert sands

This yellow pit is closing in on me
I'm drowning inside the motionless sands
It's a vortex of pleasures and apathy
A nausea of a distorted reality

Life has no toll, death reigns over all
Echoed the dunes across the desert sands

My flesh burns, refusing this decadence
My final testament will be, a prayer to the Gods of Detriment
Ignite the oil planes, whatever Lord is listening
Democracy to the sands, set it all afire
