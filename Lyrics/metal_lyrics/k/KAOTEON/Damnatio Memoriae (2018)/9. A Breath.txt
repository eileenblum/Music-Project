She, the tempest, a somber sensual divinity
She swallows the moon only for the moon to be reborn through her womb
Her frailty resembles the bones of the earth
Slender, yet no chains could hold her ankle nor her mind

I, Fenrir, the all consuming death
An engulfing darkness which plummets from my lips unto hers
Slithering down her throat, clenching her soul
As her stomach contracts with every blood-red wine breath she draws from mine

We wrap our bodies in a beautiful shroud of black 'til the world is no more
The sickening lie that is light, suffocates
Its absence hides only the fears of the meek
Darkness descends with none but a familiar face

When our nakedness collides, the universe we become
Constellations, energy, life, death and rebirth
Her destructive fire, rages yet subtracts
And the myriad of tongues in which we speak are rendered to none
