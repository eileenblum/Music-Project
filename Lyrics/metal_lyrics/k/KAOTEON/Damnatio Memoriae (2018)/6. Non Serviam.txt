As long as the bloodline dictates the bloodline
I, man, deny, defy, negate the before the afterlife
Curse your revelations, fuck your Armageddon
Free yourself, take my hand and march for doctrine's funeral

Death to all belonging
If a chain dares hold you down
Break its metal by the hammer of will
Belong to no land, kneel to no one

Non fucking serviam
I screamed these words before
Non fucking serviam
I will scream with every breath

Non fucking serviam
I screamed these words before
Non fucking serviam
I will scream with every breath

Hell is here, hell is now
Hell is in the mind of man
Hell is fate, hell is surrender

Hell is here, hell is now
Hell is in the mind of man
Hell is fate, hell is surrender

Non fucking serviam
I screamed these words before
Non fucking serviam
I will scream with every breath

Non fucking serviam
I screamed these words before
Non fucking serviam
I will scream with every breath

Dust to man and man to dust
Eminent, regardless of how low you bow
Dust to man and man to dust
Feed the fire or feed the crow

Non fucking serviam
I screamed these words before
Non fucking serviam
I will scream with every breath
