The preacher lies
Drowning the world into centuries of ignorance
revoking knowledge, revoking strength
Dethroning consciousness, crowning iconography
Aware, beware, from enlightenment to sheepskin.

The preacher lies
Spitting poison through dialects of revelations
Whispering deceit into the wombs of mothers
Planting our fall by seeds of discord
Turning you into lamb of clemency

Cut the head of the snake
Grind your teeth 'til it is done
Silence its venom of exalt
No reverence for reverend nor crown

To forge liberation, nigher
Ignite, sound the crackle of the pyre
Raise the flames higher, higher
Throw them all into the fire

Cut the head of the snake
Grind your teeth 'til it is done
Silence its venom of exalt
No reverence for reverend nor crown

To forge liberation, nigher
Ignite, sound the crackle of the pyre
Raise the flames higher, higher
Throw them all into the fire

From pharaohs of old to pharaohs of gold
Burn your idols and scatter their ashes
Brake your shackles to the ground
Ablaze, inflame and burn them all

Cut the head of the snake
Grind your teeth 'til it is done
Silence its venom of exalt
No reverence for reverend nor crown
