We burn in silence, we burn in pain
Buried under the weight of our collective fears
Terrified of being charged with a felony such as
Being caught exhibiting human sentiments

Quarantined and exiled
Raised at a pedestal
Behold the culprit
A vermin to the system

Do you recall a time of peace?
An absolute absence of war?
Their conflict, our struggle,
never to be won

This world cannot be made by the figures they preach
A light of love and compassion while
Wombs shed tears of blood in mourning
For the lives they add to this sickening world

It's a shame what mankind has become
Mankind, what an oxymoron anyway
We're terrified of talking
Communication has come to an absolute halt

We build walls to shun empathy
We erect cold walls in the name of humanity
We display memorials of our savagery
Which we hang in civilised galleries

We poison ourselves to purge inner-self

This world cannot be made by the figures they preach
A light of love and compassion while
Wombs shed tears of blood in mourning
For the lives they add to this sickening world

It's a shame what mankind has become
Mankind, what an oxymoron anyway
We're terrified of talking
Communication has come to an absolute halt

We build walls to shun empathy
We erect cold walls in the name of humanity
