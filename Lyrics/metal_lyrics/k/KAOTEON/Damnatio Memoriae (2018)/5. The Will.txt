Above the firmament of your gods
Below the pits of their fires
Therein life and the beating heart
Over which you languish over the known and the unknown
It is but the nature of man
Lonely in birth as in death

For we carry nothing to the grave
But the knowledge in this life we gain

Heed be earnest
I beseech thee
Does sulfur flow through your veins?
Do you need to burn?
Or has life scorned you dull?

Has it ever occurred to you
That this calling is but a manifestation
We inherited
The will of Prometheus

We burn in memory of his fire
We shiver for each strike of the eagle
We hunger for freedom

Deliver
Deliver
Deliver
Deliver
Deliver
Deliver
Deliver

Heed be earnest
I implore thee
Do you shiver the nights with a fever seeking answers?
As a rabid beast thirsts for blood
Are you haunted by an unknown hunger?
