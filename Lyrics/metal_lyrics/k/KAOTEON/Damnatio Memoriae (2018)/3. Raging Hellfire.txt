I do not fear the process of damnation
Hell does not petrify me
Third World and Third Gates
We are all Dante here, it's not poetic, it's not an epic
Everyday we burn by a raging fire

The fires of a thousand suns
Rage within my heart
Sulfur flows within my arteries
Seeds of the unjust I witness while you sleep

If you gouge my eyes to shun them from the horror
If you strike my ears with a burning stick to silence the cries
And if these parts believe in your gods of mercy
I promise to cut them off and throw them to wolves

Cursed be the nights
Cursed be the days
Cursed the moments in between

We drown our broken dreams in substance
We poison our veins to forget
We burn in perdition forever

Here, where patriotism and ignorance are strength.
