Everything I want
Is to find myself in the river inside me.
Everything I hope
Is to save ourselves from the horrors in the sky.
For centuries we feared
The anger of Deneb.
For lives we must endure,
'Til the stars lose their bright at once.

At the shadows of lies we live.
At the shadows of stars we hide.
With no will and no chance to fight
That fire is the god that slave us.
In the depths of the sky we lie.
In the mercy of others survive.
With no will and no chance to fight
That heart is the god that slay us.

It's never too late, never too late, never too late.
The prayer of your pride has been answered.
It's never too late, never too late, never too late.
The prayer of your resistance will be answered.

Looking down at the stars with mercy,
The innocent falls to the edge.
Walking alone, for years they're learning
How the power is born.

It's never too late, never too late, never too late.
The prayer of your pride has been answered.
It's never too late, never too late, never too late.
The prayer of your resistance will be answered.

Watching from the abyss as far as the space goes, for the living.
Ask for nothing, and nothing comes,
That's what we are here for.
But it's never too late, to stand up and say
That we'll never regret what's in our past.
So we're waiting to see if our resistance
Would be answered.
It will be answeredâ¦
