There's something in the darkness that always lead us to the light,
As something in the light keeps us focused on the distance.
The horizon awaits for the brave to reach him,
And the brave awaits for the signs in the sky.
They said that three suns will burn the existence.
No hope for the ones who hide, no chance for the fallen victims.
No mourn for the dead.

The concept of a single universe is a paradox.
The perception of reality is a singularity.
The existence is a burden.
The continuum is a black hole.
Known is the pain of the living.
Let them end themselves

Undetermined are the conditions of this judgement, as the pleasure only can be reached by illuminating the lives of the dead with atonement. A single individual can be punished through several layers of faith, justice and pain. But an entire universe must be sentenced to perish in the divine fire of the sunâ¦

They said that there will be no heroes, there will be no blood.
There will be no victory or defeat in this era.
Only darkness and light, fighting side by side.
To claim their right to be gods.
To finally close this act.
To finally become one.

The creation is a lie.
Faith is just an illusion.
The unknown is the coincidence.
The cosmos is an art.
Known is the guilt of the dead.
Let them see the stars

Fierce must be our standing, for the hordes of non-believers could become dangerous to our faith. But don't forget who stands for us. Don't forget who stands between the enemy and us. Don't fall in the desperation; don't put your trust on men and their acts. Just trust in our homeâ¦
