Sacred place, secrets wasted.
Another life, another space.
Another world, another faith.
Another time which visions come to me.
What if the autumn leaves are all we need?
What if the screaming hearts are here 'cause all is real?
All is real.

Take away my soul and let me see.
Ride with me, we'll never come back here.

Anywhere we fly we'll stay away
From all the pain and sadness.
Wherever we may land we will survive,
Under the light of the Three Hearts.

What if the autumn leaves are all we need?
What if the screaming hearts are here 'cause all is real?

Those are the hearts that guide me.
Those are the gods I will believe.
Those are the fires I'm burning.
Those are the skies that make me scream.

"We can make you a non-believer,
We can make you quit your dreaming,
But all we are, we're lights
In the darkest night.
Keep your eyes on the wildest sea,
'cause the deadly wind can break your will
But don't forget to look up to the skyâ¦"

Anywhere we fly we stay away
From all the pain and sadness.
Wherever we may land we will survive,
Under the light of the Three Hearts.

What if the autumn leaves are all we need?
What if the screaming hearts are here 'cause all is real?
