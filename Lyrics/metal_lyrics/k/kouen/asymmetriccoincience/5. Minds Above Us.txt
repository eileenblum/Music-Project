Every night I watch the stars above.
The brightest light once was a small blue fire.

Sitting in the skies I'm falling.
Crossing clouds of thoughts that now are burning.
The man I could have been is now returning
To my home.
This ride won't end for me.

Cold, I was wrong then.
All alone here.
Hope to find my way back home.

What's worth saving, it's fading

I will return to my world on my own,
I will come home but my fate will go on forever

If the hearts come home with me tonight.
I'd let them cry inside my troubled mind.
With the planets I'm tempted to collide.
But my fly will rise.

Tears are raining,
Senses fading.
We are escaping
To the sky.
Minds are failing,
Stars are sailing.
With my last breathe
I will save the sky.

Came to find
Will to fight.

Sitting in the skies I'm falling.
The will to save your lives depends on borders.
Every night I watch the stars above.
The weakest light could turn to thunderous fire.
For once, the innocent could raise their hands
And the life will become a perfect moment in time.
The man I could have been is now returning
To my home.
This ride won't end for me.

Home, I will find the way to go back to you.
I'll comeback for life, I won't die alone)

I will return to my world on my own,
I will come home but my fate will go on forever

Tears are raining,
Senses fading.
We are escaping
To the sky.
Minds are failing,
Stars are sailing.
With my last breathe
I will save the sky
