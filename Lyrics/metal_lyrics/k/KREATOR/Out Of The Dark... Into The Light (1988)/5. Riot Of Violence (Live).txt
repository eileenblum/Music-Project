Greedy for blood
Paralysed by power
The decision to die
Tale of terror
Deep in the corner
Passion to kill
Corpse on the ground
Minds starts to thrill

A man lies in the corner
Covered with blood
Bloody wounds on his body
Praying to his god
People pass him by
But they say
Why should we care about him
He will die today

Riot of violence

Find your own way
You must go alone
Kill all next to you
They want the throne
The infections disease
Is only the life
Scared to death
Die by their knife

A man lies...

Brutality and mighty wars
Have come to take your life
With bombs and guns
The troops have come
To extinguish the light
I'd rather not go wild tonight
But I must save myself

On a field littered with corpses
Stands a lonely flower
It reminds the world how it was
But we kicked it away with power
