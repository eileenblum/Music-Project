Your whole live you've been a misfit in your area
Nobody wants to hang out with a guy like you
But now you've found new friends, you're no longer an inferior
And you act exactly the way they do

Life - your life now seems to make sense
You've got something to obey
The wrong ideals of your friends
But for me it seems you're

Impossible - impossible to cure
The way you think
Is wrong that's for sure
The way you act
Won't bring you no fame
Open your eyes, this ain't no game

Face the truth you will never realize your dreams
As long as we stand against you extreme
Forget it we won't let your dreams come true
Can't you see you're just swimming with the stream

[Repeat chorus]
