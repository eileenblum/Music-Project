Those who serve and those who rule
Lepers, kings and mindless fools
Empire leaders, tyrant's tools
All will fade with time
Hail the cowards, brave at heart
The ugly and the beautiful
Those who never felt their souls
All live transient lives

All side by side
As the tragedy strikes
Fearless through life's joy and pain
Though they are gone
Their spirit lives on
Until our paths cross again

Those who left marks in this place
Those who dreamt they'd move the world
Those whose minds inspired our ways
All the young and stale
All side by side
As the tragedy strikes
Fearless through life's joy and pain
Though they are gone
Their spirit lives on

Until our paths cross again
The end justifies the means, a lifetime of extremes, those that are blind soon shall see
The end justifies the means, a lifetime of extremes, those that are blind, the ones that are blind soon shall see
All will be the mourning ones
All the daughters, all the sons
Still we're here, but soon we're gone
Circle of all life
Let's embrace the time we have
From our birth to our last breath
Don't drown in your memories
For now is your time
The faith of the earth rests on the shoulders of the fallen ones
Know however long the night the dawn will break
Passing the flame from one generation to the next that comes
Stay here, only the soul will remain, only the soul will remain

Only the soul will remain
Only the soul will remain

Mortal are we
Soon blurred memories
Forgotten will be our life's gain
So let it be, whatever may be
Until our paths cross again
