United in hate with the outcasts
United in hate with the weak
Drag the ones who live in darkness back into the light
We can make it happen can't you see
Come and let me take you on a journey
Straight into the centre of your mind
Feel the power of your soul it's infinity
This ignorance is obsolete tonight

We are Legion
We are Legion United in Hate
We are Legion
We are Legion United in Hate

United in hate with the fragile
United in hate with the slaves
More then just another teen rebellion can't you see
This will last until our dying day
Come and let me take you on a journey
Straight into the centre of your mind
Unwitting are the ones who choose to sleep eternally
Never knowing what it's like to be alive

We are Legion
We are Legion United in Hate
We are Legion
We are Legion United in Hate

Raise your voice and rise
Emancipate from betrayal and demise
Rise - don't capitulate
To life's blood parasites
Rise - this is our fate
Come on let's storm the walls
Rise - if we unite
We can bring this empire to fall

We are Legion
We are Legion United in Hate
We are Legion
We are Legion United in Hate
