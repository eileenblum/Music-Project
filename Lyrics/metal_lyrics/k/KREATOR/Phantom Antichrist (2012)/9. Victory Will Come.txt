Creatures falling from the skies
Ancient signs of Armageddon dreams
Fear of conflict terrorize
Taste of demons spreading blood doctrines
Something creeps below the dust
Through the poison and the toxic waste
Strong reaction break the crust
Rise from cities when they form their own
Apocalyptic cult
Our future exists
When sparks become the flame
Let's set the world on fire
Victory will come
Victory will come
Victory will come
And only death will triumph
Victory will come
Victory will come
Victory will come
And only death will triumph over us

Defend the light from deep inside
Storm the thrones of icons from the past
Rip deception from their eyes
Reach for powers that you can not crush
Fuel the dream of anarchy
Armies call for the invincible
Friend and foe obliviate
Activists create the miracle 
Apocalyptic cult
Our future exists
When sparks become the flame
Let's set the world on fire
Victory will come
Victory will come
Victory will come
And only death will triumph
Victory will come
Victory will come
Victory will come
And only death will triumph over us

Die Folter endet nie
Wir werden dennoch siegen
And from the east a locust swarm to heal our scars
Will feast on the sight of emperors vanishing with rats
They cannot break our will if we just overcome ideas
That died
For the future knows our
Victory will come
Victory will come
Victory will come
And only death will triumph
Victory will come
Victory will come
Victory will come
And only death will triumph over us
