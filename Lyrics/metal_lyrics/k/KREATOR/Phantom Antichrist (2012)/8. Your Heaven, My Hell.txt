After all these centuries of teaching godly wrath.
Punishment and after life Pandemonium.
Gods that torture. Gods that judge. Breed the guilt they make you feel.
Minds deceived by psychopaths. I see through the web you weave.

Your heaven, my hell. Your Heaven has become my hell.
You are the virus of this scorched earth.

Your heaven, my Hell. Your heaven will always be my hell.

Fear has possessed the hearts of man. The hearts of man.

Now the angles of justice.
Preparing their decent.
All illusions and poison.

Praying this will be the end.
It shall all fall apart now.
Kill their conscience and desires.
A life time of penetration.

Unchain your soul and end their smiles.

Your heaven my hell. I destroyer of your faith.
Your heaven, my hell. I creator you shall fear my name.

At the end of religion.
My spirit shall not die.
I will only see clearer.
No longer haunted by these times.
I'll be stronger than ever.
No temptation to resist.
So come on, take my hand now.
Let's celebrate the apocalypse.
Your heaven my hell. I destroyer of your faith.

Your heaven, my hell. I creator you shall fear my name.

Let this last farewell be heard across all countries. All cultures, no more cholera Messiahs.
Embrace the dawning of the new earth. Unlike the first, so let them bleed, as a new light shines

Let's kill all gods.
Let's crush the hypocrisy.

My eyes are open wide.

My eyes are open wide.
Your heaven, my hell. I, destroyer
Your heaven, my hell. I creator
Your heaven, my hell.I destroyer
Your heaven, my hell. I creator
Your heaven, my hell.

My eyes are open wide.
