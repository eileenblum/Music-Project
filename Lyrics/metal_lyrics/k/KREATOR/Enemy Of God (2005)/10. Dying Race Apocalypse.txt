The final hours coming
Closing chapter of time
As the embers fade
Not even the strong will survive
Great catastrophe told by the prophets and wise
Those who believe in gods start praying their prayers of lies

Howling wind pouring rain
Rising tides endless days
For the sun and the stars
Never to rise again

Whores and Angels flee
As Babylon burns
Summoned into the void
Never to return
As the waters rise
The grand leveller leads
The future of the new order
Drowning to funeral beats

Kingdom epires fall
Rulers conquerors crawl
No more urge to be free
No more hate tyranny

With the fire comes the storm
Death will call you
I wish you were never born
Infernos demons crawl from the deepest abyss
Dawn of a dying race apocalypse

All comes to an end, roots of all life
Fear greed hypocrisy jealousy lies
Nations tribes every race
All that has been done, godforsaken
All that we've been able to learn
Will be wiped from the earth's face

With the fire comes the storm
Death will call you'll wish you were never born
Infernos demons crawl from the deepest abyss
Dawn of a dying race apocalypse
