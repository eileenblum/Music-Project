Welcome to the coldest age of darkness
Millennium deprivation, deception and deceit
Feared in presence, loathed within their absense
Feed the dogs of war
To keep a fragile peace

All hail dystopia
Your parasite messiah never comes
All hail dystopia
God has died when war drags on and on

Psuedo truth, perversion and religion
Disorder seperates and scatters
Shepherds from the sheep
Tragedy and suicide decisions
Destroyers are not saviours in wartime misery

All hail dystopia
Your parasite messiah never comes
All hail dystopia
God has died when war drags on and on

Gehena abomination
Crypts under the sun
Sacrifice the lives of those dead armies
Marhcing on and on.

All hail dystopia
Your parasite messiah never comes
All hail dystopia
God has died when war drags on and on
