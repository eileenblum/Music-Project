Isolated World in pain the tyrants bitter triumph
Devoted celebrate the empires ice cold victory
Fed their soulless bodies to the vultures and the lions
They're scared to raise their voices in disasters long foreseen

I hate your lives
Falsegood and lies
I hate your World
Your paradise drowns in chaos to breed

World Anarchy
World Anarchy

Kings ruling emptiness and terror over ruins
Fast destruction slow death to all masters of the earth
Kings rulers autocrats in corpse mountain seance
The harvest of all cultures raped by axe and sword

I hate your lives
Falsegood and lies
I hate your World
Your paradise drowns in chaos to breed

World Anarchy
World Anarchy

Coming down

Lost are the weak
Slaves in service for a dream so fake
Religion can't save all those lived without soul
Fall with the prophets and saints as hell
Is burning the last seeds of hope

And the last thing they will see
As their icons fall from grace
A dark horde coming from the east
To bring the old reich to it's grave

Total chaos takes control now

I hate your falsehood and lies
I see your dreams drowning in World anarchy
