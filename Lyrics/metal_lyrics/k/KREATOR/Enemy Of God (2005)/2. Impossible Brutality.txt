All I see is Terror
All I see is pain
All I see is mothers dragging children to their graves
A curse as old as time, An armageddon misery
Spectators of a World in ruins
Hypnotized I'm staring at

Impossible Brutality [x4]

Its all there was, Its all there'll ever be

All I see is violence
All I see is hate
All I see is tyrants dragging servants on a chain
A curse as old as time, An armageddon misery
Spectators of a World in ruins
Paralyzed I'm staring at

Impossible Brutality [x4]

Its all there was, Its all there'll ever be

How much more can you take
Propaganda mind control
From the cradle to the grave
Poisoned fruits to kill the soul
The weak following the blind
Fearful hearted empty eyed
In this mortal plane of slaves
Life's oppressors can not be destroyed

All I see is Terror
All I see is pain
All I see is mothers dragging children to their graves
A curse as old as time, An armageddon misery
Spectators of a World in ruins
Paralyzed I'm staring at

Impossible Brutality [x4]

Its all there was, Its all there'll ever be

And as your World collapses
I'll watch it die in silence
I wish this day would come now
Await it's dawning without fear
