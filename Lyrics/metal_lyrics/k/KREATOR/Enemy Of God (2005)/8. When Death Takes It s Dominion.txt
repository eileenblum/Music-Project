The best minds of a generation slowly disappeared
For every dream that died a fratured soul
All that people fought for lost it's meaning through the years
And those who stood as one turned into acrimonious foes

Where is resistance?
Wiped out and killed
Obey discipline, fear
Facing the end of moral ideals

I come to reclaim
The whole planet and its kingdoms
When Death takes its dominion
Now, bow down I will reign
Golden cities to oblivion
When death takes its dominion through hate

Colonies force fed illusion, hooked upon the line
Denounce all, devils left to judge
Dark wings unfurl, cast the shadow of shameful decline
Yesterdays legends embrace the warmth of mighty death

Where is resistance?
Wiped out and killed
Obey discipline, fear
Facing the end of morals and ideals

I come to reclaim
The whole planet and its kingdoms
When Death takes its dominion
Now, bow down I will reign
Golden cities to oblivion
When death takes its dominion through hate

Ideologies and concepts failed
A sycophantic feast
Laid before his royal satanic grace
A dark reality penetrates, a protest of deceit
Imperialists and subjects face to face
Terror is the shadow of our fear
Terror is the shadow

When death takes its dominion
Everything dies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
