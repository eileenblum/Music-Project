From all the things that wait for you
The blood, tears the destruction
The loss, the mourning and the shocks
That fate still has in store
No magic, no man made belief
Can change your life's cruel journey
And one cursed minute takes away
All pleasures from before

Hand of fate is stronger than us
Bringing pain, bringing sorrow
Crashing down, in a split second change
One Evil comes * A million follow

Never safe from what will be
Things come as they shall come
From first to last all misery
You're dealt with cruel cards
As tortured fear grabs your heart
Fate seems to laugh out loud
Wasting life, doubting all
And counting all the scars

Hand of fate is stronger than us
Bringing pain, bringing sorrow
Crashing down, in a split second change
One Evil comes * A million follow

Though things won't be the same
It's all part of the game
Nothing is left to chance
When fate is dictating the end
