Existance of brutality 
Aggravation infinite greed 
Necrosexuality 
All there's left is hate
All there's left is pain

Mass frustration 
Is the cost 
Global depression 
Life stands still all love is lost 

No experience too extreme 
Orgasmic pleasure, abstract dreams 
Mercyless perversity 
All there's left is hate
All there's left is pain

Mass frustration
Is the cost 
Global depression 
Life stands still, all love is lost 

Hate cannot die forever alive 

Mass frustration
Is the cost 
Global depression 
Life stands still, all love is Lost
