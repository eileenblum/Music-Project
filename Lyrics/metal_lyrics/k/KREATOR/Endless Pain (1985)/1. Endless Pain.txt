You cry out the aggression that
is your every day
You want to kill the enemies
if they cross your way
In your heart is hate terror
is freezin' your bones
The night is so dark and you're all alone
The voice of Hell sound is so nice
The final death is the price
You can't wait much longer
to give'em what they need
You'll burst down their heads
and spread hellish heat
Feel the endless pain locked in metal chain [2]
Green and red monsters torment your mind
The power of death will destroy the mankind
You'll die fast you don't feel much pain
But why you will never know, it's a hellish game
Feel the endless pain locked in metal chain [2]
