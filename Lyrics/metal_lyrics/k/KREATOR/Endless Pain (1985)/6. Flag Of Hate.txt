Dark shadows lie over the city
Tonight someone will die, you can hear
Some painful scream the air is full of flies
The mayhemic legions are ready
to steal the human souls
Come into my vault and do what you've been told
I'll eat your intensities no matter
if you pray or please
I'll bring you down to your knees
Tonight you're gonna meet your fate
You'll try to run but it's too late
I am here to liquidate
[Chorus]
Time to rise your Flag of Hate
Destroy the world is our only aim
To strike'em down is the only way
To make'em dead and make'em pay
The gallow of the underground
snipers on the sea of blood
All what we want is to crucify your "God"
The posers on this Earth have no right to live
We gonna spit their brains torture
is what we give
