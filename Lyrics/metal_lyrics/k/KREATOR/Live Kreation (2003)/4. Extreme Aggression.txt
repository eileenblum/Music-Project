Extreme aggression
From an extremely insane mind
Resting unconscious
Pushed up by white lines
Inhuman violence
I never thought it would come this far
Sadistic intensions
My greed for blood is growing more
And more

[CHORUS]

Extreme aggressions
Seeing you suffer bring pleasure to me
Extreme aggressions
My aggressions became to extreme to be
Kept under control

Hallucinations
From the darkest part of my brain
I still can't believe it
I'm really insane
I heard you pleading
But no one hears the screams
Of this soul of mine

[CHORUS REPEATS]

Society, what have you done to me
Society, bring you to your knees

Once before I die
Now that I have lost the will to live
Once before I die
I'll take revenge on
Those who's led me to

Extreme aggressions
My emotions, twisted by your lies
Extreme aggressions
Condemned my soul to hell for all time
