Existance of brutality
Agravation infinite greed
Necrosexuality
All there's left is hate
All there's left is pain

Mass frustation
Is the cost
Global depression
Life stands still, all love is lost

No experience too extreme
Orgasmic pleasure, abstract dreams
Mercyless perversity
All there's left is hate
All there's left is pain

Mass frustation
Is the cost
Global depression
Life stands still, all love is lost

Hate cannot die, forever alive

Mass frustation
Is the cost
Global depression
Life stands still, all love is lost
