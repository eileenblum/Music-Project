Jealousy has turned a man into a demon
Wounded from deep within
Love has turned to hate so murder fantasies
Beyond all reason can begin

And so your heart it fills with rage
Driven by words that sealed your fate
There's nothing left as we descent
Upon your Bitter Sweet Revenge

Pain grows stronger than you ever thought it could
Kiss of Judas brings deceit
Necromancer waits biding time
The serpent's venom taste bittersweet

Outbreak of panic, once oppressed
Crisis of anger self possessed
On mental scars shadows descend
Upon your Bitter Sweet Revenge

Taken quickly with precision
Pay for all repulsive lies
What once started as a vision
Becomes reality's demise

Anger is coming like a lust now
Eating slowly through your mind
Everlasting penetration
Ignore the fear deep in the eyes

There ain't no love without hate
There's no existence without fate

There's no beginning without end
There's no betrayal without revenge
