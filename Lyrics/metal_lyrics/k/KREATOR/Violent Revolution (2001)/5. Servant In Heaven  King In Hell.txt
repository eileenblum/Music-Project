Some may struggle and some may fall
One only follows, another one leads
And while some only endure constant slavery
Others satisfy their never ending greed

Some born to win, some born to loose
What fate may come, only time can tell
Better to live in sin than nothing else to choose
Servant In Heaven, King In Hell

Some may give and some may take
One only suffers others celebrate
And while some know that their time will never come
Others realise that it's never ever too late

Some see the dark, some see the light
What's in your view only time can tell
Better to taste the fire than swallowed by the night
Servant In Heaven, King In Hell

Some are cast aside as anger blinds the mind
Baptised in flames to lead again
To see them take it all a tearing of the heart
A thousand reasons for your hate
