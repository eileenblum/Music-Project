Slave Machinery existence once devoured never to escape
Despotic hierarchy ruled with terror eternity enslaved

And the gearwheels of enslavement keep on turning every day
Extinguish hopes the moment they first walk through the gates
Sounds of penetration screaming through the factory
Foundation for a Slave Machinery

Slave Machinery keeps feeding on controlled manipulated lives
Fabric of depression for a future now history has died

Just a functional endurance like a puppet on a string
Never realising they have taking everything
Ultra steel construction to dictate your destiny
Foundation for a Slave Machinery

All you've never meant to be
All you've never meant to see
All those demons in your sleep
Sacrificed grace for deceit

And the gearwheels of enslavement keep on turning every day
Extinguish hopes the moment they first walk through the gates
Sounds of penetration screaming through the factory
Foundation for a Slave Machinery
