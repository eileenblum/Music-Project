Society failed to tolerate me
And I have failed to tolerate society
Still I can't find what you adore
Inside I hear the echoes of an inner war
Nothing can take the horror from me
Your sick world the loss of all morality
My hate has grown as strong as my confusion
My only hope my only solution
is a Violent Revolution

Violent Revolution, Violent Revolution
Reason for the people to destroy

I do not need a cause for my rage
I just despise the nature of the human race
When all I see is repulsion and hate
Violence becomes my only friend, my saving grace
When love is lost beyond your control
A pale shadow of lust can not enlight your soul
So keep your ice cold bitter illusions
I don't need your empty world my only solution
is a Violent Revolution

Violent Revolution, Violent Revolution
Reason for the people to destroy

Beauty is no more it's all gone
And utopia will not come
Trust I can not feel, only pain
And my burning mind has gone insane
