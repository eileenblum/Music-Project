So set your mind on fire
And burn all bridges down
Ashes are left behind to lead you
Further underground

From this void of confusion
Into a sphere of light
Hypnotic great illusion
Keeps this bitter world outside

Nothing here to break you now as Eden becomes real
Nothing that can take away the pleasures that you feel
Orgies between ruins on the treasures of desire
Offered as a gift from god now as your time of suffering expired

Mind On Fire

To set your mind on fire
Brings total liberty
And as your soul burns
You'll awake in purest fantasy

And all those haunting demons
That live inside your head
Fade in this shining freedom
Where the angels fear to tread

Voices getting clearer now can you hear them call
Voices from a higher place mystifying all
Voices will not disappear in this souls empire
Voices of transgression ancient opium to take you higher

Mind On Fire

Holy drug of kings and queens
Like a cancer on the face of desire
For reality is not what it seems
And the rules were written down by a liar
