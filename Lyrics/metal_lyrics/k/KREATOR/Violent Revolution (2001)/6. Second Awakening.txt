Two thousand years of oppression
Slowly intelligence died
Bringing another obsession
Singing the songs of the blind

Two thousand years of devotion
Misery conquered the mind
Finally found a way out of this terror
Before final death of the soul killed your sight

The Second Awakening
Finally reborn together we're standing
Now the time has come

The Second Awakening
Things wont be the same
As the spirit awakes again

Come praise those years for progression
Come curse those years for it's wars
Blood thirst and endless aggression
Governments put into force

Two thousand years of confusion
Finally come to an end
Cleaning the earth from this spiritual poison
Before a new chapter of life can begin

The Second Awakening
Finally reborn together we're standing
Now the time has come
The Second Awakening
Things wont be the same
As the spirit awakes again

Raise your hand
As we transcend
Time to rise
Reawakening

Raise your hand
As we transcend
Time to rise
Reawakening
