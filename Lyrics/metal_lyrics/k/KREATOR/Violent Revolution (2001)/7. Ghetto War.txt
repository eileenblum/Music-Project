Out there in the shadows of suburbia
Minds consumed by substance only cold hearts survived
A gathering of mutants in disorder
Way below the surface something is still alive

Confrontation, terror is the law
Beneath the ruins of this Ghetto War!
Ghetto War

Losers in this sickening Reich of Mammon
Penetrate realities of fake plastic men
Side by side their heads filled with adrenaline
Nothing stops this hate flow now the war begins

Confrontation terror is the law
Beneath the ruins of this Ghetto War!
Ghetto War

Energy explodes as one
Neon rays erased the sun
Bitter end of harmony
Filled with hate and misery
