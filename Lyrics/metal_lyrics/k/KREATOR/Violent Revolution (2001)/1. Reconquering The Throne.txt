Paralyse the actions of the weak
Force fed propaganda preying on the meek
Individuals resisting defeat
Manipulate the colonies, infected by their seed

Vampires of possession
Shroud of cold distrust
Watching as you finally fall
Then drag you through the dust
The only way to save your soul
From scum with hearts of stone

Reconquering The Throne

Parasites have drained you from your mind
Anesthisize your conscience infliction will take time
Fools once trusted, guilty of the crime
Suck deep upon your energy, delusions lead the blind

Our rising has begun

A million hearts
not alone
Light the spark
Storm the throne!
