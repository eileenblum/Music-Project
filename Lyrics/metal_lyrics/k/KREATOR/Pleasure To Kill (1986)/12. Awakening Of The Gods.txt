Was it a vision or was it a dream
Trust of the mankind has never been real
Gods of pleasure, gods of pain
Gods of terror, of life and of hate

Mortality is endless when gods start to pray
Life becomes worthless by nuclear death
They're watching from above it could happen every day
Watching their terror and care in no way

Time is important to your life and your death
Controlling your mind it is only a test
As it controls you, prepared to watch you
Are you sure it's a real life?

See their eyes filled with lies
Watch the slaughter, endless night
Make you scream, make you cry
You know you're helpless till the end of time
Awakening of the gods

Burning ambitions, your lusts and your wills
Your plans of life, goals and your thrills
Days of laughter, days of crying
Your living to your fate on borrowed time

Nothin' has worth, nothing is real
Nothing is important, no way you feel
This cannot be the only life,
It could begin when you die

No one can imagine where you will be
Where you have been before your birth you will see
Watched and controlled is your life in every way
Planned and controlled on every single day

See their eyes, filled with lies
Watch the slaughter, endless night
Make you scream, make you cry
You know you're helpless till the end of time
Awakening of the gods

Manipulated by human feelings
You're walking through this life
Searching for the meaning of all
But it's something you'll never find
Accept all that happens to you
Be prepared for torture and pain
You know there's nothing you can do
Only your death will close the reign

You've seen the good times
But you've also have seen the bad
Damned to mortality
Damned is your life for death
Created for this mystery
Why is this your fate
Only the future will show
Or maybe you will never know

Was it a vision or was it a dream
Trust of the mankind has never been real
Gods of pleasure, gods of pain
Gods of terror, of life and of hate

Mortality is endless when gods start to pray
Life becomes worthless by nuclear death
They're watching from above it could happen every day
Watching their terror and care in no way

Time is important to your life and your death
Controlling your mind it is only a test
As it controls you, prepared to watch you
Are you sure it's a real life?

See their eyes filled with lies
Watch the slaughter, endless night
Make you scream, make you cry
You know you're helpless till the end of time
Awakening of the gods
