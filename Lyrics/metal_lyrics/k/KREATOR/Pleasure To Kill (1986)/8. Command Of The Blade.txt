Mist is falling as he rides over the land
With his blade of steel
He is comin' to take you
He has seen the battles of the damned

He lost an' won
He is coming to break your
Flesh and bones

Scared to scream, scared to cry
Await your fate, no one will save you
You're damned to die

Warrior of the king, mission to kill
Death to all, his aim is to give you
Command Of The Blade

When you fall his mission is complete
He's gonna get you
Command Of The Blade

His hair is black, his eyes are glowin' red
He's seeking for you he wants to rape you
His lifeless body has decayed long ago
His skeleton's riding
Comin' to break your neck and back

Scared to scream, too late to cry
Your fate is here, you hear it's steps
Now you die

Warrior of the king, mission to kill
Death to all, his aim is to give you
Command Of The Blade

He will laugh as you fall
His aim is to give you
Death!!!

When you die by his blade
Your corpse'll lie here to decay
No one will miss your dumb face
No one be left there to pray

The Kreator rides back to his kingdom
To receive another command
Soon he will be back here
To conquer and rule over the land

Command Of The Blade
