You have pushed me to this hell
Put this cancer in my head
Raped my soul and vandalised my heart
Now this conflict deep inside
My hate I can no longer hide
For today this end will have a start
My anger aims
At a different target now
I could have left, I could have fled
For now my name
Will forever be remembered
I am the bringer of light
To the living dead
I cannot take it anymore
My sight, my view becomes distorted
My martyrdom has now begun
Watch me today you'll see me

Run amok run
Run amok run
Run amok run
Run amok run

Face me on this my glorious day
I bring torment and decay
For the scars you branded
Deep inside my soul
Kill all the victims I can score
Viscous bloodlust, give me more
This is punishment that nothing
Can control my final

Run amok run
Run amok run
Run amok run
Run amok run

Pain I have lived in endless pain
Now I pay it back in spades
Burning panic, ice cold fear is in their eyes
Blood is the last thing that I see
Sacrifice and agony

On my final day you'll have
To die with me for now I

Run amok run
Run amok run
Run amok run
Run amok run

This is my amok run
Violence climac so pure
This is my amok run
Bloodbath total massacre

For now I touch the hand divine
Walking straight into the light
This is where it all must end, my friends
Today I'll die like Jesus Christ
