Atheists with a strong believe
In the powers of intuition
Fundamentalists, a lying truth
Cultural bigotry
Warlords, loss of freedom
Democratic anachronism
The people rage beyond control
Paris burns again

All addicted to the dark side of life
Cast out but not alone
We're the ones that will not compromise
Antidote to slavery, suffering and war

Now the time has come for us
Unite to fight
Unite to fight
Unite to fight
Unite to fight
Radical resistance now!

Terrorists with a strong belief
In afterlife salvation
Mobs of mute citizens
Purifiers of the throne
Aggressive Christianity
Poison for the troops
Infant soldiers die for peace
Bleeding innocence at the front

All addicted to the dark side of life
Cast out but not alone
We're the ones that will not compromise
Antidote to lies both new and old

Now the time has come for us
Unite to fight
Unite to fight
Unite to fight
Unite to fight
Radical resistance now!

People from the east
People from the west
Everywhere under the sun
People from the north
People from the south
Kill the unkillable as one
As one as one as one!

People from the east
People from the west
Everywhere under the sun
People from the north
People from the south
Kill the unkillable as one
Unite to fight
Unite to fight
Unite to fight
Unite to fight
Radical resistance
Unite to fight
Unite to fight
Unite to fight
Unite to fight
Radical resistance now!
