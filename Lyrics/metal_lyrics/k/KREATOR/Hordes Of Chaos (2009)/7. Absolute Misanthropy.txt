You don't know how much I hate you
And always will
I'll never crawl before your thrones
You don't know the day will come soon
When we will kill
The final holocaust for your dark hearts

Feels like I'm on poisoned adrenaline
Aggro-toxic amphetamine
This one goes out to the ones I hate
Poisoned adrenaline
Socio terror on endorphins

Come join my philosophy
- Absolute misanthropy!

Feels like I'm on poisoned adrenaline
Aggro-toxic amphetamine
This one goes out to the ones I hate
Poisoned adrenaline
Socio terror on endorphins

Come join my philosophy
- Absolute misanthropy!

Pain after pain
Sin after sin
You'll be the ones that will suffer
The soul always burns as
The body decays
All that I'm able to feel

Absolute misanthropy
Absolute misanthropy
Absolute misanthropy
I can't wait for you to die!
