This is what you get for trying
To take our dignity away from us
A massive unexpected global outbreak
The grim face of protest

Violence, total violence unlike anything
You have ever seen before
Now the bomb's exploding
In your face detonating

Escalation
Escalation
Escalation
Praying for a total escalation
To free the human race

This is what you get for indoctrination,
Years of mental rape
Forward to a world without religion
False hope and blind faith
Violence, total violence unlike anything
You have ever seen before
Boiling up from under to attack
Celebrate the

Escalation
Escalation
Escalation
Praying for a total escalation
To free the human race

Gods of revenge live inside us
They never sleep
Dreaming of toppling empires
Take to the streets
No matter what they try tell you
You can break free
Organised unrest and
Turmoil brings victory

Let the conflict begin
Bitterness from within
Drives the hears of all nations
Brings down elders and kings
Let the conflict begin
Bitterness from within
I am praying to see
A worldwide escalation
