This time, this age
This youth, in rage
Enslaved for life
A fire burns in paradise

Tyrant savior they call out
To you like Babylon's great whore
As in darkness they are dying
In this cold and senseless gore
And the lamb reject reality forever
Use perception to ignore, forever ignore

Till all misery of life fades away
With all of its horror and deeds inhumane
Where leaders of men have ruled,
Lead our souls forever astray
When all of these nightmares
Have come to an end
To hell the crucified will descend
Will those who live on after our end
Worship the crosses again,
Worship the crosses again?

Tyrant saviour they are sinking
I can feel their auras dream
Mourning scenes a burning paradise
For centuries they will scream
A kaleidoscope of echoes I am hearing
Black enormous mighty roam a nighty roar

Till all misery of life fades away
With all o f its horror and deeds inhumane
Where leaders of men have ruled,
Lead our souls forever astray
When all of these nightmares
Have come to an end
To hell the crucified will descend
Will those who live on after our end
Worship the crosses again,
Worship the crosses again?

Life is filled with nothing
But a vacuum deep inside
From one generation to the next
They spread the oldest lie
Pure depression's breaking out
A youth that's doomed to die
Beneath the surface anger lives
That nothing can disguise
No perspective for the lost,
Nothing's left to loose
Armies of the underground
With powers to refuse
Choose to follow poisoners
An omnipresent pest
You'll never be different than the rest

This is a warning to the afterborn
This is a warning to the afterborn
This is a warning to the afterborn
This is a warning to the afterborn

To the afterborn
To the afterborn

Final warning to the afterborn

To the afterborn
To the afterborn

Will the ones who live after our end
Worship the goddamn cross again?
