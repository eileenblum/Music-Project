Violent chaos haunting me
Mirror of countless human tragedies
Times of horror, constant lies
Totalitarians autocracy's demise
Fake peace a necrologue for the elite
Brutality among the weak
While children die for Armageddon victory's breed
This necrologue for the elite
Like raging beasts among the sheep
While flags are waving everywhere
They scream

Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Everyone against everyone - chaos
Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Everyone against everyone - chaos

Brutal riots left and right
Out to destroy, willing to die
Honour killing in blood is shed
A cruel reality in empires built in sand
Dark war, more gruesome then ever before
Supports this decadence galore
A tyrants feast on shoulders
Of the poorest of the poor
The necrologue for the elite
The rise of the heartless bourgoise
While flags are waving
Everywhere they scream

Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Everyone against everyone - chaos
Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Everyone against everyone - chaos

Ultra riot!

Ultimate crimes
Ultimate hate
Ultimate war
Ultimate fear
Ultimate pain
Ultimate terror
Ultimate death
Ultimate sin
Ultimate scorn

The ultimate control of masses of everyone

Now scream!
Now scream!

Everyone against everyone
Chaos
Everyone against everyone
Chaos
Everyone against everyone
Chaos

Everyone against everyone
Everyone against everyone
Everyone against everyone
Everyone against everyone
Everyone against everyone
Everyone against everyone
Against everyone
Against everyone
Against everyone
Against everyone
Against everyone

Hordes of Chaos!
