Thrown into sorrow
Raised into fear
Shadows of heartless commandments
Wasteland of zombies
That never lived
A ghetto grey and grey
A future so black
A past so extreme

A boy in a shell
The chains around your wings
To block your integrity
Before they will be amputated

Amputated!

Where the dogmatic
Ignorant rule
The spirit must agonize
Empire of Satan
Realm of the damned
Here in the Kingdom of Lies
This is out time
This is out war
A world wide collective
You won't walk alone
Passing out weapons
To future generations

Disobey the Oppressor
Refuse Demon Prince
Disobey The Oppressor
Forever Demon Prince

[Solo: Mille]

Disobey the Oppressor
Refuse Demon Prince
Disobey The Oppressor
Forever Demon Prince

Now in the burning embers
Conspiracy is born
The captive will remember
Sow the wind, harvest the storm

And from the ancient ashes
A brand new force is born
To liberate the masses
Sow the wind, harvest the storm

Disobey the Oppressor
Refuse Demon Prince
Disobey The Oppressor
Forever Demon Prince

[Solo: Sam]

Demon Prince
Demon Prince
AAAAARGH!

Kill Demon Prince
