Destroy what destroys you
The world shall awake
The chains of society
Are laws ripe to break
And the fear they're feeding us
The prejudice and hate
Will not tear us apart
Till the end of our days

Destroy what destroys you
Time has come to awake

Destroy what destroys you
In god-forbidden land
Resurrect the dream you've lost
Before you regret
Our souls may be darkened
But we see the light
The source of our inner strength
Is power that cannot die

Destroy what destroys you
Time has come to awake

Destroy what destroys you
Destroy what destroys you
Destroy what destroys you
Time has come to awake

Destroy what destroys you
Destroy what destroys you
Destroy what destroys you
Time has come to awake

Time has come to awake!
