You'll see us coming like a killer swarm
Hunting infidels erase their souls
Our viscious regiment cruel to the core
Brings liberating death unholy war
Army of storms no one will survive
Rising from the ruins of
A culture in decline
Scattered in thousands they will lay
A bourgeois decadance but without faith

For tornados and hurricanes
Will not hold us back
Ultra void as the ultimate deception
Ride the winds broken free
Now revolt and you will see
Nations and empires reborn
Beyond the blood red horizons you'll hear us

Ride
Army of storms
Ride
Army of storms

You'll see us coming with a newfound creed
Eternal doom a blessing for the meek
Army of storms darkness of deceit
Will crush the thrones of inhumanity
So let's invoke lessons from the past
As we shed the blood of olympus
Hell below purgatorium above
And build a church for the rest of us

For tornados and hurricanes
Will not hold us back
Ultra void as the ultimate deception
Ride the winds broken free
Now REVOLT AND YOU WILL SEE
Nations and empires reborn
Beyond the blood red horizons you'll hear us

Ride
Army of storms
Ride
Army of storms

And if we should die they will die with us
If we should fall they will fall with us
All we have all we have is now all
Our voices will be heard
Through the storm

Ride ride ride
