Come experience hate like you never have before
Spreading from the fallen Tower of Babel
Bread and circuses means
To keep us from the truth
Traces of resistance overthrown
In a time when prejudice cuts
Deeper than a blade
Our pioneers become disciples
The old must stay connected
With the passion of our youth
And realise our time our time has come
We're not afraid to live
We're not afraid to die
We are the antidote to the radicalized
And as the cities drown in bloodbaths worldwide
We will survive

Totalitarian terror
Welcome the destroyer
Wielder to strike
Totalitarian terror
Feeding the oppressor
Resistance must rise when freedom has died

Come experience cruelty - indescribable
As the system bursts into pieces
Don't let revolution lose
Its crushing energy
We are here to keep the spark alive
Propagating hate campaigns
Are coming to an end
Dethroning kings by civil disobedience
This is our redemption
We are stronger than the rest
Now realise, our time has come

We're not afraid to live
We're not afraid to die
We are the antidote to the radicalized
And as the cities drown
In bloodbaths worldwide
We will survive
Totalitarian terror

Welcome the destroyer
Wielder to strike
Totalitarian terror
Feeding the oppressor
Resistance shall now rise
When freedom has died

When all the flags turn red
And all the hearts turn black
The bridges have collapsed
The darkness light the stars
The ignorant slept among
And all the children wake
To form the Apocalypticon

We're not afraid to live
We're not afraid to die
We are the antidote to the radicalized
And as the cities drown in bloodbaths
Worldwide
We will survive

Totalitarian terror
Feeding the oppressor
Resistance must rise
When freedom has died
