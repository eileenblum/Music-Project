Watch the mortals
From above
As they destroy
Everything they love
And all the faces without
Names devoured into the
Roaring flames Aaargh
Burn in flames

Through the clouds I'm diving
Over Babylonian fields Below the stars
Beyond material dreams
Manifest my independence this is true belief
This nightmare they call life is not for me

This is my time this is my fight
In bareness darker than the night
An alloy of conflict and strife
Nothing can touch me
As I fly

I fly on a lion with eagle wings
Up into the black sky
On a lion with eagle wings
See me fly on a lion with eagle wings
High above in the sky
On the lion with eagle wings

I live my life with no regrets
In perfect harmony
From waters I emerge
On the first beast
Under tyrant's whip they live
A life in slavery
As elders mourn a youth they can't relive

This is my time this is my fight
In bareness darker than the night
A sea of tears, conflicts and strife
It now means nothing as I fly

As I fly on a lion with eagle wings
Up into the black sky
On a lion with eagle wings
See me fly on a lion with eagle wings
High above in the sky
On the lion with eagle wings

Far from above I'm watching a hell with no end
A nightmare unfolds never to escape me again
A skeletal field where flowers will never cohere
Spiral downwards into the dust of flesh and fear

As I fly on a lion with eagle wings
Up into the black sky
On a lion with eagle wings
See me fly on a lion with eagle wings
High above in the sky
On the lion with eagle wings
