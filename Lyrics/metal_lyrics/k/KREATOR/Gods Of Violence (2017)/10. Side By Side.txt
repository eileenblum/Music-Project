For you everything seems lost
No dignity nor pride
Sovereign contempt every day of your life
I know how it feels to be the one they hate
In solidarity we spit into their ugly face

Side by side
Side by side
Side by side
And if death will be the price
Or the sun will no longer rise
I'll be by your side

You are confronted by all
All the ignorant and weak
In nations ruled by wolves
In countries owned by pigs
Pharisees at rage
They are judging the unseen
Intelligence extinct conformists
Afflicted by their plagues

Side by side
Side by side
Side by side
And if death will be the price
Or the sun will no longer rise
Side by side
To eternity and beyond
Side by side

As we crush homophobia
Side by side
And we'll never let the shame
Turn our vision to ice
And I'll remain by your side

To you who face the wrath of sacrosancts
To you who feel despised or un beloved
To you who's hope is killed
By the pestilence in their eyes
I'll be by your side

Side by side
To eternity and beyond
Side by side
As we crush homophobia
Side by side
And we'll never let the shame
Turn our vision to ice
And I'll remain by your
Side by side
To eternity and beyond
Side by side
We'll crush homophobia
Side by side
And we'll never let the shame
Turn our vision to ice
And I'll remain by your Side

Side by side
Side by side
