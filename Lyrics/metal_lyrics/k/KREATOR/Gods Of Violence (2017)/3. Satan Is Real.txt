Martyrs
You cannot kill us all
Vengeance will come as a shock
Destroy us
Let the clarion listen
Among the wolves
We'll eat the pack

There'll come a day
When no man shall survive
In this graveyard of desire
In due time you'll realize

Satan is real
Satan is real
Horror for tyranny
Human catastrophe
Satan is real
Satan is real
Open your eyes and you'll see
Satan is real

Indulger
Destruct for the weak
You will never wipe the dreams from our minds
Reverence
Your lies are obsolete
Now come along
Let the one-eyed lead the blind

There'll come a day
A brand new sun
Brighter than the one that we have seen
Embracing him
The bringer of sin

Satan is real
Satan is real
Curse of reality
Spiral of tragedy
Satan is real
Satan is real
Come crown the lord of the future

Satan is real
Satan is real
Horror for tyranny
Human catastrophe
Satan is real
Satan is real
Open your eyes and you'll see

Satan is real
Satan is real
Curse of reality
Spiral of tragedy
Satan is real
Satan is real
Can you resist the temptation
Satan is real
