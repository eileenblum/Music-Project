Hypnotized by the masses
And a future torn apart
Agony, the final conflict
Hatred yet ignored
Love is colder than death
And in coldness we'll remain
Everlasting territories
Freedom lies in chains

Destroying dreams against all norms
They spread it all across the earth
Dominion without a form
Winter martyrium

Dead civilization on a mission
Lead by gods
Etiquette creates a cause
To turn your back from life
Secrets never told before
Construct culture absurd
Hit you like a shellshock
As integrity has died

Destroying dreams against all norms
They spread it all across the earth
Dominion without a form
Winter martyrium

Wide awake to the end
Wide awake to the end

Crisis and perpetual incest
Performance of a nameless act
Sadness takes your concentration
Individual cages that we face

Destroying dreams against all norms
They spread it all across the earth
Dominion without a form
Winter martyrium for masses
And a future torn apart
Agony, the final conflict
Hatred yet ignored
