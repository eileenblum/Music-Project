Let there be darkness
Let there be blood tonight
Let there be riots
Come start the fires tonight
Can't you see our people have got no choice but to fight them back?
Can't you see the change of consciousness demands a total attack?
Total attack
Finally they're swarming in
A long forgotten youth
The cause of inequality
A paradise for few
Superior, inferior
A vast insanity
When justice is tyranny
Anarchy is breaking out
Destruction marks their way
Burning temples turning into
Dark crypts of decay
The mighty are the fallen now
The weak are on the hunt
Battle on many fronts
There will be darkness
There will be blood tonight
Now let the riots begin
Convulsed by protest
At civilization collapse

Monumental terror
Spreading like a pestilence
From suburbs to the center
Of colossal arrogance
Cascade of aggression
Merely harvest seeds of hate
Storming the barricades
Cities of inception
Burn to ashes in one night
Imperators crying at this grand historic sight
Entering a death spiral tonight they see their fate
Doomed to reincarnate

There will be darkness
There will be blood tonight
So let the riots begin
A social unrest
At civilization collapse
