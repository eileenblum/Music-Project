Wolfchild

You are born
With the soul of a wolf
Pain in your heart
Raging your blood
But they will never understand what you are
You belong to the hunters of truth
Pain in your heart
Raging your blood
Freedom screams for the monarchs meet
But you will keep it forever alive

Wolfchild!
Is in your blood!
Wolfchild!
Is in your blood!
Wolfchild!
Is in your blood!
Never follow, live to lead
Never follow, live to lead!

Those pass
The glories of the world
Raising your voice
Feel your choice
Fight your way through the single piece
And the hard trails
You are the undefeatable one
I'll break the wall
Medals to all
Bitterness come nothing on you
Never forget you are a...

Wolfchild!
Is in your blood!
Wolfchild!
Is in your blood!
Wolfchild!
Is in your blood!
Never follow, live to lead
Never follow, live to lead!

Wolfchild!
Is in your blood!
Wolfchild!
Is in your blood!
Wolfchild!
Is in your blood!
Never follow, live to lead
Never follow, live to lead!

Wolfchild!
Is in your blood!
Wolfchild!
Is in your blood!
Wolfchild!
Is in your blood!
Never follow, live to lead
Never follow, live to lead!
