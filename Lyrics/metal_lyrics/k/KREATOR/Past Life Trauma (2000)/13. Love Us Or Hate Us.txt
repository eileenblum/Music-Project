[M: Petrozza/Reil/Fioretti/Trzebiatowski Â· L: Petrozza Â· cMaldoror]

[People told me that the thing they like most about this song are the lyrics. A statement against the music industry and for musical integrity. A little tricky to perform live though..........]

Don't try to tell us what is right for us
We don't give a fuck anyway
Don't try to steal imagination from us
Things we believe we will never betray

Those who have the power to
Suck us dry - throw us away
Those who never could create
Destroy the music of today

Those devoid of any feeling
Those who make the compromise
Betray themselves to make a deal
Sell their soul at any price

Sounds without feeling, energy or aggression
From money hungry brains and not from the heart
Fortune, fame and glory are their obsessions
Salesmen, deaf of music, blind to art

No honesty, just sterility
A cautious sound they make without creativity
It's still the same as another age
When they took the words of truth and put them to a flame

No more
Love us or hate us
No more
Love us or hate us

Some have eyes and still can't see
Their plastic noise is anything but music to me
mechanized and computerized
Switch off your brain and make sounds that
dehumanize

No more
Love us or hate us
No more
Love us or hate us

Don't try to take our dreams away from us
We will never be like you
Love us or hate us, it doesn't matter to me
We don't want to be a part of this sick society

[Taken from the album "Extreme Aggression" Â· 1989]
