[I gave this song a new title since it is the first version of "Winter Martyium", only available on the "Renewal" demo. Listening to the song today I wonder why it did not make it onto the album. Especially the lyrics are cool since they deal with the typical autumn/winter depression I have to go through every year of my life. The drumming is amaz-ing, respect to Ventor at this point.]

Passing of perception unforseen reaction
Staring out the window into the ice cold air
Memories of summer causing my depression
Through concentrated death and rainfall of despair
Visionary eden turns to hell

Winter martyrium
Freezing me from inside
Pastlife delirium
As my tears turn to ice

Snow the white empress, frost the ice cold forest
At mountains of dead bodies I drank the sweetest wine
Spring awaits lust for the autumn dominatress
Life remains a dream within a dream visionary symbols
ancient shine

Summer's gotta come bringing back the sun
Zero to none, winter awaits us all
Mystic awareness

With God conversing wide awake in your sleep
Shining discovery mankind martyrium
Planets of terror, hatred and deceit
To live it means to suffer to die to live forever
I'm left here with the others we could not die together
And as I saw them dying I knew it had begun
Emotional massacre
A visionary kingdom come
