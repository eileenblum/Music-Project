[M+L: Petrozza Â· c Maldoror]

[Pure hardcore! It shows the punkrock influence of our early days when we were listening to Raw Power, Slime, GBH and The Exploited.]

Night is over
Now it's dawn
Your final day
Has begun
Hear the steps
On the floor
Hear the sounds
Of the opened door
Too proud to scream
Too proud to beg for mercy
You will die by the executioner's hand

Under the guillotine

Tears are running
Down your cheeks
As you see
The axe of death
You were a prisoner
Didn't care about rules
Now it's time
To pay for the fools

[Taken from the album "Pleasure To Kill" Â· 1986]
