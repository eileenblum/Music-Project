[M: Petrozza/Fioretti/Reil Â· L: Petrozza Â· c Maldoror]

[The title of this song means a lot to me. Total death - death in its perfect form, when even the soul has died.]

Time has come the peace can't stand
Masters of the switch now rule the land
Push the switch and send out death
Politicians warpigs shit in head

Try to run or hide
From your death
You will burn and bleed
From your head

Total death
No one escapes the burning flames
Flesh and skin decays from your face
Five megatons lie on every soul
Destroy the human race is their goal

[Taken from the album "Endless Pain" Â· 1985]
