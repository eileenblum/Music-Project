Extreme aggression
From an extremely insane mind
Resting unconscious
Pushed up by white lines
Inhuman violence
I never thought it would come this far
Sadistic intentions
My greed for blood is growing more
And more

Extreme aggression
Seeing you suffer bring pleasure to me
Extreme aggression
My aggression's became too extreme to be kept under control

Hallucinations
From the darkest part of my brain
I still can't believe it
I'm really insane
Here the screams of your torment
As I commit my heartless crime 
I heard you pleading
But no one hears the screams
Of this soul of mine

Extreme aggression
Seeing you suffer bring pleasure to me
Extreme aggression
My aggression's became too extreme to be kept under control

Society, what have you done to me?
Society, bring you to your knees

Once before I die
Now that I have lost the will to live
Once before I die
I want to take revenge on
Those who's led me to this...

...extreme aggression
My emotions, twisted by your lies
Extreme aggression
Condemned my soul to hell for all time
