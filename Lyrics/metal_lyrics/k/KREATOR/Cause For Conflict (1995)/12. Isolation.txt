Here in isolation
Seeing more than the eye can see
Safe in peaceful silence
So far out of reach

Closer to purest liberty
Isolation is what I seek
Manifest with the long lost truth
Where pain and agony is absolute

In this life of sadness
True serenity lies within
Dream of distant places
Where no soul has ever been

In my mind
No time, no space
So close
Misery I can escape
