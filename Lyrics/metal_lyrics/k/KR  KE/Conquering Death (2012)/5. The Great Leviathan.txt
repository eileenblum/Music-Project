In another time, another place
The serpents rode the sky in grace
Now the ghost-lands whisper a call I must heed,
Dark is the hour, dark is our need

We've read in blood, we've scryed in bone 
The coming of false light spelled out in stone
Now the dreamer must awaken and quake this land
To shatter the chains wrought by the pale hand

Ignorant feet now tread our ancient soil,
It beckons my raging blood to boil
I must cut the rot from all our hearts,
And banish their taint with my dark arts

Beyond haunted shores and the forests so deep,
Taloned and scaled by the one I seek
Into mountains of cold and clouds ripe with thunder
To stir the leviathan in eternal slumber

When mighty starlight scars the sky with brutal flames
And divinity comes for me
In another time, another place
The serpents rode the sky with grace
Now the ghost-lands whisper a call I must heed
Dark is the hour, dark is our need

Through fire and ice, through darkness and blight,
My journey ends with him
The Great Leviathan of the Northern Sky
