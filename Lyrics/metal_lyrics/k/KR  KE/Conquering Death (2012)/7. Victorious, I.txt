One life time has never been enough for me
I have set my hungry eyes on infinity
Against the frost broken free from frigid ground
And I swear I shall never again be bound

Forged from the crucible devoid of remorse
Hammered and honed, turned keen from coarse
Tempered in the flames brought forth by my ire
Fuelled by the loathing for those who'll steal my fire

Impervious, Unconquerable 
With deadly pride in each end denied
I am the embodiment of defiance!
Verging on immortality
To strive for and become
Rigid, steadfast, Victorious I!

Striding through each endless battlefield
This prize, my life, I will never yield
To challenge my existence, not coerced by fear
So formidable a foe will never, I know, appear

Every bearing set against the raging storms
To traverse the arduous path, shunning all the norms
Following this road I've paved with broken dreams
All enemies remain in ashes and dust it seems

One truth so hopeless to deny
They say; time finds us all
Yet as the sands run out
I shall not fall!

Come end, come bane and scourge,
All envoys to the grave
Far from reach of raven-claws,
Such savage scythes, for me they crave

Impervious, Unconquerable 
With deadly pride in each end denied
I am the embodiment of defiance!
Verging on immortality
To strive for and become
Rigid, steadfast, Victorious I!

"Chosen of war who makes a battle
with great iron and fire,
be with peace and follow me away
from this enterprise of futility
Set as the jewelled crown of most
and every man's desire,
through the conquest of life obtained
though at my gates all must stand with humility."

Come death, dusk and demise
All heralds of the tomb
Like a reed to the reapers will,
I bow to my doom
