Corruption (corruption)
A poisoned apple
That feeds your loss
Weaken (weaken)
Reality is the greatest curse

Welcome to this
Ensuring soft will
I tried so hard
Through the impossible
Clenching my fists
This fight will never end
Nation rise
Taking the world by storm

Overcome the pain
Overcome, overcome
Take away the fear
Break away, break away
Kill the voice inside
Kill the lie, kill the lie

Destruction (destruction)
Words of wisdom played upon
Repent (repent)
the day you reach the sun

Welcome to this
Ensuring soft will
I tried so hard
Through the impossible
Clenching my fists
This fight will never end
Nation rise
Taking the world by storm

Overcome the pain
Overcome, overcome
Take away the fear
Break away, break away
Kill the voice inside
Kill the light, kill the light

[Solo]

Walked through fields of war
Face the spineless one
I give my life, spirit aside
I will conquer this life
I will conquer this life
I will conquer this life
I will conquer this life
