Down to nothing
Weak, frail and broken
Wasting away before
My very eyes
I told you never to say
The things you kept within
The brothers in honour
This is forever

(I promise disloyalty to you)
We are soldiers of war
Lost in inside betrayal
(I sacrificed myself for you)
for the rise of kings and tyrants

There is no glory
There is no trusting hand
I will defend you to the very end
Even if my hands spill
Blood in heaven
(Heaven)

Your places to the skies
Wretched smell of death, demise
Lost an eye for the sinner's death
Desperate souls they never get back

[Solo]

Everything means nothing
When you lose the things that matter
Fading away, the dreams of tomorrow
Calling the words of survival
Calling the course of reprisal
Mothers and fathers
Sons or brothers

(I promise disloyalty to you)
We are soldiers of war
Lost in inside betrayal
(I sacrificed myself for you)
for the rise of kings and tyrants

There is no glory
There is no trusting hand
I will defend you
To the very end
Even if my hands
Spill blood in heaven
Blood in heaven
Blood in heaven
Spill my blood in heaven
