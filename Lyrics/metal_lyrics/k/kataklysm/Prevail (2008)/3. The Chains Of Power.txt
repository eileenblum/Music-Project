Years of fighting is combat of war
Bring the fire straight to the core
Intense the damage with only single blow
Kill or be killed or summon your lord
I can be what you want be to be...
A product of war or weapon of choice!
Vanquish an army of one million man
Walk through the land of the weak and the dead

Conquer this ideology
All this blood will set me free
There's no time to contemplate
Settle this hate to devastate
All this pain I'm hired to create
Push the boundaries of the sane
Infrastructures laid to waste
Take no prisoners and penetrate

Bring me to hell... I can scream much louder!
The voice of freedom... slay the chains of power!
