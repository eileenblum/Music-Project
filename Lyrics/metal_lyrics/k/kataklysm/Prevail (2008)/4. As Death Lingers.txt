A brand new day of steady darkness
Poisoned vows of deeper sadness
One can count the heroes lost, all gone... dead in the dust

Power... gods kiss and deadly embrace
Cowards... those who kill and bring the madness

Shame on the kings who wreak disorder
Freedom's death is getting closer
The smell of failure, we all fall in the hands of traitors
Can we decipher our enemies pillars?

As death lingers
Soulless we march on

As death lingers
It calls our name to the sun

As death lingers
Our fate burns at dawn

As death lingers
Heartless we carry on

I confess to my shrine
I don't care for the light
It betrayed me at sight
Can't you see what it does?
Manipulates for cause
I'll stand my ground for my trust

Sinister souls errupt
Bound deconstruct
All the aspects of what life costs
Turn this warm heart to frost
There's no signs of a time to stop... I'm lost

Crawling deeper into the pit
This abyss will swallow you quick
Stand strong, fierce to the wind
Fall down... face to the ground

Power... gods kiss and deadly embrace
Cowards... those who kill and bring the madness

As death lingers
Soulless we march on

As death lingers
It calls our name to the sun

As death lingers
Our fate burns at dawn

As death lingers
Heartless we carry on
