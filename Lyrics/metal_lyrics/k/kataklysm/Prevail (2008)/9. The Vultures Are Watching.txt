Friend or traitor?
Sometimes I wonder
If these tears should turn to laughter
If your malice was from the start
Maybe you love to rub these wounds with salt

Cross my path in the weakest time
You turned your back in a blink of an eye
Aim my heart for target
This is something I shall never forget

War of words and war of trust
Bring the changes left to stay
Never doubt the meaning of hate
Imploding minds deaf to blind
Reaping havoc causing static
All the fools become systematic
Bring the walls down to the generic
You read the mind of the manic

Since time heals
I've regain the spirit to live
Wiser and smarter and better then ever
I run through the steps I find
I live to die as strangers say
Filled with hopes of a better day
Flesh of the burning, souls searching
This is my journey

You pray on me... the vultures are watching
You stay with me... the vultures are watching
You feed from me... the vultures are watching
You steal from me... the vultures are watching

Confrontation is bloodshed
First mistake was to under estimate
One life... one time
Destined to make it right

Crisis to bend all I stand for
March towards things I would die for
This is who I am, this soul will never end
This will be my last stand... this should will never end...
My last stand... it will never end!

They're watching...
