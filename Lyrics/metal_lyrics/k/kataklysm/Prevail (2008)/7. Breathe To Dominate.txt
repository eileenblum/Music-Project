Respect my ways... this is my pride
Break my silence... fear my life
I know you want it... always earn your merit
You've reached the edge... broke down the pledge

Time after time I've challenged myself
My soul darkened with regret
Eclipsed by the things I dread
Witnessed by the skins I shed
No one wants war
No one wants war
But I'll take you there with one dead stare

No room to move... can't feel nothing
Sentenced to die... break free with me

Breath... breath to dominate
Fearless strike to un-create
Breathe... breath to dominate
Power feeds to annihilate

And I stand here in redemption
For all the things that bring salvation
Battered souls for resurrection

One step closer
To strike the deceiver
Sometimes I wonder
Nothing in this world can kill this hunger
I'll satisfy, intensify... this thirst that grows inside
Determined... determined my will to rise

Time after time I've challenged myself
My soul darkened with regret
Eclipsed by the things I dread
Witnessed by the skins I shed
No one wants war
No one wants war
But I'll take you there with one dead stare

Breath... breath to dominate
Fearless strike to un-create
Breathe... breath to dominate
Power feeds to annihilate

And I stand here in redemption
For all the things that bring salvation
Battered souls for resurrection

One step closer
To strike the deceiver
Sometimes i wonder
Nothing in this world can kill this hunger
In satisfy, intensify... this thirst that grows inside
Determind... determined my will to rise

Time after time I've challenged myself
My soul darkened with regret
Eclipsed by the things I dread
Witnessed by the skins I shed
No one wants war
No one wants war
But I'll take you there with one dead stare

Breath... breath to dominate
Fearless strike to un-create
Breathe... breath to dominate
Power feeds to annihilate
