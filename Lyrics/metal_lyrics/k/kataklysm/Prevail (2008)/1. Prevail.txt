"What the hell
Everybody ends up dead
It's just a matter of when"

Prevail!

[Pre-chorus:]
Trapped in a web of lies
I never seen the truth
When it stared me in the eyes
Damn... the ones who betray
Every single chance
That I give everyday
Break all the chains that bind
All these pains are lost in the cries
Faith in the day that will come
The chance to overcome

[Chorus:]
Never seen the face of defeat
Never felt the cries of the weak
Never once thought of surrender
This heart is somber
I will rise 'til the end
Sever the souls that bled
I will take this courage
And turn it into rage
Prevail
The time has come
Crush the enemy one by one
Prevail
Like a venomous snake
Ready to strike and dominate
Prevail
We conquer as one
Pound the enemy 'til it's done
Prevail!

What doesn't kill you
Makes you stronger and bitter
What hasn't made you
Can die quicker and faster
I'll turn the tables around
And wait to break you down

Embraced by warmth and fear
This day will shine in tears

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
