So slow...

To take greed... from every selfish heart that bleeds
With me... to fight an endless uphill battle
Set free... The souls who need the chance to rise
Death's seed... to embody the earth's core

The transition is so slow, to see the world burn
To see the fire turn, I can't watch this story unfold
Existence to spiral in nothing

I stood at the height of the world and watched you all kill for nothing
Such fear this world as known yet we spawn mutilations
So I say... So I say...

All the traitors in the world... LET THEM BURN!
They want it all? LET THEM BURN!
Fuck them all, kill them all... LET THEM BURN...

To take greed... from every selfish heart that bleeds
With me... to fight an endless uphill battle
Set free... The souls who need the chance to rise
Death's seed... to embody the earth's core

This is my war, this is my savior
I'll take you down even if it takes my last breath
I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN!!

All the traitors in the world... LET THEM BURN!
They want it all? LET THEM BURN!
Fuck them all, kill them all... LET THEM BURN...
