Born into life with a feeling of hate
I tried to change but it turned into fate
Fatal blow to society's face
Torment I will create!

Cast away in the veins of redemption
Lethal dose of murder by injection
Disarray in extermination, this is what I die for...

This is my life, these are my drams
This is my TEMPTATION

All of these sins I won't regret
This is my TEMPTATION

Addicting emotions... never let down
This is my TEMPTATION

I'll rip your soul down to the core
This is my TEMPTATION

I never thought that the day would come
I never thought I'd be here to see you fall into your grave
And watch you beg for mercy to be saved

Born into life with a feeling of hate
I tried to change but it turned into fate
Fatal blow to society's face
Torment I will create!

Tie a rope around my neck

Cast away in the veins of redemption
Lethal dose of murder by injection
Disarray in extermination, this is what I die for...

Temptation's Nest

Venomous into temptation's nest
We all die in temptation's nest
