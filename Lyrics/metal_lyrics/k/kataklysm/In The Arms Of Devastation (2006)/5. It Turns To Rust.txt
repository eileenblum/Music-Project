Fear... with a touch of sin
Death... to resurrect
Pain... to inflict the world
Just let it grow...

To let your blood flow
To feed your dying soul
I'll bring you to this war...
I'll bring you to your door

All compassion fails
Your heart is just as stale
Everything you touch turns to rust

It Turns To Rust

Hate... in the darkest place
Faith... it dies with me
Wrath... to save your soul
Just let it grow...

To let your blood flow
To feed your dying soul
I'll bring you to this war...
I'll bring you to your door

All compassion fails
Your heart is just as stale
Everything you touch turns to rust

It Turns To Rust

I don't care... about your pain and your grief,
It's all about your greed
For every single thing,
For every single moment... You took from me
