These walls are closing in, they're bound to suffocate me
Compelled to live my life in ways I could never imagine

Can you save these dying eyes? Sentenced to never be free
I stand convicted of all your fucking lies

Darkness fills my life, all the things that could never see the light
The damage is irreversible... outrageous...
Like Angels Weeping The Dark

YouÂ´ll never know what you did to me
Until I take my last breath...
IÂ´ll take you to hell with me!

You want your chaos? - IÂ´ll give you war
Locked inside myself. IÂ´ll always blame it on you

Darkness fills my life... all the things that could never see the light
The Damage is irriversible... outrageous..
Like Angels Weeping The Dark
