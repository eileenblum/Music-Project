It wasn't so long ago I remember time's where life was so cold
Everything was dark and still I thought I had a chance in life
The demons called my name, they dragged me inside the chambers of hell
No one could hear me, I bled tears of pain

Son, confront me... The Road To Devastation
Kneel before me... The Road To Devastation
Inhale, exhale... The Road To Devastation
This is my life... The Road To Devastation

The sun would rise, the hope would die inside
Another day of misery as the clock turns to agony
Feel the sense of lost time...
When everything falls to pieces and left with a glimpse of light

It wasn't so long ago I remember time's where life was so cold
Everything was dark and still I thought I had a chance in life
The demons called my name, they dragged me inside the chambers of hell
No one could hear me, I bled tears of pain

Son, confront me... The Road To Devastation
Kneel before me... The Road To Devastation
Inhale, exhale... The Road To Devastation
This is my life... The Road To Devastation
