We're conquered all but still we're searching for blood
To thirst the quench a thousand years old
I want to hear the screams of nation's colliding
Soaked in sorrow the fate of tomorrow

You better run... run far away
From everything you ever wanted to be
Your destiny is mine...
To defy this is suicide... it's suicide!

To Reign Again

None shall defy
The vengeance I unfold
Surrender to this end
Death is yours to keep

Fear opposition... doomed forever... rage in anger
Feel the pressure ripping you apart

We're conquered all but still we're searching for blood
To thirst the quench a thousand years old
I want to hear the screams of nation's colliding
Soaked in sorrow the fate of tomorrow

You better run... run far away
From everything you ever wanted to be
Your destiny is mine...
To defy this is suicide... it's suicide!

To Reign Again

None shall defy
The vengeance I unfold
Surrender to this end
Death is yours to keep
