Testify to heal the wounds inside
Walk the path of endless lies
In denial of a wretched past

Walk the walk of a guilty man
Scarred from years of deadly abuse
I'm pulling through with everything I can't undo

The stress is killing me inside
This chaos... so divine
To please everyone.... everyone but myself
The pain is deafening, crushing all that is challenged
I really wonder if one day I'll surrender

Open Scars... these wounds will never heal
Open Scars... this heart you'll never steal

Shutdown...

Justify this rage that's roaming over
Empty all your world, empty out your soul
To sacrifice it all for the sake of others
And no one gives a fuck that my life is over

The stress is killing me inside
This chaos... so divine
To please everyone.... everyone but myself
The pain is deafening, crushing all that is challenged
I really wonder if one day I'll surrender

Open Scars... these wounds will never heal
Open Scars... this heart you'll never steal
