I hear a million voices,
There screaming through my head
Messages of death that I could understand
They reek intimidation, they reek retribution
The time has come for you to defy your enemy

I saw you coming from miles away
One by one I saw you fade away
There's no chance in one man's fear
The damage's done your strength's undone

Crippled &amp; Broken

There's no one left to die...

Crippled &amp; Broken

Worthless to test this power
And feel the wrath of fire
Senseless these acts of vengeance,
Will tear into your soul
Rage of inner strength, to eat you from the inside
And cripple you, into infinity
You reap what you sowed for war,
You reap what you sowed for nothing,
You reap what you sowed!

I hear a million voices,
There screaming through my head
Messages of death that I could understand
They reek intimidation, they reek retribution
The time has come for you to defy your enemy

I saw you coming from miles away
One by one I saw you fade away
There's no chance in one man's fear
The damage's done your strength's undone

Crippled &amp; Broken

There's no one left to die..

Crippled &amp; Broken
