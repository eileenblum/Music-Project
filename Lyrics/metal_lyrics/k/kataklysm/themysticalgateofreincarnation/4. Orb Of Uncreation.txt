The Orb Of Uncreation!...
For light years, the sphere of beauty travels the lives,
in it's void drained behind for unknown spaces the sphere.
I'm coming to fulfill your needs, I'm here to satisfy your feelings.
EARTHLINGS
And here to take what is rightfully mine.
YOUR SOUL
For your war that soils the earth.
YOU'LL PERISH
Where does it come from?, maybe from the calling...
of the living?... The orb...
From deep beauty, the sphere strives in vain, lightens it's vast creation...
From splendid energy, the sphere walks in grace, glows it's new destination.
TO UNCREATE!
