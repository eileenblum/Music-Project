Blood for blood,revenge has come
Through the face of hate,I see the face of faith
I will bring you to your knees

Can you see these eyes glow? They feed on all your sorrow
I'm the man you tried to kill,but I can't disappear

You betrayed me, you double crossed me
You broke the trust I gave and now your fear is my slave

Blood for blood, revenge has come
Through the face of hate, I see the face of faith
I will bring you to your knees

Can you see these eyes glow? They feed on all your sorrow
I'm the man you tried to kill, but I can't disappear

I am resurrected, inside your deepest fear
Inside your darkest hour, inside your bleeding heart

Bleed for me...

No mercy...no mercy...
I'm evwerything you can't imagine and more

Can you see these eyes glow? They feed on all your sorrow
I'm the man you tried to kill, but I can't disappear

I am resurrected, inside your deepest fear
Inside your darkest hour, inside your bleeding heart
