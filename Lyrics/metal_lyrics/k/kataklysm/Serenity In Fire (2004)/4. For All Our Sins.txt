Killer blow to the sphere of light
Even I can't dry these tears in my eyes
They say I sin for all mankind
When I act upon...What I feel inside

Forgiveness. For all weak minds
Forgiveness. For the blind who want to see
Forgiveness. For those who weep
Forgiveness. Is endless for the meaningless

We stare at the dark as it breathes before us
The walls are closing. I feel. Nothing at all

For all our sins, we live our lives
For all our sins, we stand to die. To die!

One step closer to redemptions hive
I can hear all the angels cry
For me there is no truthful lie
There will be no remorse. My spirit is alive

Forgiveness. For all weak minds
Forgiveness. For the blind who want to see
Forgiveness. For those who weep
Forgiveness. Is endless for the meaningless

We stare at the dark as it breaths before us
The walls are closing. I feel. Nothing at all

For all our sins, we live our lives
For all our sins, we stand to die. To die!

You suffocate me, you liberate me
What am I...to all this greed?
I'm everything you need. Everything you need!

Please forgive me, before I forgive myself...
