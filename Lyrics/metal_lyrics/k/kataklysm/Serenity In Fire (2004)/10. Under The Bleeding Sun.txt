Contemplate the great one
Question your existence
Bring me the resistance
Forever is the distance

Be the one to change, knowledge is the way
To find your pray, the pray to your strength

Faith is burning, the road to your sanity
The choice is relentless, the outcome venomous
We are the bastard sons...unwanted from god
Abandoned under the bleedind sun

The sins, the hate, the pain
The love, the trust, left to rust

Faith is burning, the road to your sanity
The choice is relentless, the outcome venomous
We are the bastard sons. Unwanted from god
Abandoned under the bleeding sun

Contemplate the great one
Question your existence
Bring me the resistance
Forever is the distance

Be the one to change, knowledge is the way
To find your pray, the pray to your strength

Turn around...your disgrace...
Face the frontliness
Your faith belongs to victims...
There is no test of faith
Your fear as your death
