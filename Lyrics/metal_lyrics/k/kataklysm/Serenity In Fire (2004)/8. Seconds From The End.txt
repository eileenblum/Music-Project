Cataclysmic detonation
Inside the mind and the world of devastation
We bring fire and power to revolution
The earth shakes and trembles into isolation

10 seconds from the end...one chance...to make it right
10 seconds from the end...one life...to take it back

If you had one moment left before the end. To repent
And think of all your life...
Question things you've learned
From all these distant memories

They say you learn till the end of time
So your mind is strong and wise
Ironically my friend. It's always time to die

Cataclysmic detomation
Inside the mind and the world of devastation
We bring fire and power to revolution
The earth shakes and trembles into isolation

10 seconds from the end...one chance...to make it right
10 seconds from the end...one life...to take it back
