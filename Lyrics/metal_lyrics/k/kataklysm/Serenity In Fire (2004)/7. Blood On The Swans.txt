Chaos breeds the sky, inhabits all our lives
War mongers deny, but order the first strike

Until the last man dies, corrupt the system blind
This is blood on the swans. Hell spawn
This is blood on the swans. Fallen

Domination...corruption...
Desperation feeds the nations
Desperations cleanses nations

Until the last man dies, corrupt the system blind
This is blood on the swans. Hell spawn
This is blood on the swans. Fallen

Where are thy leaders?
Where is thy saviour?

Blood...on...the...swans!
