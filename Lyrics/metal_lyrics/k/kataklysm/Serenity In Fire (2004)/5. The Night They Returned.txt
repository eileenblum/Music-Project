I've got the urge to kill, to see the blood flow
My lust for you grows, to carve up that inner glow

Seduce me with your death, my love for you is red

Random Killings, Individual Torture.
Blood feast. Carnage Done

They are...the flesh eaters.
Let the fire burn...The night they return!

As I lay you to rest your remains are mine to test
I feast on your soul like never before

Seduce me with your death, my love for you is red

Random Killings. Individual Torture.
Blood feast. Carnage Done

They are...the flesh eaters.
Let the fire burn...The night they return!

Oh...dry your tears...come to me now...
Let me feel your pain
