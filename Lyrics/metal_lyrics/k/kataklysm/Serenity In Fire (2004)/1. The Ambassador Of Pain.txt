Test me...I'm the ambassador of pain,I rule all those who oppose
Test me...I'm the ambassador of pain,I crush all those who oppose

Annihilate yourself from all that is real
Push the limit of self indulgence

No one cores...who you are...step aside...I'll take your life!!

Test me...I'm the ambassador of pain, I rule all those who oppose
Test me...I'm the ambassador of pain, I crush all those who oppose

Liberate yourself from all that is real
Push the limit of self indulgence

This is the level you could never reach
Now face me for what you can't be

No one cares...who you are...step aside..I'll take your life!!

Test me...I'm the ambassador of pain, I rule all those who oppose
Test me...I'm the ambassador of pain, I crush all those who oppose
