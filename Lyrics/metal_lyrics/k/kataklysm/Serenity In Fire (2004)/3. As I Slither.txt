I can't belive it came to this, I live my life with no regrets
Stripped down, from all my dignity, you took it all from me
I rise. Every single time you lie
To me...I'll play that game of hate

As I slither. I slither down your spine. Slither!
I slither down your spine. Slither!
I slither down your spine. Slither!
I'll take all away...I'll take your life away
I'll take it all away

I can't believe it come to this, I live my life with no regrets
Stripped down, from all my dignity, you took it all from me

I rise. Every single time you lie
To me...I play that game of hate

As I slither. I slither down your spine. Slither!
I slither down your spine. Slither!
I slither down your spine. Slither!
I'll take all away...I'll take your mind away...

Don't try to comprehend me
Don't try to criticize me
Watch me as I slither. As I slither.
Around your neck
