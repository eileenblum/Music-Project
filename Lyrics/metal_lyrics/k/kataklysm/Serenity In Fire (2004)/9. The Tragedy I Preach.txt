The tragedy I preach
Is every thing you see and everything you breath.

Make way...for all the dreams that can be held
Make way...for all minds that can be fed
There's a cost for serenity, there's a cost to live freely
This stress is endless bring down the careless!!

It's coming down...it's coming down

It's a tragedy when we fail to see
It's a tragedy all the things we feel
It's a tragedy when we fail to see
It's a tragedy everything that's real

Master the mind. Master the earth's swine
Forever invoke what makes you right and dissolve
What makes you blind

Step back from the enemy within
Step back from that endless grin
There's a cost for serenity, there's a cost to live freely
This stress is endless bring down the careless!!

It's coming down...It's coming down

It's a tragedy when we fail to see
It's a tragedy all the things we feel
It's a tragedy when we fail to see
It's a tragedy everything that's real

Master the mind. Master the earth's swine
Forever invoke what makes you right and dissolve
What makes you blind
