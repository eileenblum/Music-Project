Through the gates of hell
And into the legions of darkness
They come to breed
They come to kill

1999:6661
Towards the millenium
The end is coming

They land they land
Freedom denied!

1999:6661
Towards the millenium
The end is coming

The sky is falling
Cities burning
No one will breath again
There's nothing left to see
But the falling rain

The resistance is failing
Eyes are bleeding
No one can kill this pain

I can see the fear in your eyes
Parasites of a dying world

There's no coming back
No one will take the blame

1999:6661
Towards the millenium
The end is coming

They land
They land
Freedom denied!
