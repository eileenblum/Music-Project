Winds rip through glass
Fragments in my eyes
The world torn apart
Swallows me in
The sea rages on
Mankind drowning
I see the burning souls
Lost into the sky

Sentenced, there's no escape
I bleed for your sins
The cries of the children denied
Engulfs the echoes of hope
Enter thy domain and listen
To the sirens of hate

Pain sucks me in
There's nowhere to run
Plagued by innocence
Guilty as sin
Buried underground
Darkness enthroned
Vision devastation
Witness the STORMLAND!
