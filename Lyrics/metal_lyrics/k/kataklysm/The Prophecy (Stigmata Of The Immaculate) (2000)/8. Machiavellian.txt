There are many ways to victory
But only one to conquer
To be king or to be slave
For revenge or for submission

Show him your strong when you're really weak
Show him your weak when you're really strong
Always know what your enemy is thinking
For every attempt he will be vanquished

The only way to rule is to be machiavellian!

To be loved or to be feared
To be trust or not to trust
Love disappears but fear remains
Trust is fuel for the enemy
