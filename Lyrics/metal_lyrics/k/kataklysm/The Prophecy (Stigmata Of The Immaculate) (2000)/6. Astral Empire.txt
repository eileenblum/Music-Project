Raging through oblivion
Were darkness is forever
Leading towards earth
Apocalypse inside
Infernal imagery
To seek beyond reason
Eternal fire ready to arrive

No god shall save this earth
To believe the non-existent

Third from the sun

Sleep amongst the ruins of this sphere
Were no man is safe
In your eyes
Masters of sin
Delivers of pain
Hear the screams from the holy lands

No god shall save this earth
To believe the non-existent

I save my soul
From the lies of this world
Never again!
I rather die!
