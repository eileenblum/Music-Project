Hold on to your dear life
And everything you ever were
And pray to god
For him to save your soul
While I praise for pain
Enough to drive you insane

You find it hard to understand
Why perfection is not existent
Who died and made you god
To believe your of some worth to
This world

Only pain is everlasting
Only sin is everlasting

Collide with everything your supposed to be
Your a slave to everything you want to be
Eternal path to never be free
Endless time from heaven to hell

BREEDING THE EVERLASTING!
