The human race revolts
Fighting a losing war
Invaded by spectral beings
Annihilation
In a sea of blood

Desert like vision
Chaotic ruins embalmed
Behold the manifest
Cataclysmic devastation

No room to manoeuvre
Symbolic ways to extinction
Inhabit the coalition of darkness
No choice but to surrender

Feel the wrath of supreme power
Where is the godlike image
That we portrayed for centuries
Put under pressure to be dissolved

Sacrifice everything
We ever built
For everything we ever destroyed

Desert like vision
Chaotic ruins embalmed
Behold the manifest
Cataclysmic devastation
