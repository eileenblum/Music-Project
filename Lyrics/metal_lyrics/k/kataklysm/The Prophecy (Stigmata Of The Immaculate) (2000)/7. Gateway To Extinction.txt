You've never seen
A war like this before
Entering a phase
You've never explore
They can taste the blood
Flowing through your veins
Embracing the insane

Vanishing among the dead
The Gateway to extinction

You'll never see what they see
Paradise is only a dream for the week
Maybe you'll see what they see
When you die for your dreams
Lost in a trance
In the neverworld
You've created for your own
And no one else will forgive
This never-ending plague

Fade away
