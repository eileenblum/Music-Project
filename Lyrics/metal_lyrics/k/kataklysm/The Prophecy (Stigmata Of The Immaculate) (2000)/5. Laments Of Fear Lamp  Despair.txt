Question everything you know about life
Question nature's intent for reprisal
Question it's plea for survival
Here the screams coming from the core of the earth

Laments of fear &amp; despair
Dead world for a burning sun

No chance to restore equilibrium
Eliminate the masses of flesh

Sickness is mankind
The infection we deny
Corrosion to the vital
Result is suicidal

Question everything you know about life
Question nature's intent for reprisal
Question it's plea for survival
Here the screams coming from the core of the earth

Laments of fear &amp; despair
Dead world for a burning sun
