As the sky darkens, the warriors awaken
The feeble have fallen, opposition is weaken

Strategic in play, trapped in vein
Annihilated
In dust...damnation is now!

Damnation is here......
Are you ready to burn?
Damnation is here!

Wounded souls in a tragic time
Victims of oppression from a conquering tribe
To find a new identity, in assimilation or extinction?
Buried beneath a sea of rage their history is lost in shame
Prisoners of power...left to be devoured!

Damnation is here....
Are you ready to burn?
Damnation is here....

Buried beneath a sea of rage, their history is lost in shame
Prisoners of power...left to be devoured!
