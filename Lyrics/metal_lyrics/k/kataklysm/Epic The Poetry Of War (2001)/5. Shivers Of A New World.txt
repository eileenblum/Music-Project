I hear the distant cry of human evolution
Driven to vanquish to no disillusion
I am the one you despise
The one who brings great change

The equivalent of fear...
Of all that is strange
To a simple mind in a complicated time

You see...I don't fear the things you fear
As life is a lost battle that you hold dear
All that is old turns to rust
The same way your flesh will turn to dust

Can you feel the shivers going down your spine?

Til the next seed of life
That will bring resurrection
The same way your ancestors
Kept the fire burning

I will bring revolution
The sun will rise again
And I will make you feel
The shivers of a new world

Shivers..."feel the change"...
Of..."its all thesame"...
A..."mindgame"...
New World!!!

The quest for eternity continues...
The quest for eternity is here...
