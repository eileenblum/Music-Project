(I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick)

I'm sick and tired of feeling nostalgic
For things I've done in the past
I want to breathe the future
Without engulfing the past

Behold my resurrection!
Behold the rage of aggression!
Day after day, the anger rises!
Beyond comprehension, sanity is dead!!!

Pushed over the edge
Feel the pain I bear (I bear)
Cross thy path if you dare

All you see is this dead stare

Deep down the roots of my persona,
I feel the wrath
Destiny has brought us face to face - At last
This is the final stand
The final stand (at last)

Everytime I rise, somebody has died
Can't convert this rage inside
I've killed in order to survive
Now I kill, because I'm deprived
I really want to change, I feel shame

But there's something inside driving me insane!!!! (Insane/insane/insane)

Non posso cambiare Il destino
Quanto il diavolo in me?

(I cannot change my destiny....
How much is the devil in me?!)
