Have you ever felt
Like the walls are closing in?
Like your world is about to end?

Trapped in a place where you can't escape
Feeling desperate to breath again
To cast away that moment of insanity
And feel no more pain in solitude and despair

I close my eyes and hope to die
Trying to find and understand
The things I left behind

Bring me something to feel!
I said...
Bring me somthing to feel!
Hear me!...

Have you ever felt
Like the walls are closing in?
Like your world is about to end?

Trapped in a place where you can't escape
Feeling desperate to breath again
To cast away that moment of insanity
And feel no more pain in solitude and despair

I close my eyes and hope to die....
Trying to find and understand
The things I left behind

I was denied
Everytime I tried to capture
The reasons to my life

When time stands still, you'll look into my eyes
Wondering why this world has died

"I cannot die...I am forever..."
