If you exist...
Why don't you heal my wounds?
If you're God...
Release me from this tomb!

Why don't you heal my wounds?
Release me from this tomb!

Don't you care?!
Why...Don't you care?!

About all whom have died
In the name of the father
And the son
And the holy spirit

Tell me why you betray
The ones you're supposed to love
I've seen innocent men fall
I've seen darkenened souls live forever
Praying changed nothing so I fall chameless
To the wound called existence
I fear nothing but myself...

...Don't you care?!
Why..Don't you care?!

About all whom have died...
In the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit

Tell me why you betray....
The ones you're supposed to love

If you exist...
Why don't you heal my wounds?
If you're God...
Release me from this tomb!

Why don't you heal my wounds?
Release me from this tomb!

I've seen innocent man fall
I've seen darkend souls live forever
Praying changed nothing, so I fall shameless....
...To the wound called existence
I fear nothing but myself...
