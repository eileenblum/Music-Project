Listen as I dictate the future
This republic most come to an end!
Proclaim the emperor
To lead the people
And give this land the fruits of the world
Together we shall stand
At the height of majesty

Strength and honor for the glory of Rome
One day we will roam
There's no forgiveness
In the era of the mercyless

I've seen it in the eyes of the gods
I've seen the birth of a new world
Preach the truth - Preach the logic

Strength and honor for the glory of Rome
One day we will roam
There's no forgiveness
In the era of the mercyless

"I ,Julius Caesar, will free Rome
From its corruption,
And only then will our children prosper"

Set forth legions of Rome
To conquer this world in vein with blade

Strength and honor for the glory of Rome
One day we will roam
There's no forgiveness
In the era of the mercyless

"Roma Victor!"
