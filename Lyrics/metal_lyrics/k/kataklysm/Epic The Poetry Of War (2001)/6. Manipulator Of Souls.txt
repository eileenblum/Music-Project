I manipulate your soul!
Deep inside the core!
Raping your existence!
In darkness!!

I will control desire
I will control your thoughts
I will be your guiding light
In the dark ways of fear and pain

I will embody your mind
Witness the fire rise
Obey my command
As you lay still in the womb of hate

Fear is the mind as the mind is the fear
Control the soul that controls your soul
Or forever be a slave!

I will control desire
I will control your thoughts
I will be your guiding light
In the dark ways of fear and pain

I will embody your mind
Witness the fire rise
Obey my command
As you lay still in the womb of hate

Fear is the mind as the mind is the fear
Control the soul that controls your soul

"We will tear your soul apart!"

I manipulate your soul!
Deep inside the core!
Raping your existence!
In darkness!!!
