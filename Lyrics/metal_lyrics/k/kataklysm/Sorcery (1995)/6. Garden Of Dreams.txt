[Chapter I - Supernatural Appearance]

Awaken! From my rest...
Something is... Grabbing my senses.
Something is... Pulling my roots.
... Half conscious, ... Levitating from my bed?
I stood up! In sweat.
As my pores... Were burning! By...
It is...

Awaken from my rest!
Something! ... Grabs me?
Still confused...
Something ... Levitates from me?
Awake in sweat!
My pores redeem heat...
It is...

Him!
I reach my dim door!
Opening it, reveals...
Vapors of blood in the air that succumbs...
Into the scent of nothingness...

Glancing beyond...
My body is being hurled through the air!
Spinning invertedly...
The head fragments in shards...
Carved in his flesh! Alive on My chest!
Burns the sigil of Baphomet...

The specter marches the chamber...
Throught my steps? I stumble within the residue...
Facing skywards! Drips my inhuman degeneration...
Excrements blasted apart surround my images...
Fumes putrifoed form the opaque glass...
Regardless... Sonic vibrations...
Mirror! Mirror! Face to face!
I only see, the Shadow...
... Reflecting off the glass!

That mirror shatters my soul... Black blood hole...
... Propels infinite falseness.
Explodes, releases ultra-sonorise resonance, Receive...
... Pallesthesicly.
I'm unwilling to kill me.
That dark effigy deep in the well. Of disgust...
Unnature, undead.
Maleficent Destroyer!

Revelation...
Peers Reflection,
Abomination...
Reflects possession,
Manifestation...
Possesses Creation,
Penetration...
Creates Domination.

Clairvoyance...
I'm dark... I'm pure silence...
A dream... Or the shadowgate truth...
Open to the smell?

Abomination...
Demon... Abomination!
