[Chapter III - An infinite transmigration]

...After life is born?
The battle! It is over.
... Hatred still flows...
As corrupted demons sing...
The spout of death to the Dead...

... A world broke apart,
As the self chosen creatures cry...
To the old lands below!
Before life is reborn!
To enhance the path once again... Again...

... New life apeared upstream,
Above underworld...
For the innocent Ones...
Its nature and the breathing Ones...
To pursue with their lives...

... Life? It is restored... Upon the new World,
As the ancient seekers of Power...
They want to abolish life once more.
... Dreaming! Of controlling... Again... Again!
The new field... Of colourful greenish... Life!
Us... Human World! Earth...
Human? World! Earth... Human? World! Earth...
Human? World! Earth... Human? World! Earth...
Human? World! Earth... Human? World! Earth...
Human? World! Earth... Human? World! Earth...
