As the world burns
We stand in line
In a shade of everlasting pain...
What this life for ?
Tell me why we live to die !?
Enlighten my soul !
All I found was a locked door...
Contradictions for eternity
Opposite ways to serenity
No one knows, the truth
For infinity
Awaiting the falls of
This society
Answer me this infinite Question...
A question with an infinite answer
What are we here for?
