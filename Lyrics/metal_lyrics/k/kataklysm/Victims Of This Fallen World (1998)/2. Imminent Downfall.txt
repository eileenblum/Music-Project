Imminent downfall!
Lost through these nostalgic
Eyes I bury the seed of life
And the pain I see,
We've modified the way of
Though, and understanding
Nothing can't change
What we've done
Different world's collide
They collide!!
Who will die
Who will cry
Who will lie
Imminent downfall
Who will lie
Who will cry
Who will die
Imminent downfall
Betrayed by the system we created
Survival of the fittest
Among the sickest!
No mercy for the weak
No chance for repent
They live and let the Innocent die...
