Portraits of anger
Lost in deceit
There's no forgiving
For the weak minds
Time running short
Criminal minds
Facing man to die
Unloved child with brokenn dreams
Why can't we see...
Portraits of anger
Feelings denied
Portraits of anger
Destined to die
There is no boundaries
There is no law
We are the victims
Of this Fallen World
