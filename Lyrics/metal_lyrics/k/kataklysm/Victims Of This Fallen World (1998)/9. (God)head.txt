I uphold my task
To create and uncreate
" Slaves are the ones who fallow
The myth of an unproven God "
Are the words of the atheist
For we are the children
Of the damn
Non-sense !
Set forth to an undiscovered
Era of spiritual fire
Rupture of an untamed system
The poor &amp; the feeble denied
Are the ones who died
And never return
trust is what we give
And never regain!
Lies after lies
(God)Head!
An everlasting myth
An everlasting paradox
An everlasting symbol
An everlasting treason
Gather as one
For the final
Abolishement
Pain
Greed
Demon seed
I survive
Abobinate
Desagnate
Stagnate
I'll take your soul
WE keep on coming
And we don't stop
Bring the retribution
Become undone
I'll take your soul
