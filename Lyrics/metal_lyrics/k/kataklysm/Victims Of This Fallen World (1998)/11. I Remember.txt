From the light that blind my eyes
The fire burns inside
From the memories of
Looking into your eyes
I felt your pain
The sadness of your soul
A life of broken dreams
A heart of gold
I can'y believe...
I remember
Like it was yesterday
I remember
I saw you sleeping away
I remember
Like it was yesterday
Your blood flows through mine 
i'm a part of you
That will never die
The tears in your face
The tears in mine
It will never be the same
But the memories remain...
