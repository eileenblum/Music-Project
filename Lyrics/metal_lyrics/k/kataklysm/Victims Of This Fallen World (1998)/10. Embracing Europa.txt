The signs of Armageddon
among us
The discovery of new world
Is among us 
Europa a moon of Jupiter
In the midst of ice age
And early stages of life
Towards Europa
The revolution has begun
Into submission
We burn into the sun
Towards Europa
There is nowhere to run
Into evolution
The revolution has begun
We've searched
The promise land
We have broken through
The gates of eternity
And created our own demise
Resist
Oblige
Not knowing is a crime
Unknown mysterious.
Eternal sleep with open eyes...
No one can save us!!
