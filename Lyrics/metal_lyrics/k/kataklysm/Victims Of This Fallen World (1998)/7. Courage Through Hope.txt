Blood falls from the sky
It thickens with time
All the pain in the world
Can't stop me
Surviving every difficult
Moment in life
I've challenged to overcome
This difficult path
The dreams of a better tomorrow
Without strength
There is nothing but sorrow
Who will save you?
If you can't save yourself
Who will control the uncontrolled
Torn apart
Disconnected
Senseless shutdown
Hold on to what you believe
All you've got is a dream
Courage through hope
