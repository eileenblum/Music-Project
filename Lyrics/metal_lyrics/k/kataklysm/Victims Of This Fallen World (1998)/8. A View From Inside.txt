Life will never be the same,
As I enter it's final phase
Who will take away
This eternal pain
The memories of a suffering past...
I hide behind a shadow of depression
No one knows how i feel...
No one will ever know
Look into my eyes
Emotionless
I lie
Negative vibes
Anger arise
Pain inside
Blade in hand
Distorted signals
Suicide mind
Hope declines
Innocent dies
I'am failure
