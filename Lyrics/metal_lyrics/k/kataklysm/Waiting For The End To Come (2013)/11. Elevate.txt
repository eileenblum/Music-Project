Shades of black engulf the skies
Death calls all the dead to rise
See the pestilence walk the earth
Hear the screams, covered in darkness
Look down at the world below, entrenched is a sea of sorrow

Come forth, unholy one
As death comes to us all

Elevate

I wonât let you take me away, I wonât let you drag me down, are you here for me?
Because Iâm already dead

Iâm the lion
Iâm the fire
Iâm the strength that binds us all
Iâm the hope that fears us all

Is this everything you wanted?
Misery from a cold embrace
Shattered dreams of a past erased
Senseless rage of the failures obtained
Breaking point of all the blood you drained
My pain, your savior
As death comes to us all

Elevate

I wonât let you take me away
I wonât let you drag me down, are you here for me?
Because Iâm already dead

Elevate me
