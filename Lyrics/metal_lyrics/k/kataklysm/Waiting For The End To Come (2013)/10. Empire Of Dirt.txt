Dissecting the shrine, ensuring your rise
Oppressing the masses, unleashing the chaos
Hold it down, vengeance is swift for the dying
They infiltrate the laws, to rage a war of control

Kneel, arrogance, itâs your time to die
In your empire of dirt, behead the king of nothing

Crawl through everything
The symbols of your faith
Betray your very existence
As the innocent bathe in blood, in blood

Itâs your time to die
In your empire of dirt, behead the king of nothing

Kneel, arrogance, itâs your time to die
In your empire of dirt, behead the king of nothing
