[Digipak Bonus Track][originally by Sacred Reich]Truth and honor, faith and pride
All convictions surely died
Honesty's time has passed
Time for lies is here at last

Truth is false, I'm so fed up
How did we come to be so fucked
Hate, fear, pain, death
All our country has got left

Talk to children hear them say
Daddy left again today
Brother steals and mommy lies
Future lost before their eyes

The sun was lost behind the clouds
They rapped it up and blacked it out
Acid rain fell today
It came and washed our hopes away

This was once the land of dreams
Now these dreams have turned to greed
In the midst of all this wealth
The poor are left to help themselves

A capitalist's democracy
Why no one said that freedom's free
Lady liberty rots away
No truth, no justice, the American way

Don't look past your TV
All of us are what you see
A looking glass into our lives
What we watch is what we buy

Priorities are out of whack
Who is next to stab our back
Doesn't it make you mad
To have lost all that we've had

This was once the land of dreams
Now these dreams have turned to greed
In the midst of all this wealth
The poor are left to help themselves

A capitalist's democracy
Why no one said that freedom's free
Lady liberty rots away
No truth, no justice, the American way

Doesn't it fill you with disgust
That there's no one left to trust
Is this happening, is this real
My body numb, I cannot feel

Are you happy? Are you sad?
Are emotions a thing of the past
I have no tears, I cannot cry
No one mourns for a world that's died

This was once the land of dreams
Now these dreams have turned to greed
In the midst of all this wealth
The poor are left to help themselves

A capitalist's democracy
Why no one said that freedom's free
Lady liberty rots away
No truth, no justice, the American way
