Under a shade of darkness I rise
Iâll show you things like youâve never seen before
I am the reaper of death, I am the savior of man

No, I never wanted for my life to be so meaningless
Hate is so steady, so steady in my veins
This rage just keeps growing inside
Itâs getting harder to kill, itâs getting harder to live

Sleepâ¦ In the darkest days of slumber
Waitâ¦ For the end to come

Pray for all the blood to spill
Itâs getting harder to breathe
Itâs getting harder to die
Sinners were all the same in the grips of death
You walk on water, I drown in darkness

Sleepâ¦ In the darkest days of slumber
Waitâ¦ For the end to come

Lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, pride

Itâs the way I live
