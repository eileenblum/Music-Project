Comeâ¦ Come to me, everlasting fire
Lift me up and bring me higher power
To kill the tyrants, to kill the born in chaos
Avenge the living with all distinctive force

Comeâ¦ Come to me, everlasting fire
Engulf my soul, engulf my every desire
To kill the tyrants, to kill the born in chaos
Avenge the dead with all distinctive force

Hear my calling, feel my wrath, like a crow a swarm,
Through the dark I roam, in this castle, the vision of the dead

No justice, no reason
No freedom, no wrath
No truth, no will
Nowhere to run

I summon thee, ohâ¦ great fire
To bring eternal devastation

Witness sorrow, waters drenched in black, cities in ruins, angels fallingâ¦

Open the gates of hell, crush the enemies below, let your demons flowâ¦
Comeâ¦ FIRE!

No justice, no reason
No freedom, no wrath
No truth, no will
Nowhere to run

I summon thee, ohâ¦ great fire
To bring eternal devastation

Comeâ¦ come to me, everlasting fire
Lift me up and bring me higher power
To kill the tyrants, to kill the born in chaos
Avenge the living with all distinctive force

Comeâ¦ Come to me, everlasting fire
Engulf my soul, engulf my every desire
To kill the tyrants, to kill the born in chaos

Avenge the dead with all distinctive force

FIRE!
