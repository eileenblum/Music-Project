Enter your mind
Enter your soul
Search the seeds of contemplation, this is your life but this is my world
Hence the end of your god
Let the voice of freedom reign again

Fanatic rage that rots core, entitled children above the law
Political ambush to serve the elite, no one is free to believe
Enslaved to profit a world in ruins, distant visions of dying era
Scratching the surface determined to stay alive

No more fucking lies!

If I was godâ¦ Iâd burn it all Iâd take it to the ground and light it up, light up

If you donât care, why should I? Set this world on fire

All you believe is a world of illusions
All you believe is a lie, nothing is left, nothing is real, engaged and ready to kill

As sentenced to live is as sentenced to die
Search for answers above the skies, this is your life but this is my world
Henceâ¦ the end of your god
Let the voice of freedom reign again

No more fucking lies!

If I was godâ¦ Iâd burn it all, Iâd take it to the ground and light it up, light up
If you donât care, why should I? Set this world on fire

Inch by inch, step by step, with all my heart Iâll burn this fucker down!
