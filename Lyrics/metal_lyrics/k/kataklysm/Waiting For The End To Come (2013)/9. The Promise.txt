Itâs a world of confusion, everything you see is an illusion
Thereâs no way to choose right from wrong

Everyoneâs opinion is pointless
Everyoneâs judgement is useless
Your days are numbered, your faith destruction

I donât want your poison to linger in my veins
Feel the anger within, from an ocean of hate

Itâs a promise in blood, walk away
Itâs a promise in blood, promise in blood!

Defy, let the world strike you down
Defy, take a step back, let the world strike you down

Itâs a brink of disaster run away, pull the plug and throw it all away
Let it go, puppet masterâ¦ I am king and you are my slave

I donât want your poison, to linger in my veins
Feel the anger within, from an ocean of hate

Itâs a promise in bloodâ¦ walk away
Itâs a promise in bloodâ¦ promise in blood!

Itâs a promise in blood
