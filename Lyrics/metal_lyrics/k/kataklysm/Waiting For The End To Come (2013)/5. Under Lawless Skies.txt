Ride the strains of your life into despair
Hide most of your thoughts into a stare
The reason of endless struggle is imperfection
Pressure me, seize my strength, paralyze my soul for you

Lay hopeless like a sheep led to slaughter
Like a wolf I howl under lawless skies

The weight of all of your fears, burns in the air you breathe
The glory of all your past shattered in vein, eternal
Plunge into a sea of madness, I can smell your existence rotting away

Lay hopeless like a sheep led to slaughter
Like a wolf I howl under lawless skies
