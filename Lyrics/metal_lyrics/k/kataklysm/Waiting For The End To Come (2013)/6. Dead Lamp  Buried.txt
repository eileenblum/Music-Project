Visions of chaos inhabit our lives, no truth in a world of lies
The parallels of sanity, border the insane

Time is endless, pain is faithless
A mirror of broken dreams our souls remembered

Life, death, weâre dead and buried
When all is gone our souls will turn to dust

Six feet below, youâll find salvation forever
Time is endless, pain is faithless
A mirror of broken dreams our souls remembered

Life, death, weâre dead and buried
When all is gone our souls will turn to dust
Life, death, weâre dead and buried
When all is gone we fade into the sun

Dead and buried

Hold on to nothing, fall in disgrace
Thereâs no one here, to cradle your fate
We are nothing, but shadows and dust, save meâ¦

Life, death, weâre dead and buried
When all is gone our souls will turn to dust
Life, death, weâre dead and buried
When all is gone we fade into the sun
