It lives inside, the seed of life
Ripped apart, silenced
Broken and demolished

Crippled emotions feed existence
Ripped apart, silenced
Broken and demolished

Animals
Just like animals
We live and die
We multiply
The thirst of blood keeps us alive
Just like animals

We live to dominate, we need the urge to kill, we are the victims, we are the prey

You canât change who you are
Your primitive ways will always prevail
The need to conquer, the need to be incomplete
Rise above the waters, just to drown and suffer, just to feel alive
Thereâs no escape from life, who we are is endlessâ¦ until we die again

Just like animals
We live and die
We multiply
The thirst of blood keeps us alive
Just like animals

We live to dominate, we need the urge to kill, we are the victims, we are the prey

You canât kill who you are
Youâre an animal
