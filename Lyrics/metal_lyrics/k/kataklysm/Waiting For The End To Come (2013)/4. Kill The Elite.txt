The earth is venomous, all shall die under one mind
Their souls are treacherous, crush the weak under one sign
Release your anger, they command under your cries
Obey your master, enslaved to die under red skies

The blind lead the blind, eternal darkness
The poor eat the poor, forevermore
The rich eat it all, they want it all
We are sentenced to fail

Break through the circle of trust that leads to nowhere
Thereâs no way out of here, the blood they spill is gone forever

Kill the elite
Darkness falls upon us
Kill the elite
We are the light of rebellion

The end of your greed, the end of your control
These chains will break, unleash the beast of humanity
Set me free

Look into these eyes
What you see is real
Itâs the last thing youâll ever see

Kill the elite
Darkness falls upon us
Kill the elite
We are the light of rebellion
