Your fate is made of words that you spill
Like the innocent souls that you kill
No justice for resistance... my strength is measured by courage
Like the lies that bleed from your mouth, I'll put an end to it all
For honor, for freedom from this emotional prison
This is my heart laid to rest
This is my soul reborn
I'll fight forever... I promise you
Determined... Determined to conquer this life, conquer this world of shit
Determined... Determined to build from this pain, day after day
Determined...Determined to break through these chains and spit on your grave
Determined... Determined to vanquish my demons, vanquish my enemies
Step aside, walk away
Bring the seeds of confrontation
Terrified to pacify, standing tall too all your treason
An eye for eye, walk the thin line
Desperate cries are sentenced to fail
Rise above, colossal walls... this is my vow of vengeance
Your fate is made of words that you spill
Like the innocent souls that you kill
No justice for resistance... my strength is measured by courage
Like the lies that bleed from your mouth, I'll put an end to it all
For honor, for freedom from this emotional prison
Determined... Determined to conquer this life, conquer this world of shit
Determined... Determined to build from this pain, day after day
Determined...Determined to break through these chains and spit on your grave
Determined... Determined to vanquish my demons, vanquish my enemies
This is my heart laid to rest
This is my soul reborn
I'll fight forever... I promise you
