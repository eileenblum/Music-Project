Testify to broken dreams
Annihilate your self esteem
Persecute the will to live
Revenge is something I can't kill
Seeds of torment standing still
Determination built at will
Hope is something far away
Convincing me to fade away
Severed promise turned to lies, destined to rise
Everything seems so dishonest
Free my soul and reach the sky
I will survive all the demons you throw at me
I will deny all the weakness inside
I will remember this day until the end of time
I will stand tall as the walls collapse on me
Challenged again
Villain remembered
This is where I've risen to power
Testify to broken dreams
Annihilate your self esteem
Persecute the will to live
Revenge is something I can't kill
Seeds of torment standing still
Determination built at will
Hope is something far away
Convincing me to fade away
Severed promise turned to lies, destined to rise
Everything seems so dishonest
Free my soul and reach the sky
I will survive all the demons you throw at me
I will deny all the weakness inside
I will remember this day until the end of time
I will stand tall as the walls collapse on me
