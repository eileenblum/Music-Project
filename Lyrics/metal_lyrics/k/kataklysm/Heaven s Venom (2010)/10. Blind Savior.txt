Hey... can you hear me? Oh sweet angel
Hey... can you see me? Oh sweet devil
I'm on my knees but why can't you save me,
I've felt your warm embrace with a touch of hate
I can't feel you love, I can only feel pain!
Innocence will slaughter the weak and I will stand the test of time
And angels weep in darkened shades for sins my soul cannot feel
Take me away to that somber place, where all angels and demons cry...
Take me away to that somber place... where men face the god that lies
Show me the light...
Blind savior
Before my faith turns to dust
Blind savior... save me...
Hey... can you hear me? Oh sweet angel
Hey... can you see me? Oh sweet devil
My tortured soul is the guidance of sorrow, there's no comfort in your hollow visions
I can't feel your love, I can only feel pain!
Innocence will slaughter the weak and I will stand the test of time
And angels weep in darkened shades for sins my soul cannot feel
Take me away to that somber place, where all angels and demons cry...
Take me away to that somber place... where men face the god that lies
Blind savior... blind savior, we all die in the land of the sinner
