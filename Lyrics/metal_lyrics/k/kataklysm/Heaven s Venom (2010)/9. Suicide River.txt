There's no surrender, there's no immediate answer
We all drown in the suicide river
This is reality, there's no place to hide
We all die in this suicide river
Come with me and drift away
To lands of freedom, lands of passion
There is no self prison, there is no self indulgence
Live with truth and die with nothing, I will take this oath of blood
Fallen from tears of disgrace
A place for your soul to embrace
Historic signs of captured era
Dissolved into emptiness
To resurrect my entity
I will bleed the sun free
Engraved into eternity
The past is alive
The rope is around my neck
Come with me and drift away
To lands of freedom, lands of passion
There is no self prison, there is no self indulgence
Live with truth and die with nothing, I will take this oath of blood
There's no surrender, there's no immediate answer
We all drown in the suicide river
This is reality, there's no place to hide
We all die in this suicide river
