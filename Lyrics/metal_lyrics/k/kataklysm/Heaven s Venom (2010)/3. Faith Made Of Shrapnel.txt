It's far from over
I've been waiting for way to long, all bets are off
Instinct for dreadful times...this is the end all rules are broken
I scream rebellion, severed emotions
Modern day chaos...
Ignite your faith is made of shrapnel
Detonate your fate is made of shrapnel
Fear of letting go
Fear of bringing madness
Fear to rise above and never looking back
Climb the tower, essence of power
Everyday I am stronger than ever
Sinful test feeling distressed there's no time for concentration
Do as you do, live as you live
Feed form the light bring on this might
Rip through his heart, nothing is right
only what your mind decides
The spirit is dead, the knowledge once said
Perish the world inside, there's no one left to fight
Crave mi sanity enter reality
Insanity, lost mobility
Fear of letting go
Fear of bringing madness
Fear to rise above and never looking back
Climb the tower, essence of power
Everyday I am stronger than ever
Sinful test feeling distressed there's no time for concentration
Do as you do, live as you live
Feed form the light bring on this might
Rip through his heart, nothing is right
only what your mind decides
