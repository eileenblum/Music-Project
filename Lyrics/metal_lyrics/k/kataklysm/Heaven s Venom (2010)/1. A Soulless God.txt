[Intro]
"The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very rough mean place and I
don't care how tough you think you are, it will always bring you to your knees
and keep you there, permanently, if you let it. You or nobody ain't never gonna
hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard
you can get hit, and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep
moving forward. If you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're
worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hit."
[Rocky Balboa]

Once you die there's no coming back
Is it survival or is it emptiness? I scratch the surface just to see another day
No one could understand... this life has given me... addiction is just to hard to see
Even god forgot about me, as I stand here with no journey to fulfill
There's a hole in the sky big enough for me to fall
There's no one there to catch me as i burn into this hell
The blade is touching my skin, suicide is coming within
A past no one else see... no hope, no time, no identity
Pain is underrated when your soul is annihilated
What is your fear? What is your motive for life
I am the example of all that is your failures
Sink into me and drown with me
My eyes are bleeding, my hands are hurting and the sun is burning
No one could understand... this life has given me... addiction is just to hard to see
Even god forgot about me, as i stand here chaos reing's my destiny
Even god forgot about me, I'm just a useless being with no journey to fulfill tales of a souless god
There's a hole in the sky, big enough for me to fall
There's no one there to catch me as i burn into this hell
