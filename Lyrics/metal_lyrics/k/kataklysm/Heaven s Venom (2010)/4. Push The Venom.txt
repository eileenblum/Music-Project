You are the poison, flowing through my veins
You are the face of terror, eating through my soul
Push the venom deep in my veins
Poison my soul and distort my pain
Temptation is stronger than you can imagine
Slaves to the world's crushing desires
Face the God that you'll never see
Cry your hurt to a heart that's free
I'm the one you love to hate
I'm the one you strive to break
Push the venom... push the venom of lies!
Push the venom... push the venom for a world that's dies... dead!
Bring them down!
Rip me apart, take all you want
My strengths my will, this blood is real
'til there's nothing left to kill, pacify the weakness inside
Fade to dark extinct the light
I was once the dream of greed now this dream has turned to feed
Push the venom... push the venom of lies!
Push the venom... push the venom for a world that's dies...
You tried taking everything from me but the things you couldn't take are the
values you don't have
Integrity, courage, loyalty
I will never forget... no!
I am the poison, flowing through your veins
I am the face of terror, eating through your soul
Break the code of silence... I am the king of defiance
I am the rebel of power... I am the son of survival
As your fall into darkness... I will rise from the sun
I'm alive... I'm alive!
