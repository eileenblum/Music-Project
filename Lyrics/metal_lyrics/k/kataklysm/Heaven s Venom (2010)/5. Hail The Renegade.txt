Crawl deeper, defiant
Rebel at heart, never surrender
Soldier's of fortune
I am the renegade the one of fire when all hope is gone
Hail..Hail, Hail the renegade traitor to the sun, death will come
Courage in hail of bullets
Fallen brother, fallen hero
Shed no tear for freedom is here
Victory for the sons of anarchy
Centuries with wings of prosperous glory
Divide, Conquer
Chosen ones, no retreat, angel's of death
Prophets of heaven's venom
I am the renegade the one of fire when all hope is gone
Hail..Hail, hail the renegade traitor to the sun, death will come
Courage in hail of bullets
Fallen brother, fallen hero
Shed no tear for freedom is here
Victory for the sons of anarchy
Centuries with wings of prosperous glory
