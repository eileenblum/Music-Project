Born with a feeling of hate
A rebel mind with sense of purpose
Never doubted the fire inside
Join us and scream with me
Das Feuer lebt
Always thought the day would come where we would all unite like this
Always knew the power of alliance could grow like this
No one in a million years could ever dream of breaking this
Together we should vanquish all the trends, sp scream with me
Das Feuer lebt
Stand with me and rise in glory
The fire lives forever
Overcome all the fears... that life will bring
Always thought the day would come where we would all unite like this
Always knew the power of alliance could grow like this
No one in a million years could ever dream of breaking this
Together we should vanquish all the trends, sp scream with me
Born with a feeling of hate
A rebel mind with sense of purpose
Never doubted the fire inside
Join us and scream with me
Das Feuer lebt
