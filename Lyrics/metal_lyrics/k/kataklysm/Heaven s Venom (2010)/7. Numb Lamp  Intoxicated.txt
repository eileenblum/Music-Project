Everyday is a struggle to live
Find peace at the end of a bottle
Wash away all my anger and sorrow
Don't even care if i see tomorrow
Numb &amp; Intoxicated
Too hard to breathe, too hard to feel
Bring me, courage in a glass
Numb &amp; Intoxicated
Kiss the devil's hand, God is dead
This is war inside my head
The more you push.. the harder I get
The more you hate.. the stronger I get
The more you scream.. the louder I get
My skin is thicker than death
It's never late to kill a mind
It's always easier to numb a soul
Desperation leads imagination
Incarceration
Numb &amp; Intoxicated
Kiss the devil's hand, God is dead
Its like a war inside my head
Your push me over the edge ... Intoxication
