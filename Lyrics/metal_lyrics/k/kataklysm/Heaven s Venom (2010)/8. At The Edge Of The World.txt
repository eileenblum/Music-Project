Hey you fucking liar
You're full of shit
You got me standing at the end of the world
Never thought I'd see the light, true colors blend in black
Twisted into parallel worlds
I fall into dying arms
Cry, cry for m with no sympathy
The sky will fall from reality, bury me whole
Burn the sphere of desires your stole
I will break these chains that suffocate
Blood for blood... I climb the mountain of deliverance...
Bleed for me, for this heart you murdered
Hey you fucking liar
You're full of shit
Hey you fucking traitor
It's called respect
You got me standing at the edge of the world
One time and never again, you ever take me for a fool
This is a new time, witness my resurrection
Cry, cry for m with no sympathy
The sky will fall from reality, bury me whole
Burn the sphere of desires your stole
I will break these chains that suffocate
Blood for blood... I climb the mountain of deliverance...
