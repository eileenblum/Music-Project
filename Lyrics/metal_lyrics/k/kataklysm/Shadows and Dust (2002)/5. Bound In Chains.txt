as you enter my kingdom
the blood flows, the stream grows
locked inside this cage...
my heart weeps for freedom

i'm bound in chains
i'm a prisoner of your hate
i'm bound in chains
for eternity there's no escape
i'm bound in chains
the winds have taken me... it's too late
i'm bound in chains
darkness takes all the love i create

the gates open wide, i look at the world outside
if i took one moment to cry
i would be denied

i crawl into the abyss
i taste the fruit of solitude
no one is there for me... foreverlasating sleep

whirlwind inside my head
confusion to know who i am
i beg for a chance to redeem
to take back my self esteem
