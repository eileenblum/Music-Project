our souls carved in stone
withstand the test of time
testify the ancient ways
when all good will turn bad thy angels will fall

invade the putrid masses
intelligence to stupidity
increase the pressure within
no return from isolation
no chance to recuporate
we are lost in deceipt

years of enlightment for decades in darkness
we drown in time... behold the signs!

the storm arrives, we pray to die
forgotten and betrayed
life comes in full circle
you can't escape what is meant to be
without proving your true identity

invade the putrid masses
intelligence to stupidity
increase the pressure within
no return from isolation
no chance to recuporate
we are lost in deceipt

years of enlightment for decades in darkness
we drown in time... behold the signs!
