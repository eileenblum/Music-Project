we stand in hell... inside the tombs of heaven
my way is your way... we play fire with fire

we fight to die, survive to kill
man of strenght, man of sin, man of courage
forever sorrow, no one left behind
we stand alone, until the last cry

i can't feel... my nerves have turned to steal
my emiotions... unreal, pull the trigger to kill
forgive me father... for i have sinned

beneath all innocence
my mind is covered in blood
i feel like i'm born again
without the heart i once left

save me!... save me!... for i am no more...

honour is everything i am
disconnected from reality... this is war...

beneath all innocence
my mind is covered in blood
i feel like i'm born again
wihtout the heart i once felt

we will hunt them down...
we will strike where the enemy sleeps

we stand in hell... inside the tombs of heaven
my way is your way... we play fire with fire
