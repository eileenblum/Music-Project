destiny har proven time and time again
that our ways will deceive us
no matter how hard we try
we fail to realsie... we are so volotile
we are beings of no historical sense
we desecrate everything we achieve

never seen, never tried
never felt, never believed
all the things we value
all the things we love &amp; hate
all the things we are and will not be...
and will not feel and will not see...

swallowed in hate beneath the dark waters

where is your paradise?

all i see is pain beyond pain...
no one will ever ackowledge their true faith
it's all lies written in blood
from this day forward we are blind

death comes calling, we start hidding
this is where you'll see the true strength of man
