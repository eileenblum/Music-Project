i am beyond salvation
i am beyond redemption
i am beyond the ones you heal...you kill...

and i've entered the light
just to fall in darkness
you've taken it all from me...
and because of you i cease to exist
i've been forsaken
deep inside the core of my mind
i fall from heaven

[chorus]
i am beyond salvation
i am beyond redemption
i am beyond the ones you heal... you kill...
murder... murder... you've killed my soul
and now your searching for more

you burned me inside, you left me to die!
you tought it was over for me...
but i will rise again!

[chorus]
