this time we went to far
this time we opend the scars
to feel destruction inside this worlds addiction
last dance for the new generation
beloved ones... virgins of war
neverseen the true colors of sufferance

forever... face the face of war
forever... we shall face the face of war
we shall not fall, we shall stand tall
in the midst of all this pain
we will face the face of war

'til the end of time, worlds will collide
people will die
and everyone you trust will turn on you
to save themselves from the devil's grip

stay on guard, make sure you don't drift away
prepare for battle... bloodbath of innocent man
guilty for taking life... for taking life!

corpse of dead man surround me
release me from this sanctuary

forever... face the face of war
forever... we shall face the face of war

we shall not fall, we shall stand tall
in the midst of all this pain
we will face the face of war
