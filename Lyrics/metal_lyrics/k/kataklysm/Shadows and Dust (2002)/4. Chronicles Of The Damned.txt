it is written in the book of sin
we shall die in vein
sacrificed for not believing
slaughtered in shame
we breath the poison and swallow the lies
to destroy the foundations we build

i can see what you see
my soul just disagrees
i can't feel or be... everything you want me to be
dicate you prophecies
i'm no slave to jealousy
i will die defending, the air that i breath...

down the path we go
no man's land to follow
feeble man emprisoned by imagery

no choice to obey
no choice to slay
no choice to fade away...

crippled idealogy, makes no sense for me
kill yourself for the... and the paradise you'll see...
