Never forget where you come from

Iron will
Iron will

I built this from the ground
Two decades straight from the underground
With blood and sweat
And everything in between

You laughed when I was down
Now it's my turn
To laugh at your pathetic life

Give me your best shot
I know you got it, hate it
Give me your best shot
I know you'll give it
Give it
Give it to me

The pressure so thick
It suffocates your mind
Reality hits
And emotions collide
From the bottom to the core
It wasn't given
It was driven

Your weakness, my strength
Rising to power
Determination
Annihilation
Status of mind to lead the wicked to rise
Conquer the fear
Open your eyes and remember
The day the last revel was born

Give me your best shot
I know you got it
Give me your best shot
I know you'll give it
Give it
Give it to me

Iron will
No compromise, no surrender
This is it
Iron will
Forever
I'm ready to kill
Iron will
Kill, kill
Fuck your trend!
