How much can I take?
How long can I live this way?
All the memories I got, they turn to black,
They turn to darknessâ¦

You try to squeeze every inch of my life, you try to take
All the things that keep me alive
But Iâm the one that canât be broken or forgotten

Your angels fall from the skies
Your Salvation is a lie
My blood is thicker than water
And your world is Shattered

Thereâs no mountain bigger than life
No man bigger than the sun
My fist bleed for courage,
My hands burn for honor

Your angels fall from the skies
Your Salvation is a lie
My blood is thicker than water
And your world is Shattered

Leave the orchid of hope for the fire of your soul
Let go the rage, let go the hate, lead the rising sun

I harvest the pain
Iâll make you bleed till the end of your lifeâ¦
Until your world is Shatteredâ¦ Shattered
