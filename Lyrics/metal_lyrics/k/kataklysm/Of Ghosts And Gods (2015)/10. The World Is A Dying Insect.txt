Everyone's alive
But everyone is dead
And everyone's a fucking liar

Everyone is greed
Spreading the disease
Living in a world of hypocrisy

We suffer pain
We live to lie
But no one sees the truth's alive

In our souls we thrive
In our minds we died

Paradise
For parasites [2x]

Spill the blood
From corners of the earth
Dethroned kingdoms
To fall for eternity

I felt them cry
Insects of a dying world
Repent your souls
Awaken the sun

Rise from the sands of the fallen
Bleed for them, bleed for humanity

Trapped in the corridors of sorrow
The world is a dying insect [2x]

Beneath the shadows
Beneath the heavens
Beneath the world you left behind

I will descend
I will survive
i will be here till the end of time

Feel me alive

Alive! [2x]
