Through these empty walls
I lay waste to the face of existence
Thereâs no Glory left to die
Thereâs no moment to be free

Bow to surrender
I swallow all your fears
The legend is real of Ghosts &amp; Gods
Pray for the dead, pray for the conscious
Enter the light, levitate the soul

There is no law

I, reign the sun
The coil dissolved in ruins
Paint the face of despair, before you die
I have no mercy, I shall torch the earth
Prayâ¦ Mortal

Vindicationâ¦ Vindicationâ¦

Shadows of death settle the dust of the horizon
Chains of Humanity, Eclipse the sun
We are born to kill...

Bow to surrender
I swallow all your fears
The legend is real of Ghosts &amp; Gods
Pray for the dead, pray for the conscious
Enter the light, levitate the soul
