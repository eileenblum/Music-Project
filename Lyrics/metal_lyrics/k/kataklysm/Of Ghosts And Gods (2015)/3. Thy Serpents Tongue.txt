Fallâ¦ You fall from grace
Every time you feed from your desolation
Rise from your demise
Accept to feed from your evolution

Nowâ¦ Bow forever
Dragging me down
Downâ¦ Bow forever
Dragging meâ¦

Theyâ pull you down and feed on your descent
All will perishâ¦ into the abyss

The gates of existence
The chambers of deceit
Where dead men dwell and All is lost

Taste the serpentâs tongue, youâll fall forever and feel its poison

Liars, thieves, pestilence of the earth
Infect the virgin souls
Desecrate, Dominate, Humiliate
All innocence dies

Theyâ pull you down and feed on your descent
All will perishâ¦ into the abyss

You Taste the serpentâs tongue and youâll fall forever
And feel its poisonâ¦ feel the poison

Look at you nowâ¦
