Thereâs no truth in this world of lies
No compromise, no place to live
No place to die, no peace, no truth, no authority

And Iâm dead in the eyes of the sane
And Iâm dead in the eyes of your faith

Iâm lost in this society
Iâm lost in this hell you breathe

Soul Destroyer, come to me
Give me shelter or give me death

Soul Destroyer envy me
Bring me solace or bring me death

Lawlessâ¦ Freedom and its enemies
Anarchy of total disorder

Ignorance of all mankind
Youâre breeding the chaos; youâre breeding destruction

Innocence of all mankind
Weâre drowning in fear; weâre drowning in vain

Darkness, see me dwell
Instinct of the animal
Soul Destroyer, come to me
Give me shelter or give me death

Soul Destroyer envy me
Bring me solace or bring me death

Ignorance of all mankind
Youâre breeding the chaos; youâre breeding destruction

Innocence of all mankind
Weâre drowning in fear; weâre drawing in vain

Strength in numbers, a myth that dies
A thousand years, yield the hammer
We pray for justice to never come
A thousand lies to crippled minds
