Iâm going Craz, The world is torn apart
Your churches, your asylums, Itâs all the same to me
You own the face of greed
You live your hypocritical lives
Your sanctuaries, Your Paradise
Iâm dead to your lies

Thereâs nowhere to Dream
Thereâs nowhere left to live
Weâve lost all compassion
Abort your faith

Everything is gone
Everything is lost
Thereâs nowhere to run
Abort your pain

Thereâs nowhere to runâ¦

Theyâve broken the seal and theyâve taken our souls
And theyâve taken our hearts and theyâve taken our minds.
We relinquished our freedoms to pay for our fears
And weâre sentenced to die in a world of chaos
We feast on the angels and we dance with the demons
And we play with the fire that burns us inside
We runâ¦ runâ¦ from the truth of decay
Embalmed existence of the self proclaimed

Liftâ¦ meâ¦ Up

Thereâs nowhere to Dream
Thereâs nowhere left to live
Weâve lost all compassion
Abort your faith

Everything is gone
Everything is lost
Thereâs nowhere to run
Abort your pain
