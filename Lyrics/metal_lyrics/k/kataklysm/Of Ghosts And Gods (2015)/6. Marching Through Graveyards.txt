Kings of Kings curse the world
Those who rise shall reap the earth
Face the gods, the faceless ones
Descend, the sinful tree of snakes
Bow thy hands in heavenâs blood
Throw away the key of life
Burn upon the cross of lies
Severed veins will grow in time

You loathe me
You rip me apart
You hate me and Iâm the face of god

Join my legions
Erase the past
You love me and Iâm the face of hell

Feed upon the blackened nest
Thirst the darkened waterâs filth
Heretic but conformist to venomous blood

Seal the fate of ancient laws
Where sacrificial tombs are laid to waste

You loathe me
You rip me apart
You hate me and Iâm the face of god

Join my legions
Erase the past
You love me and Iâm the face of hell

Soul &amp; mind, vanished
Weâre marching through graveyards
Weâre dead, lunatics
Marching through graveyards
