Iâve been carrying crosses for most of my life
Iâve been crushed by their weight and still survived
Pain is just another dayâ¦
And fear is all youâll ever know
Iâve written on your walls with sorrow
A just reflection of your hate

All The broken promises Iâll never forget
Sacrifices lost in the voice of regret
Born from the hands of the righteous
These are the hands that will tear you down
No more Serenity, This is Heresy
Welcome to your sanctityâ¦
Bleeding for better days

The face of your sins
The face of your demise... Enlightenment
A day of reckoning has arrivedâ¦ Enlightenment

Iâm carrying crossesâ¦ Iâm carrying crossesâ¦ for youâ¦
Take it all back

Iâve been carrying crosses for most of my life
Iâve been crushed by their weight and still survived
Pain is just another dayâ¦
And fear is all youâll ever know
Iâve written on your walls with sorrow
A just reflection of your hate
Iâm carrying crossesâ¦ Iâm carrying crossesâ¦ for you
