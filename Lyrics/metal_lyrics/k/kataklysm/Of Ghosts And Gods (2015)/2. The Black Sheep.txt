Blood for Blood, eye for an eye
Let my vengeance reign the sky
Let it Rainâ¦ feel its pain
Iâm the catalyst of your demise
If it breathes, it lies; if it bleeds, it dies
Iâll cut you open from the inside
Restlessâ¦in a world thatâs shameless
The slaves are endless

Hold me down, push me away
Sentence me and bury me alive
Iâll never be like you, I wonât conform
Iâll never change, Iâm the Black Sheep

Your face to the ground, donât make a sound
How does it feel to be losing your crown?
All of the sins you say I committed, are all of the sins
That you have admitted
Hate me for all the things that you couldnât be.
Fear me forever
All the poison you put in my head
All the rage youâve written instead
All your attempts to murder my soulâ¦ Murderâ¦ Murder
Fuck you all.. Iâm still alive!

You got the noose around my neck
You got the rope to see me dead
But I wonât go away, I wonât fade away,
I wonât be the one in disarray
Itâs all lieâ¦ for them to rise
They want to see me fall in line
Like a sheep for slaughter, a clown for laughter
Controlled order

In this world you better live for something
Or you going to die for nothing

Hold me down, push me away
Sentence me and bury me alive
Iâll never be like you, I wonât conform
Iâd rather die, Iâm the Black Sheep
