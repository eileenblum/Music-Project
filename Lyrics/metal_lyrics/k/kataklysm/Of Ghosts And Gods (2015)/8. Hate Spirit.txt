Weâre in deep, weâre suffocating..
Weâre left to figure it out

You feed the poisoned well, corrupt the truth inside
I never thought Iâd be the one keeping you alive
All this is suicide, we love to sacrifice
Weâre blind but criticize, the earthâs final cry

Hate Spirit: you burn the world alive
Youâve taken everything
And now weâre here left to die

You walk the faded line, commit to die inside
Your Emptiness is vast, a soul that cannot rise
Protector of mankind, a lesson learned in life
We love to hate, everything that we canât control

Hate Spirit: you burn the world alive
Youâve taken everything
And now weâre here left to die

You tear the soul apart
