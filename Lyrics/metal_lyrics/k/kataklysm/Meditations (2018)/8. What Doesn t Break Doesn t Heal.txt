What doesn't break, doesn't heal
The faster you learn, the slower you burn
What doesn't break, doesn't heal
The faster you learn, the quicker they turn

Break it, just take it and seize it
Let the pain become your strength
Your altar, your tower
Your everything, everything

They said I'd fall in the ocean of failure, failure
They said I'd crawl to the gates of hell, to the gates of hell
But I'm hard to kill, hard to kill, I'm here for the hunt
And want it all, and want it all, I'll take it all, I'll take it all

Bring me your tyrants
Bring me your gods
Bring me your wrath
Bring me your hate

What doesn't break, doesn't heal
What doesn't break, doesn't heal
What doesn't break, doesn't heal

I drank from your poisoned well, yeah
I walked on your rusted nails
I drowned in your sea of blood
And I'm still alive, still alive, still alive
I'm still alive
