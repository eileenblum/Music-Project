Run where you can't hide
Your stabbing words of anger
Steal my innocence dry
Steal the sun from the sky
I feel all of your hatred
I see all of your weakness
Lost in a vision

I push all of you bastards out
I'll take all of you traitors out
The last breath I'll take
The last breath I'll take is yours

You can't escape your own shadow
You can't walk backwards and see your path forward
Every single time you broke the promise
You looked me dead in the eyes and lied
It's just a matter of time

You can't escape your own shadow
You can't walk backwards and see your path forward
Every single time you broke the promise
You looked me dead in the eyes and lied
It's just a matter of time

I push all of you bastards out
I'll take all of you traitors out
The last breath I'll take
This last breath I'll take
I push all of you bastards out
I'll take all of you traitors out
The last breath I'll take
The last breath I'll take is yours

Is yours
