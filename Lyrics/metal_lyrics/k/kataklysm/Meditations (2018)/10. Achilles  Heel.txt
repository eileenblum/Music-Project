Can you hear them screaming? As they storm into the night
Where shadows take cover and lash at the light
King of the fallen, you come to pay
Pay the gate keeper
To save your soul... betray your dreams untold...
Son of lies... fire of the gods...

Descend the arrows (descend the arrows)
Upon the burning bodies (upon the burning bodies)
You left to die
To die

Fear me
In your darkest hour
I climb the ladder of snakes
Enthralled and mangles

Stay with me
Until the very end
No matter how hard you fall
You'll always be my Achilles' heel

In war defeated
In triumph uplifted
I lift the spirit of victory

Dawn the new age
Where everything means nothing
Where you're swallowed in black
And the vultures fly above
Denied existence
As you fall to your knees

Stay with me
Until the very end
No matter how hard you fall
You'll always be my Achilles' heel
