Ride along the fiery skies above
Walk the path of the fearless ambition that crushes the souls below
Hand me the light that will bleed the sun to dark
Then let the ravens roam the faithless core

Connected through the parallel abyss
Struggle the fear of failure beneath the horizon
Let the vision guide you to the gates of knowledge
Bleed the fears your mind beholds

Shatter the chains that nail you down
Eclipse the mirrors of deceit
Trample down the faithful assassins
And taste the blade of vengeance

In limbic resonance

Pull me up from these drowning waters
Intensify the core inside
Pull me up from the fire below
Intensify my will to survive

Survive

I will be the one to stand above all
I will be the one to reign again
