...And then I saw blood
I saw your life fading away
I saw you fall to darkness
I saw you blame me for everything

So hate me, love me
Envy me, but destroy me
For everything you cannot be
Cannot see and cannot feel
Above all the loyalty
You're a traitor to your own heart
I'll never stand in your way
No I'll never stand in your way
Of self-destruction

Rise above the shadows
Rise above your empty words
I walk the path of those who battle
Beyond redemption

Slave
You're a slave to all your demons
Take a bite of this rotten apple
See your fate unfold
Let temptation walk right through you
Bleed you dry into a venomous snake
Take the steps of decay
And forever lay to rest

...And then I saw blood
I saw the truth stabbing your heart
I saw your core bleeding to death
I saw your fear fading away

So hate me, love me
Envy me, but destroy me
For everything you cannot be
Cannot see and cannot feel

Through your everything
Let the world sow, everything falls
Let the guilt of sin die
In the wake of the burning sun
Salvation will never come
Betrayer of souls
Our bound forever lost
Forever lost

Rise above the shadows
Rise above your empty words
I walk the path of those who battle
Beyond redemption
