I told you before and I'll tell you again
I'm the last one you'll see before you die
I came from the gutter
Just to see you suffer

Don't say a word, don't even breathe
All the poison you spill, all the lies you feed
Designed to kill and torture lives
All the innocent darkness with no regrets

No regrets

This chaos you bring, a symphonic greed
As you fall in your fate, the abysmal doom
These hypocrite lies made to enslave
As you sharpened the blade... incarcerate
I've seen you stumble in your weakened soul
All the broken promises untold
The blood will spill, there's no escape
I'm here to say, your time is over

You think you know it all... But before you open your mouth, you need to take a hard look in the mirror, learn how to walk the walk before you talk the talk.

Outsider
Outsider

It's who I am, it's what I live for
Two steps from the grave... always
I came to kill your heroes
I came to kill your heroes

No place to live, no place to die
No heart to break and no guilt to take
All the things you said, I'll never forget
You push to kill, there's no remorse
I step inside your pitiful life
And tear apart all your broken lies
I can't express all the anger inside
I'm sick of the world as it comes undone
