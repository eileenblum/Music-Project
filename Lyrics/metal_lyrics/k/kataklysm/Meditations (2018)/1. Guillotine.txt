Piece by piece, limb by limb
Hear the screams of a dying world
Everything you bring smells of decay

Because you, you let me down
Deep down in a state on confusion

Hate, you build on your hate
As you lay under the guillotine

Stone by stone, strength by strength
Your betrayal is monumental
Hiding through the cracks of fear
I see you dying

Because you, you let me down
Deep down in a different dimension

Greed, it's all about your greed
As you die under the guillotine

Heads will roll, justice served

Because you, you let me down
Deep down in a state on confusion

Hate, you build on your hate
As you lay under the guillotine

Because you, you let me down
Deep down in a different dimension

Greed, it's all about your greed
As you die under the guillotine
