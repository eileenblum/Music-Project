Bend the arc and cut the cord
Let the rage and blood flow
Imagine the world you left behind
Coming for vengeance with the gods below

And they'll never let go
Till you give up your soul
In the fire of rejection

Bend the arc and cut the cord
Live your life in torment and hell
There's no choice for you my friend
All the guilt will swallow you whole

And they'll never let go
Till you give up your soul
In the fire of rejection

And they'll never let go
Till you give up your soul
In the fire of rejection

Can you withstand the pressure within
Can you carry the knives that will serve her to your death
They will topple your kingdom and bring you to your knees
So bend the arc and cut the cord
Bend the arc and cut the cord
Bend the arc and cut the cord
Bend the arc and cut the cord
