Born to kill and destined to die

We got the seed
It's deep inside
And ready to bloom
Ready to strike
It's waiting in the dark
It's looming in the front
Cast aside your dreams
Cast aside your demons

Bred to kill with no remorse
Bred to feed the god machine
Bred to walk among the dead
Bred to dictate the way of life

Your hope is my demise
The sky will come falling down
We're born to kill and destined to die
Born to kill and destined to die

Don't you threat on me
Don't you disrespect where you come from
Where you breathe, where you live
And where you'll die
Where you'll die

I am lawless
Feel the cut from the broken glass
Head first in the fire
Fall down to the traitors above
You crawl left to burn

I am lawless
Feel the cut from the broken glass
Head first in the fire
Left to burn

Born to kill
Destined to die
Born to kill
Destined to die
Born to kill
Destined to die
Born to kill
Destined to die
