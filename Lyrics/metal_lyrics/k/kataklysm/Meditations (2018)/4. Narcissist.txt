Narcissist
Narcissist

You're a narcissist and you can't lie
Everything you spit is bulletproof
Because you're godlike
But I see right through you

You're a coward
You're weak and distorted
You're a fraud
You're just human

I bet you'll never see this coming
I bet you worship the gods of deceit
I see you dwell in your heaven
Where the pit of snakes dwell to rot forever

I'm here driven to cast you out...

You're a narcissist and you can't see
All the things that lead the blind
You drown in yourself
The mirror of death

You're a liar, liar
You're a narcissist, narcissist
You're a venom, venom
You're a narcissist
