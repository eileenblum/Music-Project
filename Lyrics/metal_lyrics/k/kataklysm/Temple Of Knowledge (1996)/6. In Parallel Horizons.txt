[Act III - Spontaneous Alura Projection]

Under the Daylight, rays the Angels.
In the Horizons, define the Laws.

Across the celestial Nuclei.
The Zenith's arcane Towers are the eyed Gemini
Stars assigned to the spiritual Nova's Paths.
Well, I slip beyond my track...
My tranquility baths in thoughts...
Lone silence fulfill the view...
This space clears in peace...
The energy used behind...
Our goals, I have achieved...
My strength, within Our souls...
These acceptances will bless...
Temple Of Knowledge...
Learn in rememberance...
My proceeding desires...
Abundance of freedom...
Within, to take Our choice...
The featured periods...
Inducing with honest kind...
A vast tunnel of cheers...
Throughout the astral Horizons of Harvest...
... Tracing In Parallel Growth.
... Throughout the astral Harvest of Growth.
Peircing In Parallel Horizons...

Dense Bodies shimmering... Emergence.
Sent distant Acquaintances... Gathering.
The known Spirits... Rejoice.
Exchange the alignments with Us.
Experience salvation through Us.
Emission of well being, by Us.
... Emotive communion of youth.

Dome of stellar Dimensions...
Alpha residence times Years...
A Constellation's Lava...
In Parallax is my Wind...
The Quasar forbids my Sea...
From the Nebula... The Seeds.
By Genii Creators...
Responding to the Prophet of Evolution.
By my Care of His Care.
Understanding the Twain of the Galaxies.
By Its Heart, through my Heart.
Bringing calmness in the Flesh.
... Is One's Convention to Grow.
The Wars of the Flesh.
Against Us, We confront Others.
As We perish through Brothers.
The Sufferance conducts the Fathers.
Tyrants who breath the Fire.
The Gods of the Flesh.
But We... In unity with the Imperfection!
... Have been plenished by Love for One?
The Era of the Flesh.
Among Us We are Divine.
As We control Our righteous Spirit.
The Virgin of the Flesh.
... And We do journey towards the Affirmation!
But... Been purged by Hate for Aeons?
The Love of My Flesh.
The Growth of Your Flesh.
The Purpose of This Flesh.
The Conquest of Our Flesh.

Astral Knowledge sought after the Laws.
Beyond Motions, vibrate in the Soul.
Over Nightfalls blazes the Angel.
In Parallel Love, travels the Dawn.
