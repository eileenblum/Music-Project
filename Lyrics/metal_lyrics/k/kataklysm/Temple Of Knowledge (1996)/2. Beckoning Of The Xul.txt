[Segment II - In the midst of the Azonei's Dominion]

Misery falls.. ... Miscellaneous calls.
Echoes of the marvelous Zones.
This enmeshing den forfeits the thriving mist.
As a vector that would beckon my wishes...
Xul... Xul... Xul... Xul...
Entrance revealed...
by dreadful Golems!
Harmonize protection...
... Colossus Daemons! The Dormant must
Awaken...
... Xul! The gain, I enter...
...Obtain the passage summoned most
eagerly...
I walk the ethereal Vortex,
Beyond renascence has evoked...
A transmundane phase.
.. On the enormous Spectrum of polarity.
Anew, strengthen!
Integrated by the Signature...

Feel those... Phenomenons...

Unleashed Beasts of Foul Irra..

Perish Magick of Demon Mystik...
Aether Beings of Eclipsed Ark...
Devilish House of Majestic Ishum...
Centuries on... Revalation...
Man pronunced... And then...
The Bottoms emblazed Fire...
And reigns in it... The Flames...
Well ignited as, shadowed...
Always shunned the Signs as followed...
United with absolute malignity...
Combines this... Evil. Evil. Evils.
The Battlefield of the Great's principles.
The Rule of the Daemon's laws.
The Battlefield of the Great's principles.
The Rule of the Daemon's laws.
Archaic Emblem pertaining, to the Prism of
Blood...
Hovering the City's Threshold!
Chaotic Sentinel... The Myrmidon...
In the midst of the Azonei's Dominion...
Xul... Xul... Xul... Xul...
Nerxastul Millenxi.

Standing afloat the Forges...
In deluge, I stream...
My Sacrament, I yell...
Inferno was bestowed...
The Beasts heard me sing...
Forward, they stun...
Escape, I numb...
Across tunnels, I flee...
In between, I glide...
Emerged from outside Skies.
Eve returned... Translucence in...
Shallowed Firmament...
To Hell, I cleave...
Retorted obedience.
I... Nerxastul...
