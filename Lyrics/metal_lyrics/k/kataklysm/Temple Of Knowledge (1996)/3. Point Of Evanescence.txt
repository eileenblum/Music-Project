[Segment III - Of sheer perseverance]

A solace erupts at dusk fall of my shame.
Inhuman shade of glory.
I overwhelm the kingdoms at the surface...
The new culture inherited; fashions the high
throne...

Alone in front of the Stone!
The Tome dwells...
Along the folded Manuscript!
The Siglas immune the concealed Name.
Vannished of the plane I've bannished.
Vannished of the plane I've vannished.
Bannished of the plane I've bannished.
Bannished of the plane I've vannished.

... The dust,... The dust,
... The dust restrains from my bones onto its
ground.
The core collapses into... The length of my once
belonged living.
The lifetime shrouded after the silence of my
treeve...
The layer of the unknown Nights engulfs the sha-
pen figure of a Master.
... Mounted by ascendancy!
The infinitude that my wingspread unfolds...
... Governs my blind spheres!
Visibility enclosed!
The emptiness extends openly...
... Of sheer evanescence!
Lonely...
Lonely, I'm Immortal!
