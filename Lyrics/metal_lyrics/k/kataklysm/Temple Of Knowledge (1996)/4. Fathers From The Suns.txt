[Act I - The Occurred Barrier]

Fathers... From the Suns...
The Vault of Millenniums.
I address to the dual Keepers.
The embraced Components misdivide the solemn
prevalence.
Let be the Matrix... And sunder the inert Barrier.

Admire the universal Cosmoses... Seal the Virtues
and Secrets.
Adjure the Twillights of the Races... Proclaim the
Symbol in Men.

The wraths of influence transmitting the vibes
emitted by its
Cove...

Discover the wonders of Nations.
Thy inner cleanse in the Paradox... and triumph!

Combine the Fields of infinities... Watch the tran-
sient Fraternities.
Dissolve the Atoms in Miracles... Conjure the
Waves of realities.

The Occurred Barrier...
Oh! Fathers from the Suns.
The Crescent Stalkers.
... The Sylvanite Matrix.
The Nexus Entities....
Release the Void! Let us merge...
Revive the Nexus! Marshal dirge...
God...
Release the Void! Let us merge...
Revive the Nexus! Marshal dirge...

Limpid Questions transcribe the virility of the
Archives.

Cresent Moon shines bothways to the Answers
beyond.

The Occurred Barrier...
Oh! Fathers from the Suns.
The Crescent Stalkers.
... The Sylvanite Matrix.
The Nexus Entities...

Fathers... From the Suns...
