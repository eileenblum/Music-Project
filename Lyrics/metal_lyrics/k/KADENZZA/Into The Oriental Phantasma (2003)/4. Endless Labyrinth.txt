In dark hours still exist in mind
you swallow up me like sacrifice they need
binding my mind to a tree of fear
bonded my body takes another life
heated nectar makes it filthy
the rose stained as it will
obedience to pleasure of flesh
where is my pride
lust paralyzed me

Innocents, they rape as fire, lust in terror
red desire strikes you to the heart with their dagger
all you hope, all you love, all you wish are all I'll give
you can take everything you require
you are just chosen one, no need to fear
you ought to know I'm the one, the scarlet messiah

Unawares, extreme pain has been the ultimate pleasure
you've experienced ever bitter,
but unforgettable sweet experience
remember, remember your true spirit in the dark ages
you were crucified with crimson cross and burned alive
I can see your shroud of evil burning in cold flame
ecstasy can call you back the spirit, you're reincarnated
long time ago, you were the witch, remember ...

Kill her, she is just wicked
no longer, sinful creature, you
inject the holy spirit
deepen you into the crack of herself
take out her womb to cut into pieces
nip off the embryo
to wipe out the root of witch

Do it... bitch
no way ... death

To feel more peaceful, I wanna sleep in emptiness
as I fall into darkness, I had a dream

Chasing the light of sacred life with crawling lust at my feet
endless pain, endless fear, faithless desires
calling me into labyrinth, drifted me in the matters
let me see, let me hear, let me feel true sense of life

You die for my sin, for my lie, for my fame
I'll forgive your cursed karma
I'm the illusion, possession, oppression
you can't wake from the paranoid dream
it is reality unavoidable
owing the cross of sins to future in vain
pace your way alone

I'm never the one
behind the mask
always staring myself
in subconscious mind
someone else smiles
