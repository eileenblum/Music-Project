I die to kill
days of slaughter
giving my life for the nation
and his imperial majesty
with rising sun
the empire will come
our kingdom could have been real Elysium
to vanquish the enemy

Oh ... look back your way
to ruins and sorrows
when silence will scream

Porcelain eyed soldiers are marching on the street
mobs of leaden beast are trampling down tranquility
flocks of black flies are buzzing beyond the sky
sound of hate, air-raid sirens groan
children are running around trying to escape
when the flashing pale light dazed me
I perceive, this is the holocaust

Floating down, through the cloud
my consciousness is fading away
the edge of death I may have touched

I'm walking in a meadow of death
peaceful, crisp winds pass through my hair
I remember the feeling in my hands
the feeling of mother
your voiceless scream I cannot hear
please, please let me hear the truth

"How many children have you killed, honey?"

I survive to die
live to suffer
oh, my immortal existence
why can't you help me ?

Mental disorder
distorted laughter
wasted years to ruins of oblivion
grinning inside my brain

No place to stay with me, peace has gone

Dreamland was far
illusion is fear
the end is near
in my dream
still I can see her form dressed in black
dew glistened in her eyes has changed to blood
blasphemy ever done tortures me in my end
redeem me from my sin
release me from this hell

I can feel death is creeping
the darkness I'm walking slowly to
my mental vortex
spinning round and round
the punishment for my sin
I'm longing, longing to sleep forever ...
