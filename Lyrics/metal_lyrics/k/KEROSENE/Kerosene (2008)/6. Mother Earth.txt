Madness, destruction, itâs all I see around
Hopeless surrender, people dying on the ground

Too much confusion is growing in my head
Got no solution, evil draws his plan againâ¦

I canât find a reason
Violence and hate theyâre just crushing me
A wicked human instinct
Who will change our mother earth destiny?

Look in the mirror and tell me what you see
Soul desolation, a deafening silenceâs killing me

Pictures of smoke and fire, industries of death and pain
Always ready for a war, distorting our brains
