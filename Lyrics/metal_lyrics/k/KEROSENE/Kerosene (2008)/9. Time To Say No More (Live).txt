Who thinks Iâll change my mind?
For sure it canât be you
Who thinks I wonât survive in this world that seems so cruel?

But you think Iâm not the same for what I use to do
You think that Iâll get lost; Iâll prove that wonât be true!

Iâll never get caught in your rules
Youâll never see my blood on the floor
What would you say if I walk away?
Itâs time for me to say âNo moreâ!!!

This world just wants you to, to sacrifice your life
Itâs only pain and pride, so many tears and cries

You claim itâs just a sign of my mediocrity
But Iâll never feel ashamed! Iâll never pay that price!
