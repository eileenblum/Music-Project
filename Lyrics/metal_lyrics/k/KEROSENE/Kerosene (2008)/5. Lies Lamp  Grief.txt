You make âem so envious
Theyâre always so stuck on you
Youâre the shiver that runs up their spine
You make âem feel so alive

But something has changed
Something will never be the same

You got that perfect style
Not afraid to speak your mind
You got fire runninâ through your veins
Fearless, you say âNo pain â no gainâ

Something has changed
Something will never be the same

You got your brain, thereâs no one to blame
Fuck all those words that drive you insane
You got your dreams, donât need lies and greed
They just try to be what they will never be

Theyâre always so afraid to fail
Wish they got half of your pluck
They just want to pull you down
But they donât know youâll never hit the ground

Something has changed
Something will never be the same

You got your brain, thereâs no one to blame
Fuck all those words that drive you insane
You got your dreams, donât need lies and greed
They just try to be what they will never be
