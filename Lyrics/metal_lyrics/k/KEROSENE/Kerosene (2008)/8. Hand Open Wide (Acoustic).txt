Do you remember when I saw you staring at the moon?
Do you recall those nights when you shared your secrets with the stars?

So sick and tired you can barely stand on your feet
Shadows behind your eyes
Donât be afraid my hand is open wide

Are you feeling fine?
Please tell me is everything all right?
So donât waste your time
Tell me is everything all right?

Here you sit alone the rain keeps pouring down
Donât wait for that day to come
Donât be afraid my hand is open wide

Are you feeling fine?
Please tell me is everything all right?
Donât throw your life away
Tell me is everything all right?

How do you feel?
How do you feel?
Please tell me honey... how do you feel?
