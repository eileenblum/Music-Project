A strange sensation
Timeâs moving along too fast
Getting a mad reaction, ready to explode!

Drowning in my nightmares,
Memories of all my fears
Lost in the sea of my unconsciousness, wondering what is real

Feeling so defeated
Suffocated by all that I left behind
Nothing seems to satisfy
Hiding from all my frustrations

Labeled a monster
Or crowned like a king
Thereâs always so much to bear
Just like a thousand thorns in the flank

Feeling so defeated
Suffocated by all that I left behind
Nothing seems to satisfy
Hiding from all my frustrations
