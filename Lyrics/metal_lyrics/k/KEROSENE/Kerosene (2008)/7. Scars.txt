I never wanted to be thrown away
Iâm not a victim 'til I let you take me down
I canât crawl thorough the flames that eat my flesh
Itâs not just a game, I need to fight, fight to stay alive

I never say forever âcause foreverâs a lie
I can see right through you and I canât ignore you
Everything youâve done is crushing everyone
Push me into darkness, but I will never be afraid

I wonât be afraid

Now you think Iâve reached the end, but you donât know Iâm made of scars
You wonât erase what I am
Now you think Iâve reached the end, but you donât know Iâm made of scars
You wonât erase what I am

Prophets of lost souls wanna guide me towards the light
I know whatâs wrong and I know what itâs right
You think Iâm a fool, but I donât even care
I never asked for anything, Iâm not asking now
Iâll never be afraid

I wonât be afraid

Now you think Iâve reached the end, but you donât know Iâm made of scars
You wonât erase what I am
Now you think Iâve reached the end, but you donât know Iâm made of scars
You wonât erase what I am
