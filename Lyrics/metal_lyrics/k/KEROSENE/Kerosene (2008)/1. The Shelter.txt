Watching you in your secret room
Diving in your hypocrisy
So enslaved by your dirty soul
Stealing lives, your main priority

Gentle smile, demonâs eyes
You keep crawling under my skin
You made me blind, you made me numb
Here comes a time, a new begin

Come out from your shelter
Face the truth and world outside
Voices of temptation
Look out, youâll get swept away

Feed yourself with blood and snakes
You live a one way cold existence
So enslaved by your dirty hands
Iâll never get fooled again

Now I know you!
I wonât play your game!
Oh no!!!
