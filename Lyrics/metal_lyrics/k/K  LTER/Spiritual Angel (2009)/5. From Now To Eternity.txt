Laying down on the dead leaves of fall
My eyelids, shut and sheltered from the cold wind
Slowly sinking into my deepest memories
I whisper these words to the silent night sky

From now to eternity I swear, my Sacred Angel
Iâll remember this moment for ever, so please
Hear my prayers and shine one more time
Before dawn takes you away from my eyes

From Now to Eternity 

I've travelled from dream to dream
With the hope of finding you once again
Angel of my thoughts, only light of my nights
Are you alive? If not, I shall die for you!

Donât leave me alone in this cruel world
Where darkness and nightmares prevail
Will you take me away with you?
Beyond the universe and even farther

Shouting through the moonlit sky
Madness has overtaken my mind
So near, I could almost feel your warm light
So far, the morning devoured my last hopes

The last minutes go by so fast
And the night is already dying
A sunbeam drills the remaining clouds
Pulling me out of this painful dream

I feel the darkness invading my core
And only you, can enlight my soul
So from now to eternity, I swear
I will wait for you until the end of time!
