The waves of the sea are so calm
And the morning breeze is so fresh
Staring to the infinite sky as I cry
For the last time

Should I die or wait?
Should I live and forget?
My past, my life, my dreamsâ¦

I see my life passing before my eyes
As the end waits for me to fall
But, Iâm still waiting for the answers
To the questions bleeding through me

Waiting on the waterfall
With my shadow by my side
The wind whispering in my ears
The chilling words of fatality

May the death be lenient with my soul
As I slowly come closer to the edgeâ¦

Staring to the infinite sky as I cry
For the last time, tears of melancholy

I canât linger anymore
Now I know what truth is
The angel must leave me alone

So I close my eyes and let myself sink
In cryptic memories, still unknown but
The elements are suddenly unleashed

Feeling the furious storm as I shout
For the last time, words of hope

This is it, free of spirit and heart
Floating in the eternal restâ¦

Admiring emptiness as I whisper
For the last time, songs of bliss
