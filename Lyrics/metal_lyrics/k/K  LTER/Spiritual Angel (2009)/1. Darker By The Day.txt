The sky is getting darker as the day goes by	
The sunâs now nothing but a distant memory
Every second of my existence seems so long
And each breath brings me closer to insanity

A winged creature slowly burns my delight
Tell me who you are, Billowing Wraith? 
Youâre ruining my life, and controlling my mind
Let me be myself one more time

The sound of beating wings slicing the night
Slowly pushing me into the endless pit
Too many shuddery thoughts can slay a man
Will this be my fate?

Fleeing in the sacred woods for the divine waterfall
Where my ancestors gathered to find inner peace
The final key to the eternal paradise

The droplets of water falling one by one
Striking each time the eroded stones
The soothing music of the natural world
Slowly, takes me back to the truth

Listen to the sustained beat rising in the night
Hear the depressing melody of misery
Oh my love, donât put the blame on you
However, I must run away 

Sorrow has shattered all traces of joy
But the night will cure my spirit
