Too many stories have already been told
With too much morality, boredom controls
But the Spiritual Angel will always remain
Through time and spirit, hovering mankind

The Spiritual Angel slowly vanishes in the dusk
Regretting the acts committed in the name of lust
Flying through darkness, deep in the night
With the moon and the stars in silence heâll wait
For a single sight of a soulâs weakness
In the shadow heâll waitâ¦

Hear the hypocrisy above the whispers
Telling us everything about humanity
People of weak minds and subjected to voices 
Let them believe in the forbidden words of

Spiritual Angel

In ignorance forever, men chose to stay
The heritage of society will remain unknown
Believing in words inflicted by gods
Why do they warrant so much suffering?
