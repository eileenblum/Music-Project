Flames	
Despair
The end is near!

Sinister visions emerge in my dreams
Has disaster occurred on my tribe?

Secluded foreigner of obscurity,
Unearth thy past before death does soâ¦

Echoes of voices through the storm
Awaken me from an obscure nightmare

Honor thy name in the moonless night
Before sunbeams reveal the endâ¦

Time flies away as I fly through the night
From dreams to nightmares, will I find the light?
Needless to say, the end of your life is in sight

Seek for truth in the time out of mind
The distant past beyond memory

A crimson sun rises at dawn
While fury rises in my heart
Climbing to the apex of the fall
Well, the tragedy takes my breath away

Standing on the edge of the infinite cliff
Watching the fire flaring up
Whispering my last goodbye
Warm tears falling as I cry

Whispering my last goodbye
Warm tears falling as I cry
