Glittering on the skyline, the sun began to rise
Raging in its glory, illuminating the world

All I could see, was despair and bitterness
Well, what struck me this time was loneliness
Through all these years of agony and suffering
I've seen the beauty of Paradise, and horrors of Hell
But yesterday, oh, a most miserable and cold day
Fire and wrath took your souls away

All this pain bleeds from your last words
They went through my flesh like a burning arrow
Leaving no place to hide to my frozen heart
My blood gushes out and my tears run dry

Crying into a dark pool of water and blood
Unanswered questions appear from nowhere
Hearing the wind whispering sadness
How will I live without you by my side?

Condemned to wander in eternity
Shrouded by regret and remorse

Forever the prisoner of my pitiful fate
Death will be the ultimate price to pay

Sacred Angel please forgive me
Trap in your prison of flesh
Listening, watching the dazzling sun
Waiting for an answer that will never come

I should have sacrificed my life to save yours
But cowardice was my demise
How can I ever redeem myself?
Please forgive me, my Sacred Angel
