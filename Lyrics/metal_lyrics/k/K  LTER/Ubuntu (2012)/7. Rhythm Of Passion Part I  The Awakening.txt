The rain smashes my frozen face, waking me up from this mysterious night. 
The sound of thunder makes me shiver and the power of wind scatters my mind. 
The landscape is crumbling before my eyes, blowing clouds of dust, so far away. 
I feel so weak against this force so powerful and dreadful. 
Everything is falling into ruins. 
Iâm scared and I cannot move. 
Should I run away, can I defend my life? 
Only my bravery is going to choose my final way... 

Where the trees fall 
and the leaves are blown away. 

I rush forward through the lost paths leaving my fear behind me. 
When my grief gives way to hope, I break the chains and I fly away. 
Rhythm of passion masks my sorrows and veils my sadness. 
All that I want is to be alive when the storm passes. 

Rhythm of passion pushes my mind ahead. 
All that I want is to be free ! 

This world is so disrupted. 
Does this make any sense ? 
An endless fight between day and night. 
The freedom of the mind, 
a matter of your choice. 
This choice that will remain untouchable. 

I'm spinning like an endless cycle, 
struggling to find back the Earth's equilibrium 
Should I drop my attachments 
from this dream like reality ? 
Vice pulls us away from our own goal. 

In this storm I remain strong and confident, 
letting out of me only who I really am. 

Where the trees fall 
and the leaves are blown away. 

I rush forward through the lost paths leaving my fear behind me. 
When my grief gives way to hope, I break the chains and I fly away. 
Rhythm of passion masks my sorrows and veils my sadness. 
All that I want is to be alive when the storm passes. 

Rhythm of passion pushes my mind ahead. 
All that I want is to be free ! 

Fear is getting away, giving me the opportunity to fly. 
I feel my wings are finally unfolding under the sun. 
I now realize how strong I really am. 
From now to eternity, I will never be the same.
