Hords of oppression are rising 
One way to break free, together 
We stand in front of the enemy, 
Inflexible, we will never fall 

Cycle of metamorphosis, the pendulum effect, 
Evolution* of life trough consciousness and energy 

Onerous footsteps striking the earth 
The march evolves with intensity, 
Forces of the unseen 
Converging energy, becoming one 

The earth trembles in harmony 
Frequencies blend and combine 

Members of the tribe, time has now come to defend what we live for. 
Our freedom. 
Members of the tribe, time has now come to unite our energy 

They are coming to take the land from us, 
breaking the perfect cycle we are into. 
No one will ever control the way we think, the way we live, the way we are 
We are unbreakable 
Letâs create the future we dream of. 

We are now erupting from the volcano of light 
A burning river protecting the tribe 

Battle rages 
Storm blows 
Fire burns 
Thunder 
Earthquake
