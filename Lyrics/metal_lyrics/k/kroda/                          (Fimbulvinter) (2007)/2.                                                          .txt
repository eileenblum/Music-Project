Ye hear?... As Wolves, Winds raised Howl
There, in Nocturnal Height?
With Black Wing, Raven embrace the Skies
Veiling the Firmament worn in Garment of Stars

Ye hear?...
Through the Wind Howl with Hooves Beats
The Icecovered Pulsing Expanse is scourged
By Horses of Glacial Riders of Fimbulvinter

Above Mountains and Woods - by Clouds they are
As a Falcons of Snowfall
Above Steppes and Mounds - 
By the Stars burning High

Above Mountains and Woods - by Clouds they are
As a Falcons of Snowfall
Above Steppes and Mounds - 
By the Stars burning High

Ye hear?...As Wolves, Winds raised Howl
From Everywhere they Strive Forth
They Soar, by Storms they are followed
By Glacial Riders of Fimbulvinter

They Rush! And nowhere to hide
From the Hoarfrost Swords!
They Screech! And by Echo that Yell is to roll
By Resound of Their Hammers of Ice!

Above Mountains and Woods - by Clouds they are
As a Falcons of Snowfall
Above Steppes and Mounds - 
By the Stars burning High

Above Mountains and Woods - by Clouds they are
As a Falcons of Snowfall
Above Steppes and Mounds - 
By the Stars burning High

Shalt ingnaw in SJEL with Icecold Fangs
Shalt predatory quench the Bloodthirst from the Heart
Northern Wolfpacks heralding with Fear
Forestalling the Riders...

Above Mountains and Woods - by Clouds they are
As a Falcons of Snowfall
Above Steppes and Mounds - 
By the Stars burning High
