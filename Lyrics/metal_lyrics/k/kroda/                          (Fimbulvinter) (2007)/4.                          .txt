Coldness Bestial Vortex raging Inside Every Creature...

Dance of Ravens in Leaden-Grey Skies - 
Starless, immense...
With Their Feather like by Knives
That Vault is ruptured... At last...
At last, the Black Winds
Cast down Their Storm upon
Boundless Wastelands
By Wolves They murdered the
Breath of Life
In Themselves - at last...

Winds of Grief as Phantoms are
Covered with Gloom all Peaks of Mountains
Among the Veil of Night
At last, the Funeral Pyre was flaming
Souls exhausted by Icewinds
Hovering above Land at last
Creeping by Gallow Forests
To the Funeral of the Sun

Lonesome Smog spreaded forth
Furiously howling like a Wolf
Above the Storming Sea
Of Ice Thorns

Dance of Two Ravens in Leaden-Grey Skies - 
Huginn and Muninn
With Their Feather like by Knives
That Vault is ruptured... At last...
At last, the Black Winds
Cast down Their Storm upon Boundless Expanse
By Wolves They murdered the Breath of Life
Geri and Freki

Winds of Grief as Phantoms are
Covered with Gloom all Peaks of Mountains
Among the Veil of Night
At last, the Funeral Pyre was flaming
Souls exhausted by Icewinds
Hovering above Land at last
Creeping by Gallow Forests
To the Funeral of the Sun
