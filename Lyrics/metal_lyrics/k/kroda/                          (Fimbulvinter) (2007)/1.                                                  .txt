With Paroxysmal Breath to inhale
An Icecold Winter Air
And then be strangled...
While swallowed the Edge of Glacial Spears...

And Roaring to penetrate the Night
Devastate the whole Wasteland
By Echo to roll the Forest
By Arrow to flash in One Moment

Let the Ice Steel reflect
The Sparkling Snow...
Frozen is Distance Far - 
Unveiled and Vulnerable - to All the Sides

... I Am The Beginning of Winter Night!
I Am Snow that razor the Eyes!
I Am the Frost Blade of Fierce Winter!
I measure the Space with Abyss Wings!
I Am The Beginning of Northern Night of Oskorei!
I Am Freezing Snow that razor Thy Eyes!
I Am ISKALD KVASS of Fierce Winter!
I lacerate the Space with GINNUNGAGAP Fangs!

Through the Hazy Vastlands
As a Transparent Ray
By Snowstorm I ride
With a Cold Flame
I Blight All
That fell into Furrow
I Scorch All
With Flame of Coldness

... I Am The Beginning of Winter Night!
I Am Snow that razor the Eyes!
I Am the Frost Blade of Fierce Winter!
I measure the Space with Abyss Wings!
I Am The Beginning of Northern Night of Oskorei!
I Am Freezing Snow that razor Thy Eyes!
I Am ISKALD KVASS of Fierce Winter!
I lacerate the Space with GINNUNGAGAP Fangs!

Through the Misty Grey Distance
As a Crystal Ray
By Sharp Arrow Edge
As an Oskorei Flame
I Raze All
With Frozen Steel
I Sweep All
With Threatening Cudgel of Thorns

I shalt Yawn with Winds and Blizzards
I shalt Rage with Squalls and Snowstorms
With Ices shalt cover every Pond and Lake
Shalt bind them with Glacial Chains

I shalt Gape with Winds and Tempests
I shalt Rage with Blizzards and Winterstorms
In Woods - I shall lay wide with Snows
Shalt pass Rivers and Steppes with Hoarfrosts

... That Is The Beginning Of Fierce, Freezing, Wild Winter Night Of Oskorei!...
