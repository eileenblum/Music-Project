...Where silver-firs spears piercing the sky
That impending so low, so grim,
At days when autumn turns into winter
Transcending the mountains air by snow...

A shroud to cover the surface of moss,
That shelf down by solitary traces,
Entangled in blackened dragons ornament...
Schwarzpfad creeping forth...

I am suffocated by purest air,
Glacial cold like Ice...
My mind is falling into dark Abyss,
Followed by the very Reality fall.

Soul beats like a bird, strive for freedom...
Fly high!
Longing for this moment to be caught in stillness...
And remain among that Pantheon forever.

Roaming that land in hopelessness,
Obtain the Faith feeding flesh by a heat...
Beneath the sky so begrimed, blood is freezing
In veins... Only Abyss gape black...

- I remind how you did swagger about your faith...
So well, do you still keep it?!
