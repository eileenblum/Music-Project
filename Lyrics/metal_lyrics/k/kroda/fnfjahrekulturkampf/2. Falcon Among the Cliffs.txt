By Bloodâ¦
By the Hot Blood â
To bewitch the Flames
Of Fireâ¦
Kroda exalt the sparkles of Pyre
Towards Celestial Heights,
Where they dwell at that moment,
Transfigured into Falconâ¦
In flight above the Crags
They reached the Firmament Vaults â
And by the fading ashes
They die among the cliffsâ¦
Only the yell of Falcon
Lost among the Cliffsâ¦
And rustle of His Wings
Calmed down among that Cliffsâ¦
