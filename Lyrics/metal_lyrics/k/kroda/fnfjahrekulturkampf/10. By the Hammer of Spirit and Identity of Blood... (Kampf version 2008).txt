What is not like in Ancient times now â
Why all is sorrowful and begrimed?..
Why the Ancestral Wisdom lost;
Why the Blood Brotherhood forgotten is?..

Alas, all the Truth was gone,
Truth was gone and the false arose!..
Clouds are gathered, covered the Sky,
Ghastly impending over woods and fieldsâ¦

With the stellar eyes, from the Firmament
Forefathers still gaze and wondering:
Folk of Rusâ is in deathlike slumber,
Sleeping they donât see the cruel grief!

Mounds and Cromlechs â devastate are;
Cut down are Our Sacred Groves;
Tales forgotten are, and the Runes are lost;
Forbidden are Swords and Solar Signsâ¦

Dead Rivers are flowing like a tears
And the Land is desolate like a scorched ground;
All doors and windows in huts closed are â
All the bolts and bars are locked upâ¦

Only in the Forge someone still hammering,
Of the Blood Identity forging the Spiritsteelâ¦
Dawn is coming forth â Rusâ reawakes!
Hammer of Spirit beating incessantâ¦

Identity of Blood shalt unite again
Our Warriors with a Bonds of Oath;
Thatâs why Forger didnât sleep in evil night â
With Thunders He sworn than Folk shalt arise!!!
