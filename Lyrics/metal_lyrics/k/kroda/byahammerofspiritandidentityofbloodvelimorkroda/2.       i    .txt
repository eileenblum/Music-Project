["The Arrow" lyrics by famous Ukrainian poet Vasil Bobinsky. Translation by Waldemar and Eisenslav.]

Throw on from tight and bended bow,
Arrows that are forget by Fiery Loki -
To the black gloom ringing they are soar,
Alarming the black night with a sonor.
Pale forehead is marked by thought of pride:
In infinity, the Fate is concealed somewhere!
Gleam of flames caressing mighty towers,
Gleam of flames upon the helmet vault.
Invincible sister of Valkyries!
Why this arrow led it's path astray,
Why it reached the distance where I dwell?
For I am a lonely minnesinger,
Not a hero, winner of the Lindwurm!
I am just a harp - but not a trumpet.

To where it hidden, priceless gift of thine -
Aureate sharp-edged winged arrival?
Vast is Midgard. Still to vandring skald
Is not licit to accept advices.
Alas, heim expanse! Cause thy temple is narrow
For brightly burning flames of gilded arrows!
Another firmament in my heart be created,
To guard the precious treasure be ordained.
And by marvelous pathways yet I wander,
To Midgard plains I go like I sail,
I bring the songs ornamented by tales,
My hands are full of neverending wonders.
And by marvelous pathways yet I wander,
To Midgard plains I go like I sail,
I touch the harpstrings with my skilled fingers -
And like a grins of bowstrings they are ringing.

Hey, I bring forth songs and fairytales,
Hey, I roam from one hut to another.
But my Kvasirblod enwinged words are dying
With a joyless passing of my days.
Somewhere on the bottom of grim cave
Kingly halls are, dragon-procreated.
And that cursed realm through many aeons
Enstrangling the tales and songs of man.

Time shalt come. Harp be restrained to bow,
And the arrow from my heart be torn out,
Golden tune of arrowflight shalt hover!
With a rumble and agony wild roar,
Onto cliff that is covered with bones,
Dead defeated serpent shalt fall down!
