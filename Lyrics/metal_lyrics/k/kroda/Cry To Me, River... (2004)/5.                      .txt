Fatherland, in all the world only one ... Free, Mighty, Great, AncientFrom forefathers  Ancestors inherit it wasTo the descendants ... heirs Slavonic Land given to usBy the Fathers ... Gods Sea and rivers, lakes and ponds, Oaken woods and immense steppes, Blue skies and bright sun, Shimmering stars, their sorrowful light It imbued throughout by The Slavonic Spirit and Blood ... Guard thy Native Land, Like a mother, ...tis only one! Remind thy glorious Ancestors that died, Those warriors that defended this Land With sword in hand! By all my heartI greet all the Great Heroes Who sacrificed their life In the name of Native Land Their memory lives eternally! Glory to Heroes! Glorious be, my Native Land! Carpathian Mountains covered by mighty forests And by the foggy wood paths, Singing of birds and silence of nights ... I shalt remember all this ...til I die! Like a tear, moon glare is clear, Burial mounds, Dnipro, and rapids thundering, Thou art adorned by the flowers and rain...Glorious be, Native Land!
