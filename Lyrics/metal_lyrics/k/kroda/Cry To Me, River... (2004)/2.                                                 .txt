Autumn ...Engraving in leaves the veins galdrastafr, Shalt paint in crimson, - not sparing the golden glare...Autumn...Shalt cover in fog, hiding the mud slush, And be drowned in cold drops of rainWinter...Howling, it shalt bring the fury of blizzards, Winds haughty storming as beasts...Winter...Shalt cloach in ice, strewing by hoarfrost, Concealing the leaves runearcanes in snow...Spring...Shalt furtively force it...s way by the green of first grass, Flowing the stream of molten snow, Reading the epistle of winter...Spring, it shall comprehend all that was hidden, All that was left on the darkened leaves, Then shalt describe it by the pattern of sprouts...Summer...Shalt cover by leaves, bury under the trees crowns, And carry on...Summer...With farewell it shalt tell, shalt whisper by winds,  And sing to the autumnal mists...
