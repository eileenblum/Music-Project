Cry To Me, River, Tell me about the days of ancient times, About what thou saw long time ago Tell by the whispering of thy drops Bring by the waves to Nothingness Resounds of battles where one raised his sword Against his brother In murmur of tide voices are heard:...Betrayal!... Who dishonored his Ancestors names? Who destroyed our Ancient Faith? Who gave the Slavonic Land Into enemies... clutch?...volodymir!......Miserable descendant of the Great Knjaz, worthless son of Svjatoslav, fratricide, apostate of Faith, Named ...saint... for his betrayal!...Who built the churches Upon our Sacral Ground? That herd trembled of fear, When Knjaz Svjatoslav nailed His shield To the Constantinopolis gates!
