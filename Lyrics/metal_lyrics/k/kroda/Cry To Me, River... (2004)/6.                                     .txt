The hearse cloth weaved of rain Is coldening by mist of twilight By the grey grim shroud It shall flow from the skies Grandeur of clouds started to rush Tearing out to the fragments Deadly struck down into the ground Gnarled Cudgels of Thunder Unstoppable rage of lightning Flashed by the cold shine By the silver axe fiercely Cleaving the expanse of air Gnarled Cudgels of Thunder Broke, crushed into pieces The crucifixion above the Ancient Heathen Sanctuary, -Leaving the ashes only...Shame of dust be washed away by rain From the bloody scars of Land That was struck! Struck! Struck! By the Gnarled Cudgels of ThunderBut yet the rain tears can't wash out The disgrace of christian domination And years of pain wouldn't be crushed By the Perun's Gnarled Cudgels!
