Soundless grey of the thunderstorm clouds, Reflecting in mirror of swamp, Gifted the splashes of heatlightnings to Earth, Enraptured by the silence of forestGusts of the wind penetrated to where Only the leaves falling was rustling Halls of moss were scalded by sorrow In quiet swamps desolation Breaking the silence ... thunder was roar Acclaiming the storm arrival Standing benumbed, the wood became dumb, Awaiting the first raindrop ringing...With a rumble of hundreds of thousands stonesThe water momentary started to flow forth... Bursting with storming blizzard, Wind crushed the secular oblivion Gushing in torrents, the downpour fell, Sweeping away the bliss of calm Storming was roaring, howling wild, Burying the former unhurriness...Where are roots now? Where are crowns of trees? Their web pattern is everywhere now Where the peace and calm were immortalized ...Only chaos, ruins and devastation remained...
