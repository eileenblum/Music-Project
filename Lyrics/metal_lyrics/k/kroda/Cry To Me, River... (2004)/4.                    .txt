In the rays of rising Sun The veil of ice is reddenIt strewed and chained by coldness And weaved on the web of dreams Hoarfrost of Blood is glimmering, sparkling, It melts, scattering by crimson ashes By the bloody scabs it clotting, Blackening, growing dim, disappearing in dust How much blood was shed upon this land, That snow became of the dawn color? Forefathers returned to heirs the Heroes Blood For they arise ... the Defenders Hordes!... (Elders) gave a sign to stand in ranks, to Sharpen the swords, preparing for fight For the snowstorms of gore bury the enemies, For the rivers be filled with blood of the foes! It's time for banners to sing on the wind now, Time for standarts to inhale the Freedom It's time for the Aryan Spirit to rise, To fill the veins with Hoarfrost of Blood! Let fury make hands to grasp in fists And wolfish roar shall seethe in throat Strike by strike ... our foes shall fall Step by step ... we shall cleanse the battlefield!
