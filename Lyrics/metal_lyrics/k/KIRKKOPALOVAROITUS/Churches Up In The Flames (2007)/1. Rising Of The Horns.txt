Infinite degrees of separation
from the world of living humans.
Cruel lie the shadows here
created by the arsonist mind.

For the rising of the horns
in the flames of the burning church.
For the rising of the horns
in the darkness of the winter's heart.

Can you see the smoke of the funerals rising?
Can you smell the stench of the burning corpses?
If only they were from the living flesh
of the believers in all the falsehoods...

Infinite degrees of damnation
in this world of immoral humans.
Rising above and beyond the will
of the folly of despicable religion.
