How this life always seems to fade away
to the deep places in the dark.
Only cunning minds might comprehend
why this is and must be so?

Ardor frigesscit, nitor squalescit,
amor abolescit, lux obtenebrescit.

I will see the stars falling down
from the joyously bright blue sunny sky.
And the clouds that gather are but faint traces of my sorrow, of my pain

Ardor frigesscit, nitor squalescit,
amor abolescit, lux obtenebrescit.

Sing unto the night that seeth no dawn
No longer dreaming of things to come
Sing unto the night that seeth no dawn
Never dreaming of a light of salvation
