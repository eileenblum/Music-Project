The blade of self-deception is crushed
A rotten cross is stroked down (to hell)
Parables of emotional falsehoods
Putrefy in their outright impossibility

Parasatan! An ecstatic, cruel, but clear vision
Remorseless passive acceptance of reality
Parasatan! Ratified by the insane morality
Genocidal maniacs of that passionate scorn

Rip the wounds open, fall to the waters
Emerge from the black womb of death
Victorious and without a tarnish
Only the inner daemon may survive
