The throne that gleams in the horizon
Is the throne of my master Satan
The eye that beholds from the depths
Is the eye of my master Satan

The hand that strikes down humanity
Is the hand of my master Satan
The unholy trinity in the abyss
Throne, eye and hand, across the land

A perfect vision in every way
As the flames reach heaven's shore
The vision is perfected once again
Smite down the believers
