A void that has been so long inside of me
Butchering the last strain of humanity
Will you give me release from the pain?
Will you at last set my strangled being free?

I cannot begin to tell of the pain there is
I can never render the ineffable cold void
Into words that a human being can understand
For I never was human, though I once lived

Ineffable cold void, beauty in darkness
A peace beyond the stars and beyond time
The last fading picture of the universe
When no light nor any life can exist

Ineffable cold void, for the dark soul to devour
There is a lifeless void inside, and beyond
A future denied, a past so soon forgotten
For I never was human, I never really lived
