The blaze in the northern sky our dream
So long ago forfeited by the loveless world
Unsanctioned by humanity, yet so very real
The dead trees are dancing in our hearts

It's the dawn of the total human holocaust
A lifeless wish against the depraved world
It's the dawn of the total human holocaust
A dreamless sleep; a wish to the northern sky

The brotherhood of the black blossoms of doom
Standing alone for a nihilistic endless gloom
Another holocaust beckoning for doom so soon
As the black fucking metal visions here loom
