Inner daemons that burn the churches of the mind
A wailing banshee of a corrupted ancient horde

The realization of stagnation created by the blind
Bowing down before a castrated weak failed lord

The torches have only just been lit
The faint-hearted have only just joined the mob
In your mind another church must be lit
By the hellfire wherein daemonic hearts throb

Daemonic hordes that rise beyond the earth
The crown of destruction lives within us
Daemonic hordes that blaze beneath the world
The crown of destruction is us, lords of hell

Ruins within are us when the daemons are gone
Only fear and destruction remains in the world
Cruelly bereft of the fantasy within our minds
The demonic hordes, when they will ride.
