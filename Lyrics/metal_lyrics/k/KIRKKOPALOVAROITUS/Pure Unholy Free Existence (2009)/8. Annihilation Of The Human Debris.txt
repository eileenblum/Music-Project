As some words are come inspired, some are from the past
A sought after knowledge of what he might say
If he had the view from nothingness, from the void
What would he see, and what would he say?

Annihilation of the human debris
The extinction of this failed mankind
Downtrodden sickness amongst the people
Who never wanted heroes, only death

If there was life beyond death, only ash remains
If there was hate beyond life, only dust remains
A long damnation of the self, and of philosophy
That has never grown a decent human being

A road that was strewn with crucified ones
A heaven that bled with the rotten ones above
Created lords that never really existed
As also the nihilistic followers of nothingness
