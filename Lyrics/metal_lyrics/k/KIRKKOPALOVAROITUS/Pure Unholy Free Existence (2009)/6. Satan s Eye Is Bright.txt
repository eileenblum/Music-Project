I beheld the eye in the darkness
In the darkness and the cold
I heard the voice from darkness
Of evil and of the cold

Ruined dreams, loveless world exists
Accept the downfall of all humanity
Satan's eye is bright in my mind
A loveless sickness eternal

A soul burning so very bright
In the end of all insanity
I beheld you die, I laughed at you
You never lived, I never lived

Satan's eye is bright, in this reality
It burns our hearts into blackened coal
A black metal dream, a future benighted
Why do they live, they are dead inside
