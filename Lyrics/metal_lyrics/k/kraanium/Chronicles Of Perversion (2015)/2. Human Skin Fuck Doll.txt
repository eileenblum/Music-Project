Stuffed animals bore me wanna try something
new think I'll try on some humans beginning with
you cloth dipped in chloroform drug you
down waking up naked with hands and feet
bound slit your throat now I'll watch you die
y-shaped incision after I've bled you dry removing
all your internal organs licking and caressing 
while I masturbate applying your body with 
formaldehyde from this skin suit a sex goddess
I'll create skeleton strengthened with copper
wire limbs now easier to articulate skin stitched
together with filled with styrofoam now mine forever
to desecrate taxidermia taken to a new level not
only for display but aso for pleasure my sexual
desires have no boundaries even after death I'll 
have your body to treasure necrophilia and
taxidermia now combined my lust for dead flesh 
forever entwined cloth dipped in chloroform 
drug you down waking up naked with hands and
feet bound slit your throat now I'll watch you die
y-shaped incision after I've bled you dry
