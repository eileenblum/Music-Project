I am an architect 
An architect of the perverse
I kidnap filthy whores 
And purify them through torture
Then I dismember their ravaged bodies 
To make the perfect master piece  
I am an architect 
An architect of the perverse
I kidnap filthy whores 
And purify them through torture
Head chopped off with a sword
Then I fuck her neck with my throbbing cock
Later I will sodomize 
Your headless and bleeding corpse
The pain you endure is my salvation
I will be resurrected through your death
I am the messiah
Of eternal suffering
Arms and legs is separated from the torso
To be used in this repulsive sculpture
And stand as a monument of perversion
A testament to your final suffering
Head chopped off with a sword
Then I fuck her neck with my throbbing cock
Later I will sodomize 
Your headless and bleeding corpse
Dead bodies ripped apart
Dead bodies as my art
Ripped apart
