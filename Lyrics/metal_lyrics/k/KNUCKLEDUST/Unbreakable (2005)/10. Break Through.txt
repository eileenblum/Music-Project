In this world we live in
Where lost souls die
Iâve never been one to sit back and wollow in the pain
Cause I believe that better days are not far away
One day a time will come when Iâll put right all
These fucking wrongs

One day our way
Weâll find a way to get through
No pain no tears
Our strength will see us there

This raging anger from a place down deep inside
Burning all the fears that Iâve held burning down
These walls of misery

This raging anger from a place that time forgot
My time is now, my time is here, my time to fight back
