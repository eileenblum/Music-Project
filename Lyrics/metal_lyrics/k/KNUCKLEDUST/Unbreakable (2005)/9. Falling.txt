Taxed for the work we do
To finance innocentsâ extinction
Attacked for staying true
Donât want part of your plansâ completion

No respect for hardworking youths
No respect, just lies and hidden truths

Go on with your ways
Just stay away
Cos soon itâs yourself that youâll slay

One day my time will come
And I was not taught to run

One day my time will come
Death or glory I wonât run
One day my time will come
I wonât forget where I come from

Iâve spilled out my heart
Time and again in many songs
Still found no heaven
Nowhere to belong
Tony Blairâs kind will never understand
Like disease they spread
How many innocents have already gone
The list of those dead already too long

Theyâre wrong. Wrong!

Power control
Theyâre greedy and still try deceive my
Doesnât matter who you vote for
Itâs always the same old story
Weâve all done wrong when the fallout comes
Weâll burn for what we did not do

Take the food from my mouth
To pay for wars
Futile in their reason
