Overcoming this murder of my mind
Drain my soul more with each time
The greedy and the fake are not of our kind
Canât mash us down when they crossed lines

For the little we have we hold tight hold strong
Try tear my faith from out of my heart

No more pain no more suffering ever again
No more pain a level of no suffering

Canât step forward
And thereâs nowhere to step back
Weâre stuck in this rut that nothing can cut

For the life of our friends I wonât betray
I vowed this before and Iâll vow this again

I worked my fingers to the bone for this
Now all that I have are these two clenched fists
