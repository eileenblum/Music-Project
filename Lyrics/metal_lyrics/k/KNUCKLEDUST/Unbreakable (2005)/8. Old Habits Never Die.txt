Canât see a positive view
Through these negative eyes
Am I chasing a dream that just doesnât exist?
Thereâs a fire burning deep inside
With a will to live and a will to die
Everytime I ask the question why, I look to the sky
For a god that never answers
Iâm sick, Iâm tired of this shit, Iâll deal with it right now

Our time is now
Iâll make my own choices
Our time is now
Always looking forward

I lost faith in all I hoped for
Dreams were slammed shut
With every opened door
Iâll take time, collect my thoughts
Erase my mind, choose the next step
When opportuniy knocks
You think itâs knocking for us?
We work hard for all this shit you see
Represent for the cause of day one
No ambition, only personal gain

Never accepted
No future
We see through it all
Do it our own way
