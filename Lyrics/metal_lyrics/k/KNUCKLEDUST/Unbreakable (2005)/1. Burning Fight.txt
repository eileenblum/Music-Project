Concerns for the future
I know were born to die
What about the youth here
Condemned to hopelessness
How we bring life to this mess
And just turn away

Enter into this world with no future
Disease, corruption and war live right here
Weâre soon forced to forget all our roots here
To live in fear of dreader times head to rear
Life is pain but weâre still here
Stand on your own
Life is pain but weâre still here

And life still deals us blows
Sometimes so fast so we canât control
Tearing up and burning down our life, love and soul

It straight feels easier to bow
Give up and just allow
Than to hold tight
Put up a burning fight
Till the dimming of my life

To the lost I made this vow
Iâll scream aloud weâre ugly and proud

How we bring life to this and just turn away

Enter into this world with no future
Disease, corruption and war live right here
Weâre soon forced to forget all our roots here
To live in fear of dreader times head to rear
Life is pain but weâre still here
Stand on your own
Life is pain but weâre still here
