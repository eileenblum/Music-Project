Looking for a reason
A reason to stop grieving
Live such a fucked up game
Only the bloody can gain

Why bad minds live a long time
Make the innocent twisted and turn inside

Being pushed till broken not awoken
Canât sleep cos in sweat I arise soaking
Life over war, strife and death
Strive forever till I breathe out my last breath

Just look where we are
Injustice reigns and we all suffer the pain
Have to find strength and start to regain
More faith in each other, more faith in true friends

How can we not see
When itâs right there in front of our face
When the truths around us so blatantly
Will there ever be a safe place to raise our seed
What will it take, another tragedy

Stealing innocence, sell life cheap
Sowing seeds of hate so deep
Neglect, ignorance is all we will reap
The abuse must stop
How can we live to make others suffer
Only serves to make the road rougher
Seeds will grow and learn to know
What life teaches is down to how we sow

I see the youth with turmoil in their hearts
How many dead, how many left broken
Up against it from the very start
Smothered by hate
Weâre all left choking

Life is no commodity
We are burning

I see the people with tears in their eyes
They know inside that the future is uncertain
Forced to pass down a legacy of lies
So a new generation can carry the burden
