Struggle on day by day to live my life in peace
Convicted to do whatâs right and turn the other cheek
Judged for living my own way and this will never cease
Your ignorance will not prevail
Cast down your futureâs bleak

Unbreakable
I cannot be deterred
Unbreakable
No matter what you do
Unbreakable
Your torment will not be heard
Unbreakable
I will forever say
Fuck you

Brandishing your hate like a sabre
Trying to intimidate
Try to force a reaction but I will refuse
Your whole existance
Setting out to destroy what we create
But weâll hold on, I wonât crack, I wonât lose

I will forever say fuck you
Canât split this spirit from my soul
I will forever say fuck you
Painâs all that youâre owed

Fighting to keep my sanity
In a world of decayed humanity
