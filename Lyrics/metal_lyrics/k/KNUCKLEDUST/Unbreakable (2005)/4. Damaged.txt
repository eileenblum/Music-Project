I canât sleep at night till I wake and take fight
From all this agony
Lost all I was raised to believe in
Iâm near to crumbling to my knees
Opened up a world of pain inside my brain
And my heart will never be the same
Never be the same

Once held love in our hearts
Turned it into misery
Stress tore more than life apart
Damaged is all I can see

I know the truth, and you wonât hear it
Come out from my lips
You should have known
Better than to fuck around like a stupid cunt
Fighting this demon in my mind
And still find faith in being one of your kind
One of you kind

Once held love in our hearts
Turned it into misery
Stress tore more than life apart
Damaged is all I can see

Wonât tear the truth
From my heart
Wonât tear the truth
From my heartâ¦ No!

Wonât tear the truth from out of my heart
Be prepared to be torn apart
From all sides
Outcasted
Self educated in ways of dedication
