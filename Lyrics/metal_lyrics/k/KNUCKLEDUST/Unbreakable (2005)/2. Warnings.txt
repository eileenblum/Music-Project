For what I believe in I must strive
But thereâs too much devil in disguise
In their eyes they would extinguish our lives
Hypocrite, you lie, you wonât lock off our rise

Londonâs black up so my blood runs hot
Jente con sangre caliente
Till I die I wonât stop
But my heartâs still cold
My soulâs colder
Canât locate what I held to make me stronger

I never ask for a thing from this, Iâd never take
Every step travelled is a step we fight to make
Now itâs slowly changing, weâre doing the wrong
Canât let the peopleâs power go to corrupt ones

Some say hardcore is in their hearts
Canât understand why they still try tear it apart
In their soul they would extinguish the fire
Soldout, your life, you wonât stop us reaching higher

Londonâs black up so my blood runs hot
Jente con sangre caliente
Till I die I wonât stop
But my heartâs still cold
My soulâs colder
Canât locate what I held to make me stronger

Como llegamos a este punto
En este acunto
Situation mas sucio
I see the youth with new fire in their hearts
And itâs them whoâll elevate this battle to new parts
Against false words, hollow promises and smiles
Individuality again will rise
For our own sake this melting pot must survive

Warnings we choose to disregard
Donât fear the unknown in your heart
Full time we have to think smart
Never let this world tear you apart
Never again will I take no forked tongue talk
Stand like rock, search your heart
Born suffering, true strugglers
Always leave a mark
