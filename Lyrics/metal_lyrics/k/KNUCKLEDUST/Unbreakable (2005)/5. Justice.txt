Itâs hard to keep your head above water
When youâre drowning in hate
Twisting laws to control fates, canât run
Not now or ever
All for one and none for one
Try hold me back
Never givers only takers
They wear the crown

They will never take
They will never break me down
Guilty till proven innocent
Not guilty

Criminals in uniform
Mean nothing to me
Hide behind your laws
Stop us being free
Criminals in uniform
Weâll take no more
Weâll have no pity
When youâre dead on the floor

Fuck the law, fuck the rules, fuck your life
You swore to protect but control our lives
Being told weâre always guilty
When your hands are bloody and filthy

With a conscience that doesnât exist
Was it Hendon that taught you this?
To harass, oppress and take the piss
Even riot gear wonât save you from this

Criminal

People will riot again
They wonât be ready so they canât defend

Criminal

An uprising with bitter hate
For all the innocent lives youâve raped

Criminal PIG!
