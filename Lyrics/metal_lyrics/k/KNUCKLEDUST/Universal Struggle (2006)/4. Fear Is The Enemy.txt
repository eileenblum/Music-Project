Never forget what you did, never forget what you've done. Waking up cold everyday, you've betrayed now it's too late to make amends. For the twisted lines you pull, I want to see you fall. Liberties you took, not just with me but with those who were looking out for you. Now you've played the fool, I want to see you burn. Fear is the enemy. My outlook's changed since your disgrace and I'll never forget your fucking face. For as long as I live I'll regret the day I trusted you. I've learnt the lessons and now we're through, only I have honour, only I have truth. For as long as I live I'll regret the day I trusted you. We come up on the same streets but the difference is clear between you and me. You never had no heart, no pride, no soul.  I want to see you fail. Is the treachery running through your veins as family trait or your own shallow ways? I was brought up better than that. I will watch you burn. I have my family to thank for taking the time to raise me right. I won't live a lie. Fate will get you in due time or I'll even the score further downt he line.
