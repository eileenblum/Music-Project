No hope for us, no hope for you. Innocent death, the chosen few. The players remain the same, city streets still plagued with rage. Gun crime at an all time high, why? why? why? why? Respect is what they seek, respect is what they need. Respect, who is to blame? Respect, ask yourself this. It's the conscience behind the gun. Is it for love of just for fun? You get a split second choice to make. Either way you meet your fate.
