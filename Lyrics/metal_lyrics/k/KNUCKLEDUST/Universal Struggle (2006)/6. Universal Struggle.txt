As I make my way through everyday with stress on my head and bills to pay, no matter how hard I break my back It's not my pocket that's getting fat. All this work and no reward, no satisfaction for me. I won't sit back and be ignored and rot in frusration 'till it buries me. If I stand up and speak my mind, they'll try to sever my lifeline. Everything is covered with lies and al they do is wase my time. Now it's my time to take a stand. Get life under conrol before it's out of my hands. I'll push forward and rise above, won't play this game, I've had enough. I'll walk this path, these stones I've laid. I'm wiser now for the mistakes I've made. All the stolen hopes and broken dreams ain't far away as they once seemed. I've made this choice, I won't turn back, I can't lose what I've never had but I'll never know unless I try. I didn't build this to let it die.
