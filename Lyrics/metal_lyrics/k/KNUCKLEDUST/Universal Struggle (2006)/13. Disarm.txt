Another life lost. I can't believe my eyes. What the fuck is going on these days? People getting shot for backward reasons. Something's got to change. Another mother cries in her sleep, another soul lost to the streets. I can't believe my eyes, I can't believe everything that I've seen. So tell me what the fuck you gonna do, if the gun was pointed at you? So tell me how the fuck you gonna feel, when the victim is you? Disarm. Fuck Trident. Only now when more youths pick up a gun, you arrest, harass and pay more attention. When it's too late, it's what we've been taught, this world don't give a fuck about us. There's no hope but we've got to try. Do you want to see your children die?
