I wish you would fucking die. Eye for an eye, a life for a life. Patronise the whole fucking world, on every street this war will be fought. Anger rising day by day, your empire will crumble away. Every ally and every force, the feeling is you're gonna fucking pay. Are you willing to stand up and fight for your life, your friends, your family? Are you willing to stand and fight for your life, your friends, your family? Fucking scumbag, Fucking leech, I'd love to smash everyone of your teeth. For what you've done, you'll pay a price, next time around you won't even think tiwce. Time for you to fuckign die. A small price to pay for the families who cry. We'll show no fear and we'll stand proud and laugh aloud as your regime crumbles down.
