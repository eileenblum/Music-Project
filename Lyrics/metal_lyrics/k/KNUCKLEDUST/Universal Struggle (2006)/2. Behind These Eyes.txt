All I want to do is live my life true, past the pain you put me through. All around me all I see is suffering, I want to live life for me. Surrounded by depravity, in the face of adversity, I try to struggle on, my life's almost gone, I'm seeking clarity. No one knows what's behind these eyes, I'm a man alone I've turned the tide. You expect me to trust when everyone I see is a threat to me? You expect me to trust when everyone I see is an enemy? I've tried so hard to do the best I can, to become a better man but all around me all I see is apathy. It's not how I thought it would be. I don't care anymore. Been hurt too many times before but I'll struggle on, my life's almost gone, my lifeline ripped and turn. Fuck it all I live my life for me.
