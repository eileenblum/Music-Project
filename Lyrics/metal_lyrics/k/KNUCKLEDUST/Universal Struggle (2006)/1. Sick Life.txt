No time. No fear. Im sick to death of all these fears. How bad were things compared to this? Lies corner me and I wont run. For my famly I'll do what has to be done. These times are hard but together we'll hold strong. Living on more than hope because we know our time will come. Been forced to fight in the past but we stood our ground. Those who said we'd never make it, where are they now? Now here we stand in the face of our fears, got no regrets and it's too late for tears. Now is the time to make the most of our lives, we've built something that will never die. No time. No time for frenemies, they'll betray themselves in the end. Fuck those who'll never understand, we'll laugh as they die by their own hands.
