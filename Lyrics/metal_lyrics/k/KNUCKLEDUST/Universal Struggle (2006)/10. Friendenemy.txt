Forever you screamed with the rest of your brethren. You sold out so cheap, tried to cash your faith in. How can we unite when so many are two-faced frenemies. No dedication. Down for life, make sure the good you do outlives you. Eradicate all fears, the world won't stop if we die or live. So stand hard, spit in the face of conformity, or soon all you'll be is just another faded memory. Underground, that's all we know. It's always there for us and we will never forget. Major label deals ain't why we are here. If it's us against the world, then we've already come true and won clear. Was never promised a tomorrow but we still hold on. Maybe once strong in faith, the weakest now all but gone. Knew it weren't in your nature, you never let love drive you on. If it's not in your nature, learn to let love drive you on.
