[Rev. Mike âThe Faithâ Simmons:]
Will you bare your soul to me? I can take you higher
Use my fantasy, the whole worldâs a make believe

Love keeps burning inside of him
He canât fail his Mission, we canât lose him again

[Tommy âThe Touchâ Wolf:]
You may not believe in me, what Iâve got is true
I disregard your will

[Jennifer âThe Devotionâ Michaels:]
Heed the still small voice there within your mind
Your life wonât be an endless sacrifice
Yeah, bricks are falling, you canât look back
Lightning ânâ sparks flying âround your hand

Youâve got the touch
Hear the warnings, the fear and the visions that come to you
Everybody knows youâre the one
There ainât no liars here, all that youâve got is your touch

[Rev. Simmons:]
Kiss the pouring rain, donât play coy with me
Feed your heart

[Jennifer:]
Heed the still small voice there within your mind
Your life canât be an endless sacrifice
Bricks are falling, you canât look back
Lightning ânâ sparks flying âround your hand

Youâve got the touch
Hear all the warningsâ¦ Remember the flowers that bloom in your name
Everybody knows youâre the one
There ainât no liars here, all that you need is your touch

[Sheriff Paul âThe Lawâ Kovacs:]
Sheâs got me hanging somehow, donât ever try to change things around
Sheâs got you hanging somehow, donât try to change us and you may stick around

[Carol âThe Heartâ Jordan:]
Hold me, see meâ¦ There ainât no angels around
I canât let you all be inside of meâ¦

[Tommy:]
Hold still, feel meâ¦
There ainât no angels around
I canât let you all be inside of meâ¦
Hold me (Hold meâ¦), see me (See meâ¦)
There ainât no angels around
I canât let you all inside of meâ¦

[Paul:]
Sheâs got me hanging somehowâ¦ (I canât blame her, she loves you)
Sheâs got you hanging somehow but nowâs my turn to play
Donât ever try to change us
Well, I donât give a damn if they say youâre the chosen one

[Jennifer:]
Youâve got the touch
Hear the warnings, the fear and the visions that come to you
Everybody knows youâre the one
There ainât no liars here, all that you need is your touch
