[George âThe Maskâ Adams:]
Painâ¦
Sorrow and pain grow like dust, things they went too far this time
Lust and power have become an obsession, words are flying like venomous arrows

Money and power, lust and greedâ¦ To be is just to be perceived

[Tommy âThe Touchâ Wolf:]
Numbersâ¦
Numbers donât lie we all know, I can still foresee so many things
The theatre of our mind is always open, a little touch is all I need

Love and justice, passion and peaceâ¦ You can try but canât have it all

[George:]
Hey man, Iâm stuck here and feel betrayed by you
[Tommy:]
Hey you, believe in whatâs real without any proof

[George:]
Guiltâ¦
My blame and guilt are frozenâ¦ Well, nothing stays the same anyway
Unlikely for Tommy and his beloved cane, justice created addiction

Love and justice, passion and peaceâ¦ To be is just to be perceived

Hey man, Iâm stuck here and feel betrayed by you
[Tommy:]
Hey you, believe in whatâs real without any proof
[Rev. Mike âThe Faithâ Simmons:]
(Thy will be doneâ¦)
Hey man, your enemy lies inside of youâ¦ (Thy will be doneâ¦)
Hey you, will you ever erase the World with a nuke?

Armageddonâ¦

[Rev. Simmons to Tommy:]
Unless you want to be thereâ¦ Are you sure you want to spin that wheel again?
I could have never changed your mindâ¦ Youâll never be the same againâ¦

[Rev. Simmons to George:]
Unless you want to be there and feel like a man walking on the moon
Thereâs always just the other side, where lions sleep and fields are dryâ¦

[Rev. Simmons to Tommy:]
Unless you want to be thereâ¦ Donât ever let your darkened side win
Alight your path and bless your heart, no reason to enslave your mind

[Rev. Simmons to George:]
Unless you want to be thereâ¦ (Do you want to be there?)
And leave the world without any trace of us
You can always change your mind, donât hide again that part of you

[George:]
Hey man, Iâm stuck here and feel betrayed by you
[Tommy:]
Hey you, believe in whatâs real without any proof
[Rev. Simmons:]
(Thy will be doneâ¦)
Hey man, your enemy lies inside of youâ¦
(Thy will be doneâ¦)
Hey you, will you ever erase the World with a nuke?
â¦With a Nukeâ¦ With a Nukeâ¦
â¦With a Nukeâ¦ Oh, myâ¦
