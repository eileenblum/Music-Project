[Tommy âThe Touchâ Wolf:]
I was falling on The Black Ice
When I lost and found a better way
Thereâs a hidden spot in our minds
Awakened by a mistake

[Jennifer âThe Devotionâ Michaels:]
Always trust your sight
(Trust your sightâ¦)

[Tommy:]
You canât see what I see
(What I seeâ¦)
I just canât believe my life was gone

Winterâs gone the sun ainât shining
Iâve never had to worry
When I think about the wheels of life
I wonder âbout the wonder wheel

[Jennifer:]
Donât look back, move on
(Donât look back)
Fast forward and more
(And moreâ¦)

[Tommy:]
I just canât believe my lifeâs in vainâ¦
