[Tommy âThe Touchâ Wolf:]
Whenever I touch things I do share a tale, weâre born to make mistakes
I have to rely on my beloved cane, I see things that are never wrong

Some would call it a miracleâ¦ A gift, a sign, a damnationâ¦

Iâd rather stay out of trouble
Whenever Iâm touching my walking cane I rewind all the memories

[Dave âThe Friendshipâ Maxwell:]
Ainât your fantasy but a score of the lives we live

Tommyâs walking cane

[Tommy:]
Humans deserve to know the twist of fate and fill the blanks of pain
Anytime we get along, anytime we leave the wire uncut
Until a spike of ego comes and makes our consciousness kill the faith

Some would call it a miracleâ¦ Thoughts and dreams become physicalâ¦

Iâd rather stay out of trouble
Whenever Iâm touching my walking cane I rewind all the memoriesâ¦
Only trying to achieve the best for you and me

[Dave:]
Then no one is satisfiedâ¦ (No one is satisfiedâ¦)
Once they know, here comes another tear
Keep moving your human pawns, ainât your fantasy but a score of the lives we
live

Tommyâs walking cane
Tells a lie we live in

[Tommy:]
I can see all the way, you just stay away from me
I can see all the wayâ¦ Memories, prayers, goals, mistakesâ¦
Play on player, donât pull the plug, still two wrongs donât make a rightâ¦

I can see all the wayâ¦ (All the wayâ¦)â¦ Iâm a lightning rod, donât care âbout fame
Canât break down this wall of shame, still two wrongs donât make a rightâ¦

[Dave:]
Tommyâs walking cane
Tommyâs walking cane

[Tommy:]
Justice falls and I know that I canât play God
Though we are of a single mind, no one is a single thingâ¦ Yeah!

[George âThe Maskâ Adams:]
I can lead all the nations, take my hand and Iâll take up your fears
In a World made of honour and pride, will this God give me all that I need to get by?

[Tommy:]
Adams canât lead a Nation, grab my hand and Iâll show you my fears
In a World made of sorrow and lies, will your God give me all that I need to get by?

Iâd rather stay out of trouble
Whenever Iâm touching my walking cane I rewind all the memoriesâ¦
Only trying to achieve the best for you and me

[Dave:]
Then no one is satisfiedâ¦ (No one is satisfiedâ¦)
Once they know, here comes another tear
Keep moving your human pawns
Ainât your fantasy but a score of the lives we live, yeahâ¦Of the lies we liveâ¦
