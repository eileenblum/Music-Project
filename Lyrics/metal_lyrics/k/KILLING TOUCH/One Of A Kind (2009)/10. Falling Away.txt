[Rev. Mike âThe Faithâ Simmons:]
Some people bleed, some people try to forget
Canât you see where theyâre going through?
Youâre one of a kind, your heartâs on the line

[Tommy âThe Touchâ Wolf:]
No one is thereâ¦ No one believes you when you lie
Until we find the way, yeah
Unable to touch, afraid of the hurt

[Mike:]
Donât you know that our fear is our only creation
(Our fear is our only creation)
Letâs get rid of these rusty chains
Thereâs only a way to salvation
Taking you down will only make them believe in their liesâ¦
And you know they lie

[Tommy:]
Iâm falling awayâ¦ (Iâm falling awayâ¦)
No holds barred, I canât keep my feet on the groundâ¦ Yeahâ¦
Iâm falling awayâ¦ (Youâve got to seeâ¦)
See what you get when you open your mind
When youâre falling awayâ¦ (Iâm falling awayâ¦)
While youâre begging to stayâ¦ (Begging to stayâ¦)
Thereâs no denial when youâre lost
â¦When youâre falling awayâ¦ When youâre falling away

Some people hear, some people donât understand
Never tell what we are here for
[Mike:]
Youâre one of a kind, your hearts on the line

[Tommy:]
Yeah, I feel so unsureâ¦ So unsure though I have the touch
Nothing depends on you, yeah
Iâm on of a kind, my heartâs on the line
(My heartâs on the lineâ¦)

[Mike:]
Donât you know that our fear is our only creation
(Our fear is our only creation)
Letâs get rid of these rusty chains
Thereâs only a way to salvation
Taking you down will only make them believe in their liesâ¦
â¦Yeah, and you know they lie

[Tommy:]
Iâm falling awayâ¦ (Iâm falling away)
No holds barred, I canât keep my feet on the groundâ¦ Yeahâ¦
Iâm falling awayâ¦ (Youâve got to seeâ¦)
See what you get when you open your mind
When youâre falling awayâ¦ (Iâm falling awayâ¦)
While youâre begging to stayâ¦ (Begging to stayâ¦)
Thereâs no denial when youâre lost
â¦When youâre falling awayâ¦ When youâre falling away

â¦When youâre falling awayâ¦ When youâre falling away
â¦When youâre falling awayâ¦ Oh, yeahâ¦

[Mike:]
Our fear is our only creation
Letâs get rid of these rusty chains
