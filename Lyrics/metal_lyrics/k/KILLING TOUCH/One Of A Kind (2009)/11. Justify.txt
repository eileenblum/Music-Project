[Tommy âThe Touchâ Wolf:]
I was falling on The Black Ice
When I lost and found a better way
Thereâs a path we always walk on by
Keep going until you find me

Never had to fight
(â¦Had to fightâ¦)
Never had to hide
(â¦Had to hideâ¦)
I just canât believe my faith is gone
(â¦Is gone awayâ¦)

Yeah, winterâs gone the sun ainât shining
Lust is just another round of lies
All the pain all around anyway
Canât change the way I want it

Never had to fight
(â¦Never had to fightâ¦)
Never had to hide
I just canât believe Iâm still aliveâ¦

Carol âThe Heartâ Jordan:
Justify
All the friends weâve lost so far
Justify
All the memories left behind
Justify
(Just if Iâ¦)
All of the things you canât explain
Justifyâ¦
All the whys come and goâ¦ Youâ¦

[Jennifer âThe Devotionâ Michaels:]
Justify
All the times you did not care
âNot this timeâ
Fill your lungs with brand new air

Justify
Donât forget your love comes first
[Tommy âThe Touchâ Michaels:]
Mystified
Are the ones who just donât believe in me, noâ¦

[Jennifer âThe Devotionâ Michaels:]
Giving for too long will make your soul come alive
With the hunger that you tried to hide behind your little heart
All the things youâre still trying to change wonât just make it right
Realize youâre just a human being, yeahâ¦

[Tommyâs Mind:]
Start giving yourself a little more
Giving yourself a little more
Your heart lies rotten to the core
Keep giving yourself a little more
Giving yourself a little more
[Rev. Mike âThe Faithâ Simmons:]
Stick to the wills we all know so well
(Giving yourself a little more, giving yourself a little more â¦)
All the little things can turn your world around
â¦In between there lies another wayâ¦
Another wayâ¦

[Tommy âThe Touchâ Michaels:]
Just if Iâ¦
[Tommyâs Mind:]
â¦All the lives you will not saveâ¦
You still got time
Stop hurting yourself, donât give me another round of lies

[Jennifer âThe Devotionâ Michaels:]
Living for the day may take your two sides apart, whoaâ¦
(Sides apartâ¦)
[Tommyâs Mind:]
No compromisesâ¦
[Tommy âThe Touchâ Michaels:]
All the days Iâve lost asking why
Why the hell am I bleeding?
â¦You should see what I seeâ¦
