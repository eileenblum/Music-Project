[Dave âThe Friendshipâ Maxwell:]
Running scared among the fields of passion, like a fire grown cold
Left the glory under lock and key where my gold is slowly turning to rust

All the blame youâve been taking will only get this far
Give yourself a new meaning, donât waste your precious time

[Tommy âThe Touchâ Wolf:]
Iâm one of a kind, no turning back
I can see where Iâm going
Iâm holding to now, ainât looking back
Though my hands are tied and I canât break free
One of a kind, no turning back
Weâre heading right to nowhere
Iâm one of a kind and I donât know whyâ¦
For you are still withinâ¦
There I can see you, Carolâ¦

See the sun going down while Iâm thinking, living just a vivid past
By the time I realize my mistakes all the curtains will be fallen apart

[Dave:]
All the pride youâve been hiding will only get this farâ¦ (â¦Will only get this far..)
Give yourself a new living, donât waste your precious heart

[Tommy:]
Iâm one of a kind, no turning back
I can see where Iâm going
Iâm holding to now, ainât looking back
All the choices made and the vows I forgot
One of a kind, no turning back
Weâre heading right to nowhere
Iâm one of a kind and I donât know whyâ¦
For you are still withinâ¦
There I can see youâ¦

Almost taken by the rocking movement, my numbers are the colours of life
My securitiesâ¦ They only feed my aversion to look straight in your eyes

[Dave:]
All the love youâve been saving will only get this farâ¦ (â¦Will only get this far..)
Give yourself a new meaning, donât waste your precious life

[Tommy:]
Iâm one of a kind, no turning backâ¦
Iâm holding to now, ainât looking backâ¦
One of a kind, no turning backâ¦
I can see where Iâm going, yeah
Iâm one of a kind, now Iâm aliveâ¦
Though my hands are tied and I canât break free

Iâm one of a kind, no turning back
I can see where Iâm goingâ¦ (I can see where Iâm goingâ¦)
Iâm one of a kind and I donât know whyâ¦
Though my hands are tied and I canât break free
(I want to see you Carolâ¦)
One of a kind, no turning back
Weâre heading right to nowhereâ¦ (Heading right to nowhereâ¦)
Iâm one of a kind and I donât know why...
For you are still withinâ¦
There I can see you, Carolâ¦
