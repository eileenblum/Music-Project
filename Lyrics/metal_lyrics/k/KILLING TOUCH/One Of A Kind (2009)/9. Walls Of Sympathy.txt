[Rev. Mike âThe Faithâ Simmons:]
Lifeâ¦ Life can deceive when youâre falling in love
Lightâ¦ (Lightâ¦)
Our weakness revealed and I canât let it beâ¦

Lost and led astray, Iâm ready to fall
But it just canât be this way

[Dr. Robert âThe Scienceâ Richards:]
Hold on to the edge of your life
Codes and combinations to open your mind

[Dave âThe Friendshipâ Maxwell:]
Iâve got a feeling you just canât believe it
Knowing may bleed you dry

[Tommy âThe Touchâ Wolf:]
The lightâ¦ The lie that I feelâ¦

[Mike:]
Lights out!

[Tommy:]
Nobodyâs there for meâ¦ (Nobodyâs there for meâ¦)
Nobody makes you fallâ¦ (Your fallâ¦)
There is a path we walk on by

See the Country Fair waiting for me
I remember my last day of a life that was meant to be right, perfect and
flawlessâ¦ That was a lie

Iâm never complaining, I keep on trying
Not bad is not so good

The lightâ¦ The lie that I feel so close

[Mike:]
Lights out!

[Tommy:]
Nobodyâs there for meâ¦ (Nobodyâs there for meâ¦)
Nobody makes my dayâ¦ (My dayâ¦)
There is a path we walk on by
[Mike:]
Pledge your gift, take my sage advice
Lights out!
[Jennifer âThe Devotionâ Michaels:]
Nobodyâs there for youâ¦ (Nobodyâs there for youâ¦)
Nobody waits for your callâ¦ (Your callâ¦)
Youâre climbing these walls of sympathy
Afraid of the dream

I want you to know, I want you to know meâ¦ (Get to know meâ¦)
Donât see any cloudsâ¦ Donât fall, seek the truth you once lost

[Mike:]
Lifeâ¦ (Lifeâ¦)
Life can deceive when you fallâ¦ (When youâre fallingâ¦)
Lightâ¦ (Lifeâ¦)â¦
Your weakness revealed, let it be

[Tommy:]
Fallen between two hearts, no one can see how Iâm striving
And the times that we had have become my release hereâ¦ Yeah!!!

[Mike:]
Lifeâ¦ Life can deceive when youâre falling in love
Lightâ¦ (Lightâ¦)â¦
Our weakness revealed and I canât let it be
Lightâ¦ Lightâ¦ Light can deceive when youâre falling
(Light canât deceive when youâre falling)

Lights out!

[Tommy:]
Nobodyâs there for meâ¦ (Nobodyâs there for meâ¦)
Nobody makes my dayâ¦ (My dayâ¦)
There is a path we walk on by
[Mike:]
Pledge your gift, take my sage advice
Lights out!
[Jennifer:]
Nobodyâs there for youâ¦ (Nobodyâs there for youâ¦)
Nobody waits your callâ¦ (Your callâ¦)
Youâre climbing these walls of sympathy

[Mike:]
Lights out!

[Tommy:]
(Nobodyâs there for meâ¦ Your fallâ¦)
There is a path we walk on by
Iâm filling the lack of faith
[Mike:]
Lights out!
[Jennifer:]
Nobodyâs there for youâ¦ (Nobodyâs there for youâ¦)
Nobody waits for your call
Youâre climbing these walls of sympathy
Afraid of the dreamâ¦
