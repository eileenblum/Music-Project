[Tommy âThe Touchâ Wolf:]
Let my senses fall and rove too deep, yeah
âTill I know what Iâve lost without you
Wondering how to make amends, yeah
I canât make a move, Iâm stuck inside of me

[Jennifer âThe Devotionâ Michaels:]
Lost your faith
Life goes on without you
No oneâs there when youâre falling apart
Lost your soul
You canât live without it
Please believe what Iâm saying

[Dr. Robert âThe Scienceâ Richards:]
Call your inner voice and pray
Seems like youâre lost in time, lost in timeâ¦

[Carol âThe Heartâ Jordan:]
Youâve got to live
Donât know just what Iâm feeling
Get all the memories left behind
Youâd better live or die before leaving
Before drifting apart again

[Rev. Mike âThe Faithâ Simmons:]
So youâre chasing your fears away
But a coma is more than you could bear
[Tommyâs Mind:]
Still donât know just what it really means
While he works his fingers right to the bone, yeah

[Jennifer:]
Lost your faith
Life goes on without you
No oneâs there and your brain falls apart
Lost your soul
You canât live without her
What you give ainât what youâve got

[Robert:]
Call your inner voice and pray
Thatâs when you lose your sight and you get your real sightâ¦

[Carol:]
Youâve got to live
Donât know just what Iâm feeling
Find all the memories left behind
Youâd better live or die before leaving
Before drifting apart again

I beg you please
A magic shot is all it takes
Youâre hanging by such a fragile thread
A different way
A whole brand new beginning
Pick up the pieces, one by oneâ¦

[Tommy:]
My blood ainât spilling but I need an ignition
Holy water is flowing through me
Counting the drops âtil I get salvation
Hereâs my turn, my destiny

I can see the day when I was alive
Seize the day âcause tomorrow may never come
I canât see the day Iâll be coming back alive
While nothing stays the same

I can see the day when I was aliveâ¦
I canât see the day Iâll be coming back aliveâ¦
Please believe what Iâm sayingâ¦ Yeah!

[Carol:]
Youâve got to live
Donât know just what Iâm feeling
Find all the memories left behind
Youâd better live or die before leaving
Before drifting apart again

I beg you please
A magic shot is all it takes
Youâre hanging by such a fragile thread
A different way
A whole brand new beginning
Pick up the pieces, one by one

[Tommy:]
I can see the day when I was aliveâ¦
I canât see the day Iâll be coming back aliveâ¦

I canât see the day Iâll be coming back aliveâ¦

I can see the day when I was aliveâ¦
I canât see the day Iâll be coming back aliveâ¦
