[Tommy âThe Touchâ Wolf:]
God theyâre tracing a map with my dead zone
Hundreds of lines trying to explain the unknown
We have so many true lies going deep down our souls

[Rev. Mike Simmons:]
Thereâs a voice locked insideâ¦ Can you heal all their lives?
Yeah, youâre lost like those tears in the sand
(See whatâs insideâ¦)â¦ Will you come back alive?
(Shadows apartâ¦)â¦ Take our shadows apart?
Yeah, arise like a blue dawn againâ¦ Will you come back to me?

[Tommy:]
God, the map of my brain leads to nowhere
They X-marked the spot where future and past pass me by
No one ainât fooling myself or trying to deceive me
