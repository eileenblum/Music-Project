[Tommy âThe Touchâ Wolf:]
Driving faster, speeding back to her
Now our hearts are getting closer
Hold tight through the night before we come undoneâ¦ (Before we come undone)
Well this pumping headache wonât leave me aloneâ¦ Oh, no

Didnât have to pretend, pretend what Iâm feeling
All the colours are bright, too bright to steerâ¦

I want to get back and never ever have to live this way
Life is more than this and you know it so well
I want to get back and never ever have to leave these rails
There is so much left that I have to say and you know it so well

Life keeps turning, spinning out of time
Way beyond the point of no return, yeah
Drifting, creeping here between these walls
All I ever believed in is lost and goneâ¦ Yeahâ¦(Can you see what I see?)

We keep rolling the dice, the karma was on to me
Didnât know God was playing with my life

I want to get back and never ever have to live this way
Life is more than this and you know it so well
I want to get back and never ever have to leave these rails
There is so much left that I have to say to you

[Rev. Mike âThe Faithâ Simmons:]
You reveal the secrets
[Tommy:]
(I reveal the secretsâ¦)
Mike:
I would never share themâ¦
[Tommy:]
(Youâve got to share them with meâ¦)
Mike:
I just canât believe it
(I just canât believe it)
[Tommyâs Mind:]
No way Iâm going to share it with youâ¦

[Tommy:]
Got to dig deeper, I donât know you so well
All it takes is a little touch
Can you feel the shock when our hands finally meet?
You should see what I seeâ¦

Past and futureâ¦ Open pagesâ¦

I was falling on the Black Ice
When I lost and found a better way
Thereâs a hidden spot in our minds
Awakened by a mistake
â¦You keep going until you find me
â¦You keep going until you find me

I want to get back and never ever have to live this way
Life is more than this and you know it so wellâ¦ (And you know so wellâ¦)
I want to get back and never ever have to leave these rails
There is so much left that I have to say

I want to get back and never ever have to live this way
(Never gonna live this wayâ¦)
Life is more than this and you know it so wellâ¦ (And you know so wellâ¦)
I want to get back and never ever have to leave these rails
There is so much left that I have to say to you

[Mike:]
You reveal the secrets
[Mike:]
I would never share them
[Mike:]
I just canât believe it

[Tommy:]
Got to dig deeper, now I know you so well
All it takes is a little touch
Can you feel the shock when our hands finally meet?
You should see what I see

[Tommyâs Mind:]
My head keeps spinning, all I see is dark
Everything fadesâ¦ Fades to blackâ¦
