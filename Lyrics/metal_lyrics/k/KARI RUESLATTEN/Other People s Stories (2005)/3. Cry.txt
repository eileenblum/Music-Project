I walk out of the shade into the light
For what must be the very first time
I don`t walk fast I`m enjoying each step
Then I see you from a distance

And I smile
Smile through my tears

Falling apart is not for me
I`d rate stick to fight
When I`ve been here for years
For a thousand years
There will still be dark days ahead

I cry even though I smile
Smiling through tears is something that I will recomend
Sometimes when you`re near
Oh, I sense you in here
I know it has taken a while for me to come clear

It`s getting darker outside
I put on a coat
It`s been a while since I felt cold
