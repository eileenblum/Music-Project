Fishing, fishing now
Down by the bay
Fishing with the girls
It`s so lively out there
Shall I cast the line?
Cast it in, cast it in, all the girls are saying
But I`ve got my eyes set onjust one

And it`s you
Oh`it`s you

It`s you who I`m standing in front of with nothing to hide
Take me in
Take me inside of your dreams and your thoughts and your mind
This time I`m leaving the girls
Look, I`m wearing your pearls
I have decided to stay here forever
Once I was restless but now im where I`d like to be
