Did you ever think of me
Did you ever think that I cared
How could you walk away just like that
You know that I depended on you

I was only ever scared
When you tried to make feel
Like I was the only one
You where only ever there
When I tried to push you away
Oh, you`ve come back for more

Did you ever come to ask
Did you ever come to see
How come you never let me go
How come I never said-no

Look how she`s dancing
Look how she`s holding her head up high

Don`t say a word
I have found peace
This will be my home
My home is where you are
