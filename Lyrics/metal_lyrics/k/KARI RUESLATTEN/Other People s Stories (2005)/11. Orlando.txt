There`s a time for rivers to run beneath the trees
There`s a time for birds to fly across the sky
There`s a time for lovers to wander into the woods
Orlando there`s a time for you and I
There`s a time, orlando
For me to sing your story
There`s a time, orlando
To sing other people`s stories
There`s a time, orlando
To sing my own story too
