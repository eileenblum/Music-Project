Mother, I feel so cold, she says and stares into the dark
I take hold of her hands
She`s burning like fire

I have seen the lilies bloom on a cold winter day
I have heard dead men speak
And wash their sins away
No more shall I fear the night
I have seen it all
I`d give away my heart and soul if only that could bring her back to life

She was fair, like light and day
She was my heart`s delight
She says no-one`s to blame
But indeed I blame myself
