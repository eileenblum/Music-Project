While there is light there is life I hear you say
While there is life there is hope I hear you say

I didn`t want to meet your eyes
But when I do they shine-im not worthy of being shone for

Wherever you wanderer I followed you there
But nothing seems to last for a lifetime anymore

I cannot feel your touch-I am numb
When you speak I find it hard to understand your words

I never meant it to cause you any anger or grief
We both agree that nothing is what it once was

When I look at you it hurts
When I hold you tigh it feels like we only just met
