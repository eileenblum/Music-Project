I couldn`t stop driving
I drove all night
All the way from berlin
I thought I might shoot her
I never thought crying would make me weak
But when she stood there all tearful
I had to ask myself why
Is she worth coming here for
Will she do me good

Don`t try to push me now
I`m working hard for my living
Don`t try to tell me how
I`m supossed to live my life
And how easy it all could have been
How easy somebody`s life can be

She came from somewhere
She was too young
She had it coming
She took it too far
I could say something
Just to be nice
But I don`t belive in making things right
I put on my gloves
I have done this before
It won`t cost a thing
