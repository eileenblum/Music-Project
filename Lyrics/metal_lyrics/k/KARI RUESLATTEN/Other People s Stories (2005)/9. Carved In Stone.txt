I let myself in
Through the kitchen door
Silence at first
I found her on the floor

I have walked through fire, she said
I ran, I ran as fast as I could
But it was still too late

Just like my father
She gave away every hour of every day
She could never find a way out of this place

Her life was carved in stone
There was not much I could do
She let me stay the night
I have walked through fire, she said

Even the birds are crying
How come I feel no pain
No sadness at all
