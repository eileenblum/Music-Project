Right here
in what remains of the night.
My vision is finally clear
from my view up high
I see sign on the surface
feel the tide closing in, closing in
coming in, coming in here

I can feel the presence of the past
of my dreams and of my hopes
this is my home
I shall stay eternal here

I summon my sorrows
let me touch Thy absence
My thoughts
are finally gathered
feel the tide closing in, closing in
coming in, coming in here
