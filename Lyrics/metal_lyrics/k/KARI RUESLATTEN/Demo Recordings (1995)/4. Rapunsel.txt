My beloved I have waited so long
How can it be daylight keeps us apart
Make me assured it is you
and that no-one sees us

Oh my princess your eyes shine so bright
For your love I will give up my life
Make me...

Be aware of my father the king
If he sees us he will surely lock me in the tower
Make me...

Come to me at night
Whistle our tune at the feet of the tower
Make me...

Then I shall let out my hair
it will light up the night so you'll find your way
Make me...

He stayed with his princess all through the night
at down came the king
Make me...

Evil tongues came from far
their minds filled with envy
The princess with the golden hair
shall not see her beloved again

The king sentenced the young knight to death
blind for his daughters prayers
Make me...

When the third day came to an end
She drove a dagger through her ancient heart
Make me...
