Cast away the shadows
Cast away the shadows
Cast away the shadows behold the view
I am but an evil, I am but a man

Cast away the shadows
Cast away the shadows
Cast away the shadows behold the view
Ember turn to fire, rock turn to dust

Cast away the shadows
Cast away the shadows
Cast away the shadows behold the view
Aware on the sacred night, waiting for
the signs to appear

Cast away the shadows
Cast away the shadows
Cast away the shadows behold the view
Mistress turn to Goddess, blood turn to wine
