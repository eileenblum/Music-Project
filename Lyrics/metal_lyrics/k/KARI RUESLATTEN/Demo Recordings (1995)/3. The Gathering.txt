She rises her head into the night
-They gather every full moon
She nods at her sister the time is right
-They gather every full moon

Join in the ring
the fire will burn until morning

They assemble to reach the mountain top
-They gather every full moon
The excitement is kept in suspense
-They gather every full moon

Join in the ring
the fire will burn until morning

The air is chilling the skin is bare
-They gather every full moon
but dance is surely to heat the atmosphere
-They gather every full moon

Join in the ring
the fire will burn until morning

Fierceness is turning them willing
-They gather every full moon
Nature approves on the sacrifices made
-They gather every full moon

Join in the ring
the fire will burn until morning
