I can dance and I can sing
I can tell what the future will bring
Come wanderer with me
and we'll see what you are blessed to be

Hey there my love will you spare a thought for me
I'd climb the highest mountain to set my spirit free
There they come and there they go no-one's left for me

Kneel in front of fire place
Let the warmth fill your veins
Lay your weapons down
and I will heal your wounds

Hey there my love will you spare a thought for me
I'd climb the highest mountain to set my spirit free
There they come and there they go no-one's left for me

Lay you down to rest my friend
Be aware of the thoughts they send
I'll call on the wind and storm
to cover your pursuers path

Hey there my love will you spare a thought for me
I'd climb the highest mountain to set my spirit free
There they come and there they go no-one's left for me
