I can not see but darkness and death
I feel cold breeze enter the tune
Thy voice once so soft, declaring Thy love
Why hast Thou forsaken me

I enter the castle we shared once again
Here in these halls our love was to behold
now for only to remain in the dream
Why hast Thou forsaken me

I feel this thing woe
creep into my heart
for there to remain forever as I fear

In the deepest of nights
when my name is called out
I know I will come, I can no longer resist
