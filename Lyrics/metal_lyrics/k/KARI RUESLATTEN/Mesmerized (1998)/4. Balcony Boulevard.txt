If I were to live
on Balcony Boulevard
My feet wouldn't touch the ground
But what if I fell down?

Would you see mee from the top
Would you see me waking up
I'd never go astray
but then, you'd find me anyway

Would I miss my beloved moss-covered stones
the woods I once called home?
Would I still dream the dream of you?

The ghost you see - it's only me
I am no longer free
If I fall, I fall alone
but if I fall for you, fall for you
