I shut my mouth
and lift my head up high
Singing my time will come
Can you carry me home?

I close my eyes
I close everything in sight
'cause I don't want to see
Be good to me

Here we stand now
I have it all close to me
Here we go now
looking for a different angle

This is me
I am what you see
I am wild and strong
Where do I belong?

I close my eyes
I close everything in sight
I have no dignity, all my sense laugh at me
I go away
