I need a place where no one has to know
what I cry for - what I choose to show
of myself and how I'd like to keep
the wolf inside me - finally asleep

You are just a tree in my garden
Well, I'm the one who is looking for a friend

Way down to  now
Way down to 
I am way down to  now
Way down to 

So one day it's knocking on my door
Be careful now, it's slippery - the floor
I wax it now and then, it makes me feel
better all the time - let's spin the wheel

Way down a different line
way down now
Hey down to a different world this time
Way down to a different kind of low
