She is just passing through
Last year and the year before
She is just passing through you

She washed the day away
instead of making it allright
She washed the day away
- How brave

You don't have to let her in
just listen and let her begin

She is Cinderella in desguise [sic]
or The Mermaid in despite
of her very human feet
dancing in her Ballroom Suite

You never did treat her well
oh, sure you had nice words to sell
You never did treat her well
- and you know it

She has come here today
and I don't think she's here to stay

Cinderella has to go
oh, I wish it was not so
As the clock soon will strike twelve
we will find her as herself
