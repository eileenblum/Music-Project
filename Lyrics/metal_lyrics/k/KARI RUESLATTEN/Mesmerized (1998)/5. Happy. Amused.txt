There was this girl
that I just had to be and
There was this world
that I just had to see but
I could not get away
I could not run away no
I could not get away but still

She was not scared
she knew wich [sic] way to go and
If she just dared
She would succeed and so
she wanted it to be
a special hide-away and
she wanted it to be secret

I'm happy, amused and aware
of everything waiting for me out there
I'm happy, amused and aware
I don't need guidance - my vision is clear

And so she swam
across the raging sea and
now she is gone
and all I see is myself
I wanted it to be
a special hide-away and
I wanted it to be secret

All I can do is breath in
All I can do is begin
And I can see that I am not alone
All I can do is breath in
All I can do is begin
And I can see I am not the only one
