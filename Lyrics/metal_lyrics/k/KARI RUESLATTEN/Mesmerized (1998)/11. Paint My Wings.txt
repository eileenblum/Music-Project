Can I kiss you though I'm leaving
Can I show I care?
Can I hold you like the first time
though you know I won't be there?

I will paint my wings with beautiful things
and whisper words in the night
I will come around and bring what I found
when I went to look for the sea

Nothing withers, it just shivers in the wind

Can you find it in your heart
to one day forgive me?
I never meant to cause you sorrow
I always meant for you to see

But when seasons call your name
And cover all your grief
You will find that you don't think of me
as often as you once did
