You know I gave it away
You know I gave it to someone else instead
But like a crack of a dawn
and like an Easter-Rabbit-Song - I knew you'd be gone

You said that I was the one
that you could put all your grief upon
But like a crack of a dawn
and like an Easter-Rabbit-Song - I knew you'd be gone
with the Easter-Song singing

I want you, I want you to see
the thing you still haven't seen in me
I gave you all - all you had in me

For the sake of our love
and for all the times that we have shared
Can I sing you this song
And when all the Easter-Rabbits are gone
I still have you here - at least a piece of you

And so I gave it away
And so I gave it to someone else instead
