[As of me]

Som av meg
Som ild i har
var du her

Jeg kunne v?rt alt du er,
alt du var, og alt du ville bli
Alle morke tanker ville vike i vart liv
jeg skulle elsket deg, skulle gitt deg mitt blod
Og om du ville hadde jeg levd for deg

Som av meg
Som ild i har
var du her

Jeg kunne v?rt alt du er,
alt du var, og alt du ville bli
Fantes det en evighet, sa var den til for oss
Jeg skulle ha sett for deg nar solen sank i hav
Og om du ville hadde jeg dodd for deg

Om jeg ser tilbake
pa alt det som var
Jeg foler hva jeg folte og vet at ingen noen gang
vil komme sa n?r

Som av meg
Som ild i har
var du her

Jeg kunne v?rt alt du er,
alt du var, og alt du ville bli
Tiden skulle bli en venn vi begge fant igjen
Men nar jeg ser deg ga na, vil jeg den skal ga med deg
Og viske ut den veien vi hadde lagt ut pa

[ENGLISH]
As of me
As fire in hair
were you here

I could have been all you are,
all you were, and all you wanted to be
All dark thoughts would yield in our life
I should have loved you, should have given you my blood
And if you wanted, I would have lived for you

As of me
As fire in hair
were you here

I could have been all you are,
all you were, and all you wanted to be
Were there an eternity, then it was there for us
I should have seen you when the sun set in the sea
And if you wanted, I would have died for you

If I look back
at all that used to be
I feel what I felt and I know that no one
will ever come quite so close

As of me
As fire in hair
were you here

I could have been all you are,
all you were, and all you wanted to be
Time was to become a friend we both rediscovered
But when I see you leaving now, I want it to go with you
And erase the path we had set out upon
