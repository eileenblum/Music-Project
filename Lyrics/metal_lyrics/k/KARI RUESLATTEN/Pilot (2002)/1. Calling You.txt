you've got a story to tell
and a place to come home to
yet, you choose to hide
do you feel safer out here
where no one will be watching
or do you fear the light
i am calling you
i am watching you
i walk with you
i play like you
unafraid and blue
i hear them whipping the mule
as they follow the coffin
destined for the field
the mourners behind
i see you're walking amongst them
i know you need my voice
all these familiar faces
all gathered around the open mouth
i see your shadow down there
- but then it's gone
