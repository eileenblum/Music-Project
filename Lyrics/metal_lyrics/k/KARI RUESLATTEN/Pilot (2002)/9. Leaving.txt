you've got the shock
you've got the crying
you've got the guild
you've got the house
i have got leaving on my side
you've got rock bottom
you've got the people
you've got the winter
you've got the penance
the upper hand
the promised land
if nothing counts
and if something is nothing
i've got leaving on my side
it counts for something
if nothing is something
i've got leaving on my mind
it counts if nothing counts
