behind my new face
i'm the same as i've always been
wondering how you are
if i am your mother still
i'm wearing the denim dress
and my hair is the same way
i want you to remember
and to keep me alive
this time of year
i'd give my life to live
out there with you
and watch you smile in your sleep
i see you across the room
i fear that i cannot even breathe
oh gosh, how you have grown
you're nearly as tall as myself
i want everyone to notice
just how proud you make me feel
instead i say nothing
and then you head for the door
