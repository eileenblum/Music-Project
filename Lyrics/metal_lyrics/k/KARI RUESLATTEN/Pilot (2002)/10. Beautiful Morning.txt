beautiful morning
how can you greet me
like that you never used to know me before
beautiful morning
smiling all softly
like an ally or lover
how can you do that
you should know better by now
but i believe things always change
maybe this time
you come with the sun
i never thought that the sun
would shine around here
i never thought that the sun
would be my friend
beautiful morning
i'm not a mother
all i possessed
i have given away
beautiful morning
do you still want me
right now i'm counting
hours of the day and the days of the week
