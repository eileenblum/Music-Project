dark as the colour of a river
i taste your name
roll it around my tongue
dark as the colour of a river
i sense there's a danger
that does not hinder me
i take you in
before i realise
and i breathe with you
before i realise
like a lover
down the river
like the stories never told
like a mirror
of the river
with you i see myself
dark as the colour of a river
you're coming closer
i dare not even speak
dark as the colour of a river
i see you're trembling
i reach out my hand
no regrets
they're wasted anyway
turn around
i'm not here to harm you
