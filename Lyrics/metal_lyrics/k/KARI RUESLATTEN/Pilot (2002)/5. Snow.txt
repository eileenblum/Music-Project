all i want
is to step outside into the mist
with bare feet
underneath the other side of the sun
it will be
a ferry waiting there for me
to take me across
it merely holds one chair
i know i must loose you
mhm mmmhmhm
it's not that i have not got faith
mhm mmmhm
but i have got some stuff to do
and people who need seeing to aha
and i must build a world of snow
close your eyes
it will be less painful naturally
and you should know
that nothing ever stays the same
especially
all the things we build in snow
like
castles horses men and cities
