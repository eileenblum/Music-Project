i know when you are hurting
your pain is mine
let me carry you through the morning mist
and on to the bridge
let us talk about the hard times
find shelter in my hands
give your thoughts some rest
as there are two of us tonight
never fly away
until you have tried everything
give it one more day
good things lie in wait
hold on to yourself
you know that the wind will change
i cannot be your eyes
but i will try to make you see
that beauty lies underneath your skin
this fight is yours to win
a piece of this moment
is all it will ever take
stay afloat and stay right here
be as one with me
oh, nothing tastes as sweet now
as it once did
in time you know it will
