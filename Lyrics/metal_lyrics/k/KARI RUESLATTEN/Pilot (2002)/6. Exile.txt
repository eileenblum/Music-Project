i just want to lay myself down
drink the illusions and let it all float away
into the river of voices
one of them will speak and tell me where to go
i packed my thoughts and visions
headed for the light on the other side
although consoling was a myth
the tunnel was a con
i ran - but i never turned back
i have deported my own life
into this foolish splendour
i have brought the beauty of a soul
cold and dark as the last day
is the image of the dream
that made it all worth-while
in exile
if there is a sign out there hiding
come to me now or forever hold your peace
you'll find me in my room in the guesthouse
riding clouds that are hard to please
when there is a fight i will be there
it feels so good to do what one should not do
and i play i gamble and stay
i look - but i never turn back
