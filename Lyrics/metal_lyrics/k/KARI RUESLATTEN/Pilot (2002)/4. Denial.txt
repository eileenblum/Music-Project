what if i told you
straight to your face
what if i told you
nothing at all
cover it with make-up
hiding all the bruises
no one shall notice
no one shall know
why can't you hear me no more
hear when i whisper your name
hear why i feel so ashamed
hear when i silence my tears
what if i pointed
a gun to your head
what if i pulled the trigger
you do deserve it
all the hurt you can get
besides no one shall notice
no one shall know
