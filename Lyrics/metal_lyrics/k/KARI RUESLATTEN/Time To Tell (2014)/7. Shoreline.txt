I lied that night in the woods/tears sliding down the bones of your face/afraid that I'd tell you truth/from here we see the shoreline/with its bends and stale cliffs/by the shore of Harleness/I long for your embrace/cold that night in the woods/my hands trembling inside your hands/I say the words - I tell you the truth/an island so it seems will be my hiding place
