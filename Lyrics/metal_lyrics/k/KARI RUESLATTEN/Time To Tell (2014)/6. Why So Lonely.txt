Why so lonely
Here you may rest
Lay your head down at my chest

Darkened days brighten
No more to frighten
Will you be mine
Until the end of time

Why so lonely
I'll give you shelter
Comfort you, carry you
through our lives

Darkened days brighten
No more to frighten
Will you be mine
Until the end of time

Why so lonely, I'll be the one
you always can turn to
I am yours

For as long as you want to
Lend me your heart
I will shelter it
Until the end of time
