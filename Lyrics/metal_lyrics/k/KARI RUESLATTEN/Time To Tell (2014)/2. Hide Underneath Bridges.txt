going down to the river again/in the darkness I found a friend/I never knew I had/the water felt cold and stale/reminiscent of a long gone tale/I forgot who I was/right now it is so hard to let go/blinding lights won't show the way out of here/I hide underneath bridges/hide in the shadows/finding a rescue so brief/I hide underneath bridges/hide in the darkness/fearing the light like a thief/late night I hear the wind blows/calling out about the life I chose/waiting for a relief/still looking for that special place/where I could ease the pain with grace and recall who/I fear I will never let go/the blinding lights won't show the way out here/I know I'll always hear the wind blow/maybe one day it will show the way out of here
