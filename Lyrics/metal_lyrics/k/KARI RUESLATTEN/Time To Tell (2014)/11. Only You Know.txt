so still in the deep/waiting for you to sleep/so small, so small - fragile/in the deep we're all alone/fighting without a crowd/I know I would if I could/I don't know what the future holds for us/I don't know if I am your gain or loss/I sometimes hear you cry for the both of us/only you know if I am right for you/if I could I would give up my life for you/so scared, I'll always be, to disappoint you
