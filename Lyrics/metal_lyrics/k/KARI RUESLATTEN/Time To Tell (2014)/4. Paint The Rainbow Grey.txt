There was this one great song
I sang it low and slow
That day when the world came down
I tried to fight back
Quiet, but still strong
It was the darkest of days.

Give me my freedom,
You owe it to me
Give me my life back.

I paint the rainbow grey - my eyes see colour no more.
I dance only in my dreams - my feet move no more.
My hands only come alive when I cry, and I am all cried out

I will not forget
Nor will I regret
I did what I had to do

I give you this promise,
I will go on
I will find new life.

I paint the rainbow grey - my eyes see colour no more.
I dance only in my dreams - my feet move no more.
My hands only come alive when I cry, and I am all cried out
