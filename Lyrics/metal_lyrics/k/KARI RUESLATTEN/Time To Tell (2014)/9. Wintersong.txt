I go back to the place I was born
Between love and hate I am torn
I'm not turning back, I'm not turning back now
I let go of your warm hand

Life has changed from where I stand
I'm not turning back, I'm not turning back now
But I don't think that you will agree to hear me -
I don't think that you will agree

Here's a winter song
Here's for those who long
For brighter days and summer haze
I cannot lay, I cannot longer wait
This time of year you will find me here
With my shattered dream -
Things are not as they seem
An unbeliever's only wintersong

There was a time when I could hear you say
Life is nothing if you don't stay
I'm not turning back, I'm not turning back now
You're looking good as I'm about to leave
Nothing here, nothing more to achieve
