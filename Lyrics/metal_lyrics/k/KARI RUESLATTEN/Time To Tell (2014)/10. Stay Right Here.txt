I am so glad you came around/I know I said I needed space/I take that back I am not wasting precious time/now that I've found you, I'll let you disappear/I can't believe I almost let you walk out of there/let me take you to the shore/leave the world behind/I know I'm asking much of you and patience is hard to find/you look different than before/sorrow in your eyes/if I could I'd take back the hurting and the lies/come night or come day/I want you to stay/stay awake, stay afloat, stay right here with me/you said my heart was made of stone/you could not reach inside my head/I am so sad about those days and for not seeing who you were
