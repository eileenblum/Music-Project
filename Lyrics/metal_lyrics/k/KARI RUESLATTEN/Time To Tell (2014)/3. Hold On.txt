you were the dancer in the dark/found ways to seize a spark/even when the world came tumbling down/you left this place would not return/in a while I got to learn/they had come to take you away/standing still in the faint sunset light/I still see your shape/you have to hold on/when all you see is gloomy days/you tend to hide your face/you will always be the same to me/I won't let them take you away this time, don't let go/tonight there's a storm coming/this time it hits you so hard/all you can do is long for tomorrow/and your dreams will be made of dreams
