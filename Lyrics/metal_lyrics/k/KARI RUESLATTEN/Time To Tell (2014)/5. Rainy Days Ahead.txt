her my dear, ca you hear the rhythm in the air/the chariot is ready, now take me anywhere/riding out, fell the chill/my head against your back/there's not a single soul out there following out track/you gave so much away/now I long to hear you say: rainy days ahead - I'm no longer scared/can you feel, can you hear my heart beating when you're near/the hurting fades away/give us one more day/can you feel, can you hear my heart beating when you're near/close your eyes/make believe you're not alone tonight/I will be a shadow on your side, a quiet light
