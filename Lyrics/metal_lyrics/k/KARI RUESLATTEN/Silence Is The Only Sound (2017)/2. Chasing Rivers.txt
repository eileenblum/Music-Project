Wake me up when the sun sets in the ocean
Wake me up when I'm tearful as hell
Wake me up when I am not all broken
Wake me up when you think you can tell

I see you walk towards the door
I see you put your new boots on â then you're gone

In the frozen hills we will ride through the night
Seeing nothing but white
When the morning arrives
We will still be spending our lives going into the wild â chasing rivers

Wake me up when it's all over
Wake me up when I am coming to a standstill
Wake me up when I am bolder
Wake me up when I am bursting with goodwill
