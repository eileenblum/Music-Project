What if everything was a game to you
What if everybody else always knew
I would never be the first to know
Though, I had a doubt and I felt it grow

Oh, when the river's running wild
I've always known, since I was a child

If time was my friend I'd find you again â saviour; saviour
I never escaped, a captive to the end â saviour, saviour

What if everything was a game to me
What if all I said was a means to be free
You would never be the first to know
I would never tell, simply let go

Saviour, saviour
Saviour, saviour
