If you want to run I'll tell you where to go
I'll tell you where to hide
If you want to stay I won't be in your way
This time I have learned

I won't let you down

I'll shine a light, I'll shine a light,
I'll shine a light, I'll shine a light,
For you tonight
I'll shine a light, I'll shine a light,
I'll shine a light, I'll shine a light,
When yours fades out When we part ways

If you want to hide, your cover will be safe
I will wipe your tracks out
If you come home â you'll always have a home
You'll be in my heart

Some of the turns you make are sure to lead you astray
Some of the promises you break you will regret one day
