In a boat by the harbour came the man, he tracked me down
He said, give me a good reason to say no
I could think of a million different reasons, but anyhow
I decided to let him stay for now

I knew the stories of where he'd been
And the patterns I should have seen

Oh, if I may I'd do it all again
Down by the harbour hearts trade
Oh, if you ask I'll do it all again
Down by the harbour dreams fade, dreams fade away

Finding ways out of this maze became harder than I thought
In an alley in the dark I let it slip
If there only could be someone, just a single, friendly voice
I would never ask for more than just a sip

With my head held high and morals low
I quietly join the show
