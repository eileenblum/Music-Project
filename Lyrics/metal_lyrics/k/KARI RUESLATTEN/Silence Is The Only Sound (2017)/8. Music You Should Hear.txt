You say your mind is made up
You'll be leaving us today
I see your eyes are filled with sorrow and pain
But, you will not change your mind

There is music you should hear
It's the sound of your heartbeat
Your were my light, my destiny
Now, I'm begging at your feet

Thunder roaring in my head
Nothing will ever be the same
There will be dark clouds in the clearest sky
Will I ever understand

My love, my love, my love
