I was holding on to my Father's hand
He was made for something special and grand
He would bend his knees to kiss my forehead
And tell me to recall what he said

Please, look after Mother you are her only one
You'll be all she's got now that I am gone

As the evening falls
I can see the lights
Coming from afar
Soon winter calls
I will see you again
As evening falls

I remember the day the call came
Trying not to hear when they spoke my name
Days passed I knew what I had to say
Still I hoped to see him standing in the doorway
