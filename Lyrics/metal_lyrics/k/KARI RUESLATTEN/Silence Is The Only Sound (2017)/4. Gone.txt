Let it be sung and let it be said
I live in the dark and drink with the dead
I lie to my son I lie to my man
I live off scraps and sleep in a van

Never will I let you down
The reasons why I hide will stay unknown
Until I'm gone
You will find a better way
Let tales be told, find voices to sing
When I am gone

Fill in the void, let sinners escape
I'm ready for wine, to take on a new shape
Finally I found my promised land
It's all in my blood where the toxic is canned

I haven't seen daylight in a long time
I wait for an angel to look my way
I haven't seen daylight in a long time
I see no lanterns in the sky
