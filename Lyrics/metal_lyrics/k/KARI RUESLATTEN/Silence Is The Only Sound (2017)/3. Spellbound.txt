Take my hand, come with me
Let me take you away to a special place where we can stay
By the raging sea I came
I was washed ashore where I had not been before

Look me in the eyes
Do you see what you came for?
Would you like to see more?

Hey now we're leaving ground â I am spellbound
Once I was lost now I'm found â I am spellbound

I followed the song of the wind
Tunes floating away, voices humming through the bay
In the woods I heard the tunes
Now, I will share them with you, let them guide your way through

When you see lanterns leading way
Bridging out over sea and land
Do you see what you came for?
Would you like to see more?
