Open your eyes it's time to begin
Open your eyes and take it all in
I lit the fire and cast away stones
I heard the thieves' muttering moans

Only the lonely will fall from grace
No more an only child to embrace

I never told you before, but I'm a believer
For you I carry the cross and a crown of thorns
I never asked for more â you're the only one
For you I'd die by the sword, die by your hand

Tonight I will dance close to the flame
Tonight there's no sinners, there is no blame

You have me down on my knees
