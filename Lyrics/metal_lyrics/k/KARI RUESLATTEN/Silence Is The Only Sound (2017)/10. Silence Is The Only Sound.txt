First time you saw me, you'd never have guessed
I was homeless
I would try to make you think better of me

You would always know I was hiding the truth
Waiting for me to confess
Aching for it, never pulling out

Until I cried like a baby
It made you turn around knowing that you had won

My heart sunk like a stone
Swallowed right there, pulled under water
Without strength it shivers alone
Finding a hole in the ground
Where silence is the only sound

I was never scared of running, I ran so fast
Faster even than the boys
Still you kept on pushing
