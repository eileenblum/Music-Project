You seemed to me like a swirling dance
of windblown leaves.
When the night filled with cries
the truth lies with our love.
And we scaled the tones of sky
to find the cold blue trees.
These silent chances passed one by
were the stars shined gold.

And could you sleep when the wind blew?
When I left you, in October.
You who sat safe and warm indoors
you, who smiled.
When everyone you have loved in me is finally gone
the damage is done.
There will be no means for escaping Rome.

In the distance my heart swelled away
I strove, I strove against all past adversities.
And you were under muddy sleepless stars again.
And I was dead close
to your sleeping closed brown eyes.
So, I seemed to you like an empty street
in a vast ghost town
when the path was dark and the sky was grey.
Yes, I heard the sound.
And we scaled the shapes of clouds
to find the puddle's ground.
These silent chances passed one by
were the stars shined gold.
In the distance my heart swelled away
I strove, I strove against all past adversities.
And you were under muddy sleepless stars again.
And I was dead close
to your sleeping closed brown eyes.
In the distance my heart
tried to walk outside my chest.
And you knew, I strove against all past adversities.

And you were under muddy sleepless stars again.
And I was dead close
to your sleeping closed brown eyes.
