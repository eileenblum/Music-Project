We waited for the dawn.
You showed me understanding it was not a dream.
So close, you make me blind.
how beautiful you were.
I must have been asleep all summer long.
You found myself alone.
Sorry could I take you in my arms for another time.
Where the road turned so dark
where we kissed for the first time.
Show me how you love me apart, far away
You will have to leave.

I'll tell your ghost to let me be
when the fall will come.
Where the road turned so dark
where my heart still beats unstuck
where the dreams disappear.
I hope to live to tell my love.

I want to take you home.
Don't think it's too late?
I'll keep on holding you.
You spoke under trees again.
In a little red car, outside.
And I'm here I still hesitate.
I've lived and been disbelieved.
And now you come to me and you make me blind
I just succumb for the summer time, again.
Sorry, could I take you in my arms for another time.
I want to be asleep all summer long
I want to prove that I'm doing wrong for you.
You spoke under trees, in a little red car.
I can remember when you were so close to me.
Every nerve that hurts you healed
every kiss I gave you cried.
I am trying to forget what should not die in vain.
My hands have been tied for a long time.
I want to take you home.
It's not too late.
I keep on holding you.
