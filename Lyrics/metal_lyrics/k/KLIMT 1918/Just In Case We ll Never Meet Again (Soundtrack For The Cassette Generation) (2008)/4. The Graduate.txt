I stop believing everything will be alright
I just can see the shaping of my life.
it's hard to stand this time.
I really love to fade away in your remains.
It's my own remorse, it's my only fault.
'Cause it's a long way down.
Little girl, with dark arms
you love dancing in darkest times.
I would steal your smile (away)
losing the love I've dared.
Brown eyed girl, just graduated
you'll never understand, how much I cared
in this darkened room.
My spring matres on the floor
the lovely stain of blood
the beads of sweat.
"I love you, I adore you", you said.
You can't tear the one you love apart.
Little howlet danced in the air, you smiled
I wasn't prepared. The smell of distant fires
just look in to my desire.
Won't you be back at home tonight?
Little girl, in my arms
you loved sleepin' close to my eyes.
I would feel your warmth (away)
losing the love I've dared.
Brown eyed girl, just graduated
you'll never understand
how much I cared in this darkened room.

Feel the pain, pay the price.
I was the one who loved you the most.
Every day, and then, every night.
With you.
And you got so much faith, and then, so much life.
You make it hurt so good.
I'll stay until the end.
I've never asked you for much.
