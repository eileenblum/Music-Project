let all the songs tell you the meaning
in a world you are finding small.
Keeping your soul safe when you are bleeding inside.
But you can't forget
you can't forgive how I told you last time I saw you.
It wants to make you cry
it wants to make you swear.
I want you to know.
Every hour, every day I spent with you was forever.
My mind goes astray
I swore it would be forever.
I'm just awaking with the dusk on my eyes.
I didn't give anyone else a love like this.
Let all the clouds sing of my illusion
from a sky now it's turning blue.
Keeping my smile safe
when I am dying inside.
And I can't forget
I can't forgive how you kissed me
last time you loved me.
It wants to make me die
it wants to make me bleed.
I want you to know.

And you run through the midnight air
your adolescent dreams are gone.
Break me off a piece of that love, tonight 'cause
you can't forget
you can't forgive
how I told you last time I loved you.
I drop off these notes
I turn on the amp.
This song wants to make you cry.

And I'm bleeding through the emotions
with my music, with devotion.
I want to disappear, here in the tones.
I need you to know.
Every hour, every day I spent with you
was forever.
Always together.
My mind goes astray, I swore it would be forever.
Ever and ever.
And I'm bleeding, through the emotions with my music
with devotion.
I want to disappear, here in the tones.
I need you to know.
