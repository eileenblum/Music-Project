take what you want from this lonely night
with a gentle and demanding mouth.
Between a smile and a tear

"dne eht ot su gnirb ot seirt
yaw yklim eht ;seiks yrrats rednu
,esolc uoy dloh I."
[reverse:]
(I hold you close,
under starry skies; the milky way
tries to bring us to the end)

I'm only living to sing this song.
I'll be still and say no more.
I don't need to hear you explain

".seil ruo rof yrc
ll 'ew ,esimorp a ekam ew ;thgilnus rof
gnitiaw ,thgin eht thguorht gnitsaL .uoy si tnaw I lla ,wols gninrub ma I .evol rof evil tsuj I .emit on si ereht esuac"
[reverse:]
(cause there is no time. I just live for love. I am burning
slow, all I want is you. Lasting through the night, waiting
for sunlight; we make a promise, we'll
cry for our lies.)
