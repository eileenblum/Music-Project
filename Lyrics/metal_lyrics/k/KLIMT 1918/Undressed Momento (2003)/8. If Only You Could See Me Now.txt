It's strong in my mind
Our will to win and leave
Nature found a way today
I do whatever it take
You can't honour me
There is a first time for everything

If only you could see me now
I'm the one who set the stage
And if you think I'm inhumane
I could destroy your useless world

I was there at alone
I'll scream my name
Me with my light
You with your club

Watch the world goes by
I'm afraid but you
You violate our smile
Gonna be riot here
You better know my name
I'm sorry to say
I don't care if you die
I don't care if you live
