"Eh... Euhh!! La guerre, nâest ce pas ?
Puisque ce sang câest la guerre
que les amÃ©ricains ont prÃ©parÃ©,
et quâils prÃ©parent, Ã  piller, Ã  payer..."

And this is my four leaf clover
Gift of love of mine
Tear of meadow's fall
Scent in coldest snow

Tell her love is strong
It's strong like glance
Like wishful Lie
And my words shall rise
Through pale profiles

Body of silent childs
A world where sun can't bright
All may love is
Four leaf face of fall
To put in words

Please now leave me upset
My pale drawing time
Don't forget to prompt
You will never die

Leave the fall, reach up and find her
Tell my love about the future
Prompt me you'll kiss her fingers
You will be the wishful pain's chord

I believe in snow blood's fall
Crows the sing upon the stars
Grey the face I hurt you feel the leaves

Tell her sky was cold and
Eyes were snow in blood this view
And my empty sight was pale profile

Body of silent child
A world where sun slow died
All may love was
Fourth leaf face of fall
And nothing else

Baby
Leave the fall of thanks in the night
Save you
