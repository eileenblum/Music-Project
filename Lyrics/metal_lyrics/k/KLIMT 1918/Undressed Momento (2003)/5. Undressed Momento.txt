Drops of light on naked lies
Don't you understand?
We believe in calm of march

I'm taking my time to dress and leave
Words on the wall
You don't have to explain

Now help me pray for teenage lie
You said you would, right?
Wahrheit* it is deaf, Wahrheit it is done
You said you could, right?

I'm searching the right words to remain
Don't you understand?
We are pregnant with all this...

[*Note: Wahrheit means "truth" in German]
