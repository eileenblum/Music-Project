Speaking the mourning
Your breathe on my mouth
And lightbulb hole
For you I'll find my name.
Winter is gone we just fly in the dust
In the warm flat plaid
When you call my name,
When I see your smile again

And now.
There are no more walls
In your room
No bed no clothes
We need just teen's like times

Wake up
And open wide the hymns to hide
Today you take we by the hands to stay

And maybe it's just a dream
The dream that smells
Like winter's night
We can't

Oh we can't believe
Tone of grey on mouth so close
Is it just a spell
Is it just your smell
Why I saw your smile again?

Oh girl
We fear the sounds of time
We tear our bad shaped lies
No we won't believe

Oh day
We lead a simple life
We pay a common price
No doubt,
We need just teen's like lies.
