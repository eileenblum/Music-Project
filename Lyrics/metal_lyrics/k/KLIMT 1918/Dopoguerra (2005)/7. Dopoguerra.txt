City walls are coming down
It's a brand new world's deep sound
Sleeping under these remains
And I guess I could be wrong
Time ago all hope was gone
Moving lips to breath that time
No murder by the light of sun
I've only come to see it shines
Please let me take a bite of cloud
Time for romantic view
In the halflight were I stand
Roma rises from the pink
It's a slice of light that brings me hope
Moving lips to breathe worm joy
Silent wishful noise
Though the dust red buildings kiss the sky
And I know it's time to run,
To forgive the burning rain
'twist your head in wind', yeah someone says
And I try to organize,
All the tears I cried
I have lived and mourned for aftermath
Aftercare day
Aftergame time
Afterward cry
Grey hairs on my head.
See the time of youth is gone
See the rage of past is vain
Try to close your eyes and smile
(Sleeping) under these remains
