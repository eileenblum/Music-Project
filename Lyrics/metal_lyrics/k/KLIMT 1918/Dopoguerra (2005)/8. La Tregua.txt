And I try, and I try, and I try
To forget dead friends
Just a goodbye
Should I stay, should I pay
Can't go back
I know life goes on, it's too late
I'm holding on, the smell of need
I'm carring on, down on my knees, yes I try
To come with you
The long lost friend, endtime
They sleep in mud
Who's got the right to survive?
I'm holding on...
