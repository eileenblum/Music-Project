U.S.A. flag burns on the ground
There is a girl in Rafah, she's 23 years old, you can see
She stares at fire with Gaza kids
Freedom calls they wonder
Yanqui girl, what a wonder!
There is a girl dancing with muslim girls
There are people having no faith in you
She had to tell you just how tired she feels
There's no solution I'm wishing my day away (away)

Every night that I come near her I swear
I'll protect her when with faith we face the day
Every tear she cries for the city's ruins
I'll be fighting for, I'll be stronger for,
I'll be loving her, I'll be young no more
The day is come, she smiles with care
And rays above, the hands in hair
'Don't watch me shake, the night was cold
And nightmare ends, Don't worry up'.
'I'll steal my life for you
That's all right if sun will shine'
Rachel closes her eyes, she's an open page
She's afraid of war. She feels so much rage

I see the truth behind the lies
This heart won't let me go
On the side streets I walk
City's ruins with pale delight
Death will be coming
Death is coming
Oh, don't ask me how I felt her life is being broken
Running through the kids, outside the play, I see their joy
Death is down at the end of the street. It brings me on my knees
But I live in a world where nobody loves, nobody hopes
Nobody loves, nobody hopes
'Please hold me there, don't let me fall'
She says; her skin dirty with mud,
'I hold you love, like a wounded bird
I won't let you fall!', I scream with pain
Rachel knows her blood still runs
The ground turns red so close my arms
I see the sun going down her eyes
She won't forget to sleep with me tonight
