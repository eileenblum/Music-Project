Here comes the lipgloss, the brand name of their age
Roomates just paint love, eye shadow turns to pink
Boys have a crush on the teenage da - da girls
Tonight with shaking hands their red ties
Young people dance
Undressed
With tears hidden in their eyes
And with fear they pretend to embrace
Drunken harms at night
'You can take me in your hands' they say
Kissin' with lines of escape in mouth
Comin' home late at late night to cry in front of their mirrors
Bitter sweet girls have a secret wish
Lonely boys have not the heart to phone
Love inside won't let them back to sleep
They have lost control
Take a second to say goodbye and then
Please don't bite your lips when you walk alone
Youth, time is coming
Because of you tonight
I feel life, I choose pain
I give up nostalgia
Now help me pray for you
Don't cry for yesterday
Stay wild another time
Carry on this mortal coil
