I feel so hungry and you're such a treat
Unwrap the candy ooh it tastes so sweet
My engine roars every time you turn the Key
Foot to the floor, now you're drivin' Me

Ha ha - what you doing?
Ah ha don't take it away
Ha ha I got a burnin' desire

[Chorus:]
Feels good don't stop
Feels good don't stop
Feels good don't stop
Feels so good

Sa sa sexual tension, can't you sense my heat
Fu fu frustration, don't get cold feet
Take me, shake me, break me
Make me be your slave
Standing at attention - got to give what I crave

Ha ha where you goin'
Ah ha why take it away?
Ha ha don't put out the fire

[Chorus]

Feels good - don't Stop feels good
Feels so good
