1 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
Well this ain't Heaven and this ain't Hell
Just somewhere in between
An awesome sight, it's dynamite
Like nothing that you've ever seen

[Chorus:]
With a mighty roar, fists to the floor
Don't blame it on the toys
Don't blame it on the noise
Blame it on the boys
If it's too Loud you're too old
If it's too Loud you're too old

I rip another note from my throat
A screaming guitar wails
Ears will bleed it's guaranteed
We deal in volume sales

[Chorus]
