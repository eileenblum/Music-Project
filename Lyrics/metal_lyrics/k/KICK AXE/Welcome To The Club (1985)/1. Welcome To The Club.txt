Now when he was young and a crazy reckless boy
He was out to get his kicks, he was out to enjoy
If it gave him pleasure, if it got him high
If it makes him cool it was worth a try
But now he's getting older and wiser than before
He guards his pleasures behind closed doors
Now the things he needs to get him through the day
Are costing him a price he'll have to pay

[Chorus:]
If the habit's hard to break
Welcome to the club
If the pressure's hard to take
Welcome to the club
If you've had your share of heartaches
Welcome to the club

Now you say you can't live with it
But you can't do without
The mirror looks back you're filled with doubt
So you take the blows while you're takin' all you can
Join us at the club, we understand

[Chorus]
