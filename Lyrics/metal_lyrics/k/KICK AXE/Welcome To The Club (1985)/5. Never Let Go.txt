When all the walls come crashing down
And the whole world turns upside down
When everyone else who was here is gone
And the dusk never makes it to the dawn
Whatever happens, you'll see
There'll still be you and me

When silence is the only sound around
And darkness descends with no light to be found
When all the other reasons have faded away
The last flame flickers, embers turn to grey
A single spark still lingers on
Still - you and me

[Chorus:]
Baby it's something we've both come to know
Hold me and never let go
Baby as Night falls the closer we grow
Hold me and never let go
Oh ooh oh, never let go
When all the walls come crashing down
And the whole world turns upside down

Baby it's something we've both come to know
Hold me yeah yeah
Baby as Night falls, the closer we grow
Hold me and never never let go
Hold me and never let go, never let go
Whatever happens, whatever happens, you'll see
Something we've both come to know
Hold me and never never let go
