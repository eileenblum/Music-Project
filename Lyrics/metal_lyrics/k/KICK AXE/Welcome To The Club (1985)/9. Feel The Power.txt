Feel the vibration so electric
It can really shake you down
This current flows inside of me
It's like a shock wave underground

I feel my blood surge, I feel my primal urge
I feel the power
I'm set to catch fire, I'm on a live wire
I feel the power

I'm like a ten-foot tidal wave
No one can save me from myself
I'll take my chances, roll the dice, no advice, no help

[Chorus:]
My heart's in overdrive, I'm feeling so alive
I feel the power
It's like a guiding hand, part of a higher plan
I feel the power
Well I can't see the future, but I can forget the past
The lessons I remember never slowed me down
From growing up too fast

[Chorus]

My heart's in overdrive, I'm feeling so alive
Like a guiding hand, part of a higher plan
Power ....
