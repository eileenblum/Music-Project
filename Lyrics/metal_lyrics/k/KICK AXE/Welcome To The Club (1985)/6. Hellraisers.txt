Step aside, run and hide
The beast has broken loose from inside
See me laugh, hear me howl
It won't be silent till I'm satisfied

I feel the heat
I got the fever
This fire's outta control

That's what I am
That's what I like
That's what I call Rock and Roll

[Chorus:]
Like demons running wild, we were born to be Hellraisers
Like every mother's child born to be Hellraisers
Born to be Hellraisers

Listen up, fill my cup
And keep a pourin' till It overflows
On the run let's go
I'll take you to my pleasure zone

I feel the heat
I got the fever
This fire's outta control

That's what I like

That's what I am
I am Rock and Roll

[Chorus]
