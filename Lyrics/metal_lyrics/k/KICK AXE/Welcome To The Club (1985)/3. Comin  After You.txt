Endless highways, following the sun
Flying by the light of the moon
A caravan of renegades a band On the run
Knowin' city lights will be visible soon
And as we drive down Broadway
The word's on the street
On the lips of everyone you meet

[Chorus:]
Comin' after you the boys are back in town
Comin' after you we're gonna rock till the roof comes down
Comin' after you the boys are back in town
Comin' after you we're gonna rock till the roof comes down

Close to touch down, the moment has arrived
Electric charge is in the air
We'll raise our voices to the night to show that we're alive
They're gonna hear our cry everywhere
You know our reputation
Cause good news travels fast
And you know we've got the right to rock at last

[Chorus]

And as we drive down Broadway
The word's on the street
On the lips of everyone, of everyone,
Here we come everyone, we're comin' after you

[Chorus]
