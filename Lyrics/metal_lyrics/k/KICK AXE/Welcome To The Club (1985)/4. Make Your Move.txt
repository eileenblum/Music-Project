It's the name of the game
We're all standin' in the middle of the firing range
Oh the line, outta time
And surrender is the ultimate crime
No mistake - got to take
The winners aren't the ones
Who wait around for the breaks
So, don't choke - go for broke

Or you may watch your dreams go up in smoke
The joke's on you if you try to hide from the truth
Your number is up
All eyes on you

[Chorus:]
It's time to make your move
Prove what you've gotta prove
Make no excuse
It's time to make your - it's time to make your move

Take your place, in the race
If you don't step on it, it'll be a waste
Don't hold back - hit the track
Pedal to the metal on the attack
Grab your fun while you're still young
Don't stop playin' till the game is won
Can't wait - or hesitate
If you don't act now, it's gonna be too late

The joke's on you
If you try to hide from the truth
Your number is up
All eyes on you

[Chorus]
