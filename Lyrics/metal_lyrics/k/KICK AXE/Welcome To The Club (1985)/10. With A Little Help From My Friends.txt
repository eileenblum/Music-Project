What would you do if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

[Chorus 1:]
I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

Who do I do when my love is away
Does it worry you to be alone
How do I feel by the end of the day
Are you sad because you're on your own

[Chorus 2:]
Do you need anybody
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love

Would you believein a love at first sight
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light
I can't tell you but I know it's mine

[Chorus 3:]
Do you need anybody
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love

I get by with a little help from my friends
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends
