Sweet nothing - what's sweet about that
What's the sense in holdin' it back
I'm fired up baby let's ignite
You say "maybe" honey I say "now"
Don't go sayin' that you don't know how
The sooner we do it - the sooner we'll be doin' it right

[Chorus:]
Cause you can't take it with you
Give it up tonight
You can't take it with you
I can't resist you
While the beat's getting stronger
Came to enlist and you can take it with you
Don't fight

All the rockers with their hands held high
We'll be rocking till the day we die
Join us baby we'll party to the bitter end
And who knows what tomorrow may bring
We'll take a shot at everything
And after we do it, let's do it all again

[Chorus]

No you can't take it with you
You can't take it with you

Don't fight
