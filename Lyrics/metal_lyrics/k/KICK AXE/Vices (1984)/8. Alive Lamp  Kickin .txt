Cut it
You've
Got your arm around
All the rules are gone
We're gonna get away with anything
this time

And whole responsibility
Lose all your sensibility
Come on let's break the law and commit a crime

Alive and Kickin'
(Let all hell break loose)
Alive and Kickin'

Time
It's standin' still tonight
shine
All the metals gleaming bright
We're gonna get away with anything
This time

Alive and Kickin'
(Let all hell break loose)
Alive and Kickin'

Alive and Kickin'
(Let all hell break loose)
Alive and Kickin'
