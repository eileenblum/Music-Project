Well hey have you seen her
She's all over town
Oh hey have you seen her
She sure gets around
All those talks about her
There she's goes

Who will the next clown yeah
Well here she comes

She don't have to try
All the right moves

All the right moves
Sparks will fly

Whoa check out that move

She holds you breathless
Since the first time you look
Once you're in her spell
Your tables booked
Then she laughs
Cause now you're hurt
Yeah, you know you're hurt
But here she comes

She's got all the right moves
She don't have to try
All the right moves

She loves to tease
She won't be satisfied till you're on your knees
She drives you crazy
She does it with ease
Listen boys (what) she's hot

She's got all the right moves
She don't have to try
All the right moves
She walks by
All the right moves
Sparks will fly
