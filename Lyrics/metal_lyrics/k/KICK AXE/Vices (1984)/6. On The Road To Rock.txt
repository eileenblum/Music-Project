I see it
Start your motor, people let's go
You can feel it, let It go
I wanna hear you shout (hey) shout it out loud
I wanna hear you scream and scream that I'm proud

Get on the road to rock
Get on the road to rock

Old town, down town, night life's hot
Rock and Rollers givin' all they got
Open it up and feel the heat
Get off your chairs and on your feet

Get on the road to rock
Get on the road to rock

Fire it up
Overloaded floor
Need explosives to get in the door
Make sure we do it, do it up right
Do it again and again every night
Get on the road to rock
Get on the road to rock

Fire it up
Out of your car
Ready to fire, this is why
We couldn't get much higher
Take it to the edge make it forever make it last
Get on the road to rock
Get on the road to rock
Fire it up
Yeah fire it up all around the room
Feel like steel, fills me up
Not about tonight, we don't care
Feel like steel, inside of me yeah
At the back wall hear them screamin'
Get on the road to rock
Get on the road to rock

Come on follow me
Fire it up
