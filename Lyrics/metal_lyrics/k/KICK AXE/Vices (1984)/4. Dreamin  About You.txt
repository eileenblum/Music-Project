Beyond the words
Of beauty and desire
A memory of you
Sets me on fire
Your voice was magic
Your eye's will paralyze
I fell out of your spell
I was mesmerized

[Chorus:]
I wish you would make it real
(Dreamin' about you)
If only you knew that I was
(Dreamin' about you)
If my wishes could come true
(Dreamin' about you)
You've got to got to know That I am
(Dreamin' about you)

Even when your heart
I could not find
I keep you locked up
Inside my mind
You dance through my thoughts
All of the time
To want someone this bad
Just must be a crime

[Chorus]

Dreamin' about you
Every day and every night

[Guitar Solo]

Oh life's Just a battle
I fight it every day
Sometimes I wonder
If it's worth it to stay
But when I'm down
It's you I'm thinking of
Someone special
Somebody I can love

[Chorus]
