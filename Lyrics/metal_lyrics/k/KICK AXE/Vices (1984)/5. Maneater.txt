Look at whose coming now movin' Lion unleashed
Lickin' her lips she's ready to begin her feast
Hips cocked in a Tailspin knees scrapin' on the floor
Know just what to give her as she screams and begs for more

Maneater
Insatiable lust for flesh
Maneater
I saw you run screamin' on off

She's cruel sly and shameless and she's always on the prowl
Looking longing, sets her sights and so she growls
Sinkin' up Inside your hands run through your hair
Know just when to give In when she drags you to her lair

Maneater
An insatiable lust for flesh
Maneater
I saw you run screamin' on home

Maneater
An insatiable lust for flesh
Maneater
I saw you run screamin' on home
