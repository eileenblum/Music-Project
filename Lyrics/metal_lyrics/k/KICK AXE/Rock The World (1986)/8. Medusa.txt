Just how many men, have paid the price of your gaze?
An how many blinded heroes spending lost days in your maze
It's power it's reflection, your image was shown
I turned turned around then,
I turned to stone...

Look in your eyes
I was told not to Look
Look in your
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
And anywhere I go I see your eyes

I've been sentenced for a life in a frozen trance
And I'm doing time for a single stolen glance

Look in your eyes
I was bold enough to look
Look in your eyes
Now I'm stone cold from the look
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
And anywhere I go I see your eyes

Look in your eyes...

I guess that I've learned my lesson too late
Now I've seen your vision and it's sealed my fate
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
And anywhere I go I see your eyes

Every time I dream I see your eyes
Forever I know, I'll see your eyes,
Everywhere I go...
