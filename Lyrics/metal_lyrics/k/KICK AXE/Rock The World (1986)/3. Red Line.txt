Here I am,
Standing in the rut again,
In the man,
I tell you where and when

Oh 'cause I got the fire,
A hearts desire,
Raging passion gone out of control,
I mean what I say,
And I'm taking it all the way

I'm running a red line,
I'm running a red line,
If I'm running free,
I'm obviously,
Running a red line

All floors,
Rocking in my heart again,
Just the night before,
Brings me pleasure of pain,
Again and again so,
Get the message,
And clear the wreckage,
To one man's chance to hit the road,
I mean what I Say,
I dreaming all the way

I'm running a red line,
I'm running a red line,
If I'm running free,
I'm obviously,
Running a red line

I'm running a red line,
I'm running a red line,
If I'm running free,
I'm obviously,
Running a red line

I'm running a red line,
I'm running a red line,
If I'm running free,
I'm obviously,
Running a red line
