We sense the mighty swarm,
Right like before
We hear the thunder knocking down the front door
The threat is near,
We'll take no more
We close our gates now,
It looks like war

Call for the heroes,
We need you now,
Life's on the line,
No time to wonder why,
Nowhere to run or hide
Warrior
No time to wonder why
Warrior

With all their forces, they have come to our shores
We offer peace to them but still they want war
They bring destruction,
Like those before,
They must have known, what we have in store

Call for the heroes,
We need you now,
Life's on the line
No time to wonder why,
Nowhere to run and hide
Warrior,
No time to wonder why
Real hopes, we need you Now,
No plan to run and hide,
Warrior

Only you can save us
Only you can save us
Only you can save us
Only you can save us
Warrior
No time to wonder why
Real hopes, we need you now
Warrior
Nowhere to hide
Warrior
