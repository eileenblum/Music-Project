In this place I am one with the sound,
Just one last chance I hope you can be found,
In my dreams I hunger after you,
If only you would make my dreams come true,
There must be some way I can break through,
All these things that still keep me from you

Don't fade away,
Don't fade away,
Devachan

Your the only one that holds the key,
Here's the lock, release my fantasy

Don't fade away,
Don't fade away,
Devachan

I hear you,
I'm near you,
Don't fear of you,
Devachan
Devachan

Finding you here in my dreams I shall harbour for you,
The only one pleasing you making my dreams come true,
Feeling you near As this place becomes one with the sound,
I still hear your echoing voice,
It's crying out

Don't fade away,
Don't fade away,
I hear you
I'm near you,
Don't fear of you,
Devachan

I hear you,
Devachan
I'm near you,
Devachan
I fear of you,
Devachan
I hear you,
Devachan
