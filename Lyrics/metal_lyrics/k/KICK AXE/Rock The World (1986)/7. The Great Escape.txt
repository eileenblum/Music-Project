We may not make it,
We're running, running for our lives
Our freedoms at stake and time is on our side
Break the chains and over the wall
Hide in the shadows we'll fool them all,
The siren sounds and the chase is on

The chase is on it's the great escape
(Wake up)
Oh, oh

We've made our break
Now we're running, running for our lives
No more rules and no more time to ( ? )
Cross the line, follow me
What we've got to do might set us free,
The siren sounds and the chase is on

[Chorus]
