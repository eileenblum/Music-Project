Can you draw the picture of darkness 
And write a poem of misery 
Can you make a child happy 
Who died of poverty 

You watch the naughty life 
And sing the grievous songs 
Rebel against the violence 
The name of the game: Be quite! 

Ooooo- naughty life 
Ooooo- grievous songs 

You tell me which is bad 
To want or to beg 
You tell me which is right 
To be quite or to fight 

Let's destroy the kingdom of the thieves 
Altogether tonight 
Let's hoist the flag of the honour in the wind 
Light the darkness of the night 

Ooooo- naughty life 
Ooooo- grievous songs 

You tell me which is bad 
To want or to beg 
You tell me which is right 
To be quite or to fight 

Let's destroy the kingdom of the thieves 
Altogether tonight 
Let's hoist the flag of the honour in the wind 
Light the darkness of the night
