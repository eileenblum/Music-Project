When the bells ring 
The sun will shine 
With our songs 
You'll be back 

Balance of the justice 
Never been right 
War beats peace 
Dark beats light 

Wipe our wet eyes 
Light our sinner spirits 
And forgive us 
Prince of lights 

Tears of the angels 
Are walking on the sky 
Darkness clouds 
Vultures fly 

Wipe our wet eyes 
Light our sinner spirits 
And forgive us 
Prince of lights
