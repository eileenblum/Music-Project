I see the burnt tears and pain 
Little heart runs after the life 
I see the lost dreams and misery 
Little heart now shout in the night 

I hear the burnt scream and cries 
Little heart fight against to fire 
I listen to hell and angels laments 
Little heart now shout in the night 

Stars light on his way 
Angels are friends of his soul 
Now little heart leave the life 
With winds of doom 

I hear the entreaties and prayers 
Little heart fight for its life 
I listen to anger of fire 
Little heart now shout in the night 

Stars light on his way 
Angels are friends of his soul 
Now little heart leave the life 
With winds of doom
