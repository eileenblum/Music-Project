A strong king, called Gilgamesh 
More enpowered, more men in trash 
Destiny sends him Enkidu 
The invincible enemy, beloved friend 
And sign for death! 
Gilgamesh wants to live forever 
In spite of inevitable real death 
Cannot meet his destiny 
Afraid like every wretched 
Gilgamesh wants to be immortal 
In spite of the "law of life" 
Cannot meet his poverty 
He believes in this LIE! 
Mortal 
Madness 
Wretched 
-- to give up pray as lost! 
Gilgamesh, running after immortality 
Gilgamesh, fugitive of destiny 
King Gilgamesh! 
Gilgamesh, behind immortality 
Gilgamesh, fugitive of destiny 
King Gilgamesh!
