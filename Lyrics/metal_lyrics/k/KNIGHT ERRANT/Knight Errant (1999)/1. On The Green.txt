We were young, we loved the life 
Listened to the stories on the green 
Both of good and bad are on the same scale 
This we had listen till the end 

There was always war, we looked at with wet eyes 
Red on the green, good on the green 
There was always war, but life still goes on 
Not released to, we grew and don't believe no more 

If there is good, it never existed 
Their lives are short just like butterflies 
A dry peace of wood warmed us 
Till the sun embraced us through the night 

There was always war, we looked at with wet eyes 
Red on the green, good on the green 
There was always war, but life still goes on 
Not released to, we grew and don't believe no more
