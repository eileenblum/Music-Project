Never give up from your way
If you want you can make
If you have love like your hate
You can win

Tell me how did they brake you
Your guitar witness' to your tears
Who demolished sand castles
Are never to forgive

Don't lose your hope
No pain no gain
If you believe
You can arrive to the rainbow

Hold your dreams
Touch your sun

Run to the place where white gulls fly
Magic melodies will wait for you
Trust your hearts force don't fear of silence
You believe that

Don't lose your hope
No pain no gain
If you believe
You can arrive to the rainbow
