Nothing's like it appears 
Good people has nice things I said 
I know everybody is hero of the endless story 
Even if we are death 

Because there are no perfect people 
in the world 
Just the perfect intends 
Nothing's like it appears 

Remembering is nice like a life 
If forgetting is a pain like that 
Hate is a pain like death 
If the love is sweet like a life 

Nothing's like it appears... 

I would not remember the smelt of flowers 
The heat of the sun and the beam of the fullmoon 
And how I fright the end of innovations 
And I fought to be alive, nothing's like it appear 

Remembering is nice like a life 
If forgetting is a pain like that 
Hate is a pain like death 
If the love sweet like a life 

Nothing's like it appears...
