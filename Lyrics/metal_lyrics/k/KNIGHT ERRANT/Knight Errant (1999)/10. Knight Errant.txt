Don't have a pain because of your past and future 
No one has a time machine 
Trust your heart when you fall in confusion 
There must be a simply way 
You will have to make a choice in faith 
Taking something means giving something 
Don't have a fear 
I'm gonna say 
Just look around yourself 
No one has an aim 
Don't be afraid about a coming loneliness 
Always think you have yourself 
Trust your mind when you fall in confusion 
You know there is a simply way 
You had had to make a choice in faith 
You losed something, but you earned your life! 
Knight Errant is just a symbol 
You don't need it to've explained 
Knight Errant is just a symbol 
Be yourself and stay yourself
