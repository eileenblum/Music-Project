The other part of my soul is screaming wildly 
I want to have light dreams the other part is crying 
Those who reach the highest are living the pink hell 
Instead of accept the truth, overdose in my vein 

White terror- A wild story 
White terror- Overdoses 
White terror- Pink hells story 
White terror- Touch him 

I want to find someone my eye lids are dark 
My chest is transparent, overdose to my young years 
Those who reach the highest are living the pink hell 
Instead of accept the truth, overdose in my vein 

White terror- A wild story 
White terror- Overdoses 
White terror- Pink hells story 
White terror- Touch him 

They are calling you 
Don't you hear it 
You have to find someone 
The circle is closing 
and you will die 
Walk to this side 
The other part of your soul is crying 
I hear it, I feel it- Touch him. 

White terror- A wild story 
White terror- Overdoses 
White terror- Pink hells story 
White terror- Touch him
