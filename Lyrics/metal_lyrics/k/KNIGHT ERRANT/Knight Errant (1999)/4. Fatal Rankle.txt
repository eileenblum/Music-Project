After the lost sun frozen looks to the calm lake 
Before blood on our blades dries we want to break fire 
But shit, death is darkness, killing is an annihilate 

By Gods scream our hearts will rebelfighting to violence 
Before blood on our blades dries we want to break fire 
But shit, death is darkness, killing is an annihilate 

War is slaught, war is killing 
While kill live, while live kill 
War is slaught, war is killing 
While kill live , while live kill 

Before red and green open arrive to the rainbow 
If bodies die non-stop too, before the honour crushed 
Before blood on our blades dries we want to break fire 
But shit, death is darkness, killing is an annihilate pWar is slaught, war is killing 
While kill live, while live kill 
War is slaught, war is killing 
While kill live , while live kill
