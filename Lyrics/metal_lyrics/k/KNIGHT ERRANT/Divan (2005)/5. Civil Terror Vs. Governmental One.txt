Ain't it this world presenting a foolish fiction spreading like cancer? Civil terror vs. Governmental one, vice versa... Ain't it this world we are living in, and suffering in silent cries? Words of wisdom, my dear friend, lies in wetness of the tears on your pillow...

You have been called
For common good,
Just need to know
How you explode.
In the name of human rights
Hygenic slavery strikes:
Distilled and bottled 3rd world blood.

None will ever see
Until eternity
Corrosive poisons spread
None will ever think
To stop this terror
Everywhere in everyone

Ain't it this world we're living in
And suffering in silent cries?
Ain't it this world we're living in
And suffering in silent cries?

Security reasons all around
Are squeezing human races liberty
In the name of human rights
Hygenic slavery strikes:
Distilled and bottled 3rd world blood.

None will ever see
Until eternity
Corrosive poisons spread
None will ever think
To stop this terror
Everywhere in everyone

Ain't it this world we're living in
And suffering in silent cries?
Ain't it this world we're living in
And suffering in silent cries?
