Demon in your soul
Won't guide you to enlightenment
Demon in your soul will show the truth
In bits and pieces
In hallucinative ways
In your nightmares
As real as your tears
And your fear
Demon in your soul is frightening
That you enlighten and realize
He is no one but you
No one but you
No one but
Kill the cop in your head
For your enlightenment
'cause you are the only guardian
Kill the cop in your head
For your enlightenment
So you can be your savior.
Waiting for a hero...
Waiting for tomorrow...
Will cause you only sorrows
Act before it's too late forever
Waiting for miracles...
Waiting for oracles...
There's no way to the past
Face your fear, it's now or never!
Never!
