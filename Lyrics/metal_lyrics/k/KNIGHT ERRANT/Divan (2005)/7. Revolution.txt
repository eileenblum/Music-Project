You can help him as you help me
Even when you think that your target is far
When you look at the horizon
Listen to your heart
And walk through awakenings
Listen to your heart
And fight!
Revolution:
The place where the hearts fight
Revolution:
The time when the eyes talk
Revolution:
Embodiment of freedom flowing in your soul
Why are you running away
When it's almost achieved
Trust yourself, once in your life
"It's the mainpoint!"
Go and tell that you love
Don't hide your tears
Because nothing is lost
Listen to your heart
And walk through awakenings
Listen to your heart
And fight!
Revolution:
The place where the hearts fight
Revolution:
The time when the eyes talk
Revolution:
Embodiment of freedom flowing in your soul
