You'll understand the worth of dreams
By disappointment and reformation
If your hopes are pressed by lights and shadows
You must survive, or you will die

The heart of lights and shadows
Lives free and honourable
It's your fault to be pressed by lights and shadows
You have to face the thorny truth
You have to find the lights and shadows in you

Lights and shadows
- will be the sign of your heroes forever
Lights and shadows
- your brave heart will change the world
Lights and shadows
- your heart is the only force you will need
Lights and shadows
Oooo

What's at the end of lights and shadows?
Hope, the goodness that never dies
There ain't a place for cowards in the world
You have to face your frightened self
You have to find the lights and shadows in you
