Crawling through forest wisdom and dark
Marching across newborn living black sky
Falls on earth turning frost into ice
Living of man will burn in my eyes
With flames of fire raping moments that grows
Years and years through the centuries old
Untamend and perished secrets of mankind
Time has come what is written is done
Flames, burning my eyes, burning
Fire, takes all the strenght
From my soul fighting spirit
That trying to live, trying to breed
Trying to live
Black clouds embraces my soul slowly passing
Voices thrilling the emptiness into tomorows
Face of dying
Hear the cry, the voice of somber spirit
Looking to the cold voids of eternity
