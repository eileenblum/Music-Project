When you speak of truth
When you speak of words
Which don't come easy
Or don't get through
Face of mirror inside you
Looking one to match
When you criticise
The one at one
Moments that you hold
In your mind
Face of mirror inside you
Looking one to match
You try to hide
Run from your life
Holding back the truth
In which you felt into
Take your piece of silence
You know what is true
Don't look back
In your black hollow world
You often try to realize
Analize your mind
Face of mirror inside you
Looking one to match
Holding back, emotions hide
Empty look for faces
Face of mirror inside you
Looking one to match
