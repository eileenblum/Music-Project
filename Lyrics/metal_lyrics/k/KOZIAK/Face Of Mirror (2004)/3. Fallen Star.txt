Hidden, beneath all sadness
Restfull in my perfect world
In tranquillity bereved
Forever buried in my own fear
Can i just burn in fire
Escape eternal greed
Wash away my dreams
Flood of blood red tears
From glowing desert
Where dark mountains were formed
I am awaken, i am reborn
Like a fallen star
Into river of dreams
Like a fallen star
Away from silent screams
