Towards to reach archaic heaven
Towards the black sombre sky
In god's archaic throne called graveland
Behind the serpentine sun they're marching
To feed with colors of the sky
To walk on the same ground
Fall of the burning heaven
Burn the heaven
This part i control
With strenght of mine
Naked and dying fallen sky
They cry for night but night couldn't come
Flames of fire enslave this part of existence
This soil is still part of me
Walk the land of silence
Walk towards serpent sun
Our steps of glory gathered
Earth, water, wind and fire
