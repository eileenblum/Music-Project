I'm scared for war, the smell of blood
Agony rattles make me cry
I feel no hate for my enemy
Why should I kill ?
Why should I stay ?
Mother bring me back home
Mother take me far away

The time has come to take my leave
Don't have a grudge against me
Opportune darkness ... I'm waking up and run
Away in the silent night

Running through meadows and hills
Grass unstained and morning dew
I swear I won't
Come back in the world of steel
Finally my dream came true

Listening to the river flows
Light touch of the wind on the leafs
I escaped from the war claws
Now I will never meet the grief

Full of hazards anyway
Whether I leave or I stay
They'll catch me up
I know lot which waits for me
Death is the price but I'm free

For them I'm a coward, evil comrade
Unfit to be 'cause I've done the choice of life
I'm a deserter

[Choirs :]
Fellonia a suoi fratelli, traditore
La scelta di salvarsi, disertore
Vigliacheria vergognosa, infedelta colpevole

For them I'm a coward, evil comrade
Unfit to be 'cause I've done the choice of life
I'm a deserter
