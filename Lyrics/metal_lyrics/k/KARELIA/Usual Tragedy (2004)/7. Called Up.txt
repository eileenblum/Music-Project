My dear I've heard a piece of bad news
Events are in all the dailies
And mum is crying her eyes out
All the guys are called up at the town square
- as I will ... I have to go off to the war

My dear don't cry, don't be frightened
I won't follow the way of my dad
And I won't live apart from you

They said that we'll come back in a few days
but for the moment I have to go off to the war

This is the final stage before delight and joy

A kind of devil trial to make us enjoy

All these peaceful nights interlaced, living our carefree lives

I'll be back to you and that day, you will be my wife

It'll left a painful memory deep in our minds
