[Choirs :]
Vizi degli oumini hanno preso il sopravvento su me
Stammi vicino, non sei qui adesso, aiutami presto subito

Wandering soldiers break into that sweet home
Hidden and scared she's crying
Don't be afraid of some gallant wanderers
Just looking for a good time, trying to forget
Give us a little love
Please let us take a rest
Horrors of war are deep in our minds
Give us your sweetness, your consolation
Or we'll take them by force
Forgive my sin
God shall let me leave in peace of mind
Forget my face
You full of grace

[Choirs :]
Vizi degli oumini hanno preso il sopravvento su me
Stammi vicino, non sei qui adesso, aiutami presto subito

Come appease our lust, and look me in the eyes
Your face is tense with grief
Give us that wonder, don't force us to come to blows
Just shut up and dry your tears, take off all that clothes
Forgive my sin
God shall let me leave in peace of mind
Forget my face
Forgive my sin
