Awful sight ... among ruins and dust,
In torn dress, my beloved died in pain
Awaiting my hand to take her astray
Endless agony, crying for my guilty absence

Did we deserve such a fate
Now I'll find shelter in my hate
Sweet dreams have gone, my poor lambs among the wolves

Lord of hell,
I'm kneeling in front of you
I need a shell

Get my soul it's yours now

Lord of hell,
Lend me your force and I swear
To serve your realm

With never-ending hate
