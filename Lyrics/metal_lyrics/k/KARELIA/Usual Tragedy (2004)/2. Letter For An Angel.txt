October the 13th, we're going to the front
My dear I wish I was at home with you
This morning comrades of mine said we can begin to crow
Dirty war's over yet, just a matter of days
Walking in the mud all day, I can hear guns and distant shouts
I have no thought but for you and the cursed day I had to leave

Letter for an angel
Your words won't be carried across the skies
Letter for an angel

My love wait me for some days
On my return, in a while I hope
I'm eager to find you on my way
For a life of peace and joy
Letter for an angel

[Choirs :]
Santa Maria, dale tua benevolenza

Sunday November the 1st we got bad news from the front
We'll never finish with it, shall you still love me ?
Yesterday I had a dream of white lace and deep velvet
I have no thought but for you and the holy day we'll marry

Letter for an angel
Your words won't be carried across the skies
Letter for an angel

[Choirs :]
Santa Maria, dale tua benevolenza
Tragico destino, postuma lettera, cattivo presagio

I've gone for so many days
On my return, who can really know
If you'll be awaiting on my way
For that life of peace and joy
Letter for an angel
