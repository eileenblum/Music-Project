Faded rose in the funeral drum of daddy's grave
Bitter tears falling on the stone of daddy's grave

Mother said he will always watch over me
Mother said he will cut me off from cruel fate
She said he sits at the right of the lord
And always feels proud of me

Your life was vain
Dim recollection of you ...
Nothing remains
But golden letters on your cross

[Choirs :]
Nessuno se ne ricordera
Nessuno te ne ringraziera

As the bell's ringing victory, in pain we pray
As the crowd's singing the end of war in pain we pray

Mother said he will always watch over me
Mother said he will cut me off from cruel fate
She said he sits at the right of the lord
And always feels proud of me

Your life was vain
Dim recollection of you ...
Nothing remains
But golden letters on your cross

[Choirs :]
Nessuno se ne ricordera
Nessuno te ne ringraziera
