I hold back, no more cries
I dig your hole under moonlight
So much fear in these eyes
I'll never forget that sight

Turn of my life, burying my bride
Madness filled my brain
Obsession to settle the score

Turn of my life, hunting their vice
Madness wash my stains
With all blood that I make flow

Ever since, a wandering beast
No mercy, I've lost my sight
Have I become so blind ?

Ever since, a cold murderer
Cruelty has become my guide
Have I become so blind ?

Forgiveness in no wise
Hate and tears remain inside

Turn of my life, burying my bride
Madness filled my brain
Obsession to settle the score

Ever since, a wandering beast
No mercy, I've lost my sight
Have I become so blind ?

Ever since, a cold murderer
Cruelty has become my guide
Have I become so blind ?
