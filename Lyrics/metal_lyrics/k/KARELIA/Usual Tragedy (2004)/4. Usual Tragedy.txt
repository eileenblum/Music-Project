Autumn morning
On the tiles he's lying
Unlamented
No friend no relative
A good riddance
That cold murderer
Devil incarnate
Thank goodness he's gone
He's gone
Nobody wonders why
Even so
His sins were justified
No one knows, he was just a

Soft - hearted guy
Pleasant n' shy
No shell around and some riches inside
Panting victim of a usual tragedy
Soft - hearted guy
Wandering why
Such a cruel damnation
That was no more than a usual tragedy
The heaven.. a lie.. I've seen no god nor light
Autumn morning
On the tiles he's lying
Unlamented
Wounded to death
In his soul so frail
He turned into wild beast
Thank goodness he's gone
Nobody wonders why
Even so
His sins were justified
No one knows, he was just a
Soft - hearted guy
Pleasant n' shy
No shell around and some riches inside
Panting victim of a usual tragedy
Soft - hearted guy
Wandering why
Such a cruel damnation
That was no more than a usual tragedy
