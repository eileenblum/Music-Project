See my friend, as you've always stood in fear
You will face the coming fatal stage in a complete loneliness
Do you hope that your beloved is waiting for you
In this holy world you have in mind
Full of promises, dazzling sight

Hold fast greybeard, keep your fate
Don't think it over, you're on the right way

Baseness of this life
Weakness in your arm
In days gone by
Your feats were glorified
But you were enslaved all the same
Just a slave of time

See my friend, as you've always stood in fear
No one can remind how were done all these scars on your back
They still less know how gapping are those in your soul
My friend, in any case your time has come
With deserted funerals

Hold fast greybeard, keep your fate
Don't think it over, you're on the right way

Baseness of this life
Weakness in your arm
In days gone by
Your feats were glorified
But you were enslaved all the same
Just a slave of time
