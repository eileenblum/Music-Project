Shining iron and banners high
Enemies facing me, comrades on my side
Cross as my excuse
Crescent as their snare
How can you deny the almighty this way
You liable for all evils
Subhuman being you'll die from my sword today
No doubt you're the one to blame
Bloody iron, and silent cries
Enemy lyin on their front, comrades on their side
Cross was our excuse
Crescent was their snare
How can you deny the almighty this way
You liable for all evils
Subhuman being you'll die from my sword today
No doubt you're the one to blame
