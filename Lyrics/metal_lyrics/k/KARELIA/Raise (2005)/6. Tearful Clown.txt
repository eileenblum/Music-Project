I have to conceal from them all the pain in me
Put it into jails of my brain
Yes I know that I have no right to let them see
But it'll nibble the bars to burst in anyway
All the sweat of my life to give you a grin
Please laugh at me on TV screen
Can you see behind that smile
A face twisted with disgust
Can you hear beyond my laugh
A resonant death-rattle
I go on stage and face the void
Enjoy my show
I have to conceal from them all the pain in me
Put it into jails of my brain
I need no recognition or even small glory
Just let bring sun when in your lives it rains
All the sweat of my life to give you a grin
Please laugh at me on TV screen
Can you see behind that smile
A face twisted with disgust
Can you hear beyond my laugh
A resonant death-rattle
I go on stage and face the void
Enjoy my show
