Sweetness of velvet, toys around my bed
Put on probation but don't really care
At my call, you rushed up to see me
When darkness came I felt like naked worm
Impending danger as you closed the door
A presence around, malicious appearance
I cut off the light and hold tight the sheets
Bright eyes are still staring me
But my cries are vain
No complain could make you up by now
Watch over me
Stay with babe until morning comes
Watch over me
Keep babe in secure and warm
Now time has come to break these tender ties
Free as a bird but don't really care
At my call, the walls reverberate
When darkness comes I feel like naked worm
Impending danger and nightmarish set
In which I'll live without you for evermore
I cut off the light and hold tight the sheets
Bright eyes are still staring me
But my cries are vain
No complain could make you up by now
Watch over me
Stay with babe until morning comes
Watch over me
Keep babe in secure and warm
