Raise some dust, and raise your voice
In the crowd they'll raise their arms
Stunned and wild, stupefied
You know they won't raise an eyebrow
Raise the curtain on their fears
Raise the funds and raise an army
World will crawl, you raise your empire
Day has come yet, raise your glass
To people's inertia, following the leader
Disgraceful lackeys, greeting you with low bow
Raise their spirits, raise their hopes
You will raise the cheers in them
Stunned and wild, stupefied
Not a voice will raise in protest
Raise a smile and laugh with them
Raise their ancient guide from the dead
World will crawl, you raise your empire
Day has come yet, raise your glass
To people's inertia, following the leader
Disgraceful lackeys, greeting you with low bow
I scorn you pathetic flesh
I hate you cattle enslaved, you cardboard puppet
Witty eloquence's stronger than steel
Ultimate present from the gods
I'll lead you on the final wane
