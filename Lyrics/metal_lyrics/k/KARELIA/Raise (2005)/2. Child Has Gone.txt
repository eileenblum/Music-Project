Years have passed like centuries
Through which I lived as in dream
Futile quests and sweet delusions
Till the day I realized
Golden age's bygone
Leaving just a memory
Walked the path with such easiness
Enjoyed naive ecstasy
Haven't seen the flowing sands of time
Till the day I realized
Golden age's bygone
Leaving just a memory
Must live by my own
I just wish I've never grown
Stop that clock and
Take delight in total stagnation
Child has gone
Never to return
