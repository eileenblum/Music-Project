I feel a sense of disgust for my insane peers
Nothing is very much fun, day follows upon day
Year follows upon year
Feeling alone in the crowd, I'd rather close myself
Rot away in my shell
I just have to put up with it
But I cannot share that space with them
Cannot bear their stares
Have mercy: Just give me a hand as I'm down,
Hangin'on and waiting for the dawn
Of an other day, bright and clear
Without distress, painful headaches
It makes me wonder but my dreams have gone
In darker skies
Slumped in my armchair I rave, I'd rather close myself
Rot away in my shell
Nothing is very much fun, day follows upon day
Year follows upon year
I just have to put up with it
But I cannot share that space with them
Or even bear their stares
Have mercy: Just give me a hand as I'm down,
Hangin'on and waiting for the dawn
Of an other day, bright and clear
Without distress, painful headaches
It makes me wonder but my dreams have gone
In darker skies
No way out this time. Could just wait for the dawn.
No choice but to wait for dawn
