Lived for a long time surrounded
By numb and indifferent crowd
Wandering amid empty faces
Enslaved by shallow existence
Misunderstood, faced impassable walls
I Could not rely on anyone
I endeavoured to look like them
Played this ludicrous part in vain
Overwhelmed by the weigh of lies
Misunderstood, had to run away
Left all in this unreal comedy
Don't regret this great build-up at all
I did not exist
Now every dawn's rebirth
Released at last, I'm no longer enjailed
I start from scratch again
Surrounded by the crowd
Devoured by constant strains I knew that
I cannot live that way, amid them
Insane tricks and cynical lies
Now show's going on
But I just left the stage
I'm the one I was supposed to be
No longer enjailed
