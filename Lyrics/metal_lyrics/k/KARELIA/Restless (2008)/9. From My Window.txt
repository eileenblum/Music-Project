Look at that jerk hanginâ on his phone
Look at that gay, ridiculous heâs roaming around
Look at that junkie with exhausted veins
Look at the nigger, released nâ free from his chains
Look at that mess, look at all these stains

[Chorus:]
Lookinâ down from my window to the square
I enjoy the wallyâs fair
Iâd like to join them but I donât even dare
Look at that bitch, showinâ off her tits
Iâm gonna grab her ass nâ fuck until I break her hips
Look at her man, proud as a peacock, shininâ bright
Look at their outward bliss
The way they display simple smile
From here I see any kind of crap

[Chorus]

I wonât rise to fame nor catch the girls
Iâm out of touch, donât play the game
I withdraw to new positions
... The foetal one in such a case

[Chorus]
