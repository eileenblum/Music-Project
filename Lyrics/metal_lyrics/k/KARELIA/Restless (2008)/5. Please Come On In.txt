You break my balls
Seekinâ the truth wantinâ to know
Sit down nâ donât ask me any question by now
Just let me take you to a trip inside my brain
Please fasten seatbelt youâll know the story to the end
Twist of fate (so unfair)

[Chorus:]
Please come on in, pay no attention to the stains
Please let me show you through my brain,
Itâs a kind of Disneyland
Please take a look to my complete set of remains
Please watch your step, donât trip against
The creepy memories and blanks
Itâs funny place, do you enjoy the trip my friend?
Hang on: star attraction of the walk
Just let me take you to a trip inside my brain
Please fasten seatbelt youâll
know the story to the end
Twist of fate (so unfair)

[Chorus]

Here we are: the far end
If you feel like it my friend, open the door
Open the door my friend
(Come on sweetie, stay on my knee
... isnât that funny? [sniggering])

[Chorus]

Did you enjoy the trip my friend?
(so unfair)
You know the story to the end
(so unfair)
