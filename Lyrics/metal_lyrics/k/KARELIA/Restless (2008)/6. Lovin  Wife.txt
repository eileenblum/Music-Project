Look at you, crawlinâ on the floor
Look at you, cryinâ your eyes out
Do you still want to show off now?
Do you still want to pack your bags?
Remember the words from that guy:
âFor better or for worseâ, then try
You got to love me until I die
You got to be always on my side

[Chorus:]
Forgive me lovinâ wife
âTil the end, weâre tied
I gashed you to my lasting shame
But realize youâre the one to blame
Anything you say happens to make me mad
Iâm not such a violent man

[Chorus]

Please honey, donât go
Please donât leave me
Donât leave me now
Donât refuse or itâll be the last straw
Iâm gonna smack you just for show
Cause I kept myself in a cage
Silently wound up nâ filled with rage
Iâve tried to call you on the phone
Nobody back there nobody home
Do it again and I swear my dear
Dirty blood will pour from your nose
... Once again

[Chorus]
