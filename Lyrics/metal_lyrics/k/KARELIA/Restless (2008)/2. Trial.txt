The whole truth, who can tell?
I raise my hand and swear
(Stick to the facts, stick to the facts!)

[Chorus:]
I never slap her down, never shout at her
Never have a grudge, calm down, understand
Tolerant and stuff
I never beat for fun, your honour
I was such a cunt
(Stick to the facts, stick to the facts!)
This trial does not make sense
The whole thing is a farce
(Stick to the facts, stick to the facts!)

[Chorus]

She was blind drunk, you know the kind
I had no choice but to strike, beat her to death
She can go to hell for all I care
Your honour Iâm not to blame, itâs only right...

[Chorus]
