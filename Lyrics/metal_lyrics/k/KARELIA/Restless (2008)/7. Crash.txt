I got the courage to fuck with hell
Goinâ through the gears I rave
Itâs blowing hard through the windows
And through my mind
All around sceneryâs flashing by
Nothing left but wind in the sails
Nothing left but white rage under the veil

[Chorus:]
To crash, cleaning up from stains
To crash my way through the pain
My engineâs roaring, wheelâs going mad
Takinâ me far away, miles away
Empty bottles clinkinâ under the seats
Iâm gettinâ high but who even cares?
Iâd rather let it beyond any control

[Chorus]

As a crazy falcon divinâ onto its prey
As an idiotic Christ, laughing while people pray
As the dashboard covered with blood
Right in front of me

[Chorus]

A new roadâs open, better this way
Winds are calming down, silence at once
