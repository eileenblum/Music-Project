I wake up before morning light
Put on my shoes and tiptoe until Iâm outside
Silence and dark all around
I just hear my steps while starinâ at the frost on the ground

[Chorus:]
A lifetime on the assembly line
Restless, restless
Wrenchinâ pieces of human rights
Restless, restless
I wake up before morning light
Just like yesterday and tiptoe until Iâm outside
Silence, dark nâ frost on the ground
Am I really bend my steps towards the workinâ town?

[Chorus]

Monday: assembly line
Tuesday, it drains my strength
Wednesday, I just feel the void, go on...
Thursday: assembly line, restless
Friday, I go crazy my brainâs startinâ to faint away
Saturday, I lost my soul...
... Sunday at last....

[Chorus]
