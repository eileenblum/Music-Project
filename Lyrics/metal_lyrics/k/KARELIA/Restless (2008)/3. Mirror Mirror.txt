Iâve sensed the end for several weeks
Youâre right: youâd better leave me now
Be sure Iâll call you a bitch
As soon as youâll close the door
My lilâ honey

[Chorus:]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Mirror, mirror tell me how
Could I get better and reach full growth
How could I get through the thorns
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Have you ever seen a pawn?
Full of regrets, pain nâ groans
Keepinâ all for his very own
My friends will prove me right, and yours
Will always be siding with you
Be sure youâll shake your hips with lust
When Iâll be rolling about in dirt

[Chorus]

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Did I deserve such a whore?
Would I resolve the doubt with a... BANG

[Chorus]
