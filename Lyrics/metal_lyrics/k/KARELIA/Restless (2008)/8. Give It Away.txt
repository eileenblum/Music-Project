Please give it away, confess once for all
Good pretending but useless to lie,
Understanding as Iâm burninâ inside
Please give it away, from who was that call?
Is he well-built, brighter than I am?
Did he touch you, have you been at bed?

[Chorus:]
Please give it away, and bring me down
Bring me down itâs only right
Please give it away, is he slim nâ tall?
Is he well-built, brighter than I am?
Did he touch you, have you been at bed?
If you tell me thereâs another guy / If you tell me that youâd like to try
If you tell me that Iâm not the first: If you recognized you did me dirt
If you let me see under the couch
Hidden here, hidden there, back in the wardrobe
I see that youâre scared but youâre lying
Donât try to fuck around
I see clear and if Iâm right
Iâm sure Iâll lose my grip
Without you, fuckinâ slut, life doesnât make any sense
Iâll kill myself

[Chorus]
