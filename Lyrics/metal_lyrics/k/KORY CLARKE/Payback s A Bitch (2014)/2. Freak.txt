Somebody tell me where the hell I am
Not even sure I'm in the right dimension
I'm getting lost, I'm getting lost
I don't know where the fuck I'm going any more
Feel like a motherfucking sacrifice
My brain is feeling like a bad connection
I'm messed up, I'm messed up
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing anymore
You freak me, you freak me out, you better believe it baby
You freak me, you freak me out, you take it or leave it baby
You freak me, you freak me out
You got me feeling like I'm gonna die
You're gonna put me in an institution
I'm fucked up, I'm fucked up
I don't know who the fuck I'm screwing anymore
I gotta get out, don't know where to go
Somebody push me in the right direction
I'm freaked out, I'm freaked out
I don't know how the fuck I'm dealing anymore
You freak me, you freak me out, you better believe it baby
You freak me, you freak me out, you take it or leave it baby
You freak me, you freak me out
I gotta, gotta, gotta get away
I never never wanna see you one more day
Oh no, here she comes
Oh no, here she comes
Oh no, here she comes
You freak me, you freak me out, you better believe it baby
You freak me, you freak me out, you take it or leave it baby
You freak me, you freak me out, you better believe it baby
You freak me, you freak me out
I'm freaking out, baby
I'm freaking out, yeah
Oh
Here she comes, oh no
Here she comes, oh no
Here she comes, oh no
Here she comes
