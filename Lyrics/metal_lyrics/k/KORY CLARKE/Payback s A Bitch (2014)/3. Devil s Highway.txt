The Devil's Violence old
And ending a returning
Love descends
Into the cracked windows
That no one can see truth

The beacon from God's grey arms
The metal 'ching' sound from the metal ashtray

Break through the spiderwebs that hold us down
On this devils highway
Break through the spiderwebs
That hold you down
On the devil's highway

Amazing struggle occurs the heart
Alight into endless creation
Of a pistol justice
Crime scene
Porno art

Toil grasping cry
Like a phoenix dried
Deserts lost on dead audience

Listen hard my child
Let your love run wild
There's no more spiders to hurt you

Their reign came down
When the rain came down
Rain came down
And wiped them out

The rain came down

We're the reign
That wiped them out

We're the rain that wiped the spiders out
We're the reign that wiped the spiders out

We're the rain that wiped the spiders out
Now we reign

Break through the spider webs that hold you down on the Devil's Highway
