Pissed off!

There ain't a day goes by
When my revenge ain't on
I'm a karma target from dusk til dawn
Every minute searching for revenge
Don't live on love
Because it's all been spent
Did LA time from New York City
I was in Detroit when it was hitting big
But been ripped off so many times
I'm gonna remind the assholes who did it

Payback is a bitch [4x]

Kickin' down your rotten love
I ain't no vulture meat to pray on
I never seen why you buried me
But you're going down like an autumn leaf
Hey baby how you gettin' on?
With those stickin' rats outta Chicago?
You believe what you want to believe
They're just rodents dying from some fucking disease

Payback is a bitch [8x]

So you wanna bum me out
You better fucking know what the deal's about
You wanna end me baby?
Come on and pay for the takin'!

Payback is a bitch [4x]

I'm gonna fuck your slut
I'm gonna steal your pot
Leave your corpse to rot

Payback is a bitch

Treatin' people shit
This is what you get
How you likin' it?

Payback is a bitch
