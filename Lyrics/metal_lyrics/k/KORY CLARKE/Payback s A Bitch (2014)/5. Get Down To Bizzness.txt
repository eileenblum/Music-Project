You got a long way to roll
But you ain't got the big dough
Yeah, it's what I'm telling you girl
Gotta make it another way
Try to make it with a power play
Life in eternal rage
Time to turn it off
Time to turn the page
Get down to bizness
Get down
Get down
Get down to bizness

Banks playin' what they want to pay
Then they run away with the money
I love the islands you run too
Don't want a killer comin' down
No one needs a commandant
Don't need to be locked down
Not no more

People
Get down
Get down
Get down to bizness
It's what I'm talkin' bout

You think you're well off
You think you're well off
While you're playin' golf
You think you're well off well...
Another martini

Please get down to bizness

Another days dawn
I'm getting it on
Wall Street needs a genie
The Dollar falls
Better keep me in gold
The market never believes me

The underworld rackets locked in jail
But the Corporate Mafia lives
Another riot in the street for the people key
Just as long as the people eat

I said
Get down
Get down
Get down
Get down to bizness

People people people
Get down to bizness
Get down
Get down
Get down to bizness
