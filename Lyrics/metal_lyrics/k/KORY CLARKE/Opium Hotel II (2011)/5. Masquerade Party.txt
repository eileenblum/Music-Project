[written by Gary Hood]

We're at a masquerade party
your subtle eyes
I see them shine through your disguise
How are we going to fake it
the last of ways
Growing more and more each day
I'm not just one of many faces
That look your way
It's not my way to throw away
We might not see what it could be like
it's all I wore
I leave my lights on my back door
