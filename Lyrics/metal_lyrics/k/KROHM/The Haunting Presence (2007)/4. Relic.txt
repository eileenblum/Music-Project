A relic of a life once cursed
I am the lost memories of desert crypts
The echo of pestilent chants
The paralyzed the human frame

Once a glimpse into an ancient paradise
I am the signs that remain in dreams
Forever the messiah of death's conspiracy
Do you dare remember?
Life stained
Reality torn
A future dissolved
For my ancient rebirth

Ascending to stygian skies
Aspiring to that which eternally lied
But your hearts and minds are weak
On a course beyond all plights

Life stained
Reality torn
A future dissolved
For my ancient rebirth

I've made you as spawn of filth
To reap the death of the avantghost
In me is the knowledge of infinite pain
A consciousness of unconceivalbe sorrow
