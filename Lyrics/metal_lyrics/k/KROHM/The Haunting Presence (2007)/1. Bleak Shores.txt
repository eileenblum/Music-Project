Cast into mental isolation
The unbreakable silence takes its toll
As the mind flies...
...on inhuman eyes!

A stare projects to a million infinities
Amidst star-devouring nebulas
These abject visions that rape reality
Are the blooming decay of quintessence

Turning the last page in the tome of extinction
I shall play one more song of misery
Before awareness parts with the self
At the edge of my bleak shores...
