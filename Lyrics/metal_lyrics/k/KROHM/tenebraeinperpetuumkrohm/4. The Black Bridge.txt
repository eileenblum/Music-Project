[performed by Krohm]...when distance swallowed time
From the empty eyes of the fallen
Its bleak and vile despondence
Haunted like a past murder

...when days felt like nights
And the only feeling was the decent
Did you not feel it gloriously?
The black bridge that waited to be crossed...
