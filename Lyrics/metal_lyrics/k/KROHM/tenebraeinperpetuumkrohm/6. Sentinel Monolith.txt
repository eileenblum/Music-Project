[performed by Krohm]Omniscient phantom
Whose body is time
Mind is entirety
And face, the starlit eternity
(You will not remember...)

Through tragic births
And glorious funerals
By the scythe of Cronos
I have passed, forgotten
(...I am an essence of old...)

The shades of my destiny
Painted by mournful gods
To become pure will
In the apex of indifference
(...yearning for the knowledge...)

I sink to remorseless voids
Into perpetual dissolution
Where the vortex worms
Into the eibon gate
(...I shall return to the source...)

A cruel and ancient hymn resounds
As the sign of life's devourer is forged
Strange lights under the sentinel monolith
Herald the cycle of extinction
(...beyond the eternal sleep.)
