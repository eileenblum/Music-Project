From towers of sleep, down coiled steps
I slowly descend, to my oneiric dungeons
Knowing that I walk to meet my shadow
And greet pure anguish, pure desecration
I reach an alcove lit by a strange moon
Where a familiar body lies on the ground
What secrets have brought me here?
(only the breathing trees can know ...)
The crystal visions shatters into reflection of frozen blood
As the knife in my hand, reveals the final moment
(... in the forest, you will die ...)
And the dead rejoice with glee
For the night has bestowed their coldness in me!
