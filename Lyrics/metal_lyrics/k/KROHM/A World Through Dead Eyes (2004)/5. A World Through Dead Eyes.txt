I rained down as a silent sound
From abysmal skies that own my torment
When the spoils of your return
From the black center of buried agony
I've arrived from the other side
To see the world through dead eyes
(fading in the grey light of desperation)
I search for my human form
Beyond vast, ungodly graves
But the heart recedes further
In the twilight of a foreboding dream
A black mantle of nothingness
Overtakes the last glimmer of hope
As tragedy waits to unfold
Like a demon on my shoulder
My tales of pain and unsettled grief
Shall be told in the howl of strong winds
Like sordid uncertainty crawling
The horns rise towards chaos and unrest
