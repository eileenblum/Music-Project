From a dream I made you, in that restless night
From whence I crawled, into your sight
Above the door, under your bed
I am all things, that make you dead
The lurking madness, of thoughts blood red
An insect's nest, inside your head
Remember me, when you feel joy
The faintest love, I shall destroy
Remember me, in every dream
For I am you, not what you seem
I am what makes, the flesh you feel
There is no difference, in what is real
