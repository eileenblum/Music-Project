When emotions fade and silence turns to gray
The cold caress of lunacy wipes the gleam away
Awakening to the black wall a dream of grieving ghosts
No memories or thoughts recapture what I've lost
Here is no strength left but to leave this trance
And step beyond this world
Beyond this present time, as rust is the gold
On the throne of the enslaver,
Death is the life of my bleak existence
