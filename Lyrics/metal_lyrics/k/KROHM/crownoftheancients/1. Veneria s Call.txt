Awaken me with your embrace 
And envision me in your opal eyes 
See me through all possible incarnations 
To my final resting place 

Infectuous fire, purge and release 
Even when my cold skin pales 
My boiling veins you'll tap 
With your gentle spikes 

So kind with your cruelty 
You are rapturous romance 
So vividly faint 
You elude my very soul to tears...
