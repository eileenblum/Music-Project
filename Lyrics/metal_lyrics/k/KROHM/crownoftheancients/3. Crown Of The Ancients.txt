Overwhelming infinities 
Take me to an oneiric abyss 
Where the winged snake rides 
The Chaos that preceded time 

Herein I dwell in a speck of ash 
In the remains of a raging war 
When parasitic monsters once clashed 
And from destruction came creation 

To ponder their omnipotence 
Is to leave our human shells 
And ride the glorious tide 
Of the Chaos Sea
