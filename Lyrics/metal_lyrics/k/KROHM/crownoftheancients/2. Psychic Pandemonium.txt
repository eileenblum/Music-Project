Hidden within the raven's eye 
Resides a majestic black maelstrom 
An iridescent vortex of delirium 
abashed in deathless creation 

The veils throb with visceral indignation, 
revealing the angry space between the stars. 
Their seething terror forms out of reversed realities 
where our gods become prey. 

By the sardonic Hammer 
By the jaws of Leviathan. 
even the last dying wish 
is eradicated from the ethereal 

Subtle murmurs that disturb life, 
inevitable paroxysms return once again; 
We never dreamed it could be this way. 
We should have left it alone...
