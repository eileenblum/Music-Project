I know what's waiting
Some man is waiting
For you
Yeah you

Do not explain him
I get the feelin'
We're through
So true

And I heard there's somebody else
I tend to believe that they're right
I get the feeling whenever you go
That something ain't right, my heart's on the line

Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
I heard it all before
Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
Cuz once I'm gone I ain't gonna beg for more

I got the notion
Only a notion
There's change
So strange

What was the reason
The time of the season
For change
So you say

I'm alone to carry the load
And talk to the walls late at night
I get the feeling wherever you are
These hard hitting times they just don't seem right

Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
I heard it all before
Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
Cuz once I'm gone I ain't gonna beg for more

Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
I heard it all before
Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
Cuz once I'm gone I'm not gonna beg

Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
I heard it all before
Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
Cuz once I'm gone I'm not gonna beg any more

Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
Don't say you love me
I'm not gonna beg any more
Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
I heard it all before

Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
Don't say you love me
I heard it all, I heard it all
Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
