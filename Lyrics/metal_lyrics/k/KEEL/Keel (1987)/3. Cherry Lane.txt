I had a hard time lovin'
When love was all about
I went down on Cherry Lane and wow I found out
What many girls are made of
What things they're not afraid of
And what it is to make them shout wow all night long

I've got no regrets
She gave the chance

When I went down, down, down on Cherry Lane
I went down, down, down on Cherry Lane (Cherry Lane)

I knew I had it comin'
She was so wild and young
All it took was just another little slip of the tongue
And nothing takes like cherries
Gotta cut me another slice
And drive down Cherry Lane again with some noise, ooh yeah

I know I'll never forget her
It just keeps gettin' better

Down, down, down on Cherry Lane
And I've never been the same
Down, down, down on Cherry Lane (Cherry Lane)
Cherry baby

No!
Ooh yeah!

I went down, down, down on Cherry Lane
And I've never been the same
Down, down, down on Cherry Lane (Cherry Lane)
Said talkin' 'bout love, yeah

Down, down, down on Cherry Lane
Ooh yeah, I want some now
Down, down, down on Cherry Lane (Cherry Lane)
I went down on Cherry Lane

I went down, down, down on Cherry Lane
I went down, down, down on Cherry Lane (Cherry Lane)
