We'll I've been wonderin'
If you're doin' alright
Cuz you and me could do
What we please in the night

When the darkness falls
Casts a spell on you
If we both get caught
We'll be cut in two

I said
Look around
Somebody's waiting
I said
Turn around
Somebody's waiting
Waiting in the shadows tonight

Oh

The room starts sleepin'
Private eyes never lie
Chasin' you and me down a
One way street in the sky

So your heart's gonna shout
By the rendez-vous
And we're almost caught
But we're never through

I said
Look around
Somebody's waiting
I said
Turn around
Somebody's waiting
Waiting in the shadows tonight

Fallin' fast asleep
In this one damn room
Never had a clue
A-what I mean to you

Now the time has come
For us to get away
I hear the footsteps
Now there's hell to pay, yeah

When the darkness falls
Casts a spell on you
If we both get caught
We'll be cut in two

I said
Look around
Somebody's waiting
I said
Turn around
Somebody's waiting

Oh I said
Look around
Somebody's waiting
I said
Turn around, whoa!
Cuz somebody's waiting now
You better look around
Cuz somebody's waiting
