She had me framed right from the start
Accused of stealing her young heart
The jury's got my fate on trial tonight, yeah
She'll get the verdict in the falling light, oh yeah

If love is a crime
I wanna be convicted
I'll serve my time
Cuz baby I'm addicted
To you

Well that girl is who could and that's the fact, Jack
And I got caught right in the act, yes I did
Everything said on my side is bad, oh no
To prove my innocence, I knew to pray I want my life

If love is a crime
I wanna be convicted
I'll serve my time
Cuz baby I'm addicted

If love is a crime
I wanna be convicted
I'll serve my time
Cuz baby I'm addicted
To you

So lock me up and throw away the key
You bring out the prisoner in me

Whoa-oh!

If love is a crime
I wanna be convicted
I'll serve my time
Cuz baby I'm addicted
To you

If love is a crime
I wanna be convicted
I wanna be convicted
I'm gonna serve my time
Cuz baby I'm addicted
To you

If love is a crime
Sentence me to life with you
If love is a crime
I know what I gotta do
Love is a crime
If love is a crime
I wanna be, wanna be convict-t-t-t-ted
If love is a crime
Ooh yeah
If love is a crime
