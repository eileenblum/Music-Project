Here I am again starin' out the window
As the miles roll on
It seems like such a long, long time
Since it's been so dark before the dawn

In every reflection
It's you that I see
When night comes down
I'll be back in town
So give your love to me

In the calm before the storm
I'll be there to keep you warm
(In the calm before the storm)
In the calm before the storm

And out there in the spotlight's shining heat
As I stare out at endless faces
It's like the eye of a hurricane
And I'm blown away to distant places

In every reflection
You're all that I see
When night comes down
I'll be back in town
So save your lovin' for me

In the calm before the storm
I'll be there to keep you warm
(In the calm before the storm)
In the calm before the storm

Oh baby

Here I am again starin' out the window
As the miles roll on
It's like the eye of a hurricane
And it's always dark before the dawn

In every reflection
It's you that I see
When night comes down
I'll be back in town
So give your love to me baby, yeah

In the calm before the storm
I'll be there to keep you warm
(In the calm before the storm)
In the calm before the storm
(In the calm before the storm)
In the calm before the storm
