Are you hunter or hunted
You forget on the streets
I'm the king of beasts and I'm a-ready to feast
On a choice cut of meat

We're animals in the jungle still
Livin' the way we feel

It's a jungle out there
Take 'em dead or alive and nobody cares
It's a jungle out there
Only the strong survive

Are you hunter or hunted
Everyone is fair game
We call it civilization
Boy it's a jungle all the same

Cuz it's the balance of nature, the law of the land
There's a beast in every man

It's a jungle out there
If you're out on the streets, you'd better beware
It's a jungle out there
Cuz only the strong survive
It's a jungle out there
Take 'em dead or alive and nobody cares
It's a jungle out there

Ooh!
Yow!
Ah-ah-ah!
Ah-ah-ah!
Ah yeah!

Ah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

It's a jungle out there
You forget on the streets tonight, wa-ah-oh!
It's a jungle out there
Take 'em dead or alive and nobody cares
It's a jungle out there
You know only the strong survive
It's a jungle out there
If you're out on the streets, you'd better beware
It's a jungle out there
I'm the king of beasts and I'm ready to feast
It's a jungle out there
