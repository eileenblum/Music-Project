We are the new generation
We got the inspiration
We're feelin' strong so spread the news

The youth of every nation
Will make this declaration
This is the way of life we choose

Together we will rock
Forever we will roll
And someday we will rise
To take control

We are united nations
Under the flag of rock and roll
We are united nations
United we will stand

We feel the same frustrations
We're gonna change the situation
It's all for fun and fun for all

There is no segregation
Rock is for every nation
The young at heart will never fall

Till death we'll raise our hands
To the kids in every land
When someday soon we'll rise
To take command

We are united nations
Under the flag of rock and roll
We are united nations
United we will stand

We are united nations
Under the flag of rock and roll
We are united nations
United we will stand
To take control

We are united nations
We are united nations

And united we will stand
We are united nations
Under the flag of rock and roll
We are united nations
We are united, whoa!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
