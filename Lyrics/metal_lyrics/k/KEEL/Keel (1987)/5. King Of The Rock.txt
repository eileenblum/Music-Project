In the arena is the kingdom I call home
This coliseum is my dome, whoa!
I make my own rules, I call the shots
I'm not afraid of you and I'll fight for what I've got

No one can take this dream from me
I know that I've got to be

King of the rock
I've got to be
King of the rock

This concrete battleground is where I'll make my stand
If you're with me, raise your hands
I'm takin' over, stakin' my claim
I'll never stop till I'm the master of my name

No one can stop me if they tried
This time it's do or die

King of the rock
I've got to be
King of the rock

King of the rock
(King of the rock)
King of the rock

I'll be the
King of the rock
Someday I'm gonna be
King of the rock

I'm king of the rock
King of the rock
I've got to be
King of the rock
