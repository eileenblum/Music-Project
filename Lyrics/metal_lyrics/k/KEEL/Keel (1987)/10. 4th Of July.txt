Call all your friends
There's gonna be a party
And the band is gonna play

Once every year
The time is finally here
We're celebrating Independence Day

By the dawn's early light
We'll make a toast to party the most

On the 4th of July
The party never ends
On the 4th of July
We've got all night to spend
On the 4th of July
The party never stops
On the 4th of July
We've got all night to rock

Let's have a drink
And sing a song or two, whoa!
I wanna party until I see red, white, and blue

Let's see some fireworks
Exploding in my mind
Let's celebrate our constitution of rights

Oh glory
And hey this Bud's for you
It's the least
That we can do

On the 4th of July
The party never ends
On the 4th of July
We've got all night to spend
On the 4th of July
We're never gonna stop
On the 4th of July
We've got all night, all night, all night to rock

On the 4th of July
On the 4th of July

4th of July
Yeah we're gonna have a good time
On the 4th of July
Let's stand up and salute baby
On the 4th of July
Hey what's the rush, we got all night baby
On the 4th of July
We've got all night, all night, all night, all night
