You know I'll always remember
The first night that we met
I was a kid and you were a queen
With a touch I could never forget

I made my mind up easy
I didn't have much choice
I said the things that I had to say
In the wrong tone of voice

I got lost in my feelings
I didn't know what to do
I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stare
So afraid of loving you

I said the wrong thing to the right girl
I had to turn and walk away
I said the wrong thing to the right girl
Cuz love's a dangerous game to play, yeah
Love's a dangerous game to play

Hey
What's your name?
Can I buy you a drink?
How do I look?
And what does she think?

She took me home
And begged me to stay
We both knew what
I had to say

And as I got in the taxi
She blew a kiss goodbye
Sometimes I call out her name and I wonder
Why I didn't try

I said the wrong thing to the right girl
I had to turn and walk away
I said the wrong thing to the right girl
Cuz love's a dangerous game to play

I said the wrong thing to the right girl
I had to turn and walk away, yeah
I said the wrong thing to the right girl
Cuz love's a dangerous game, a dangerous game to play

I said the wrong thing to the right girl
I had to turn and walk away
I said the wrong thing to the right girl, yeah

I said the wrong thing to the right girl
I had to turn and walk away
I said the wrong thing to the right girl
Cuz love's a dangerous game, a dangerous game to play

I said the wrong thing to the right girl
I said the wrong thing, whoa yeah!
I said the wrong thing to the right girl
I had to turn and walk away
I said the wrong thing to the right girl
Sometimes I call out your name
I said the wrong thing to the right girl
You were the right girl
I said the wrong thing to the right girl
