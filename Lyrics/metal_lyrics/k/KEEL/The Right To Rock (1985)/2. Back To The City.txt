It's friday night and I'm restless
Longing for the neon flame
I'm hungry for the streets tonight
I'm getting ready to play my game

I get in my chevy and drive
And turn the radio loud
I'm looking for action tonight
I gotta hear the roar of the crowd

I getting home
Back to the city
Back where I belong
Back to the city
Now I'm coming home ...

Cold steel and concrete
Is what I need to feel
The smell of smoke and lust
And the street beneath my heels

I gotta find me a woman
To give me what I need
I can't control this hunger
And now it's time to feed

I getting home
Back to the city
Back where I belong
Back to the city
Now I'm coming home ...
