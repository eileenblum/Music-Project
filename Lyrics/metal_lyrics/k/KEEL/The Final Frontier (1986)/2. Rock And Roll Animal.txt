I feel the heat beneath my feet
I get the urge as my target moves into sight
The hunting ground is all around
The city streets are a jungle in the heat of the night

As my passion starts to grow
My instincts start to show
The animal inside
Has got nowhere to hide

Rock and roll animal
The music is my prey
I'm a rock and roll animal
Don't get in my way
Don't get in my way - oh no

Dynamite - the feeling's right
I'm in for the kill - so let me out of my cage
I stake my claim - and you're the game
The tension mounts as I unleash my rage - yeah

And I'm on the prowl tonight
My fire's burning bright
The animal inside
Has got nowhere to hide

Rock and roll animal
The music is my prey
I'm a rock and roll animal
Don't - don't - don't get in my way, yeah
