He's ready to fight if the price is right
He don't need to reason
Into the ring and everyone sings
This sport has no season

A fighter by trade, the choice is made
Flesh and bone surrender
At the sound of the bell he's gonna give it hell
A heavyweight contender

When push comes to shove

Take an arm and a leg - arm and a leg
That's a promise and a threat
Take an arm and a leg - arm and a leg
That's all you're gonna get

He straps on the gloves when push comes to shove
Wielding fists of fury
He's coming to town to take over the crown
He wants all the glory - yeah
In one more round his opponent goes down
Arms are raised on victory
The title is won - the damage is done
His name lives on in history

When push comes to shove
He straps on the gloves
And he's ready to fight
