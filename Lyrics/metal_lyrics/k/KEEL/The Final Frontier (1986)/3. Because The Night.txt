[originally by Patti Smith]Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger, is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand when I'm under cover
They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I a doubt, when I'm alone
Love is a ring a telephone
Love is an angel, disguised as lust
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't touch you now, can't touch you now, can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

It belongs to us

With love we sleep,
with doubt the vicious circle turns and turns
The yearning burning
I believe it's time to really feel,
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

Oh, because the night
Because the night
Because the night
Because the night belongs to us

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night
