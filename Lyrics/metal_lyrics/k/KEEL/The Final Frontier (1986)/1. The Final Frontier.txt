The times are changin' for you and I
We seek our future in the sky
On metal wings our race will fly
To conquer space and time

We'll face our destiny
On the final frontier
Beyond this galaxy
Out on the final frontier
On the final frontier
It was meant to be
Out on the final frontier

We've watched the stars since time began
Gone to the moon and back again
And somewhere out there lies the fate of man
To distant worlds we extend out hands

To the final frontier
We'll face our destiny
Out on the final frontier
We're the next pioneers
On strange new worlds
Of the final frontier

Sailing past the speed of light
Throughout the vast eternal night
Beyond the farthest star
We're taking flight
