In my blood

Some people are born to lose
And some are born to win (born to win)
But I was born with the radio on
And it ain't been turned off since

I was weaned on metal
I was breast â fed booze
Vaccinated with rock and roll
I was immune to the blues

'Cause I was raised on rock (I was raised)
Raised on rock (raised on rock)
I never want to stop (I was raised)
'Cause I was raised on rock

I dropped out of high school (high school)
I never needed to go (I never needed to go)
They couldn't teach me 'bout rock and roll (rock and roll)
What I didn't already know (didn't already know)

I never held down a job
I never had the time (got no time)
You're free to live your own life
So don't tell me how I should live mine

'Cause I was raised on rock (I was raised)
(don't you know that I was raised on rock)
Raised on rock (raised on rock)
I never learned to stop (never gonna stop)
'Cause I was raised on rock
