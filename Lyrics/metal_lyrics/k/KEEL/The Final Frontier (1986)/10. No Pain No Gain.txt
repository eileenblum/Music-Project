I've learned a lesson fools never learn
Play by your own rules or you'll get burned
I'll hate the last laugh when I see the tables turn

But there's a high price you gotta pay
Just be a good boy and do everything they say
I say to hell with that I'll do it my own way

Life's a game that has no rules
You play to win or you'll play the fool
Don't you know

No pain no gain - pay the price

If you're satisfied then what's the use
You feel the pressure as they tighten up the noose
I've had enough and I won't take no more abuse

Life's a table can't be told
And I'm a man who can't be bought or sold - no way

No pain no gain - pay the price
No pain no gain
No way - no pain gain
