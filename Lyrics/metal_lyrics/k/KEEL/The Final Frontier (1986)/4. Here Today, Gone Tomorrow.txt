A midnight flight on a rainy night
I've got a hundred more miles to go
I spent a long time on the telephone line
'Cause I had to let you know

I've been around the world and now I'm coming home
It's something I've got to do
Tomorrow at ten I'll have to leave again
But tonight I belong to you

Here today, gone tomorrow
Just keep my love in your heart
And I'll be here to stay

Well, we both know I've got a job to do
And I do it well, yeah
But to fight my way back to you
I'd go through heaven and hell

I've got to hit the road and do another show
As soon as the night is through
Through I'm here today, gone tomorrow
My heart remains with you

I'm here today, gone tomorrow
Even though we're apart
I'm never too far away

Oh, I'm here today, gone tomorrow
Just keep my love in your heart
And I'll be here to stay
And I'm on my way
