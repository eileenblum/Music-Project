Wounded angel
She came to me
Her broken heart
In agony
Seeking answers
She cried to me in vain
Hopelessness
Filled my eyes with pain

Tears of fire
From a heart so cold
Tears of fire
Feel my passion flow
Tears of fire
Burn into my soul
I could never let you go

I couldn't help myself
Forgive me if you can
It really wasn't me
I hope you understand
Too many memories
To throw it all away
I'd never leave you anyway

Tears of fire
From a heart so cold
Tears of fire
Feel my passion flow
Tears of fire
Burn into my soul
I could never let you go!
