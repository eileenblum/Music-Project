Just another girl

You think you've got the answers
You say you've seen it all
A midnight queen in a limousine
With lovers at your beckon call

You think you've got it coming
And that you've got it made
But I've seen your kind a thousand times
In every town â every place I've played
'Cause I know

You're just another girl
Just another girl in love
You're only one more pretty face
Just another girl

You're busy making small talk
Too cool to make your move
But if you want the best just put your love to the rest
You got no time â you got no time to lose
'Cause I know

You're just another girl
Just another girl in love
You're only one more pretty face
In another lonely place

You're just another girl
Just another girl in love
