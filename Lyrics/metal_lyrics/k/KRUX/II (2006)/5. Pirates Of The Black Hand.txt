We come from the sewers to pirate this fat land this hour
We march in the streets of skulls to take back what ours
White thrash of the south

We shake the foundations of power with lead and with force
Burn the pillars of greed, let society fall
Rebel rousers, drunks and punks, and brave invaders

We plague the cities with fire, we are in control
Storm the bastions with metal and rock'n'roll
The oceans of oppression, the killing hand
The black flag of vengeance rise over our land

Anarchy warning, a note from the underworld
The pirates of the heart are sailing to steal and destroy
Rebel rousers, drunks and punks, and brave invaders
