You showed me things, the secrets of your eye. The magic circle
That glows and shimmers always through the night
A promise spoken of wonders I could do. A chain unbroken
A road so straight, but only for a few

The sun was black, the day was dark as coal. Not unusual
I saw the hours as something I could throw away
But there I saw it, the writing's clear as ice. My soul was aching
Now I knew my home and where to go

Devil Sun -- Yes I like your way
Devil Sun -- I'll always be your slave
Devil Sun -- You got so much to say
Devil Sun -- You command, I obey

You showed me things, the secrets of your eye. The magic circle
That glows and shimmers always through the night
A promise spoken of wonders I could do. A chain unbroken
A road so straight, but only for a few

Do you know, that I like your craft?
And we shall go, you will lead the path
Do you see, I'm the newborn son?
And I praise, the god the Devil Sun
