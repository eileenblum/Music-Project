The serpent crawled the way up from his underground hole
Bitter, unfulfilled, quite nasty and old
Wants everyone to drink his toast, the poisonous chalice
And we listen like hypnotized to the snake and his talk

You rise from the ashes to the beauty of grace and delight
I know deep inside it's done with mirrors and smoke
You fill my apartment with magic and treason, beware
I see your lizard eyes in every man, we must all take care

And the serpent said: Richness
I'll give it now to you
Just keep on what you're doing
To the devil his due
I'm everywhere, the great lord
I see every sin
No matter how you hide behind your doors
I will always sneak in

In every single corner of the world, yes there you are
You're spreading your feathers like a god, a true superstar
You fill my apartment with magic and treason, beware
I see your lizard eyes in every man, we must all take care

Bitter and fucked up and blue
You know the serpent is you
Spreading the poison you can
Venom's black in every man
Snake of Christ, you do us wrong
Oh serpent with a deadly tongue
Bitter and fucked up and blue
You know the serpent is you
