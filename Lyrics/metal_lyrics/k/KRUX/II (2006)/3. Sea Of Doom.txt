Apocalyptic on Sundays I am
Before the altar of boredom I kneel
I plow an even deeper furrow
In grief's eternal wheel ....oh god

I sink faster into despair
And sorrow is my only reward
I can't hear music no more
Not a single black stupid chord

Swimming on a lazy afternoon
In a sea of doom

And I cry me a river of dying angels
And I try to be strong
I'm afraid of the sunshine that tries to reach me
Now it won't be long

The well of pain and gloom
The sea of doom

All those heartaches stole my world
The shit of a life time, should have been gold
I put the blinds down, go back to bed
The lair of numbness, the losers keep

I sink faster into despair
And sorrow is my only reward
I can't hear music no more
Not a single black stupid chord

Drowning on a lazy afternoon
In a sea of doom
