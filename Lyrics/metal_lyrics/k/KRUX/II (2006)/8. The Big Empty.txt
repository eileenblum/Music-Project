Big is the empty
A very special place
Where nothing happens
In the milky haze

There is no action
And no ones here
A whole lot of emptiness
Fills my sacred sphere

Don't say I exist
Don't say that I preach
I cannot be reached
In this state of bliss


Thanks to clovis.roman for sending track #8 lyrics.
