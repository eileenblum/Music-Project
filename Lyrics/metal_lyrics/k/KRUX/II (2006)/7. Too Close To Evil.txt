We're on the road to hell
Down without brakes
Betrayal and cheaper lies
Whatever it takes

I play my evil games
And you, you play yours
A conspiring and spying witch
To win the cold war

Evil I do, Evil you see
My feelings are true
And more evil you will be

I burned down your soul
I killed all your needs
I hate all your flaws
But more evil you're to me

Together we reach the darkness
Too close to evil
Your hatred was vast and black
More evil than evil

You took me to hell and back
A nice little trip
Then showed me a soul to rip
Apart bit by bit

Evil I do, Evil you see
My feelings are true
And more evil you will be

I burned down your soul
I killed all your needs
I hate all your flaws
But more evil you're to me
