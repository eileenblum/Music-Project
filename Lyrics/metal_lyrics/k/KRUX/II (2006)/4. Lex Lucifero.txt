There's a dead man in my bed
Got no legs, got no head
Darkness lackeys underneath
Satan's offspring licks my knees

A ring of demons around my bed
Curse the life that I have lead

Something nasty's soiling my sheet
Spawn of evil at my feet
Horns and claws, rotten nose
Hell is sucking on my toes

A ring of demons around my bed
Curse the life that I have lead
As I fill my life with fear
I clearly see the end is near

Satan's smell is in my room
A place to sleep becomes a tomb
Demon voices speak as one
Hell is fire, shit and sand
