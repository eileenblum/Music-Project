Terror fiend yes mother goule
Supersweet and supercruel
Want your hate your rotten core
'Cause your love will hurt me more

I'm not giving
I'm not living

I was born with no present light
I was born in the dead of night
I was born with no present light
I was born in the dead of night

You're the picture of my doom
Leaving hate in this black room
If you die by your own hand
I will be a happy man

I'm not crying
Always dying

I was born with no present light
I was born in the dead of night
I was born with no present light
I was born in the dead of night

I was born with no present light
I was born in the dead of night
My world is black not white
I was born with no present light
