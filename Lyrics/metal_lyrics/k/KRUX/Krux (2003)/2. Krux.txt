Behind the light behind the blue
Behind all reason I'll kill me for you
The meaning the purpose it's still all the same
Your voice is destruction the sword and the flame

Morning has broken
To smile at my doom
Crude salty frozen
Not a second too soon

So shall I bleed or shall I leave?
Must I surrender or must I retrieve?
A God of restraint oh please give me a new
I now need a chainsaw to prove what I can do

Morning has broken
To smile at my doom
Crude salty frozen
Not a second too soon

I know the facts and I've made a pact
But I'm still pretending that my soul's intact
And plenty more there's a black closed door
That I can't open to find my mind's cure

Morning has broken
To smile at my doom
Crude salty frozen
Not a second too soon
Morning has broken
To smile at my doom
Crude salty frozen
Not a second too soon
