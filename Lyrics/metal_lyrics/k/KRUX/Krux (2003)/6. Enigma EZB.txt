I looked to the left then I looked at the dead
The sun is melting first black then so red
Ignore me ignore me I see what's ahead
All is now dome and all is now said

'Cause Heaven is coming down
And most things are left undone
We crumble under the sun
When Heaven is coming down

Where is the future and where is the past?
Who is the first one and who will be last?
The sky is now open the hole is so vast
Eternities fragments the light's fading fast

'Cause Heaven is coming down
And most things are left undone
We crumble under the sun
When Heaven is coming down
'Cause Heaven is coming down
And most things are left undone
We crumble under the sun
When Heaven is coming down

The truth I deserve it, I will not defy
I fall to my knees 'fore the swallowing eye
Everyman knows to live is to die
I'll give revelation with my last goodbye

'Cause Heaven is coming down
And most things are left undone
We crumble under the sun
When Heaven is coming down
But love will conquer love
And blood will find new blood
The sun will rise above
And love will conquer love
And love will conquer love
The sun will rise above
And love will conquer love
And love will conquer love
