This place is oh so cold
Grasping young and old
Come in lock the door
The sun is dead, oh Lord
Like a thief at night
She came in stole the light
A winter full of lies
Lasting thousaind lives
Breathing ice and stone
Always so alone
I know I won't grow old
This place is oh so cold

I die in shameless snow
Can't feel arm or toe
Without reach I am
Sunken undergound
I drown in water black
You said I'll do just that
I welcome rain in May
It's winter every day
