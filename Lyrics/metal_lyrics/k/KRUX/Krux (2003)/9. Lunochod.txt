In the days of great wars of the stars
Where's the way to Jupiter and Mars?
Search for space in the deep black silent tomb
Faggots play we drop a red tank on the moon

Moscow calls eternal night
Burning through the cosmic light
Eyeless junk is crossing void
Bolsjevik tin can droid

Evil east so close to USA
The red disease you'll catch it anyday
And take a trip blast off to the skies
We built a ship of great soviet enterprise

Moscow calls eternal night
Burning through the cosmic light
Eyeless junk is crossing void
Bolsjevik tin can droid

Rocket red the communist face
A colder war, Russians in space
USSR's mechanical drone
Lunochod, voice of the Moon
