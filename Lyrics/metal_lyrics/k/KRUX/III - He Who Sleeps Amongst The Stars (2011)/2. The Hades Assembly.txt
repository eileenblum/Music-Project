Hidden chambers....secret handshakes
The clock is ticking down

Skyscrape penthouse....men with power
The contract is signes and bound

The Hades Assembly sell us, pound by pound
The world is for sale, to a thing with horns
Cities and countries and mountains...bricks and stone
Run for shelter and cover...here's the storm..

We are the Hades Assembly
We answer to no government, king or country
We are liaision with the powers of darkness and our mission is to create
anarchy on earth to our own benefit....preparing the world for a new order

We are the new administration...and evil corporation with
the devil in the boardroom...

It's nothing personal....just business!

We are the Hades Assembly...and we rock!!
