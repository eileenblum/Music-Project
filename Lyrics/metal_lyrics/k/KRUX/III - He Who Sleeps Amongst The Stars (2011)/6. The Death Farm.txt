He opens up his eyes, the reaper sees your sacrifice
Holds you in his grip, together you will take a ride
Into the big wheel of fools, where nothing is sacred or safe
The Devil has got his own way, of putting his mark on your life

You're trapped inside...

On the Death Farm, the pigs they have got wings
On the Death Farm, lies are common things

Death is in your house, holding court, you're such a mouse
Dominates your world, life will crush you like a louse
Into the big wheel of fools, where nothing is sacred or safe
The Devil has got his own way, of putting his mark on your life

You're trapped inside...

On the Death Farm, the pigs they have got wings
On the Death Farm, lies are common things
On the Death Farm, you're a sucker you will pay
On the Death Farm, you're a servant you're a slave

On the Death Farm, love is what you need
On the Death Farm, there's only lots of greed
On the Death Farm, no-one helps when you fall
On the Death Farm, the winner takes it all

(Where can you go when your life dream is busted
Who can you turn to, who can be trusted?)
