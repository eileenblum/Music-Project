Honey and bees
Atoms and seeds
We come and we leave

Winds and grain
Birds and stains
Screaming brains

Waves and sand
Bone-like hands
The devil's dance

'CAUSE THE WORLD IS A PLACE OF CROWS
'CAUSE THE WORLD IS A PALE GREY HORSE
'CAUSE THE WORLD IS A BLOATED CORPSE
'CAUSE THE WORLD IS...THE WORLD...

Honey and bees
Atoms and seeds
We come and we leave

Waves and sand
Bone-like hands
The devil's dance
