I don't wish you fame and fortune
I'm working on my private warchant
I won't give you pearls and roses
May you sink in hells psychosis

Oh...just go...beware...
See...the cross...I bear

I can't hum when you are singing
You don't know what I am dreaming
Watch me now I'll give you Voodoo
And here's a bunch of badder juju

Oh...watch out...beware
See...the cross...I bear...
I wake the ghoule......again...
So...our love...must end

Still we sleep like children
On the eve of destruction
and 7 deadly curses
Can't bring me to you

Oh seven deadly curses, I will give to you!!
And seven deadly verses, can't bring me to you!!
