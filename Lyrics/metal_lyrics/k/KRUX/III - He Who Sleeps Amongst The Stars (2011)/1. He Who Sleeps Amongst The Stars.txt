Sitting on the hill. Silent...Lotus...still. One with the world

Eyes are full of stars
Peace within his heart
And rest in the soul

Down came an angel, a smile on his face
"In your hands....there's bullets and joy"....Godlike is he...
Who sleeos amongst the STARS!!!
With dreams full of STARS!!

Single thought in mind. Leave the world behind. All's done and said

A garden of flowers, a river of blood
What is to be understood..."I am only he...
Who sleeps amongst the STARS"!! With dreams full of STARS!!

Life is fullfilled. Nothing more to kill. Absolution is bliss

Tranquil as I pass. Sitting in the grass. Sky and clouds I kiss

Counting the angels, the leaves and the trees
All is crucial....a part of me....Forgiven is he...
Who sleeps amongst the STARS!! With dreams full of STARS!!
