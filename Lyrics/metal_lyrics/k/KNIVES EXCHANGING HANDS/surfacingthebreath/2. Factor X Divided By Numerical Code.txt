You cannot divide the point where my two lines intersect
On this, our eyes
Our own demise
We see
We watch the skyline aflame
We have no one to blame
Have we become a society of numbers?
What was made of love?
What have we become?
Leave it to us
We are our own worst enemies
We have destroyed ourselves for these old ideals
Why have we segregated?
Live and die by the sword
My soul won't be scarred
Mu unity will survive
The skies turn black with our demise
We look to ourselves and what we are
View your own death
You are nothing
I won't be nothing
You will die as nothing
