I'm disenfranchised with the franchise. Can you still remember the days we couldn't wait to wake in the van? Now we meet in our war room to discuss any present failures on the field. In a sea of minnows the whales are being devoured until we wage civil war only to later try and atone. So classify our work and throw it in the want ads. Plant fields of trees if they protect against serpents. And if you could please dress me as I'm afraid I don't know what's currently in. However, all is not bleak at the FYE listening station. It is possible to find the next American idol. Only to have them swallowed in an ocean of runner-ups. The map shows current location but not desired end point. If you left me to my way I'd drown the world in black ink. Anything to never see another dollar sign - The vomit-inducing symbol of our culture. All of this to grab at a dream that won't run from the wolves long enough to survive. How long will your survive?

So don't turn your back on me now
We've made it through this avalanche
And we're coming up for air
This weather will continue
Until the snow cannot be seen through.
