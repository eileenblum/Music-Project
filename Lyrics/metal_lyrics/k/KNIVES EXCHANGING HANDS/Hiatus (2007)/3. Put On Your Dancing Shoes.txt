Lately I've been reading the past life of a dead man. Differs ever slightly than what I'm used to. Everything was taken. Still I will not break in two. Without friends, without love, I've suffered all in all. Now is the time to discover something more. I will stand strong reborn in the flames. Lying in bed shivering from the withdrawal of your kiss. Your faded memories. Imprints on my psyche. The me I used to be. I will not revert my will. (I) will not be challenged. This is not time. You've tried your best. I stand unaffected. Though you bleed me, I will not cry. My life. My death. My blood. My victory.
