Your name will be the crumbling on the heads of millions
An Achilles heal youâve made yourself
Your star falls faster from the sky
People see your for what you really are
Youâve turned your friends into cash
Just like that
Iâll bet you think your autograph cures cancer
Iâll bet you think your autograph cures
Your diagnosis is that your selfishness fails you
(It) shows other around you the truer side of truth
With all of your lying and the hate that youâre hiding, I youâve learned
I still remember that day in December, the day the bridge burned
Your Helen will not return
So play out your days as what youâve become on your stage
