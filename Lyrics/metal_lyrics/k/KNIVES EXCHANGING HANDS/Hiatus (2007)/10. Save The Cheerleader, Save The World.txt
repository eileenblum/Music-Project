These frames come to life as familiar as the blood curdling in the back of your throat. You're on your own. And this contempt for the plight of mankind, utterly worthless. I'll feel better once this is over. That last shot was a keeper. Make sure the markers stay in their place. And while I hide behind these walls, I'm safe. Two bags full to alleviate. One's grief resized to fit on the front of a card. Hallmark will have a season for it soon enough. You're all the same to me, and I wish I cared. This is the last time I will feel your heart fading and near. Remember the words I inscribed on your chest. My final words to you. And with your last dying beat, utter them. All these wings torn from the radiant wounds of your. Radiant. She's sleeping in the woods alone tonight
