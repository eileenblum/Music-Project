Never portray those images as flawless
Utterance of your posture welts thousands
And in this time you should ponder your penance
Ask what gives you your royal duty
Preach prosthetic astronomy
Eleven planets and counting
The top of the food chain, yet the bottom of the gene pool
Never call yourself my savior
With the eyes wide
Your heartless ways
Catch up to you
Your heartless ways
