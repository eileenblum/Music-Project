Your face smiling down on us from above. We miss you so much. We'll always remember. Remnants of what you were will remain true to the image we hold of you in our hearts. Your words engraved on hearts. We will never forget your eyes. I hope, one day, to possess the love you gave. To one day be like you; possess your patience and virtue. Your kindness forever engraved on my heart. We'll see you again one day. Until then we'll miss you for always.
