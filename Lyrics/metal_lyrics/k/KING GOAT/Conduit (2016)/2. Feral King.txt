Stillborn world. Free and strong, nature's son.
Who could dethrone him? The Feral King.

Sweeping through the twilight of a dimming sky,
Falling fire blinding panic stricken eyes.
Falls with crashing thunder into his domain.
Rending all asunder.
All that he knows is dead or dying.
All he sees around him now is change.

Lord no more. Empire turned to dust. Fear takes hold.
Who are these strangers? What do they know?
Where will I go? I must resist.

Let them have their fires. Let them have their machines.
Usurpers, thieves and liars, soon to choke on their greed.
Vermin race. See the face of your doom.

I shall steal, silent, to where this began.
Into my empire, buried now by sand.
There I'll wait. Sit in state. For my time, To come again.

Buried deep in stasis, poison from within.
They could not expect this. Closer to the kill.
I am one.
Sire and son,
Of the earth. My rebirth awaits.

The Feral King.
