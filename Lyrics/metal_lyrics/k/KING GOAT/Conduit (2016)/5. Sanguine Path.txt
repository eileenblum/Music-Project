In one enraptured host, beasts and men collide.
Voices sullen, thoughts morose, they soon fall into line.
Subdue my mortal anguish
With vapid animals that feed on my decline.
Where, now, is the prize, promised in our name?
As far as I can tell, we've paid enough in shame.
In tatters and voiceless, like cattle,
Wait in line, patiently, for the cull.

One more injustice and two more wounds to heal.
A legacy of blood that oils tyrannic gears.
Wear your shackles lightly.
Live in fear of reprisal or pay with your life.
Enough is enough.
Life is more than toil and duress.
Now, for better or worse

With no loved ones to pay for my mistakes,
I can focus and make good my escape.
If I fail then I will not die in vain.
Either way, I'll never follow again.

Into the cold. Out of the fold. Under grey skies,
I'll run 'til I die.

Pursue my tracks. Follow my bleeding feet. A shot rings out.
My final moments in verdant fields of green.

At least I tried, and died alive. A peaceful smile etched on my face.
