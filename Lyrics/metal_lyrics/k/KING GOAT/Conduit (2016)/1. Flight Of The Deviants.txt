I can't recall a night like this, now all has gone amiss.
In the silence, there's no peace. Only fear that cannot cease.

Don't tell me I'm alone in nothingness.
In my mind an approaching shape calls me on again.
With no hope I stumble on. I can only pray they were wrong.
The Badlands loom ahead. Dark and unknown. Deep and wild.

Driven out with no return. Deviation our only crime.
Their time will come in its turn.
Pride, hatred united into one.
Nothing changes. A creed I've seen before.
And now, in squalor, two brothers reap what they've sown.
When, all of a sudden, silver threads come floating down.

(Watch thou for the mutant. The Devil is the father of deviation.
Keep pure the stock of the Lord. In purity our salvation.
The norm is the will of God. Blessed is the norm.)

Watch thou for the mutant!
They descended from the sky. Slowly strangling all life. Beyond our darkest hope.

They came. So far away. And changed our lives
When they brought us home. Not our own. A memory from my childhood dreams.
We live again!
