In our short span of time,
Vacant and wandering,
Your trust is misplaced.

The soul of every being
Is far beyond redeeming.
The end approaching faster
Than we can find an answer.
In cloud, obscured and shrouded,
And in the roots of mountains,
Awaiting unexpected
The reckoning we all deserve.

And remove the heart of the Earth stone by stone
And replace it with lives stolen away.
Sepia shaded, the phantoms that reach from their graves,
That you, in your pride, desecrated without paying heed.
The lesson, unwanted, returns to the deep and is forgotten.

Given to you, were far too many chances,
Spurned and abused. No more.

There's no hiding from the sun.
There's no pleading with the void.
All of humankind undone.
And every being on the Earth will suffer as one.

Rapture.
Chaos across the globe
Every prediction could not foretell it's wrath.
As the continents capsize into the flame,
At long last, the planet is cleansed.

You should all know by now
It could have been so much easier.
So much easier on us all.

The soul of every being
Is far beyond redeeming.
The end approaching faster
Than we can find an answer.
In cloud, obscured and shrouded,
And in the roots of mountains,
Awaiting unexpected
The reckoning we all deserve.
