Forever is not so far away.
Endeavour is masking all of my failures.
I may never work out what I am missing.
Drained of colour I sit and stare but, still, can't see.

Flitting wings, how I have waited for you,
Patiently. When will you bring me solace?
Quietly, I reach my hand out for you.
Settling, I close my fist and you are gone.

Suddenly, I am all too aware
Of the prison I've built for myself.

Doors locked, windows blocked,
Lights out, no power.
No more. It's over.
I lie back on the floor,
Sigh and give up.

Aching limbs weighed down
Silent shock gripping.

Catatonic shiver,
My body purges itself of my soul.

Peering, leering, looming nothing.
Take me, kill me, something, anything.

For one final chance at life, I'd do most anything.
Folly of a broken man who gave up everything to soon.

I remember
Companionship
That I surrendered
To selfishness.

My hatred of the world
Proved to be too much.

My final embers
Died with the moth.
Like him, I'm ending
In silence, all alone.
