Pure vanity, an aging hollow smile.
The dusty avenue that stretches out for miles.
Stupidity, avarice and me.
A new monolith to greed.

Silky threads, tender touch.
Comforting far too much.

In due course
Nothing ever lasts long.

And the cowardice returns,
As the ecstasy fades.
Repeat and return
The same way.

You came here
Expecting far too much.

Keep it in.
Don't let on.
Guilty sin.
Love alone.

With so much
That went unsaid.
I know now
I may not get the chance again.

It's useless mourning for what never was.
Heed these memories and youâll defeat the cause.
Still, these fantasies are the ones I'll miss.
They come come back to me every time that I am alone.

I cannot forgive nor allow myself to forget.
Instead I shall slowly absorb these small feelings and become stronger.

No. Why? Why should I let this go, once more?
Closing the door on my hopes that will not relent. Still persisting, I cannot send them away.

This is the conflict.
Missing the point.
The decision was never in my hands.

Make your peace and carry on.
The universe won't notice when you're gone.
The dusty avenue stretches further than before.

Follow wherever it leads.
Cherish whosoever you meet.
Before you reach the end and realise that you
Are all alone.
