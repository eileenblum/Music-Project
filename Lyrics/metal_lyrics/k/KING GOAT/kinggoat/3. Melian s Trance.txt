I stare in wonder,
Not quite sure of what I see.
This spell I'm under.
Locked in trance, unable to move.
I cannot leave.

Light shines from her eyes.
Love. Lust. All is lost.

All desire surrenders to her
And passes into the void.
Soul on fire, I cannot refuse
And there can be no rest for me now.

Soon, the grief is all I know.
Seasons pass, give way to the snow.
Still I stand but I'm not alone.
She still stands there, chilling my bones.

Months soon turn to years.
Still we gaze in trance.
Now I understand.
She cannot advance.

Well I will not be held captive any more.
I must break the spell if I'm to ever be restored.

She will be mine.
Until the end of time.
My elven forest queen,
Until the death of the sun.
