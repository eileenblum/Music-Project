Fanatic tyrants.
Fear and hate.
Generals, soldiers.
Honour and fate.
Will it stop before it's too late?

In the words of Oscar Wilde
An opinion can't be correct
Unless you're willing to die.

And so they march to the killing fields
For God and Country.
Make the ultimate sacrifice.
And I'll never understand the reasons why.

Come pray at the altar of violence.
Come sing the hymns of hatred.

Glorified violence.
A Cult Obscene.
Civilians lying dead
In the wake of the war machine.

Kill. Die. Never understand the reasons why.
