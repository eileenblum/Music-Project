With fatal flaws and corruption of mind
We, the weak, will eat ourselves alive.
As we feast like feculent worms
We barely look up at the point of no return.

Don't shift the blame.
You are as guilty as I.
Lungs fill with water.
The Final Decline.

These roots reach deeper now
Than I ever guessed.
Right down to the core
Of the cold abyss.
This is what you deserve.
You played your part
And now not even the Earth
Will spit back out your bones.

Don't shift the blame.
You are as guilty as I.
Lungs fill with water.
The Final Decline.
