On wings of steel they rode in
Masters of galactic winds
The mind-eraser
The hell-raiser

At the gates of Misanthropolis they stand
Unleashing the full force of man
Efficiency perfected
From knowledge we must not be protected

Fire in their eyes
Cosmic masterminds
Awakening the force that once ruled
That once ruledâ¦

Mysterious are the lies told by cosmic masterminds [2x]

Out of emptiness
Force is created
The bane of the old creator
Bane of time
Bane of mind
Bring forth the force

Heresy and lies
Cosmic Masterminds
Leading us into darkness
That once ruledâ¦

Enlightened ideals
A science of fear
Reaching full capacity [2x]
