A lumbering machine
A giant of steel
The exterminator
Crime perpetrator (light section)
The one that feels no pain
The one that is not weak

The Machine God [repeat]

A gaze into its eye
I am sure you will die
For love it cannot feel
No remorse, no inner peace

The Machine God [repeat]

Machine gun arms
In death he deals
The thing that never sleeps
The thing that should not be

Legends old tell of its creator a wicked man, who knew no love
-whose heart was cold
Awaken him and set him free and light shall be
All light shall be.
