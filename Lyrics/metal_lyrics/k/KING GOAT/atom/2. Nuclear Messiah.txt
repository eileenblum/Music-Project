I used to be just like you
Before the day of the great shroom
My new God, Oppenheimer I worship you

Korea, my nightmare [2x]

I used to be just like you
Before the day of the great shroom
MacArthur, my leader, I worship you

Korea, my nightmare

Iâm a nuclear messiah
A thorium Templar
a nuclear messiah
I bring salvation
Nuclear messiah repeat [2x]

In the aftermath they all lay dead
In aftermath theyâll know Iâm right
In the aftermath theyâll be alright
In the aftermath [repeat]

Do not fear cause I am here
Salvation is near
Do not fear
I bring salvation
