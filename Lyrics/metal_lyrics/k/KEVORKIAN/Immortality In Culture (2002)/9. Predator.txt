My mind a twisted laborynth
Spawns memories of old
Feeling hate and eternal sadness
Perpetual vengeance
The truth is crystal clear
But I can't take it
Lurking in the abyss
The predator awaits to kill again

Demons forever my soul will take

Misery fear and emptiness
My predator hunts me
No one else sees its shape
Slip into the shadows
Can't go anywhere to hide
Just me and my soul inside
It won't fade until I'm dead
Or until she has bled

Demons forever my soul will take

Raped mind
