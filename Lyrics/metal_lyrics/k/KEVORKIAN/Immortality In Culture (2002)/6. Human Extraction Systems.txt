This fucking world's a pile of shit
I hate to breathe inside of it
The stench of mass complacency
Is just too much for me
Although it's always been like this
I just can't take this hopelessness
We live inside a well told lie
That only I can see

Weakened mental fronts
They're subjugating
Waiting world will see
There's no escaping... The WAR

Most only learn to reproduce
The things they make are of no use
Like rats upon a spinning wheel
They waste their time with games
We've numbed our minds to video loops
Receiving lies as if lies were food
Spawn of the information age
We piss our minds away

Weakened mental fronts
They're subjugating
Waiting world will see
There's no escaping... The WAR

The blind that line our nations streets
Provide the soldiers with fresh meat
Submission takes so many forms
Like following the trends
Don't try to find what's right for you
Let others say what you should do
Once in the church, now in the schools
Human Extraction Systems

Weakened mental fronts
They're subjugating
Waiting world will see
There's no escaping... The WAR
