Our blood bleeds the same father
Though you may hate this
You can't erase me
You can't pretend to
Not know your bloodline
Ignore your own kind
Show me your loathing - You only hate yourself

Our blood - Raised apart
Our blood - Brought together
My blood - Needs to know
What binds - Us forever

Our blood - Raised apart
Our blood - Begs forgiveness
My blood - Needs to know
What ties? - Why I should give it?

Artificial heart beats be-
neath your chest pumping
Fathers blood through your
Plastic breast - I see
Through your skin into
What's within - A Shell of a Man
So Undeserving Can't Understand
You Only Hate Yourself

Our blood - Raised apart
Our blood - Brought together
My blood - Needs to know
What binds - Us forever

Our blood - Raised apart
Our blood - Begs forgiveness
My blood - Needs to know
What ties? - Why I should give it?

Why let it go?
What fuels me inside
It raises the cross
That cuts through your lies

Why let you go?
What cuts me inside
Is burning the cross
That fuels all your lies

Don't Hate Me, Don't Hate Your Own
Our Father Binds Our Blood Unwhole
Don't Hate Me, Don't Hate Your Own (Our Name, Our Father)
Our Father Binds Our Blood Unwhole
We Are One in the Name of the Father

Blood
Don't Hate Me

Why let it go - What fuels me inside - It raises the cross - That cuts
Why let -- it go -- What cuts -- Inside

Why let you go - What cuts me inside - It's burning the cross - That fuels
Burning -- The Cross -- That fuels -- Your lies

Why let it go - What fuels me inside - It raises the cross - That cuts
Why let -- You go -- What cuts -- Inside

Burning -- The Cross -- That fuels -- Your lies

Why let it go?
What fuels me inside
It raises the cross
That cuts through your lies

Why let you go?
What cuts me inside
Is burning the cross
That fuels all your lies
