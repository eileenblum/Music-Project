Oh baby baby, Oh baby baby

Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here
Oh baby baby, I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby cause I need to know now, oh because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time!

Oh baby baby, the reason I breathe is you
Boy you've got me blinded
Oh pretty baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
That's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby cause I need to know now, oh because

Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess that my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign, hit me baby one more time

I must confess (my loneliness) that my loneliness
(Is killing me) Is killing me now
(I must confess) Don't you (I still believe) know I still believe
That you will be here (I lose my mind)
And give me a sign...
Hit Me Baby One More Time!
