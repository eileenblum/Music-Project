I feel this...

Is where my rot belongs
In an earthen pit
Bathing in dirt, I'm at one with the soil
I can't live with the rest of you
So I'll live in a pit

The worms are my brothers
The slugs are my people

They know me I am of them
It is so clear the earth is my home

Dirt to dirt back to earth
Hidden from life above

I sulk underground
Deep in loving mud
Loathing in darkness
The life that walks above

Scorned long ago
In the world above
But here I'm loved

This is my kingdom

Of crust and mud
I'm beckoned
To crawl into a pit

Cast down from light
Into mud into slime into home
Human to shit to womb (the true existence)
Away from joy from hope to nothing
I bathe in mud

Swallowed deeper down
The maggots speak my name the flies rejoice (the true hyms of praise)
I conform not to your futile ways
I conform to sewage and insect
I live in mud

Coward
And you'll never save me
No

I'm beckoned to crawl into a piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
