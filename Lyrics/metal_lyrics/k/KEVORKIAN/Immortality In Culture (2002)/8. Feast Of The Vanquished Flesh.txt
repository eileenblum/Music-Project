I hunger not but for victory and justice
I shall feast when I am victorious
And the feast shall be of the vanquished flesh
Pain for them

I feel nothing for those that betray me
Let them be filled with sorrow and suffering
Let me administer their defeat
Pain for them

[Chorus:]
They tried to take away what I once loved
Then tried to strip me of my life
But revenge will come with deadly force
Their corpses will be made into trophies

Anguished and tortured but I live on
For those that are dismayed I have a gift
I shall eat their souls
Pain for them

[Chorus]
