The more you make the more that you need
By your possesions you are defined (defiled in time)
Long before later years you will be
Dead from the emptiness left inside (witness my mind)

There will be...

[Chorus]
No retreat, No surrender
At my feet will lay the heart of man
No surveying ruins, no more failures
I will kill them all

Spinning your wheels through the sands of time
Faceless purveyor of ignorance (by grand design)
Moving through mazes so meaningless
Your life a fiction inside your mind (the dream has died)

There will be...

[Chorus]

Your youth a fabrication
Most choices not your own
Your life must fit their model - Conformist, conforming
The hidden truth is that you're
Discarded when your old
Your work your worth to mankind
Deformed by lies untold

The unseen strings controlling,
Their hand involved in all
The numbing comfort it brings - Reformist, reforming
They bring you up to their chest
And lure you to their fold
Your mind a spinning play thing
Broken they take you whole

Conform, Reform, Deform
They'll try to break you, Don't let them take you (defiled in time)
Conform, Reform, Deform
They'll try to break you, Don't let them take you (witness my mind)
Conform, Reform, Deform (All of these people are laid to waste)
They'll try to break you, Don't let them take you (by grand design)
Conform, Reform, Deform (All of these people are laid to waste)
They'll try to break you, Don't let them take you (the dream has died)

There will be...

[Chorus]
