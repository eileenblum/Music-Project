You can't defeat my mind
You can't divert my strength
You can't control my thoughts
Or topple my resolve
For I am master

Like waves blasting a shore
Comes blow after blow
Absorbing lethal attacks
Still my fortress holds fast
I am not weakened

[Chorus:]
Your attacks come heavy
And I'm brought to my knees
Games like this perpetuate
But they'll never conquer me

Where is your endurance now?
Where is your ego?
The tribulation ends
I'm the last man standing
I am the victor

You can't defeat my mind
You can't divert my strength
You can't control my thoughts
Or topple my resolve
For I am master

[Chorus]
