You infringed upon my life
Crossed a line knowingly
For your insolence and gall
You shall suffer
One thousand years of pain
Will befall your existence
Disease, despair and woe-
The remainder of agonizing life

Cut off mortal coil
For your acts - suffer
For my anger - release
For this dark time - an end

Reveling in creative carnage
Let me count the ways I can make you die
Intelligence used for killing
Instinct used for prolonged pain
Bizarre acts of dismemberment
Strewing parts around the room
Walls once white stained sanguine
A life once precious... chopped to pieces

Severe thread of life
Punish with a knife
Release anger inside
Heal my tortured mind
