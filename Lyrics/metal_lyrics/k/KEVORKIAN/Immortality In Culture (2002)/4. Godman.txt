God-man
I have unmasked the truth
God-man
No longer shall your lies deceive me
I know your essence is but flesh
For years you've hid in shadows
Through evolution of my mind
Comes light which reveals your humanity

[Chorus:]
Religion is a cage
And my mind is the key
Religion is a cage
And I will break free

God-man
Your rules of stone were your shield
God-man
Your shield cannot block the truth
Your word is long since dead
Just like your bastard son
I'll do what the fuck I want
I make my own commandments

God is a man
His laws are dead
God is a man
He reigns no more

God-man
I have unmasked the truth
God-man
No longer shall your lies deceive me
I know your essence is but flesh
For years you've hid in shadows
Through evolution of my mind
Comes light which reveals your humanity
