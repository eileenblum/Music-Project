Prostrated, eyes raised up
Wallowing, begging for mercy
No more dreams to defend
No one left to ease this dying

Decomposing, eyes ripped out
Left alive, reaching for death
Tear me down, bury my dreams
Left to spend death suffering

[Chorus:]
Nail me up, impale my dreams
Cursed to live life suffering

I know thy name
But the pain stops my every utter
The ancients keep tempting me
Tearing at my flesh

[Chorus]
