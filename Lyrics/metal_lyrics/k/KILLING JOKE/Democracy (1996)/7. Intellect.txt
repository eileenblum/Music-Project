Gold rimmed glasses hypnotize 
Acts of love are analyzed 
Rites of passage rationalized 
Reason then gives birth to lies 

Don't pull me. don't pull me. 
Don't pull me down 
Don't pull me. don't pull me. 
Don't pull me down 
A dog doesn't question why he barks 

Kiss my intellect goodbye 
Kiss my 

The mind creates monstrosities 
Paradise makes the opposite 
Constitution of my heart 
A clear conscience all i need 

Don't pull me. don't pull me. 
Don't pull me down 
Don't pull me. don't pull me. 
Don't pull me down 
A dog doesn't question why he barks 

Kiss my intellect goodbye 
Kiss my 

To feel and cry, to move and run 
To laugh at hate and overcome 
To laugh at fate and go as one 
I am happy in this state 

don't pull me. don't pull me. 
Don't pull me down 
Don't pull me. don't pull me. 
Don't pull me down 
A dog doesn't question why he barks 

Kiss my intellect goodbye 
Kiss my intellect goodbye
