It's the age of CVS
Contract to contract 
And my stress levels rise 
This is a job for life 
(there are no jobs for life) 
I am forced to a decision 
I am forced to see the other side 
I can see a way out of here 
I can see a way out of here 

Placards of prophets 
And great leaders of men 
Personality cults 
All over again 

(but) we'll build shrines for our loved ones 
We'll burn fires and lights 
And we'll talk of the old ways 
To find new ways that might... 
...they just might 

In the villages and hills 
On the tundra and ice 
To the forests of kauri 
In the paddies of rice 
By the lakes on the plains 
To the great mountain range 
Love the land and its people 
I can see a way out 

With the hours that we kill 
And the dreams that we hide 
Of alternative life styles 
This savage freedom i love
