Denominations of a thousand 
Different deities 
Congregations, endless carnivals of gaiety 
Why should i fear? why should i cling on to anything? 
it's not how long long i live but how beautiful it is 

And i saw crying. there was turmoil in the marketplace 
I saw economies perpetuate the next arms race 
And i felt helpless and there was nothing i could say 
And then i noticed there's a change 
That's coming over me 

Tapping into the aeon 

Balance of the eco-system, 
Self-reliance beckons us 
Windmills and waterfalls, strawberries and lily ponds 
When skyscrapers no longer block the sun's meridian 
When we wake up to the whisper of the voice 

Tapping into the aeon
