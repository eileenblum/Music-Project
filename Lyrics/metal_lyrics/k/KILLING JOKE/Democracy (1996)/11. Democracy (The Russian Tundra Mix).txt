You have a choice, we are your voice 
Red, blue or yellow. 
We will ridicule the green 
Another five lane motorway 
(You'll never even get a referendum anyway) 
Funny handshakes, insider dealings 
Et in Arcadia, Arcadia ego 
Backhanders and salamanders 
A powerhouse that is morally Mechula 

I'm sorry democracy is changing 

I'm not a slogan or a badge 
Or a cross in the ballot box 
Neither values or objectives 
You do not represent my deepest thoughts and wishes 
Education in obsolete skills 
Stereotyping and media projection 
Industrial psychologists 
Plan a campaign that is financed by big business 

I'm sorry democracy is changing 

You have a choice, we are your voice 
Red, blue or yellow. 
We will ridicule the green 
Another five lane motorway 
(You'll never even get a referendum anyway)
