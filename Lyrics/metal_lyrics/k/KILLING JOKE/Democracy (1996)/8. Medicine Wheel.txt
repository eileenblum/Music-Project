She walks up by the path 
Into a mountain side 
Sedona red the landscape 
An offering for her life 
She starts to rub her red clay 
Across her fair white skin 
She starts to dance and play 
She plays a drum and sings 

She builds a medicine wheel 

He studied physics there 
An undergraduate 
But in the coffee shop 
He talks of gaia's love 
He talks of gaia's love 
He speaks out how he feels 
He turns the medicine wheel 

He builds a medicine wheel 
We build a medicine wheel 

I...am so grateful 

He wields a band of fire 
To fill his heart's desire 
And how the wolves they bay 
He hears a brand new day 
With reverence he plays his song 
Stone by stone he carries on 
Following some high ideal 
He turns the medicine wheel 

He turns a medicine wheel 
He builds a medicine wheel 
She builds a medicine wheel 
We build a medicine wheel 
He builds a medicine wheel 
She builds a medicine wheel 
We build a medicine wheel 
We build a medicine wheel
