I remember the sun beating down across my back 
The taste of olives and pleasures that you taught me 
And we broke bread and then we drank cheap white wine 
Memories of happiness frozen for all time 

I hear you crying in my heart 
Absent friends shall live by love 
Remember places of my past 
Absent friends shall live by love 
And the dead shall live again 
Absent friends shall live by 
Love... love... love... love 

And I remember laughing so much we cried 
You knew my every thought, there was nothing I could hide 
We celebrated moons, we marvelled at the night sky 
With flute and drum and pen, we were grateful for our lives 

I hear you crying in my heart 
Absent friends shall live by love 
Remember places of my past 
Absent friends shall live by love 
And the dead shall live again 
Absent friends shall live by 
Love... love... love... love
