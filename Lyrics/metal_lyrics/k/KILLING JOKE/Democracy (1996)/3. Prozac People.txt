I woke up in the darkness and i tried to see the clock 
It was four a.m. 
I was curled up like a foetus and my muscles were stretched taut 
I couldn't face the burden of another week of worry 
I was broken 
I took a green and yellow pill. washed down with filter coffee 
'til it kicked in 

Get me out 
Keep me up 
Level me out 

I was isolated by the way i thought and felt 
They saw my moodswings 
I travelled down the longitude of opposite emotions 
I bi-polar 
In the north they saw my upside. my excitable and optimistic spirit 
In the south they saw my anger and my tears and my despair 
They saw my moodswings 

Get me out 
Keep me up 
Level me out 

I was one of the prozac people 
I was one of the prozac people 

Don't monitor this guinea pig for research any more 
I will try again 
Pharmaceutical conglomerates just count me as a unit 
For their product 
Identify the enemy. remove the source of fear 
Start to change my life 
It's a false state of elation 
You can join the prozac nation 
If you want to 

Get me out 
Keep me up 
Level me out 

I was one of the prozac people 
I was one of the prozac people
