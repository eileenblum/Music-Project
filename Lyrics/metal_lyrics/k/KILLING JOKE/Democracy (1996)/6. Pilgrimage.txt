My values altered i was looking for peace 
I was tired in the lands of the west. 
I had to get out 
I took a map, let the pendulum swing 
I wrote a note, took my prayer mat and left 
On a prayer and a wing 

And every moment of my life 
I dedicate to you 
And when i fear of falling 
I am in your hands 

Pilgrimage 

Through the archway in the city of light 
The procession began 
I heard their praises rise like incense to heaven 
I'd awoken from a long time ago 
I fell to my knees 
I kissed the ground then i started to cry 

And every moment of my life 

I dedicate to you 
And when i fear of falling 
I am in your hands 

Pilgrimage 
So wonderful 

I saw the merchants selling saffron and spice 
I felt acceptance for the fate of my life 
I was thirsty then i came to a spring 
I had to have faith 
I was hungry, you sent a stranger to me 
She shared out her food 

And every moment of my life 
I dedicate to you 
And when i fear of falling 
I am in your hands 

Pilgrimage
