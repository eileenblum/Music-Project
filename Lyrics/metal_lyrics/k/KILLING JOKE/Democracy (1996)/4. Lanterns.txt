Equinox sun. Summers of fun
No mortgage repayments to weigh my mind
And if it all fell through tomorrow
Put my pack on my back
And it's home where the lunatics roam
Faith, faith moved a mountain
Where the rivers are so clean
And the consciousness so green
And the luminous folk shine like
Lanterns of hope

Lanterns of hope shine on
Lanterns of hope

Ribbons of wishes, tied to the trees
Hives full of honey, yield to the seed

And if it all fell through tomorrow
Put my pack on my back
And it's home where the lunatics roam
Faith, faith moved a mountain
Where the rivers are so clean
And the consciousness so green
And the luminous folk shine like
Lanterns of hope

Lanterns of hope shine on
Lanterns of hope

Fire, fire light the lantern
When we drink from the streams
And we grow our own greens
And the fences have all been torn down

Lanterns of hope [8x]
