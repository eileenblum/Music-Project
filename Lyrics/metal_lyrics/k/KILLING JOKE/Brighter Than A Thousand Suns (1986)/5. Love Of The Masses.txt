Around, around, young men and women move 
Through sun and steel our lives transforming 
To forge a link flow backwards to our source 
And forfeit self amongst the masses 

Why do we love them? 
Love of the masses 

They fight and play in timeless rivalry 
The people clamour for a loser 
WIth joy and sorrow mixed we realize 
That epace shall come by sacrifice 

Why do we love them? 
Love of the masses 

As proud as heroes walking hand in hand 
The common destiny we're sharing 
And all affected without prejudice 
Shall forfeit self amongst the masses 

Why do we love them? 
Love of the masses.
