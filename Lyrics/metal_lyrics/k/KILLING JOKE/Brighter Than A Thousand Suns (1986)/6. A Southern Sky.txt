Peace at the break of dawn, mist on the shore 
Time is healing everything, time is standing still 
A voice, that is singing in my head 
With the breeze, the waves, the sea 
As we start to move as one 

Down from the hills, into the forest 
Walking on sand, into the water 
I've been dreaming - islands on my mind 

Down from the hills, into the forest 
Walking on sand, into the water 
I've been dreaming -under a southern sky 

Bright are the scented flowers, many shades of green 
Water from the purest spring - man is finding wealth 
Down by the clearing in glades of fern and palm 
Invocations rising from servants of the Star 
And walk with the breeze, the waves, the earth 
As we move in unison 

All the seeds blowing further to the south 
Continuity when all's said and done. 
All the seeds blowing further to the south 
Continuity when all's said and done.
