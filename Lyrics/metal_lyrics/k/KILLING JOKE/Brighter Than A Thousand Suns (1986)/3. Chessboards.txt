We in our infancy, led down shining paths 
Shine, shine, shining paths, divine our disillusion 
Face our imperfection, I begin to wonder 
Onion peelings scattered, we've been crying crying. 

Open our eyes and tears run down 
I open my eyes and tears run down 
I look through your mind and tears run down 
And under the skies and tears run down. 

Look at our condition, stand on concrete dias 
Lovers frail and naked move like pawns on chessboards 
I had no idea, I had no conception 
Where have we all come from? Where are we all going? 

Open our eyes and tears run down 
I open my eyes and tears run down 
I look through your mind and tears run down 
And under the skies and tears run down. 

All these changes we shall witness 
I will try to understand 
Share your grief and your confusion, compassion in us cries 
No divine intervention, only moves on black and white 
Great schemes, great schemes are also made of these. 

Open our eyes and tears run down 
I open my eyes and tears run down 
I look through your mind and tears run down 
And under the skies and tears run down.
