The age of miracles, assent of man in strident tones 
Realms of fantastic have been forged by folly speed and steel 
Out of the cones stream forth, creation is not yet complete 
New species come, old species fall to nature once again. 

Now that I've found god on every side - and in every legion 

Revolution 
Points of no return 
Evolution 
We cross the rubicon 

The shipyards blaze, vibrant arsenals wait their turn 
Idols of rational worlds to worship power, to worship strength 
Great crowds excited by riot, pleasure, work 
Insane crusades, destructive gesture of the freedom bringers 
And all the bells shall toll, as holy banners fly 
And all with talk of freedom 

Revolution 
Points of no return 
Evolution 
We cross the rubicon 

Let rage and hate of races run from Adam down 
The magic of our science shines brighter than a thousand suns 
Liberty in new dimensions ruthless and spectacular 
Obliteration shall be poetry of 'Golden Dawns' 
And as the people thrill, I stand and comprehend upon the threshold. 

Revolution 
Points of no return 
Evolution 
We cross the rubicon
