Bleak are the hearts in summer, long wintertme 
We are god children running, immortal child 
Out on the chill horizon, shine morning stars 
Configurations I'll remember herald one season always 

Run, run, run, how we run 
We cry like children 
In wintergardens now. 

Run, run, run, how we run 
And play like children 
In wintergardens now. 

Cry for the pride in our wars, the tragedy 
Lost in this blinding frenzy, all knowledge fades. 
Crimes of humanity or courageous deeds? 


No longer see injustice in self destruction always. 

Visions of pna transforming, new heavens come 
Eternal are the grey skies, gardens invert 
Nightshades of Eden touch me, forever touch 
No god has answered prayers here (except ourselves). 

Run, run, run, how we run 
We cry like children 
In wintergardens now. 

Run, run, run, how we run 
And play like children 
In wintergardens now.
