The days I wonder, the nights I ponder, and time is running out. 
I saw restrictions of mortal lifespan, and hurled the lance beyond. 

The stone that's bleeding, the rock that's breathing, the war that's in our blood. 
Rapid formations, and celebrations, my Universe shall march. 

Through love of a labour, one law to follow, until the day is done 
We take our places amongts the mortals, but soon the day is done.
