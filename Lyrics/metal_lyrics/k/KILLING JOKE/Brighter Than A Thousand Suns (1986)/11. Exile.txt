Outside the boundaries where all the streets are empty 
In such a lonely moment we reach the same conclusion 
Chants of cathedral choirs, stations of iron cogs grind 
Primeaval screams we heard. 

Release cannot be found, no 
You'll never see that water flow 
You'll never see the water flowing 

We that have tasted such beauties of corruption 
Triumphal arches raised designed to fall again 
My kingdom and place of exile 
You'll never see the water flowing. 

Your shouts of righteousness jaded our contributions 
Too scared for anger, the cause without a rebel 
No revolutions in four four time 
You'll never see that water flowing. 

I walk down amongst the ruins and past glories shattered me 
Elysian decays, answers that we are finding 
Waters of perfection fade 
You'll never see the water flow 
You'll never see the water flow 
You'll never see the water flowing.
