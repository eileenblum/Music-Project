Across the sand under a crescent moon 
In celebration of our feards 
And rumours circulating in the street 
The candle burns the world awaits 

We ask is this some kind of victory? 
Where is the dream, where is the sanity? 

As crying echoes down the corridors 
The child comes running to his mother's arms 
And all the things I hold so dear to me 
I love my wife, I love my family 

Raise up your heads and voices 
The promise of beyond 
With courage face the moment 
Remember who you are! 

A frightened people losing dignity 
The shadow of an island in their minds 
While fools are bent on making history 
With nothing gained, is this our destiny?
