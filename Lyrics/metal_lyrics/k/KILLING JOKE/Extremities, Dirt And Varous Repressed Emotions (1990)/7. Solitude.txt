Solitude,solitude
We come into this world alone
and to this place we return again
Far away in a quiet place
Try to think of an open space
I watch my life flash before me
Remembered friends that i love so dearly
And while a veil obscures my vision
I surrender to the will of God

I found peace, yes i found at last
All i see has been meant to be??
Down, down in the forest clearing
With a breeze blowing through the branches
And i breathe in and out so very slowly
It sends a shiver right down my spine
In the quiet i can come to terms with
all i've done and who i am
I turn and face the sun
Then all my troubles fall behind me like a shadow
In solitude
Solitude
