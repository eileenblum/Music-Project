Time means nothing 
Time means nothing to me anymore 
Twenty years ago 
Twenty years ago and yesterday 
All the same to me all the same to me 
Yes all the same 
Time means nothing 
Time means nothing to me anymore 

I shut my eyes a second ago 
And I was only eight years old 
Lying on my back in the sun 
Listening to the sound of children playing 
And I remember all my thoughts 
(thinking how beautiful life was) 
So wonderful to be young 
So beautiful to be young 
Rememebring how, how to be young 

One by one, all my friends died 
And my body decayed 
Time means nothing 
Time means nothing to me anymore 
I close my eyes, I was learning 
A lesson somewhere else 
I shut my eyes, I was learning 
A lesson somewhere else 
Time means nothing 
Time means nothing to me anymore
