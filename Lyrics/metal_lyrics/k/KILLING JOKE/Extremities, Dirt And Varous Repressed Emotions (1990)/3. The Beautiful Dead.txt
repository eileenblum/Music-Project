The crowd was one (oblivion ran deep) 
A consciousness of cannon-fodder walking in its sleep 
Vacant expressions (and don't look ahead) 
Everybody dance with the beautiful dead I said! 

All queue up and gravel for a hit 
SOmeone pulls the reins then you chew at the bit 
Encouraged by commercials to spend beyond my means 
I laughed as it all fell apart at the seams 

(Hey! Take a look at tomorrow) 

But will I inherit the good green earth? 
Such a lovely world 

All mod-cons there was dust on the drums 
My electronic beat-box got the job done 
Everybody emulate the pulse of the soul 
And change your clothes (to make you feel old) 
Effort and sweat was a thing of the past (they said!) 
Welcome to the world of the beautiful dead
