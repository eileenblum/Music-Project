By day we're dormant 
Because it's too hot outside now 
Nocturnal notions (as we leave or cocoons) 
Antennae tuned to inuman vibrations 
Shading the cities of the world to come 

I listen to the sound, the endless construction 
Inside the termite mound 

I walked past the nursery 
All the children have gone now 
(The rules we taught them are what they've become) 
Move past the people (they make me feel so indifferent) 
Serving their purpose 
It's their purpose to serve 
A thousand lights from this hneycombed labyrinth 
These winding tunnels lead to my place of desire 
Bars and bazaars of self-gratification 
Live to consume 
Live for momentary pleasures 

I listen to the sound, the endless construction 
Inside the termite mound.
