I looked across the North Sea 
And the sea looked so dead 
(I wondered what this place would look like 
In the next twenty years) 
But where I'm living 
All the shop shelves are full 
Goods to help me shut out 
Scenes of this dying world 

And every time I tried to hide 
The churning of my guts inside 
Everybody failed to heed the warning 
Mother, mother I just stand by 
They push the needle deep inside 
Pump poison in your veins 
Intravenous 

Holidays were different 
All the things I learnt 
All the boys were sunning 
While the skin cancer burnt 
Just for one split second 
I saw the great work of man 
As he turned the forests 
Into deserts of sand
