Scrape my nails across a brick 

I'll describe my mornings in the early hours 
My pulses are racing, my heart beats out loud 
I am north of the border (and I'm cold and I sweat) 
And I worry I worry what tomorrow will bring 

Scrape my nails across a brick 

I walk north of the border and step over the line 
To a place of frustration (going out of my mind) 
I've tried wearing bright colours to brighten my life 
But the truth cuts through fashion, it cuts like a knife 
Just look at our faces, yes they say more than words 
We're so lost in our problems 
We're so lost in our world 
Yesterday - nothing 
But today is o.k. - I've enough to survive on 
Tomorrow's another day
