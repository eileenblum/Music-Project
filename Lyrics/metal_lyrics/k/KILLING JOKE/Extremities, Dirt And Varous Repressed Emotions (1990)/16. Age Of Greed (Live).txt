Ten percent of the land 
Is the hand that pulls the strings 
Be the privileged few (to have to own to hold) 
Power over the people yes yes 
Power over people 
Be the privileged few to have to own to hold 

Money property assets before lives 
Green gestures of a dying planet 
An endless debate only too late 
An appetite for glutony 

The only way is up the only way is up 
But when you are up you have to try and stay there 
So you stamp and cheat on people 
Champagne breakfats (rewards for the killing) 
And a fast waist bulging 
Indulging, in what you call good living 

But most of all there is too much fat on your heart - pig 
A lifestyle of cholesterol 
Cross collateralized cholesterol 
Saving what's left from profit margin 
For what? 
I'll tell you what for 
For some irrelevant conscience easing charity - Why? 
Just to justify! Just to justify! 

Look at this utopia 
A society based on solid foundations 
Educate our children - educate them well 
To feather the nest and fuck the rest 
(Yes yes feather thenest and fuck the rest) 
The waste expands 
(As your waist expands) 
While others stand at the back of the queue 
I mean you 

Still the same old security 
For your creature comforts 
Exchanging the hours of your life 
For the cash you've already spent 
Eating rubbish so you can pay the rent 
Table wine once a week if you'relucky 
In comparison 

Privatise the people's lives 
Be part of the company (or fade!) 
The appliance of science to privatise their lives 

Water is our business 
Electricity is our business 
Gas is our business 
Lives are our business 
Business is our business 

Your money - my time 
Your stinking industrial bathwater - my wine 
Imbalance induces hate 
How will you fill the gap 
Between the endless buffet 
And the scraps of food I have 

I feel hate I feel hate 
I feel hate I feel hate 
(Don't be afraid to show your hate, hate!) 

You just treat me like a commodity 
You didn't know I couldn't even afford to feed my family 
I just want to kill 
I just want to take a gun 
And put it to your head 
And pull the trigger
