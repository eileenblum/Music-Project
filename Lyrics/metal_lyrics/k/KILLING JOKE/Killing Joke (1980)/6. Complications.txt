See the sun turn green 
From my penthouse window 
It's different now 
Because you got no shelter 
Alienation 
By experimentation 
Enjoy yourself 
This is the new age 

Complication 

Ransom the birth
Of a new destruction 
It's different now 
It's what we always wanted 
Alienation 
Self-destruct 
At the count of ten 

Complication 

See the sun turn green 
From my penthouse window 
It's different now 
Because you got no shelter 
Alienation 
Enjoy yourself 
This is your new age 

Complication
