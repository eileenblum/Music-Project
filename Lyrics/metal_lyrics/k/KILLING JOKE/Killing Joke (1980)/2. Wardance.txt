The atmosphere's strange 
Out on the town 
Music for pleasure 
It's not music no more 
Music to dance to 
Music to move 
This is music to march to 
do a war dance 

A war dance 

Look at graffitti
Scrawled on the wall 
You know the the reason 
Outside the door 
You got something 
Nasty in your mind 
Trying to get out 
do a war dance 

A war dance 

You've opened the pit
Honesty is sick 
You try to be honest 
Look what you get 
The foods run short 
And then the money talks 
One way out
Your premonition is correct

A war dance
