Motives changing 
Day to day 
The fire increases 
Mass decay 
I look at the river 
White foam floats down 
The bodies poisoned 
Gotta sit tight 

The wait 

After awakening 
The silence grows 
Screams subside 
Distortion shows 
Mutant thought 
Of bad mouthed news 
It's just another birth 
Of distorted views 

The wait
