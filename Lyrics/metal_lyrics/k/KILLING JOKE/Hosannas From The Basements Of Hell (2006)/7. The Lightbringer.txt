The rebellious spirit in you and me
The lightbringer

Which intelligence gave geometry,
binary system, complex cycles of astronomy?
Number, proportion, measurement, light,
angle, mathematics - all appeared overnight!

Darwin's evolved chimpanzee (lies!)
Designed and built the pyramids honestly (lies!)
You're asking me to wager my soul (lies!)
On that which I doubt the most (lies!)
That the virgin mary was impregnated by the ghost (more lies!)

The rebelious spirit in you and me
The lightbringer

Who could cut with laser precision,
make perfect incision into the hardest rock?
Who could lift one block of stone that weights four jumbo jets?
Yes, your intuition will tell you best

Darwin's evolved chimpanzee (lies!)
Designed and built the pyramids honestly (lies!)
You're asking me to wager my soul (lies!)
On that which I doubt the most (lies!)
That the virgin mary was impregnated by the ghost (more lies!)

Liberator, oh enlightener - Come!

The rebellious spirit in you and me
The lightbringer

Who is the symbol of the serpent snake?
Who gave us knowledge of medicine?
Who knew precisely the earth diameter?
Who modified our bestial character?

Darwin's evolved chimpanzee (lies!)
Designed and built the pyramids honestly (lies!)
You're asking me to wager my soul (lies!)
On that which I doubt the most (lies!)
That the virgin mary was impregnated by the ghost (more lies!)

Civilizer
Initiator
Liberator
Oh, enlightener
Come!
