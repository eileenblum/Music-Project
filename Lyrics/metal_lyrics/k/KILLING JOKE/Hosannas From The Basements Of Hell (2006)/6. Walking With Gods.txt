Fight by day, fuck by night
Prepare to die at anytime
Enemy smash me down
Sill come back for more each round

Salvation's not just a pill to escape but your skill
Fight on, fight on, 'til death intervenes

Against all odds
Overcome all logic, reason
Walking with gods
Feeling high 'cause I've entered Eden

Tribal mentality, our reality
Not held back by hypocrites' morality
Don't underestimate our resolve
Each and every dog has their day

Salvation's not just a pill to escape but your skill
Fight on, fight on, 'til death intervenes

Against all odds
Overcome all logic, reason
Walking with gods
Feeling high 'cause I've entered Eden

Jog harder
Push yourself beyond the limits of human endurance

Outnumbered we are few
Tasted blood, now come for you
You, the hour; you, the place
You, our destiny; we embrace

Salvation's not just a pill to escape but your skill
Fight on, fight on, 'til death intervenes

Against all odds
Overcome all logic, reason
Walking with gods
Feeling high 'cause I've entered Eden
