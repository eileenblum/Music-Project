Initiate wakey - wakey!

Accelerated eco - meltdown, no-one gives a damn
Keep everyone in debt while the big banks own their land
Orwellian, Machiavellian, Hegelian dialectic
World management has come, and it's to be expected

You cannot tell the people (But some of us have guessed it)
Every day is a blessing, i feel the best yet
Majestic yes i feel fantastic

War of the worlds again, a necessary lie
Psychological operations show they were right
Religious institutions and the general status quo
Economy and infrastructure - all of it will go

You cannot tell the people (But some of us have guessed it)
Every day is a blessing, i feel the best yet
Majestic yes i feel fantastic

Black triangles flashing red white and blue
Aliens (or disinformation) yes it is true
Contacts been established with critters from the stars
The surface of the earth will soon resemble mars

You cannot tell the people (But some of us have guessed it)
Every day is a blessing, i feel the best yet
Majestic yes i feel fantastic

Just like magick
Yes i feel fantastic
