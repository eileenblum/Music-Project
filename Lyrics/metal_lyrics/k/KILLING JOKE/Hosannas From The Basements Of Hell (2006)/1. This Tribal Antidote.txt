Lift up your spirits!

Too much pain and suffering, crying
Too many funerals, we know the earth is dying
Gatherers, celebrants, in a state of merriment
This sickness - cleanse us with fire and music

This tribal antidote my choice
Come to the great assembly, revelry, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice

Not a concert, show or entertainment 
A temple, a ritual, a festival of dissent 
Kindred spirits exchange and listen
We share in common different value system

This tribal antidote my choice
Come to the great assembly, revelry, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice

This tribal antidote my choice
Come to the great assembly, revelry, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice

Church of liberty, you'll never take this from me
Barter, no money, I don't suffer from spiritual poverty
Economic slavery, come back with bravery
Here is a sanctuary we'll get away from all this

This tribal antidote my choice
Come to the great assembly, revelry, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice

This tribal antidote my choice
Come to the great assembly, revelry, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice
