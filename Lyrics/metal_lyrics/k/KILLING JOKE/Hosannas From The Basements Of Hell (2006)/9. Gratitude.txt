Let me tell you about the hearts of my people, the core meaning of our tribe
A dream unspoken, a promised kept, the secret comes alive
For all the years I've watched your back and you've watched mine
We always knew the clouds would part and a golden dawn will shine

And when you find yourself upon the untrodden path
Remember me with a smile, a drink, a gesture or a laugh
Gratitude

You look at me but I've been looking at you
We only were a mirror to show what you could do
Oh innovator, oh enlightened scholar, play and write
Rewrite the old books, rennaisance, perform new rites of light

And when you find yourself upon the untrodden path
Remember me with a smile, a drink, a gesture or a laugh
Gratitude

The wise will redefine paradise
The farmer and the visionary, a village - simple lives
Adapting to strange seasons in certain remote regions
Where no-one has exemption from total redemption

And when you find yourself upon the untrodden path
Remember me with a smile, a drink, a gesture or a laugh
A toast for the man who loves every hour of every day
And a feast for the friends and faces met along the way

Gratitude
