See the sleeping figures holding up the clock
In Prague's old town square, blank faces of rock,
they wander and they follow; guides, they call
Then the clock starts chiming: it's my wake up call

A rich man's war in poor man's blood
Silent their cries, the lost and loved
Led to the slaughter, led by false hope
Follow behind the Judas goat

Parasitic humans losing all, I feel
All that we believed was true, all I thought was real
Cheated, then set up by those we trusted most
Bitter were the drinks of party on the host

A rich man's war in poor man's blood
Silent their cries, the lost and loved
Led to the slaughter, led by false hope
Follow behind the judas goat
Follow behind the judas goat
