The multitude excites, the flags are flown 
By fireside the programme starts 
And i am running through this madness 
And all the time i can't relate 

We sit around in rooms we talk our fears 
Asking why we should go on 
God i try to make ends meet the best i can 
Playing rhythms out of time 

Far from the multitudes a few will always stand 
They don't fit in they don't belong - move on, move on this way 

Within disorder i assume my role 
Laugh and cry as i accept 
Eternal indolence through ages 
'til restless souls begin to wake 

Perfection within decades of dissatisfaction and disillusion 

A means to no end, a means to no end
