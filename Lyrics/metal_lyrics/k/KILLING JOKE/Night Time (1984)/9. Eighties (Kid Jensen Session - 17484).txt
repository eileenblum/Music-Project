Eighties - i'm living in the eighties
Eighties - i have to push, i have to struggle
Eighties - get out of my way, i'm not for sale no more
Eighties - let's kamikaze 'til we get there

And we sang
You do it this way

Eighties - by day we run by night we dance, we do
Eighties - i'm in love with the coming race
Eighties - i've got the best, i'll take all i can get
Eighties - i'm living for the eighties

Eighties - i'm living in the eighties - i push
Eighties - i'm living
Eighties - i'm living in the eighties - i struggle
Eighties - i'm living

Eighties - i'm living
Eighties - i'm living in the eighties
Eighties - i'm living in the eighties - i push
Eighties - push, push, struggle

Eighties - i'm living
Eighties - eighties - i'm living
Eighties - i'm living in the eighties - i push
Eighties - push, push, struggle

[Original lyrics:]

Eighties - I'm living in the Eighties
Eighties - I have to push, I prostitute myself
Eighties - I saw the whole world getting anxious
Eighties - I saw the worlds begin to march

And we sang
In these Eighties

Eighties - I'm sitting on a table talking ideals
Eighties - I got the best, I'll take all I can get
Eighties - Here comes the savage day
Eighties - I saw the worlds begin to march

And we sang
In these Eighties

Eighties - I'm living in the Eighties - I push
Eighties - I saw the worlds begin to march
Eighties - I'm living in the Eighties - I struggle
Eighties - I saw the worlds begin to march

Eighties - I'm living in the Eighties - I push
Eighties - I saw the worlds begin to march
Eighties - I'm living in the Eighties - I struggle
Eighties - I saw the worlds begin to march
