Behind the iron curtain concrete stands
Beyond the open door we go
I watched the quill pen for a thousand years
And future days began to show

Ohhhh blue feather in my hand
Ohhhhh blue feather

I passed strange buildings that saw young men and women
And took down names the games began
New partners for each new dance, then we changed again
I fell in love with many places

Ohhhh blue feather in my hand
Ohhhhh blue feather

My body my shouted out "satisfy my needs!"
And when you called I always always came
Behind the iron curtains she whispered softly
"Touch me my love and make me sane"

Ohhhh blue feather in my hand
Ohhhhh blue feather
