There was a rhyme that wasn't a rhyme 
In a time that wasn't a time 
There was a place that wasn't a place 
There was a race that wasn't a race 

But I lived in a city no-one knew 
Thousands of people, indecisions 
Chained in by sorrow everyone 
Started to wonder how it all begun 
Waiting for leaders to lead them to pens 
Queues went for miles and millions to come 
Fall of because write us a few 
Friend kept complaining and joined the queue! 

Still was a place that wasn't a place 
Still a race that wasn't a race 
Had to find it, it wasn't 'round here 
Such a thought - a simple idea 
Long hall and benches, flesh on the spit 
Music was playing, wine to drink 
Women of scarlet, faces of flame 
Laughter and argue, ever the same
