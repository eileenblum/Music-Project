Land of - better change your tune now 
Milk and - oh so negative 
Honey - and we're so content now 
Land of - Land of Milk and Honey 

And you never even know when it's standing right before you 
'Cos always watching the detective film about 
How it's not on 93rd Street always misses golden opportunities 

Land of - better change your tune now 
Milk and - oh so negative 
Honey - and we're so content now 
Land of - Land of Milk and Honey 

One up three to go, all the hidden motives 
Like daytime airplay - hah- cocktail Saturday 
And the silver disc upon the wall means success 
So they tell me 

Land of - better change your tune now 
Milk and - oh so negative 
Honey - and we're so content now 
Land of - Land of Milk and Honey 

Change the tune now, sales go dwindle 
Change the subject next new single 
Change the tune now, sales go dwindle 
Change the subject next new single 

Land of Milk and Honey 
Land of - Milk and Honey 
Land of.
