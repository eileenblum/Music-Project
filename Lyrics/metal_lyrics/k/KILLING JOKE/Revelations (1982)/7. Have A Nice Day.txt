Extreme nature panic plays anothertune 
Drastic measures taken round by all 
Four years - four minutes still turns my insides out 
I can't help thinking of the cowering families 
Inside the hatred builds 
Spit out the contents later 
So we can - Have a nice day now 

I had a word with the old man at the gate 
Recollections, anticipated days 
The poor old cloth capped man had problems 
Fitting in pitch fork victories in the next campaign 
And down his garden path he stopped dead in his tracks 
I saw the old man's face so sad 

Extreme nature panic plays anothertune 
Drastic measures taken round by all 
Four years - four minutes still turns my insides out 
I can't help thinking of the cowering families 
Inside the hatred builds 
Spit out the contents later 
So we can - Have a nice day now
