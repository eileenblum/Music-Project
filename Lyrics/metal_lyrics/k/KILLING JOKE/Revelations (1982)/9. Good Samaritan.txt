Bright clothes and smiles and we'll talk sunshine 
Although the light bulb's dim 
And my beach ball is getting dusty 
And the fun wears thin - thin. 
It's much the same everywhere 
Diversions right and we're ready to dance 

Complacency seemed to kill the cat 
Curiosity led me on 
On what foundation is your pedestal built 
The great architect to a tower block 
And Uncle Sam says it's not long now 
And we can play our way 
My Marvel comic says a hawkheaded man 
Led to a brighter day 
It's much the same everywhere 
We're getting ready and we're ready to dance 

Happy, so happy, I just accept the way things are 
I'll stick to songs - that's real 
So happy 
La la la la aah
