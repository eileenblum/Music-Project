I found my way 
I walk towards the new day 
Left my conscience way behind 
Tumble-tumble here we go 

I found my way 
I walk towards the new day 
Sun in my blood now 
Tumble-tumble here we go 

Faster we go 
Leave it all behind 
Saw the cities come and go 
Tumble-tumble here we go 

Faster we go 
Leave it all behind 
Saw the cities come and go 
Then i saw beyond
