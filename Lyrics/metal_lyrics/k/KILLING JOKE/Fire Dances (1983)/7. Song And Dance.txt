All time was left behind 
I made my way to the basic man assembly 
Music filled the air and voices sing 
Snd then the song became alive 

Stick hit the skin - i hit the stick 
And we've all been keeping time 
And all the boys been playing the drums 
Let's make our way to song and dance - continue 
And then the song became alive - song and dance 

I've seen a place - set in time 
And pillars tall in my sight 
Then i heard voices sing 
Sweet in the air [they fell through] 
Haunting you 
And then the song became alive - song and dance 

Ways we've lost come flooding back now 
Then my ancestors awake 
(then i forgot myself) 
And in our joy they take their joy 
And in their skills we take our skills 
Then all the lines between are gone 
Then all the lines between are gone 

Stick hit the skin - i hit the stick 
And we've all been keeping time 
So all you boys keep playing the drums 
Let's make our way to song and dance - continue 
And then the song became alive - song and dance 

Song and dance - let's make our way
