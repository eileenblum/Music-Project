twilight open and you're on your own
noon is shining you want fun and games
hear the voices inside your head
let's play wild - volatile
get out my way - we go - take back
those ways - you know
fun and games come out to play
fun and games for unknown days
then you join your playmates in the street
and the nightfires burning and you're on your feet
all the boys and girls - look in their eye
domestication - lost overnight
games get bigger all the time
games get bigger all the time
because the playpens falling - stakes are high
and the child will conquer - step by step
let's play wild - volatile
fun and games come out to play
fun and games
