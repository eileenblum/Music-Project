All the time you see us we'll be on our way 
Taking what is mine 'cos now I'll have my day 
Dominator soul he take what's in his way 
Dominator soul he take what's in his way 
Move in on them 

All the time you see us we'll be on our way 
Passive ways to pull you down they pull you down 
Tear them up and smash them in we'll have our day 
Dominator soul he sing "I'll have my way" 
Move in on them 

Move in on them 

Dominator soul he'll take what's in his way 
And if they fall leave them behind 'cos that's his way 
And then we'll dance a dance - a dance they've never seen 
Dominator soul he'll take what's in his way 
Move in on them
