I am a child of folly 
Now i want my way 
And i don't know good or bad 
But i dance all day 
And my sense of humour 
Getting out of hand la-la 
And the diamond's sharp you know 
All the harlequins they go go 

Such a lovely colour 
So the nasty taste won't show 
And when i'm seeing bitter 
Then the carnal feelings go 
So if you guess my next move 
Then that's more than me 
So when i start to smile 
Then the harlequins will go go 

I am a child of folly 
Now i want some fun 
So i don't need good or bad 
And we've just begun 
Ao if you guess our next move 
Let your sense of humour show 
And the diamonds are forever 
All the harlequins will go go
