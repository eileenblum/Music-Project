Move on - light up the way 
Banner and festival where the wine and plenty flow 
We'll go - let's make our way 
Because the flame within our hearts telling us to move towards 
The feast of blaze la-la 

Each day - move closer to 
Where the noise uplifts my soul, where the "wilful" man shall go 
Start here - let's make our way 
And the mess the fools have made won't stop us in our way 
The feast of blaze la-la 

The feast of blaze la-la 

Let's go - light up the way 
Banner and festival where the wine and plenty flow 
We'll go - until that day 
When the sun will shine again and then we'll all move towards 
The feast of blaze la-la
