Noise turns darker the moments pass 
But the drums keep thundering in familiar way 
Outside the legions multiply 
By and by - you're still alive 

Getting nowhere - can't find no way 
'cos ego ego taking the fame 
Discord dances discord earth 
Harvest thanks didn't go quite right 

Noise turns darker the moments pass 
But the drums keep thundering in familiar way 
Outside the legions multiply 
By and by - i'm still alive
