Only the righteous kiss those lips 
Too much guessing too much "need to believe" 
This is madness madness 

Why should i suffer when i can't see your eyes? 
Whose truth is your truth? 
What brain can you pick? what bones? 
This is madness 

When did living start being a sin? 
If this is today - well what the fuck's tomorrow? 
Whose fashion is your fashion? 
What passion can you buy? 
When you know god is dead 
And you are god? 
This is madness madness 
Madness madness 
Fucking madness 

Only the righteous kiss those lips 
Too much guessing too much "need to believe" 
This is madness madness 

Why should i suffer when i can't see your eyes? 
Whose truth is your truth? 
What brain can you pick? 
This is madness
