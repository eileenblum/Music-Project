Watching the decoys of all description 
Sparkle of colour creating diversion 
The liars are out - they have all the assets 
Crawling for oil they were bleeding for gold 
Fruit tasting bitter and lead in the air 
Butcher the womb and expect her to bear 

Forests are falling there's smoke in my throat 
Machine over man and the mass over mind 
Re-assurance from face on my screen 
Appointment with destiny for those who will run 
Out of the virus immunity comes 
Out of the virus immunity comes 

Watching the decoys of all description 
Sparkle of colour creating diversion 
The liars are out they have all the assets 
Crawling for oil they were bleeding for gold 
Fruit tasting bitter and the lead in the air 
Butcher the womb and expect her to bear
