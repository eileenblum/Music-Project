Sitting in my armchair thinking again and again and again 
Going round in a circle i can't get out 
Then i look around thinking day and night and day 
Then you look around - there must be some explanation 
And the tension builds 

Take advantage - let nothing be fantasy 
How do you grow as you stunt your growth? 
Nothing you say makes sense anymore 
Then you look around - there must be some explanation 
And the tension builds 

Sitting in my armchair thinking again and again and again 
Going round in a circle we can't get out 
Then i look around thinking day and night and day 
Then you look around - there's nothing left to say 
And the tension builds!
