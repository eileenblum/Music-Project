And the Third Angel sounded
And a star fell from heaven
Burning as it were a lamp
And it fell upon the third part of the waters

Asteroid

I'm a ball of fire
Fire from heaven
Terror from nowhere
You'll never shoot me down

Days turns to minutes
Five seconds till it hits us
Three seconds to ground
One second to...

Asteroid
Asteroid
Coming in from the void

On the bed of the ocean
Where history lies
Strange civilisations
Vapourised

Days turns to minutes
Five seconds till it hits us
Three seconds to ground
One second to...

Asteroid
Asteroid
Coming in from the void

I.N.R.I.
Nature renewed by fire made whole

And I climb to the mountain
Light to dark
Behind time and space
A hole in your Ark

Days turns to minutes
Five seconds till it hits us
Three seconds to ground
One second to...

Asteroid
Asteroid
Asteroid

I'm a ball of fire
Fire from heaven
Asteroid
Coming in from the void

I'm a ball of fire
Fire from heaven
Terror from nowhere
Never shoot me down

Asteroid
Never shoot me down
