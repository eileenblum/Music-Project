Silent weapons for a quiet war
Under my skin, getting under my skin
all systems go
security clause
passing of laws
reality
silence, in the air
silence, in the air
acceptance
information from birth
animals are first
then man
Silent weapons for a quiet war...
ID
Not free
for me
you can't escape
implant
implant to the next step
you don't want to protect
you just want to fucking con-trol
Know my DNA, know my DNA
my structure
know the movement of my day
know the movement of my day and haunts
Hypnotize
Hypnotize
Acclimatise
fingers in control, fingers in control
Silent weapons for a quiet war...
ID
Not free
for me
you can't escape
implant
everything is under con-trol
Deep below the ground
Deep below the ground
Blasphemies
Deep below the ground
Deep below the ground
Hypnotize
Hypnotize
Acclimatise
Hypnotize
Hypnotize
Acclimatise
Silent weapons for a quiet war...
ID
Not free
for me
you can't escape
implant
Tear up your ID cards
and stick your implant up your ass
You just want to fucking control
