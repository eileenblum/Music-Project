YouÂ´ll need a bit of holy water
And a little bit of knowledge
Invocation to your holy guardian angel
The great evil around

God gave man dominion
Over fowls of the air
And fish of the sea
Justification of desecration
Who wrote this madness?

Get up! Wake up!
SomeoneÂ´s taking you for a ride
Get up! Wake up!
Dark forces

TheyÂ´re printing up money
That doesnÂ´t exist
Then watch the wealthy
As they cash their chips
EconomyÂ´s failed
Start a war machine
Devoid of moral cause
As we witness the end
Of international laws

Get up! Wake up!
SomeoneÂ´s taking you for a ride
Get up! Wake up!
Dark forces

IÂ´m an inside man
Of the serpent clan
33 degrees
IÂ´ll do as I please
Power for powerÂ´s sake
And two weeks off
In bohemian grove
You wanna come?

All the banking houses
That buy and sell
TheyÂ´d sell their own mother
Just eat shit and die
Like everyone else

Get up! Wake up!
SomeoneÂ´s taking you for a ride
Get up! Wake up!
Dark forces

Get up! Wake up!
SomeoneÂ´s taking you for a ride
Get up! Wake up!
Dark forces
