Sea of hurt, I feel the waves of pain
And now the tide comes in again
Caught in a vicious cycle of despair
Give me the strength to face another day

Oh, sing a song of joy
Sweet childhood, never desert me
Time for celebration, oh!
Overcome with a sense of elation
I'll never let you get to me
Survival is my victory

I sighed and sighed as I was mourning
I said sorry a thousand times
I cried aloud to God for all my failings
But God seemed deaf as well as blind

Oh, sing a song of joy
Sweet childhood, never desert me
Time for celebration, oh!
Overcome with a sense of elation
I'll never let you get to me
Survival is my victory

We drank and smoked and talked until the dawn
We shared our problems and our food
Telling tales of courage and resolution
Through all the hardships we'd endured

Oh, sing a song of joy
Sweet childhood, never desert me
Time for celebration, oh!
Overcome with a sense of elation
I'll never let you get to me
Survival is my victory
