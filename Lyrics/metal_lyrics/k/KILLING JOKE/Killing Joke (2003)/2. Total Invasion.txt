as far as trying to go up
against the government,
well, unless the whole country
did it, I guess..
Now you listen to me..
just enough water
to ensurface the world
Oil baron running the government
so I'll start a war
All votes invalid
use any old lie
gonna carve up your wealth
like pumpkin pie
Only fools won't realize it
won't be told that empires run on the old black gold
It's a global abrasion
it's conflagration
united nations
it's a total invasion
Terrify them
complete submission
this is our goal
this is our mission
Destroy your customs
you'll have no say
We'll clothe your women
the western way
It's a Fucking Crusade
A Lesson In Trade
So all you intellectuals
We're gonna invade
It's a global abrasion
it's conflagration
united nations
it's a total invasion
Mexico city
24 million people
half a litre a day
is their ration
The final push
the last battle
Eden restored
man is cattle
we want your oil
we want your land
we'll take your wealth
you'll have much less
we'll change your god
to the bitch goddess.
It's a global abrasion
it's conflagration
united nations
it's a total invasion
It's a global abrasion
it's conflagration
united nations
it's a total invasion
