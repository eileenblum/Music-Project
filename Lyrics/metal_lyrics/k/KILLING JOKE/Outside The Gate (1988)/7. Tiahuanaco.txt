I was a tourist in the Andes 
On my way to Tiahuanaco 
Where the balance of a weeping god 
Faced east to the rising sun 

But I looked out the window 
And all I could see 
Was the face of a girl 
She was looking at me 

She was begging for food 
Then I knew I had found 
The weeping god 
In the face of a child 

As she gestures with her fingers 
Her little brother followed suit 
And all I did was take my camera 
So the image never fades away 

I no longer saw the great gate of the sun 
Nor the dawn of time when our race had begun 
Just black eyes like starving dogs looking at me 
A weeping god was all I'd ever see 

And as I sat in contemplation beyond all charity 
Losing the magic and meaning of living 
(the earth and the stars these things are mine) 
And when they've drained the earth of all resources 
We'll face the music still 
For you and I shall be striking memories 
In the thoughts of our children's children 

I had arrived at my destination 
At the gate of the rising sun 
We shall again regain in sunset that balance 
That we left undone 

I stared at the shacks and the shanty town mess 
I couldn't help but to think of the West 
The balance was lost and my reason went wild 
As the weeping god came alive in the child 

I began to weep 
And I remember the violation 
Determination came, 
Determination, Yeah!
