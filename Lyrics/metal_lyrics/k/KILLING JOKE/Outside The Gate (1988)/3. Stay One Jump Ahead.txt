Province, state and country
The great divide has come
Ten percent shall prosper
To them the kingdom come

I can see trends behind trends
I can see

Jack has bought a business
Pete inherits home
Jill has got a trust fund
They've all been buying fun

I can see trends behind trends
I can see
Stay one jump ahead

Jack's alright he's a predator
He'll give you three good reasons that'll change your mind

1) You can't afford the B.U.P.A. health scheme
So when you get sick you're going to die

2) You can't afford to buy your own property
So when the rent goes up then you're on the street

3) You can't afford the bills and pills you need
You've got to get them cause they're going to get you

Anger is your friend now, resentment is the key
Patience as a virtue so be accessary
Or you can always be a victim
A victim of the circumstance if you like?
Stay one jump ahead

The Whitehouse played the game their own way
Their foreign policies gave me the shits
I didn't understand until I read
St. John's acoount of Apocalypse

American heroes Colonel Oliver North
Everybody says he was just doing his job
Arms for the hostages, it's plain to see
Why the very next day they bombed Tripoli

Terrorists were everywhere
Blowing Greenpeace ships right in the air
Wall Street crashed and the hurricane
Tore the trees from their roots, derailed the trains

London twon ground to a halt
And everybody said it wasn't our fault

Waether goes crazy
Nature goes crazy
Man goes crazy
Nature goes crazy
Stay one jump ahead

Incredible induction of such awesome energy
The sound satisfaction signify Geordie celebrity
Taking the guitar playing like he's a killer
He doesn't really matter cos you know he's gonna bill up
All the sound resounding into your brain
You know so you can never run away he;s pumping like a train

Chiffity Chaff

I'm goind down the track
I can do as I feel cos he never takes the slack
The rhythm that's riding is taking you much further
The posse in the house yo they say I'm Kruger
Murder that they give you will tak you on down
Because he is the boss of the guitar sound

Anger is your friend now, resentment is the key
Patience as a virtue so be accessary
Or you can always be a victim
A victim of the circumstance if you like?
Stay one jump ahead
