In bleak and empty places we can watch from a greater distance 
- the credulous delighting in every nation 

Don't lose your sense of humour, entertain the wildest thoughts 
We can walk for miles and miles without seeing anybody 
Some country rare and blessed away from this confusion 
No message for the masses only you and me 

The long winter is coming and instinct is telling me to fly towards the south 

I want to be in a place of beginnings, not endings! 

Forget all your belongings - leave the city, come unto the ends of the earth with me 

All our friends and relatives fell for neatly packaged policies 
And we shuddered at the headline, newsflash of the tensions in the Middle East 
You know as well as I do detente can't last forever 
Or overpopulation 
Me? I'd rather watch 

Peace of mind is my priority 

The long winter is coming and instinct is telling me to fly towards the south 

I want to be in a place of beginnings, not endings! 

Forget all your belongings - leave the city, come unto the ends of the earth with me
