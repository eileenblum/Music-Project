The sun is setting in on England's green and pleasant land 
AT dusk I leave the town to tear the fences down 
And I ignore the voice of education sighing and crying in my head 

In the light of every dream, we're all coming home 
Lazy days and summer haze, my love of this land 

Memories of gentlemen and cricket fade away in the hot summer 
But still they carry out traditions of the past without a meaning 

In the light of every dream, we're all coming home 
Lazy days and summer haze, my love of this land 

New towns and concrete towerblocks, inhuman as they stand 
And did those feel in ancient times, or was it just our imaginations? 

In the light of every dream, we're all coming home 
Lazy days and summer haze, my love of this land
