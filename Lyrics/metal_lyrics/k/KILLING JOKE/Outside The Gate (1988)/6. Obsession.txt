London, New York, Paris, Tokyo 
All is one with the multi-nationals 
Total monopolies I can sink or swim 
Adrenalin is rushing through every action 

Whole nations crave for release from the suspense 
And I explode in you, my beautiful obsession 

I've been dreaming all your nightmares 
Holocausts, invented fantasies 
We build the tower, tower falls down 
All my dreams come true 

Sweet Jesus &amp; Mohammed 
Disputes between the boys 

Whole nations crave for release from this suspense 
And I explode in you, my beautiful obsession
