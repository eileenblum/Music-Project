I here 
I hear the calling 
Carry across the landscape 

I hear it echo from every city to every village upon the earth 
From every rooftop to every mountain 
Calling the faithful to find themselves 
A fire burning like precious water, the fire that drives me on and on 

Through hell I shall reach heaven 
I shall not resist the changes before me 
View the madness with perspective 
(the clock is ticking but time means nothing) 
So I ascend to the blinding light 
Then plummet to the thickest darkness 
(and I always tell myself how splendid is the adventure!) 
I can no longer see good or evil 
But worship polarity 

So do not trust the beggars that expose their poverty of spirit 
Bleating "I will follow" 

I heed 
I heed the calling 
Follow yourselves as leaders 

Arise, arise, stand upright and take pride in who and what you are 
Great changes are coming and you will be asked to identify yourself 
So run like a lion with inexhaustible strength from world to world 
Let your work shine unto the ends of time yeah unto the ends of time.
