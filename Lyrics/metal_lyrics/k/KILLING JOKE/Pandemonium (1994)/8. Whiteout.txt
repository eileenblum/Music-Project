Leave my body lose myself 
Leave this planet and leave this hell 
Born in the east die in the west 
I never rest i never rest - whiteout 

Backwards backwards lose all time 
Intellect made us blind 
Analysis paralysis 
Analysis paralysis - whiteout 

Hear dog bark don't ask me why 
Be born grow old with grace and die 
Salmon leap sower reap 
As crow flies so heat rise - whiteout 

Need to fill drink this wine 
Knock back the juice see the signs 
Leave my body lose myself 
Leave this planet leave this hell - whiteout
