Rise from my unconscious let it rise 
Get it out get it out get it out 

Behind the illusion of reality 
Are forces that speak to me 
We will draw them out 
We will cast them out 

Drink wines that foam 
Watch the ugliness rise 
Watch it bubble to the surface 
Let it out let it rise 

All the hate all the hate 
I saw you 
You just wanted to take a razor and cut his face until it bled 
You wanted to inflict 
I saw the barbed hooks penetrate deep into the side of his flesh 

Get it out 

Let it rise 
Let it rise let it bubble to the surface 

Get it out 

All desires that are undeclared 
All resentments [their mockeries will show] 
Bulging eyes the animal soul begins to rise 
Let it out 

Get it out 

Let it rise - let the images rise 
Let it rise - let it bubble to the surface 
Get it out - get it out - get it out now 
Let it rise to the surface - let it rise - let it rise - guilt 

All your guilt and the pain and the hurt you cause 
All the tears in the child's face 
All resentment undeclared 
Let it rise 
Let it rise let it bubble to the surface 

Clean it up - clean it up 
Cover yourself with water 
Wash it away, that's right, wash it away 
Wash it all away, wash away the tears
