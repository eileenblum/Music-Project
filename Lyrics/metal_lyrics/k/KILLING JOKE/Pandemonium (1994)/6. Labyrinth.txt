Running through this maze - cry at what i see 
A civilisation with values alien to me 
All the role models, lost souls, false gods that i am shown 
Ordeals that i pass through for purposes unknown? 
In the cul-de-sac turn back on my trade from the cul-de-sac 

Help try getting me out 
In a transient phase 
At the end of an age 
Running through this maze 

Some born again idiot tracks me down and i couldn't escape 
Trying to notch up points for his entrance fee to new jerusalem 
"Do you love the lord your god with all your dogma?" 
He said "you'll get it all back in the next life" 
Get it all back, get it all back 

Get it all back 

Mystery schools for the fools, great seats of learning 
Business, lawsuits, market forces - no philosophy courses 
A bachelors degree in loopholes and a masters in self-interest 
Studies for automatons and syllabus two 
A city and guilds in extortion and a ph.d. in fuck you
