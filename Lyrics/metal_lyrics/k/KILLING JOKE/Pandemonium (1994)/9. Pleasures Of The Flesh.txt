I feel this wave that is carrying me 
And i'm unable to stop 
I stand outside of my body 
But it continues to walk 
Love me and touch me 
Your body my feast 
Torn between two sides of my nature 
Half god and half beast 

This hunger in my flesh my instinct says it knows what's best 
And when the animal takes hold feel forces outside my control 

And then my mind starts to work out 
What's going on 
While the knot in my stomach 
Is telling me something's wrong 
Yes it's all the pain that i'm feeling 
And the guilt that i hide 
Yes it's all the hurt that i caused you 
And all the tears that i've cried 

This hunger in my flesh my instinct says it knows what's best 
This craving comes and all i want is more - just a little bit more 

To be shameless is blameless if we be what we are 
If freedom is what i suspect 
Then tomorrow will jar against your conditioning 

This hunger in my flesh my instinct says it knows what's best 
But when the animal takes hold feel forces outside my control
