I see patterns in the wind and in the sand 
I see the stars, i read the clouds, i understand 
Then the madness overwhelmed (i lost control) 
It was cut out for each stain upon my soul 

All who died (and everything is alive) 
Communion 

I saw a man, i knew his face, he called my name 
And the house i'd never seen still looked the same 
Then i found all my possessions by the fire 
The physical world fell into place i had all i desired 

The mind begins to doubt what the heart already knows 
Reason gives into rhyme, mind begins to blow 
Reoccurring people numbers faces 
And i abandon all my need for explanation
