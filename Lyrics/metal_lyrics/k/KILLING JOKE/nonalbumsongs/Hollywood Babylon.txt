[Showgirls (1995) Soundtrack]If I expose my jealousy to you would you love me as I am
If I expose my weakness to you would you love me as I am

Just another piece missing...
Just another piece missing in the jigsaw puzzle

If I told you of the way I amuse myself would you love me as I am
If I expose the thoughts of sexual violence would you love me as I am

Just another piece missing...
Just another piece missing...
Just another piece missing...
Just another piece missing in the jigsaw puzzle

Just another piece missing...
Just another piece missing...
Just another piece missing in the jigsaw puzzle

If I expose my thoughts of sexual fantasy would you love me as I am
If I told you all about the things I've done do you love me as I am

Just another piece missing...
Just another piece missing in the jigsaw puzzle
