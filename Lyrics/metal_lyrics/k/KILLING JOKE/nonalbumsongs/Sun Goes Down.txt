[Wilful Days (1995) Compilation]We watch them going nowhere, kicking the football 
No purpose...??the point boys?? in oblivion 
Or play games so child-like...they want to win 
Look out my windowsill watch bloodshed 

We watch the sun go down 
We watch the sun go down...down... 

Sleeping dogs always lie...stay sleeping 
??To panic...they play so??...stay sleeping 
Look out my windowsill watch wastelands 
Look out my windowsill watch bloodshed 

We watch the sun go down 
We watch the sun go down...down... 

We watch them going nowhere, kicking the football 
No purpose...??the point boys?? in oblivion 
Or play games so child-like...they want to win 
Look out my windowsill...a man went mad 

We watch the sun go down 
We watch the sun go down 
We watch the sun go down 
We watch the sun go down...down...
