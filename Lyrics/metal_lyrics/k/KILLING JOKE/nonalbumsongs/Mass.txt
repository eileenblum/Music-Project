The odds are stacked against me
Where do I turn for help?
How do I banish worry?
Maintain my mental health
No star on my horizon
What faith will ressurect
Which holy book for guidance?
Which code to emulate?

He owns a block of land
He's dreaming of eternity
Shes owns a ring of gold
She's dreaming of security

Mass [4x]

I saw a frightened people
Enter the chapel door
Repeating meaningless words
Speechless i stood in awe
Church of eternal tears
Church of eternal fear
I heard the laughter of Christ
White skin and ice blue eyes

He owns a block of land
He's dreaming of eternity
Shes owns a ring of gold
She's dreaming of security

Mass [6x]

The odds are stacked against me
I turn to you for help
I can control my worry
There is no place called hell
A star on my horizon
A faith to resonate
My heart shall be my guidance
No code to emulate

He owns a block of land
He's dreaming of eternity
Shes owns a ring of gold
She's dreaming of security

Mass [10x]
