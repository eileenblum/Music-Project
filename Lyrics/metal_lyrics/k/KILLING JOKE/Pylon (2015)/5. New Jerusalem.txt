Fragmented communities
Staring at their screens in silence
All night surfing til the dawn
EveryoneÂ´s hooked on online porn
All the people indifferent to torture
The media gives the thumbs up 
To the Gaza slaughter
Shallow no attention span
No empathy for the common man

In Iraq a quarter of a million dead
How do you feel about being misled
The number one surveillance state
Zero regulation and thereÂ´s no debate
More lies manufactured enemies
Divided nations need a common foe
A hornetÂ´s nest created by the west
A new world order is the only goal
Look what weÂ´ve become
Brainwashed Britain look what weÂ´ve become
New Jerusalem New Jerusalem

Another twat in the number ten flat
Dancing to the tune of Goldman Sachs
Another knob got the top job
Selling out to corporations
Culture adult entertainment
Calibrated to dumb down
Big Brother said strictly come dancing
And everyone was dancing Â´round and Â´round

In Iraq a quarter of a million dead
How do you feel about being misled
The number one surveillance state
Zero regulation and thereÂ´s no debate
More lies manufactured enemies
Divided nations need a common foe
A hornetÂ´s nest created by the west
A new world order is the only goal
Look what weÂ´ve become
Brainwashed Britain look what weÂ´ve become
New Jerusalem New Jerusalem
