reedom so great
To fight for food
Compete for shelter
Who is the top dog?
Is this the winter of humankind?
What has become of us?
What made us blind?
After disclosure comes
Man takes his rightful place
Amongst the stars
The celestial barge awaits
One by one, we embark
To the sun behind the sun
Cast off, steer straight
Into the unknown
I stride in fury and forgetfulness
Towards a house of hate and death
O how lonely is the earth
As greed and blood and weapons curse
To every man a hope above
To every child a tale of love
Between our lips are cities unbuilt
One law to follow
Do what you will
After disclosure comes
Man takes his rightful place
Amongst the stars
The celestial barge awaits
One by one, we embark
To the sun behind the sun
Cast off, steer straight
Into the unknown
