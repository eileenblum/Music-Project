[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]In this dimension everything is possible
As we travel the multiverse and timelines
One vision becoming more than humankind
Prometheus is rising
Through the portal faster than the speed of light
Night vision eyes, fibre-optic skeleton
Metamorphose to man into an alien
Prometheus is rising
Suddenly, I can see for eternity
Suddenly, time just melts away
And I feel like a god tonight
As I reach for the stars
Realisation creating our reality
Visualising, infecting other galaxies
Creators and architects of distant worlds
Prometheus is rising
Splice genes together
Saturate the universe
Trans-human dreams, deities of distant stars
Rebuild the colonies and temples of Cydonia
Prometheus is rising
Suddenly, I can see for eternity
Suddenly, time just melts away
And I feel like a god tonight
As I reach for the stars
In this dimension everything is possible
As we travel the multiverse and timelines
One vision becoming more than humankind
Prometheus is rising
Suddenly, I can see for eternity
Suddenly, time just melts away
And I feel like a god tonight
As I reach for the stars
