[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Understand it has taken over
Understand the extent of the problem
Understand you are part of the sickness
Comfort lovers of the good life
Acquiesce
Like a virus the dispossessed concurred
Where they claimed their descent, their identity
Like a plague, the diaspora spread
Extolling greed as a virtue
Plague!
On every house on earth
Plague!
Accidental curse
Plague!
Across continent and coast
Plague!
They prey on the host
A history of shit and aspirations
As Gaia dies of asphyxiation
Crawling over each other for wealth and power
Culminating in certain extinction
Plague!
On every house on earth
Plague!
Accidental curse
Plague!
Across continent and coast
Plague!
They prey on the host
