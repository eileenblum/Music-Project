Death misery and tears
Calculated waves of fear
Drawn up by think tanks
There's a darkness in the west
Oil swilling guzzling corporate
Central banking mind fucking omnipotence

I am the fury the spirit of outrage
I am the fire I am the virus I am the virus
I am the furnace where resentment glows
I am the bias I am the virus I am the virus

False flags and black ops
Tavistock manufactured shocks
SomethingÂ´s gone horribly wrong
Hot flushes for the Neo Con
A population in deep denial
Contagion released from a phial

I am the fury the spirit of outrage
I am the fire I am the virus I am the virus
I am the furnace where resentment glows
I am the bias I am the virus I am the virus
I am the Hydra headed beast
I am the worm you can never delete
I am the dangers that never sleeps
I am the virus I am the virus
I am the fury the spirit of outrage
I am the fire I am the virus I am the virus

No one believes in nine eleven
Steel frame buildings donÂ´t fall in seconds
Murderers in black robes decapitate innocents
The public banks stare
Did you sleep okay last night mister Blair

I am the fury the spirit of outrage
I am the fire I am the virus I am the virus
I am the furnace where resentment glows
I am the bias I am the virus I am the virus
I am the Hydra headed beast
I am the worm you can never delete
I am the dangers that never sleeps
I am the virus I am the virus
I am the fury the spirit of outrage
I am the fire I am the virus I am the virus

I am the fury the spirit of outrage
I am the fire I am the virus I am the virus
I am the furnace where resentment glows
I am the bias I am the virus I am the virus
