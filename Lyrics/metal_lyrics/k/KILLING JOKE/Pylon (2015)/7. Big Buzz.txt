WalkinÂ´ on familiar ground reduced to tears
Remember friends and faces passing of the years
All those who shared with us the ordeals and the pain
Hearts of gold walk down golden lane

Big buzz big buzz on a high
Big buzz big buzz and IÂ´m alive

Smiling faces of those who always care
All the good people theyÂ´re always there
Follow your dream and youÂ´ll go far
Every man and woman is a star

Still laughing after all these years

Big buzz big buzz on a high
Big buzz big buzz and IÂ´m alive

A time for gratitude a time to thrill
Another chapter a fresh breeze blowing in
Voices of ancestors cheering us on
Never stopping until the race is won

Big buzz big buzz on a high
Big buzz big buzz and IÂ´m alive

Still laughing after all these years
Tears of laughter tears of pride

Big buzz big buzz on a high
Big buzz big buzz and IÂ´m alive
