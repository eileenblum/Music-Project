Nothing is real - all is illusion
Escape from the flesh - transcend the earthly
With fire and chant - purification
Between the worlds is a this sate of grace - called Rapture

Revitalize - to the ecstatic
Re-energize - recharge batteries
Liberation's of incarnations
Liberate with spasms, convulsions

Rapture

Free me from all materialism
Let every breath and act have meaning
Leap Icarus! (O great grain of sand) with certainty - into the abyss

Rapture
