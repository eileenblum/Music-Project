At last the dark years of grieving come to an end.
Old haunts and habits invoking loved ones and friends.
The graveyards forgotten, the churches are empty now.
I recall the times past and how much I miss you all.

Wake up! Reborn! Join in and celebrate!
Make noise! Wake up the great dead with reverence.
On all hallow's eve.

Endless drumming; rituals to wake up the dead.
Bring gifts and spirits, good wine- just cheese and some bread.
Incense of cigars and spices, pleasures we shared.
Light up the graveyards to show how much we all care.

Wake up! Reborn! Join in and celebrate!
Make noise! Wake up the great dead with reverence.
On all hallow's eve.
