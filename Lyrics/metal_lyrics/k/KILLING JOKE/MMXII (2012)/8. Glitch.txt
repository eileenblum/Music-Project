Glitch, get ready for the glitch

Cities on blackout
Satellites are knocked out
I-phones, laptops, it's one big belly flop
Servers, TV, alarms and security
And everything's gone in seconds

Cars are all crashing, planes are all grounded
Everyone knows it's over
Borders on lock down, everything's on shut down, Everyone knows it's over

The solar storms have come and chaos rules outside
The freezer's broke, the food is off, the GPS has died

Communications have all gone down and the world is flying blind
Everyone's at boiling point (and no-one's got the ice)

Glitch, get ready for the glitch

Where's my light, my water, my flight across the pond?
Where's my summer holiday - what the hell's gone wrong?
The economy is doomed, infrastructure ruined
Everyone knows it's over
It's an aberration, they're working on the back-up
Everyone knows it's over
It's an aberration, it's just a minor hiccup
But everyone know it's over

The solar storms have come and chaos rules outside
The freezer's broke, the food is off, the GPS has died

Communications have all gone down and the world is flying blind
Everyone's at boiling point (and no-one's got the ice)
