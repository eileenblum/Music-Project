Rabid inhuman advance of nano computer technologies
Changing our emotional development
For the lure of immortality
And a virus counts as life in a posthuman dream
The future doesn't need us
Beloved Mother intervene

Colony Collapse

A rupture in the fabric of human history
self assembling nanobots and human fallability
Misprogrammed to replicate us
A grey goo of nano sea

Colony Collapse
