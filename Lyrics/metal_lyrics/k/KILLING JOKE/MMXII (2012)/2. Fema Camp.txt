It's a time of unrest and your rights are suspended
There's a list going round (and it's likely you are on it)
The names on the blue list are picked up later
And the red list goes to the incinerator

We're never going to end up in the furnace of a FEMA camp
Burning in the furnace, furnace of a FEMA camp
FEMA camp

There's an Amtrak rail leading to the siding
Where a turnstile waits for all those disembarking
Blue zone, red zone - humanity fades
So I'm going to join up with the renegades

We're never going to end up in the furnace of a FEMA camp
Burning in the furnace, furnace of a FEMA camp
FEMA camp

We're never going to end up in the furnace of a FEMA camp
Burning in the furnace, furnace of a FEMA camp
FEMA camp
FEMA camp
