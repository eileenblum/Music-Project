Songs of joy &amp; sorrow echo expressions of unity
Rejoice in precious moments - chants &amp; noises of purity
Seperated from each other yet bounded by time as one
Past hurts forgiven now we recognise what's done is done

Beyond the veil in dreams we fly,
to soar again and then to die
Weeping at disaster
choirs of endless tear
Holy is the laughter that overcomes all your fears

And did we overcome the shadow - confront the inner rage?
Will all our deeds be sung of - remembered with loving praise?
And did we fight with courage and make the world a better place?
And will we till the soil of and planted the forrest for the human race?
