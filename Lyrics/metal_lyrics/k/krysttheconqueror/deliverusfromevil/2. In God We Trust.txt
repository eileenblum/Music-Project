Sentenced to a barren waste
Imprisoned somewhere deep in space
For in God we still believe
Left to die we watch them leave
Lift our heads up to the sky
He won't let us die we will survive
Wielding our swords for the lord
Prisoners of faith cannot be!
Tearing our chains we break free
With a burst of light the walls are blown away
The one who's captured us with life, they'll pay
And the blood we leave behind won't wash away

Another time, another place
A planet Earth now lost in space
They live in fear, for peace they yearn
For those who don't, their souls will burn
So reach for the sky for our lord we will die We will survive
Wielding our swords for our lord Father your voice we have heard
We raise up our swords, speak the word
For we have seen the face of hell and still believe
That the sword to kill the beast he's given me
So how many more must die that one may see
