We're cursed from a time so long ago
This my son, you should know
The quakes we've been having at night
Is the birth of the Mega Mites
Centennial breeding in the midnight sun
Caused by a war, never won
Mistakes of a man in the past
Results of a nuclear blast
Man versus man, land against land
Life blew apart from greed in their hearts

Every hundred years they're born again
Feeding on women, children and men
The day of the coming is tonight
The year of the Mega Mite
They live tonight, but they'll die tomorrow
One days suffering, pain and sorrow
The only safe place is the sea
Just a legend of history
Man versus Mite, winless fight
Wars begun, we pray for the sun

Do you feel the march of the Mega Mites
Crashing down cities in the distant night?
Feel the ground rumbling beneath your feet
The march is on, now you see them start to eat
Prepare the men for the ride, it is time to fight
Unholy war, human race versus Mega Mite
Our only way to the sea, man's victory
We mustn't fear, we must charge, it's our destiny

Cursed from the start, we ride to their heart fight or be damned, maybe our last stand
Ride don't you know it's all we can do ride don't you know it's all we can do
With hope in our eyes, we're eaten like flies the menacing monsters arrive
Killing us all, we must stand tall fighting just to stay alive must survive, cannot hide
So we ride don't you know it's all we can do we ride don't you know it's all we can do
Ride in the night, fight your life charging the mighty beasts
Death is at hand, life is a stand Mega Mites enjoying a feast, east, east, retreat
So we ride don't you know it's all we can do we ride don't you know it's all we can do
The war is lost our lives it cost humans head for the sea
The Mites have won, until the sun rises up over the east, no more feast, for the beasts have deceased

Now my son you will know of the Mega Mites
100 years they'll be back to live at night
Tell your son to pass on the holy word
Or human life will be gone, it must be heard
Man is not the only one to rule the Earth
Like he was in the past from the day of birth
The Mega Mites are always in victory
Man is not, he goes home, back to the sea
