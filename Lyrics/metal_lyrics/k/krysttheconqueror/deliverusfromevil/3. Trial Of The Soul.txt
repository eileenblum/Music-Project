He'll tear you apart for he knows what to do and he knows what to say
He'll match your will for if it's weak you're his prey
But still I try as I ride by the light of the moon
Heart burstin' inside as I fly, evil around me now looms
The trial of the soul when there's nothing left you can say
For all your lies weigh heavy against you today

Now be judged on what is locked deep inside
Battle till death for your honor for your pride
In your heart you must know what is just what is true
When the devil looks in your face it's just him it's just you

My battle ordained flesh, blood, horror and pain
In God, I put my trust that he'll save my soul if I'm slain
Before the final battle as the storm turns heading my way
Behold the invincible weapon the only thing that'll save you today

One thing I know the true test of a warrior's soul
His battle lies within deep in his heart where evil takes its hold
Is a heart that is true when the battle ensues as the prophecy unfolds

For his thought are so quick from his mouth roll the lies
If you listen to him you are caught by surprise
Believe or die, our swords clash, rings the bell of the doomed
Millions who've tried before the fires of hell have consumed
But his deadliest blows my sword seems to jump in their way
Over and over in my mind these are the words that I say

One thing I know the true test of a warrior's soul
His battle lies within deep in his heart where evil takes its hold
For I was told of the incredible power it holds
Against anything will victory bring in the trial of the soul

For the sword that you hold draws its power from your soul
Quicker than light, cutting deep in the night where evil blood runs cold
So to the bold prepare the weapon you must hold
And ask of the lord victory to our swords as we face the dangers untold
