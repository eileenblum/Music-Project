Through the years, million tears drops of blood glistening
And she sings, speaks of dreams what will come, what will be of a time yet to come
I must look and try to see speaks of love, speaks of dreams of eternity
I've a bad feeling inside as I'm drawn to a place
A hundred corpses woven graves the widow now lay inside
The future is told through her eyes this web be not my grave

From what I'm seeing it's not hard believing
The words of her spell as she speaks
I have a feeling I won't be leaving
One second more, and I'm spellbound
I want to look in her eyes see what the future will bring
One step too close and I'm dead a numbing cold freezing inside
Darkness and gloom as she spins her web it takes your life

Face to face, eye to eye times unwinding as she sings, all it seems to hypnotize me
Touch of doom, for her groom she's paralysing
Hers to feast when deceased her trap surrounds me
They won't stay open, my eyes the vision's beginning to blur
Fever beginning to rise spins her web the face of death in her eyes
The kiss of death is on her lips the grip of death is in her thighs spins her web spins her web

Death is the only surprise cunning her prey with her lies
Taking you down then you're spellbound
Too many brave men have died to know what tomorrow will bring
Another cast on a silk tomb spellbound
Death is the only surprise cunning her prey with her lies
Taking you down then you're spellbound
Too many brave men have died to know what tomorrow will bring
Another cast on a silk tomb spellbound
