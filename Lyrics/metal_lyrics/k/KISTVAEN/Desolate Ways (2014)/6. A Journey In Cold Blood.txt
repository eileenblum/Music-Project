The deed is done!
A ticking of the clock,
A moment of unrest.
A grain of sand in the hourglass of life
Blown away by the wind that is I,
Now forever lost
Condemned to the afterlife.
In one cut, frail body opened,
Releasing its vital substance.
The images impregnated
Will not let me rest.
A ticking of the heart, now stopped.
Hands dirtied with innocence,
Mind soiled with memories,
A journey in cold blood.
Knocking at my door, pale ghost, no one there,
A croaking at my window, pitch-black raven, seeking my judgment,
The trees clawing at the walls know of my doing.
A storm crying for revenge with every passing thunder,
The skies alight, a specter in the distance,
Pointing accusingly, but I fear him not
Because my journey in cold blood has ended.
My sins hidden will remain,
One life extinguished is all the same!
Its voice at night cries out my name,
My sins will slowly drive me insane!
