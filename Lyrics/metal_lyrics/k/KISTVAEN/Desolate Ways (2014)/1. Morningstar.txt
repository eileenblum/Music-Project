O, Tiamat!
Deliver us from ignorance,
Protect us from enslavement!
Shield us from the falseness
Of a venomous and feeble God
O, Azerate!
Eleven slithers of hatred to collapse
The ten pillars that oppose the painful truth!
That deny the enlightenment of our minds
And cage the Universe beyond mortal reach
Black Flame swallow
The tainted earth.
And disgorge the filth
Of the blind!
Fires of spirit dormant,
Asleep, your essence distant
And thus, thou must:
Wither like your book's blasphemous words,
Suffer as your Savior on His merited cross,
Die with your Demiurge's lies on your lips,
Decay with His poisonous council in mind.
Burst open the skies,
Invoke the storm,
Gathering light,
Incipit Chaos!
So mote it be!

Amen!
