Deformed,
Your body is mine to command!
Listen to my voice fill your veins with cold
Obey!
Hush, don't utter a word,
Do exactly what I say
And we will subjugate the world
Even God will cower before us.
I am your darkest dreams made manifest,
The thoughts you hide and detest!
If I must endure your pitiful soul,
This parasitic existence!
Then you must heed my advice,
Poor Mordrake:
Kill, spill their guts for their affronts
Murder them in cold blood!
Torture and rape, 
Their lives are yours to bend as you see fit
And in this ecstasy I shall rejoice.
Oh, what can I be but a gift?
If we are to thrive then you must
Ravage, oppress and devour,
Butcher, silence and gut,
Let loose the demon inside!
I must contain it!
The voice is piercing my head
And with it, my humanity wanes...
