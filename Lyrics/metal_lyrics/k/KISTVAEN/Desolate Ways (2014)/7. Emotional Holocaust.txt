Envious and greedy, coveting earthly treasure,
Stealing and lying for its own pleasure.
Egotistical, self centered maniac!
Never too much, never enough!
Higher than law or god,
Severing lives as if they were its own.
Wrathful, anger-filled being!
Its hate will not stay its hand!
Selling mind, soul and body,
Drenched in debauchery,
Lustful, disease-ridden imbecile!
Slave to pleasure for pleasure's sake!
Beware the human filth,
Desiring the very skin off your bones,
Beware the animal inside,
Its emotional holocaust shall be your doom.
Of all the poxes, of all the curses, of all existence,
Humanity is the worst taint:
Decaying everything around it,
Destroying anything above it.
Destined to sunder
Precious life 
Forever more.
Eternally wailing, hungering,
It basks in the blood of its peers,
Seeking the road to guilt and fulfillment,
In the end to rot and fade away.
Our filthy race will no longer intervene
In shaping of the world.
Wiping ourselves out is the only solution,
If we are to hope for salvation.
Our emotional holocaust has subsided,
Everlasting silence reigning supreme.
Only memories remain of our sin,
We are finally redeemed!
Desolate and empty,
Endless surrounding,
Free, at last, with only
Our bloodless husks standing watch!
