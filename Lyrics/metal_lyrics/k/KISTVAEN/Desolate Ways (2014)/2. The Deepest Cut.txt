Heat seeping from the body,
Shivers up the spine,
Mind running wild,
The vision blackens!
Alone,
So much pain,
Too much pain,
Nothingness.
How did this come to pass,
Forsaking hate for worse?
This pitiful feeling
For which you pay too much.
Clawing from the inside,
Throat dried and clogged,
Thick bitter liquid,
Swallow the sorrow!
Alone,
So cold,
Too cold,
Emptiness.
Get the fuck away from me!
This pain that I must bear alone
Without needing your own.
Let me wallow in luscious despair.
What remains is a shade
And echoes of laughter and joy.
Chest ripped in half, feeling so...
Alone,
So weak,
Too weak,
Solitude.
And here I stand:
Forlorn and forgotten.
With my soul damned
My heart is spent and rotten!
