Thrice-damned curse,
You will leave my body
Or I shall carve you out!
With rusty razor
I cleanse this pain in me
Awaiting silence.
Must repress these urges,
Free myself from this agony
I must not fall under its sway
Begone, leech, away!
Instead of quenching your thirst,
Bloodying these hands with hundreds,
Fulfilling your will and be damned myself.
The one slaughtered shall be you, vermin,
Ending my life in tandem with yours.
This hazardous existence must end
Lest it swallow more than it is worth.
This cold blade shall be my release,
With it caressing my flesh,
Slicing its way through my neck,
The crimson nectar of my salvation is pouring out.
No, fool,
What have you done?
Slandering this gift,
You and I are one
And will remain as such!
Its murmur echoes still,
Unable to endure,
Death must come faster.
Crude contraption,
Pointing at my head,
Squeezing the trigger,
Whispers intensify,
Can no longer breathe,
Floor flooded by blood,
This is the end!

This is the end!
