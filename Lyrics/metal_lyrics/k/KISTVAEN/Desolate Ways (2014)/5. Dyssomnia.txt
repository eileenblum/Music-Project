Again, I wake, my vision impaired
I can barely speak, damnable stupor
My limbs paralyzed, I hallucinate
Forms and shapes I both adore and hate
Slumbering incessantly
My mind whirls through the maze
Of nightmares given birth
By narcoleptic illness
Corridors unveiling
Their paths are dimmed and I,
am blind!
The blazing gate is crumbling.
Eidolons entwined
Envelop my every sense
My lucidity ebbs.
Must wake up,
Must run away,
Must get up,
Must escape.
Separating reality from delusion
No longer possible.
This pain I'm feeling is absolute
Vigor scattered,
Composure tattered,
Reasoning shattered,
Senses battered.
