I've been wandering so long
I haven't seen her face

Haven't sang her a love song
Things seem out of place

I will build a roaring fire
And sit her in a chair

I will play my old guitar
And sing her songs so fair

Dream Dream Dream
Of impossible things
And I will fly them to you on
Brightly colored wings

We'll whisper to each other soft
And promise not to scream

Ride our bikes to a small shop
And they'll serve peaches and cream

Dream Dream Dream
Of impossible things
And I will fly them to you on
Brightly colored wings
