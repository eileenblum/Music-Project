Forgotten all my troubles
Forgotten all my cares

Dew drops land
On your lily white hair

The earth is so far below
Sometimes I get scared

But I know if I fall
You will be there

I wanna go for a ride on my
Dream Dragon
I wanna float through the sky on my
Dream Dragon
I wanna get high on my
Dream Dragon

I'll wait for you on the shore of the pond
You always meet me there I know it won't be long

Still white reflections, one is moving toward me now
Soon I'll be floating in the sky among the clouds

Still white reflections, one is moving toward me now
Soon I'll be floating in the sky among the clouds

I wanna go for a ride on my
Dream Dragon
I wanna float through the sky on my
Dream Dragon
I wanna get high on my
Dream Dragon
