You are watching me

I thought that I was, the one in control

You are watching me

But it was not me, that now I know

You are watching me

I thought I saw you, sitting in a chair

You are watching me

But it was not so, you were not there

You are watching me

Somewhere in this room, I know not where

You are watching me

Silently watching, I feel your stare
