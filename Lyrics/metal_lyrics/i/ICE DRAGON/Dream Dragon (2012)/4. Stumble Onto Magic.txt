Growth. Growing all around me.

Know. Knowing all my surroundings.

Show. Show me things astounding.

Flow. Flowing through me like a sunbeam.

Flow.

Stumble onto magic and I run wild
Watch me running now through the forest child

Runnin' through the branches runnin' through the trees
See me runnin' now like a cool, cool breeze

Sunshine hit me and I levitate
Try to catch me baby but it's too late
