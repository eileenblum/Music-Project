I wear a beard of thieves
They steal the words out of my mouth
At night they sneak into my head
To see what I'm thinking about

I wear a beard of thieves
And while I wear it they will never let me be
They've stolen away with my eyes
So that I can no longer see

Thieves and liars
But I brought you on myself
Thieves and liars
If I could only get some help

I wear a beard of thieves
It grows ever longer over time
No they are not picky
They take whatever they can find

Thieves and liars
But I brought you on myself
Thieves and liars
If I could only get some help

I wear a beard of thieves
It torments me night and day
And I would try to speak of good things
If they would only let me say

Thieves and liars
But I brought you on myself
Thieves and liars
If I could only get some help
