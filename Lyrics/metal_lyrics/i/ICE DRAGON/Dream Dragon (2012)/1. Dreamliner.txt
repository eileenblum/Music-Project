You should just sit in the sun
It's a lot warmer than the shade

You should just learn how to love
It's a lot easier than hate

Here we dwell
In the tortoise shell
Dreamliner

Yeah

Throw your pebbles in the water
Don't throw them at friends

When throwing things someone always
Gets hurt in the end

Here we dwell
In the tortoise shell
Dreamliner

Yeah
