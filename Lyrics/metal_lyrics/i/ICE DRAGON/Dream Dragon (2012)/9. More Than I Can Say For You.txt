You keep comin' around
Acting cold and rude

Seems like everytime we meet
You're in some kind of mood

Hate to be the bearer of bad news

But you don't look so good
And got a bad attitude

You can't bring me down
Cuz I'm already lower than you
You can't tell me I'm wrong
Cuz I already play the fool

But at least I got a heart
And that's more than I can say for you
At least I got a heart
And I know how to use it too

I'm just tryin' to lend a hand
Just tryin' to help you out

Need to put away your hangups baby
Leave them on the shelf

You're never wrong, you blame somebody else

Need to stop and take a look at yourself

You can't bring me down
Cuz I'm already lower than you
You can't tell me I'm wrong
Cuz I already play the fool

But at least I got a heart
And that's more than I can say for you
At least I got a heart
And that's more than I can say for you
