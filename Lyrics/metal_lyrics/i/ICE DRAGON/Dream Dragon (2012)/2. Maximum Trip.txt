Let out the clutch
And put it down

Straight to the floor
And spin 'em now

Smoke up the road
And blow the light

I'm like an eagle
Takin' flight

Stretch out the road
And I will go

With clouds above
And dirt below

I'll keep on drivin'
Til the highway ends

And that's where I'll meet
You my friend

I get so high, so high I just got ta fly
I get so high, so high, I just got ta drive

Now c'mon baby that's what I need
The maximum trip, the maximum speed
