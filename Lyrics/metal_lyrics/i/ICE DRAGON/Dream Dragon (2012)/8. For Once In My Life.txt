We met in the rain
And I was with another girl

When you smiled at me
It felt like you were the world

For once in my life, I did something right

I found you

Told her I forgot something
Made some excuse I think

You asked me if I'd like to
Go out with you for a drink

For once in my life, I did something right

I found you

Walking on the bridge is still
My favorite memory

When I close my eyes
Against the skyline your face I see

For once in my life, I did something right

I found you


When I get lost sometimes
You always find me

I will follow you
Follow you blindly
