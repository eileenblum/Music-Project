watching through the curtains 
into your bedroom 

like a beautiful flower 
now you've come into bloom 

many i've taken 
and many have died 

only the chosen one 
may become my bride 

stole away in the night 
from your mother's home 

forever my queen 
come to take up your throne 

trapped in darkened crypt 
for centuries i lay 

forced to rule the night 
and shun the light of day 

lay your body before me 
wrapped in velvet cloth 
trapped inside my castle 
now your life is lost 

trading your soul 
for eternal power 
to watch as the centuries 
take the place of hours 
[repeat]
