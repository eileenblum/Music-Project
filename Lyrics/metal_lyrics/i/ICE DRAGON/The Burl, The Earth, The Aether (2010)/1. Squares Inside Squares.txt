you say you want to take the sidewalk 
you don't want to walk in mud 
you would make the whole earth sidewalks 
if you could 

you'll make your throne of stone 
and i'll make mine of wood 
yours will stand much longer 
but there'll be growth where mine once stood 

mindlessly marching through squared off rooms 
you've taken what once was beautiful 
and encased it in a tomb 

you know nothing of us 
you don't create with your hands 
always planning out your life 
your life is nothing more than plans 

every time you speak 
it's always through technology 
i'd like to use more senses 
i'd like you in front of me 

staring at pictures in small wooden squares 
do you really expect us to believe that you care? 

staring at pictures in small wooden squares
