interlocking hexagons 
marking their chest 
riding six grey horses 
taking you to your death 

see the gleam of pitch black steel 
their minds no longer think 
and their hearts no longer feel 

hexagon riders 
doom patrol 
riding straight into your soul 
hooves crushing your head 
i can't help but think of you dead 

eating the hearts of the old 
destroying the dreams of the young 

they travel the path of infinity 
make their home on distant sun 

hexagon riders 
doom patrol 
riding straight into your soul 
hooves crushing your head 
i can't help but think of you dead 
[repeats]
