here come those sounds that i hear in my dreams 
where astro-logic takes the place of reason 

all is not well, all is not what it seems 
star patterns in the sky change with the seasons 

the warlock sees the watcher through the stars 
eyes shall see all, lips shall not part 

when will you die? when will I? 
someday when young tears turn to dry 

he could tell you all the truth 
he could tell you all the facts 

but he never speaks 
and he does not react 

the warlock sees the watcher through the stars 
eyes shall see all, lips shall not part 

there really are no answers, because there are no questions 
we create them in our mind through superfluous reflection 

leagues of men crushed into dust 
all great planets collapse and rust 

only he remains, still forced to watch 
eyes remain open, they can never shut.
