is that the sun? 
or is it the anti-moon? 
they say the spots on the surface 
speak of impending doom 

8 hundred million miles 
from anywhere 
see the light burning still from an 
ancient solar flare 

black rain and the sky is grey 
the last wave 
the last wave 

no one shall be safe 
no one shall be safe 

sky touching down 
clouds tear into the underground 
oceans overflowing 
water taking the land to hell 

a planet transformed 
their only sun is the lightning now 
dark blue radiates from 
the outer shell 

black rain and the sky is grey 
the last wave 
the last wave 

no one shall be safe 
no one shall be safe 

into the sign of the twins 
mercury is in retrograde 
the winged messenger travels 
until all the stars fade 

three weeks of travel 
through an endless void of black 
he begins his return to direct 
motion through the zodiac 
motion through the zodiac 
motion through the zodiac
