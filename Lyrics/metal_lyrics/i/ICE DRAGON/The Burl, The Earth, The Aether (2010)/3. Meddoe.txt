speak to me of flowers 
speak to me of spring 
speak to me of branches 
with their fallen leaves 

all things need to change 
all things stay the same 
it's a great galactic cycle 
with an infinite range 

mountains and valleys 
rivers and trees 
see them all swaying 
in the cosmic breeze 
[repeats]

listen to the silence 
of a snow covered meddoe 
there is much to learn there 
and there is much to know 

white fox came up to me 
along with red coyote 
and the answers to many secrets 
they told me 
[repeats] 

mountains and valleys 
rivers and trees 
see them all swaying 
in the cosmic breeze 
[repeats]
