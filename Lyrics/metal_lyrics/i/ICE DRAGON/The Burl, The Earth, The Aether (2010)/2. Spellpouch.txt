rolls of parchment thin from time 
I carry in this pouch of mine 

spells of love and spells of hate 
they've taken years to calculate 

I reached into my spellpouch 
and I drew a spell out 

cast upon ye weary men 
who now live to fight again 

words pierce through sword and shield 
the greatest weapon man shall yield 

hear me now great sky and land 
bow before me, obey my command 

I reached into my spellpouch 
and I drew a spell out 

cast upon ye weary men 
who now live to fight again 

worn leather satchel round my mid 
deep within are secrets hid 
deep within are secrets hid 
deep within are secrets hid
