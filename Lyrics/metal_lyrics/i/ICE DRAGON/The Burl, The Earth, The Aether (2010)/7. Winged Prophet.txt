i went walking one rainy afternoon 
and i did see a mighty loon 

he swooped down in front of me 
and raised his beak 
he turned his head toward me 
and he began to speak 

he said darkness was on its way 
he said there would be a terrible plague 

great and mighty bird 
help us to heed your word 
guide us with your shining light 
help us to spread our wings in flight 

mankind has come so far 
but can he escape his fate 
you all must act with haste 
for i fear it is too late 

you are the chosen one 
you must show them how to live 
just use the love in your heart 
it is your greatest gift to give 

great and mighty bird 
help us to heed your word 
guide us with your shining light 
help us to spread our wings in flight 

it's up to you to show 
that there's love left in mankind 
only love can liberate you 
only love can free your mind
