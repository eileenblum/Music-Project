When the sun goes down 
It's gonna get cold in this here town 

And everything you knew 
Will lay frozen in front of you 

The wind won't let you move 
Try to fight it you're gonna lose 

The way it cuts into your skin 
Too much for the fire within 

When it was warm, you had her then 
But it got cold and she left again 

You said it was the last time 
Said you didn't care 

But in the spring when she comes home 
You will still be there
