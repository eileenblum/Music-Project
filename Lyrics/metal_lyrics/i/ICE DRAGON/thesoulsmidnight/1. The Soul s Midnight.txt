Can't feel me toes, can't feel my head 
I am lying here sleeping again 

Can't feel my toes, can't feel head 
Am I just sleeping? Or am I dead? 

When do I awake from this nightmare? 
When do I awake from this hell? 
Am I just lying here forever? 
Is this a permanent spell? 

I hear those 3 o'clock bells 
I hear those 3 o'clock bells 

I feel cold, I feel wet 
I don't feel so good 
I must be dead I guess 

I feel cold, I feel wet 
I don't feel so good 
I must be dead I guess 

When do I awake from this nightmare? 
When do I awake from this hell? 
Am I just lying here forever? 
Is this a permanent spell? 

I hear those 3 o'clock bells 
I hear those 3 o'clock bells
