Scythe and the Spade
One to delve the earth
And one to clear the way

Scarabaeus draws near
Sublime as heaven's
Largest sphere

Fatal javelin
Imparts it's baneful hold

Keeper of noxious ruin
Enemy of old

The humble titan
Speaks no threat
Still take Behemoth
Unto death
