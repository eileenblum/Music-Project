Seasons of decay
They made us weak
They made us wait

For our bones
To push through the gray
Earthen tomb
In which we lay

And the rain
Hit the air and turned to snow
And the snow
Touched the ground and then it froze
And the roads
That we roamed all turned to floes
And on these
Did we row the endless seas

Masters of our fate
We called us peace
We called us hate

For the rest
Of our earthly days
We made our home
Into a grave

And the rain
Hit the air and turned to snow
And the snow
Touched the ground and then it froze
And the roads
That we roamed all turned to floes
And on these
Did we row the endless seas

Our mother who
Gave birth to you
Is now a part of everyblood

Our father who
Sired you
Is now a part of everyblood

Our children who
We never knew
Are now a part of everyblood
