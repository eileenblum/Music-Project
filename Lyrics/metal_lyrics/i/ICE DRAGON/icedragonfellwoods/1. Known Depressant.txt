[performed by Ice Dragon]Wrote my feelings down
on a piece of paper today

Then I crumpled them up
and threw them away

Lost forever in the desert
of darkest night

Stabbed over and over
by the sharpest knife

I need cigarettes and pain
And alcohol to wash away my brain
A little time away from it all
So I can crash and burn and fall

You can keep liquid behind your teeth
if you hold your tongue in between

Doesn't take long for it to seep
down into your inner being

What we take we cannot keep
we are stripped and laid bare to see
