[performed by Ice Dragon]Upon my battered frame
Pours down eternal rain

Soaked through with shame
Speak thee not my cursed name

Fought harder than I had before
Tried to fight the mighty lord
Shattered shield and shattered sword
Hail to thee, Oh Minotaur

Lost within this beastly maze
A labyrinth of endless caves
The fear it comes in waves
My pale white face, the darkness shades

Fought harder than I had before
Tried to fight the mighty lord
Shattered shield and shattered sword
Hail to thee, Oh Minotaur

Your world on fire
Your children killed
The hooves of my lord
Carry out his will
