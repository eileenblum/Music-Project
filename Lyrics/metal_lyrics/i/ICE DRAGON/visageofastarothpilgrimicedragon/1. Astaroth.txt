[performed by Ice Dragon]Seven horns on head
Seven eyes on face
We lay beneath the stone
of your most holy place

Through all time reborn
There must always be a witness
As we are unleashed
To spread our hate and sickness

HERE I STAND
ON INVERTED CROSS
MY NAME IS ASTAROTH

CALL TO PRIESTS
AND CALL TO GODS
MY NAME IS ASTAROTH

Two-thousand years ago
Trapped in their dimension
A cross laid upon our heads
To guard from our ascension

In your quest for power
You shall release us from the grave
Then you shall kneel before us
Forced to speak our master's name

HERE I STAND
ON INVERTED CROSS
MY NAME IS ASTAROTH

CALL TO PRIESTS
AND CALL TO GODS
MY NAME IS ASTAROTH
