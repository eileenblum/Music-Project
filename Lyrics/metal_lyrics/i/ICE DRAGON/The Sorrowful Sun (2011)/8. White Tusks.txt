space boar 
driving at the heart of man 

space boar 
how much more can he withstand? 

standoff in space 
one of us must take 
the other's place 

white tusks 
reaching toward me 
white tusks 
coming for me 

holding ground, 
holding my own 
you will never 
take my home
