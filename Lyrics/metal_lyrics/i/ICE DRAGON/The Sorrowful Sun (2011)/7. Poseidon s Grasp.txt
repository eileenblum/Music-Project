the rays of the sun 
shine on our helmets at dawn 

we take to the sea 
to find the ancient one 

pulling away, manning the oars 
to know only strangeness 
and distant shores 

moon and the stars 
shine their love upon our quest 

we pray to the gods 
our mission be blessed 

to find the shining serpent 
that plagues this land of men 

to find him where he sleeps 
and then we tear into his den 

there he lays, still as death 
under rock and stone 
and dark and wet 

there he lays, still as death 
under rock and stone 
and dark and wet 

dark black sea at night 
shining serpent takes to the sky 
men prepare themselves to fight 
and let their spears and arrows fly 

snaps through the mast 
the timber cracks 
ship torn in half 
poseidon's grasp 

snaps through the mast 
the timber cracks 
ship torn in half 
poseidon's grasp 

poseidon's grasp
