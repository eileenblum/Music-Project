looking to find 
the distraction i sought 
i did not 
i did not 

a race of ancient mercenaries 
how weak they fought 
how weak they fought 

none proved a worthy adversary 
they all fell at my hands 

the massacre came so easily 
none shall live while i still stand 

oh my love 
mistress death 
oh my love 
mistress death 

the emptiness of space 
is a reflection of my soul 
my opponent lies in waiting 

with my defeat i become whole 
the end i am anticipating 

in ancient tome lies the key 
set course for home, maximum speed 

soon to find the one i need 
the being with the power to kill me 

oh my love 
mistress death 
oh my love 
mistress death 

come for me 
come for me 
you're all i want 

in my dreams you walk 

in my dreams you walk
