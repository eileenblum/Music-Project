i can feel the morning sun 
from all around 

i can see you standing 
in your autumn gown 

such beauty we have never known 
the earth agrees with me 

the flowers lose their color 
and the birds no longer sing 

how can they create anything 
in comparison with thee? 

how can they create anything 
in comparison with thee?
