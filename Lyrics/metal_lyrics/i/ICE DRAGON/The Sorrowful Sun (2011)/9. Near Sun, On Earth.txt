i'll go low 
and you'll go high 

i'll sink into the ground 
and you'll float up to the sky 

wings made of wax 
or wings made of stone 
they either melt in the sun 
or they're too heavy to hold 

from time to time 
you'll reach down to help me out 

but all i'll ever do 
is look up at you in doubt 

wings made of wax 
or wings made of stone 
they either melt in the sun 
or they're too heavy to hold
