we breathe in 
they breathe out 
they breathe in 
we breathe out 

interspecies communication 

mayans and incans 
ancient egyptians 

spiritual men 
found god through ingestion 

the burl and the root 
take hold for the food 

the stem and the leaves 
sun, water, and breeze 

smoke into lung 
drink into stomach 

when we stand next to you, 
take something from us 

is that you in my head trying to speak? 
i believe you know the answers i seek 

we breathe in 
they breathe out 
they breathe in 
we breathe out 

interspecies communication
