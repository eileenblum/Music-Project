when they bury me 
when my head pours into the ground 
my thoughts will all grow flowers 
sprouting out all around 

some will be violet 
and yellow and green 
and others will only be black 

they'll tell my life's story 
to all who walk by 
and there will be no hidden facts 

don't be suprised 
if the flowers all have your eyes 
and for petals your long flowing hair 
and though you'd like to pick them 
i'd rather you just left them there 

when i said i loved you 
the flowers all turned red 
when i broke your heart 
they all went pale instead 

when we kissed 
the sun shown through in yellow 

when i did you wrong 
the blackness crept in from below 

[chorus repeats]

when i am dead and i am buried 
in a long wooden box 
alone with nothing but the dirt 
myself, and my thoughts 

i will grow a mighty tree 
straight out of my heart 

i will grow a mighty tree 
straight out of my heart 

and the fruit will bear your name 
and it will grow forever strong 

forever strong
