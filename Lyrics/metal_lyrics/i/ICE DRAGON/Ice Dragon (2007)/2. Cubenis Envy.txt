Half of you are contaminated
And the other half just barely made it

I don't know if you'll ever grown
But I'm willing to put in the time to know

I hope you take my mind
To a better place

I hope you leave the good
And the bad erase

Eat a little, and I'm at the doorway
Eat a lot, and it'll take the floor away
