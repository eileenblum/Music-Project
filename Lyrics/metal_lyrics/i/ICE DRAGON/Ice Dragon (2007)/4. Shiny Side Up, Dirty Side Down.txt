Ride all night
Ride all day

Give me a full tank of gas
And I'll be on my way

Ass, gas, or grass
Nobody rides for free

But I'll leave a spot on the back
For you baby

Keep the shiny side up
Keep the dirty side down

And if the pigs see me roll through
They'll probly chase me outta town

8 days late on my rent
Don't know where my money went

Probly spent it on mushrooms
And weed again

Skipping along like a stone
Like a flat bottomed one

Throw me and I'll keep on goin'

Wind in my hair
I'm the king of the road

Ridin' along
On my two-wheeled throne
