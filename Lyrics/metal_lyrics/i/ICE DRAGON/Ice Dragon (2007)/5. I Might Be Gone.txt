I stand and watch the flowers
Growing in the street

If I stand for long enough
Will they grow through my feet

Sun filling up the sky
And birds flying in the air

If I could jump high enough
I'd be with them up there

Thoughts drifting through my head
But none seem to stay for long

Don't really want to get away
And yet I might be gone

See the wind blowing through the tree
Hear the sound it makes

Bending all the branches
But not one will break
