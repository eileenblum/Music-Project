Watching the water
The leaves flowing freely

Spending my last days
On earth here with you

You brought a man here
To try and persuade me

But I have devoted
My whole life to truth

Drawn into the fog
Drawn into the fog

A mountain of disjointed, incoherent facts
He tells me his stories of faraway lands

Colloidal and viscous
The mind of a planet

Am I refusing
Or do I not understand

Drawn into the fog
Drawn into the fog
