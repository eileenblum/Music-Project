Throw away my cigarette
Watch it bounce across the pavement

Mindlessly walking
Tryinâa figure out where the day went

I donât seem to know much of anything anymore
Canât seem to get my life back to where it was before

I sit and stare at the wall
I donât know anything at all

Sometimes I want to kill myself
Is writing it down a cry for help?

I wish youâd all leave me alone
An infinite cage was my home

Not all that I am is whatâs shown
