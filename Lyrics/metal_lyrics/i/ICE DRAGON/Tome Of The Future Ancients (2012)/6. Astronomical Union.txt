I saw you in a constellation
You were looking straight down at me
With stars for eyes, you lit up the sky
And even in darkness I could see

Your hair fell in trails of cosmic dust
Your figure connected out of the dots
Will you come down to me?
Or should I come up there and see?

We know each other but no one knows us
We know each other but no one knows us
We know each other but no one knows us
We know each other but no one knows us
We know each other but no one knows us
We know each other but no one knows us
