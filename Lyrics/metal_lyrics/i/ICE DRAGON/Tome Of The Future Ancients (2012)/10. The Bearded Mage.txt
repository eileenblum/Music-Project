The bearded mage
The bearded mage

Beneath a sickle moon
Reads the ancient tome

The bearded mage

Lost in the glow
Of the candle by the window

Fire burn slow
The trees are laden with snow

Fire burn slow
The trees are laden with snow

I have ascended straight into the clouds
Spoke into them and made lightning burst out

All power lies in the book upon the page
It lies in waiting for the bearded mage

Gaze among the shelves
Many hoary volumes dwell

All known too well
Indecision casts a staying spell

Settle on the same
Itâs been read and read again

Familiar decay
Tales of hurt and sorrow and pain

I have ascended straight into the clouds
Spoke into them and made lightning burst out

All power lies in the book upon the page
It lies in waiting for the bearded mage

Iâve seen my death in the flames
Stared for hours on end

When one gets this old
He knows nothing but pain

Constant pain
Old and decrepit
Life beginning to wane

All birds fly away
An image cast upon the lake

By my hand the sky shall fall
And the earth shall quake

And the earth shall quake
