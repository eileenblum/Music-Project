Sometimes we need to sit in the grass
Relax our minds and let the time pass

Each blade has thoughts it could tell us
But sometimes they wonât because theyâre jealous

Let our minds separate from our flesh
We donât need them anyway

Relax a little and just take a rest
We have nothing to do today

Roots sprout from our thighs
Sitting Indian style
Weâve been here oh so long
Weâve been here quite a while

Shake the seeds out of our hair
Where they land little weâs grow everywhere
