Words written down so long ago
In a language already gone

From hand of scribe
Down through the pen
And marked into vellum

Cloaked in darkness
The secret remains
Hidden from us for all time

The ravings of a madman
Or learned scholar
We may never know why

Brought forth while in possession
Of knowledge from other realms

Through supernatural process
One may obtain
That which is withheld

The scryer, the seer
Can talk to beings
Who remember the ancient days

When men were more
When they werenât lost
In their mathematical ways

32 gone, 240 remain
Torn out by a dark mage

Who knew of the power
Held within
They are in use to this day

Herbal
Astronomical
Biological
Cosmological
Pharmaceutical

When all combine
Madness of the mind
Destroy all life
And reset time

When all combine
Madness of the mind
Destroy all life
And reset time
