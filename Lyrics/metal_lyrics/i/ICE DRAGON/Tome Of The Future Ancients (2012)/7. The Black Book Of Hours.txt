Bow to the virgin
Prostrate thyself

In the hour of death
Cry forth for help

Then descends
From out of the pitch

Cloaked in the sins
You would never admit

O Intemerata Obsecro Te
O Intemerata Obsecro Te
O Intemerata Obsecro Te
O Intemerata Obsecro Te

The Memitimâs come to take you away
The Memitimâs come to take you away

The black book of hours
Upon its wrists

Pray to your god
This cannot exist

As the heart panteth
After thee

From that book
Beg do not read

The black book of hours
Opens again

Upon your death
Its pages read

Oh god
Break the teeth of their mouths

Fangs of the young lions
Tear out

Oh god
Break the teeth of their mouths

Fangs of the young lions
Tear out
