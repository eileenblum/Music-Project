There are things I hope to find
Iâll be gone when they arrive

There is nothing left inside
Memories now lost in time

In much wisdom is much grief
Gaining knowledge sorrow increase

In much wisdom is much grief
Gaining knowledge sorrow increase


Iâll run until my lungs burst
From my mouth blood runs

Break this prison
Devour the frame

Defeated by noneâ¦ save myself

Take shelter from thyself
Bid the world farewell

Spring forth from out of torment
Try to steal away from hell

What is this that they call life
All we know is hurt and strife

What is this that they call life
All we know is hurt and strife

Iâll run until my lungs burst
From my mouth blood runs

Break this prison
Devour the frame

Defeated by noneâ¦ save myself
