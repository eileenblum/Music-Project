Straight into the dawn
Earlier than I've been up in days
Get up and walk away

Almost as silent as it should be
Cold and wet
No one knows I've left

Wondering is the worst part
They'll worry for a while
Then one day you're mentioned
an awkward ending smile

No reason why
I am a broken man
A stone in the place of my heart again
Replace this sensitive flesh within
Had it once
But it grew
Old and thin
