Now
Force your way in
Now
A sharp little pin

It's better to pretend
Explode now and then

The itch down inside
Something I can never hide

Disquietude, distress, doubt, dread
Lean in and whisper at my head

Disenchanted morning
Bread from restless night

Continue on with jaded
Apathetic life

Take it all away
