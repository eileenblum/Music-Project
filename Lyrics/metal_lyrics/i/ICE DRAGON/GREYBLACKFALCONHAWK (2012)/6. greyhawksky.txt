Become the greyblackfalconhawk

Grey as early morning fog
Black as evening shadow rock

Become the greyblackfalconhawk

Leave to wander sky and plain
Where rainbows soar and where they end

Leave to wander sky and plain
Return again but not the same

Become the greyblackfalconhawk

See the four winds standing still
As warriors gathered in the field

Tall as pine
And strong as oak
With will like mighty river's flow

Ask of them and you shall know
