And what if I told you that all of the stars
In the sky couldn't replace your eyes
While you're looking down me

And what would do if I said that you're mine
Left you blind, practically took your eyes and I
Realize these are the last words I'll say to you

So please excuse me if I smile
We haven't seen you in a while
Afraid that the last time we spoke
You could breathe life
You could breathe life

Take me down from the inside
You're already in my head
Cut my throat and leave me for dead
Inside

You're already in my head
But things are better left unsaid
On the inside

So please excuse me if I ramble
We haven't spoken in a while
I think I'll listen so that I can hear you realize
Tell me what's on your mind

And I believe you if it takes the pain...

And if I ever dream again
Take me back to where I used to be
And 'cause, I'm hearing these little words
They be coming in the same soft white noise
It's getting...

Worse, worse
It's getting worse and harder to know

And this might take some time
To see if it really works
Yes this might take some time
Show me where it hurts

This might take some time
To see if it really works
Yes this might take some time
Show me...

And maybe it's fine to believe the metaphysical and the tales of the afterlife
But I think it just fails presenting us with assurances that we can't give ourselves
I can't prove or disprove any of this
All I know is that I never close my eyes and feel pleasant, all I hear is static

And if I ever dream again
Take me back to where I used to be
And 'cause, I'm here in these little words
They be coming in the same soft white noise
It's getting...

And if I ever dream again
Take me back to where I used to be
And 'cause, I'm here in these little words
They be coming in the same soft white noise
It's getting...
