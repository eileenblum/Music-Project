The voices in your head are calling
And yes you swear to me it's true
And is there something you wanted from me
That I can't see?

These creatures on your skin are crawling
And yes you'll swear your fear is true
Endlessly referencing cold machines
That I can't see.

The bittersweet thing is
As we speak I'm leaving
To bear your burdens here on your own
It's better you than me

And as we're speaking
The bittersweet thing is
You lie in bed hearing these voices
That no one ever hears

These meds will help you through

When I was younger, I sympathize with him
And tell him secrets of my loaded mind
And on the day he walked away; left me behind
I cried; my brother stayed locked in his room

Tell me is he a good man?
Is this all just a clever stunt?
Can you help me to understand?
The day we're waiting for will never come

This patient lives in isolation
It's just a figment of his mind
