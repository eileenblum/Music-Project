And yet here I sit in the hall
Drawing his face as he fell to Earth
So I'm boarded up

And tell me did the glass on his skin
Pierce in the same way his voice still rings in my ears
I keep that to myself
Someone might hear me

Keep your eyes open now
For there might be something to see

And yet here I sit in a world
Accepting this life but I'm wanting another
Everyone talks enough

And my back feels cold on this wall
Your breath keeps me warm as you breathe down the nape of my neck
And I've felt enough
Well take this from me

If you were really me
You'd be dead already

Nurse, tie him to the chair, let no one interfere
Now keep this hallway clear, I'm the doctor here
His pupils dilate like no one I have seen
His heart will regulate as soon as he can dream
This man's a mess I swear and prone to misbehave
There is no question here that this one I can save

This is my last breath
But I never could forgive myself
Waking up in bed so I can never speak a word
How could you do this to yourself?

Keep your eyes closed tight
There's nothing here to see

I feared them when I was young
Now they've become much stronger than me
Bound to hold these secret ghosts
Don't let them, don't let them see what I have done

Don't call me crazy I'm an ape inside a cage
They sit in excess as my mind disintegrates
These creatures on my arms are peeling back the skin
I'm trapped inside this hell, the pain inside me lives

I could, I could never see, I could never see
I could never see this failure that was left for me
There's nothing here to see

I feared them when I was young
Now they've become much stronger than me
Bound to hold these secret ghosts
Don't let them, don't let them see what I have done

Your voice is louder as I wake
Can I find you here as my body
And face, nothing stays the same
Can I lay my head down next to you

I feared them when I was young
Now they've become much stronger than me
Bound to hold these secret ghosts
Don't let them, don't let them see what I have done

I feared them when I was young
Now they've become much stronger than me
Bound to hold these secret ghosts
Don't let them, don't let them see I'm on my own
