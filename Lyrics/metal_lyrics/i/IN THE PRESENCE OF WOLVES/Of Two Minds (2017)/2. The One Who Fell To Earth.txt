Silly sleeping siren cuddled safe under your covers
These are my last words, don't even bother
To write, to call while you're wandering on the road
Writing your words for something unknown
To anyone, anywhere to pray that they hear you
These are my last steps so I'm sorry if I awake you
Stuck inside your mind, oh, I'm saying my goodbyes
Words will be my epitaph as my face shatters on the ground

Humor me with your humanity
Since you claim to be
Hundred percent human

Think of something tragic
Let it slow your pulse
Then ask yourself why
Your mind the father owns

And I feel the love
And I feel the love
And I feel the love
And I feel the love

Humor me with your humanity
Since you claim to be
Hundred percent human

Me and my sick mind
They with their sick thoughts
Ever intertwined
Never asking why
Keep your eyes wide
Never let them close
