Wait until the drugs kick in
Wait until the drugs kick in

But you're the only one here
I feel so scared
You're the only one here
And I can't wait for

But you're the only one here
I feel so scared
You're the only one here
And I can't wait for

Please rewind to where I find
My peace of mind falling down
I'm lost and confined and left behind in here

Strip these thoughts of normalcy from your mind

I feel bed bugs creeping in
My life begins again
The miss is just the first attempt
His face flashes before both my eyes

Something crawls on my skin
The voices leave my head
But this is just the first attempt
Take me back to when he was alive

This is how it aught to feel
But this is just the first attempt
Force the image out behind both my eyes

And who was really there
Tell me all their lies
'Cause I can save you

With all these things that I say
Make them exist in your head
But all these things that I do
I can do to you
How would you feel if I took out both your eyes?

Tell me the things that I say
I let this sickness spread
See all things that I do
I can do to you
How will you feel when his voice finally dies?

Tell me things that I can hear and only, only
You can hear and others feel but help them live their lives

And who was really there
Tell me all their lies
'Cause I can save you

Wait until the drugs kick in

But you're the only one here
I feel so scared
You're the only one here
And I can't wait for

But you're the only one here
I feel so scared
You're the only one here
And I can't wait for

Wait until the drugs kick in
Can you feel it? Go!
