Saturated in blood 
Standing still in fear 
Tears of those who mourn 
The breath of he who kills 
I feel it on my face 
My heart cries to speak 
My lungs gasp to breathe 
For he's got me by the throat 
His grip is on me 
Clutching me tight 
Shadowing black 
And holding me from God's light 
His grip is on me as dark as the night 
Spewing blasphemy and taking my sight 
He suffocates our life supply 
And manipulates the word by which we survive 
His voice deafens 
And silenced only in death
