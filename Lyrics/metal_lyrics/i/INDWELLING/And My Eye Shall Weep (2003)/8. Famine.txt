Found in human likeness 
And He reduced to the standards of the earth 
In famine He dealt with sufferings 
And in His deeds revealed His love and faith 
And all selflessness 
It's with His blood we bathe 
To focus on the name of the Lord Jesus 
The Son of God 
And in fullness God Himself 
He came to our filth 
And died to our sins 
Rising to consecrate glory 
He rose us with Him from the abyss 
Breaking our blackened deeds and intent 
Rising within Him and now we live
