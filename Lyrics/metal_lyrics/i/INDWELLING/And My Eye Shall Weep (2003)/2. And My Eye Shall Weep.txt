Resurrection of a new life 
Lavished in grace, with Christ he'll rise 
My heart is swollen, and my eye shall weep 
Laying my hands on him with tremblings 
I feel the presence of whom I fear 
Beyond the realms in which I dwell 
Sensing submission of a new heart 
My eyes flooded with tears 
Another child awakening 
(My eye shall weep)
