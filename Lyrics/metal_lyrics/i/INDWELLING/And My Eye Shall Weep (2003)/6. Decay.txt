Death of the spirit 
Enabling the flesh to swallow the mind 
They're submitting to their sins 
Bodies full of darkness and eyes that fail the light 
The decay of the spirit inside 
Life left living in deception 
A sickening life they're living 
It's inflicting their minds 
A sickening life they're living 
Because they're dead inside 
Like the beasts that perish 
Destined for the grave 
Death will feed on them 
In their tombs they will remain 
So lead Christ unto them 
And shed their calluses
