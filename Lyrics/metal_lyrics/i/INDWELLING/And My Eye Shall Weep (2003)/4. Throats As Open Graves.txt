No one is righteous 
They all fall so short 
Only through their faith will they not be condemned 
Their throats as open graves 
Tongues that practice deceit 
The poison of vipers is on their lips 
And the hearts of his children are turning to the dark 
They're mutilating his very word 
There is none righteous 
Not even one 
No fear of God before their eyes
