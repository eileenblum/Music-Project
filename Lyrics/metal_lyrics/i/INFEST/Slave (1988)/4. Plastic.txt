sure you can lie, except to yourself
make others think you're someone else
pretend you're someone by faking your feelings
to get accepted and have some meaning
friends swallow your bullshit like it's food
opening themselves to who they think is you
what's the reason for using a sheild
not letting out how you feel
afraid to let out what's inside
rather be someone who isn't alive
is ther eal reason why you fake
because yourself is your biggest hate?
just be yourself
not someone plastic
before it's too late
things get too drastic...
