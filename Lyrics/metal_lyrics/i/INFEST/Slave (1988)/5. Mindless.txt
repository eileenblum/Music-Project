living to use
use till you die
life just sucks
unless you're high
can't get high
escape with sleep
away from the pain
only drugs can treat
shaking you awake
covered with sweat
prescribing home
versions of an
inevitable death
mindless mutant
do you like
what you are?
substance abuser
professional retard
it makes me sick
such a waste
just get a gun
both have same fate
