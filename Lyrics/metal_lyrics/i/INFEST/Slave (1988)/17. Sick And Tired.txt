every show the same ol' thing
do you pay attention to what we sing?
brother against brother, such a shame
brainless gangs, it's getting lame!
bashing some heads
your way of fun
but when it's one on one
that's when the fun is done
all the slogans of unity
that's something I don't see
a scene that's something plagued with groups of hate
let's just coexist and try to relate
proving themselves men
bunch of fucken shit
i'm getting tired
i'm getting sick of it!
