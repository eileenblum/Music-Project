looking up above, light fills the skies
showers of warheads begin the winless fight
everyone responsible, being at fault
these heathen ways, caused life's halt
seems evil thoughts, finally overpowered
once good people, time has soured
forget human compassion, fend for thyself
playing fate's chards, dealt by yourself
seems everyone drew cards of death
as radiation blankets, smothers last breath
all is lost, taken for granted
realizing only then, how priceless a planet
pushing the button, releasing the bombs
resetting this world, too far gone
a new beginning progressing again
until reaching another sick society end...
