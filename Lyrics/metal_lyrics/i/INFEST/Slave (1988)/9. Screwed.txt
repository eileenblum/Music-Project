Life is hard, then you die
plus mass questions, asking why
but saying this and wishing that
wasting time, never coming back
got to be tough and watch out for pitfalls
not paying attention, costing it all
temptation along side, twisting the mind
finding a weakness, to bait his line
then there's friends, so you thought
seems he lied, so you got ripped off
next it's her, she's so sweet
always feeling good, ain't love neat
quickly see beauty turn into beast
catching your neighbor 10 inches deep
all that's left in your head
interested to see what tortures ahead
screwed...
