all you do is talk, you never act
hypocrite, and that's a fact
positive scene is a must
without friendship, there's no trust
visions of unity seem so nice
but when i see a fight, i think twice
when i go to the shows and see stupidity
all i can say is 'where's the unity?'
alcohol seperates us
use your head, keep in touch
positive scene in our land
lending your brother that helping hand
visions of unity seem so nice
but when i see a fight, i think twice
when i go to shows i see the stupidity
