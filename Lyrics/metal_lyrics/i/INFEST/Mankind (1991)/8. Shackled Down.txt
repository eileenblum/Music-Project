Shackled down
Under control
Life is acting
Playing the role
Don't speak out
Do as your told
Fucking clone
Fitting the mold

Stay in line
With the rest
Claim you're a "free bird"
But never left the nest
Sport individuality
Seems more like conformity
Say you're a black sheep
But you're still a sheep

I hope I never fucking sink that low
