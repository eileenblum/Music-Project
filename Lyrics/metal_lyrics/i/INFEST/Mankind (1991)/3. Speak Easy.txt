Preach through songs of standing hard
Step off record &amp; pose goes
Soft talk of picture perfect scene
Just remember that talk is talk
The trend is dead now
Let's lighten up put the hard back in this core
Probably the last music for me &amp; you
Cut the shit &amp; let's move on shut
Your mouth it's all fucking lies
Pain is not the answer
Feel it &amp; try
