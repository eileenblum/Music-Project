They seem to say
Lifeâs a bowl of cherries
Then what am I doing In the fucking pit
Sentenced to life
Living is death
Wasting away
Hopelessly dealt shit
Lifeâs a joke
Thatâs the punch line
Canât laugh
Holding a dead manâs hand
Backed up
Against the bricks
Every effort
A legless stand dying
Before ever finding out
f anyone got off
This dead end street
An inconvenience
Tossed out there
A long shot
Yet another sheep
