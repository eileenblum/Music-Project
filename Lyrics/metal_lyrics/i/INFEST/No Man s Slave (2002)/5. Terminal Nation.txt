Under siege we pray to God
Visible evil rabid dog

Rotting nation
Filthy nation
Stone cold nation
Ugly nation

Armageddon by design
Punishment ripping through

Hated nation
Backless nation
Broken nation
God damned nation

United we stand One carcass we fall Isolated
A quivering mass
Revoked lives
Possessed by greed
Bulldozed to Hell
Another culture deceased

Powerless nation
Darkened nation
Terminal nation
Flame filled nation
Dies
