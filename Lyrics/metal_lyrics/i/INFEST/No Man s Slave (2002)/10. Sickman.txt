At age 14 the party started
Youâve been fucked up for 20 years
No longer youthful experimentation
Stuck in a groove addiction
Youâre a sick man Itâs become second nature
A sober life is out of the question
You move from one vice to the next
Stopping to ease your emptiness
One day I hope you realize
