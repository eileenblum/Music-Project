I gotta make a change
Even if it kills me
No more shit
Shot in these veins
Too many years
Lived half alive
Fucked on drugs
Lost in space
Lying to myself
Canât stand the sight
Of my own face
I know I can do it
Cause Iâve done it before I know I can fail
Cause Iâve done it more I try to be positive
But only dwell on the negative
Iâd try to tell you different
But Iâd only be
Lying to myself
Canât stand the sight
Of my own face
