Oh where, time do you go?
When my pulse falls behind
The rhythm on top my wrist
Showing ten seconds to clear my mind
The gears pulling forward
Always falling into place
This battle I know is over
Despite the effort and haste

We can wait this out
Because I know that we will find our way back
We can wait this out
Because I know that it will be worth it in the end
It's too soon for us to say
Whether or not we can win this way
Patiently commit to all that is at stake
Because it's too soon for us to say

Oh where, inspiration will you be
Upon escaping this vacant automaton
To save me
The gears pulling forward
Always falling into place
This battle I know is over
Despite the effort and the haste

We can wait this out
Because I know that we will find our way back
We can wait this out
Because I know that it will be worth it in the end
It's too soon for us to say
Whether or not we can win this way
Patiently commit to all that is at stake
Because it's too soon for us to say
