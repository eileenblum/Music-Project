A distant vision
In the closest of moments to my being
Standing free of design, an entity of my own
And with eyes opening, it shatters within a breath
But already the thought lost my mind in question
Beyond reason

Say goodbye to the world as we knew it
To the eyes that couldn't see
Now we're dying trying to find out
What this life could mean
So say goodbye to the world as we knew it

The incidental fortunes that are our moments
To feel and see, create and dream
It is our duty to live while we can

Say goodbye to the world as we knew it
To the eyes that couldn't see
Now we're dying trying to find out
What this life could mean
So say goodbye to the world as we knew it
