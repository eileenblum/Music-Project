A bolstering surge rushes through our veins
Through the core shared between us
Strength as it's never been felt before
An awareness of unique purpose
No longer will our being be quantified
Summed in numerical numbness
We are unmapped shades of these lifeless codes

The space between the walls that surround us
Is only as confined as our hearts and our minds
In time we all will hear what resonates from within
The voice that we must find and embrace to guide us

Sparks in an artificial sky
Give color to dulling senses
System failure to feel digital wounds
Or suffering surveillance sources
We are the identity of these misfires
The present yet the untraceable
We are the order yet the free in thought

The space between the walls that surround us
Is only as confined as our hearts and our minds
In time we all will hear what resonates from within
The voice that we must find and embrace to guide us

The chance, the fate, what brought us to now
We can't help but to admire its beauty
To feel, to see, to create, to dream
It is our duty to live while we can
