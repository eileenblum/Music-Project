Nascent eyes braving their first light
The lungs first breath to come through
New life fights its way to the world
In an assembly line delivery room
Familiar features in focus
Of a docile development

Bringing to the surface
The carbon kinship at the very core

A greater purpose will be served
Within this life and the next
Beyond the short-sighted desires
Of a simple being's fulfillments
Through functional dependency
We endure conformity
A greater purpose will be served
Within this life and the next

Listen and do not speak a word
Contrary to those which you have heard
There is no need to find new truths
Opposed to those tailored for you
Solace awaits in the ventures put in place
Along the path before you

Bringing to the surface
The carbon kinship at the very core

A greater purpose will be served
Within this life and the next
Beyond the short-sighted desires
Of a simple being's fulfillments
Through functional dependency
We endure conformity
A greater purpose will be served
Within this life and the next
