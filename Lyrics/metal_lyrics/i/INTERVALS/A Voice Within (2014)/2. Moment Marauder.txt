Don't blink, I think there's tragedy chasing after me
Finding the perfect moment to take its life
I don't think that I'll have the strength to survive this one
But maybe the means to escape

It's breath is heavy on my shoulder
Hanging on like a cruel passenger
Who won't remove his hand from the wheel

And though I dare not face it
I cannot simply forget it's there

Don't blink, I think there's tragedy chasing after me
Finding the perfect moment to take its life
I don't think that I'll have the strength to survive this one
But maybe the means to escape

Taking in the signs left in wandering arrangements
Across memory and time, a scattered landscape
Underneath it all, I'm dying to find its meaning
Underneath it all, I'm dying to find where its leading

Don't blink, I think there's tragedy chasing after me
Finding the perfect moment to take its life
I don't think that I'll have the strength to survive this one
But maybe the means to escape
