Gracefully flowing in streams of harmony
Unified by one dance, one song, one pulse
Unified in the core that binds them
To take them forward

Free of self or identity
The nameless can live painlessly

There's no harm in knowing what the future will bring
To know that it is safe
So we set the stage for them to live and breathe
Strung to our fingertips

Free of self or identity
The nameless can live painlessly

Reflections remain unclear
What is seen in themselves, what is seen in the mirror
The self surrendered are after all
Minds reduced to marionettes
Forever performing on our stage
