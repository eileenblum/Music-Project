Even in a simple exchange I can tell
Whether or not you swallowed those propaganda pills
The steady overdose that we've stomached since our birth
That makes us content with our simple and obedient existence

Breathe this in and let this dose be of reality
To the world as you were truly meant to perceive it
Infinite shades of reason and truth
Of fulfillment and identity, of vices and virtues

Let the curtains close across the stage you've known
And the spotlight fade for the chance to see
What resonates within your very core
Will light the stage that you were meant to perform

Allow yourself this moment to move freely
The walls will crumble from around you
What echoes now will be from within
So believe in what it is that you hear

Breathe this in and let this dose be of reality
To the world as you were truly meant to perceive it
Infinite shades of reason and truth
Of fulfillment and identity, of vices and virtues

Let the curtains close across the stage you've known
And the spotlight fade for the chance to see
What resonates within your very core
Will light the stage that you were meant to perform
