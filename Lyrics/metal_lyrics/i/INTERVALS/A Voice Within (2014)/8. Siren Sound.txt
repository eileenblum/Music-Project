Mayday, mayday
A deviant on a tirade
Broadcasting hearsay
Sirens sound the evacuation call
To clear the streets and make your way back home
Target in custody, awaiting cleanse
Listener debriefings and loyalty assessments

The simple survive, whose battles are few
Loyal only to all that they've been told
The fate that you embrace is yours to behold
The simple survive, whose battles are few

(Sirens sound the evacuation call
To clear the streets and make way back home
Target in custody, awaiting cleanse
Listener debriefings and loyalty assessments)

Mayday, mayday
A deviant cries
Cynical slander
And faithless ideology
Fear not the visions of the blinded
Preaching only panic
To take from you your peace of mind
Target in custody, awaiting cleanse
Listener debriefings and loyalty assessments

(Open your mind at your own risk
You may not like what you find)

The simple survive, whose battles are few
Loyal only to all that they've been told
The fate that you embrace is yours to behold
The simple survive, those whose battles are few
