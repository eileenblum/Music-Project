A veil of darkness blankets thy awakening senses
Oh guardian of thy shadows slumber
Bare with thee thy shining sword
To cut the veil with an ancient word
Carry the flame of thy inner hearth
Unto the darkest recesses of thy soul
To cast illusion into the void
Shadows of past dance with a fire
Lit at the edge of darkness
Skyline marked for death
Landscape of forgotten war
Bodies fallen below black skies
It is there among scavenging dogs
Who thirst upon the warm pools of blood
A single child stands below
The circling birds
Her face pale lips flush and her dark eyes
Deep and penetrating
The beauty which betrays the images of mortal sorrow
For she knows there is no comfort
Among the living
Mesmerized by the blood stained sword
Of a fallen warrior
The blades intrigue holds her in trance
As the childs hand reaches forth
Slowly pulled across the blade
Silent beauty does not betray
The dull pain of unbroken trance
This blood poured upon the earth

Oh creatures of air
Sanctify this offering of innocence
The self sacrifice of virgin blood
An an obligation of death
Raven cries as her body falls
Raven cries deaths initiation
Oh child thou hast killed innocence eternally
I beckon thee child of darkness and earth
To come forth for in the night
I imboke thee and in the hours of twilight
I embrace thee as I walk with thee
Between two worlds
And as the sun riseth I lose thee
In the receding shadows of life...
