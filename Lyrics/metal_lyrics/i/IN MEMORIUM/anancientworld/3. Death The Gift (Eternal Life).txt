Death the gift eternal life
To pass through a door unlocked
By a key of immortality
A Quest for thee immortality
No boundaries of the flesh
No limits of the soul
To unharness the mind
And its darkest depths
Into the abyss of the eternal realm
Death is the only gift
Of no limits of the flesh
If the paths are chosen true
In the life of limits
