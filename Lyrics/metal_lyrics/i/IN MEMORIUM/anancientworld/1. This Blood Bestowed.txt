A blood is spilt from this blood a seed
This seed is your lifes blood from the ancient ones
This blood bestowed to instill a strength
To tain in vein you dishonor the ancient ones
All this blood you bleed from your heart and veins
All this blood shall fall to the Earth again
To stain a land from which it came
To take in vein you dishonor the ancient ones
From first blood that was spilt to present wound
From fields of blood to rivers of death
To forests of souls of ancient ones
This blood bestowed
