Reflections of past entwine
With visions of future
Flooding my soul I see
Only images of death
Growing darker longer
Like shadows with the setting sun...
An ancient word whispered without sound
To awaken the past from its sleep
To bestow a symbol of remembrance
Sent as the images of a raven
Carried on the winds of eternity
Who cries out voiceless messages
Woven into images of death...
Thy spiritual black hole
Inner sanctum - wisdom gained
Strength gathered - death embrace
Round by flesh and blood
To this an earthly shell
I return to walk amongst
The hordes of mankind
As an enemy of god
Driven by instinct
A wolf among the lambs of god
