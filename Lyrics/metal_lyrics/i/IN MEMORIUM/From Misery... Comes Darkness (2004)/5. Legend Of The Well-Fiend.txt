Abandoned... alone... to rot
Unknown... veiled in obscurity
Existance will learn... what it's like
Do you know... what it's like???

Spawned within a cave....
Discharged unto the sea!!!
To the river of offering.
Watch me till the end...
Or the dead shall consume you.

Splintered nails now etched in stone
An image of he who remains shrouded
From she who talks to the ocean...
If you play within the waters...
The monsters will devour you!!

Frolic in brine, goblins be thine...
A sorrowful soul... a creature of the shadows...
A curse that will replay in their minds...
Sadako has returned!!
Volcanos are erupting.

Nensha speaks the word unheard to most.
A curse that will replay within their minds!!
Sadako has returned!!!

Her dark water tomb... The black hair shrouded doom.

The Well-fiend awaits in the black slime
Vengeance... be... THINE!!!!!!!!!

Humanity will suffer... as have I...
