A time shall come
A time of change
At this time
Great reign shall fall
To cleanse
Of this decay
Thy rot
Thy mother
The flame
Of existence
Blown
Unto rest
By the winds
Of the infinite
All life scattered
Heads shall fall
From great heights
Their bodies rest
In this forest of stone
Darkness
Awaits
This cold soul
At the edge
Of two worlds,
Now Awaiting
This bodiless prey

Thy hourless season awaits
This season shall fade unto darkness this day

An attempt to catch the sands of time in an eroding hand
The sun shall rise this final face, infernal mask
Prayer shall turn to pain
Faith shall sour as their blood paints a scape of red
