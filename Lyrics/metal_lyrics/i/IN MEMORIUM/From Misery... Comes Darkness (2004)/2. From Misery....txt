SHE...Walks the midnight hours
...Haunts these ancient woods
...Bleeds the sacred blood
Moans the hymns of Kassothga
...Dress like autumn leaves
...Eyes as black as night
Stalking the lusts inside my slumber
Blinded by the cursed sun
Blinded by the spirits of light
Her curse now exiled to wander!!

She stands the sentinel of this forest
She is guardian of the shadows
She fans the flames of pagan FIRE!!!
