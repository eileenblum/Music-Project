Hell-vomited abomination through
Perversions begotten
Bitter winds whisper the advent of darkness
Black hordes descend upon the sheepfolds of man!

Reeking abysses... adorned with knives
The black mysteries of yawning stomachs
Foul feasts of offal

Ruined throats ejaculate gouts of blood
The night is engorged with the abattoir's stench

The carrion that was humanity
An endless banquet for the worm!!!

Heaped, stretching to the ruddy horizon
A temple of ruined flesh
Sweet herald of oblivion

Awaken, bringer of genocide
Unbound, the beast
Awaken, the beast
