I am before all Gods
I am before all days
I am before all men and legend of men
I am before all kings

No man may seek my resting place
No man may see the shadow out of time
No man may know the vanquisher of death

I am the power and the knowledge
I am the master of magicians
I am the ancient of days
I am the Abhorrence

I receive the sun at night and the moon by day
I send the prayers of the ensnarers, the liers-in-wait
Before me was made nothing that was made

Blind fiends of Chaos are servants on their knees
Most ancient evil dies when I still exist
Wolves carry my name in their midnight speeches
I am the Abyss and Abyss is me, I am the great mystery

Subtle voice is summoning you from afar
Beware, the word is done, you have no choice
Let me and the wanderers of the Wastes
Reign again, destroy the gate

I am before all Gods
I am before all men
I am before all days
I am the Abhorrence
