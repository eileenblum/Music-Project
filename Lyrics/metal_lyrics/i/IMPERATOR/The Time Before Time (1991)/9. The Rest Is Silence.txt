[Bonus Track]

The tide of advancing humanity has changed the world
False wisdom of conspicuous reality has driven me mad
Mythical beings of all sorts and kinds are flying
memory
Forms of which poetry and legend speak I can't forget

Whatever the horror was
Whenever the truth appeared
Death far from natural
I found there in my dreams
I hide the word of perversity
Collected by oddity
I neglet the power of human brain
Insanity I obey, unworthy and sane

In a dark space I felt aware
Of a singular accession of fright
As if someone emanation was engulfing my spirit
Oh! I perveived the source of my alarm

Thees places being exceeding dark
Twisting perception and blackness too great
I don't want to be anymore
I shall never supply a link
In so hideous a chain
of paradoxical seriousness
From these my thoughts escape
I conceived my present fear thunder
Of fire and lightning and unreal
Led by my thoughts to the morbid chamber
I found the truth the rest is silence

My memories are very confused
There is even much doubt as to where they begin
I feel the image of years stretching behind me
My identity, too is bewilderingly cloudy

I remember how I read the book
I was aware that I only dreamt
I prayed only for awakening
Instead I've found myself
So I walked further in my slumber
Now I fear for what I might find there
I'm alone, there's no god where I am
Is there fear in your heart?
Where I am you are not
Let my servants be few and secret
