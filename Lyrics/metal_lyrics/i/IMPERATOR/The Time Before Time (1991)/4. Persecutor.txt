Aggresion is what I am - my hatred
Cruelty is inside of me - my duty
Curse is the reason of your endless anguish
My justice is what let me to pass the sentence

Hypocrisy is what you are - my victim
Mayhem is waht you are - my creation
I am who you know - vexation
I am who you know - persecutor

Alone in empty room, living out of fear
Persevering to the end, left hand's magic raises
Closed my own eyes, body's gravestone cold
Hate flows from my heart, bloodlust

Sitting in the Pentagram, Christ's might is nothing
now
In my brain infernal names, damned mind catches spells
Rivers of my deathly pain reach, attain everyone
Loosing souls die in torment, I take revenge

All my wrath I celebrate holding sepulchral composure
Occult power attacks and conquers, crushed victims
agonize
Rotting fleshes cover Earth, hordes rise with arms
Infernal priests are ready to fight, the massacre will
soon begin

And it's my power exploding with my ruthlessly
thrashing doom

Aimless struggles of exorcists, might of spell takes
life
Masterpiece of destruction triumphs, the agony of pain
rends brain
Death is salvation for flesh and blood but final
torment awaits there
And demons surround the corpse, lurking with lust for
soul

And it's my power exploding with my ruthlessly
thrashing doom
