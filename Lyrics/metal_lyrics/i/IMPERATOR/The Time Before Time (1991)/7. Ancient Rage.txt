The Gods of the stars are seven
Their have their seven gates
They are approached by seven seals
And seven material essences

The Zonei

The seven deadly sins
The curse of seven oaths
The fear and seven names
The pride of seven Gods

For time is short and mankind doesn't know
Nor understand the evil that awaits
From every side, from every open gate,
From every broken barrier by mindless acolyte

I learned of the frightful beings who dwell
Beyond the astral spirits who keep the entrance
To the temple of the lost of the ancient of days
The ancient of the Ancient Ones, whose names I cannot
say now

I have heard the winds of doom
And I have felt the breath of unreal horror
I have retained in memory
Impossibilities in their reality
I have seen the glimmer of utmost truth
In that wilderness of madness
I came to understand many things
Of which before I had no knowledge
But after thousand moons of journey
My fate is no longer writ in the stars
And now I predict fear for your flesh
But fear for your spirit more

I've spoken with all manners of spirits
Whose shadows are deep in beyond
I've talked to some kinds of deamons
Whose names are no longer known
I've walked the unknown lands
That no map has ever charted
I've seen the stone monuments
Of vanquished civilizations

The habitation of men  are seen and surveyed
By that ancient race of Gods from a time before time
And I know they seek revenge for that forgotten fight
Somewhere in time and space, beyond the streams of
light
Oh, in the days before the creation of man
When the Elder Gods walked their celestial spheres
There was a time when the gate to the outside
Was open too long and the horror was one

The sight of the Ancient Ones
Is a blasphemy to the mind
Painful to senses of the man
And it's a part of the cosmic dance
For they come from another world
That is not straight but crooked
Be sure they will be back
I know they will come soon
