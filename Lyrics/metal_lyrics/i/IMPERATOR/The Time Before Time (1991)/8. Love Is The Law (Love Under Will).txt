[Bonus Track]

But what is right?
For nothing is wrong and nothing against
The virtues of liars, the vices of saints
No truths divine, no serious reply
And nothing for sure, perfection no more
No hint or advice, no pure sacrifice

Love is the law, love under will
there is no law beyond do what thou wilt

And you are a misshapen design
Whom I can easily dominate
You live in the world you cannot modify
You shouldn't love, you shouldn't hate

Love is the law, love under will
there is no law beyond do what thou wilt

I don't respect your obstinacy
In fact there's no obstacle you can resist
I hold in contempt your constancy
Your justice is obsolete
Can't I ignore your pretentiousness
Shall I tolerate your stupidity
Must I feel your self-deceit consciousness
When you are run by heard conformity

Lie to a liar for lies are his coin
Steal from a thief this easy you'll find
Trick a trickster and win the first time - But beware
of the man
who has no axe to grind

My reticence is my prepotency
And you give opinions when you are not asked
Your solipsism is ridiculous
I do unto others as they do unto me

While I represent my vital indulgence
You represent your abstinence
I give back what I got
And you turn the other cheek
Bother no one, but if someone bothers you
Ask him to stop
And if he doesn't do, destroy him
Any creature, human or otherwise
Is only as important as they make themselves
To other ones
The being that created all
Might be perfect
But when power asks why
Then power is weakness
