The voices of the rites of ancient Sumer
Are deeply summoning in immortal minds
The abyss of knowledge is open and close
It's path to perfection but not to be sought
For therein lies the truth Death,
The ocean of wisdom, the secret of all
Learning of uninteligible things
Took brains of pagans, atheists and priests
Researches into the forbidden and forgotten
Have always existed and do exist
"The Enchirion of Pope Leo The Third"
"The Arbatel of Magic" and "Lemegeton"
Suffumigations and "Sworn Book" of Honorius
The brothers of the left hand path
"The Seven Mysterious Orisons"
Composite rituals of ancient wrath

Mystical science, the regeneration of Enoch,
The fourth book of Agrippa the mag
"The Black Pullet", "The Druid of Menapienne",
"Black Screech Owl", "Heptameron"
Are signs of unknown, forbidden and bad
The keys to the Netherworld locked in past
Ilusions of mankind created the trend
Confusions of all minds elected by names
Day of birth - eternal might
End of life - eternal might
Unconscious fate - eternal might
Turn your mind towards the side

Being's sense - eternal might
Price of death - eternal might
Future and past - eternal might
Live or die in truth or lies

Mainstream consciousness and things ignored
Sinister revelations of Crowley's wisdom
As above so below - "The Emerald Table"
Most ancient of covenants
Necromantic evokations, "Theosophia Pneumatica"
The blackest grimoires, oracles and ghosts
The world of Dementia
Cursed Netherworld

Day of birth - eternal might
End of life - eternal might
Unconscious fate - eternal might
Turn your mind towards the side

Being's sense - eternal might
Price of death - eternal might
Future and past - eternal might
Live or die in truth or lies
