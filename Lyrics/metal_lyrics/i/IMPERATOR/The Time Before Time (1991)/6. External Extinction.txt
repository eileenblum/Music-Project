Lammashta - the sword that splits the flesh
Ishtar - concelebration of sin and wrath

I was awakened by the howl of a dog
I could not move or speak for the fear
That seized upon my spine
And wrapped cold fingers around my skull

Maskim Xul - the sight of whom causeth dismay
Rabishu - unholy mystery drove me insane

I have experienced the birth of untruth
Oh, pray for protection against the outside
I have deciphered the unholy texts
I have possessed the three seals of Masshu

I witnessed the horror that struck
Of which words cannot speak
And of which writing can only confuse
I found the fear of the deceased

And you are the slave of an external extinction

The zones of the Gods and the places of the Azonei
I reached through the gate of Ganzir, gate of lost
Death of a most uncommon nature I have seen
In the time of the war between the worlds

I was awakened by the howl of a dog
I could not move or speak for the fear
That seized upon my spine
And wrapped cold fingers around my skull
