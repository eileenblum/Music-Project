Ancient place, former time
Alien sphere, nameless fight

Ia Azag Zu
Ia Azag Ag
Ia Sothot Agga
Ia Sothot Shiru

Weird pain, dark lair
Silent grave, aimless name

You will know who you are
Down in your fears
Down in your dreams
You will get answer for
When does it begin
Where is the end
You will see Marduk's race
And worshippers of the Ancient Ones
You will find the outer space
The outer space will find ya

Ride through the defunct domain
Find abomination's name
Raise your eyes above the Dead
Cry, your lament can't be heard

It breeds more horror than you can conceive
And number of hordes uncounted is
Wanderers of the Wastelands dwell
Defunct dimension... hidden nowhere
