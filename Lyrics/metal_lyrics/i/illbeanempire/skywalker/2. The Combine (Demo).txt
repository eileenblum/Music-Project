Your bright face obscures your darker mask
Far, distant eyes look out through yours
Our future has been sold away with a currency that is constantly devaluing
Corporations dictating politics
This once great nation has fallen into the hands of the global elite
But they will not succeed, we are waking up
Could you but see the eyes inside your own
The minds inside your mind, you would see how much we share
Unity of purpose, shattering of common shackles, a single road we tread
What seems to you a sacrifice, to us; merely oscillations
We do not fear the interval of darkness
We have survived worse across the ages
We have lost all dear to us, so you can put me on the red list.
