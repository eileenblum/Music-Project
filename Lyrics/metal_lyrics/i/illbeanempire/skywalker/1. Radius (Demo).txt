A shadow of the colossus brings forth night at dawn
A new awakening shows truth, we are one
With understanding I need not possessions I perspire with gratification
Ancient monuments arise from underneath the earth surface
Our eyes are finally open, as we view our becoming and our ending
Celestial awakenings commence, we will wake without rest and speak without sound
Our world is an illusion of vast imagery
Painted upon us by beings once among us
Light that can be seen in the darkest of areas:
Flashes of intergalactic gateways
And unearthly artifacts trace our thoughts
They resemble structures of an early mankind
Where all men are few and they walk among the clouds
The truth is out there
Roaring engines overhead, pulsing lights surround my radius
Warmth projected on my skin, this is so familiar
Gravitating toward the stratosphere, greeted by sentient beings from beyond this earth
Viewing history from orbital perspectives, beyond the milky way, transcending time and space
Conversing with the gods of foreign constellations
This is a new world free from humanity
Open their eyes, Anunnaki
