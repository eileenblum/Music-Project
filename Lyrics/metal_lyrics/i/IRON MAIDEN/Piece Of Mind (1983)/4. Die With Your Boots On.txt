[Smith / Dickinson / Harris]

Another prophet of disaster
Who says the ship is lost,
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost.

Taunting us with visions,
Afflicting us with fear,
Predicting war for millions,
In the hope that one appears.

No point asking when it is,
No point asking who's to go,
No point asking what's the game,
No point asking who's to blame,

'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well, stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well, stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

13 the beast is rising,
The Frenchman did surmise,
Through earthquakes and starvation,
The warlord will arise,

Terror, death, destruction,
Pour from the eastern sands,
But the truth of all predictions
Is always in your hands.

No point asking when it is,
No point asking who's to go,
No point asking what's the game,
No point asking who's to blame,

'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well, stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

You're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well, stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

They die with their boots on,
Yes, they die.

The day, they die with their boots on
The day we die, we die, we die, we die, we die

No point asking when it is,
No point asking who's to go,
No point asking what's the game,
No point asking who's to blame,

'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, try, stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well, stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

Die!
