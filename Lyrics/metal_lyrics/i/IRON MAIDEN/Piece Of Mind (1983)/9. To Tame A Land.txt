[Harris]

He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow.

He rules the sand worms and the Fremen
In the land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow.

He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
In the land called "Planet Dune".

Bodywater is your life
And without it you would die
In the desert, the planet Dune.

Without a stillsuit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis.

It is a land that's rich in spice
The sandriders and the "mice"
That they call the "Muad Dib".

He is the Kwizatz Haderach.
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar.

He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars.

The time will come for him to lay claim his crown,
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down,
You'll see
He'll be
The best that there's been,
Messiah supreme
True leader of men,

And when the time for judgement's at hand,
Don't fret.
He's strong
He'll make a stand
'Gainst evil
The fire that spreads through the land,
He has the power to make it all end.

"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death. Neither sorrow, nor crying. Neither shall there be anymore brain; for the former things are passed away."
