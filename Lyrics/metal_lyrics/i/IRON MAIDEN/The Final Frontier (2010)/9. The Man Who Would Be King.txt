[Murray / Harris]

As he travels on the beast of Burden
Moving up along the mountain side
As he gazes looking down the valley
No regrets but his pride

As he journeys across mountain passes
And significant sweeps overhand
His reflection of the beauty around him
Feeling empty inside

He is running from his wildest thoughts
He is running from his everything
He is looking now to find something
Hoping he could be saved

He's searching for the answer now
Is something that he's managed to avoid up 'till now
Looking for the conviction that he craves
He needs to find the answer sooner or later

Pushed himself to the limits
He had to strife for all the harder things in life
But what the cost to give him now
His life and time are the only things that he has

Life is is not a rehearsal, only has this the one chance to get it right
Living really is only way to know
Maybe one day they ll forgive him what he's done
with all the pain of lying too early in the grave

Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace

Just to make his peace with God
All is forgivable but he's left a little late
Trying something that he's not
Is impossible to change such a lot

He's taken someone s life away
There s not a day that goes by he regrets what he's done
He should have found another way
From the good book says an eye for an eye

In reflecting on decisions that were made
On the judgements that will haunt him  till his grave
No-one has the right to take another life
But in his mind he had no choice so be it

Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace

Destiny, no good to hide away
Hear us now, we ll be his only way
understand , no good to run away
Hear us now, we ll be his saving grace

Far, far away
The man who would be king
Far, far away
The man who would be king
