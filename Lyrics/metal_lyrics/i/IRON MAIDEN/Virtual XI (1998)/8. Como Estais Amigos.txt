[Janick Gers and Blaze Bayley]

Como esta amigo
For the death of those we don't know
Shall we kneel and say a prayer
They will never know we care
Shall we keep the fires burning
Shall we keep the flames alight
Should we try to remember
What is wrong and what is right

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos no more tears

If we do forget them and
The sacrifice they made
Will the wickedness and sadness
Come to visit us again
Shall we dance a dance in sunlight
Shall we drink a wine of peace
Shall our tears be of joy
Shall we keep at bay the beast

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos no more tears

Inside the scream is silent
Inside it must remain
No victory and no vanquishment
Only horror, only pain

No more tears, no more tears
If we live for a hundred years
Amigos no more tears
