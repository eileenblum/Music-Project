[Dickinson / Smith]

I got the keys to view at number 22
Behind my green door there's nothing to see
Is that a feature, what kind of creature
Would hang around waiting for a guy like me

Stone-cold sober and sitting in silence
Laid back, looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love
I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love
I got the hooks screwed in

She's tied up, she can't come to the phone
You must have got your wires crossed 'cause she ain't home
Knock on wood, you know I like that sound
She never could keep her feet on the ground

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love
I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love
I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you

Right on the money, got it wrapped up tight
Got new ideas for the decor tonight
Make this house a preservation zone
Gonna set her in concrete, set her up on her own

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love
I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling
For that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin, strung up on love
I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
I've got those ...hooks in you
