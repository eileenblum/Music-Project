[Harris / Dickinson]

The convoy lights are dead ahead
The merchantmen lay in their bed,
The trump of diesels hammers down,
In the oily sea - the killing ground,

Knuckles white, eyes alight,
He slams the hatch on the deadly night,
A cunning fox in the chickens lair
A hound of hell and the devil don't care

Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer,
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare,
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below,
Running silent, running deep, sink into your final sleep

Chill the hearts of fighting men,
In open ocean wondering when
The lethal silver fish will fly
This boat will shiver, men will die

A cast of millions, a part of play
Killer? Victim? Or fool for a day
Obeying an order, men have to die
Us or them, a well-rehearsed lie

Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer,
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare,
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below,
Running silent, running deep, sink into your final sleep

The lifeboats shattered, the hull is torn,
The tar black smell of burning oil,
On the way down to Davy Jones,
Every man for himself, you're on your own

The wolf eyes watch the crosswire
"Stern tubes ready", "Aim and fire!"
They can pin some medal on your chest,
But in two more weeks, dead like the rest

Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer,
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare,
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below,
Running silent, running deep, sink into your final sleep
