[Murray / Dickinson]

When it all comes down the line,
And the lights they turn to greed
And you race off with your tires screaming
Rolling thunder,

And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got your fast bullet,
One way ticket out of here

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

In the cities in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and riots

The politicians gamble
And lie to save their skins
And the press get fed the scapegoats
Public enema number one

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell ya

Your children have more brains
Than your drug-infested remains
California dreaming
As the Earth dies screaming

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
