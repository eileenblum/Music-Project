[Dickinson/Murray]

Lights out
We live in a world of darkness
No doubt
Everything's up for sale

We sleep
All of the world is burning
We pray to god for a better deal

Nothing is sacred back then or now
Everything's wasted
Is that all there is?
Can I go now?

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

Fight wars, die in a blaze of glory
Come home, meat in a plastic sack
Fall down
Better pray to your god for mercy
So kneel and help the blade cut clean

Nothing is sacred back then or now
Everyone's wasted
Is that all there is?
Is that it now?

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

[Solo]

I live in the black
I have no guiding light
I'm whispering in your dreams

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide

Judas, my guide
Whispers in the night
Judas, my guide
