The skies of black are dripping red
Been taken to the end, the end of it all
A beaten face on a bloody ground
Laid to rest, deep underneath

Left unheard, forgotten and dead, just torn apart too be
Snapped out the love all ahead
Dreams of breathing free

What's inside, is all that's left, reward for a sacrifice
Gave everything I had and more
Despite it I am still denied

To fall straight down
All my hope is fading
Contemplate what follows
Emptiness and sorrow

Left unheard, forgotten and dead, just torn apart too be
Snapped out the love all ahead
Dreams of breathing free

What's inside, is all that's left, reward for a sacrifice
Gave everything I had and more? (No More!)

It's all tied to the end
Where the pieces make sense
It's all tied to the end
Where the pieces make sense

The sky is black, dripping red, been taken to the end
A beaten face on a bloody ground
Laid to rest.

What's inside, is all that's left, reward for a sacrifice
Gave everything I had and more? (No more)

It's all tied to the end
Where the pieces make sense
It's all tied to the end
Where the pieces make sense

This could be my elegy
And I'll feel no pain.
This could be my sanity,
But don't bury me in here.

It's all tied to the end
Where the pieces make sense
It's all tied to the end
Where the pieces make sense...
