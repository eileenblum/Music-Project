Beyond and down under, it eats me, it hits me hard and devours me alone.
My life is detected with these spots of consumption. Flawless, just as I am, slave to none, and serve no one in the world, hiding in the shadows, facing the hideous horror ever to be seen.

Somebody, somebody holds me, (kills me as the saviour)

It trembles it shivers, it shakes the life out of every single soul, prepare for a journey, get settled for the natures own force, that eliminates you, and crush you like a roach. Spawn of this evil, drowning in demise. A vengeance is at reach.

Somebody, somebody holds me, (somebody, kills me as the saviour)

Avoiding The Pain, the lies are the same, we are all the same.
Avoiding The Pain, the lies are the same, we are all the lame.

Systematization, is this, the beginning of something good, or is this, the last breath that I'll take, This, the crop of a harvest, which is from sorrow and grief. Prepare for erasing, purging the world again, time again to leave this place behind..

Avoiding The Pain, the lies are the same, we are all the same.
Avoiding The Pain, the lies are the same, we are all the lame.
