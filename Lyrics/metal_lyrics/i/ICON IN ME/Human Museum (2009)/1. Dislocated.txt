Thru years I've plundered, thru the days that kept me alive
I am the man who rambled, was this, the right trail to take.
Living in the state of, in the state of fear, there is no hesitation.
That, I need to be taken out.

No way, Don't stay [x2] (under it)

Is this the matter of consequence, is this a matter of falling into pieces.
Guilty of charged, as a human being can be.

Dislocated, never been so mistaken by this
Dislocated, never left that door open [x2]

Look into my eyes now, do you see the fear you want.
Grounded, left unbroken, bones and skin disintegrate.
No love will lead you, from my sacred sorrow place.
Captured for a reason.
To be a prey, of this mankind.

Eyes tell, in disguise, eyes tell, in demise, eyes tell, in grace we'll fall, two-faced, two-faced you.

Thru years I've plundered, thru the days that kept me alive
I am the man, who rambled, was this the right trail to take.
Living in the state of, in the state of fear, there is no hesitation, that I need to be taken out.

No way, Don't stay [x2] (under it)

Is this the matter of consequence, is this a matter of falling into pieces.
Guilty of charged, as a human being can be.

Dislocated, never been so mistaken by this
Dislocated, never left that door open [x2]
