This wasteland is taken, this is the territory where the dead walks.
Prepare yourself for the wonder of your life. The end is just in sight.

Like an ancient force, that eats you whole, and rips your soul into pieces, rotten your heart and pounds your bones to dust.

God won't save you now, Blood will lead you now, you are so hollow to the core, an empty shell.

Dissolve this place, my legion, turn the dead on, turn the dead on
Raze this ground, my legion, turn the dead on, turn the dead on
Blaze this earth, my legion. Turn the dead on. Turn the dead on.

No remorse will ever linger in my soul, no hesitation will ever question my acts.
Truly and with sheer justice I?ll hunt you down, and dismember this fierce that haunts my dreams, face it, now.

Dissolve this place, my legion, turn the dead on, turn the dead on
Raze this ground, my legion, turn the dead on, turn the dead on
Blaze this earth, my legion, turn the dead on, turn the dead on.

This wasteland is taken, this is the territory where the dead walks.
Prepare yourself for the wonder of your life. The end is just in sight.

Repent it all, scorn the guts, repent it all, scorn, the man.

Dissolve this place, my legion, turn the dead on.
Raze this ground, my legion, turn the dead on.
Blaze this earth, my legion, turn the dead on.
