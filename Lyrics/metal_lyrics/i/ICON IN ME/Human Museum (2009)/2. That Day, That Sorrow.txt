This grace, no grace will dwell inside my body.
This day, will catch me and rejoice my slumber feelings.
Evolve, my nerves explode in a glorification
Remains, all will remain so sweet inside.

Amuck - Flies will conquer my home.
Amuck, coz my ties will break.

That Day, That Sorrow
That Day, That sorrow,
That Day, That sorrow,
That Day, That sorrow,

I wander, these endless streets, it mockers me to silence.
Eliminates, deviates the sickest.

Devils nest will give me shelter. This is a bad intention.
The vile and guts will guide me home, guide me home, guide me?..

None, enter this call [x2]

Fifteen, just number for me.
So many I've been putting away.
This is my premonition to all, step away, leave me behind.

That Day, That Sorrow, that breathes in front of my construction
That Day, That Sorrow, that dies in front of me, myself.
That Day, That Sorrow, that lies inside my wicked home.
That Day, That Sorrow, that dies in front of me, myself.

Devils nest will give me shelter. This is a bad intention.
The vile and guts will guide me home, guide me home, guide me..

None, enter this call [x2]
