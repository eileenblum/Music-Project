Try to reverse it, try to undo this.
The friction melts this all together.
Forging this natural hate, undercover I'll hide, the ice will break.
The water will drown me, the liquid fill my lungs, just as I am to enter the light,
Something pulls me up, embraces me, am I dead ? or alive.

It fall, into my hands,
It changes, to resurrect.

My body is aching, my skin is reversed, fiction or is this here for the real.
Justify all my actions, beyond this redemption, the state to controlling my mind.
Enemy lingers, enemy strikes, flowers on grave as they should be.
Anticipation to comprehend, my life's at stake, don?t you see.

It fall, into my hands,
It changes, to resurrect.

Forced to die, end of file
Forced to sigh, end of file [x2]

Lost it all, lost myself, was this the way to go, was this the way to throw it all away.

It falls into my hands,
It evolves, to resurrect.
Ground shakes beneath my feet
It won't stop until I'm dead.

Forced to die, end of file
Forced to sigh, end of file [x2]
