Blood.

Grew, the tears, I wondered.
Thru the time my hands where tied.
This the beginning of the end to come.
It's just a matter of consumption.

Prescriptive no matter what, Inherit the living at last.
It's time to break the skill, force my way thru it all.

Blood Ritual [x3]

In my veil my legion gathers.
Vindicate all living things.
Abducted for the cause of man.
Strength, no strength will hold me, will hold me, will hold me.

Like a razor from the sky, like a saviour of unkind.

Blood Ritual, Prescriptive no matter what.
Blood Ritual, Inherit the living at last.
