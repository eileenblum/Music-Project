"I've got the answer, so save thy self
This is the last time that I'll suffer"

One step in front of the others
The clock wasting minutes away
Slowly counting - dishonor

Watch the callous blood raid
That determines my sanity
Now that everything is gone

Removing me from myself
I take my place on the throne
I am the serpent's head and I must be severed

I am not, I am
I am not, I am the worthless
I am one, I am
I am one, I am king

You all think that I deserve this
The walls speak of my hell
Standing still - now haunted

My heart welcomes demise
Such a sweet and warm embrace
Filled with lies and hate

Removing me from myself
I take my place on the throne
I am the serpent's head and I must be severed

I am not, I am
I am not, I am the worthless
I am one, I am
I am one, I am king

Now which way is home?
(Our) blindfolds are on
Now which way is home?
(Our) blindfolds are on
