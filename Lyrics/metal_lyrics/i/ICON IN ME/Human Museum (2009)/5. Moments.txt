Pretend and dissolve
all what you did.
Framing my whole in this game,
Face the deepest fears.

I clenched my fists,
I tucked my loved ones,
I surrender to none, strike,
cause one is the beginning.
I'll find you stalking,
I have you on my back,
bleeding for the nameless,
isolation ahead.

Eyes sees, Lies breeds, Eyes sees, within your dispelled soul

This is the moment of my life.
This is the second time I'll be the one to blame.
Revealed and discovered the truth,
it hurts me right to the marrow of my bones.

Try to blend the strengths, try set things straight, every second is a light year.

Me is the enemy right here,
vast is beyond your control.

Eyes sees, Lies breeds, Eyes sees within your dispelled soul

This is the moment of my life.
This is the second time I'll be the one to take the blame.
Revealed and discovered the truth, it hurts me right to the marrow of my bones.
