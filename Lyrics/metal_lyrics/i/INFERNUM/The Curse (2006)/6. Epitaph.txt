Last act of extrication has been done
Horseman of the lightning traveling towards the highest mountain peaks

You shed the heaviest of the shroud in the most beautiful night

Now your attire is clear
You are like bird which found its wings
Raised by Gods to the God's world
Night warrior holding the truth flame
In the unity with the Universe you see their gleam

Planetary dust cold as a stone
Gleam which is carried by numberless stars
Gleam as a symphony of sounds
Filling our black hearts

Though juices of your life have coagulated
And Death has put you to sleep
Though black sun has burnt the illusion

You have not died
One-eyed Father will accept you
To the rooms which the alive dream about
Horseman of the lightning
Death will not win

Death will not win with You
