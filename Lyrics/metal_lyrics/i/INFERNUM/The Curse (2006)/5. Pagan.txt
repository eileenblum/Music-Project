Altars in the flames
I'm running through the woods
I'm running away from the evil
Hanged fellows around me
I se the crows eating their eyes

I se the venom which was poising the earth
I felt on my face for the first time
Like the angel who disagreed with their god
In the beginning of their world

I turn around
I se them they are close
They want my death
I rise up to run on
But I fell down again

Slaved servants of church capture mi
Merciful shepherds of Christ
My stake is burning
They ask me do I believe in their god
Never!

Now I'm waiting for my death
My redemption
With me dies the old true
Hated alchemy of death
