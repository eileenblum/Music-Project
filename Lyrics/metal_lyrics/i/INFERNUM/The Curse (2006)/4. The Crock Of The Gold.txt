He have heard once about The Crock of Gold
And he decided to get it
He knew that his aim appears once a year
In the most beautiful night of old creed

He sacrificed whole life for it
He forgot about relatives, world
He was dying but he tried each year
In the most beautiful night of old creed

He never gave up but he lost
He collapsed into oblivion
But we know that he is alive
And he is still searching

In the most beautiful night
In the most beautiful night
In the most beautiful night
In the most beautiful night
