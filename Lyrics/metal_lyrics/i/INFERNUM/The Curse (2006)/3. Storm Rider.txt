Carriage embossed in ice
Carried by white death's horses
Proudly goes through
My clear tears
Which are her road
In the journey to the stars

When longing dies
Echo of mind disappears
Last star's journey

Cold empty soul
So I have no soul
Everything reaches its end

When the last star goes out
When the Earth will die
Divine sparkles of the unbreakable
Space of the nocturnal sky
Will light up the Universe

Kisses sacrificed
In the emptiness of the expanse
Last journey on the lightning
To put the Earth to death

Cold empty soul
So I have no soul
Everything reaches its end
