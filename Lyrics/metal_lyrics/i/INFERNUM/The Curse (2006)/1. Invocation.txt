Lie down in my mind thunderous King
Pure reality...
Satan! who create youself
Divine man filled by the light of will
Impassive, pedatory
Resting in every time of existence

...Take flesh from My flesh
Drink blood from My veins...

You! Who the winter of wisdom awakes from emptiness
You! For whose God doesn't exist
You! Spiritual revange of the truth
You! Shining lightning of the nighty sky shattreing Jesus Christ's flesh

You! Innocent child of the Thelema Eon
Open my eyes by sparks of the starlights
Let me leave by immaterial way
I wouldn't die beyond the livings

Devil of the pure feelings
Devil of the pure wrath
Kill in the might of suffering
Preaching death of the God
Preaching death of the God

Crowning Satan arise!
