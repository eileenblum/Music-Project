This is my soul, fallen angel pushed into the night.
A star in the darkness ocean of enlightenment in the world without god
Silent ocean of truth - human, god, beast master baphomet...
His taste fills my mouth
I'm filling in with heat of his ego
Do as you will that's the law
Let ground be cursed thrice
Let jude, who is saging on the cross,
Be pushed away and loathed
Let untouched Maria be thorn on the wheel
Let poisoned gases be filling temples of compassion
Let mercy be rejected

This is the truth, not a lie
Revealing innocence is a lie

My god is cold emptyness of the night sky
In wich I'm raying thin light
And I'll last till last star falls from heaven
I am the king of pain, I'm the madness
Lonely, inside the spell of ethernal sadness
....like the sun of the middle-night is always a son

I'm Your altar
Your desire
On the stone table I'm waiting
For the last act of Your....
....Profanity

Secret Light
This is my soul, fallen angel pushed into the night.
A star in the darkness herald of enlightenment in the world without god
Silent ocean of truth - human, god, beast master baphomet...
His taste fills my mouth
I'm filling in with heat of his ego
Do as you will that's the law
Let ground be cursed thrice
Let jude, who is saging on the cross,
Be pushed away and loathed
Let untouched Maria be thorn on the wheel
And all the virgins be scorned by you
