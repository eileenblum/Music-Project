The roots of darkness span the welkin,
Reflecting scorn upon this world.
As hail and horde claim all beneath it
Trample all within your might.
Stain the sky to mark thy kingdom.
Part the darkness with your sword.
Storm and kill
Claim all that please you...
The heavens belong to the Iron One.
Hisarna! Iron One!
Mark my name upon thy stones...
Let the wretched, beg for mercy
I will show thee none, my foe.
Iron One! Hisarna!
Ride I forth to claim thy throne..
How the angels wept defeat!
Now the master faith be known..
