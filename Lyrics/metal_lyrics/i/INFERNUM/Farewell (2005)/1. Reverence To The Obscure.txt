I drink in,
The meads... of the Night-hymn,
Drunken,
Of the dews... ere Dawn.
My chalice,
The token... of the hunter.
My palace,
The realm... of the stars.
Oh, reverence,
To the wisdom... of the Moon!
Crossing,
The jeweled crown... of heaven.
I follow,
Thy paths... too soon,
Un' the lead,
Of the forest whisper.
I wander,
The worlds-forgotten.
I sunder,
The wild bloom.
I plunder,
The golden harvest
With the Wolves,
To share my wealth.
Reverence,
In celestial Blood!
Brethren,
To the charioteer.
The paths of the fire-wheel,
Burn blue,
Upon... the call of my arrival...
