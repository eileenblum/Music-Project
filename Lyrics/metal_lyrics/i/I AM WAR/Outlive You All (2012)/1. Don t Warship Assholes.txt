Paralyzed, disgusted, fed up, with insincerity
Amount to something more
Than your petty wants and needs
Behead, the betrayal
Hack the head of mediocrity
Challenge yourself
Live, grow, and breathe
Emboldened, emblazoned, inspired by insincerity
Amount to something more
Than your petty wants and needs
Can't take it, can't take it
What I'm forced to hear
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe my ears
Realizing, embracing, enforced with peace and clarity
Challenge yourself
Be truer than you can be
Redefining, a new mindset, better way of living
Amount to something more
Than your petty wants and needs
Can take it, can take it
My mind is clear
I believe it, I believe it
I believe my ears
