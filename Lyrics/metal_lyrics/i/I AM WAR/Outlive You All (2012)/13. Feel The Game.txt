Life can feel so isolating, like you're on this walk alone.
I felt this way before. I felt this way before.

Like the world was black and dead.
And my heart was ice and stone.

I felt this way before. I felt this way before.
When you reach the edge, no turning back.
Every word is like, a vicious attack.

You cannot compromise.
Close your eyes for a moment.
It passes and the glory is gone.

I felt this way before. I felt this way before.
A fleeting moments happiness, displaced outraged feelings.
I felt this way before. I felt this way before.

You cannot compromise, you cannot compromise.
You cannot lose control.
You cannot be compromised, you cannot lose control.
