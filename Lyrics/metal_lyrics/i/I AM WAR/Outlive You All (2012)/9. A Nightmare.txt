Let me tell you, the worst story I can imagine.
Let me sell you, the worst dream I've ever had.

Walk with me thru a nightmare, a twisted journey.
Walk with me thru a nightmare, fade away.

Help me. Show me. Teach me how to live and breathe.
Show me how to sacrifice, and swear to be by my side.

Help me. Show me. You mean more then everything.
My reason to sacrifice, just swear to be by my side.

I'm never saying good bye, I'm your solider for life.
I'm never saying good bye, Without you nothing feels right.

For now, forever and always, you are painted white in my dreams.
You are the savior that pulls me back, you are my light when
all goes black.
You are the morning dawn on the darkest night, and you are all I
need to be right.
