So what have I learned? After all this time just more questions,
like who am I?

After all these years, can I connect the lines.
Make some sense of this picture.
We all fake it sometimes, we all fake it sometimes.

I don't have many answers, don't know the meaning of life.
Just trying to make my way, just trying to see some sky.

I don't know it all, but I would die to try.
I don't know it all, I just want a beautiful life.
I don't want a beautiful lie.

Run away. With your ideas, of what I need. To say.
In your world, I can't assimilate.
It doesn't matter, in the smallest way to me.
What you think I should be.

Lost and found. This life never ever lets me down.
No time to weep as it, sweeps me off my feet.
Never safe, never weak. Steadfast.
