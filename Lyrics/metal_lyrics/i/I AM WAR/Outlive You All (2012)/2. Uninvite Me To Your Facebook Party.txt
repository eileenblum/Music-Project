Don't invite me
To your sad pity party
Can't fit the mold
Of who you need me to be
Always wear my heart on my sleeve
Sometimes its hard to take it back
Save your judgement don't worry about me
My heart is pure can't turn it black
Always wear my heart on my sleeve
Sometimes its hard to take it back
Save your judgement
I can't hear your words I won't fake it
Your insincerity I can't take it
I'm not trying to be your friend
I'm not trying to fit in
I'm checking out
Of this pathetic game
I know who I am
I know who I need to be
Always wear my heart on my sleeve
Sometimes its hard to take it back
Save your judgement don't worry about me
My heart is pure can't turn it black
Always wear my heart on my sleeve
Sometimes its hard to take it back
Save your judgement
