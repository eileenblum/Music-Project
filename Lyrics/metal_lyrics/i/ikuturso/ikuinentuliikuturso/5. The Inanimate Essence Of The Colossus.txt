[performed by Iku-Turso]Darkness can only enlighten you
When you ban all sources of light from entering your life
An entity driven into obscurity
The inanimate essence of the Colossus
Nestled in the soul
Perception from the aerie of an eagle
An entity driven into obscurity
A view from above to visualize your innerself
Your innerself
Cold hearted demons eating away all goodness
Untill pure darkness remains
A void filled with bleackness
Cold hearted demons eating away all goodness
Untill pure darkness remains
A void filled with blackness, with blackness
A void filled with blackness
An entity driven into obscurity
The inanimate essence of the Colossus
Nestled in the soul
Perception from the aerie of an eagle
An entity driven into obscurity
