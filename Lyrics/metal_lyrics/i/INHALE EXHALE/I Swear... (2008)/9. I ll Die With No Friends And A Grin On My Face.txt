I curse the day when being open was abandoned.
Now my brothers see the weakness in my action
And the way I walk screams defeat.
My existence hurts those I love.
This motion seems to drag me down.
Without them there is defeat.
And when you find me I will listen to your words.
And they go with nothing more than a smile.
I would like to think that this burning will soon die.
Alone with hate for myself so save yourself.
With a grin on my face.
I am sorry.
Take me back.
Oh what forgiveness is?
I say bury your secret.
