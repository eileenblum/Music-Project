Who said this won't be perfect after all we know what's right?
And the sounds of bodies clashing (is) enough to make them cry.
You know this can't be perfect even when it's feeling right.
And the sound of bodies crashing echo through the night.

Dreams are gone
Nightmares are here to stay.

Not doing when you know is the greatest crime.
Wake up spilling hatred for each other everywhere.
How cheap is your love.
Lying to keep a peace.
And oh how we've ended up in this place.
In this place we're trapped by greed.

[Chorus:]
Who said this won't be perfect after all we know what's right
And the sounds of bodies clashing (is) enough to make them cry.
You know this can't be perfect even when it is feeling right.
And the sound of bodies crashing echo through the night.

Silence.

Something is not right in this house.
This room I lay my head is haunted by mistakes.
Crimes of passion?
Or was it the way they were raised?

[Chorus]

Darkness fills this as does the empty bottles.
I wait for the day you come home.
When this house is no longer standing
