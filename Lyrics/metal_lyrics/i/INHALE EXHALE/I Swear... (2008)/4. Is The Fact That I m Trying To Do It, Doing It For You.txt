Chained to your mistakes and pleas and a life without consequence.
Beg for nothing less than comfort.
Is what I am saying sinking in?
Honestly emotion separates from desperation and i cannot deny it.
Honestly emotion separates from desperation and i cannot deny it.
Beat down in your despair.
Among the wise you feel alone.
No one could see this any differently.
Hold on and think this deal out.
Give me everything I want.
And Iâll be angel for a little while.
When I am satisfied with what I have I will go back to raising hell.
Run and hide.
Honestly emotion separates from desperation and i cannot deny it.
Honestly emotion separates from desperation and i cannot deny it.
Beat down in your despair.
Among the wise you feel alone.
Beat down in your despair.
Among the wise you feel alone.
No one could see this any differently.
Hold on and think this deal out.
Run
Run and hide.
