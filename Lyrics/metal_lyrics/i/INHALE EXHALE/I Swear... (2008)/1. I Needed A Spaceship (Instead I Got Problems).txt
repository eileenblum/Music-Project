The chase is about to come to an end.
How does it feel
To be awake at this time
And not say a thing
Whenever you'd like.

There's no telling what we'll do for ourselves.
Forget about the rest.
This isn't what I had in mind.
I can't forget the feeling.
Things are not always what they seem.
This place confuses me.

I'm hard of hearing.
Your actions say enough to everyone.
Your simple ways have come to an end.
Right on.
You messed with their freedom
And he hates the cowards in charge.

There's no telling what we'll do for ourselves.
Forget about the rest.
This isn't what I had in mind.
I can't forget the feeling.
Things are not always what they seem.
This place confuses me.

Still hard of hearing.
Your actions say enough to everyone.
I need space.

Love me.
And fear me.
Do as I say
And I will be your slave.

Love me.
And fear me.
Do as I say
And I will be your slave.
