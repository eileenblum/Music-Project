Find me somebody who sees the world as they should.
Give yourself a chance instead of giving up.
Depart from your words.
Depart from your lies.
Lies lies lies and all you have.
I was born to die.
I took what you said to heart and knew that you meant it.
I took what you said to heart.
Believe me I do.
Spare me just this once.
From hearing you flap your lip.
Are you a man?
Someone they call a saint?
Oh God!
A child with this mouth.
Where will it end?
Depart from your words.
Depart from your lies.
Lies lies lies are all you have.
