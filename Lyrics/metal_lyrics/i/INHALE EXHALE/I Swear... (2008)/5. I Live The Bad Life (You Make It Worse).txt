Let's stick together and show them you are not an idiot anymore.
We will face this now right now and not flinch one bit.
Clenched fist eyes rolled back it sends a shiver down his spine.
You hate things so badly.
And it is worse for the ones who are lost.
You give me a bad name for who I try to be and what I try to do.
Protect your heart from hatred.
It is who I try to be and what i try to do.
I am not always right in my actions or my words.
But I will try and be a man this time.
Pay attention to being real.
And the lies you were taught will flee.
You hate things so badly.
And it is worse for the ones who are lost.
You give me a bad name for who I try to be and what I try to do.
Protect your heart from hatred.
It is who I try to be and what i try to do.
You believed me.
You believed me.
I hate you.
You hate things so badly.
And it is worse for the ones who are lost.
You give me a bad name for who I try to be and what I try to do.
Protect your heart from hatred.
It is who I try to be and what i try to do.
Breakdown.
