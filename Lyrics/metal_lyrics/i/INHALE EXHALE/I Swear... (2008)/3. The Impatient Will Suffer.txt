Let's move on.
Hastily!
Approach if you dare.
When will you break away from your own rule?
Push and shove the hardest that you can.
I am not the nightmare that chooses you.

Bring your worst to the table.

I found your memories on the floor.
As blank as they are your choices.
I saw a man on top of the world.
Crushed by the fear of his maker.
And it's coming down to what means the most to you.
It feels so right when everything is in your hands.

I will restore your hearts desire
and when the sun goes down
you'll live to see that nothing's changed

Bring your worst to the table.

To walk around and not pick you up would be a shame at the least I know.
And find a gun at the end of your heartache.
We'll fight to hold back the tears.

And it's coming down to what means the most to you
And it feels so right when everything's in your hands
I will restore your heart's desire
And when the sun goes down
You'll live to see that nothing's changed

Oh my.
Just sit and stare.
This time you leave the talking to someone else.
You must be searching for someone else.
You must be searching for something else.
I will restore your heart's desires.
And when the sun goes down
You'll live to see another day.
