Man consumed by pleasure.
A body ravaged by poison.
The love for the dream is gone.
His mother laid to rest with his life.
Loud voices in the distance.
A life too short to call it full.
This won't be enough for me and I am hurting all together now.
This won't be enough for me and I am hurting all together now.
His voice still heard so loudly.
And in my heart he will stay.
Loud voices in the distance.
A life too short to call it full.
This won't be enough for me and I am hurting all together now.
This won't be enough for me and I am hurting all together now.
But God did this hurt the ones he loved the most?
God did this hurt the ones he loved the most?
This won't be enough for me and I am hurting all together now.
