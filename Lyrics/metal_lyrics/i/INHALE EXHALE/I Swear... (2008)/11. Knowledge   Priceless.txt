Starting at chapter one,
Youâre so predictable.
The story starts in the middle, the middle of the song.
And when the job wakes with the years and sounds of laughter,
The heart is overwhelmed and simply breaks.

Heâs never wanting to lay down and die.
It leaves a horrible taste inside, inside.
With all thatâs left to come away with, weâll see this to the end.
With all thatâs left to come away with, weâll see this to the end.

Now hope is in a state and everyone agrees.
With humble hearts they fall, they fall to their knees.
And I remember why I came here in the first place,
The absence of this love that killed me.

Heâs never wanting to lay down and die.
It leaves a horrible taste inside, inside.
With all thatâs left to come away with, weâll see this to the end.
With all thatâs left to come away with, weâll see this to the end.

With all thatâs left to come away with, weâll see this to the end.
With all thatâs left to come away with, weâll see this to the end.

This wonât be the end, this wonât be the end of it all.
This wonât be the end
