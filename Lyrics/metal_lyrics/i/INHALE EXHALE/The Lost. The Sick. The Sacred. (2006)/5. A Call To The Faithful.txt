The lights go dim. And eyes begin to close Oh no.
A simple conversation sparks the love inside of him. .

[Chorus:]
You live two lives and never think about your actions.
Who is the one you try to please.
Yourself. With no regard for anyone. Who is the
one you try to please.

You taste the leather of that shoe. It comes with the words you say.
The week seems long and you cant wait till your sunday morning masquerade.
Let down your guard and everything just seems to fall to shame. With a nervous
look you search but your only one to blame.

[Chorus]
You live two lives and never think about your actions. Who is the
one you try to please. Yourself. With no regard for anyone. Who is the
one you try to please.

feel glass against your face. Hopless for this moment. [2x]
You cry out for help. He has been watching all along [2x]

This is ending right now

This is a call to the faithful
An outstretched arm to the faithless
