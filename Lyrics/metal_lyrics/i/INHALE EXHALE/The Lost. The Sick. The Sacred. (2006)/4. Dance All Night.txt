The best is solid.
Opportunity is in the air.
The lights move with rage and so do I.
Let's dance like it's 1989.
Not so fast but not too slow.
Searching for a reason to turn back,
your mind went blank.

Let's dance around the things we dare not speak of.
Let's dance around the things we live to avoid.
Silence anything that poses problems.
Denial is breaking us apart.

I turn the corner.
Surrounded by stained glass.
The love and heart is gone for sure.
This church is made only of stone.
Oh God, protect me from elders that have gone astray.
Front being pushed to the street.
Never to return again.

Let's dance around the things we dare not speak of.
Let's dance around the things we live to avoid.
Silence anything that poses problems.
Denial is breaking us apart.

You'd better dance like no one else watchin' you.
Oh yeah.
Don't let them tell you who you need to be.

Let's dance around the things we dare not speak of.
Let's dance around the things we live to avoid.
Silence anything that poses problems.
Denial is breaking us apart.

We could, we could, dance all night
