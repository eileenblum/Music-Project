Now we're making progress,
life goes on for one more day.
Now we're building futures,
hopeless lives won't be the same.
And would you give up everything for this cause?
Acting out of love instead of greed.

Moving on from everything we left,
and leaving the loving and hurting behind.

Allowing ourselves to be bound in faithfullness.
Turning pages, there's hope inside this book.
And you would give up everything for this cause.
Acting out of love instead of greed.

Moving on from everything we left,
and leaving the loving and hurting behind
