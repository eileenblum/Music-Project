I wandered in on my own that day.
Now I'm exhausted from that miracle, Oh Yeah.
Excitement chills my veins.
Go through this all for who?
I'd do it all again.
And not think twice about going back to where I thought was home.
Don't find me on the other side again, don't find me on the other side.
There's still hope in one.

[Chorus]
Life as we once knew it is dead
Pick up the pieces, saying goodbye
Has never been so hard

Faces plastered with joyful gleam.
A look that speaks for itself I'm sure.
Say what you will but I'm OK. I will require
this explanation to kill my spirit and sting my pride.
So full of things to say my lips are sealed, what gives.
There's still hope in one.

[Chorus]
Life as we once knew it is dead
Pick up the pieces, saying goodbye
Has never been so hard
