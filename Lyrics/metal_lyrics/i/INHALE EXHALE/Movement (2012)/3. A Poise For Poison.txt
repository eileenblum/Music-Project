She works the crowd just like it's her job turning their heads and dropping their jaws. Forgive me my love I can not stay away from everything oh you're toxic and rotten to the core. Back to progress things need improvement. Where should we go from here? You fake day by
day a meaningless existence for what? She works the crowd just like it's her job turning their heads and dropping their jaws. Forgive me love I cannot stay away from everything oh you're toxic and rotten to the core. Stumble. Your eyes have been plucked out by cupid;
winged freak. You can not be contained by the whores of our generation. Feel free to break those ties and walk away. Take back the reigns and gain control again. She works the cord just like it's her job turning their heads and dropping their jaws. Forgive me love I
cannot stay away from everything oh you're toxic and rotten to the core. Every man should have his freedom!
