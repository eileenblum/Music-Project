Show what you know to the world. We had never seen it coming. Now everyone is full of panic and greed. If you would have stopped and listened for a moment. You would not be here in this place. this seeks a volume about this race. We are fading faster than you know. Green
eyes are coming to take me away from the comfort of this planet. I'm down an arm and a leg. Things aren't going great. Feel the taking of your life. Feel the taking of your planet. You are not on solid ground anymore. Everyone was burned alive. Slashing and bashing
destroyed our night. Our night!
