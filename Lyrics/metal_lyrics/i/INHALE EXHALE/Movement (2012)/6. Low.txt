I cannot see
The meaning in all of this.
Stop me if I am
Being rude.

Let this pleasure grip your tongue
And I will fall apart
While everyone just stares at me.

Face now the value of your heart
Face now the value of your heart

Awakening
Is in the eyes of the beholder.

This is
A story of a man at his worst.
(A man at his worst)
In a constant
Race with time.
(The race with time)

Dead leave are falling to the ground.
So what?
I can not hear a single word you are saying.
This is a turning point
For a sad soul that carries your burdens.

Hold me
So I will
Not fall
[x4]

This is
A story of a man at his worst
(...his worst)
In a constant
Race with time.
(... a race with time)
I can't see why you keep on mowing on
Without what you wanted.
So lay your heart down.
God will you take me.

Face now the value of your heart.
Face now the value of your heart.
So lay your heart down.
God will you take me.
