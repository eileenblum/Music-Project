My imagination is running wild away from me
I canât talk when you speak
I canât speak when you talk
Letâs give these words a whole new meaning
Â 
Close your month and just understand
That the meanings are twisted
I see a wiser man on top
Show me who you are
Â 
We are not the same as we choose to be
Were just a changing breed
For the better we will stand and seek the truth
Its goanna be alright letâs just take our time
Â 
My anticipation has got me all tied up in knots
No one see no one cares
No one read your thought
So speak loud and speak clear or we will drive you nuts
Â 
We are not the same as we choose to be
Were just a changing breed
For the better we will stand and seek the truth
Its goanna be alright letâs just take our time
Â 
Youâre turning the pages of your life
And burning them when you are through
