All our hopes have since expired until the day that we met face to face. Oh stop the feeling of falling faster oh gravity. Just be a friend to me. All heart is lost but not forgotten. This is where we both go our own ways. find the feeling and finish saying your
goodbyes. See you later. Much! See you later. Now you look back on those times and wonder if we could have changed. Our lives are going down in flames. All our pain is so contagious. This marks the spot of this tragedy. You run around with the wrong crowd. Still it hurts
more returning home to it all. This is what we were afraid of from the first day. Now you look back on those times and wonder we could have changed. Our lives are going down in flames. This is how you want it to be. Oh the smoke that rules your life. This is where we
stand. This is where it ends. Now you look back on those times and wonder if we could have changed. Our lives are going down in flames.
