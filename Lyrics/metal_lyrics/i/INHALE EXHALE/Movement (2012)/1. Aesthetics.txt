This is where our bodies fail
And our hearts, and our minds take over
Blind as a bat and you're too short to reach
Counting perfection and judging them each
When it's all on the outside
And you can't see in

The lies of glamour are not as great as the heart
Keep searching but make sure you dig deep

I caught a glimpse in the mirror
But I didn't know that looks aren't all you have
It's what you've got on the inside that counts

This is the end of a timeless tradition
Now you see me, now you don't
My heart has been neglected

You don't even know what I have been through
Take me far from this place, oh

One day it will get better
But I'm not quite sure how long we will wait, how long we will wait

This is the end of a timeless tradition
Let's take a closer look at ourselves

I caught a glimpse in the mirror
But I didn't know that looks aren't all you have
It's what you've got on the inside that counts

This is where our bodies fail
And our hearts, and our minds take over

Force feed your ego for one more day
Force feed your ego for one more day

One day it will get better
But I'm not quite sure how long we will wait, how long we will wait
