The Table separates us from the beating of a lifetime. Can you not hear the tone in my voice. With your hands behind your back locked down, alone for days. There's nothing you can do to save yourself. I saw a break in the clouds that lead me to you. There's words for
every moment. Let light be your guide. Hold your head up high. Let this moment escape. This was the longest summer. The heat was driving me out of my mind. The state line separates me from my own self. I've seen the changes and they're giving me hell. Now is the time for
change. I saw a break in the clouds that lead me to this moment that lead me to you. There's words for every moment. Let this moment escape. We've been up all night around town we were living it up. You're just living in the moment. You're just living for yourself. I saw
a break in the clouds that lead me to this moment. There's words for every moment. Let light be your guide. Hold your head up high. Let this moment escape.
