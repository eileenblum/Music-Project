I was only one awake for all of it. I was the last man standing. I'm standing tall. Afraid of everything that crosses your path. One man is set to kill. He carries an axe. Someone is coming to get you they're coming! Even the stars won'r come out tonight. There's so much
blood and there's so much fright. There's no use being afraid of demons that haunt you and terrify your mind. Night turns into morning another hour that you're alive. you hear the footsteps coming and now it's time to fight. Raise your hands to the sky turn around let's
do this right. Raise your hands to the sky turn around it's time to fight. 'Cause it's just something that you had to do and it's just something that you have to do. There's no use being afraid of demons that haunt you and terrify your mind. our lives are in your hands.
Our lives are in your hands. Our lives are in your hands. The tensions rising. He's coming soon. So prepare yourself to meet with doom. Choke him out.
