Oh sweet innocence I bid you farewell again.
In this moment I have fallen to pieces
But waht can I do.
This is always the hardest part.
You're seeing shadows on the bathroom floor.
It's not like you've never been here before.
Welcame back kid.
Welcome back kid.

So lets move!

I ask myself.
Will
This
Ever
Go away
Even
With
Time

This is moment that you will awake.
Let your heart decide the vison of your fate.
Of your fate.

Open up your eyes and see that
There's love inspite of hate.
Even know this can't be easy
Keep your head up high.
Keep your head up high.

Let's go!

Will
This
Ever
Go away
Even
With
Time

This is moment that you will awake.
Let your heart decide the vison of your fate.
Of your fate.

Open up your eyes and see that
There's love inspite of hate.
Even know this can't be easy
Keep your head up high.
Keep your head up high.

Open up eyes to it all
And everything you know will just keep changing.

Make th emost of what you have
Until you loose it all.
This is real
Savor the moment for jut this once.
Go on and
Get it, it, it ,it ...

Open up your eyes and see that
There's love inspite of hate.
Even know this can't be easy
Keep your head up high.
Keep your head up.

Even if you have fallen down
You must know that there's always a way.
There's always a way back up
To where you came from.
To
Where you came from.
Where you came from.
