Change your heart. We've got such a little time to change the past but why would we want to. He gives us hurt to teach us love. So many things we can not see. Without the help of others who can see what we can't see. And let us walk hand in hand. Let us walk. This is the
day that you've been waiting for, for so long. and every time it comes around I get lost in the moment for whatever reason. I've got a plan to make you open up your eyes. Instead I walk away. Shut your door. You can'r be certain of what's on the other side. And let us
walk hand in hand. let us walk. This is the day that you've been waiting for, for so long. And every time it comes around I get lost in the moment for whatever reason. Just tear it up. Just tear it up. Tear it up! Tear it up. Tear it up! Tear it up! This is the day that
you've been waiting for, for so long. And every time it comes around I get lost in the moment for whatever reason.
