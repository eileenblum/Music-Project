I swear I've done this before.
Oh so familiar is the mess that I'm in.
I once knew.
Now memories escape and people meet their fate.
This says the man walking out on his wife: "And now the whole world knows".
This says the kid with the rope around his neck: "And now they all will know".
And can't you see that there's still hope, and don't you drown in what the world has told you...
Now I know that I've been here before.
It's the feel of defeat when it finally sinks in.
I feel so desperate.
The barrier is so thick.
Can I get through to you?
"Will I learn from this second chance", says the man who was dropping his pants.
"Do I really deserve to live", says that kid who was slitting his wrists.
And can't you see that there's still hope, and don't you drown in what the world has told you...
I once saw.
But now I am exhausted from this mess, from this mess.
