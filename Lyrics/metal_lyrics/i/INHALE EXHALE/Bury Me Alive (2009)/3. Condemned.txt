How easy it is to state a point.
Words become knives and guns become eyes.
Shoot them down and slit their throats.
Live their life and then you'll know.
Shoot them down and slit their throats.
Live their life and then you'll know.
You were wrong all this time.
I believed in you.
It doesn't make it right.
I'm holding on to you, to you tonight...
You've slaughtered the friendships you love.
Friends become foes and soon you'll be alone.
Hide your knife and stash the gun.
Pride yourself in what you've done.
Hide your knife and stash the gun.
Pride yourself in what you've done.
You were wrong all this time.
I believed in you.
It doesn't make it right.
I'm holding on to you, to you tonight.
And after all we've done and after all we've seen.
I swear that this is killing me.
And after all we've done and after all we've seen.
I swear that this is killing me...
You were wrong all this time.
I believed in you.
It doesn't make it right.
I'm holding on to you...
