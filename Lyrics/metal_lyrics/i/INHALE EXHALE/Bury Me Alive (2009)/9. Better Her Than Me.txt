Take all of your plans and deliver them.
You are the one who's golden, you were chosen my friend.
And it's not like the spotlight is always found within.
Open the door and expand your mind.
Open the door...
But you're always looking over your shoulder.
Afraid of things that you might find the reason you took off and left it all behind.
I was anything but sure.
Love never took its grip on me.
After this night and many fights.
Crushed cans lead to closed eyes.
Open the door and expand your mind.
Open the door...
But you're always looking over your shoulder.
Afraid of things that you might find the reason you took off and left it all behind.
But you're always looking over your shoulder.
Afraid of things that you might find the reason you took off and left it all behind...
Where did it go?
Where has it gone?
Where did it go?
Where has it gone?
Where did it go?
Where has it gone?
Where has it gone?
