You... can't... turn... back the time.
Though you wish you could.
Would you try harder?
Would you run faster?
Make peace with a friend?
All mistakes aside.
Can we go back in time?
If only we could.
Can we go back in time?
If only we could.
We could change this.
Will we change this?
But what is the point?
It's made us who we are.
Some things we might not like.
Forget about the past, just live your life.
Can we go back in time?
If only we could.
Can we go back in time?
If only we could.
Brace yourself for the moment of the impact.
Brace yourself for the moment of the impact...
I'm out of this world.
I cannot take this any longer from you.
And also out of body floating higher than the heavens above.
I'm out of this world.
I cannot take this any longer from you.
And also out of body floating higher than the heavens above.
Out of this world.
