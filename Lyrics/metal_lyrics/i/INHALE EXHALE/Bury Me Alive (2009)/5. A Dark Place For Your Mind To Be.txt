Responsibility has found its way into your hands.
Placed at your feet.

You're faced with a challenge and given the lead.
Your mind overtakes, you don't know who to be.
Witness the change.
Witness the change.
Perception is reality.
And this is a dark place for your mind to be.
And this is a dark world for you now to live.
Just take it in and let it out.
Aren't you supposed to be with me right now?
Just take it in and let it out.
Aren't you supposed to be with me right now?

The smell of your new suit so sweet and so fresh?
How confident you are when you're looking your best.
The way it carries an ego and pleases the mind, destroying the honest people, leaving them blind.

You're faced with a challenge and given the lead.
Your mind overtakes, you don't know who to be.
Is hope still there?
Is hope still there?
Is it true what you said, that you still care?
And this is a dark place for your mind to be.
And this is a dark world for you now to live.
Just take it in and let it out.
Aren't you supposed to be with me right now?
Just take it in and let it out.
Aren't you supposed to be with me right now?

Turn these situations into something great.
A lesson in discretion, flee from vanity.
Wake up and see yourself for who you really are.
Let's go...
I still see the...
I still see the good inside.
I still see the good inside.
I still see...
