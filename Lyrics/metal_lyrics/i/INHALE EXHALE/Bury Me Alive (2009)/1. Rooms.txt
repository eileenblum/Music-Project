Everyone in the room carries on their conversations.
How all of the words seem to blend together.
It creates one noise.
Filled with judgment.
It creates one noise.

The sound of so many filled with their doubts.
They're speaking their minds and then they're finding things out.
What has this man been up to?
Is he living right and showing a smile?
It's so loud tonight.

This room is seductive.
It bears the mark of technology.
When intended for family and those who really care.
It's been made a joke of.
They're blinded by the glare.
It's been made a joke of.

The sound of so many filled with their doubts.
They're speaking their minds and then they're finding things out.
What has this man been up to?
Is he living right and showing a smile?
It's so loud tonight. Yeah...

Tear down what is hurtful and believe to make things right. [x3]
