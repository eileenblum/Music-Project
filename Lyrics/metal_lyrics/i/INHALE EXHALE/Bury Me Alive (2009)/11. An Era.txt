It never stops.
It's always there and keeps you in the circle.
No matter what, these times will always be remembered.
It's all coming to an end, this era's over.
Live for your dreams and say goodbye to this era.
And remember what it was that held you down.
Never be afraid.
Strive to accomplish the goals that you have.
Leave this time alone and make sure you never look back.
It's all coming to an end, this era's over.
Live for your dreams and say goodbye to this era.
And remember what it was that held you down...
Never again will this overtake my mind.
It's all coming to an end, this era's over.
It's all coming to an end, this era's over.
Live for your dreams and say goodbye to this era.
And remember what it was that held you down.
Live for your dreams and say goodbye.
And remember what it was that held you down...
