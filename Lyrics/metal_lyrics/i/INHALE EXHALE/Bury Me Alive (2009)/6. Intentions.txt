Away from here is where I want to be.
Not far enough for me.
Not far enough for me.
And for a moment it's all reality.
It's all reality, not this stupid dream.
Away... and I can't say that good intentions were inside, inside of you.
And I'll hold my breath and I'm trying to forget all of the lies.
It's never been about understanding me, but will the truth, will it set you free?
Will you die a lonely man, will you push to succeed?
Or will you fall like the others have, abandoned and in need?
And I can't say that good intentions were inside, inside of you.
And I'll hold my breath and I'm trying to forget all of the lies.
Yeah...
Yeah...
Away... and I can't say that good intentions were inside, inside of you.
And I'll hold my breath and I'm trying to forget all of the lies.
