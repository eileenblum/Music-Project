Await the explosion.
It follows the moment you count on yourself.
Ka boom, it blows up in your face.
Ka boom, it blows up in your face.
Explosions all around, they never leave you.
Oh man the time has come.
Where will this lead to?
To hell and back.
To hell and back.
Watch the sunset, see it glow, close your eyes and then explode.
Watch the sunset, see it glow, close your eyes and then explode.
I am mesmerized by the way you see me and by the way you found me.
Ka boom, it blows up in your face.
Ka boom, it blows up in your face.
Explosions all around, they never leave you.
Oh man the time has come.
Where will this lead to?
To hell and back.
To hell and back...
Darkness falls and so do we.
Disarm the bomb, be quick to flee.
Darkness falls and so do we.
Disarm the bomb, be quick to flee out...
I have forgotten what it feels like, what it feels like...
I... have forgotten...
