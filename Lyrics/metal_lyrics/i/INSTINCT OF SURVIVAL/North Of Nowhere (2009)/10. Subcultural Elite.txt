Iâm sick of the conformity of the non conformists
Arrogance and ignorance
For those who donât reach own standards
Itâs my life and my decisions
Individuals have their own positions
Leave me be with all that scene crap
Donât want of be part of a sub cultural elite
A strict system of rules and restrictions replaces by another
Rebellion becomes self-deception and turns into a farce
Itâs my life and my decisions
Individuals have their own positions
Leave me be with all that scene crap
Donât want of be part of a sub cultural elite
