Captured in apathy, lamed by frustration
Dreams of despair in a state of alienation
Damnation of idealism, unbelief in destiny
Mental stagnation reduced to misery

North of nowhere
South of somewhen
Dawn of the day a struggle of dying emotions
Life is a simple word for defeat and disappointment
Lost the will to hope, lost the will to love
Damned to eternal sadness

Lost the faith of redemption of utopia
Resignation paired with rising of mania
Abyss of hopelessness, life's retaliation
On the edge of extermination
