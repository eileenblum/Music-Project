Encaged by dark shadows
Of past, present and future
Manâs evolution continues
The path of destruction

Social, economical, ecological genocide

Building of human culture founded
On a hill of blood, sweat and tear
Limited time of existence
A dance on our own graves

Greed, waste, hate, exploitation

No savior from on high delivers
No faith we have in prince or peer
Our own right hand the chains must shiver
Chains of hatred, greed and fear
Ever the thieves will out with their booty
And give to all a happier lot
Each at the forge must do their duty
And we'll strike while the iron is hot

Encaged by dark shadows
Of past, present and future
Manâs evolution continues
The path of destruction

Social, economical, ecological genocide
