Last night I had a bad dream all was grey
Woke up next morning life was exactly that way
To be shitten to existence wasn't my decision
I have to suffer from realities nightmare vision

Daily life
The key to mental decay

Being part of the game wasn't my choice
Human beings are just economical and political toys
Both can try to reject but your nothing than a slave
From the day of birth into your grave
