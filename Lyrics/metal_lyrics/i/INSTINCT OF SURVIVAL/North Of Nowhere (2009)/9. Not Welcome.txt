Through the mist of total confusion a light of clarity seems to blink
Pumping ache pulse of fire
Emotionally frozen destroyer of moments
State of depression remaining ruins
Nothing more is left
Remaining ruins
Nothing more is left

Endless falling through grey clouds
Everythingâs lost what once was
Face the fear your personal abyss
Overruned by confusion, no idea what to do

Aching separation hurts deep within
United we stand, divided we fall
Destination blurred can't see through it
It is hard to realize that everyone dies alone

Endless falling through grey clouds
Everythingâs lost what once was
Face the fear your personal abyss
Overruned by confusion, no idea what to do
