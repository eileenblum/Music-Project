It seems that no one feels the way we feel
No one knows how much we hate this shit
Too late to change the past, too late to create a future

Old, lonely, embittered
Pain, scarred, littered
Old, lonely, embittered

We condemn those who are one with this world
Because they are, and we are not
We stand by the wall in our pathetic sausageness

Old, lonely, embittered
Pain, scarred, littered
Old, lonely, embittered

And we drink, we drink all the time
Cause we are losers and thatâs a fact
And we drink as though nothing could fall
And the shame was on the other side

Old lonely embittered
[Repeat]
