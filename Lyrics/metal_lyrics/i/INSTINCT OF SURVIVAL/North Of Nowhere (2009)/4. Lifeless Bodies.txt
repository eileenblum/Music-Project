Your mind is frozen by the things your eyes are seeing
Seeing what the dead's work is about
Steel through flesh, tear everything apart
Claws of death are grabbing your soul

Lifeless bodies, everywhere on the ground
Rivers of blood, streaming across the fields
Cries for help, upon deaf ears
Sewn shut eyes, where response should act

Brainwashed marionettes, marching on to die
Those who pull the strings, watch them die

Cries for help, upon deaf ears
Sewn shut eyes, where response should act

Brainwashed marionettes, marching on to die
Those who pull the strings, watch them die

Cries for help, upon deaf ears
Sewn shut eyes, where response should act
