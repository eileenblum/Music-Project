The day you left a part of me died
The night is lonely and cold
You brought the sun in my life and took it away
Anguished by darkness and suffocating sadness

Pain dominates
My paralyzed senses

[?]

Annihilation of wishes, hopes and dreams
By remembrance of your tenderness
A torn human heart in the gutter
Tortured by memories of days of fortune

Plastered misery
Captivated in desperation

[?]
So much I'd wished to say
So much I'd liked to share
But nothing than loneliness remains
Bereavement, darkness and pain

[Verse missing lyrics]
