Winter wind blows a cold breeze over the land
My minds gets frozen again
Poison flows into me and I donât know
If Iâm happy or in misery

When black demons hold my brain
I enter to darkest reality
Aggressions are growing
And itâs easy to hate

Tour on and sail in an ocean of blood
Sailing with the mind of hate
Whispering voices all around me
Starting countless battles against myself

When black demons hold my brain
I enter to darkest reality
Aggressions are growing
And itâs easy to hate

Tour on and sail in an ocean of blood
Sailing with the mind of hate
Whispering voices all around me
Starting countless battles against myself

Canât find the broken pieces of yesterday life
Itâs all so cold around me
My mind is a deep dry desert, andâ¦
I sacrifice in a deep sea of shadows

When black demons hold my brain
I enter to darkest reality
Aggressions are growing
And itâs easy to hate
