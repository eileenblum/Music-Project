Religious beliefs of each kind disgusting historical relics
Created by man, to control man
Instrumentalisation of human fears and human hopes
Justification of social and mental stagnation

Disgrace to the corpse of Christ
Disgrace to the cross of Christ

Your god is dead and never existed
Your confession of faith a building of lies
Your temple, now your tomb
Thrown on the trashcan of history

[Solo]

I donât care how your god is called
Exotic changes nothing, idol is idol
Indoctrination, brainwash, bigotry
[â¦] 

Disgrace to the corpse of Christ
Disgrace to the cross of Christ
