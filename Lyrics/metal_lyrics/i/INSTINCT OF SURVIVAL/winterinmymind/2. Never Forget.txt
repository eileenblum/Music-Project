See the red clouded skies
Blood rains from above
Itâs hard to breatheâ¦ the dusk of cyclone b

Never forget
The guilt is ours
Never forget

Sewn and crusted eyes
Didnât save in front of hate
Million of crying souls
Disappeared in oblivion

Neverâ¦ Never forget
The guiltâ¦ The guilt is ours
Neverâ¦ Never forget
The guiltâ¦ The guilt is ours

Corpses piled up to the sky
Nobody, nobody ever asked why
The guilt is up on you
Just sit back and close your eyes

Never forget
The guilt is ours
Never forgetâ¦ the guilt
