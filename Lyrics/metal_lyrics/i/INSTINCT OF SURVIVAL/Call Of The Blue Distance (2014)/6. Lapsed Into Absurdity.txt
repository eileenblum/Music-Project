In the soil of your Complacency germinates the Seed of our bitterness
Captive in dreams and unfulfilled expectations Slapped in the face by Everyday life
Deafened By intellectual phrases
Antagonized to daily Struggles
Confined to your Ideological house of cards
Bounded by your sanctimonious Morality

Turning rebellion into Conformity mutilations of Ideas to a stupid dogma
Rules and restrictions doÂ´s and donâts
To serve as security in your illusory world

Logical ways
And methods of thinking yield
To superior force of phantasm
Youâre initiating a development
Into terminal ridiculousness

Lapsed into absurdity
Lost the ability
Lapsed into Absurdity
Utopian reality

Lapsed into absurdity
Lost the ability
Lapsed into Absurdity
Utopian reality
