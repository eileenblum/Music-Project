Iâm fed up with this
So donât bother me
Donât want to hear your crap
Your bullshit cant

There is no common cause envy and deceitfulness is all I see
There is no us there is only me
There is no common cause envy and deceitfulness is all I see
There is no us there is only me

What will you do the day you realize
That all your faith and dedication really means nothing
I know what to do I Have realized that my faith
And dedication really gave me nothing

I am no fucking saint
But Human and defective
I donât hate all of you
But the Bigger part
Of the majority

I sacrificed my dedication
To what felt pure and Right
Sentimental feelings
Eradicated by bigotry and
NaÃ¯ve witlessness

What will you do the day you realize
That all your faith and dedication really means nothing
I know what to do I Have realized that my faith
And dedication really gave me nothing
