The sun is shining and I am freezing
Faced with the mess I left behind

Drowning in sorrows
[4x]

I've learned by the best
To bring in pointless Accusations
As i felt Security in my stronghold of Fear and anger

Drowning in sorrows
[4x]

And I am drowning my Sorrows
It seems I am drowning my sorrows
I try drowning my Sorrows
But the sorrows are drowning me
Drownâ¦ in sorrowâ¦
[Repeat]
