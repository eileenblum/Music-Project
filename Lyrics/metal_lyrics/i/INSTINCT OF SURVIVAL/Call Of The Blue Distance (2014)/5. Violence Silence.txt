Pushed to the wall untouched
Dirty fingers drilling my head
wretching hands On my throat
Emotionless Feet rushing my chest
Creeping hate reined back
By abasement and forlornness
Futile crawling aggression Discharged
In a hidden clenched fist

Drown my left laureateship
Whipe me with participence
Dress my open wounds
With Your spittled kindliness
Prove your own superiority
By any means of loudest
Witlessness
Bask yourself in Complacency
Ugly grotesque Face of glass

Extinguish the fire of Self respect
By the wish for Silence
Extinguish all hopes for the sake, of ending aural

Violence
Silence
Violence
Silence
