On this winding path
Of No tomorrow
Million of Footsteps
Pointing into Nowhere
White raven red eyes
The Keeper of faith keeps falling from the skies

All light Turn into darkness
The sun Is turning green
No sign of Redemption will ever be seen
All light Turn into darkness
The sun is turning green
No sign of Redemption will ever be seen

Black eyes
Black minds
Black eyes
Black minds

Digging deeper
Into the sea
Of oblivion

Of oblivion
[Repeat]

We all will be forgotten
[Repeat]

In this maze called Afterlife
Someday

Someday
[Repeat]
