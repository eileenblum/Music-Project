[End time]

Burning fires never banish the deadness
Fecund soil wonât breed life and grain

Endzeit
Endzeit

Chained to a place with no light and Warmth
Emptiness is glaring in hopeless eyes and voices

Endzeit
Endzeit

Death is certain
The sheep waiting for their slaughter
Celebrating the apocalyptic dawn in Overcrowded wastelands
The Undead seem alive in empty Bodies without soul
Climbing the stairs to their own Oblivion
Iâm on my own
As I Taste the breath of death
I never felt alone like this
And it feels like dying
