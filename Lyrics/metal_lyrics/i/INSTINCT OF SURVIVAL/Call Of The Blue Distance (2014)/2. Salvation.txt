Iâm sick of being told this All happens with a reason
Canât hear the fairytales of Fate anymore
Life is nothing but an inexorable sick joke
Searching for sense
Wasted Time
The agony is sweetened
By Self-fabricated illusions
Multiplied sorrow
By Disploding dreams
Caged to This valley of tears and Disappointment
Dominating Weakness
Iâm tired trying being strong

There is no light by the end of the tunnel
No savior to save our souls
The Imagination of my rotting flesh in the soil
Does not scare me at all

The fall comes quick and apace
But reliable sudden
The collusion is excruciating
And unendurable hard
The perception of crossing the zenith
Of bitter Disappointments
Is popular Fallacy and desperate self-Deception

There is no light by the end of the tunnel
No savior to save our souls
The Imagination of my rotting flesh in the soil
Does not scare me at all

Birth breads the spark of Death
Visions of life
Visions of luck
Is it really
Worth fighting
The future
Is empty and lost
And only Death is certain

There is no light by the end of the tunnel
No savior to save our souls
The Imagination of my rotting flesh in the soil
Does not scare me at all
