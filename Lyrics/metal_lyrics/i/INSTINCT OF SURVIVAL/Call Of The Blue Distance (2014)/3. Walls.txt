Your morals aren't mine and in a strange way I speak nothing but the truth
You want me on my knees
But thatâs the position you already took by the life you chose
You like the sound of your Voice
And putting something you heard into action
You remind me of a chameleon
Harmed egos bite

Judge me watch me find your conclusion
I couldn't care less
Judge me watch me so what
I couldn't care less

Life is against me
The World is against me
You are against me
But sanity is with me
A Cold war in my Heart
Iron curtain in my Mind
Barbed wired tongues
Speak words of wisdom

Walls, walls, walls I see walls
Walls, walls, walls, I build Walls

Judge me watch me find your conclusion
I couldn't care less
Judge me watch me so what
I couldn't care less
