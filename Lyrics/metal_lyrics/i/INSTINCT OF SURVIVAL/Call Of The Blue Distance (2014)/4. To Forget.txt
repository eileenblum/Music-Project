Here I am again
Dwelling in My own darkness
Stumbling Over my own shadows
All Light in my life seemed to be Gone

In darkness I remain
[4x]

My fellow friend is getting
Stronger
I feel well in his Company
All aching light got swallowed
Numb but strong
I Will remain

In darkness I remain
[4x]

And I see it now
It is time to create new memories
And I see it now
It is time to forget the Past

In darkness I remain
[4x]

And I see it now
It is time to create new memories
And I see it now
It is time to forget the Past
Time to forget
