In endless time and endless space
Sometimes the stars align
In endless dark and endless nights
A glint begins to shine
My restless soul dies of thirst and bleeds out
On my lonesome trip through the
Milky way
Ten thousand light years I've been
Watching out
To find your heart in space

This is all about Venus and Mars
Just having a blast, meant to be
But it didn't last
This is all about loving and scars
Just trying to trust
Meant to be and now it's stardust
A pitch black hole inside of my heart
Fallen in love and fallen apart
A glimpse in time, colliding stars
So this is all about Venus and Mars
