99942
I will punish the world for its evil,
99942
I will halt the arrogance of the proud

From the beginning of all times
I hide and wait for you
For all your sins and all your
Crimes
This is what I'm meant to do
I'll bring this killing to an end
So at least surrender
There's evolution to amend
Bow down before your king

I have held my peace a long time
I've been still and restrained myself
Now I will cry
I will lay waste to mountains and hills

Blood and fire and pillars of smoke
In the heavens and the earth

99942
The sun shalt turned into darkness
99942
And the moon into blood
99942
Behold, he cometh with douds
99942
And every eye shall see him

99942
I am alpha and the omega
99942
The beginning and the end

I'm bringing mankind to an end
And you can't surrender
There's evolution to amend
Bow down before your king
