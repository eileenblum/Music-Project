I see your eyes
Glance becomes shy
Remember the times
Life goes by
I see your smile
I'm breathing hope
Hold on for a while
We walk the same road

I see the stars
They're like your eyes
Some are bright... why?
We walk this road
Life's suddenly shy
To speak is a burden...
Goodbye...

I climbed into heaven
And reached for the stars
Down below I leave all my scars
I climbed above I tried to heal
A life forsakes
You disappear

You loved the snow
You loved the rain
The glance now fades
Will we meet again?
Fragile the touch
Nothing to say
I'm so afraid... stay!

To climb into heaven
Prevented no scars
The last thing we shared
Was a view to the stars
We said goodbye
Nobody's fault
Love ain't a lie
We went the same road
