I've turned from you
And I left back dark
A cold silence for your heart

Suddenly the sky paints Perseid
Remember me and I'll return
For hearts to burn

I've turned from you and left back dark
A cold silence for your suffering heart
Oh I've turned to ashes as we burned
But I will return

I've left you broken and scared
Although your memories are blurred
The pains a blade to say
That took me away

Suddenly the sky paints Perseid
Remember me and I'll return
For hearts to burn
Eternally those flames will rain from me
And the night sky turns to gold
A sight to behold

A place beyond space and time
A throne in the stars... sublime
Where time is eternal and dead's overcome
Into the sun

In darkness you wait for a star to shine
While your quivering light stands the test of time
It burns low it burns low
And I want return to you
