The past it lies in ruins
Devastation and demise
This is the ending of all endings
There's fire burning in the skies

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Every life is taken one at a time
This whole planet will be shattered
Mankind is doomed once and for ever

The burning world lies at our feed
And now the future is obsolete
It's time to overcome my Hadephobia at the gates of dystopia

In the ashes and the dust
We've lost our hope and our trust
This is the path to the promised land
She holds my hand as we enter dystopia

All is lost
A burning wasteland

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
I promise you that we will be fine
We need to run to escape the damnation and the demons inside to find our
salvation

I close my eyes
Still see the fires burning
I shut my ears
Still I can hear them screaming
Don't wanna see it
Why can't I lies
Don't wanna see it
Why can't I...
