Until the end I will drift through endless space painting stars
And in your dreams I'll be there for you to see
When it's dark

I can't remember when my journey began
I'm blind of stardust and I can't see the end
There is a voice inside that pushes me on
Across the universe and back to where I came from

There is nothing more but emptiness
And I forgot so much that I cannot confess
There's so much dark, so much work to be done
And every time I'm finished there dies another one

Until the end I will drift through endless space painting stars
And in your dreams I'll be there for you to see
When it's dark
Eternally I will gild this endless space
Painting stars
And for all times there will be a monument in the dark

An endless fight against oblivion
This alien Sisyphus that I have become
Inside me burns the color of the sun
Inside the nebulae my work is far from done
I cannot rest, I can't lay down
I am stuck to the stars and I cannot come down
I cannot feel and I cannot love
I've had to leave my heart back in those heavens above

I must be finished before the world ends
Or we are nothing more
But footsteps in moon sand
