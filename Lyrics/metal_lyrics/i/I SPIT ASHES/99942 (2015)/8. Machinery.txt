There's only numbers in my mind and still I ask myself
Is this really me or just another trial and error
There is no sense in what I'm doing anymore
Like a useless spirit I still roam

There is no progress. My only wish
Delete myself. There's no more progress
Outdated software outworn race
And so I suffer
There's no one left to shut me down
Oh, Lord, I suffer
There's no more knowledge to be known

I'm sill alive while my bones are rotten
Screws and wires crown the head
I am the last god to be forgotten
'Cause mankind is dead

So I last in space in my small shell
A.I. from the beginning of heaven to the end of hell
So I came across the time
Through a billion worlds I fall
Shut down the machinery

There is no living
There is no turning back for me
There's no salvation
Soulless software not for me
There is no concept
There's no one left to make me be
There is no accept
There is no mouth to tell what I have seen

I'm still alive while you are still dead
Screws and wires crown the head
Bring me stars and sand to create a new earth
For a lonesome machine and another stillbirth
