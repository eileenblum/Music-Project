Like an astronaut
I am watching you
You forgot what I taught
I am watching you
And your perishing thoughts

Astronaut

My tears are not the rain
Dead hearts can't love
Hold your breath within
Take a look above

It's raining for you stars now
Make a wish, make a wish
It's raining for you stars now
Make a wish, your last wish

Like an astronaut
I am leaving you
Fire and smoke
I am leaving you
Not only a thought

It's raining for you stars now
Make a wish, make a wish
It's raining for you stars now
Make a wish, your last wish

Like an astronaut
You sent me into pure black
I will light the sky
As a shooting star
I will come back
