Abominations or fantasy
A world beyond. This cannot be
Imagination. Reality
A new horizon for open eyes to see

We are the fourth kind
Existence denied
We are the residents of light
Existence denied
We live and breathe technology
Our seed is received
If you can see just follow me
A world for those who believed fourth kind

Your denial is wasting time
The sublime wisdom's in a vial

You are the sickness and I am the cure
And I will release enlightenment so pure

Wars of perception. Your minds burned out
The inception. The death of doubts
A new world out. Oblivion
Cross the border. Forgotten children

You are the sickness and I am the cure
And I will release enlightenment so pure

Abominations or fantasy
A world beyond. This cannot be
Imagination. Reality
A new horizon for open eyes to see
