Out of the night that covers me
Black as the pit from pole to pole
Thank what ever gods may be for my unconquerable soul

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried a loud
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody but unbowed

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the horror of the shade
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid

It matters not how strait the gate
How charged with punishments the scroll
I am the master of my fate
I am the captain of my soul

I see the stars falling down
I feel the cold grip of the end

As I leave this dying world I know
My old soul will not pretend

And the sulphurous smell of hell
Can not frighten my honest heart

Invictus!
