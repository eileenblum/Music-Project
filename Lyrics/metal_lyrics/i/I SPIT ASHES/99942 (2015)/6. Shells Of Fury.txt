Hail and fire is thrown to the earth
Burning up all trees and every blade of grass
By the second trumpet sounding
Poison to the sea
No single live should be spared inside the oceans
Water to blood

This is the moment of decay
There's no revival
Regardless to whom you pray
There's seven seals the be unleashed
I'll be there
Seven trumpets on their way

A star it falls
It falls to earth
See the stars are falling down

By the fourth trumpet sounding
Darkness reigns the sky
Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth
Open the bottomless pit unleash the locusts
A brute force of angels will invade this earth
and his kingdom will come

As the final trumpet sounds
You'll stand in line there's no mercy to be found
You will be rammed into the ground
And pray for the king
A king is to be crowned
