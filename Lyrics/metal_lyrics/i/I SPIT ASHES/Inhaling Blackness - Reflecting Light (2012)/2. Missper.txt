Oh fuck!

Can't you feel it's going down?
I feel it, I feel!
Can't you see a world comes tumbling down?
I see it, I see!

Break loose! Break the silence!
Before it comes undone
A broken hourglass
A last grain on the run!
It's going down!

Can't you feel it's going down?
I feel it, I feel!

So close to something
That cannot be undone
A delayed action
That seems to be condoned
We didn't see, we didn't care, we didn't listen
Woke from dreaming, to find that something's missing

I feel it, I feel
In retrospect all signs where pointing on this dark escape
A silent scream, a lockdown with one broken gate

Can't you feel it's going down?
I feel it, I feel!

So close to something
That cannot be undone
A delayed action
That seems to be condoned
We didn't see, we didn't care, we didn't listen
Woke from dreaming, to find that something's missing

I feel it, I feel
Can't you feel it's going down?
I feel it, I feel!
Can't you see a world comes tumbling down?
I see it, I see!

Can't you feel it's going down?
I feel it, I feel!

So close to something
That cannot be undone
A delayed action
That seems to be condoned
We didn't see, we didn't care, we didn't listen
Woke from dreaming, to find that something's missing
So close to something
And now it is too late
No reaction
But the choices that you've made
I didn't see,I didn't care,I didn't listen
Woke from dreaming, this world lacks compensation
