I cannot rest from travel
I will drink life to the lees
On my shoulder smiles the devil
Your dreams free fly those planes of peace

But if my body lies sleeping in your arms
My heart is gliding 'cross the ocean
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy
I am a part of all that I have met
I am become a name
I am become a name
I am become a name

And as hard as I do wish to stay
My heart won't stop to dream away
From far I wish you'd feel embraced
Little remains but every hour is saved
From that eternal silence, something more

Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'
Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades
Forever and for ever when I move
How dull it is to pause, to make an end

And as hard as I do wish to stay
My heart won't stop to dream away
From far I wish you'd feel embraced
Little remains but every hour is saved
A bringer of new things and vile it were
For some three suns to store and hoard myself
And this gray spirit yearning to desire
To follow knowledge like a sinking star

Beyond the utmost bound of human thought

As tho' to breathe were life! Life piled on life
Were all too little and of one to me
There lies to port the vessel puffs her sails
There gloom the dark broad seas
My mariners...
