When the daylight dies
There's a quiet demise
I'm longing I'm searching the black man is gone
I pray for the sun to rise
Lost in lightless lies
I'm longing I'm searching but I stay alone

So what have I done?
Even my shadow has left me alone!
I cannot face my deeds
That so much of me died
A world occupied by creeps
Is begging for the night

I have sold my soul
For a life in cowl
I'm begging I'm screaming I can't change what's done
I have made my choice
By the thunder's voice
I'm longing I'm searching but I stay alone

So what have I done?
Even my shadow has left me alone!
I cannot face my deeds
That so much of me died
A world occupied by creeps
Is begging for the night

In darkness lies a life that wouldn't die
In darkness lies a silent voiceless cry
In darkness lies a heart that was once mine
In darkness lies a shadow all the time
a shadow, a shadow all the time

So what have I done?
Even my shadow has left me alone!
I cannot face my deeds
That so much of me died
A world occupied by creeps
Is begging for the night
