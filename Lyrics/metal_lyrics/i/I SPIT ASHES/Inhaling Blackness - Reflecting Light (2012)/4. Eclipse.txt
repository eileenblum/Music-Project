So sick of consequences
Can't stop the voices in my head
One step to close to madness
Still breathing but inside I am dead
Their soil upon my hands
Gorges slowly through my skin
All those resistance chants
Have been burned there from within
I know the day will come
I know the day will come
I know the day will come
I know the day will come

You will bow! Bow down!
For now embrace the silence
Before the great eclipse
I know for sure the day will come
That you will all bow!

It's my last warning
Either you are with me or against
Just hear the calling
This is the time before time ends
You know the day will come
You know the day will come

You will bow! Bow down!
For now embrace the silence
Before the great eclipse
I know for sure the day will come
That you will all bow!

Black clouds arise
Over those huts you call your home
I won't think twice,
you'll fear the truth that I have become
I know the day will come
I know the day will come
You know the day will come
You know the day will come

You will bow! Bow down!
For now embrace the silence
Before the great eclipse
I know for sure the day will come
That you will all bow!
Bow!
