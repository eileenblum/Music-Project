I cannot break the circle
My life keeps drowning me
I hate so much to try
To be someone I cannot be
A constant fear to lose myself is all I've got
It once was love and good and safe but now it's not

And this is coming to an end
Pray for me! I'll cross the borderline
Oh pray for me! I'm tearing up myself
Pray for me! I cross the border of insanity
Pray for me!

Another sick reaction
Another moment I'll regret
I hate you! I love you!
Another scar you won't forget
I cannot stop to hurt myself and those I love
I can't control, I can't escape
And my own mind just gets me off

I cross the borderline!

And this is coming to an end
Pray for me! I'll cross the borderline
Oh pray for me! I'm tearing up myself
Pray for me! I cross the border of insanity
Pray for me!

To all the things I can't forget
My life keeps dancing with the dead
So many things to be unsaid
Please kill the shadows in my head

Pray for me! I'll cross the borderline
Oh pray for me! I'm tearing up myself
Pray for me! I cross the border of insanity
Pray for me!
Pray for me!
