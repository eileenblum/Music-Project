I shrinked the world, to fit myself
Life's just an echo in my head
Forever lost, inside myself
I'm weaving shadows with the dead
From time to time I hear your voice
Calling me from inside of me

From time to time I start to colorize
The things that I will never see

This is the time, a new beginning
I am colorblind
No chance to end immortal ending
I am lost inside
And when the rain, it turns to dust
A last light to overcome
I'm chasing moonrays through the night
I am lost inside

Dig your away inside the oak
Burrowed under the ancient cloak
Find me by the heart of this earth
Follow the dark to find my light
Search me where the shades come to birth
Moonray guidance through the night

This is the time, a new beginning
I am colorblind
No chance to end immortal ending
I am lost inside
And when the rain, it turns to dust
A last light to overcome
I'm chasing moonrays through the night
I am lost inside

And so I pray that you'll find me
Somewhere at the end of grace
Twinkle twinkle little star
Oh I wonder where you are
Where are you where is my light
Lost inside

This is the time, a new beginning
I am colorblind
No chance to end immortal ending
I am lost inside
And when the rain, it turns to dust
A last light to overcome
I'm chasing moonrays through the night
I am lost inside
This is the time,
this is the time,
a new beginning
No chance to end
No chance to end
Immortal ending
And when the rain, it turns to dust
A last light to overcome
I'm chasing moonrays through the night
I am lost inside
