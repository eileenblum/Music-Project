Dying is a real slow progress
You try to live before you're old
Just for once I'll scratch the surface
And escape this lasting cold

Someday I will, I will leave traces
To finally fulfill my prophecy
But the more I carve the more erases
And this emptiness keeps killing me

I hope someday I will see clearly
That I will lose this inner fear

The wall that I'm climbing keeps growing
As the chance that I fall every day
And the distant horizon's still pulling
The sun always one step further away

There's razor wire 'round my heart
The more I flee it's tightening
The day they injected me the poison
I couldn't even feel the sting

Someday I will, I will embrace this
Moment that is left of me
But as long this chase continues
I'm losing what is left of me

The wall that I'm climbing keeps growing
As the chance that I fall every day
And the distant horizon's still pulling
The sun always one step further away!

Dying is a real slow progress
It is hard to live before you're old
Can't find my way above the surface
And escape this empty vault

Someday I will, I will leave traces
To finally fulfill my prophecy
But the more I carve the more erases
And this emptiness keeps killing me

Besides I long for nothing

The wall that I'm climbing keeps growing
As the chance that I fall every day
And the distant horizon's still pulling
The sun always one step further away
Over the clouds my live is waiting
That's what I keep on telling me everyday
Just once in a lifetime not forsaken
But this day's always one step further away
