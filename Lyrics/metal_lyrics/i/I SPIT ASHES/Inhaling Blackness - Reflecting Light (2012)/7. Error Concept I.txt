All I ever did feel wrong by now
One billion plans and I didn't finished at least one
I've got stuck in my own life
Blinded by my own sorrow

I am tired, I can't sleep
The ground I am building on keeps shaking
I am lost, I can't hide
No awakening, no chance to escape

I don't expect you to understand
Nor do I
Holding my life in my hand
Broken wings don't fly
I am 300 years old and one of billion stars
Death has just forgotten about me

I have obeyed to your rules and
Did what you taught me to be right
But my story of empty pages doesn't want to end
Love turns hate, day turns night

I am angry, I feel bare
The world I'm living in keeps breaking
This came out of nowhere
And is leading to nothing

I don't expect you to understand
Nor do I
Holding my life in my hand
Broken wings don't fly
I am 300 years old and one of billion stars
Death has just forgotten about me

I am too tired to remember who I was
Or who I've tried to be
Who I was, or who I've tried to be

I am your world
But my world once reached from mountains to the sea
I am your dream
I have a dream of you to set me free

Inside now cuts like a knife
I am so sorry for my lies
You have wasted all your life
Looking through my eyes
Inside now cuts like a knife
I am so sorry for my lies
You have wasted all your life
Looking through my eyes
