Through the cracks in the mirror
My life runs to the other side
The distant tempest's coming closer
This longing screams so deep inside

I can't remember any time
That I have felt this way
I can't remember the last time
My heart's started to gainsay
I can't remember the last time
But every now and then
I will remember that someday
I'll be unbroken again!

Through the dirty broken glass
I hear voices whispering from the other side
Susurration silky carols
Serenity and everlasting light

I can't remember any time
That I have felt this way
I can't remember the last time
My heart's started to gainsay
I can't remember the last time
But every now and then
I will remember that someday
I'll be unbroken again!

And opalescence smile shines through the wrenched gate
And unfulfilled quest a pain to bate

Through the mirror
Runs my life to the other side
The distant tempest's coming closer
This longing screams so deep inside

I can't remember any time
That I have felt this way
I can't remember the last time
My heart's started to gainsay
I can't remember the last time
But every now and then
I will remember that someday
I'll be unbroken again!
Unbroken!
