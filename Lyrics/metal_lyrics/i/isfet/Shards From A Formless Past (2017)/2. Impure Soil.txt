So, there the fruits of perdition still grow! I was told!
Impotent voice, extinguished by the blade we still hold! I was told!
Amidst those who are still untamed
Land's purity violated â thy virgin soil was raped

Let us stand, let us stand â erect in the eternal desert's sand
And behold, behold â so the seed now procreate as I was told
Of fire, of fire â this soil emanates our ophidic desire

So, this soil once enshrined, place of my solace
Profound, desolated, where tainted blood first permeated
Where no prying eyes could see, lits our fires of malice
Our fate becomes eternally incinerated

Let us stand, let us stand â erect in the eternal desert's sand
And behold, behold â so the seed now procreate as I was told
Of fire, of fire â this soil emanates our ophidic desire

Abrupt turmoil enrages the soil as my presence perpetuates
Deceitful wake, oblivious towards the unending grace
â¦ I am the bridge from beyond

Shameless life force paints the ground, obscene path
From the symbolic act I hold a fragment
Scatter our seeds throughout their ways
Forget your needs, salvation is absent.
