Has she looked for a trace of admiration in me?
How was the expression on her face, when contempt was all she came to see?

Under the skies of decadence
Mine are the sparks that blinded the eyes of providence

For frail are the ways of conviction
How could you not wander in doubt?
Persistent is the blossoming sedition
See the infamous seeds starting to sprout
If white are the flowers of creation
When petals fall and stars cry
Black are the springs of damnation
Radiant brightness shall fulfill the eyes of mine

Dethroned are the symbols of misleading bliss
unfolding visions of impossibilities

Iâve seen the herald of falseness hanging
In the gallows of mistrust
While those who went astray were partaking
On a dance of enticing lust!

For frail are the ways of conviction
How could you not wander in doubt?
Persistent is the blossoming sedition
See the infamous seeds starting to sprout
If white are the flowers of creation
When petals fall and stars cry
Black are the springs of damnation
Radiant brightness shall fulfill the eyes of mine

Witness of the falls
Witness of it all

So the famished season persists
To sweep all traces of morality
thenceforward
hell followed with me.
