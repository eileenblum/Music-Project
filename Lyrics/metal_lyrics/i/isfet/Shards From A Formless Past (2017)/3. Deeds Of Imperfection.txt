Decrepit since birth and till all veil to tear
The once indolent corpse crippled by the season that draws near
Tracing thorny steps, at dusk I roam,
and all fields I maculate
For it is a season of deliverance, Iâve surpassed the causality of fate

How could one deny the burden his deeds enfold?
Seeing the clamant manifestation of the acts untold
How could one deny the burden his deeds enfold?
Oh nefarious attraction, deeds of imperfection

Nefarious attraction, perversity I swallow
voluntary scourge to an enlightenment rite
The heart that was once so hollow
now embraced with pure negative light
I walk on valleys that no one dared to follow
I inhaled the sacred perfumes from the moonâs womb
Nefarious attraction, the perversity I swallow
Wrapped in a shroud stained in doom

When the fog vanished and the gates shone so bright
Iâve seen my true self, concealed in unearthly might
Manifest thou, Oh impure desire
Venomous mark, no longer hides

How could one deny the burden his deeds enfold?
Seeing the clamant manifestation of the acts untold
How could one deny the burden his deeds enfold?
Oh nefarious attraction, deeds of imperfection

Tracing thorny steps, at dusk I roam
and all fields I maculate
For it is a season of deliverance,
and thorny are the gateways

They condemn the brightness
Praise rebellion, seed the violence.
