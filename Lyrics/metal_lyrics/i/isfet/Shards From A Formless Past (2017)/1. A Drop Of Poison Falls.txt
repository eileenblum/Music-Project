âAnd like a poison drop, I touch the unsparing coldness of the earthâ

Distant voice, subtle like a sigh
however, scorching as the sun and craving to untie...
How long have I waited for it to return!
To unravel thine daedal depths
Wordless voice, upheld me in this hopelessness
by the warmth of your sedative breath

A drop of poison falls!
Longing to infestâ¦
It has beheld those who crawled
With delight, nonethelessâ¦
And for this fall Iâve swore
The four winds witnessed
A drop of poison falls!
Into godâs breast

When the grace of emptiness reigned
no limits dared to exist
I spit upon thee
breeder of all cowardice

Some waters received me, through familiar eyes
Am I diving deep, or flying an effortless flight?

Acts you inspire, silhouettes you project
Bitter venom from your chalice, inconceivable to reject

A drop of poison falls!
Longing to infestâ¦
It has beheld those who crawled
With delight, nonethelessâ¦
And for this fall Iâve swore
The four winds witnessed
A drop of poison falls!
Into godâs breast.
