To weave a shroud that embraces
the undefined, who bears a thousand faces
Yet the penetrating gaze has never vanished
the shards remain sharper than ever
Look to the pale star, once overjoyed
It is the dawn of the ruin
the ruin of a cycle that seemed endless

As tragedy comes ashore,
becomes worthless to ignore
By the cunning of my guide
I dived away into the nightside of life

Unanimated flesh, disfigured soul
to temptation their heads were bowed
Dense miasma exhales the essence
Of All timeâs
Obsolescence

Shards from a formless past!
The caress of temptation engraved
Shards from a formless past!
Tides change just like a serpentâs scale

Plenitude gives way to nothingness
Enthroned in the perpetual depths
devours every piece of something that never was
and repels in disgust.

Unanimated flesh, disfigured soul
to temptation their heads were bowed
Dense miasma exhales the essence
Of All timeâs
Obsolescence.
