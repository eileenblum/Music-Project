A rusty throne
Once occupied by innocenceâs joy
Now left to succumb, lethargic sun
Giving light to my eyes as I wait for it to fade
Open wide the throat of eternity
Unchained from infertility
To become one with the waters
Open wide the throat of eternity
A portal to abnormality
Extinguish now, sands of time! â Towards my triumph finally

Feathers that were so shining white
dyed in the grey spiteful tears that run from my eyes
The everlasting suffocation â No time could ever tell
Above the mist â In silence I dwell

Restless child who lasts
Tunes of sadness became a pest
A reign under distress
Oh, how one could have seen?

Entity of the winds, bearer of all sins
on the tunnels of myself, you have always been

Feathers that were so shining white
dyed in the grey spiteful tears that run from my eyes
Eyelids that sheltered fiercely â an anguishing dissent
Brought with them, soulful intent

Walls to adorn
With tinctures of scorn
Cries of a thousand regrets
My ashes shall be gone with the storm
But with me, the root of our misery
will be entombed.

As the pathway is clear
a morbid pantheon welcomes
Sanity farewells
Borders become mere sights
of a new and vast plain.
