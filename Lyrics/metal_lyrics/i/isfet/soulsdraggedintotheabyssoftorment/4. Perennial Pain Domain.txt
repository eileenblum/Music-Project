I contemplate these trees,
Their pale leaves reflects
The light that is above
Under a crimson moon

A shimmering light reveals the entrance
It's a long and tortuous road
Covered by autumn's fallen leaves

As I walk through the way of the decayed
Memories of lost souls hover the air
A maze where there is no escape and many perished
I am brought forth by this blinding glare

Total negation of human moral 
My journey is no longer mundane
Entering the ruins Iâve met my fate
For so long I've waited

A moment of mystical perceptions lead me to an abysmal gloom,
realizing that life is nothing but illusional lies

As I walk through the way of the decayed
Memories of lost souls hover the air
A maze where there is no escape and many perished
I am brought forth by this blinding glare

My flesh is touched by venomous lips
I know this demise was not in vain
My existence now lies beyond mortal eyes
as I enter the domain of perennial pain
