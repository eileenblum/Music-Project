Rise, from the bestial domain
In the neverending vortex of hate
Rotting, reborn from flames
Behold the insurgent bringer of pain

The one with eyes open wide
Despises the creation
As obscurity takes by
Feels a morbid pleasure
The inner visions of the resister
Thy curse is thy treasure
Bewitched children of desolation
Rebirth, unholy procreation

Empires are falling
Wolves are howling
Mankind is crawling
Satan's calling 

The one with eyes open wide
Despises the creation
As obscurity takes by
Feels a morbid pleasure
The inner visions of the resister
Thy curse is thy treasure
Bewitched children of desolation
Rebirth, unholy procreation
