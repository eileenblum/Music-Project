As I stare at the dying sun
The light fades away
In eternal blackness bounded
By the chains of fate
In a pit where sorrow lies
And the dawn is late

I still hear their cries
All frailty unleashed
They degenerate
From wolves to sheep

My existence between the flesh and space
Afterlife while they would live blinded
I'd rather die
Enlightened by the flames of reason
Free as the shadows consumes the land
I watch myself rising to the kingdom beyond

Madness has just begun.
