As time goes by
and actions don't lie
we don't fear death
we rush the rest

we try to live 
in giving sense
to the rest of time
which is our last

The end is coming
i know my dark way
and there's a light
but i cannot stay

the way to hell
chills from start to end
so why get heaven
if there is no good chance

declining considered
i'm livin'
i'm just trying
deep lieing beyond wings
been trusting in my actings

in my actings

[Refrain]
These are my last days
My last days on earth

Now, it's the end
i am on my way
to get some calm
oh i better stay

cause hell is better
than the the stayin'
by war, crise
and fuckin' pain

declining considered
i'm livin'
no more tryin'
deep lieing beyond things
been trusting in my actings

in my actings

[Refrain]
These are my last days
My last days
Last days
Last days on earth

declining considered
i'm dead
i'm just tryin'
deep liein' in my dark grave
been trusting in my actings
no more
no more

[Refrain]
These are
These are my last days
My last days
Last days on earth
Last days on earth
Last days on earth
