thats the world, infection is coming to
its the pain, your souls will feel for sure
if you want, you can let it be
to be the one, to be a thunder spree

darkest sight, twisted mind
endless fear, fuckin grind
end of hope, all is gone
twist our pain, for infections

[Refrain]
hear the call from the stars above
callin' you to fear your sensless past
for the sake of fear in your nonsense life
on your way from dust 
into a better time

wasted time, in a wasted life
cloudy days, as i prefer to die
no more fear no more senseless fear 
make your move, i will be right here

darkest sight, twisted mind
endless fear, fuckin grind
end of hope, all is gone
twist our pain, for infections

[Refrain]
hear the call from the stars above
callin' you to fear your sensless past
for the sake of fear in your nonsense life
on your way from dust 
into a better time

into a better time

infect my mind
infect my mind

[Refrain]
hear the call from the stars above
callin' you to fear your sensless past
for the sake of fear in your nonsense life
on your way from dust 
to a better time
