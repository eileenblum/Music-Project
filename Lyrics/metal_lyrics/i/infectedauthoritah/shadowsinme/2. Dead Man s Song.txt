no more mercy 
no more fear
no more shadows
on my way down there

no more time
is left for me
now choose your weapon
it's you i'm gonna seek

time to hate
time to rise
time to kill

it's not wrong
it's time to sing
singin' the dead mans song

[Refrain]
just pull the trigger 
and fire the guns
fire your guns
the time of the hopeless
has just begon
just begon

throw away
all your fear thats left
nothings left
just fire your guns
it is your last chance

much more anger
much more war
much more dead men
singin the dead mans song

to all the loosers
and all the mad
straight to my enemy's
straight in their head

[Refrain]
just pull the trigger 
and fire the guns
fire your guns
the time of the hopeless
has just begon
just begon

throw away
all your fear thats left
nothings left
just fire your guns
it is your last chance

living on the edge of time
living in a prison 
but no one will forget my sins
i'm dying without a reason

they ran
they screamed
they feared
but now it's there 
i can see clear

it's me 
i thought so wrong
it's me 
who's singin the dead mans song

i know it's over
i'm a dead man
my sins have taken
a lower stand

no more mercy
for my soul
i'm depending
on my life no more

it's me 
i thought so wrong
it's me 
who's singin the dead mans song

[Refrain]
just pull the trigger 
and fire the guns
fire your guns
the time of the hopeless
has just begon
just begon

throw away
all your fear thats left
nothings left
just fire your guns
it is your last chance
