I woke up 
consumed of hate
i got up and turned outside
driven of rage
fresh inflamed

sky's dismal
not one single sunbeam
it seemed the world around
would adept to my dark soul

adept to my dark soul
adept to my dark soul

[Refrain]
my glances aren't returned
my words not heard
my deeds not seen
can't feel anything but rage
anything but rage

I woke up 
consumed of hate
i got up and turned outside
driven of rage
fresh inflamed

sky's dismal
not one single sunbeam
it seemed the world around
would adept to my black soul

adept to my black soul

[Refrain]
my glances aren't returned
my words not heard
my deeds not seen
can't feel anything but rage
rage
rage
nothing but rage

nothing but rage

[Solo]

rage
rage
rage
nothing but rage
