can't you hear it
the screams of all my hatred
can't you feel that
it's everywhere i've been yet

life is showing me a way
no solutions, death 'n decay
watch me going through my live
don't follow me, i won't survive

i'm afraid to loose myself
my mind can not control that
and something really dark in me
is breakin down my surface

please release me
please release the shadows in me

[Refrain:]
save me, save me
oh save me from myself
save me, save me
oh save me from the shadows in me

i thought the best
but can't ignore that feeling
i thought it could be well forever
but that is not the dealing

i'm crying a thousand tears
for every shadow
i'm loosing that one thing
the courage to face my life

please take the shadows
the dark is coming nearer
please help my soul
i hope its gettin clearer
someday

please release me
please release the shadows in me

[Refrain:]
save me, save me
oh save me from myself
save me, save me
oh save me from the shadows in me

my time is now
to leave it all behind
my time is now
not longer i'm so blind

everything i live for
and everything i stand for
will help me to be free
to release the shadows in me

release me
release me
release me from myself
release me
release me
release me from the shadows in me

[Refrain:]

save me from myself
save me, save me
oh save me, please, please save me
save me, save me
save me from myself
save me, save me
oh save me from the shadows in me
