Your life ends now
To be ended by my hand
Your life ends now
Just a waste of flesh

Plotting my every move to every step you take
Waiting for the chance to do my deed
Of defilement and murder
To end this trick of this fucking town
Struggle is now cease clorophorm is what you breath
Your life is at my hand to do as I please
To be thrown into a world of suffering

Eradication of this disease fested trap
At which has lured so many men

Severing flesh slowly regain your consciousness feeling of pain
It's all she feels
It's all she feels
Eyes gouged while smiling ear to ear
Eyes gouged while smiling ear to ear

Filthy whore blinded by your own beauty
Look at where this has gotten you
Facial Desecration
Where has all the beauty gone

Rid this earth of this foul wretched thing

Heart stops in someone heartless
Heart stops in someone heartless
To hide which no one bother to find
Forgotten and buried

FUCK YOU
Sluts cunts and whores
Sluts cunts and whores
You're nothing but a fake
