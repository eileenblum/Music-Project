Worthless scum
Backstabbing traitor you will pay for what you have done
To turn you back on me
To cut the ties pours salt in the wound
You will never amounting to anything
Treacherous snake in the grass
Compulsive liar you are mistaken
Just because Iâm not there doesnât mean i do not hear
You spineless fuck
Recreant
This is what you have earned
To live a life not worth living
Laughing as you burn
I will not stop till your blood runs cold
Thereâs no respect for the cowardly weak
Thereâs no respect for the weak and cowardly
Live in fear die in vane
YOU FUCKING COWARD
Coward show me what you stand for
