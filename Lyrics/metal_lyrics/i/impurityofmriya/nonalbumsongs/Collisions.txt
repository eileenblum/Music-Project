Place your fucking bets, Fucking ante up.
War of fucking wars, Buildings burning up.
Shit has hit the fan, What the fuck is up?
Everyone is dead, Everyone is.. DEAD!.

Buildings burning up. Nothing will be.
A war for everyone, One so ever lasting.
Everyday we are born, We adjust to slavery.
Executing bravery, It's a sentence we cannot escape.

Everyday we are fucking born, We assume slavery.
We pay the tab for everyone.

You don't want them, You don't let them live.
You don't want them to return. [x2]
So fuck them all.

Monuments served as homes, Bled before the slaves.
Everything else, Anything goes.
Let's Begin

For all that's sick, For all that's died.
I will slay, I will fight.
According to me, God has died.
I will Bleed, I will burn.

This is the day of the fucking hostile,
After today I'll be fucking exiled.

This is the day.........
