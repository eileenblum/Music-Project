Again, the city has fallen asleep
Left its children out in the open
The shadows approach, closing in on him
They want him back

The Haven is gone away for good
All sanctuaries are lost forever
In a vast, gaping hope of all things past
Past and broken

The unbearable longing
Carved his insides hollow
Irreplaceable shelter
That once was home for all hallow
It seems that there's no path
That would lead out of this draft
Without the guiding light
Every way is an astray

The bridge is burning with him standing on it
He falls down weeping to the flames he set
The fire doesn't cleanse, it leaves him stained
There's no one rising from the ashes

Now it all has been scorched away
Nothing left but ashes, nothing but dust
How to lead a life with nothing
Nothing but dust

The poison numbs the pain
The guilt that crawls in the veins
Try to hide away
Keep the loss concealed
