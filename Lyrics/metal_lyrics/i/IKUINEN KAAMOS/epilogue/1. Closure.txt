Now when the world has died
Invite the grief inside
The sun has faded away

The end on display
Naked, empty shell of flesh
Nothing left to bid farewell

Crashing, burning, take it all down
Screaming, hurting, take it all away

Take it all away , take it all away

The hurt burns their faces
Cold stares cut so deep
Listen to the futile words
No comfort inside these walls
No rest for the ones left behind

Closing the door for the last time
Final glimpse of light unveils the eyes
Filled with freezing calmness

The crowd awaits for the
Hero of the fay praying
Hoping that this day comes to an end

Crashing, burning, take it all down
Screaming, hurting, take it all away

Take it all away , take it all away

The wanderers left alone
Scattered in million pieces
Listen to the word
All in one row, divided
All with the same burden

The abyss is open
Waiting for your sad march
The writings don't lie
There's no way out
