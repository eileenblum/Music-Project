The freezing rain ceases to fall on earth
The raindrops glitter like stars through the leaves
The man leans against a high cliff side
And mutters alone in an echoing deep voice

The man recalls in madness
The past of bleak oblivion
The figment of intoxicated mind
The gruesome murder of purity

And the guilt weighs his heart
Ending lives without judgement
Entrusting the soul to mercy
Watching as the time passes by

The man raises his head in sorrow
And stares beyond the cliffs
He dreams of the timeless fall
Air that frees the fallen soul
The ground on his tired sight
Turns into vast darkness
The man gathers his last strength
And takes the first step of the ascent
