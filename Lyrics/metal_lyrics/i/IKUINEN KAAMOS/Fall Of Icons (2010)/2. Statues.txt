Welcome to the
Devolution of man
Regression to a primate
Descent to the turmoil of cruelty

Eruption of pure cold hate
Sweeps trough our heads
Like a blastwave
Common sense all wiped out

Fighting for the ignorance
Desperate to be blind
So reluctant to see
So eager to make a fist

The sound of enragement
Too intoxicating to forget
No shame, no regrets

Smoke filled lungs
Mist filled minds
Lives build on false ideals
Lead by dead morals

Fragile bones
Fragile souls
All that we ever wanted
Scapegoats to the slaughter

It will all go down in flames

Pour the gasoline
Set the world ablaze
With your righteousness
The memorial for compassion

Again the words are futile
Not a thing will be changed
Paralyzed into a sculpture
Statues of blackened wrath

Loathing of life
Doctrines of death
So cold, so right
The new breed of fools
Vicious circle
Of rightful vendetta
Never changing statues

Time to fall from grace
Time to bring the end
Time to descent
Time to pray for the end

By the end we had accomplished nothing
