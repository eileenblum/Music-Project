The path grows wild behind me
Something stalking
Stalking around me
You have found me

I'll break the hour glass
To free the sands
That I gathered
For nothing

Carve your name under my skin
The mark of the beast, the mark of the divine
Swallow my soul, swallow me whole
Consume my existence

I cut myself open
Bury you inside me
I pour the filth out
Bury you underneath

You reach from the depths
Hands around my throat, around my mind
Hold on tight
With a grip that devours my life

We have reached the point
Of inevitable solution
An ugly sight
Still our eyes are gazed on upon it
Then we act
Laughing
