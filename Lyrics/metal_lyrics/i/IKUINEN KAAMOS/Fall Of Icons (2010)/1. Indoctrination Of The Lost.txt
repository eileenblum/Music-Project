It comes in tidal waves
Soothing and cold
Hypothermia of the minds
Sets me free, releases me

Vows of grandeur
Sincerely spoken
Naively believed

This is what I sell
Promise of ecstasy
Swallowed by the masses
Cherished by we all

Devastating birth pains of bliss
Will bring you down to your knees
Necessary purification
Before paradise

Vows of supremacy
Indoctrination
Of the lost

I will buy your life
Pay my debts with strife
This is for
Your own good

Fear of tomorrow
Through the yesterday
Praying for the absolution
Before the judging eyes

The fear of ourselves
What have I become
No hope for the absolution
Behold, the judgment is here
Today

Icon of pure deception
My words are of acid
Now the boiling blisters
Cover you all over

Benevolence is gone
Compulsions left
Dead end existence
That I forced you to

And this I swear
I will lay your
World to waste
The realm in my shade
Oblivion is nigh
So very nigh
