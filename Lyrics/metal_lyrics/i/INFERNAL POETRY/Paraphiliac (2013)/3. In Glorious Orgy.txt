The worst sickness has to come
A purest fest fisting sluts
The smelly sweat we still got
Will melt with tears in skull-pot

Have you ever asked yourself about our last will?
Have you ever thought of what will become of us?
What scene shall we play?
In lusty, dirty screams

We'll fuck
Before the end
We'll suck
No more to pretend
We'll fuck
Before the end
We'll suck
Random love till death

As death humiliates our race
Millenary epic face-to-face
Demoniac self-esteem
Black trademark support beam

Feel free to borrow my bones
Dying community sharing tongues
Three words collapse in your eyes
Self culture freeze in ice

Have you ever asked yourself about our last will?
Have you ever thought of what will become of us?
What scene shall we play?
In lusty, dirty screams

We'll fuck
Before the end
We'll suck
No more to pretend
We'll fuck
Before the end
We'll suck
Random love till death

[4x]
Until your stomach explodes
Until your pupils will blow

We'll fuck
Before the end
We'll suck
No more to pretend
We'll fuck
Before the end
We'll suck
Random love till death
