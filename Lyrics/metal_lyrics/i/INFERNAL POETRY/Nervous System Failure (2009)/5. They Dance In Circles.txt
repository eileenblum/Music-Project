Floating thoughts all around
Awful noises with no sound
A while ago they seemed to work
But now they start to walk!
They opened eyes
I asked âWhy?â
They said âIt's OKâ
Hey freaks don't lie!

1 2 3 steps
4 5 6 stop
7 8 9 don't touch what's mine!
Don't speak
Don't call
Don't rock
Don't roll
I don't feel fine if you grab what's mine!
They dance in circle tonight!
They match my name with strange rimes
They dance in circle tonight!
They sing a song with strange rimes!

Lurking smiles everywhere
Maybe here
Maybe there
A while ago they had no mouth
But now they start to laugh!
They break my ears
I asked âwhy?â
They said âIt's OKâ
Hey freaks don't lie!

1 2 3 steps
4 5 6 stop
7 8 9 don't touch what's mine!
Don't speak
Don't call
Don't rock
Don't roll
I don't feel fine if you grab what's mine!
They dance in circle tonight!
They match my name with strange rimes
They dance in circle tonight!
They sing a song with strange rimes!

Oh my god there's something wrong?
Maybe yes or maybe not
What's the meaning of this absurd song?
Maybe nothing maybe the whole

Thoughts are mine
Weren't they born to serve?
Just until they don't walk with verve!
What's the meaning of this absurd song?
Maybe nothing maybe the whole
