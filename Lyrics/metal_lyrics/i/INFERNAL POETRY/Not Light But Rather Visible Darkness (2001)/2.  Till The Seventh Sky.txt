Lift your eyes to the sky and tell me if
you're not engaged by itself 
do you really think you belong to this world? 
Could you really say you're coming from this world? 
What I'm seeing now it's the brightness of clouds 
Celestial vision embraces mankind (greatest inspiration) 
Oh man so poor before these immense spaces 
Sweet wingless angel trapped in foreign land 
(lift your eyes to the sky)
RIT: Disclose this limb, Armageddon 
Born to dream, guide my soul 
'till the seventh sky 
oh sad illusion, what secrets disguised 
primal delirium, universal demand (I would discover) 
Eyes then will cry, prisoner souls in our minds 
Waiting for a new life, our spirit will fly (to dream forever) 
Open your frontiers, just disclose your eyes 
Lift your look to the sky, to the space, and tell me 
If you are not engaged by this sweet natural spectacle 
Lift your look through the dark, to the space, to the firmament 
I will show this is the way, the sweetest way to fly (to die) 
To be or not to be? 
To fly or not to die, 
this is my question 
open your golden gates seventh sky, show me my lost Eden 
take my hands and teach me to fly 
sister moon don't leave me alone, show me the stairway 
so I should knock some day to the divine reign
