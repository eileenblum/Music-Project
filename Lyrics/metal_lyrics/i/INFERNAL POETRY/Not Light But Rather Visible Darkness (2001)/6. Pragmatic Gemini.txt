Trough times, throughout the millenniums 
With the birth, of thoughts and religions 
The society, has developed a dualistic conception 
Of the world, of the universe 
Of  the life, of what's around  me, 
you, us.
Two sides, for any medals 
Bipolar, male and female 
Personalities, limited by this bi-conception 
Of the world, of the universe 
Of the life, of what's around of me, 
you, us. 
Unwritten law, unspoken rule, 
primal instinct or right intuition, 
what's the solution? 
Standardized vision 
Our mind prison 
Just two opposite poles   
Nevermind, you'll see the way 
As the fate will start for our decay 
When we won't see again this desolation 
In that time, believe me, you 'll discover all! 
There's no white without black 
No grey in our way 
There's no light without dark 
No beauty without horror 
Psycho-limitation, 
wrong direction, no solution, 
just two faces, just two parts, 
mental division: pragmatic gemini. 
.And with the fading of light, 
when skies bow to night, 
I'm the one, I'm the son 
And the prisoner of my thoughts 
Inestimable gift, 
or cause for not to sleep, 
my dreams, my whishes 
my will to know what's the truth beyond 

strange mind, my mind 
when it thinks what you never think 
strange eyes, my eyes 
when they see what you never see 
.and sometimes, 
two of these opposite parts melt, 
generating a life.
