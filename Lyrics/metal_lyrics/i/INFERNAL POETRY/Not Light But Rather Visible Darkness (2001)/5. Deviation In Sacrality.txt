Pain's bleeding through your eyes
Your sufferings are so divine
Cleanse your soul to God 
Your empty flesh will burn into purity of fire 
Confess your sins to Christ 
Your screams of pain I hear with joy 
Expel your putrid life 
Our lord of mercy forgives who survives 

Torments reveal your lies 
Your knowledge curses your life 

Subversive practices of thoughts damn you 
Satan's speaking through your mouth 
In heresy you'll die 

Burning the fire starts to clean your soul
Bleeding your blood will wash your sin away
Screaming under the sign of holy cross 
Praying under the altar you denied 

Words that shown yourself insane 
You should have never said 
Covenant signed in blood 
The life spirit support our crusade to erase 
Confront your soul to God 
In his higher name we judge 
Life is in our hands 
Repent to Christ and die delighted for your end

Torments reveal your lies
Your knowledge curses your life
