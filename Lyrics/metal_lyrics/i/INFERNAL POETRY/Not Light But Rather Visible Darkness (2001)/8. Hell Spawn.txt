What am I? Trapped in this infernal body
Raped of all - was joy in my mortal life 
Back from abyss - to return as I was 
Strange dimension - I am not myself 

Betrayed by friends, engaged by demons - returned to life 
After years passed since disease - I hope myself to die again 
Transformed in a horrible creature - soldier of hell 
Emotions vortex possesses my soul - good and evil I confuse 

Returned to life  with immense powers, Forged by hell 
Narrow capacities to use them, at the and I'll be back to Inferno 
I can't ignore the troubles of weak, my new life will end faster 
I can't support for my mortality I can't sustain remorse 

Where's my soul 
I'm hell spawn 

What am I? contested between hell and heaven 
Raped of all left only with remembrances 
Back from abyss to conquer my revenge 
Strange dimension Can't be back to normalcy
