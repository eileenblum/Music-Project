Born from your brain, sucking blood from your veins
I'm your own God 
Hollow inside, filled with your thoughts 
I'm your own God 

I was the not being, you gave me form 
Your own form, your own soul 
I'm your own God 

You wrote laws, ancient rules of stone 
Your own laws, your own rules 
I'm your own God 

All the gates are locked by the keys 
You gave me through  the centuries 
All my emptiness has been filled with your faith 

In my name you killed, in the name of lord 
In the name of the human race 
In my name you crucified 

Your mortality is my eternity 
I'm your own god
