Lord, ancient father
Dissolve the mist 
Bring the light 
Forgive my life 

My wan life 
Wasn't what they talk me (about) 
Serve : born to serve 
In glory and decay 
Give me back my form 
My drab form 
You blew my will away 
Chains- your divine chains 
Eternal cross on me 

Give me back my form, I will reborn 
Put your string down and let me exist 

Beyond the endless time, of eternal will and being 
Just a grain in the desert sand till my reign will be complete 
Winds of fire blows below, as my whispers shapes a life 
As the human memories they are doomed to die 

Why did you call me son? 
Why slowly wither and die? 
Why have  I only been praying? 
Why  did I build up your reign? 

Lord you called me son 
You choose my choice 
Extirpate my eyes
