Have you ever met a poisoned mind?
As the tree hides his gloomy half in cold wormed ground,
so we show the whitened part of ourselves,
hiding the darkest perverse part lying in us
but the root vile, unpure, is for the plant a source of life
Awaken from the longest sleep
Illusion we call love
Altered ego, a new way of vision
A change started in my eyes
Welcome to my darkest world
Idiot, perverse, cynic!
but I don't think I'm worse than you
Walking in front of me shapes of flesh
Sorry... not flesh but meat
Ready for the dirtiest dinner
A milk-thirst satisfied in blood
And every kind of human liquids
'til nausea and disgust
The flesh you wear, tender meat slow-cooked on my bed..
Carnivorous, the animal I am
dance with me
Soiling the immaculate
Awaken from the longest sleep
Illusion we call love
Altered ego, a new way of vision
A change started in my eyes
The flesh you wear, tender meat slow-cooked on my bed..
Carnivorous, the animal I am
