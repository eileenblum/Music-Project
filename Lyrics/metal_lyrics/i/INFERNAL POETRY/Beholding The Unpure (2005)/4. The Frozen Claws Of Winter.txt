I, the darkest flower, broken, left to dry
Can't breathe this burning ice
I, with fear in the eyes, left to cry
My heart's bit becomes so slow
Revenge of winter, the unsaid supremacy
I'm naked before this power
The dark is near, grey is here, no more sun
I'm dead before I die
A paralysing cold to the bones?
We're falling down, in the frozen claws of winter
Flaws the blood, piercing ice blades from the sky
White, wet cold snow freeze my lost soul
Subzero reset emotions
No ray of light cannot solve the iceberg I've got inside
I'm dead before I die
We're falling down, in the frozen claws of winter
Flaws the blood, piercing ice blades from the sky
Summer lies in a dark red ground
Shaped by thousands autumn's dry leaves
The end is carried by the terrifying screams
Of the northern winds
Now that my time is over
I will sleep in my ice grave
Inside the ancient glacier
Far from the noises of the world
Waiting for the spring to returns?
My heart bit becomes so slow?
I, the darkest flower, broken, left to dry
I, with fear in the eyes, left to cry
My heart's bit becomes so slow
We're falling down, in the frozen claws of winter
Flaws the blood, piercing ice blades from the sky
