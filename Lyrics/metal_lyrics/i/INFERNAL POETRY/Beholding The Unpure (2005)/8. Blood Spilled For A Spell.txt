Teary lips darkened by livid thoughts
Cold blade shines, sweet caress to despise
Rip skin is opened, in red water cut
life's lymph now falls, dark tragedy written in only one act
Shroud blood spilled like tears of cry the last one, the real one, the last one, the real one?
Bloodbath to erase these desperate eyes (please God forgive me)
Self termination forbidden sacrifice
Blood spilled for a spell, the evil spell of suicide (please God forgive me)
Blood spilled for a spell, the fatal spell of suicide
In red water
Cut, bye troubled life
No more false dreams to cry for?
Bloodbath to erase these desperate eyes (please God forgive me)
Self termination forbidden sacrifice
Blood spilled for a spell, the evil spell of suicide (please God forgive me)
Blood spilled for a spell, the fatal spell of suicide
Broken veins are vomiting the last light
Teary bed for the eternal sleep
No pain, no life, no days, no nights
Slow beats for the rhythm of tired heart song
The agonizing body loses soul, slowly
Any drop of the hopeless truth, is raining now, is falling now
Teary lips darkened by livid thoughts
Cold blade shines, sweet caress to despise?
The agonizing body loses soul, slowly
Any drop of the hopeless truth, is raining now, is falling now
In red water
Cut, bye troubled life
No more false dreams to cry for?
Bloodbath to erase these desperate eyes (please God forgive me)
Self termination forbidden sacrifice
Blood spilled for a spell, the evil spell of suicide (please God forgive me)
Blood spilled for a spell, the fatal spell of suicide
Red
Frost
Senseless
the last one, the real one, the last one, the real one!
