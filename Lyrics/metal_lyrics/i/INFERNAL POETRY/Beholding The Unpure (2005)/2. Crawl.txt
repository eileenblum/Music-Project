"So we crawl
No matter what you think now"
Lying-in bitch spits out bodies, first breath's a cry
Sucking sperm from her tits, the ever-pregnant mother of mankind
Born alone, die alone, stench of ground
where we come from and we'll return
Change your skin and crawl
Since first cry to last word
Reset your will to be, shut up and crawl
Kill your fantasies, licking prayers just with your forked tongue
Born alone, die alone, stench of ground
where we come from and we'll return
Change your skin and crawl
Since first cry to last word
Change your skin and crawl
Since first cry to last word
Creeping through this world
Eating shit just like worms
I'm crawling through perversions
Creeping on my passions
Please don't try this at home
Gotta crawl yeah
Fear of my consciousness
1-2-3-4 face down
The absolution of every sin
Great redemption definitive
Is a butterfly I've never seen
Change your skin and crawl
Since first cry to last word
Creeping through this world
Eating shit just like worms
