Free
Under the moonshine You don't feel sick
You watch the others in dark decay
You killed your own shade You feel alive
You have no desires
(No my dear)
Spit
spit out the dirtiest ancient sin
You broke your chains
You feel alive
You have no desires
(No my dear,
I'm right here,
feed my breath
I always lay beneath)
Your temptation is my delight
You can feel it crawling inside
You got your soul
I got your flesh
I got your life
keep on struggling
but never show your sufferings
You pray for soul
but You live for flesh
your flesh
my flesh
I'm here
The inner one who never dies
I rule rejected in your eyes
The most forbidden among desires
(I always lay beneath...)
You are sick inside

Confess
You can't resist and you can't rest
You are like the others in dark decay
You are your own shade
this is desire
and you are alive
(Yes my dear
I'm right here
feed my breath
I always lay beneath)
Your temptation
is my delight
You feel it crawling inside
You got your soul
I got your flesh
I got your life
keep on struggling
but deny to show your sufferings
You pray for you soul
but You live for flesh
your flesh
my flesh
I'm here
The inner one who never dies
I rule reflected in your eyes
The most forbidden among desires
Believe
in my unspoken words
Drawn
in your forbidden thoughts
(Sorry friend I'm always here
Behold your shadow it's so real)
