[Iron Maiden cover]

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night, or strolling through the park

When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark ,Fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, Fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you.

Fear of the dark ,Fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, Fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
