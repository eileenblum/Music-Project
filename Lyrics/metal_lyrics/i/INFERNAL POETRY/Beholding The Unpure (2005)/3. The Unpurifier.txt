Thirsty... self-generated, by your filthy thought and hate
The ugliness, the chosen one, the dirty insanity you've inside
As you spit in my face, as you blacken my name
You turn clean, you feel clean
Feeding of your own smile, light-sucker from your eyes
I am the horrid you repulse, the leprosy that you despise,
Freak, crust, a poisonous dust,
The Unpurifier who makes you blind
Which one is my shape? The ones you're afraid of?
Like the light needs the night and Satan needs a God
You need me to exist
Feeding of your own smile, light-sucker from your eyes
I am the horrid you repulse, the leprosy that you despise,
Freak, crust, a poisonous dust,
The Unpurifier who makes you blind
I painted in black my skin, to let yours shine much more
A scary dismal silhouette, mine's the mirror of vain beauty
The celebration of carnival is near
Just wear of your madness, come laughing with me
Fill-in the streets with dwarfs and freaks
Despising our beauty, just say: trick or treat
Thirsty... self-generated, by your filthy thought and hate
The ugliness, the chosen one, the dirty insanity you've inside
As you spit in my face, as you blacken my name
You turn clean, you feel clean
Feeding of your own smile, light-sucker from your eyes?
I am the horrid you repulse, the leprosy that you despise,
Freak, crust, a poisonous dust,
The Unpurifier who makes you blind
