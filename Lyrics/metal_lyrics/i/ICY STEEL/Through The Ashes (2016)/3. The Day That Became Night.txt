There was a day
When the sun became black
Nobody expected that the light
Could become shadow
Yet that day
The day became night

All the people saw
Looks to the sky
Ready to see the inevitable
And avoid what is not yet seen
At the moment
The silence

He spoke of an ancient prophecy
Oldest trees
Told of a sudden darkness
A divine punishment
The prophecy seemed to come true
When the light ceased to shine

And then suddenly
Black wrapped the light
They were the gods
Who wanted the end of everything?
They were the gods
Who wanted the end of everything?

And then suddenly
Black wrapped the light
They were the gods
Who wanted the end of everything?

Of everything
