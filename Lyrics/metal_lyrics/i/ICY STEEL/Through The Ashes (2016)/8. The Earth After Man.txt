Desert!
Nothing comes to life
Watching!
Watching!
The land is like the sky
Screaming!
Screaming!
The silence cuts the sound
Running!
Never seems to arrive

All!
All!

All is great and far away

Small!
Small!
I'm fell small and I don't know the way

Alone!
Alone!
I am alone in this place
The stone!
The stones!
Come from the space

Like the wind that moves the dust
These dead trees moving my eyes
Clouds embrace the boundless space
And in all this I feel a soft grace

Creation!
Creation!

A very distant word
Ablution!
Ablution!
This is the real world

Inside me!
Inside me!
Something tells me that is not true

Indeed!
Indeed!
The man is no longer here

Everything has rebelled man
Strangely I do not feel more at home
