I live the life of crazy
I know where I come from
But I don't know who I am
I am the eyes of a blind
And the evidence for those
Who don't want to see

I look to the stone
I look to the sky
I look to the earth
You ready to die?

The power of born
Is great but today
The power of death
Strike on tonight

I draw the power from the ground
I know what's hidden inside him
I grip on the air
And the power of the unknown

Spit fire!
I predict victory for you
Many cities will fall at the feet of a king
Because they say the stones

Pain!
Pain!
Pain!
Pain!

This is the end in this world
By your hand he die!
And for glory you ride
I scream for you into the fight!
This is the end in this world
By your end he die!
And for glory you ride

Scream for me!
We go on fight!

Spit fire!
I predict victory for you
Many cities will fall at the feet of a king
Because they say the stones
