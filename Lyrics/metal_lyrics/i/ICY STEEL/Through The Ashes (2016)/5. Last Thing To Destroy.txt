I see black wind
Not see my home

I have lost all
My hand is weak
I cannot use
More I get and more I'm confused

I feel inside me
That can fight this black wind
I have to get up
I have to resist

The force in my hand
It came at the end
But now that my heart
Must continue to beat

In this epic way
I want to win
I do not want fall
It's high, that I want to stay

My fear is so great
My eyes are filled with tear
And now I do not even feel my fist

I feel inside me
That can fight this black wind
I have to get up
I have to resist

The force in my hand
It came at the end
But now that my heart
Must continue to beat

...and here is against me
I'm the last thing to destroy

I fight him standing
With the darkness that
Surrounds me

Ventus!
Tenebris!
Ignis!
Solus!
Pugna!
Finis!

I feel inside me
That can fight this black wind
I have to get up
I have to resist

The force in my hand
It came at the end
Forever my heart
Continue to live!
