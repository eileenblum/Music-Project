Feeling the fire onto my skin
Knowing the taste of ground, stars and sea
Searching my spirit through scars made by sins
Walking this road no wishes and dreams

I found poetry in delicate sound
My mind flying silence around
In my solitude I can see the flame
Nothing to lose no one to blame
All that surrounds me speaks without words
Come through the land of the silence
You will find your soul

The sound of pureness
The voice of time
Come through the land of the silence
You will know your mind
