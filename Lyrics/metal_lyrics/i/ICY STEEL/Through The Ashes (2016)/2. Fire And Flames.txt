You must be really bad today
We did not own
To escape? It's too late now!
Now take what comes!

You will not find any grace
Only a sad end
Is your worst day today
And will be for my hand

Flames!
Fire and flames!
I can destroy you

Flames!
Fire and flames!
I have so much fire for you

You'll have to put up with something that really weights
Action and reaction
Someday you'll think about what was bad and strong
Screaming and crying

Flames!
Fire and flames!
I have so much fire for you

Flames!
Fire and flames!
I can destroy you

You'll have to put up with something that really burn
Action and reaction
Someday you'll think about what was bad and slow
Screaming and crying

Fire!
And flames!
Fire!
And flames!

Fire!
