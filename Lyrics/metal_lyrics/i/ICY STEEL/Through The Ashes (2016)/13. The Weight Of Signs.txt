I see my way
By carrying the weight of signs
Fate brings me here
In the place where
Rest is denied

Lies in my hands
The sweetness of innocence
Flows through my chest
The hermit's wisdom

Rivers and trees
The green ray in the twilight
Freedom is my dream
And love is a mystery
And tonight I lost myself
Carrying the weight of signs
Oh, I surrender
Is this my life?

Peace may come
In this sanctuary of waiver
My throne is empty
My words are silent
