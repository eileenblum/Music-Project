...and warriors
Returned from their wives
Warriors of the world
That nothing has given to it
But that a lot must

Defeats in a battle
Lost in beginning
Kidnapped from their
Sense of pride
They did not pour a tear
But much blood

Blood!
Too much blood!
Scattered on the stone
Stolen to the soul

Blood!
Too much blood!
Scattered on the stone
Stolen to the soul

Because that victory is a condition
But knowing how to rise is a divine gift!

Because that victory is a condition
But knowing how to rise is a divine gift!

Because that victory is a condition
But knowing how to rise is a divine gift!

Because that victory is a condition
But knowing how to rise is a divine gift!

In this war today
I fight the pain
To sleep in this black night
I want forget

The memory call me
I can to see it

The memory of past
Where I'm dead

But the values are in feet
Few like the eagles
To the world
Made of glory
More strong than before

Because that victory is a condition
But knowing how to rise is a divine gift!
