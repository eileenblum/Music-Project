I have so much time
I savor every breath
Thinking about tomorrow
The window looks out on the world
And I am a witness
As time goes by slowly
Today the rain falls

I still have time
The air is as intense as my thoughts
Who flock merging together
The window is the only thing
That separates me from the rest
Of the world
I can open it but I prefer to look

Because today the rain falls
I can float in the air
Because I am part of it
The window is no more my prison
But my escape

I have few time
The breath is heavy
Because now the air is heavy as water
And I'm drowning
This window imprisons me
And sadistic torture me

With a world that will go on
Without me
And today the rain falls

I have no more time
I cannot breathe
I do not need more
I can float in the air
Because I am part of it
The window is not my prison
But my escape
I realized that despite death
Life goes on
And today the rain cries

I realized
Despite death
Life goes on
And today the rain cries
