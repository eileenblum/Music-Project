I can't see the pathway
I can't follow the stars
In the mist I'm riding, the place is far
Looking for an answer I found a war

They come to kill me
They won't live me alone
I must fight my anxiety and defend my soul

Hiding my weaknesses to their eyes
Will come the day when I'll see
The demons die!

There's no time for rest now
The enemy is still on my trails
Until the end I will fight
I will prevail

Trying to survive without losing my mind
Will come the day when I'll see
The demons die!

Until the end I will fight
I will prevail
Trying to survive without losing my mind
Will come the day when I'll see
The demons die!
