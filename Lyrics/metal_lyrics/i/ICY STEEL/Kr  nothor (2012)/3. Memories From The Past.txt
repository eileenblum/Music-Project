White beard of an old
Echoes of archaic odors
Grow in me
I have not always lived
But I was there

Sometimes rust is a virtue
Offers wisdom
Look at the world
Through the eyes of someone
Who knows to know

I close my hand
Within me the fire of the past
The past of a man
I've never met but I am

Yes, I am a warrior
Lived long ago
I have no memory of this
But my heart keeps reminding me

A rock crumbled
That's how I feel
Pieces of memories
From a huge menhir

I close my hand
Within me the fire of the past
The past of a man
I've never met but I am

I close my hand
Within me the fire of the past
The past of a man
I've never met but I am

Yes, I am a warrior
Lived long ago
I have no memory of this
But my heart keeps reminding me

A rock crumbled
That's how I feel
Pieces of memories
From a huge menhir
