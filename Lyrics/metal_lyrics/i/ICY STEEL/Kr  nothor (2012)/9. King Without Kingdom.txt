You are a drop in a lake
Full of things not yours
You think to be a lion
But who barks doesn't bite

You try to scare
Your image in the mirror
You are a sick vein
The reflex of anyone

Your are a king without kingdom
With a crown of paper
Like a king without kingdom
Proud of nothing that he possesses

You are a king without kingdom
With a crown of paper
Like a king without kingdom
Forever you will stay!

You have the experience of a god
And the wisdom of a king
But experience
Is not created by talk

You are the ugliness of Aphrodite
And intelligence of fool
You are a wooden sword
Supported by a knight of plastic

Your are a king without kingdom
With a crown of paper
Like a king without kingdom
Forever you will stay!

Like a king without kingdom
Forever you will stay!
