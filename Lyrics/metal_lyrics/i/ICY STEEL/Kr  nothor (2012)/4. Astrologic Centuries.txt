Echoes from the future
Come in group
A journey in time
To tell you

...And you gather the premonitions
Hidden truth
Apocalypse, killings
Nothing new!

...And you gather the premonitions
Hidden truth
Apocalypse, killings, prophecies
Written in the stars

The era is far away
But the message is strong
Nothing goes lost
Importance to everything

In the act of a vision
You tell a dark future
You can't ignore them
It's your duty on this earth
You are alone!

Echoes from the future
Come in group!
And the messenger
Are you!

...And you gather the premonitions
Hidden truth
Apocalypse, killings, prophecies
Written in the stars!
