You are down
Are you the bottom
You do not know how to react
Lost forever
Betrayed

Can not
Not want
And you don't now
But in some way
You must go on

Slam! Scream! Breaks all!
You are only one
The hope is hard
Follow the flag!

You are hard
Like the steel
You cannot fall

You make to see
How much goes
Not win the others
You kill them all
Kill them all
You still win

Slam! Scream! Breaks all!
You are only one
The hope is hard
Follow the flag!

I see fire in your eyes
Follow the flag!
