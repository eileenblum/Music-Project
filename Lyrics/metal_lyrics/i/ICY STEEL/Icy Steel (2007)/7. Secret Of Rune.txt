In the land of the Vikings
Sleeps the secret of rune
Tied of eternal past
Beads of sweat from the forehead
One god
Arcane signs sculptured of stone
For a warrior is how return to home

The uncontested king of the world has decided...
The people of the north demanded their
God in battle
But his strength was immense
You have to divide him between his children
For nine nights hung to the ash always
Exposed at the winds
And then it put on the frozen earth the runes...
Every symbol loaded is of the courage
Of the strength, of the spirit...

Of the god between the Vikings!
