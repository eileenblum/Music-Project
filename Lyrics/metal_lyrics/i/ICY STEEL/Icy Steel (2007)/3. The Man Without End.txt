Fight on the battleground
Both legions fight without truce
Nobody represents an advantage
For now the balance doesn't hang

The swords are tall
And the instinct prevails
Life has too much value
Too much!

Advance rider, black rider
He avenges the pain that you have tried
Executing who still provokes it

Bashful and old look of centuries
Of whom eras he has seen
And of who nothing he doesn't fear
Except his past

Everything is firm
Nothing is standing
Where a man triumphs
What he doesn't know is... death

The man without end
