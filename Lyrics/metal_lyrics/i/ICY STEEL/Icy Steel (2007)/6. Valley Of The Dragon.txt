The night following my trip
Fantastic end spell bound
Between the thousand
Creatures of the wind

Stately wings are explained
To the search of the lost liberty
They go toward the horizon
Toward a world
That doesn't belong them

In the darkness the soul trembles
Deadly eye cannot see
And she will ever know truth
Lost place in the dark
I feel cold in the soul

When all keeps silent
Is the time of the fables
Other horizons attend them
To cradle the dream
