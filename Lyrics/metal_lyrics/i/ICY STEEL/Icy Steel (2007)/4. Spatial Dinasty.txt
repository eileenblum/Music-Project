In your eyes ice king
The glare of the dark age
Resound of swords
And bloodsheds

This world is cold and dark
Without end and quiet
For this you call to you
The power of the space dynasty

Planets and stars accompany you in
An infernal dance
This is the kingdom
Of lost empire

Over the confinement
Of the space and of the time
They play again acute
Your eternal battle
