There was once a noble commander
To become blood has poured him
He has won over two hundred wars,
Atrocious,
But his destiny changed is
When his name became God...

Darkened by the wealth
He let die his own people
On the banks of a murderous river,
He made some deception his own strength
And his sword reaped dead bodies...

Oooh merciless servant!
Oooh fervent king!
Oooh laughing head!
What end has made your honor!

Oooh merciless servant!
Oooh fervent king!
Oooh laughing head!
Lets want your pride!

We have suffered to sufferings
Why to melt in tears
In front of your avid armor?
Us all we knew that you were a
Noble commander
But now, that your soul corrupted is
We die for your weakness...

Oooh merciless servant!
Oooh fervent king!
Oooh laughing head!
What end has made your honor!

Oooh merciless servant!
Oooh fervent king!
Oooh laughing head!
Lets want your pride!

He remembers, the honor consists
Of the courage
Not in the blood!
Not in the blood!
