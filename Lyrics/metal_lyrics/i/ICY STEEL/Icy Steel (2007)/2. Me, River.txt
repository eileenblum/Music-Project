I saw him one day to walk I place
Side by side to my banks
Between the hands he held a sword
I changed my course

And I started following him
His look told me of him
His heart don't find peace
Lost between my arms

And he started telling is history
Left all to follow his destiny
He was directed between the mountains
To wait the night

Without fear he raced
Between the blades

The destiny has brought him from me
To cross a trip without end
His soul now is in peace
He sleeps calm inside of me
