Legend!
I want to become
With many battles won

Screaming!
I'm going to war
Bright and strong like the dawn
On my horse with the wind at my backâ¦

My falcon flies
My face to the sky
My feet on dry land
I look to the horizon and close my hand

I was born in the fire
You can't escape me
I follow the trails
One by one

I'm coming!
The battle has come!
I've chosen my way
The land does call me
Always

I will ride on my wind horse
I will be rotten to the core
Always, always, alwaysâ¦

I draw strength from my fears
I don't have time to cry
My faithful horses always near

To try, riding the wind
To bring the horizon to me

I've chosen my way
The land does call me
Always

I will ride on my wind horse
I will be rotten to the core
Always, always, alwaysâ¦
