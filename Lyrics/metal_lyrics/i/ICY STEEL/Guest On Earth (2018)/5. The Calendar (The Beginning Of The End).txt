We can't do anything about it
Now the scriptures speak to me
I would like to say no
Now that is written will be done

There will be no warriors
In this war
There will be people
To fight the nature's force
Ages!
Many eras will pass
Deadly!
They will be days of trust

Humanity will see the fire of the earth
All of this will test their hearts

There will be no warriors
In this war
There will be people
To fight the nature's force

Calendar
Is carved in stone
Its words
Vibrate through bones
The calendar
Is carved in stone
Its words
Vibrate through bones
With sacrifice

We will not stop fate
Nobody will fight
The cure will be the change
Ahpuch!
Give them a worthy end
They're just guilty
Of being alive!

There will be no warriors
In this war
There will be people
To fight the nature's force
