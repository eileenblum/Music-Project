I'm testing my pain
I feel it in my veins
Like a lion in a cage
I am always ready

Lonely until the end
I can do nothing else
I won't run away from evil
I'm not afraid

To live
Or die!
Glory
For me!

For a long time
I've been training hard
With body and mind
At the service of the empire

Sweat, pain and rules
For a long time
I'm ready to die
For glory and for the empire

Now I warm up my hand
All the strength must be mine
The moment has come
It's time to fight

Now I'll leave my ego
The war is divine
This war is not mine
I do it for the empire!

Warrior
Warrior for me!
'Cause it is warrior
Warrior, warrior
Warrior fight for me!

Imperium
Belli gloria
Pugna
Gloriam
Semper
