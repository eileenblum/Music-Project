Great spirit,
Have pity on me.
I am pray and I want to live.
I pray with this chanupa

With every day I hear the echo of my name
With pride I rise from the highest mountain
I'm flying eagle â hair blowing in the wind
The winter breeze caresses my face

In every day I hear the echo of my name
Proud I rise from the highest mountain
The flying eagle. My hair in the wind
The light wind caresses my face

Desire
To be an eagle

This open prairie
The very earth it knows me
Many moons I slept alone there
I am one with the land that lies before me
Ancestors whisper my name
The bear, the wolf, the snake, my brother spirits
Standing proud by my side
But I alone take to the sky
My wings take me there

Spirit of the eagle
Listen to my prayer
And touch my hand
Tell me if I'm ready
Give me strength
To fly by your side

Eagle fly again on this mountain
I'll be there waiting for you
Be waiting for you
Waiting for youâ¦
