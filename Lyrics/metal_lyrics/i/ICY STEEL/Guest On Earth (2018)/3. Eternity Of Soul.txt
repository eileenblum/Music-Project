Heaven
Heaven of soul
The end of the days!
I come from a war
That I fight with myself!
I guess I'm coming home
With my spaceship made of stone
Yes, I still grow
With my prayer!

The death is my life today
All I did it has been done
These bands will take me away
No regrets, where Horus reigns
â¦again!

Dealer
Dealer of souls
I can not stay
Like sand I fly away
Only bones will remain
Yes, now I'm coming home
Through time and space

I'm ready to go
In the eternity of soul!

The death is my life today
All I did it has been done
These bands will take me away
No regrets, where Horus reigns
â¦again!

Dealer of heaven!
