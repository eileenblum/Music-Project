Here they are
They appear before us!
The clouds
Shall move on their arrival

Big ships
They do not sail, they fly!
No rain
But there are lightning everywhere!

Silent screams
In the divine show
What do they want?
We don't know

So much gold
This is what they want
They need them
For their flying boats

They said
We are your gods!
And therefore
You must give us all your gold!

Silent screams
In the divine show
What do they want?
We don't know

In this kind of fear
We love this blame
The blame to be
In front of the gods

Inside us
It's growing strong
The desire
To please the gods!

Here they are
They appear before us!
The clouds
Shall move on their arrival

Big ships
They do not sail, they fly!
No rain
But there are lightning everywhere!

Silent screams
In the divine show
What do they want?
We don't know
