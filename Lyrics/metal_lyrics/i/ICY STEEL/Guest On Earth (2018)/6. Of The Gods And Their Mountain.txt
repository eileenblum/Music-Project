Greece has seen
Many die
Many win
And many escape
Eventually
A voice from above
Spreading far
"The floor to the gods!"
Yeah!

Powerful entities
That dominate the world
Powerful entities
That dominate the world
Zeus, Ares, Hades
And the other mighty gods
Carved in stone
If you don't like
This mortal world
Then climb the mountain
And talk to the oracle

â¦if you don't like
This mortal world
â¦if you don't like!

Good and evil
Stronger than the night
Beyond the earth
And beyond the clouds
Yeah!

There was a time
Where everything was divine
Earth, wind and sky
Everything was a divine guide
