Give me the light
And weight in hand
All men at my command
With the powerful wind of winter
That Odin has sent

We are men of steel
The prophecy will
Make our dreams come true

We have wood skin
The fire within
Valhalla we'll arrive soon

Yes we'll have a great end
Thanks to Mjollnir's strikes
Everyone will bend
We are not afraid to die!

It seems to me that I have everything
All the gods are with me
I feel the power in my veins
It seems to me that I have everything
The stone spoke to me
Vikings are here!

I'm looking for fear
To give courage to my friends
The hot iron and blood
Stepping on my chest

We'll give ourselves a great end
With axes, shields and studs
We fly with dragon ships
Thor's strength is with me!

It seems to me that I have everything
All the gods are with me
I feel the power in my veins
It seems to me that I have everything
The stone spoke to me
Vikings are here!
