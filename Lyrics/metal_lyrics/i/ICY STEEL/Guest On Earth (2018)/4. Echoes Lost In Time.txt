I fell into the eye, the eye of the storm
Time will decide if I win this war
Then I try every way
To connect with the past

From the magic of the night
I let the memory begin
In these lands the fight
She was proud and grim
I feel the fire
That burns inside me
Closing your eyes
I hear the druids scream

Echoes far away
Lost in space and time
In the ancient human desire
Again, to feel alive

I feel the power of the gods!
I feel the heat of the rock
I hear the shocks on the ground!
I am lost over time
I died twice
I carry the weight of the signs
But in peace with my mind

Everything, always, infinity
I feel courage in the air
Hearing the swords on the shields
I'm not afraid of death!

Echoes far away
Lost in space and time
In the ancient human desire
Again, to feel alive

In this echo
I heard a call
Ancient and far
But present and strong

Tears of ice
In the cold northern wind
Refresh my face
And warm up my heart

My hair
Is lulled by gentle breeze
Discovering my face
And my eyes

Now I feel alive
With the weight of memory
And I cry
Now I live!
