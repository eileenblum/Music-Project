Nobody's land
So they called it
Inhabited by people
Of remote provenance
Lost in the Mediterranean
With seas, rivers and lakes
With those inhabitants
Fortress builders

They venerate the stone
As a divine power
Building with wisdom
Their great towers

Oh, their winds
They are really strong
Oh, their trees
They are very old
Send away the evil
With old formulas
Of proud women
As strong as men

Welcome to the stranger
With great cordiality
But with courage and pride
They fight the enemy
They will stay here
Forever and again
Like old trees
Against the four winds

They venerate the stone
As a divine power
Building with wisdom
Their great towers
With their pride
They look beyond the sea
Watching everyone arrive
Without fear!
