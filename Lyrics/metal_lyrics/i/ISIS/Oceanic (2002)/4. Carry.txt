And the water takes hold
Fills his lungs and crushes his body

Dust floats through sun and water
As you draw close
Fall to me
He sees like his never seen before
I will carry you
True and free

And the water carries him away
Now that you are here
You'll swim with me
Soon he ceases to be at all
I am clutching you
True

He sees like he never sees before
He is light in water
