The great stone walls
Rise above our heads,
Cold and sad
Pale light, a dusty veil

The sun makes its way in
Destitute, weak
You're at my side again
Faithful guide unfailing,
Here we stand among the others
The living among the dead

Veins still flowing full
Lungs filled with white light

Push forward
Lifeless bodies swept aside
They are on us
Cast a net of armor
Over our heads
Hide our life
Lest it be lifted from us

We must leave this place
Of deathly decay

Don't look back, press on
