[Bonus on Japanese release]

He and I
Seek the silent
Halfway through
Beneath

Traveling in
The woven
Branches of
Another world

Got to hall ending
Step from the living trees
My trial now
Let come to pass
He and I
On a silent path

This is
The way we know
We go on

This is the hope
Woven branches
Falling
Take our weights

I see this
Down this way
A place

So it comes to pass
We go our separate ways
A solitary course
To a place of rest

Passing through the
Golden grey
This is the way
The only way

On a course
Bring them to
Our place of rest
