If only I could
Clear my eyes
Then I might breathe once more
Then I might breathe again

Old sun and stars,
And oceans below me
Guide my strides over
Jagged shards, under foot

Old sun and stars,
And oceans below me
Guide my strides over
Jagged shards, under foot

To slash to the sound
How many sit on woe or peril?
How many walk on their own?

Into the truth
Let myself burn
Now it's written
1000 shards
