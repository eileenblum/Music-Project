The divine mother stumbles
Cancer wrapped around her heart
The eyes of gods kept

Infect fingers pry open the clearest cages
Sickness has been made

Father and sons
Stoic fire
Sisters tears protect
There is no fear
The eyes of god kept

Measures have been taken

Wipe clean my face
Rip clear my heart
Death must seem so distant
That reach has not reached me:
