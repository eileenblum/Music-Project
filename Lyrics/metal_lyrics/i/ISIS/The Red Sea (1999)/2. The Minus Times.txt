[partial word version]

Minus
It's the minus times
Minus times

Bitter serum and sting rays
Breathe in water through the punctured throat
Scars like rope
Cold to the touch
Crash is the wish
Shards in our eyes
Hands around the throat
Caffeine in my veins
Coals from your mouth
Blisters on your tongue
