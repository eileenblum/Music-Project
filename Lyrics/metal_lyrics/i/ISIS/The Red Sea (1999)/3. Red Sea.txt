Heat seeps in holes
Heat seeps in souls

Sweat soaked yellow shroud
Breathless protection
Daggers where the eyes should be
Blood running down your cheeks

Eyes in black suns direction
Feet burning insects stinging

Sweat soaked yellow shroud
Breathless protection
Daggers where the eyes should be
Blood running down your cheeks

Begin
Inject
Remove
The point

The ocean spreads beneath the skin
Fluid fills blackened lungs
Tar seeps across the eyes
Away in the sea of red
