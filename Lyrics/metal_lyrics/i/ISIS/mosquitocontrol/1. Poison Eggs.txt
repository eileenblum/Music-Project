The Revisionist's death by her own hand:
Poison egg, the implement.
I am chest deep in her swarm.
Poison egg, reverse swallowed.

I see them seething between her fingers,
She sets them free,
I bleed me.

The Revisionist's death by her own hand:
Poison egg, the implement.
I am chest deep in her swarm.
Poison egg, reverse swallowed.

Blood flowing;
No clotting;
Flowing faster;
The swarm is feeding.

DEFEAT. DEFEAT.

[2x]
You would look so magnificent,
Crawling on those bloodied knees.
The swarm is flocking to the wound,
Their speed only matched by their efficiency.

Glory is relative to the one that lives in defeat. [2x]

The Revisionist's death by her own hand:
Poison egg, the implement.
I am chest deep in her swarm.
Poison egg, reverse swallowed.

DEFEAT. DEFEAT. DEFEAT. DEFEAT.
