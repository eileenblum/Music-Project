I can't see:
Eyes swelled with stings

I can't breathe:
Lungs filled with the bitter venom

The nest is collapsing upon itself.

[Chorus]
This isn't over...
In fact, it's just begun.
Hive destruction imminent,
Cover your face and run.

Lies are falling.
Lies fall from wings.
The walls are seething...
Seething with disease...

[repeat chorus]

The drone is deafening,
From the malcontent swarm.
Lies from wings are falling.

Blood in rivers runs.
Lies from wings fall.

Hive destruction.
