Smiling widows dancing all around my grave
Holding my heart in their hands
deadly eagles you once just considered
part of your life and your fate

[Pre:]
But now is time to stand
far from the voices that push you down again
Hate must fill your veins
preparing your soul
stand in the hole without shame

[Chorus:]
Rage from the dust I belong
fire from ashes again
the Phoenix is rising alone
all by myself

[Solo]

Cradle fellows you have planted in your chest
growing with masks in their face
Nasty felons who donât care if you are dead
spreading their roots through your flesh

[Pre]

[Chorus]
