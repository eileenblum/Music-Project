You are welcome to this nightmare, we dwell since you were lost
We are demons we are angels, don't mind the name you call
With a little beam of light, we can burn your soul

Bloody skulls and rotten flesh lay here, in this hole of death
Mystic symbols on the walls provide horror to our hands
Screaming voices from the dark, falling in the flames

[Pre:]
Fighting won't save you from hell
Time to flow, through the seeds of your evil
We are visions in your head
From the grave, from your inner essence

[Chorus:]
As a miracle, came to you
After years we reach our freedom
We are able now to show your face
Coming visible, not a lie
Now the truth is no more hidden
From the first breath it's been your brain
THE DEMONS LAIR...
