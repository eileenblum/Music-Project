They don't know, they don't care
existence is an evolution
all the past, their mistakes
belong to a memory written in vain
slaves to the graves they are given
why we must think and start looking back?
betrayers of what they are breeding
builders of hell, demons with death in their minds

All my wrath, all my rage
descended to the lands through the centuries
don't know where was my mistake
but I never could put an end to the plague
a thousand of deaths I have sent them
but always survive, seems an immortal race
the victory belongs to the fateless
die with me now, deep down to hell

[Chorus:]
I, I am the Spirit of Earth
you donât hear my cry
though my tears fall down over your heads
through the stormy horizon I ride
since the lands are corrupted by men
'cause the end of the world
lies in their unconscious hands
save a prayer

[Solo]

[Chorus 2x]
