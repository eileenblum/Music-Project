I ride through the rain and thunder, spreading the evil everywhere
since the day when I was born I could kill
I bury them six feet under, enjoy the destruction proudly I make
in the name of god or money who cares

Yeah I put guns in their hands, but the will of firing is inside man

War rides in the sky, over the battlefield, over the heads of your kind
you surely know, that in the end my three brothers will ride by my side
you have been chosen by your crimes, you are the leaders I need for my
plans
guide all the nations to the final stand oohh

I can build out of your hatred, the highest empire youâve ever seen
all I ask of you: I order you kill
so donât expect any future, more virtuous races Iâve destroyed in my way
other planets, other times, the same end

Yeah I put guns in their hands, but the will of firing is inside man

War rides in the sky, over the battlefield, over the heads of your kind
you surely know, that in the end my three brothers will ride by my side
you have been chosen by your crimes, you are the leaders I need for my
plans
guide all the nations to the final stand oohh
