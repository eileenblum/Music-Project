Defeated by your fathers, our conquest must go back
We chose to fight with honor, and our glory was denied
A new dark alliance, purify our minds
She taught us how to ignore the bodies left behind

[Pre:]
Oh, fate in our hands
You can't escape from the storm
We send our men to feed Her

[Chorus:]
I'm coming back
Death will return
In blood we pay the price for burning down you all
She gave us power
She gave us pride
She brought us victory
In Death we trust!!

Don't care about the flesh, sent to climb the walls
The only use we find for them is to save our fist from dust
A few are born to rule over the ones who are born to die
The cattle to the slaughter following our guide

[Pre]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Pre]

[Chorus]
