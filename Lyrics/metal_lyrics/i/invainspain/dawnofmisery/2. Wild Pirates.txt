We left behind the safety of our hometown lands
Our galley is freedom, our only way to face the seasons
The smashing fierce of seas drive us through storms of fate
We fight this painful life, to prove ourselves we can pass thousand hells

The nations' slaving fists strongly hit our way
They call us criminals, malicious thieves and bloody killers
As any rebel will, we're marked with outlaw brand
Pirates are sinners, and we must die with our ideal

[Pre:]
A galleon seeking us appears on the horizon line
Today the booty is get alive to next sunrise
Sables and guns quick to our hands, steel and lead our guides
Can hear the first broadside, roaring in the air

[Chorus:]
For the gold, for the morning daily awakening of a rose
For the chance to keep our freedom far from those who cut our wings
For the friends on this trail, because every single day,
Wild pirates will be fighting at the sea

[Solo]

Save in our bay, the prize of the day
Echoes of battle have gone
Now a cry for the lost, and rum filling throats
Join us and sing with us all
Strong is our heart, but fear comes at last
Think, is it worth bleeding for?
But the wounds have to heal, and they turn us to steel
We give our lives to be free!!!

[Solo]

We welcome one more day with fire in our eyes
Never knew treason, from those we give our trust as equals
Leave all your fears behind and scream with your own voice
Let the wind be your guide, soon the sea is all you hear

[Pre]

[Chorus]
