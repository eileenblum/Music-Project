Seems you never learn, why you always try to get it?
Erase your will, surrender your soul
to the tragedy of life

Like the calm that reigns before the storm,
all the childhood dreams will turn to nightmares
Stars won't shine in real world
so you better wake up dead!!

Did you ever burn in a thousand hells?
that's what is waiting
The heat inside, while you can't move
and they steal your will to live

The destroyer seeks for any mind
with illusion in its rotten future
With might and pride he always fights
any discordant nice day

[Pre:]
You, the dreamer can fight
but the end will break
You, the harder you try
the easier you get to the grave

[Chorus:]
Suffer the morning light, when nothing you had will return
Sunrise destroys the seed of hope you think you own
Day now is darker than nights ever lived
A dream dawn of misery brings

[Solo]

[Pre]

[Chorus 2x]
