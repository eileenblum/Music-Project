Feel the sacred thunder, roaring in my brain
Leaving all behind the call, leads to Jesus every man
Never dreamt of killing, for my God I will
The defence of Holy Land
Pope blessed men, Jerusalem!

Just a simple peasant, riding with his lord
I'm supposed to feel like kings, but I only think of home
I'll destroy what I'll be told, or they'll destroy our creed
Got the devil in their minds, why the hell they think like me?

[Pre:]
Feel the choice, dancing on my soul
An inner voice is telling me that we're all wrong
If pain and death, are the holy word, I'm going home

[Chorus:]
A victim who was blind, leaves the darkness far behind
My salvation is my spirit cannot die
Victory I hold, payment is to walk alone
Now my God has lost a soldier but I've won

A hundred years of murders, forever will remain
Many gave their lives for what? Just a stupid empty faith
Blood and war were our gifts, and so they paid our sins
If any day our gods were real, now they're surely far from here

[Pre]

[Chorus 2x]

[Solo]
