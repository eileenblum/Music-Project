Time runs low, for my own life, the countdown started when I lost his smile
Always been a fighter, but Death was then strong
I couldnÂ´t win, I was no rival, Her scythe took there my son

Flying before walking I was gifted by my blood
Gave my child the same way of life, the Earth was not enough
One day his bird couldn't fly, God let him escape, I only cried
But I just heard his tears going down to ground

[Pre:]
Nothing is as cold as a mother's eyes on you,
telling with no word you are guilty of what she's lost
Time healed her but when she found again the love to give
I just run away, but now I need you here

[Chorus:]
Die in the sea of the endless pain, remorse and sorrow
Ride with no wind, through eternal fields of darkness
Give me wings of steel, and the love you put on me, to make my tomb

[Solo]

They came with their medals and a reward for my lost
A new frontier, a hero mission, the outer space's for you
History will remind your name, death awaits, but you'll prevail
A yes for a so much easy coward way

[Pre]

[Chorus 2x]
