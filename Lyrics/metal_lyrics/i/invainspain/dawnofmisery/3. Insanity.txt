Listen to mindless people, they think they are wise 'cause they act in this show
Blind men taking decisions, as sure they are right as it's proved they are wrong

[Pre:]
Hidden the price we are paying for life, hope is with unbelievers
you know I'm not alone, you'll kill the unicorn if you keep on denying

[Chorus:]
Hear the rising sun, feel the iced fire, now the rain sings strong, and we all are free,
since the day we're born that was our desire, heal this madness with insanity

Don't try to stop our visions, even in prison we can see the truth
living in contradiction, pretending to cure me when you are the fools

[Pre:]
Hidden the price we are paying for life, hope is with unbelievers
the end is in sight the dragon will fly, your time now is over...

[Chorus]

[Solo]
