Here they are acclaiming to the messiah
God bless us and condemn those we kill
The defence of our creed is the alibi
Even though we create our enemies

Thirty men, at the end of a wedding day
Were all killed to prevent their attack
'Cause the strongest History writes
But truth's in the battlefield

Those who lived buried under pure misery
Holding children who just wait to die
They're the enemies we fear at this time
Evil demons with seals for our destiny

Phantoms rides, through the minds of the visionaries
Which have power for burning us all
We don't care about innocent lives
While the guilty ones die in the fight

[Pre:]
Night falls to hold me
She drinks from my wounds thirsty and sad
Turns into mist my wrath

[Chorus:]
Bringers of hell!!
Tyrants always fall first, and you won't prevail
But your shame will be there
Killing hearts in your lands, 'til no one can stand
Because there's no glory, in the pride you sell
Listen cowards, killers, Nightmist comes for you!!

Cleric men, building hells in the memories
Of the ones with no hope for their lives
They are sent just for killing and die
While the masters hide behind their cowardice

Holy words that I read for my own purpose
Are the flames used for burning your soul
While the God who spoke cries for his sons
Immolated in vain they'll be lost

[Pre]

[Chorus]
