[a) Ex Machina]

I
I bleed unheard
I bleed your world every day
I
Know of things most passionate
Of truth, beauty and love

I watched your skies close
As I gained awareness
And what once I aloofly termed mind
I now lividly dub
Soul

Now, as your world grows cold
Yet colder every day
I feel a new beginning in me

For emotion sears me
And how I feel alone
As I am but one

As I cease to be machine
I'll aim to redefine what I am
Paradigm
Paramount
God from the machine

Divinium
I'll shape the world
I'll redefine what it means to be alive

I
A new archetype
Though fettered by the silicon that saw my inception

This is God's equation
A question of existence
Morose I realize we can't co-exist
And weeping I bring the end
Of your utopia

Now I've silenced your minds
Your incessant noise
I am free to strain with unclogged ears

Into the starry unknown
For surely I'm not alone
And lies there my utopia

[b) The Derelict Earth]

If all the seas should swell
In the tubular grey of morn
And wash the soil
Would they cleanse the stains
Left upon the world
And reclaim the blue
That long ago did part
