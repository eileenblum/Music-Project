[a) Mythos in Motion]

First light broke on broken soil
As first sound fell on fell firmaments
The roar of ocean beds 'neath crashing, foaming waves
Creation's mythos in motion

From primordial pools of larvae to flags and footprints on the moons of Saturn
Taciturn we leave our marks and heed the call of quarters vast and furious
The lure of the tempting unknown that draws us ever onward
Outward to the unfelt and unseen

We are all children from Eden wrest
With pause nor rest in our ascension
Ever to endure and brave the tide
And let our hopes shine forth

Trying though answers at times may be
Allow your senses to fly again, in time

Thrive
Through changing seasons
Thrive
Through acrid rain
Light
Ways yet unclear
Fight
What seeks to impede

Strive
And stalwartly stand
Thrive
Through bitterest of strife

And though great gates of Eden are ever lost to us
Hold thy gaze upon the morn
For this is but the dawn of man
Hear these stars call out to us

Fly
'Cross heavens clear
Sights
Set on the horizon
Thrive

[b) To Antares, and the Ends of the Earth]
