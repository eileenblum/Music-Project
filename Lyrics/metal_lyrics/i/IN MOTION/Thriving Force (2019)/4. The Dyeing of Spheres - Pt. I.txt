Waking from insanity, a spectacle of the night
Wrought by my hand, these timeworn places
Stagnant, without change

Though for the majesty of sheer massiveness
Of measure, amount and volume
Too tenebrous still these sombre faces
The trillions that strew the sky

So dream did I, in width and wavelength
Of contrast and saturation
Sonorous with every tincture
The clamour of a world alight

Behold, bleakness recedes before hue
A night-timeâs delirious dawn

Colour permeates perpetual grey
To touch thee I painted the spheres

And so at last there was colour
Texture
Form

Colour
