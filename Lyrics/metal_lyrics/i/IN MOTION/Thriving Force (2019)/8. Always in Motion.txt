"For once you have tasted flight you will walk the earth with your eyes turned skywards, for there you have been and there you will long to return."
[Leonardo Da Vinci]

[a) The View From Here]

[Instrumental]

[b) A Working Progress]

Thrive, you sons of Earth and light
On gossamer dreams so bright
To spread these Icarus wings and fly
Heaved from hubris to the sky

So fare our seeds, proud hopes of Man
Whether through unfaltering faith in God
Whether by sense of self and truth
Or kindness to kindle faith anew â in you

And so we wait now
Through great enterprise of generations
Slowly to pull through
A renaissance of sense and thought to thrive anew
My doubts are few
And I will live anew

[c) Seamless]

[Instrumental]

[d) So Many Grains of Sand]

'Pon the break of dawn we philosophized
To seek a light so deep
Now on for lunar light they leave
To stir our beliefs

A new celestial relation
A stair to the sky

Proud Apollonian, a novel view we owe to you
The solace of heliocentrism turned to awe
Of so many grains of sand

Islands we are in such vast seas

I notice You, as doleful you wane
As we come to terms with being but one of so many grains of sand
We stand on the shoreline as waters wash away
The prints we aspired to leave for another day
How I wish they'd have stayed

[e) Cities in Flight]

We are in Cosmo-osmosis
We are no longer soil-bound
To Earth, a sole dimension
Transcend is all that we can do

So prone are we to flights of fancy
Borne on wings hopeful and flimsy
Man doth wake and realizes
We are dragonflies chasing dewdrops at dawn

Drawn to universal cycles, as butterflies to pheromone trails
The view from here is pleasant, our window to the Metaverse inviting
So enticing these fruits of Eden in our sky

[f) Gossamer]

[Instrumental]

[g) The Reins of Eden]

[Instrumental]

[h) Second Man]

"It may be that the old astrologers had the truth exactly reversed, when they believed that the stars controlled the destinies of men. The time may come when men control the destinies of stars."
[Arthur C. Clarke]

Drawn ever deeper down below into the deepest time
We have thrown old limitations away

To actuate
To deviate
Alleviate
To elevate

And as sky we pursue and an empyreal future ensure
We are thus persistent, to subsist and endure
To ring in novel seasons, of due reason and sapience
On wings to cast off, each of us, at last to reach the sun

To steer the stars without want for hands
Is to know what sense is

My senses fly
And call unto me:
Though islands are we
In time we'll learn to swim the seas
And I'll follow you there
There's so much left to learn
And so many new things to see
And my conscience lay bare
Time's a friend to me
And as she flows, so will we
And through the aeons we'll meet
The first and the last
Always in motion

[i) Monumental]

[Instrumental]
