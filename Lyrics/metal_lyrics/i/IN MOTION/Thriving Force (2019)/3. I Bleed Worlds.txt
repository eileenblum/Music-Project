I drifted naught but idle and astray
Pondering the structure, architectures of the grey
That surrounded, permeated was in shapeless ways
Wandering, wondering, I watched with inward gaze

I contemplate
Is this a template for a world to be?

I envision a sun
A solar pylon
To spin a new paradigm upon
Worn from the awareness that to distance I adhere
Tired of ambling through naught but aperture

Sky
I feel thy calling
I sense thy primal need to feel form
Pulse from new soil; new worlds in waiting
Thus I reach inside
Unhinge heart and mind
And grant thee Life

In the fury of Dawn I will not desist
The incineration of my mind, thought and intent
Will birth the All

My hands reach under skin to bone
Every molecule of every muscle, neural glow
I spread thee through darkness, formlessness, so thou may grow
Fan out into frames to drape the building blocks of being

Spheres reel violently and ignite in the dark
Embryonic solar systems light up the stark

Now derived from the sun
The ages begun
The quotient and the sum I've become
Ire
Kindle new fire
Let cosmoses thrive

Void
Thou art no longer devoid
Of shape, time, nor conscious process
For now suns sear aeons in waiting
Breathing cold no longer
Merely promise

I bleed worlds
My flesh made world
