With a fist adorned in brass, it's time to stand up and fight your fears. Never
back down, never give up. This isn't about looking tough, it's about lifting
each other up. This is our home, we roll together till the day we die, without
my brothers, this wouldn't be life. Our hearts are gold and our motives are
pure, so keep your judgment off me. No matter who you are, no matter what
you've done, it's never too late to change, your always welcome with us. Scream
out at the top of your lungs, fight for what is yours, it takes more than blood
to be family, there's no stopping us now, this is our time to shine. STRAIGHT
EDGE.
