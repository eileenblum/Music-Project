The whole song is based off of this verse
"For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualitiesâhis eternal
power and divine natureâhave been clearly seen, being understood from what has
been made, so that men are without excuse."

Lord, I can see you moving. I can hear you whispering in the artistry painted
across the evening sky. Empty space became your canvas. Everything I observe
around me screams out your name. The stars are a blueprint of your incredible
magnitude. Your fingerprint beats between my ribs. I can feel your arms wrapped
lovingly around me, even when I fight to be released. I can hardly articulate
in words the beauty of your merciful forgiveness. The divine wisdom you have
displayed, Oh father, the staggering compassion is overwhelming. How you have
suffered, Oh Christ. Oh how you have loved. Crucified king, risen savior,
personal giver of salvation. [2x] The cross casts a shadow of grace. Lord wont
you show me your face. Wont you take my hand? Wont you open my eyes so that I
may see your plan? On my knees I shower in your presence. With my hands in the
air I exalt my father. Here I am to worship.
