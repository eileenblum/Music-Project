Guided by hatred, youâve created a religion all of your own. Dogmatically
defending your hypocritical position (position). Grounded in ârebellionâ, yet
ever conforming to the demands of your peers. What is it youâre so afraid of?
Brain washed. Emptied of all individuality. Demanding that we fit your mold. We
donât fear you - youâve made us stronger. Open-mindedness redefined. Keep
telling us weâre ignorant, keep telling us we donât belong, weâll keep you in
our prayers and keep making worship songs. [2x] Where is this tolerance you
speak of? Why are your lips tainted by that which you condemn? A strictly
defined double standard - I am disgusted by what I observe (disgusted by what I
observe). I am so tired of a finger pointed at me - with closed eyes and a loud
mouth, are you unwilling to learn? I am disgusted by what I observe.
