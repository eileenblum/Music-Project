Given wings to boldly champion the open air, to soar purposefully from the captivity of your former self, commit not to crawling on your stomach.
Justified before the throne of the most high, you are a precious child of God
The very depths of your most shameful agony, the painful grief behind which youâve hidden, the vicious weight of depravity resting contentedly on your shoulders,
the vicious weight of depravity resting contentedly on your shoulders was nailed to the cross.
Jesus bore your debt, so that you might be free. [X4]
Settle not for the false safety or for the transitory comfort of bonded hands, but remember your identity in the Son of God. You are not what you have done; you are what Jesus has accomplished. Cast into an ocean of grace, we cannot exhaust Godâs glory. Cast into an ocean of grace, we cannot exhaust Godâs glory. Cast into an ocean of grace.
Settle not for the false safety or for the transitory comfort of bonded hands
Banish the disconnect.
Banish the disconnect.
Banish the disconnect.
Banish the disconnect.
