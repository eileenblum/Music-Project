It will always be a struggle in some ways.
It's important to remember that you don't have to do anything in His favor,
He already loves you,
So the things that you do,
Do because you want to, not because
You have to for any reason.
That is something I still struggle with, but knowing that helps free me.
Don't let your failures keep you down, you are not disappointing God,
He already knows, you are disappointing yourself.
Which is understandable.
However, don't let that discourage you,
Don't dwell and keep walking forward.
Don't dwell and keep walking forward.
