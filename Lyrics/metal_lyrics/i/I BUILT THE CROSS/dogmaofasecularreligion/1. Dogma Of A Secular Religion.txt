Dogma of secular religion, oh, bearer of heavy shackles. 
Insouciance, the exalted standard.
Reason and intellect lay in the ruins of volition - laid to waste.
I hear your boasts of freedom; these doors are nailed shut. 
Bowing before the throne of gods cast in your image,
Authenticity's grave is sealed over. You 'cannot allow a divine foot in the door.'
Come now, let wisdom SEVER YOUR BONDS!
Poor ambassadors have poisoned doctrine; those 'believers' redefined God. 
They do not reflect Christ's compassion. Don't let them obstruct Christ's truth.
But here, knowledge prevails. 
At the foot of the Cross, truth's arms are outstretched. There are no
blindfolds in these words. 
Let Christ's kingdom reign! Let Christ's freedom reign!
Presuppositions determine the ends. Legalism dominates secular reasoning.
On your knees before the sovereign seat of detachment, dishonesty buries truth. [x2]
Dogma of secular religion, oh, bearer of heavy shackles. 
Insouciance, the exalted standard.
Reason and intellect lay in the ruins of volition - laid to waste.
LET CHRIST'S FREEDOM REIGN!
