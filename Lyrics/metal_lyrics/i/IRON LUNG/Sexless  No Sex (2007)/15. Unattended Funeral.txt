One man in charge of the corpse. Calloused hands from shovel handles He built this tomb alone. âNo one came to see him buried A talented doctor and skilled engineer He built machines that saved lives. They kept people breathingâ. All good deeds so unnoticed. They kept breathing âA man so great lamented by none, forgotten by all. Buried alone.â
