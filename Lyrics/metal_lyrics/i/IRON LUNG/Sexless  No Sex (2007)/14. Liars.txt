Every night I sleep in a room where somebody died I live in a fucking tomb where everybody lies Why? Why am I so lucky? They said I wouldnât catch it. They are liars They donât know. There was no escape There was nothing I could do. I do what they said I stayed away from friends I took all the precautions right up âtill the end Now, like them, ill die in this fucking machine A strong young man that once was No longer dwells where I now sleep I hope they something nice at my funeral
