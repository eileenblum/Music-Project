Negative pressure destroying//rebuilding Positive pressure destroying//rebuilding There is so much pressure in this fucking machine Devices devised to sustain my depressing life So much trouble just to keep the family pleased Heâs alive. Heâs okay. Too much pressure. Unrelenting stresses constantly destroy me My body is crushed to death every time it breathes Too much pressure. Itâs destroying me
