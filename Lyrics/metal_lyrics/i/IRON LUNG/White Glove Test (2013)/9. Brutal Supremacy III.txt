Taken to the dark bowels of isolation. Diagnosed. Condemned. Awesome terror permeates the ward. Nurses tremble with thoughts of care. The heavy steel door slams shut. Sealed off, forever, from the life that they had once known. Separated from the rest of the world. Destined to be alone until itâs done with them. There is no hope for them.
