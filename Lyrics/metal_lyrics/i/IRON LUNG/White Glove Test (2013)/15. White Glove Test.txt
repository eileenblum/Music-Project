The body is filthy. The body is weak. White gloves remove the cancer. They find rot and corruption. White gloves indicate disease. The body fights itself and loses. They wipe the dust from the corpse. K.J.I. Short, fast, violent actions. They find rot and corruption. They indicate disease. White gloves testing our resolve.
