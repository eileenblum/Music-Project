Years of mental abuses that were self-imposed. A life reduced to simple tasks. Breathe. Grow. I am a seed in a bed of shit. Feeble body//strength of mind. Thoughts will wander. Iâm still here inside my fate. So many numbers to divide by 3. So many landscapes and beautiful things. Their ugly faces still remind me that life is shit.
