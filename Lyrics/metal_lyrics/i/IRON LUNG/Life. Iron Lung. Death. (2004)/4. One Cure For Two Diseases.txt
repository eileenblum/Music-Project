For use with patients who have no power. mullikins can travel with you, the portable type of IRON LUNG. wear the chest plate,snap the hose in and move with pride. passengers with polio no longer bed ridden. wear your shiny IRON LUNG. be the envy of their eyes. the 50's now belong to you. when polio is on the move, consume. baby boomers with the virus still wither slowly yet high in fashion. buy the goods and be supreme. you'll still die.
