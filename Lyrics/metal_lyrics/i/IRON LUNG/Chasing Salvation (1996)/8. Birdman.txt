I feel my resolve strengthen
I se my arms lengthen
I'm gonna shed my skin
And fly away

I'm gonna grow wings
I've got to change things
I need to grow inside
And just move on

I've got to get out
There can be no doubt
I need to change inside
And just move on

My resolve grows strong
And my arms grow long
I'll rip my skin off
And fly away

So now you know
I've got to go
Already gone
I'm moving on
