Do you think you have your life in check
It's far from true
You deny from every breath you take
If it pleases you
You shop the wardrobe of your life
To see what's right
Dress yourself for a sunny day
But now it's night

Unprepared for true reality, you're feeling frail
Unprotected Principality, you're looking pale
You're employed without a salary, you're bound by fail

Don't have hearing, say I preach
Mock the meaning that I teach
Building bridges with no feet
But there's no mercy in the street

The eggs in your basket have slipped from your hands
Unable to keep up with things that you should have done
The train you've been riding is off of the tracks
You reach for support and find nothing but backs

The eggs in your basket have slipped from your hands
Unable to keep up with things that you should have done
The train you've been riding is off of the tracks
You reach for support and find nothing but backs

The eggs in your basket have slipped from your hands
Unable to keep up with things that you should have done
The train you've been riding is off of the tracks
You reach for support and find nothing but backs

The eggs in your basket have slipped from your hands
Unable to keep up with things that you should have done
The train you've been riding is off of the tracks
You reach for support and find nothing but backs
