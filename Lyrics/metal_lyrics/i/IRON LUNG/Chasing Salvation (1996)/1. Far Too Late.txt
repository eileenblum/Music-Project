What did you dream of in your youth
How is it now that you're getting old
Doesn't it look bleak from where you stand

You never tried to see the light
You thought that it would just come along
Things haven't work out how you planned

And so it seems life passed you by
The world it had no room for those who fail to try
And after all it's far too late

You never tried to think it through
And now you pay for your apathy
Your hopes are long since at an end

And so it seems life passed you by
The world it had no room for those who fail to try
And after all it's far too late

Doesn't it look bleak from where you stand
Things haven't worked out how you planned
Your hopes are long since at an end
You find yourself your only friend

And so it seems life passed you by
The world it had no room for those who fail to try
And after all it's far too late

Now here we are out in the rain
No shelter so drown from your weakness
You find yourself your only friend
