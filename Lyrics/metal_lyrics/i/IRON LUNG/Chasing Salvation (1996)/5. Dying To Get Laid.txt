You didn't care, you had a buzz
You wouldn't listen to the friends you know and trust
You couldn't think with your right head
So now we suffer at the loss because you're dead

And I could tell just by your face
That the barrister of rubbers had no case
And we all knew just by her stance
She made a hobby out of taking off her pants

You always had to disapprove
And it became your final move
It never seemed to feel the same
So now you've been pulled from the game

You always had to disapprove
And it became your final move
It never seemed to feel the same
So now you've been pulled from the game

You were a dog, you were in heat
So now the cemetery is the place we meet
You down below, me up above
You are a corpse because you wanted to make love

We are gathered here to say goodbye and it's a shame
But the coach in the sky pulled you from the game
You were a kind if stubborn friend
But now you're gone and that's the end

You always had to disapprove
And it became your final move
It never seemed to feel the same
So now you've been pulled from the game

You always had to disapprove
And it became your final move
It never seemed to feel the same
So now you've been pulled from the game

It was good sex, there is no doubt
But now you're knocking on the coffin to get out
You never bargained but now you've paid
Because right or wrong you were just dying to laid
