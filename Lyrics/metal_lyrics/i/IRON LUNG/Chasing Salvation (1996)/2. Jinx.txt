There's dark around you
I don't know what to do
Aural stench, bruising vibe
Immoral threat to our tribe

It's dark around you
I don't know what to do
Aural stench, bruising vibe
Immoral threat to our tribe

It clouds my vision
A karma incision
Bitter sight tasting vile
A brazen ego goes to trial

Act out and change your ways
Start now there's only days
Act out and change your ways
Start now there's only days

No chance is that what you're telling me
You can't change, your thoughts are a felony
Too hard you're locked up without a key
Too bad your life has been misery

No chance is that what you're telling me
You can't change, your thoughts are a felony
Too hard you're locked up without a key
Too bad your life has been misery

It's dark around you
I don't know what to do
Aural stench, bruising vibe
Immoral threat to our tribe
