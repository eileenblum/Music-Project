You've got a lot inside your head
From all the crap you're being fed
Is it that you want to change yourself
Or play the game for someone else

Did you sit there and just believe
Is your arrogance that naÃ¯ve
Your tunnel vision has no reprieve
Shallow life when you self deceive

Consume yourself in lies that you have nurtured from your fear
Sit inside a shell afraid to share with death so near
Anaemic and bulimic is the soul you tried to raise
Alone the way you're shone without a friend for all your days

Consume yourself in lies that you have nurtured from your fear
Sit inside a shell afraid to share with death so near
Anaemic and bulimic is the soul you tried to raise
Alone the way you're shone without a friend for all your days

When you finally see what you've done
Your salvation has turned and run

Am I not what you want me to be
Am I not what you expected to see
I am the Jesus reincarnate

I'm not a toy, did you think you could play
With me there just isn't a way
Broken world when you fuck with the god of the sun

Live your life in self submission
Drink in hand and prohibition

And you'll try and you'll die, don't know why
And you'll try and you'll die, don't know why
And you'll try, don't know why and you'll die

Walk with me
Talk with me
Then you'll see
You cannot, you will not be free

Am I not what you want me to be
Am I not what you expected to see
I am the Jesus reincarnate

I'm not a toy, did you think you could play
With me there just isn't a way
Broken world when you fuck with the god of the sun
