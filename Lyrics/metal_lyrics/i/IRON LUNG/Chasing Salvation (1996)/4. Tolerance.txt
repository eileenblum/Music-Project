I took my medicine just like I was told
Without my tolerance I'm out of control

I cannot stand you
I would not lie
Won't put up with the egos of those I despise

Your story's been told
Your attitude's old
Why did you have to push me
Are you really that bold?

Your story's been told
Your attitude's too damn old
Why do you have to push me
You're out of control

You're all just insects
You're only bugs
I'll take an AK to the shopping mall and fill you with slugs

Your story's been told
Your attitude's old
Why did you have to push me
Are you really that bold?

Your story's been told
Your attitude's too damn old
Why do you have to push me
I'm out of control

Come to the edge
Drop off the ledge
And lose control
Come feel the rift
Jump off the cliff
And cleanse your soul

Come to the edge
Drop off the ledge
And lose control
Come feel the rift
Jump off the cliff
And cleanse your soul

Come to the edge
Drop off the ledge
And lose control

Your story's been told
Your attitude's too damn old
Why do you have to push me
I'm out of control

You're all pathetic
You're making me sick
I wish you could see the darkness that's making me tick
