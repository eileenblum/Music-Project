[Lyrics: Morkh]

Swart suns' throne my flesh doth skrew
'Midst the stellar wisdom seas
How bittersweet is the triumph's taste as I wend my way
The hidden stare beholdeth

Tenebrae of untime passing forth
Streameth to me thro' my pain's design
Fears of eld ornate my soul with a greater lore
Thence the night granteth yawning graves

O Truth-sans-end Thy name be chasm for mortals
I thread once more the eldritch path to the realms
beneath
My fall eternal, this fall - life immortal
Hark to the black spheres' curse of the curious
race of the worms

Dimensions filth'd by tytanic wrath
Unfurl
the key to the earthly being
And galaxies rap'd vail in awe before me
The seven seals (of reincarnation) I wield

Words of Woe unto suns and orbs
And therewith I chide them forth

"O Ye hwa peynen endleas ofercwoman
Hwa werre steorra onyean wonnon
Hwa afrehwoer dead ond blod swinnan..."

Blackwhirlwind breathing outer Chaos
Wherein I, timeless abide

"O Ye secree tusendfaced
Hwaem eal ayet
Tac min gyft cyndliz"
