[Lyrics: Raattent/ Lyrical concept: Morkh]

"You all are flesh that hath of my blood appear'd
Your words to me bespoken hath the eery clash
with light betokened"

Where all pagan paths cross
Where all olden warriors
meet
And torrents collide
Thitherwards I turn my feet
The Welkin's tongue - thundering swords
The Earth's tongue - beast's shriek
(My mother tongue)
That I spake when Rus' was born

Immortalized for their thousandbrave rites
Ancestors glorious rise from the sea
Their dagger-sharp voices pronounce words of
Thine
Beryhm'd in legends old

Soul of Wolf and Raven
Again as in times of
yore
Soul of Wolf and Raven
Zmei Ognennyi Wolk
Soul of Wolf and Raven
We call to Thee
Soul of Wolf and Raven
The one who guideth as at war

Thousandfac'd serpent leadeth us unto war
Beclouded stare of His bale-burning eyes
Of all Heathen temples revealing the lore
Beryhm'd in legends old

"The time that holdeth all times shalt out of fog
emerge
The millenial dreams of false light by my
venom
shalt be scorch'd"

Wolves aflame
We shall stalk thro' sylvian monoliths
Ravens valorous
We shall fly o'er deepest seas
Serpents unseen
We shall
crawl into open mouths
In the heart of hearts of the white plague

Our host - the armours by grim runes enforc'd
The htonic horde hath for vengeance return'd
Ire-storming hiss shalt be hear'd from inside
Their demise shalt be my breathren and I
