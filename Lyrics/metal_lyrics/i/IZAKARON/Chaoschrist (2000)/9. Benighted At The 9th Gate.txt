[Lyrics: Morkh]

The fourth ignited star did fall another time
So flamingly enlightening my raptur'd eyes
The daggers drew their paths upon my skin
Thus showing triumphant unlight
Foreseen eternities ago
And now unfolding fragments to my life
To testify the timeless sacrifice
Of majesty of countless crowns of earth

Farther than vestures of night are the gates
Dreaming dead crawl thy kingdomwards
Enter beyond the wraith-way gate!
Near than spaces of crucifi'd world
To fiends unrestrain'd unfurl their trace
Darkness' beloved my wisdom flareth
I am benighted

Betid by darkness, though I am He myself
The eightfold art my flesh now doth begird
Out of these worlds Magnificence be heard
Though worlds once weeping into dead now turn'd

"Thy flesh be daughter of dust
Thy name upon the water's be inscrib'd
And paradise of thine be one
Of those tales told
On shores of Chaos Unrivall'd"

Within the shrine amidst the forests of mine
In icy slumber bleedeth from my
eyes
An astral passage to the 9th gate
Snow'd by time
Herald of enshadowed spheres
Tyrannic scourge of waels,
Word of Unrivall'd Chaos
Whose face to mirrors sworn
In times I drown

Verily am I deity within my own self
Skewering a thousand incarnations
By the palm of Chaos bless'd
Capturing the realms in my possession
Moonlight Thy spectre shalt sent
Ere I invoke Thee again
The wraith-way
gate receive
And mortals' dawn is torn
Beyond retrieve
