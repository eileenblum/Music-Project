[Lyrics: Warzlav]

I see the tears of enthralling silence
I hear its cold soundless
might
It watches me from peaks of reachless mountains
And I cognizes the verges of its bottomless being
In the dismal gleam of a writhing moon
A grim shining of frost-bound rime...
Waves of distress wash the bated nature
Awaiting the soundblast of dawn
Where
northern spirits call...
They call me!

Landscapes cut through my soul
In ages of frozen shadows I was born
My heart of the North shining through primal snow
Now I can hear Winter's calling horn
I am alone
To stand amidst perrenial trees
At befogged and time-veiled Svarog's throne
Under the blazing skies
Forever shall I remain

Deepest mirror-lakes reflect
The splashes of constellations
Forsaking
their flaming bodies
With the sparkles of burning stars
Exhausted... they long
For the enshrouding mere of rest
Victims of the tired empyrean
Illume me with fountains of light!

?Aurora Borealis, draw apart the boundaries
of the everlasting aeon of stillness!?

Atoms of the world in the chasms of space
Hark to the mourning of the ethereal elements
And spread the streams of malign wizardry
Throughout the spanless snowy realm

A vehement multitude of silvery splendour
Lies in the gorges of highlands, embraces the
forests age-old...
Lo! The blizzard is raving in silence
The breath of life beneath the bowels of this land...
...Enchanted forevermore!...

Out of the depths of time,
covered with dust of a million years? wisdom
Unknown planets of yore born,
wander eternally in the outer space

They wot there's only one Promised Land
Where strange sadness is born in my heart
Making hear the quiet and the whispers
And see its diamond tears
Under the reign of winter cold
