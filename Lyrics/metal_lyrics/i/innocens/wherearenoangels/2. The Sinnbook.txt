Why I stray into this hollow way 
The God ainât send me though one nice day 
I know no, no slashes anymore 
How it goes â my shadow on the wall 
I donât know how I can fall asleep 
Goddam law I have to hitch my steed 
Prepare to go and close the door 
Rest in peace, me, the loser anymore

Let me see your scars 
No wonder what you did 
To have those on your heart 
Ainât trying to defeat 
Thirty thousand times 
So far, light years from home

Calling final storm 
Your innocence is gone 
Tear your breath away 
To stint your last week leaf 
Hanging like your life 
Preparing cold dark shield

Heavenward fire 
Is burning down 
I close the book 
Allâs over now!

Let me be your dark 
Just hearing your heart-beat 
Take a walk and hark 
No one will you meet 
For the rest of time 
Take a better me
