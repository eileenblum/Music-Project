What you do to save my dreams? 
Is it real or redundant? 
You can hear the stories round your World 
What you do to let me know? 
Where are Angels without helo? 
We can feel them all ainât see them

I canât fly although I want 
Instead I fell to deepest mourn 
Hopes faded away I hurt myself 
You go to Hell!

I wish I could be like them 
Throw all my worries away 

Hopes faded away I hurt myself
You go to Hell
