Trying to grow the red rose on 
Frozen ground 
Building endless bridge to dawn alone

What should I say what I did wrong 
Understand me 
Why do you have that empty soul my Cristina

Do you think you can own me 
Building me a home and tomorrow 
Do you think you can own 
Building me a home

All for her I carry on 
Falling down 
Take hard work to cheer her soul once more 

You have never felt forlorn? 
Tearful nights 
I paff your work but our child alone 

What should I say if you canât see 
Whatâs the weighty 
Why do you have that empty soul oh my Lord
