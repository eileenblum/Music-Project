Welcome down there in the shadows 
We are hiding round our souls for centuries 
So learn the truth or never 
Know what to do forever

Whispered emotions to my âfriendâ 
Forget my name 
Promised devotion with no care 
Forget my name 
Forget my name

Slowly falling living danger 
The past is calling no need to wake up memories 
Just stay around and open eyes 
Face the truth however

Do you finally believe me 
Why Iâm hiding lovely face behind the veil 
So learn the truth or never 
Know what to do forever
