Lake of thousand souls 
Where do they go? Where will they die? 
Sailing round the world 
Sleeping in Storm woke up my Mind 
Following the time 
Canât make their own decision 
Carrying with the truth 
Dreaming their lives oh what they do?

Who will dry their eyes? 
We cannot see behind the door 
Burning down the silence 
Loosing face and cursing you 
Ending those chapters 
Theyâve written another New One 
Stolen words from book 
Nobody reads but everyone knew

I know theyâre self-denied 
Why canât wish âBON VOYAGEâ 
Donât guess why hesitate 
Couldnât find a better way

Staring in the eye 
What do they do? Why do they cry? 
Sailing round the world 
Only barefoot floating by night 
Haunted by the time 
Dying for religion 
When? The time will tell 
May yesterday or no more again

Dare to ask them why? 
Wake me up so easy? 
Dare to safe my life? 
Run awayâ¦
