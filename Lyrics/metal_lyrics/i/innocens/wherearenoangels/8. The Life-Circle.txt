Another one had died, 
Another one was born 
Heâs walking through 
The journey he was made for by the fate

Heâs crossing our days 
Oh poor weeping boy 
You can deserve 
To stay behind the sun shining on your face 
What do you say?

Tonight we heal your heart and all dreams 
Heal your scars by balm then we 
Try to magic smile 
Why you wonder why

She was a friend of mine 
Such a beauty you wonât see it twice 
Every man lost themselves in her eyes

She loved the flowers blooming 
I cry to see her lying on the floor 
She never opens eyes to love them again 
What do you say?
