As a teardrop fragile Fay Iâm spinning around 
There are things I couldnât even touch I donât know why 
I guess there must be some 
To wash away my tears 
I guess there must be someone 
Without those fears

Can I feel all the rhythm divine 
Dream once again

I pretended courage but with empty hands 
That time I was at still Iâm 
At the wrong place 
With no weapon I am trying to find my way 
Thatâs not too hard to say that 
Iâm a bit scared

Defend me, hold me near 
Guide me, lead me, please

Iâm at loss for words sometimes even without breath 
Thatâs the way it is so long and 
I canât dare 
There are angels everywhere so wonder why 
Why theyâre not living only 
On the sky
