Walking through these dirty streets 
Youâre trying to find own memories 
Youâve lost somewhere but no one can be found 
Well my dear, you were so near 
So close to glad my face your fears 
And gentle breeze were almost disappeared

What a horrid world 
No smile and no one pleasant 
Not a single word 
Youâre stayinâ alone and lonesome 
Alone and lonesome 
Over there

Can you see through the tears 
The sky is turning fine to wake up 
Through the dream the warmth of memories
