More colors than black and white 
Coloured earth weâre walking on 
Things I never saw, never said, never felt 
Strange our behavior itâs not the same 
The time have betrayed me again 
Wings I never had, never get, never let me raise

For what we are living for 
Period of deepest nights and brightest days 
For moments that never came 
For what we are dying for 
Painting the life by our true colors 
Then all of us will sleep an endless dream

Give me strength now Iâm so weak 
Wafted by the wind like leaf 
How could reach the moon above 
Crucify the love with love 
Such a shame we had a deal 
Life for lust and bad for real 
Die to give a birth again 
Like a wizard calling rain

More colors than black and white 
Colored earth weâre walking on 
Things I never saw, never said, never felt

For what we are living for 
Painting the life by our true colors 
Then all of us will sleep an endless dream
