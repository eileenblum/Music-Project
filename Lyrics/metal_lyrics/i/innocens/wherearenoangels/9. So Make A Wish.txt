Dear Liar this was your last sentence 
Told like the fear-minded faith 
I swear this was your first and last 
Regret that I have you ever met

Old lies there are with us forever 
Dark days your soul eating fast 
Small world beneath the blue sky never 
Canât bear your loving face feint

What you do with empty heart 
See the missionâs over 
Can not tell but can deny 
Forget that we have some feelings all decided

You will feed own instinct 
By my endless night

Temptation controls your mind 
Inspiration leading
Can not tell but can deny 
Forget that we have some feelings all decided

You will feed own instinct 
By my endless night

Were we satisfied? 
Having this creature soul 
Fault we can not find 
Alive forevermore
