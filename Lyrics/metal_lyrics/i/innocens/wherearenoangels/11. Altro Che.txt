Long for sweet heart to keep 
Give a shield 
Eyes wide open dreams were broken 
Imagining

The windy fields the misty morrows 
You better sleep 
I would like to turn back time 
Altro che

Standing here I dare to feel 
You are near 
Vastly hard I try to speak 
Words that spear

Waiting years for the only kiss 
This is me 
Hold the face almost forgotten 
Altro che!

Embraced me not my dear say what 
Neednât breathe 
Awake your soul wishing the time 
Can but heal

See me weeping oceans seas 
Release me 
Every emotion I lead to memory
