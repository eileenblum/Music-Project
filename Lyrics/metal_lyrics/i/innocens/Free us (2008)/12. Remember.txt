What a wonderful May
the moonâs introducing a new star
as he does every night 
gives a hope and sage resolution
takes your thoughts faraway
for those we donât speak of 
or just remember

Wonder is the deep depth
Itâs the charm of mirage 
Danger is the white lie
Itâs the highway to another horror 
Warm smile is the reason
Itâs the halfway to another life-line

And as stay of my faith
Iâm loosing my mind, my name
all forgotten in vain
Even all the friends I had as a child
Now you got me insane
Lost and broken at midnightâs frozen land

The more I get the more I pain
Remember this and take me away 
When allâs gone and nothing remains

What a wonderful May
the moonâs introducing a new star
as he does every night 
gives a hope and sage resolution
takes your thoughts faraway
for those we donât speak of 
or just remember
