What the hell kind could we be 
While the creature sleeps in me
Hurt them all
But never cried for all my life

It was pain to learn again to open heart
But we forgot to play 

Can remember but a face
Just some movements like a race
Gotta nothing gotta me 
with all my love

Be sorry for oneself and justify 
But never understand 

We share the same real 
You canât put it down
This storyâs not real
You canât leave behind

We live the same dream 
You canât put it down
Well allâs just a fear
And image of mine

Sweep all traces and forgot
Who you were and what you got
Now the creature awakes
And seeks the prey and blood

Be sorry for oneself and justify 
But donât forget to play
