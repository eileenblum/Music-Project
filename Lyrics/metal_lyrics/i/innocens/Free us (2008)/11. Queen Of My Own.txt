You donât realize 
Whoâs the worm that stilly sleeps inside 
Bites your veins and stabs your heart all night
Look at those youâve deceived once
For the gold and fleeting delight
Reflecting in your eyes

Just once and for all 
Bitter pill you have to swallow up
Quench the fire burning inside your mind
Get rid of the snake youâve got 
Winded round and choking darned
Poisoning your heart

Wait your doom till roars the thunder
We decided youâre going under

With grief youâve come so late 
As the liarâs best disciple 
Withering the cold winds blow

Iâm queen of my own 
Thereâs no doubt no need to know at all
You were one of thousands maybe more
I saved those youâve deceived once
For the gold and fleeting delight
Somewhere in the past
