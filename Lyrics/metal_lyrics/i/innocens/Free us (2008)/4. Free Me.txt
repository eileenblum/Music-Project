Thereâs a boat on shallow water
Waiting for its crew
So I search this shore and wonder
How can we lie 

About the time that heals us all 
Within a single year
We will search until the dawn
Show us the way

But I dare and want you
And my courage feels like 
And the light shines from you
Let it break whatâs linked tight 

I stand and pray free me 
From chains and ropes that choke me so 
My heart can send just Mayday 
Itâs getting dark my love 

First we cross the land then
Find each other brave
Follow path to nowhere 
Save us donât lead astray

We will sail together
Through oceans stormy seas
And we keep forever
All these memories
