Iâm so scared to face the truth Iâve found this winter night
My empty room, the silence over there and just one sound

I was born to fly
But I canât reach without the wings
I was born as lier
But thereâs no lie I ever meet

Come back my only one!
I was searching all the world
Come back my only one!
Until the first snow will falling down

You were there just few time ago and I feel lost and down
Which way to go to search and make my dearest again found

I was born to fly
But I canât reach without the wings
I was born as lier
But thereâs no lie I ever meet

Sacrificed my life to search the truth and finding you
I would die to have some message you have left me, fool

I was born to fly
But I canât reach without the wings
I was born as lier
But thereâs no lie I ever meet

Come back my only one!
I was searching all the world
Come back my only one!
Until the first snow will falling down
