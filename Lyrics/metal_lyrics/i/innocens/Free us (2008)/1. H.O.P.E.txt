I donât look for your comfort babe
Gotten enough from you
I was caught in the middle of deceiving
Cast  a role of  fool
Gimme more, gimme all to abhore
I reveal or will owe you again
May one day may no more may I say
Forget it all and brace my reins

Better travel fast
Underneath her mind
Straight into her veins

I donât need your rules to obey 
like a piece of idiot 
Catch me, sear me, kill if you can
But youâre always late
Gonna see, gonna be just for fee and grow
As your silly idols
Finally directly just for me and both 
Your identity

I hope that you believe
In this never ending path  
That leads us through the night 
To the reigns of fallen pride

I donât look for your comfort babe
Gotten enough from you
I was caught in the middle of deceiving
Cast a role of  fool
Gimme more, gimme all to abhore
I reveal or will owe you again
Finally directly just for me and both 
Your identity
