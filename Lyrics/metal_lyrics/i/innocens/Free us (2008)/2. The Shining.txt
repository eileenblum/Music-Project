Where do you shine tonight?
Broken into pieces
How do you know how long?
Fades away this wind

Time is passing by
Just diamonds are forever
Fall a height never mind so
How long will you shine

Haunted soul 
Wait for me
More and more 
Set me free

Where do you sleep this night?
Glitter that betrayed you 
Your wild heart open wide
Itâs pain enough to feel 

Unbelievable 
All vanities ainât closed down
Though no matter what 
We shine to survive
