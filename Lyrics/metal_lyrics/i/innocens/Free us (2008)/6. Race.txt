You never turn back
Time though you want that
Fearâs more than one lie
One fault and you die

Keep on running fast 
Donât dare to be last


God this challengeâs for you
I believe I can prove
I do

You run for a fall
Used blade to get more
Being alone realized
So aware no more lies

Lord, try to get me
You want you will see

God this challengeâs for you
I believe I can prove
I do
