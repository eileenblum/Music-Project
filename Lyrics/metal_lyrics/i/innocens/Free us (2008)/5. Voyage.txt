Lake of thousand souls
Where do they go?  Where will they die?
Sailing round the world
Sleeping in Storm woke up my Mind
Following the time
CanÂ´t make their own decision
Carrying with the truth
Dreaming their lives oh what they do?

Who will dry their eyes? 
We cannot see behind the door
Burning down the silence
Loosing face and cursing you
Ending those chapters 
TheyÂ´ve written another New One
Stolen words from book
Nobody reads but everyone knew

I know theyÂ´re self-denied
Why canÂ´t wish âBON VOYAGEâ
DonÂ´t guess why hasitate
CouldnÂ´t  find a better way

I know theyÂ´re self-denied
Why canÂ´t wish âBON VOYAGEâ
DonÂ´t guess why hasitate
CouldnÂ´t  find a better way

Staring in the eye 
What do they do?  Why do they cry?
Sailing round the world
Only barefoot floating by night
Haunted by the time
Dying for religion
When? The time will tell
May yesterday or no more again

I know theyÂ´re self-deniedâ¦

Dare to ask them why?
Wake me  up so easy?
Dare to safe my life?
Run awayâ¦
