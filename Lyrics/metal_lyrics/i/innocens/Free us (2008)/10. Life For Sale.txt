Can you still hear and see
That charm of harmony 
Today I sold my life
Iâve sold them all I got

Whatâs the problem?
Whatâs your name?
And my heart does feel the same
What could I do to save 
to bless it all just for you?

Do we both know at all
Whose life has gone away
Worrying head vain to waste 
Weâll see tomorrow dawn 

Whatâs the problem?
Whatâs your name?
And my heart does feel the same
What could I do to save 
to bless it all just for you?

You took me down my knees
It had to be my fall
Sold and lost to those  
You love and hate at once

Come on you are here as I see 
Why donât ya say hello to your steal
Come on and let go the one you need
Why donât ya grab my soul and disappear
