Castaway Iâve lost my mind
The windâs blown all I ever might
Lay by you inside of tear 

A sadly fading memory 
A perfect heart of history
The love has fairly drove me crazy

Castaway Iâve lost my mind
A sadly fading memory 
Always lost and never found
Sent to death if I believed
Would you embrace me, would you shelter me

Always lost and never found
No life-boat so I have drowned
Sent to death if I believed

I cursed in vain this century
For the cruelty inequity
I would die to kiss you so much I miss you!

Castaway Iâve lost my mind
A sadly fading memory 
Always lost and never found
Sent to death if I believed
Would you embrace me, would you shelter me
