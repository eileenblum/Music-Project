THE WAR STARTS NOW
THIS IS THE TRIBUNAL
THE CHAINS SET TIGHT PREPARE YOUR FUNERAL
BLACK AND WHITE, YOUâLL NEVER COMING HOME
LETâS HEAR YOUR LAST WISH, GO

YOUâRE TALKING SHIT IN THE DARK WHEN THERE IS NO ONE AROUND
BUT WHEN WE MEET IN THE RING, YOU BITHCES ALL PUSSY OUT
WHERE IS YOUR LOUDMOUTH NOW?

THEYâRE CRYING OUT, THEY RUN THEIR MOUTHS
BUT ALL THEY SAY WAS SAID BEFORE
BEFORE THIS END, THEYâLL REALIZE THIS GAME IS OLD
ITâS OVER NOW

TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR HYPOCRITES
PACK YOUR BAGS FOR A FUCKING HORRO TRIP
HEY, WEâLL COME AND GET YOU
I SEE THE PANIC IN YOUR EYES
THE SMELL OF SWEAT AND COWARDICE
WEâLL SEND YOU STRAIGHT TO HELL FOR LIFE
NO EASE, NO REST, NO PARADISE
YOU LITTLE PIECE SHIT WANNA FUCK WITH US
WE ARE RUSHING TO THE TOP WHILE YOU SUCKERS GET CRUSHED
BITCH THIS IS THE ANNIHILATION

BUT I FEEL NOTHING FOR YOU ANYMORE
BUT I FEEL NOTHING FOR YOU NOW
THIS IS RADICAL, THIS IS SHATTERING, ALL YOUR DREAMS ARE GONE

YOUâRE TALKING SHIT IN THE DARK WHEN THERE IS NO ONE AROUND
BUT WHEN WE MEET IN THE RING, YOU BITHCES ALL PUSSY OUT
WHERE IS YOUR LOUDMOUTH NOW?
THEY HATE US CAUSE THEY AINâT US
IâLL SEE YOU BOW DOWN TO THE GROUND
THEYâRE CRYING OUT, THEY RUN THEIR MOUTHS
BUT ALL THEY SAY WAS SAID BEFORE
BEFORE THIS END, THEYâLL REALIZE THIS GAME IS OLD
ITâS OVER NOW
