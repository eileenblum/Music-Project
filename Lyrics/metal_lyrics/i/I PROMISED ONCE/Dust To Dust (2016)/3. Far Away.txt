WE ARE THE WOLVES WHO FIGHT FOR FREEDOM FROM THE NIGHT THAT NEVER ENDS
EVEN THOUGH OUR FATE IS UNCERTAIN FAR AWAY

TO ARMS, HOLD THE LINE IF OUR SHIELDS CANNOT STOP THEM WEâLL NEVER DO IT AGAIN
HOW CAN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES WITH ALL THOSE BURNING BODIES?
WE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEFENDING THE REALM FROM THE TYRANT IN THE NAME OF OUR KING. 
WHEN EVERYTHINGâS OVER, ASHES TO ASHES DUST TO DUST

LOOK AT MY EYES, LOOK AT MY PAIN, LOOK AT MY LIFE
FLASHING RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES
NO ONE IS SAFE FROM OUR RAGE NO RETREAT TO ETERNITY

THE NIGHT IS DARK AND FULL OF TERRORS, I HEAR THE DEMONS SCREAMING
WE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEFENDING THE REALM FROM THE TYRANT IN THE NAME OF OUR KING
WHEN EVERYTHINGâS OVER. IN MY DREAMS I SEE YOUR FACE

YOU WANT TO SEE ME ON THE GROUND BUT IâLL NEVER BOW DOWN, IâLL NEVER GIVE UP
YOU WANT TO SEE ME ON THE GROUND BUT IâLL NEVER GIVE UP. SO COME AND GET ME

AND NOW ITâS RAINING SADNESS IN MY HEART
FALL FROM GRACE IâM LOSING ALL MY FAITH

I STAND WITH YOU TOGETHER YOUR SOUL IS EVERYWHERE
BUT IN MY THOUGHTS THEY KILL ME EVERY NIGHT, FAR AWAY

MY ARMS ARE CROSSED IN THIS FROST. MY LIFE IS LOST

I STAND WITH YOU TOGETHER YOUR SOUL IS EVERYWHERE
BUT IN MY THOUGHTS THEY KILL ME EVERY NIGHT, FAR AWAY
I STAND WITH YOU TOGETHER YOUâLL ALWAYS BE MY BROTHER
BUT IN MY THOUGHTS THEY KILL ME EVERYNIGHT, FAR AWAY
