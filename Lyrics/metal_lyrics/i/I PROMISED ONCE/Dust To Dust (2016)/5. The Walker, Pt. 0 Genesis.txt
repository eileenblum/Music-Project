WE CANâT DO IT ANYMORE
I FEEL ALONE AND LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND

THE FLASHBACKS REPLAY OVER AND OVER, IâM SICK OF IT ALL
THIS EMPTY FEELING WONâT GO AWAY
I WAKE UP EVERYDAY WISHING I DIDNâT
IT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO BE THIS WAY, NOTHING LEFT TO SAY
BURN IT TO THE GROUND RIGHT NOW
I BELIEVE IN ME, BUT I CANâT CHANGE MY PAST
DESPAIR EATS ME ALIVE

MY MISTAKES I NEVER LEARN FROM
THIS MIGHT AS WELL BE OUR LAST CHANCE
I DONâT SEE YOUR FACE, I DONâT HEAR YOUR VOICE
I CANâT FEEL YOU RIGHT NEXT TO ME
WHY ARE YOU NOT HERE?

HOW CAN YOU WALK THIS PATH, WHEN THERE IS NO LIGHT? 
IâVE FINALLY REALIZED SOMETHING DYING INSIDE ME
AM I PAST REDEMPTION? LET IT ALL FADE AWAY
ADD MY NAME TO YOUR LIST, I FAILED
I TRIED SO HARD TO SHUT THE FEELINGS OUT
I TRIED SO HARD BUT LIFEâS NOT WORTH LIVING
I LOST HOPE IN LIFE
TAKE ME BACK TO OUR TIME
TO KNOW THE TRUTH WAS THE HARDEST PART, I CANâT DO THIS ON MY OWN
HOW CAN I MAKE IT OUT OF THIS MISERY?

MY MISTAKES I NEVER LEARN FROM
THIS MIGHT AS WELL BE OUR LAST CHANCE
I DONâT SEE YOUR FACE, I DONâT HEAR YOUR VOICE
I CANâT FEEL YOU RIGHT NEXT TO ME
WHY ARE YOU NOT HERE?
STRUGGLE IN THE DARK. 
CAN YOU SET ME FREE? 
ITâS A DILEMMA

WHERE I AM NOW? TELL ME WHY, TELL ME WHY
EVERYTHING TURNED BLACK FROM THE MOMENT IâVE LOST YOU
I CAN STILL SEE YOU, WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES. 
TAKE ME BACK TO OUR TIME
JUST TELL ME NOW
WHY ARE YOU GONE?

ITâS TIME TO REALIZE YOU WONâT COME BACK
SO RAISE YOUR VOICES FOR THE HOPELESS
