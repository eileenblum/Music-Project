TAKE, TAKE, TAKE, TAKE MY HAND
DID YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT SIDE?
TAKE ANOTHER ROUND
YOU LITTLE FUCKING BITCH

I AM WALKING DOWN THE STREET SEARCHING FOR MYSELF
IS THIS MEANT TO BE MY SATISFACTION?
WHEN I WAKE UP, THE MEMORIES START FLASHING THROUGH MY HEAD
BLINDED BY THE FIGMENT OF MY PAST
WHEREâS THE RESPECT? ARE YOU PROUD OF YOUR LIFE?
FORGET IT, YOUâLL NEVER GET RID OF THIS POISONED SCUM
ITâS HARD TO REALIZE WHO I HAVE NOW BECOME

CAUSE I CANâT TAKEâEM BACK, THE WORDS I SAID BEFORE
AND IâVE BEEN LYING TO MYSELF FOR FAR TOO LONG
NOW IâM ON MY OWN

FUCK YOU
COME ON LETâS DO IT NOW
DISREGARD THE LAW AND BE FREE
SHUT UP, THATâS THE WAY SO CROWN ME THE FUCKING KING
MY LIFEâS A MOVIE WITH A NEVERENDING PLOT
YOU DONâT STOP TILL BREAK OF DAWN

THIS IS HELL
ITâS A BITTER FIGHT THAT I CANNOT WIN
I AM NOT STRONG ENOUGH
BUT YOU DECIDE YOUR OWN FATE
ANOTHER NIGHT TO BREAK MYSELF
YOU CANâT RESIST THE TEMPTATION
YOUR HANDS ARE SHAKING ONCE AGAIN
I WANNA SEE YOU FUCKING SINK

WE ARE ALL THE SAME IN THE AFTERLIFE
SO BREAK THE CYCLE, THERE IS NO TURNING BACK
WE ARE ALL THE SAME IN THE AFTERLIFE
NOW LETâS GET UP AND GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DIE FOR
BUT I AM NOT DEAD YET

THE TRUTH WILL PREVAIL IN THE END

CAUSE I CANâT TAKEâEM BACK, THE WORDS I SAID BEFORE
AND IâVE BEEN LYING TO MYSELF FOR FAR TOO LONG
NOW IâM ON MY OWN

FUCK YOU
COME ON LETâS DO IT NOW
DISREGARD THE LAW AND BE FREE
SHUT UP, THATâS THE WAY SO CROWN ME THE FUCKING KING
MY LIFEâS A MOVIE WITH A NEVERENDING PLOT
YOU DONâT STOP TILL BREAK OF DAWN
