IâM JUST ANOTHER BOAT IN THE OCEAN
DRIFTING THROUGH THE NIGHT
FOLLOWING MY DESIRES FOR CHEAP THRILLS
NO WAY TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT

BUT THEN I SAW THIS BEAUTIFUL CREATURE
IN THE CANDLE LIGHT
I NEVER FELT SO CLOSE TO HEAVEN
IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT

I WATCH YOU MOVE EVERY NIGHT AND DAY
THE WORLD AROUND ME TURNS TO GRAY

SO TONIGHT GIVE ME YOUR TIME
DONâT STOP TILL I SAY ITâS ALRIGHT
SO TONIGHT GIVE ME YOUR TIME
IâVE SEEN THIS LOOK A THOUSAND TIMES

WHATâS THE PRICE TO SELL MY SOUL?
I WATCH YOU MOVE EVERY NIGHT AND DAY
SHOW ME THATâS NOT WORTH MY TIME

I WATCH YOU MOVE EVERY NIGHT AND DAY
THE WORLD AROUND ME TURNS TO GRAY

SO TONIGHT GIVE ME YOUR TIME
DONâT STOP TILL I SAY ITâS ALRIGHT
SO TONIGHT GIVE ME YOUR TIME
IâVE SEEN THIS LOOK A THOUSAND TIMES

HYPNOTIZING
MESMERIZING

SO TONIGHT GIVE ME YOUR TIME
DONâT STOP TILL I SAY ITâS ALRIGHT
SO TONIGHT GIVE ME YOUR TIME
IâVE SEEN THIS LOOK A THOUSAND TIMES

FOR YOU, I WAITED ALL THIS TIME
I FEEL YOU KNOW
IâVE WAITED ALL THIS TIME
I HEAR YOU NOW
