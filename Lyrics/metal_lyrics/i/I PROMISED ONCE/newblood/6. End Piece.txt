The voices in my head haunts me every night
You'd better listen to what I say

Shut up!Shut up!
I won't deny all mistakes
Shut up!Shut up!
One last time

Can you break the silence?
Can you hear the voices?
Can you fix the broken?

It's time to pick a side
Hell or heaven's waiting
You know that I can't ride this storm alone

Survive!Survive!
I made it out alive
Survive!Survive!
One last time

Can you break the silence?
Can you hear the voices?
Can you fix the broken?

Can you give my breath back?
Can you see the light?
Can you feel the sadness?
Will you ever fucking awake?

Can you break the silence?
Can you hear the voices?
Can you fix the broken?
