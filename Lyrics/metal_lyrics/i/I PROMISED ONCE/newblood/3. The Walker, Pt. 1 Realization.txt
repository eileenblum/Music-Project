We are the walking dead
It is so hard to feel alive
you fucking fake
When the sun falls down,
we will rise from hell

Inside the virus spreads
When will the abyss swallow me,
we can't be saved
I'm gonna ask you one more time

Is this the end?
Like moths to flames
I can't believe
I'm too far gone
It's killing me
from the inside out again
Can you taste the failure on my lips?

I wake up, my memories are gone
Just another day in this life from hell

I wake up, the pain has left a hole
I'm gonna ask you one more time
Is this the end?
THIS IS THE END

Is this the end?
Like moths to flames
I can't believe
I'm too far gone
It's killing me
from the inside out again
Can you taste the failure on my lips?

I can't take this anymore
This empty shell that I call home
I can't take this anymore
Blackout
Six feet under

Burn this world
Burn this world
Burn this world
Until I go

Rising from the ashes
I will kill the demon spawn
Ready for the end
So dead god deliver me
Ready for one last round

Is this the end?
Like Moths to Flames,
I can't believe
I'm too far gone
It's killing me
Can you taste the failure on my lips?

Is this the end?
Like moths to flames
I can't believe
I'm too far gone
It's killing me
from the inside out again
Can you taste the failure on my lips?

Is this the end?
