Ever again my life won't be fed by warmth of your eyes
Those that sleep as I caress pale face, hold me in the grace of dark

I claim departure in the scorn of thine lights
This passion is my witness, this life's flame

Blood so cold though heart can't resist
To warm touch of painfull grief
Is grave feeble there, where youth burns
With the thine sadness condemned

Thou shall fade there as youth of my wrath
(Consoled by whispering lies) 
My fall is silent

Open my black grave, burn me at the stake and I will find tranquillity in flame
Let dust rush forwart, we will return to the ancient god

Oh, precious night, why my heart wasn't part of yours

When you've lose my soul in this woods of pain
You'll take me high through the winds of nostalgia and silent shall be yours
