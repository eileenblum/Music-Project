The time has come, on broken wings of grief
My dark horizons wait for storms to bury the lights
My spirit bleeds in cold depths of sadness
Caressed by the cutting wind or by the treasury for the lost souls of night

And I disturb silence above me and I regret the end of the lights
In this land of no return my wrath shall reign

The last dawn without the sun will show me the ways of immortality
The last dawn without the sun will dim my soul 'till eternity

Waken by whispers of angels from my mortal dreams
Led by screams of those that die in damnation
Far away with flames of my black heart
I can feel eternity in the dead skies on this precious night

Why wind takes me easy as sorrows breath
Where my silence will end, lost in the vast woods

I will fly with thou above clouds of the dark night
As the eternal nature's calls dim my mind, take my heart

Waken by whispers of angels from my mortal dreams
Led by screams of those that die in damnation
Far away with flames of my black heart
I can feel eternity in the dead skies on this precious night

Why wind takes me easy as sorrows breath
Where my silence will end, lost in the vast woods

I will fly with thou above clouds of the dark night
As the eternal nature's calls dim my mind, take my heart

Why wind takes me easy as sorrows breath
Where my silence will end, lost in the vast woods

I will fly with thou above clouds of the dark night
As the eternal nature's calls dim my mind, take my heart
