I behold sorrow for those of transient souls
Buried "in pace" far away from lights
Desecrated I walk on the paths of the shadows
To the valley of tempations

All my calls to worthless dawn
Of holy mist that gathers above our sights
Will echo in epitaph of my pain
At the stake drowned in unholy slumbers

On the wings of holy mist I fade as godson's light
Over my tears of knowledge, death bing me reborn
I awake the eternal night on glows of thy wisdom
Pale as my eyes in this enchanting fire

On the wings of holy mist

On the wings of holy mist I fade as godson's light
Over my tears of knowledge, death bing me reborn
I awake the eternal night on glows of thy wisdom
Pale as my eyes in this enchanting fire

I behold sorrow for those of transient souls
Buried "in pace" far away from lights
Desecrated I walk on the paths of the shadows
To the valley of tempations

All my calls to worthless dawn
Of holy mist that gathers above our sights
Will echo in epitaph of my pain
At the stake drowned in unholy slumbers

On the wings of holy mist I fade as godson's light
Over my tears of knowledge, death bing me reborn
I awake the eternal night on glows of thy wisdom
Pale as my eyes in this enchanting fire

On the wings of holy mist

On the wings of holy mist I fade as godson's light
Over my tears of knowledge, death bing me reborn
I awake the eternal night on glows of thy wisdom
Pale as my eyes in this enchanting fire

On the wings of holy mist I fade as godson's light
Over my tears of knowledge, death bing me reborn
I awake the eternal night on glows of thy wisdom
Pale as my eyes in this enchanting fire

I awake the eternal night on glows of thy wisdom
Pale as my eyes in this enchanting fire
