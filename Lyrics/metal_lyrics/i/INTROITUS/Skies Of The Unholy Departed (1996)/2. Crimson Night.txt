Night reveals the ancient spirits in the forest of dark delights, exiled in despair

Grand blasphemy to the heights of misery's wrath
Human's brotherhood, a chalenge to the christian's sky
Inverted cult, lord of nature again is born
With melancholic haughtiness of eternal exile

Hear the calls for dethrones god to notify by thunder
In dim Satan's shadow we worship ourselves
Demon spells, witchcrafts and dark delights will let
Painfull agony to end my woefull life

And night shall hide afraid shadows that have gone in the skies
Upon black tears, eternal sleep of frozen hearts

All broken wings cremate the spirits by own sins
Which fade in night with inner pain for the ancient god

Forbidden occult rises when moon shadows dance
In the night of black mass the altar is risen

For the spirit that has created the ground, we wait for crimson night
