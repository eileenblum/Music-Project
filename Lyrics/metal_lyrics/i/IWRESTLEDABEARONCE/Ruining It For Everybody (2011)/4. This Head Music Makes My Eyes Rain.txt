He's got an English smile
And you wouldn't believe me when I tell you
It wraps around my heart like threads
We disappear in here, we disappear
It's where we can go to be alone
People know it's true
When you're the only two in a crowded room
This chemistry will sentence us to death
If there was a bridge that could stretch
Across the sea from points A to B
Our loved ones that we hold so boldly in our hearts and
minds wouldn't schedule us for a romantic jester of a
hanging, this early Thursday morning
In here, we disappear...
