Insomnia is our instigator
Insomnia
(One, two, three, four, five, six)
We'll pack our base, forget our heads at the door
Don't let it get the best of us as we go through its motions
together focus, and give us something to believe in
We live, we love, we've lost so much
Sometimes you just have to walk off the madness that stands in your way
Violent movements embrace our stage
We'll orchestrate this delicacy
Composers, army of sound
Keep, keep your hands off the glass
Keep, keep your hands out of everything
A murderous vulture with the benefits
We're on the road, we're on the road again
Running around and around, running around again
