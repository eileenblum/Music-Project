I felt the ocean breaking over my head, I'm spinning. A constant pressure I can't fight, I might not make it through the night. I was raised in a state; so much at stake, a slab of meat deteriorating, muscles are weak.

No bone in my back, ligaments slack. Sensations, my insides cave as they rot. Infested in waves, take hold of my marrow, and wash it away. No bone in my back, ligaments slack. Sensations, my insides cave as they rot. I'm treading water dreading the end wont numb my feeling. I'm calling out to you I'm begging you for help because I've been given all the answers and I can't even help myself, yes I've been given all the answers and I can't even help myself. I held a glass out in my hands, I made fist; a consequence. My fingertips are filled with shards, my open palm is filled with blood.
A single drop will conjure up unspeakable creatures preserved in the salt, worse than darkest pools in my mind. They float, suspended.
There is no time, no time. I'm treading water dreading the end wont numb my feeling. I'm calling out to you I'm begging you for help because I've been given all the answers and I can't even help myself, yes I've been given all the answers and I can't even help myself. I curse the god who brought a vision as a cry for help: an island passing and I'm reaching out for help because I've been given all the answers and I can't even help myself, yes I've been given all the answers and I can't even help myself.
