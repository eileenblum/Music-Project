I am responsible
I blame myself for your slight of hand
you turn the mirrors in
a glass reflection I can't withstand

And my patience wears thin
you are so stuck in your ways
I am the rope you are hanging on
and my patience wears thin

My patience wears thin
can I recover the waste?
I am the fire I smoke you out
and my patience wears thin
my patience wears thin

Loving fed a lie
that we couldn't separate
and when I let it die
I constantly paid for it
when the story begins
you never stepped in

and my patience wears thin
you are so stuck in your ways
I am the rope you are hanging on
and my patience wears thin

My patience wears thin
can I recover the waste?
I am the fire I smoke you out
and my patience wears thin
my patience wears thin
