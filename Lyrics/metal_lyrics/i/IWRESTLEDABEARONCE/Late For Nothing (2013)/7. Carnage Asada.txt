All these noises burst my eardrums.
All these noises burst my eardrums.

My eyes went black
But now I see them,
Iron blue.
Transcending static.
I see the colors,
I see them

And they bleed into one.
They bleed into one.

Frozen now,
Inside and out I am a heat wave.

Waterfalls,Â 
Ice in their mouth, I am a heat wave.

There is a change coming,
Primary colors blurring.
My eardrums burst in colors

And they bleed into one.
They bleed into one.

Frozen now,
Inside and out I am a heat wave.
Waterfalls,
Ice in their mouth, I am a heat wave.

There is change,
There is a change coming.

Primary colors, they bleed into one.
Primary colors bleed into one.
