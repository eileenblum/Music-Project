I've had a guide my whole entire life.
I lack the drive myself.

My passionâs gone,
Used to see stars.
The sky is dark.

Pick a message at this point I donât care.
Take the exit âcause weâre getting nowhere.
Signs are blurring I canât tell whatâs out there.
Take the exit âcause weâre getting nowhere.

I took the test,
it was a mess.

I spent my whole life on your right slumped in my seat
with my head down in my hands,
I didn't notice the scenery.

And now I realize I didn't take the time,
and now I see.

Exits leading nowhere.
Exits leading nowhere.

Pick a message at this point I donât care.
Take the exit âcause weâre getting nowhere.
Signs are blurring
I canât tell whatâs out there.
Take the exit âcause weâre getting nowhere.

Exit because weâre getting nowhere.
