Close your eyes
And align your palms and fingertips
And feed me your dreams and aspirations.

I have the power to read,Â 
To read your mind.

Nothingâs free.
I collect mine.

Is this the God that you asked for?
Iâm just a vessel in his name.
I am a parasite getting fat off incompetence and blame.

Then I peddle security,
So you can fall asleep at night.
The confidence you lack fuels me,
I think Iâm doing it alright.

I set out to poison them with the divine.
I scratch out their eyes to see through mine.

And when I die,
Iâm sure that Iâm going to Heaven.
You must pay the price to leave this life
And join me in Heaven
or burn in Hell.

Echoing with the gnashing teeth.
A burning lake waiting,Â 
Put silver in my head.

This is not my creation,
Iâm just a vessel in his name.
I am a sycophant of light.
The blood will wash my sins away.

I set out to poison them with the divine.
I scratch out their eyes to see through mine.

And when I die,
Iâm sure that I am going to heaven.
You must pay the price to leave this life
And join me in heaven.

It will end soon.
It will end soon.
It will end soon.
