Dead leaves on the ground!
When they were falling I held your hand
When they hit pavement I let them go
I run alone in the street, it's a dead end

Rubber, Punctured by nails
The rust is spreading, I must run fast now

Repeat, repeat, spoken in whispers
I can't buy anymore time to preserve the line
you have to fight to keep it going, I'm at loss

I'll cut my heart, i'll trust my gut
I'll cut my heart, I'll trust my gut
You try to draw a straight line
You make a circle every -

Repeat, repeat, keep pushing pens
Repeat, repeat push through paper
Repeat, repeat, it's a circuit
Repeat, repeat, this is real for me

(you've got to don't, don't, don't fight it)
You've got to stick your neck out
Don't fight that circuit anymore
It's not enough
You've got to stick your neck out
Don't fight that circuit anymore
It's not enough

Cut out my heart, I'll trust my gut
I'll trust my gut
I'll trust it

You tried to draw a straight line
You make a circle everytime

Circle never-ending
Circle never-ending
Circle never-ending
Circle never-ending

Repeat, repeat, keep pushing pens
Repeat, repeat, push through paper
This is not done...
