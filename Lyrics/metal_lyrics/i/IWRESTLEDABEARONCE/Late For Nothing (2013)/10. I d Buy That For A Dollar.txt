Lost in the depths of your mind vacant; distant.
Easy to close your eyes, your eyes for the auction.
You sell it on your back.
You can hardly protect yourself.
So accepting, they have your best intentions.

Admit defeat to me,
Cut up in a million pieces,Â 
Enclosed in packaging,Â 
You look so sweet filled with deceit.

You catch me armed to the teeth.
I will be the last one standing.

Your pleasure comes with a fee.
You look so cheap with the price youâre demanding.

I refuse to be that weak,
Itâs not enough.Â 
I refuse to be that weak.

You feel so pure when you spit it out,
It makes you so sick when you swallow,
Obsessed with flashing lights.

I refuse to be that weak.

Donât want it,Â 
Wonât become like you.Â 

A thing of beauty polished bright before itâs sold.
A dead-eyed girl will come to life when she is told.
A thing of beauty polished bright before itâs sold.
I promise I could break the mold,
I promise I could break the mold.

You feel so pure when you spit it out,
it makes you so sick when you swallow,
obsessed with the flashing lights.
