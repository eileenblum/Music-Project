Filthy
Born in a dust storm and brought up
up in a cloud
on the tops of trees

I was taught to distrust ideas opposing my thoughts
I was taught to distrust ideas opposing my thoughts
And you would be swayed, bending like branches and you would be played
A spark for the kindling, bending like branches, bending like branches now

Old ways die so slow, but we both know to reap and sow
They raised us not to grow, but we both know to reap and sow

Revel in darkness, revel in dirt
Excel in the muck and the mud
Crawling and creeping, waiting away for the turn, change in the air that I love
Feel it soon, harvest moon, won't you look up with me?
Children, you'll feel it soon, there is a harvest moon
Look with me, there is a harvest moon

Old ways die so slow, but we both know to reap and sow
They raised us not to grow, but we both know to reap and sow

Feel it soon, there is a harvest moon
Won't you look up with me?
There is a harvest moon
