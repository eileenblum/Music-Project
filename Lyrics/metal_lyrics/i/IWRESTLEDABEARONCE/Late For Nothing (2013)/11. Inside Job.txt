So sick;
The way,
you drown me in my sleep,
I dream of the way things were
when you consumed the consciousness I keep,Â 
the poisonous spell you've cast on me.

You feel the heat off my body,
You lift my feet off the ground.
You lie in wait just to prey upon my wants and needs.

A curse is leaving my body,
But I still want you around.
A sickly sweetness that brings me back down to my knees.

And now I know,
What a silly girl
Could love a man who could play a game.

A sickly sweetness that brings me back down to my knees.
A sickly sweetness that brings me back down to my knees.

My sin,
My skin is crawling with anticipation,
You send shivers
Down my spine keeping time to the click of my teeth.
I tell you I stay forever.

And I know now what a silly girl.
Who could love a man?

You feel the heat off my body,
You lift my feet off the ground.
You lie in wait just to prey upon my want and needs.

A curse is leaving my body,
But I still want want you around.
A sickly sweetness that brings me back down to my knees,

You feel the heat off my body,
I want you around.
The heat of my body, my body.
A curse is leaving my body,
I want it around,
Feel it leaving my body, my body.
