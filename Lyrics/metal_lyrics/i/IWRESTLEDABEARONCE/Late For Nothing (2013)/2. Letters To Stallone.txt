Not someone to...

I think mediocrity is this the key?
I can't I won't be I won't be sitting there now
break me out let me out

It's a sign of the times, there's nothing gain,
This world was never mine, it's not mine
I let the hive mind consume me,
I can feel them all moving, I can feel them all moving
I can feel...

Last night I saw a thousand faces in a line
And I could not recall a name
And I could not recall a time, When I...
I needed someone to move me
Not someone to save me
Just someone to move me
Not someone to ...

The perception that does not mean shit to me
I'm not a product of, I 'm not a product of my name
The perception that does not mean shit to me
I'm not a product of, I 'm not a product of my nameThe perception that does not mean shit to me
I'm not a product of you
