Don't be surprised if it hurts you,
I don't think I'm the one that you cling to when you can't handle it,
and now they've got you surrounded,
well I've found it,
I'm on my own.

And now they're telling me the life that I want was less important than the role that I'm playing,
yeah, they'll take away the things that I have 'cause on me it's just wasted,
and these days I'm alone, alone,
I know you can't recover this,
it's just a shame to waste away.

Well you can waste away,
recoil the rope as you spew silent notes and my bones will splinter from the fall,
I will recall with a smile on my face.

I am a stranger,
I cut ties,
it's not a problem,
it's a solution,
am I a fool to you,
postured so innocent so it would seem,
you cut off the head of your own reflection,
you cut off the head of it.

These days I'm alone, alone,
these days I'm alone, alone,
for the first time I see myself,
cutting my ties I'm finally free,
not strung along by my innocence,
well that didn't make sense to me.

These days I'm alone, alone,
I know you can't recover this,
it's just a shame that way,
these days I'm alone, alone,
I know you can't recover this,
it's just a shame.
