My departure from this place was just as hard spoken
Shade of blue
As throwing a fish back into dark waters
I remember how it felt
To concur other peoples minds and thoughts
Looking over heated shoulders
To see melting patterns as faces
That is when nothing mattered

When I get to where I am going
I'll thin it out for you
Paint over the memories
Every last fucking one of you

Sit so still now
Everyone
Poison

Hold your neck gracefully
Tearing like a child
A skyscraper about to fall
Collapsing, challenging the feeling of death...

Bruised of what you're all afraid of
The feeling of death
This prince he's cold
Cold and Blue
Like the 80's early 90's
Long Island
Summers will end at the very fall of you
Sit still at the sight of the loop
That no one will ever know...
