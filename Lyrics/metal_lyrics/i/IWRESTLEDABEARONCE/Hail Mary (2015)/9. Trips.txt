Was it an act of God that erased our humanity?
You're either dying or you're dead and alone.
I embrace the insanity.
The place where you made your stand.
It never mattered to them.
The man in black transforms us.
It never mattered to the hand.
The place where you made your stand.
It never mattered to the hand of God.
I'm thinking in the end. It might be better.
Can we transcend war with ourselves
If we think our Hell is Heaven?
I'm thinking in the end it might be better.
From the hand of God.
We are running out of time. A decision must be made.
They might be frayed but they're still detonate the bomb.
The hand of God.
Running out of time.
