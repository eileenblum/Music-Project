I know it well enough.
We are in the death throws.
I have to call you bluff.
You need your direction.
You want a static life. And I'm angry.
You want the same results without the same effects.
Repeat a dead science.
You beat the dead carcess.
This is insanity. It's not a plan for me.
You'd have me accept it. Too proud to respect it.
I'll burn this place to the ground.
Irresponsible to throw it away.
Secure it in the cold and decay.
This heart can't cease to beat.
I want it to shatter.
A thousand pieces strewn on the floor.
They're all around me.
They will unthaw inspiration.
If this is doomed to fail, I'd rather watch it burn.
I'll watch it burn.
What happened to you to make you bitter?
Too soon to accept that fate.
Too soon to pull the trigger.
You keep it secure in the cold.
I want it to shatter.
It's too soon to pull the trigger.
It's too soon to pull the trigger.
What happened to you to make you bitter?
It's too soon to pull the trigger.
