Stake My life on a smile.
Mouth is like Saccharine.
Behind the teeth incantations to punish them.

You want the monster don't you?
Your punishment controls you.
I'll step into the role.
Reverse the mirror.
Point it toward you.

The crime is existence.
A drop on the table cloth.
To exist in a spent world.
My creation is dangerous.

Your black and white.
I find this ugly.
My fingers - delicate
Can wrap around that neck.

Blame me for the ills of mankind. I'm not guilty.
You wanna see me swing I'm not guilty.
I'm taking you with me.

You curse the spot. All you see is the drop.
You're so caught up. I'm treacherous.

I don't do this for the ones, who suffered at your hands.
I don't do this for their love, it's not what they command.
I do it for myself, I'm here to purge the garden.

Lead me down to the river. I don't need your permission.
If you wanna play holy, I'll be the snake in the garden.
Blame me for the ills of mankind. I'm not guilty.
You wanna see me swing I'm not guilty.
I'm taking you with me.
You curse the spot. All you see is the drop.

You curse the spot. I'm not guilty.
I'm taking you with me.
I do this for myself and no one else.
