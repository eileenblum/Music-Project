Remain calm.
You're overcompensating to hide your moral failing.
I find you fascinating. This is all so fascinating.
You want no regulation.
You're Measuring the wrong thing.
No matter what you choose to weigh they all will be left waiting.
Hush my baby don't cry.
Rig the game. You can derail the narrative.
This is your righteous lullaby.
Conquer truth and you can derail the narrative.
This is your righteous lullaby.
Conquer truth and you can derail the narrative.
Open wider.
Let them suffer.
Puff out your narrow chest.
You're the king of nothing.
You play real cool.
Regulator.
Something greater.
Stimulate the point of hatred.
You're king of the void.
Master of nothing. King of the void.
You know the deck was stacked.
You know goddamn well that the deck, it was stacked.
