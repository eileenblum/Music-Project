The static life was not your intention
You want to wear me out and have me accept it
You try to protect yourself I know you hurt someone
I know to play that part I've learned to expect it
It's too soon to pull the trigger
It's too soon to pull the trigger
What happened to you to make you bitter
It's too soon to pull the trigger
Secure in the cold... is this what you do
Secure in the cold
If this is doomed to fail than I would rather burn
I would rather burn
I would rather burn
I would rather burn
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
If this is doomed to fail than I would rather burn
I would rather burn
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
