Come closer dear so you can hear me.
Give me your name. I'll speak it softly.
You will be consumed-closer.
Let it seep right through-Closer.
No reason to stand in the doorway.
It's been so long since we've had a visitor.
A room with no number and no name.
So long since we've fed off the innocent.
Put your hands on the barrier.
The imprint of the blood is your hands on the barrier.
The imprint of the blood is there.
When you first walked in it was holding you back.
It was my hand, I was holding you back.
Innocent is better when it's dead.
And my death is better when it's fed.
We all float here.
We're still floating. We all float down here.
No reason to stand in the doorway.
It's been so long since we've had a visitor.
A room with no number and no name.
It's been so long since we've fed off the innocent.
Put your hands on the barrier.
The imprint of the blood is in your hands on the barrier.
The imprint of of the blood is there.
