Slaughter the children. To Protect the father.
The blood to water.
Aware inside my body. Trapped in a pool of blood.
I dig my fingers in the open sores of the ones who've given up.
I hear them suffocate.
They are bloated. A waste of life.
Relax my hands. It's a blessing.
Their eyes turn up. I force mine down in the hole.
The gift of death is such a blessing for us.
Cut out my wicked eyes.
Gift of death.
Cut out my wicked eyes.
A gift is carved to hide the markings on palms.
A mask could hide the father.
Blood to water.
Blood to water.
Sacrifice like you do your daughters.
Blood to water. Blood to water.
Their eyes turn up. I force mine down.
The gift of death is such a blessing for us.
Sacrifice.
Cut out my wicked eyes. Wicked eyes.
