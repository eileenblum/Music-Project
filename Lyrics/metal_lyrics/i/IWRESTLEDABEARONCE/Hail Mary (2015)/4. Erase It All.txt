This is my mind. It's become inconsequential.
It's become an apparition.
It's becoming and affliction.
And I know that apathy is easier in life.
Practice your subservience and throw away your mind.
What more could we all ask for?
Take a hit and you'll want more.
No, I won't play.
I reject this life.
I would rather choke than let it inside.
Dear him calling for comfort.
In those eyes we are all whores.
Blacked out minds.
Swollen from the intentions.
Proper socialization is what will eviscerate us.
We are all whores in his eyes.
You tilt your head back. Try to take your medicine.
It falsifies the intentions of your enemies.
Tilt your head back. Try to take your medicine.
Force it open to ingest proper socialization.
Constrain the population.
No I won't play.
I reject this life.
I would rather choke than let it inside.
Hear him calling for comfort.
In those eyes we are all whores.
Failure destined.
Erected by the enemy.
Erase it all. Eject it now.
Top the chalice. No, not a drop is valid.
