This cannot stay alive. The lie in a hive mind.
Realize the faction won.
Your goal is Work.Buy.Die.
Just know I don't want your acceptance or your forgiveness.
I don't want a leader I just need a witness.
We carbon copy for your profit.
We tied our hands in tradition.
Unravel the thread that anchors me.
Deconstruct the fibres that are clinging.
You grieve for what's lost.
I grieve for what never was.
It always feels the same.
I want no part.
I know- Produce for yourself alone
That's probably why they hate you the most.
Existing to suck you dry
Take away from the host the substance.
You are a resource for them to harness.
I'm opposed to my function.
The veil is not my composition.
Unravel the thread that anchors me.
Deconstruct the fibres that are clinging.
In the chronicle you were a sentence.
Destroy the archive let them rebuild.
I don't need a leader I just need a witness.
I am opposed to my function.
Cut out the thread.
Done with antiquity in a dying system.
The scene. It had no love for me.
I don't exist in life a drone to Work.Buy.Die.
Believe in anything.
Typical.This Life.
Work.Buy.Die.
