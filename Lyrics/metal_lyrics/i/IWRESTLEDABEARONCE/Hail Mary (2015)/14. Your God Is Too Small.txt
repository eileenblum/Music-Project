When I was young I was taught God.
They equated their fear with a real love.
In time the dissonance becomes believable.
It is a constant reminder
That it grows.
My whole life.
A toxic shadow stays with me at the seams.
And I know it's insidious.
In the light still the outline stays with me at the seams.
And I know it's insidious.
You're fear is not enough.
It's cheap and it's meaningless.
The doubt has cast a shadow. Eroding my mind.
They treat it like a sickness.
They fear I am not contagious.
Realize your God is too small.
See the outline grow.
The flower is in bloom.
I see it underneath. A shadow sings to me that it grows.
My whole life. A toxic shadow stays with me at the seams.
And I know it's insidious.
In the light still the outline stays with me at the seams.
And I know it's insidious.
Rip out all the seams. Let it breathe.
Fear is not the same thing.
Your God is too small.
There's blood on the pages, right where his name is.
