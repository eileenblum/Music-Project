"Happy birthday, merry unbirth, merry unbirthday
Happy birthday, merry unbirth, merry unbirthday"
She's a beaten dog
With yellow nails
I just would like to let you know
That I got deep enough around
At carving away at your skin
Spinning around
Spitting and laughing in my face
Spinning around
Spitting and what I found were alarm clocks
You started biting at your fingernails
To prove we're not breathing
I'll awake from sleep to give a kiss
The killer is gone tonight
But isn't it better to question our love?
Not it's not, it never was
Why do I find pieces of your teeth on piano keys?
