What do I deserve?
We were two of a kind
You can't help but feel emotionless
When you're the one standing
Watching from the outside
I never had to care
I never had to worry
But I never stopped to think
I never stop thinking
She knows so much
I wish I could scoop up the ones I love
And place them far away
Certain songs ring aloud
Make your mind wonder about better times
Everyone come to one
Everyone wants what no one gets
And that's why they don't
They want more
That's why the world may come to an end
I will be the one sitting at the edge of the rock
Waiting to be invited in
