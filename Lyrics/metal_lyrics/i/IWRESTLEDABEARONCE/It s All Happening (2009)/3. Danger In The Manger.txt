To prove my reason for living this fucking life
I will not walk these streets unclothed tonight
You'll have to catch me
When I run away
I'm never coming back
When I run away from myself
Remind me to fill your heart with gunpowder
To end it all
Coming back when you're still
You shatter to pieces
I'm never coming back
I'm never coming back
I could scream
I could shout
I could set this room on
Let you out
And no one will tell me
Hail to this, plain to see
I could - not
I could - shatter
I could - better
I could - not
I could - shatter
Begging for a lift
What I'm packing put away
To prove the reason to fill your heart
Could give it a shot
To forgive myself
