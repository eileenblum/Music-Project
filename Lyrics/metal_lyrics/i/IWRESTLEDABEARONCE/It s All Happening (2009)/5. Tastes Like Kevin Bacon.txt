You'll wait it out
Force is not the same
I bought ya
This world will explode
Into numb, one deal owned
Pray for your sons and your daughters- You didn't refuse
Well the first one
Weak arms- Right or wrong
First off, we'll dance when we dance
The last one we fault
The first one we kill
Foresee her
That's what we've done with your head
You're begging for papa
We're safer but
We wash our hands in death
When we fall
He'll go
Feel it grow
We may not be the ones
Feel it go
Feel like we know
We move around
We'll pay
We protest
We'll pawn off war
We protest
We all hit the floor
Right or wrong
Ignorance at it's best
We are at war
You're such a fool
Ignorance isn't bliss
We are lied to
You suckers
Everyone, this is not a joke
In the end all suffer for what we've done
Liars
We all suffer
