I am running faster.
Faster than you can believe.
You think you could just
Grow into something new.
I think there's something you should know
I think there's something you should know
Staring into a wall
I think there's something you should know
I didn't pay to become this way
My head throbs
Til it bursts
There is something inviting
About staring into a wall
Covered in lead
You just want to jump into it
Diabolical minds think alike
Somewhere you don't belong
And the smell of an unwashed dog
No more licks on the lips from now on
Some things don't last forever
Somewhere you don't belong
Hope it takes you
Getting away with murder
Staring at a wall
