Oh

Giving up is not an option
For I have too much to live for, oh

Too much to live for

[x2:]
But how can I find the strength
When death surrounds me?

Carry me through
Because all I need is you
Carry me through
Because you're all
That's left of me now

From your love I'm saved
In my worst nightmares
I found you
My heart is yours
Softly now it beats once more
The end seems so near
But again my heart beats once more
My heart beats once more
Let's go

Sleepless nights
Of dreaming about you
May this be my salvation
May this be my salvation
Just for tonight
I want to know that I'll be alright
Eeyo

I want to know that I'll be alright

From your love I'm saved
In my worst nightmares
I found you
My heart is yours
Softly now it beats once more
The end seems so near
But again my heart beats once more
My heart beats once more


And when the time comes
I will then know
Oh

[x2:]
By a death or a miracle
It will be my escape

From your love I'm saved
In my worst nightmares
I found you
My heart is yours
Softly now it beats once more
The end seems so near
But again my heart beats once more
My heart beats once more

From your love I'm saved
(From your love I am saved)
In my worst nightmares
I found you
My heart is yours
(My heart is yours)
Softly now it beats once more
(Once more)
