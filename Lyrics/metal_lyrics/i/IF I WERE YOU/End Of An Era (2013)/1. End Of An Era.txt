This all ends now
Eaah

Let go of everything
No longer will I stand idle
As this life
Passes me by
(Passes me by)

What's the point
Of living life without a meaning?
Always lost and never to be found again
Take a moment
And realize what could have been
Is this what you've been dreaming of?

This is my destiny
My only way out
I can't help myself from falling down

Holding my existence
I'm taking control
I will never let go
This is all I fucking have

What's the point
Of living life without a meaning?
Always lost and never to be found again
Take a moment
And realize what could have been
Is this what you've been dreaming of?

Life seems like a dream
And I can't escape
I've lost it all
Please wake me up

[x4:]
Is this what you've been dreaming of?

[x4:]
Wake me up
