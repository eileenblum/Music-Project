It makes me sick!!!
It makes me sick to know the truth.
All of your lies are starting to unfold.
You will never be, more than what you are.
Wake up wake up, it's not a dream.
Wake up wake up, and then you'll see,
What you have become.
What you have become. [x2]
MOVE!!!
Just keep living your fantasy, but this is the reality.
You will not find anybody to..
Worship you now. [x2]
Wake up wake up, its not a dream.
Wake up wake up, and then you'll see,
What you have become.
What you have become. [x2]
Wake up wake up [x2]
Does it make you smile
When you turned your back and walked away? (walked away)
Are you still searching for your heart; your mind.
Believe me this isn't easy. (believe me!)
This isn't easy.
This isn't easy for me.
But tonight i am following my heart.[x2]
Wake up wake up [x2]
