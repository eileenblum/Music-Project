Move
Well, come on

I built this wall
To protect me from all
Of your personalities
You left me to die
I should have never believed
Your pathetic... lies

You broke these walls
(These walls)
You left me to die

So say something to make me feel
Like I am worth something
Like I am even real
Did I ever make you proud?

Looking back I can finally see
You and I were never meant to be
Meant to be

So say something to make me feel
Like I am worth something
Like I am even real
Did I ever make you proud?

So say something to make me feel
Like I am worth something
Like I am even real
Did I ever make you proud?

Think of me when you have nothing left
Think of me when you fall apart
You left me here full of despair
But now I can say...

I don't give a fuck about you
And all the shit you put me through
(Through, through)
I swear to God
(I swear to God)
Your time is up
And by tonight
You will have nowhere to run
Bleah

So say something to make me feel
Like I am worth something
Like I am even real
Did I ever make you proud?
(Make you proud)

Oh-o-oh-oh
Did I ever make you proud?
