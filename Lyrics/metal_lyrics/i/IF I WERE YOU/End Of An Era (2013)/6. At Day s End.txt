Fuck this pain, I've been through worse.
Fuck your lies, I've had enough of you.
EYO!!!
I will rise [x2]
Amongst the darkness I have found light.
I've found the reasons to move on.
You will not be the death of me.
High in the sky I will soar.
I hope your satisfied now. I hope that your right. [x2]
At days end you'll realize
All the things you have forgotten and the things you have lost.
I'm sorry you couldn't feel the same.
I could have gave you life. (could have gave you life).
Now ill take your fucking breath away. [x2]
At days end you'll realize
All the things you have forgotten and the things you have lost. [x2]
And although its tough
Thinking of you is never enough. [x2]
I'm moving on, because you gave up on everything.
At days end you'll realize
All the things you have forgotten and the things you have lost.
YOU HAVE LOST!!
