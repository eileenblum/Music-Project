It's the end of the line
You have run out of time
Save your breath for the next one
Because you are worthless (you are worthless)
To me

Read between the lines
I can see right through you
Like a ghost in the mirror
You will never feel alive

Read between the lines
I can see right through you
Like a ghost in the mirror
You will never feel alive

Don't even bother to explain
I know your true intentions
They are far from pure (they are far from pure)

I have said this before
Over and over again
I have said this before
Are your intentions pure
I have said this before
Over and over again

Read between the lines
I can see right through you
Like a ghost in the mirror
You will never feel alive

Read between the lines
I can see right through you
Like a ghost in the mirror
You will never feel alive

Alive

You will never feel alive
