The light slowly escapes the room
All alone I will wait for someone like you
to come and lead me out of the dark

[Chorus:]
Can you save me from what I've become,
'cause I can't do this on my own
I need you here with me
Hold on to me; on to me

Can I be dreaming?
Is there something I'm missing?
I'm starting to sink and it's getting harder to breathe
I need your voice, I need your touch
Please take my hand; take my hand

[Chorus]
