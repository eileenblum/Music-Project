Oh

These voices are haunting me
These voices are haunting me

I created this monster
(This monster)
The fault is my own
Live up to my actions
Or drown with regret
Haunting me from the inside out

Forever I'll be lost
Forever in decay
Forever I'll be lost
Forever in decay

These voices are haunting me
These voices are haunting me
And I know
That I'll never escape this hell
Inside of my head
Just show me how to forget
Oh, I swear I can't forget
These memories that lead me back to you

Wo-o-o-o-oh

I'm holding onto something that I feel
That I feel
Remind myself that it wasn't even real

Fuck

I have to find a place in my mind
Somewhere I feel safe all the time

Fate wont take the best of me
As long as I'm still breathing
I'll find my way home
I'll find my way home

Fate won't take the best of me
As long as I'm still breathing
I'll find a way out
Of this emptiness I hold within

Wo-o-o-o-oh

I hold within

These voices, they haunt me
These voices always follow me
