Let's go

Look in the dark sky tonight
At how the bright stars align
Now, tell me how you feel
Because something has changed

Inside your heart
And inside of mine
The sound of your cold voice
Amongst the bitter wind

Can you taste the autumn's air?
It's burning in your lungs
Forget summer's memories
It's time to move on
Will you always think of me?
Will you ever be the same?
Forget summer's memories
It's time to move on

I walk alone and I can't
Shake this feeling
So much time has passed
(Has passed)
Yet I've never been healing

As the fall leaves hit the ground
You make the softest sound

Can you taste the autumn's air?
It's burning in your lungs
Forget summer's memories
It's time to move on
Will you always think of me?
Will you ever be the same?
Forget summer's memories
It's time to move on

Please whisper to me one last time
Please whisper to me one last time
Bleah

Now I call out for you
But you will never hear this
The sound of your sorrow voice still echoes

The sound of your sorrow voice still echoes
Always through the hollow wind

The sun goes down
And my heart begins to fade
On these October nights
Here without you it's harder to breathe

Can you taste the autumn's air?
It's burning in your lungs
(In your lungs)
Forget summer's memories
It's time to move on

The sound of your sorrow voice still echoes
Always through the hollow wind
The sound of your sorrow voice still echoes
Always through the hollow wind
