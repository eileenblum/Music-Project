How could we not see everything?
How could we not see everything
That was there for us in the first place?
We were so blind.
Times have changed but so can we [x2]
Lets get out of this town, and we can run forever (forever).
Lets move on to another place, and live without regret.
Don't ever forget.
Promise me we can get this right.
Promise me your heart, and your honesty.
LETS GO!
This is all for you.
This is all for us. (OH!)
Lets get out of this town, and we can run forever (forever).
Lets move on to another place, and live without regret.
Don't ever forget.
Your the only thing that matters to me now [x2]
EYO!!
Where we are is all that matters now.
How we love is all that matters now
Lets get out of this town, and we can run forever (forever).
Lets move on to another place, and live without regret.
Don't ever forget [x2]
Oh my god!, this is our last chance! [x2]
