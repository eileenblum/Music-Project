I hope you find your way
Because I never found mine

You play this game so well
The truth from you
(From you)
Is hard to tell
How can you sleep at night?
How can you act like I don't exist?
How can you sleep at night, bitch?

What once was reality
Now just a memory
I've reached the breaking point
(The breaking point)

I hope you find your way
Because I never found mine

When you realize what you've done to me
It will be too late
I promised to wait
But forever's too long
How can you be so fake?
How can you be so fake?

So fucking fake
Bweah

What once was reality
Now just a memory
I've reached the breaking point
(The breaking point)

I hope you find your way
Because I never found mine
Now I'm stuck in the past
With everything you've said
Because I never found mine

I prayed for you
But you never fucking called
(Never called)
You have my heart and now I'm walking away
And if this is the end
You're dead...
You're dead to me
You're dead to me

I hope you find your way
Because I never found mine
Now I'm stuck in the past
With everything you've said
Because I never found mine
