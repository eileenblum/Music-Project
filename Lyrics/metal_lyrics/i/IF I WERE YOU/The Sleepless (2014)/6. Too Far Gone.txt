I'm better off dead!

do you know what its like to be me?
I'm walking this path so close and yet I feel nothing.
set me free.
release me from myself.
there is no time to lose.
I've got nothing left and I fear the worst.
I fear myself.
I fear my soul.

Just cast them aside.
Please pay no mind to the voices in my head.
I think I'm better off dead!
throw me to the wolves.
I'm too far gone.
say it again, say it again!
I think I'm better off fucking dead.

the darkness in my head is as dark as this cold night sky.
so, get the fuck out of my way. (of my way!)
how can I trust myself when I'm losing my fucking mind?
I'm losing control.
this can't be real.

Just cast them aside.

I think I'm better off dead!
throw me to the wolves.
I'm too far gone.
say it again, say it again!
I think I'm better off. [2x]
I think I'm better off dead.

I'm losing control.
I'm losing my mind.
this can't be real.

to the ocean floor my soul sinks.
I'm so scared to breathe and all I have is myself.
drifting endlessly, no one can save me now.

let go!
I'm too far gone. [2x]
there's no way out.
just let go.
I'm too far gone. [2x]
there's no way out.
just fucking let go!
