abusing your power and misusing your words.
betraying the trust of the people who need you the most.
satisfaction comes at a price, but when is it enough?
heavy lies the crown!
its not too late to change, but this is who you are.

so, when they start to realize and they all leave your side, will you remember?
will you ever see the monster you've become?

oh, how the times have changed.
an honest man now wears the crown of shame.
you left us here to drown.
tell me, are you happy now?

look in the mirror.
what do you see? [2x]
a man worth dying for?
or an illusion of leadership?

so, when they start to realize and they all leave your side, will you remember?
will you ever see the monster you've become? [2x]

get up and step down.
this is where it ends for you.
we are the innocent ones and we won't be brought down anymore.
tonight your reign is done
heavy lies the fucking crown!
heavy lies your heart of stone.
heart of stone.

buried with your thoughts you'll remain.
buried with your sorrow you'll always remain.
