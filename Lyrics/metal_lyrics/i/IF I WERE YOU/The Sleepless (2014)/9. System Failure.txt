all alone now.
I can feel the walls start to cave on me now.
and I have no place left to go.

I feel the walls behind me.
they're closing in around me.
I feel the weight within me.
crushing my bones inside me.
I can't rely on faith this time.
you have failed me.
you have let me down.
I won't tell myself that I am fine.

its like I'm falling away from everything I know.
is this whats left of me?
holding on to something that was never real.
will you be there to catch me?
cause' I'm drowning; I'm fading.
I'm losing grip on reality.
reaching out for someone to save me.

suffocating under the pressure, I'm dying for one last chance.
just one more breath!
my memories are useless.
no matter how hard I try, I will never be free from this torture.
I will never feel alive again.
my memories are toxic.
my memories kill me.

its like I'm falling away from everything I know.
is this whats left of me?
holding on to something that was never real.
will you be there to catch me?
cause' I'm drowning; I'm fading.
I'm losing grip on reality.
reaching out for someone to save me. (save me)

as my eyes roll back in my skull, the life leaves my body.
system failure! [2x]
where were you when I needed you?
I'm afraid its too late.
so, say your last goodbye.
