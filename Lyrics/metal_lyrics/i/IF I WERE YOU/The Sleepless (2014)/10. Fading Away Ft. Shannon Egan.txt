your eyes have a way to cut right through me.
you see all of me.
its like time stands still.
can this be real?
or is this just a dream?
cause' I don't want to wake up if you're not here.

you're falling away.
away from me.
please just stay.

hold onto memories when I'm gone.
I swear ill make it back to you. (back to you)
keep these words in your mind and my love for you inside.
I swear ill make it back to you.

[Shannon]
can you see me now?
can you hear my voice?
I'm calling out your name, but you're just fading away.
how can I go on without your touch?
I feel so far from you
its hard not to fall apart, but we're not like the rest of them.
we were always meant to be.

hold onto memories when I'm gone.
I swear ill make it back to you. (back to you)
keep these words in your mind and my love for you inside.
I swear ill make it back to you.

no matter how far apart, you're always in my heart.
but we're not like the rest of them.
we were always meant to be.
no matter how far apart, you're always in my heart.

hold onto memories when I'm gone. (when I'm gone)
I swear ill make it back to you. (back to you [2x]
keep these words in your mind and my love for you inside.
I swear ill make it back to you.
back to you!
