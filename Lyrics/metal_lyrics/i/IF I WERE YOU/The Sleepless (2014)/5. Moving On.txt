just don't waste your time and don't waste your breath.
you've had your chance and now there's nothing left.
can't you see what you've become?

I should have seen that look in those eyes.
I should have seen the way that you smiled.
there is something inside of you!

just remember, I can see, I can see right through you.
all alone is how you'll always be.
a heart of stone will get you nowhere.
you only have yourself to blame.
I can see, I can see right through you.
an empty shell of what you used to be.
keep in mind "I'm sorry" is too late.
you only have yourself to blame.

how can you be so blind?
nothing in this world is perfect.
well, I've learned from my mistakes, but you will never learn.

if you think you can fuck with my heart and walk back in my life,
then you have another thing coming.
you are so worthless bitch!
what did I even see in you?
nothing more than a memory.
oh, how I wish I could turn back time.
maybe then you would finally see what you have become.

I can see, I can see right through you.
all alone is how you'll always be.
a heart of stone will get you nowhere.
you only have yourself to blame.
I can see, I can see right through you.
an empty shell of what you used to be.
keep in mind "I'm sorry" is too late.
you only have yourself to blame.

realize this is all your fault.
I've grown so tired of this game.
I'm not sorry for anything anymore.
you only have yourself to blame.
I'm moving on! [4x]
