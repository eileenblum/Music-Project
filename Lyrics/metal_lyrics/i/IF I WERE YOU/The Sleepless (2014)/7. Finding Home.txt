all my life I wanted to be so much more.
I'm tired of being second best.
maybe this is just a test, but how can I continue?
I'm destined to fail.
always fading to black.
just let me go.

all we are is just ghosts now.
empty and hollow.
can you hear our hearts screaming out? (screaming out)
all we want is to feel whole again.
whole again.

a hollow heart and an empty soul is all that I have.
I can't pretend to be someone that I'm not.
in the end remember, I found my home.
this is where I always belonged.

all we are is just ghosts now.
empty and hollow.
can you hear our hearts screaming out? (screaming out)
all we want is to feel whole again.
whole again.

is it pointless now to keep holding on?
my heart starts to sink to the dark below.
will you even remember my face when I'm gone?
I took the easy way out.
please just let me go.
just let me fucking go!
and forget my name.

is it pointless now to keep holding on?
my heart starts to sink to the dark below.
will you even remember my face when I'm gone?
I took the easy way out.
please just let me go.

just let me go. [2x]
