constant lies echo through my head as I lie awake lifeless.
there is more to life than this!
I am to be made, I am to be made new.

fuck all what I once knew.
now there is no turning back.

as far as I can see, this was meant to be.
hiding from the truth and hiding from myself.
keeping all these thoughts locked inside my head, that all ends now.
that all ends now! [2x]

this is my life and this is my heart.
ill fight for what I believe in.
don't fucking give in now! [2x]
