just hope for a future and prevail this fight.
I have the strength to carry on, but how long must I feel this way?
I've grown so bitter about you.
it was something you always knew.
can we forget these words?
or is it too late?

the past is dead, but I won't bury you.
from now on my life won't ever be the same.
haunted by visions, this can't be the end of me, no not tonight.

I don't want to waste away.
these nightmares always get the best of me.
don't give up on me, cause' all I need is your voice to salvage all hope I have.

this is who I am now, for better or for worse.
this is my burden and I can't turn back the clocks.
you won't get the best of me. [2x]
this is my destiny!

this is my destiny.
I can't hold back now.
this is my salvation.

I don't want to waste away.
these nightmares always get the best of me.
don't give up on me, cause' all I need is your voice to salvage all hope I have.
all hope I have. [2x]

carry me away from here.
I can't hold back.
can't hold back.

this is a new beginning.
the past is fucking dead.
I won't ever go back.
I can't ever go back!
