we are the sleepless!

and when the daylight starts to die, who will be left to save?
is this real or just a dream?
real or just a dream?
I hope that one day this will end.
I don't know how much I can take.
keep me close; reach for me.

this is for the broken.
this is for the fallen.
for the fallen!

and when the blood starts to pump through your veins,
you'll remember this is not a dream.
oh my god, is this the end of everything that I know?
I can't see whats in front of me.
can you keep me from stumbling?
just breathe, just breathe.
will I ever find my way back home?
I'm so lost.
I need some guidance now.

we are so alone.
we are, we are the sleepless!
we are so alone.
we are sleepless!
we are so alone.
we are so insane!

oh my god, is this the end of everything that I know?
I can't see whats in front of me.
can you keep me from stumbling?
just breathe, just breathe.
will I ever find my way back home?
I'm so lost.
I need some guidance.

hope is all I have, but will it be enough? (be enough)
only time will tell.
this is the end of everything we know.
this is the end!

as the sun starts to rise, who will be left to fight? [2x]
