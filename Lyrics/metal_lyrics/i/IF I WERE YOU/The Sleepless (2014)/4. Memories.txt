can you take away this pain that I've been holding onto?
I can't get out of this hole.
these pictures and memories are all I have left.
why did you have to go?

I try, I try to get you out of my mind, but to no avail, you're always there.
why can't I forget you?
I have to forget you!
I have to find a way.
sleepless nights, I know them all too well.
and here alone, I think of you. (I think of you)

can you take away this pain that I've been holding onto?
I can't get out of this hole.
these pictures and memories are all I have left.
why did you have to go?

it wasn't enough to always be by your side.
you always wanted what I couldn't give to you.
so, fuck an apology now!
you left me stranded and broken here.
broken.

can you take away this pain that I've been holding onto?
I can't get out of this hole.
these pictures and memories are all I have left.
why did you have to go?

where have you gone?
I need you so bad.
what have I done?
I need your voice.
take me away.
so far away from here.

can you take away this pain that I've been holding onto?
I can't get out of this hole. (out of this hole)
these pictures and memories are all I have left.
why did you have to go? (have to go)
