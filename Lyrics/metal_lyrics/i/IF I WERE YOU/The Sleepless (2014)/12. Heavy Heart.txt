an empty heart won't get you very far.
you're drowning in your own mind.
it seems so easy to end the pain, but if you do there's no coming back.
have hope and trust in my voice.
there's so much to live for!

please don't give up yet.
there is more to this I know.
when your final breath seems near, just know that I'm here.
you're not alone tonight.
when your final breath seems near, just know that I'm here.

desperate to feel alive again, you seek death.
and to think that its the only answer breaks my heart.
I'm sorry it has to be this way, but as long as I live I will fight for you.
I will fight with you!
no one should feel this emptiness.
no one should feel this way.

please don't give up yet.
there is more to this I know.
when your final breath seems near, just know that I'm here.
you're not alone tonight.
when your final breath seems near, just know that I'm here.

close your eyes.
take a deep breath.
is this what you really wish for? [2x]

is this life so dark that it has to end?
nothing even feels real anymore and everything feels numb.
well, my friend I'm here to tell you that you will heal.
hold on and don't ever look back. (look back)
hold on! [2x]
and don't ever look back.

please don't give up yet.
there is more to this I know.
when your final breath seems near, just know that I'm here.
you're not alone tonight.
when your final breath seems near, just know that I'm here.
