Our lives were spent recluse from the outer world â
forging your ambitions, funding your decisions against our own intentions.
Does the gold help you now?
My land is now in ruins, a pillaged inquisition.
Iâve witnessed and Iâve lost it all â What curse is upon me to bring such dread to this place?
Saradomin, Saradomin - answer my prayers.
Guthix, Guthix - find me balance.
Zamorak, Zamorak â Iâm desperate for strength.
Oh, I call to you Gods - I beg of thee
for the darkness and the light to protect meâ¦
An Imcando dwarf - a servant I shall be.
You gave me life.
I found a purpose to serve and create.
I found my reason, I found my fate.
â¦A time for new beginnings.
â¦The end of an era.
