Climbing your way back through
the distance, the cold, itâs pressuring you.
Icicles pierce through the skin. The rope itâs twisting.
Youâre falling.
Who can hear your cries for help?
No one
Nothing
You are alone - isolated.
You are alone but not trapped forever,
Release.
Light is above, arms reach for the skies.
Underground is your past full of lies.
â¦A new beginning, a youthful life.
Time weeps slowly preparing your sacrifice.
Youâre conscious â slowly fading.
The sands of time are breaking.
Your face is masquerading,
A grandeur transformation.

Revive the worlds lost nations.
Left only for the sacred,
Left for the one true master.
You are now immortal.
