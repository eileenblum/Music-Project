A place in time where one was two.
The night reveals the silhouette of you.
The stars above shine in the skies, the lunar light glows in your eyes.
When will we find graceful solitude?

All I want now is your love and now we have to drift apart.

The roadâs been long.
These past two months.
Though I shall wait â the time will come.
