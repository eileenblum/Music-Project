Mother - Put the blade down.
Don't take us with you.
We're not alone.
The state of psychosisâ¦
We will overcome.
Mother - Put the blade down.

Father - Look what you've done.
Why did you leave us?
We're dying tonight.
She gave into temptation.
She lost all love.
She lost all hope.
She took our lives.
