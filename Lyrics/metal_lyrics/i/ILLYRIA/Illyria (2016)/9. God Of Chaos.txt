[Chaos:]
Let them bathe in blood.
High above, theyâve been there too long.
In given time, my reign shall come.
The bringer of chaos has now returned.
The stronghold of Lumbridge shall perish and burn.

[Chaos:]
The flag of horns shall rise today.
The price of light now has to pay.
Justice: I have daunted this day.
The darkness now brought forth, before my eyes.

[Chaos:]
Devour the day. We conquer tonight.

[Both:] Now is the end of your life.

[Chaos:]
The flag of horns shall rise today.
The price of light now has to pay.
