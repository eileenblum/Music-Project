The month has passed, temptation is strong.
Will I see your face again?
The screen is an illusion.
Iâve missed you more than ever before.
This distance is eternal.
My return is evermore.

â¦And I will wait for the night.
An everlasting sleepâ¦
When you are here with meâ¦
When you are in my dreamsâ¦

â¦And I will wait for the day.
An evanescent heat...
Out of the cold summerâ¦
Once again weâll meet.
