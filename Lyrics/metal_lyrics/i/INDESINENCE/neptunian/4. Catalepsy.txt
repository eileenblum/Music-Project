Gravity-defying state
Suspended, in trance, downwards
The quiet below overwhelms
The obscurity above overwhelms

Benumb beyond belief
Entranced into relief
In estatic lethargy
Blissful deceit

Pendular motion, a glimpse of light
Lost admidst the vast and livid sky
There was rust in the needle
There is rust in the hooks

Render, surrender
Naked and aghast
Behold your soul drifting away
Rendered, surrendered
Naked and aghast
Watching your essence rotting away
