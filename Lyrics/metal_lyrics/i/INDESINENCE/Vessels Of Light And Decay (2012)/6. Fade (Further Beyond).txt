[I The Banishing]

The visions might have appeared in a lucid dream
Space feels eternal, the trance must have settled in
Gazing straight into the ether to unearth the key
Motionless for hours yet miles away from here

The gateway now behind, and the Mysteries far ahead
As the trees close in above me, no one left by my side
The pinnacle looks furthest, still I relish the path
To ensnarement and latitude, away from shame and doubt

To transcend the bounds of consensus reality
And to cherish the nascent cognitive liberty

I traverse further above, then further down to rebuild
Clouds begin to disperse, as abstract truths are revealed
Surviving trials of an age, uprooted within inner depths
Their bright shadow echoing in the dark splendour of the universe

To abide all fear and embrace the mystery
As we savour the flesh of untold possibility

To reveal, to revive, to be at cause
To shatter the illusion of complacence and vice
To face the unfamiliar and bend the linear
To never take a seat at the play of chance

I beseech thy effigy to indulge me this once
Maul and crush my body and blow my mind

[II The Sphere]

Illuminated or buried in life
I flee the claws of self-deceit
And, free from the shackles of conceit and vanity
To will, to live and to defy insanity
To trance-migrate into states of divinity
To feel the force of the uncertain and Vital

The sphere is turning, its dark maw wide open
The spurious light that once blinded now frozen
Quod est inferius, est sicut quod est superius
Thus is the glory of the world begotten
Ubique Daemon - ubique Deus
My bloodstream the ink to a contract eternal
Into the vast, freer than ever, I fall

[III The Children Of Coma]

The children of coma
Crammed into a corner
They've noticed my presence
They are staring at me

Their eyes cut the darkness
Their laughter breaks the silence
They've noticed my presence
They are smiling at me

Their eyes slice the darkness
Their laughs infest the silence
They've noticed my presence
They are seeing into me
