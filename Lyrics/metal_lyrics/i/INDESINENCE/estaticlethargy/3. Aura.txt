Sanctum, sanctorum

It is late and the grey is closing in
Outside, and the scent is creeping in
Silently, flowing
Awash, awaiting, breathing

Boundless beauty unveils
Beneath an ageless wisdom
Beneath her decaying skin
Perfection revealed, untouched

Awash, awaiting, breathing

Touch gentle as air
Limbs naked and frail
Opened to you, an altar
Endless, timeless

Let us shut the doors and turn down the blinds
In praise of blindness
And dance under neon lights
In tribute of agelessness

We will bring her back together

The world is taking so long to die
"Le demon aussi etai un ange avant"
(the Devil himself was once an angel)
