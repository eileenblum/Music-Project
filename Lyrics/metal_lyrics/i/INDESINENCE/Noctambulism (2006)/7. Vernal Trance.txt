Underneath fading gleams of sunlight
Guided by the scent of a morbid spring tide
Summoned on the stairs, so young yet knowing
They wait to heed the call

Curiosity awaken
Libertine, unhallowed craving for dark and foul pleasures to come
Mesmerized by the majesty of the rock
Climbing ever higher to face the wind

Walking bare feet through endless halls of stone
Dreaming, so gracious, even if time has stopped
Standing aghast, so pure, upon the rock
They ascend
They transcend
To pass

And all that's left is to wonder if the day also turns to night
And flowers bloom and rot on the other side
And what is means, and what it's like to die
Though we once dreamt of tomorrow, tonight we dream of nothing

They left us
They left us in wait
They left

They left us
They left us awaiting and gasping
They left us wondering
They left
And made us to wake
