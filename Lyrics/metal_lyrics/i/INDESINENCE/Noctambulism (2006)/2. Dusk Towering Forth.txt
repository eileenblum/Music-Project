A new dawn beckons
A new day to relinquish
All splendour's flown by
The dusk is nigh

Its presence is vast
It repels the sun, which graciously exits
To stage its death

Onwards and forth
So alive

Gently engulfing all that lives and dies
O stygian mirth
The dusk is nigh

It quietly exits to stage its demise
The pillow will play the guide
The horror, so alive

Onwards and forth
Towering
So alive

Like shapes they assemble
Tangible, sombre, amoral
In ceremonial silence, to observe and admire
The delights of helplessness, and remain
Perplexed, transfixed, in joyous awe

The horror, so alive
