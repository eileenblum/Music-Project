Formed into being,
one to sixteen
Floating within,
blind and serene

From grain onto limbs
springs the timeless beat
Among webs of skin
all sensing begins

Swimming the depths
through the wellspring of waves
Morphing through the days,
each second it awakes

Shapes unseen linger through unopened eyes
Echoes from beyond, the first muted cry

[Lead: Andy]

Has it been days,
or aeons unending
The tremors, the haze
The shrinking, expanding
Unconscious yet afraid
Shrinking, expanding
The tremors, the haze
Ascending, descending

Transcending the zone
Departing the dome
The journey is on
The moment has come

[Lead: Christopher]

The light and the space overwhelm
Among laughter, tears and bells
Released from the primal shell
Halcyon embryo limbo, fare well
