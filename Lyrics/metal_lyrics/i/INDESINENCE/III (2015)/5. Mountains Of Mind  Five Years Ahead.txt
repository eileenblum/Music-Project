To conquer the summits that rise
as the old world dwindles behind
As flesh and spirit acclimatize ,
the ultimate trial has begun

They tower and loom above,
frightful and divine
Impossible is their magnitude,
eerie their skylines

[Leads: Andy]

Serpentine their pathways,
bereft of any signs
The winds, they never slacken
at the mountains of mind

Odyssey of vastness,
perilous ascent
Watching each step,
aware of every breath

Disembodied at heights unreal,
each vital move an act of will

Fatigue the watchful enemy,
fear the greatest thief
Sleep the deadliest luxury
and the mightiest of reliefs

Out of air, the final leap
Eyes aghast at the miracle
A shroud of clouds reveal the pinnacles

[Lead: Andy]
[Leads: Robert]

The spirit is exhausted yet high
when you've made the climb
The world feels ancient but awake
atop the mountains of mind
Vertigo reigns but the soul is at peace
The body shattered yet floating in a dream
Shaking, in a trance, from limb to limb
Eyes in disbelief at vistas unseen

Returning seems easy but futile
when you've crossed the line
Life and death, pleasure and pain
are as one at the mountains of mind

[Lead: Ilia]
