It breeds deep inside,
every season, every night
It breathes, tarnishing life, retching 
with passion as it locks the blinds

[Lead: Ilia]
[Leads: Andy]

Its breath smells like the earthbound flesh
of the muse the years buried alive
Its touch scars like the tender hands
of an angel sent to save with a knife

It seeds its deathly weed
It branches with every bleed
It heals by spreading deceit 
It soothes like hallowed ice
on infected teeth

It shines like a blade
Its smile conceals the maw
of the wrath

Enslaving the mind
through the pathways of life
Erecting the void as it goes down
deeper to suck off all light

Leeching onto life's hopes
Aging as we age
Plaguing them with voices
Hiding as we search
Prolonging the orexis
Thriving on the rage

Through ages feasting
on heart and soul
Joyous are those of strength
to excise it whole

[Lead: Ilia]
