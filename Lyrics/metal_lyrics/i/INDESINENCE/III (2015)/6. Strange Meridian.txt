[Lead: Illia]

Hail this new days on a passing life,
planning the journey as the ship arrives
Strange meridian, ever in sight,
gloaming through darkness, unseen by light

Drunk with ideals, we watch bridges burn
High on visions as we trawl the sands
Reaching crossroads as our minds go blank
Facing upward to avoid the swamps

Eyes deceived by mirages of stones
Times of change within static zones
Silent journeys to a place long gone
Miles ahead yet already home

Through days uncertain we venture out
Sitting through evenings of storm or drought
begging the heavens to dispel our doubts
This inner ember we can't go forth without

This timeless line to which we're bound
to forsake innocence for troves unfound,
to fear the future as we gaze around,
to dream of saviors and beware of hounds

And as the dark rains relieve our pain,
time seems to stretch then shrink again
Its hands keep turning behind our backs
The lights fade out but the road remains

And as our elder begin to sail
through twilight seas to their place of rest,
this strange meridian is lit within
Come what might, we can't relent

[Leads: Illia &amp; Gordon]

Come the summer, come the thaw,
come the great night to reap us all
and unveil a new sun with a joyful face
Still we plod through this fucking maze
without a map, with a broken rope,
forever dowsing for a glimpse of hope

[Leads: Gordon]
