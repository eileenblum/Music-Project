"The end of a child's pure soul, sold to evil shadows. It's the rise of Celith."

Far away in the night Fear in the dark
There_s no way to get (it) ride No reason why
Every Pray I_ve claimed from deep of my soul
Every pray brings harm
I am lost (in) hidden mirrors
I feel cold as I cry
(my) Wounded pride Seems forevermore
What_s justice after all?

(sleepless)
Howl down the wind
I just wait another time
Life_s been foolish, I_m frightened
Lost in my fate
the shades ripping into my mind
hearing evil voices I numb

So many nights I didn_t feel my eyes
So many nights I_ve tried to be stronger
I lied to death somewhere
Rise evil of mine

(shade)
Tonight a new life has begun
The sign of reason is broken together with a child_s pure soul
Her spirit tries to cry
Cry with eyes flames

Cry-It is all
Fly high your soul full of pain
