"The sorcerer Celith, full of unbounded rage, gets ally with the empire's enemies. Casting her doom spells against the emperor's armies, she can watch her people dying. Sweet vengeance."

Lost into her eyes, desiring her fate
Always a sin (an) abysm of hate
Through hidden souls in the realms of the damn
Hand in the screams from my mind

The spirit of the ancient
Inside my new home

It has been the raze for us all

I can see you suffering
In the hands of my spell

The curse lives on and on

(Shades)
Ringing for the silence
Dreaming on, Dreaming on
Ringing for the silence
Wait until they come

And I see the unknown
From the deep of her fate 
I can see her fire eyes
It's the dark of her soul 

Bring back all days of light
Growing into a daze 
Thus far the shadows were dead
But now I can't see the end 

We heard her call, (we) felt her embrace
Giving us fear, bringing us pain
Crossing the night, so many years
Queen of the time, Mistress of failure

"No, don't let her fire reach (the) confines of your dreams
Black Moon! Hiding her truth, attesting her cage
Smiting her land, cruelly with a smile
Shadows arise, coming for me"

"(Shades)
Create us, Drive us, make us part of your own
Leave us, Kill us, you are life for us"
