"Night remains night until the end of ritual of sacrifice. Every survivor of their fury was offered to all the gods of their faith. Screams of tortured souls together with a lake of blood complete the perfect scene of a cruel reality."

The sign of the Battle is
Ray of storms ripping the skies
Pray before the war begins
Feel the fury of river god

Rise the rite of the ancient guides
What is written along the time
Hell Beyond the infinity
It's a kind of Shaman's realm

Blood Springs on battlefield
Darkness is here this nighttime
(The) Clash of steel attack
is over 

Raging forces of enemy
The empire protects its ground
Hear the sound of battlecry
It's time!

Praised be their rite
Thy sight full of cruelty
Deathly sentenced they burn
Praised be their rite
The dance of Sacrifice
Doom of a battle lost is to die
