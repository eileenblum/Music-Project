Reflection
Is but a stranger
These strings set rigorous routine

Cracks form, covering my body
Weakened, blistered and torn apart

Revisiting old wounds
Completing the circle
Once again

Swollen eyes fixed on the prize
We hang our heads in self-destructive triumph

These fault lines
A soul erosion
Predictions never became so clear
