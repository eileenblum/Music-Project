When the truth won't do
And lies are so fulfilling

Hollow words
Beget hollow gestures
Hollow gestures
Beget hollow ventures

This impulse that dictates our nature
Drives us to dysfunction
Belligerent apathy
Belligerent apathy
Belligerent apathy would suit us so much better
But our motives are too impure
