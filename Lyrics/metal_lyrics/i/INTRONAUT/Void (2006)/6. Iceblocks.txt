Wandering lost
In a place of disillusionment
Gives way to glacial edifice
Narrow spaces with towering frigid walls

Monolithic blocks of ice
Stacked to the sky

Reflective surfaces
Confuse
And obscure all
Boundaries

Is it over?
Has it begun?

But when the balance is
Disrupted
The iceblocks will
Rain down
