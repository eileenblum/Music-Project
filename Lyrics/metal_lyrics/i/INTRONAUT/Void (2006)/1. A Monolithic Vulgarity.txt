Everything you've uttered is an echo
And this is not a curse
At least not by the hands of another

Your refuse
Will fertilize
Your own children
And the tunnel is burrowed eternally

As time digests itself
It worms through the path
And is excreted
As time digests itself

Gargantuan malformation
Worms through the path
And is excreted
