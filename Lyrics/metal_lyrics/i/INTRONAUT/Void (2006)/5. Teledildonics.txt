The yearning increased at
Exponential rates
But you wanted no part
Mortally content
Until the surge gave shock
And got you on all fours
Interface fucked
Inside a cubicle that looks of detachment

Is it the size or the angle? the point is clear
The mortal erection has run out of skin
We're hooked on electric stimuli
