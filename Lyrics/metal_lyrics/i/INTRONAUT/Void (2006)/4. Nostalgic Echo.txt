Disillusioned with complacence
We craft our past

Peering down this tunnel ever so far
Cracks shed light

Another day fails the shadow
One by one another chapter closes

Nostalgic echo
Perpetually reverberates
In the teeth of all experience
We still stand

Immersed in reflection
Memories linger and cling like dirt
