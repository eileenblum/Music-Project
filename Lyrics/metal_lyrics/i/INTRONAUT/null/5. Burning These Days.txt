Life, stretched out landscape beneath my feet
Time disintegrates in the palm of my hand
Familiar roads reflect fortitude
Ridden with fatigue
Breaking through these layers
Another layer of skin
Tolerance slowly withers
Lungs denied all air
Choking myself once again
Premonitions of failure, hinder action
Burning these days
Trying to retain, this balance
