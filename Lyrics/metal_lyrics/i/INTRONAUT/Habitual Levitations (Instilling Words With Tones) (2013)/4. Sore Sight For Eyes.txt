lie awake
lie to fake our way through life
realize- we can't stay

we're always afraid
we're never alone
we're unwanted
look away

it drags us down into the sea
our screams unheard, it's too late
the mess we made is all that remains
and all we have to do now is wait

engulfed by suspicions and remorse,
we fail
our open road, lying in wait beyond the horizon slowly fades
