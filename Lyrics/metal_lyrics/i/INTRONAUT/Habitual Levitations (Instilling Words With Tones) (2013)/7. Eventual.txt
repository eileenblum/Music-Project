it started with chalk, a dream, and the ground
mind was on fire

flooded with shapes
that always existed but were never there

founders and sankofites
connecting it all
i let them use me

closer now

ignored when i questioned the end
to the progress few have ever made

and now, with a chance at a way out
i have one more letter to write...
