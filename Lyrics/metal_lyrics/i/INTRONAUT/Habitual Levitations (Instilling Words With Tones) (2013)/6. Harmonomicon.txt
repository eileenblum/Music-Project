fall
never look down

it is known

where to find distant times
when only we were

it felt like a sigh

the silence that passed by

it's the unknown that leads us back home

we close our eyes,
and leave ourselves outside
the feeling fades,
and i am not alright
it's the unknown that leads us back home
