Eyes to the sky
The sound fills our ears
This moment resonates
A taste of our ill-fated destination

The night goes black
For fear of the light we see
Headed our way, never to arrive

Smoke without mirrors
Stubborn silence in the dark
And in the wake of it's gradual lift,
All but clarity to behold

So it goes
