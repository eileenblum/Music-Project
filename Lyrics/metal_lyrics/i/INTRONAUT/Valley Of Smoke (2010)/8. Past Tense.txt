It grows in our garden
Of dispair
Born oceans away
As old as time, and still among us

Unraveled from the inside
We forgive, and then we forget
With all that we can't see, knowing is believing...
And nobody wants to know

Any port will do
Valley of smoke seen up ahead
Storm is on the way


Thanks to Thomas.Gallagher for correcting track #1 lyrics.
