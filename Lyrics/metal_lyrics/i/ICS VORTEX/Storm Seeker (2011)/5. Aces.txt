All in, bring on the gin
Stakes are high, that's no reason why
I should not roll the dice and try
Will I sing or will I fly?

Lucky pips, doubles the chips
Next station up, a table with flop
You know I'm on a roll
When my fortune is building tall

Nothing lasts forever
Here I go it's now or never
To lose however. Il duce is too clever

Retard unlucky card
To my dismay the river washed away
What I just made today
Oh, I'll re-buy anyway

Now to walk the distance
I'll make them bleed, guaranteed
Squeeze the play
Make a new day

Cripple the deck, rule the table
Heads up. Small fish fry 'em all
Behold my snake eyes
Always control the other player
Gut shot a straight to break his balls

Nothing lasts forever
Here I go, it's now or never
Winner takes all. Showdown unfolds

It looks fine, the bullets are mine
I flop the dead man's hand
Oh, well I'll still make a stand
The turn is ace of spades
The river a swan to pocket eights
