There! Did you hear that sound, feel that fear
The echo of a presence near, hanging in the air

Lower your voice
Give up on choice
Follow the trail
Unfold your veil

Find what you are looking for
Someone is here
Right out there behind the door

Mirror the void
like SB the Floyd
Utter insane
Is it a new game?

You search through the house
And you find that you are all alone in there
Can't shake the feeling someone is stealing
Pieces of solid ground from here
Wide awake, you are still dreaming
Split between places you compose

Footsteps closing on on you
Spinning round and round, halfway drowned
Living lead

From all directions
Panic is creeping up your spine
Turns your light out as you cry out
It hits you what its all about
The sound, he fear
Now crystal clear
Your mortal coil long since disappeared
In the sleep of death
The dreams to come
Repeats on and on
