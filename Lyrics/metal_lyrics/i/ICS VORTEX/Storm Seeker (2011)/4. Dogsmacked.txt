I'm taking over now
What you call control I've ceased
Now on your knees

I'm all you ever need
I'm your light in life
Your guide to pure delight

And if you disobey
Eternal doom is what you pay
Team up with me I say
Bliss or torture on a tray

Invest your soul, do as your're told
Life is short for whom the bells toll
You don't have to doubt again
To fight again
To ever feel no pain again

My fields are evergreen
Like my love for you
As least as long as you stay true

And if you disobey
Eternal doom is what you pay
Team up with me I say
Bliss or torture on and on....

Sleeping
Feeding in my mind
Searching
Moments black in time
Wanting
What was left behind
Me, you
I reach out my arms but if fades
And slips
I can't remember what it was
Now I know its lost
