Where cold winds blow strong
At the heart of winter I belong (yeah!)
Where the oceans rise
There can be no compromise
In this majestic Pagan land
We are fit to withstand
All religious fools
Who try to bend a free man

From my hall I can see all four corners on a bright day
White north, grim east and the western world at my feet
And the horizon to the south where the beast bites its own tail
When I am tired of days, that is where I will set sail

Rise your horn, let's drink drink to health
In our domain where will is wealth
