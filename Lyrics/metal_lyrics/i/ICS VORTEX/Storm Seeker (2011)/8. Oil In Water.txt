Days pass slowly Still here a float, unclean unholy
Spilling darkness and this oil slick is
all consuming and will taint any shore
Bioremediation may stop this horrid liquidation
I go all in feeding bio combustive agents
To ignite once again

A quiz for the diehard! How to blend the non-polar into polar
One day at the time now I grind
Emulsifiers should bind
I try and I fail. Messy oil in water
I know there is a way but the darkness it binds me

One a practical side I have plenty of time for field trials
Social behaviour a code to the layer of failure

Lab rats race inside a maze
Of norms and cultures I embrace, all but right

Take back what is mine
Restoring crash test mind
Wounds heal, I am fine

You make or break it
I ran out of time
I'm not the first or last of that kind

What I did just to be rid of that burden
Was the ultimate one way trip, facing it I admit weakness
The aftermath bill lefty me worse off and still in confusion
The ship of fools sails on a sea split in truth and delusion

Crude oil in water
A mental state disorder
Crude oil in water
Fresh out from the slaughter
Crude oil in water
Guess I drew the shorter
Crude oil in water
Free falling mortar
