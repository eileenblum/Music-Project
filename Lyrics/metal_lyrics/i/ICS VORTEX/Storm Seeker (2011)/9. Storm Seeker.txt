Restless I stare as the sea
The ocean is clam, inviting and free
Time has passed. Yes, another I was
For days in thundering storms I could blast

Saltwater summons the dried
A leatherback watching the tide, starry-eyed
Vessel in harbour now what to decide
Should I go for a ride?

The die has been cast
I link up the past and tie myself t the mast

Weigh the anchor junker tanker
Flee to open ocean, wind in motion
Be the perfect storm for me

Electric beings are illuminati
The tempest holds the key
Bitten by the love for lightening
Senses brightening
Here I go it is not unfrightening

Events they unfold as my boat lose control
I am flanked on each side by white creatures pop-eyed
They stare, do not brink some will float some will sink
None of them speaks and the chaos path peaks
I feed on the volt the havoc and salt
the storm is complete I have found what I seek
Now I start to stare to transform unaware
My shipmates and I look the same
The sea and the salt is to blame
You know the game
This fact of life I can no longer hide
Some say that I died

The die has been cast
Untied from the mast
By spectres living fast

Sailing on and on in silence
Flee to open ocean wind in motion
Be the perfect storm for me


Electric beings are illuminati
The tempest holds the key
Ridden with the love the need we bleed for lightening
Riders of the storm are frightening me

I can no longer remember what it was like
to stand tall on the shore
