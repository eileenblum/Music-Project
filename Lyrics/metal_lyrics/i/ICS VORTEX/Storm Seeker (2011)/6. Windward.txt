So I have been a stranger for a while
Doesn't mean I don't love you
I cleaned up, won a lovely wife and child
Time flies
Wish we could be closer
So I write these lines to tell you

Obvious enough
I failed to be the guy
Always by your side
Speed down and you will find
New give and peace of mind
Us two we're the same kind

You decide, take one step at the time
And the road is a drag, I know
Well, just pick up the phone
I am game for a walk you know
Understand I don't judge or demand
Just want you to know the bottom line
My love for you is unconditionnal

Obvious enough
I failed to be the guy
Always by your side
Speed down and you will find
New give and peace of mind
Us two we're the same kind

You always did go with all your heart
Continue to do so
Break the circle, take it from the start
You can do it
You needn't aim to be a star
You already are
