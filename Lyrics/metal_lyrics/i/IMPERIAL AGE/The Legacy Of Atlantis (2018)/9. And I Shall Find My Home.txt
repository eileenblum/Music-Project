[Karina:]
I've been dreaming over millenia,
In the endless World of the Dead
Now I'm grateful to arrogant humans;
A new world is lying ahead.

[Both:]
Now we're free to find our way
For many centuries we are here to stay
Ancient Atlantis will be reborn
The new Earth shall become my home!

[Karina:]
I remember all we created,
All the knowledge is in our head,
We will teach the new generations,
Once forgotten, the wisdom will spread.

[Avva Rama:]
Where the Ancient Egyptians didn't remember,
Where the Orphics couldn't get it done,
Where the new religions chose to surrender,
We'll be ahead before we have begun.

[Avva Rama:]
Visions of my home are haunting me
[Karina:]
I can see all of them as if they were here in reality
[Avva Rama:]
Seas aren't the same, and the lands changed their shapes
[Karina:]
But I will find what is left from my time.

[Avva Rama:]
What lies ahead - even I don't know,
Forever young, forever ready to go.
The spirit of Atlantis will be forever alive
And we shall witness a new world rise.

[Karina:]
This new world is totally different,
Savage rulers are keeping it split.
But I'll go and search for my Homeland
And unite what's remaining of it!

[Both:]
Now we're free to find our way
For many centuries we are here to stay
Ancient Atlantis will be reborn
The new Earth shall become my home!
