[Avva Rama:]
Fight! You ignorant scum!
I will send you to hell!
You've been pestering long enough,
Though you have served me so well!

[Karina:]
Be no longer deceived by this tender shape,
Now I know truly who I am!
You will no longer contain me in these doors,
It is time to tell you "farewell"!

[Both:]
Despite our fragile physical form,
We won't surrender or fail.
Whatever happens in these stone walls,
The higher mind will prevail.

[Avva Rama:]
I don't ask you to kneel before me,
But don't you stand in my path!
If you live you'll never forget it:
A Mage of Atlantis in wrath!

[Karina:]
Now let's deal with them all and be gone from here,
There are so many things I must learn.
Our foes are in hiding and struck with fear,
And this place is soon going to burn.
