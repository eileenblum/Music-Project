- Seeing you, I feel joyful and warm
- As if I have known you all my life
- Distant memories stir in my soul
- How many times have you been my wife?

I approach the Tower Cold,
I conjure the Gates of Time:
See, behold two timeless souls,
We share one page on the World Scrolls.

In the world of insanity,
We shall be forever more,
In the realm of profanity,
To the highest lofts we soar.

Knit together in centuries.
Our souls go hand in hand,
Our minds bound in unison,
To the furthest realms extend.

- In all our greatest sorrows and joys
- We have always stood side by side
- Since ancient times you have been in my heart
- Even Death does not do us part.

Seams of Time, arise from the deep!
The Forgotten, come to life!
Different ages, different nations -
Our endless incarnations!
