There's a place, that's hidden from all eyes,
Where we can stay, free from the flow of Time,
Where no seasons change, and the future
never comes,
Welcome to Islands in Time.

While the outer world
Is rampaged bu its fall,
Here its peaceful and calm,
On our little isle...

The millenia will pass,
And there still will be no change,
Greatest treasures we can hide,
Secret thoughts we can exchange...

With the power of Gods
We create our worlds,
Which abide to our laws,
Between the branches of Time.

As a loop they will stand,
Always again and again,
As our strongholds, hideouts
For Magicians' tired souls...

In the upper levels of the Limbus
We create a space of our own idyll,
No unrest, no tears, only cheer,
Only harmony, only peace in eternity...

In the times of unease,
In the furore of war,
Mankind's legacy's kept
Behind timeless doors.

Our knowledge has survived,
And Atlantis was not lost,
Our minds have been revived,
Branches of Time have been crossed!
