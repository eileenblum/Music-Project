[Dominican order choir:]
On every morning,
Your Grace rises the sun,
Our Holy Father,
Thy will be done!

No mercy show we
In the eternal fight
Vanquish the devils -
The fire burns tonight!

[Cardinal Gregory:]
I have heard there was a demon?
I shall send him straight to Hell!
Get me to the anguished child
She will soon be very well

[Monk choir (in Latin):]
Cred in Deum Patrem
Omnipotentem, Creatorem
Et in lesum Christum,
Fillium eius unicum.

[Avva Rama (in Proto-tongue):]
Zigurmo Ort Urriz Ubellit
Hag urrt, Uturamon!

[Avva Rama:]
I am not afraid of your spells!
And I don't believe in your god!
There is nothing a mortal man can do
In the face of a Double-Born!

[Cardinal Gregory:]
I'm familiar with the Orphics
And I know now who you are,
Either you give us what we seek.
Or the girl ends on the bar.

[Monks choir:]
Let us prepare the Dunking Stool,
And we shall see then, who is the fool.

[Avva Rama:]
I've seen perils greater than this,
Your own holy ass you can kiss.

Ukummi ort ell,
Vox ort eri. Yngumus!

[Avva Ramma:]
The more you talk to me,
The stronger I become!
It's time to go!
