See the earth at the peak of itâs glory -
Days that are long gone.
The greatest empire of the ancient times
Behold the light so bright it blinds your eyes!

Atlantis!
Ancestor of Mankind
Those who have united
The earth under One Name

See the greatest city stand
In Anabiosis
What has once ruled all the world -
Mighty Poseidonis!

The great pyramids in place
Shelter us from danger,
We send ships to distant worlds,
Fearing not their anger.

We sped up the evolution of mankind
To see what we are capable of.

And gave birth to a handful of The Chosen

There is no time,
Thereâs no space, thereâs no death,
Thereâs no life, no more fear
For those who have chose to adhere.

The divine will continue our job
When the Greatest of Wars
Has destroyed all thatâs left
Of our world.

Our vessels in the sky
Built of living fibre,
What weâve made will never die
In the Earth on Fire

Our knowledge, our lord
Safely locked inside those
Whose minds perish never more
Changing flesh as their clothes.

Time will go, the seeds will flourish in the soil
A new world brings a new round of the coil...

Some things never die, others do
We are like transparent ghosts to you,
But the things weâve made have formed your view
You can ask your heart - we are true

There is no time,
Thereâs no space, thereâs no death,
Thereâs no life, no more fear
For those who have chose to adhere.

The divine will continue our job
When the Greatest of Wars
Has destroyed all thatâs left
Of our world.

â¨Nothing lasts forever,
Even greatest treasure
Risen beyond measure
We induced our fall -
A matter of time.

All the new religions,
Mystical provisions,
Teachings, revelations,
All stem from one root -
Atlantic knowledge.

See the earth at the peak of itâs glory -
Days that are long gone.
The greatest empire of the ancient times
Behold the light so bright it blinds your eyes!
