In the centuries when
You have roamed this Earth,
You have changed your flesh and minhd,

As the time goes on,
Dead are born again,
We have met on the other side.

Time is only another direction,
Everything has ended and has begun.
Let the multitude of your faces
All unite in a single mind!

Who completed their minds,
They die never more,
Their consciousness lives on and on.

In another life,
In another time,
The same person will be reborn.

Raise your head, you are now completed,
A divine creature you have now become!
Now your consciousness never withers,
On a new level you can come.

I have now passed to Thee
The Immortals' secret.
Take the Path that will make you free
From Sansara's sequence.
