After ages in time
Finally a light!
How long have I been asleep
In the endless worlds of night?

I can feel you breath!

Awaken! Awaken!
Arise! Arise!
The Great Atlantis!
Now it is your time!

I remember my name,
But I don't know yours.
Is the world still the same?
Am I now on friendly shores?

I remember my name,
But I don't know yours.
Is the world still the same?
Am I now on friendly shores?

I can see your face!

I have knowledge of old
How to change the world,
How to possess energy,
And restore the dead memory.

I can touch your mind
