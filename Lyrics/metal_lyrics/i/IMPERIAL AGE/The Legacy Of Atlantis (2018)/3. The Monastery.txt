[Karina:]
Mother, what has happened to me?
I am not myself now
A male voice is speaking in me
I can not escape him!

[Horatia:]
Child, you are possessed!

[All:]
Firm as rock our convent stands -
Splendid isolation!
Here forever we shall dwell,
Sheltered from temptation!

[Avva Rama:]
We were destroyed in the morning mist,
As a result of the Fire..

[Horatia &amp; Karina:]
Demon, begone, your place is in Hell!
Fiend of ill desire!

[Horatia:]
Child, I see your eyes are so red,
Your skin is pale and fragile,
Your forget to eat your bread
And spend your nights in prayer.

[Karina:]
Please, mother, save me!
[Karina:]
Now the voice speaks louder to me
Telling me tales of far lands

[Horatia:]
I've asked Rome to help us save thee,
The Exorcists are coming.

[Both:]
Cred in Deum Patrem!
