Aryavarta, land of the North,
Country of legend and tale!
Ancient empire, forgotten in time,
Memories ghostly and frail...

You were the greatest force
Of your time,
Land of astonishing power,
Confederation of Aryan might,
Until your very last hour...

And the legends go on and on...

For many centuries and more
Our souls have dreamt
Of homely shores,
Now our legacy can speak,
Our vanished glory we shall seek!
And we'll redeem the might of old
For all the world now to behold!
The road is blessed, we won't return,
The lore of ancient worlds we learn...

Home to the Vedas - the wisdom of old,
Chronicles of times forgotten,
Governed by Bramins - the wise
And the great,
Until their hearts became rotten...

Civilisation of spirit and might,
Mages of terrible knowledge,
Over the centuries vanished from sight,
Few are now paying your homage...

And the legends go on and on...

For many centuries and more
Our souls have dreamt
Of homely shores,
Now our legacy can speak,
Our vanished glory we shall seek!
And we'll redeem the might of old
For all the world now to behold!
The road is blessed, we won't return,
The lore of ancient worlds we learn...

Over the years we searched the truth,
The hidden signs of old
In all the different artifacts
That History has known.
And we regained the knowlenge
Of the previous great age
We know for sure whats hidden there.
Beyond the seen stage!

Unrecognized, forgotten, unknown,
Banned from historical scriptures,
You are alive in the hearts
Of your sons
And in the minds of true thinkers.

Ancient tradition forever lives on,
But there remain those who today
Remember the knowledge
And power of all,
Their consciousness knows no decay.

And the legends go on and on...
