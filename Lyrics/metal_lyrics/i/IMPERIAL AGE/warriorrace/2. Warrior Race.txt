Hail thou, Warrior Race!
All the world's here to embrace
Will be conquered by your grace
Death your enemies will face!

Sweep them like a fire sword,
Inflict death with every word,
You are now the overlords,
Land your ships, unleash the hoard!

Hail mighty sons
Of Vanaheim!
Vimanas fly above the sky!

The Imperial Age
Has just begun,
The world will soon be redone!

Now the Vanir attack what has remained
From the once greatest empire on Earth
What the Assir have managed to save
Will now fall to the wrath from the North.

The final war
Has just begun!
Atlantis will be overwhelmed,

The last strongholds
High in the peaks
Will soon be mere history...

Knowledge that was wrought by generations
Now will be lost for the new age to come
Vanquished by Runes, their Magicians retreat,
Time for Atlantis has come to succumb!

Hail mighty sons
Of Vanaheim!
Vimanas fly above the sky!

The Imperial Age
Has just begun,
The world will soon be redone!
