[I. The Presage]

There is a permanent fire
Burning inside our hearts.
We shall never betray
Our purity of Gods

But those who choose to be weak
Those who linger behind
Those who always retreat
They commit suicide

Their Sun will stop burningâ¦

Now make your choice
Whether to join us and be free
Or get lost
In the purifying flame

Of our wrath
There is no space in one place
For both
Beasts and Gods!

There is fear in your hearts!
Uselessness in your eyes
There shall never be mercy
For the cancer of the Earth!

You can only consume
You sleep away your lives
You have no ways to evolve
Only one path - to die!

Our Sun will die because of you!

The brightest light
Will shine forever on the wise
We will rise
Far, far above the dark blue skies

Our minds
In concordance with our souls
Will create
A worthy world!

[II. There Is Hope]

There's so much to do together
We could live forever
And this hell might never
Never return...
The whole world is against us
And it shall burn!!!

Rise your head above the sky
And let the ground be shaken
By your battle cry!

You are not forsaken
Your soul can not be taken
Unless you wish it to be done!

In the eternal fields of darkness
The Primordial Chaos is whirling
We collect our strength eternal
To create a brand new world

Those who waste their time on nothing
Will doze in a lifelong slumber
Till the time the High Command rings:
TURN THE SUN OFF!

[III. The Beginning Of The End]

The sun will darken
The air will chill throughout
The heaven will collapse
The darkest winds will blow
Across the desert of Seth

Arise, who lie beneath the ground!

[IV. Rise Of The Undead]

In every place and in
every direction bones start
shivering beneath the
ground, and out of every
hole, every low place the
Undead crawl into the light
of the darkening sun and
countless dead eyes are
gazing at the still beautiful
but dying Earth...

This is the end...
But you asked for it...

Inexorable... implacable...
Purification!

There was a little hope...
You could live in a world
So bright and strong!

It could last forever...

The brightest light
Could some forever on the wise
We could rise
Far, far above the dark blue skies

Our minds
In concordance with our souls
Could create
A worthy world!...

[V. The Dead Will March The Earth]

Hold the line!
Spare none but the worthy!
Purify the world!
Eradicate the human disease!

Get ready! Hold on!
The world is ours!
Only the decent will survive!
We are the healers of the
Earth!

VI. A New Aeon Dawns

Time!
It is the morning time
But I see no light
No light in the sky:
There is no sun!

Only the stars
Shine in the night
Only the night
Eternal night...

Soon the world
Will invert itself
And Brahma's breath
Will repeat...

Countless new suns
Dawn on the edge
Of the world
A new Aeon
Is starting...
