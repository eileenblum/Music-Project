Feel the pain of anguish and desire
Touch the freezing flames of my black fire
Watch your body shiver with convulsions and despair
Now you know what I feel - only now it's fair!

In the center of the Earth
Where the fire of time remains
Come and break my heart's desire
To see my own pain!

In the center of the time
Where the nightingale sings our love
Come and break my heart's desire!
I will always be loving you...
As I make my path in this damned world
As a man so hateful and so old
Come with me my darling, light my early dusk!
Stretch your hands and pull off me, pull this useless mask...

In the center of the Earth
Where the fire of time remains
Come and break my heart's desire
To see my own pain!

In the center of the time
Where the nightingale sings our love
Come and break my heart's desire!
I will always be loving you...

All the world is not enough for us!
Nothing can take in my burning love!
For your love and happiness I'd destroy the world!
Nothing else matters! Only you can save my soul!

In the center of the Earth
Where the fire of time remains
Come and break my heart's desire
To see my own pain!

In the center of the time
Where the nightingale sings our love
Come and break my heart's desire!
I will always be loving you...
