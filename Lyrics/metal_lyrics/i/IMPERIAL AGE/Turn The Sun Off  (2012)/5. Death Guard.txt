I am fear of the Divine
I'm the reflection in your eyes
And I'm the dreams you try to hide
To get a place in paradise

I'm a force you cannot see
But I am not a fantasy
I am the scythe of the Gods
The master of all earthly lords

When you are in fear
Or in despair
I always shall be near you
Giving you my strength

When you are in anger
I shall be your friend
When you are revenging
I shall guide your hand

Most of mortals fear me
But there is something they can't see:
If you go to a certain length
Then I will favour you with Strength

And if you grow over me
You'll have a chance of being free
It's up to you to make the choice
And hearken to your inner voice

When you are in fear
Or in despair
I always shall be near you
Giving you my strength

When you are in anger
I shall be your friend
When you are revenging
I shall be your hand
