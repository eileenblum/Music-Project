Since the time we ruled together
In the blind, deserted sea
Since the fadeout of memories
Time to come, that would never be...

Time to go
Over the falling snow
Over the rain to come
For now - don't cry...

In my mind - the pure reflections
Of the virgin times that passed
All our childish thoughts and questions -
Rotten now and will never, never come true!

Time of virginity
Life of obscurity
I will rise!

Time of virginity
Life of obscurity
Time will come!

In my mind - the pure reflections
Of the virgin times, that passed...
