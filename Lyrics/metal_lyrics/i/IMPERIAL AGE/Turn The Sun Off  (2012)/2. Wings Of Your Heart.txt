At the beginning of every day
You know what lies ahead
Petty grey days without an end
Time exchanged for bread

Life has no meaning and will soon end
You will rot in the sand
The only thing that you were taught right
Is to misunderstand

In time you'll grow
The Wings of your heart
You will feel, you'll know
The breath of the night

Fly through the heaven
Eternally free
You will be forever
If you learn to see!

No! This life was never for you!

You were created unflawed!
The blood of Kingu runs in your veins
You are a spark of God!

Rise your head above the crowd
Master the power within
You are the finest creature on Earth

Do not disgrace your kin!

In time you'll grow
The Wings of your heart
You will feel, you'll know
The breath of the night...

Fly through the Heaven
Eternally free
You will be forever
If you learn to see!
