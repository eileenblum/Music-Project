Hear the warriors' song
That rings above the sky
Feel the ground shake beneath you
Hearken the battle cry!

See the field lit with fires -
Ten thousand men are here tonight
Listen: Death's wings are flapping -
Tomorrow we will die!

Time to rise, our final call!
Under our feet trembles the Earth!
The road is clear to Odin's Hall
The day we waited above all!

We have subdued our fear
We seek advice from our Death
A spell is laid on our weapons
None escapes our wrath!

Time to rise our final call!
Under our feet trembles the Earth!
The road is clear to Odin's Hall.
The day we waited above all!

Only we know the secrets
The battle magic is our lore
Death is where you hide from it
So raise your axe and fear no more!

Time to rise our final call!
Under our feet trembles the Earth!
The road is clear to Odin's Hall
The day we waited above all!
