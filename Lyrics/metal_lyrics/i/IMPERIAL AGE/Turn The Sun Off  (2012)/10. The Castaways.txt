Clench your fist
A little stronger
Know, my child:
You should be bolder

Over the time you will learn yourself
You'll reach the stars...

In a world, that's gone astray
Those, who know, are cast away
Hard as steel your will should be
Only strength can make you free!

Your little life will go on by
You won't understand the truth of mine
Time will pass and there'll be nothing new
Follow the rules and they will betray you!

In a world, that's gone astray
Those, who know, are cast away
Hard as steel your will should be
Only strength can make you free!

You and me are castaways
To whom they will pray!
They will never understand
The merits of our fate
You shall be the Chosen One
To enter the Gate!

In a world, that's gone astray
Those, who know, are cast away
Hard as steel your will should be
Only strength can make you free!
