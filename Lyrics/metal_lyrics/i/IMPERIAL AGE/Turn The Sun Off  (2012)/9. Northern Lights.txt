Once upon a time
In the land of snow
There was a great Empire.
Vanished long ago

The platoes of the Arctic
Were home to a great race
Spirit, valour and wisdom
Were their common traits

Under the Northern Lights
During a half-year night
Under the virgin snows
Ancient wisdom lies...

Descendants of Arctida!
Your hands and souls are weak
You traded yourselves for gold
Your values are so sleek...

Aim your lives at perfection
The legacy of the Wise
And banners of Hyperborea
Might once again arise...

Under the Northern Lights
During a half-year night
Under the virgin snows
Ancient wisdom lies...
