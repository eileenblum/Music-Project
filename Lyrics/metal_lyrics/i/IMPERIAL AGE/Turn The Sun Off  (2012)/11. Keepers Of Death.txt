Over seas of time
Ringers the remembrance
Of the days gone by
Full of human nescience

Now the years that passed
Left no recognition
We are locked up here
With a dreadful mission

Die tonight
Awake tomorrow
Sing the song
Of eternal sorrow!

We escaped the fate
Of the transient mortals
Now they pay their lives -
We avoid the portal

We have endless time
We are wise and old
But can't cross the line
To the other worlds

Die tonight
Awake tomorrow
Sing the song
Of eternal sorrow!
