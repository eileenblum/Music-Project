No matter what happens
I'll remain myself
There's no way to buy me:
I have my inner wealth!

I go only forward
Light shines in my eyes
If you stand in my way -
Either move or die! Or die!!

In the world of sorrows
I shall stand as one
Witnessing its downfall
Worshiping the Sun!

My will is unbending
And my arm is strong
My faith never withers
I know where I belong! So long!

Over the downfalls
Into the risings
Follow my errand
Over the time

Mystical knowledge
Pleasure, enlightments:
The only priceless gift
Is Life!

There is only one way
To get a good thing done:
You carry on falling
Until you start to run

There is no way round it
Just stand up and fight!
Life's a constant war:
The winner's always right! So fight!...

War goes on forever
In battle I thrive
Having fought my weakness
In victory I rise!

Pursuing perfection
The fight goes on and on
And maybe we will make it
To the next Aeon...
