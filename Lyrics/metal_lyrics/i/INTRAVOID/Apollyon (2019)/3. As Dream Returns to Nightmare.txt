Shadows cast on shores and skies
Condemned again to stare in misery's eyes
I begged to keep on my idyllic course
But I take now the path of my source
Golden sun, now ash and dead
Lost the chance to rest my heavy head
Strode from the grave with a weighted cause
But I cannot break from this dark

Staring at the sky as if to show a sign
Give me an answer or I'll watch until I'm blind

Putting all the scenery to flame
Lost the sense of content yet again
Drop of dew in a sea of names

Stepless gaits, unto boundless journeys
Senseless maps, from the past not learning
Disgraven, this familiar dead face
And life's breath was stolen from me
Dimming light crawling through the doorway
Bleeding hope and it's fallacious story
Drowning fears that are non-existent
As dream returns to nightmare

[Solo: Hayden]
[Solo: Coleman]

Digging through the past as if to find
A telling relic lost to time
That I may know the reason
For this hell inside

Putting all the scenery to flame
Lost the sense of content yet again
Drop of dew in a sea of names

Stepless gaits, unto boundless journeys
Senseless maps, from the past not learning
Disgraven, this familiar dead face
And life's breath was stolen from me
Dimming light crawling through the doorway
Bleeding hope and it's fallacious story
Drowning fears that are non-existent
As dream returns to nightmare
