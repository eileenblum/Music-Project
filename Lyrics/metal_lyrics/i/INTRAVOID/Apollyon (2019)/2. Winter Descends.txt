Death traumatises the future
Scarring...
Engraving...
An un (yet) written history
That lead to nowhere
Under black, smogged skies

Burned..
Into time are the sands of the glass
Fueled by the apathy of the mass

Desecrated by the man;
The Earth's put to death
Suffocated by our hands;
Gasps it's final breath

Serving these corporate, rapacious foundations:
Bleed for the end of the Earth!
Bleed for the end of this blue speck, our shelter;
Bleed for the end of the Earth!!

Burned..
Into time are the sands of the glass
Blown into our eyes, blinding the mass!

Desecrated by the man;
The Earth's put to death
Suffocated by our hands;
Gasps it's final breath
Exterminate this wasted land,
The heavens start to cry
In this cold and dying sphere;
All the blood runs dry

Burned! Into ash and smolder!
Charred! Like every other!
Dare to call this shit all libel?
End this fucking vicious cycle!
Burned! Into ash and smolder!
Charred! Like every other!
Dare to call this shit all libel?
End this fucking vicious cycle!

I will no longer stand blindly by,
Watching these heathens blacken our skies
Caged on Earth we drift through time;
Chained to the broken design!
