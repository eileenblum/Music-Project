My shadow will soon follow,
My life will slip away
My essence surely will deplete
And my mind will then decay
Why am I forsaken?
Why is my soul tainted?
Why do I live in eternal torment?
Why must he always linger?

Watching again
Watching again
Never shall I suffer his cold, undying eyes
I am abandoned by the light of god
To be condemned unto hell forevermore;
Why must I die?

God, can you hear me?
Do you understand my fear?
Why must you seer me with the branding of hell?
Do I suffer for your amusement?
He who looms
He who looms
He who looms in the distance

Watching again
Watching again
Never shall I suffer his cold, undying eyes
I am abandoned by the light of god
To be condemned unto hell forevermore;
Why must I die?

Cast into the sun
My soul has become corrupt
The ether slowly consumes me whole
As I rot away
Humanity destroyed
As I'm drawn into the void
Shackled to my place in hell,
For my part in this damnation

In the distance;
He looms in shadows
From hell he emerged;
To torment my soul for the rest of time
God will you answer?
Will you end my suffering?
Will you bring an end to the madness and misery?
