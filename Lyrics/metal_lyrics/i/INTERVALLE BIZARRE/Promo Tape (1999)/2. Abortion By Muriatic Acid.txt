I'm dying in the place of my conception, my future - genetic scum, what
corrodes my home, injected in the uterus, pain all over my surface, they don't
want my life, do they, I'm a negative element in their life, the negative
element which will be killed, by muriatic acid, I feel blood, I feel blood in
my liquid, I don't know why,they want my death, I pucker up my face, who will
help me, in my future - ash, who feels the unborn tears, in mixture of blood
and the foetic liquid, it's so sinister to me, I'm a fetus bringer of sorrow
and pain, they feel antipathy for me, my tissue is corroded by muriatic acid,
who knows that I feel pain - science, my life draws to an end, who killed me?
