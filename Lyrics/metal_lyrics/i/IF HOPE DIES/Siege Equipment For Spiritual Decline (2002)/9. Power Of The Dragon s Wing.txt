Dark Lord chaos, your time has come. 
The people of the Elvin Hills of Algoroth will regain command of their homeland. 
And their pride will flourish within these valleys and rivers once more. 
This is the sound of victory.
Fly.

Fly high mighty Thoros, among the trees, among the stars. 
Look in your heart, start to believe. 
Command your armies, take back the night. 
With the power of the Dragon's wing! 

Rest assured Dark Lord. 
With the power of the Dragon's wing we will not fail. 
Mighty Thoros have no fear
but rejoice when the pride of your people is restored. 
To it's rightful place. 

On the throne of victory.
