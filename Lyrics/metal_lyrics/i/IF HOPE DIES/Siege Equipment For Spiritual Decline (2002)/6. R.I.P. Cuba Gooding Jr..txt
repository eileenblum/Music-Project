Itâs amazing that five lives have. 
Revolved around this thing weâve made. 
More amazing still that we continue on today. 
Itâs grown to be more than we could ever have hope.d 
This thingâs bigger than the lot of us. 
Thereâs so much more to this road. 
I want to see it all with you. 
This passion still burns. 

I donât want to sever these ties. 
These are the times of our lives. 
This is the time that binds. 
This is our lifeline.

This is something that Iâll always hold dear to my heart. 
That Iâll always remember. 
Dear to my heart. 
This is something that Iâll always hold dear to my heart. 
Thereâs no mistaking. 
What we have is worth saving. 
Some of my greatest memories have come out of this. 
Thereâs no mistaking. 
What we have is worth saving. 
To think that it all could have been cast aside. 

Thereâs so much more to that road. 
It stretches on for miles. 
I want to see it all with you. 
This passion, it still burns. 

I donât want to sever these ties. 
These are the times of our lives. 
This is the tie that binds. 
This is our lifeline. 

This is something that Iâll always hold dear to my heart. 
This is something that Iâll never forget. 
This is something that Iâll always hold dear to my heart. 

My heart. 

Thereâs so much more to that road 
It stretches on for miles. 
Weâve got much longer to go. 
Because this passion still burns.
