yeah, you're the king snake 
gliding through the grass 
all attempts to catch you have ended 
in empty grasps 
you slid into our hearts' 
and unleashed your venemous tongue 
it's now more than i can stand to see you continue on 
ever the sarcastic one, i can see 
your forked tongue flicker between your lips 
tasting the wind finding someone else to lie to again 
bearing nothing but an armful of empty promises 

your arms spread wide open with a dagger's embrace 
i won't believe your poisoned words ever again 

i can't manage to look you in your eyes now, 
without trying to burn a hole right through your head 
these every day masquerades only serve to make my heart sick 

yeah, you're the king snake 
gliding through the grass 
all attempts to catch you have ended 
in empty grasps 
you slid into our hearts' 
and unleashed your venemous tongue 
it's now more than i can stand to see you continue on 

your arms spread wide open with a dagger's embrace 
i won't believe your poisoned words ever again 
i can see right through you 

ever the sarcastic one, i can see 
your forked tongue flicker between your lips 
tasting the wind finding someone else to lie to again 
bearing nothing but an armful of empty promises 
your continued existence is meaningless 

someday you'll learn of all the pain you've made 
and i hope that realization will bring you to your knees 
that you have led a life 
hurting those who could have loved you most 
your continued existence is meaningless 

i can't manage to look you in your eyes now 
without trying to burn a hole right through your head 
these everyday masquerades only serve to make my heart sick 
oh yeah, you're the great deciever 

your arms spread wide open, 
with a poisoned embrace 
i won't believe your poisoned words ever again
