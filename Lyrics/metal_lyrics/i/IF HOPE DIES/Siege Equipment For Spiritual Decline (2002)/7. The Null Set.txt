Still my heart, cease the beating quickened by. 
Your passing grace. 
Better to fix my gaze ahead and forget, forget everything. 
For now just keep on walking, swallow the words back. 
Down and pray for nothing. 
Steel myself and melt back into the shadows. 
Continue down this lonely path, where love and joy fear to tread. 
An island of strength free from all feeling. 
For now just keep on walking. 
Swallow the words back down and pray for nothing. 
Easier to just let go, then to fight and lose. 
An idea too lofty to hold onto. 
All these nights awake spent staring at these walls. 
All these feelings I've tried so hard to quell. 
I hold my breath and try to force it away. 
Clenching my fists, gritting my teeth. 

Waiting for the new day to come and dispel these clouds away. 
A sky of dim prospect, to grim to behold. 
I'll bow my head and plow forward. 

Carve my heart out from my ribs. 
Trap it in a box and throw away the key. 
If I told you where I hid it. 
You'd only use it to destroy me. 
My nerves long dead, turned to dust from lack of use. 

I've forgot what it's like to bask in hopes warm light.

Still my heart, cease the beating quickened by. 
Your passing grace. 
Better to fix my gaze ahead and forget, forget everything.
