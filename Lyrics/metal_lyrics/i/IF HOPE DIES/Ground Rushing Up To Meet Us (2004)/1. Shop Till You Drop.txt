feed the machine
that eats up
our lives
churning out product,
end result of time processed
then sold back to us,
and renamed convenience

left with the notion
of life as commodity
hours converted to dollars
for the benefit of
private interest
coerced, to reduce our options
there is no freedom
within this economy

working to buy
our time saving devices
have we sacrificed
more in the name of convenience
than we stand to gain?

eaten alive
our blood greases the axles
of an engine that's out of control
this defies our nature
we will take back
what our masters stole

they want you to live to work,
work until you die
marry and reproduce,
more resource for them to exploit

forget what they'd have you believe
our lives are not their playthings
we won't be bought and sold
