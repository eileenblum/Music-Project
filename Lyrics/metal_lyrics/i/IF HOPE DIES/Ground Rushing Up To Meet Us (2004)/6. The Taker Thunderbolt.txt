we are falling down now
motion mistaken for flight
ambition has betrayed us
pursuit of dominance leaves us blind
there are few who look below us
and see the end of our path
they know our world will be broken
upon the rocks it will be smashed
this culture, this ship of fools
it's success, is it's doom
we keep striving to stay aloft
facing forward as we plummet

why won't we listen
to the voices of reason?
we are all falling
we are all falling down
we are falling
we are falling down

we've bent the world
to our will
made ourselves the
new gods of this domain
accepted the myth
that this is the height
of life as it
was meant to be lived

we are falling down,
plunging headfirst
we are falling down,
straight to the earth
we are falling down,
rushing headlong
we are falling down,
straight to the ground

to those who cannot see
the desolation we are facing,
any heart that bleeds for this world
must reveal our desperation

we must abandon this failed experiment and
find a civilization that can fly in the wind

take heed of the warnings
the pull at work upon our legs,
that's gravity screaming at us
the news of our end

it seems to us that
this is all there is
no way out of this
hole we're in
despair grabs hold and
we throw up our hands
we can fight back with hope
and begin again
