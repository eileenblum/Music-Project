wake up from the slumber that
you've been forced into
climb out from the depths of sleep
to the waking world
asleep with your eyes wide open
we stumble from place to place
lulled into compliance
from the whispers in our ears
well it's time to rise up from our beds

we've sensed that something's wrong
but with eyes closed tight it's hard to see
just what it is that sedates us
and keeps us from being free

we've been programmed
to fall into place
the rank and file members
of a catatonic state
washed away
and drowning
in this
mainstream

feed the need
that burns inside you
this desire
cannot be satisfied
this consumption consumes
our very being
this consumption consumes
you

once we finally wake up
we will see that
the emperor has no clothes
or skin upon his face

demolish all the signs
that hang over our heads
burn down everything
that bears their messages

end your consumption
of shallow offerings
shake off the effects
of this sleep

wake up
