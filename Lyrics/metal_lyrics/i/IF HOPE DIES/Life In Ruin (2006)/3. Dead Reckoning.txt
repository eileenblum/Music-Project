Shambling like a walking corpse living, but not quite alive you return again and again to the sites once occupied in life you're just a ghost you're just a ghost of the past you are condemned condemned to repeat your actions you're just a shadow that leaves no trace trapped in an endless pattern conditioned to accept your fate your mind is dulled your body propelled forward you're held in thrall to perform the bidding of your masters the body moves but the heart no longer beats cold as the deepest ocean, blood freezes in your veins trapped inside a failing body you are a mindless slave all feeling has been forgotten it's all rotten away someone's pulling at your strings so pull back you aren't holding your own reins so break them
