We've placed a limit on our vision that blinds us to our future we can't see past the present to where our actions take us this is a game that's played for keeps no taking back what's said or done we have to understand that there's more than the here and now we're all connected in this life actions have consequences that echo through the ages a ripple made in water that turns into a wave somewhere down the line this will come back to haunt us and time will remain indifferent to our regrets know that what we do truly matters, our decisions don't only affect us every action has it's reaction think about the legacy you're creating this is a game that's played for keeps no taking back what's said or done we'll be buried below the weight of our mistakes
