Bear witness to the destruction the perversion of life replacement of the natural with mechanical precision the way that man has chosen is the path of dominance instead of coexistence he exerts control over life we empty out the land and sea transform life into machinery take apart our foundation to build our towers ever higher this is a course we can't sustain failure is programmed into our plan the more we take, the less we give the further we fall to towards failure the failure of man is displayed in our actions the death of compassion turns us into monsters subvert the laws of nature it's all become a process we've come to rely upon our factories of death now we take what is easy and ignore what is right we're being consumed by shadows from our darkest hearts we cause so much harm and do so little good the longer we travel down this path the harder it is to defend our existence the failure of man is the burden we all share we've all had a hand in the execution of this plan
