Wandering this blasted landscape that we once called our home lost amid the ash and wreckage, we wonder how this came to pass it's been a long time coming the hour of man's descent from our lofty seat of power to it's conclusion in cement this is the consequence of an administration of arrogance ages without intervention and success before our governance the cracks have grown into fissures oversights exposed as deadly errors now it's so easy to see where we went wrong we've worked hard at untying the knots that hold it all in place the balance all too fragile that allowed for our mistakes the facade of control has worn away it shows what we've suspected that we have lost our way this is an object lesson of a life in ruin
