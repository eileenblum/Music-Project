This is what we are this is what we've become semi-conscious parts of a highly refined system we are the wires part of this great machine programmed for other's purpose harnessed for others greed your free time is no longer free spend each moment trying to make ends meet this world moves too fast to stay ahead forever falling behind until we're dead our lives are worth more than mere numbers we must demand more for our contributions object to living in quiet desperation this is a call for change and rebellion this is a system in need of some disruption
