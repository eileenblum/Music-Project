This stale air is draining the life right out of us transfixed, immobile paralyzed by indecision a small glimpse, a vision of heights much greater than these somewhere, within us a desire for so much more keep on fighting keep on pushing forward we must somehow find the way keep on struggling keep on wanting more don't let this world tear you down far too often we find our voices swallowed by silence condemned to watching as time slips through our hands the time for hesitation has now come and gone the longer we stand still the further away our dreams become a change is coming born out of dissatisfaction with the hand that we've been dealt the restless many now filled with anger are demanding for release from this static hell
