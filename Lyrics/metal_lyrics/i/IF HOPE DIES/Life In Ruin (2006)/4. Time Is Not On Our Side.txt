Waiting for the moment when you can come alive you fail to notice when life threatens to pass you by days disappear all at once, in the blink of an eye inaction is a sickness that's diagnosis is terminal you must understand that the cure along with the cancer exists within yourself wasted lives built from wasted time passion destroyed by inertia time is our enemy it waits for no one why can't you see that this will be the only chance you'll ever have? when you look back will you be able to say that what you wanted is just what you did?
