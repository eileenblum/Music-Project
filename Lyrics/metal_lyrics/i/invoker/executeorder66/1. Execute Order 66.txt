Stamp him out like the fires that rain down
Genocide on his chosen people
[2x]

Lies, there's no chance for your salvation [2x]

I have sat quietly
While you speak in cancerous tongues
To many victims have suffered
&amp; await your demise
As you preach they become victims
Spreading tales of genocide
Tonight, your kingdom dies

Stamp him out like the fires that rain down
Genocide on his chosen people
[2x]

Lies, there's no chance for your salvation [2x]

There's no chance for your salvation [2x]

I search for solitude within the confines of my mind
All I find is nothingness
On this I will survive
I'll create a legion
To set fire
I'll create a legion
To set fire to the skies

I'll create a legion
To set fire
To the skies [2x]
