Your world is ending today
I'll watch as it all goes up in flames
These fires will purge the Earth
Of the human stain

With every breath you take
It's one away from your death
I despise your existence
It pains me to see you alive

I can barely wait for the day
When the light leaves your fucking eyes

Chivalry is dead
What ever happen to honor amongst men?

I'll remove this knife from my back
&amp; plunge it in your fucking heart
Your mortality is tied to your morality
I promise you will not survive

Your dark demise will soon be met
Your decisions where not well spent

This began with you
This is how it ends
No peace on Earth
I'll will towards men

You act as though life is just a game
Well if so then I'll raise the stakes
Raise the stakes [2x]

I have won &amp; now you must pay
Annihilation of this worthless stain
