[feat. Tyler Of Traitors]You hold yourself above everyone else
You claim to oppose all religion
But you run your mouth about one

A fucking cancer to the progression of humanity
A fucking fake with a false sense of sanity
I'm better off walking the Earth
Knowing that you no longer exist
Anger is an understatement
I'm fucking pissed

You are the definition of a hypocrite
As long as you're alive then the world is simply shit
You parasites fucking dwell in it

[Tyler]
You're just as sick
As the priests who pray for nothing
&amp; just as twisted as the cruelest politicians who think they're everything

You hold yourself above everyone else
You claim to oppose all religion
But you run your mouth about one

A fucking cancer to the progression of humanity
A fucking fake with a false sense of sanity
I'm better off walking the Earth
Knowing that you no longer exist
Anger is an understatement
I'm fucking pissed

You seem to think you are the enlightened few
Yet you know nothing of the mindless words you spew
The cross you claim
Is not yours to bare
You're just like the rest
But you think that you're rare

Insignificance, nothing but ignorance
Are the only things that you truly display
Insignificance, ignorance
Are the only things you truly display
