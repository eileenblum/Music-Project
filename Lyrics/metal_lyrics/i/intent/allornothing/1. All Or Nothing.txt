Life ain't easy, nothing comes free
Don't just walk the live &amp; let things be
Take the next step &amp; make your voice heard
Live the life you want &amp; back your word

All or nothing
Find the strength within
Only way you can win
All or nothing
Take control of your mind
Don't just walk the line

It's time
All or nothing
