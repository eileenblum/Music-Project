Lied to my face, never again
Trusted you as a friend, won't happen again
Stab me in the back is just what you do
Live your life without a fucking clue

Talk your shit just to get your way
Run your mouth with nothing to say
There's no place for the world you to live in
Always talking but never giving

I've had it up to here with our bullshit attitude
Stab me in my fucking back it's all you ever fucking do
It's all you ever do
