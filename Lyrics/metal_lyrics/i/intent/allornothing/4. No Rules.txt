Time is now &amp; we won't lose
Better way we will choose
You feel it in your heart
Step back, return to start

To put in effect the things you know
No more barriers it's time to grow
Time is now to find your way
Free your mind, break away

No rules, just free your mind
No rules, let go of that pride
No rules, don't live life blind
Realize what's inside

To put in effect the things you know
No more barriers it's time to grow
Time is now to find your way
Free your mind, break away
No rules, just free your mind
No rules, let go of that pride
No rules, don't live life blind
No rules
