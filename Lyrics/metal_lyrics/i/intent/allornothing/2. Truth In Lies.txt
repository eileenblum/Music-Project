Wake up each day
Seeking what's true
I'm surrounded by evil
What should I do?
My life's a gamble
Never knowing the deal
Gotta figure out what's fake
&amp; what the fuck is real

My thoughts are negative
I don't know what to do
I'll lose control
Before any of this is through

Wake up each day
Seeking what's true
I'm surrounded by evil
What should I do?
My life's a gamble
Never knowing the deal
Gotta figure out what's fake
&amp; what the fuck is real

Put up with your act
Now I can see
Done with your loves
It's time to break free
Made up my mind
Won't get caught in your trap
Your game is over
&amp; now I'm back

Done with your life
