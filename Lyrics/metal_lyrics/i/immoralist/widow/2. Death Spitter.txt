[ft. James Mislow &amp; Chris Whited of King Conquer]So think about 
every word before you say them
Drama infestation
Every step I take &amp; every thought I make
Ignorant persuasion
You're such a snake, 
every word you spit is poison
Keep your mouth shut
Your words hiss in one ear
&amp; slither out the other

SPIT DEATH
Motherfucker, every word you speak
I can't 
look you in the fucking face &amp; believe 
a single thing..
Your a waste of life so get the fuck away from me!

How many people in your web of lies
Every time you speak I fucking die inside
Genocide of the mind

The words that flow from your mouth
Spreads like a disease
Infecting the thoughts of every living thing

The only way to stop the disease
is cutting it by the throat
[2x]

Your just another two-faced motherfucker
Trying to get ahead in this world

You're a snake
Spit your poison
Fucking snake
