I can't live
In a world
Where we believe everything
And everyone
So we must question Everything
Everything. Everything.

We all are haunted
By our inner-selves
I can't fall asleep
Cause' my dreams bring me to my darkest place
I am so confused

Every single day I watch as my thoughts decay
I watch myself die over and over again

Lies-lies-lies

Question everything

Cause' I know nothing of truth
I wanna tear apart every artery
That keeps you alive
You must question everything

You know nothing
You're on your own
Question everything
That you don't know
You think you know everything
Open your mind, give in to your body

We are the legion who moves through the night
We are the nightmare that brings you fright
We are the legion who moves through the night
We are the nightmare that brings you fright
