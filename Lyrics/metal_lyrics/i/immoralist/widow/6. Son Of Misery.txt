You will never understand
True loyalty or pain
A life lived in regret
Is a life lived in vain

You will never see my face again
You will never hear my voice again
My eyes burn holes
In the back of your head

Every day you play these fucking games
I can't see you standing in front of me
I'm gunna die, we're both gunna fucking die
I will build our caskets out of your lies

So maybe next time
You will think twice
And you will realize
Life was all a lie

You low-life piece of shit

So show some respect
For the fucking dead
I build their caskets
Off every lie you said

You fucking piece of shit.
