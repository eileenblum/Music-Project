I CAN'T STAND TO SEE THAT
THAT FUCKING SMILE ON YOUR FACE

BEATEN, BROKEN, PUT DOWN
YOU BETTER RUN AND FUCKING HIDE

THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
THAT I AM GOING TO HEAR IT
YOUR EXISTENCE MEANS NOTHING TO ANYONE
I WANNA SEE YOUR LIFE IN SHAMBLES,
AND WATCH YOU WEEP

WHEN ALL YOU DO IS RUN AND HIDE
AND KEEP EVERYTHING LOCKED INSIDE OF YOU
YOU'RE JUST A CHILD
SO HERE'S A WORD TO THE WISE
YOU BETTER RUN AND HIDE
NOW IF YOUR FUCKING TIME
YOUR AT THE END OF THE LINE

YOU'D UNDERSTAND IF YOU KNEW HOW I LIVED
BECAUSE I'VE LIVED

A LIFE OF DISRESPECT

(MOVE)

A LIFE OF DISRESPECT

(I DON'T TRUST A SINGLE SOUL LEFT ON THIS FUCKING EARTH)

(OH)

A LIFE OF DISRESPECT.
