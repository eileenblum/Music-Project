Look me in my fucking eye
Tell me something that isn't a lie
You turned your back on a fucking brother
You turned your back on the entire family

No more brotherhood
That shit is gone
Everything I worked for now gone
You think you can just start over
But you can go fuck yourself

Over and over
Cycle after cycle
A mother fucking 
Repeat offender
But when you turn your back on a fucking brother
You turn your back on the whole fucking family

You turned our back on the whole fuckign family
Step back

Over and over
Cycle after cycle
A mother fucking 
Repeat offender

But when you turn your back on a fucking brother
You turn your back on the whole fucking family

I've forced my back to the world
You're all dead to me
