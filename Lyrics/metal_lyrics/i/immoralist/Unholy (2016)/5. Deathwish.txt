How does it feel to watch from above?
Judging us all one by one
Living your life by your holy standards
But once we're given sight you turn and run
Shrouded in malice, taught to fear progress
Brought to your knees, the end is upon us
Pay attention as the holy fail us
A mere examination of the world before you
At this point we mean nothing to any of you
In your minds we are all just useless
Animus shattered in to a thousand pieces
And thrown to Belial
A flicker of hope that there won't be punishment
For all of your delusions
Shrouded in malice, taught to fear progress
Brought to your knees, the end is upon us
You are not a martyr, no one will remember you..
I am not forgiven. And neither are you
Your whole life you spent searching for your purpose
Wasting time, idolized by your own perception
I am not searching for dispensation
I am hoping that's everyone abandons you
We have come to grant your death wish
We have come to cure the virus
How does it feel to watch from above?
Judging us all one by one
Living your life by your holy standards
But once we're given sight you turn and run
