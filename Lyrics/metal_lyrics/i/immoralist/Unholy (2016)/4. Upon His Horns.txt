[feat. Adam De Micco of Lorna Shore]Forced in to the light
Feel the hate flow through me,
Holy genocide
Serpents tongues on my cheek
I hear them whisper in my head as my body gets weak
Upon his mangled horns
I see the blood that was once taken from within me
I remember my last thought to myself
Is there's no point in calling out for help
I had nothing left, my life was so empty
But I wasn't done, hate sweltering within me
I want to see the world crumble to pieces
I want to hear the silencing screams
This is the beginning of my descent to the after life
We were born to turn to dust
And I am now the scapegoat for misery
As the darkness leaves my bones
I'm finally free
I remember my last thought to myself
Is there's no point in calling out for help
I had nothing left
My life was so empty
I wasn't done
Hate was within me
The tongueless hooded figures
They circle around me
I see the blood drip spit their mouths
As they scream deceits
Their convoluted messages
is the reason
I am now tormented
I am tormented
I've felt the true form of agony
I've seen pure innocence
Cut down before me
