Look at me I am the lowest of the low

I know you feel the Devil
He lives inside these walls
Inside my mind
Inside my thoughts
He fucking see it all

See you in Hell

You fucking want me?
Come &amp; get me
Soon enough I'll be putting you in your fucking grave
[2x]

We are scum of the Earth
When we die, we will just crawl back to the dirty
We live in a world of sin
You will bear witness

&amp; then the Devil said
You will witness the end

Unholy [2x]

The voices in my head crawl down my throat &amp; eat at me
They keep me alive but I just wish that I could die
Put an end to this fucking agony

Fucking end it

[Alex]
The Black Hand closes
Benighted mass writhe internally
It leaves me a threnody amidst the agony
Unholy
Ascendancy eludes the bindings of flesh

The Earth will be consumed
This is what you fucking prayed for
The Earth will be consumed
&amp; every single person will know
I am the lowest of the low
