[feat. Alex Terrible of Slaughter To Prevail]We are marked for death
No chance of life in this hell called home
No choice but to live with a heart of stone
I will night fight just to be a slave
Close my eyes and lower me in to my grave
We are marked for death
The false idols descendants
Living in the shadows
Feeding off your bad intentions
Four horseman of the apocalypse
They're coming for our heads
Too bad we're already dead
Bleed me dry
We are the marked ones
Take my life
We're the fucking marked ones
Our kind will soon become extinct
Gaps in time eluding the kiss of death
Every second spent breathing and waiting
They won't stop until they have our heads
To the gallows
Away with the marked ones
Sent to their death without explanation
No more words spoken, mo more souls taken
Just eternal rest for the ones below
Absolute genocide for anyone
With a reason to go on living
We stood no chance
This is the price for our sinning
Narrowly missing our chance at peace
It will be this way until the end of time
Hear the beckoning of souls set free
All around us as they whisper their lies
Bleed me dry
We are the marked ones
Take my life
We're the fucking marked ones
Give up everything
Give your life to the void of despair
No longer a home, no longer living in your own grave
I will night fight just to be a slave
