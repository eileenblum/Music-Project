[feat. Tyler Shelton of Traitors]Your tongue reek of lies
free their mind then fill them with poison
bigotry is malignant
We want peace not delusions
Sever the tyrants tongue
absolve yourself of your sings one by one
This is human nature
You won't exist much longer
I reject your sympathy
Promises all backed up by lies
Our hopes will pay for your monument
There is no hope as your build your wealth
On their ignorance
Severed tongues
And now they've sewn our mouths shut
Severed tongues
Their greed has blindfolded us all
Just a meal for the rats to feast
Severed tongues
We brought this upon ourselves
We've given up
But we just sit around and watch
They spew their lies
It is time we take our throne
Sever their tongues
The hour of penance is now
We have been seduced by their slander
They've made us believe that malice is the answer
We must bring them down one by one
We must sever their fucking tongues
They want me to
Obey, obey
And not question anything
Don't die for their mistakes
I've made myself forget
The lies that have been said
I'm lost in my own head
And every day I wish that it would end
Severed tongues
And now they've sewn our mouths shut
Severed tongues
Their greed has blindfolded us all
You can fool them
But you won't fool me
You say freedom, but it's slavery
Your reign will come to an end
Take back our throne take back our justice
Obey, obey
And not question anything
Don't die for their mistakes
