[feat. Adam Warren of Oceano]We all die alone
Bury yourself
Embrace the dirt
Give yourself
To mother earth
I don't want to live here anymore
I won't go down with the fallen
I embrace the life I was given
You don't want it
You don't deserve it
There will be zero absolution
I will drag you underneath
nothing more than human meat
I will make this hell for you
Within the depths of unearthed soil
My dark presence is beckoned forth
To relinquish a gift you've left abandoned, neglected in squalor.
Another futile soul extinguished as the flesh rots below.
You are reclaimed with the earth,
Now embrace the dirt.
I won't go down with the fallen
I embrace the life I was given
You don't want it
You don't deserve it
There will be zero absolution
Now I watch as the locusts swarm
Taking their true form
Unholy â the beings are drawn to the wicked
Bury yourself
Embrace the dirt
Give yourself
To mother earth
