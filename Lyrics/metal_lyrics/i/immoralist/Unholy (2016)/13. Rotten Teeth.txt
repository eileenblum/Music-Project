Eyes of Hell
Staring you in the face
Blind eyes, deaf ears
You're a fucking disgrace
To the life that you once proclaimed
Everyone you've ever known has forgotten your name
Shit

Burn everything that you've ever loved
So one day you can die the same
No purpose, no place
No value to your name
Yet you still come me
Like you think
That I could somehow still believe
I will spit on your grave
Serpent
Look me in my face
As I call you out on all your bullshit
You were a fucking mistake
Now the whole world will know your face
I will dig into my ears
&amp; pull out every lie you told
&amp; I will spend all of my days
Shoving every word back down your throat
I can't hear your lies
From six feet beneath
You are not who you claim to be

Burn everything that you've ever loved
So one day you can die the same
Your soul will decay

You are the reason
That we are here today
We hear his voice
We hear his name
As we both wither away
