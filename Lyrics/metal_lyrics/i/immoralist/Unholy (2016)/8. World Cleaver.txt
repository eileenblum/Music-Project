Dark thoughts all around
Trying to kill me
Perversion of the world slithering beneath me
I thought I put an end to all the blasphemy
These sinking thoughts inside
Form hands that claw at me
Born in the hive
Every choice is made for you
Vultures are blind
Desolation of the truth
The world cleaver will come and wipe the earth clean
I am immortal for I am void of all life
(void of all life)
I am the bringer of life
I am the son of misery
I am the father of death
I am immortal
I am the light
I'm the absent of intolerance
Born in the hive
Brought to life by malevolence
Manufactured disease for all
There's only one way to end
The serpents ritual
So bow your head
Kiss the feet of the dead
They lie to your face
But you believe everything they're said
We don't deserve this life
World cleaver
Disobeying what is right
World cleaver
I am the absolute
World cleaver
Death is the only truth
I am the bringer of life
I am the son of misery
I am the father of death
I am immortal
