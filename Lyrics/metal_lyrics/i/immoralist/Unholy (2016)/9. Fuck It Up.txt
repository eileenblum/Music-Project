Every time I find something I love
I fuck it up
Why do I even try?
I've ruined my whole life
Every single time
My life ain't shit and I'm over it
No love just hate
So cut the fucking games
You pissed on everything
That we were supposed to be
I can't think of a single time
That the words you said weren't some fucking lies
So take your shit
Move on with your life and get over it
Just get the fuck out of my life
I guess I'm meant to be unloved
