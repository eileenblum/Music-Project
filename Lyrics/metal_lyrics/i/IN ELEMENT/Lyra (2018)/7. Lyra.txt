Take me to that place where ego doesn't breath
Where all is harmony and everything coexist
Make me understand
Nothing ever stands still nor ever truly rests
Can we let it all go?
Traditions, dogmas, lies that blind our sight
To a higher state of consciousness
Of our body and soul

Beyond the glance of an eye
Lays the truth that seeks to hide forever

Between war and tensions we are born
Life is what happens all along

Where echoes inside of you have told
"One day, grief will be gone"

Close the cycle, follow the universal law
(that) all must move onâ¦

Into the night of our souls
Where pain took all hopes
And light has already gone
Is where we have to reborn

The war of duality

The love that you withhold
Is the pain that you carry
Lifetime after lifetime
On and on

But we are still searching for something
Our souls can never rest
We move between dissatisfaction

And life is a circle of pain

There we move along
And we lay down our head once more
To the truth that lies above
That we cannot understand

Into the night of our souls
Where pain took all hopes
And light has already gone
Is where we have to reborn

The war of duality

The love that you withhold
Is the pain that you carry
Lifetime after lifetime
On and on

There is no law in nature
There is no truth between the stars
My blood will be always boiling
As my eyes find the eternal night
