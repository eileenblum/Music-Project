You are
The great depression of my spirit
The meaning of desperation in each word
The misery inside my sorrow
The lack of sanity when I'm lost

No rational action
Every motive dies in each breath
Incoherence between body and mind
Erratic feelings rising once again

The absence of myself in everything I used to be
Or thought I was
When this will end?
I just can't
Just can't live this way

I'm gone
I'm lost
I will go
I will go through all
Just a sudden breeze of hope

Nowhere I will stand, and that's the truth
Isolated, forsaken with my deepest ghosts

One endless question
Keep coming back to me
Why do I keep shivering?
Why am I so weak
When the moon awakes the tide of you
And chokes me in my dreams

So I look into the mirror
And see just ruins and a petty mind

As I cannot stand the night
In times of need
In my lonely sigh
I choose to blame you for my life

I'm gone
I'm lost
I will go
I will go through all
Just a sudden breeze of hope

Nowhere I will stand, and that's the truth
Isolated, forsaken with my deepest ghosts
