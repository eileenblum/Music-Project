Personality structure
Conscious awareness to my desires
I'm beyond frontiers
I'm the one higher

Mass of instinctive drives, pulse and impulse
No judgment, no morality
Forbidden and repressed aims

This is the meaning of the "I"
The death of "we" and "us"
A million miles of apathy will be enough?

Is this the meaning of the "I"?

It will feed you up with chaos and pleasure
The addiction conquered your soul, on my knees
I need more

An inflated sense of self-worth
The conscious-thinking self
I'm the one, the most important
The everything, there's no one else

Self defense mechanisms
My walls, my defense,
Love can be eternal, so it's hate

Is this the meaning of the "I"?

It will feed you up with chaos and pleasure
The addiction conquered your soul, on my knees
I need more

With anxiety and vanity
I'm what I have, not what I have lost
