It's time to go through this tempest
The same I've walked one thousand times before
Deny my true, follow the lie
Never question my beliefs, there's no time
Let me stay in this comfort illusion

Why I should question myself?
"You" are the answer every time that my heart hurts

Projection
My turbulent feelings shall fall upon you
Rationalization,
The falseness in every believable thoughts

I'm running through
Never ending seconds,
Suffocating through them
Waiting for the second wave
Beating anxiety just for one time

The fear conquered my soul and mind
Erase this reality

Create my own, which I can control
When the night falls down
Loneliness crashes in me

Obsession drives me into desperation
Losing all resemblance with the past

Fear of losing you...
But for now, it's easy to suffer the same story
The page that we wrote long time ago
Written with misery in our hearts with meaningless hopes

I'm running through
Never ending seconds,
Suffocating through them
Waiting for the second wave

Beating anxiety just for one time
The fear conquered my soul and mind
Erase this reality
Create my own, which I can control
