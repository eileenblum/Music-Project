I am my perfect enemy
The face in the mirror
That haunts the remains of my sanity
Captive and confined in my own mistakes

Aggression toward the self
Hostile and aggressive
Brick by brick, step by step
Covering the footprints I once made
Set to repeat the circle again

Blood longing for hell
Staring with blind eyes wide open
Tomorrow will be a new day
With the same old mistakes
Hammering my present
For the actions I once made

(in the mirror) wake up right now!
There's nothing else I can do.
(there's nothing else you can do)
I'm still right here, keeping faith, shedding blood.

Give up, shatter all hopes, you and me...
We are a lost 'cause.

Precise mind killer machinery
Release the peace
Relieve the anguish
Create a brand new pain

Our suffering just for your pleasure
My body empty for the pain

Hostile and aggressive
Brick by brick, step by step
Covering the footprints I once made
Set to repeat the circle again

Blood longing for hell
Staring with blind eyes wide open
Tomorrow will be a new day
With the same old mistakes
Hammering my present
For the actions I once made

In the end who is the one to lose?
I'm alone.
We lose
