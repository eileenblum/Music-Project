Fear has conquered my soul
I count the hours for the sun to fall
I give myself to the wind

From wherever the pain should come
The fatal and silent blow
That would break my days
Should I embrace my tragedy?
The root of all beauty, the remains of my birth

Has been cut since the memory
Crawled inside my eyes like worms of fire

As I journey through the black breath
Soaked in stars
In the sky
The truth beneath
As I fall down

Lustral waters, red waters
Cleanse my body
As I journey through the black breath
Soaked in stars

I embrace my reflection,
The one that passed ages ago
And its hands touch mine
As we melt away together into the innocence of our death

How can I feel the pain of the knife that
Cuts the flesh when the winds
Of the night I yearn
Brings me melodies
Of the yester sorrows

No suffering between the eyes of the divine
Just a silent voice that shows the lies

Oh we've gone too far and the umbilical cord
That links me to the planetary surfaces
Has been cut since the memory
Crawled inside my eyes like worms of fire
