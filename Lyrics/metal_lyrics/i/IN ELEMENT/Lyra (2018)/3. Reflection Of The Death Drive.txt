Death instinct
Take me back into an inanimate state
Tends to denature the essence of survival
The negation of the will

Guilty by heresy
For the doctrine of damage

Repressed experiences
Sentence that transcend all limits
With agony

Repressed experiences
Belonging to the past
Negation of the will
Staying in the same stage (this life)
More suffering than delight

Compulsion of destiny
Makes me hold my angst
Deep inside the darker sand

In this confused territory
Where my spirit is frozen

In this labyrinth of my heart
I will do my time

Reflections of existence
And its lights

Reflections
Time to let it go
