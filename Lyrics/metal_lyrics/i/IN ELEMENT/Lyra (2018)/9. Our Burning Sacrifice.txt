Are you ready to end it?
We may have to die for it
Murdered by your cold dead hands
No trace, but still I have to cover the tracks

I'll take your hands to the grave
No one deserves your curse
No stairways to heaven
Without you the world would be a better place
Wherever I may go
I hear you say
There's no place you can hide from me on that way

Eyes wide open
That keep staring blank at me
The eyes that will remain
Haunting me through my days"

I'll drag out this roots of hate
Out of my fucking chest
I know how deeply they can get
If I don't spit it in your face

Like a lion
Hunting for a new flesh
How needs to pacify his anger
The need to end this hell
Out of control aversion for extreme
Hostility towards you and myself

Wherever I may go
I hear you say
There's no place you can hide from me on that way

Eyes wide open
That keep staring blank at me
The eyes that will remain
Haunting me through my days"

The plague within my dreams
I love you until I died
I remember what you said
Affection grief and regret

For every promises I made
Venom takes course
In tempo with the ethereal feelings
Of weakness and vitality
