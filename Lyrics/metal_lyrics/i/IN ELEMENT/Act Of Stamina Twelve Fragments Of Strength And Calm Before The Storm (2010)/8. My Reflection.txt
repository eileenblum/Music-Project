What does the mirror says?
When you are all alone
He lies
He lies to please you everyday

Well I guess I'll never now
How real was the truth I been sold
Well I guess I'll never know
The truth I been sold
I'll never know

My reflection
On your soul
My failure on your war
No trace left to follow
A veil of anguish and dust
A veil of anguish and dust

Reflection
Of the stranger in me
Reflection set me free
Take me back to yesterday
Reflection
Vanish the sorrow in me.
Reflection
Take the scars of my heart

Well I guess I'll never now
The meaning of your show
Just a scream for help? It was
Well I guess I'll never now

I can't believe that I m broken again
Sick of being sick and never change
Those words deceiving, once again in hell
Motherfucker, crying one more time for who?
You
Crying one more time for you

Look too the future and see
See the next fail
Crying one more time for you

Reflection
Of the stranger in me
Reflection set me free
Take me back to yesterday
Reflection
Vanish the sorrow in me.
Reflection
Take the scars of my heart

I m closer to be me
Just close my eyes
And it will end

So far from me
For you I was
The great mistake
That I love to make
