Why I can't
Comprehend Why I m here?
Why this
Is more violent Every time?
Why I can't
Take control of this mess?
Why this
Feel so unreal?

Why I need
Venom and hate to release my pain?

Why I need
To see your blood to set my mind free?

"Forever shine in the sun"
Once the lie I've made
The black birds of chaos
Spiraling into the sea of sanity
Why I can't
Believe this is real?
Why I can't
Accept you're my disease?
And I ll be forever shining in the sun

On the edge
Of the blade
Balancing
And
I won't fall down

I've wondered trough this circle for years
And nothing seems to change (seems to change, never change)
Because
I've learned to live hiding in chaos
Open eyes again hiding in chaos

Repeating the journey as the hero
Fragile ends infect my speech
Spend some time among the broken
Coexisting with the drama

Why I can't
Believe this is real?
Why I can't
Accept you're my disease?
Why I can't
Recognize you are not your
Reflection in my mind?

In this point
There's no turning back.
Impossible to define
A room with no doors
With one thousand questions

Answers drown in your
Selfishness
I been left to drown
In my own spiral of chaos

This is the end of this game
My final song.
Burning my soul to an ash.
Erasing your name from my skin.
This is the end of this game

Spiraling
Forever shining in the sun
Spiraling
Once the lie I've made
Black birds of chaos
Venom and hate
