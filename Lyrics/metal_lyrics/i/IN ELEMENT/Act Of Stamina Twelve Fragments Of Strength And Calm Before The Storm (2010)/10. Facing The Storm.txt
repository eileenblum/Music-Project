A call, a voice with few words
Outside the storm was beating the world

The way, a whisper in tears
"I want to sleep forever, forget me"
She said

She was leaving this world
And I was facing the storm
Frightened and cold

Rushing
The wind, my face is crushing
Exhausted
Body full of muscle burst

Facing the storm
The heart turned to stone in a small, ancient room
Where the wounded surround us
Faces in anguish, they cry for a dream
With every grasp of your hands

I feel more alone
And who
Was the wounded?
I feel more alone

Screaming in silence,
Drifting in chaos
A door to escape from all you are
Reality blurred by your own lies

Claiming you're right
Erasing your world
How can you say that?
Before what you've done

A call, a voice with few words
Outside the storm was beating the world
The way, a whisper in tears
"I want to sleep forever, forget me"
She said

Facing the storm
The heart turned to stone in a small, ancient room
Where the wounded surround us
Faces in anguish, they cry for a dream
With every grasp of your hands
You've killed
The one who gave you
A second chance to live
So don't talk about hell

I have crossed the storm
For you

I've fought yourself for you
I've watch you dreaming in hell
And I've steep in to those flames
I took the wheight on my back

Claiming you're right
Erasing your world
How can you say that?
Before what you've done
How can you say that?
Before what I've done.
Just silence you give
