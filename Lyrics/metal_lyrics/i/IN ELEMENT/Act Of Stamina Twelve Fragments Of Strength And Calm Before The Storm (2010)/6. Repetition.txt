The words came out of her mouth
Like stinging bees across my skin they crawled.
As the Venom runs through my veins
Her eyes turned black as my pain

Another face for all my fears
(This is) a reminder of what has been lost
A purpose in life.
A vision of what will be conquered

This is the first step of one thousand steps
Behind me, the same thousand steps

Will I shine?
when all light is gone
Will I fight?
When the battle is over
Staring right at me, from yesterday.
Sheltered (till) the beginning of a new end
Forever in fire, this shall be
Arising from ashes eternally

Tell me you are sorry
And fade away.
Like all of them.
Fade away.

(tell me you are sorry once again. I will scar another day. Walk away)

This is the first step of one thousand steps
Behind me, the same one thousand steps
Walked over and over again

Will I shine?
When all light is gone
Will I fight?
When the battle is over
Staring right at me, from yesterday.
Sheltered (till) the beginning of a new end
Forever in fire, this shall be
Arising from ashes eternally
