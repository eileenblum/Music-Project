Those nights I'll never forget
Wondering through a thousand years.

Solitude seemed so real
Emptiness filled my eyes
And desperation hummed her lies.

hummed her lies

Cracked walls, rough thoughts
A dark shape of what I used to be
Endless seconds
Dragging me again.

Once again I find myself lost in the crowd
Faceless bodies swirling all around
Searching for something to pacify myself
Like a lion hunting for self defense
My paradox of love and hate.

New life, new hope
Seems so easy to achieve
Same end: failure
It's funnier every time
For you, for her
For every fucking one.

I still chase the wind
In the moment I'm lost
I still chase the wind
For a moment of peace
I still hear the words.

And it's tearing me apart
From the inside out

Once again I find myself lost in the crowd
Faceless bodies swirling all around
Searching for something to pacify myself
Like a lion hunting for self defense
My paradox of love and hate.

Those nights I'll never forget
Wondering through a thousand years
Solitude seemed so real
And desperation hummed her lies
For every warm embrace
One cold night.
Not more not less
