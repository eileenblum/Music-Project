This time, with a reason I will fly
Beyond, in the sand
No more i'll be stucked
Above, the endless bright horizon

I will find
The way to break the cycle
That cages me inside.
Get a brand new skin
And follow me
Follow me if you can.
And follow me if you can

No more hostages of the rules
In the book of the blind
A long path
Filled with signs
Brand new map
I design
Cross the line
Time to Confront
What it's written my mind

This time
With a reason I will fly
In the sand
Beyond
No more I'll be stucked
above
The endless bright horizon

I will find
The way to break the cycle
That cages me inside.
Get a brand new skin
And follow me
Follow me if you can.
And follow me
If you can

No more hostage of the rules
Of the rules in the book of the blind
Time to confront
To confront what it's written my mind
Time to confront

A long path
Filled with signs
Brand new map
I design
Cross the line
Of the mind

Its time to break the cycle
Time to confront

Get a brand new skin
And follow me
Follow me if you can.
Time to confront
