Time is running up
And chances are gone
Remember these days
And take them into your memory
It will last more than the world

We don't ask ourselves
Why?
And now we are falling apart

Four spirits in pain
They are showing us
Their fierce in rage

Earthquakes shaking
Cities and graves
Tidal waves
Washing our sins
Firestorms eating our
Breath
As we watch hurricanes
Whipping this earth

The gathering

We don't ask ourselves
Why?
And now we are falling apart

These fighting souls the gathering
The fierce, the rage of the earth
These fighting souls the gathering
The fierce, the rage of the earth

Remember these days
And take them in your memory
Time is running up

Firestorms eating our
Breath
As we watch hurricanes
Whipping this earth

We don't ask ourselves
Why?
And now we are falling apart

These fighting souls the gathering
The fierce, the rage of the earth
These fighting souls the gathering
The fierce, the rage of the earth

We don't ask ourselves
Why?
And now we are falling apart

Remember these days
And take them in your memory
Time is running up
