(We go now)

As they crawl into the night
Rotten and bound
A breed forgotten and lost
Self destruction army

Void and empty disorder
No real thoughts
Just chemical lust
Leading every single movement
Of their lives
Spasms left and right
Hours lost in time
Eyes wide open

Eyes wide open
Without a single true image to analyze
Without control of their bodies and minds

Following a distant monochord sound
A false god. Technological fraud
Using simple sounds to hypnotize a numb crowd
They are hollow inside.

Bodies
Left to rot
Bodies
I've seen them lie and crush

They live their lies
Avoiding the light!
They live their lies
So afraid of the light.
They live their lies

I have walked among them
I have trusted in their useless words
I have looked into their eyes
Searching for a ray of light.

A breed with fake smiles
They cry and die when they wake up

Their loud noise it's just a farce
To hide their own thoughts
Their deafening silence
They are hollow inside
They are the lost and the rotten.

They live their lies
They avoid the light

Following a distant monochord sound
A false god. Technological fraud
Using simple sounds to hypnotize a numb crowd
They are hollow inside.
They are the lost and the rotten.
