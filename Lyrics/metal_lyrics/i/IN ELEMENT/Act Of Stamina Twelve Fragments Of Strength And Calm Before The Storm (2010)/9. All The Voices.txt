The end, nowhere
Here we still stand for
Us and the ones who believe in what we do
Evolving, rising from the ashes time after time
As the fenix time after time

In dreams this words
In paper I turn them to stone
Infinite Endless
In paper I turn them to stone

This is for all our voices
This is to last in time
Remain (remaining) strong and proud

There is no darkness without light
There is no falling without rise
There is no ending to this fight
There is no darkness without light

The end, nowhere
Here we still stand for
Us and the ones who believe in what we do
Evolving, rising from the ashes time after time
As the fenix time after time

My words for those who gives us strength
My words for those lasting memories

In dreams this words
In paper I turn them to stone
Infinite Endless
In paper I turn them to stone
