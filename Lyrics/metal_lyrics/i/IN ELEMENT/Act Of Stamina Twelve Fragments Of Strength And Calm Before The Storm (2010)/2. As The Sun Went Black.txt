Have you ever!
Have you ever lost your path?
In a grey world
That world inside your deep dark eyes.

I've seen them shine
And I've seen them cry
(Insecure, lost and numb.
Unable to see, unable to be)

Relentless ways of mind
Tearing all apart
I feel you like a stranger
Acting like another one
Relentless ways of mind
Tearing me apart
I feel you like a stranger
Acting like another one

As the sun went black

All the pain you claim as your hell (As the sun went black)
Is the pain you're giving me
The calmness you're trying to reach (As the sun went black)
Filling my days with agony

(That look I will never forget
no tears, no sympathy
Cold as ice, Dressed in black,)

Have you ever!
Have you ever tried to fight
For a reason.
Not just to hide

Your real fears sinking you deep down
Consequence engaged in every act
Blind words (as the sun went black)
Haunted past (As the sun went black)
Wounded soul (As the sun went black)
Present denied (As the sun went black)

Relentless ways of mind
Tearing all apart
I feel you like a stranger
Acting like another one
Relentless ways of mind
Tearing me apart
I feel you like a stranger
Acting like another one

As the sun went black

Never
I never wanted this
To be this
To be this way.
I've been in your darkest hour
Holding you as the poison faded

Like a forgotten god I grieve
Oblivion as my sun goes black
