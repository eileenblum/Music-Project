Beware of the words
That CAME out of a blind mind
Don't listen the livid lies
Of the ones that are always hiding
Stare straight to the sun
As they burn in my flames
Stay calm in the night
Watch the crawl in darkness
In darkness

As they speak a tale untrue
We become stronger than ever
As they speak a tale untrue
We rise over their heads

Cower to attack
The ones that do not recognize
The light that we create
The truth we hold in our hands
(Like Penteo ) you defy a god and die
God-like wrath
You will find
In our strong hearts

Focus distorted
Only searching the surface
Reality blurred by a curtain of
Systematic denial
Confounding the shapes
Of the real picture
Revolving the truth
Just in one way

As they speak a tale untrue
We become stronger than ever
As they speak a tale untrue
We rise over their heads

Cower to attack
The ones that do not recognize
The light that we create
The truth we hold in our hands
(Like Penteo ) you defy a god and die
God-like wrath
You will find
In our strong hearts

Disguised defamation of objectivism
Adoration of a subjective truth
Hand-made reality
The tale of a single voice

Corroding
The whole
Vision
Real facts
Thorn apart
Replaced by
An irrational gaze

Cower to attack
The ones that do not recognize
The light that we create
The truth we hold in our hands
(Like Penteo ) you defy a god and die
God-like wrath
You will find
In our strong hearts
