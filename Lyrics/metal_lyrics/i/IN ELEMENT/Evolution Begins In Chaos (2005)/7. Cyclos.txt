I fly over your regrets
Forever this shall be the way
Like a shining star I stand
Suspended in the black firmament

I flow between your mistakes
In your chaos I will never stray

Time will show the truth of what I am
Flowers withered with you as I remain
Free seeking my truth
Among your lies
Skyward my target is the sun

Mind devoid from reason
Unable to think right
Dwelling in your prison
Alone heating your life
Creating distorted realities
Sinking in your own fear of life

Time will show the truth of what I am
Flowers withered with you as I remain
Free seeking my truth
Among your lies
Skyward my target is the sun

My conscience is free of lies
My words are free of doubts
Forever is too much time to listen to your cries

Devouring your false reasons
With confidence I thrive
Deaf to accusations
The truth is in my mind

Devouring your false reasons
With confidence I thrive
Deaf to accusations
The truth is in my mind

Time eternally evolving
Stucked in your world of useless tears
Free seeking my truth
Among your lies
Skyward my target is the sun
