Replace by a new way of life
The eraser of centuries
Cybergod

We are so small
We where so strong
Future seems lost
Our system is done

Machines angels of hell
Humans screaming revenge
They are so strong
We feel it on our souls

Our world is now odd
For us no place to hide
Can we resist this?
Future

We are so small
We where so strong
Future seems lost
Our system is done

Our world is now odd
For us no place to hide
Can we resist this?

You all must be loyal to the new creator
Wires and plastic instead of your soul
You all must be loyal to the new creator.

Useless and ancient
Old kind of life
We the machines
Are ripping it down
Flesh, sweat and blood
Are denied in our world
