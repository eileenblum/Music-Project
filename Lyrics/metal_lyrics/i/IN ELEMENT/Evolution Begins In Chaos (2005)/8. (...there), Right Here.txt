Every day is a broken heart
Tomorrow could be your s
But today is mine

The meaning of the roses
Is painful in my heart
Cause no one its waiting for me, not even me...

What can you see? And feel...
What can you fell? What can you ... see?
Against my will, I'll kill myself to be
On that corner where I can see you from
(There...) right here...
