Siting in my room
Seeing with eyes close
Listening no one words
Thinking: life is cold
Falling with my thoughts
Feeling the darkness is close
Why this is so wrong??
Solution is unknown

I can
Be my savior
And overcome
This walls forever
Being just desperate
Drowned me in a jail
With madness I have play
And sadness was my friend
Just when I woke up
Listening to my own regrets
Making tears disappear
As I rise again

I won't live this way
I can't live this way

Being just desperate
Drowned me in a jail
With madness I have play
And sadness was my friend
Just when I woke up
Listening to my own regrets
Making tears disappear
As I rise again

Life is dark so I shine,
Life is sad so I laugh

I won't live this way
I can't live this way anymore

You were life, so am I

I can't drown with you
I could not change

I can't drown with you
Not this time
I will not change
Nevermore

You were life, so am I
