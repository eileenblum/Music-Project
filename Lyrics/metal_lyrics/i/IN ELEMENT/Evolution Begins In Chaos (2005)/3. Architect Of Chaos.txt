Behold the thousand paths that I've created
The endless spiral of my thoughts
Swirling across the silent emptiness
Of the universe and far beyond all you know

Confused, lost, wandering trough words
Like burning ashes of your world
Consciousness, fade away, lost again
In the stream of the sea that I've created

Architect of chaos
Hysteria generator

I am all that you see
I am all that you fell
Complex soul expanding
Trough your conquered body

Hear the audio-spell of my words
As you fall in a deep dream
Your, inner fear of the void
Leaves you mesmerized laying on my hands

Drift away by my claws
From inside your own mind
There s no way to fight
The reflex of the glint of my eyes
In your face an organic sign
Of your confused mind

Like a god
I manipulate
Your reactions

Architect of chaos
Hysteria generator

I am all that you see
I am all that you fell
Complex soul expanding
Trough your conquered body
Trough the solace of your crying
Complex soul expanding
Trough your conquered body

Like a blast of chaos
To your life
