DragÃ³n

I will shatter and break
The walls you create
I will collide with your vile face
With the strength Of my pride
Distrustful by nature
Cold bye designs
Strength full by nature
Perfect by design

Watch me
Love me
Hate me
Fear me

You want break me down
I knew it from a long time
Never be like you
Never fear you I always believe in me
Me and my ways
Forever Ill be
That you always fear

Hated for nothing
Attacked for envy
Never touched by your words
Meaningless in my life
You can never understand
What the fuck I am
You don't realize
What I've become

Watch me
Love me
Hate me
Fear me

You want break me down
I knew it from a long time
Never be like you
Never fear you I always believe in me
Me and my ways
Forever Ill be
That you always fear

You want break me down
I knew it from a long time
Never be like you
Never fear you
I always believe in me
Me and my ways
Forever Ill be
That you always fear
