Who am I?
Why am here?
Is this real?
Or my fears...?
I can't see
I can't feel
I can't lie
To my tears

All I know, all I hate, inside me
All I see, all I feel is loneliness, around me
All my thought, all my tears devastates, my own life
All I know, all I hate, inside my soul

Now I know
I can't scream
I realize
Of my life
I was lost
I was stucked
By your claws
In your
Realms

All I know, all I hate, inside me
All I see, all I feel is loneliness, around me
All my thought, all my tears devastates, my own life
All I know, all I hate, inside my soul
Soul

My soul is corroded
My flesh is the sign of distortion
Trough all of our lives
My eyes are suffused
With tears of fear
(I)Can't walk trough the light
I am suffering
