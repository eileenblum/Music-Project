As i look at your eyes
Weakness starts to rise
Frantic faltering
Lost in the maze of
Inexpressively of
Your mute cold eyes
I'm walking through the mist
So lost
Sluggish chaos runs inside
My confused soul can't understand
At the gates of your mind
I can't reach your thoughts
In the core of your eyes
Emptiness is what i see
I can't reach your thoughts
I can't feel your fears
I can't reach your thoughts
I can't reach your
Mute cold eyes
I, i can't find what you hide deep inside
Betrayed by the warm look of your eyes
Caged inside there's no light guiding me trough
The mist of your eyes
Sluggish chaos runs inside
My confused soul can't understand
What you think and what you feel
'cause i can't reach your eyes
At the gates of your mind
I can't reach your thoughts
In the core of your eyes
Emptiness is what i see
Cold as ice
I look through your eyes
Leaving them out of my life
Grinding weakness and confusion
Oblivion gets you
Out of my life
Cold as ice
I look through your eyes
Leaving them out of my life
Grinding weakness and confusion
Oblivion gets you
Out of my life
