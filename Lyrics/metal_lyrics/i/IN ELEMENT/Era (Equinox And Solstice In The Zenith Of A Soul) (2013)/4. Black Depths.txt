Why do we have to live this way?
Desire to sleep has vanished now,
Winter has arrived into the night,
In the awake of the storm.
Is there life for us out there?
Though passion stirs again,
In blood that flows away
Through the paths i once knew
When the black depths are silent
We can do nothing.
Frozen inside blackness enlight
Why do we have to live this way?
Desire to sleep has vanished now,
Winter has arrived into the night,
In the awake of the storm.
Is there life for us out there?
Though passion stirs again,
In blood that flows away
Through the paths i once knew
When the black depths are silent
We can do nothing.
We can be gods
For moments and rise out of the ashes
I cannot tell my story without reaching
A long way back.
