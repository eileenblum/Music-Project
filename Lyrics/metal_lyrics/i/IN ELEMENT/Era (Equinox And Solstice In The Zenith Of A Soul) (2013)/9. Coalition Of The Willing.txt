Motivated to feel the pain
No pain, no gain
My meanings are not related to sanity
Impulse, a sudden strong
And unreflective urge to act
Pulse of electrical energy
The stamina started to rush
A monumental stone structure
As a royal tomb in ancient sand
Is where dreams lay to rest?
Seems to be useless your shelters
And meaningless your words
Until we come back again
Willing hearts
Broken hopes
Reduce to small particles
Crushing and friction
Unawareness of the falling
My willing heart
Lies with no hope
Awareness of the falling
Structures crumble to fail
Remember we are here to stay!
Are you willing to lose for someone to gain?
What you looked up in the stars while it turns to dust?
In my words
Claims have being made
Coalition of the willing
To reach the zenith
As night touched the far horizon
We are the truth overhead
