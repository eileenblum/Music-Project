Day by day we live without a reason
Falling deeper in our own prison
And when we feel the fear strike
Our world collapsed and the light became black
We are the flock in the pursuit of needs
Ephemeral creations for the mass deception
Without think
Without feel
Someone's life became your life
What once was?
What could be?
Forever will be lost
The future turns to dust
In front of your eyes
With a costume of lies
You soul, your words, your thoughts
Are burning
In front of your eyes
With a costume of lies
Right before it starts!
Become in humbles slaves
Simple fact (not try)
Without think
Without feel
Someone's life became your life
We are the flock in pursuit of needs
Ephemeral creations for the mass deception
I want it all, i want it now
What for? why? no reason asked
Trapped in a phantom jail
Constantly in pain
As an eternal dream
Not strong enough to wake up
