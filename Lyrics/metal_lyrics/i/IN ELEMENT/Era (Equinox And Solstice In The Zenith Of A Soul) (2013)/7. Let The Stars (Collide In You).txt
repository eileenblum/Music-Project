Every saint has a past
Every sinner has a future
The brave man is not who does not feel afraid
But who conquers all his fears
This is where they pay for moments of pleasure
And nothing for their soul
A perfection of means, a confusion of aims
Main problem to be solved
We ourselves feel like just another drop in the oceans
Oceans would be nothing without that missing drop
We hide beneath the burning flame of time
Never-ending and timeless above us
Words delusions creates illusions
Infects your soul
Forever lost his essence
Immortal and divine
There is no tide in time
In searching for answers
To be the one (let the stars collide in you)
That follows and leads you
To be the one
That follows and leads you.
Thereâs no time
Let the stars collide in you
Burning and survive
Thereâs no time
