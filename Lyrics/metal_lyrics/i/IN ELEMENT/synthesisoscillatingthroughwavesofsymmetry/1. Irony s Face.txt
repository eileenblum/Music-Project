Into spheres of sorrow
Rotating souls
But soon the anguish
Is turned to stone
As I aim for the day
Where the image I saw
Overcome the reality you adore
So fragile your balance
So fragile our words
So fragile our words

The reminder of the real you
Falling into peaces
As irony smiles at me
With her angelical face
She said:
It was everything always clear

Re-stabilization mind process
Re-building the distorted objectivity
Broken words as fractured bones
Fractured bones as broken words
Burning every sing of certainty

Determination spiting venom
Erasing damage
Out of spheres of sorrow once again

Vertebras of a new era
Disintegrating upon time

The reminder of the real you
Falling into peaces
As irony smiles at me
With her angelical face
She said:
It was everything always clear
Looking trough the eyes of irony
Just to see your face again
Singing and playing again
I have learned to be deaf instead
Of plating with her

As I aim for the day
Where the image I saw
Overcome the reality you adore
So fragile your balance
So fragile our words
So fragile our words

Guilt it lies between me and you
We let it fly
Before we even knew how to walk together

Just an irony s game
Just a game between us
