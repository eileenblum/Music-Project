I been so afraid of
The audio torture
So silent, so cold
So loud and painful

Just stare right into my eyes
All those virtues still remain
So secure are my steeps
So sincere are  my words

(She wrote)
âYou look at me, you see me,
You listen all my words
And that is so divine
So importantâ

Just a recollection of words
Meaningless as your speech
Empty as the glance in your eyes
Just a recollection of words

It was said by a silent voice
It was buried by my soul
It was sealed, it was sealed
It was sealed by a mechanical movement
It was said by a silent voice
It was buried by my soul
The wound has been healed
It was sealed by a mechanical movement

Past, present, future just close
A chapter corroded by the stillness of time

Erase yourself
No remorse of what s left
No time, no tears, no hate
A simple walk away
Oscillating trough waves of symmetry

It started like an explosion
A frantic lack on energy
On autonomy
It evolved into dust
So dust we are
So dust we are now
Ashes after the fire
A sweet synthesis of the story
