Swarm of doubts been justify
Floating trough words
Strangers and too close

Roaming trough empty words
Written, spoken, roaring
The sound of a deceiving spell
Bending the structure
Breeding chaos
Bitterness and despise

Canât you see your lies?
Canât you see my eyes?
Canât you see your face?
Canât you see thereâs nothing left?

Searching the meaning of all those words
Engraved in paper and time
Show me the reason
The truth behind the wall of sweetened lies
Behind the gate, broken trust

Time, passing, hours, waiting

Seconds exacerbating my shadows and lights
Designing devices, to erase the need of a touch

Self-defeating environment selection
Contradiction burning traces of reason
Breaking the spine of comprehension

What was once bright
Turned to dust
Deep gazes of nights
Lost in time

Retrospection begins in the last words
Conceiving a new image of you
Asymmetric resemblance

Searching the meaning of all those words
Engraved in paper and time
Show me the reason
The truth behind the wall of sweetened lies
Behind the gate, broken trust

Asymmetric resemblance
Incompatibility
Characters contrast
Sharing selfishness
