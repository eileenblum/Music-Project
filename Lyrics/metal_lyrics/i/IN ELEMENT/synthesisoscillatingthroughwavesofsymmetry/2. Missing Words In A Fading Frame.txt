Is this my creation?
These are the ashes of what Iâve burned

Bright light blinding this eyes, cry
The scorching heat of fire
The never ending shape of hesitancy
Sinking present a storm of obliterating memories

The same eyes
Forever haunting this soul and I
Running, hiding, from the world
I once walked trough
Without the thick shell of time
Falling, crawling, and waiting for her ghost.

Distance, seems so unreal now
The journey becoming
A maze of intricate thoughts
An abstract room
Where I dwell

This is it
This mere instant
A collection of damaged memories
The abyss where I fall
Just an  incomplete tale
Missing words in a fading frame
The ashes of what Iâve burned

The unconscious oblivion machinery
Working tight, donât look back
Like an army marching
Straight ahead

The same eyes
Forever haunting this soul and I
Running, hiding, from the world
I once walked trough
Without the thick shell of time
Falling, crawling, waiting for her ghost.

This is it
This mere instant
A collection of damaged memories
The abyss where I fall
Just an incomplete tale
Missing words in a fading frame
The ashes of what Iâve burned
