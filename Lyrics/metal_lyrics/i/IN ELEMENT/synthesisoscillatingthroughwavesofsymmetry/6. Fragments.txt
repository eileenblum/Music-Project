Flawless engine feeding of each fragment
Fragments fueled by the whole
Unstoppable egos condensation
Axes grinding trough divided structures
Conducting pulse, shattering time
Low frequency creator, cracking walls

Look ahead
The storm is coming to absorb you
Adrenaline running, arteries burning down
Because you are run-trough a thousand electrical pulses
Towards to your brain
The downward sound of evolution

Harmony generator giving silence different forms
Words like chaos, audio aggression
Dragging you to the core
Of this entity, disguised as a storm
Taking down everything in its way

Tearing down all you know
Breaking down all you own
Melting down all you are
Every particle is consumed by this precise machine

A storm, an entity, a precise machine
Erasing, transforming, improving, evolving
It was written before
Evolution begins in chaos
Behold this is the second strike

A new breed, a new creed, a new design, a new era
Spreading trough all of you

Look ahead
The storm is coming to absorb you
Adrenaline running, arteries burning down
Because you are run-trough a thousand electrical pulses
Towards to your brain
The downward sound of evolution
Because you are
Run-trough a thousand electrical pulses
Towards to your brain
The downward sound of evolution
Burning down
Trough a thousand electrical pulses
Towards to your brain
The downward sound of evolution
