Future is behind us
Souls can't evolve
We will never find
The merger of our thoughts
Swirling dreams of endless
Skeins of distorted hopes
No god to save us
We are so
Alone
In this world
Of
Mass-produced self-hate thoughts
All our lives we tried to escape
This eternal sorrow soul
But we never killed these feelings
Blinded eyes can't see the shore
Future is a dark haze
Our own creation
Feeding itself
Of our dreams and aspirations
Swirling dreams of endless
Skeins of distorted hopes
No god to save us
We are so
Alone
In the storm
So aspirations never grow
All our lives we tried to escape
This eternal sorrow soul
But we never killed these feelings
Blinded eyes can't see the shore
All my life
All our lives
All our lives we tried to escape
