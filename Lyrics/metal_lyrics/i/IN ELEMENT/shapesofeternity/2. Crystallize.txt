Intricate structures
Random ideas of violent acts
This is how i love you; this is how i tell you
"I love you, no more"
Melody of pain
Sadness and disgrace
As we were together, we were gods
Now you are my element of hate
Crystallize my tears,
They born in my heart
Runs into my whole disgrace
Dies in your hands
To make it last forever
As eternal promises
State of being young
Itâs what i search in my soul
Attain eternal life in stage, is what i born to do
Parade of broken hopes and wasted dreams
Love me as the poison infects me
Runs through my veins, dies in my heart
To make me feel alive again.
Fears preyed upon my mind, keeping me awake
Of what i was, what we were and what we've become
