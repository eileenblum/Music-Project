Therapy therapy
Lost sight-I think I'm getting out of my range
Colors flash-now things are starting to get strange
Start it up-and you say you wanna get in on me, I need I need I need my

Therapy-now just relax we'll put your mind at ease
Therapy-but first you've got to say "pretty please"

Therapy therapy
Fire it up-put a little gas on the brain
All aboard-a ride on the newest thang
Chew chew-lookt out it's a runaway train, pure pain, no gain, insane it's

Therapy-and right before they dig into my mind
Therapy-the Dr. screams "let's got it's party time"

Therapy therapy
Left right left right-like every heartbeat needs a motion
Left right left right-like every wave needs a sea
Left right left right-like every teardrop needs a eyeball
Left right left right-you've got to name your therapy
Therapy! Therapy! Therapy!
Therapy Therapy
Snap pop-a sweet emotion just broke loose
Don't care-it ain't nothing I can use
Ha! Ha!-ain't it funny how we all abuse you choose, abuse, you lose now

Therapy-you know we want to help we really care
Therapy-but when your money's gone you're out of here!

I LOOK FUNNY?
