Infectious Grooves is on the house
Diba daba doba daba hey hey hey

Straight from another world another time another thought
We've come to save that beat to free the groove and watch you rot

Sweet feeling-can't stop it no! no! no!
We're gonna punk it up and funk it up!

Damn right we got the ways we got the means we got the feel
We've come to bust the grooves that everyone will want to steal

Sweet music-can't stop it no! no! no!
We're gonna punk it up and funkt it up!

And then the day will come when all the world will come to see
The knighting of the sound that's spreading infectiously

Sweet revenge-can't stop it no! no! no!
We're gonna punk it up and funk it up!
Well I'll punk you up and then I'll funk you up

Go cyco go cyco go cyco
Kick you with the beat kick you with the groove
Kick you in the butt now you're booty's on the move
Hit you with our feel hit you with our sound
Hit you with our zak how your booty shake around
Go cyco go cyco go cyco
Well I'll punk you up and I'll funk you up!

Punk it up funk it up we punk it up and funk it up
Jam it up and slam it up
Punk it up diba doba daba hey hey hey
Infectious Grooves blitzkrieged the house
