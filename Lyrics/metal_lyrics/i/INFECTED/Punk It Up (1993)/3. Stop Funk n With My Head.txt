Hey hey hey somebody's always funk'n with your head
No matter where you go you know you just can't stop people
from funk'n with your head
I was hanging around wasn't making no sound then you
come on down but you say that thing to me
With your runny nose and your out-of-date clothes and you still are
playing with G.I. Joes so stay away from me

[Chorus:]
So why you fu why you fu fu funk'n why you funk'n with my head
Hey hey hey somebody's always funk'n with my head
No matter where I go I know
I just can't stop people from funk'n with my head

You got your attitude and you're getting crude and you're
thinking you're rude
But you just ain't got she with me
And you ain't got a clue and you smell like pu and you can't even
Walk with your size 20 shoes so step away from me

[Chorus]

Funk it up
Can't you hear what I just said stop that funk'n with my head

Hey hey hey somebody's always funk'n with my head
No matter where I go I know
I just can't stop people from funk'n with my head
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey watch the funk'n with my head
Don't matter what you know don't matter what you show doesn't matter
Where you come or where you're gonna go when you're funk'n with my head

[Chorus]
