[Chorus:]
I want it I need it I'm headed out for something to break
I got it I'm feeling it I'm headed out on a monster skank

My feet are moving faster than my mind can do no thinking
My body's twisting in contortions that weren't meant to be
My head is spinning like a yo-yo that don't know no better
Off to the special place where there is only room for me

Have a little dance with a twist-hear you were hungry-eat a fist

[Chorus]

My mind paints pictures but I couldn't find no frame to fit it
Only an artist can create what he don't understand
I tried to tell you but you didn't have no time for reason
Off to my special place where only I am in command

What's to skank?-monster skank'n
Aye got something break'n-we've gone monster skank'n

Roses are red-violets are blues-you're uglier than a monkey-you should live
in a zoo

[Chorus]

Shoot off your mouth don't like what you said-here's my response a boot to
your head

The wise man feels no pressure then he tells you not to worry
Your inspiration hits me like a ton of falling bricks
Lost in a cemetery of forgotten resolutions
Off to my special place where I can break all that you fix

Aye gone monster skank'n-I don't need nobody
I think something's break'n-I've gone monster skank'n

Is it skank? Monster skank
What kind of skank? Monster skank

It's a monster-a scary scary monster!
Aye got something break'n-we gone monster skank'n
It's a monster
