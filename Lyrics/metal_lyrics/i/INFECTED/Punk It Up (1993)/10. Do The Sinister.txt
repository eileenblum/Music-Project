Come on into my mind, into my heart,
into my thoughts and into my soul
Come on into your mind, into your heart,
into your thoughts and into your soul-do the sinister

[Chorus 1:]
Come on come one come on do the sinister come on
come on come on hey hey hey

[Chorus 2:]
The minister is getting sinister the minister of the sinister-
you're messing with
The minister of the sinister the minister is getting sinister

Why you always bugging-what you want with me
Why you always tripping-just you let me be
Ain't no point in knocking-ain't nobody home
Ain't no point in talking-just leave me alone!

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

Into the mind, into the heart, into the thought, into the soul
Out of the mind, out of the heart, out of the thought, and out of the soul

Why you always bugging-what you want with my
Why you always tripping-just you let me be
Ain't no point in knocking-ain't nobody home
Ain't no point in talking-just leave me alone!

Sin sin ha! ha! come on sin sin do the sinister
Sinister surf mind raid
Cyco surf min raid
What I want I do it
What I need I take it
If I want I'll do you, you been warned
What you want won't happen
What you know don't matter
What you feel I give it right here and right now
Right here and right now
Right here and right now
Right here and right now
Do the sinister
