Groovalistic

Yesterday I struggled a little less than today
I locked it in a brain cell and I threw the key away
Don't know what I was thinking-then again I do
I lock my thoughts in cages like the animals in a zoo
So please don't feed the cyco-and I don't mean with food
Cause my mind feeds on hatred-and you get me in the mood
So are we having fun yet? Can you feel the pain?
Cause my mind functions perfectly on tangents skewed insane

[Chorus 1:]
She said, "If I would of then I could of but it's unrealistic"
And I said, "So why you always gotta be so damn pessimistic"
And she said, "If I could of then I would have but it's unrealistic"
And I said, "If you could of then you would on infecto groovalistic"

[Chorus 2:]
Groove a little high groove a little low groove a little in between
Groove a little hot groove a little cold groove a little bit in my scene
Groove a little left groove a little right groove a little something with
me
Grove a little sex groove a little love Infecto is the way it should be

Groovalistic

So much for smart thinking the odds weren't on my side
But ain't it fun to gamble double up and let it ride
I could of been more thoughtful I could of walked away
But I ain't afraid to say I got nothing left to say

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

Groovalistic oh no! infecto groovalistic
I could of made it touching or full of tricky rhymes
I could of been more thoughtful-I could of walked away
But since I got the time I got one more thing left to say
I hate stupid people! (obviously a lot cause I say it enough)
Stupid-A person that has the capabilities to think and or understand but
refuses to use it

THANX BUT NO THANX
