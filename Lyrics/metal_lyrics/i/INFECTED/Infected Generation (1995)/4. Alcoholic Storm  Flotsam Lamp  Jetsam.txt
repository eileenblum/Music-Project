I'm on ship in the sea of alcoholic drinks
Enjoy the sunshine in my pleasent trip
White sea-gulls flies above the waves
Diving in abyss big ice-blue wales

And the sudden it all changed at once
Weather is beckoming like in cold winter month
Sky now is grey
Clouds everywhere
Wind has been soft
Is already so strong
Darknes is near
Real life not plays
Screaming at fear
Now I will pay

Waves are so high
It's storm attack
Alcohol splashed
Are flling the hold

My ship is drowned but I'm enjoed
Flotsam and jesam It's my ugly joy
And I scream,and choke,and frig
I will be always drinking as a pig

FLOTSAM AND JETSAM
