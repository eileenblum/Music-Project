They have come here by thousands
From distant Empire of Rome
With promises and words of peace
Yet showing their weapons of gold

This will be the fight
Of all your life
Imponence and discipline
Against barbarian wrath
Legions!

They will divide and conquer
To rule with iron hand
And civilise us with tyranny
While plundering our homeland

This will be the fight
Of all your life
Imponence and discipline
Against barbarian wrath
Legions!
