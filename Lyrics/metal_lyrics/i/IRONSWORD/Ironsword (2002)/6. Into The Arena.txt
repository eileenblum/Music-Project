Far from home I feel so alone
No will to live inside this cell
War prisoner, chained forever
Time has come for a last farewell

Trumpets now sound exciting the crowd
A bloody spectacle will soon begin
I choose my weapon and meet with fate
Hail to the emperor, kneel before him

Into the arena
Gladiators fight till they die
Into the arena
Only the strong will survive

Bowdown or feel the whip
You are forced to fight
I will challenge the champions
Hatred burns within
Standing face to face
Who will match my fury
Wargods watch upon me now
Or the hell with you...

The combat I won, there's no one around
Just broken bodies and pools of blood
No will to live, it's kill or be killed
My time to die has not yet come

Into the arena
Gladiators fight till they die
Into the arena
Only the strong will survive
