Riding through the night
Warriors born to fight
Living by the sword
Only care for pillage
Rape women and drink wine
The scourge of war breaks loose

Hear the call of doom
In the night
Call of doom
You will die if you hear
The call of doom

Bringing pain and death
No where to run or hide
You can't escape their wrath
War trumpets sound
They stealed the king's crown
And claimed as their own

Hear the call of doom
In the night
Call of doom
You will die if you hear
The call of doom

Riding through the night
Warriors born to fight
Living by the sword
No mercy is given
Only broken bodies lie
And smoke from the ashes
