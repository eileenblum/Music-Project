All raiders come madden for greed
Who will defy the warrior king

Shinning all so bright
The crown that stands for might
Made of gold by the Metal gods
Here I am to claim
I'm the king of all kings!

I rule this land I am the king
Bound by Metal defender of steel

Shinning all so bright
The crown that stands for might
Made of gold by the Metal gods
Here I am to claim
I'm the king of all kings!

And if the crown be stolen
And if I ever fall
And if your march be ceased
Eternally, king of all kings

The Metal gods crowned his son
Will you follow the chosen one?

Shinning all so bright
The crown that stands for might
Made of gold by the Metal gods
Here I am to claim
I'm the king of all kings!
