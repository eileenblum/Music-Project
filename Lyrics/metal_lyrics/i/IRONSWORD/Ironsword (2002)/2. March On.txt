Ride, ride
Ride like the wind
Tonight we ride
With fire and steel
Ride on
Riding the sky
Tonight we ride
And fear not to die

Winds of war blow tonight
This is the new dawn
Metal warriors wait a sign
To march on...

Fighting for Metal
Till' the last breath
Defending the faith
In glory or death
We ride with the storm
Blackening the sun
For all Metal warriors
Freedom will come

Winds of war blow tonight
This is the new dawn
Metal warriors wait a sign
To march on...
