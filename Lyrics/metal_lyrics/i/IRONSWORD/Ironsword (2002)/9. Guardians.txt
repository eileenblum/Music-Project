Lost in a valley
You found the way
So secret and forgotten in time
You are the chosen
To pass these gates
Into the mountain cave
Enter the temple
Of the ancient ones
Only you has the key
Reveal all riddles to inherit
The sword of sacred steel

Guardians
Guardians of the sacred steel
Guardians
Guardians of the sacred steel

Summon the steel
You hold in your hands
Forged in thunder and storm
Out of vulcain's fire
It burns without touch
An inner voice had call you there
Pure at heart you succeed
But now you must pay
With your life
The guardians wake
From their sleep

Guardians
Guardians of the sacred steel
Guardians
Guardians of the sacred steel

Spreading their wings breathing fire
Hallucinating visions and crystal gleams
The gates are closing the temple cave in
Quartz light guide to end your quest...

Guardians
Guardians of the sacred steel
