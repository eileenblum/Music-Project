Now listen well
If you survived
From ancient kingdoms
We have arrived
All Metal warriors
We will unite
So wield thy swords
Come join the fight

Ironsword... Ironsword...

We'll lead the road
To all your dreams
Where all are one
As Metal kings
So let's ride on
Throughout the world
Our battlecry
Can now be heard

Ironsword... Ironsword...

Now listen well
If you survived
From ancient kingdoms
We have arrived
Our fate was sealed
By the ironsword
That brought pure Metal
And magic of old

Ironsword... Ironsword...
