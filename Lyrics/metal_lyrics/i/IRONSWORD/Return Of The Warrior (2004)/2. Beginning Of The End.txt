It's the beginning of the end
For the age we descent
Greed led to its fray
Hyborian kingdoms swept away
Over the ruins stand new thrones
Made with human bones
The heathens' siege to slaughter all liege
Before the new dawn

We shall fly from Valhalla
Ragnarok calls for the Einherjer
The horn Gjallar was blown
The gods now march across Bifrost

Throughout centuries before this life
In Atlantean rhymes
Valusian kings
have whispered to us inside the mind
To never banish the lore of the past
From it we shall learn
Of wars lost to man
And all the chaos yet to come

We shall fly from Valhalla
Ragnarok calls for the Einherjer
The horn Gjallar was blown
The gods now march across Bifrost

We shall fly from Valhalla
Ragnarok calls for the Einherjer
The horn Gjallar was blown
The gods now march across Bifrost

And a sword shall be the key to free our destiny
Yet Cthulhu sleeps deep down the ocean keeps
