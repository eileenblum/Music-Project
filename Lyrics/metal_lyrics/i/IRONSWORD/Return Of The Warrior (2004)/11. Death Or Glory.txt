In fire we were sworn many ages before we were born
In battle we shall die and to Valhalla ride

Let the arrows fly... Let the axes clash...
Let the arrows fly... Let the axes clash...
Death or glory

Baptised in blood and ice, to triumph at any price
Warlords bound by one fate, the glorious deeds to take

Let the arrows fly... Let the axes clash...
Let the arrows fly... Let the axes clash...
Death or glory

We would rather die in honour than live without glory
For a beautiful death lends life honour

Knowing not fear or defeat
Slaying the strong and the weak
Surrounded by our fallen foes
Sweet music their dying woes

Let the arrows fly... Let the axes clash...
Let the arrows fly... Let the axes clash...
Death or glory
