We are the pirates of Vilayet Sea
Sailing away to lands of mystery
Looting treasures at Turan's coast
But tides of war slowly approach

Upon our masts, black flags fly high
Ready for boarding, we win or die
Follow the queen and be free
Our dragon sails across the sea

We are the scourge of the bloody coast
Empty your jars for final toast
Weigh anchor and hoist the sails
The buccaneers crave for more forays

Upon our masts, black flags fly high
Ready for boarding, we win or die
Follow the queen and be free
Our dragon sails across the sea

We are the red brotherhood
Through stormy waters and wild flood
The pounding splash an the prow
Set the course back to our burrow

Upon our masts, black flags fly high
Ready for boarding, we win or die
Follow the queen and be free
Our dragon sails across the sea
