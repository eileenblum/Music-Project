Beyond the borders of Koth and Shem
Searching the splendor of the dreaming west
Crossing Corinthia, Ophir lies ahead
The road of kings is ours again

In the night
Barbarians ride
Throughout Hyborian world

Zingara and Argos our final halt
Adventurous life on the main trade route
Triumvirate, brothers of the blade
It is our fate to battle and raid

In the night
Barbarians ride
Throughout Hyborian world

One day Aquilonia shall be overthrown
Conquerors crowned grasping the throne
To Zamboula's tavern we return tonight
A rest fit for kings with wenches and wine

In the night
Barbarians ride
Throughout Hyborian world
