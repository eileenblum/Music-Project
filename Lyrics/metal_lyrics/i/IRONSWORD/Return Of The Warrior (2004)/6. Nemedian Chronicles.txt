A world of demons and gods
Savage battles, bloody wars
A warrior's fate lies on the blade
While martyrs rest without a grave

Oh I sing the chronicles of Nemedia
Oh I sing the chronicles of Nemedia

Sorcerers cast their spell
Primeval monsters out from hell
Baleful spirits stalk at night
Nameless nightmares to human sight

Plunder raids across the lands
Libertinage at scoundrel's den
Is this the life you longed for?
Hyboria welcomes evermore

Oh I sing the chronicles of Nemedia
Oh I sing the chronicles of Nemedia
