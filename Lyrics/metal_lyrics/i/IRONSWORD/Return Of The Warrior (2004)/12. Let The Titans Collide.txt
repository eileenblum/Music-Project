Druids knelt throughout long years
Before the altar stone
To revive primordial creation
Praying for the world they once knew

When Men and Gods were as one
And walked upon the Earth
Until the balance was disturbed
And in wrath the skies did burn

Titans collide - the gods return for us
Mortals fed with desire, the whim of divinity

Few mortals dare to usurp
And enslave the gods from above
The lust for power of the Universe
And enjoy the spoils of all worlds
Transgressing the laws of nature
In the greatest battle ever seen
Let the titans fight one another
In the end, none shall win

Titans collide - the gods return for us
Mortals fed with desire, the whim of divinity

Cataclysm before their eyes
Cities crumbled into the sea
They caught a glimpse of nevermore
Drowned empires for all eternity...

Glacial tears brought the deluge
From the depths echoes the call
Ancient ones shall awake once more
Resurrected to free us all
Out of death shall come new life
The druids still wait for a sign
Thus another epoch has ended
Giving birth unto our time

Titans collide - the gods return for us
Mortals fed with desire, the whim of divinity
