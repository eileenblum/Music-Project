The first masters came
With all their might
Through blood and iron
They did thrive
But shall not see
Atlantis flee

Rise of the first masters
Warriors at the edge of time
Rise of the first masters
Warriors at the edge of time

The savage Picts
Shall rule one day
While the Lemurians
Turned into slaves
Sons of the sun
Next heirs to come

Rise of the first masters
Warriors at the edge of time
Rise of the first masters
Warriors at the edge of time
