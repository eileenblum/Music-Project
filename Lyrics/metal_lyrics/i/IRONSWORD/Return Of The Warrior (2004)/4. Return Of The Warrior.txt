He rides alone throughout the steppe
A free will path lights his quest

Coming from the new dawn
A message still to carry on
Against all odds he changed his fate
To search the dome of the elder's wake

The return of the warrior
The return of the warrior

He has brought forth new life
Reflecting eternal sacrifice
Kept denying what Norns decided
Left the gods of death eluded

The return of the warrior
The return of the warrior

He rides alone throughout the steppe
A gift divine at a cursed quest

A travelling spirit, shadow or man
That forged his fate by his own hand
In the dome he will find the key
To answer his cycle of immortality

The return of the warrior
The return of the warrior
