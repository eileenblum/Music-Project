I don't think that it's
Gonna rain again today
There's a devil at your side
But an angel on the way

Someone hit the light
Cause there's more here to be seen
When you caught my eye
I saw everywhere I'd been
And what I go to...

You came on your own
And that's how you'll leave
With hope in your hands
And air to breathe

I won't disappoint you
As you fall apart
Some things should be simple
Even an end has a start

Someone hit the light
Cause there's more here to be seen
When you caught my eye
I saw everywhere I'd been
And what I go to...

You came on your own
And that's how you'll leave
With hope in your hands
And air to breathe

You'll lose everything
But in the end
Still my broken limbs
Will find time to mend

More and more people I
Know are getting ill
Put something good on the
Ashes now be still

You came on your own
And that's how you'll leave
With hope in your hands
And air to breathe

You'll lose everything
But in the end
Still my broken limbs
Will find time to mend
