[originally performed by Sisters Of Mercy]

Gimme the ring, kissed and told
Gimme something that I missed
A hand to hold, wild and what it seems....
Kill the King, when love is the law
And the we'll turn round....
Gimme dream child
And do you hear me call?
On the loan and on the level
....still on the floor
Sing dream child
And do you hear at all?

Hey now, hey now now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now....

Hey now, hey now now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now....

Gimme siren, child, and do you hear me?
Gimme siren, child, and do you hear me call?
Sing, child, of right and wrong
Gimme things that don't last long
Gimme siren, child, and do you hear me call?

Hey now, hey now now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now....

On daze like this
In times like these
I feel an animal deep inside
Heel to haunch on bended knees
Living on if and if I tried,
Somebody send me please....
Dream wars and a ticket to seem

Giving out and giving in
Selling the don't belong
Well, what do you say
D'you have a word for giving away?
Got a song for me?

Hey now, hey now now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing This Corrosion to me
Hey now, hey now now, sing like a healing hand

I got nothing to say I ain't said before
I bled all I can, I won't bleed no more
I don't need no one to understand
Why the blood run hold the highered hand
On heart
Hand Of God
Floodland and Driven Apart
Run cold
Turn
Cold
Burn
Like a healing hand
Like a healing hand
Like a healing hand
Like a healing hand
