[He:]
I know your thoughts about your guilt
Please let me see your wounds
I know that's more than you can believe
So show your heart to me

[She:]
It's an endless torment
I need to believe we can be saved some day
From this hell we dug

[He:]
Saved from ourselves

[She:]
Hear the devil's angels
Whispering those cursed words again
Cursing us to be the forsaken of our God

[He:]
The devil's angel is our faith
Taking our light away
Believing in lies we'll fall down
Into our sickness way

[She:]
Life was once so hopeful
But we killed it with our hands
I cannot face this hell we live in
Can we be forgiven?

[He:]
Face the death of your God
He can't release your soul from your own hell
Then save yourself from you

[She:]
How dare you say that my God is dead?
I always waited for him as a forgotten daughter

And all those lies that they told me
Are versions of a distorted dream

[He:]
Oh, no! They cannot see
This life with blood and cruelty
Take that? That is my heart
The real true god of life and dignity

[She:]
This heart is the abode of our soul
And in both of us
He can't die
He's our guide and our love
It's our master
It's you
