[She:]
We were born with the tools to see
But the dogmas have blinded us
Following standards and fully controlled
Our conscience was buried
Now it's time to find our way back home

Through culture and religion
Our minds have atrophied
Adapting to this sick way of life
Our lives have been meaningless
But I'm returning home
Now I can take your hand

[He:]
Inside my dream
You became my savior
And we were weak
But through our Self
We save our souls

[She:]
I cannot free you from this chaotic way of life
But I can free your true Self
You can live by the laws of nature
And be a new kind of enlightened being

All those Gods that repressed us
Never existed and I realize
That I was always by myself

I can walk
By me
With my life without this God
