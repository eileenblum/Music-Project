What is finished it`s the individual that`s finished
It`s the single, solitary human being that`s finished
It`s every single one of you out there that`s finished

Because this is no longer a nation of independent individuals
The whole world is becoming humanoid - creatures that look human but aren`t

So if you want the truth, go to your gurus, go to yourselves
Because that`s the only place you`re ever going to find any real truth
Because, man, you`re never going to get any truth from us

We deal in illusions man none of it is true
But you people sit there day after day, night after night, all ages, colors, creeds

In God`s name, your people are the real thing!
We are the illusion!
