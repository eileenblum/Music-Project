[She:]
My soul is blind
And I was deceived by the time
How could I lose the control of my life to my own thoughts?

[He:]
Your spirit is trapped
By your own addictive thoughts
Rescue him from this mental hell
Pulling out the life from its real source

[She:]
Those foolish thoughts blind my eyes
Now I can see the holy truth
Because your love consumed all that I am

[He:]
Don't fool yourself
By confounding love
With a morbid dependence
To truly love you must leave the mind behind
To become a being free from your sins

[He/she:]
The sins I quote are your internal ghosts
In which you believed like a naive child
(The sins you quote are my internal ghosts
In which I believed like a naive child)

[She:]
Your words released me from the tricks of my mind
Now I behold the true grace of life

Now my spirit is free
He can fly away
Then I see the world in its true form

I don't want to take your hand
I don't want to jail you
Your freedom is what I desire

[He:]
Your spirit can flow through
The seas of his creation
This purest form of being
Will create the world that you wanted to see
