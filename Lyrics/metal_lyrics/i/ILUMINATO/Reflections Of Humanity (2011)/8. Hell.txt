[He:]
Intense fire!
Will I be sacrificed in this chaos?
We need to be saved from this Hell we are in
You!
In the sky
In the stars

[She:]
Me
I am your awakening God
I want to set you free
From this cold winter you trapped yourself
Lightning your hidden flame
You are trying to exile
All of your fears inside
So if you want to be free
Listen to me

[He:]
In all this time
That I've been questioning your existence here
You have not appeared to show your compassion
So are these the means to show us the way?
How can I see the truth by myself?
And where were you in all this time that I was in dark?
I want you to hear my screams
My screams for stop

[She:]
You will only understand me
When you know your Self
Leaving behind the reality that they sell to you
And watching it on your own

[He:]
And so, and, and so?
Will I ever be the chosen one?
If I believe in this fake Christ
Will I never reach this far sky?

[She:]
The sky is inside you
And you are free from
All those lies they told you to believe
To be less than an immortal being

[Howard Beale:]
I don't want you to protest I don't want you to riot
I don't want you to write to your congressman because I won't know what to tell you to write
I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime on the streets
All I know is that first you've got to get mad!
You've got to say "I'm a human being, god damn it! My life has value!"
