[He:]
With our minds addicted to globalization
We lost our pure nature
And we entertain ourselves to the point
Of becoming thoughtless slaves of this circus world

[She:]
I don't know how to face the world
If I don't know its face
But I'll content myself with my own world

[She/he:]
All their broadcasts are blinding my eyes
They control all of the truth
To feed their endless lies

[He:]
Listen to your deepest voice
Screaming to be free to build a free world

[She:]
Free my soul
Of remaining trapped
In this rotten passage
To oblivion

[He:]
Death
Pain
Scream
Lies
This is the last chance for you to fly!

[She:]
My wings are now hardened
By the mould of this world
But I can't let go of this flight
I'll built it again with the strength of wisdom
And I'll fly to my home
