[He:]
Now it's time to do your last ride
And I will be your guard and your guide
Through the true road in this fake world

Reborn in Heaven
Or burn in Hell
Then you can be free from your sins

[She:]
Far away from the valley of pain
There is no guilt and no shame
Now light fulfills my soul
I became a sun through you

[He:]
Now it's time to do my last ride
And you will be my guard and my guide
Through the true road in this real world

Reborn in Heaven
And not in Hell
Now I can be free from my sins
