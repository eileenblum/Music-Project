Leaving the everyday life
Enter the original world
Deep roots reunite
Embraced by the ancient

Plugging into the pure
Eating the forbidden fruit
Exploring the mightiest mind
Scorching through the memories unknown

Front seat to the freak show
Abnormal life portrayed
Reveal the truth of ages
The law of man betrayed

Driven beyond comprehension
Obsessed by all obscene
Engulfed in a hail of broken dreams
Senselessly drowned in sin and misery
In sin and misery

Plugging into the pure
Eating the forbidden fruit
Exploring the mightiest mind
Scorching through the memories unknown

Morbid black possessed visions
A plague for all deceased
Suffer the trademark of disharmony
Everythingâs burnt to ashes

Driven beyond comprehension
Obsessed by all obscene
Engulfed in a hail of broken dreams
Senselessly drowned in sin and misery

The ecstasy of life is gone
In your bleeding palace
Time for change
Make your move now-
Awakened wisdom
Sets the stage
What they consider normal
I think thatâs insane
