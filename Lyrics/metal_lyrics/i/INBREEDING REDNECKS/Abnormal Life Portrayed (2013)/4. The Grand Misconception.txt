The educated tie you wear
Fits the leading emptiness
In Nothing to believe
A link to catastrophe

Procreation of the wicked
You bring famine and drought
Someday you will Succumb
At the gates of your devastation

With your inbred eyes
You canât keep disguised
Treachery of mankind
Too late to rewind
world wide web will find

With your inbred eyes
You canât keep satisfaction
continuing blind
Too the great good
Man could share

The educated tie you wear
Fits the leading emptiness
In Nothing to believe
A link to catastrophe

WAKE UP

You bring famine and drought
Some day you will Succumb

This malicious work
You should have known better
Acknowledge your mistakes
See the pain you transferred.
