I see the trees, calm and wise
I walk the streets, helpless thoughts
Gathered blind, mass hypnosis

I look at the sea, wide and high
I walk the streets, I see them -
Act like sheep
Scared and confused
Ready to follow and fall

I see the devil in their eyes
And he needs a sacrifice

YouÂ´ll bleed as you pleased them
Play the game or break the chains

YouÂ´re the repeater
IÂ´m the Deleter [2x]

This culture lost its true values
In search of the "perfect" life

Condemned the ancient times
Now consuming endless greed
Punished by their own (goddamn) stupidity
