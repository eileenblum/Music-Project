It has been a long journey of emotions
Infinite cold dark winters
Lying helpless on the ground
Dealing with a shattered heart
Pitch black and sombre thoughts
No hope, no common sense,
Poisoned mind a struggle with-in
That no one else can win

The emptiness isnât disappearing.
No hands to reach.
Itâs getting darker and darker,
No escape in sight.
The liquid numbness is controlling my chaos.
Afraid to face the truth.

Nothing but an empty shell
My trust is now gone with the wind
Am I the one to blame?
In this madman made game

The emptiness isnât disappearing.
No hands to reach.
Itâs getting darker and darker,
No escape in sight.
The liquid numbness is controlling my chaos.
Afraid to face the truth.

Depressed by my darkest fears
The voices wont leave
Time wonât seem to heal the wounds
In my dying soul
Pain is the only real thing
In this fucked up life
