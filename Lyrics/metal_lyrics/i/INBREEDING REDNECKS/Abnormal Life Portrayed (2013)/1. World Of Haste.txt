Brick by brick
Destroyed the walls
Despise the fake
Creature of habit

Drain me now
Of this disturbing behaviour
Canât keep me in this prison
A genesis of mental breakdown
Escaping this world of haste

Stepping inside yourself
Searching the maze of the mind
Closer now to liberation
Ultimate freedom awaits

Brick by brick
Destroyed the walls
Despise the fake
Creature of habit

Embracing a new day of revolution
With no more excuse

Burning out the living life
Letting fires lick of the lies
Of the years passed by in the end
Vanishing point of no return

Stepping inside yourself
Searching the maze of the mind
Closer now to liberation
Ultimate freedom awaits

Drain me now
Of this disturbing behaviour
Canât keep me in this prison
A genesis of mental breakdown
Escaping this world of haste
