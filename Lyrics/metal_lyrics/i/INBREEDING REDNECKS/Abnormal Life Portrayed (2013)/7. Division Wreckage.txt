Filthy promises the leaders still make
Indifferent beings touched by insanity
Rules of misery is devastating
Turning this planet into a wreckage

You think you own this piece of land
Like the spoiled vermin you are
A disgrace to mankind, I pity the fool
Your greed, your funeral

Fear the unknown
Spiritualism you despise
Ready to shed blood in the name of God
Another excuse for another abuse

Divided we stand
Suffocating minds
Desperate cry
Circle of Annihilation
You make chaos reign

Cold hearted you rape Mother Nature
Relentless you kill your own kind
Devoured by your poison
Nothing but the devils whoresâ¦. You Motherfucker!

The disease you speak; just
Another stone in the dirt
Youâre doing your job now Iâm doing mine

You lead the sheep, like vultures
Parasites hidden in water
Wearing the suit of lies
Signing papers with a wounded hand

I disagree; this is no way to be free
Taking comfort in pills, no more thrills
A dead stare, a brain that doesn't care
Slave labour and your system is obsolete
