They crawl through every crack
In search of escaping âverminâ
And leave you Disillusioned
Left now on the path of refuge

Relapse by the recoil
From ascending rulers
Setting forth their arms
Aim to conquer all in their way

Blinded; eyes scorched by the light
Of a new found misery
Brought to justice for the deeds
Of the unholy; free will

Free will!

If I ever was to find
The answer to the hate Portrayed,
I would state the obvious:
I guess that you must feel,
Stripped of all your pride and ideal!

From Bow to Crosshair
Mankind became more violent
And the dice just keeps on rolling

Relapse by the recoil
From ascending rulers
Setting forth their arms
Aim to conquer all in their way

If I ever was to find
The answer to the hate Portrayed,
I would state the obvious:
I guess that you must feel,
Stripped of all your pride and ideal!
