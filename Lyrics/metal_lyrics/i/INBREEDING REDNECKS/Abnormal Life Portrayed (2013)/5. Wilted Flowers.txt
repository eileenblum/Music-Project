Pathetic attitude (no gratitude)
Just empty words
Worthless talking
Lonely road walking

In a frame of a ghost
You will never catch
Enter the stage - of reptile
Lost common sense

Wilted flowers, hit the cities
Fists of agony, flying cheap
Drama queens, shouting out loud
Empty black, staring eyes

Sitting and wasting time
Repeating yourself

Just another victim
A life with no goals
Sitting wasting time
Repeating yourself
You have no shame
Everyone else to blame

The mountain you were built to be
Now lays in ruins
The black wings comfort you
But youâre still on your knees - on your knees

Wilted flowers, hit the cities
Fists of agony, flying cheap
Drama queens, shouting out loud
Empty black, staring eyes

Global favorite drug
Look what it have done
To our beloved ones
Alone and depressed
Living in a cage
