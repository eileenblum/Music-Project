Join me in this eternal life
Embrace me
I am god in your eyes
Follow me
Swallow me

Into eternal night
Feed of me
Drink of me
I am eternal life
I am eternal life

Look at me
Look into my blood-red eyes
Hear me
Hear my voice
Lure you twice

Feel me
Feel me
White skin that's cold as ice
Kneel for me
Kneel for me

You'll have to pay the price
You'll have to pay the price

This body is flesh and blood
Eternal youth and frozen heart
This body is flesh and blood
The elite, the elite,
24 carat blood

Join me in this eternal life
Embrace me
I am god in your eyes
Follow me
Swallow me

Into eternal night
Feed of me
Drink of me
I am eternal life
I am eternal life

Ancient the blood running through these veins
Ancient my heart survived all the flames
Thousand the nights of pleas and of lust
Thousand the years
Thousand the years

This body is flesh and blood
Eternal youth and frozen heart
This body is flesh and blood
The elite, the elite,
24 carat blood

This body is flesh and blood
This body is flesh and blood
The elite, the elite,
24 carat blood

This body is flesh and blood
Eternal youth and frozen heart
This body is flesh and blood
The elite, the elite,
24 carat blood

This body is flesh and blood
This body is flesh and blood
Eternal youth and frozen heart
