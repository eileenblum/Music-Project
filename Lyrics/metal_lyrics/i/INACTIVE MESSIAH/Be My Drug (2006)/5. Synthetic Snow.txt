You see it getting down
You feel it makes you high
You taste it, it is fine
But now you feel fucked up
Illusional lights shine
And multiply again
Delusional sounds belt
In your ears again

White walls, plastic pipes
Green masks, cyber eyes

Fleshless world now is around you
So cold aura now surrounds you
Distorted virtual objects everywhere
Synthetic snow

So much pressure
And despair all over
This weird sense
Of insanity
Alone in the void
Everything is hostile
Lancinating sights
Full of humanity

It's burning within my soul
