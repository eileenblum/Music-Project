Hear me tonight that I'm here and crying
Hear me tonight cause tonight I'm dying

Tried to find you
Like desert begging for rain
Seems you don't want to
But I still do
For I will keep wandering
And when the lights are out
Still you're everything for me
Still you are the whole world for me

If only I could see
Moon reflecting on your dark hair
In your eyes beautiful sea
I travel again my lover
Doesn't matter all the years
I'll still be living for you
The day I let my tears
Like the first time I saw you
