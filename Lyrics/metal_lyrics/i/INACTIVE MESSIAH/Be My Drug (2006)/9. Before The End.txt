This cold air in my chest
This air that makes me breathless
This cold gun in my hand
This gun that won't stand restless
I'm standing here with you
Thinking six feet upon me
I'm looking now at you
Thinking of wood around me

I can't raise my hand
To blow me away in the air
I can't pull the trigger
To bury me down with despair
I can't release the bullet
To stuck inside my cells
These thoughts are haunting my mind
Just before the end

I'm staring at my hand
Staring at the shining steel
Trying to free the lid
Release the bullet to my head
I know I won't be missed
One more unobserved absence
Your life will go on
And nothing will have changed
