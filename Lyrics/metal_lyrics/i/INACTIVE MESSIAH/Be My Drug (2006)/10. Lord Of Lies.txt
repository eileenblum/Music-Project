I shallow now your future
Into my twisted soul
Your escape is a fiction
In a theatric role

I am the lord of lies
The one you always trust
The one who never dies
And never becomes dust

I am the lord of lies
In my twisted soul
The one who never dies
In a theatric role

When I invade your palace
Your eyes will have no tears
Your words will never hunt me
I rule your silent fears

Now my duty is done
Before you set me on fire
Let my existence run within fields of desires

When fire becomes snow
And wings turn to flames
The blood drops will stain
Your masters' angels' dress
