Just appeared like rain
And fell from the sky
Dressed me with drops
And blew me like wind
Transformed my dreams to wings
Took me for a trip
Became her lover
Hidden in clouds

My words like sound
My thoughts like light
Turn your head up to the sky
Hear me tonight
Make you my lover
Make you a slave
Give you nothing more than pain

If only I could reign
Fall from the sky
Some dressing human with drops
Give you wings
Make me rain
Become fog
Just to cover you
Just hold my hand

Pain
