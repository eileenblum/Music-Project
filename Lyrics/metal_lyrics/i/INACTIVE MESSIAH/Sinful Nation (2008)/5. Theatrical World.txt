We breathe the lies
That they want us to breath
We hear the lies
That they want us to hear

We feel the truth
Rarely deep in our heart
But in this place
Ain't close to enough

Just walk away from this world
Where every one deceives you more and more
Just walk away from this world
Where every sol has been spilt on the floor
Theatrical world

We see the mannequins
That are rotten inside
We see the harlequins
That are cryin' inside

Are ready to die

Just walk away from this world
Where every one deceives you more and more
Just walk away from this world
Where every sol has been spilt on the floor
Theatrical world
