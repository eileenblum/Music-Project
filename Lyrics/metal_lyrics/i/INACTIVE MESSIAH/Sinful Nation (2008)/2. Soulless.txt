Feeling' my skin explode
As my life is crakin' into pieces
Walking' throught this empty road
Surrounded only y my muses
As the wind blows trought my hair
I'm walking alone in this empthy town
I feel thi cold air
As my eyes are looking down

Soulless I'm walking'
In this lustful life
Soulless at Hades I'm knocking'
Though still remains my pride

As the poison dries my mouth
I won't be heading south
As my heart is still in flames
Still thought my mind exclaims

Soulless I'm walking'
In this lustful life
Soulless at Hades I'm knocking'
Though still remains my pride

I mute though I can shout
I blind though can see
I deaf though I can listen
I have no soul I cannot feel

Soulless I'm walking'
In this lustful life
Soulless at Hades I'm knocking'
Though still remains my pride
