Seven thorns that turn to stars
upon devil horns
Seven thorns will rip our flesh
So to be reborn

Seven words in our head
Will exalt us all
Seven words that hit the red
Are behind this wall

Our world a big temptation
No more useless information
Our world has no discretion
Welcome to the sinful nation

Seven wounds are burning us
With the sweetest flame
Seven wounds are killing us
But we play the game

Seven wounds will take us down
The delightful fall
Seven wounds will make us drown
In this sinful world

Our world a big temptation
No more useless information
Our world has no discretion
Welcome to the sinful nation
