Walkng alone inside the crowd
My glance straight up I can see around
Eyes are scanning me from head to ground
I know you are feeling now confound

All the stars I am tonight
I am the dark I am the light
You always want to have me on sight
You wanna feel my luciferian side

Drink the liquid of my hand
Have me inside you don't stay undone
Lick my wounds the time has come
Eat my flesh and drink my blood

This place now is full of vice
As always my self will be concise
Do as I say don't have to say it twice
The time has come I'll roll the fuckin' dice

Thought you're in heaven, I brought you to hell
See you heart now is locked in my cell
Begging again for a motel
Give her an inch she'll always take an ell
