Visions and expectations
Runs through our head
Oceans of emotions
Flows till we're dead

Failure
Unavoidable failure
Failure
Irreversible failure
Failure
In the end failure
Failure
We Will die in failure

Extravagance, abjection
Yourself in insomnia
Relaxation, extratension
Fulfilled of phobia

Failure
Unavoidable failure
Failure
Irreversible failure
Failure
In the end failure
Failure
We Will die in failure

Joy and sadness
All around us
From light to darkness
We'll die alone
