Just ask yourself why
As people passing by
Just ask yourself why
Who you want to satisfy

Just ask yourself why
Does it really worth the cry?
Just ask yourself why
Why your life you deny?

Words are spinning n your head
There is nothig more ahead
You are thinking what of I've said
Like an endless lament

Ask yourself why
While looking to the sky
Just ask yourself why
Are you ready to say goodbye

Just ask yourself why
You wanna leave your blood to dry
Just ask yourself why
So after all you choose to die
