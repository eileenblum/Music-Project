Killed me many times
But here I am again
No more restless fights
Ready to take revenge

Prove what I say ain't lies
Smashing before your eyes
Your world is bleeding' inside
Your world is ready to die

Time of the chosen has become
Showdown
Your every doubt will be gone
Showdown

I will be putting the crown
Showdown
I will be talking you down
So down

Killed me many times
But here I am again
No more restless fights
Ready to take revenge

For all the sleepless night
And for the endless days
To blow those candlelights

Showdown, so down...
