For countless years
Everyone is talkin' about me
Now you'll live your fears
If you think to stand before me

Once I've told you father
Why haveyou forsaken me?
But now I see much further
There will be no fallen me
I am the chosen one
The one who has the paramount gift
I am not just someone
Now my whole soul as been drift

Fallow me
Tho the valley of pleasure and relish
Hallow me
For you shall have all that you wish

You who raise my flag
Transiting to a weird reality
I will be you drug
There will be no formality

Walk though my dark path
The way or the real promised land
There will be bloodbath
