I run like hell
Anneal and glow
I can see nothing anymore
I run like hell
Anneal and glow
The fire flickers now and glows

In this true hell
Dare not to make a sound
Fire starts to well
As flames wraps me around

For the strength of gods we pray
Again to be noble and brave
To rise with the wind
Help us on our way

There is nowhere to hide
Fire of greed burned within their minds.
Nowhere to run
Destroyed the paradise that filled their eyes

Poisoned tears fall
From a corroding sky
Upon this tortured earth
That has been left to die
