You don't belong
To who you once were
Everything has changed
By staying the same

It's not enough
That you've seen the prison walls
Footprints in the sand
Make me believe
That I exist

This is only the beginning
The world doesn't deserve anything you give. Wake up!
Before it's too late to escape becoming
Another nail in this coffin

Everything has changed
By staying the same

Step by step
I am still running
Through a labyrinth of doors I have already entered
Is this my voice?
The water it rises
Will I regret starting this nightmare

Open your eyes
You only can see
You only can see

There is no cure
There is no cure

There is no cure
'Cause you carry the virus
You try to resign yourself
Or let the rats
Pick bones from your face

This is only the beginning
The world doesn't deserve anything you give. Wake up!
Before it's too late to escape becoming
Another nail in this coffin

Open your eyes
You only can see
You only can see

Everything has changedâ¦
