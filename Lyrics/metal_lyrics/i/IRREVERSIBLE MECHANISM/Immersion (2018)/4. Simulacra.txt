Who's there?
I'm so tired,
Leave!
I cannot explain what is happening
Not even to myself
Tell me, what makes you to wake up?
Questions we could not get past

Don't leave your bed
Keep the door shut
There's nothing for you to look for
There's nothing for you to look for

There's nothing for you to look for

Tell me, what makes you to wake up?
You won't survive

There's nothing for you to look for
