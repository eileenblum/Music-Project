From scratch a million years
In the previous experience
The rising, evocation of a dream
Of an ultimate existence

Future turned reality
A crystal insight. No compromise
The world of an universal will
General will

Timeless machine of life
For those who don't dream
Aimless, without pain nor fear
Survival is a main purpose

No more silly mistakes
Blood frozen in their veins
Evolution, reached it's peak
Now begins a new golden age

We've built the life on murderers graves
It's pure (it's pure)

Temple of the light
And each is a part of a mechanism
Harmony, profound of peace

We've built the life on murderers graves
It's pure (it's pure).
