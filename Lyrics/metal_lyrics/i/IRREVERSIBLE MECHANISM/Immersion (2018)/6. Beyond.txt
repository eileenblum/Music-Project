I left
A temporary barrier behind
Into the unknown without hesitation
I inhale the air
Which was beyond

I don't regret and know what I want
Got my hands out of dirt
Dust in eyes not for those who can't lie
I was made to explore

No more borders free of all chains
An infinite journey to the truth
Wretched worms are behind
A destiny up to you

My world is too small for me
I'll never escape from this glass

I've already seen this plot
Worlds of jealousy and ambition
Roll this boulder up again and again
Prison of someone's creation

Then the universe shows it's real face
Decorations become a wall
A wall that I can never reach
And there's nowhere I can go

I left
A temporary barrier behind
Into the unknown without hesitation
I inhale the air
Which was beyond

Everything that surrounds me is mind creation

My independence is under control
Endless stairways of imagination

Feel only blackness
In this horizon of events

All I've ever been
Nothing like the links
Prospectives of a world that no longer exists

No exceptions in the universe law

Just memories in another dimension

All I've ever been
Nothing like the links
Prospectives of a world that no longer exists
No longer exists

My independence is under control

My world is so small for me,
I'll never escape from this glass
I'll never escape from this glass
