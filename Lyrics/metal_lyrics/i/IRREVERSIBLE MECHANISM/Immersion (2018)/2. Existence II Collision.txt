Stay and wait for me

Stay and wait for me
There are so many things I want to say
But haven't yet
Call from the void
Call of the instinct from the wastelands of your inner mind

We've ruined your future
There is no hope in faith
You're born free
It's time to pay your debt
And everyone will forget about his conscience
Then it's time to choose: to live or to die

But you are all already dead
But there's still a chance to rewrite fate
Show who you really are
And become a part of absolute will

Strength means nothing
Those that are weak
Men not honest with themselves
Don't be afraid of your feelings
Singularity is not a vice

There are no dreams no future no past
The price that I have to pay
For ideas, I will never believe

Stay and wait for me
There are so many things I want to say
But haven't yet
Call from the void
Call of the instinct, from the wastelands of your inner mind

You'll face your fears, you'll not see the light
Through infinite years, of your miserable life
Mental and physical sparks unite
And collision has now taken
Your right to decide

They were fading away
Only ashes and smolder
Millions of years
Millions of worlds
Millions of worlds
Millions of worlds
Millions of worlds

But you are all already dead
But there's still a chance to rewrite fate
Show who you really are
And become a part of absolute will

Strength means nothing
Those that are weak, men not honest with themselves
Don't be afraid of your feelings
Singularity is not a vice
