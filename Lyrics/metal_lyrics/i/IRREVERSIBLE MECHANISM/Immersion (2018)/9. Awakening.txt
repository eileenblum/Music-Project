It's the time to leave your mark
To pave the way to distant dreams
Reveal horizons to ideas
To look into infinity

Ready to disappear torn apart
Forget and be broken to the pieces
Awakening yourself from unreal dream
To feel your heartbeat

Fire, that guides the way
Day, divides the night
We're in search of a new sign

You hear the birth of the day
You feel dissolving

You have to deal with all of your fears
To feel your breath

Do you see how the world is changing?
You hear the birth of the day
Your mind is waiting for the questions
You feel dissolving

Awake yourself from the eternal dream
Deal with your fear
