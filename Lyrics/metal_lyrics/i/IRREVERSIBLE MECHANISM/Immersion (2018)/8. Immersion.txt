I'm begging you to leave your past
To stay away from someone's dreams
They make you think that it's your own
It's just a box that's built for you
I'm not asking to be a speck of dust
I'm asking you to stop being deaf

Become an island in the sea
It's time to throw away your mask

Immersion

In search of light
You've put the fire out
Your fears based on your lie
Lie to yourself
Lie to yourself

In search of light
You've put the fire out
Just a stone in the dark
The longer road is always safer

The creator gave you what you already had
To put chain of love on your neck
To make you play in "Life and Suffering"
Nobody wants to be a slave
But everyone wants to have a fate
But it is you, who plants a tree

How can you tell that pain is bad?
They make you believe that blood is red
You're just a reflection
You're just a reflection
Accept the truth about who you are
All you can do is to open your eyes
You, your only ally
Scramble these parts of you

The creator gave you what you already had
To put chain of love on your neck
To make you play in "Life and Suffering"
Nobody wants to be a slave
But everyone wants to have a fate
But it is you, who plants a tree

They make you think that it's your own
It's just a box that's built for you
I'm asking not to be speck of dust
I'm asking you to stop being deaf

It's time to throw away your mask

Immersion
