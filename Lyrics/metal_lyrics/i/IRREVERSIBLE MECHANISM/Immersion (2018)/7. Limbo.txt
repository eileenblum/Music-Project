So cold, so dark, so quiet
The place you've never been before
Pictures from the past
The only law

I know it looks so scary
But soon it feels like home
Don't let it get you down!
You're used to being alone

And all these dirty walls
You want razed to the ground
They are the flash you made of
The only path

So cold, so dark, so quiet
It's the shade you've always tried to hide
The last outpost of
Let it warm you up

And all these dirty walls
You want razed to the ground
They are the flash you made of
The only path
