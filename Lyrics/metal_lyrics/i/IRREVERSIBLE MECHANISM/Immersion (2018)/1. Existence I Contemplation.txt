They were fading away
Only ashes and smolder
Millions of years
Millions of worlds
Millions of worlds

Essence of life a mystery

No present reality, for a future to exist

Life is for existence
Present is for future
You can throw everything away
When you aren't sincere
When you're not ready
All that you have will be taken away

Life is for existence
Present is for future

Life is for existence
Present is for future
Present is for future
