The all-seeing eye, open the world for me,
A dimension of plains and flourishing fields
My eyes are too dry to bleed

Frozen spaces shackled with colds
Deep hidden waters are shaping the stones

The rebelling forests do not let us see,
They've hidden the cloudy skies
Behind seven seals

We were unjust, we don't deserve mercy
We've killed the nature,
Abused all of our forces
We're the taint of destruction,
We purify all that we see
Infinite and empty fields

We've killed the nature,
Abused all of our forces
We're the taint of destruction,
We purify all that we see
Infinite empty fields

The shackles
We've broken and fit brought us doom,
Are now buried deep
And constricted by roots

The all-seeing eye, opens the world

So what happens now?
Have we won, or we've lost?
We've stopped the extinction,
But what was the cost?

Whether all we've created can be dispelled

The new era's coming, the future will tell
Whether all we've created can be dispelled
