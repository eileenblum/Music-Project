And again I'm coming back in my mind
To the day when I have first opened my eyes
Cold is burrowing under my skin,
Fear is crippling me

I've seen the ruins of fortresses,
The ashes of manuscripts
I've heard the cracking sounds from the walls
Buildings collapsed,
All that's left are the wastelands and dust

I'm the betrayer of time
In my heart there's only ashes and emptiness
I'm the betrayer of time
And I'm the only survivor that's left

Now the whole world is in my hands
And I'm going to show it the bitter end

All that I cherished faded away
I have nothing left

I'm the betrayer of time
In my heart there's only ashes and emptiness
I'm the betrayer of time
And I'm the only survivor that's left

I'm the betrayer of time
I'm the betrayer of time
