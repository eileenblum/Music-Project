This tiny tree that is to grow up
It was the seed and it will smolder
Time breaks everything down,
And death touches everything
And riders of death are always on guard

Destroying everything and showing no mercy,
They create new law
The signs that come along with the thunderstorm slow time

Stopping the time and catching the moment
We're afraid to walk into the abyss of unknown
We're afraid to decide
We're not ready for what is to come but still is not shown

Fear fades away, myriads of pictures go by
Pain goes away and the fire dies out
The riders are here
And they know what needs to be done

Destroying everything and showing no mercy,
They create the new law
The signs that come along with the thunderstorm slow time
