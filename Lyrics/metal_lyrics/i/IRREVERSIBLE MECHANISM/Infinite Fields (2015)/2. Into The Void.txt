Crushing tectonic structures
We are on a road with no return
Witness the hatred volcano eruptions
The flames are heating the air and we burn

The core that we long to reach
Has made our lifespans limited
This is a one-way road,
Into the void of infinity

The core that we long to reach
Will leave a burning mark
This is a one-way road,
Into the void of eternal dark

The last parade of death
With horsemen in command
Breaking ancient boulders to pieces
The lost world has kneeled
And prays for an end
Spilling red lava all over our treaties
Turning to stone every being
That helped the curse extend

The core that we long to reach
Has made our lifespans limited
This is a one-way road,
Into the void of infinity

The core that we long to reach
Will leave a burning mark
This is a one-way road,
Into the void of eternal dark
