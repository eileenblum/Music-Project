It's about time for the last eerie circle to close
It's the reckoning day with no truth to expose

Humanity's legacy soon will be lost,
We'll turn another page to dust
The things that were done we couldn't prevent,
Look what their free will has done to us

The hurricane will crush all of your dreams
The outburst will make even people's hopes perish
The rocks with no souls keeping history streams
A tombstone over the earth
The last thing that's been left to cherish

True face of destruction,
Eternal death

The rocks with no souls keeping history streams
A tombstone over the earth
The last thing that's been left to cherish
