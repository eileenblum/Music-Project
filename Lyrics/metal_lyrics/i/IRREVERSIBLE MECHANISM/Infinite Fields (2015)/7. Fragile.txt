A fragile creation
You are a start of an idea
You are the end of someone's rule,
The end of someone's rule

You are the new discovered virus.
Make us stronger
We don't need your poisoned guidance,
Maker save your breath
Dot the i's, you are the token of new order
A newly started life or yet another death

The deserts once a blazing fire
Now have a colder border
The rivers that were giving life
Are gonna take it back

Cold ocean is so close,
It's washing the dead shores
The eternal stones
We're our own death row

You are the new discovered virus,
Make us stronger
We don't need your poisoned guidance,
Maker save your breath
Dot the i's, you are the token of new order
A newly started life or yet another death

A fragile being has shattered the balance
It's a new start that
Will bring a new end
Alive masterpieces burn down their creators
The worlds are the castles
That were made of sand
