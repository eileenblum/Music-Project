The cold breath of winds will touch the white plains
And blow the fresh snow off the trees in deep slumber
The eternal blizzard remembers your vital remains
Remaining a glacier

The forest surrounding is in fact a closed gate
The road back is hidden in snow and it's going to fade

The endless silence
The sound of thunder breaks it and shows its might
Frozen sky shining
The light is fading, face the eternal night

The forest surrounding is in fact a closed gate
The road back is hidden in snow and it's going to fade

We are buried in snowstorm, we are deadly encumbered
The cold breath of winds will touch the white plains
And blow the fresh snow off the trees in deep slumber
