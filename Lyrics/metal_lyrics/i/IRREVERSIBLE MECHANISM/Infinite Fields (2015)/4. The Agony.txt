The eyes are slowly closing, miraculous world fades,
The artist cleans the brushes, takes away the paints,
The picture's finished yet it's only shades
The earth's devoid of life and engulfed in flames

The agony bursts in memories of hollow songs and empty prayers
The evil eyes and filthy tongues are more than just nightmares

The agony bursts
In memories of past battles,
Victories and defeats

You run corner to corner longing for an end
Your agony's your power outlet,
Your end is the beginning,
Still you should make amends

The power you've possessed is gone
Your agony's your power outlet,
Your end is the beginning, still you should make amends

The old and the young,
Alive and the dead
Are now taking part in the feast
