There have always been people
Parasites to society
Feeding on the pain and misery
Of innocent human prey

I grew up in a small town
Dreaming of what I could be
Blind for your own destructive tendencies
Innocently passed them on to me

It starts with the child that's restless
An endless chain of abuse
My fantasy of domination
Created the ultimate form of control

Predilection to be a killer
Violence for pleasure
Attacking unsuspecting victims
Powerless to defend themselves
No empathy for anyone

My mind is contaminated
You're my first project
Intimidated by your presence
I want you to be dead

I heard you scream and watch you die
Completely enraptured by my mind
A student by day, a killer by night
A psychopath is created

The random murders continued
My patter is hard to break
Morbid curiosity
A serial killer was made

It starts with the child that's restless
An endless chain of abuse
My fantasy of domination
Created the ultimate form of control

I heard you scream and watched you die
Completely enraptured by my mind
A student by day, a killer by night
A psychopath is created
