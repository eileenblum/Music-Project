Welcome to my secret society
Formed out of trustworthy men
Serve the task of my organisation
Execute my missions

For the purpose of my ideals
The institution was created
Fight with all means against all our enemies
Instigator of criminal acts
Let the showdown begin

Before God, on my honor and my life
I will execute all missions and commands without question
I swear before God, on my honor and my life
I will take all the secrets
Of this society into the grave with me

Nothing has been done so far
To reach my goals

For the greater good
We will recruit and train our army
Devoured by one purpose
One thought, one passion

Not merely by word but by deed
Obey my laws, follow my rules
Live by my standards, walk without fear
I am your master, I am your God

Before God, on my honor and my life
I will execute all missions and commands without question
I swear before God, on my honor and my life
I will take all secrets
Of this society into the grave with me

Leave your skin and blood
For the love of my dynasty
Honored you will be
The stories of your bravery
Will be engraved upon your tombstone
