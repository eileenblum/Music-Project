Immoral behavior
Don't bring disgrace to my name
Sexual indiscretions
It will all end the same

Dishonor my family
I decide your fate
Dishonor my family
All your brothers filled with hate

Maintaining values
Victory or death
Purified by blood
Victory or death

Burned with acid by a relative
Can't recover from the scars
Subject to retaliation
Died by own flesh and blood

In the name of my family
I decide your fate
A victim of honor
All your brothers filled with hate

Property and honor
Are so deeply entrenched
I'm a servant to the family
I did it for my honor and prestige

Maintaining values
Victory or death
Purified by blood
Victory or death

In the name of my family
I decide your fate
A victim of honor
All your brothers filled with hate
