A great plague swept over Europe
In 2023
Unleashing a rampage of death
Unprecedented in history

It seemed to strike through breath and sight
Yersinia pestis
Innumerable people died
Population zero

Terror was struck into the hearts
Brother abandoned brother
No defense and understanding
A baby died next to his mother
Terror struck into the hearts
Caused by this great epidemic of death

Primary culprits in transmitting
Fleas on the back of rats and mice
Mankind survived the ordeal
But will we survive it twice

It seemed to strike through breath and sight
Yersinia pestis
Innumerable people died
Population zero

Sickened by pain
Vomiting of blood
No means of healing
The deadliest disease

Welcome to the Earth
It's the year 2825
Welcome to the Earth
Population: zero
