The first time I saw you I've had these feelings deep inside
I knew you were the one when you looked at me and smiled
All I ever wanted was to be part of your heart
For us to be together, to never be apart

I am bleeding and screaming
You are feeding my pain
Can anyone stop me from going insane?

My eyes shouldn't see what they long to see
My lips shouldn't taste what they long to taste
My ears shouldn't hear what they long to hear

I lie awake in the black of the night
Waiting for you to hate me and fight
All I can do is lie down and cry
What does it take to finally die?

Here you are lying dead on the floor
I smile because your heart beats no more
You'll never come back and mess up my life
[...] with your blood on my knife
