Manmade emotions created in my head
Crafted with great skills
Hailed are my ingenious thoughts

Cognitive behaviors
Determine the good and bad
Expectation based on actions
Conflicting thoughts that make me mad

Will you cross my line

Interpret reality
Destructive boundaries affect my soul
Enclosed expressions
Hidden behind my guarded wall

Construct a wall
Make it high
Build it tall
Or you will die

Cross the border

Welcome to my death strip
Accusations driving me insane
Reconstruction of emotions
Reversal of conditions

Defense: the best attack
Retreat: the only solution
Center of depression
Anger and aggression

Construct a wall
Build it tall

Now it's time to turn the tide
Instructed by the voices
There's no need to run and hide
Obey the black box of my mind

Construct a wall
Build it tall
