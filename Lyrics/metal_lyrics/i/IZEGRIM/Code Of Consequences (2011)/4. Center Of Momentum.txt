The project from conception to completion
Magnetic separation of the isotopes
The formulas were created
By the greatest minds of our time

Despite the declaration of peaceful use
Magnificent knowledge will be abused

It is the balance and arrangement
That determine stability
A sphere of uranium
A new weapon of mass destruction

Detonation of explosives

A shock wave compressed the core
The fission of the elements began
Critical mass has been achieved

An enormous amount of energy
Relative to the material involved
Temperatures like the sun
And lethal radiation

The fireball shooting upwards
A light in the still dark sky
Creating the mushroom cloud
Thousands of people will die

Killed by the blast
A wave of intense heat
Killed by radiation
Your time of defeat

It is the balance and arrangement
That determine stability
A sphere of uranium
The darkest day in history
