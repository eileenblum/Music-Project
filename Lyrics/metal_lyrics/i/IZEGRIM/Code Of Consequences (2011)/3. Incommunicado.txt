Individual self interest
The supreme goal of my life
Not ashamed of being selfish
Pleasure: my aim of living

My joy, your sorrow
The pain that makes me follow
Your sadness and grief
Hold on to your false belief

Our blood is thicker than water

Isolated from my fellow-beings
Separated form the human race
Incommunicado
I can't stand the look on your face

Isolated from my fellow-beings
Separated from the human race
Incommunicado
I can't stand the look on your face

Accept my social disorder
My phobia for evolution
Guidelines for my mental state
Evil has just incarnate

My basement, concealed
Place where inferno is revealed
Dark, perversive and degraded
See the light your God created

Isolated from my fellow-beings
Separated from the human race
Incommunicado
I can't stand the look on your face

Isolated from my fellow-beings
Separated from the human race
Incommunicado
I can't stand the look on your face

Our blood is thicker than water
