I'm on a mission taking over control
Driven by my hatred for you
You're a perfect mind in a healthy body
To be destroyed I will hurt you too
Hear the pounding in your head
No evidence of physical damage could show
You're in the process of creating
What deserves to be called insanity
Have you ever had the feeling
That you're going slightly mad
Try to catch what's dropping
Checking the pattern in your head
This is intensely scrutinized
The facts completely invisible
One of the insidious benefits
Of this kind of torture
You're losing control
I can never be considered a creator
But that temptation still exists in me
Don't wanna be hated for dealing with that loathsome man
You've become what I asked you never to be
Have you ever had the feeling
That you're going slightly mad
Try to catch what's dropping
Checking the pattern in your head
I want you to let the hatred wash over you
Becoming crazy, are you aware of it

I watch as you fade into obscurity
