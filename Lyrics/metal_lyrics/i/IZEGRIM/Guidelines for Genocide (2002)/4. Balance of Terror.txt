Living on a planet where instability rulesNations now are governed by selfindulgent foolsBickering eachother, pretenders to the throneThe outcome of this battle is as yet unknown Until now they have been using howitsers and gunsEnforcing the opression like a bunch barbaric HunsThey see that they are fighting a war they cannot winA new era has dawned: Armageddon will begin Celebrate the end of our precious lives,Insanity prevailsHear the missiles fly,whistling sweet like a nightingale We count the countless blessings of our megalomanic stateThe tension is increasing at geometric rate"Nuke em to the stoneage" says the president on the phoneIntiate the sequence that will ruin our precious homes! In both of the White Houses the panic's setting inA fatal rain of warheads will wash away our sinsIt don't make no difference, we are all about to dieNo need to hide away because we don't have S.D.I. Celebrate the end of our precious lives,Insanity prevailsHear the missiles fly,Whistling sweet like a nightingale A thousand homing missiles flying through the airPeople start to panic and to pillage in despairAwait the final impact, pray for a painless deathShoulders back, stomach in, inhale the nuclear breath I wish that I could say that I'm sorry...
