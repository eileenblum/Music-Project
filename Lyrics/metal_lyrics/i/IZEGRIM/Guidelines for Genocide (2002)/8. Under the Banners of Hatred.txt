Under the banners of hatred
So pityful our lives
We're starting a war we're not gonna win
Will we live or die?

A bag of dough or national pride
Maybe a piece of land
Ensue to it's final purpose:
Obliteration on demand

Go to your duties your pathetic life has no value

Pain - The outcome is irrelevant
Death - A fact you can't deny

Pile up the coffins
The bells will toll
Now you will dance
Deaths rock &amp; roll

They're bombing our cities to ruin
Who the fuck do they think that they are
Waging a war we can't possibly win
We all surely die!

Heroes in combat they seem to fall like drops of rain

Pain - The outcome is irrelevant
Death - A fact you can't deny

Pile up the coffins
The bells will toll
Now you will dance
Deaths rock &amp; roll
