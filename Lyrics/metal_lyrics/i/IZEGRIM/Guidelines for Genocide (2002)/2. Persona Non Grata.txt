Once a while I have huge aggrevations,enormous outbursts of rageI get depressed of my neurosisand inner wars that I must wage Torn in a conflict I don't comprehend,My life is like a pile of manureI am aware a lot of things need to changebut for good or bad I am not sure You hurt me more than I could possibly endureThis time my rage will not subsideI have decided to get rid of all your shitRepaying every tear I cried I finally claimed a life of my ownand I am glad that I finally seeYou're wasting your life, too lazy to work,all the time you've been leeching on meYou've taken my dough, you've beaten me up,got me afraid that I would be ditchedThe love I have given has never returned,You made me a paranoid bitch Now I will deal with all the pain you've given meThe hidden lies in every sentenceI feel the anger like it is boiling in my bloodI have no time for your repentanceA nasty habit with which I'll have to copeAnd when I do it I'll do it wellI take a shovel and club you till you're deadI hope that you may rot in Hell Persona Non Grata Once a while I had huge aggrevations,enormous outbursts of rageI got depressed of my neurosisand inner wars that I must wageDriven by obsession I'm getting rid of you,you've driven me far beyond the edgeYour insults and transgressions won't hurt me anymore,to this I surely dare to pledge You hurt me more than I could possibly endureThis time my rage will not subsideI have decided to get rid of all your shitRepaying every tear I cried I finally claimed a life of my ownand I am glad that I'm finally freeI'm wasting your life, ten stabs in your back,for all the times you've been fucking with meYou've taken my dough, you've beaten me up,had me afraid that I would be ditchedThe pain you have given has now been returned,With Love, from your paranoid bitch Persona Non Grata
