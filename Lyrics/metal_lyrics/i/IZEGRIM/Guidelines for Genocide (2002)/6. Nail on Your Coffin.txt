Rage! Gathered sisters, hear my call!United we stand, divided we'll fallRedemption has never been so nearfor who bear the mark of Venus Sewing-machines and pans will meltinto weaponry and chastity-beltsMan will face his darkest fears: desecrate the Holy Penis! Why, why, why... tell me whyDry, dry, dry... you bled us dry It's time for female terror,Amazonian onslaughtIn mind Lorrena Bobbit,There's a lesson to be taught Your obstrusiveness and obsession with lust,your blindfolded thoughts that make me disgustconceive my duty of giving birth,my only right to work the dresserYour system of roles surely burns to the groundand evidently it turns the other way aroundSo keep in mind:who wears the skirt stands above the things you treasure Lies, lies, lies... no more liesCry, cry, cry... prepare to die It's time for female terror,Amazonian onslaughtIn mind Lorrena Bobbit,There's a lesson to be taught
