I'm schizophrenic, I am not sane
I cannot help it, the voices are to blame
You have no clue of what they do to me, and there is no therapy
To make the bastards go away

Will you share my pain?

Damn - this vortex of voices in my head
Stuck with all these dreadful cries
Hate - so rampant it sets my soul aflame
Fragile angel of demise

Angel of Demise
Unwilling to suffer 'til the embittered end
Angel of Demise
All I ever wanted is silence inside my head
Angel of Demise
No-one understands my neverending agony
Angel of Demise
I can never cope unless the voices are away

I was born to die

The voices brought me misery, now they all will die with me
A loaded rifle to take me high
I will show I will not give in, put the barrel to my chin
Now give me wings so I can fly
I am an angel, I am an angel of demise

I was schizophrenic, I wasn't sane
I couldn't help it, the voices were to blame

Will you share my pain?

Damn - this vortex of voices in my head
Redeem me of all these dreadful cries
Hate - so rampant it set my soul aflame
Fragile angel of demise

Angel of Demise
Unwilling to suffer 'til the embittered end
Angel of Demise
All I ever wanted is silence inside my head
Angel of Demise
No-one understands my neverending agony
Angel of Demise
I can never cope unless the voices are away
