Not before in mans existence did all mankind uniteTo rid the world from anguishand put quarrels aside for peace Warmonger He is the one who defies the world,Laughing last, lauging bestAchieved what none achieved before:Put man to stressUnited we stand, divided we fall,In the name of Allah we will dieJihad is callingOnwards to war Nations united, for a few thousand livesHe should be rewardedwith the Nobel Prize for peace Warmonger All the world against one man,Mohammeds prophet of peaceAdvanced guns and rocketry,The manhunt will increaseUnited we stand, divided we fall,In the name of Allah he will dieHelter Skelter approachingOnwards to war
