Species Mankind: an error of natureA bunch of fools and insaneWe ruin and breakfor which we all are conditionally trained If there's a God, I beg you dearly:Let mankind be brought to doom! The only creatures who fuck without the purpose to breedWe're nothing more but bags of shit who murder for our creedThe only creatures who kill without reason to killWe remain barbarians and we proudly always will! A global movement, dedicated to erradicate ideologyHate everyone as you hate yourselvesThou Shalt Disrespect! The only creatures who fuck without the purpose to breedWe're nothing more but bags of shit who murder for our creedThe only creatures who kill without reason to killWe remain barbarians and we proudly always will! Stupidity is bliss, and censor all that makes sensesince no-one can hurt you once you're drown in ignorance Species Mankind: an error of natureA bunch of fools and insaneWe ruin and breakfor which we all are eternally maimed.
