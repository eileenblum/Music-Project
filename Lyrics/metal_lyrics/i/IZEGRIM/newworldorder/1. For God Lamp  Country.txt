For God and Country many decades they have fought
Our modern civilization thatÂ´s against their laws of God

We are the non-believers, we are mankinds biggest threat
They're sure God is on their side,
and His laws demand our death

Their jacket stuffed with dynamite
Many people will die tonight
They say their prayers, then ignite
Another crowd is blown to bits

They spill the blood of the ignorant
Disappear in bloody stains
Indoctrinated to kill and fight
and die in Allahs name

For God and Country

Now they bring terror in our streets
But they can never kill us all
Defy their dogmaÂ´s for a thousand years to come
Maybe we will tumble..., but we will never fall

I tell you to be ready, coz if you can read the signs
A holy war at our homes is just a matter of time

We are non-believers, we are mankinds biggest threat
They're sure God is on their side,
and that His law demands our death

Their jacket stuffed with dynamite
Many people will die tonight
They say their prayers, then ignite
Another crowd is blown to bits

They'll never stop to sacrifice
'coz it only makes them proud
To end their lives in martyrdom
To die for a sacred cause

For God and Country
