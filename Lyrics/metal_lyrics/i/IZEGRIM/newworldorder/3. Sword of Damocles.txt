With audacity and courage - It controls the seven seas
Lurking 'neath the surface - The menace of the deep
Renowned its deadly arsenal - Last hope for those at home
Built on stealth technology - below fiery waves it roams

In sixty years of Cold War these things never engaged
Now terrible means to a policy of perishers gone astray

Dispatch the warmachines
Quintessential submarines
Missiles ready at command
The rain of doom is now at hand

Now they will feel the wrath
The sword of Damocles will fall
Now they will feel the wrath
For all

The sharks are in position, Prepared to remove the threat
There's no sign of the enemy, The coordinates are set
Clear the field of fire and the angle of projection
Once the target has been locked, fire at discretion

The ICBMs have been unleashed - Its victims we won't see
Yet the size of its destruction - Unequalled in history
The Middle East is burning - A furnace of fire and dust
By millions they are dying - But rather them than us

Now they will feel the wrath
The sword of Damocles will fall
Now they will feel the wrath
For all

Never in all these centuries was a battle so unfair
They never saw it coming, for them we weren't there
Our tubes of mass destruction
Launched from many miles offshore
A strategy of cowardness, No heroism left in war
