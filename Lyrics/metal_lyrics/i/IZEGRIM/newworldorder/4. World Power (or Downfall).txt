These religious criminals are getting on my nerves
Now what's their fucking problem;
They'll get what they deserve
Let's deal with all these parasites, right away
Right here right now, so get out of my way

I want to push the button
Today I'm whacking flies
From the rubble and the chaos
To the occasion I will rise

World Power or Downfall

Yet all is said and done and still neither side has won
Now we're back where we begun - Unachieved a single goal
Through all the suffering and pain, everything remains the same
All our brave men died in vein - God rest their souls

Give me world power, or no power for all
United we stand, divided we fall

No longer can I stick my head into the sand
If you are not with me, then you must be against
They all been warned not to fuck with us
But yet they screwed us once too much

Someone of my magnitude cannot maintain pacifist views
Let's finish off the Muslims, then taking on the Jews
I play the game my way since the Soviets are through
So violate my interests and I will gladly nuke you too

I want to push the button
Today I'm whacking flies
From the rubble and the chaos
A new order will arise

World Power or Downfall
