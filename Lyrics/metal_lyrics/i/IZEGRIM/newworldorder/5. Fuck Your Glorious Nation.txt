'FUCK YOU' is all that I think of
We lost the grip on our lives
We voted for you, you sent us into
a war we didn't want to fight

Save me your populist promises
Sold our sons to the mighty USA
and made of my glorious fatherland
a puppet nation in decay

While at home many houses burn
Hard lessons our boys will learn:
You cannot beat invisible enemies
And so as dusty corpses they return

Fuck your conspiracy
Fuck your democracy
and your glorious nation too

Proud of the medals you gathered
In the course of world war three
Still honoured by ignorant masses
But you don't mean shit to me

Too many morons have bought your shit
And yet so few have tried to resist
Now intelligence and facts revealed
The axis of evil does not exist

A modern society, brought down to its knees
In our hours of hardship, the biggest foe for peace,
Is you... I know it's true
In times of misery, our history is made
In our hours of darkness, we were all betrayed,
By you...  And you know it too!

Fucker!

Away with your hollow rhetoric
Too long we have been too naive
We relied on you, you sent us into
A dream we no longer believe

Ensuing years of incompetence
Backed by a firm belief in God
When we finally gain our 'victory'
Our native soil will be drenched in blood
