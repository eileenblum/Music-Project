I will hunt you

Look in the mirror
The picture is clear
I feel no peace
But hate and fear

I see things that aren't there
And I don't see things
That are there

The only way that I see
Is through a glass darkly

I will hunt you

This is the limit of my ability
To define endless despair

My soul is caught
Diseased mentality
Wrong vision of reality

The only way that I see
Is through a glass darkly

I hate the way we
Were so close
The way I liked you the most
I hate the way you look at me
You are the other side of me

I will hunt you
