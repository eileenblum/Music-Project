My thoughts are endless
Everything is real and
Imagination grows
You will shatter into pieces
I don't think it will ever heal

My body's shaking
Filled with rage and doubt
Looking for ways
To let it all out
This hate in my heart
If you're not strong
You have to be smart

Insanity is freedom
In a world bond of chains
Who makes you suffer
Just give me their names

I'm gonna find them
This is a game
A matter of death
And there might
Be no tomorrow
This is their last breath

They beg on their knees
Look up at the sun
Yes I will kill them
One by one

Insanity is freedom
In a world bond of chains
Who makes you suffer
Just give me their names

My thoughts are endless
Everything is real and
Imagination grows
You have been
Shattered into pieces
You will never heal

My body is shaking
Filled with rage and doubt
I've found a way out
Let it all out
This hate in my heart
If you're not strong
You have to be smart
