I'm at war
With the voices in my head
You don't suspect a thing
They want you dead

Every night I see you
When you think
You're all alone
The voices taking over
When I make myself at home

You are my enemy
The poison in my veins
Unleash the mighty force
Break the chains

Can you hear the voices?
Can you hear the screams?
I hear them clearly
I'm not insane

Every night I see you
When you think
You're all alone
The voices taking over
When I make myself at home

You are my enemy
The poison in my veins
Unleash the mighty force
Break the chains

Can you hear the voices?
Can you hear the screams?
I hear them clearly
I'm not insane

Pulling the trigger
O my god what have I done
The voices laughing
You're now officially gone

Don't even know you
When did all this begin
It's called random
It's the evil within
