I wear a mask
It hides my strife
I wear a mask
To escape from life hides my strife

But when you say
All this out loud
It's just you against the submissive crowd

Everything you think to see it's just a mask it isn't me
I wear a mask to not get caught because I have a different thought

You want someone to erase you fears
The person who will wipe your tears

Well that person isn't me
Not the one I want to be
Have to wear my mask again
You won't see my identity

I wear a mask
It hides my strife
I wear a mask
To escape from life hides my strife

But now it's time that you will see
The real face that belongs to me
Killing for pleasure is what I do

Everything you think to see it's just a mask it isn't me
I wear a mask to not get caught because I have a different thought

Everything you think to see it's just a mask it isn't me
No one will ever know, you won't see my identity

Reclaim my identity
