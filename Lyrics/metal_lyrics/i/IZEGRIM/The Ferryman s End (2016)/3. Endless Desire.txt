Fury
Pain
Desire
Flawless victory

Every time I go outside
Got this desire in my heart
Something I can't control
An error in my soul

If you don't fit
In the normal type
You have to run
You have to hide
Can't be myself so
I play this game
This perfect world
I have to blame

Endless desire
Endless desire to kill
I've got this
Endless desire to kill

We all have our
Cross to bear
Fury pain and sorrow
This burden I have to bear
It might explode tomorrow

Endless desire
Endless desire to kill
I've got this endless
Desire to kill

Now they've seen my face
They want to break my wall
It's the pleasure of the chase
Why I will never fail
