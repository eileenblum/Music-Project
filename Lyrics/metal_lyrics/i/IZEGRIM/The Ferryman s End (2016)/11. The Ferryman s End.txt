Conveyed to the other side
By the boat of Charon
The one who carries
The souls

You thought you've
Seen it all
My goal in life is still
Not done
I have a big surprise for you
The best is yet to come

Die ferryman die
I killed the ferryman

The ferryman
Holds his pole right
And his left hand to me
I stab my dagger in his heart
There's blood as far
As I can see

This is the price
You have to pay
Finally I don't
Have to pretend
You are lost forever
This is the ferryman's end

Die ferryman die
I killed the ferryman

The ferryman is dead
He no longer
Rules the coast
This is the end
Of passing through
I killed the one
You need the most

The souls of the deceased
Cannot cross the river
They will never find
Eternal peace
And wander
Around forever
