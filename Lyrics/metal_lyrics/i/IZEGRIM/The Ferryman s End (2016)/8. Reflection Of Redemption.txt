There is nothing I could say
Nothing I could do
To let you know
Just how much
I'm in love with you

The times we spend together
So pleasant and free
Think of you when I'm alone
I think of you and me

My paradox gun
Always on my mind
I feel so redeemed by you
You're just one of a kind

You give me everything
The passion you've
Unleashed before
Never let me down
I want you more and more

My paradox gun
Always on my mind
I feel so redeemed by you
You're just one of a kind

When I hold you in my hand
My lust grows and grows
I pull your trigger
Now my love
Bullets released as planned
Fire!

I use you I need you
Never ask me why
An instrument of attack
Born to make life die

The times we spend together
So pleasant and free
Think of you when I'm alone
I think of you and me

Redemption
