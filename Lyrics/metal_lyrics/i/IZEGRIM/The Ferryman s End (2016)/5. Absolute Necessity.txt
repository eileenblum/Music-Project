I feel invincible
Never afraid
Just an illusion
I choose to create

My head is empty
My body just a shell
An endless fight
Welcome to hell

No matter which path
Every road leads
To your door
The harder I try to quit
I want you more and more

I feel invincible
Never afraid
Just an illusion
I choose to create

My head is empty
My body just a shell
An endless fight
Welcome to hell

You took me up
And made me see
The other side of reality

Love of my life why have you forsaken me
Your flame must die
Absolute necessity

I made myself a promise
You would never see me cry
If you ever make me
You will have to die

I've lost my family
My friends are few
It controls my life
I'm addicted to you

Love of my life why have you forsaken me
Your flame must die
Absolute necessity

I made myself a promise
You would never see me cry
If you ever make me
You will have to die
