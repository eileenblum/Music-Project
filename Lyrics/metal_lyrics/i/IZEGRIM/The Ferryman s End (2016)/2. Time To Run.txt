My eyes are empty
Just a black hole
Bear no reflection
Of a soul

Passage of time
Won't heal your wound
Your loss is great
So you are doomed

You cannot kill
What's already dead
A twisted soul
An empty head

I have to go and load my gun
I go outside it's time to run

This bloody hell
I am living in
Anger keeps crawling
Underneath
My pale skin

I died inside so long before
I am rotten to the core
I go outside it's time to run
Pulling the trigger to fire my gun

First a young mother
See the fear in her face
Sorry my dear
Wrong time wrong place

Innocent people having fun in the mall
Their happy faces are just pictures on the wall
You cannot kill what's already dead
A twisted soul an empty head

I died inside so long before
I am rotten the core
I have to go and load my gun
I go outside it's time to run
