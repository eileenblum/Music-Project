They want to break me down
But I won't fall
I die like an angel
But return as the devil

Here I am
Awaiting execution
Sentenced to death
I'm in isolation

My time is up
My life is done
White walls of death
The countdown has begun

[2x]
White walls
White walls
White walls of death

Everyone hates me
So I reached my goal
Laughing out loud
I'm still in control

My time is up
My life is done
White walls of death
The countdown has begun

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

[2x]
White walls
White walls
White walls of death

My wonderful life
The end is near
I never fail
I will leave them in fear

As the poison enters my vein
I feel my body tremble in pain

I murdered the world
I have no regret
Last thing I see are (sic) the white walls of death

[2x]
White walls
White walls
White walls of death
