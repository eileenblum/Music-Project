Loud screams come
Out of sorrow
I hope and pray
For a better tomorrow

Not a day goes by
That I can't feel the pain
The times are tough
And they sure get worse

My faith is broken
My heart bleeding dry
Lost every reason
The question is why

Losing faith day by day
It feels like everything
Is fading away

Catch me I fall
I will drown in decay
All hope is gone
My soul breaks away

Ocean full of tears
Don't want to leave
Lost in my tranquility
As my soul tries to breathe

My faith is broken
My heart bleeding dry
Lost every reason
The question is why

Losing faith day by day
It feels like everything
Is fading away

If you are real
Then show me your face
Lost every reason
To believe in your grace

All hope is gone
My soul breaks away
Catch me I fall
I will drown in decay

My faith is broken
My heart bleeding dry
Lost every reason
The question is why
