I used to love my country - A low land near the sea
Friendly and civilized - So orderly and free
Loved for its tolerance - Once a model state
Now a delusion - It's all altering these days

Feel the discontent - See the decay
Challenge the "progress", defy all the things it changed
Clear your mind - Hear what I say
Don't let us degenerate, into a nation of deranged

I long for my homeland - How nice it used to be
Now I curse this shitty country - We are no longer free
It's a panopticon - Where many men and women
Are afraid of being killed - For exercising their own opinion

Hear the deafening sound of silent marches
Against senseless violence in our streets
Do you really think this is a remedy
How sensible can violence be?

The land I speak of is run by fools
Trades are no longer taught at secular schools
The land I speak of has nothing left to prove
To demoralized elderly and wasted youth

We lost our identity - We stand alone
And though I fucking hate it
There is no place like home

No place like home

Concerned and sentimental - Perhaps I'm too naive
But this shitty country is still a part of me
Like sheep in a slaughterhouse - A scenario of doom
Our altruism must be stopped or we'll drown in eternal gloom

Feel the discontent - See the decay
Challenge the "progress", defy all the things it changed
Clear your mind - Hear what I say
Don't let us degenerate, into a nation of deranged

The vicious beast of globalization
Caught us and dragged us to its lair
No one makes an effort to escape its grip
Trapped in the claws of despair

The land I speak of has a lot to loose
We're lead to the gallows - They put our heads into the noose
The land I speak of - Agenda's unfurl
We are misguided by our wretched world

We lost our sanity - I feel alone
And though I fucking hate it
There is no place like home

No place like fucking home
