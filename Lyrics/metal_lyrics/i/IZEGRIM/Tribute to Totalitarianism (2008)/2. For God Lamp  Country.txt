How long have we been around, I guess 150 K or so
Homo sapiens arose with the ability to learn and grow
Man won't survive that long again, that much is certain
At the zenith of our progress we have now to bear it's burden

All adhere the Order of the Fuhrer of the Free
Spark the powder keg - In the name of democracy
All obey the Order of the Fuhrer of the Free
Spark the powder keg - igniting World War Three

Increasing unemployment and a stagnant economy
Eliminate our welfare and our freedom of speech
Many things have changed unlike anything before
The media are partisan, the system corrupt to the core

"Qui desiderat pacem, preaperet bellum"
Who wishes peace, prepare for war instead
Mankind is heading back to the abyss
Because peace is not is what you'll get

You are being called upon
Submit your daughters and sons
Stand to Red, White and Blue
In the name of freedom

All adhere the Order of the Fuhrer of the Free
Spark the powder keg - Resolved we must be
All obey the Order of the Fuhrer of the Free
Spark the powder keg - But don't do it for me

How long have we been around, I guess a hundred K or so
Homo sapiens arose to fuck up and be overthrown
When the ordeal is over, we'll be back where we begun
But we all owe it to ourselves; the worst is yet to come

We'll be undone.
