Supposedly there's a hell on earth
In some country far away
But I cannot relate to this
It's not happening to me

They show the losers on the news at night
Hopes for peace have long been lost
A booby trap, a dozen dead
It leaves me untouched

They preach the beginning - of the end of times
As described in Revelation
That we'll stand trial - for all our crimes
And face a time of tribulation

I don't know and I don't care
Blame my xenophobic ways
Not one of them and I'm not there
It does not affect me anyway

I'm glad to know - Still safe at home
But they are getting on my nerves
Suicidal lunatics - fueled by fanatics
Let's give them what they deserve
Hell On Earth

They oppose and reject our civilized values
and don't want our democracy installed
It's blasphemy in the Church of Mankind
For this we'll fight them 'till they fall

They are only Arabs
Just let them rot in hell
Since we need their treasures
Our boys are fighting well
It is no coincidence
That we are living "free"
It never was a luxury
And it will never be

Apparently there's a hell on earth
In some country far away
But I don't give a shit for this
It's the price they have to pay

They show the culprits on the news at night
Sanity has long been lost
Another car bomb, a dozen dead
Still I'm untouched

I'm glad to know - Still safe at home
But it is getting on my nerves
Suicidal lunatics - fueled by fanatics
Let's give them what they deserve
Hell On Earth
