It has been so obvious so the truth had to come to light
Yet there is no turning back, no more veils to hide behind
The choice has been made for us to silence Mohammed's word
The last crusade of all crusades to have His dominance restored

A pursuit of power and barrels gasoline
Impose the right religion or anything in between
Incite a cultural conflict, provoke a racial war
By making all of us believe How insignificant we are

If His mighty arm demands it
The machinery will halt
No need to feel sorry
After all it's our own fault
We swallowed all His fucking lies
We thought we knew what it meant
To have faith in The Son, The Father
And our Holy President

Our faith is not of Jesus, but a greater deity
A true faith of the freedoms that He preserves for me

Now His mighty arm demands it
All humanity will halt
No need to be sorry
After all it's our own fault
We'll stand by His fucking lies
No matter what they meant
Now praise The Son, The Father
And our Holy President

"Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be Thy Name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
Let earth and heaven be the same.

Give us this day your judgment;
And reclaim all our debts
We could not resist temptation,
Now deliver us to evil"
