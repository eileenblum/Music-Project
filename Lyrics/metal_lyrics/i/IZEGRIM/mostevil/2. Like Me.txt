I'm a nazi and a christian, satanic and a heathen tooReverted are the records I play, when I've got nothing better to doI wear my bomberjack, if that's the way it's gotta beI'll burn my country's flag, it's all the same to me You fear the words like 'turks' or 'jew', can't call them 'faggots' or 'niggers' tooWhy resist what is naturally divided?Should I be nice while I hate your guts? What's wrong with women that are called a slut?I don't know, maybe I'm too shortsighted Try to read my eyes, 'coz what's really in a nameGet rid of your frustrations, find some minorities to blameI'll use you as my target, but that's something ya should takeA medal still has two sides, so what difference does it make? No, I can't compare to you, you are not like meThen again it's sad but through my eyes you'll never see...
