Living at the wrong place, in the wrong period of timeDealing with moralities which are not really mineLike George Orwells predictions in his '1984'Maybe somewhat different, but globally the sameWe're known by our opinions and no-one can explainwhy some of my convictions are not worth to be endorsed Did it ever occur to you that Jehovahs are o.k. when they're compared to islamic pigs?Did it ever occur to you that the taxes you have to pay supports some jobless obese bitch? I accurse, I defy your double standardsI cannot differ wrong and rightYou assume and that's why those wicked bastardsimplanted figments in your mindIt's just the way it is... You think in holy concepts, conditionally learntImpressed by lesser gods and merits never earnedArousing you with money and phoney make-believeSome things must be faced, yes even when it hurtsA critisizing attitude keeps our consciousness alertfor in this land of milk &amp; honey we're free in thought and speech Think first, then behold, view in perspectiveEvery item has very different sidesThink again and you'll conclude what's not objectiveEvidently there are no truths or liesIt's just the way it is...
