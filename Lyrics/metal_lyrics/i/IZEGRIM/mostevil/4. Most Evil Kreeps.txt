Between here and Trondheim, beyond the gates of HellAt least so I've been told, Blackmetal Panda's dwellInverted crosses are their favourite toys and they make a fuckin' lot of noise! They stroll through winterlands whining about their 'flu.I said purgatory should warm them up. Somehow they never get amusedBurning churches gives them great P.R. Just leave these fools for what they are!Most Evil Kreeps  Howling in the depth of night, You'd better go back to bedTake away your corpsepaint and read some Nietzsche insteadYour horrid language merely makes me frown. Please take away these dumb Norwegian clowns!Most Evil Kreeps
