Gathered sisters, hear my call! United we stand, divided we'll fallRedemption has never been so near for who bear the mark of VenusSewing-machines and pans will melt into weaponry and chastity-beltsMan will face his darkest fears: desecrate the Holy Penis! Why, why, why....tell me why darlingdid you keep us down against our will?Dry, dry, dry....you bled us dry darlingNow you're the one to pay the bill It's time for female terror, Amazonian onslaughtIn mind Lorrena Bobbit, There's a lesson to be taught Your obstrusiveness and obsession with lust, your blindfolded thoughts that makes me disgustconceive my duty of giving birth, My only right to work the dresserYour system of roles surely burns to the ground,and evidently it turns the other way 'roundSo keep in mind: who wears the skirt stands above the things you treasure Lies, Lies, Lies...no more lies darlingYou'll beg for me and I'll be laughingCry, cry, cry......prepare to die darlingI am the nail on your coffinIt's time for female terror, Amazonian onslaughtIn mind Lorrena Bobbit, There's a lesson to be taught
