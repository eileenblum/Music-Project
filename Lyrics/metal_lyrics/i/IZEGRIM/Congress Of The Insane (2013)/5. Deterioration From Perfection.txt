superiority 
perfection

natural selection
evolutionary change
preservation
reproductive success

a once perfect creation
will soon come crashing down
the end of my utopia
in sorrow I will drown

deterioration from perfection

the most versatile generalist
has the greatest success
burning rage inside of me
irrational beliefs

deterioration from perfection

obsessive need for
flawlessness
unattainable goals
higher rate of morality
perfectionism is killing me

deterioration from perfection
can't take it anymore
intense fear of failure
deterioration from perfection
