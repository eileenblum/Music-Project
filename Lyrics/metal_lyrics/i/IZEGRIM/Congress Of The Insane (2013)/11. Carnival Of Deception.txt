possessed by rage
feelings of insignificance
a lak of compassion
violence is glorified

still waters run deep
carnival of deception

everyone seems normal
until you get to know them
motivated by revenge
they take your innocence

it's the ordinary type
quiet and highly intelligent

when there's no more rome in hell
freaks will walk the earth
looking for a scapegoat
policy of hatred

struggle with their identities
social isolation

everyone seems normal
until you get to know them
motivated by revenge
they take your innocence

it's the ordinary type
quiet and highly intelligent

I'm the master of your life
I take your soul
I'm the master of your life
I decide your goal

troubled souls see the glorification
the attention the killers get
sense of entitlement
intolerant attitudes
inspired by the massacre, try to imitate
and the cycle continues
