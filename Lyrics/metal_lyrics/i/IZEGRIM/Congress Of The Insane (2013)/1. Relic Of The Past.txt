A relic of the past erased by modern time
a glimpse in the unknown
no more out of sight and no more out of
mind welcome the face of death

let them rest in the arms of slumber
raw, gaping wounds inside
harsh silence enforced peace
we forget how hard life used to be

A relic of the past erased by modern time
a glimpse in the unknown
no more out of sight and no more out of
mind welcome the face of death

dark eyes remain open
swallowing despair
made to look alive
face of insanity

kneeling for a picture
for the first timein their lives
countenance of grief
because one of them is dead

let them rest in the arms of slumber
raw, gaping wounds inside
harsh silence enforced peace
we forget how hard life used to be

A relic of the past erased by modern time
a glimpse in the unknown
no more out of sight and no more out of
mind welcome the face of death

immortalize the dearly

a way to remember
the eulogy is read
raw emotions
in memory of the dead

A relic of the past erased by modern time
a glimpse in the unknown
no more out of sight and no more out of
mind welcome the face of death

dark eyes remain open
swallowing despair
made to look alive
face of insanity

from carriage to coffin
waves of anguish
through the room
family with their dead child
death has come too soon
