sideshow by the seashore
congress of the odd
naturel born freaks
deranged, insane, oblivious

nowadays a new revolution
becomes a strong obsession
there's no more anonymity
a public cry for attention

you're just a modern day freak
another sheep in the herd
just a modern day freak
you're utterly absurd

travelling exhibitions
living curiosities
monsters of soiety
era of the freaks

childlike attitudes
and short attention spans
immature outbursts
rewire the brain

nowadays a new revolution
becomes a strong obsession
there's no more anonymity
a public cry for attention

you're just a modern day freak
another sheep in the herd
just a modern day freak
you're utterly absurd

the world's gone mad
by the need to share
thoughts are unleashed
consequences forgotten

this social self obsession
turns our lives into hell
it's a fucking freak show
I know you all too well

crisis of identity escessive self love
