I'm sensitive, insecure...
Things I've always hated
But each time that I've been used
These traits are overrated

Blood rushing through my veins,
The death of one has soon to come
I choose the weapon I know best
Come over here and be my guest

I've got the bullets, I've got the gun
Show me your body
And let the blood run

Celebratory gunfire! Celebratory gunfire!

In moments of oppression
My battle cry is heard
I will terminate a life
I give you my word

Blood rushing through my veins,
The death of one has soon to come
I choose the weapon I know best
Come over here and be my guest

I've got the bullets, I've got the gun...

There's nowhere to run
And nowhere to hide

Celebratory gunfire! Celebratory gunfire!

I've got the bullets, I've got the gun...

When shadows begin to disappear
Darkness fills with all its fear
Back into the darkened state
Where Hell is home I'll meet my fate
