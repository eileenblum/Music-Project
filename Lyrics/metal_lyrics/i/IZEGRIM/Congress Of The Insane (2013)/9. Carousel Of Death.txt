norms of decency
language of morality
sense of right and wrong
ideological domination

this lasting state of war
with no clear ending
ongoing tensions
escalate at any moment

secure the shadow before it fades
there's no time to waste
secure the shadow before it fades
look death into the face

process of killing
attaining our goals
collective endeavour
carousel of death

from this ability
to destroy one another
when the target is set
we enter the conquered nation

let us salute the prisoners of war
satisfy emotional hunger
liable for destruction
decorate the earth with graves

mankind carries on perpetual war

secure the shadow before it fades
there's no time to waste
secure the shadow before it fades
look death into the face
