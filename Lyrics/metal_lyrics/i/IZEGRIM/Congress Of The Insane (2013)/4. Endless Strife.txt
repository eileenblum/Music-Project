screams of silence
through walls of steel
bloody tracks of history
give me my present feel

no sense of morality
brutality in here
beaten, raped and mutilated
no boundaries of fear

relieved by exile
the joy of gain
you know what will happen
it's just postponement of pain

in solitude I murder silence
you need to be free
the hatred I caused
I know that you detest me

alone I live in endless strife
I surely cannot break
anger wrapped up in deceit
you've made a grave mistake

right now, defenceless
but my time will come
after this exiele
you're utterly undone
