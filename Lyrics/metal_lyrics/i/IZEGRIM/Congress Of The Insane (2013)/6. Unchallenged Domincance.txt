you can call me crazy
I'm pretty much insane
kill for entertainment
forture my second name

humiliate for pleasure
superior to the weak
interest in violence
now it's time for me to seek

battling is useless
there's nothing left to say
intensify demands
I win this anyway

I am invincible

this pattern of humiliation
made me the way I am
taking down anyone 
is the best I can

my unchallenged dominance
my lack of empathy
treat you in a callous manner
my love for cruelty

death is a common thing
embracing it's cold touch
you'll die for my perfection
thank you so very fucking much
