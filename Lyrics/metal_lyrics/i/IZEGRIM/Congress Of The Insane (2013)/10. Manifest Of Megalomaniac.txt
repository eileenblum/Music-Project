transient thoughts
refuse to put my dream aside
eyes set on the goal
I won't accept defeat

taking by force
subsisting on live prey
undeterred by preposterousness
the shade into rapacity

it's everything I fight for
it's the life to which I swear
dominion of darkness
the depths of your despair

power and possession
the only thing I need
never shall I fail myself
megalomaniac's creed

I'm proud of my life goal
to keep myself alive
guardian of greed
that's my way of life

I'm no longer satisfied
I need more and more
feel like owning everything
I must go oon for sure

it's everything I fight for
it's the life to which I swear
dominion of darkness
the depths of your despair

power and possession
the only thing I need
never shall I fail myself
megalomaniac's creed

I need more and more
never shall I fail myself

it's everything I fight for
it's the life to which I swear
dominion of darkness
the depths of your despair
