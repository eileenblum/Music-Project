My soul is rotting
My life has decayed
I push them down and kill them deeper within myself
I can not save what has already died
Too fargone to see any light
Too fargone to want anything better
Misery

A broken shell in a shattered dream
Secluded with just the memory of despair
Too fargone to remember life
Self-infliction written on my flesh
And nothing more remains for me

I uncover myself
Bitter and mournful 
Only to find
That everything I was
Has already died

Snuff my life
I'm already rotting
Bury me
