I see my own reflection in the mirror
And something is coming closer
So close I can feel them surrounding me

It s getting colder it's getting darker
I can hear them whisper my name
I can hear them speak the words
I can hear them preach about suicide

They are telling me what to do
And they are telling me how to do it
To end my life and to enter the beautiful shining light

Just one step closer to eternity
Just one step closer to infinity
I'm slowly starting to face away
To fade away and die

I've reached the end of the line
All I want is to close my eyes and sleep
All I want is to fade away and die

I've reached the end of the line
All I want is to end my painful life
I'm standing here at the end of the line

My own reflection is slowly fading
And the voices are getting stronger
I cannot take the pain I cannot take it anymore

I'm surrounded by all the shadows
I'm surrounded by the beautiful darkness
Just one more step and I will finally fall
Into the endless sleep
