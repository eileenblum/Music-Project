My life's a symphony of tragedy
Donât know if I'm alive
Or am I dreaming

It is a symphony of agony
And hate is all I live for
Canât take it anymore

Haunted by memories from long ago
I see them with my own eyes
Yet I am blinded

Everytime I lay me down
I see it all I see the sorrow
That has been haunting me

Now I know why it feels so cold
Now I know why I can't live

When I'm awake there is no light shining inside of me
Cause I'm blinded

And when I sleep I can see everything within me
Cause I'm blinded

When I'm awake
I don't believe that I'm alive
Or am I dreaming... ..Don't wanna wake up

I donât believe that I am dead
I am alive when I am dreaming
It's all a mystery

All I see are the shadows
That surround me and they call me
Oh please forgive me

I'm so alone and I am scared
Oh please take me to the other side
And guide me to the light
