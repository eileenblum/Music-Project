Waking up to another day of misery
Waking up to another day of sorrow
Why didn't god let me die in my sleep
Oh death embrace me

I dream of a place where I can breathe
I dream of a place where I am safe
I'm so alone and I cannot live
Another day on my own

I've seen the eyes of god
I've seen the face of light
I've seen it all in my dreams
I've seen it all in my dreams

I've seen myself on the other side
I've seen it all in my dreams
I see it all when I sleep
I've seen it all in my dreams

Here I am in a world of insanity
Here I am in the middle of nowhere
Cast out from this garden of Eden
My eyes are closed and I am dreaming

Locked up in a state of madness
Welcome to my world of depression
Here I am so lost and so alone
Can't someone take away my pain
