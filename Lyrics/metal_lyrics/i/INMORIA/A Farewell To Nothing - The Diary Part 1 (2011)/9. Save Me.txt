Suicide is the only thing I'm living for
You are the only thing I ever dream
Suicide is the only thing I'm praying for
You are the only thing I ever need

I can feel you within me
I can feel you surrounding me

Suicide is the only friend I ever need
You are the only one
And only you can save me

Show me now
Show me everything I need to know
I cannot do it by myself
I'm calling you

I can feel you within me
I can feel you surrounding me

That's why I need you to save me
You are my everything
You are the one for me
I cannot live without you

Thatâs why I need you to save me
You are the one I need
You are so beautiful
Only you can heal me
Thatâs why I need you to save me

Suicide is the only thing I'm waiting for
You're in my dreams and you are everywhere
Suicide is the only way for me to live
You are the only thing I ever need

I can feel you within me
I can feel you surrounding me

You let me dream about the afterlife
You let me dream about eternity
You let me dream about my sacrifice
Here I am beyond insanity
