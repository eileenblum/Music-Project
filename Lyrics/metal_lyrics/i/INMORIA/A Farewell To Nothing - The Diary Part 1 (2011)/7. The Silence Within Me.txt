So lonely
So far away

So silent
I can t hear no breathing

So many empty promises
So many fading dreams

Why do I feel so alone
Oh god why can't you see

The silence within me
Is slowly breaking me
Just like the shadows that are surrounding me
The silence within me
Oh canât you see that I am crying
My life has come to an end
The silence within me

Why do I still believe
Why do I still believe I'll be forgiven

All my life I've been living in sadness
All my life I've been hiding in the shadows
