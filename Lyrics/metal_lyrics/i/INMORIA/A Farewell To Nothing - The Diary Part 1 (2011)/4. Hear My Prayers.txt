Hear me cry
See the tears of endless sorrow
Hear me call
My voice is whispering softly from the shadows
Calling you
To come and see me
Come and see me fade away

I'm crawling here beneath you
I'm trying to hide my hate
I'm trying so hard to forgive you
But you never hear what I say

I still believe
That you will someday hear my prayers
And show me the way
And guide me out of this misery

Why do I pray every night before I go to sleep
Why can't you hear my prayers

Why do I say these words when you never hear me
Why do I pray when I don't believe

Why do I pray every night why do I cry every night
Why can't you hear me cry

I canât take it anymore I can't live anymore
Why canât you hear my prayers

When I'm praying
I'm always crying
I'm calling out your name
I fade into a state of mind
That really drives me insane

You give me no answer
I'll never be forgiven
You'll never stop me
Stop me now from fading away
