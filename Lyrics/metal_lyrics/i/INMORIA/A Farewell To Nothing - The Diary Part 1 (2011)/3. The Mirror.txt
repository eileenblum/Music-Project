I am a mystery
Living in a life of sorrow

I am a blasphemy
Why canât you see
That I'm a trail of chaos

I am a sacrilege
A fading light
Somewhere in the shadows

I am a living lie
Trapped in a circle of sadness
With the mirror as my only friend

Come closer can't you see me
Come closer canât you feel me

The mirror never lies
I've got no reflection still I see the sorrow
The mirror never cries
Yet I see the tears from the face in front of the mirror
The mirror the mirror never lies
Have I lost my mind
Or is it over now
'Cause I canât see my own reflection in the mirror

I am the circle of madness
I am the one who calls you

I am the garden of Eden
A lonely shadow
Don't you know who I am

I am the child in the mirror
An empty face
I am the chaos around you

I am the face in the mirror
Why canât you see
The mirror never lies
