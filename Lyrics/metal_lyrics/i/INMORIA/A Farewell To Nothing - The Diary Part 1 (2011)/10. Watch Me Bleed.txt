Oh I beg you to remember
To remember
Don't forget what I've done
Don't say goodbye
Don't leave me all alone with myself

Oh I beg you to remember
To remember
Don't believe in what they say
Don't believe in what they preach
Donât believe a word

Here I dwell in the shadows
They are calling me
I see them in the darkness
Screaming out in agony
Come watch me bleed come watch me die

Too late to say goodbye
Too late to say I'm sorry
I can't believe that no one is here to heal me
So please just take me away from here

Too late to say forgive me
Too late to ask me why
Can't cry any more, I canât live any more
So come and watch me die
Come watch me bleed

Everytime I look into the mirror
Everytime I look into my eyes
I'm filled with sorrow
And I know for sure it's the last thing I ever do

I see shadows hiding in the dark
I see faces gathering around me
I let them close the circle
Come watch me bleed come watch me die
