In the darkness I see them
I hear what they say
I know I've been losing my mind

Telling me stories
And telling me lies
And god has left me all alone

In the shadows I'm hiding
Away from it all
Screaming for someone to hear

I'm falling apart
I'm fading away
Remember the time that we had
Don't forget me

This is my last farewell
Time is not on my side
I canât believe that I'm falling
I canât believe I'll be gone

My last farewell
Can't go on with my life
I can't believe that I'm dying
I can't believe that I'm slowly fading away

I'm lying all alone
Screaming for you
Tell me how to believe

No one can save me
No one can feel
The pain that drives me insane

Now I know that it's over
I know I have lost
The will to carry on dreaming

Staring at shadows
Crying alone
Take this life and take away all the sorrow
