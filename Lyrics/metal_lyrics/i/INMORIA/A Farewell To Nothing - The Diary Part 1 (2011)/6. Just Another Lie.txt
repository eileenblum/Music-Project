I wake up screaming and I wake up crying
I see the scars are back on my arms

What have I done 'cause I can't remember
Something remains in my dreams

When I sleep there is someone who haunts me
Someone who's cold and alone

He is always standing behind me
So please wake me up from this dream

Wake me up when I sleep

Why is he calling my name
Why is he telling me to follow him
Ending this life I've been given

In his eyes I can see all the sorrow and pain
So please wake me up from this dream

Wake me up when I sleep

Don't you ever speak, don't you ever speak the words
It's just another lie
I don't believe you when you're telling me the truth
It's just another lie
Another lie
Donât you ever speak, don't you ever speak the words
It's just another lie

My own reflection reminds me
Of the life I've been living
Living in sorrow and sadness

All those bleeding scars and wounds that I have
Reminds me of a life without meaning

Promises are given from the shadow within me
Telling me do not be afraid

I am living on the edge of insanity
So please wake me up from this dream
