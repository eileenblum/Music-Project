I see myself
Standing there
So lost and lonely

No one can see me
I'm reaching out
But they all just turn away

Who have I become
Who's the man
That I see in the mirror

A dark cold reflection
Staring back
And it won't leave me alone

They hear me cry
They see my tears
They feel my pain

They say that time heals all the wounds

Why do I cry
I cry myself to sleep every night
I don't believe
That someone will come
And take away my pain
Why do I live

I see me lying there
And all these faces
Staring down at me

They whisper something
That I can not hear
But still I understand

So silently I turn around
And I'm looking into my own eyes
Desperately I close my eyes and cry
