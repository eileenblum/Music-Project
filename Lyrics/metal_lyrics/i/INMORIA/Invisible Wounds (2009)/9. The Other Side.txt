Tell me what Iâve done
Tell me what can I do
To ease my pain and take away the sorrow
Tell me who I am tell me what do you see
When you look into my eyes
And you see all the hate

Tell it to me now
Tell me everything you know
I cannot live another day
I cannot hide the pain
All I wanna do is to leave it all behind me
And fall into an everlasting dream

Come morning stars
Come clouded skies
Come heavenâs light come guiding light
And show me the way to another place
Take me another time
Take me to the other side

Come fading dreams come memories
Come all the shadows come guiding me
And show me the way to another place
Take me to another time
Take me to the other side

Canât you see Iâm crying
Canât you see that Iâm dying
Iâm lying here alone
Iâm lying all by myself
Waiting for someone
To tell me now is the time
To cross the line
And see the other side of life
All I ever wanted
Was for someone to see me
All I ever wanted was for someone to heal me
But now itâs too late
For me to say that Iâm sorry
Itâs time for me
To take the final breath
