In my dreams I can see myself
Standing all alone
Calling out for someone to hear me
But the shadows just move on

In my dreams Iâm walking alone
Trying to find someone to guide me
To the light and away from the shadows
Please show me the way

In my dreams I canât feel no pain
Iâm trying to find a reason to live
My life is an endless journey
And Iâve reached the piont of no return

Iâm living in a fantasy
My life is a tragedy

Sometimes I hate myself
And everything that I have become
Canât control this feeling inside me
Canât go on with my life pretending

Sometime it will come to an end
Iâm slowly fading away Iâm falling
Iâm slowly dying inside
Iâve reached the point of no return
