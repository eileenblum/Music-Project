Like a blind man I lay awake
And I stare into the dark
All alone so no one can hear me cry

Fading light from a distant sun
I see myself at the end of the line
I close my eyes and slowly start to fade away

Why canât you see the tears I cry
Why canât you feel the way I feel
Why canât you see the tears I cry
Why canât you see the tears I cry
Why canât you feel the way I feel
Why canât you feel the way I feel
Why canât you see the tears I cry

All the things Iâve done
And all the things Iâve said
Itâs too late to say Iâm sorry
All my life Iâve been so alone
Iâve been crying myself to sleep at night

In the mirror I can see the reflections
Of a lonely man who is fading away
Broken dreams and a broken soul
I say goodbye and I close my eyes
