All my life Iâve been living in a lie
Iâve been crying on my own
I will die on my own
In my mind I am already dead
I am scared and Iâm waiting
For someone to take me away

Canât you see that Iâm falling
Canât you see that Iâm crying

All my life Iâve been living in a lie
Iâve been lying to my self
Iâve been lying to my soul
I cannot live like this anymore
I just wanna sleep and hope I fade away

I know that someoneÂ´s haunting me
I know that someoneÂ´s calling me
Telling me to end this life of misery

I know that someoneÂ´s holding me
I know that someoneÂ´s guiding me
Away from this pain
And away from this life of misery

All my life Iâve been searching for the light
Iâve been living in the dark
Iâve been living in a dream
I hate everything that surrounds me
And I hate everyone and I hate myself

I am lost and Iâm running out of breath
I fear myself and I fear what I will do
I will die and IÂ´ll never be forgiven
I close my eyes and I will end it now
