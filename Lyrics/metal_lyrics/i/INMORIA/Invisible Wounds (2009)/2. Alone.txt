Is this for real
Or is it just another fantasy
That Iâm living in
Trapped in this nightmare we call life
Iâm blinded by my hate
I canât take it no more

Locked up with the shadows within
I can hear them whisper
I can hear them calling
They preach the words of wisdom
But the words just fade away and die

It feels like Iâm losing my mind
âCause the shadows within tell me how to end my life
Suicide is the only way for me
Donât try to save me âcause I only wanna die

Now itâs time for me to say goodbye
Itâs time for me to close my eyes and fall
I donât wanna be alive
I donât wanna be a part of this anymore

Why donât they leave me alone
Donât wanna live when Iâm alive
Why donât they leave me alone
Donât wanna face another lie

All alone Iâm surrounded by silence
I hear them call my name
I hear them preach the words
They say I must believe
They say I canât go on like this
They never leave me alone

I am not afraid
To take the final step and close my eyes forever
What is left for me to do
Except taking my own life
And leave it all behind
