Everytime before I sleep
I say a little prayer
Wishing that someday I will be forgiven

I lay me down I close my eyes
I start to fade away
In my dreams Iâm so alive
I feel so good inside

When I sleep
I see myself as a little child
All my worries all my hate is gone
And I feel no pain
I see a man that reaches out
I feel so safe inside
Heâs coming closer
And I know that Iâll never be afraid again

I die
But in my dreams Iâm so alive
Take me far away from here
Take my hand and guide me to the light
As I die
My eyes are closed IÂ´m dreaming
I never wanna wake up
I never wanna see the light again
As I die

Iâm so close
Still it feels like an eternity
All my life
Iâve been waiting for this moment
Iâm not afraid
Iâve been praying for this time to come
And now itâs time for me to see the other side
