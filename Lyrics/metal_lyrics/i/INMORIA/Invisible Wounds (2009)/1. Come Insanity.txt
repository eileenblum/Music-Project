I can feel them in my head
I can feel them in my veins
Theyâre always calling out my name
My life will never be the same

I canât see their faces
Everytime I close my eyes and sleep
From the shadows they will come
From the darkness they will arise

Can you see
Can you hear
Can you feel what I feel
Can you feel the pain that IÂ´m feeling

Can you see
Can you save
Can you take me away from here
Can you take me away or come insanity

I am so alone
I wish someone could see all the things that I see
I am so afraid
I canât think I canât live I canât do anything
They try to reach me
And they try so hard to take control
I am lost and I canât believe
And Iâm slowly fading away
