I can feel the pain
And I can feel the sorrow
I can feel the hate
And I am losing control
All my life Iâve been living in chaos
But now itâs over and Iâm falling

I canât close my eyes
I canât feel myself
I canât lay me down
Because I cannot sleep
All my life Iâve been living in darkness
Itâs over now and Iâm crying

Please God just take me away from here
Just take me far away from here
From the haunting shadows
From the endless pain
From the chaos inside
Please take me away

I canât see myself
Because Iâm falling apart
I donât know who I am
I donât know anything
All my life Iâve been living in darknes
But now itâs over and Iâm falling

I am all by myself
I donât need anyone
I canât look in the mirror
Because there is no one there
All my life Iâve been living in darkness
But now itâs over and Iâm crying
