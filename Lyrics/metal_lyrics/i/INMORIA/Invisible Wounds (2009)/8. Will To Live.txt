I donât know if I am dreaming
I donât know if Iâm awake
So many times Iâve seen it before
Or is it just an illusion

I donât know if Iâm alive
Or have I fallen into the dark
Please take my hand
And give me back my will to live

I donât believe in miracles
I donât believe in heaven
Iâm alone Iâm afraid and I cry
And I cannot live like this anymore

I donât believe in paradise
I donât believe in God
Hear me see me feel me help me
Give me back my will to live

Canât someone hear me call
Canât someone hear my prayers
Iâve been waiting for a long time
Please give me salvation

Iâve got nothing more to live for
Iâve got nothing more to say
Please take my hand
And give me back my will to live
