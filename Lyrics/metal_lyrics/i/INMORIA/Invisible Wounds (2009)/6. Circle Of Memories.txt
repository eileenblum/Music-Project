Clouds cover the sky
And I feel how the darkness closes in on me
All the lights are gone
Still I see them coming
Crawling closer to me

Trapped in this corner
Iâm alone so afraid so cold
And IÂ´ve lost the sense of time
I start to scream
But the echoes just keep coming back to me

Without a shadow of a doubt
I can see them coming out of the walls
They surround me like a dark cold circle of memories

I regret all the things that Iâve done
But here I am in the centre of the circle of memories

Night falls and itâs getting colder
I feel the shadows hiding in the dark
What have I done âcause I canât remember
The loneliness I feel is killing me

So cold so afraid
Canât believe that my fear is echoes from the past
I start to scream
But the echoes just keep coming back to me
