Distortion of the darkest black.
The reverence of this cursed time - holding it back.
Drifting from the last, echo of light.
Free from the insight and embracing the soulâs inner night.

Shape of despair.
This utter path to nowhere.
Only the beginning to the greater end.
From death and beyond, from birth to forevermore.
Gasping for hope. 
Meaningful to none.

What ever path is chosen, with every trail of pain.
Distant in memories, then long forgotten in anyway.
A charade at most, grief and greed beyond the words.
As it all ends so complete, buried in the earth.

Never connected, as one perhaps should wish;
to this reality still so cold.
Slightly out of focus and misplaced.
To rot in decay, after the final day - as one in ashes lay.

Strength against strength, oppressing oneâs will.
A lonely path in a world of guilt.
To reach out, wondering where to belong.
In a world of disharmony, where everything feels wrong.

Far from what, one would dream of.
Close to the, ever famous edge.
Trembling and out of balance.
Not knowing, not feeling safe.

What ever path is chosen, with every trail of pain.
Distant in memories, then long forgotten in anyway.
A charade at most, grief and greed beyond the words.
As it all ends so complete, buried in the earth.

Regardless of legacy, close to it - or still so far.
