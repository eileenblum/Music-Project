Freezing inside, a reality cold.
Feeling lost in an unmerciful world.
Drowned despair, without shelter.
Nailed to your fate, is all you are.
Ignorant stupidity, malignant hypocrisy.
A scornful path without recovery.
Perished to nothingness.
Dead to dust descend.

I hate your presence, I hate your cries.
I hate you all, you weak pathetic ones.
I abhor your ways, I abhor your lives.
Led like sheep, a herd under the book of lies.

Born to die in a world full of lies.
A pathetic road to meaningless strives.
A path led to chaos, a trial to the end.
All beauty shall wither, creation drowned in blood.
As I walk the darkest of halls and laugh into infinity.
Once more nailed to the cross, forever rotten and sour.
Led like sheep as grain to reap.
Perished to nothingness.
Dead to dust descend.

Like sheep a herd under the book of lies.
I feel no sorrow, I feel no pain.
But I do feel hatred;
and cleanse the earth from your plague.
