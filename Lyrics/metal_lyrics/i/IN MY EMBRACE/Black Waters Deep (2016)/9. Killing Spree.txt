War!!!!!!!!!!!

Screaming, ready for war; the battle lays ahead.
Bloodlust fills my veins, in longing I strive forth. 
Warfare, chaos and greed; a true mask of my faith. 
Never, never again the weakness fills my heart. 

My eyes are red, my body shakes, I long for human flesh.
Bleeding, screaming, covered in blood; only death remains! 

One pure thought, one glimpse of hope.  Like a pale stream of light before darkness folds.
None will escape, like a plague I strive forth. I come with the darkness, like thunder I will strike.

War!!!!!!!!!!!

Destruction and the joy it holds, the corruption it foretells. 
I take what I want, no one left untouched.
Such beauty, the streams of blood and the longing of decay.
The essence of war, annihilation awaits!
