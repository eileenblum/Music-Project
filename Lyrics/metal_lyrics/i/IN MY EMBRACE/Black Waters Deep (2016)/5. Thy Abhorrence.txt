Hatred, flowing in my veins.
Looking up to the sky in defiance.
I linger, dreaming of its fall.
My abomination, the heavens degradation.
My abomination, the heavens degradation.


The void will be fulfilled, when I rise towards the heavens.
In thrust you will fall flickering to my feet.
Quivering, with agonized abhorrence shining in your eyes; 
as you sink into abysmal despair.

Caged as I once was, you will drown in solitude - as the silence drives you insane.
Then, tortured by the screams of your followers, baptized in the blood of your precious angels; 
as the last thing you will perceive.

I laugh at the sight of your pathetic occurrence, as I drive my spear right through your head!

I raise my chalice in absence of your gazing eyes.
In a malice, I can see awe of my entity.
Unhallowed lands as far as I can see.
And the crown on my head, to remind the hordes of your end.
