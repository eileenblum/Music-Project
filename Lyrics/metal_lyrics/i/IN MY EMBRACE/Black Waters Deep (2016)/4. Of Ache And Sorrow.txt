Walking alongside the world.
Not taking part.
From the outside looking in.
Feeling the surface getting farther away.

Dreams, aches and sorrows. 
..Memoriesâ¦ This burden called life.
The pain and all the doubts.
The pain and all the doubts.

Was it all meant to be?
Everlasting, this breathtaking misery.
Choking, this fading light.
Lost between hope and despair.

Longing for oblivion and resting peace.
But walking farther still, as hope still lingers.
The night keeps closing in.
Yet dawn still retains.

Guitar solo: Bosse Ãhman.

Dreams, aches and sorrows.
..Memoriesâ¦ The night keeps closing in.
Choking, this fading light.
Lost between hope and despair.
As hope still lingers on..
