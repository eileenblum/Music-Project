Slay the breathing, drain them of blood. 
Nail them to their fate, for eternity. 
Give them pledge, without fulfilment.
Give them hope, without any response.
A rebel against their mindlessness.
Condemned to the darkest of halls. 

Still I hate â and I want them to wither away! 
Still I hate â buried in the ground for the final decay!

I admire life, oh truly I do. 
The creation is a work of art and the forces in nature too.
No painting can be filled, with such splendid elegance.
No picture can capture life's grand attributes.

In that sense, I love what I do. 
Because as life's opposite, death is beautiful too. 
And the fear that I create, as you know what will come.
That really fills me with life, as I watch you die.
- I watch you die. 

Still I hate â feel the wickedness grow within!
Still I hate â you will be dust forever, in your eternal grave!

Oh I admire life, truly I do.
The creation is a work of art and the forces in nature too.
No painting can be filled, with such splendid elegance.
No picture can capture lifeÂ´s grand attributes.
