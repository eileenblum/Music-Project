Floating adrift, through this maelstrom called life. 
The anchor is lost, somewhere in the tide. 
No sails that helps, nowhere to hide.
Oh this vast sea, this ocean of time.

Your cries echoes silent, as no friend will ever hear.
Striving for survival but only meeting your own fear.
Going deeper still, sinking so far.
Hoping until the end, as the fading light of a dying star.

Black waters haunting, a mist closing in.
The breath you take, the last one ever made.
Falling down into blackness, where eyes can't ever see. 
No way to escape, no nightmare from which to awake.
Down in the deep, where the darkness draws you in.
Gasping for air, choking shivering despair. 

Dreams shall perish, no future to behold.
Nothing more forever, nothing to no one bestow.
No laughter, no joy, not even tears to bear.
Sinking to the bottom, this is your final lair.

Floating adrift, through this maelstrom called life.
The anchor is lost, somewhere in the tide.
No sails that helps, nowhere to hide.
Oh this vast sea, this ocean called time.
