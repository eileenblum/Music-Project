Striving forward with the one life I have. 
In no need of affirmation at all.
Iâm above who I was.
You canât make me fall.

Curious what lies ahead.
Your chains do not imprison me anymore.
No poisoned words will scar me.
You've lost the grip of my soul.

Walk away from me, youâre only in my way.
Don't try to pull me down, you won't break my mind.

Let me be, away from me. I'll face my fate alone. 
IÂ´m free to go where I please, free to do as I choose.
The past has been left behind, my haunted mind is at peace.
A rebirth lies ahead, next chapter will begin.

The hunger keeps me going.
The thirst drives me forward.
Searching for my time divine.
Time to conquer this life.


Keeping my head up high, I won't look back.
One final chapter to overcome.
Striving forward to a bitter end.
Through the fading light, into the darkness I go.

Let me be, away from me. I'll face my fate alone. 
I'm free to go where I please, free to do as I choose.
The past has been left behind, my haunted mind is at peace.
My rebirth is complete, next chapter has begun.
