Dreams transcending, continuing this path.
Not knowing where it ends and what will be.
Memories haunting, no peace of mind.
Not sure what do to, when will it ease? 

Caught in this maze of emotions, no way out. 
Hopes and longings, not to become real. 
A naive bliss, for a short while.
Not meant to be, not at all this time. 
Life goes on, spiraling down. 
To the black hole, left in the ground.
Thatâs where it ends, nowhere to hide.

To live life the fullest, when itâs still time.
Not regretting things never done.
Things donât always turn out as you might have planned.
Life happens, whatever you might have had in mind.

To the black hole, left in the ground.
Thatâs where it ends, nowhere to hide.

Time moves on, closer to the end.
What lies beyond, no one knows.
Life does not last forever.
The memories of you will fade. 

To live life the fullest, when itâs still time.
Not regretting things never done.
Things donât always turn out as you might have planned.
Life happens, whatever you might have had in mind.
