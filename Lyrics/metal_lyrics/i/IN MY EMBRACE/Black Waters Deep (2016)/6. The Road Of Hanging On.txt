Life, withers away â nothing lasts; death is eternal.
Death, might be the end or perhaps not; but why throw your life away. 

Choose how youâll live, donât be led; by mindless flocks of sheep.
Make your path to a road, to a highway of your own.
Stand with pride; that you dared to look them in their eyes.
No more bowing down, never again letting yourself drown.

Time to rise, time to climb; on top of the world.
Winning your fight, like the sun conquers the night. 

Life, withers away â nothing lasts; death is eternal.
Death, might be the end or perhaps not; but why throw it all away.
Grasp it all, everything in your reach; hang on to every piece. 
Never let go, as your highway is your own.

Time to rise, time to climb; on top of the world.
Winning your fight, like the sun conquers the night.

Life, withers away â nothing lasts; death is eternal.
Death, might be the end or perhaps not; but why throw it all away.
Grasp it all, everything in your reach; hang on to every piece. 
Learn to let go, as your highway is your own.
