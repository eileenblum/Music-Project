"So when they continued asking him
He lifted up himself, and said unto them,
He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her"

Listen closely, to what I'm about to say
I think I've heard just about enough of your hypocritical ways
Don't try to stop me now
Don't you make a sound
You've built yourself up oh so high just to tear me down

I'm so tired of you telling me
How to live and what I should not be
And I'm so tired of you telling me
What to do and what I don't believe
And after all that you're telling me
Why is there hate and only you can see
And I'm so sick of you telling me that I will burn
That I will not be free

This is my song
My red crusade
What will I say?
What will I do?
Maybe it's fear that leads your rage
Maybe you're me and I am you

So go ahead and point your fingers
Tell me who to love is it him or her?
When will you see this is a way, I'm a
S-I-N-N-E-R
Natural Born Sinner

I'm not gonna change
Stay out of my way
I don't need you to understand
That I'm already saved
Maybe you should stop, question all your pain
Can you look me in my eyes and say we're not the same.

Did you really think by pushing me
I would become what you want me to be?
And did you really think by hurting me
I'd open up and just hand you the key?
I know you're scared and don't understand
This is my life, this is who I am
What I do know is come Judgement Day
Before the Lord can you say the same?

This is my song
My red crusade
What will I say?
What will I do?
Maybe it's fear that leads your rage
Maybe you're me and I am you

So go ahead and point your fingers
Tell me who to love is it him or her?
When will you see this is way, I'm a
S-I-N-N-E-R
S-I-N-N-E-R

So go ahead and point your fingers
I'll love who I want, whether him or her
When will you see that god made me a
S-I-N-N-E-R
Natural Born Sinner
SO GO AHEAD AND POINT!
S-I-N-N-E-R
S-I-N-N-E-R
S-I-N-N-E-R
S-I-N-N-E-R
S-I-N-N-E-R
S-I-N-N-E-R
S-I-N-N-E-R
Natural Born Sinner

So go ahead and point your fingers
Tell me who to love is it him or her?
When will you see this is a way, I'm a
S-I-N-N-E-R
S-I-N-N-E-R

So go ahead and point your fingers
I'll love who I want, whether him or her
When will you see that god made me a
S-I-N-N-E-R
Natural Born Sinner
