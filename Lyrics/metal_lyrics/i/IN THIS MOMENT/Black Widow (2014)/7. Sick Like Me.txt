Is it sick of me
To Need control of you?
Is it sick to make
You beg the Way I do?

Is it sick of me
to want You Crawling on your Knees?
Is it sick to say
I Want you Biting down on Me...

Are You Sick Like ME?

Am I Beautiful
As I tear you to Pieces?
Am I Beautiful?
Even at my Ugliest, You always Say...
I'm beautiful
As you tear me to pieces
You are beautiful
Even at Your Ugliest, I Always Say...

You're beautiful and sick like me

Is it Sick of Me
to Feed the Animal in You?
Is it sick to say
I tease the Hunter Like I do?
Is it sick of me
to Watch the Wicked Way you Thrill?
Is it sick to say
That I Live to Break Your Will...

Are You Sick Like Me?

Am I Beautiful
As I tear you to Pieces?
I am Beautiful?
Even at my Ugliest, You always Say...
I'm Beautiful
As you tear Me to Pieces
You Are Beautiful
Even at Your Ugliest, I Always Say...

You're Beautiful and Sick Like Me

Am I Beautiful
As I tear you to pieces?
I am Beautiful
Even at My Ugliest, you always Say
I'm Beautiful
As I tear You to Pieces
You are Beautiful
Even at Your Ugliest, I always Say

You're Beautiful and Sick Like Me

If you can put at the bottom, corrected by Cruel Puppet, Iâd appreciate it.

Keep up the good work!
