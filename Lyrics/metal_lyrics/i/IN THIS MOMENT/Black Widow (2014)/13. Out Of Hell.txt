She's only 16
She has dreams of a girl
She thought she'd be in love
She thought she'd have the white picket fence
Now she stands on the corner
She sold herself to the streets
When the world gave up on her
She gave up on herself
She said, can anybody hear me?
She said, does anybody care?
As the monster pulls up slowly
He asks her how much she is

(You are worthless)
(Sweetheart you're worthless)

He's only 15
The world is passing him by
His father killed his mother
And drugs took over his life
Now he sleeps on the corner
The streets become his home
When the world gave up on him
He gave up on himself
He said, Is anybody out there?
Does anybody care?
The hopelessness is rising
There is only so much one can bare

I said, You are not alone
I'm standing by your side
I walk with you threw hell
I walk with you tonight
We are the forgotten
That nobody wants to face
Together we can rise
Let's climb out of hell
You are not forgotten
I am standing by your side
Your struggle makes you Beautiful
Out of Hell we will climb
