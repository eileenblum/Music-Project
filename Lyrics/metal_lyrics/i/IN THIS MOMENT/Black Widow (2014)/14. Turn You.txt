[Bonus Track]Come inside my room
Tonight you will obey
You have no control
Tonight you're my slave
You want to surrender
I can smell that you're afraid
Tell me exactly what you want
Teach you to behave

In your mind I'll beg
Crawling on my knees
Please can I be yours
I'm all you'd ever need

In the end, I'll
In the end, I'll
I'll turn you

I wanna turn you on
I'm gonna turn you on
I wanna turn you out
I'm gonna turn you out
I wanna turn you on
I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I wanna turn you, turn you, turn you

I'm not gonna make this easy
You thought I'd be screaming your name
I want you to open your mouth
I want you to taste my pain
Tell me what you want me to do
I'll be the best you ever had
I bet you didn't think it would end
With your hands behind your back

In your mind, I'll beg
Crawling on my knees
Please can I be yours
I'm all you'd ever need

In the end, I'll
In the end, I'll
I'll turn you

I wanna turn you on
I'm gonna turn you on
I wanna turn you out
I'm gonna turn you out
I wanna turn you on
I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I wanna turn you, turn you, turn you

You're a dirty little fuck, aren't you
You thought you'd just come in here and just turn me out
I hate to break it to you baby 'cause tonight I'm gonna turn you

In your mind, I'll beg
Crawling on my knees
Please can I be yours
I'm all you'd ever need

In the end, I'll
In the end, I'll
I'll turn you

I wanna turn you on
I'm gonna turn you on
I wanna turn you out
I'm gonna turn you out
I wanna turn you on
I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I wanna turn you, turn you, turn you

You're a dirty little fuck, aren't you
