Dirty pretty [repeating]

Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all?
Tell me I'm the perfect queen

Mirror mirror in my hand
Who's the fairest in the land?
Are they lining up for me?

[Chorus:]
Turn it on, tune it in, let it out [repeating]
Maybe I am not all that I've learned
Close your eyes, and you twist and you turn
I know I am more than they see
I'm everything, everything is me
I won't be what you want me to be
You fit your part in vanity
I don't want to be your dirty pretty

Mirror mirror unleash your tongue
Am I too old, am I too young?
Am I worthy of thy love?

Mirror mirror, you're so vain
Would you sell yourself for fame?
Are you the vulture, or are you the dove?

[Chorus]

I won't close my eyes, like you want me to
I am wild and free, I am untamable...
I'm more than you'll ever see
More than just your dirty pretty

Maybe I am not all that I've learned
Close your eyes, and you twist and you turn
I know I am more than they see
I'm everything, everything is me
I won't be what you want me to be
You fit your part in vanity
I don't want to be your dirty pretty
