I've been waiting on my grave
Waiting for you to rescue me my love
Come back from the dead
You have a bitter heart
And the perfect skull
I said love
All the hurt I need

There's just something about you
That feeds the addict in me
I promised you that I'd hurt you...

You are my god
You are my soul
You are my savior
In a devil's robe
And I can't exist without you
I can't exist without you

You are my drug
My miracle
You are my cure
In this infected world
And I can't do this without you
I'm dying here without you

I wanna lie with your bones forever...

Smear my lipstick across my face
Wipe off all these lies for me my love
Don't need what you see
Kiss my wrists
You're killing me
You're my pill
You're everything I need...

I'm running circles around you
Your skin is under my nails
I don't belong here without you...

You are my god
You are my soul
You are my savior
In a devil's robe
And I can't exist without you
I can't exist without you
You are my soul
My miracle
You are my drug
In this infected world
And I can't do this without you
I'm dying here without you

I wanna lie with your bones forever...

You are my star
I'm in your veins
You're all I have
I serenade your name
Now you can't exist without me
You are my god...

You are my god
You are my soul
You are my savior
In a devil's robe
And I can't exist without you
I can't exist without you

You are my drug
My miracle
You are my cure
In this infected world
And I can't do this without you
I'm dying here without you

I wanna lie with your bones forever...
