[feat. Brent Smith of Shinedown]Red lips, a sinister tongue
(I'll taste you until I cant)
Our trip has just begun
(I'll fly with you til the end)
Psychotic voice
(You are in my veins now)
And there's no denying
(There's no denying)
As we both burst into flames

(You'll come down)
There's no coming down
(Higher ground)
Floating over ground
(Out of body)
Out of body
Inner mind
(I'm your slave)
This is what I crave
I'm lost, I'm saved

It's my obsession, possession began
(Physical, psychical, illumination)
Intoxication, fascination sets in
(Mystical, sexual hallucination)
Sexual (hallucination)
Sexual hallucination

You watch me come undone
(It makes me want you more)
I'm crawling into the unknown
(I'll follow you to the core)
I feel like I'm dying
(I'm right beside you)
You whisper, "We're flying."
(There's no denying)
We both converge as one

(Don't come down)
There's no coming down
(Higher ground)
We're floating over ground
(Out of body)
Out of body
Inner mind
(I'm your slave)
This is what I crave
I'm lost, I'm saved
It's my obsession, possession began
(Physical, psychical, illumination)
Intoxication, fascination sets in
(Mystical, sexual hallucination)
Sexual (hallucination)
Sexual (hallucination)
Sexual hallucination

(I can barely breathe)
I can barely breathe
(I can barely move)
I can barely move
(I can barely) separate (me from) you
This is what I crave
To be your slave

Red lips, sinister tongue

It's my obsession, possession began
(Physical, psychical, illumination)
Intoxication, fascination sets in
(Mystical, sexual, hallucination)
Sexual (hallucination)
Sexual (hallucination)
Sexual hallucination
