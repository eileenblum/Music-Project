I don't need you to save me
I don't need you to cure me
I donât need you and your antidote for I am my disease

I don't need you to free me
I don't need you to help me
I don't need you to lead me through the light

I will always fall and rise again
Your venomous heroine
'Cause I am a survivor
Yeah, I am a fighter

I will fall and rise above
And in your hate I find love
'Cause I'm a survivor
Yeah, I am a fighter

I will not hide my face
I will not fall from grace
I'll walk into the fire, baby

All my life
I was afraid to die
And now I come alive inside these flames

You don't want me to love you
You don't want me to need you
You don't want to look at me for you will turn to stone

You don't want me to hurt you
You don't want me to bite you
You don't want me or my aching soul

For I will only fall and rise again
Your venomous heroine
Iâm a survivor
Yeah, I am a fighter

I will fall and rise above
And in your hate I find love
âCause I'm a survivor
Yeah, I am a fighter

I will not hide my face
I will not fall from grace
I'll walk into the fire, baby.

All my life
I was afraid to die
But now I come alive inside these flames!

[Instrumental intermission]

I donât need you to save me
âCause Iâm a survivor
Yeah, I am a fighter

I will not hide my face,
I will not fall from grace,
Iâll walk into the fire, baby

All my life
I was afraid to die
But now I come alive inside these
Alive inside these
Alive inside these
Alive inside these flames.
