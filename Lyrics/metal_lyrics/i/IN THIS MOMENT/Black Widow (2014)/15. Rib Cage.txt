I don't know how I'll get through this
What's even happening
What did they find
My mother is scared to say a word
My son screams silently
We're out of time

I can not accept this now
They say there's nothing that I can do
To be the one to lead you through
And I fall shattering my knees
You're the only one that I see
You're the only one who knows me

I pull you gently close to me
Lay your head down slow
I'm here, I say
Your body is growing tired
The wind blows quietly
For you I pray

I stare straight into your eyes
I tell you there's nothing you should fear
I promise your path will be clear
I sing you a lullaby
About how spirit's never die
Together you and I will fly

I keep you safe
Safe inside my rib cage

I keep you safe
Safe inside my
Safe inside my
Safe inside my rib cage
