[Bonus Track]Snatched her, screaming your name
Open eyes saw you raping (me)
I'm fine, warring changes the world
Witness the enemy

Being the change
Broken world
Being the change

Never surrender, there's always hope for a new day (what's a new day)
Always remember, life will find a way (life will find a way, life will find a way)

A child starves in the street as a mother's eyes bleed and you carelessly
Walk by with your eyes closed
What are we teaching them?
Severed hearts cry out

Being the change
Broken world
Being the change

Never surrender, there's always hope for a new day (what's a new day)
Always remember, life will find a way (life will find a way, life will find a way)
