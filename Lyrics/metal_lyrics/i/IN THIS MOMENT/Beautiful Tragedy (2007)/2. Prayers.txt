Breathing in and breathing out
My head leaned back my hands are tied
I stand in here alone I scream, questions why
Days slip by and nights I taste
These memories run through my veins
Injecting me with one last kiss, screaming why

This medication can't save me
And desperation takes hold of me
I wanted to believe in all of this
I wanted to believe in you

[Chorus:]
All I am, all I have
Leads me down these roads again
Take my hand, show me the way
And never bring me back here

Determination is pushing me
And perseverance is what I bleed
I wanted to believe in all of this
I wanted to believe in you

[Chorus]

These are my unanswered prayers
The time has come for me to say goodbye
God please hear me, calling

[Chorus]

These are my unanswered prayers
The time has come for me to say goodbye
God please hear me, calling
