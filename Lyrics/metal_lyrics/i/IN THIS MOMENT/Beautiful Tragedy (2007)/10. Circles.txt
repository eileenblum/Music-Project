Black birds swarming
Letting me know I am saved
Shadows dancing
Freeing me from yesterday

Will I be saved, these voices are killing me
Will I make it through the bring of sanity

I know the skies will save me
I know

As we go in circles
I am fading now
As we go in circles

Halo's glowing, showing me where I can turn
Angels falling, somehow I know I am loved

I know the skies will save me
I know

As we go in circles
I am fading now
As we go in circles

I know the skies will save me
I know

As we go in circles
I am fading now
As we go in circles
