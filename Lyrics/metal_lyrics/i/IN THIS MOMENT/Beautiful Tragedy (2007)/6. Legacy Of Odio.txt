As I lie in this moment
Frozen since that day
I've been drowning in questions
Over and over again

Your legacy lives on
And you are by our side
Right here with me
The time has come for you to fly
Now that you're free
You will always live in me

I know you saw their faces
And how they lined up for you
We know that you were looking down on us
As the sky filled with reds

Your legacy goes on
And you are by my side
Right here with me
The time has come for you to fly
Now that you're free
You will always live in me

What I would give just to be with you
This world feels cold and grey since you went away
I see your smiles and love in your sister's eyes
One day we will be one, when we reunite

I know you're by my side
Right here with me
The time has come for you to fly
Now that you're free
You will always live in me

Here by my side
I'll see you again my friend
You will be, always by our side
