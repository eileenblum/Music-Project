Can we run away tonight
And hide from tomorrows

The glass is cracking tonight
Shattering our fears away
The silence in here fades
And it's only your eyes that I see

Take me, pull me all around
Break me, I'm yours

Can we run away tonight
And hide from tomorrows

We die in this moment
And I don't want to wake from this
I can barely breathe
Suffocating on what you gave me

Take me, pull me all around
Break me, I'm yours

Can we run away tonight
And hide from tomorrows

It's quiet now
Whispers confess
Can we run away now
And hide from tomorrow

Can we run away tonight
And hide from tomorrows
