I feel the pressure is building in me
My stomachâs sick, itâs getting harder to breathe
I hear the screaming, I feel the disease
Thereâs blood in the air, and there is death on the breeze

Will you come with me?
Will you stand with me?
Would you follow me?
Would you believe with me?
Tell me youâll bleed with me
Tell me youâll die with me
Come on, come on
Let me hear your war cry
Come on, get up
Let me hear your war cry
Yell it out, do or die
Let me hear your war cry

We wanted peace but you brought this war
We took enough and we canât take any more
With our fists in the air, weâll burn it all to the ground
We will tear your fucking empire down

Will you come with me?
Will you stand with me?
Would you follow me?
Would you believe with me?
Tell me youâll bleed with me
Tell me youâll die with me

Come on, come on
Let me hear your war cry
Come on, get up
Let me hear your war cry
Yell it out, do or die
Let me hear your war cry

We wanted peace but you brought this war
We took enough and we canât take anymore

Will you come with me?
Will you stand with me?
Would you follow me?
Would you believe with me?
Tell me youâll bleed with me
Tell me youâll die with me

Come on, come on
Let me hear your war cry
Come on, get up
Let me hear your war cry
Yell it out, do or die
Let me hear your war cry
