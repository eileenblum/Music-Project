Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Itâs been a long, long road
Itâs been a long, long dream
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
God knows I gave them hell
God knows I tried

But at least I can say
At least I can say I loved
But at least I can say
But at least I can say I lived
When I lay down and die,
At least I can say I lived

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Thereâs not a thing I would change
My heart stayed in the flames
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Itâs been a beautiful tragedy

But at least I can say
At least I can say I loved
But at least I can say
But at least I can say I lived
When I lay down and die,
At least I can say I lived
