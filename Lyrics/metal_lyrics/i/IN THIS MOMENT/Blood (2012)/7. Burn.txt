I feel this is the beginning
The beginning through the end
Thereâs nothing left to fear now
So watch me close as once again you

Burn me alive
Set me on fire
And watch me die
Burn me alive
Watch me ressurect
Right before your eyes

Thereâs no reason to cry now
Thereâs nothing to forgive
This sufferingâs my blessing
The death of sin is how I live
Burn me alive
Set me on fire
And watch me die
Burn me alive
Watch me ressurect
Right before your eyes
Set me on fire
And watch me burn
Set me on fire
And watch me

Burn me alive
Set me on fire
And watch me die
Burn me alive
Watch me ressurect
Right before your eyes
