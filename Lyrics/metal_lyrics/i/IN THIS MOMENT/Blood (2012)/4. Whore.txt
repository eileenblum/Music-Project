Iâm the girl youâve been thinking about
The one thing you canât live without
Iâm the girl youâve been waiting for
Iâll have you down on your knees
Iâll have you begging for more
You probably thought I wouldnât get this far
You thought Iâd end up in the back of a car
You probably thought that Iâd never escape
Iâd be a rat in a cage, Iâd be a slave to this place
You donât know how hard I fought to survive,
Waking up alone when I was left to die
You donât know about this life Iâve led,
All these roads Iâve walked
All these tears Iâve bled
So how can this be?
Youâre praying to me
Thereâs a look in your eyes,
I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything

I can be your whore
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner
I am your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for

Iâm the one that you need and fear
Now that youâre hooked, itâs all becoming clear
That all your judgments that you placed on me
Was a reflection of discovery
So maybe next time when you cast your stones
From the shadows of the dark unknown
You will crawl up from your hiding place
Take a look in the mirror
See the truth in your face

So how can this be?
Youâre praying to me
Thereâs a look in your eyes,
I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything
I can be your whore
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner
I am your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for

I can be your whore
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner
I am your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me, you want me, you need me

I can be your whore
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner
I am your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for
