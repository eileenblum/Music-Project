Iâm so glad that youâre here
Iâm so glad you crawl this low
Itâs so sweet how you care
Iâll bet youâre ready for your show
No

Shut up, shut up, shut up [Repeat 2x]
Youâre gonna listen to what I say this time
Shut up, shut up, shut up [Repeat 2x]
Shut your fucking mouth, this life is mine

Youâre kind, that you feel
Through your rage I can be saved
You embrace my decay
Maybe your light will shine on me
No

Shut up, shut up, shut up [Repeat 2x]
Youâre gonna listen to what I say this time
Shut up, shut up, shut up [Repeat 2x]
Shut your fucking mouth, this life is mine

Shut up, shut up, shut up [Repeat 2x]
Youâre gonna listen to what I say this time
Shut up, shut up, shut up [Repeat 2x]
Shut your fucking mouth, this life is mine
