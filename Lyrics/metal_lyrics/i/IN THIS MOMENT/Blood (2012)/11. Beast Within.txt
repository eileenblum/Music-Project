I donât know how I got here
But we cannot get out
Iâm surrounded by strangers
As the music starts to pound
I see the bodies slowly swayinâ
Movinâ side to side
I feel the animal is rising
As I slowly come alive

So everybody starts to move now
I wanna see you all give way
I wanna tear this place apart tonight
And have you thank me for my rage
Tell me what you came for
Can I give you just a taste?
I wanna see you lose your fucking minds
And rip apart this place

Let me see you move your bodies [Repeat]

Iâll tear you apart
Iâll feed off your heart
I wanna see your bodies grinding just for me
Iâm just what you need, the perfect disease
Donât you wanna turn the beauty into the beast?

Endorphins start to swell now
As I step up to my throne
I feel the monster caged inside of me
Screaming through my bones
I wanna see you start to sweat now
I wanna see you lose your minds
I wanna feel you all from deep within
Swayinâ back and forth all night

Let me see you move your bodies [Repeat]

Iâll tear you apart
Iâll feed off your heart
I wanna see your bodies grinding just for me
Iâm just what you need, the perfect disease
Donât you wanna turn the beauty into the beast?
Let me see you bleed
Let me hear you scream
(Hey-oh, he-ey, oh)
Let me see you move
Let me hear you say (hear you say)

I see the bodies slowly swayinâ
Movinâ side to side
I feel the animal is rising

Iâll tear you apart
Iâll feed off your heart
I wanna see your bodies grinding just for me
Iâm just what you need, the perfect disease
Donât you wanna turn the beauty into the beast?
