Tonight, it feels like a good day to die
Tonight, it feels like a good day to rise
Tonight, we live

Tonight, it feels like a good day to fly
Tonight, it feels like the gods are alive
Tonight, we turn, we ascend
We believe our divinity

I will not bow down
Iâll rise through the sun
Iâm transcending
I am claiming my throne
We are immortal
We rise from the wraith
We are eternal
You are my blood legion
My faith
