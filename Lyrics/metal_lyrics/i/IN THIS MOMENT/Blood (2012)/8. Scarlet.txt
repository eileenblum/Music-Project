You, youâre everything I want
And I, Iâm everything you need
This night is cutting into me
You tie me down, you watch me bleed
And we risk everything tonight

I, I am the misery you crave
And you, you are my faithful enemy
This hunger seems to feed on me
A sacred sin, a dying breed
And we risk everything

They can never know just what weâve done
They can never know just what weâve done
They will never know all the blood weâve shed
The scarlet cross we bear until the bitter end
And they, they can never know just what weâve done

Nothing good will come of this
Iâm screaming out with my last aching breath
Iâll be yours until my dying day
But I can never see you

We, we knew how this would end
And we knew weâd die before we lived
But Iâll never let you go
Iâll never let you go

They will never know all the blood we shed
The scarlet cross we bear until the bitter end
And they, they can never know just what weâve done
I will never let you go
They can never know just what weâve done
I will never let you go

We knew how this would end
