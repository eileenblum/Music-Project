Welcome to the gun show

Hey cowboy how's it going tonight?
Come on in and you can buy me a drink
Hey cowboy I see your pistol is cocked
And you got a look on your face like you want to rock

Welcome to the gun show
Tonight we get wild
Welcome to the gun show
Where the dead come alive
(Where the dead come alive)

Hey cowboy I hope you're fast
'Cause I'm the baddest gunslinger in the west
Hey outlaw, follow me outside
And keep your fingers on the triggers while we party all night

Welcome to the gun show
Tonight we get wild
(Tonight we get wild)
Welcome to the gun show
Where the dead come alive
(Where the dead come alive)

It all comes down to a single moment
The strong will fight and the weak will run
Slide the bullet in the barrel
Let me see you count to ten and draw your guns

Showdown
May the best man win
May the best man win
May the best man win

Welcome to the gun show
(Welcome to the gun show)
Tonight we get wild
(Tonight we get wild)
Welcome to the gun show
(Welcome to the gun show)
Where the dead come alive
(Where the dead come alive)

Welcome to the gun show
(Welcome to the gun show)
Welcome to the gun show
(Welcome to the gun show)
Welcome to the gun show
(Welcome to the gun show)
Welcome to the gun show
(Welcome to the gun show)

Come on cowboys
Come on cowboys
