[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]

I remember that old, quiet day
I remember the innocence with it
I remember the death, it was beautiful
I remember the nothingness of me

I Remember back, in the beginning
I remember the years all too well
I remember dreams of a better world
And I remember what they did to me

I know that I can survive this
I know that there's a way
I know that I can survive this
I see a way

Release me from these memories
And show me a way to be free
Release me from these chains
And show me a way for me to start again and start this all over

I remember the martyrs in disbelief
And I remember the look on their face
I remember all of the filthy waste
And I remember what they stole from me

I know that I can survive this
I know that there's a way
I know that I can survive this
I see a way

Release me from these memories
And show me a way to be free
Release me from these chains
And show me a way for me to start again and turn this all around

I remember the looks on their face
And I remember the filthy waste
And I remember what they did to me
They took my innocence

Release me from these memories
And show me a way to be free
Release me from these chains
And show me a way for me to start again and turn this all
To start again and turn this all around.
