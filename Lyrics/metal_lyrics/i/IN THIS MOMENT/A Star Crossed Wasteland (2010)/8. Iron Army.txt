My soldiers rise.
Protecting me from all my enemies.

I know you had to go, it's my war not yours.
I know you had to go, it's easier to ignore.
I know you had to go, we're not all bred for the battleground.

This is my war.
There is no surrender.
No fear, no more.
I'll never stand down.
This is my war.
You will all remember.
Hear me now, I'm calling out.

I built myself a fucking iron army! [2x]

Their hearts are made of blood and steel.
And they'll march through a hurricane without a fear.

I know you had to go, it's my war not yours.
I know you had to go, it's easier to ignore.
I know you had to go, we're not all bred for the battleground.

This is my war.
There is no surrender.
No fear, no more.
I'll never stand down.
This is my war.
You will all remember.
Hear me now, I'm calling out.

I built myself a fucking iron army! [2x]

Though I walk through the valley of death I will fear no evil. [2x]

I built myself a fucking iron army. [4x]
