Let's blaze!

We just got into town and we've been driving all night.
We've been gone for far too long now it's time for getting right.
So you know where to meet me and you know just what I need.
So show me what I've been missing out on and why I shouldn't leave.

We're not gonna stop tonight we're gonna burn this city down.
We're not gonna stop tonight we're gonna blaze till the morning sun [2x]

We're just now hitting the town and we're taping off the streets.
We've been driving all day and night tell me were you waiting for me.
So you know what's going down and you know just what I need,
So show me what I've been out on and why I should believe.

We're not gonna stop tonight we're gonna burn this city down.
We're not gonna stop tonight we're gonna blaze till the morning sun [6x]
