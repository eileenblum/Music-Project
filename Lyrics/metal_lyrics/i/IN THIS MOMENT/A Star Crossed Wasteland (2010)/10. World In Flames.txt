It's 2:30 am, I slowly come awake and know that something's just not right;
I walk slowly to the door and feel the heat through the walls and smell the burning outside.

And all I can see are these flames around me.
And all I can think is I'm here alone
Please find me and say...

Even if the world ignites into flames you'll be right here by my side.
And as it burns away you smile at me and say that not even death could take me.
Away from you.

The fires are growing close and all I smell is smoke, it still looks beautiful to me.
I hope you get here soon, I've been waiting here for you, I believed in you.

So hurry please, there's flames around me.
Please come and say...

Even if the world ignites into flames you'll be right here by my side.
And as it burns away you smile at me and say that not even death could take me.
Away from you.

Where are you tonight.
Come find me 'cause you're not here by my side.

Even if the world ignites into flames you'll be right here by my side.
Come home to me.

It's burning outside.
Please come home.

I'll be waiting here for you I hope you make it soon.
The flames are right outside my door...
