So here we are now at the end of our road.
So many questions going unanswered.
These streets are dark and led me far from you.
And you never noticed that I was gone.

And now I'm standing here alone.
Still I hold my up head high.
The time has come for me to leave.
It's the only way to survive [2x]

There's no need now for you to say a word.
Your sacrifices for me took a turn.
I hope you're sailing free and on your way.
And I hope you think of me each day.

And now I'm standing here alone.
Still I hold my up head high.
The time has come for me to leave.
It's the only way to survive [2x]

And now I'm standing here alone.
Holding my head high.
The time has come for me to leave.
It's the only way to survive,

Now I'm standing here alone [2x]
It's the only way to survive. [4x]
