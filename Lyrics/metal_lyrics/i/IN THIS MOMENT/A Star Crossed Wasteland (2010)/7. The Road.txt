No matter how dark the road.
I'll find my way.

These thoughts of you are all I have to pull me through this fight
My heart is strong and true.
There's nothing I won't do to show you.
I would sacrifice my dying breath for you.

No matter how dark the road
You'll light my way.
No matter how far my home.
I'll find my way.
The bridge is burning and there's no returning.
To the desert songs of yesterday.
These streets are cracked and all the trees have died.
But I will not lose faith I will not stray.

No matter how dark the road
You'll light my way.
No matter how far my home.
I'll find my way [3x]
