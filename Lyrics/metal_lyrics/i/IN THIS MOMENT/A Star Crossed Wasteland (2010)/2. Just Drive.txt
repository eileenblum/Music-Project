Just drive!!
Tonight is the night let's get ready to go.
Leave your bags behind and let's hit the road.
Tonight is the night, there's no time to lose, let's get going.
Tonight is the night let's follow moon.
You can take the wheel and I'll breathe the wind.
With my head back and hands in the air I am flying.

Just Drive!
Take me away tonight, just me with you tonight.
Down the winding road, we will let not go.
We will drive no matter how far.
Yes we will drive until the ending of it all.

So here we are we left the world behind.
You've got your foot on the gas and it's do or die,
And those four wheels are all we need as were cruising.
So here we are in this Cadillac.
We've got the rag top down and the seats are back.
You turn to me you say baby tonight we're flying.

Just Drive!
Take me away tonight, just me with you tonight.
Down the winding road, we will not let go.
We will drive no matter how far.
Yes we will drive until the ending of it all.

Just Drive! [2x]
Down the winding road, we will not let go.
We will drive no matter how far.
Yes we will drive until the ending of it all [2x]
