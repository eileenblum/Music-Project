Lavender clouds
Nothing matters here
Flying above
The ultraviolet sphere

And I will not look down

I am falling down the rabbit hole
Come so come with me and float
Into the never ending dream

We see God
In the morning sun
Touching the moon
Our birth has just begun

And I will not come down

I'm falling down the rabbit hole
Come so come with me and float
Into the never ending dream
