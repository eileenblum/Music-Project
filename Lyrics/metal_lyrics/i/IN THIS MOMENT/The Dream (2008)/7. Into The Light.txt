Can anybody tell me why
We're lying here on the floor
And neither of us can barely breathe at all
The doctors saying hold on tight
As we say our last goodbyes
And this is, a moment that changes our whole lives

And I still believe in the good
And I still believe in the light
And I wanna feel the sun
I wanna free you tonight
And I still believe in the good
And I still believe in the light
And I wanna feel the sun
I wanna free you tonight

I'm staring deep into your eyes
They're telling me the time has come
And I know you're ready to rise and sail home
The room is filling up with light
As we say our last goodnight
I thank you for everything second of your life

And I still believe in the good
And I still believe in the light
And I wanna feel the sun
I wanna free you tonight
And I still believe in the good
And I still believe in the light
And I wanna feel the sun
I wanna free you tonight

I'm falling, watching as your hurting
I'm down here I'm on my knees
How can I survive
And you turn to me and promise me you're ready
And tell me you'll be waiting on the other side

And I still believe in the good
And I still believe in the light
And I wanna feel the sun
I wanna free you tonight
And you showed me all the good
And you lead me through the light
And you gave me the sun
It's time to free you tonight
