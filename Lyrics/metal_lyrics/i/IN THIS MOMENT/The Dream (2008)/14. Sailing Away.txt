It's true, I was waiting for a sign
I knew, the storm within your eyes
For you, the thoughts would glide away
I'm with you, it's all I like

I feel you surrounding me, shining the way through myself

We're sailing away
Lost in the tide of drowning
We're sailing away into the waking

I breathe, I'm breathing you in
I know, I feel it all begin
You'll hold, the secret of the wind
I'm yours, to have and to hold

My kisses surrounding you I know every moment is true

We're sailing away
Lost in the tide of drowning
We're sailing away into the waking of the sun.

I feel you surrounding me
Shining away from ourselves

We're sailing away
We're sailing away

We're sailing away
Lost in the tide of drowning
We're sailing away into the waking of the sun.

Sailing away
We're sailing away
We're sailing away into the waking.
