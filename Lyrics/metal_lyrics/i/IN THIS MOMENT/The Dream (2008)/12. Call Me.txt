[originally by Blondie]Colour me your colour baby
Colour me your car
Colour me your colour darling
I know who you are
Come up off your colour chart
I know where you're coming from

Call me on the line
Call me call me any anytime
Call me my love you can call me any day or night
Call me

Cover me with kisses baby
Cover me with love
Roll me in designer sheets
I'll never get enough
Emotions come I don't know why
Cover up love's alibi

Call me on the line
Call me call me any anytime
Call me my love
Call me my love you can call me any day or night
Call me

Ooh he speaks the languages of love
Ooh amore chiamami.
Oo appelle-moi mon cherie
Anytime anyplace anywhere anyway
Anytime anyplace anywhere any day

Call me for a ride
Call me call me for some overtime
Call me in my life
Call me call me in a sweet design
Call me call me for your lover's lover's alibi
Call me
Call me
Call me
