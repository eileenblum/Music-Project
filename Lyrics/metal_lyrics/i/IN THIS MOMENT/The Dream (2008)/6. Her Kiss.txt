in effect if you fall to the bottom of perfume of confessional you can find my favorite kiss

I feel you growing closer
I feel you in the air
And I call
I know you hear the voices
I know you're drawing near
And I'm waiting

Come away
Come away with me
Come away

In the dawning of my night
I am free
Lying by your side

There's a fire in the water
You're drifting into me
Falling free
Burning eternally
Confessing all
I keep thee

Come away
Come away with me
Come away

In the dawning of my night
I am free
Lying by your side
And as the stars begin to call
I awake
As you're diving down for me
