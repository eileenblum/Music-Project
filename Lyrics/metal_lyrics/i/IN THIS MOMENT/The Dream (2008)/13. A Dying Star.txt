I was never good enough
I listened to their lies
I crucified myself
I always, but now I realize
That Iâm the only one
Who can mend my ways

How did I come so far
My everlasting flame, my dying star

I was my own worst enemy
I was blinded by my shame
A hopeless masquerade
Never ending
The guilty down inside
Was a blessing in disguise to mend my ways

How did I come so far
My everlasting flame, my dying star
I can mend my ways

Now, Iâm flying, hanging on the wind
Following the night
And ride
Leave gravity behind
Following the light
Finally I can breathe

I
I bury all my doubts
I've learned to live without
The fear of endless scars
In this star

I can mend my ways
How did I come so far
My everlasting flame, my dying star
I can mend my ways
How did I come so far
My everlasting flame, my dying star
My dying star
