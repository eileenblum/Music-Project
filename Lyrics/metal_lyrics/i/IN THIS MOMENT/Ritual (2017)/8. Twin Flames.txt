Baby watch as I step into flames for you
Baby watch me combust and explode for you
Baby watch as I burn
Baby watch as I burn for you
One last time

We were on fire
A frequency of me and you
We were on fire
One flame bursting in two
We were on fire
We watched the whole world burn away
We were on fire
I was you and baby you were me
You crawled into these flames with me

So watch me dance and watch me fly for you
One last show my dear in the purple
Baby watch as I crawl
Baby watch as I crawl away from you
One last time

We were on fire
A frequency of me and you
We were on fire
One flame bursting into two
We were on fire
We watched the whole world burn away
We were on fire
I was you and baby you were me

We were on fire
A frequency of me and you
We were on fire
One flame bursting into two

We were on fire
A frequency of me and you
We were on fire
One flame bursting into two
We were on fire
We watched the whole world burn away
We were on fire
I was you and baby you were me

We were on fire
We were on fire
We were on fire
I was you and baby you were me
Crawl into these flames with me
