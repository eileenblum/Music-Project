Oh Lord won't you save me
Save me from myself
Oh Lord won't you forgive me
For I have lost control

Oh Lord won't you tell me
Am I the righteous or the damned?
Oh Lord won't you please hear me
Do I obey or do I command?

Oh oh oh oh oh
(Exorcise the demon) 
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Exorcise the demon) 
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Exorcise the demon)
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Lord, save my soul)

Oh Lord can't you save me 
From my twisted little mind
Oh Lord won't you please show me
How to turn the water to wine

Oh Lord won't you show me
Am I the sinner or the saint?
Oh Lord won't you please tell me
Was all my suffering in vain

Oh oh oh oh oh
(Cast the devil away)
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Cast the devil away)
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Cast the devil away)
Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh God have mercy on me  
Oh God have mercy on me  
Hold me down under holy water
I fear I been laying with the devil
I been laying with the devil
(We will pray)
I been laying with the devil
(We will pray)
I been laying with the devil
(We will pray)

Oh Lord please forgive me
For what I'm about to do
Oh Lord won't you believe me 
I'll burn in hell for you

Oh Lord won't you teach me
Teach me how to see
Oh Lord tell me you love me
Am I Lillith or am I Eve?

Oh God have mercy on me  
Oh God have mercy on me  
Hold me down under holy water
I fear I been laying with the devil
(Cast the devil away)
I been laying with the devil 
(Save my soul)

Oh oh oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh oh oh)

God have mercy on me  
Oh God have mercy on me  
Hold me down under holy water
I fear I been laying with the devil
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
I been laying with the devil
(Oh oh oh oh oh)

Hold me down under holy water
I fear I been laying with the devil
