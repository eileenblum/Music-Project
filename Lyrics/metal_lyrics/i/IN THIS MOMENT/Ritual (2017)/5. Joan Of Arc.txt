"Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil"

You keep pushing me right to the edge
You are sanctified and I'm just a mess
And you blame me for
You blame me for everything you hate
And you wage your wars
No matter what I give you always take

(God what have I done)

You can crucify
You can nail me to your cross
(Light me up Light me up)
You can find me guilty for everything you've lost
(Light me up Light me up)
Go ahead blame me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Make me your martyr
I'll be your Joan of
Ill be your Joan of Arc

You want to satisfy your high demand
You want to touch my face with your dirty hands
So you blame me for
You blame me for the madness you create
And I wage my war
'Cause either way you'll burn me at the stake

(God what have I done)

You can crucify
You can nail me to your cross
(Light me up Light me up)
You can find me guilty for everything you've lost
(Light me up Light me up)
Go ahead blame me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Make me your martyr
I'll be your Joan of
Ill be your Joan of Arc

"Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil"

"And to the everlasting fire prepare for the devil and his angels"

"What do you want from me?"
"Nothing..."

I have no need for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
I have no need for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Sacrifice me

You can crucify
You can nail me to your cross
(Light me up Light me up)
You can find me guilty for everything you've lost
(Light me up Light me up)
Go ahead blame me for your sins
Go ahead and sacrifice me
Make me your martyr
I'll be your Joan of
Ill be your Joan of Arc
