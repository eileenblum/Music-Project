Baby I'm sick inside
I'm definitely out of my mind
I know there's something not quite right
Disconnect system override

You're so brave from your side of the glass
And you you can't compute you can't do the math
And you're you're playing god with your remote control
But I already know that there's a flaw in my code
And the the truth is you silently study me
And there are consequences that you cannot see
And you ask yourself how did I unplug
But the simple truth is that I just don't give a fuck

I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care

You say you're the cure but I smell your disease
I've figured you out like a rat in a cage

So come in tie me down try and reprogram me
Please run your tests tell me how I am malfunctioning
You cut me up sew me back together one more time
I'm not in sync data breach can't bring me back on-line
You start to panic when you realize
You try to shut me down when you look in my eyes
No matter how hard you try to rewire me
Or psychoanalyze my psychology

I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care

You say you're the cure but I smell your disease
I've figured you out like a rat in a cage

You put away your needles and knives
Tell me do you feel satisfied
Did you get what you came here for
I can tell you still want more
Did you get everything you need
Are you finished watching me bleed
Did you think you could just walk away
Did you think I'd just let you leave
Maybe you didn't think I would know
Maybe you didn't think I would see
'Cause I'll never give what you want
I learned the truth a long time ago
I would die before I

Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Baby I don't care

Don't tell me you're pure as you spread like a plague
I've figured it out you're the rat

Baby I don't care
I don't care
Baby I don't care

Don't tell you're pure as you spread like a plague
I've figured it out you're the rat

The rat in the cage
You're the rat in the cage
