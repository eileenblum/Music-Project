[feat. Rob Halford of Judas Priest]Priest are you there
Can you hear my voice
Do you hear my prayers
Are you out there
Forgive me priest for I have sinned
I know not what I do
Mother I am here
I can hear your song
I can feel your fear
He's done you wrong
Temptation fed his own desires
In the ring of fire
In my ring of fire tonight

I would have loved you for a thousand years
I would have died for you
I would have sacrificed it all my dear
I would have bled for you
'Til death do us part
You were unholy right from the start
Its a nice night for a black wedding
Its a nice night for a black wedding

I heard your cry and I just knew
I never meant to forsake you
Mother there's no reason to repent
You know not what you do
I heard the bells and I just knew
An angel once now a ghost of you
Deliver me from my own desires
From my ring of fire
From my ring of fire tonight

I would have loved you for a thousand years
I would have died for you
I would have sacrificed it all my dear
I would have bled for you
'Til death do us part
You were unholy right from the start
Its a nice night for a black wedding
Its a nice night for a black wedding

Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding

C'mon

I would have loved you for a thousand years
I would have died for you
I would have sacrificed it all my dear
I would have bled for you
'Til death do us part
You were unholy right from the start
Its a nice night for a black wedding
Its a nice night for a black wedding

Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
Nice night for a black wedding
