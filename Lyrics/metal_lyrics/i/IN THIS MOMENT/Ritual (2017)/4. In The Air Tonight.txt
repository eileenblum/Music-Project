[originally by Phil Collins]I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Oh Lord

Well if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin
I know where you've been
Its all been a pack of lies

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this for all of my life
Oh Lord
Oh Lord

Well I remember I remember don't worry
How could I ever forget
Its the first time
The last time we ever met
But I know the reason you kept your silence up
Oh no you don't fool me
Well the hurt doesn't show
But the pain still grows
Its no stranger to you and me

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this for all of my life
Oh Lord

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this for all of my life
Oh Lord
Oh Lord

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all of my life
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
