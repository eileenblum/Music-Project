What have I gone and fucked up again this time
How did I become my own demise
All these twisted little parts of me
Afraid of losing everything
So I I pulled the trigger and I fired away
I pulled the trigger and I fired away

Can you still hear my voice from afar
Your dead flowers are still hanging on my walls
I felt God when you were near
For once everything seemed so clear
Until you you pulled the trigger and you fired away
You pulled the trigger and you fired away

The shot you took was overdue
Its a good thing I am made of scar tissue
Made of scar tissue

You pulled the trigger and fired away
Won't you lay your guns down
You pulled the trigger and fired away
Won't you lay your guns down
Won't you please lay your gun down
(Won't you lay your guns down)
Won't you lay your gun down
Lay your gun down
(Won't you lay your guns down)
Won't you lay your gun down
Won't you lay your gun down
