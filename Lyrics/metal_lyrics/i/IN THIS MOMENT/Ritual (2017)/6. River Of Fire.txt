Let it rain
Let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Let it rain
Let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Baptized in a river of fire

The storms here I'm so high
Thunders calling me I'm going outside
The sky cracks the wind stings
I want to feel you strike me down with lightning

Let it rain
Let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Let it rain
Let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Baptized in a river of fire

Let the storm rage let the water run higher
Baptize me in a river of fire

I cry out for glory
I wanna drown in your wrath and fury
I feel your need I taste your pain
Show me what you got bring on the hurricane

Let it rain
Let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Let it rain
Let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Baptized in a river of fire

Let the storm rage let the water run higher
Baptize me in a river of fire

Let it rain
Let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Let it rain
Let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Baptized in a river of fire

Let the storm rage let the water run higher
Baptize me in a river of fire
Let the storm rage let the water run higher
Baptize me in a river of fire
Let the storm rage let the water run higher
Baptize me in a river of fire
Baptize me in a river of fire
