Another short summer has faded again
The longer nights now await
The years drift away into a distant shade of gray
through cold winds of a new frost and morning dew
Obscure memories of a year passing by
Ending at midnight, celestial starlight
Fast asleep we lie, but not for very long,
for winter is near, soon arriving at dawn

Another truth is silent, kept away in secrecy
Another world divided, who will protect and shelter me?
Show me my life and the warm feeling again
The one of a kind I remember as I watch the last sunset

I gaze at your falling leaves painted vividly clear
The days grow colder, in December I'll surrender
to your cold fall breeze, bringing nostalgic peace
Casting no shadows, the raven sings me to sleep

Dusk is approaching, twilight's so near
Now I'm reflecting on another long year
Ooh, now the sun is setting
What will autumn's end bring?
Another winter of pain to crush my heart once again?

Another truth is silent, kept away in secrecy
Another world divided, who will protect and shelter me?
Show me my life and the warm feeling again
The one of a kind I remember as I watch the last sunset
The last sunset - the last

As I close my eyes one last time for this final transition,
I'll know that I've lived my life
with no regrets, nothing left undone
It's time for me to say goodbye
Now it's time to watch the last sunset

Can you remember a time when you were young?
Can you remember the one and only one?
Can you remember a time without worry?
Can you remember when you still believed?

Another truth is silent, kept away in secrecy
Another world divided, who will protect and shelter me?

Another truth is silent, kept away in secrecy
Another world divided, who will protect and shelter me?

Show me my life and the warm feeling again
The one of a kind to remember as I watch the last sunset

Can you remember a time when you were young?
Can you remember the one and only one?
Can you remember a time without worry?
Can you remember when you still believed?
The last sunset
The last sunset
The last sunset
The last sunset
