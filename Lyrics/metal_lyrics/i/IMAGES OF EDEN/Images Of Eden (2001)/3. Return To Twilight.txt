Awake as I enter into a dream
The sunrise of a deep warm midnight
In bliss, I'll rise into the dawn
and penetrate the dusk of light
This is what brings me to life
This is my return to twilight

I'm the one who will set the sun
and fill your midnight with delight
Longing, yearning, you lie before me
living out your fantasy
This is what keeps me alive
Now I return to twilight

Surrounded by images of Eden
Dreaming at the edge of Heaven
Make this last forever
Now I've found bliss
No, don't ever let it end
No, don't ever let it end

You are the only one for me, I know you can see
You're a dream come true, I cry for you
I took my chances and gave my heart
Now I pray we'll never be apart

Surrounded by images of Eden
Dreaming at the edge of Heaven
Make this last forever
Now I've found bliss, no, don't ever let it end
Don't take away my bliss
Don't take away my bliss
