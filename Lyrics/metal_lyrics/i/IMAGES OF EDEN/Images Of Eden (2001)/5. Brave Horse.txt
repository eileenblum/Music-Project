Why is it that all I do only benefits someone else in the end?
Am I a martyr or cursed with good intentions?
Some may need to help me through a crying secrecy,
but a state dependency is what the truth might be

Brave horse - there's love around you, just look, you'll see
Brave horse - always seeing you in their every dream
Brave horse - all will want you, they're in ecstasy
Brave horse - all have found you, no more fantasy

Please another and curse the other
Fulfill yourself, but accuse one another
for their so-called "wrongful convictions"
But a contribution to your stealth addiction

Brave horse - there's love around you, just look, you'll see
Brave horse - always seeing you in their every dream
Brave horse - all will want you, they're in ecstasy
Brave horse - all have found you, no more fantasy

Living in your callous world,
no one cared when I cried
For everyone who lied, judged me or criticized,
now it's my time to shine

Brave horse - there's love around you, just look, you'll see
Brave horse - there's love around you, just look, you'll see
Brave horse - always seeing you in their every dream
Brave horse - all will want you, they're in ecstasy
Brave horse - all have found you, no more fantasy

Brave horse - always seeing you in their every dream
Brave horse - all will want you, they're in ecstasy
Brave horse - all have found you, no more fantasy

Now I'm alive, now I'm alive
And it's my time to shine
Now I'm alive, yeah
