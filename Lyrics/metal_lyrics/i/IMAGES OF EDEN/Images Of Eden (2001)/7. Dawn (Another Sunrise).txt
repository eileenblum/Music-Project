I pray and hope that we'll see the sun
Who do you seek to lie beside you?
Smoke circulates your reason
I wish for the morning to blanket me and cover you
A mere wish can no longer keep me from praying
A mere wish can no longer keep me here

Yesterday and days before (Yesterday and days before)
Faces I don't see anymore (Yesterday and days before)
I can't stop the way we change, (Yesterday and days before)
but I'm not sorry... I'm not sorry anymore

Has her heart been broken?
She needs the shelter of her shroud,
a pulse, the cradle and the salt to trickle down
The moon to guide her within the hall
The morning to awaken her
I'm not her miracle anymore
I'm not her miracle anymore

Yesterday and days before (Yesterday and days before)
Faces I don't see anymore (Yesterday and days before)
I can't stop the way we change, (Yesterday and days before)
but I'm not sorry anymore
I'm not sorry - the sun will rise again

What would you do if you only lived in the dark
with no one to kiss you and tell you goodnight?
When will I realize that I can't relive yesterday?
When will I remember memories last forever?

Yesterday and days before
Faces I don't see anymore
I can't stop the way we change,
but I'm not sorry, no, I'm not sorry anymore
I'm not sorry, no
I'm not sorry, no
The sun will rise again, yeah
