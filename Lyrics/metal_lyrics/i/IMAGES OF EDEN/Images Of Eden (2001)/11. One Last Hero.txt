Questions and confusion fill my mind
The dilemma always remains
How could I go on if I made this great mistake?
I could never live with it, but I could never get rid of it
There's only one solution
Under the knife, no more confusion

Alter my life, alter my fate!
Never too soon, not a minute too late!

I could never bear to see the pain of a life that I created
Go unwanted, falling down in this cynical world of hate
I took the necessary extreme and altered my fate
I know I'm only a mortal man, but playing God just the same

Don't rip me off my cross!
My faith will not be lost!

You came to me, you took my hand
Gave your love to me, may the past be damned
You swear to me I'm the only one
My love is divine, now we set the sun

My wounds have been mended, my soul is finally at peace
My scars have now healed, I've waited so long to release
I'm free to live, free to love without regret, worry or fear
There's no more confusion, now everything is clear

Where were you when I was falling down?
It doesn't matter anymore

You came to me, you took my hand
Gave your love to me, may the past be damned
You swear to me I'm the only one
My love is divine, now we set the sun

Where were you when I was falling down?
It doesn't matter
Now I've set the sun
Now I've set the sun
Now I've set the sun
Now I've set the sun
Now I've set the sun
Now I've set the sun
