It's getting late, are you still awake?
Lay your head down, rest your soul, soon I'll be home
Listen to me, don't be afraid
that all will fall apart and I won't be there for you
You made no mistake with me, I know it's true
Words can only say so much, so let me prove it to you

Have no fear, I'll be here to save you from the dark
and protect you while you sleep
Stay close to me and you'll see me
wash away your bad dreams and all that you fear
You made no mistake with me, I know it's true
Words can only say so much, so let me prove it to you

I'm going to make you mine forever
I want... want to watch you shine
and save you from the pain of the world,
to cleanse you with my morning light
I want to watch you shine, ooh, yeah
Let go of your past, believe in me
Oh, together we'll drift away in our dreams

A full life to live with so much to give
Take the good with the bad, a long road lies ahead
If I should die before you, don't cry
when you close your eyes and fall asleep
I'll see you in your dreams

I want to watch you shine, ooh, yeah
Oh, I'm going to make you mine forever
and save you from the pain of the world,
to cleanse you with my morning light
I'm going to watch you shine, ooh, yeah
Oh, I'm going to watch you shine, ooh, yeah
Oh, I'm going to watch you shine, ooh, yeah
