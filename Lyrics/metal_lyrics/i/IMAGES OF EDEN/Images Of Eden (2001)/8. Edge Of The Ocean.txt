Early sunrise - genesis
It's what we call morning, a new beginning
Forever in sight, the horizon
Here, I'm the only one under the sun

Blue sky, white clouds, cold water at my feet
Waves breaking, seagulls singing
Wind on the water, to the heavens I'm reaching
For the sight of forever, please give it to me
Give it to me

Sunlights on the ocean seems to be
A reflection of what we see in our dreams
It's a sight of forever, a fantasy,
But a feeling to me, serenity

A beginning with no end at the edge of the ocean
A renaissance we see at the edge of the sea

A beginning with no end at the edge of the ocean
A renaissance we see at the edge of the sea

A beginning with no end at the edge of the ocean
A renaissance we see at the edge of the sea

A beginning with no end at the edge of the ocean
A renaissance we see at the edge of the sea

We can't see beyond the horizon,
But we can just keep dreaming,
Just keep reaching, just keep dreaming
No, just keep believing
