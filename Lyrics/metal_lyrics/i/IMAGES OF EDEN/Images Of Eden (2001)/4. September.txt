I'm not alone anymore, remember
I'm not afraid anymore, remember
Though I'm still the same in September
and the dream still remains September... September

I'm not alone anymore, remember
I'm not afraid anymore, remember
Though I'm still the same in September
and the dream still remains September... September

Sometimes we find that our bad times
seem to happen for a reason
At the time, why, we might not know,
but later we learn that they helped us grow

Each day brings a new adventure
Try to forget the burdens in your life
Just remember the glory and the pleasure
Then you have discovered life's treasure

I'm not alone anymore, remember
I'm not afraid anymore, remember
Though I'm still the same in September
and the dream still remains September...September

You gave me rebirth under your sign
By the grace of God, you brought me back to life
You gave me the world I only hoped for
I've waited so many years to feel alive again

I'm not alone anymore, remember
I'm not afraid anymore, remember
Though I'm still the same in September
and the dream still remains September
You are my fantasy, remember
You are life without grief, remember
You're my soul complete, remember
I'll love you eternally, I'll always remember
The next day is dawning
The next day is dawning
The next day is dawning
