Another day is over, another night has just begun
So lonely and cold, but your heart always warms my soul
I'm here all alone, wondering where you are
I'm in the dark

Another morning, a new day to dream
With you in my heart, a feeling so serene
No, I try, but just can't find the right words to say how I feel,
and I'm wondering where you are again today

Tell me who you dream of when you sleep
Tell me who you cry for when you weep
Tell me all your lifelong hopes and dreams
Tell me, show me how love can be true

Rainy mornings bring me peace
They wash away all my bad dreams
With you, I can find all the love I've left behind
It's the pursuit of my reason to live
My heart sees I cannot lie
I cannot lie

Together again, I pray this will never end
The angel next to me, so beautiful and fast asleep
One last kiss goodnight, I wait for the morning light
I want to share my life with you
I'm tied to a wish come true
