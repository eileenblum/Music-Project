This morning dawns after a long rain
Trees still drip drops of water on warm ground
Green leaves of an April spring are blooming
I fade away into a void, no more gray
Dove's singing at my windowsill as I wonder and think
The cold wind calms the bright sunlight
It's 12 o'clock, high noon, I'm sitting in my room
Feeling serene, daydreaming in my bliss
on this bright afternoon

What will I do today? There's no more disarray
I'm finally at peace now that I've won
What will I do today? There's no more disarray
Through the eyes of God, I've set the sun

Now I'm home again,
and I know I'll never be alone again...no

Live for today and every day,
but be careful, you might be the one
Addicted to fate, not knowing at all
Ignorance can put you under the gun

What will I do today? There's no more disarray
I'm finally at peace now that I've won
What will I do today? There's no more disarray
Through the eyes of God, I've set the sun

Live for today and every new day,
but be careful, you might be the one
Addicted to fate, not knowing at all
Ignorance can put you under the gun (x3)
