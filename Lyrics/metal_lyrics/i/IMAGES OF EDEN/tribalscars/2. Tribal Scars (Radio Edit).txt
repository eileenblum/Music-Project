The red sun is still burning
War paint is drying
Warm rain is falling from a cloudless sky
War dance under moonlight
Great Spirit, give us sight
Until the morning sun ignites

Dance with me and the rain will fall
Around the fire, we'll pray âtil dawn
Heal your wounds and breathe new life
Now your war is overâ¦ inside

Moonlight is fading
Now dawn is breaking
Can you feel the scars through my words?
In a tribe where I never wanted to be
In a tribe where I never want to leave

Blood still flows from our scars

Twilight skies ablaze- turning dusk into dawn
Moonlight seas of haze- crying through song

Iâm just a feather in the Great Spirit's hand
The poet- write your words through me
Iâm still holding on by a thread so thin
All that remains is my one and only dream

Twilight skies ablaze- turning dusk into dawn
Moonlight seas of haze- prophecy through song
Twilight skies ablaze- rain dance under starlight
Moonlight seas of haze- life begins at daylight
