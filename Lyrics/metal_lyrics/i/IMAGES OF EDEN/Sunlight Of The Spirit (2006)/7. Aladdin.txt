What is this? You've read my mind
How could you know what I was thinking?
Heart beating fast, now we're going in
I know what tonight is going to bring
Show it all off, show it off for me
Show it all off, beyond what the eye can see

Hardly believing what I'm really seeing
Now all are watching, but it's only for me
This exhibition brings submission
Visions of you, visions of two
I know what they know
Our world's surrounding you
I have what they want
They all want you now
Come play our game, take our hand

This brings us closer to forever
Hypnotically enhanced, erotic, in trance
This taste of blood you gave to me today
One I'd dream for again and relive another day
Now I'm home!

I love watching you
I love watching you
I love watching you
I love watching you
I love watching you
Show it all off, show it off for me
Show it all off, beyond what the eye can see

This brings us closer to forever
Hypnotically enhanced, erotic, in trance
This taste of blood you gave to me today
One I'd dream for again and relive another day

Here she comes, you know what I want
So stimulating, our worlds embracing
Another beautiful scene, it's so serene
Three wishes coming true for me
I know what they know
Our world's surrounding you
I have what they want
They all want you now
Come play our game, take our hand
