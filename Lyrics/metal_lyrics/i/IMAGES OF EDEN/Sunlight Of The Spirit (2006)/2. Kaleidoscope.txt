I've waited so long to dry the tears from our eyes
Shut the world out, clear my mind
I'm locked inside until the end
and closed the gate to the lion's den
From nowhere, here you are
With me, you'll travel so far

Now we are so lost inside of our own maze
of warmer nights and brighter days
We run through the garden of eternal life
under the bright moonlight
I can hear your voice
calling me not far away
Waiting for your touch
to take away the pain

Now there are no more falling tears
I prayed this day would come
Now there are no more falling tears
You were the only one

When I am miles away, I can still hear you whisper
with your smile, your embrace
Now I know you're safe and warm
Thinking about tomorrow, we dream today away
Together, here we are,
and we have traveled so far

Now there are no more falling tears
away from the world outside
Now there are no more falling tears
in our Eden where we hide
