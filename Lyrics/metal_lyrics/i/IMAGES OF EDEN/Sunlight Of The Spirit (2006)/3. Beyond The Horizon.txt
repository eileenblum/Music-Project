The early morning sky here
is bringing me a new day's light
Taking me away from yesterday
There's so much more that lies ahead for me
Now I see beyond
where the water meets the warm sky
Dreaming awake - I'm staring at the sun!

I used to believe that heaven
were the clouds in the sky
Islands for the angels to fly to
I used to dream and wonder
if there could be a better place
Nothing can touch me there, so far away
Drifting away - beyond the horizon!

Our angels are our heroes
Some say heroes never die
They're surrounding me under my warm summer sky
Guide me and protect me
Spread my wings so I can fly beyond the horizon

What were you hoping for?
What were you waiting for?
Did you think your dream would just find you
and take you away?

What were you hoping for?
What were you waiting for?
Did you think your dream would just find you
and take you away?

Don't tear yourself apart
over things out of your control
Time passes so fast, you'll wonder where your life went
Too much wasted time holding on to yesterday

What were you hoping for?
What were you waiting for?
Did you think your dream would just find you
and take you away?

What were you hoping for?
What were you waiting for?
Did you think your dream would just find you
and take you away?

The sunlight of the spirit lies beyond the horizon
