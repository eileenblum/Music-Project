Love surrounds us
Passion embraces us from all directions
Sharing our treasure in this harem of pleasure
Adrenaline rising, hearts are pounding
In a world filled with so much more than I can believe

Passionate visions turn my water into wine
Smoke blends with perfume in the air
The smell of sweat and the warm color of flesh
fills the night again and again
Now I can feel you so much closer to me

All so intoxicating in this ethereal paradise
with hungers of love and lust
In your mouth tasting many different fruits
Nothing is sacred, nothing is taboo
In a world filled with so much more than I can believe
Now I can feel you so much closer - So close to me

Once were two, many more so soon
We're just cherubs shooting arrows at the moon
I taste your fruit and you drink my wine
This way of life is so divine

This is our endless night,
filled with satin and white lace
Our endless delight
This menagerie we consummate
I know you won't pretend
this fantasy will ever end

This is our endless night
The dogma we so disbelieve
Our endless delight
in our midsummer night's dream

I know you won't pretend
this fantasy will ever end
Remember: Shakespeare is dead
You'll never see the fall again - Oh, never!
Now I know you can't pretend
this fantasy will ever end
Remember: Shakespeare is dead
and autumn will never come again
