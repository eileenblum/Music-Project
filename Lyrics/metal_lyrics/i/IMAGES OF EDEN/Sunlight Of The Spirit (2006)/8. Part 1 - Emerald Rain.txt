I remember what once was and what can't be again
It's so hard daydreaming, knowing you can't go back
I've been trying and reaching to relive our yesterdays,
but they only live within our minds

Memories of long ago never seem to wash away
Alone I feel the falling rain, dreaming of what used to be
So much older now with so much yet to come
Still I find myself remembering

Emerald rain, hear my nostalgic serenade

Life brings us change, nothing remains the same
Tomorrow brings a new while the past fades away
I still can't help holding on to what was lost,
hoping one day I'll be whole again

Emerald rain, singing the swan song of yesterday

Our world is drifting so much farther away
as we mourn the loss of our yesterdays
Now only nostalgia remains
with the return of the morning rain

All that I want, all that I had,
and all that I gave but would never take
All that I fought, all that I cried,
and all that I kept deep down inside
All that I love, all that I hate,
and all of the things I did create
All that I was, all that I am
Is it all that I will be until the end?
