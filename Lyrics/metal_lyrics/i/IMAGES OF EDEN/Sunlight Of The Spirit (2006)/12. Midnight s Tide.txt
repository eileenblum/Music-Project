Moonlight on the water, the sound of the ocean
Sitting by myself, I'm reflecting in the sand
Remembering my younger days
Now I'm back to where it all began
Everything is drifting away
throughout midnight's tide

There I first walked through Eden
under the October sky for the first time
I knew it was where I wanted to be
I knew it was where I wanted to stay
I will never forget what was born by a dream
I will never let go of what was given to me
I will never forget when I opened my eyes
to see what I was destined to be

Yesterday I returned to Eden
I saw myself as a child outside at play
With a look of content, not a care in the world
So unprepared for the darkness that would fall down upon him
I can't change the past, so why even try?
The future is drifting through midnight's tide

As a child, he was scared of tomorrow,
wasting many yesterdays being afraid
The spark of life never fueled the flame
Before long, the fire had faded away
I can't change the past, so why even try?

Here I am in Eden today
under the October sky again
Seeing myself face to face at last
Making my peace after so many years have passed

He knew who I was, but he was so scared
and so afraid of what I might say
I remember his sadness and feeling his fear
With every question, he shed so many more tears

"I can feel your pain like it was yesterday
But don't you be afraid, it will not last forever
I can tell you nothing more,
for I would change what will be
Just know that one day
all of your pain will end and you will be free..."
