"To see a world in a grain of sand
and a heaven in a wild flower,
hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
and eternity in an hour."
[William Blake]

Time stands still as I hear the cold wind sing
One last passing glimpse in a pool of falling rain
A young bird trying to fly with broken wings
Catch your dream before it slips away

No longer is this a dream
Now I'm starting to believe
that I feel my soul floating on my angel's wings
No longer will I wander
Life's too short to wander
The coming of age always comes too soon
Catch your dream before it dies today

Heaven sent a miracle
Your destiny lies in your hand
Don't let it slip away
Heaven sent the world to you
Passion lies within your soul
Don't throw it all away
Heaven sent love to you
Open your heart, don't pass it by
This could be the last time
Heaven sent life for you,
but you can't seem to find your peace of mind
You live in...

A dream from the day that you were born
Your whole life you were scared to face the storm
A dream you refuse to believe
You'll never be in heaven without going through hell

A dream from the day that you were born
Your whole life you were scared to face the storm
A dream you refuse to believe
You'll never be in heaven without going through hell

I drift away out to sea
to dream and wonder what will be
I am a mariner of my own imagination
The horizon is my destination
Since I found a new way when I awoke one day,
a seed of hope was planted in the soil of disarray

Tomorrow lies another side of life
Catch your dream before it dies tonight
