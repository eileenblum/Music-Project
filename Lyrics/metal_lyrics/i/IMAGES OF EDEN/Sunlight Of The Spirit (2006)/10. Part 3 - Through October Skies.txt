In this new day, now I'm awake for the first time,
for the first day of the rest of my life
So strong and able to move on to live again today
To live another way now with a clear mind
Yesterday was the last time before the pain had died,
but today I'm alive, with the past far behind

Through October skies, my autumn's sunrise
It's the first sight of a new light
Through my world inside, ethereal moonlight
It's the first sight of the rest of our lives

Another fiery world of yellow and red
How could I have seen it again, our beginning and our end?
Autumn, I praise your painted sky that I adore
Celestial winds filling my soul once more

Through October skies, my autumn's sunrise
It's the first sight of a new light
Through a survivor's eyes, ethereal moonlight
It's the first sight of the rest of our lives

In this new life, the darkness has turned to light
The fear has died and the strong have survived
Now after so much time, I can move on
to live again today, another way,
with the end so far away

Through October skies, my autumn's sunrise
It's the first sight of a new light
Through my world inside, ethereal moonlight
It's the first sight of the rest of our lives

Then one day you came to me
Fate waited so many years
It knew that we were ready now
The search is over now that I found your soul
This is our destiny
The rest will be history
