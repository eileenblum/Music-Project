It's been a long road
getting to where we are today
It's been a hard road,
not as easy as one might say
Living through the winter
Dawn of a new day born from spring
The end of the sorrow and cold
Now life begins again
Another day - To live another day

It's been a long time
since I've seen a brighter day
It's been a hard time,
with a new hope lighting the way
Now is this the real me,
the one I'd lost for so many years?
It seems so hard to believe
I'm alive again, now I'm home
Another day - To live another day again

It's been a long, long road back home
Such a hard, long road back home

It's been a long, lonely road back home
Such a hard, dark road back home
Such a long time did I roam
this road back home
To live another day
To live another day, I'm home again
