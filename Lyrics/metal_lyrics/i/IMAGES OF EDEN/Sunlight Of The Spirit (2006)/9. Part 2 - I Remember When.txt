I remember when
I had no worries and life was carefree
I remember when
summer lasted forever - no more
And I remember when
you were there for me, but now you're long gone
And I remember when I last saw your face,
but nothing lasts forever
Now I'm serene and I've found peace
I am whole now and ready to start again

I remember when
you cried for me and protected my heart
I remember when
life was easy, how did things fall apart?
And I remember when
nothing mattered, now everything's changing
And I remember when
I was near the end, but the end is so far away
Now I'm serene and I've found peace
I am whole now and ready to start again

Memories no one can ever take away,
even though time has changed the world around me
Memories no one can ever take away
They're not gone! No, they're not gone!

Memories no one can ever take away,
even though time has taken you from me
Memories I'll keep forever so you will live on
You're not gone! No, you'll always live on!
