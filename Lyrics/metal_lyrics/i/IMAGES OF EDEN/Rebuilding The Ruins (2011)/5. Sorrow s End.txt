She dreams of visions that come to be
She hears the voices of pending reality

Waiting for silence, the whispers so consuming
She awakens in tears, but the images remain
(Then) fade away, fade to gray, to return another day

Premonitions of our fate, so burned within her mind
To escape would change the course
Of our future and our past

She'll tear the stars from the sky and hold them in her hand
For the day when her sorrow will end
â¦ Sorrow shall end

âListen now, listen well, listen to what you fearâ¦
âListen now, listen well, listen to you cannot hearâ

The sight is changing
If I could change what is to beâ¦
Then why canât I hold you next to me?
I donât want to hear them anymoreâ¦
Please take them awayâ¦ the âvoicesâ

She'll tear the stars from the sky and hold them in her hand
But no one would understand...
â¦ Sorrow shall end

But I will never see her, never see her again
I will never hold her, never know her again
Never see her, never feel her again
I will never touch her, never love her again
