In this ethereal light we meet again
It must be forever
So welcoming but it is not my time
I must return

So many visions I see of tomorrow
What is lost is never gone
Questions we have, answers we'll find

I believe the end is never really the end
I believe this life is not the only one
I believe there is another world for me (I've been there before)
I have seen eternity

Somewhere far away angels are dreaming (waiting to see us again)
Somewhere far away angels are flying (on their way home)

I've learned all that I will know
Given all there is for me to give
I guided the way, I bore the truth
Given life back to what was gone
You gave me the world
Now the time has come for me to see you again
Now I now know where I am to go
Today God is playing God

This is goodbye but not farewell
For the end is never really "the end"
We will one day meet again
And fly together hand in hand
After the show when we take a bow
And walk away from this world,
Without a tear, regret or fight
We'll exit this grand stage we call "LIFE"

[ANGEL:]
"I watched you from the day that you were born
Now it is time to see you again
From the first emerald rain
To the embrace of our spirits
Your message there is done
Your time at last has come."

Warming light surrounding me
The astral sun is blinding my eyes
Vertigo consuming me
My soul is beginning to lift away...

I hear my angels from Heaven calling me
Ready to take me away to their islands in the sky
I once feared this moment as a child
But eternal life is before me

Here I am standing tall...
Reaching for the clouds, staring at the sky
I have spread my wings ready to fly
With my very last breath of life I cry...

"KINGDOM OF FOREVER, NOW I'M COMING HOME."
