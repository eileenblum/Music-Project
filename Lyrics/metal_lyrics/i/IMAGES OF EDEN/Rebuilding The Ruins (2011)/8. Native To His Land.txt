We shall not cease from exploration
And at the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.
[--T.S. Elliot]

Back to a place and time when I was young
In a simple world so far away
All the memories coming back to me
Made me what I am

The land I knew for so very long
I had to leave but never let go
Time has passed again here I am
Where the story began

Life had taken this world away from me
Through wiser eyes I see
Home to my new native land
But so foreign to me

Where I roam, where I cry
Where I sleep, where I will lie
Where I dream, where I survive
Where I believe, where I'm alive

This land- my native land, once upon a dream
I saw your towers standing so tall
This land- my native land, ruined remains
Fallen before me, lying at my feet

Full circle, here I stand
Once a boy, now a man
I returned to a new native land
Now I can move on

This land- my native land, once upon a dream
I saw your towers standing so tall
This land- my native land, and today I know
My time has come to let go
