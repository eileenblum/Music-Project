Meditating in the morning rain at the center of the storm
Safe and sound at the beginning of our new world
Surrounded by Earth, water and bright eternal light
Another chapter in this man-made paradise

A burning sun heals the wounds we bled for so long yesterday
Falling tears from above, cleansing the bright blue sky
Surrounded by tranquil waters leading from infinity
Savoring this moment so reborn in time

Meditating without pain...
Healing the wounds we've suffered for so long

Breathing celestial air I have drifted so far away from home
Fate has carried me away onto distant shores
I cannot foresee what the future will bring for me
Time will tell, for now God only knows

Meditating without pain...
Healing the wounds we've suffered for so long
And today... comes the rain
Sailing through oceans of lifelong memories

Holding on with no will to fight
Tomorrow is just a dream away
Praying for that guiding light (no will to fight)
Rising above and to lift them away
Human angels, reflections from beyond
Bringing new life to those long gone

Remember, you are never alone
I am here to carry you when you fall
For we have seen the errors in our ways
Rewarded with tomorrow and another day

Meditating without pain...
Healing the wounds we've carried so long
And again... comes the rain
Sailing through oceans of lifelong memories

Forever is just a dream away, butâ¦
...the dream is still alive
