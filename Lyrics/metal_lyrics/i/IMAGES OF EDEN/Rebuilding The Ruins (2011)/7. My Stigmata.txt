You cry my wounds, I bleed your tears
Thorns in my soul, wearing your crown for years
You are my brightest night, I am your darkest day
We are tomorrow, bonded by blood today

I am the only one that you have seen, that you believe in
You are the only one- I let you see inside my dreams
We have nothing to grieve

You see me how I wanted you to see
And youâve become what I intended you to be
We are so different yet one in the same
But I never wrote the rules to this game

You are the only one- I let you see what I can conceive...
In the end we stand alone and you still choose to believe
We have the only means to shine our light and rid the disease
In a dying world we are the holy trinity

If I would ever let go, would you still believe?

Now I am wearing the crown of thorns so invisible to me
I bleed the wounds from my hands and feet for you
Open every day of my life

My stigmata... wounds I've never bled, scars of humility that yearn
My stigmata... chasing the dragon, just to watch him burn
My stigmata... tears I've never shed, cries of serenity have won
My stigmata... trinity blood red, another hero unsung.

[VOICE OF MAN:]
"Help me to remember... to find the place that I once knew
Renew my hope, mend my faith
I see myself in you as I see you so much in me
My wounds are so open, my soul filled with uncertainty

When will I bear my cross or is that something I haven't deserved?
Humility so subdued- my imperfections show through
It seems the day has come for you to carry me once again
Now one set of footprints now appear in the sand."

[VOICE OF âANGELâ:]
"I have carried you in times when you knew not what to do
I have watched you from the day when you first opened your eyes
I let you make mistakes, learn so you would grow
I will carry you once again, for your one last lesson learned

It will not be long before I see you again
It will not be long before you will carry another
Now return to the place you once knew
Today there are 2 sets of footprints in the sand
Welcome home again..."

[MAN:] "Iâm so afraidâ¦ I canât carry on.â
[ANGEL:] âI will be here to guide you until the end.â
[MAN:] "But why must I hold the weight of the world?â
[ANGEL:] âSoon you will know, so never give in.â
[MAN:] "My heart is with you.â
[ANGEL:] âAnd mine is with you.â
[MAN:] âAll of my dreams and all that Iâve seen shall become what I am soon to be.â
[ANGEL:] âHold onto me my child, and never let go.â
[MAN:] "We are one."
[BOTH VOICES:] "We are one in the same"
