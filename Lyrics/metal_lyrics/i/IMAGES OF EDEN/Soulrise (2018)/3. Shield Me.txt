Release your tears, I'm a soldier sent to shield you
I watch over you more than you will ever know
Now purge all your fear â
Your own weapons fight against you
Let me be your guide

So broken and afraid
How will I spread my wings again?

Silence and blind the whispers to all fade and die
If I fight the wars for you they will never end
Ignore all the lies, all the warfare from inside
Quiet your mind

Shield me inside so I can breathe new life
A 'stargazer' in my own mind
Shield me with an early, warm falling rain
Walk through the door I open for you
I'll light the way

Now here on your wall tall I stand
Cross over heart, tomorrow in my hand
For I will shroud you and suffer your pain
And heal your broken heart

Shield me inside onto a distant land
Rebuild my temple from a grain of sand
Shield me with a midnight falling rain
A new dawn is waiting for youâ¦
"Morningâ¦ Rise!"

Shield me inside before I say goodbye
Guiding the way with a final sign
Shield me with another warm falling rain
Now the war is over for you
Go and light the way
