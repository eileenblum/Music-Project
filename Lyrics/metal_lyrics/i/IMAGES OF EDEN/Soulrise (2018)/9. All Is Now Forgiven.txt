All is not yet forgiven

Why can't I ever seem to let go?
Still I'm holding on
And why does a part of me die when I have to say goodbye?
Reflecting on fond memories of what you've left behind
Please show me what I must do today

One day soon not far from now you will learn my truth
The world below is your shine stage in this short play of 'life'
From behind the curtain we watch and wait

But all is not forgiven

Do not waste your tears in mourning anymore
For this is a part of your life that you must endure
Self-destruction and apathy will never mend your wounds
But I can only help you now

No, it was not your time to go
But I will never lose my faith
No, it was not your time to go
I need you to help me heal
I can't do it on my own
No, it was not your time to go
So until we meet again?
I will see you soon again my friend
Until then, I must say goodbye
You will see signs and gifts left behind
So know they will always be with you

All is now forgiven

No, it was not your time to go
So until we meet again
