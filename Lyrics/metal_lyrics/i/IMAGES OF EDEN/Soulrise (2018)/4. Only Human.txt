I'll never let you suffer, I will be right there to heal you
And when you cry, I am by your side to dry your eyes
When you are alone, listen closely for my voice
And then there will be nothing left to fear

I can fell so much change in me now
Heaviness is fading from my heart

I know I cannot change the world
But I can change the way I live today
I never want to forget where I came from
So remember now â you're only human

I will let you fall so I can mend and rebuild you
But when you fail, I retest you then progress you
Just open your mind to what I am teaching you
Then I promise never to let go
Remember to forgive yourself
I have already forgiven you

I know I cannot change the world
But I can change the way I live today
I never want to forget where I came from
So remember now â you're only human

Your world that I made
Came with a price to be paid
You are the light of me young man
You will never be the same

Carry me today
Let me breather you in so deep
I am only a breath away

I know I cannot change the world
But I can change the way I live today
I never want to forget where I came from
So remember now â you're only human
I know I cannot save the world
But I am only human
You're only human
For I have written, so it will be done
A kaleidoscope of beauty will fill your life
So remember now â you're only human
