My heart, it bleeds now for all that I've lost
I thought I was the only one left in my life
Alone I lie waiting for you to bring me home
So please show me a sign

Why do I cry whenever I pray?
How can I smile when I think of yesterday?
Maybe because I know deep down in my soul
You can hear me and always by my side

Memories are everything to me now
But I can still feel you here protecting me

Dear God, please send us your Son
I know you can see what your world has become
Sorrow still remains with so much to be done

And then there was one!
And then there was one? No!

God grant me serenity that I once had
And all the wisdom that I gave away
You gave me the strength to carry the weights
Of those who cannot carry their own

And then there was one? No!

Dear God, please send us your Son
I know you can see what your world has become
Sorrow still remains with so much to be done

And then there was one!
And then there was one? No!

I can feel you so close
I can hear the sound of your voice
(Angel)
"Don't be afraid!
I have been sent here to bring you home."

Once you were so afraid, waiting for the sky to fall
Now gaze down at the sand, at the footprints that surround you

Look beside and find familiar sets of two
And look before you, far ahead, and adore
Standing all around you as I open the gates
Welcoming you into eternity
Are all your loyal sets of four
