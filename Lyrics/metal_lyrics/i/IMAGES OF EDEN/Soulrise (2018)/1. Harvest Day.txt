In this self-made prison I'm dyingâ¦
God help me!

My days of "life" have faded into distant memories
Resurrect my youth, I have been holding on
In Your light I pray to wash away the shame
Bleed my sorrow or take my soul today

I'm falling, drowning in tragedy
When will peace be returned to me?

In your soil of life I planted seeds of tomorrow
For all my light will bloom and purge your sorrow
When you are wise enough to accept the truth
I will bring you back all of your youth

"Rain, come again
Fall upon my son today and bring him new life"
Harvest day â dry your tears
And walk in my daylight again

Harvest day?
Could this really be the end of my disarray?
Harvest day
Another chapter of you has been written today

Harvest day?
Could this really be the end of my disarray?
Harvest day
Another chapter of you will be done

"Rain, come again
Fall upon my son today and bring him new life"
Harvest day â dry your tears
And walk in my daylight again

Today the sorrow shall end
The sun is searing through
Life has returned to you
