Far above the morning desert sands below you
And beyond the Indian-painted sun that rises above
Is a light that shines upon you and guides you through the night
Leading the way with my lunar light

This is only a glimpse of what you can expect to see
Bu not right away
You still need time to grow

Moonrise â let your light guide the way home
Don't mourn the day the dream will die
Chase your horizons in the "once" upon a time

Step outside your mind
Let you soul guide you
For it already knows the way home, remember?
For you will reveal
Upon the shoulders of giants stands a man

Before me lies an autumn Mayan sky
Where I watched you smiling down
Shrouding me with the beauty of your world

Dreams at peace at the horizon
And remember what brought you here
Now open your eyes you're not dreaming
I have returned you home

Step outside your mind
Let your soul guide you
For you have revealed
Upon the shoulders of giants stands a man

"Moon â Rise!"

Moonrise â let your light guide the way home
Don't mourn the day the dream will die
Chase your horizons in thisâ¦
Moonrise â I will mend your wings so you can fly
To where my earthly angels shine
Chase your horizons in the "twice" upon a time

Open your eyes
You're not dreaming
