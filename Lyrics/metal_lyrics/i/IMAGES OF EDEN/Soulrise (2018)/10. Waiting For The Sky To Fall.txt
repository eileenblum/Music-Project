Distant skies of warm sunlight rise
Peering through this second morning rain
Your first sign of life after so many tears
Be still and listen for what you cannot "hear"

Don't let me live in fear of tomorrow
Or drown in a sea of haunting memories

Now open you heart
Don't burden your soul with what will go wrong
But how long before I die?
Embrace your life
The sun will still rise
While you're waiting for the sky to fall

Peel away the mask that I wore for years
That hid all of my secrets, hope and fears
Bring me hope in tomorrow, and what lies ahead
You've awakened my soul- I'll be your voice

Don't let me live in fear of tomorrow
Or drown in a sea of haunting memories

Now open your heart
Don't burden your soul with what will go wrong
But how long before I die?
Embrace your life
The sun will rise after all
So once and for all
Stop waiting for the sky to fall

Heal me, release me
Scars still remain but
Nothing can bring back the shame
Shroud me, absolve me
A new hope begins today
Just a promise away

Now open y our heart
Don't burden your soul with what will go wrong
But how long before I die?
Embrace your life
The sun will rise after all
So once and for all
Stop waiting for the sky to fall

You were waiting
Waiting
You were waiting
So once and for all
Stop waiting for the sky to fall
