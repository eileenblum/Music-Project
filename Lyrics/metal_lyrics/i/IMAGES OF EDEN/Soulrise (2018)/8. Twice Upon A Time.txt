Once dead and soulless, I was so alone
And broken until you saved me
On the day I needed you the most
At the edge of my oblivion
But you sent them to me on my darkest day

Can you see and hear what is left of me?
Dead or alive, reunite me!

By you they carry me beyond my internal wars
Of emptiness and despair
Trusting me with their lives in my hands
Don't ever bury your head in the sand

Can you see and hear what is left of me?
Dead or alive, reunite me!
Shield me from this fear that is killing me!
End this lie and this tragedy now!

Twice upon a time
Once out of reach, now in the palm of your hand
Twice upon a time in Heaven as it was on Earth
Alive, strong and unbroken

Twice upon a time
Once out of reach, now in the palm of your hand
Twice upon a time in Heaven as it was on Earth
Once upon a time â distance can't divide you and me
Twice upon a time â distance can't divide, you will see

(The Enemy)
"Stare into my barrel
There is no one to save you
I will corrupt you â body, mind and soul
Your prayers will never be heard
Your 'god' has forsaken you"

No!

By my wounds you have been redeemed
My blood has been shed for you
Remember, the snake will always lie
He has no authority, resist!

Now you will smile again
When the mourning is gone
And I will heal your broken heart
And bring them back into your arms

You will love them again
Another time in a better world
Where your hearts will be filled with life
Twice upon a time
