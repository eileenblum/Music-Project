Shroud me from my despair
In a time when I should have the world at my feet
Some 'angels' cry when given their wings too soon in life
Remember to kiss the ones you love goodnight

Release your weight
I'll never let you give up today

Now I've seen Heaven on Earth
I've kissed the face of hell and lived to tell
I know you're with me always until the end
When heaven opens for me just let me die young
Let me die young

So lost inside this tangled web of life
Breaking daylight much too late
This lonely silence is deafening
Re-thread the strand and set your soul free

Release the blame
For I am a better way
And can ease your pain

Now I've seen Heaven on Earth
I've kissed the face of hell and lived to tell
I know you're with me always until the end
When heaven opens for me just let me die young
Let me die young

At the edge of another revolution?
This I will not say
How much longer until our oblivion?
I will pull you home before that day
And you should know you will be OK

Now I've seen Heaven on Earth
I've kissed the face of hell and lived to tell
I know you're with me always until the end
Heaven is open for me now
Let me die young
Let me die young

Let me die young
Let me die young
Let me die young
