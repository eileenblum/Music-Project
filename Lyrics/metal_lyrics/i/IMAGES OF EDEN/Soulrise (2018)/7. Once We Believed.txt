I still try to smile but you would never let me learn to fly
Or change the way I view the world
How can I believe that my dawn will come
When I've fallen so hard today?

Please bring me a change
Or take me home today
I don't know what else I can do
So I surrender once and for all

I have been waiting for you

Now you will grow so very strong
And know that one day you will become everything you want to be
You never thought that you would ever see the day
Where I would be guiding you
Providing your way

No, the tears you cry are not your own
In solitude you are never alone

Spread you wings for the world to see
All chains are broken
Once you believe in me

I can feel you opening your world to me
Today your nightmares become sweet dreams
Nothing will ever stay the same
You prayed for a change to come and take you away
Time is never kind but faith is always on your side

Will we ever stop to bask
In what we've done with our lives
And what we have become?
Tell me â what have I become?
Tell me â what will we ever become?

Spread your wings for the world to see
All chains are broken
Once you believe in me
Fly now life begins anew
Our world has been opened
Once we believed in you
