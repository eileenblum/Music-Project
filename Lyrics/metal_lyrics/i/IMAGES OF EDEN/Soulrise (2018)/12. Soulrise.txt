[Part I â Coming home]

All my life I never believed
That peace would feel surreal
On my last day when all would become so real

Bring me back to where I was "born"
To the world I knew
Long before I became who I "am"

Far above stormy clouds we watch the rain
Falling from beneath our feet from Heaven
Where I watch you sleep

Prepare to leave this world behind
Quiet your heart and listen closely for a sign

Far above stormy clouds we watch the rain
Falling from beneath our feet from heaven
Where I watch you sleep

Heaven never sleeps
Here we will watch the rain fall

Far above stormy clouds we watch the rain
Falling from beneath our feet from Heaven
Where I watch you sleep

Heaven never sleeps
Here we will watch the rain fall

Far above stormy clouds we watch the rain
Falling from beneath our feet from heaven
Where I watch you sleep

Soon your soul will rise â rise today
On angel wings you will fly â fly away

[Part II â Beyond the Firmament]

Dream now as I lay you down to sleep
Rest your eyes and feel my peace
Rise now and be release
My angels are bringing you home to me

Let your soul rise
Your longing is over
I will deliver you back to me
To my ivory towers

Let your soul rise
Above the earth, moon, sun and sky
Beyond the firmament you will flyâ¦
Soon it will be done
Let my soul rise

[Part III â Welcome Home]

Now I know nothing lost is ever gone
And nothing gone is ever lost forever
Allow yourselves to heal for I have said
Life and love will never end

Above the earth, moon, sun, and sky
I had seen miracles before my very eyes
Because of you today I will finally have my wings
I've waited so long
You spared me the time to say my goodbyes
And now I will close my eyesâ¦

Riseâ¦
Soul rise
Soul rise, soulâ¦
Let your soul rise, soul rise, soulâ¦
Let your soul rise, soul rise, soulâ¦
Let your soul rise, soul rise, soulâ¦

I have opened the gates for you my son
And I have prepared a place for you
Welcome home!
