Why do so many fear your name?
They're bearing guilt for what they disbelieve
But you were never taught how to love or to have faith
I can help you find the way

So many times in life where science has failed you
Playing God with your emotions
Trying to deceive you by hiding me and my word
Oh, but what can I do?

Break the bread of life still unbroken
I'm godless!
Godless!

Rise above deception
With the words I have given you
For I am losing my creation
Show the world my love
For they only divide and hate

Godless?
Godless!

I will show you your dreams
That you never know you had
Then bring them to life before your very eyes
If you would only let me try

OK, so why do so many kill in your name?
They are fueled by greed and misdirection
Their contradictions bastardize my words every day
I know why you turned the other way

Rise above deception
With the words I have given you
For I am losing my creation
Show the world my love
For they only divide and hateâ¦ the world

I do believe this is from Heaven!
It's not too late
You can make a difference
But you're running out of time

Godless?
