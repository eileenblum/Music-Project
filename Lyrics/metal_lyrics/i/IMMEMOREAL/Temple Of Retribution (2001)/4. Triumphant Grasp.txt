[Music: Blash / Lyrics: Blash]
[tabulature sheet]

[VERSE ONE:]
I hold the upper hand
In my triumphant grasp
Driven by hatred, driven to conquer
Unite myself to victory

[VERSE TWO:]
I am the past, here again
Enlighted by wisdom, enormous powers
Marching for victory...
This domain, eternally mine

[CHORUS:]
I'm now bound and schackled here
But, forever enhanced and I received damnation...
I felt strong

[Repeat verse one]

[VERSE THREE:]
Through a shadow, with a spell
A curse of the dead
The waiting is gone
There is no more
