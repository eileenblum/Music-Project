[Music: Wouthan / Lyrics: Hedlund]
[tabulature sheet]

[VERSE ONE:]

Down the walls
Nightmare comes crawling
A disease that will poison your mind
Lights, a colourful serenade before your eyes

[CHORUS ONE:]

Lurking beneath, now released are all the powers
...Black and reality based

[CHORUS TWO:]

Wake up in a sweat and realize that the world is here to stay
That reality is a suburb to hell

[Repeat all]
