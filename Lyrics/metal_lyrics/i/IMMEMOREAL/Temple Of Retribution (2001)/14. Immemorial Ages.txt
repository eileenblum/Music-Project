[Music: Grendel / Lyrics: Wouthan]

[VERSE ONE:]

When darkclad clouds hide the moon
The stars shine no longer certain
If light don
The darkness is no longer in slumber

[VERSE TWO:]

Words from immemorial ages reveal
The beast is not a beast nor a devil
Called forth from the demongate
Reminants of the spell

[VERSE THREE:]

Those abandoned lands we claim
When storms of our sworms rushes forth
Failure is weak breed of human flesh
The victory never exalts in a heaven

[CHORUS:]

Ancestral marks and the fatherlands sun
Burns in the eye to the servants of Jesus
Flood will again cleans the earth
Child of religion, to myth descends

[Repeat verse three]

[Repeat verse one]

[Repeat verse two]

Human spirit!
