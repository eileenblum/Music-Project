[Music: Blash , Grendel / Lyrics: Blash]

[VERSE ONE:]

Totally unclear, a vision descent
Overvelming dark, black shadows rise
Forgotten in decades, finally risen
The sin, the call, Asmodeus

[Repeat verse one backwards]

[CHORUS ONE:]

Now the abyss arise
Light vision and denied
To the ending one
Black eternal night

[x2]

[CHORUS TWO:]

I was sent out
For a war, to endify
The spirit under, the growing old
In dark, we summon again

[Repeat verse one x2]
