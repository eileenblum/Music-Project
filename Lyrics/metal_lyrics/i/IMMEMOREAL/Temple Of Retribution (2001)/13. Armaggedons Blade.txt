[Music: Grendel / Lyrics: Wouthan]

[VERSE ONE:]

Far from the nights of winter
Far from the palace of god
Clash of the unbound spirits
Oh, dark and proud they are
I behold the cursed ones
I behold the angered eyes
Emblem of retribution
Vision of abomination

Armageddons Blade!

[CHORUS ONE:]

I stand before a horizon
A horizon from blood to blood
I stand before a horizon
With fire from Satans realms

[VERSE TWO:]

A chalice with boiling blood
A chalice with heavens blood
A call for the ancients spirits
Spawn of purity
Countless years, decades of filth
Waiting for this god dethrone

[CHORUS TWO:]

Unfold by a source of thunder
Revealed from the face of the earth
Swords were sprung, spawned as one
A blade of armageddon I saw

[Repeat first two lines in verse one x3]

Armageddons Blade!

[Repeat chorus one]
