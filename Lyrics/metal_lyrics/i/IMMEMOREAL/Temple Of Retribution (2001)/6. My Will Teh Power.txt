[Music: Wouthan / Lyrics: Wouthan]

[VERSE ONE:]

I am the servant
Preacher of black
I am the - Son of fire

[VERSE TWO:]

Summon Leviathan
Deep and from shore
Dethrone Jehovah
And end their fucking god

[VERSE THREE:]

Violation - Give the sign
Evolution - The final key

[CHORUS ONE:]

Hailing the victory - In our serpents lands
No more blood from war - In our warriors hands

My will to power!

[CHORUS TWO:]

Praise the new king - Infernal majestys son
The universe is his crown - Our time has come

[VERSE FOUR:]

I
Preacher of black
i am the - King of fire

[CHORUS THREE:]

Unified - Darkside - Glorified
Summon me!

[CHORUS FOUR:]

Holy words no more shed
The liar is finally dead

My will to power!
