[Music: Wouthan / Lyrics: Hedlund]

[VERSE:]

Reinvoke the great days of Sodom
Nail the virginborn to the cross
Make him suffer for the sins he commited
Who are you to judge and condemn?
Reinvoke the great days of Sodom
Nail the virginborn to the cross

[CHORUS ONE:]

Nothing, you're nothing to me
I can see right through your facade
Blind lunatic open your eyes
And maybe you will see...

[x2]

[CHORUS TWO:]

Spread fear into the hearts of all deniers
Release the sinners through a single kiss
Spread fear into the hearts of all deniers
Release the rage, exterminate!

[Repeat verse]
