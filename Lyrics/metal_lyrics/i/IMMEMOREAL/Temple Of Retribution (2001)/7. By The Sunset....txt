[Music: Grendel / Lyrics: Hedlund]

[VERSE ONE:]

Spawned forth by souls damnated
Through sparkling flames,
A furious purgatory

[VERSE TWO:]

Divine I am
Sevenfold wisdom in the shape of a fool
That lost track of time, and sphere...

[CHORUS:]

A cold eternal embrace in which I drown
For the truly wise is he who claims not to be

[x2]

[Repeat verse one]

[Repeat verse two]
