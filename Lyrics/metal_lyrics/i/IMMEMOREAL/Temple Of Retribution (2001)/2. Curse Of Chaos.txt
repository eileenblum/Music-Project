[Music: Blash, Grendel / Lyrics: Blash]

[VERSE:]

You can't imagine this
A serenade for the immortal
Your think you can weep openly
Rearrange this and follow me

[CHORUS ONE:]

Wait for completion
Beneath the existence

[CHORUS TWO:]

Behold my throne
Follow me, uncontrolled one

[Repeat verse]

Curse of chaos!

[CHORUS THREE:]

Now you serve this forever
Unholy prophecy

[CHORUS FOUR:]

I am the beast
So strong and yet so ripe
