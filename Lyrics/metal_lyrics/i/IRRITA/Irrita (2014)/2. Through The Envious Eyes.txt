[Guest solo by Ilya Kuzubov]From far beyond the earth they watched
With greed and envy for our prosperous planet
Their dying world is not of use no more
So they have turned their gaze to us

Tripods

Deadly machines are rising from the craters
Staring calmly with their metallic eyes

Fire bursts from their manipulators
Death spreads when they start to walk

Tripedal madness evaporizes mankind
Black gas floods the cities
Red grass grows on the ashes of the world
Rises a new empire
And all the kings men cannot offend the tripods
