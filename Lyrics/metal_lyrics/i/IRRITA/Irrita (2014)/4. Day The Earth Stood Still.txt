Ancient race of life constructors planted the seeds on our planet
We are descendants of the spores of life
We dominate our world
We pollute our home planet
We destruct other life
We are pests

The decision is simple â we are failed project
Our creator should descend and put the life to its end
We have proved our value
We are not of use no more
We have failed our creator
We are to be erased

Scream for your lives
The end has arrived
Our world will survive
But humanity should not be revived

This day, when the earth stood still, wonât be forgotten
The data will be stored in archives
Between millions of condemnation files
But we will not see it

We die
