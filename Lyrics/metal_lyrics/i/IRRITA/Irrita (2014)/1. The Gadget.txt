Pull the trigger of the nuclear gun

Release the tension
Fill the sky with death coming to take everything
Pyrrhic victory in a final war of human race
Pure some gasoline in a cold war
Match the fire with your fear

Chain reaction initiated
Billions of souls will roam through the glass deserts

Nuclear suicide of entire planet
The colossus falls into the abyss

The apogee of soul degeneration
Destination is approached
The very end of a failed creation
Everything burns in a hellfire
