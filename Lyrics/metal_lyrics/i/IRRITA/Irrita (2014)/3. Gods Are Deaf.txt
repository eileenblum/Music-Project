[Guest solo by Sergey Golovin]The tide is rising
I can see it from where I stand
The waves are crushing the shore, each time getting closer
I can already fell the splatter on my face
No time to run
Thereâs only time to pray

The great water flows
To wash the back of dying monster
The liquid violent prodigy is coming
I pray the elder gods to save me

Watch the tide thatâs rising above the earth
Elements switched places
Nothing is gonna settle down

The tide is rising above our heads
Over horizon comes the tidal wave

The great water flows
To wash the back of dying monster
The liquid violent prodigy is coming
I pray the elder gods to save me

The elder gods remain silent
No matter how loud I scream for them to save the planet
From the rising of the great old one that comes to rule
On the ruins of our world heâll be the god
Everlasting king over the remains of men
All living hails the return of the great old one
