It sit near a screen
In a world wound web
As a unconsciousness slave
With an animal inside

He thought he would
But his mind - was weak
The World guides him -
And become the virtual

For moral ugly - jester dance life
For ruling kings - newone slave invite

Said it is generation
For our life beneath
But its deeper, keep and lie
In cybernetic mind inside

She needs for true information
He's giving everything
It gives him phase due
Oh, in animal status
