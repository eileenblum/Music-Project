In Suomi's lands, on the glades of Kalevala
Where the dark waters of Tuonela flows
Where great legends and heroes lived
Where coniferous woods of Tapiola spread

Inpassable forests of Tapiola
Where hidden wisdom of centuries
Amaze by beauty and antiquity
Take me into your embraces

Neither largest
Also nor smallest:
Your length and width is bigger
Bigger than all I've ever seen before
