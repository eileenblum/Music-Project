Whom does it care: my destiny and me?
Whom does it care: what do I need?

Who told that I'm handsome, clever, and a person?
You made a mistake - it's all not logically
What can you found in me, fools?
To my years, I'm older then all of you!

No sorry
Don't lie me
Leave me alone
I'm got used to be alone

[Chorus:]
My elder brother told, I'm child,
I live in my own world of illusions,
I need to break off with music
And I have to work... my world was splited

Hey! Does He care: my destiny and me?
Hey! Does He care: what do I need?

He showed me the reality
And should it be my life?
I dont' want such perspectives
And I've decided to finish with that life

No sorry
Don't lie me
Leave me alone
I'm got used to be alone
