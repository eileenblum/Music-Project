My inner freedom giving me pleasure
I don't need to believe in any god
Phatalism and sceptism are not for me
So, you came in the wrong place

Time to time I'm introvert
I don't care about others lives...
You'll ask: "Am I senseless?"
But answer I cannot say to you...

[Bridge:]
And I don't care, I believe in my own
I feel my power day by day
And all of it because of you...

[Chorus:]
Inner comfort in my mind
Black line changes other line
Here is the minus, or here is the plus
State is changing very fast

I believe that you all tired
With your life from 8 to 5
Time to know what will be than...

If our world was not so cruel...
If your love was not so true...
I might split and kill myself
If I have some power left, with me.
