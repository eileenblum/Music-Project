I'm cutting by glass, my frozen hands
Scarlet blood blowing up my brains
Organs' movement I'm feeling inside
As if embryo of all filths
Is going to leave my body and body to safe
All, that I couldn't made in their presence...

[Bridge:]
Desires accumulated
Power of longing is on the limit
As lava eruption
Volcano is wailing
Than beyond my mind
Energy in hurry to come outside
Spill your evidence and have a glass of red wine

[Chorus:]
Ha! It's only a limit percent of all creatures
Called human beings
Can live as they want, with principle:
Do what thou wilt
And your mind is Fucking wild!

Do you remember these sounds
And perfume and torments
Of dying bride which shouting
Of pain, of weakness and delight
Everything I remember this moment
Oh, how sweet was this scream
And this taste and this power over the world
Do you remember feast that we ruled

You try to test everything
Find out all charms of animal existence
Be the same for what you was born
Small human being!
