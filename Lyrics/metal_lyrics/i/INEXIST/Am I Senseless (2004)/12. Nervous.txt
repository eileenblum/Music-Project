How irritable can be people
Silly seemed to me their speeches
The more meeting in these minutes
The more you fill with malice
(than becomes nervous break off)

I damn all everywhere, ready to breakloose on to anyone
Dirty beggar or rich stout
Don't get under my hand, for god's sake
(time to time) I'm nervous man

[Chorus:]
I'm nervous, I'm tired of you
Get out of my head, primitive race
Don't say, don't ask, don't blame me now
I'm sick of it all

All nervous cells are almost dead, in my boby
That's why I often can loose my temper
And don't forget, sons of bitches,
I live only for myself!

Streams of irritables can be extinguished,
When you know how to relax,
In a silence, alone, in soul's depth,
Bury the malice for a while...
