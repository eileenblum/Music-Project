You are young, but very stupid
You're theft and cheater and scoundrel
You're very lazy and garrulous
I wish to kill you when you're drunk

(And you fat bastard, why do you lie me everytime?
You can only say(words)and nothing then...
You want so much, but
But you have done nothing for it...)

Sometimes you are opstimate
And you reached nothing for yourown
What will be then? Make your question!
Without me, it will be end...!

What a hell are we together?
You are nothing without me at all!
By turns you made me angry,
Despise and hate and offence!!!

[Chorus:]
So much more that I can taste
Do you see tears on my face?
(this is) a result of my ego
What nonsense between us all
(But we still)kickin asses in a hall
this is my life

Who am I? I wish to know
What think you all about me
I think I'm ideal
But I'm sure, for them I'm worse at all

(In such days, always want to get away
And don't want to meet noone)
Go to hell, I wash my hands
I wish to much to get away... now...
