Did always pain unpleasant for us?
Maybe there's other feelings causing pain?

Soul pain caused by love to you, people
And those for whom you feel pity or remorse
This one is mostly powerful and hard to break

[Bridge:]
But most cool kind of pain is physical
Which gives you enjoyment -
- Anything remind? If not-
- "Your psycho condition is well"
Desicion of the ordinary (person)

[Chorus:]
To tell the truth
We need sometimes to explode ourselves
While breaking existing (human) principles
And fuck them all off!!!
Only this way you can feel as a true free man

Physical pain is different
Your organism can be infected
In the begining you don't pay attention
Than when it grows, you're filling with fear
(But pain is still growing)
You get used to it
And than humility

This pain and enjoyment
You can get in fight with best friend
Beating your faces, for ex., to asphalt
