Not flock of ravens flew together
On piles of decaying bones
At night at circle of fire
Some killers gathered
How many clothes and faces
From churches and prisons
They gathered for great war

Here is one aim for all of them
They live without power and laws
Between them man, who fugitive
From coast of island of death
He brought a pain and misery
You can hear it.

Danger, blood, depravity, fraud is-
Ties essence of terrible family
With cold soul, He
Went through all degrees of evil
He slaughtered
Widow with small child
He don't forgive, he don't regret
Whom make murder happy?
Answer me!
