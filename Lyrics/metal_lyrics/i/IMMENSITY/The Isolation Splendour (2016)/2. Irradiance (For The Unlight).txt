Last embrace of a dying sun
Falls from grace in the frozen void
Mornings broken in daylight strife
Worlds unspoken as light declines
Darkness as a mist of day
Descending into sea of gray
Endless winterâs eternal cold
Seasons wither as night obscured

Under irradiance of stars
A dying fire from within
And for my tears i weep unborn
In the womb of infinity
In a mourning afterglow
A fallen afterglow
In a radiant unlight
A fallen afterglow
In irradiance

A mourning afterglow
(A mourning afterglow)
A falling afterglow
(A fallen Afterglow)
In irradiance

Hollow is the earth
A universe in sorrow
Cries of the unheard
Swallowing the earth
A universe of sorrows
Cries unheard

Last embrace in the rays of sun
Fall of grace in a lifeless world
Dawn is broken and daylight's torn
Worlds unspoken and night is all

Under irradiance of stars
I long their fire from within
And for my tears i weep unborn
In the womb of infinity
In a mourning afterglow

Mourn... Mourn... Mourn
