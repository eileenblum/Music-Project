In the veil of silence I can hear your mourning heart
Fading away
And on the edge of darkness I can feel your open scars
Mending away

The days of mourning reach the end
When sorrow brings despair
And wounds unhealing
Hopes and dreams are left forlorn
Shattered longing dawn
And days redeeming

Light embraces earth and sky
When shadows of denial
Are disappearing
Tears from thorns will fall like rain
Erase away the names
Of pain unhearing

Binded by the sores of disarray
Inherit from the pain to cast from stone
I will not fear
This dreadful end
Deeper hurt the thorns on wreckage limbs
Crimson is the river drowns my dreams

On blissful shore
Of silence adorned
Unbroken waves
So violent and frail yearn for light
Yearn for light
Yearn for light
Yearning for light

Remembrance days are seething from pain
Dark memories fade
Now withered and torn
Withered and torn

In the veil of silence I can hear your mourning heart
Fading away
And on the edge of darkness I can feel your open scars
Mending away

Our days in mourning reach to end
The sorrow and despair
Our wounds are healing
Faith and hope will die as last
Buried in the past
Of memories bleeding

Light embraces earth and sky
When shadows of denial
Are disappearing
Tears from thorns will fall like rain
Eradicate the name of pain of memories bleeding
Memories bleeding
