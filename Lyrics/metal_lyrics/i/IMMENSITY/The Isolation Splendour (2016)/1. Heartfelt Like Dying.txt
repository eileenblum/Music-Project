Darkness in rainbows
Enchantment bleeds
Heartfelt like dying
For the absent sun we grieve

We fall like the rain
On a windowpane
Seeming dead to the world
We seep through the walls
Of a buried dream
Worlds apart the seams
We mourn for the sun
And the fallen ones
In downward grace

Autumns gathering
In a circle unraveling
A winter's offering
Endless circles we're wandering

Autumns gathering
A winter's offering

In the harm of winter thorns
Empty hearts drain in the snow
Like dying

As time stands still we fall
With every leaf that withered
In every quiet call
A whisper on the wind

Whispers on the wind
A whisper, an innuendo of the wind

Face a wounded sky
Blemished the pale moon declines
An innocence frail
Cloaked with dagger
Shrouded in betrayal
Our divinity is thrown
With broken arms
This mortal coil
In our last embrace

In the harm of winter thorns
Wounded heart drained in the snow
And dying

As time stands still we fall
With every leaf that withered
In every quiet word
Our whisper on the wind

Whispers on the wind
Whispers of the wind
