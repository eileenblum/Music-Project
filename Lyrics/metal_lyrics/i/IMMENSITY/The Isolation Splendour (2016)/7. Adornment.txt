Awaiting dawn silent and forlorn
Caressed by dreams silent as she sleeps

Awake at dawn silence comes alone
On withered trees whispered in the breeze

The fear of infinity fallen unto me
Resembles of broken sky
Falling unto me

Awaken on the edge
Waking on the edge of dawn
As beauty falls like light
Enraptured on a fragile wing

Echoes, fade, in voices, dreaming awake
Eternal, weaving, in silence, the solitude

Behind the veil blooms light
Under an endless gray
Touched by the soothing rain
Allure the swans they dive
In crystal water sleep
And drift away with night
They dream away the night

The feel of serenity breathing unto me
A lament from an orphan sky
Calling unto me

Awaken on the edge
Wading through the edge of dawn
This beauty falls like light
Enraptured on a fragile wing

Echoes, fading, in voices when she awakes
Eternal, weaving, in silence in solitude
Before the veil illumes as light
Under an endless gray
Touched by the warming rain
Allure the swans they die
She sleeps alone with stars
Adorned in velvet dreams
Under the fall of rain

Her silent solitude
Under the fall of rain
