All is but a dream
Our silence
In atonement sleeps
Breathes the vacant air
In drowning aspiration
All we ever wished
In our final moment is bliss

Through the thick and thin
Beyond the pale
We walk the endless
Miles away
Like empty shells
We're cast away
Streams moving wayward
We fall astray
And fall like waves

We turn away never to believe again
Without a trace ever to relieve againâ¦ever again

A motion from the deep
In solace we forever sleep
Calling on the waves the ocean speaks
Motions from the deep
In solace we forever sleep
Calling on the waves
The ocean speaks

The great divide
In oceans resides
Caved in these walls we dwell
Our vision declines
Deep in the dire
Lost in the seeming devoid

Through the thick and thin
We're cast way
Like empty shells
We fall astray
And fall like waves

We turn away never to retrieve again
Without a trace never to be seen againâ¦never again

A motion from the deep
In solace we forever sleep
Calling on the waves
The ocean speaks
Motions from the deep
In solace we forever sleep
Calling on the waves
The ocean screams
...we sleep
