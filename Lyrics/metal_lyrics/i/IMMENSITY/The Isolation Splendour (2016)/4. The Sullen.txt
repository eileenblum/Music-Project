Silence will find us bearing shadows of the day
Binds us confines us within remnants we decay
What lies within the walls of sleep
What lies within we dare to dream

The remains of the day like ruins fall as a broken tree of life
And the dark enwreathes the truth from hiding a sullen face inside

Words confined in tears
Like walls of silence all the years
Feeding alone on solitary
Breathing in fear

I walk in solemn steps
This road to omission
Between the waning moon
The universe, hidden stars
Set free the white dove from my hands
Shall never dwell again

The memory of all in vain
As the withered lay to rest
A memory and all in vain
As the withered fall away

Darkness will find us in crestfallen misery
Binds us divides us in the shadows we remain
What lies within the walls of sleep
What lies within we dare to dream

The remains of the day in ruins fall with the fractured tree of life... Of life
From the roots unearths the truth subsiding the sullen face be night

Words confide in tears we learn from silence all the years
Breathing alone living in fear
Words confined in tears
We learn from silence all the years
