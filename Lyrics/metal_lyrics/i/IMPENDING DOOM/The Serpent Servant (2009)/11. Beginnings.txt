We live in a world of hate, a beautiful place seen through obscure eyes.
Caught in the glimpse of this life.
How do I find what I seek?
Where does your glory and I meet?
This speck of light is my creeping death, I cant wait till I am dead only to live again.
Filled with filth I don't need this anymore.
How can I think I am alive, when I have never lived before.
This speck of light is my creeping death, I cant wait till I am dead only to live again.
This world has created an ending that starts tonight.
We live in a world of hate, a beautiful place seen through obscure eyes.
Caught in the glimpse of this life.
How do I find what I seek?
Where does your glory and I meet?
This is where I begin!
