Rise...
Bones to ashes dreams to rot
We strike back when we are high on blood
Screaming from the seas of ANU

Oh when the gods awake
Creatures beyond dark and light
Buried in the minds of them
Who don't know

Atone for your mistake

You can't know what has to come
When we rise from the seas of frozen gods
A new and different feeling
When we drink your fresh hot blood

Rise...
We were dying but shall rise again
Fall to your knees and close your eyes
Hail and honour the serpent calls
And we shall rise
