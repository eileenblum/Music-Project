Hell...
Freezing pain dying insane
Mankind is fallen the abyss within
And the gate is frozen
But the fire behind
Lights me the final scene of the

Funeral it's the feast of the beast
And it starts at dawn
Demonclaws put the angelwings down
To the cremate machine
Starring the eyes cruelty of the damned
In my heart it's cold
Again my heart goes on
I'm the pyre of the funeral

We despise this one who killed his own sons
We are the hatred ones
eternal plague the hunt is on
our songs of death shall kill the light forever
