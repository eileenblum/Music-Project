Moon...
Every, every night I feel the pain inside
Neverwhere to find my destiny
The 7th gate is opened to welcome me
The beast inside awakes I shall try to crucifiy

With the stix to the crucifix
Only the weak dies on the cross
Agony you die in agony
Bloodpraised agony
Your agony the bloodpraised agony
You die in agony

Yes, I'm the crucifier
The reflection for the lies of god
The merciless messiah
Who raped the crucified son
A desecration in fire
With the power from the other side
Screams from the hidden empire

So yes I am the crucifier, baptized in fire
Bloodpraised antichrist by the light of the night
So yes I am the crucifier to the cross
