We are elder than the edge of god
Spawned by the knowledge of the ancient ones
We're sons from the blood dead
Returned to lead the children of hate

Give us your blood so that we can rise
With a vengeance from the blood signed space
We are the lords of the plague
And we deal with the reign of the dead

The fear before the unknown
Which I am dealing
I can see it in your eyes
I'm just once with the dark side
And in eternity let malice rise
The revocation

Take me away under the wicked sky
Where the circle is broken
Where the sunlight is gone
And the forgotten triangle of life
Reaches near

Agitator of the darkend light
Exterminator from the serpent side
We can't live forever
But we still rule together

Revocation of creation
Demonwards of desecration
We can't live forever
But we still rule together
Forever
Revocation of creation

So take me away under the wicked sky
