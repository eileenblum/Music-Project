I confront you fuckin' holy father
You cannot read my mind
I deny to be a servant of the weak lord
From my heart I damned the light

For your prayers I'm too strong
Like phoenix from my ashes I shall rise
My flesh is willing and I'll return
With rapture I burn again

I am I will I create
Strong spirit leads my fate
We burn the house of god
I burn the house of god

So burn again

See the walls of lies are crushing down
Stained the altar of the holy one
A decorated gay dangled on the cross
Smily boy with crown of thorns

Freedom be my only way
Godlike in front of you here I stay
My flesh is willing and I'll return
With rapture I burn again

I am I will I create
Strong spirit leads my fate
We burn the house of god
I burn the house of god
Burn
