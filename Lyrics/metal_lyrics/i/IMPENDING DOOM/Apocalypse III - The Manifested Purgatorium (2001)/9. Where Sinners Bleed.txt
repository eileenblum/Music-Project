There were sinners bleed
Demonic seed
Maniac strikes to attack

Knee deep in blood I wade
Drunk by the blood of the saints
Feelings of death make me thrill
So kill or be killed

Suffering downstairs in my private hell
Clattering are the chains of death and sodomy

Mental disorder in destructive order
Hear them screming in fear from the hole
There were sinnners bleed

Home sweet hell

There were sinners bleed
Demonic seed
Maniac strikes to attack

Knee deep in blood I wade
Drunk by the blood of the saints
Feelings of death make me thrill
So kill or be killed

Knee deep in blood I wade
Drunk by the blood of the saints
I am the maniac
Which strikes back to attack
