Violators be damned for your desecration proud, blasphemers your wickedness will not go unpunished, for he crushes his oppressors and embraces his righteous!
Those who call upon his name for strength shall be blessed.
Standing by my faith is were I belong; facing trials and oppression makes me strong.
But I am a good person, oh no we're not!
Evil men walk in heaven through repentance, good men sizzle through ignorance.
Do not talk down on what you don't know, or there will be hell to pay.
For he crushes his oppressors.
