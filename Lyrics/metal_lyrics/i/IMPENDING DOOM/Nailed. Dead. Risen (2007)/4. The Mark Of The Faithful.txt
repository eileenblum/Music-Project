A mark only seen upon the faithful, from the never ending truth with everlasting youth, we fall to our knees as the unveiling draws near.
Surrounded by destructive heresies, we are made the worlds enemies, no threats will ever threaten me for I am promised heavens eternity.
What about you? Don't believe the lies that will lead to your demise, we're inspired by a powerful saviour, the gospel like thunder as Satan cowers trying to pull you under, he kneels as a feeble beast to the saints but devouring the lost.
We believe we are the sons of a living majesty.
A mark only seen upon the faithful, from the never ending truth with everlasting youth, we fall to our knees as the unveiling draws near.
Surrounded by destructive heresies, we are made the worlds enemies, no threats will ever threaten me.
We believe we are the sons of a living majesty.
We are the messengers in the last days.
