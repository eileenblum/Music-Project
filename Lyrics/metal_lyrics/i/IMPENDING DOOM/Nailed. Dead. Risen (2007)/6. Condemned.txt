A shake is coming leaving not one brick or stone in full form.
Waves of terror are foreseen, rebellion flashes before your eyes.
Great monuments lay as rubble, the dust has not yet settled, relentless destruction.
Your end is in the distance you know this.
Your lips tremble like the earth.
Eyes water in solitude you stand.
With this world you live by, with this world you'll die.
Last breathe on earth, to your first breathe in hell.
Condemned by your deeds you fates been sealed.
Last breathe on earth, to first breathe in hell.
Condemned by your deeds your fates been sealed.
Condemned!
