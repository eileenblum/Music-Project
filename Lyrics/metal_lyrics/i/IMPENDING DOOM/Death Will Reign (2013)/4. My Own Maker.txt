Another day of sin
Hope is dead and nothing is left within

Driven by hate
To another empty place
Where we just work and procreate
Worn to the bone we die and get replaced

Afraid of a life in vain
I'm choking on the air I can't breathe
Am I an image of God?
Or does the devil have his hands in me?

Will I survive?

Demons holed up in my head
Silhouettes covered in death
If I can create my own blood
Can I create another breath?

Am I my own maker?
Am I my own creator?
Are we doomed to fail
Or are we meant for something greater?

Dying I'm dying
Dying I'm dying
Pull me up from my grave

Demons holed up in my head
Silhouettes covered in death
If I can create my own blood
Can I create another breath?
Am I my own maker?
Am I my own creator?

Driven by hate
To another empty place
Where we just work and procreate
Worn to the bone we die and get replaced

Afraid of a life in vain
I'm choking on the air I can't breathe
Am I an image of God?
Or does the devil have his hands in me?

Dying I'm dying
Dying I'm dying
Pull me up from my grave
