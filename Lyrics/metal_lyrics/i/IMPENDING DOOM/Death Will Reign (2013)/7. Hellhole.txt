Broken beyond belief
How could I forgive a man so sick?
Broken beyond belief
How could God forgive a man so sick?

I long for the light
But the scars cut so deep
Desires for vengeance
Carve a gaping hole inside of me

Praying on the innocent
A face of beauty now stained in blood
You can never give back what you've taken
Scream forgiveness to the sky above

Broken beyond belief
Broken beyond belief

I would be terrified
If your soul was mine
I would be terrified
Of eternal suffering waiting in the after life

We stand in judgement in the eyes of the Lord
And His compassion may you receive
I'd give my life to punish yours
An imperfection that burns in me

You deserve the fire
You deserve to burn
You deserve the fire
You deserve to burn

Give me the strength to learn forgiveness
For my mind is filled with pain and hatred

I would be terrified
If your soul was mine
I would be terrified
Of the eternal suffering waiting in the after life

I long for the light
But the scars cut so deep
Desires for vengeance
Carve a gaping hole inside of me

Praying on the innocent
A face of beauty now stained in blood
You can never give back what you've taken
So scream forgiveness to the sky above

We stand in judgement in the eyes of the Lord
And His compassion may you receive
I'd give my life to punish yours
An imperfection that burns in me

You deserve the fire
You deserve to burn
You deserve the fire
You deserve to burn

Your sick and polluted mind
If your soul was mine I would be terrified
I'd tear off the lids of you eyes
To make you watch and learn
The sins of your past have left you to burn in your hellhole
Burn for what you've done
Burn in your hellhole
Burn for what you've done
