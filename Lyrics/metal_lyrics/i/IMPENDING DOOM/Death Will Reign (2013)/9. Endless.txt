Are you afraid?
Or follow me into a world so real

Where hearts of gold
And pain has no feel

But where we are is just a matter of time before our lungs collapse and properly die

I do not fear death
It fears me

My hands are cold
My skin is tearing
Death is tough
But love is baring

Give me the strength to go on

My hands are cold
My skin is tearing and decayed
Another age of pain
Another day of slaves

My eyes are tired
Of all the filth that I see
You're either with me
Or against me

Give me the strength to go on

This is the truth so

Hate me!

For encouraging the world

Hate me!

All the lies you will die
With no memory.
No time for ignorance
This is your evidence

Hate me!

For encouraging the world
Hate me

All with eyes come see
How life will unfold
Those with ears to hear
You've been told

Oh!

I do not fear death
