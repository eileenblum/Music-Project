This is the time to fight back
This is the time to fight back

Cast the stones
Upon the innocent
Hypocrites wallow in
Superficial ignorance

Slither like snakes upon the cross
Too many fangs to count
Severed heads will fall
By the hands that they denounce

This is the time to fight back
This is the time to fight back

Never again never again never again
Will I entertain the views of godless men
Never again never again never again
Will I be force fed a false religion

Does the earth tremble at your name?
Do the mountains bow at your sight?
Do the stars glorify you?
Do you give the breath of life?

Rip, tear and burn every last page
What is there to gain
Cursing his holy name?

This is the time to fight back
This is the time to fight back

Never again never again never again
Will I entertain the views of godless men
Never again never again never again
Will I be force fed a false religion

Wage holy war
Wage holy war
Wage holy war
Wage holy war

In death all in final
We will know good and evil
