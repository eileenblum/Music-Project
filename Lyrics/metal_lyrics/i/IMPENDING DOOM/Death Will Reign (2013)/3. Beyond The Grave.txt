We are heaven's unexpected
We are the forgotten faces
We are heaven's unexpected
We are the forgotten faces
We are heaven's unexpected
We are the forgotten faces
We are heaven's unexpected
We are the forgotten faces 

Walking roads that seem to never end
Becoming the dead bones that we thought were hidden
I'll show respect no matter what you believe in
Never again will I judge the life
I've not been given

Who am I?
A man that deserves hell
Who am I?
A man that will never see it himself
Who am I?
An enemy to the most high Who am I?
A man paid for by the price of blood

I believe
That the day
The dead are resurrected
I will walk in heaven
And it will be
Full of the unexpected

Scales fall from my eyes
Shedding skin breathe new life 

I've never been one for the big mouths that can draw a crowd
One with the abandoned. The poor. And beaten down.
Keep talking loud keep talking proud
Enjoy the stage you'll be forgotten
Beyond the grave 

We are heaven's unexpected
We are the forgotten faces
We are heaven's unexpected
We are the forgotten faces
We are heaven's unexpected
We are the forgotten faces
We are heaven's unexpected
We are the forgotten faces
