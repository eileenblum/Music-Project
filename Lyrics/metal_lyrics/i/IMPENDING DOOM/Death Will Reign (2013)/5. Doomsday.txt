Welcome to Doomsday
The day of death
No one escapes
Begging for our last breath

No tomorrow
The blood will spill tonight
So say your last words
And kiss it all goodbye

Tension so thick that a spark will ignite the air
One press of a button away from nuclear warfare
I hear their cries
Billions of people fear for their lives

Oh God what have we done?
Oh God what have we become?

Welcome to doomsday

There is still violence
We're still baptized in filth
We're still servants to the serpent

So when the skies rain
The final sin
Will it all be worth it
When you meet him?

I've seen the world bleed
Shaking the earth beneath the kingdoms of old
The love of man will grown cold

I've seen the face of greed
Smiling selfishly
Human cruelty

Oh God what have we done?
Oh God what have we become?

Welcome to doomsday

The hands of heaven are hanging on by a thread
The hands of hell are preying on the dead
The hands of heaven are hanging on by a thread
The hands of hell are preying on the dead
