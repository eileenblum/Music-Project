Void of light
Apocalypse
Anti Christ
So blasphemous

We could have it all
Or dwell ineternal darkness
An open wound will never heal
And suffering is the only real conscious

Wilted in the rotting flesh
A seed is sown in the putrid decay
A glimmer of hope in the face of death
Lying dormant in a grave of reeking betray

In the end the body will rot
But we are given the choice to decide
Hell wasn't made for us
Born with the choice live or die

Live or die
Live or die

In the end the body will rot
But we are given the choice todecide
Hell wasn't made for us
Born with the choice live or die

Void of light
Apocalypse
Anti Christ
So blasphemous

We could have it all
Or dwell in eternal darkness
An open wound will never heal
And suffering is the only real conscious

Hell wasn't made for us
Hell wasn't made for us

Hell wasn't made for us
Don't give in to the wicked son

Hell wasn't made for us
Don't give in to the malicious ones

We hold the key to the door of life
An open passage we have yet to see
A glimmer of hope in the face of death
Lying dormant in a grave for eternity

In the end the body will rot
But we are given the choice to decide
Hell wasn't made for us
Born with the choice liveor die

Live or die
Live or die

In the end the body will rot
But we are given the choice to decide
Hell wasn't made for us
Born with the choice live or die
