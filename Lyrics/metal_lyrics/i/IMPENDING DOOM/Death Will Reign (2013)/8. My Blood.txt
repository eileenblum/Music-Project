My son my blood you're never alone and my word is bond
My son my blood you're never alone and my word is bond
A father's love can't be broken A father's love will remain
'Til the end of the ages and beyond the grave
We brought you into this life and I will lead you home
We brought you into this war and you will never fight alone
Listen to my voice and remember my words
Never fight alone
A soul that shines so bright
Like a reflection of heaven
In a dark world shines a light
Glorified in you
You have strength
You are love
You have compassion
And you have mercy
You have wisdom
You are ambitious
You have life
And you are worthy
You're a man
You're a lion
You are honest
And you're important
You are holy
And when you speak
Your words will shake
The foundations of the earth
You are my beloved
I love you and I always will
My undying love
My faithfulness to only one
Thank you for this gift
My wife I can't thank you enough
You have fears
You'll have your doubts
You'll feel pain
I'll never walk out
You'll know anger
You'll feel frustrated
You will suffer
I reach out my hand
I'll give my body
I'll shed my blood
Remember your father's words
My work is never done

I would sacrifice my life for my son and my wife
You can break my heart and my bones
But you'll never take my home
You'll never take my home
You'll never take my home
You'll never take my home
You'll never take my home
