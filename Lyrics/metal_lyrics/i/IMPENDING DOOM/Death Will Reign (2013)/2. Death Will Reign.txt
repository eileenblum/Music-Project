Drawn from the shadows
Demons dance in the black
Clawing at the cross
Carried on my back

Led astray
Every day is a struggle for survival
As the world drifts away
Further from revival

Save me
Heaven save me.
I feel betrayed by the work of my hands
Save me
Heaven save me
I fear the dawn of the darkness in man

My life is a constant war
My life is a constant fight
My life is a constant war
My life is a constant fight.
(This life is a constant war)
(This life is a constant fight)

I've seen the devils eyes
A messenger in disguise
Infecting my wounds with lies
Burning down heaven in my mind

Born again in the fire
Tear me out of hell
Born again in the fire
Tear me out of hell

Save me
Heaven save me.
I feel betrayed by the work of my hands
Save me
Heaven save me
I fear the dawn of the darkness in man

My life is a constant war
My life is a constant fight
My life is a constant war
My life is a constant fight.
(This life is a constant war)
(This life is a constant fight)

Drawn from the shadows
Demons dance in the black
Clawing at the cross
Carried on my back

Drawn from the shadows
Demons dance in the black
Clawing at the cross
Carried on my back

Death will reign
Upon the Fallen Angels
Death will reign
Upon the Fallen Angels
Death will reign
Upon the Fallen Angels
Death will reign
Upon the Fallen Angels
