Man. Crippled and broken
Crawling to an illusion
Beautifully crafted by Satan
An existence with no salvation

The great divine
Why is the world plagued with death?
Bringer of light
When will we find peace in eternal rest?

Born in the image of the lamb
Enslaved by the unholy flag

We are damned
By cancers spreading everywhere
We are damned
By hatred that man cannot bare

Why are we here?
Why are we dying to know
Why a life of suffering
Could not become a life of gold?

Why are we here?
Why are we dying to know
Why a life of suffering
Could not become a life of gold?

Man. Crippled and broken
Crawling to an illusion
Beautifully crafted by Satan
Creating an existence with no salvation
