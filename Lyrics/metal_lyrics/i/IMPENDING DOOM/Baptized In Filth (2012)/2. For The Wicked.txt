The mark of the beast

Hate me, like he told me i would be
Kill me, like he told me i would be
Anti christian, un American
You pledge your allegiance to the fallen
Failure in the flesh crawling to your grave
Hopeless and Godless eternally you lay
Have we gone to far?
Have we gone to far?
This is the end of life as you know it
This is accepted, is the no turning back?

Giving birth to evil, from the womb of hell [2x]

No peace, for the wicked [2x]
Beware the mark of the beast [2x]

Rotting from the inside out
Destroying our bodies with the filth of the world
Creating a wretched spawn of existence, giving birth to evil
Have we gone to far?
Have we gone to far?
This is the end of life as you know it
This is accepted, is there no turning back?

Hate me, kill me

Take the number you've chosen
666 is one with the fallen [4x]
