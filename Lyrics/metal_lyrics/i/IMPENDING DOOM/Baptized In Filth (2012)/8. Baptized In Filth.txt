I'll shake off this town
Leave it with a curse
Blessed are the doves
And out with the wolves
I can't even imagine
I deny here on earth
And Iâm denied by the heaven
Left to be forsaken

Faithful, fallen

Baptized in filth
Across the nation
Baptized in filth
Return to be risen

Religion shuts the gates
To heaven here on earth
Practice what you preach
You hypocrites

Hypocrites

You're all hypocrites
Love or hatred it's all or nothing

Baptized in filth
Across the nation
Baptized in filth
Return to be risen

Baptized in filth
Across the nation
Baptized in filth
Calling for revival
