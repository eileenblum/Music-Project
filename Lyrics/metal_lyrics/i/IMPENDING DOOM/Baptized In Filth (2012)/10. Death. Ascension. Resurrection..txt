Who do you say i am?
I am the alpha omega
Beginning and end
If only you understood you'd know
That the heart is a treasure from heaven
Death, ascension, resurrection
Now look what Iâve become
Proclaiming his name and looking down the barrel of a gun
I'm in this for life

The time has come to change the world
All this destruction keeps pushing us back
Running, further, into the ground
The Devil isn't the king of hell
He's just the chief prisoner that fell
With, the world wrapped around his finger

Are we, trapped in division and unbelief
Forever, separated by our hatred

Turn, run as fast as you can
And leave it all behind
There's nothing for you here
The Devil isn't the king of hell
He's just the chief prisoner that fell
With, the world wrapped around his finger

Are we trapped in division and unbelief
Forever, separated by our hatred [2x]

Death, ascension, resurrection [8x]

Demon possessed, praise the dead
Walking beside him like darkness is your closet friend

Are we, trapped in division and unbelief
Forever, separated by our hatred
Follow, him to the kingdom of heaven
Where pain and suffering cease to exist

Death, ascension, resurrection [2x]
