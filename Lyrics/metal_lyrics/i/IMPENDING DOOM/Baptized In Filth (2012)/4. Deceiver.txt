This is the last time you'll see my face
And the last you hear my voice
You words are weak and pathetic
And when you speak i can see you're desperate
For the attention you won't get

The filth you speak
Comes straight from hell
Your walls are weak and i can tell

So many say this is the last generations
Pray you die before your part of the last ones
Follow me and the ending signs
Come and gone in the blink of an eye
The first evil has already fallen
The voice below soon will be calling
Stay cold and you will never die
Stay cold you were never alive

The filth you speak
Come straight from hell
Your walls are weak and i can tell

The filth you speak
Come straight from hell
Your walls are weak and we can tell

When your dead and gone [6x]
No one will be there, there
But the Snake, the Devil, unholy one

No more cliches or empty explanations
No need to waste my breathe on the situation
You disguise yourself as someone you're not
A facade to boost your little ego
The voice below soon will be calling
The voice below soon will be calling
Stay cold and you will never die
Stay cold you were never alive

Dead bodies stacked ten feet tall [3x]
Now the Devil's at your funeral

Dead bodies stacked ten feet tall
Now the Devil's at your funeral [2x]

The filth you speak
Come straight from hell
Your walls are weak and i can tell
