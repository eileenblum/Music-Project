A coming fight is on the horizon
Violent love, we can not hide from
A broken man watches vainly
To a world that can never save us
He prays for the first time
He cries out for a chance and justice
Soon a great light will see
The people of the darkness
Of the darkness

We have to realize
A reality beyond our eyes
In an unseen world
The Antichrist is gonna rise and we'll
Have to realize
A reality beyond our eyes
In an unseen world
The Antichrist will fall

The future written in the past
A prophecy of everything ending

I, am, a murderer
Wash me clean

We have to realize
A reality beyond our eyes
In an unseen world
The Antichrist is gonna rise and we'll
Have to realize
A reality beyond our eyes
In an unseen world
The Antichrist will fall
The Antichrist will fall

Evil cost the world
A murder paid it all

I, am, a murderer
Wash me clean [2x]

I, (i), am, (am) a murderer
Wash me clean

I, (i), am, (am) a murderer, (murderer)
Wash me clean [5x]
