I suffer through this path
I waited for the hope within this black
My heart's a dead machine
Every sin will stain my soul
Thank God to wash me clean

My light unseen
(somebody help)

Break my fall, now carry me
(somebody help)

My light unseen
(somebody help)

I'm so unclean
(somebody help)

I search within my ways
I center on the dark within my veins
But you never let me go
I know hell is in this place
So i beg for you to show

My light unseen
(somebody help)

Break my fall, now carry me
(somebody help)

My light unseen
(please, somebody help)

I'm so unclean
(please, let somebody help)

I take back every word i said
Every fault i laid in vain
Tear this crown from off my head
My repentance on this day

(please, somebody help) [2x]

My light unseen
(please, please, please, somebody help) [2x]

Break my fall, now carry me
(God, God, oh God)

My light unseen
(God, oh God, please)

Break my fall, now carry me
(somebody help)
