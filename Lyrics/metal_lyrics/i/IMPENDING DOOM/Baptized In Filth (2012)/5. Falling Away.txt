Falling away
I pray for judgment day
Tremble in fear
The end is near

This isnât about us against the world
Atheists and Christians are begging for him
This is all making it home before the darkness closes in
But hypocrisy and blasphemy must come to an end

Falling away
I pray for judgment day
Tremble in fear
The end is near [2x]

God bless the faithless
Searching for the answers and explanations
With an open mind, and not a guilty conscience [2x]

Angels and demons fighting for your prayers
Thereâs a world of difference, don't worship ignorance
Treating your iconic images, like they are a God
Come to know the truth and witness the brilliance

This is your, finest hour
Of your, existence

You say you're not religious
I say hell yeah you are
You know the difference between us
You are your own worst God

You are your own worst God

The revolution has started
To hell with your hatred [2x]

Falling away
I pray for judgment day
Tremble in fear
The end is near [2x]
