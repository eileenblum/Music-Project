This whole world is out of control
New religions, new moral behaviors
Life is hard and it's not getting easier
Now i know the need for a savior
I'm so sick of the gimmicks and trends
Slowly fading, praying it ends
This is not a day of vengeance
But a day of redemption

From fear, to anger, to sorrow
Turns to this

Till the end
We will descend
In an age broken and torn (torn, torn)
Chaos reborn

Chaos is reborn
Heretic

Chaos is reborn
Heretic

As i watch the maggots swarm
Feasting on the sheep of this age
Nothing will stop my rage
I'm so sick of the gimmicks and trends
Slowly fading, praying it ends
This is not a day of vengeance
But a day of redemption

From fear, to anger, to sorrow
Turns to this

We worship the lifeless
We worship the silent
We worship the deception
This corruption must pass away

This isnât Eden
Rise and march
This has become the garden of the damned

Till the end
We will descend
In an age broken and torn
Chaos reborn [3x]
