I will never sink to your level
I see you holding hands with the Devil
My enemies, will not take away, another day from me
I will rise above, all the mocking and ridicule
The one you reject is the God that saves us all

We can stack my sins, a mile high if you want
We can talk about all, Iâve done wrong, if you want
But don't you dare spit a verse, misused and out of context
To try and prove a point, (try and prove a point)

Where your going there is no fame no glory
Bashing everything i believe
I don't need another reason
I'll say my peace and Iâm done with you

I am not here for any self glorification
Your anger and hatred form me, won't bring you and salvation

Write your angry letters to God
Write your angry songs to God

Where your going there is no fame no glory
Bashing everything i believe
I don't need another reason
I'll say my peace and Iâm done with you, move

Please forgive us, everyoneâs time has to come [5x]
