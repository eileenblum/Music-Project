An Act of Darkness
The Art of Sacrifice
Sit down my Son
I'll tell you from the Other Side
Run through the Darkness
Bloodred Kind of Misery
I - Blasphemeous Spirit
On a Sphere of Profanity
Stigma, Stigma - Signum of Hate
Stigma, Stigma - Sign of Disgrace
Stigma, Stigma - Trance &amp; Terror
Stigma, Stigma - Signum of Hate
The Euphony of excruciating Pain
Execution by the Way of Nazarene
My Fate is still alive
I evoke the Scars - So bleed for me
My Journey is a Mission in Blood
The Opposition of a sickly God
I'm the Crown of Thorns deep in your Brain
"Torturemaster" is my second Name
