I've seen Fires on the black Horizon
Storms near the secret Woods
I've seen the Silhouette of a mighty Rider
Before the Sunset of Eternity
Firestorm - Was his Battlehorse
Black - Like a Ravenfeather
The Hooves - Sound like Thunderbolts
The Rider - Was in Search for the Meaning of him
Self
He was the Ancient One
He comes riding through the Darkness
Fire, Fire set me free
Like the Warrior I want to be
The Hourglass has fallen down
Exploded now to thousand Times
The Rider is sitting in the Wisdom's Floats
Uncounted Minutes of Sand are running through his
Hands
