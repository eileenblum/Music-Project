Open the Gates of Hell
By the Moonlight they come crawling
From deeper than Dephts
From Subordinate to Domination
Domination of suffering Souls
Domination of suffering Souls
Domination of suffering Souls
Domination of suffering Souls
Oh Lord of Darkness
Please let me sleep
My Way was far &amp; evil
Show me the Way
To the blessed Insanity
Before the Dawn
