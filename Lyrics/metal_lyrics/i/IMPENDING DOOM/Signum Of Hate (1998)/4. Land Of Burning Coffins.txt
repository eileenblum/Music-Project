A boneless Rising
From the Womb of Hades
A black Rose lies on my Grave
The Reek of Dust &amp; Death
Is surround me
Enjoy me on diabolical Ways
If you want to follow me
There's no Return
Trust &amp; follow me
Burn your Coffins - Burn
Land of burning Coffins
Shadows of wooden Crosses
Land of burning Coffins
Impaled Creatures on my Way
Land of burning Coffins
Visions of Death have disappeared
Land of burning Coffins
In the Shadows of
Wooden Crosses
I awake
