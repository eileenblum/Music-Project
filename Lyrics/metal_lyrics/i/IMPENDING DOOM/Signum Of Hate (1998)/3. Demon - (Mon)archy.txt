At the Castle's Side I lie
Demons &amp; Shadows cross my way
My dark Empire strikes back again
Blood signed the Altar - Blood on my Hands
Dark Angel
Dark Angel never sleeps
And he was fallen to be free
To rule with Sword &amp; Fire
In the Labyrinth of the Unseen
I wonder about in my own shadowy Exist
Look behind the human Mask
I am a Beast
Beyond the Eyes of Black
Behind the Mirror of Insanity
Unknown Angers are rising from the Dephts
I feel the Demon inside of me
I'm entangled in this World of Light
I'm a Monument of War between Day &amp; Night
You'll be forgotten before you'll die
Remember - I am immortal - Demons
Demonarchy - The Demons rise in me
Demonarchy - Possession,
Obsession - I praise
