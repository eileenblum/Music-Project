By the Blood of ENKI we were spawned
A cruel Creature, who are you unknown
Bloodred Waves are crushing in your Face
Await the Revenge of a forgotten Race
Fear them
Once there was a Battle in the Universe
The Old Ones were cursed for a couple of
Thousand Years
Disciples prepare their second Coming
The Magic Stone, the Magic Signs, Blood is
Running
Fear them
Let rise the Realm of Dead
And let them smell the Incense
They open wide the Gates
And the mighty Serpent rises
IAK SAKKAK
IAK NINNGHIZHIDDA
See them fall &amp; rise
We, who we are from the Blood of the Dead
The Spawn of KINGU
Formed by the Hands of MARDUK
Infernal Minds became Flesh
Listen - So be the Pact
So be it
Dead but dreaming
