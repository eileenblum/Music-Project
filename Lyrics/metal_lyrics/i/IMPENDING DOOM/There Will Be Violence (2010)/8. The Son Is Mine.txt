(Men of America, it's time to stop being brainwashed)
Blind eyes and deaf ears
Are not welcome here
In my desperation
I'll fight for your affection
To set me apart
To find who I truly am
The son is mine
Power corrupts definitely
Conceit is a mask to insecurity
Your influence has been criticized
By friends and enemies
I know that no matter how many bridges I burn
How many lessons I never fully learn
Love is something all alone
I would never deserve
The son is mine
This is my confession of my troubled soul
Renew me
And make my eyes shine
The son is mine
This is a conflict of two natures
In my body
Is both evil and death who will set me free?
Power corrupts definitely
Conceit is a mask to insecurity
Your influence has been criticized
By friends and enemies
The sun never sets on my life
The son never sets
The son is mine for life
