Here I am
A dangerous man
Father, God
Give me strength
To fight till the end
Then to jump in faith
And to break the stronghold in my way
The time is up
The time has come
Quit playing it safe
I spit in your face
The end is coming
But not yet
You're not that lucky
Torment will go on and on
I was expecting you
And I'm not afraid
Of ten thousand of
The ungodly
NOTHING YOU DO CAN STOP ME NOW!
I've seen those who sink deeper and deeper
Into their depravity
YOU WON'T TAKE ME!
The hell you preach
And ascend from
Has been shoved down
Our throats for far too long
In evil
There's no spark of creativity
There's only twisted and deformed
Darkened beauty
I curse you back to your wasteland
NOTHING YOU DO CAN STOP ME NOW!
Send us the sounds of heaven
Send us the sounds of war
Every ounce of evil will fade away
We are the sounds of heaven
We are the voice of war
