This is violence in its purest form, what it is truly made for, love and hatred flow through my throat, with this microphone in my hand.
We are the voice for the voiceless among unholy kingdoms drunk with blasphemy.
We are continents wide and oceans deep, the blood of the saints is splashed across the ruins like a holy holocaust.
We will return and you will hear an uproar of lost souls.
There will be violence!
Perverse works are in vain, though the light may now seem dim, the whole world chases after Him, this is a movement abandoning hate and preaching war.
We are the voice for the voiceless among unholy kingdoms drunk with blasphemy.
We are continents wide and oceans deep, the blood of the saints is splashed across the ruins like a holy holocaust.
We will return and you will hear an uproar of lost souls.
For the unbelievers who repeatedly try to retain their faith in humanity I promise there will be violence.
There will be violence!
