[featuring Tim Lambesis of As I Lay Dying]

Life is granted by an unforeseen force
We are but molecules in motion and nothing more?
Survival of the fittest is a dark tale
Sending my generation to the depths of hell
Inventors of evil and the secrets of men
Worthy of misery, worthy of death
The pages of the old teach
That the treasures of heaven are filth of the Earth
I will not turn my eyes
I will not ignore their cries
(We have turned sanctity of life into a septic tank of living)
Oh wretched animals!
This is terror, this is darkness
This the human heart
Set me apart because
When rejection leads to depression
I proclaim in the loudest
I curse "modern day consumption"
And the chambers that execute them
Orphans come home
Life is granted by an unforeseen force
We are but molecules in motion and nothing more?
Survival of the fittest is a dark tale
Sending my generation to the depths of hell
Through the tears I see
The beauty of you
The night is over, the morning's dawning
The pages of the old teach
That the treasures of heaven are filth of the Earth
I will not turn my eyes
I will not ignore their cries
Orphans come home
The kingdom is yours
Orphans come home!
