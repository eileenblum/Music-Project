Suffering and glory
Are the greatest powers history has ever seen
I want to live a life worth writing about
And more because I lived a life
A life worth dying for
FAITH!
WALK WITH ME!
We have made it my friends
We're the closest generation to the end
They will never silence us
With torture or in their prisons
Tears will roll down our cheeks
And our souls will get restless
But we will not be afraid
Of the lion's teeth in our face
I will grab the beast by his mane
And scream at the top of my lungs
We have made it my friends
We're the closets generation to the end
They will never silence us
With torture or in their prisons
Our love is stronger than death
I will never deny my faith
FOREVER!
