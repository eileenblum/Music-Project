[featuring Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain]

The devil is alive, cause I can feel him breathing
Over the horizon comes hell and my arms wide open
As I embrace the apocalypse
This is what you came to know as fear
He s here  This is The Great Fear!

[Chorus:]
I don't care who you are
You're afraid of death, you're terrified
By how the worlds going to end
So follow me as I take you to the one where life begins
Where life begins

A flash, with black roses in our hands
We fall to the floor like ash
The hatred placed in humanity leads to the love of global destruction
And worship of senseless slaughter.

[Chorus]

(Now put all this suffering and hatred together, this won't last forever)
THIS WON'T LAST FOREVER!!!
(We are enslaved to a darkened world)
I WILL NEVER FOLLOW!!!

[Chorus]

(Everyone here will die, but the great fear is being left behind.)
Hell is coming but I embrace the one
who stands alone.
HELL IS COMING!
