I do believe
But perverted religions
They all spread like disease
Untrusting and deceived
Governments leading the blind
Controlling society with
NOISE!
PEACE!
ILLUSIONS!
Riots fill our streets
NOISE!
PEACE!
ILLUSIONS!
I have said nothing new
I'm not a revolutionary
I'm not the world's leader
But I'm a part of holding it together
I have such a different view of this place
It seems that the faces of evil
Always seem to change
I'm not a revolutionary
I'm not the world's leader
But I'm a part of holding it together
I have such a different view of this place
It seems that the faces of evil
Always change
In this generation, over and over again
Something has to be said
This is not a threat noise!
PEACE!
ILLUSIONS!
Death is in the air
NOISE!
PEACE!
ILLUSIONS!
NOISE!
PEACE!
ILLUSIONS!
Riots fill our streets
NOISE!
PEACE!
ILLUSIONS!
Peace is an illusion
Death has come!
