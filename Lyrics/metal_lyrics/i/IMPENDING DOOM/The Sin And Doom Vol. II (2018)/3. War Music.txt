Feel the power in the message
This is war music

This is war music

So many bands not saying a thing
So many groups that preach their hate
Not me
Not me
Not me
Flesh and blood are not the enemy
You will never have me deceived
Kingdom war is what I believe
You are blinded by the true reality
There is a battle that you can't see

This sick
This sick-hearted world
Feeds off anger and hatred
This sick
This sick-hearted world
While destroying the next generation
This sick
This sick-hearted world
Feel the power in the message
This is war music

This is war music

Bury the serpent in chains
And lay his carcass to waste
Desecrate the wicked snake
And scatter his worthless remains
And lay his carcass to waste

And scatter his worthless remains

Nations rise against one another
Don't be fooled by power and corruption
Not me
Not me
Not me
Flesh and blood are not the enemy
You will never have me deceived
Not me
Not me
Not me
You are blinded by the true reality

This sick
This sick-hearted world
Feeds off anger and hatred
This sick
This sick-hearted world
While destroying the next generation
This sick
This sick-hearted world
Feeds off anger and hatred
This sick
This sick-hearted world
While destroying the next generation

This is war music
