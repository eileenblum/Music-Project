She calls
She calls to me
She calls
She calls out to me

Young boy she seems so innocent
Her voice creeps through the wind
Death is in her filthy touch
She is a deadly sin

Leading you astray
Gotta get away
Temptation's slave
Take us to your grave

Young man your heart is a wasteland
Trapped in a cold abyss
Wandering aimlessly
You chose to live like this

Her allure dragging you
Further and further and deeper and deeper
You can't get away from her
Run for your life
Further and further
Deeper and deeper
You can't get away from her

This is a final warning
Guard your heart an your soul
Temptation's always waiting
Leering in the shadows
But the lust in her eyes
Keeps on drawing you near
Her voice forever haunts you
Deafening in your ears

She calls
She calls to me
She calls
She calls out to me
