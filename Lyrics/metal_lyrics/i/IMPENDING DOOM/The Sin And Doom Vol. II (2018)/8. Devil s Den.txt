It's been 10 years since we last spoke
And every time I think of it
It makes me sick to my stomach

The drugs you use
Aren't fulfilling you
The drugs you use are only killing you
The years of pain will never end
As you entertain demons in the devils den

Slaughter the demons that are clawing on my brother's back
Oh god
Slaughter the demons that are clawing on my brother's back
Slaughter the demons that are clawing on my brother's back
Oh god
Slaughter the demons
Slaughter the demons and take my brother's life back

We need a savior to break our filthy chains
We need a savior to take away the pain

We need a savior to break our filthy chains
We need a savior to take away the pain

I will never give up on hope
Your heart and soul need to repent
But the years of pain will never end
As you entertain demons in the devils den

Slaughter the demons that are clawing on my brother's back
Oh god
Slaughter the demons that are clawing on my brother's back
Slaughter the demons that are clawing on my brother's back
Oh god
Slaughter the demons
Slaughter the demons and take my brother's life back

I stand at the gates of your hell and bring the power of almighty god
We need a savior to redeem his soul
We need a savior to bring our brother home
