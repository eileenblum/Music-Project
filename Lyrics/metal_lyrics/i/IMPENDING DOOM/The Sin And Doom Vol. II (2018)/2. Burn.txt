As we get further in the end times
They can take our lives
But not the fire that's burning inside
Tonight I scream out to a world in gloom
I pray for you to escape this impending doom

More and more we hear rumors of war
More and more we abandon his word
And for what and for what to knock on death's door
And when the trumpets blast I am the conqueror

This holy terror will be in the eyes of my enemies.
Take this gospel as a certainty
Through grey skies you'll see your king
Put to death what you believe
Witness the power of eternity
Hell won't take no more
Burn burn burn them all
Burn the demons in the church
Hell won't take no more
Burn burn burn them all
