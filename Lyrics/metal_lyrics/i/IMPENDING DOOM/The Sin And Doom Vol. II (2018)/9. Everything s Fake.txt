Get out, get out of your own head
The toxic thoughts
Poison your mind
Fed by, fed by this twisted culture
That's never satisfied

Get out, get out of your own head
The toxic thoughts
Poison your mind
Fed by, fed by this twisted culture
While we kill ourselves trying

We're addicted to a false image
Nothing's real but forced gimmicks
Don't listen to a word they say
Controlling you like drugs in our veins

we've become obsessed
We depend on it
Believing all the lies

We've become possessed
By our ignorance
Choking on what we despise

Choking on what we despise

Take back control of your own life
Don't listen to a word they say
Controlling you like drugs in our veins

Everything's fake
In this day and age
When there's no faith
Who will you trust
Everything's fake
In this day and age
When there's no faith
Who do you trust

Drop it!

Get out, get out of your own head
The toxic thoughts
Fed by, fed by this twisted culture
Poison your mind
While we kill ourselves trying
