I don't live in fear
Your doubts don't cross my mind
While your heads in the sand
I don't have the time

Get on the grind keep it moving
Get on the grind keep it going
I won't stop

Just watch me
Crush it
Breaking through all the barricades
Just trust me
I know
Nothings earned without dedication

You are walking away
But don't know where you're going
My darkness has been lifted
I won't live in the shadows again

You fall for anything
Back and forth beneath the crashing waves
I stand like an epic mountain
Staying true to what I believe

I will persevere
Through these violent storms
My faith remains unbroken
Stronger than ever before

Get on the grind keep it moving
Get on the grind keep it going
I won't stop

Just watch me
Crush it
Breaking through all the barricades
Just trust me
I know
Nothings earned without hard work

You are walking away
But don't know where you're going
My darkness has been lifted
I won't live in the shadows again

You fall for anything
Back and forth beneath the crashing waves
I stand like an epic mountain
Staying true to what I believe

I will persevere
Through these violent storms
My faith remains unbroken
Stronger than ever before
