When everyone around you is on the attack
You need to step up and fight your way back
There are too many victims who could have had a chance
If we confront the cowards we all make stand
Evil men must never advance
Real men must defend the innocent

Bullies and thugs and cowards and losers
Are gutless and spineless the weakest I've seen
People of god you know who you are
Live up to the standard that's shown by the king
I will not stand for this [2x]

If you hurt the weak
You just became an enemy to me

You live your life by violence
I promise your blood will be in the streets
We will not take defiance
I swear that we will take on the giants
We will not back down and we will never surrender

Evil men must never advance
Real men must defend the innocent

I won't stand for this [4x]
Hate
