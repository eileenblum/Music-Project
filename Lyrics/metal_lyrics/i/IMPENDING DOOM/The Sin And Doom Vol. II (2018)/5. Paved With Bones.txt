As the weak bow before the tyrants
A certain death is imminent
The few must rise and show the force of freedom
In the human spirit

The graves the graves the graves remind me
The brave the brave the brave define me

The path of righteousness is paved with bones
The act of sacrifice is set in stone
When death. Destruction. Came reigning down
We stood proud and held our ground

I will never forget
Their sacrifice

When evil arises we conquer for freedom

The graves the graves the graves remind me
The brave the brave the brave define me

The path of righteousness is paved with bones
The act of sacrifice is set in stone
When death. Destruction. Came reigning down
We stood proud and held our ground

Did they die for this corruption
Were their sacrifices in vein
Enough is enough your religion of greed
Is out of control
Shut it down
And take back our freedom

When evil arises we conquer for freedom
