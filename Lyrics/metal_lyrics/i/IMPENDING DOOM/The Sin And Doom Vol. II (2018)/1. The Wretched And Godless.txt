The wicked rule the world
A short lived reign
Followed by misery and pain
Hell awaits your evil ways
Injustice on the innocent
Will have its judgement day

No one escapes
No one will escape

The children cry out for help
And mercy never came
The memories remain
The children cry out for help
And mercy never came
The memories remain

You are the wretched and godless

Oh our wretched hearts
How wicked we've become
Look how far we have fallen
This world is a cruel deceiver

Sometimes I wouldn't blame God
If he lit the world on fire
Sometimes I wouldn't blame God
If he lit the world on fire
