The seeds of heritage lying cremated
Through the hand of a single man and his lust
Feeling relive by his work on flesh
Just like flies addicted to light
He loans for the unique moment
To slash, to cut and feel the warmth
Invisible in the degenerated society he acts
No one seems to care for the scab
That is a part of all, an inseparable symbiosis
The chalk-white face you look at
A human being or a disease, a waste-product
Searching for control, a life in the hands of me
Overwhelmed by this power, the physical strength
Try to make the most of the moment
Seeing the dumb smile you feel it
An incision, it sets me free, this pile of meat and ulcer
Moving under me and still I want, my hand beyond the cover
I understand his desire, the punishment becomes lust
Sends us both into ecstasies, for him it was the last
For me it is the beginning
