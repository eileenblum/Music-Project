Am I content? yes I am, am I content? no, that's not my true self
I was imagening it, can we only live like this?
You can't handle the loss of your soul, so anybody is just fine for you
Trying to get away through your lust
Don't leave me alone, don't kill me
Everything that you'll remember is your truth
It might change after some time
Is that the truth? It was your wish
Desolation, death, return to nothing
That's what you wish for, that's your reality
What is reality?
Your world, the time and space around
Where you make the decision what you see and accept
The will to live or the wish to die, it's your decision
Afraid of disappearing, 'cause there's no use for me
We are all the same, we share the same missing part
The reason why we want to become one
And so become complete
Because it's the only chance to survive?
Don't leave me, don't kill me
Do you have the right to exist? what is your true feeling?
I don't know, I guess both
Wishing the end of my anxiety
There's a boundary in your expansion
Everything you feel as yourself is a part of your existence
But still I don't know who I am...
Time flows by, the world is a line of changes
A world of freedom is a world of nothing
Your surroundings and your soul form your shape
But without the others you can't recognize your picture
There can be more than one shape for me
