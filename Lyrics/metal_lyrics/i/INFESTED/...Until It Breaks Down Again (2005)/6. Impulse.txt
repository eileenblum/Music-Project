The death of thousands or one by the hand of men
Countless lives ending at the same time
Leads to a reaction, like a wave, a tremor through the whole
Taking the way to somewhere else
Or maybe staying at its place of birth
Hanging above like a cloud of dust
Waiting to come down, to unload the tension in this scene
You feel it like a shiver, spreading and carrying what's gone
A moment of peace, calm and deaf
Until it breaks down again
It could be a beginning, it should be
But the tightening ends like it began
Time shows us the continuity
Death follows death, for it's one
Something changes, nothing without a reason
And nothing is like it was before
The wave finds the way to our hands
It fades away taking some with it
To create the balance, the silent shadow disappears
And the next hands react
