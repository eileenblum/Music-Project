[performed by InfernÃ¶]Our thrashing metal will send you to hell
Down in the deeps where Lucifer fell
In torment you will eternally stay
With our axes we'll cut and slay

Metal ! Metal Metal !
Metal attack ! 

Awakened by the evil beasts
Your life has become a bloodfeast
We are the nails in your face
We are the evil metal-race

[Repeat chorus]
