So you say the road to the promised land's longer
We need to climb high mountains after having crossed deserts of sand
We now play a game for which we're not the masters
Borderlines are far away, will we ever see our land again

Be not afraid of the night
Can you shout and scream from the dark to the light
For a world in motion
Why do we now feel ashamed
When we lift our fists up high out of the flames
(For) the pride of a nation
Now we follow
Hunt high and low
We won't deceive the spectators of the show

Here is the black, here is the red from the blood of my brothers
Sparkling under the sun
How will I live one more day with their faces into my brain
Here is the dark for the victims of hate and anger
Destroyed in the name of what
Power, greed or honour, our destiny remains the same

Wonderland, shall I ever knock your door one day
Dirty hands and stained faces have still no respite for pain

Be not afraid of the night
Can you shout and scream from the dark to the light
For a world in motion
Why do we now feel ashamed
When we lift our fists up high out of the flames
(For) the pride of a nation
Now we follow
Hunt high and low
We won't deceive the spectators of the show

Here is the black, here is the red from the blood of my brothers
Sparkling under the sun
How will I live one more day with their faces into my brain
Here is the dark for the victims of hate and anger
Destroyed in the name of what
Power, greed or honour, our destiny remains the same
