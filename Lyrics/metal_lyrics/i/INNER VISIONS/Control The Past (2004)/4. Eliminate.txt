Congratulations, you've joined us to play (Alone versus all, be the best or crawl)
And your challengers know the price to pay (The blood has to flow, welcome to the show)
They all have recovered their primitive notions
You'll fall if you don't want to use the same weapons

The arena's ready to receive you (The shield and the sword speak more than the words)
All the spectators are waiting for you (They're chanting your name, you are in the game)
The law of the strongest is the best forever
There's no winner, there're only losers
There's no rule to recall
It's the fight for your life against all

You're the next they want to eliminate
They've chosen that you're the one
There's no destiny, there's no fate
Their law is stronger than the gun
You won't find anyone to get his trust
We're all aggressive and wild
No compassion for the weakest of us
No time to lose, your only alternative is to die

Gladiators of the new millennium (Don't lead into greed, it's not what you need)
Don't know where the danger is coming from (Evil is inside, he knows how to hide)
No friend in the jungle of money and power
The same ones help and crash your shoulders
The game sometimes is for real
The new economic world can kill

You're the next they want to eliminate
They've chosen that you're the one
There's no destiny, there's no fate
Their law is stronger than the gun
You won't find anyone to get his trust
We're all aggressive and wild
No compassion for the weakest of us
No time to lose, your only alternative is to die

The law of the strongest is the best forever
There's no winner, there're only losers
There's no rule to recall
It's the fight for your life against all

You're the next they want to eliminate
