So you are now the master of the world
(Where is your pedestal? Are you sure you can lead us all?)
The one who can defeat Evil
(Thank you to think of us, but you won't have our trust)
There're so many souls to purify
And so many others to hide
To free ourselves from chaos, we'll fight
As long as we are alive

You want to join the dark side of our lands
(But if you are alone, what is the power of your throne?)
Who can answer to your demand?
(Only peace can remain except for the insane)
You know the seeds of freedom need sun
Spray them with water and not with poison
Cathodic tubes can fight the brains
Spirits of freedom remain

Do our lives exist anywhere
Else than inside our minds
Cause the sound of thunder
Disappear behind the lights
You are now close to control the past
With our words and mem'ries, you win at a single cast

Who are the persuaders you employ
(Conspiration of war, but we don't want it anymore)
They used to battle and destroy
(All fed with flesh and blood, hidden under the mud)
We sit down and wait for a new lie
Pray God to have the strength to defy
The one who leads us to suicide
We'll keep our honour and pride

Do our lives exist anywhere
Else than inside our minds
Cause the sound of thunder
Disappear behind the lights
You are now close to control the past
With our words and mem'ries, you win at a single cast
