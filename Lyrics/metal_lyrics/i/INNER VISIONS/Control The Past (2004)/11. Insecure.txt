[Bonus track]

Talk to me now
And express what's sleeping inside your head
Release the claws
There is not always blood on soldiers' blade
Who's frightening you, is your neighbour a bad boy or your best friend
He's smiling to you, but are you able to read what's inside his brain

Now be aware
SuperCop is here watching over you
He's taking care
Of weak souls hypnotized by TV news
Keep up the fear, don't let the big flames of agony be put out
Don't stay in the rear, the corner of your street's the end of your road

This is the last time I feel insecure
If evil's in town, I tumble down
We are free now because I am sure
That we're united as one
This is the last time I feel insecure
I won't cry anymore, I can ignore
And shut up now, I can be hidden
By hundreds and thousands of voices aloud

He is in jail
But do you really know why he's here
He shouts and yells
Then cries cos he can't control his fear
Young innocents, d'you know what we've done to let you live this hell
Dollars and cents know how to give you power, money often smells

This is the last time I feel insecure
If evil's in town, I tumble down
We are free now because I am sure
That we're united as one
This is the last time I feel insecure
I won't cry anymore, I can ignore
And shut up now, I can be hidden
By hundreds and thousands of voices aloud
