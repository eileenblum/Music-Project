Day by day, you build your self destruction
You are too addicted to react
He is your new way to education
Can't you now wake up and face the facts
Turn it off, switch it off
Look what is behind
Sitcoms and comedy
That's not reality
Illusions and fictions
Warp and shake your mind
It's a lobotomy
See the real world with me

You know that you are wasting your time
But this screen is hypnotizing you
You don't see that he's changing your mind
Big Brother's watching you
He's watching you

Earth is too heavy between your fingers
But you think you can control it all
Master the fight between saints and sinners
But your brain is washed with rock'n roll

Turn it off, switch it off
And open your eyes
It's driving you insane
Real life is not a game
Trust no one, it's no fun
Corruption and lies
There's nothing else but shame
And we are all to blame

You know that you are wasting your time
But this screen is hypnotizing you
You don't see that he's changing your mind
Big Brother's watching you
He's watching you
