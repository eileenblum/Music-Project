One more night to lay down here
With my eyes watching the sky
Praying the day won't come
As long as time goes by
I'm looking through the infinite
Like the other nights, I cry
I choose a star for me
For you, the brighter one

If I prefer to take it not too far from mine
What will it change, my life is not yours
Give me the strength to believe that the sun will shine
Without reflecting your shadow above me through the clouds

I am still believing in yesterdays
As I believe in tomorrows
I revel in my happiness
And wallow in my sorrows
I cry in my sleep when my dreams are bad
Praying for some rest for a while
Though my nightmares make me feel sad
I'll wake up with a smile

I reinvent the history
That you wrote for a later time
As if for you and me
The present was a crime
I taste again tenderly
The pleasures of the night
Are you afraid of me
When I hold you so tight

Can you wait where the sea becomes an ocean
Can you forget a life of harm and pain
Let us unify ourselves once under the sun
Can we feel better if we join together again

I am still believing in yesterdays
As I believe in tomorrows
I revel in my happiness
And wallow in my sorrows
I cry in my sleep when my dreams are bad
Praying for some rest for a while
Though my nightmares make me feel sad
I'll wake up with a smile
