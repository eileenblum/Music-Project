Fire the lights, don't look back 'til you're here
Break out the winds that sweep away all the fears
Can't stop the tears that still bleed on the whole of us
Your eyes just know how to see the outside of us

Not the inside
Catch all my dreams if you can
I may be blind
I'll never get insane

(Oh, oh, oh, oh) From the road to heaven
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Where life ends and begins
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We'll know how to cross the oceans
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) When we'll be kings

We'll speed up the nights to get drunk on your light
We'll learn the art of war to stand up for our rights

We'll chant your name
Head up to one and only way
We want to claim
To save us all today

(Oh, oh, oh, oh) From the road to heaven
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Where life ends and begins
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) We'll know how to cross the oceans
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) When we'll be kings
