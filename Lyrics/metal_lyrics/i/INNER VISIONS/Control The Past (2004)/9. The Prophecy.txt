Defying the legacy of ancients
We have crossed the deserts and the seas
Leaded by the whispering of angels
We've found those who teach the prophecy

Build your own destiny
Be the only master of your life
And your enemy
Will fall at your feet and die

A new day is dawning
A new sun's raising up so high
To spread the healing
For your hearts and souls
A new time is coming
Follow me, don't close your eyes
The prophecy is giving
Peace and love for all

Listen to the voice of the messenger
We all have a long long time to save
The oracles will make ourselves wiser
They will help us all to be much brave

Under a brand new sky
We will find at last another day
Together we'll try
To follow a better way

A new day is dawning
A new sun's raising up so high
To spread the healing
For your hearts and souls
A new time is coming
Follow me, don't close your eyes
The prophecy is giving
Peace and love for all
