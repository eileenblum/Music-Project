[Music and lyrics: Bruno Masulli]

"Only etterne, and I eternal last!"
"Through me the ways among the people lost"
Hard to understand, show me who they are!
Words of agony resounded through the air without a star

Slaves of themselves, martyrs of the lies
Revelations, believers in disguise
Through this way we go, to the city dolent!
Holy sentence of the great refusal, he has no repent!
No repent!

Hear the voice of souls into fetid plains of insanity
Evil eyes of perverse ecstasy
And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands
Ululations of despair across the lands

Reign of sadness, no infamy or praise
Horrid confusion, abandoned in disgrace
Rage and madness, here there's no innocent
Sacred torment of the great refusal, they have no repent!
No repent!

Spells of imprecation, lost in squalid delight
Disgusting bedlam who were never alive
Miscreants and depraved of the futile identities
God's unwelcome and his enemies! And his enemies

"Through me the way is to eternal dole"
Commingled with that unholy choir of the angel's fall
Expelled from the heavens, nor them the abyss receives
For glory none the damned would have from them

Divine justice, languages of hate
Disdained and envious of every other fate
Through this way we come, to the city dolent!
Holy sentence of the great refusal, they have no repent!
No repent!

No repent, no repent!
