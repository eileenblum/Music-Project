[Music and lyrics: Bruno Masulli]

The last dream is fading away
But I am awake to look what I have around
I am lost but I try to find myself
Thoughts that find reason for being
There's no excuse to give up half of my journey
I have no excuse to stop again
I'm not afraid to be alone
And I know all that is now, will never be

Existence
Existence

I see the world as it really is
And it's at a great distance
Infinite borders that were never reached
I can see the end of life, but I've always known to exist
Shades of life in solitude
Its' sublime, a sweet pleasant face
I reflect in the mirror of my identity
In a perfect world where everything is in its place

Existence
I exist, I'm in pain

Existence
I will live, I exist

Existence
I exist, I'm in pain

Existence
Existence, I exist!

Nothing is what it seems
No exceptions
Alone in silence, I watch what I've seen
I may be wrong
I tell the truth
Through the eyes of innocence, I still look away

The last dream is fading away
I can say I did what I could
Everything flows, everything will die
And I live my life, I know it's the only one
I can't go back, I did not waste my time
My fate follows me
I don't pretend to be understood
But let me live with all my distant memories
