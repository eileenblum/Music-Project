[Music and lyrics: Bruno Masulli]

Through the gates of pain 
Land of the wasted souls 
Point of no return, stench of misery 

Condemned to eternity 
Leave any hope of death 
Waiting for every man who fears no god 

Voice of desperation 
Inglorious existence 
Screams of endless hate, tears of suffering 

Legions of souls 
Sinners with no remorse 
They are forever lost in that black air of death 

No forgiveness, no salvation for them 
Resignation and pain 
They have no hope of death 
No hope of death! 

Visions of castigation 
Malicious sounds of hell 
Accents of terror, words of blasphemy 

Lost into eternal storm 
Betrayers of the past 
Eternal ways of pain, out of reality 

No forgiveness, at the end of the light 
Unbelievers of pain 
They have no hope of death 
No hope of death!
