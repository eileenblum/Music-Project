[Music and lyrics: Bruno Masulli]

You are alive
Eyes of unlimited forgiveness
Now everything runs slow
Realize
Painful questions, but no answers
Words of those who no wait for more

Your resignation, confused words of silence and death

Justify
The silent sorrow of your tragedies
Distressing signs of decay
You was alive
Dreams of wonderful existence
Epilogue of who asks nothing in return

Abandonment and desperation, tears on your hands
Scream of the silence, a cry of the soul
You feel the dignity of solitude,
The dignity of solitude,
Dignity of your solitude,
The dignity of solitude
