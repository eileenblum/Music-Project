Here is your time
close to your silent answers
Into the lies you will find your repent
There is no time
Wait for the final sentence
visions of fate, you just remember the past
last part will come
And you will primed for this
The life has gone
The voice of pain, victim of your destiny

So was your time
The existence of silence
The secret face, words of hypocrisy
Two lifeless eyes
tears of isolation
you canât go back, you know you did what you wanted
In the end of time
What can you want again?
Look at your life, look at your life, itâs your destiny

Hear your desperate cry
Forever lost in oblivion
Take all your desires
Did you knew what you had to know?
What do you have left?
The reflections of loneliness
Can you avoid it?
The condemnation of memories
