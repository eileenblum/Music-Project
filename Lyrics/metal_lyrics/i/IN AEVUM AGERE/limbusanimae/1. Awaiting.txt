Iâve lived
An endless fall
a voice within
the last words Iâm not understanding
rise above, I touched my soul
never mind! Iâve dreamed and Iâve tried and tried

A memory
my hope dies away
the reality
Darkness, on life is descending
I feel cold, a soundless voice is calling
And I live my pain, expression of melancholy
Oh Iâm awaiting

Now the voice of time is calling
And I say my last goodbye
Now/ see the veils of time are falling
I tell you/ I say: the silence will make me understand
At last! I know I will meet myself

Awaiting
I wait
Awaiting
Awaiting!
