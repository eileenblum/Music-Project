Round of the silent regret
Monotony and sadness
Edge of the abyss, here comes the pain
Circle of the innocent souls
The gate of anti-inferno
They had no hope, they are excused from martyrdom
Land of the eternal lament
The souls in the limbo
No condemnation, they lived with no sin

See in their eyes of distress, a quiet resignation
Sufferers of the ungratified desires
World of blameless despair, the holy retribution
Tragic affliction and mercy for the damned
Away from the deepness of pain, of solitude and darkness
In this place there is no punishment
Joined to destiny, the impossible redemption
Walking in the garden of innocence

Journey through the shadows of regret
Souls in limbo! Souls in limbo!
Children of the silent existence
Suspirantes animae limbi simul sunt!
Rising from the darkness, hear the voice who breaks the silence of pain
The souls in limbo!
