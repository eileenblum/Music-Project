I am a spirit of darkness
Iâm breathing of silence,
the call of nothingness

Son of a hopeless existence
Iâm a sufferer of life,
Iâm ignored by contentment

Dreams of despair
dialogues of silence into my shading life
My eternal fright in pain

Iâm the mystic orator
Iâm the slave of the past,
Iâm the master of failures

Last of my dream is dying
my life is fading, my life is ending

Dreams of despair
Dialogues of silence to my shading life
my eternal fright in pain

Your life has gone, you are crying, you are staring
My darkness
Trust in a different fate, a different way
You are heeding
The voice of death
Challenge of existence, charge to understand
My sadness
Waiting in affliction, you know it
life is sorrow
My screams of pain

Iâm a fallen shape
A restless soul
closed lying faces, deep inside my head
Iâm the voiceless pain flows away
Iâll give all my answers and ..
Iâm

I am a spirit of darkness
a cry of illusion
The inventor of sadness

The last of my hope is dying
My voice is falling my choice is nothing

Dreams of despair
Dialogues of silence in my painful life
my eternal fright in pain

Your life has gone, you are crying, you are staring
My darkness
Trust in a different fate, a different way
You are heeding
The voice of death
Challenge of existence, charge to understand
My sadness
Waiting in affliction, you know it
Life is sorrow
My screams of pain
