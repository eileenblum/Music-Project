Eyes all around, voices from the unknown
into darkness you hear to call your name
You are turning back for despair nothing you see

Quick is your breath, raises your silent fear
you think cannot save you from your fate
Finders of soul wait for you, they judge for your sins

Thousand of words
thousand of thoughts
Explanations away from the pain
You try to react but your mind and your hands are unchained

You are alone, youâre out of control
deep inside you a deafening silence
Accused for your vain existence, you are guilty to exist

Eyes of fate, endless time of pain
Eyes of clemency, lies in pain

Falling illusion, dark side of fate
out of a dreamless mind there is no way
Hopeless eyes to your uncertain doom
wait for ending of this inhuman torment
Your existence, your silent wait
all your authentic reasons descent
Hate inventors indict your soul
you know that is their iniquitous judgement

Eyes all around, voices from the unknown
into darkness you hear to call your name
You are turning back for despair nothing you see

You are alone, you are out of control
deep inside you loud screaming of pain
You are judged and condemned to eternity

Eyes of fate, endless time of pain
Eyes of clemency, lies in pain
Eyes of leniency, lies in pain
