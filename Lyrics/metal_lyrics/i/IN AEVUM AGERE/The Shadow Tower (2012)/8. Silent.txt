Silent
my failing way to my darkened light

Silent
deep inside my pain

Silent
my lonely breath, I feel broken my heart

Silent 
a touch of time that fades

Silent 
a voiceless thought justifies my life

Silent 
I leave behind my pain

Silent
I my open hurts and the dreams of the life

Silent
I look belong my way

I write my words on leaves of sadness
I sign my real thoughts of pain
see the day when I could be that I was

I can see the edge of darkness
meet the image of me into mirror of fate
I would dream again and my life just fades away

Silent
