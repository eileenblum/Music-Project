A voice is calling me
I understand you are in my inner voice
into your eyes I wish you well
My hand into your hand
I close my eyes and I hear your breath
I live awhile what I remember

I stay alone
Iâm reading into your sweet and hurting face

Your calling voice is near
your sweetness call of accuracy
I asked you why life fades away
So many memories in me
trees and flowers and your harmony
Your strength, your brave, your wary answers

I stay alone, again
I have not excuse to escape in pain
I hear your failing words of hope and pain

I live the day or wait my destiny (and refute the destiny)
overwhelming the fear inside before the pain
Fades away my reality
understanding the ways of life with the last farewell

Fading ways of fate
your open eyes of serenity
Your simple smile into my hardest days
I hear your calling voice
a different world all around to me
The things are changed
my dreams are forever

Live the day of reality
Live the days my destiny
Before my destiny
This is my reality
Understanding the ways of life
