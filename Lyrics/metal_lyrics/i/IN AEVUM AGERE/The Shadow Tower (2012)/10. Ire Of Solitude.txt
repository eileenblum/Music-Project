I got mind control
I got my thoughts and sorrowful answers
Desperate cry of soul
out of the flesh, Iâm not dying

Iâm drifting away
Iâm the pain, Iâm a darkness dancer
I explain my dreams and I scream
Iâm trying for that higher

Falling to the end
burning my sorrow, my raising anger
Closing impressive in me
shades of the human desire

Awakening of the soul
feeling the pain, feel my deadly silence
Depth of existence
dead of my voiceless defiance

Speaking about the death
speaking of tormented life is ending
Faces of despair
eyes of dissent, eyes of liar

Lost and vain my hope is waning, I feel my rage and fear
Enthralled by sorrow
I open my eyes, Iâm afraid to breathe

An only way, the only word I know to escape from my solitude
Cross the ways of lying suggestion, manic frustration the last defence
Confused is my reaction to understand the world outside
No trust, no wait, no lies, I am the solitary dreamer
Donât need to make myself to useless waiting of society
Wasting time to hypocrisy leading my head to devastating reality

Hope!
The first for pain, the last to die
the silence fell
Fault!
Thatâs my isolation, it cannot lie
Belong my pain
Call!
hymn of misery, voice of distress
The Soundless bell
Oh!
Ire of regret, tales of this life
The eyes will tell

I got mind control
I got my thoughts and sorrowful answers
Desperate cry of soul
echo of my scream breaking silence

Iâm driftin away
Iâm the pain, Iâm the darkness dancer
I explain my dreams and I scream
Iâm flying to try for the harder


Speaking about the death
speaking of tormented life is ending
Faces of despair
Eyes of dissent, eyes of liar
