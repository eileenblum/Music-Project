Il Poema illusorio

Wide your mindless eyes
words of despair, views of the world demise
Lying salvation for human being doomed to fail

Into a heart of stone
secret moods and unvoiced faults
Noiseless confusion through even parts want prevail

Depth of darkest side
of evil and greed, the madness sign
The blinding light of redemption puts out again

Raise the evil call
you are a victim youâre ready to fall
Words of damnation just wait for your holy pray

Useless to show your hurts, your dreams are falling
you are not sensitive to the eyes of world

A piedi nudi sui rovi della falsitÃ

Tell me something you can tell
Non indurre te stesso verso la rinuncia
Give your answers
Non temer la vita, essa non Ã¨ ancora alla fine
Tell me all that you can tell

Weakening flesh of lies
failing soul for eternal life
Signs of resignation of pain and death

Depth of darkest side
of hate and injustice and pain to blind
You find human explanations into your hands

Sgomentato dallâegoismo e dallâodio
Give your answers
Contempla i luoghi dove vâÃ¨ il dolore
Tell me all that you can tell
Tu sei nel giusto, tu sei nellâerrore

Tell me something you can tell

Existence that you see
nothing is less that youâre search for your pain

Suffering that you feel
sorrow and unleashed delight

Misery, scent of death
hopeless fate or useless cry of decay

Reality that you see
endless light of your desires

Wide your mindless eyes
thoughts of despair, face of compromise
You know your true condemnation of existence

Spreads a heart of stone
secret moods of unvoiced faults
Pledge interventions of false benevolence

Hopeless a desperate cry of affliction
do you find what you search? Can you save your soul?
