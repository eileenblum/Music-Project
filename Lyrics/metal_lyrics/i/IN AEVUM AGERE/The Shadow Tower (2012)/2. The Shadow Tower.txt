In my darkest torment
tears of blood are falling in solitude
Anything is silence
and my pain is stronger than fear
I believe in nothing
and my eyes watch no more
Imprisoned in a shadow tower 
my agony has just begun

Iâm a ghost, Iâm a dying presence
and my voice is strong no more
Into a noiseless sign of existence
my memories donât want die 

Time has gone so fast and I live the past  
my life has passed away 
Into ethereal trials of my reality
I breathe my pain

I cannot hear
I donât want hear
what is the truth I need to know?

Veils of sadness
cover my loneliness
I swear, Iâll close my heart
Iâll not reveal my pain no more 

My life of darkness
My tears of nothingness
my broken heart, my skin so cold 

I donât want hear
I have no fear
nobody knows my pain and Iâll not reveal it no more

I close my life
