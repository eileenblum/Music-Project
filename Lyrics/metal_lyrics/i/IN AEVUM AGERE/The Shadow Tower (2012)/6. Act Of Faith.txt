Trust that you see, real control
two-faced, words of mercy, holy pray to spell
Lying liturgy filth of soul
tortured mind of faith, insane, in pain

Make your true belief, a fictitious God
Convict of indulgence
false deliverance
Divine ambiguity, human creed
Failing existence, obey in vain!

Unreal means to be
Final ecstasy
Ascend your cross of pain
Whoâs write your fate?

Hellish legacy, burning souls
rhymes of blasphemy, enemies of truth
Mystic lunacy, cruel acts, vengeance is mine, you are the damned!

Imaginary way
Pray for real salvation
Save you soul from sin
Unleash the reality
The ultimate solution
you wash your sins with blood
They want an Act of Faith?
Act Of Faith
The Act Of Faith

Domine, nostras culpas parce
Ad lucem spei et aeternae vitae
Es Deus unus atque solus
Creator caeli et terrae

With flesh and blood baptized to sacrilege
two Godless eyes are closing
Chalice of mortal, condemned humanity
Mentally hurt and blinded

Holy hypocrisy unsacred call
fanatic texts of spirit sign and rule the weak
Burning cross of death
spreads the hate
Failing human way, you obey in vain!

Unreal means to be
final ecstasy
Whoâs the chosen one?
Unleash the reality
the ultimate solution
You wash your sins with blood
you do an Act of faith

Act Of Faith
The Act Of Faith

Domine, nostras culpas parce
Ad lucem spei et aeternae vitae
Es Deus unus atque solus
Creator caeli et terrae
