I stare my silence I feel my pain
I know my existence I know as well
my painful thoughts, I was able to love again

Iâve got my dreams they complete myself
Any sense of reality
closing in solitude, thatâs the voice of my faults

I breathe the scent of darkness
I discover my pain of existence

Leave me alone
Leave me alone

If you could try to understand
my screaming words of solitude
Close to my thinks and to my waiting dreams

My open door to comprehension
my open eyes of revelation
I just wait for a little bit of unconditional care

Iâm goinâon, just leave the pain behind
Iâm just looking for a chance
Kisses and tears of commotion, free will into loneliness
Human pain or inhuman pain
what is really changed in me?
Screaming voices and dark spaces covering with emptiness

I breathe the scent of darkness
I heed the voice of silence
I live between evil and death!

I donât ask you to understand
Iâm not forcing you to respect my thoughts
you can listen to me or leave me alone

I donât want your useless words
I donât need of your mercy
you can listen to me or leave me alone
