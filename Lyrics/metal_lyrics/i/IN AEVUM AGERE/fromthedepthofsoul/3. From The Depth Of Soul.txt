I close my eyes and I feel my sadness
So I really can to see
Whereâre the things Iâm pretending
I hold the frost of reality

A breath, my thoughts in contemplation
Scars and not healing hurts
Human faults, human creations
I make my world of dreams apart

All my of dreams of early life live again theyâll never die
As sweet touch of harmony
From the depth I hear a call itâs the voice of my soul
Itâs a beautiful melody

Iâm alive and Iâve got my mind control
I give my answers
True is my pain, my anxiety, my existence
I write my fate following my soul
Please forgive me I donât see the end
Of that is not, it will be then

Trap of existence

My life is just begun Iâll forgive the suffered evil
I will pleased to give my real well for a dying soul
Shall be done for me? Silent hope to tomorrow?
After the end Iâll know
Meaning of the death, from the depth of soul

Closed my eyes refuge of madness
To find the real mean to be
Image to mirrors of uniqueness
I discover in me my identity

Raging words of resignation
So Iâm still in solitude
Human fault of isolation
I leave myself free to choose
