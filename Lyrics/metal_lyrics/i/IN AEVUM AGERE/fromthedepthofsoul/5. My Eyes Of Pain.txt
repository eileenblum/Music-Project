I hear my heart to beat at call of a silent scream 
A failing voice of loneliness (existence)
If my hurts could heal and fill
The emptiness, itâs around of me

A silent voice a desperate cry of soul
So many tears go down as falling leaves
Into my darkness I meet the real truth
I take my hands to unknown
Iâm waiting for the end

Nothing to say, (I breathe my pain)
I donât believe, I donât want know it
Iâm free to exist
Iâm free to live with my pain (into my pain)

Iâm alive and my dreams are rising
A human hope as companion of misery
Iâm alone and a hope is rising
Still is rising a falling memory

Iâm alive and  my hopes are rising
Breathing my sorrow creeps  into my heart
My eyes of pain stare a dying
Stare a  dying, a dying reality

I feel my heart to wait for a sweetness call
A gentle voice will wipes my eyes of pain
Into my blackness
I see the light of truth
Inside of me I feel
My blood flows through my veins
