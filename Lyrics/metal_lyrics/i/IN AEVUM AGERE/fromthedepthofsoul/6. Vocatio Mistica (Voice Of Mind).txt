ARCANA SPECIES APPARET
HUMANA CUPIDITAS ORÃTUR
VOX MENTIS VOCAT
INTERIORES OCULI IN AETHERIOS FINES VERSI SUNT
NULLUS PUDOR CLAMANDI
NULLUS TIMOR VIVENDI
SILENS AULEUM LENTE APERITUR
POTEST FIERI UT LIBERI SUMUS

Voice of my soul joined to my mind control
Says to my thinks to wait in silence
I wait for my soul I search for the way
Iâll find the real mean to be

Lost into anguish my mind give birth to
Mystic creations of fire
Belong to me there are thousand ways
The heart of existence

Unknown is my fate, I go for my way
I donât will wait the final sentence
Iâm not afraid to stay alone
Iâm the voice of my mind

Take my hand, you are alone
Leave me free
Iâm the cure, Iâm your only voice
I am the way
Iâm here, Listen to me
You are my fears
What do you searching for?
Reality!

Voice of my soul discovers my dreams
Voice of my mind keeps me alive
Demons of mind are waiting for me
I open the eyes of inside
A human temptation is born again
Voice of mind is calling
Eternal pain, ethereal doom
for human mortality

Take my hand, you are falling down
Leave me free
Iâm the cure, Iâm your only choice
I am  the way
Iâm here, come with me
Iâm stay alive
Your are in me, hear me
Donât take my soul you are my loneliness
You are alone, Iâm here, follow me
You are my fears
Iâm the cure, Iâm your only voice
What is your way, your choice, your refuge
Reality!

Iâm  trying  to understand meaning of life
In a world of pain it is burning into lie
There is not a reason to deceive my mind
Trying my truth with the repent
I donât wait to be entrapped by my mind
Iâam not afraid of my darkest side
Fear and pain belong the ways of life
I try for it with no defence

Voice of my soul joined to my mind control
Says my thinks to wait in silence
I wait for my soul I search for the truth
The real mean to be

Meaning of life of pain and despair
Are explained by our existence
Rising inside from the ashes of life
Beyond the human insanity
