Rest in pain, without your faith
Your eyes are staring the emptiness

Eternal sleep, into depth of silence
Did you have a chance to seize the day?

Your hurts that bleed
And your hands are scared and cold
Your cry towards the nothingness

On my knees your face of sorrow
Time has gone donât look back again

Wasted is the time to absolve your soul
Ashes to ashes, damnation! (Resignation!)
Fall into darkness expiate for your faults
Death is reality youâve got it you know to exist
Lost is your reality forsake to eternal life*

No one answer
No one hope for human sin
It surrounds you â¦

... Deserted in a world of pain (you cannot see the end)
Surrounds you
Eternal life is not in your destiny
