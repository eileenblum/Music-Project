Echo of the voices
I come to tell the eternal dark
Shadow of unknown
I discern the sins of mankind
I tell the pain
I am the darkness
Nothing I hear
Silence is falling to me

Iâm the voice of unending pain
I bring the suffering beingâs novel
you will pay for your vain existence
You will pay for the sins
Iâm the voice of Human damnation
I am the darkness teller

Silence has fallen, the voice of the pain
Nothingness and existence, the eternal ways
Solitude and torment, the mourning to spell
Emptiness and darkness, the endless frames

Signs of damnation
I met the light in a world of sadness
Misery and greed
I heard the angels lament
I tell the pain
I am the darkness
Nothing I hear
Silence is falling to me
My hands are bleeding
I know the evil
A cry I hear
I am the darkness, Iâm here

DOLORIS SINE FINE VOX SUM
HOMINUM GENERI NUNTIUS DOLORIS FERO
OB VESTRAM VITAM INANEM LUETIS
OB VESTRAS CULPAS LUETIS
HUMANAE POENAE VOX SUM
TENEBRARUM NARRATOR SUM
