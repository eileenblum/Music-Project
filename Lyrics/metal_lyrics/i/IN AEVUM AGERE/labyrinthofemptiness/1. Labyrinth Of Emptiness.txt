Fails
Unquestionable ways of the pain
Around the evil Iâm closing in
I ask for aid
And no body answers me
A lament
A cry has broke the silence
I see the concrete lighting
Out of darkness I escape from my loneliness

Lost
In the labyrinth of emptiness
Where the people disguises
all the wicked thoughts and intentions
Imprisoned
In the cage of the promises
Where the truth is denied
Good and evil are the depth of the human fears

Fate
Useless way of the pain
I see the nothingness behind of me
Waiting and running for my never ending quest
Staring
The days of life are fading
I feel my mind away
Iâm living in my dreams and in my memories

[Chorus]

Fails
Unquestionable ways of the pain
Around the evil Iâm closing in
I ask for aid
And no body answer me
A lament
A scream has broke the silence
Into the of human torment
Only one second of my happiness
