If they told you how to breathe
Would you do it then?
Would you do it like they said because they know?
And you're just you
You petty thing
Hey, this one is for free:

I can tell you how to live
But I cannot live it for you
You're no friend
The worst is yet to come

It's the way you wield your pen
It's obvious you have not created nothing on your own!
You piece of shit
You rest assured
Your time has gone

I can tell you how to live
But I cannot live it for you
Place your stakes
The worst is yet to come

Er sÃ¥ fyllesjuk

I can tell you how to live
But I cannot live it for you
Be aware
The worst is yet to come
