I'm flattered by your admiration
But kind sir; stop the charades
It doesn't do you good
Though the feedback's been potent
All your embarrassing ways
Leave you short of dense

I know it's not what you wanted
But, and I rest my case
You did it to yourself
You know that the girl is convincing
So trust me, I did my best
But I couldn't help myself

If all my hope is lost because of you
And that hate thing
If all your petty threats on me were true
Then I'm waiting for you

If all my actions were perceived as cruel
Then I meant them
If jealousy turns you into a fool
Then I'm waiting for you
