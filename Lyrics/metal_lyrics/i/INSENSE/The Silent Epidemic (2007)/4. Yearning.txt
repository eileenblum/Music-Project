It's OK to laugh now
Nobody knows how
Watching with dead stares
Nobody that cares

We've been cut off from feelings
Emotional ruins
Yearning for stardom
And parties in Sodom

Liberated
-Go! You're free!

Grade As and excess
Scavenge for status
I commend your spirits
Always the critics

Excuse me for prying
I love you for trying
Applauds for the effort
You're gorgeous

But I'm sick of this liberation

Free at last
