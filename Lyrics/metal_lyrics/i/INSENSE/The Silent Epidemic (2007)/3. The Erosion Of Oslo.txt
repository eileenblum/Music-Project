There's a Satan
Let there be no doubt
A vile maggot
There's no way out

Fighting a lost war

The dark frenzy
Of free enterprise
Fuels a fire
That refuses to die

A vile maggot
Real estate undead

Erosion of our capital
The destruction of Oslo

Turn back

Turn away
There's nothing more to gain
Turn away

Turn away
Servants of the fifth deadly sin
Turn away

This is all there is
There's nothing after this

Turn away
If this is really it
Then weâll wait
-We will wait

I will honour your demise
With my signature in yellow snow
Like a pentagram around your grave
I will marinate your goddamn remains
