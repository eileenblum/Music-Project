It's in your blood, don't deny it
It's in your blood, don't deny it
The easy way out is the right way
-The wrong way

It's all about class
And the way you try to avoid it
It's not saving the scene
Instead we teach our children to drown

It's in your clip, don't deny it
It's in your clip, don't deny it
The formula sticks, you're a winner
The formula sticks
-You lose

Wave bye-bye...

A cultural passing
A demise

Why do we even bother?!?

It's all about class
And the way you try to avoid it
Skinned of all pride
We wave artistic diversity goodbye
