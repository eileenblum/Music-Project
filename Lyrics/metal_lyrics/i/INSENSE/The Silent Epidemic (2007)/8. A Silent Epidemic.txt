It's everything that you thought you knew about joy
And everything that you hope to live through
Remember the stars and learn their names by hand
Your pride is the stump you call a soul

It's just like porn - you know you've seen too much
When a2m don't impress you anymore

It's everything that you thought you knew about war
And everything that they hoped to tell you
The TV screen flashes as cities ignite
You're in charge in your blood red recliner

A family dead, "...and now on a lighter note"
So, was it four or five? One for each remote

How come you sit there and stare
Like I knew you would?
How many lives must it take?
The stars still shine

How many necks must they break?
We're all dead inside
An infotainment mistake
The stars still shine

It's everything that you thought you knew about joy
And everything that you hope to encounter
The newest craze is a girl just coming of age
On the street and in the yellow pages

It's just like porn - you know you've seen too much
When DP is nothing but a crutch
