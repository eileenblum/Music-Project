Whore
You keep coming back for more

It's time
To turn water into wine
Disappear into the shadows
In desperation, desolation

It's way past time
As the ground beneath you burns
As truth, the rusty nail,
Carves Xs in your flesh
It's alive

It's time
There's a witch hunt in this town
You proudly lead the procession
As you left your soul behind

It's way past time
As the ground beneath you burns
Repentance due
I'll have you cleansed
And then baptized in fire

The daily pornograph
Tells you what to feel
Communion finds you drenched
Crusade or dud beliefs
-They're not real

Kneel before your saviour
"Forgive me father I have sinned
I should have let you in"

"Forgive me client
From now on everything I do
Revolves around you"
