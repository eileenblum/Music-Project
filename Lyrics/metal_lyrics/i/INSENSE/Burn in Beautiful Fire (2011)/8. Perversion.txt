Trust me
I've had a crappy year
Realizing the worst of my fears
A nightmare that I'm forced to live through
Must I clip my nuts to survive

Perversion
Pervert
Perversion
Yeah, yeah

Manners are just a social skill
I have learned how to get my will
Caress her with my insect hands
She's making love to the dead

Perversion
Pervert
Perversion
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Why now?
I had hope
Help me
Don't make me beg
Why now?
I had hope
Why me?

Smiling but I'm dead inside
The madonna-whore that I hide
Insurgent refuse to fall in line
Benumb of fear

Perversion
Pervert
Perversion
Yeah, yeah
