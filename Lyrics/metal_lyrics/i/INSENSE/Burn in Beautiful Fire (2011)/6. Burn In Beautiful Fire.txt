Southbound in the end
No escape, no absolution
It's subtraction
Take the good, minus the bad and there's your grade
Well you lied
Say your last goodbyes
You swore
Say your last goodbyes

You cheat, you lie, you steal
You fornicate, you drink, you're high, you're doomed
It's summed up when you die
I guess it's not so bad
Cause I wouldn't look no good with angel wings anyway
Just give me something with a...
A smokestack and heat and color
Burn in beautiful fire
Yeah

Southbound in the end
No escape, no absolution
It's subtraction
Take the good, minus the bad
It doesn't really matter what you feel is right
So say your last goodbyes
