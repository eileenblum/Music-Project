It is too hard for you to see
That in this world we live in
There is no way back and no way forward
Refute it what you will
Life itself has betrayed you
It's an unwelcome dance of social mores that is your woe

It's another failing game
Your woe
There's no way out
No way out of here

Let the zombie go forth
Let him spew out his poison
Let him sway their minds to form an opinion
And let the public decide, what is best for everyone
A Utopian dream as dumb as the next one
There are our woes

It's another failing game
Our woes
There's no way out
No way out of here

It's another failing game
There's no way out
No way out of here

It's another failed game
There's no way out
No way out of here
No way out
