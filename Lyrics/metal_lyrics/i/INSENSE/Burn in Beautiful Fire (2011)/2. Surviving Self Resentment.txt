Waking, waking, waking, waking...
Waking up, in a pile
Drab curtains hide the graying sky outside
Thick in my head, weights it down
Sleepy eyes won't wake up today
So alive and yet I feel so dead inside

A withered branch, a tired face
If no one comes, it's OK.
I don't care to socialize today
Much less smile

Hurt me once, once again!
This pale shell, pathetic don't you think?
Mirrors don't lie, your a joke!
Dumb fucker with an attitude!
Look down in shame,
It's hard to find someone else to blame
You're stuck with me
I'll bring you up to speed!

Cause you've got no class
You've got no style
You've got no education worthwhile
You've got no friends, well you got me
To make you comfy in your misery

No quality genes to pass along
No sense of purpose you could call your own
A withered branch on the family tree
With any luck this line will stop with me
It's the withered branch on the family tree
With any luck this line will stop with me
God how I love...
Days like these!!!
