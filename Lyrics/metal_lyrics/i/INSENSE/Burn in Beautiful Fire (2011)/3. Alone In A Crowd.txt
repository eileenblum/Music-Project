The night, is set for social bonding
I stay close, as she would want me to

You'd think I'd like it
You'd think I'd like it, but no

The dialogue, as if they know me
Superficial woes.

You'd think I'd like it
You'd think I'd like it, but no

I just don't want to be
In this place where I don't belong
I'm not cut out for this
All the smiles and the pleasantries

I just don't want to be
In this place where I don't belong
It's plain for all to see
That I feel trapped alone in a crowd

Chirpy sounds of girlfriends gossiping
About newlyweds and stupid fashion things

You'd think I'd like it
You'd think I'd like it, but no

Their corresponding males
make me uneasy and feel out of place

You'd think I'd like it
You'd think I'd like it, but no

I just don't want to be
In this place where I don't belong
I'm not cut out for this
All the smiles and the pleasantries

I just don't want to be
In this place where I don't belong
All the faces I see
They are nothing but strangers to me
