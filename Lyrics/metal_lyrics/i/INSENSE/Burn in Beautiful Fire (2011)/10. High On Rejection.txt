On the right track
A man adored and set for success
(that's how you see yourself)
A dark and demon-ridden,
Troubled soul lest the truth be known

You're no good
You're a special and complicated man of poise
(with a death wish)
Because life has no meaning you speak like you're dying
Of course you haven't thought things through

What would you do if she gave you a choice
And promised that it wouldn't hurt?
Would you let it go or chicken out?
I think you would

You're no good at life
Succumb to rejection

It's a given you'll live as you'll die alone
(shrivel on your own)
A self fulfilled prophecy years have escaped you
Not realizing that

You were no good
You...
