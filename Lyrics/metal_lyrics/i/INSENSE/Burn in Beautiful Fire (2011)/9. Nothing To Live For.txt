Thank yourself and the growing sense of disdain for your own kin
Remember the ones you left behind
As history has judged you for yours sins
Remember, remember
You deserve all the heartache and grief
No relationship that you could endure
It's time to move on
You've got nothing to live for
It's a social disease
To completely ruin a chance at a life

You've got a nothing to live for
You've got a nothing to live for
Nothing to live for

It's time to move on
You've got nothing to live for
It's a social disease
To completely ruin a shot at
It's time to move on
You've got nothing to live for
It's a pathetic attempt
To completely ruin a shot at
