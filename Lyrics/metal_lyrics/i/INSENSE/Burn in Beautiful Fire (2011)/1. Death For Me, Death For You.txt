It's alive, they celebrate
But i sigh in disappointment, why?

So what if they have started something?
What difference does it make?
Why can't your cold heart just embrace their joy?
If so for their sake?
Why do you fell this nagging need to go the other way?
You introversion makes your corroded soul more hollow every day.

Can instinct really be so cruel and go against the grain?
I mean the outcome of your highest hopes is hard to explain
If words are true and not a front, your need to self obsess
Then I'll say a silent prayer for you and ask forgiveness

Confrontation makes no sense
Inward bitter till the end
Pictures you will never see
Death for you, death for me

Embrace in full of darker parts
Always geared up when it starts
Something you would never do
Death for me, death for you

It's a crime that I cannot commit
Ideas that I cannot permit
A father you will never be
Death for you, death for me

Confrontation makes no sense
Inward bitter till the end
Wallow in you solitude
Death for me, death for you
