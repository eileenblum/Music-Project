Welcome to realm
Of our so strange love
Welcome to the empire
With no rules and gods
We are the prisoners
We are the slaves
Sinking in moral putrefaction
We've had to veil our faces
Curbed, we are curbed
Curb in our teeth
Wild reflections of eyes
We refuse all sexual laws
Piss in your fucking glance
We adore this golden shower
As it sprinkles over your face
Make love with each other
Please penetrate my ass
Party of sodomy
Be members of us
Curbed, we are curbed
Curb in our teeth
Wild reflections of eyes
You've to be naughty
Uninhibited
Lead blow job infantery
Or you should be into curb
You've to be submissive
As we are in fact
No limits are among us
Love is to be spoilt...
Curbed, we are curbed
Curb in our teeth
Wild reflections of eyes
