Born into captivity pledged to the ascendency,
Adopted rituals we perceive,

We have inherited a disease implanted within conditioning,
Consuming a bitter nature created by indoctrination,

Behold a vision of the future hate has nurtured (hate has nurtured),
We are the product of the somatic illusion,

Human life has been raped of innocence,

Reduced to cattleÂ gawking towards a fractured throne,Â 
We breathe the ashes cast away from what we have conceived,Â 
Our plague grows so viciously,Â 
Spread by the human disease.
