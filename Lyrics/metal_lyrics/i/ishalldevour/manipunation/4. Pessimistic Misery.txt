Consume, exalt the fear to expand the hatred of the mind,
Whimper and serve amongst the lands of Â aversion and deceit,

Under the allegiance of your ruling elite,Â 
The conquest of a global nation decides to ignite the spark,
Fear surmounts the population consumed by the mindless herd,

By the majestic power oppressing the liberty of man a freedom which undertook such ugliness,
A sadistic plan was devised within me the pessimistic growth of endless misery,

Corruption systematically rectifies all intent of malevolence,
Oppressing thought with terror there is no equity,
Crowded by this illusion blinded by the fraud that they consume,
We are reformed by the strings of the hierarchy,

Now that you are under their power,Â 
Thy shall fear a shower of pestilence and reign,

By the majestic power oppressing the liberty of man a freedom which undertook such ugliness,
A sadistic plan was devised within me the pessimistic growth of endless misery,

We become the aftermath of Â conditioning to this path we all abide to,
We are enslaved to our own creation; falling into the depths of a surreal fallacy.
