In an age of human re-education,
The masses are enticed to the increment of implicit self-demise,
Malicious ideologies fixated by a herd of the unmindful populace,
In turn we entrap our minds in a form of solitude,
We are here witnessing the story of manipulation to our thoughts from sovereignty,
Consumption of ignorance glorified by the kingdom of convulsing hate x2

Our leaders spectate from their deformed throne,
As they watch in bitter delight corrupt democracy initiates war, chaos and corporal malevolence,
We are part of something horrific, when will we make the change to raise our opinion?
And awaken the actuality of this demoralization to the human race,
We are the start of a newborn freedom.
