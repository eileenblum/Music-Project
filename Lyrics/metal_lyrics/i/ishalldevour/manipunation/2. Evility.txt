A day to day existence has been adapted to,
Subliminal putrefaction from this flowing avarice,

An evil is here to displace all sense of value from this social unity,
Oppressed humanity begs to the monarchy,
They all unknowingly feed on a systems soiled wealth,

Immoral self-indulgence has become of us,

From these depths comes,
Our story of distinction from the rich to the nation,
Our story of depression,
Fuck all hope.

A depressed society begs to the monarchy,
They all unknowingly feed on a systems soiled wealth,
With choices we keep buried from a deflective and spiteful crown,
Our story of distinction from the rich to the nation,
Our story of depression,
Fuck all hope,

A decomposing eden is exhuming the last breath from our chest,

We have the right to comply with ourselves,
This daunting retrospective of our morbid history is turned around.
