A vast land of misconception and constant
misleading blurs the very values you live by,
The hypocritical act that you have pledged
will only give you more guilt as you loose the
fame of what you,
You once had, you become more than enemies,
Spreading this bullshit behind your so called 'friends'
like a plague,
They were sick of you before you started
this shit mouthed trend,
Now itâs over, you will suffer the loss of your pride,
Dressing in your beliefs to obtain the acceptance
of your stereotypical society,
Ignorance will only aggravate the hole that you
have dug for yourself,
Do you feel proud of what youâve made?
It's your own bed, now lay in it,
Now you will be laid to rest.
