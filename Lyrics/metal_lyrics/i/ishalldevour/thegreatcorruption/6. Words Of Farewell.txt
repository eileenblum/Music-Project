Say goodbye to the world you knew,
You canât stop the extinction,
Of this slowly decaying world,
Watch as your civilisation crumbles,
Go forth, go run away,
You canât run from the end,
Your existence has no purpose,
Has no purpose in their eyes,
Go forth, go run away,
In the end you wonât be living,
Take away all remains of life,
You try finding faith in your insignificant god
