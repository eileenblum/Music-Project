How can you believe in such impossibilities?
When you read your book of stories,
Do you ever stop to think that the
words you intake are all lies?
Sit the fuck down, take a look around,
Take a page from the book of reality
before you waste another minute of
being stuck in your ever so perfect world,
Who will you worship once our world has
turned to a prison of torment and suffering?
Welcome to the downfall, say goodbye,
There will be no tomorrow,
This is reality, there is no flawless idol,
I see nothing but corrupt human failures,
Your life is based upon a cowardly father,
The collapse of our kind was the only
thing we ever accomplished,
All wishes for hope have vanished,
We have been abandoned by the
procreator who once cared,
This is the final invitation to a new world of nihility,
The world we once knew has decayed
so fast we didnât have time to revive our existence,
Our way of life is meaningless,
Inside we are all painted red,
Life is overrated,
Existence has been annotated,
Welcome to the downfall, there will be no tomorrow.
