The image, the perfect design humanity has placed upon me,
This thought, I hold so dearly,
The worst is thought of those outside of perfection,
We donât need you spreading your word about their image,
Youâre an infection,
Spewing for your power to forefill your ultimate desire,
Where are the rules for how one should look?
Discrimination, youâre not golden either,
Just a design set to fail like the rest of them,
Prepare for your judgement,
Like the rest you will fall into the hands of another superior,
So there for; In societyâs eyes,
We are Forever Imperfect.
