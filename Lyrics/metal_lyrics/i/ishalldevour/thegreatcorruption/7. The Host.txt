Massacre is beauty in these eyes x2
Lead by our greed and hate,
What will we be when we crumble?
Our first breath, We spread disease,
Buried beneath this waste we created,
Everything that we built,
Everything that we created,
Every thought we have of life,
Every thought we have of perfection,
These are all lies,
We have sealed our fate,
The only thing we built was a failure,
We are all going to be destroyed,
Our Time Is Up,
And it's all our fault.
