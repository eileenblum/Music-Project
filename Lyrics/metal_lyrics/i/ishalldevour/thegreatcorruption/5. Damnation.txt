This is the sound of your end
With swords in hands, thousands march
to conquer this land
Thunderous sounds, wiping out all who stand
In the way of my reign
Your king will cower in fear
Your wife your children will be cast down
Like never before, standing for your beliefs
The scent of death,
You will meet the back of my hand
With the war won and the world
Is torn apart
I only have one coward, to defeat x2
A knife to the throat of a life begging man
I will reign victorious.
