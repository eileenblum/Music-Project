Like lions they carry me
They tear and cut my down, have I wronged? Betrayed?
Or done violence without cause?
If my path is narrow, they sharpen my blade and strength my shield
With all it can endure
So that I may take up my deadly weapon and devour my enemies
He that brings me challenge shall fail
Practice deception and think of evil, but my sword cuts deep
Leave this place where moths and rust destroy and remove yourself from my way
