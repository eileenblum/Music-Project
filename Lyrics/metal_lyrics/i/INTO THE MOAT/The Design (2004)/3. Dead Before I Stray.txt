End me, but I am righteous
Scrutinize my right alone I honor
I am eternal, send my closet rivals
I am omnipotent, send you greatest Spartan
I suffer, but my strength grows
I plummet, but my dread lessens
Hatred is not infectious to all
Where are you sightless
I walk sharp, I am the breath in the storm
I am your conclusion
