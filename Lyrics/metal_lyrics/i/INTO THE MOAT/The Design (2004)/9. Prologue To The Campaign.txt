Prepare these hands for war, these eyes for blackness, and this heart to seep away
All that is suffered, all that is lost
List compared, your sorrow I thirst
Your misery I fail
For I devise the absolute design
Where the fearless reign
Where strength and valor control
This will be war of all wards and it's merely the beginning
This is call to arms...
