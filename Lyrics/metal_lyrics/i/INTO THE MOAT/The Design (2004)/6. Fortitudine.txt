Only now I perceive
Strong is temptation, will I flow with the tides?
Or will I carve my words in stone?
The way ahead, unreachable
Will I let that be?
Live in aimless bliss or never live at all
Will I stand hard against the perilous winds?
I will not wake to regret
I will strive and do so among the mighty
Together we will stand as lions
With no need other than victory
We are prodigious
When fares are faced some would run
Not I
Because I have steel in my fist and brother at my side
