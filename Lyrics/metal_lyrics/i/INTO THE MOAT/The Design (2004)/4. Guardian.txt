Walk ways with me
Forget your sight and follow my hand
Across all seas, through all straits
Until I've failed you
How many heads
How many must I take?
An utter dismay
Through the unbearable
More will be done than holes to be filled
Rank the wine, swallowed the flight drowned in the finest of flesh
And you are still here, forget your fears
Follow me, return to me now
A defender with determination
Seek me
