midway on our lifes journey
I found myself in dark woods
the right road is lost
but the toad stands before me
not the one that leads to the great hand of fraud
but my own
the one I choose to carve out myself
but still threats of dismay plague me
that is where myself will be found
but stronger am I to abandon all of my hope
for I can see the outcome and I shall prevail
