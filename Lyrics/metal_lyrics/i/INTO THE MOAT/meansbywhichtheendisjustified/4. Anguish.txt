these fabrications you put forth on me
they lacerate this soul
I try to run
you sunder me open to see my blood shed
to hear not my pain
merely your own
you sire these avulsions
and I pray for you
to sew these afflictions
with your propaganda
I've seen no veracity
beneath that breast
why do I adhere to your idiocy
I'm only belaboring you
right now
you're nothing
in my eyes
I can now
taste deception
in your heart
you're nothing
see my blood shed
