day in day out
I swallow your devotion
swallow and shine false gratitude
since my being, you,
my possessor, my supposed protector, my greatest love
have provided with not much more than a great deal
of nurture for this seed of abhorrence I call myself
your eyes narrate a story
of ignorance and carelessness
now as I watch you let the only one I care for fall
I crumble inside
no more
take your last breath
and meet the torment that is my life
with these actions you will become
my effigy
no more resistance, all is let loose
for this is a true act of passion and filth
