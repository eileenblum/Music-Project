dwell in the battlefield
pray for my demise
not a soul
can bestow
legend by name
hero by fate
forced to combat
bred as a soldier
follow my command
without any questions
involuntary murder
sent only to kill
I hath no mercy
I survive waiting for that day
the end has found me
only to be reborn again and again
