Voices Talking In The Night
Malevolent Heathen Scum
Never Even Knowing That The Time Has Come To Run

[Chorus:]
Madman - Toying With The Things We Don't Understand
Blindman - Saying The Words Not Meant For Man
Deadman - Saving The Scrolls That Must Be Destroyed
Shadowlord - Your Soul Has Been Cast Into The Void

He Has Lived In The Streets
For 100 Brutal Years
He's Killed His Share
And He's Shed No Tears
Some Might Say He's Evil
Some Will Say He's Vad
But All I Know
Is That He's Fighting Mad

[Chorus]

So Just You Remember
When You Are Out Alone
And The Streetlights Flicker
And You Are Far From Home
Remember He Is Out There
With A Damaged Brain
Remember He Will Kill You
Becasue He Is Insane

[Chorus]

Screams From The Darkness 
The Earth Begins To Quake
Evil Is Around Us
Then The Dead Start To Wake
Voices Of Confusion
Abandoned By Man
He Has The Power
Of God In His Hand
