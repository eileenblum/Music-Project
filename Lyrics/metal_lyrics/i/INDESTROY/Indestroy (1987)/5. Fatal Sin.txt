Sometimes You Feel That
Your Mind Is Split In Two
Like With No Direction
And A Nasty Attitude

Death Takes A Stance Now
You Can See It's Gonna Be A Fight
He Comes To You In All Your Darkest Dreams
Blows Your Mind In The Middle Of The Night

Life Is But A Silly Game
One You Just Can't Win
Life Is But A Fantasy
Made By Fatal Sin
