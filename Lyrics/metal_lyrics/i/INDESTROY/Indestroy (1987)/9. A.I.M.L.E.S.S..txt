I Was Standing All Alone In The Rain
With An Intense Feeling Of Being Sane
I Felt A Flame Burn Inside Of Me
Hoping Someone Would Soon Come Set Me Free
But Time Passed On And It Became So Clear
I Knew That No One Would Find Me Standing Here
Although I Knew That My Conscience Would Carry On
To A Lonely Place Where I I Had Gone

I Was Relieved To Escape The Empty Abyss
The Place Where They Watched Me With Carefulness
As I Approached My Manifest Destiny
A Smiling Demon Said Hell I'll Set You Free
So I Sat Down On The Dirt Closed My Eyes
And The Devil Came Dressed In His Disguise
Morning Came Quickly And I Awoke
To Find Out It All Was A Subtle Joke
