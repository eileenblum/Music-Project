Justice Sucks
I Spit On Cops
They Lock Me Up
You're Busted - For What
Possession
Interrogation
Of A Dangerous Substance

I Was Relaxing By The Falls
I Wasn't Hurting Anyone
And As I Fired Up A Bone
I Found That I Wasn't Alone

You Have The Right 
To Live You Life
If Getting High 
Is Such A Crime
You Have To Decide
For Yourself
If Getting By
Is Worth The Time

Justice Sucks
I Spit On Cops
They Lock Me Up
You're Busted - For What
Possession
Interrogation
Of A Dangerous Substance
