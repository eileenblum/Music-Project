Fields Of Freedom Sown With My Blood
Agent Orange Death From Above
C.C.C.P I See Red
P.M.R.C You're Better Off Dead

My Country Tis Of Thee
Sweet Land Of Anarchy
Lost Souls Can't Be Saved
Cause We're All Living For The Grave
They Try And Tell Me That I'm Free
But Pinko Maggots All I See
Like A Rate Caught In A Trap
You've Been Taking All Their Crap

[Chorus:]
Do What They Say
Just A Slave 
Cradle To Grave
U.S.S.A

Just A Number Another Fool
Brainwashed By Dictator's Rules
Twisted Leaders Twisted Minds
Follow Orders Deaf, Dumb And Blind

Why Can't They Just Let Me Be
Enforcing Laws By Their Decree
Big Brother Is Watching You
Slaughtered Babies Fascist Rule

18 Years Old Enough To Die
Taken Away Don't Ask Me Why
Blind Eyes Backs Against The Wall
Smell Of Vomit In The Torture Hall

Neo-Nazi Fascist Cops
Bash Your Brains Until You Drop
Rapes And Murders Every Day
But Play Too Loud And You Will Pay
Leaders Smile On My T.V
But They Don't Give A Damn About Me
Writing Laws For Mind Control
Try And Make You Fit The Mold

[Chorus:]
Do What They Say
Just A Slave
Cradle To Grave
U.S.S.A
