Play With Fury, Play With Speed
Grinding Rhythms, Wailling Leads
Feed Upon The Things You Bleed
Fast Rock And Roll At Utmost Speeds
Bang Your Heads Up And Down
Throw Your Bodies All Around
Fast, Loud Really Obscene
Play For Pain Say What We Mean

[Chorus:]
Bleed For Metal
Passing The Test
We Are Not Normal
Brain Damaged At Best

Crashing Metal Heavy Beats
Come On Assholes On Your Feet
Thirsting For A Metal Sound
Stomping Posers To The Ground
Holding Your Ears Are They Starting To Bleed
Can't Stand The Noise Then Get Up And Leave
Can't Stand Posers, We Hate Them All
We Live For Metal Proud And Tall

[Chorus:]
Play With Fury Play With Speed
Grinding Rhythms Wailling Leads
Feed Upon The Thing You Bleed
Fast Tock And Roll At Utmost Speeds
Band Your Heads Up And Down
Throw Your Bodies All Around
Fast Loud Really Obscene
Play For Pain
