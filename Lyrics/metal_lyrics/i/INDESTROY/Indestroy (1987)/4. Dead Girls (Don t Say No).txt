Lived Above A Funeral Home
Late At Night My Mind Would Roam
To All The Thing I Could Be Doing

One Night I Went To Stalk My Prey
The Viewing Was Over There She Lay
Before I Knew It I Was Screwing

Dead Girls Don't Say No

No More Waiting I'm Doing The Deed
Fulfilling Every Lustful Need
Yea It Feels So Very Good

Run My Fingers Through Long Blond Hair
Put Both Her Legs Up In The Air
Feels Just Like I Knew It Would

Dead Girls Don't Say No

Feeling Good Letting Loose
Filling Her With My Hot Juice
My Fun Is Over It's Time For Me To Go

She Was Good And Very Sweet
For A Lifeless Piece Of Ice Cold Meat
Too Bad She'll Never Know

Dead Girls Don't Say Much At All

Cards And Flowers All Around
But She Didn't Move Or Make A Sound
Took It All And Never Complained

Some Like 'Em Hot I Like 'Em Dead
Better In A Coffin Than In A Bed
I Don't Need Her For Her Brains

Dead Girls Don't Say No
