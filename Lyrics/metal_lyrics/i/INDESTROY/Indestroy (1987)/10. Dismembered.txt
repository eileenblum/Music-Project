With Castigation In Middle East
A First Offense Is Not Repeat

Your Arms Dismembered, Hacked Away
A Guilty Verdict, You Now Must Pay

Corrupted Jury, The Trial Goes Fast
A Severed Limb, The Sentence Passed

The Sword Falls Hard, With Utmost Speed
The Crowd Moves Forward To Watch You Bleed

Your Arms Dismembered, Hacked Away
The Pain Is Searing, It's Time To Pray

The Blood Keeps Flowing, You're Left For Dead
All For Stealing A Loaf Of Bread

The Terror Fills Your Body
The Tension Starts To Rise
A Moment Of Silence
And Then You Realize
Darkness Falls Around You
The Tension Rips Your Spine
A Death Dealer Is Behind You
Slicing Deep To Take Your Life
