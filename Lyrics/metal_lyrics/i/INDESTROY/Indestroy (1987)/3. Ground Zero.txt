Burning Demos In Circled Flight
Evil Powers That Shine At Night
Driven On By The Word Of A Brainsick Despots Might

[Chorus:]
Annihilation
Falling Sky
Decimation
Time To Die

War Is An Epidemic Of Lethal Insanity
Tell Me How Can These Politicians Say What's Right For Me
It Doesn't Prove Who Is Right But It Sure Proves Who Is Left
From The Sky The Bombs Are Dropping And Evoking Violent Death

[Chorus]

So I Sift Beneath The Crumbled Brick
Hoping For Some Sign Of Life
My Eyes Can't Believe What They See
Can This Be Happening To Me

Yes The Pain Is Searing Through My Brain
Until I Find Someone I Know I Will Not Live In Vain
The Ground Has Been Reduced To Ashes And The Sky Is Black
The Final Bloodbath Is Achieved And There Is Not Turning Back

[Chorus]
