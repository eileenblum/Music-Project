The wind has changed, I feel warmth from somewhere familiar.
And it's all flooding back to me.
This is what I've longed for, this is what we've longed for.
Something so small, like a look in the eyes, reminded me of what it meant to follow my heart; and now I'm never looking back.
Laying our burdens down, there's so much we need to let go of.
This reflection is ringing true and it looks like I'm almost there.
What matters most is who we are to the ones that we love.
I am so glad to have your hand in mine.
A lack of you would mean less of what I hope to be.
If only you knew of the refuge you have given me.
This has only made us stronger, this has only made us strong.
Laying our burdens down, there's so much we need to let go of.
This reflection is ringing true and it looks like I'm almost there.
What matters most is who we are to the ones that we love.
Everywhere I go I feel you're here with me.
I'll be with you tonight, just like I said I'd be
