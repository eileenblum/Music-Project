Break my fall again, every time that I stumble.
This is me reaching out, this is us being tested.
I confess to you that my doubt has weakened me; I am almost defenseless.
And though my steps may falter I still have eyes to see.
I need you now more than I ever have.
This is why we found each other.
I need you now more than I ever have.
This is ours, and so much more.
Brace yourself right now.
This just may hurt you more than the last time.
I pray there never comes a day when I can't find you.
I confess to you that my doubt has weakened me; I am almost defenseless.
And though my steps may falter I still have eyes to see.
I need you now more than I ever have.
This is why we found each other.
I need you now more than I ever have.
This is ours, and so much more.
If there ever was a song to sing
If there ever was a word to speak
If there ever was a song to sing then sing it to me now.
This is us being tested.
I am singing of the gratitude I have inside my heart for you.
I'll shout aloud of all you mean to me; and I'm thanking you for who you've let me be.
If there ever was a song to sing
If there ever was a word to speak
If there ever was a song to sing then sing it to me now
