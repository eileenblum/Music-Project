The path has been cleansed.
The cancer makes me no longer miss the limb.
No longer drawing from me.
Out with the sick and also the well.
I no longer fear this change.
It only means I have a chance, the chance that was absent before.
In the wake of loss I see clear.
All can be spared, all can be wasted.
But this is not a waste, it's a sacrifice.
One that I'm willing to make.
Out with the virtue and also the vice.
I no longer fear this change.
It only means I have a chance, the chance that was absent before.
In the wake of loss...
And without those nerves it no longer hurts to remember.
I no longer fear this change.
It only means I have a chance, the chance that was absent before.
In the wake of loss I see clear
