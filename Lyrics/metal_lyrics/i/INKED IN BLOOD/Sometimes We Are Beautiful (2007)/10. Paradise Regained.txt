There is a place where the weary rest their hearts.
Where we are truly in love, and truly home.
I long for that rest.
Like falling asleep, like being at peace, where love conquers all things, just as it should.
We will only weep for joy.
You have seen me through the end of everything.
And now I see we're beginning again.
You have seen me through the start of everything.
And now I see we're beginning again.
This is the only way to be complete.
A site to dream of, and not to tell.
Yet we will wake eternally.
Like falling asleep, like being at peace, where love conquers all things, just as it should.
We will only weep for joy.
You have seen me through the end of everything.
And now I see we're beginning again.
You have seen me through the start of everything.
And now I see we're beginning again.
We have the hope of all hopes
