I stand here now, swearing that I don't need you.
I hope you can't see through me.
Transparency is the clincher.
I'm made of one-way glass, wish I was shatterproof.
Strong enough to sever bone, but much too weak to give this up.
Strong enough to quench desire.
Strong enough to be an offering on an altar built for you.
Strong enough to burn alive.
You'll give me all that you can, I'll squander all that I receive.
I hear your every sound, I feel your every touch.
You're closer to me now than you've ever been.
Strong enough to sever bone, but much too weak to give this up.
Strong enough to quench desire.
Strong enough to be an offering on an altar built for you.
Strong enough to burn alive.
I've been away for far too long.
I don't know if I can go through with this
