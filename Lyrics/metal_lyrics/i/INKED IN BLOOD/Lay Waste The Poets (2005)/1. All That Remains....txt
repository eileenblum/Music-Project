All that remains.
Tonight is everything, we will be created.
All those before us left a legacy, a treasure - forged from their lives.
Now in our keeping, this battle waging, the light fading from our eyes.
All that we fought for, all that we fought for is on the line.
Can you see the burning on all sides?
What we have now could be taken.
What we have shared could be stolen.
All we have left could be gone.
Revive the hope that we have found something worth protecting.
What would you be to keep what you've become?
Would you stand up at any cost?
Were my bones broken, I would keep fighting.
Were my life taken, it would not be in vain.
Dream of beauty, dream of passion, find the truth that we are more than what they say.
We are more than what they say.
Dream of beauty, dream of passion, find the truth that we are more than what they say.
All that remains.
