Kiss the lips of your betrayer.
How beautiful you looked the last time I spoke with you.
I know you loved me so.
I left you there among the jackals.
It was in my blood to betray you.
So now that I'm here again, and you love me all the same, will I be yours forever?
[Repeat]

Or will I sell you out again?
I can make no promises.
I'm glad that you'll always be here for me, and I'm glad you're not like me.
Oh how I love thee, woe how you love me more.
Kiss me again, yet I may still betray you.
Kiss me again.
Yet I know you'll be here waiting, with your love and open arms.
Your forgiveness is never-ending, and I'll quench your sorrow with my charm.
I could never love like you do.
