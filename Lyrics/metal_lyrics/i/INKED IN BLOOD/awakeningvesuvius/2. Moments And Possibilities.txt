To be blessed with the curse of self-awareness?
And to live in the joy of paradox and mystery.
We won't be forgotten.
To live, to die, to be reborn.
(This is possibility - it is ours for the taking)
This is our night - these are our lives.
Expression breeds revelation for those who live in the moment.
