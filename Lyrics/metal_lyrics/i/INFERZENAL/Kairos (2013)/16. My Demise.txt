[feat. David Maxim Micic &amp; Luis Barjau]Can you hear the wind?
It's messing with my head
The sound is getting louder
Step off, im not ok
Everyone seems to hate me
And im about to fail

I found myself alone
Facing demons inside me
Try'n to blame anyone
But no one's ever there

Days are getting longer
Than before, but my time is shorter
The air is heavier and I can't breath

Let me find the way
I know im lost
I set my soul on fire
Fire up

I feel an itch inside my skin
Someone's out to hurt me

Must break this conspiracy
A solid mist and I can't see

I found myself alone
Facing demons inside me
I guess im the one
The one who's to blame for this

Days are getting longer
Than before, but my time is shorter
The air is heavier and I can't breath

Let me find the way
I know im lost
I set my soul on fire
Fire up

Days are getting longer
Than before, but your time is shorter
Here you stay and you can't go
But let me help you

Listen boy and hear me well
You are the one who's failing
This trouble belongs to no one else but you
And it is time to face it now

And now please stay calm
I will pray for your soul
Follow me down the hall
Lay down on this bed

In just a few more seconds
All it's gonna end [4x]
