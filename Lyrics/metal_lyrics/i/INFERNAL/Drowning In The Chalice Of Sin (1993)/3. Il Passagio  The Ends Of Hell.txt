[Lyrics: MarceloK]

No more sunny days
Only an endless night
No more sunny days
In the hellish depths
Belial redoubt of beasts
Demons and fallen angels
Here everybody serve their sentences
And my servants laugh
While drinking the blood of the damned
Torment after torment

But you shall fear not death
It's impossible to die
Death is a meaningless word
There is no more salvation

The bell tolls
And your sweet sentence
Is to turn their cries into music
Their despair into melodies

Eternally burning, playing
Never stopping
Eternally burning, playing
In the ends of hell

No more sunny days
In the hellish depths
Here everybody serve their sentences
Torment after torment

Remember that each note you play
Is a condemnation to a thousand ages of pain
Each note you play will make you feel
All the misery of your ancestries
