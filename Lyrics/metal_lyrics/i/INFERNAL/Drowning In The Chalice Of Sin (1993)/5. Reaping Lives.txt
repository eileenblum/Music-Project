[Lyrics: Paulista]

Two eyes appear in front of me
But I can't see them
They shine like gold but I don't perceive
You have to see how they shine
Then I run away, I run the faster I can
Until I get home, so I lock myself there
My soul cries imprisoned inside this body
If I could release myself, I would run
To your arms and I'd give myself to you
You're like a serpent, ready to strike

I'm only a helpless prey
I'm bound in my own pride
I'm condemned to perish in front of you

You know this and you're just waiting
The day when I'll knee in front of your and kiss your feet
You've got power and you use it on me and my will is to die
But I need to see you, I have to touch you
Your eyes seem to hipnotize me
I've never felt like this before

I must resist I'm strong
I'm a warrior I won't give up
Tonight, I think I can't do it, no!
I need to see you, I need!
You've been calling me too long
I guess you've never found
A so resistant prey, have you?

Fire, is just like love, it burns!
But it's good, fire, purifies, love kills
The flowers die, the grass wilts
Man grows it and then dies

Hold me tightly, kiss me
I can't stand it anymore
I want you, I need your presence
Oh death, I love you
