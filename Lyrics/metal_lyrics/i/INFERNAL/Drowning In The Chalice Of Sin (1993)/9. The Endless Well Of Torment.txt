[Lyrics: Paulista]

People act as if life would last forever
Ignoring the suffering, living for the sake of living
Holding on plaster idols, praising the man on the cross
Putting their faith on the book of dirty lies
Holding on plaster idols, praising the man on the cross
Putting their faith on the book of dirty lies

Living in huts, going hungry, falling into the well
The endless well of torment

They bow their heads and obey the ancient laws
Conforming themselves by just following the shepherd
Innocent flock of sheep, running to the bloodsoaked mouths
Of a pack of wolves whose hunger will last
Until there's no one else left to fall into the endless well of torment

In mansions and castles, the feast never ends
Albeit outside there's starvation everywhere
Popes, presidents, kings and generals, celebrate

Their daily victory upon those weak ones
The weak ones who tumble into the well
The endless well of torment
The endless well of torment
