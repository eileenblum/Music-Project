[Lyrics: ManÃ©]

Living an eternal battle, fighting for our ideals
Fighting against the prejudice, of society
Which recriminates us because we're not part
Of their dirty and mediocre world of lies

They kill for money
And despise people for racism
And call themselves civilized

They scorn us, because of our way of life
Because of our clothes, and of what we think
Many contempt their own sons for fearing
What the society will say about them

But our power comes from within ourselves
Cause we do what we want, and we don't care
What other people say or think about us
They fear us because we shove the truth down their throats

Many say we're idiots and fools
We don't give a fuck, cause they can't see
Their own decadence, which they claim to be the solution
While they hide themselves in stupid preconceptions

But our power comes from within ourselves
'Cause we do what we want and we don't care
What other people say or think about us
They fear us because we shove the truth down their throats

Eternal battle
