[Lyrics: Paulista]

Sodom and Gomorrah, cities of freedom
God killed everyone, men, women and children
Just because the people were healthy, body and soul
His envy sent a storm of sulphur and fire

They tilled the ground without fear or greed
And didn't need any sacred priests or rites
The tables were always full of bread and wine
No god would come before their liberty

So god himself verified
That in Sodom and Gomorrah
There were no temples or churches
No one there would praise him

This same god who built a mountain of corpses
Forgave just one family who didn't live in freedom
Father, mother and two daughters, they ran away
They would still live under god's laws

God was surprised when the woman turned her head
And witnessed his worlk of devastation and death
He couldn't afford this kind of insurrection
And turned the woman into a statue of salt

And the real sinners still lived on
For god is really the great deceiver
The daughters put their father drunk
To reach the ecstasy, of the carnal desire

So god himself verified
That in Sodom and Gomorrah
There were no temples or churches
No one there would praise him
