When the night arrives
I contemplate its beauty
She gives me a lot of inspiration
To be pleased with my myself
I have sinister visions in mind
Which are sharpen my thought
I have blasphemous dreams
Which are feeding my soul

In the inmensity of the forest
I inhale the purified air
To be in a good health
Of body and mind

When I see the stars,
When I look around
Everything is so beautiful,
Energy spreads over me
When I listen to myself,
When my blood is burning
Everything seems so black,
Everything shines for me

In the inmensity of the forest
I inhale the purified air
To be in a good health
Of body and mind
