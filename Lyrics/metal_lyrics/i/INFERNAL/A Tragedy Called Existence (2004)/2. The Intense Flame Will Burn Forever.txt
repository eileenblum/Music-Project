A mysterious voice whispers morbid words
From deepest of the abyss
Diabolical creatures embrace
Award the ancestral power

The bells are ringing intensely fire burns with all it's vigour
Demons brought up blasphemies, chaos rules eternally
Meak minds burning in fire, outstanding flame prevails
The intense flame will burn forever

Indomitable beasts destroy the false image into the infernal
Subconscious visions
I see coming into force the expected day
A tragic and painful scenery contemplates my eyes

Desires comes true almighty energy spreads over me
The fight against the irrational rules has been successful
An empires for gifted ones has been created
The intense flame will born forever

The bells are ringing intensely fire burns with all its vigour
Demons brought up blasphemies, chaos rules eternally
Meak minds burning in fire, outstanding flame prevails
The intense flame will burn forever
