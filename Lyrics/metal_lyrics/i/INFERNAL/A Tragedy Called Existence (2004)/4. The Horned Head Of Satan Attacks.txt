History has been written inverse
By those who have found glory in their lies
In order to incorporate false values into the system
The gods of the right hand path have fought tirelessly

But today they all must cry
The everlasting curse has come into force
To destroy those false prophets of moralism
The horned head of Satan attacks, attacks
Celestial souls can't protect against
All forms of evil sorceries
Feeble Christian heads fall down
Because of the diabolical
And resounding impact
There's no any protection against
The horned head of Satan attacks, attacks

Malignant spirits cause heavy rains
And danger in all forms
While the fearsome ruler enjoys on his throne
Under Satan's control betrayers beg
Pardon in the course of time
