All concentration is focused
On the performance itself
All energies are strictly devoted
To the proper execution of the ritual
The location of the temple is the most suitable
To bring upon the desired results
Armed with a magical dagger and a sharp sword

I challenge all those stablish rules of bogus values
There will not have compassion for those
Who have ever dared to tread the circle

Air must be purified and blood consecrated
Old creatures of fire, in the name of the eternal lord

I conjure thee, I invoke thee, almighty deity
Bearer of light, spirit of the air
Has come the age of the human freedom
Ritual performing

On the astral plane I'm surrounded
By magic symbols
Demonic entities listen to me as a sign
Of ritual accomplished

Fortified me with the power of the supreme majesty
Manifest that which I desire by the name of the eternal ruler
By the name of the living king who rules over thee
Come visibly and without delay
