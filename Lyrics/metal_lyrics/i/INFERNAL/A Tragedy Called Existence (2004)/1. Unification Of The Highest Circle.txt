Our symbol depicts an invisible force
A form of energy
A representation of the nature
Our form of supreme power
Our circle is vital existence
A balance between the mind and body
An energy which emanates from the chasm

It represents wisdom and understanding
And also expresses the harmony in all aspects
And the unification among each others
To produce exact results

Has come the age of the splendour
Glory and intellect
Legion now executes operations of destruction
Ruin and death
Legion commands obedience of all creatures
Obtaining grace and honour
Evil spirits are called under the shining moon

Unification of the highest circle
