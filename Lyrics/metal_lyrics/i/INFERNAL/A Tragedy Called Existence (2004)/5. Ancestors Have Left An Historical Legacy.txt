Knowledge has made wise men
Over all the universe
Several existing manuscripts
Have survived through the years

Secrets teachings of all ages
Have given us the power
For the accomplishment of our desires
Ancestors have left an historical legacy

The forces of good and evil live among us
From beyond mystical acts take place
Ancestors have left an historical legacy

Treasures go on occults,
Legends still stay alive,
Traditions stand firms
Remote antiquities shine
With all it's splendour
