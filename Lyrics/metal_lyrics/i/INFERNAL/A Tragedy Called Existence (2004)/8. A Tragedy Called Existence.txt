You have in mind rugged images
Don't think anymore about that
Because you rush at the end of your existence
Don't go back on your word

Don't look back on your past
Those memories will never be back
You mustn't feel nostalgia

Your life is a tragedy, just,
Accept the cruelty of destiny
Don't cry nobody take pity on you,
Not even you exist for them

Only, you know who you were long ago
Through the mystic mirror of time
Are you still melancholy? Look at yourself
Your body degrades very quickly

Be patient and go on expecting
The moment of your death
Your carnal suffering is not eternal
Meantime, look at your body consumed
For the passage of time
Your eyes have already been blurreds
By the unbearable pain

A tragedy called existence
