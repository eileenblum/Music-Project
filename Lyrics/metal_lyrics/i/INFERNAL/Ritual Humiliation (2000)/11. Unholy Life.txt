[Lyrics: Mauricio]

Trapped inside this limbo
Dead through the ages
Lower spirits set me free
Grant me sweet revenge

Giver of unholy life
Messenger of hatred
Sent to break my prison
Now Iâm free to sin again

Wings and jaws
A chaos of eyes and nails
Breathing poison
Vomiting flames

Quickly diving down
And becoming flesh
It touches me

Oh how this fire burns
Without pain it hurts
Meandering in my soul
Causing me to resurrect

Once again
The spark of life ignites my flesh
Iâm alive
Holocaust is on the way
