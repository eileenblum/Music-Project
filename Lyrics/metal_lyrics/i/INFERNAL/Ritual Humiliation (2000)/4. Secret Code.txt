[Lyrics: Marcelo]

I canât understand such language
But Iâm afraid to believe it
How could it have been written years and years ago?

The ancient words
Say what should be
Who has sent this message?
Who is behind the truth?

The assassin will kill
Should I insert myself into the secret code?

I canât understand such language
But Iâm afraid to believe it
How could it have been written years and years ago?

Mankind always wonders
Each one has a particular view
A world of technology
A world of pain
A world of dreams
A world of death

The ancient words
Say what should be
Who has sent this message?
Who is behind the truth?

The assassin will kill
Should I insert myself into the secret code?

Spelling all words
Can you calculate?
Add visions
Multiply reasons
Divide the fear
Decode the secret code

The ancient words
Say what should be
Who has sent this message?
Who is behind the truth?
