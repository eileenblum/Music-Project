[Lyrics: Daniel]

Take a look into your mind
So deep... into your mind

As you get used to your nothingness
But get scared anyway
Wait for the signs if you need proof
Part of the illusion you now behold

Find a hold or a dead line
Locked windows out of touch
Seeing darkness everywhere
Searching for the absent light

How blackened are your days?
How long will your eyes bleed yet,
Still looking for the absent light?

Find a hold or a dead line
Locked windows out of touch
Seeing darkness everywhere
Searching for the absent light

Take a look into your mind
So deep... into your mind

Once hopeful, now wasted
Memories turned into
Your deepest agony

An abyss to fall once again
