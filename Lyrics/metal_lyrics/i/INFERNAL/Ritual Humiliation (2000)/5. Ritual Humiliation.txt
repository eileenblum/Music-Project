[Lyrics: Mauricio]

Ritual humiliation
Before you I kneel
In search of relief

Screaming inside we open our souls
We, the meek, confess our need for guilt

Many times Iâve sinned
And prices I have paid
Forgive me father
For I will sin again

Guilt inbred since birth
A dogma for every mistake
None can escape from (turning into) dust
âCause all beliefs are fake

Inherited faith
Imposed punishment
For things I donât know

Here we stand
The miserable
Pour the blessings

Inherited faith
Imposed punishment
For things I donât know

My faults Iâve displayed
Through fear and pain
Forgive me father
For I will sin again

Guilt inbred since birth
A dogma for every mistake
None can escape from (turning into) dust
âCause all beliefs are fake
