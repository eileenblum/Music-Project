[Lyrics: Mauricio]

And in sudden darkness
The most elementary
Pure, animal, irrational instinct
Arises to make us yelp helplessly

A study in blood!

Whispering sounds float surrounding
Nerves are drenched in adrenalin
Images of cruel dismemberment
Fill wide opened eyes

A study in blood!

Primeval, archetypal, dreadful
Fear of the unknown in the dark
The anticipation of pain

Of nails, claws chewing members
Ripping flesh to find the guts
The source of all life and lies
Filled with blood, blood, BLOOD!!!

For blood is life
Yes, fear of dying
Annihilation of existence
Dark, empty, nothing!
