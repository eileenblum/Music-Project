[Lyrics: Mauricio]

Die, slow, painful death

Feel the pain rip you from the inside
As the knife starts to cut away
See your guts spilling from the opening
The smell of blood is driving you insane

Feel the shock running through your crawling skin
Unexpected surge of energy
Frying limbs, carbonizing flesh and bone
Melting eyes will never see again, die!

Donât look back, you know the dogs are right behind
Ticking claws are your death watch
First a leg and then youâre down on the ground
Jaws snap and your jugular is gone

Try to move, wooden box is all around
Six feet of dirt above your head
In the dark, oxygen is growing thin
The definitive nightmare now is real

Die, slow, painful death

Feel the pain rip you from the inside
As the knife starts to cut away
See your guts spilling from the opening
The smell of blood is driving you insane

Feel the shock running through your crawling skin
Unexpected surge of energy
Frying limbs, carbonizing flesh and bone
Enjoy your death, cause you can only die once

Die, slow, painful death
