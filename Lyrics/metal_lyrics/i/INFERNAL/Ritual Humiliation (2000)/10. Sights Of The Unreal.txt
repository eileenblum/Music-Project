[Lyrics: Mauricio]

Irreality, the howling wind
Into the mist, shapes are moving beyond my vision
I donât know what they are
Iâm not sure I want to see them

Senseless, a blood moon hovers above
Cacophony stops me from concentrating
Still the cold wind blows
The eyes, they watch me oh, so close

The shapes approach through the mist
I canât, I wonât believe what I see
The substance of dreams shows itself
Reaching for me, babbling and growling

Irreality, the howling wind
Into the mist, shapes are moving beyond my vision
I donât know what they are
Iâm not sure I want to see them

The stars move fast in the dark sky
I run (but) slow, liquid movements wonât help
I close my eyes, wait for the cold touch
Of whatever is going to drive me insane
