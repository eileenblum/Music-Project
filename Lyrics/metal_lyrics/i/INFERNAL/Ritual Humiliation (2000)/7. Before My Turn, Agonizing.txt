[Lyrics: Marcelo]

Free inside
A darkened room
Double side
Free inside
An unforgettable mind

A burning star
King of death
The burning star
King of death
Give it to us
Kissing our heads

Who has been living here?
Whoâs afraid of living?
Theyâve learned how to breathe despair
They will die to live there

Poor epidemic civilization
The end is near
Continuous cycle of destruction
Becomes a thief
Of our own mass

Words in pieces
Theyâll be consumed
A collection of corpses
Pick up one of them
