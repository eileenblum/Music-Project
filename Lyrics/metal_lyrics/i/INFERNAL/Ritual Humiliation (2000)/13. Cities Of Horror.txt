[Lyrics: Marcelo]

Poverty... society...
A disease... madness...

Poverty... hungry society...
So, disease... madness...

Poverty...
Feel the hunger...

What cities we live in
What hell will we die in?
Burning in our homes
Or bleeding on the edge of a knife?

Sometimes I think about
What kind of life we are
Gods of the land
Or gadgets, irrational?

Cities
Swimming in blood
Fucking life...

Poverty...
Feel the hunger...
Feed the disease...
So, disease...

The corpses are sleeping
In the backyard
Donât be afraid, put your hands
In my... hands!

Poverty... society...
Feel the hunger...
Feed the disease...
