[Lyrics: Mauricio]

Let me into your grief
Give me the keys to open your soul

My ship follows no direction
Sailing the cold seas of emptiness
Touched by chilling winds that blow
From the deepest regions of death

The moaning of the dead
Soaring through the waves

To cross the river in the dream of its dream
To feel the ecstasy of a newly found reality

Have you ever touched the cold, parchment-like skin of a phantasm,
Its eyes burning with a promise of peace, inviting you to follow through?

Wake up to life and behold
The great dream of men
Turned into rotten reality
By the dumb power of the worms

To cross the river in the dream of its dream
To feel the ecstasy of a newly found reality
