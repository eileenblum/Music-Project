[Lyrics: Marcelo]

Fear, loathing, misery
Frozen by agony
Live or dead, mistery
Like men bleed

My son, why are you running?
Are you reaching for my hands?
My son, why are you bleeding?
Drop down at my feet!

I see the final decay
The sign of ignorance
One after another, burns
And nobody understands
âCan I have your soul?â
What is the meaning of life?

I have the flag in my hands
I can hear the screams from earth
Men are digging their own graves
My time is over on this land

Like men bleed
Defeat or victory
Like a blind creed
I canât feel my soul free
