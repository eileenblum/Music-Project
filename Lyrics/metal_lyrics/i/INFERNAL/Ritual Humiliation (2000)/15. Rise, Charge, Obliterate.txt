[Lyrics: Mauricio]

From below I call
To all legions of the undead
Obey the summoning
Tear apart the world of flesh

There may be frontiers
But there are no boundaries
The language we speak is one
Death metal till we die... again!

Immortal warriors, your timeâs arrived
Rise from the ground of the battlefields
Conquer this weakness-ridden world
Spread the disease, command a new era of doom

Spread the disease!

Stars above, allow the call to be heard
Through the gate
Tormented souls unleashed upon
Oblivious human sheep

Spread the disease!

Sworn to an impure faith
Sworn to death invincible
We march, for canât be killed
whatâs already dead

Immortal warriors, your timeâs arrived
Rise from the ground of the battlefields
Conquer this weakness-ridden world
Spread the disease
Command a new era of doom
