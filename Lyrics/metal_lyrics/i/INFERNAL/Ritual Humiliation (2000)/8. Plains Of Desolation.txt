[Lyrics: Mauricio]

I should not
Proclaim such mysteries
Deathâs cold breath
Is still in my lungs

For Iâve just returned
From desolate lands
Where the mourning
Of endless days is heard

Midnight, when fear
Awakes in our souls
When the dead
Open their swollen lips

Murmuring mysteries
And dreaming
What no man ever dreamed
Or dared to (dream)

I should not
Proclaim such mysteries
Deathâs cold breath
Is still in my lungs

These sorrowful wastelands
These landscapes so sad
In my soul
Forever after shall be
