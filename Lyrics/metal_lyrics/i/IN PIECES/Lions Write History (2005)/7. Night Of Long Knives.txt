I still remember all the pews, all the books lined up.
You looked beautiful and pious, but of course, Iâm biased.
But don't hate me for not raising my voice.
After all, you don't believe I had a choice.

We waited decades for god to sanctify his secular faith, but we waited in vain.

This was a cruel religion, a cruel god for a cruel world.
And don't pretend that you're upset; after all, you spared no expense.

The whole universe of love collapses.
And all my wishes for grace were just a waste of my time.
But I will keep waiting for love to find me.
And not give in to you earth-as-heaven...
As tempting as it is.
