Lights out.
This is my final ill-wish.
And I hope you get buried with it.
And yes, I will.
Yes, you can tell me when Iâm in unforgiveness up to my neck.
Disappointed.

But we move on.
We hold on.
Only to bend our backs like snakes to shapes we never wanted.
But we were born for this.

And I panic every time.
My mind is restless.
But Iâm all right.

Oh, these lies we tell ourselves.

Who is on my side?
I am left alone with the beating of my heart in the center of the earth,

And hatred is the most passionate form for love, and I still have that in spades, forever, lights out.
