One of the warmest countries, and the coldest spot on this cold, grey earth that you call a planet.
And suddenly, all of this makes sense.
Way too much sense.
And your American money didn't buy me and sense of safety.
We watched the ground crack open... and you're seeing all of their bodies.
We see it everyday.
They're open to the air.
We see it everyday.
But all we want now is to be happy.
Black cross.
Oh, we know it.
So take this desert sky, and ask me if Iï¿½ve ever had sex, put your hands around my neck and twist.
Was that good for you?
But all we want now is to be happy.
