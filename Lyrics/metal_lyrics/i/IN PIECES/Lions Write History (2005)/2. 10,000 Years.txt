You should be screaming out loud as you watch highway lines roll beneath out feet;
You should be wondering.
But you're not.
You walk away each day of your life and we all have transience to thank for that.
Oh, you.
You wanted a sign, a code.
Well, it's raining blood.
How cute.
And we all have transience to thank for that.

So bring on the suits, uncoil the rope.

You are what you wish.
So remember this when you're giving up.
You are what you wish.
Remember me in the 1,000 years.

When the sky goes dark and the room falls silent, everyone is happy.
When the sky goes dark and the room falls silent, everyone is happy.
And you will be what you wished.

We all sold our souls to rock and roll.
We bet our lives so you could finally say we win.
We win.
We finally win it all.
