So how old were you when you found out your life was over?
Iâm sorry to tell you like this, but it's true; the subtle knives are by far the worst.
So, no holding on to these false hopes.
We face front or face nothing at all.
It's a long car ride, I have time.
Our guilt becomes everything, so we'd better confess.
And just like that, we all cave in.
Level this playing field, and we will see us breath in as much dust as we could want;
And we all fought to lie about this.
So, please lie.
We didn't stand a chance, how do you compete with that?
A spectra is haunting Connecticut.
