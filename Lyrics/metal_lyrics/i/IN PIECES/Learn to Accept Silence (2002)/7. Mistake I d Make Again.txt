i'll quench my thirst with the poison you gave me
maybe it will stop the deadly sound
of your sweet voice in my head
should i let myself die,
or turn around to see your beautiful face

i've been drowning in my own breath
i have to break my legs to keep from seeing you
losing you was a mistake i'd make again

if you had just given me one chance
to make up what you made me lose
maybe i wouldn't be lying at your feet
with this gaping hole in my chest
yes - everything is fine.

you carved that hole so big
and now you sit and stare
as i bleed to death
