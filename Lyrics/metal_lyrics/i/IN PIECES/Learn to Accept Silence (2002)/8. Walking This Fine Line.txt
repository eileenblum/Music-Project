i'll trace my steps backwards so far
until all my tears run dry
looking further from what is feared the most
i'll cherish this time i'll face hate
confusion haunts, reality hurts
tears run down my own face running into myself
an object so impossible for me to escape
i've been hunting myself, realizations revealed
the hunted is now the hunter, and the hunter is the prey
