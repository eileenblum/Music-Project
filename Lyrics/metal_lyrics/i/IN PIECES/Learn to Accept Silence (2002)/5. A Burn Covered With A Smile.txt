i made a list of everything i wanted to see before i left here.
i think i forgot to put you on it.
what would you say if i left without saying good bye.
i can imagine your face with a smile and a thought of "i'm glad."
maybe you'll get your wish. maybe your shooting star will crash down on you
and burn that wish into your skin.
so you'll show it with disgraceful pride that makes the hair on my arms 
stand up.
and i'll run from you. and i'll run to you. pull me in.
don't let me end what could be something so great that i would be blinded by 
its beauty.
please don't let me leave without saying good bye. please don't let me 
leave.
