i'm getting lost in your eyes deep like the ocean
and you're the anchor on my leg as i drown in you
i need a word, i need a smile
something to divert my mind
away from this addition running through my veins
well, where's all this room you said you'd give me so I catch up
i'm getting lost in your arms
once leaving me room to breathe
now robbing me of any hope inside, but that's ok
i'd rather die in your arms than alone on my bedroom floor
i need something like you
run away through my veins with your addiction, run away.
