i'm wishing on the last star that burns its last bit of fuel in the sky.
the earth has frozen, but it was cold before then.
i've grown accustomed to freezing fingers and the dark.
i've been known to call it home for some time now.
i've made it comfortable, livable, for now.
just frozen and helpless.
and i lie to myself and think the world of you.
and i lie to myself and give the world to you.
i'll pass this moment thinking of how i wished for one star to keep you warm at night,
and i pass this time regretting I didn't wish for me to be with you under the star's last night.
