The daily man refuses his oath to,
Faith and servitude,
Tyrants beware the hands thatâve taken,
Arms to destruct rule.

NOW ! All thatâs turned to hate,
The reasonâs all the lies,
A monster lies within,
Awakened by the crimes.

Fury absolved, with relentless scorn,
Bloodlust consumes the soul,
Nurtures TERROR !

The tragedy of mortals,
Is the gift that leads to the fall,
Of entities that defy.

NOW ! All thatâs turned to hate,
This beast brings forth demise.

Born in the depths where the fires awake,
From the black heart of a vigil,
Wars walk within the walls of free hatred,
When this demon seeks for its prize.
