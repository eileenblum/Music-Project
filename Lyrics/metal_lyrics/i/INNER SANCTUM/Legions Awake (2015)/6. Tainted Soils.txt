The depraved movements,
The sons of tainted soils,
A vile lineage thrives unchecked,
Overthrows all code.

Wretched souls of damned heritance,
Plagues of destruction,
The holy lies,
From parchments of gods.

The atrocious reign of deceivers,
The black hordes bring forth the age of doom,
The skies blacken overthrowing heavens,
Arise despots from the depths of rotten wombs.

The crooked path hails,
To the depths of hellish gates,
Our children born amidst,
A malicious empty rule.

The seeds of detest sown,
The empire rises still!
A violent will soars,
Higher than heads that shield.

The atrocious reign of deceivers,
The black hordes bring forth the age of doom,
The skies blacken overthrowing heavens,
Arise despots from the depths of rotten wombs.
