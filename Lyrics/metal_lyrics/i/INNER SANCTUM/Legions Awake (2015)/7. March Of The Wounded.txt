The young grow hollow,
Torn from what is past,
Thine eyes replicate the
Faith, that kills what provides.

Bred to follow,
Grown from all thatâs dead,
Braindead, to the death,
Thereâs no turning away.
DONâT TURN AWAY !

This is the only way,
No paths beyond the road,
WE MUST GO, WE MUST KILL !
But make haste !

This is the only way,
No paths beyond the road,
WE MUST GO, WE MUST KILL !
But make haste. SILENT !

Raise the flames, Liberate
BREAK THIS SPELL

Revolt for sorrow,
For lives that have passed,
Free the forces of hate,
To storm the keep of the lands.

March tomorrow,
March for these wounds wonât heal,
March to keeperâs den,
To kill the one that commands.

This is the only way,
No paths beyond the road,
WE MUST GO, WE MUST KILL !
But make haste !

This is the only way,
No paths beyond the road,
WE MUST GO, WE MUST KILL !
But make haste. SILENT !
