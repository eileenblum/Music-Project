All the deeds come crashing down
Deeds that did nothing good
Beings that kill from your hands
While you remain ignorant
These stupid wars
Blindfold us from the truth
Still we fly high
Flags of nationhood !

HELL BE THE REASON ONE
COMES BACK TO WAR
TO CHEER UP WITH DESPAIR !

It's such a tragedy
Cause we still remain fools
Eye for an eye
Blind we remain through the truth
Our self-destruction
Brought forth by our prayers
In deception
We find salvation

HELL BE THE REASON ONE
COMES BACK TO WAR
TO CHEER UP WITH DESPAIR !

Can you feel your voice sink
The situations that now
The master pulls you by your strings
Your thoughts are sac-rificed

FAITH WILL NOT SURVIVE
DAYS BEGIN TO DIE

HELL BE THE REASON ONE
COMES BACK TO WAR
TO CHEER UP WITH DESPAIR !

Way to destruction
It has long been paved
We walk the way... To destruction
