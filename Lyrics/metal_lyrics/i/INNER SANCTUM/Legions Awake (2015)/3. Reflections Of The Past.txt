Cold, In all our senses,
Seeking paths to our salvation,
The dead manâs, voice falls away,
Fallen, But they donât guide us,
Spewing back dismay,
Old wars, fought again !

SAVE THIS PLACE, FROM US !
FROM OUR DESTRUCTION !

Fate of life, seems to bring forth demise,
Reflections, of the past they sustain,
Fate of life, breaks with the frozen eyes,
Past it stays, morphed in form of our day.
Heed, these holy scriptures,
For they, not abide,
By commandments, of this place.
What is lostâ¦reclaim,
For only Hope survives,
In this nefarious Age !

SAVE THIS PLACE, FROM US !
FROM OUR DESTRUCTION !

Fate of life, seems to bring forth demise,
Reflections, of the past they sustain,
Fate of life, breaks with the frozen eyes,
Past it stays, morphed in form of our day.
