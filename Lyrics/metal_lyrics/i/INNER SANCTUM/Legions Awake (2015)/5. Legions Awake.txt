Reckless wraiths,
They watch us parade,
Mocks us blind, as our faces corrode.
In times, of fear and denial,
I am the one who walks with the flame.

I will break down the gates,
Wash these stains,
Bring forth the wrath of legions,
NOW!
Countless times,
The spaces decay,
The fists unite, under a name
For times, of fear and denial,
Legions they, come forth awake.

I will break down the gates,
Wash these stains,
Release the wrath of legions,

I will taste, the mortal blood,
Of the one who takes this place for gain,
Screaming and squirming, to their deaths
This earth it reeks of this madness as before,
NOW !

Mankindâs still blind,
While the rest is broken,
The spirits call my name,
To tear them down to the ground.
Honestly! Whoâre we to care ?
This world is seems to have lost its place.
Honestly! Whoâre we to care ?
Your fate it seems is to DIE !
