Eye on the enemy,
What its cost, to cease the terror.
A twisted majesty, feeds until itâs all drained !

REAP, SOW, FEED, GROW
From the lies,
Till this age,
Go into, Oblivion !

A truth labelled - blasphemy,
Fascist rules, reign this realm of hate,
Lost in insanity, embrace the crown of the dead !

BREED, GROW, REAP, SOW
From the spite,
Failed honour,
Fade into, oblivion !

Beasts that tell a tale, of dreams carrying on,
Choose not to heed or, fell the pain, the pyre, and face the war chain
Guised as sanity, for myths truths untold,
They mean to leave no, faith or free alive to go roam unchained !
WITNESS
WITH YOUR EYES
OBLIVION!

FACE THE PLAGUE !
Of our own sins, that will leave us broken !
DIE IN SHAME !
Perish without a name and forgotten
