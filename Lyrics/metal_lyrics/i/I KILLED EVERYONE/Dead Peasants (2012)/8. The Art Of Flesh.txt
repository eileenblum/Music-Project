The art of flesh
victims of this parasitic institution reduced to ash
no reverence for human life
Idols fall and heroes are destroyed
The sun now sinks into oblivion
My own flesh transformed into something that I don't recognize
Imprisoned in this vessel
Dead to everything but memory
The portrait of doom
Is painted across your canvas skin
Salvation is crippled

Just what the fuck makes you think you'll be forgiven when the cadance in your chest begins to fall
Your pleas are useless what pity shall
I have but none
Your soul is shit and meaningless
Innocence now fractured and rotting
Every shallow breath holding the weight of failure
The art of flesh
this masterpiece complete
human waste crushed beneath my feet
crushed beneath.
