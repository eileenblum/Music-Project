Earth Carcass
My eyes fall upona scene of devastation
The human form is deconstructed and lies in worthless pieces
death comes forth on pale wings preceding a wave of destruction
flesh rooted in soil
existence putrefied
bodies fused with the earth
disgust in my own kinda disease has manifested
hell is a creation of our own cognitive abilities
the greatest gift life has ever given me is to see you being torn limb from fucking limb
