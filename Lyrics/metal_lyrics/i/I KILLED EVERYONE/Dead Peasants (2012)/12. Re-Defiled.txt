Pledge your allegiance,
You're better off dead
Pacification, of our weakened minds
I will not believe what your forked tongues convince
As if you possess the decency
Globalist agendas disguised as the promise of a new day and age
We're conditioned to believe every fucking lie they speak

In the name of freedom and liberty
This is the end of everything we've known
The beginning of a new evil regime (evil regime)
I refuse to let my flesh be used as currency
I refuse to let the idea of freedom die
Right before my eyes
We are statistics,
We are the victims
We are what stands in the way of tyranny
This is oppression
This is the new world order and we will not go quietly.
