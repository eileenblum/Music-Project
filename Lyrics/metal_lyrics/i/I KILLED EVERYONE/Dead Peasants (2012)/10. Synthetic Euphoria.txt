Your synthetic euphoria has ended
panic is now the only thing coursing through your blood
in desperation you seek some for escape from the vile
creations of your own mind and all you will find in this place is death
descending into a realm of despair reality disfigured beyond recognition
this is a hell that you have created
Your veins begin to tighten you heart
begins to race a field of a million dead eyes watch you helplessly
watch you helplessly dig through the scattered fragments of what you have become
holding no worth nothing left to hope for everyday is an empty shell.
Kill every memory of what your life once was
