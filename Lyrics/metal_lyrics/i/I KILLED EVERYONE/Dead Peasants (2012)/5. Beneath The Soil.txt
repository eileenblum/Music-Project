Rot in the ground where I lay beneath the soil
the roots of greed begin to bloom while my corpse slowly decays
I am now the atrophy that withers you away
I am the weight on your shoulders caving in your frame
I am godless torture and enslavement of the mind
those who speak my name seek the end of misey
death in all of it's mercy
I feed on their suffering prey upon the weak
we've come for this world on the wing of hell
we've come for this world on the wing of hell
Beneath the soil is where we feast we run this world dry
we are diesease
You fucking cowards
You are dead rotting flesh

As this worlds
Laid to rest
Laid to rest
putrefied corrosion your decline

Fuck you
