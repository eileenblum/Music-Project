I now sit upon the throne
all kneel before the tyrant
conquer them all and adorn the crown in flesh
I'll devour the inside of greed
banish the filth
behead the kind
I will rain blood over all who will defy my rule
I am the serpent and the lamb
the reaper and the savior
I am the last fucking thing your eyes will ever see
the dead stench of this world will be the last thing you ever breathe
Not even the dust of your worthless infected shell will remain
isn't this what you've desired for all these years
Suffering

The way you humans live your miserable lives gives the reason to believe (to believe)
Fuck this world
