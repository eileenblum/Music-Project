Human beings are harvested
drained of all their substances
life is no longer of value
the contorted remains are discarded
The essence of the body is consumed
Regenerating all who will partake
blood droplets coruscating in their chalices
Drink my blood like wine
Feast upon everything that's left of me
Tear my fucking bones apart
I will never bow to you
Immortality acheived the imperium will rise with the strength of a thousand men
