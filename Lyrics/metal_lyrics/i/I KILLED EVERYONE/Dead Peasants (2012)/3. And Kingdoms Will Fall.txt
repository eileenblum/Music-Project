The orchestration of this worls demise
the blackened symphony that carries on
the chilling wing sends a rush over my skin
my blood runs cold
my mind falls empty
my stone heart feels nothing
as I watch the oncoming wave

Reduce the progress of humanity to rubble and ash
Fields of endless waste

Your majesty is dead
Your kingdom has come crashing
Conquer divide destroy
bastardization of our kind
erase infect decay
we prepare to die
we prepare to die
the wrath of our ways brought about this cataclysm
I no longer fear what I can't control
the depths will swallow me
So cold is the feeling
that washes over this place [x2]
The corrosive ideals of man have transformed my perception of the capabilties of evil.
