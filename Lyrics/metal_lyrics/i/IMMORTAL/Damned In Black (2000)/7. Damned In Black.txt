March of the black dungeon ones
Beyond the dim they shape

March of the black demonic ones
Beyond the dim they lurk

March of the black awakened beasts
Beyond the dim they rage

Hordes of evil march
Until the end you fall
Drawn to the apocalypse
It's the age of ending

Damned in black
Damned in black

The ghastly rivers whirl
Swallowing all in sight
Come the vision we await
Into the blinding depths
And never to return...

Damned in black
And never to return
Damned in black

March of the black dungeon ones
Beyond the dim they shape

March of the brave
Immortal gods
From beyond the dim we rise...
