Eyes of stone
Eyes of ice are watching me
Their glimpsing light comes in my sleep
Chained in a dream from the ancient deeps
Mind-travelling the darkest paths

Eyes of stone
Eyes of ice are haunting me
Their burning light comes in the night
Awaken from a dream but still I'm in
Mind-travelling the darkest paths

Come with me
I promise you the darkest desires
Come with me
I promise you a dimension that's higher

Follow me through the unending
On a path where crystals breathe
And night and day are same
Enter to a grimmer dark for us to be

Eyes of stone
Eyes of ice are watching me
Their glimpsing light comes in my sleep
Chained in a dream from the ancient deeps
Mind-travelling the darkest paths

Come with me
I promise you the darkest desires
Come with me
I promise you a dimension thatâs higher

Follow me through the unending
On a path where crystals breathe
And night and day are same
Enter to a grimmer dark
For us to be

For us to be
