Again from above the gate we stride at hand
Leading the charge into the battle
Ravaging the lands

Shadows flow on the wind-rippled steps
Our black eyes sparkle
Celebrating death

Again from beyond our realm we come forth
The moon is setting on
Swallowing the sun
Shades gather on the tundra
Ascend from the gods
Who once walked the earth

Before the might of our wrath
Hear the mighty sound of damnation
Of dust all lands will lay in a savage of chaos

Before the menace
Strike you all by the blaze of the glorious victories
Before battalions storm you all
Hear the mighty sound of damnation

Again from above the gate we stride at hand
Leading the charge into the battle
Ravaging the lands
Shadows flow on the wind-rippled steps
Our black eyes sparkle
Celebrating death
