The arctic views its distant vast
And the shifting breeze that blew my horizon
Where storm clouds mass along the skies
Dark and brooding across the blistered broken lands

Here flow long streams of freezing water
as in a saga it lived once
Descended to the brinks that tower to the sky
Sound my crying through creation
Still I'm enlocked on these ridges

Where the sun forever vanished
Once a world was ever splendid
That took my soul

Now the world is too old
So take me biting winds
My soul travels with a black heart

When the darkness close in on me
There's this world where I can breathe
Still the saga, the saga will live on
And the breeze that blew my horizon
Behind these waves of ice...
