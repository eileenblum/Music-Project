Where the great winds blow
An ancient tide spills forth
Remember our diabolical past
Summoned by the call of the dark

Only in dark and sinister shadows
My thoughts come clear
And the voice on my mind sound oh so real
The years of memory pass

In our mystic visions blest
Where the ground shudders wind
And the world shakes and roar
Our ghastly souls are one

In our mystic visions blest
Forever
Never bury the years that are gone
Our ghastly souls are one

Here we go again

Where the great winds blow
An ancient tide spills forth
Here we made diabolical pacts
Summoned by the call of the dark
