[Music: Abbath; lyrics: Demonaz]

Shadowed you fall
Iced soul in the shivering sphere
Bestial sound of winter call

Bitter cold comes whispering
Noctambulance spread its wings
Snow-tombed darkness circling
Demons claws in the wind
Rule the ever-lasting souls on ice
Cast for the nebular worlds

Demons of endless time
In the uplifting Aurora Borealis of cold
A trinity of might is born
Up head us masters, demons roar

By glacial utterness we view your spirits
Wind swept forever in the northerly hemisphere
Noctambulant

Frozen in the winter gate
Shadowed you fall
Iced soul in the shivering sphere
Bestial sound of winter call
Bitter cold comes whispering
Noctambulance spread its wings
Rule the ever-lasting souls on ice
Cast for the nebular worlds
Noctambulant

Demons of endless time
In the uplifting Aurora Borealis of cold
A trinity of might is born
Up head us masters of demons roar

By glacial utterness we view your spirits
Wind blown forever in the Northerly hemisphere
Noctambulant
