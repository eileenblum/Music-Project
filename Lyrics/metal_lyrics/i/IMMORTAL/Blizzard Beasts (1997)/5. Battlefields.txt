[Music: Abbath/Demonaz; lyrics: Demonaz]

Smell the battle with the wind
Before you see us
Winter horde of fury ride
The wind will lead us

Banner high onward ride
Domestic purebred
On the ever-lifted north sky

Conquer all with permafrost
(Phantasmworlds)
Await at our final gate
Lay waste this world on ice
Let it crumble underneath us, underneath us

Ride the breeze of better times
Where there are enemies to die
High fame and honour
Won on the fields of battle

Warriors fight
With long swords in hand
Valleys drink from the open wounds of a thousand men

Hear the battle on the wind
So obvious
Winter horde of fury rides

The wind now lead us
Banner high
Onward we ride
Domestic purebred
On the ever-lifted north sky, north sky

Conquer all with permafrost
(Phantasmworlds)
Await at our final gate
Lay waste this world on ice
It will crumble underneath us, underneath us

Valleys drink from the open wounds of a thousand men
Eldrich talons eat hearts out of the fallen

Proud with battle lust we ride
Savagely towards the battlefields
And into greater strides

Battlefields awaits
