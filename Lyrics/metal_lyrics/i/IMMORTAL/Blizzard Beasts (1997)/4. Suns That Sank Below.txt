[Music: Abbath/Demonaz; lyrics: Demonaz]

Mountain guarded by the light of sun
In the valley that we walk
Dark spirits against the sun
Gathered visioned in the raven storm
Black winged wraiths of opaque dreams
Owners of frost spheres
Unearthly strangeness never sunrise here

Crystalline formations
Ice storms scar the sky
A shadowed face in the wilderness
Knowing winter never dies
Clearly I breathe
In the forthcoming breeze
With tempted eyes I dreamwatch dying suns

I await
Ephemeral suns to fall
Aghast
Light becomes darkness
Black moon calls bleakness inside me
No longer visions
I see the dying suns go under

Suns that sank below

In snowblind visions I let the darkening moon
Become the jewel in my kingdom

Suns that sank below
