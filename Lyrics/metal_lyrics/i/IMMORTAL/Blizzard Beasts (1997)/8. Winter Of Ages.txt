[Music: Abbath; lyrics: Demonaz]

Stride purposefully through the snow
To the icy vasts at dusk
Crystals swirl by Northern dim
Majestic be this winter

Winter demons winter beasts
Further my visionary means
Blast into dominance
Millenniums filled with pride

Winters of hate winters of pain
Winters of sorrow
These winters await
Nebular fog aurora fog
Await us all in this seasonal cold

I stride purposefully through the snow
To the icy vasts at dusk
Drawn by our will
From the coldest regions
An ice age comes, comes

Minds into the elder dryas
Majestic panorama
Across the lands
Our mark shall flow

Winters of hate
Winters of pain
Winters of sorrow
These winters await
Nebular fog aurora fog
Await us all in this seasonal cold

Winters of hate
Winters of pain
Winters of sorrow
These winters await
Nebular fog
Aurora fog
Await you all to spread in this seasonal cold
