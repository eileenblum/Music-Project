[Music: Abbath/Demonaz; lyrics: Demonaz]

Wintriness lurk within enlocked realms
Strength beheld our demon throne
Supernal journeys from the shrine
Beyond the spirit side

Yearning in beast worlds tide
Blackening the lands with blight
Benighted watchers with masterly pride
We rise the demon side

Winters spread by blizzard beasts

Wait no more centuries we have become
Triumphant sons of an ice age blast
Echoes of our shadowed age
Above the winterâs masters rage

Convoke nebular dimensions
As real as the realms we ride
With none above and none at side

Yearning from beast worlds tide
Blackening the lands with might
Benighted watchers with masterly pride
We hold the demon side

Wintriness lurk within enlocked realms
Strength beheld our demon throne
Supernal journeys from the shrine
Beyond the spirit side

Winters spread by blizzard beasts

Convoke nebular dimensions
As real as the realms we ride
With none above and none at side
