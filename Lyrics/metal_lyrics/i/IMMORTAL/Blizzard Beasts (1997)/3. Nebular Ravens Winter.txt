[Music: Abbath; lyrics: Demonaz]

Damnation call
Final blasts close the earth
Immortal victory
Winters bane upon the masses
Snow spiraling towards aurora clouds
Clear nebulous vision sight
Soul winds fall into the dark ice realms
Where you now reach far

Black-winged ravens cry for tragedies to come
Lurking with snowfall
By doom they drag the robes of ice
Frozen of heart you now reach far

In the nebular ravens winter
Winds are known from where they blow
Nebular raven winters
Strength comes from us above

Ravens season has begun
Melancholic ageless and unknown
Mesmerized you fall in our domain
Freezing in the heart

[Lead: Demonaz]

Sojourn for the elder ravens
Beauteous winter's birth
An eerie mage
Emblazoned with the biting winds
Damnation calls
With staring glowing yearning eyes
Poised they strike again and drag
Us all below

In the nebular ravens winter
Winds are known from where they blow
Nebular ravens winter
Might bestowed from us above

Ravens season has begun
Melancholic, ageless and unknown
Mesmerized you fall in our domain

Inhale the effluence of demon worlds
Freezing in the heart
