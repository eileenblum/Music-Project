[Music: Abbath/Demonaz; lyrics: Demonaz]

Arctic wintry worlds in mind
Possessed forever by the chains of time
Beastly crafts comes with the snow
bring the coming of our demon storm
Mountains
On highest mountains we stand
Valleys in the deep
valleys we dwell

Demon ride
Hailstones flay the skin of earth
Demonized
Entropyâs victory is ensured

Stealers of dawn
Pale wraiths of the arctic swarm
Cover the sun
Storms are what we breathe

Arctic wintry worlds in mind
Possessed forever
By the chains of time
Beastly crafts comes with the snow
We bring the coming
Of our demon storm
Mountains
On highest mountains we stand
Valleys in the deep valleys we dwell

Demon rise
Hailstones flay the skin of earth
Demonized
Entropyâs victory is ensured

Frostdemonstorms
