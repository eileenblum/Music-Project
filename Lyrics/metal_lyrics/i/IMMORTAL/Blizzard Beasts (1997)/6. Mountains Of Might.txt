[Music: Abbath; lyrics: Demonaz]

The storm is getting colder
In a place of the frozen sun
Alone on the mountainside
Breathing the clearest winds

The winds are ever blowing
Blowing off the glaciers
Snow descends on the valley
The high impassable drifts

Mountains of might
Mountains of might

So rightly I am watching
These mountains that I know
Standing here
These mountainsâ Northern face

Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might

Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might

Icicled peaks
As far as the eye can see
I will reign this place alone
Cold winds blew into the valley wall
Snow was deeper there

The storm is getting colder
In a place of the frozen sun
Alone on the mountainside
Breathing the clearest winds

Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
Mountains of might
