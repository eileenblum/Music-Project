[Music: Abbath -  Lyrics: Demonaz]

Greatest Blashyrkh wait for me your deepest realms I'll find
with songs that sound eternally for you my call is ever so strong...
Winter landscapes pure and clear a walk into the glacial valleys
deep under forests alive only my torches fire light...

Greatest Blashyrkh waiting me your realms ever splendid
songs were made eternally the call is ever so strong...
Blashyrkh mighty be your name victorious a kingdom we made
with strength and pride all the way you are at the heart of winter

As the face of a glacier your mountains tower against the sunset
unforgetting what was made a bond so strong and ever so real...
The statue watches the kingdom your giant wings make all beneath
I'm staring forth the raven throne I know I'm at the heart of winter...
