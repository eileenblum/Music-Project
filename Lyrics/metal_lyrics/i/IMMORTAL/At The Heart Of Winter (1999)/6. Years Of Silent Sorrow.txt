[Music: Abbath -  Lyrics: Demonaz]

Farewell... lengthening pain inside me
Harnessbells... I hear them calling me
A demon... watch my walk in snow
Remain... my years of silent sorrow

Dome in the sky black winds to taste
shadowed spirits lead my way...
Drifting everly alone years of silent sorrow
until I'm home...

Bitterness with bitterness you bitter me...
Emptiness with emptiness you empty me...
Darkness with darkness you darkened me
this journey black before me...

Farewell... nothing breathes within me
Harnessbells... sounding cold behind me
A demon... with frozen eyes opened
this journey black behind me...

Dome in the sky black winds to taste
shadowed spirits lead my way...
Drifting everly alone years of silent sorrow
until I'm home...
