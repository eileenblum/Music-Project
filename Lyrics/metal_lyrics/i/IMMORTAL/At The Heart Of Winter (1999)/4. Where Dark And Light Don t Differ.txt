[Music: Abbath  -  Lyrics: Demonaz]

Barbaric tempered steel strike forth and toll our days
the red and black of our Victorian crest
We flag beneath... beneath the solar seas
we grant us the might to conquer so spread be our wrath...

Meet the voice, the voice of us dark-blinded souls as it blasts from an open sky
victorious, victorious we live over all strong men under us fall
The longer we ride this yearning will make us find
where dark and light don't differ...
where dark and light don't differ...

Winterized... blackening descend
Mesmerized... into demon land

Far... far and further away
in mightful strong and mindless realms
We flag beneath... beneath the solar seas
again it's time to conquer so spread be our wrath...
Where dark and light don't differ...
where dark and light don't differ...

Winterized... blackening descent
Mesmerized... into demon land

The longer we ride the stronger we stride...
