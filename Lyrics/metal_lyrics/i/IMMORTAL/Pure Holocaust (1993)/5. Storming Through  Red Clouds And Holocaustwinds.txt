[Lyrics: Demonaz. Music: Abbath]

Sons Of Northern Darkness
Under The Throne Of The Moon
United With Forces Of Evil
And Infernal Doom

Lords Of Tragedies Storm
As the valley gates opens
Decayed lands of sorrow
Wait below
Wait below

Storming through red clouds and holocaustwinds
Storming Through Red Clouds And Holocaustwinds

Blades in eyes shinning
Eyes in blades shinning

Sons of Northern Darkness
Under The Throne Of The Moon
United With Forces Of Evil
And Infernal Doom

Storming through red clouds and holocaustwinds
Storming Through Red Clouds And Holocaustwinds

Demonized by the closing Nordic lights
