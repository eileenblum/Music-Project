[Lyrics: Demonaz. Music: Abbath]

Enshrined on the burial ground
On the path to the cemetary gates
My grave sank in the rivers
To the cemetary pit
Spiritual voices called through chilling smoke

Frozen visions of a dying realm
Under a blasting winter sky
Hate rises from an infernal tomb
A shadow with black wings

Eternal years on the path to the cemetary gates
In the chains of cold with hate to all
Eternity surround me I am real as the earth
As dark winds fade away no one knows where I am gone

Enshrined on the burial ground
On the path to the cemetary gates
My grave sank in the rivers
To the cemetary pit
Spiritual voices called through chilling smoke

Tasting the cold from the shining gates
As snow falls from the sky
Thirsting for the realms of frost
At the end of the other side
I won't stop but spread my wings
As dark winds fade away no one knows where I am gone

Eternal years on the path to the cemetary gates
