[Lyrics: Demonaz. Music: Abbath, Demonaz]

A Whispering Cry
Heard from a casket of stone
Sorrow Reap The Windscreen
I'm here all alone
Shades of gray cast to the sky
In The Deepest Night
Icewinds tears drips
On my unbeloved soul

Coven of black mist
Sing for me
Ceremonial hymns
Of the purest blasphemy
At one with the Earth
Alone with light in my eyes
The ravens circle around my tomb
As I dream the night

Coven of black mist sing for me

Coven Of Black Mist Sing For Me
Ceremonial hymns
Of the purest blasphemy
At One With The Earth
Alone With Light In My Eyes
The Ravens Circle Around My Tomb
As I Dream The Night
Frozen By Icewinds
