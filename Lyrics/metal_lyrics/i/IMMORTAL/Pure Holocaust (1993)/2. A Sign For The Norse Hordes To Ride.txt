[Lyrics: Demonaz. Music: Abbath, Demonaz]

Gathering the horde on a mountainside
Awaiting the mourning bestial sunrise
Diabolic seven winds of hate breathe
In the chasm of the realms

In clouds above horizon
A throne of ice
Watching silently
With a warrior's eye

Winds of destruction fills our hearts with joy
Portals to war lay before us
Fog in the distance is all I see
Born of the blackening sky of Blashyrkh
A raven's claw lifted toward the sky

In a sign for the norse hordes to ride
A sign for the norse hordes to ride
Is the way for our enemies to die
