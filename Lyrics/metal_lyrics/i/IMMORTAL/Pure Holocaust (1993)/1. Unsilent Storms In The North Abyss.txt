[Lyrics: Demonaz. Music: Abbath, Demonaz]

Delight of the moon
Is burning inside
Spiritless I lay
On cryptic stones

Mesmerizing snow
Wait silent above me
And my yearning for frost
Grow strongly

I'm a demon
A demon with a shadowed face
Entering to my winter coffin
Awaiting to see the dawnless realms
Staring into a ground of glass
A perfect view
I could have fallen to my eyes

I'm a demon
A demon with a shadowed face
Entering to my wintercoffin
Awaiting to see the dawnless realms
Staring into a ground of glass
A perfect view
I could have fallen to my eyes

Unsilent storms in the north abyss.

Unsilent storms in the north abyss.
