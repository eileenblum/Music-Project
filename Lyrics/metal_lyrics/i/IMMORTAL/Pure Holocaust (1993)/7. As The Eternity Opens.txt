[Lyrics: Demonaz. Music: Abbath]

In an hour of the night I hear summoning voices
And wake from my funeral sleep
In time before light in crypts of eternal deep

Dust from my grave blew away with the wind
On a cryptic journey unto the other side
Beneath the mountain and passed beyond the gate below
The eternity opens

Floating evil reign with fear in the sarcastic caves
Enlightened into a blacker dark for there are views in darkness
The light is searching to save the soul of mine
It is blind and can't see the gate to immortality
Harnessbells hail my soul
The gate is all I've known
The eternity opens

Floating evil reign
With fear in the sarcastic caves
Enlightened into a blacker dark
For there are views in darkness

The light will disappear
It was never here
As the eternity opens

Floating evil reign
With fear in the sarcastic caves
Enlightened into a blacker dark
For there are views in darkness

As the eternity opens

Light will disappear
It was never here

As the eternity opens

Light will disappear
It was never here
As the eternity opens
