[Abbath / Demonaz]

A passage in the sky
Its sights so monumental
Tower the mountain range
Pointing towards the Nordlight
Its realm hearts the kings
In the shivering frost

A horn monumental
Portals that throne in the sky
Above mountainsides
Pointing towards the Nordlight

Who dwell as gods of ice
Who rule the final realm

Mount North - the greatest of sights
Mount North - its power and might
Mount North - in the dark can be seen
Mount North - awaiting me

A mountain of dark
To where the mysterious rise
Under its light call the stars
Out here I am cursed to wander

Its realm heart the kings
In the shivering frost

Mount North - on unholy ground
Mount North - blackened abound
Mount North - as far as I see
Mount North - I shall enter thee
