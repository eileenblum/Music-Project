[Abbath / Demonaz]

Black fire burns the horizon
Ravens fly high in the sky
A breeze lifts the fog from the ice
As the winter predicts our fall
The last tide of honour now rises
With greatness and frost in its eye
A pale sun gleams upon the masses
All mountains stand proud in its tall

The winds speed upon our twilight
Thundersnow falls from the sky
Snowstorm that blind upon my eyes
From the clouds of red they are thrown
A thousand miles winter surround us
The dark marches while the world falls
The storm of the millennium rises
In massive size I hear its call

Beast of prey from the north arise
A force of strength none can defy
Unleashed from the gates a giant storm
To an end it all shall come
Mighty deeps of north world call
The power is at hand
Apocalypse brought by will
Scattered winds blow at you all
Bewinged by darkness from the cold
Come the order of chaos
Spread by winter, hate and storms
The final days descend the fall

The worlds ends just as it began
Cold winters claws grips at us all
All to be - not to be revealed
The prophecies' truth upon all
The curse is a force that we onward
Freezing and breathing at us...
No far from the forest abounded
The ravens warn us and call...
