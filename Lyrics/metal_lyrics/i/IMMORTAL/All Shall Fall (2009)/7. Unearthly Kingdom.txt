[Abbath / Demonaz]

Entering the sacred world of might
To where the stormy kingdoms home
Here naked winds blow cold and free
All black and dead on frozen ground

Pass the gate to Blashyrkh worlds
An everburning fire swirls
Here shadows hold a grimly sight
Dark must the eyes that see it be

Elder visions rise - the legends and myths
Once brought before the throne of might
Blacker of worlds
Once I would look upon its grace
With everblowing winds
This realm consumes the light

Rule all that comes to eye
Uphold the might
Gates to Blashyrkh
Profante majestic realm
Unearthly kingdom
Mighty ravendark
With everblowing winds
This realm consumes the light

The gate is open
With endless heights, tall and steep
Here moons at twilight
Above the misty deeps
Graced with eternal nights - ice blown by wind
Forests dark to see - dread naked trees
