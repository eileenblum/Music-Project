[Abbath / Demonaz]

The rising moon so bleak and old
Its darkened grin poisons my soul
Mist pledges the darkness, be my home
I ride this night - lustful with pride

The lurking mist appears out here
Breaths of evil fire through the snow
This cloudless night smells of fear
Keep my soul - dark and cold

The rise of darkness in my sight
Black forces bound to the moon
Shadows creep under my skin

Smell of fear - darkness is here

All evil lurk under bleak skies
Undead and restless are their souls
Hatred lust aligned by the signs
Blackened night - darkness rise

Burning eyes watching upon me
From the dark haunting side
Caught between mighty winds
Kingdom of evil find

Demonic in this realm
I haunt marked by the sign
Caught between mighty winds
Kingdom of evil find

From the woods I see the rise of darkness
In its deeps I'm on the other side
From the woods I see the rise of darkness
In its craft I'm on the other side
