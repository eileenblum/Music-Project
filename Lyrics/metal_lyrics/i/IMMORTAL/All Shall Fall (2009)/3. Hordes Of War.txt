[Abbath / Demonaz]

Gather attack while death march in the sky
Ride through the heavens with power
The hammer of battle pound hard from above
All doomed and damned in death's hour

Armies' formations winged in death's sky
Storming from the other side
Apocalypse dawns at the fiery command
Above the great battle fly

Chaos and fire to deafening sounds
Nearting from the other side
Last march for the battling hordes
Annihilation on the rise

Now proud all watch them by Nordlight we ride
Warrios with cold blazing eyes
Speeding on wind the fierce holocaust rises
Legions of black hold the sky

Hordes of war come storming forth
Coldblooded warriors of holocaust
Death stares out from their blinding fearless eyes
The sign of evil burns inside

Smell of death now as we ride through holocaust
Burning souls fall from the sky
Across the tide of pure apocalypse
Come waving flames to burn you all

Descent from the valley bursting through all
Released now is the black burning sound
Those who oppose shall be eternally destroyed
