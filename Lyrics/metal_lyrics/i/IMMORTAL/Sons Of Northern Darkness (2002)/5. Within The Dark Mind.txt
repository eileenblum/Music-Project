[Music: Abbath/Horgh]
[Lyrics: Demonaz]

The dark night landscapes and only me
Seas and rivers high
Deeps and waterfalls
Massive mountains
Powerful mountains
Only me
Where bergs and peaks throne
Cold beneath the moon

The dark night's horizons and only me
The shunning moonlit lights
The paths to forests wild
Massive sky powerful sky
And only me
Epic and diabolic swallowing the gloom

At the works of my gods
I glaze my heart to be
The nature of dark
Awake my soul to see
At the works of my gods
I glaze my heart to be
With an evil mind
Flamed my heart will be

My quest reverse the time within the dark mind
Strength in it I find within the dark mind

The dark mind landscapes and only me
Walls of time benight
A world I realized
Massive thoughts powerful thoughts
Still only me
A deepening of a shadow
By the dimming of the sun

At the works of my gods, I glaze my heart to be
With an evil mind flamed my heart will be
My quest reverse the time within the dark mind
Strength in it I find within the dark mind
