[Music: Abbath/Horgh]
[Lyrics: Demonaz]

Gaping in the horizon
An entire continent cloaked on ice
With giant ice sheets constantly on the move
Seas of this continent so cold and invincible
Where icebergs move as monuments
Towards a dry damned earth

Behind the gates and the mighty portal
Of the arctic polar circle
Builds the frozen, the frozen layers of snow
A perfect platform to grow against the seasons

Towering in the horizon
An entire continent cloaked on ice
With giant ice sheets floating nearer
With its tide and icy waves, waves

Snow belts of Antarctica rise
With its dark polar winter storms

The shadow of Antarctica spreads
With its masses of permafrost

The clima shifts to colder for the older age
Glaciers stretching far washing everything away

The darkest face of ice
The coldest place of all
Massive and unconquerable

Its drama will unfold
