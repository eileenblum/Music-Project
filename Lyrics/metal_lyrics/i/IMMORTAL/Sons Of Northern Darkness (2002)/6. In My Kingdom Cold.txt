[Music: Abbath / Horgh]
[Lyrics: Demonaz]

Forth after the dark
A time I do know
In my kingdom
I enter to my own world
Open the gate of a mountain of dark
Rising with the shadows
A dark world made for me

Black my mind
Black my heart
In my kingdom
I enter to my own world
Open the gate of a mountain of black
Rising with the shadows
A black world made for me

In my kingdom cold
At the mountains of madness
Unending grimness
On these mountains which I heart

In my kingdom cold
At the mountains of madness
Unending grimness
This kingdom is mine

Frozen and cold.
An existence I do know
In my kingdom cold I enter this condition
Open the gate
Thatâs a mountain of ice
Rising with the shadows.
A cold world made for me
A cold world made for me

Forth after dark
A time I do know
In my kingdom I enter to my own world
Open the gate of a mountain of dark
Rising with the shadows
A world truly made for me

And here we go again

In my kingdom cold
At the mountains of madness
Unending grimness
On these mountains which I heart

In my kingdom cold
At the mountains of madness
Unending grimness
This kingdom is mine...

This kingdom is mine
