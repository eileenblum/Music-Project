[Music: Abbath/Horgh]
[Lyrics: Demonaz]

Black upon the throne forever
Devilish to be
Haunting in the voids
Somewhere only demons breathe

Black upon the throne forever
Demonic to be
With eyes that possess us
Dare you to connect us

Communing with spirits
And souls of the beyond
Cursed in black
Summoned here within

Black upon the throne forever
Never to return
Lurking in the caves
Blacker than darkness itself
Face us
By the damned in black you fall
Speeding with death's wind
Through the gates of the beyond

Red has marked us pure and evil
Black spirits haunt from here
The frozen squad descend
Demonium
The flame burn within

Death rides on demon wings...
Black spirits haunt from here
The frozen squad descend
Demonium
Demons until the end

Until the end
