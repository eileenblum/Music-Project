[Music: Abbath / Horgh]
[Lyrics: Demonaz]

Armoured horses
Gloves of steel
Silver blades
Time to reveal

We're the tyrants that guard the land
Proud upon our gilded thrones

Servants of our great ancestors
Who guarded the gates to infinity

Once kings of shadows
On these blackened fields
All might and domination
Ruled the realms of the above

In conquerable walls...
Weapon of might
Splendour and nobility...
Barbaric times

We're the tyrants that guard the land
Proud upon our gilded thrones

The kings at hold
On their throne
Immortal and invincible
The might lives on

Armies hovered across the land
At the end of the world roll the rivers of red
Beyond that has no man been

Weâre the tyrants
Weâre the tyrants

Armoured horses
Gloves of steel
Silver blades
Time to reveal

We're the tyrants that guard the land
Proud upon our gilded thrones

Moments of time roll
Deep within the mind
Thoughts roam free and endless
Remembering the tyrants time

Weâre the tyrants
Weâre the tyrants
