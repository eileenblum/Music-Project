[Music: Abbath/Horgh]
[Lyrics: Demonaz]

On many ships I have sailed
Far beyond the north waves
On the high northern seas
We have found our way

The shadowing voices of our gods
Singing on the calling wind
Where the cold waves
And the longboats brought us far

The saga of the warriors from Northland
Speak of greatness and strength
The saga of the warriors from Northland
Are the saga of many great of men

On the seas against the open
We travelled on and on
Through the raging winds
And storms we arrived

The shadowing voices of our gods
Singing on the calling wind
Where the cold waves
And the longboats brought us far

With sword in hand I now stand
On my enemy's land
And with a northern heart
I will fight until the day I die, die

My time will be remembered
My time it will be known
By my sons, by my tribe
And by the sun, the sea and moon

For he who battled for his land,
His pride and for his men
Shall be remembered and stand eternally named
In the legends of our land
In the legends of our land

Breathing in winds
From the essence of a roaring horizon
Breathing in winds
From the cold sea
Call the shores of the north
