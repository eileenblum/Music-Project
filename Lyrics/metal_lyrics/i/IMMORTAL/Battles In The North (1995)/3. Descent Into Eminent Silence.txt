Standing in ringwalls of stone
Deepest dungeons
Pass iron gates
Nor the golden sent dreams

Under towers
That once stormed in sight
That never storm

Hill
To the elder ravens
On Bergs laid in fog
Forget not the blasphemic
North deeps

Shadows steal our souls
Into what we once were
Iâm feeling theyâre taking us there

Closed in time
For those who shall not pass our gates
