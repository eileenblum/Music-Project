Frostbitten I became
Forthwith to see
Crystallized dimensions
To where the unfaithful fly
You might say
I'm demonized
yet not the only one
You must come to me
There are nocturnal paths
To follow

Painted faces
From earlier centuries
Wander by desecrating winds
Blinded shadows
Cast out from daylight
And from the beaten lands

Frostbitten I became
Forthwith to see
Crystallized dimensions
To where the unfaithful fly
You might say
I'm demonized
yet not the only one
You must come to me
There are nocturnal paths to follow

Enjoying the circling of eminent silence
Amidst the glacial abyss
Join my yearning emptiness
The knowing of being beneath

Grim and frostbitten kingdoms
