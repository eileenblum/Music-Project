Eyeless in eternal time
For Iâve worn the moonshine
Burning away the daylight glimmer
With my nocturnal senses
Winds have come for me
Winds will come to me
Descending now
Towards the frost moon eclipse

A spectral spirit kingdom rises
In storm screens covered by ice
Night emits its shadow
And thereâs no difference between ravens
They have come for me
They will come to me
To the cursed realms of the winterdemons

Lavender eyes had only known the under dark
From the crypts of stone they ride beyond the blinding glare

Eyeless in eternal time
For Iâve worn the moonshine
Burning away the daylight glimmer
With my nocturnal senses
Winds have come for me
Winds will come to me
Descending now towards
The frostmoon eclipse

Out from the chambers
The horizon will be open for me
To the face of the Earth will know this black silence
For I saw them march
For the lights
