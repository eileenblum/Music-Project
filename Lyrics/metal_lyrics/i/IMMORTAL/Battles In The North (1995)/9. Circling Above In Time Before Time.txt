In time when dragons sprang out from the Earth
I was at one with a blackening moonlit
And from a Berg to the open sky
I saw a raven circle

Born out of thorns to the surface world
Mesmerizing strength
To fly among the blackest rain
And soar into the deepest gorge

For this I would battle kingly palaces
For they learn to be false
And outshine it all that I once knew

Circling above the open sky
To fly among the blackest rain
In the under dark
To soar into the deepest gorge

In time when dragons sprang out from the Earth
I was at one with a blackening moonlit
From a Berg to the open sky
I saw a raven circle

Circlingâ¦

Circling above in time before time
