In circles concentric against the Earth
I enthrone my spiritworlds
Obviously of frost shall be
Blizzard beasts encompassing me
To vipe the faces of the Earth
In memorial to the ones with pride
Glance of day shall never shine
These realms are mine

Master of nebulah frost
Await the solar fall
Creations of ice shall behold
Wings majestic funereal
Guide through spectral lands
None shall pass me there

Hidden within churning chasms of an elder age
Come the mighty sons of dawn
Shadows of aurora
A time for pure holocaust to rise
Decades a thousand fold

In circles concentric against the Earth
I enthrone my spiritworlds
Obviously of frost shall be
Blizzard beasts encompassing me
To vipe the faces of the Earth
In memorial to the one with pride
And glance of day shall never shine
For these realms are mine

Still-breathing valleys
Made birth to the beasts
From the throne of the north
Throned by blackstorms

Creations of ice shall behold
Wings majestic funereal
Guide through spectral lands
None shall pass me there

Throned by blackstorms
