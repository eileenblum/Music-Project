far above the ravengate
The spread wings of Blashyrkh wait
Above the roaring depths
Sits the oath of frost on the elder Raven Throne

Older mountains sleeping in my sight
By chilling woods I stand
A grimly sound of naked winds
Is all that it shall ever be heard from here

Blashyrkh

Cometh the rightful Kings of the highest halls
Cry of ravens lurk the realm
Eternally through the noctambulant grimness

Demons stride at the Gate of Blashyrkh

Mighty Ravendark

Blashyrkhâs Mighty Ravendark

[Incomprehensible]
