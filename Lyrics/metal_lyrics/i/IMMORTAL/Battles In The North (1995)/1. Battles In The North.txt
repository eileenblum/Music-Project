Come forth demonized
Under the banner of Blashyrkh we ride
In the battle sky we lie estranged
Kings of the ravenrealm

We trample bejeweled thrones of the Earth
In an age undreamed of
Viewing myriad battles
Yet our eyes sparkling strident with strength

To trample bejeweled thrones of the Earth
In an age undreamed of
The ones to sit upon the elder throne
With shadowed faces for the coming centuries

Riding towards the masterfields
A ride from the North to the North
By our sacred ravens we are one
In the deadwhite moonlight

Far above is we reign mercilessly
Kings of the ravenrealm
Stronger than ice, stronger than stone
A horde of heathenhearts to come

Battles, battles in the North
Battles, battles in the North

Those who adhere to principle above battle lust
Sing your songs with dying breath

Come forth demonized
Under the banner of Blashyrkh we ride
In the battle sky we lie estranged
Kings of the raven realm

We trample bejeweled thrones of the Earth
In an age undreamed of
Seeing myriad battles
Yet our eyes sparkling strident with strength
We trampleâ¦

Those who adhere to principle above battle lust
Sing your songs with dying breath

For the Kings of the Raven Realms!

Battles, battles in the North
Battles, battles in the North
