Moonrise fields of sorrow
Our mighty fathers fell
Mountain watches memories
Dark shining past

Laid in frost below a bleak sun
Under icicled paths
Mighty were the fathers of Norse men
And in us they shall return

Shine for me fields of sorrow
Shine for me dread moon
And make me never-ending snowfall

Moonrise fields of sorrow
Moonrise fields of sorrow

Shine for me fields of sorrow
Shine for me dread moon
And make me never-ending snowfall

Laid in frost below a bleak sun
Under icicled paths
Mighty were the fathers of Norse men
And in us they shall return

Begun to me never-ending snowfall
