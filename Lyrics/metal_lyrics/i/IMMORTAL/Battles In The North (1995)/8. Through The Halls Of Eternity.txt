In storm I ride towards shadow ruins
Infernally vasts take my sight
Took color my vision
From an endless dripping sky

Paint the visage centuries old
Of those that ride by my side
The hovering steel desecrators

Nearer have I never been
To this I always searched
Crystal-clear opening
In which I shall be gone

From an endless dripping sky
Cryptic visages centuries old
Of those that rode by my side

In storm I stand upon the ruins
Infernally vasts take my sight again
The light is dim before me
For vision was frost
For vision was frost

Chiming bells of immortality
Sing through the halls of eternity
