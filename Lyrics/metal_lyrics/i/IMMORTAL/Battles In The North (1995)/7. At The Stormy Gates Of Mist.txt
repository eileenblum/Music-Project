Endless tall mountainside
Gates to open wide
Lands of dragon birth
Sorrow always rain

On a frosty path to sorrow
Guarded by unearthly beasts
Darkening memories claim
That winter never dies

Bad moons enshrined
In the heart
Northern Darkness
Walk with me hand in hand

At the stormy gates of mist

On a frosty path to sorrow
Guarded by unearthly beasts
Darkening memories claim
That winter never dies

With bad moons enshrined in the heart
Northern darkness walks
With me hand in hand

Endless tall mountainside
Gates to open wide
Land of dragonbirths
Sorrow always rain

What wait eternity in Permafrost
Views that eyes can never bear
At the stormy gates of mist
Iâm still standing
