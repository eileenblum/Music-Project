[Music: Demonaz, Abbath -  Lyrics: Demonaz]

Out in the black night
Cold Northern breeze
Under the red skies
Surrounded by blasphemous winds
Midnight passing and the moon is fulfilled
Slowly blackening the sky
I summon up where the ravens fly high
Towards the moon of Blashyrkh

Death rides on black wings
Evil enter the sky
Angels fall from the heavens
While the darkness shines through
Chariots of the darkest masters
Arrives on devil wings
Heaven's angels surrounded by fog
Forced into the holocaust frozen clouds

A twisted wind
Rapes the clouds
Memories of cold days
And lightning return

Blacker than Darkness
Blacker than Darkness

A foggy fullmoon night
Into darkness rides
Under the horned goat-moon
As dark as black rivers at wintertime

December moon come to me
I ride the wings of Torment
Blacker than darkness
