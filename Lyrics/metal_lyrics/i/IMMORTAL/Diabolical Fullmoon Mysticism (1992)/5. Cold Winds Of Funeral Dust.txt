[Music: Demonaz, Abbath  -  Lyrics: Demonaz]

Under a blood red moon in the cold lakes of Thule
Where wintershadows lies untouched
Where I dwell at the mountains of madness
In these shadows of death I march
In the blue mist of evil

Through the dark Northern valleys
Where only winds of funeral breathe
Hovering through the whispering darkness
With frost in my eyes

Only seven winds are heard
Chiming through the dark Northern valleys
Eternity I pass
Eternity I seek

For the darkness my spirit
For satan my black soul

Under a blood red moon in the cold lakes of another world
Where wintershadows lies untouched
Where I dwell at the mountains of madness
Entering with the cold winds of funeral dust
