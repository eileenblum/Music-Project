[Music: Demonaz, Abbath  -  Lyrics: Demonaz]

Buried beneath the mountains of frost
Years of silent sorrow grim and dark
My winterwings of evil sleep in eternal nights
In death's cold crypts of snow
The moon chimed my return
With black storms I came
And not with the winds

The Northern darkness marches through the coldest night

I can't resist the taste from the winds of the moon
I split my tongue for the taste of these winds
And bath my eyes in its grace
Frost and winter return to my eyes
The call of the wintermoon

Nocturnal clouds blow freely in the distance
In the gray mist of death's horizon
My winter wings of evil sleeps
In death's cold crypts of snow
Buried beneath the mountains of frost
Years of silent sorrow grim and dark

Into eternal nights
Hearing the call of the wintermoon

Northern darkness marches
Through the coldest night
I can't resist the taste from the winds of the moon
I split my tongue for the taste of these winds
And bath my eyes in its grace
Frost and winter return to my eyes
The call of the wintermoon

The call... of the winter... moon

In the Northern tribe!

The moon chimed my return

Hearing the call of the wintermoon
