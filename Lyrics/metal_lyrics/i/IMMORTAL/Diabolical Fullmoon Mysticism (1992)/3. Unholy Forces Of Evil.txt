[Music: Demonaz, Abbath  -  Lyrics: Demonaz]

Slowly crossing 
As red rivers runs below
Forever passing
Where darkness lies unknown
Where soulwinds burns my eyes
Where shadows of lost life hides

Enter the centers of darkness
Where all evil dwells
Demons present in flames
Oath of black souls found

Sacrifices as old as the earth
We cut the living flesh
Circles of the deepest black throne

A promise of the darkest blood found
Unholy forces of evil
Unholy forces of hell

It's delicious
The demons, rising again

It's delicious

A mayhemic silence floats
We await our signs of death our circle's gathered
Ceremonial powers belong to us
A goat baptized in fire
We dance the circle dance on thorns
On thorns

Awaiting the sign of the horns
A thousand black clouds storm
Blasphemous Northern rites
Mysticism touched
Pentagrams burning

Into the centers of darkness
Where all evil dwells
Demons present in flames
Oath of black souls found

Unholy forces of evil
Unholy forces of Hell

It's delicious
The demons, rising again

Unholy forces of evil
Served upon our diabolical souls
Cults of death bathed in slaught
As the devil's candles burns

Into the dark skies
Floating with the soulwinds of the pentagram
To the deathlights where the North star awaits
