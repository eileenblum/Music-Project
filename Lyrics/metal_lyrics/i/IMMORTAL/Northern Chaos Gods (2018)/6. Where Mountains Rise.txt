For the mighty mountains I ride
Through the woods beyond the snow
Like a fire among the stars - beyond the clouds she rise
There's no fire from the sun - in this dark under the moon
My blackened sight behold the stars - and fallen suns below

Darkness rage within my mind - a rage until the final call
To walk the mighty wold am I... black fiend... on I rule
Still no fire from the sun "there is none but the other side"
Awakes my soul to feel the rise - as I walk on my own

Mountains of ice - rise for the one
"Might that occur toward the sky"
Mountains of ice - shunned by moonlight
Now into the bare ice...

For the mighty mountain I ride
Through the woods beyond the snow
Like a fire among the stars - beyond the clouds she rise
"Bring no fire from the sun" there is none but the other side
Blacken sight upon the stars - and fallen suns below

Mountains of ice - rise for the one
"Might that occur toward the sky"
Mountains of ice - shunned by moonlight
Now into the bare ice...

Return to the call of the wintermoon
Welcome to ice - where mountains rise
