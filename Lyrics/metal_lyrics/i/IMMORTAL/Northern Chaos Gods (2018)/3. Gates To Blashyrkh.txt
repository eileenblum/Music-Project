Far beneath the blackened sun - mountains they rise
Far beneath the blackened sun - thunder the ice
Here reign the wicked realm - under cold open sky
Frostbitten world of utter dark "Blashyrkh Unlight"

Far on thy reign
Gods as we ride
Kingdoms of black
To where ravens fly

Far beneath the sky of ice - kingdoms they rule
Far beneath the sky of ice - winter and snow
Here within my wicked realm - open the gates
Throne of winterstorms I heart "Blashyrkh Awaits"

Far on thy reign
Gods as we ride
Kingdoms of black
To where ravens fly

Above the snow rise - frostcovered mount
Ravens up high - far up in the sky
The northern dark - where winterkings rule
Far from the light - gates to Blashyrkh Rise

Far beneath the blackened sun - mountains they rise
Far beneath the blackened sun - thunder the ice
Far on thy reign - gods as we ride
Throne of the sons of the northern darkness
