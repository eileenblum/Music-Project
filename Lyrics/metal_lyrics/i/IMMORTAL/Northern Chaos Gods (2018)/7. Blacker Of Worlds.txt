The dark worlds of shadows formed ages unknown
"Fires to rise from below"
Into the dark voids of the blackened beyond
"Cometh my vision of old"
The battle in my mind "storms from within"
Tyrants of vengeance and war
Unforgotten is the old vengeful ones
When cold winds and ice bite like swords

Worlds - blacker of worlds
Visions to rise - as granted by the gods

... from tales beyond the horizon
They battled the God of the Sun
"Taken to where thunder rolls"
In time when battles begun

In the shadow of the rising "beasts from beyond"
I journey... my own dark vision
Fierce frozen vast... paling moon shine
To the bleak hill of the north
Where rising swords once stroke into fire
I'll gather the embattled ones

Darkly beyond all horizons - gathering roars of war
Soon call to arms - swords to meet thy doom
Awakened by shadows - summon the eldest of gods
Clangor of swords - from whom I had called
