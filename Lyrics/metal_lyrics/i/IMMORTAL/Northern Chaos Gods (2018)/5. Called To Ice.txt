The realm between the tides - where dawn begin to strike the sky
Mist - twilight moons - "I want the tyrants to return"
The doom of all to come - a time where chaos rule the one
Day of awakening - where we throne and reign the end

Thunderous march - fanfares of old
Fimbulwinter - we are called to ice
Sons of the north - darkened tales
Fimbulwinter - we are called to ice

Descendt upon our tome - the countdown to damnation
All dead and doomed - where the end knows day nor dawn
Cometh the untamed ones - so shall we thrive to rule em all
The sum of wrath - soon to reveal it's evil sons

The wrath of the beast descend
Gathering storms in the sky
Daylight darkened - thunder of the ice
The wrath of the beast descend and call us to ice
Across the snows - the throne of all thrones

We are by darkness found - to reveal a time to come
The northern souls - built to survive the eternal cold
Where the frost never cease - where the wind sing eternally
The heart of winter - that precede the end of the world

Thunderous march - fanfares of old
Fimbulwinter - we are called to ice
Sons of the north - darkened tales
Fimbulwinter - we are called to ice
