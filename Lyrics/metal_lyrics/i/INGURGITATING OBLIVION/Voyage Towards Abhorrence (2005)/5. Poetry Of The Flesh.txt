Hast thine eye beheld yon enmity
That dwells in ye Great Deep?
Gazing into ye grand womb, hence
Incising ye vapours that hover above
Why doest thou deify thine own
Ethereal... stillbirth?
Infidel thrall, thou art ye servant of - incessant void,
Thine potency is absorbed by ye barren plains - of yon orbed soul-ruin
Doest thine masturbation by Stygian shores - bring relief?
Ye infamous chasm exhales dulcet symphonies - thou cannot sense
Thus, thou perdition is infinite,
Thou rapest thine innermost companion,
And thine semen restrains thine...
Poetry... of the flesh
Doest thou transgress ye dreams from beyond...?
Thou... rejoicest in thine glory obscured,
Idea parts from ye incarcerated entity
That writhes in physical dimensions,
The Great Deep vomits forth yon
Ethereal foetus - that makes ye angels weep,
Doest thou desire to accept its eyes...?
Art thou willing to transfix ye dreams from beyond?
Thine disdain of ye transcendent symphony enslaves ye image
Of Creation and thereupon bringest forth ye loss of paradise,
Art thou ye one almighty besmeared with ye blood of all gods?
Thine eye beheld yon enmity
That dwells in ye Great Deep?
Gazing into ye grand womb, hence
Incising ye vapours that
Hover above
Thou divest into ye
Exhalations...
To assume and inhale
Ye metrical lunacy
That savest thee from
Ye immanent
Stygian Flood...
Infidel thrall, thou art ye servant of - incessant void,
Thine potency is absorbed by ye barren plains - of yon orbed soul-ruin
Ye infamous chasm exhales dulcet symphonies - thou cannot sense...
Thou divest into ye exhalations to assume and inhale ye metrical lunacy
That savest thee from ye immanent Stygian Flood,
Thou art interwoven with ye pulse beyond,
Doest thou perceive ye desperate call from ye fathomless pits?
Thine disdain of ye transcendent symphony enslaves ye image
Of Creation and thereupon bringest forth ye loss of paradise,
Art thou ye one almighty besmeared with ye blood of all gods...?
