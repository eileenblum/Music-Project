My mind oscillates
Between nothing and eternity
Reverberating consciousness
Offspring of entropy
Dependent origination
Void-spawned incarnation
Ascending from the
Depths of uncreation
Opening the eyes to the sights
Arising from the joy of void
Reflections, thoughts manifest
That never come to rest
Polychromatic blaze unfolds
A multitude of mirrored selves
Embodiment and recollection
Fracturing reality
There is nothing you`ll see
There is nothing to see
There is nothing you`ll see
As you try to perceive
There is nothing you`ll see
There is nothing to see
There is nothing you`ll see
As all emptiness is perceived
You will see...
I close
My eyes
ceasing
the visions
the world...
reflects itself
Through the gates...
Into the shell
which is me...
There is nothing you`ll see
As all emptiness is perceived
You will see...
I close
My eyes
ceasing
the visions
the world...
reflects itself
Through the gates...
Into the shell
which is me...
