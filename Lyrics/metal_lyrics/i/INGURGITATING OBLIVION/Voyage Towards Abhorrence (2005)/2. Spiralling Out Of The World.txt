The journey on which your mind has set
Out of the body
Into the enfolding layers of tranquility
Eyes are claimed by the whirl that whispers
Drawn inexorably towards its centre
And so is the mind...
Unearthly unfolding
As the looming circles permeate all that is
The Vortex descends...
Carried away by this swirling momentum
Frozen in an incessant pattern
You are spiraling out of the world...
