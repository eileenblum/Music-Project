Darkness, black
In the eclipse distilled...
Leaning to look if foot might pass
Down through that chasm
I saw beneath as far
As vision could explore
Looking as if
Just varnished oÂ´er
With that dark pitch the seat of death
Throws out upon its slimy shores
A reservoir
Of darkness black
As moon -- drugs
In thÂ´eclipse distilled
Feeble creature, suffocating, choking, crying, reeling, dying
A cleansing metamorphosis shall sweep away my stupidity
Leaning to look
If foot might pass
Down through that chasm
I saw beneath
As far
As vision could explore
The jetty sides
As smooth as glass
Looking as if just varnished oÂ´er
With that dark pitch the seat of death
Throws out upon...
A reservoir of darkness, black
As witchesÂ´ cauldrons are, when
Filled...
With moon drugs in thÂ´eclipse distilled
Leaning to look if foot might pass
Down through that chasm
I saw beneath
As far
As vision
Could explore...
Slumber, Watcher, till the spheres,
Six and twenty thousand years
Have revolved and I return
To the spot where now I burn...
Other stars anon shall rise
To the axis of the skies
The skies...
Other stars anon shall rise
To the axis of the skies
The stars that soothe
The stars that bless
With the sweetest forgetfulness
Only
When my round is oÂ´er
Shall the past
Disturb my door
A reservoir of darkness black
Darkness black as witches cauldrons
