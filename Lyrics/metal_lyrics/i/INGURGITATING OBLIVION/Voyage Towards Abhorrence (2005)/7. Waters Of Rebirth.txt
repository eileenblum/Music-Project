Fade from stasis Into disgust, misery
And the cold light of dawn
My body breaks to blossoms blooming
The flowers of filth
Entangling roots winding deeper
Enter the womb... wound
Become the festering flesh of mother earth
Sinking deeper the remains
Touching the bitter waters of rebirth
That which is left, leaving
Descend to the inmost darkness itself and beyond,
Become the festering flesh of mother earth
Touching the bitter waters of rebirth
Crawling further towards the promise of an end
Exhale the soul and putrify
Flesh and spirit parting ways
Destination emptiness
Where all creation resonates
Reunite with the current that streams below
Out Into the all-embracing vastness dark...
Exhale the soul and putrify Flesh and spirit parting ways
Destination emptiness Where all creation resonates
Thoughts arise
Like clouds of flies
From my corpse on which they dine
A swarming mass
As memories scream
Raving of the final dream
Escape the vicious ways
Into the waves
Permeate the sea of fate
Reunite with the current
That streams below
Dissolve within the pulse
Throbbing perpetually... in eternity
Lest the call of resurrection
Awakens us and we drown
