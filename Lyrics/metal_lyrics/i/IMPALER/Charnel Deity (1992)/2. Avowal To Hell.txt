Will to end lives
And pain their souls till the death
Scorch their minds, set me free
My agonies will detonate
The malice in my blood is pure hate
Kill to strike back
Got to feel their power crack
Tear your life away
Terminate and take the soul.

Daggers of hate rupture your flesh
Slicing the nerves, there's no life left
poisoning your mind, your blind to see
You'r going to rot eternaly.

[Ch.]
Terminal despair is yours come the day
I gloat as the weel of fate grinds your life away.

As sudden pain shatters your limbs
Your endless journey to hell it begins
As sudden power shatters your mind
You see no avoiding the death of mankind.

[Ch.]
Terminal despair is yours come the day
I gloat as the weel of fate grinds your life away

Cry for the avowal to hell.

[Lead - Mariotti]
[Lead - Drew]

Violence is bred in mortals
I am here to test your force
Show weakness and I will slaughter
Evil campaign takes it's course.

[Ch.]
Terminal despair is yours come the day
I gloat as the weel of fate grinds your life away.
