Inferno unleashed, a new dawn of time
The past is lost, the future is not mine
Burn the innocent, a sadistic reign
Murder by nubers enjoying your pain.

Black night of judgement spawns death from the beast
My blood shall be swallowed on my soul they shall feast
Sun peels back, earth sinks to the sea
Drowned in madness, inferno consumes me.

Condamned forever
Draind of all hope
No doubting our fate
Is at the end of the  rope
Visions of nightmares
Malignant dreams
A world in chaos
Ripped to the seams.
