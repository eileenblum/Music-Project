Rejoice in the sight of the mangled and stamped
Raging skull drillers in bloodied goat mask
Skinning Fathers, cast them into the fires
Behold, the hog headed God shall reign

Repel your fate.

Death blanked from your mind
What you reject still exist
Can't you see.

[Ch.]
The sound of liberation is the collapse of the church
Consumed in perverse conflagration
Christendoms debauch.

Christ, so he rose from the dead?
Why does death now create fear?

Faith which does not doubt is dead faith 
You can't accept, forced to hear.

[Ch.]
The sound of liberation is the collapse of the church
Consumed in perverse conflagration
Christandoms debauch.

Charnel deity feeds upone energies
You refuse to see.

The sights of liberation is the collapse of the church
Consumed in perverse conflagration
Christendoms debauch.
