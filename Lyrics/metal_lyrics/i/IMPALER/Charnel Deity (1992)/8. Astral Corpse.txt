Still the God of slaves
Punishes progressive thought
The hell in which you're born
Is destined to drag you down
Down to a lake of fire
Damnation  arrives to seal your souls demise.

The city of God is falling 
As Sodom and Gomorrah before
His ruins will be the habitation
Of demons, remnants of your soul.

Convulsed with hellish thoughts
Burn your astral corpse.
[Repeat]

Commanded by God of slaves
Dig your own grave
Surging towards the brink
Your God forgives - you think!

Claw at the stony ground
Salvation's not to be found.

The dead in Satan will rise
To the sound of demonic cries
Abandoned ways crumble to dust
God of slaves finally crushed.

Claw at the stony ground
Salvation's not to be found.

[Solo - Drew]

Claw at the stony ground
Salvation's not to be found.
