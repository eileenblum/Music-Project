Satan is the master deciver
And the father of lies
Pulling blindfolds over Christians eyes
Destined to burn in the fires.

Driven through caverns of hades
Foul demons gnaw at your flesh
Your mortal life is taken from you
But your soul will never rest.

I give my command
Thousands shall fall
Wasted lives
I take them all.

Fire, I'll burn your flesh 'till death
Sadistic lust for terror
Charred to mere consciousness
Hatred strives forever.

I give my command
Thousands shall fall
Wasted lives
I take them all.

[Lead - Drew]

Damnd by your weakness
Your denied your evil side
New dog in priestly white
You have nowhere to hide.
