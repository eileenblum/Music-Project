Time is suffocated
Actions forbidden
Subconsciously paralysed
Internally rotting.

Sucked in and churned out
By the force of  lies
Swarming ignorance
Imagination dies.

Chaotic supremacy
Controls the population
Decrepit fools
Have mass domination.

Intimidating
Antagonizing
Blindly we obey
We must rid ourselves of this inner decay.
