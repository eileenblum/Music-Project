Unexpected cold
My skin and clothes soak
Submerged in fluid
Terrible panic I begin to choke
Garments cling heavily
The weight tires my weary frame
Shrieking, crying
No one hears my dying.

Drowing, dreaming
Silently screaming
Thrashing I go down
Compressed body drowns
Suffocation, desperation
Dismally I cannot surface to breath
Intimate visions
Manically rush before my eyes
Can this surely be the climax
Of life befor it dies.

Struggling, falling
Help me I drowning.
