Trying to know
What's your tag
From your code

Freeze the drain
I'm your pain
...your control

There's a way
I will pierce
...Into your core

Hold your files beyond the wall
You won't stop me

Obsession
Revise your mind
Solving your code
...waiting for your fault
Forsake me
I'll break inside
to erase your word

Trying to know
What's the tag
In your code

Don't touch me
Eating your brain
that's my law

(I've) found a way
to crack your soul
causing you blindness

Hold your world beyond the wall
You won't stop me

Obsession
Revise your mind
Solving your code
...waiting for your fault
Forsake me
I'll break inside
to erase your word

...brainless program
...you'll fear me
...'cause my identity is pain

System drain
Error line
Your bytes mean regression
I am blind
Found a virus now
crushing walls

System down... no protection
The walls won't stop my infection!
