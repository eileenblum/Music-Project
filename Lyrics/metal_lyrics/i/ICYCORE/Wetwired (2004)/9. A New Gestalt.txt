One crash inside my blaze
a feeling that I can't ignore 
like trapped into this core

The new strange sound of my voice
these hands, these eyes, are they mine?
Upgrading inside the life

Ethereal sea
bring me to my desires
Electron winds
give strength to my cold fire
fly high

All my life, was out of shape
finding patterns to compare
(now) they will die
while I can shine

All the noise resounding here
It's like unwritten harmony
What you gave me
it's more than life
a chance

Won't choose the sidewalk of time
Recalling what's real
Extending wings in all my deeds

Ethereal sea
bring me to my desires
Electron winds
give strength to my cold fire
fly high

All my life, was out of shape
finding patterns to compare
(now) they will die
while I am here

All the noise resounding here
It's like unwritten harmony
I'll fly alone, outstanding
Inside my world

Thousand voices inside
calling my name
Catch me, shape me
what will be now?

What you gave me
it's more than life...
...a chance

What they told me was to obey
to a pattern in the flesh
just reflections in the noise
that actions can create
Now the voice inside of me
it's like a form without a name
so It's the time to shape it!

...a new gestalt
