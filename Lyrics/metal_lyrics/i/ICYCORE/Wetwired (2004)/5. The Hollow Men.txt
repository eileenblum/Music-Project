Eyes I dare
not meet in dreams
cowering
behind them

Keep on falling
lying with you
in the wind
of twilight time

Dying light
remember

Let me live

Hollow men
you can't help me
only choice you have
watch me burn inside

Stuffed men
keep denying me
in your world you're dead
falls the Shadow

Keep my hands
this time
fall with me
now to eternity
I'll go on
I'll bring to you
like death
dark dreams of
our life again

Stand with me
with pride
hiding won't
this time
save me

Fade no more
your light
bound to live
my true I

Live your thoughts
just try
find inside my mind
find me

Keep untold
my night

for this time
I can't die

The Hollow men

Keep my hands
just try
fall with me
now to eternity

Like a ghost I

Keep untold
my night
for this time
be with me

Eyes I dare
not meet in dreams
but this time
I will know who I am

Keep on falling
lying with you
in the wind
of twilight time

Dying light
remember

Let me be
