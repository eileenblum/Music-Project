Stand, in front of these
useless emotions have gone away
Creed, this is my reign
for shall I deny the flesh and the blood
Free, from space and time
A nameless design of reality
Cold, once felt before
Relieving that moment, touching the void

Life after life
abductor of sin
but all is a lie
Addressing to someone, to something
the wrong part of me

I have seen all before
The good and the wrong, interior desire
Come, this is my reign
virtual insanity...
...this is the Net!

Try to erase all again
The love and the hate that I've had
Try to forget all the pain
Crashing the borders of life

Stand, in front of these
illogical nightmares now gone astray
Proud, feeding my brain
with knowledge and hunger consuming the man
Dead, only the flesh
Mnemonical order surviving inside
Cold, once felt before
a word in December...
...but now feed the Net

Try to erase all again
The love and the hate that I've had
Try to forget all the pain
Crashing the borders of life

Try to erase all again
the love and the hate that I've had
Try to forget all the pain
crashing the borders of life
Try to erase all the pain
Crashing the borders of me
this is the Net!
