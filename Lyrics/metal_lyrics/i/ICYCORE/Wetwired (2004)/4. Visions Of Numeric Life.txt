Of myself I've no control
Glowing structures rise like walls
Prompting words I can't decipher

Falling now into the void
I touch matrixes like toys
In a strange deafening silence

Fearing no more my time
That shapeless passes by
Leaving behind my mask

I can see the destiny
Of human data files
My new form is shifting wild
I feel like I'm
Rolling Bouncing Bumping
Crushing Glasses Falling
In a pinball of my own

Data paths are now so crude
Showing lives from where protrude 
Tracing patterns of how users live

Neural networks fill the place
Leaving me a little space
Moving on is now so heavy

Fearing no more my time
That shapeless passes by
Leaving behind my mask

I can see the destiny
Of human data files
My new form is shifting wild
I feel like I'm
Rolling Bouncing Bumping
Crushing Glasses Falling
In a pinball of my own
