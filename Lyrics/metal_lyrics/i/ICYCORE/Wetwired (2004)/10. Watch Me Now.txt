New
The substance and the shape
The only remains of me
Is what I recall
New thoughts new dreams
New life forever

Just
Few traces left to show
What I used to be for the world
Don't think I'm still there
Take a look at me you'll learn

But some times
(I) recall what's left behind
It happens just a few times
To see the loss is vast
But when
There is one single choice
You can't make mistakes
My decision then was right

I'm the nail in the cross
My fear will have no voice
I'm the shape of your pain
So watch me now!

Changed
To just remain myself
Blurred images of me
Held by a mirror
With the surfaces
stained by my past

Streams of data
Kind of sperm
Scattering out of me
Fecund what they meet
Give a birth to a new life

But some times
(I) recall what's left behind

It happens just a few times
To see the loss is vast
But when
There is one single choice
You can't make mistakes
My decision then was right

Missing link in the chain
Numeric thinking mass
The new shape of your pain

So watch me now!

When all the words are said
When all the dreams are dead
When the present is pain
There is only one left thing
the truth
use the truth
use the truth
USE THE TRUTH !

But sometimes
(I) recall what's left behind
It happens just a few times
To see the loss is vast
But when
There is one single choice
You can't make mistakes
My decision then was right

I'm the nail in the cross
My fear will have no voice
I'm the shape of your pain
Watch me now
Missing link in the chain
Numeric thinking mass
The new shape of your pain

So watch me
now!
