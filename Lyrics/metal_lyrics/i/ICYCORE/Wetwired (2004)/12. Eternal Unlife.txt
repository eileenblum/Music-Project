When I started
I was just going away 
...fallen angel in the net
My thoughts are now
freely roaming around
I possess a different mind

Free to feel electric dreams
wasted body no more mine
Now I know the meaning of my being
be the one who made the choice

From the world departed
a few steps away
I'm not living day by day
My organic form
is now superseded
I'm a brand new form of life

Free to feel electric dreams
wasted body no more mine
Now I know the meaning of my being
be the one who made the choice

Lonely
I've no more gone astray 
Sadness
Is now for me an empty word
I am breaking
All the oppressing chains
Free to be
What I wished to

I'm living alone

Somewhere there's a place
with the colors of your soul
someone may have found
and left a sign

Who is torn inside
has the will to climb
over the walls of time

Now come what may
I see the light again

Surrender to new life
where of life there's no more trace
numbers breeding a new race

Shadows deep inside me
were tiring my will to be
I felt like a nameless sign

Now come what may
I see the light again!

No more crying
no more crying
no more crying
crying
crying
crying!

Lonely
I've no more gone astray 
Sadness
Is now for me an empty word
I am breaking
All the oppressing chains
Free to be
What I wished to
I am lonely
I've no more gone astray 
Sadness
Is now for me an empty word
I am breaking
All the oppressing chains
Free to be
What I wished to
