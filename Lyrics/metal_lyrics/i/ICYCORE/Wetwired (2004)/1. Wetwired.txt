Please tell me now a valid reason
not to leave it all behind
Your lies ablazed
The pools of pain
Drilled a hole in the soul
I had

I thought that
I could have been strong
There's no more reason
To fight the pain
That's the sign I've searched for
I need no more

The surgeon cuts his damned way
(To) the place where I hold the pain
(To) put inside this tired mind
A new reason to be

The things now fit into place
Blood and wires
Is all I see

New things improving me
Choices, voices
Then you

Tell me I'm on the wrong side
Change me so I'll fit it all
Rejecting all of the things I had
The scalpel cutting deep

Now I tell you the only reason
For I am still here
A selfish death to kill the pain
Kills your body and your soul

The scalpel has cut the place
New reality now to face
Running through streams of spikes
Running away

The things now fit into place
Blood and wires
Is all I see

New things improving me
Choices, voices
Then you

Tell me I'm on the wrong side
Change me so I'll fit it all
Rejecting all of the things I had
The scalpel cutting deep

My Choice

CHOICE
WETWIRED
EMBRACE
THE PAIN

Now I got this new sight
I'm the truth between the lies
There's a place, now is far
I've the skill, I've the time
