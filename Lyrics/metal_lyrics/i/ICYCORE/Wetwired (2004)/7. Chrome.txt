I was filling an empty life with empty lies
Closed inside my fortified self
I searched on the floor a reason for my own fall
And getting up was just beyond my strength

There is a day that I recall

Eyes with no life inside
My mirror watching me
Tried to recover means to life
Fear was then like a nameless friend

Don't rely on eternal world or kingdom
'Cause when you die you will have no time

You will be no more
So believe in the words you feel

from this hellish thing

I'm giving you the form that you need
that you need!

There is a day that I recall
Eyes with no life inside
My mirror watching me
Tried to recover means to life
Fear was then like a nameless friend

Weirdest thoughts I never knew
Kind of new dimension
Feeling now, giving strength to the
entity I am

Forever forever you'll be
However you may loosen your grasp

Forever forever you'll stay
And never forget your last day

Loosened from the bonds you had in that world
Free from my mortal thoughts
You are no more but still you stay
Clusters of files now form my brain
No chance to recover
No way to get over
Remember of the life you didn't love
But I want it back
somehow

Forever forever I'll be
However I'm loosening my grasp
Forever forever I'll stay
And never forget my last day

There is a day that I recall
Eyes with no life inside
My mirror watching me
Tried to recover means to life
Fear was then like a nameless friend
