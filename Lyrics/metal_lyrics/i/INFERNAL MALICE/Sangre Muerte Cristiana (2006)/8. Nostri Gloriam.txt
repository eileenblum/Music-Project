A dark cloak covers the earth
the lives of light escape terrified looking for a place,
a place to hide from the night hunters.
It's time of leaving toward the most dismal in the earth
but my soul only takes me to the forest of eternal wisdom.
Only in the dune willing to everything, I contemplate the arrival of the somber thing.
A devastating cloak takes possession of the universe
The satirical creatures emerge cavalier
Waking up all our deep instincts
The carnivorous beasts wake up with voracious appetite
of foot infernal warring infidels
in march to the annihilation fields
sanguinary legionaries razing to the pestilence
there is a flutter flag of the great possession here
The boisterous scream of the night explodes
The fog of the forgetfulness and silence wake up
The funeral winds approach
In the desert of the sin we enjoy
With infamous songs and hymns of glory
Tramping pestilential deities
A devastating atmosphere, a stench of death accompanies us
Havoc in the valley of the shades
Bleed everywhere
The boisterous scream of the night explodes
The fog of the forgetfulness and silence wake up
The funeral winds approach
The darkness this about to go away
but the nightmare of my name begins
and it began for all the lives of light that inhabit the earth.
I moved away from the forest, for when the hour it arrives, to return,
prepare my disappearance again, that wears away me and it consoles me.

And will return the proclaimers of the silences
And the flames will lick in the dark cosmic spaces and the earth
And their voice will be complaining and destructive of the vortex
And will return the tortuous roads of the ambush
