the mystic night thunders
the mystic rain thunders
chains without descending end of the evil
while my veins seeds
red pearls of evil
writing the destination
with the black ink of pain.
The sunset of the damned circle is manifested
glorifying the dirty souls
evangelism's victims thirsty of vengeance
beasts men social banished
Damned warriors of the darkness to the throne
they murdered the Papa and they will eat their flesh
and they will be sunk in Darkness
and the victory of the men will be sapient.
with the present apocalypse
we play the bells of hell
with the fulfilled prophecy
we unlished the gates of Hell
