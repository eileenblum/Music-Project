Comatose the desert rules
Its dreamtime mind reflects in pools once there
The fringe is dying fade away
To the darkness of another day's nightmare

Cumbersome it's choked with sand
The price is high with no demand buy now
The desert's eye is killing you
Its burning rays are grilling you die now

Quench your thirst oh can't you see
Mirage is but a fantasy you know
There must be water something swims
It's just your head but not your limbs stay low

Your dusty tongue is licking salt
The dancing dunes say it's your fault
Pay now
Look up a never ending sky
Reads your last rites it's time to die
Die now

Xerophyte lives
It breathes
It's called your bluff
It feeds your disease
Xerophyte's wild
Not tame
It owns the desert
It's time to reclaim

Devour all with tongues of sand
Indigenous exiled from barren land
Man paid for his greedy ways
Now counting down the end of days

Dead core Lord of the flies
Is the lord of the sands
Soon the law of the land
Fight for a chance to survive
Beating death you're alive
It's your life you can thrive
Slave whore the sun shrinks away
Night time swallows the day
System shut down delay
We will reclaim what is ours
What the desert devours
Don't allow our planet to shrink away

Xerophyte dies
It writhes
You've called its bluff
You've torn out its eyes
Xerophyte's child
Is slain
It's lost the desert
No more to gain
