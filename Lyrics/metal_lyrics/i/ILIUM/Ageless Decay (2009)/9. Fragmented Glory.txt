Years ago in darker days
When health was crippled
By the plague
Men in armour standing proud
Yell their battle cries so loud
Young boys shown the way to kill
And face the enemy on the hill
Taught that war is glorious
To fight for their kingdom

All are lining up to fight
With their metal glaring bright
The final moment has begun
The order given for all to run

Warriors wielding swords
Fighting to protect their lords
Hatred rushes through their veins
No time to cry or feel the pain
Winning is the only way
But many men will lose today
Bloodshed on the battlefield
Fight for their freedom

Terror, anger, fear and hate
Certain death, a violent fate
No one wins in the end
Lose your life or lose a friend

Charge racing off to kill
Slaughter the enemy
Each man will fight to win
Fulfilling his destiny
Charge racing off to kill
Slaughter the enemy
Each man will fight to win
Fulfilling his destiny

Charge racing off to kill
Slaughter the enemy
Each man will fight to win
Fulfilling his destiny
Charge racing off to kill
Each man will fight to win
