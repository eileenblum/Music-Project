I stand alone here surrounded by ice
Its voice speaks to me
I am its sole deity
And it bows to me in awe
My power grows
A subject of idolatry

My trusted friend
My soul mate is this harsh blue land
Comfort sought and found
Sacrificed on icy ground
And it speaks to me in whispers as I stand
Relinquish now my sanity

Thunder in your eyes
Trapped within your mind
A meteor arrives
Burning through your sight
Devoured by the night
Evolution's throes
My vision comes and goes
A new god now grows
Whilst I write

I'll follow through the ages for idolatry
I bow down to your majesty
My faith is stronger than the fantasy
I'm your soul's disciple in your grace for

I know you are God
I am prisoner of earth
I lust your guidance through the stars
The forbidden path I now take
To risk my soul through suicide

I risk my life through suicide

The years have passed
Yet my vigour hath not waned
I see a dim light

My former god
A semblance of a man
A prophet stands here
Beaten down
Shackled and damned

You've dragged me through the ages for idolatry
Now standing victor over thee
My lust is greater than your empathy
I feed upon the idol that now falls to me
Almighty God
Fall to me almighty god
