I hide away when dawn brings light
I float away on plumes of darkest night
I travel on the blackest way
Entwined with darkness
And the slow brooding veil of decay

Like a moth
I am a creature of the night
Into the darkness
Death entwined - why am I
So drawn to light
Awakening my sight
Dichotomy my plight
Tormented I'm a mothcaste child

I fear nothing but the sun
Its glaring eyes burn through me
This blackness runs
Within my veins

Riding high on the starlight
The dark night protects me like a shroud
I am regent on the dark side
The burning of a lamp
Is all the light that I'm allowed

Like a moth
I am a creature of the night
Into the darkness
But then why am I
Drawn to light
Awakening my sight
Dichotomy my plight
Tormented I'm a mothcaste child

A creature of the night
I'm lusting after light
Sheets of darkness steal my sight
Forever I moan on the wind
The darkness begins
To lure you in
