Mission Mars
An expedition to obtain the youthful stone
A cure at last
A drug injected to release the new hormon

Grim Reaper overthrown
By this super genome
No side effects are known

The rocks return
A media storm ensures the market soon will burst
Life sustaining tomb
In youth you shall become immersed

But you must die first
A cold wax beauty is dispersed
This blessing is a curse

Ageless decay
Your body perfect but it's now devoid of life
You won't fade away
You try to scream but still you face the coronary knife
A timeless death a sleight of breath to all you seem to have passed on
Paralysed your listless eyes so mesmerized cannot convey how they are wrong

No anaesthesia
The dead don't feel the pain
A mortal seizure
Imprisoning your brain

Ageless decay
Your body healing from the coronary knife
You won't die today
But still you're buried can't they see you're still alive?
You're aching skin conceals their sin, wounds are healed but no one knows
You're buried deep you'll never sleep your soul not reaped upon your coffin...
