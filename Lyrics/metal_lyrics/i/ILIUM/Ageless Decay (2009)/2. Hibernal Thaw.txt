In the darkness of our lives
It seems you need a heart of granite to survive
In the valleys of our souls
The shadows cry in pain they can't escape the cold
But am I the only one?
Exposed and freezing in the blazing desert sun

Never shall I shake the hold
Of this surreal infernal cold
Ever in its icy mould
My freezing hell remains untold

With the logic of our minds
You'd think we'd find a way to value all mankind
In the fine print of our laws
Is there a precedent to start Hibernal thaw?
Half the world don't even care
If the other half are well or even there

Never shall I shake the hold
Of this surreal infernal cold
Ever in its icy mould
My freezing hell remains untold

The winter of our discontent
Defiles our church and government
So many think they're heaven sent
But are the last ones to repent

Never shall I shake the hold
Of this surreal infernal cold
Ever in its icy mould
My freezing hell remains untold
