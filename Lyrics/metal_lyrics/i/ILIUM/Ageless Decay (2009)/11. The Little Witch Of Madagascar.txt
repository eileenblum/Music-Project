Through the bustle I the market
Villagers are unaware
The little black pro simian
Observes them with its worldly stare

Scuttling through busy streets
The villagers now turn and freeze
Just another precious one
Points at them and walks away

The little witch of Madagascar
is a messenger of death
The little witch of Madagascar
A chill is running through your veins

The crowning jewel of the ocean
Haven for the bizarre
Centuries of superstition
See the magic fade away

Scuttling through busy streets
The villagers now turn and freeze
Just another precious one
Points at them and walks away

The little witch of Madagascar
is a messenger of death
The little witch of Madagascar
A chill is running through your veins

The little witch of Madagascar 
is a messenger of death
The little witch of Madagascar
A chill is running through you veins 

The little witch of Madagascar
Demonised - a tribal myth
The little witch of Madagascar
You should hang your head in shame
