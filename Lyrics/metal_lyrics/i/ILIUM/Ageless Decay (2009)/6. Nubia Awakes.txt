Sand breathing in the desert
Choking on an ancient death
Calls from a sunken tomb of old

Long ceased decomposition
Ghostly voice of Anuket
This pharaoh's return has been foretold

Desert moves in respiration
Breathing with a blackened wind
See a spiral forming on the ground

An ancient face is reconstructed
Come to carry those who sinned
Anubis searching with him 'til they're found

They came
By night
And breeched the sacred site
And stirred his sleeping soul from rest

Pharaoh returns
The night air starts to churn
The ancient king begins his quest

Valley of the Kings re-opened
Naked corpses lie in wait
Raped now of their dignity in death

Shadow of a lurking jackal
Gorging hunger eats their fate
An underworld thirst drinks their fading breath

They came
By night
They breeched the sacred site
In Hades hear the distant bell

Pharaoh
Came forth
The thieves were dealt his wrath
Their souls went screaming down to hell
