The slo'mo action replay shows a pliant twisted face
The child runs screaming wildly
To the newly bloodied place
His hostage breathes in hitches
A car speeds in the distance
Blood soaked on the windows
Breathes his final breath

Fast forward to the future
To the man with tortured heart
The one who steals the bodies
Before rigor mortis starts
His wife now staring blankly
Her whispers float away
His grief propels him onward
Bring her back some day

There's a manor in the country
lts rooms are occupied
but never laughter ventures past its doors
A dry and sterile coldness
In the rooms they never die
But neither life is cradled in its walls

By day he's a physician
A well respected man
His surgery has saved so many lives
An unknown neo-mortician
A saviour for the damned
But he knows that he is running out of time

He has contacts in the zoos
But they never know his name
Desperation brings them to him
For their rare and precious game
And society's elite
Have a casket waiting for them
Never meeting him in life
Sleeping in the cold unending night

There's a manor in the country
All its rooms are occupied
But never laughter ventures past its doors
A dry and sterile coldness
In the rooms they never die
But neither life is cradled in its walls

Now the years torment his presence
As his gnarled and wrinkled hands
Rub his temples as he tries just one more time
And he falls upon the carpet
There's a whisper in the air
And his wife's hand reaches for him
And her cries come back to haunt him
As he fades she comes alive
But he's not there

There's a manor in the country
All its rooms are occupied
But never laughter ventures past its doors
A dry and sterile coldness
In the rooms they never die
A woman sobs eternal
In its walls
