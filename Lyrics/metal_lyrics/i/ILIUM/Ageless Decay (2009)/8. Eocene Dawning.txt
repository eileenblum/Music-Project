Breathing in the misty air
Illuminates a speckled coat
The sunlight trickles through the leaves
Piercing the majestic trees
A lustful vision seethes

From the first small step
A mighty race stampedes
From a tribe amongst horses
Derived the most astounding class of steeds

Sentries in the canopy
Watching, waiting for their time
A shift in power, primal urge
Take these steps toward the earth
Stand firm on the verge

Seeking guidance from the stars
They speak of great heroic deeds
They speak of how the small beast stands
Dominating all the animals
Taming all the lands

From the first small step
A mighty race commands
From a nervous clan of primates
Is derived the maelstrom known as modern man
