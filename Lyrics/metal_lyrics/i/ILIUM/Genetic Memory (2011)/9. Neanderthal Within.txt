Look upon his furrowed brow
Cast a shadow in his eyes
A long gone age creeping back
The time recedes but still survives

Head spins like a carousel
No memory of the recent past
Metamorphosis begins
This blurry sight is now his last

Now it belongs to Neanderthal within

A Pleistocene figure in the future's recent past
Neanderthal man in a modern man's cast
Survives
True identity revealed, mind thrown back
Falling through the epochs
See them dying

Neanderthal within
Prehistory survives
None so cursed to sin
Falling through time
Calling from the past
The embryo begins
Though the man could never find
The placenta in his mind

Captured in the name of science
Neanderthal can't understand
Standing strongly in defiance
Locked up strongly in demand

Experimental blueprint
Laboratory his home
Depression grips his soul
He must escape the into the cold

Running through the forest
His spirit calls him home
A cave is in the distance
No longer he will roam

His long lost clan of countless years
Within the fire now appears
A restless spirit from the past
Into the fire free at last

Look upon his furrowed brow
Cast a shadow in his eyes
A long gone age creeping back
The time recedes but still survives

Head spins like a carousel
No memory of the recent past
Metamorphosis begins
This blurry sight is now his last

A Pleistocene figure trapped within the past
A modern man's soul in Neanderthal cast
Must die
True identity revealed, soul was never born
Waken the memories
The future dies
