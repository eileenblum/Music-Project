I remember that day
When I was seventeen
I'd lost my will to live
Life was just a rancid dream

As I swung from the noose
I could hear them scream
My neck was broken
Not for long it seemed

Set me free
These damned wounds always heal in me
Let me see
What's on the other side of life
I can't stand the misery

I remember that day
When I was twenty four
My father died
And I didn't want to live anymore

As I choked on the poison
I could hear them scream
My system shut down
Not for long it seemed

Set me free
These damned wounds always heal in me
Let me see
What's on the other side of life
I can't stand the misery

No one left but me
These damned wounds always heal in me
This desert was a sea
And these bones are all that's left
To witness my immortality
