Long after day retired
We saw St. Elmo's fire
It soothed our sleeping souls
And took the cold away

A window to a world
Within the waters swirled
It called for us to come
And led us from the troubles of this place

We found a new enlightened race
An ethos we could all embrace

A perfect beauty in a fragile well
A fleeting universe, ephemeral
Our stay too short but now we have to tell
Returning here like being damned to hell

A perfect beauty in a fragile well
A fleeting universe, ephemeral
Our stay too short but now we have to tell
Returning here like being damned to hell

A perfect beauty in a fragile well
A fleeting universe, ephemeral
Could no longer stay here now the pond we see
Below its surface set us free
