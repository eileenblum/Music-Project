Your scarlet tears congeal in pools
Around your road worn feet
Your golden aura dimmed and left you
On your own and incomplete
The rose now grows with spider veins
Blemishing your cheeks
The bile that chokes and gags you
Is the only green you've seen for weeks

Colours are mutated where the palette cannot reach
The grimy underbelly where the light cannot be leached
Hues are corpses in a world
Where shades of blackness swallow day
And grey has stained the rainbow
In a world where hope was ripped and torn away

The sky a constant charcoal
Blue is felt but never seen
And azure as sure as sickness
Feels as though it's never been
Violent is as close a colour as you'll ever know
And your spirit oozes like black ink upon the virgin snow

Colours are mutated where the palette cannot reach
The grimy underbelly where the light cannot be leached
Hues are corpses in a world
Where shades of blackness swallow day
And grey has stained the rainbow
In a world where hope was ripped and torn away
