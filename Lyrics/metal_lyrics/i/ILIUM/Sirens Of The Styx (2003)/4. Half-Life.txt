Time is the healer
Space great concealer
Life makes you wonder
Struck down by thunder

And as you feel your body rot
You're alive and then you're not
An eerie presence digests your soul
You're in Purgatory's hold

Sound is a blur
Sight been deferred
Nothing left to view
Desease has captured you

You're alive and then you're not
An eerie presence digests your soul
You're in Purgatory's hold

You're alive and then you're not
An eerie presence digests your soul
You're in Purgatory's hold

Power leaks your brain 
What was your birth to gain?
Asphyxiate your breath
It's brought you to your death

And as you feel your body rot
You're alive and then you're not
An eerie presence digests your soul
You're in Purgatory's hold
You're in Purgatory's hold
You're in Purgatory's hold
Your shackled soul has now been sold
