In a world of eternal dreams
A time where bravery engulfed morality
Beowulf, under the Wielder of Glory
The son of Edgetheow
The servant of Hygelac
Would become the Heorot of the Danes

Grendel, man, monster, demon
Tearing at will through the land
A blood lusted orgy of man
Hygelac must end this feast

Beowulf our wielder of glory
Son of Edgetheow
The servant of Hygelac
The Heorot of the Danes

Beowulf sails with the warther Geats
Saltwater whips at his face
As he pictures this creature of evil
Banished a kindred of Cain

Beowulf our wielder of glory
Son of Edgetheow
The servant of Hygelac
The Hoerot of the Danes

The benches were cleared for Beowulf and Geats
The stout-hearted warriors bore strenght in the feast
The song of the poet rang strong in the Heorot
The carousing of people singing of victories

Rage inflamed, wreckage bent
He ripped off the jaws of the hall
His eyes lit like fire by night
Fuelled by proponquity of pain

Grendel reached out with unfreindly fingers
Hygelac's brave kinsman tore through tendons
Grendel found flesh and bone had failed him
To Beowulf the glory of the fight was granted

Beowulf our wielder of glory
Son of Edgetheow
The servant of Hygelac
The Hoerot of the Danes

Beowulf our wielder of glory
Son of Edgetheow
The servant of Hygelac
The Hoerot of the Danes
