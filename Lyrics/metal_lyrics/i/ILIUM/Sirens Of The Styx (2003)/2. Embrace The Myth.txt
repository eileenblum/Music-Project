Salamander's fire
Immune - the flames burn higher
The dream will never tire
Fuelled by its own desire

Hear the voices of the netherworld call your spirit
Death is to mock and life is to fear
The abstract wonders of old your mind wil soon inherit
The dim fog of Stys tells your soul is near

Reality is now imagination
Destiny is yours to decide
Authority lies trapped in crystal cages
Your enemy locked out - you're mystified

Material world full of merciless hate
Sense of wonder is lost - forced back to Hell's dark
gates
Dissipate the seeds - the magic is weak
But it can be reclaimed by those who set out to seek

A spiritual journey - is Heaven so near?
Once we've pushed through the smog everything is so crystal
clear
Deathis to mock and life to fear
Immortality yours -  you are your future's engineer

No going back - a willing prisoner
Cerebral attack - your mind alive
The forgotten track - a path you shall enter
Find your own way

Dull pains of Earth - are left behind now
Non-currency worth - your mind the key
Eacg grain of dirt - a magic goldmine
Do it your way

Join the other race
No prejudice is your mind
A plane that has no place
To the soul that is so blind

Embrace the myth - what have you to lose?
Your sanity is there to amuse
See the world in different views
Embrace your myth - it's the path you must choose
