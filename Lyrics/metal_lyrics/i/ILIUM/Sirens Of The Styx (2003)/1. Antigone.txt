The fight is over now, both are dead
Which way will I turn?
Polynices, Eteocles my friends
Both in blood we're bound
Fought for the Polis, take it for their own
But now death's seeds are sown

What is happening to the system?
Is this really Dikaios?
Where is my free will?
Family or Polis - who can tell?

Creon the Polis supports Polynices
As he fought for the state
But I cannot bury only one
Fear miasma my fate
Creon sees Eteocles a traitor
Turning on his state
What is happening to the system?
Is this really Dikaios?
Where is my free will?
Family or Polis - who can tell?

My life of pain has taught me this
That no one reign ensures you bliss
Be true to me 'cause I'm the one
Not the state who can bring me undone

Creon has now lost his family
Haemon, Eurydice
Creon's tragedy is now overt
Now he sees his guilt
Oedipus my father of the curse
Has led us all to death
