[feat. Jamie Hanks]Theodore, I believe I can hear you speaking my name.
But if that's the case, then I might be going insane.
A mirror that won't reflect my face,
with sleepless nights and thoughts of hell
burning through my brain.

I'll find you, and tear you, limb from limb.
'Til I find where your where your fucking true heart is.

And what the fuck can you do to stop me now?
Now!

And did you think I'd forget everything, you did and fucking said?

Get on on your knees,
and kiss the fucking concrete.
If you think something will save you now,
Cause nothing will save you now.

Let the darkness blot out every inch of the sun
from their eyes!
Hurt,
I will bring you.
I've been waiting for far too long.

Tied your hands up, wrapped, duct taped, around your mouth.
Silent, seductive, and cruel.
There will be no pleasure in this,
Well at least not for you.

You make me hate the human race! [2x]
You make me hate this fucking race!

And when it's all said and done,
nothing is going to be okay.
When it's all said and done,
nothing is going to be okay.

You make me hate the human race!
You make me hate this fucking race!
