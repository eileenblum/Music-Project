For all these pointless years that I have wasted here
Yet still I hope for the chance to cut you ear to ear
Constantly wishing for the day to come
When I can rid myself of what this worlds become

YOU'RE FUCKING DONE [x4]

Your ignorance will spread and kill us all
I've been waiting for the Serpent to come heed my call.
You have no choice there is no hope you all are going to fall
Pray for the end of days to come destroy you all

DESTROY YOU ALL.

Destroy!
Deadweight!
