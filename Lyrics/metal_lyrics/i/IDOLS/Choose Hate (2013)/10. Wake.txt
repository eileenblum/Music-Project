Run, just as fast as you can, your death has come to fruition. 
Your death displayed for all of them to see, your body putridly burning from your disease. 
Flesh, and sinew stripped from bone.
Dismembered corpses, we make our throne.

Run, just as fast as you can, your death has come to fruition. 
Your death displayed for all of them to see, your body putridly burning from your disease.

(Some shit I don't know) Now you're just another trophy to me. Your head will be mounted on my wall.
You, something something. 
But I'll put you in a body bag like any other.
Something something, lined up and ready for you. You've got your bags packed, this is your last chance, you've got a head start, savor your last breath.

But I am the hunter, and I can smell your fucking blood. 
The hunt is on and I'm coming for you and your fucking throat.
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, your blood is warm and it's gonna be mine. [2x]

You are the beast, and I am the butcher.
