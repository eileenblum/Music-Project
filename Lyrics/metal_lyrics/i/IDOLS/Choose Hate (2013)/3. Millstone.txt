I Am A God!
Like you've never seen before

Consumed with tragedy
Dead bodies washed up upon the shore
Soon after being dumped
And stomp their faces into the floor

Will you fear me now? Like no other god before.
Wrapped and bound with a rope tightly around the neck
Millstone to hold them down
Beaten closely, but not to death.

Before being dumped
They see the holy face of God
After being raped, bludgeoned and beaten by their scorn.

I am fury
I am the unholy face of God
I am the fulfillment of eternal life
And you'll never see the end of this fucking plight.

NOW!
There is no need to hide your eyes
The horror will consume and soon abide
There is no need to close your eyes.
Don't shut your fucking eyes.

You will now be forgotten,
You will now be forgotten,
And you will suffer!
