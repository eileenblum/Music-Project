Why have you gone?
You left me here alone
You gave me everything
But your time has come
And I feel
that light has gone out of my life

I'll try to soothe my desperate heart
Such are the tears
i have no words to describe

Why do i gotta pay it so hard?

Some words unspoken
Things we've never done
I wrote this song for you
Few silly words
maybe I find you afterlife
When I die
When I find
The light...
