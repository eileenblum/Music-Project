I'm lost in the tide
the truth I must find
sailing in the sea of chance

No lighthouse in sight
A shipwreck adrift
In a rebelling sea

"Nomine too in acternum"

[The Drowned]
"Reto senso. Rumo certo.
Mero credo. Vil desperto.

Tal pensar. Ardil Concreto.
VÃ£o. EfÃªmero. Disperso."

[Soul]
I am a philosopher lost across the sea
How could it be fair If my opinion was so brief
Until I incur conclusion over something I don't know
I have to navigate in this great sea of chance

How could I blindly believe
(In all those waves of things)
I cannot stay anchored here
(In the sea of uncertainties)

A sea where many rivers and their streams flow
All of then laid drown a sand of truth that I must know
We all are an intertwine of ideas and thoughts
Of which we create an ocean of information
What is the flow of the truth?
(Wind blows from different sides)
I won't let myself drown in illusion

I realize
I'm just one drop
I'm part of this same sea
But I can be a part of the
Wind that blows on my ship

Hence, don't take offence
Hence, do not disturb
Awake Poseidon's rage

I am the sea
I am the word
I'm one drop on this wave
Someday you'll find
Drifting away
All the things you became

Don't try to cast disgrace on me
(I'll take all boats away)
All evil cast flows into the same sea

I learned someday
I'm just one way
I'm part of this same sea
But I can be a part of the
Wind that blows on my ship

I realize
I'm just one drop
I'm part of this same sea
But I can be a part of the
Wind that blows on my ship

I'm the action, reaction
