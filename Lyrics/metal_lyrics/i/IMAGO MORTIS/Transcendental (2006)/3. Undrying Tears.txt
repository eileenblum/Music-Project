I know your tears
Can not be dried
I tried to reach you
But could not find

You pray with your heart
But it's not about faith
That's why I ask you
Not to give up

Oh, how I tried
Oh, how I cried
Oh, how I miss you
Oh, how i sigh

Dismal words you
yell to understand
Why does fate
often come up with an absurd?
But what are we?
And the dice it rolls
Who are we to question life?

Death never was to be desired
My dying have not been in vain

Oh, how I tried
Oh, how I cried
Oh, how I miss you
Oh, how i sigh

No matter what I'll wait for your time
This life is just a moment we'll leave behind
Our existence will last until we meet again

Oh, how I miss you
Oh, how I sigh
