I cast myself
into the borderline
I redeem my faults
I've got the rein of my life

Here comes the wind of change
It makes us realize
there's no more touching olace to be
than here and now

Once and for all
I throw all my past away
shadows of death don't make me afraid
You dry the tears from my eyes

Before the wind of change
Blows for your life
You need to learn to love
All things around
