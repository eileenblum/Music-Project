Anubis was in the Parlor Of souls evaluating a newcomer
The ancestors and relatives then came to greet him
They were in a place called Capella."

You Left Your life - It's True
I'm coming back to recuse you

You think I'm crazy
The body is lazy
But Feel your senses full of life
Stronger Than before

You real self gets true
No pain will last for you

You Hear the calling
Of those who drowned
they have been awaiting
Welcome to the hall of the souls

Know who you are
Now you can see your face again
Energy flows intensely
Casting the grief and fears away

Where are you now ?
You glimpse your past lives once again
Just let your soul remind you
You'll know what I've been waiting for

Let me medicate your soul

Through the looking glass
You recognize yourself

The place you one lived in
With all your friends around you
And now you ask me
Why you're in the hall of souls

Know who you are
Now you can see your face again
Energy flows intensely
Casting the grief and fears away

Where are you now ?
You glimpse your past lives once again
Just let your soul remind you
You'll have the answers one by one
