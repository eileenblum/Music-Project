A worthless spirit overdrives with joy
wistful ways prevail

A maroomed soul between worlds
Hermetically scaled
Your death meant nothing
So unworthy as your whole life

Kidnapping minds as a Vampire
Disease and misfortune all around
Your energy frequency is very low
Bewildered Vile Soul

Your heart beseeches love
But still no one hears you
Cursed one in your legacy of sorrow
Still has no joy

Feeling solitary
trying to cross the frontiers
Trying to warm what's freezing cold
Trying to find some hope

Kidnapping minds as a Vampire
Disease and misfortune all around
Your energy frequency is very low
Bewildered Vile Soul

Your death had no meaning
Your life, even less
And now you cry for help
When I have no words to tell you

trying to find conforting words
trying to catch some touch of hope
Trying to get out of the void
trying to send an S.O.S

Look at the world
What you see is what you can catch
Or does existence slips with the wind
Like emoke spreading with the wind

And I try to find the evidence
I try to hold something good in this poor humanity
I always carry on with my innocence
When I'm searching for a touch of divinity
