[Bonus Track]

Let me unbind your mind
With my brazen blade
Let me cut you deep to bring out
The truth that youâre afraid

Bring out your dead
Bring them to the fire
Bring out your dead
Bring them to the night
Bring out your dead
Bring out your desire
Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead

Let me show your fear
Let me show your grief
Your forbidden passions
Your repressed tears
Let me show your secret love,
Your pain and your belief
Let me show the caves inside your cliff

The interdict of the death will be
The only law to break
The transgression will be shown
As the only way to take
Let me make you hear the voice
Screaming inside your head
It demands you to bring out your dead

The seduction of the cadaver
Will lead you and make you see
The horror of the body
Will finally set you free
The interdict and the transgression
Together as one
Life and death forever will be
