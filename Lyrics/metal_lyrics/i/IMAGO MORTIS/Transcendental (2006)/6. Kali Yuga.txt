Trapped in yourself
The chains of fate will catch your head
(It's pointless fight)

Your body will be consumed by
The old soil that you step on
Decaying, fading, falling
Know your fate

I know that you fear
In time you lose all your feelings
And know that you see
The iron age of Kali

Only if I could change

You're judged by
the weight in goods that you show

Side by side
the old values are sebduced
On behalf of the material culture

Behold the decline
Dirty coins dictate rules
Hypocrisy reaches the Zenith
Kings become Thieves
Thieves become Kings

Only if I could change
It wouldn't be this way
Only if I could change
Consciousness
