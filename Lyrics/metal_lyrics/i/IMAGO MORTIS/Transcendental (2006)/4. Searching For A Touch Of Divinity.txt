This night I feel that something going on
Wide open arms, my feeling is much too strong
Like a child I'm lost and distant, running around
My weary eyes will find a compass of my dreams

look at yourself
Beyond the reflection of your eyes
Face the immensity of the abyss
Where the will can't reach the soul

I call the challenge of echoes from my being
But I stumble on the things that made me cry
Happiness in fragments is all I ever had
And the memories are getting out of sight
