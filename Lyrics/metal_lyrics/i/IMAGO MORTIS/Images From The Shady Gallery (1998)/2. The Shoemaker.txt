The waiting darkness holds things,
deep into the colors of dream
Living tones of suffering,
hidden shades of sadness within
Blinded by its painful glimpses,
I can see It flashing back my life
The waiting darkness holds things,
shining on the blade of my knife

I'm the shoemaker
I know how to heal your disease
I'm the shoemaker
I will put your anguish at ease

The mournful sounds that I hear,
ghostly symphonies of the past
The weeping tunes of my fears,
dying lips expiring at last
Dancing by the silent music,
I can hear its dreadful voice again
The mournful sounds that I hear,
harmonies of steel, blood and pain

Hear the shoemaker
Words of delusion and hate
See the shoemaker
Pictures of a man and his fate

In the dark
Dying woman crying weakly
In the dark
When I love, I love too deeply
It's all gone
[The Voice from the Pit:] Life isn't fair
It's all gone
[The Voice from the Pit:] But death and despair
I'm a slave
Killing for my sacred mission
[The Voice from the Pit:] Kill for my joy
I'm a slave
Of nightmares and hallucinations
[The Voice from the Pit:] Live to destroy

[The Voice from the Pit   Charlie the Head:]
Kryos Mary Krystos
Kryos Krystorah
Kryos Mary Krystos
Krystorah Krystorah

I'm the shoemaker
The last note of one sad symphony
I'm the shoemaker
The final verse of my elegy
