Sleep tight, my unborn child
Sleep tight, sleep tight
Sleep tight, my unborn child
Sleep tight, sleep tight

Close your empty eyes, my child,
close your eyes and dream
I'll be close to you,
I'll hear your silent scream
Won't you cry no more,
I'll wipe off your dry tears
It is not me you fear
Sleep tight, my child
