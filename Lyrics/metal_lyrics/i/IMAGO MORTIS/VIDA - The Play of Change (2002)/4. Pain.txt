[I wake up in terrible suffering. I'm alone. I cry for help.]

[Me:]
I don't need more flowers
I don't need more sympathy
I don't need more integration
Treatment, I don't need

I don't need more pain
I don't need more pain
I don't need more pain
This hunger in my veins

Give me what I need
Give me what I need

I don't need more candies
I don't need more self-esteem
I don't need more conversation
Advisory, I don't need

I don't need more pain
I don't need more pain
I don't need more pain
I'm starving inside my brain

Give me what I need
Give me what I need

[Enter Endorphine.]

Want to ride the tiger
Want you even more now
Want to climb the spider
Want you my desire
Want you getting higher
Want to read the Times now
Want to hear a song then
Want you my desire

I need it
I need it
