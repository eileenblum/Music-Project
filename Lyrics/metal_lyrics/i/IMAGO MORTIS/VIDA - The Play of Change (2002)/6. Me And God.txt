[Me:]
Dear father
In heaven
Make peace at my true heart
I suffer
Dear father
Feels like one missing part
Dear father
Forgive me
If I ever forgot you or done you wrong
Including this song

I'm not used to 
Praise the love for you
What I feel is greater than a pray
Now I'm begging you
I'm down on my knee
But my soul don't knows what to say
Let me try again
I'll resume my pain
Dear father, show me that you hear
Cause I feel you so near

Give one more chance to me
Give one more chance to me

I know that I'm no saint
My freedom wrongly spent
But my sin was to love the life you gave to me
Dear father, will you hear?
I'm bursting into tears
I have suffered enough, father, can't you see?
If you have love for me
If you do care for me
Dear father, I beg you, don't fail me
If you just listen to me

Give one more chance to me
Give one more chance to me

[God:]
Do you understand me now?
You don't understand at all
Do you really know me now?
Look at yourself
See what I mean
That's what I want you to do for me now

[Me:]
Give one more chance to me
Give one more chance to me
