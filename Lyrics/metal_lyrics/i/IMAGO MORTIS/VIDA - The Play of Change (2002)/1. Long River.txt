[Inside the ambulance. The sound of sirens. I feel cold and heavy sleep. The sirens sound distant. I shut my eyes closed, reopening them beside the margins of a river, through which one balsa slowly approaches. I think I know the man that leads the balsa, so I walk to the margin. Then I see dead men emerging from the waters.]

[The choir of Drowned Men:]
Let it drown
Let it drown

I step into the balsa.

[Charon, the Coriphaeus:]
Understand that rivers flow to the Ocean
So will this one that now we sail
Understand the beauty in the need of these winds to come
Beautiful ship so fragile
See this fish that feeds the man that will feed the worm
Then to the salmon feed again
Does the fish ask why to die or to be born?
Why the worm, the hook, the man?

Let the Long River run
[Drowned Men:]
We all gonna drown
Let the Long River run...

[Charon:]
Life is short, friend, there's no time, you must realize
Till death takes you by the hand
Understand that to us all death is no surprise
So be prepared, my dying friend

Let the Long River run
[Drowned Men:]
We all gonna drown
Let the Long River run...

[Charon &amp; Drowned Men:]
Waters go by beneath the skies
Running from my eyes
As long I sail, my will prevail
When wind ceases I will die

[Charon:]
Understand you have to let the Long River run
Understand you have to let the Long River run
Let the Long River run...

[I fall from the balsa, sinking into the deep icy waters.]

[Charon:]
Let the Long River run
Inaction is action
Now you know the way
Let the Long River run...

Run over lover and mother
Possessions and mind distractions
Run over pushing too far
Run over family, enemies,
Religion, friendly prisons,
Boring days and my guitar

[I drown.]
