[Darkest night finds me cold and awake in my deserted room.]

[Me:]
To sleep
To die... that's all
No more

To sleep
To die
Perchance to dream

I shall no longer close my eyes until it's dawn
To see how lifetime dreams may die when light is gone
No bitter sadness blurs my sight, tears I'll refrain
Now is the winter of my pain: it was all in vain

This night I woke up from some tragic, dazed dream
To which I, forceless, could resist but never win
Poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage
The lights are off, the crowd is gone, 
the show now wants to die of age

I shall keep my eyes awake
I shall keep my eyes awake
I shall be strong
Carry on
Keep my eyes awake

I shall no longer close my eyes until it's done
To see how lifetime dreams may die with flesh and bones
Good bye old dreams, good night sunlight, tears I'll refrain
I need no reasons for my pain: it was all insane
