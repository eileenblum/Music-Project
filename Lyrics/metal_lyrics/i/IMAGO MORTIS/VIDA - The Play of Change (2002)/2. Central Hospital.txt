[I open my eyes. I'm inside a hospital room.]

[Me:]
What happened?
I think I fell asleep
I feel so cold
I'm all alone
I feel so weak
I can't move on
But I tried
I wonder

What happened?
I think I'm still asleep
They took my clothes
They took my name
They took my home
They took my pain
As I turned
Into a number

White walls, gray door
White pills, gray jar
White moon, black floor
White cell, gray bars

What happened?
I see faded colors

Fated colors...
I wonder
