[Enter three persons, each one dressed in White, Gray and Black. One by one, they recite their terrible speech and leave.]

[Me:]
White one said to me how thin my life supposed to be
Gray one called it delusion
White one said that I suffer from a doomed disease
Black one called it salvation and sin

White Gray Black spinners of this vulgar fate
The thread of life is not broken yet
I defy you to rewrite your lines 
Redefine my part, rearrange all this play

Why me?
Why me?
Why? 

[Beautiful enough, Moon arises.]

[Me:]
Why, sister Moon?
Why do paint my fate so gray?
Why, Three-in-one?
Do reduce me to this play?

[Moon invites witches.]

[Me:]
Vida!
Vida TrÃ¡gica!
