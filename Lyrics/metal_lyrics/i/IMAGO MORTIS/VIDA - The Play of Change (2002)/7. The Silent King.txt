[Exhausted, I fall into crimson slumbers and dream about the devil.]

[Devil:]
Yes, I am...
[Me:]
...the Silent King!

Devil, speak to me
Oh, as a friend
I depend on you
Please take my hand

You devil tell me
What can I do?

[Devil:]
Do what you will...

[Me:]
That's not an answer
I want the truth
I know you can bring something new
I want to be just like you wanted me to
Like a Silent King

[Devil:]
Yes, I am...

[Me:]
Devil, understand 
Oh, it's all right
You can take my soul
For one night stand

I know, in devil's lies
May lie some truth

[Devil:]
In the silence...

[Me:]
Since I've been my own god
I've changed my rules
Evil is just one silly name
To what in me demands to my own demand
Like a Silent King

Look out!

[Devil:]
Yes, I am the Silent King.
The hangman's lucky lack
Can you tell me what is like
My teeth right on your neck?

Yes, I am the Silent King.
The mirror from the past
What is like to pay your bill
When just one minute is last?
