Ominous / Absorption of the decadence / Hollow eyes staring from the walls of the trove / Nameless abhorred trophies of morbidity bestowed deep with the foundations of our dominion lies the key to our own oblivion / Collection of the carnal mind a twisted sense of the
sublime / Collection of the carnal mind the dissonance of extreme morbidity / Excavation of the darkened antiquity / The legends of one buried for five centuries / Pale moon casting horrible twisting shadows / The stench of the rotting coffin so foul / Collection of the
carnal mind a twisted sense of the sublime / Collection of the carnal mind the dissonance of extreme morbidity / Revelling over the ancient grotesque occupancy / Howls roll across the pains heard but unseen / Skies scream a vengeful cry / Marked by the beast that can
never die / Terror grips the night skies through haunted trees in darkness its disguised / Whispering in a foreign tongue foretelling our demise / St. John was ripped and torn asunder / " Marked by the beast that hunts the ones who vex and gnaw at the dead"- The Hound /
I must return what I have stolen from that holland grave to save myself from that same bitter fate / Still thirsty is the maw / That drives to self annihilation / " Claws and teeth sharpened on centuries of corpses "- The Hound / The Death toll ceases to end / I hear it
calling / Calling from the shadows / Calling for my death unhallowed / So unhallowed
