Their semblance begotten upon man / The foulness as you know them / Wretched be the spawn spewed forth from her fertile womb unglimpsed by those who fear your name / Bow to your worship the goat with a thousand young / What gestates from your writhing from the key to
call forth the old ones / Open the gates / Upon the hill the sacrifice be made the blood is spilled through your rites we call out your name Yog- Soggoth become the aperture vital to open Yoggoth / Your realm betwixt the stars / Bestow your bounty upon those who serve
your will / Your fertility knows no bounds / Ever gaping is her womb / Her spawn born of sin / For we delight in blasphemies against the christian god / Honour her supremacy / Let the women mount in ecstasies of debauchery as we chant and bathe in the blood of our
enemies / Howling neath cavernous bowels beneath the earth / " They wait patient and potent"- The Dunwich Horror / Their visage unseen / Your acts of malicious worship beget the suffering / The foulness as you know them / Wretched be the spawn spewed forth from her
fertile womb unglimpsed by those who fear your name / Bow to your worship the goat with a thousand young / What gestates from your writhing form the key to call forth the old ones
