In shadows of catacombs we lie in wait to feed the taste of death upon our tongues releasing feral needs / Tear them open let us feast / Pick them clean / With vehemence we strike / We are now hunting the night / Ravenous rapture at the graves we will pry / The night is
upon us as we bay to the sky / Defilers of god succumb to the will of damnation / Relinquish our flesh to be twisted deformed banish thyself from the light / Beyond the torment of life / Seek truth within the darkness / We are the scourge our numbers are countless /
Enshrouded in infamy upon the weak we shall besiege / Soul to decay / A ruthless transgression defile innocence / Leave their bodies beyond recognition / Compiled human desecration / Their flesh so frail / Orgasmic in consumption / Prevail in dominance of the night
desecrate the bearers beneath this hollowed ground / Enshrouded in infamy we thrive / We are the thousands in the night
