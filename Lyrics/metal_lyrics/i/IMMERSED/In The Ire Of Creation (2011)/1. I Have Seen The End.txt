Epochs before humanity / Descending from the darkened stars beyond / They claimed the lands / From within their cities / Creation of primordial life / Dawning the pestilence of man / Like playthings to a child using and discarding the things that they create / To the
skies rose their cities but beknownst to them annihilation / At the hands of malicious gods / Their talons stretching far / Their dreaded idols sustained withing their places of worship / Their rites howled through their seasons / I HAVE SEEN THE END
