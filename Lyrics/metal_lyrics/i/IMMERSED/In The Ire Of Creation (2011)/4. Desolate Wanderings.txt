Rapture in the barren wastes of Roba El Khalyeh / Such solitude awaits in shadows beneath the sifting sands where they crawl / Festering within their forgotten tombs possessors of the arcane arts / Cast out and left to die / The carrions hang in the sky / I curse the sun
awaiting the night / What whispers in the darkness / Knowledge that I seek / What was forgotten I shall reveal / Unleashing it upon the masses of the meek / In my desolate wanderings / The path of necromancy / Scrolled upon these pages that ive scribed / The knowledge
of the ancients / Let terror guide the way to where the dead hold their secrets in bone oh so decayed / To where unearthly sights are beheld / To where the demons brood loathsomely as they swell / Traverse along the banks of the nile amidst the fallen temples wrought
from the beating sands of time / In my desolate wanderings / The path of necromancy / Scrolled upon these pages that ive scribed / The knowledge of the ancients / In the wake of gods / Await the tide advancing
