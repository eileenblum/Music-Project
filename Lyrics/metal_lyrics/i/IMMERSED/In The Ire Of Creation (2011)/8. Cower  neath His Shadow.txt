Let the chants ring high / The time of mankind has come to an end / We're calling from the altar / The rising cyclopean structures rise above the waves break forth from the shackles of your tomb / Upon the lands lay waste and consume / Who will oppose your power? With
the eyes of god turned away / Where will you turn to when the darkness is the light? Like the swarm eclipsing the sun descend upon thy enemies crush them into dust / Like the sword he strikes down flesh without mercy / Usurp and reclaim with only the will to rule to
conquer / Cower neath his shadow / Bow at his feet / " In his house at R'Lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming " / " Nam fo seitic gnirettot eht hguorht stort yaced sa peed eht ni smaerd dna siaw ssenemoshtaol "-Call of Cthulhu / The time has come the tides will rise /
Madness engulfs the lands revelations of unholy minds / Within his tomb a deathless sleep loathsome eons revolve their course / The stars are right again / Where will you turn to when the darkness is the light with the eyes of god turned away?
