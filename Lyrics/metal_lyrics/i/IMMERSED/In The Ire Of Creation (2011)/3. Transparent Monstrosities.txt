Dissolving / Reforming / Photoplasmic entities converge and combine / Forever consuming / Imperviousness to time / To behold its form is beyond conception holding no shape save that of substance perpetually reconstituting it own distinction / Behold the frozen waste /
Within the cities walls they lie in wait to seal your fate / Inhuman dominance remains no longer sentient / Sifting through the walls their presence ever present / Lost to oblivion / To be consumed is to be absorbed into its essence / Myriads of churning lights / Convey
a mockery of the stars bewildering perceptions / A being so terrible defying all the known laws of this dimension / Development of conscience comprised by their own will / Casting down their masters to rule what they have built atop the mountain / Deathless Beyond the
fowl reach of time / Formless with a thousand leering eyes
