Born from the skies a malignant apocalypse forcing claim of sovereignty / Crushing all who oppose shall be cast down / Before Their legions the elders fled and trembled into the safety of the depths / Call forth the rise of what hails beyond / Let their shadows cast
across the skies in the ire of creation / Desolation under a blackened sun his dreaded form appears / As we call forth / The rise of what hails beyond / Loathsome upon his wretched throne in the ire of creation / His dreaded form appears / Terror be thy name / And for
uncounted years / In darkness they shall reign / Until the angels of the stars cast down their plague / In bitter rage / Retreat to the shadows / As R'Leyh skins beneath the waves / The gods dethroned yet their will still remains / Within time they bide ever watching
from the gates / What Hails beyond? Abysmal realms of darkness / In the ire of creation / From the lake of the frozen northern winds came the elders stand tall / Flesh if the offering of penance for the gods / Mankind shall fall
