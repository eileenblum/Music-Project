The Empty Frosty Tundra
The Dense Snowy Taiga
Governs Cruel Siberian Cold
Blood In Lived Get Stiff Cold
Frost Like Murderous Corrosive

The Band Hunters From Trunk Yenets
Desperately Searches Food
As Well As Pack Hungry Wolfs
Ravenously Expecting In Hiding Place

Siberia
Frozen Guardian

The Solitary Reindeer, Pound Hoof
Searches Below Ice Remnants Graminoids
The Beat Will Speed Up, Hunt It Anticipates
Today Yet Hunger No Die

Siberia
Frozen Guardian

Arrows Flies, Reindeer Falls To The Earth
Only Winner Regaining Prey From Battles
Fight Was But Cruel, All Are Dead
Vultures Swoop, Banquet Begins
