Iron Bar, Smelly Cell, Last Dinner By Request
Today Is Day Paying Debts, Today Is Day Your Deaths
Loud Strike OÂ´Clock Deaths, Could Sweat Scale After Body
Your Eyes Sees Cheap Coffin, Waits On You Grave Without Name

Bad Time, Bad Place, Off Day, Powerful Opponent
Wealthy Lie Kills Truth, Above Her Grave Sounds Laughter
Crushing System, Corruption Governs, Wealthy Lives And Poor Will Fall
Money Determine Who Has Truth, And Whom Pertains Halter

Why? Ask You Why? You Are Yet Innocent
Miscarriages Of Justice, Halter Throttles
To Pieces Broken , Truth Shrugging In The Corner

Rotten System Is Powerful Rival
Money Determine Rules Games
Who Will Hang And Who Is Innocent
Who Will Pay For Foreign Debts

OÂ´Clock Deaths Again Strike
Could Sweat Scale After Body
Cheap Coffin And Nest Of Vipers
Today Is Day Needless Deaths

Why? Ask You Why? You Are Yet Innocent
Miscarriages Of Justice, Halter Throttles
To Pieces Broken Truth Shrugging In The Corner

Last Dinner, Last Words
Behind Bars Cries Future Widow
Last Journey After Long Hall
Lie Again Wits To Your Damage
