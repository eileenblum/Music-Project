Falling Tear, Tremulous Body
Bleeding Heart, Silent Cry
Evasive Eyes, Sweating Hands
Spite And Hate Hangs Aloft

Slaves Regime, Confusion People
Death Train Waits, Cow Truck Are Full
DavidÂ´S Star Is Shining On The Breast
Last Journey, Meeting With Death

Selection People, Live Or Death
Wooden Shoes And Bare Head
Roar Beasts, ChildÂ´S Cry
Tatters On Bodies, False Showers

Pile Vesture And ChildÂ´S Shoes
Stripped Bodies Steps To The Chambers
Thousand Lives And Their Way
Unwillingly Ends In This World

Violet Crystal Turns In Gas
Last Vibration
Chamber Is Full, IsnÂ´T Where Fall
Die Upright !

Holocaust!
