Dragging Step And Hectic Shake
Feeble Bodies, Martyred Legs
Latent Fear, Blood On Weak Arm
Longing Endure To The End Roads

Death March, Broken Soul
Death March, Lost Fates

Menace Deaths Urges To Tramp
Extracts Last Remains Coming
Children, Elds, Woman And Men
For Human Beast No Difference

Death March, Broken Soul
Death March, Lost Fates

By Step Without Foods And Drink
To The Open Gates Infernal
Bullet For Help, Whipping For Weakness
Death Is Aim-Devilish Plot!

Death March, Broken Soul
Death March, Lost Fates
