The Father Off All Sins, The Father Off All Vice
And His Children, All Other Sins

Pride Only Pride The Governs, Humiliti Sits In The Forge
Excessive Self-Respect Be Reflected Mirror
Behind Mirror The Avarice Stand With Trust
Together With Envy Wait For His Time

Pride, Avarice, Envy, Anger
Debauchery, Gluttony, Sloth
Seven Deadly Sins
Controls Today All The World

Humility, Charity, Favour, Peacefulness
Chastity, Temperance, Energy
Seven Virtue
Dies In Forgot

Envy And Anger Go Hand In Hand
Debauchery And Gluttony Are Babies Pride

Human Sloth Already Straddle Anybody
The Sin Stated Norm, Grace Are Defect
Evil, Sin And Lie, ItÂ´S Pleasure For Devil
Already Nobody Knows, What Is That Truth
