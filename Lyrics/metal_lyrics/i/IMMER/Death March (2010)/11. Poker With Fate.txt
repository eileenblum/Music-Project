Momently Stiffened Space And Time
As Hard Stone Incarcerate On Parched Desert
In Palm Wet Sweat, Pent Couple Of Cards
Bet Be High And Rival Hardest

Cards Stirs Fate Alone, Pool Belongs To Him
Somebody Has All Honours, Other Is Intended To Loss
DoesnÂ´T Go Nothing But Wait, What Card Will Next
And What Will Come In Next Play

Poker With Fate Is Losing Game
Always Is It He, Who Has All Honours
Poker With Fate Is Losing Game
Loss Be Given To Forward

On Face Rival Grimace Of Devil
Hope On Success On Side, Go Down
Hard Game About Soul Slowly Ends
And Candle Of Life Burn Out

Last Play, Last Moment, Last Examination
Sometimes It Seems, That The Luck Is On Reach
But Is It Delusion And Wistful Wish
Now Stopped Time Forever

Poker With Fate Is Losing Game
Always Is It He, Who Has All Honours
Poker With Fate Is Losing Game
Loss Be Given To Forward
