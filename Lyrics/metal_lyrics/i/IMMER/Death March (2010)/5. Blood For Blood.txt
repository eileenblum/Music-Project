Wooden Block And Sharp Axe
Pillory And Executioner â The Work Waits
Premorse Will â The Arm Who Stole
Only Bloody Stump Will Stay On Thieves!

Blood For Blood
Live For Live
Eye For An Eye
Tooth For Tooth

Thief And Murderer â Is Smiling Today
The Fact Be Behind Below Weight Money
The Corruption, The Lie â Govern To Truth
Today Anybody â Insentient Guilty

Blood For Blood
Live For Live
Eye For An Eye
Tooth For Tooth

Return Back â To Old Tradition
Behind Drop Blood â Pay Blood
Murderers, Thieves â HavenÂ´T Conscience
Hands And Head Topping Baskets
