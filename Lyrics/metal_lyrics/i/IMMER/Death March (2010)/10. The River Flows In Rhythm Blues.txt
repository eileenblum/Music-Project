The Son God Of Darkness And Goddess Of Night
Unkindly Gaunt Old Man Of Crude Morals
The Ferryman Gamy Behind Gold Coin
Carries Across The River Beyond

The River Acheron

The Bodies However Must Be Interred
Crude About Shelter The A Gold Coin
Then Souls They May Take To Ship
Look With Hope For The Second Bank

The River Acheron

The Souls Of Graveless Wanders Along The River
They Ask For Conveyance For Ever
Grumpily Charon Is However Unflinching
Who WasnÂ´T Interred That He Propers

The Unkindly Old Man, The Son God Of Darkness
Saves His Coins Behind Eternal Service
Sails For Agens Between The Two Banks
Limits Among Life Crude Death

The River Acheron
The River Flows In Rhythm Blues
