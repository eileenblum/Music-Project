the first ray of sunlight killing the night
darkness losing mysterious power
nocturnal predators seeking a shelter
resting until sunset comes

daylight is rival of mine
i have been nocturnal for a long time
waiting for twilight in the dark
let my self dream about blood

silent noise of bat wings
gloomy birdsong of little owl
prediction of the death getting closer
prediction of absence of tomorrow

twilight is spreading over the landscape
the last flashes of the light
iâm looking at the chosen one from outside
she has no idea what gonna happen today

your blood and my lips,
they are like the morning red sky
one of my bites - your silent cry
kiss of the death - the resurrection

white spines sharp like a diamond
black eyes deep as the abyss
soul as deep as night dark is
hungriness, which never got enough

her blood in my veins
got her soul in my core
when she wake tomorrow
i will welcome her in the empire of undead

your blood and my lips,
they are like the morning red sky
one of my bites - your silent cry
kiss of the death - the resurrection
