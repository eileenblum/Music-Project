gloomy morning, terrifying night 
fast pulse, cold sweat
confused mind, sweaty palms
knees shaking, vague memories

dreadful dream â hard nightmare
mysterious figure holding an axe
saw his own body falling down
longer after he saw his head rolling

woke up and relieved
head is still on the neck
it was just a nightmare, 
here is a new day

sat until the dream was chased away
then he smiled dressed up
it was just a dream, no big deal
innocent hanged  â what does it matter?

put a wig on and dressed a robe
ready to play false play
coming out and the last he saw -
mysterious figure with resolve in the eyes

wig falling from his head
and head is falling from the neck
the right hunch, it wasnÂ´t a dream
today was very short day
