another nail in the coffin is appearing
the death shows its teeth, devil is smiling 
heavy cup above head, knot under jaw line
and above grave is the lie with passed pain

the true is dying
the lie is expanding

the lie inherits name and all property from the true
even its face is changing â perfect chaos
no one is versed whose face who keeps
who really crying, who just lying

glory of   true long time ago fell down
success of the lie celebrated on all battlefronts
pretending true, the lie giving requital
wishing to believers wonderful day

the true is accursed, rotting in shallow grave
slow disappearing, quietly, but forever
the lie with new face walking around the world
enjoying all wealth of rotting true

the true is dying
the lie is expanding

glory of   true long time ago fell down
success of the lie celebrated on all battlefronts
pretending true, the lie giving requital
wishing to believers a wonderful day
