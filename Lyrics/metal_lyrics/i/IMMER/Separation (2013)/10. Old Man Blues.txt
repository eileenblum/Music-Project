deep wrinkles and shallow breathing
sad pale face and shaking hands
century old man, chronicle alive
clamped lips ... singing anyway

old manÂ´s blues

experienced everything, saw such as things
war and peace, rationed food
illness and suffering, pain and fear
joy and letdown, victory and failure

old manÂ´s blues

old man guesses heÂ´s passed all
nothing can surprise this old dog
he would rather close the case
unable ones leading instead of capable

left to wait for his expired date
cannot get it cannot understand
beg  for candle to burn out
clamped lips ... calm voice goes out

old manÂ´s blues

"I am old man, iÂ´d like to go now,
nothing keeps me here, i donât wanna live anymore "
