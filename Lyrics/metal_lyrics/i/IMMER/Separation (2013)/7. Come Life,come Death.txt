sunset above tortured earth
fire illuminates scarring faces 
coldÂ´s sneaking into dark eyes
weapons are ready on the floor

maybe, the last time he can make love with wife
for a moment not thinking about another day
after that mortal combat
be ready to die for his land 

tomorrow will decide
resolve will decide
courage to die will decide
bravery and the best ones will decide
belief will decide

sunsetÂ´s opening scene above battlefield
blood of fallen disappearing in trampled grass
the rest of survivors â the last conflict
towards certain death, towards eternal glory
