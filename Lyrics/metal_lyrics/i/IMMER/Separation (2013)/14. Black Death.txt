shadow of death hovers over cities 
odor of blood and rot dominates
survivors fighting with hungriness
robbing graves for rotten morsels

darkness, pain and torture is coming

people infected by fatal virus 
by plaque of envy, pride and evil
all went quiet â prayers, scream, excuses 
the virus is mortal with no exceptions

darkness, pain and torture is coming

people remains cover whole land 
scavengers enjoying the feast
from afar sharp-eyed vultures
tautly watching the last hour of people

black death
