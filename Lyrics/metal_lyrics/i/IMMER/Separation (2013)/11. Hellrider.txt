you cannot see him, but he is here,
you can run, but cannot escape,
he is your conscience, constant shadow,
what you know, so he knows

hell rider, godÂ´s butcher
hell rider, devil's disciple

penetrating eyes watching your soul
nothing scares his resolve off 
hides of your soul and dark secrets
will appear like dead fish 

hell rider, godÂ´s butcher
hell rider, devil's disciple

hellÂ´s envoy is taking your soul away on machine of death

you cannot see him, but he is here,
you can run, but cannot escape,
he is your conscience, constant shadow,
what you know, so he knows
