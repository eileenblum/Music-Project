the god of dream came to my head
he asked whether the honor still alive
didnÂ´t know what to tell him
the honorÂ´s  mortally fallen down

despair, hopelessness, the last inhalation
rebound, jump, the last mission

he recognize, i hesitate to say
so he read the answer in my head
he turned pale, sad, got more wrinkles
then he took a breathe and gave me question

despair, hopelessness, the last inhalation
rebound, jump, the last mission

question was very simple
to choose between dead honor
or troublesome guest
betrayal, lie, cheat, false

i donât know what to say or think
the honor is already dead, storeÂ´s closed
read book, empty house
fire gone out, extinct become

despair, hopelessness, the last inhalation
rebound, jump, the last mission

morfeus can see that betrayal is winning
and the honor is torn, torn by vultures
heÂ´ll put dream about alive honor to the my  head 
heÂ´ll get rid of unwelcomes in our heads
