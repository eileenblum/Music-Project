right now â the pain
right now â the death

they called him a homeless, spat in front of him
their noses bended of disgust, faces averted
they looked down on him, considering them a better race
wearing halo above their better head

with no mercy they expelled him from the city
they did not want to let him a little breathe
drinking coffee in the warmth behind of the window
happily slapping each other on their backs

their hands were soft of counting money
never had to ask anyone for anything
they tried to at least sit on two chairs
thought hardly how to not get sweaty

but they did not expect what all can happen
that they can also end under the bridge in the mud
during the day, flies can take a shit on them too
at nights they might pee in their pants of fear

the water boils for every swine

right now â the pain
right now â the death

homeless hidden in the nearest grave
he buried himself extra more
he did not want to live in this terror
he knew that even dog is not his friend

while lying and waiting in the grave
smile appeared on his torn face
do as you want, nothing isnÂ´t forever
the water boils for every swine

the water boils for every swine
