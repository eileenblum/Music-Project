The iron lattice diluting your view
The narrow cell obstructing motion
The train mouse siting by legs
The all is over no hope

The Dark Soul

The long never ending years
You had time think about your actions
And why you got to this sewage
And too about your sacrifices

The dark soul

The fear eating you alive
The devil enjoy victory

Only a few of days be left to last road
The waiting you only green mile
The last dinner, maybe blessing
And a few poison to your blood

The dark soul

The fear eating you alive
The devil enjoy victory

The poison reaching slowly to body
You pain your debts dislike now
The life evaporating to somewhere in a moment
And you experiencing pain your sacrifices in the hell

The dark soul
