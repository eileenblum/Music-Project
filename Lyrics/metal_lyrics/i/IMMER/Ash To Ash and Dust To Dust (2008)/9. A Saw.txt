Heavy cancer eats your body, your prayers and demands arenÂ´t heard
Hate sneakes into your mind, resistance for all helthy ones â without any humility
All of them who donÂ´t regard life, these who donÂ´t know how valuable the life is
They undergo the cruel fight, for their existence, the war for their naked life

Humility or fight, purification or death

The death game starts, rules are sharp as a saw
Only the winner can survive, upsets can hear only âThe game endsâ

Humility or fight, death or salvation

Everybody plays his game, measured to this nature
Upget it is the sure death, to win itÂ´s uncertain future
Demands and crying canÂ´t help, only the cool step and logic
Or to sacrifice something, or to die

Humility or fight, future or fall into oblivion

The time flies unstoppable, the clock ticks in the death rythm
The toothed edge touches the body, the game ends!
