ItÂ´s midnight and sleep dosenÂ´t come
Light of the month, sÂ´get in your in sight
Ideas wandering round poor mind
It makes you get up, it makes you live second life

Hot blood, sweet blood
Fire in heart, frost in eyes

My other self cry and wants to get out
Importunate voice rumbles in your head
You own to drink you thrilly want
Nothing gonna stop you

In morning, hen you wake up, you feel well
You donÂ´t remember Terst of the night
Then your see your hands
A blood behind your nails it changes all

Hot blood, sweet blood
Fire in heart, frost in eyes

On the other day,
You settle with a person
Who grows up in yourself,
And whoÂ´ll swallow you uo at the end

The midnightÂ´s hunt, your sole passion
Massacred bodies, your art
Fire in eyes, frost in a heart
Crazy brain, growing frant!!
