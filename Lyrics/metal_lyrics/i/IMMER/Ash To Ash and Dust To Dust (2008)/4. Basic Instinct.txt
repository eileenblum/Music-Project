The yellow and painful tooth,
Newspapers instead of quilt
Two yellow fingers and smelly breathe,
Glassy eyes and nothingness
Every morning it's same start,
The main is drinking to drug a mind
Find same place to stay for day,
Find same place to stay for day

Life without any future
Walking without any destination
Anything is just
The basic instinct- to stay alive

Healthy, white and complete teeth,
Two living rooms for guests home
In healthy body, healthy ghost is,
Every morning condition race
To have a dinner in a posh bar at midday,
And golf in own club then
You jump in bar for drink by night,
You just canÂ´t wait for next day then

Life for money
Clear future
Everything is just
Basic instinct â to have more

Two other lives,
The first is hell, the second paradise
Deep and impassable abyss,
That separates them
They â belonging to paradise,
They multiply money every day
People belonging to hell,
They pray about death every day
