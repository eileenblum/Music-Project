Hey you,stand look at you
Turn much more your head,itÂ´s bout you
You left poverty chaos dirt behind you
you donÂ´t want to feel any guilt

The intoxic
power in yours

To have a more, no gifts, just want more
Stink of money, lust of power, itÂ´s sangreal

The intoxic
power in yours

Though everything end once
Highs become lows
ya wouldnÂ´t have so big eyes
couldnÂ´t play so high

Hey you, stand look at you
look properly, itÂ´s bout you
that loud voice of your mind says stand to you
Though you canÂ´t hear it, you will play anyway

The intoxic
power in yours
