Devil has site not far from here
Holy war is hangs in the air
Glory and honour is die for allah
Pagans and incredulous send to hell

Thosand cultures â thousand gods
Not at last wars, struggles and battles
Battlefield are filled with dead bodies
Everythink is other â you know it

You fraing in the hell

Devil is smilling, what do well him
The best with god is excellent
Race of people is destroying alone
Suicide is in human nature

You Fraing in the hell
The god is dead

Brooks of blood running from cross
Lives go out as candles in the winds
Bodies are breaking in blind of faith
And devil whisper with smile

The god is dead
