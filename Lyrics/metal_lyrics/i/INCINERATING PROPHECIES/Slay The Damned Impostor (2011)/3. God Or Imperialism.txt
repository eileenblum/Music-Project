Land domain is what its mandate is looking for
To impose their regulation and to get the slavery of ignorant mortal beings
Making use of hypocrisy, taking away the autonomy and imposing in their lives just to live in their hierarchy

Camouflaged among fake gods, fill you up with repressions
With verses and psalms sinking you with their mandate
And leaving them to be submissive in fatalist cold doctrinesâ¦that have been created!

As a sign of humiliation they demand forgiveness because of the invented sins
And they put you on your knees just to prove your submission laughing at your agony
They will steal your life and wonât even give you a handâ¦God or imperialism
