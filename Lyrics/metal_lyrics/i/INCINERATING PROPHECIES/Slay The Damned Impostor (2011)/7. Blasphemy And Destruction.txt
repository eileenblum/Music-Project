Plenty of deaths, caused in his name, each one in vain
Barbarian wars, manipulated by false erudite

The crusades were faÃ§ade from the beings that long supremacy

Tackled million massacres annihilating supposing infidels
Threatens of cataclysm against the support of heresy

Horror god, causing deaths
Horror godâ¦ Blasphemy!
Horror god, causing deaths
Horror godâ¦ Destruction!

Using living flesh, to consummate their greed
Tortured none believers for not taking orders of an unreal god
Murdered massacred for not following the path that leads to an abysm
