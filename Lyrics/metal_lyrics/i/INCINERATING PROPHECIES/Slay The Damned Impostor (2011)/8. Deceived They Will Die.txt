The love that you know, later blasting hatred will be
The fantasy that has been created, just in words will be remained
They will just regret when they realize, thereâs no god, just pure lies
Thereâs no temple in which torment is absent

Praying will not be good, as much as you beg, he will not come
Salvation will lie within your hands

Having been submitted to divine slavery, absorbing the souls, annihilating lives
Kneeling over the altar, begging for holy mercy, deceived they will die!

Relying in the name of savior, they just mock within your face
They have them chained, using them without compassion
They have you enslaved, with a bandage over your eyes
Submitted to a mandate in which you are and will be held
