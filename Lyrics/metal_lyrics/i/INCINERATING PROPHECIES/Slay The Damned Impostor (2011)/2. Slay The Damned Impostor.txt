Hatred for the people that hurt and just forgiveness is what they seek across hypocrite and blind prayers
The game of damage and be withdraw absolved
This game will be over when your conscience
Ends up while it collapses

Through simple hypocrite prayers
Thinking just in a far beyond
Of the present willing to escape
Dreaming of a sky and joy

Dominating your mind with fake promises of immortality, dominating your lifeâ¦
Dominating your soul, kneeling on the ground begging compassion
Dominating the masses, through the human will
