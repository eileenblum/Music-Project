Marks of a punishment built by words into a book of lies
Future of a destination suffering by visions into a corrupted mind

Promises are written now, lies of a false Christ, confusing a thousand lives
Business of buying souls, to an eternal life beyond
Selling the eternal peace, with false words of immortality

Acts of a putrid humanity under the name of god
Followers of blessed madness, sins are their visions of life

Incinerating the world of divine
Prophecies of a million crimes

Inhuman doctrine
False rituals
