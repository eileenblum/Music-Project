Sacred rituals granting their lives to a false redeemer
There is no Messiah neither empire, not god nor its reign
Demanding submission as a reward for being your god

Believing words of another mortal that looks after living in your ignorance
Proclaiming thousand words that they wonât even follow
Searching that they follow your damned will
Fake ritual that extracts people and puts them under your convenience

There rituals where slaves give homage to illusions in their minds
Believing in lies, believing in mortals that you view as gods
Believing in promises were eternal life your god will grant, ritual slave!
