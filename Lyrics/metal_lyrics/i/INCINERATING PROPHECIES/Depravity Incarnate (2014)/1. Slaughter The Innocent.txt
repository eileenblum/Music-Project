The innocent were murdered, and so have the naÃ¯ve
Passing on wisdom and grinding on their teeth
Murdering the unborn is what my mind debates
Start the killing, acting out of hate

Making Christmas ornaments out of babies heads
Chewing dead nuns pussy instead of holy bread
Skullfucking people is what I do best,
Lubricate in blood, bathing on their snot,

Ripping with my cock

Ripping with my cock, and Cumming on their thoughts

Slit their throat and pull their tongue out mocking through the wound
Lusting retribution

Wearing women flesh, gagging on their breast
Fucking peopleâs heads, stab them through the chest
My name is destiny, my name is god

Slaughter the innocent, dismembering all the rest
Nailed children on the ceiling, deformed like all the rest
For thatâs what they deserve.
