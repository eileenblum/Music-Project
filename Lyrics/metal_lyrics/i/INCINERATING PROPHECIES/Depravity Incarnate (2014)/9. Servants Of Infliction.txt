Destruction from our beginnings
Bastard lies suffocating this world
Consuming its patience
Human breed vaccinated against itself
Generations transferring legacy to havoc
Deteriorating flesh, devouring and draining
All the human filth!

Plant the seed and let it grow
I just want to sit and watch
How your frail empire is consumed

Violence, misery, oppression and religion
The weak is always naive and submissive
Anger, pain, frustration
Against human stupidity

Empty minds
Evolve to involution
Humanity being consumed by nothing

Following a nonsense path
Like a blind and silly lamb
As its sick command
History repeats and evolves

Planted seed has grown
I will just sit and watch
How your frail empire is consumed

Every age is crueler and deadlier
Wars for all and nothing
Progress forward to decay
Chaotic existence

Behind the line of horrors
You'll die for your ignorance
There's no complains
Servants of infliction

Planted seed has died
I just sat and watched
How your frail empire was consumed
