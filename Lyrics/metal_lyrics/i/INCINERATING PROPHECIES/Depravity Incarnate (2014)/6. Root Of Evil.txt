Ripping the flesh of the saint and the holy
Cutting their necks with blasphemy and gore
Letting my hands fulfill my desires
Of butchery and murder of immaculate hypocrites
Taking my flesh into madness
Boasting myself to laugh at their pain

Bloodshed will come on earth as itâs in heaven.
Damning spirituality believes

All faith
Nothing is more sacred than tasting the flesh
Swallow the blood as if it was its own
Cracking with hammer the wrists and the bones

Soulless profane, born of the insane, thy kingdom shall fall, and ours shall reign

Murder, massacre, destroy, and abuse
Freedom ainât given, commandments ainât true
Execrate, liberate, or pray to you god

Look up to the cross
Burn your eyes blind
Bleed through your sins
As paper demands
Nothing will save you
Repent to your will

Root of evil
Making brothers kill themselves with lies

Look up to the cross
Burn your eyes blind
Bleed through your sins
As paper demands
Nothing will save you
Repent to your will

Root of evil
Making brothers kill themselves with lies
Root of evil
Living life as if youâll never die
