Covered by celestial mantle as if your frigid flesh
Would incite to perversion
Full of illusions to have an orgasm
Just to repent on your knees.

Bleed holy cunt
Cover your insecurity
On meaningless chastity votes and fantasize
With a divine hand that will descend to rip your pussy in to gore

Your purity and chastity are only an illusion
When your needy clit begins to throb

How immense is your faith while you masturbate your holy flesh!
Your holy flesh! (Depravity Incarnate)

Bragging chastity with thoughts filled of lust, old puppet of priests and popes
Tell me hypocrite nun, how can you live tied to ropes
Tied to hypocrisy, dyed with cum, when thy kingdom cums

Youâll dream of illustrations of cocks youâll never eat.
You are depravity incarnate, mistake of existence.

Let me show you how I touch your fragile will and your pussy begins to squirt
Youâre one more of the unholy bitches of your imaginary bastard Father
