Bastard son of his empty sick father
Existing through voices and unanswered prayers

Forsaking your flock you ignore our existence
With hate and despise thy heaven shall burn

Bottomless pit of disaster and vengeance
Play your role of magnificent being
And rest with your lies

Pray to your god

Forsaking your flock you ignore our existence
With hate and despise thy heaven shall burn

Infected belief leaded through ancients devises
Untainted adepts on your utopian heaven will die

Bottomless pit of disaster and vengeance
Play your role of magnificent being
And rest with your lies

Hatred Believers living in disguise
Taking life for granted as if death shall not rise
