No one to blame
Nothing to hear
The screams from the bleakness
Disappear into fear

Praying to the void
To scape from the place where they want to be
From hell they have created
Will raise the fire to burn them all

Sky is turning black
Is covered by anger
The red swamp of the earth
Is dyed with blood of their tears

Madness and pain, meaning of existence
Filling it with meaningless triumphs
Unreal impediments surround
Forbidding all that will never be

Blinding the blind
Silencing the silence
Emptying the void

Hypocrite smiles of bloody torments
Loudness in silence tearing from inside
Victims from their own prejudices
Hateful acts that satisfies their misery

Foresight the lives in decay
Desperate beings running away
Trying to excel in an apathetical world
Consumed and trapped in themselves
