This is the end
Unforgiven
Your apologies
Don't mean a thing

This is the beginning of the misery
And I hope you never find your peace
Pain will follow you like a trend
I hope it never ends
I hope it never ends!

Mercy will play
No part in this
You will pay
The ultimate price
Die, die

I wish I could close my eyes
And this would all go away
(And this would all go away)
I knew her heart like the back of my hand
Her life was right in the back of your mind
You should learn the hard way that in life
You rolled the dice, it's eye for an eye

I will never forgive
I will never forget you

Burn, you fiend
Burn, you fiend
I will never forgive
I will never forget you
