Every day is a new day
Nothing will be the same for you
Everyday is a new day
Nothing, will be the same for you and me

This will pass
All will fall
You will fall... down

Nothingness surrounds you
Yet this whole world is around you
Break the spell
Overcome the system
Release everything you're holding onto
Every grasp will one day let go

Why do you go and do this to me
You never knew my intentions
Why do you go and do this to me
You never knew my intentions

We're pointed in the wrong direction
Time and space
Time and space
Time and space
Time and space

This is your way
This is your way... out

Pardon me
I'm set free
Show me what it's like to see
