[feat. Aaron Matts]I'll take you there, if you want me to.
Nothing will ever get in our way again
I'm digging so deep
I never said the stars won't align
I only said if you reach, that they'll be there in time
I could never go back to where I was
and be in that barren world again
watch the lights fade, watch the sun rise.
Forget it all, forget it now.
Remember, all the times we spent watching,
the world rotate
seven days, felt like nothing.
I've lost connection, I want it back.
We're living to live!!!
These lights are blinding, but I'll never stop.
I'm looking ahead to better days, when you're here.
And it's all withered away.
The answer comes in time, but I don't have time to give.
I saw the smoke clear.
I watched the world die before my eyes.
All I ever really wanted was to be away from here,
all I ever really wanted was to disconnect, and forget the world with you.
I can't forget
