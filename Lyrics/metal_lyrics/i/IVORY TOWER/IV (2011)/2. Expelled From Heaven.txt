Don't you cry my friend, you cannot hide again
You live to serve my need and will
Take this open door, walk on this famous floor
Where many men have failed before

Expelled from heaven, I'm king of lost souls never rising
Expelled from heaven, I'm king of lost souls never dying

Soon as you're born you're becoming a diamond
And I am waiting to perfect this stone
Rely on proficiency I will make your world
As you want it, all needs reduced to the max

Vanity, wallow in luxury, indifference, my favorite sins
If you choose to be on the loose you'll see
Nothing but the whole of me

[Repeat]

Expelled from heaven, I'm king of lost souls
Expelled from heaven, I'm king

Hey, are you ready for the show
For all the things you gotta know
For a life of rock' n roll
