[Instrumental]I don't want to let you go
Don't want to feel the fear when you're not here
If only I could turn back time
I would have taught you even more

Child don't try to grow so fast
Walk slowly through your life. Evoke the pats
Willful traps are lurking everywhere
Don't blunder into there, be aware

Look at what we've left behind.
And get a sense for turning wrong things right
The burden you take on is your fate
Get rid of the hate that poisons minds

I apologize
