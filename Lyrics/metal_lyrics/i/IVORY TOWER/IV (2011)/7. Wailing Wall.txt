A careful walk on broken crystal alibis, I dodge a rage she scatter round
A face that hides any kind, any sign, any traits of weakness
Words break out from deep within showing me again the reality
Of what we have, where we stand, that we don't comprehend
Together yet alone, a wall inside our home
Together we have built it, filled it, just as we dig deep

To bury unsaid in ourselves a hiding place
To treasure up the hurt, the pain but

Let it out, let it out, free it from the underground
Break her heart, take her heart, think about a brand new start
Deify, deify, a rest of hope I can deny
Look at you, look at me ... Stop, stop

Time is running out, you reach for life without the light of self control
Time is running out, wake up my friend and feel again what's really there

Scars now visible, but who is responsible? Is it invertible?
Can we take back, suffering, pain, the wounds, the hurt?
We fall into the great oblivion, we've unlearned to carry on
We blame it on, the me, the you, the us, the we, the lust
A remaining peace of trust, somewhere in the dust
Unjustly covered by confusion that led us astray

Here at my wailing wall, I hope you hear my call,
Help us to break the surface (Repeat)
Here at my wailing wall, I hope you hear my call, stop the fall
(Let it out, let it out)
(Free it from the underground)
(Think about, think about, stop it, stop it)
