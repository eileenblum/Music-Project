Long ago, you felt so isolated
Question like "where do I belong"
You've tried to take off all idols
Worse than bad, alas
There's a lack self-confidence
In the air, about to suffocate
If self-esteem would stink
You were a perfect fragrance

You've got to make it, you've got to change it
You've got to learn it.. You've got to

Raise hands to the sky see the bad times passing by
Raise hands to the sky, escape your shadow
Raise hands to the sky, make up your mind leave it all behind
Raise hands to the sky, escape your shadow

Here you are in life of mysteries
Stranding on the gates yo yourself
Sympathy you're longing for
Means dare to face the real you

Will you go and fight the watchmen of your mind
Would you do anything to fight what makes you blind

[Repeat]
