Hello, hello, is there anybody out there? Hear my call
Hello, you look at me and catch nothing at all
Hello, it hurts but I've got nothing to return
Hello, I sense everything but you don't seem to

I'm just longing for the dark, I need a way to disembark
From this ship of endless nightmares

I'm dead yet awake, I'm a catatonic schizophrenic
This is worse than death, I'm a catatonic schizophrenic
Soothe your will to live, I'm a catatonic schizophrenic
Turn of the instruments, end my catatonic sleep

Hello, hello, attacks of madness constantly increase 
Hello, you try to hide your pity but I see
Hello, see my eyes, they show you how I feel
Hello, I feel everything but no-one seems to

[Repeat]
