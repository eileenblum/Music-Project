Shades of butterflies
A touch of unsettled lies
Invincible mountains left behind

What else can we do?
How can we resume
Luck in which we almost drowned?

Could we start again?
Really start again?

I would be there, yes I really would
Turn back there for good
Come let us try to find again
What we've lost so far

A dash of jealousy
Too much love for free
Ready was the dish of rage

Truth and honesty
Should be certainty
But we really trampled on

[Repeat]
