Thunder from afar. Above a glaring star
The wings spring up from out of nowhere
Calm before the storm. Seasons acting as they want
Nobody knows nothingness is marching on
The sky has turned to grey. The sun has gone another way
Seems like something wicked's coming up today
Blocked and blinded minds have never seen the signs
The ends been drawing near this time
&gt;From the past to the question what will be
Has never been an open mind to see
The last way out from our destiny

After all the hurt silence of the world's
Waking up the universe
Natural purge
Back to a new beginning

Mankind's on the edge of existence
I'm watching from a distance
Where many people've gone before
Walls are tumbling down
Mankind's on the run
A higher force has taken over
And nothingness is marching on

After all the hurt silence of the world's
Waking up the universe
Natural purge
Back to a new beginning

Timeless we thought our life would be
Will only be a memory
Bow to the inevitable
The human race has to pay its price
Sorrow and pain could never repair
The damage to the world around us
Sair pollution, exploitation and the will for alteration
Step by step into nothingness
And nothingness is marching on

After all the hurt silence of the world's
Waking up the universe
Natural purge
Back to a new beginning
