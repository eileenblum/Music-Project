I leave the ashes of my brutal
Past won't fulfill my future life
Deep inside I need to run away from
Lying, hiding, betraying
Crying, denying, pretending
Life goes on straight to the edge
Hopeless wishes wander through the night
I seem to know the reason that really shows
The valley of my shabby soul

Baring the secret everyone's turning away
Life and its meaning have led me astray

I flow with the sands of time
I know that the memories remain
I hold back the beast in me
I know I better had
Keep the secret in me

Lying, hiding, betraying
Crying, denying, pretending
Baring the secret everyone's turning away
Life and its meaning have led me astray

I flow with the sands of time
I know that the memories remain
I hold back the beast in me
I know I better had
Keep the secret in me

I flow with the sands of time
I know that the memories remain
I know I better had
Keep the secret in me
