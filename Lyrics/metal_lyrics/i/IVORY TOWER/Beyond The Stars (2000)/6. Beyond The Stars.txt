Everything around me seems unreal
It's not the way I used to feel
I try to stop the pounding of my heart
Any kind of pains get nip in the bud

Familiar places passing by
I seem to fly
All the memories of the past
Don't mean a thing

Where am I now
Where will I go

Timeless, painless
There is magic in my mind
As I fly beyond the stars
Will I die, will I live again
When I fly beyond the stars

Honesty, security
Are guiding me
Familiar faces satisfy
My question way

Where am I now
Where will I go

Timeless, painless
There is magic in my mind
As I fly beyond the stars
Will I die, will I live again
When I fly beyond the stars
