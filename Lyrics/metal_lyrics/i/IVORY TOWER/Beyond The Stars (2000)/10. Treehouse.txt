Mother hold me. I think I need to cry
Father help me. I have to get things right
Sorry son, sorry honey. Ain't got time to worry
Was afraid of these answers. I fell into a stare
Today I'm standing at the house where I grew up
Mother's dead. Father too
The fear is still here
And I look up the tree in front of me
Watching the treehouse father built for me
I'm climbing in
The fear just flies away
All my senses obey
Lovely creatures guide my way
They teach me how to cry
How to get all things right
How you learn to love the night

I wonder how it comes. Is this my second chance
Tell me am I dreaming or lost inside time
I pass the parts of life. It really cuts me like knife
I see my life in ruins. The world around me turms
Surrounded by angels I reach a special point
Above me my parents I look at with delight
Suddenly I see so clear
Hate just turns to understanding
Sweat on my skin as I awake from my dream
Throught the dust I see the treehouse
And memories are coming back again

Now I stand here at their grave. I'm crying
I've learned to forgive and to love
I'm watching sunset's beautiful horizon
The evil's lost the good has won tonight
Seasons change and tides have turned
No one can deny his own changes
When I'm down I know a place
To wash away the sins I've perpetrated

I've learned to forgive and to love
