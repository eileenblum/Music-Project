Did the teacher tell you what is right
Have you followed rules guided by the voice of mind
Did you learn your lesson well my friend
Are you prepared for life or just about to end
Have you ever left your own dignity
Have you ever seen the way it could be
Are you afraid of what the future brings
Do you hear it first when the alarm bell rings
You are not alone
I was onle like you
Just about to tail
Stand up my friend and face your life
The way it's gonna be

Try to fly my friend
Don't hide behind your tears
Try to fly my friend
Find out your tears

And when the morning appears
And you've shed the night with tears
When nightfall's not expected
You loose yourself
You doubt yourself
You think it's over
But the story will go on
Have you ever felt your own dignity
Have you ever seen the way it could be
Are you afraid of what the future brings
Do you hear it first when the alarm bell rings
