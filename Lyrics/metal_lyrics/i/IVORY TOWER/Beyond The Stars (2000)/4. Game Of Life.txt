She drifts away in sorrow
Her mind will leave her soon
Its hard to face tomorrow
All that could remain is pain but

Fate will light a candle for the one
Who stands the game of life
Under this blazing sun

She wraps herself in silence
Words just can't get through
I'd like to free her mind from
Things she thought he would not do

Fate will light a candle for the one
Who stands the game of life
Under this blazing sun

They say that time's healer
Wounds will fade away
But will time relieve her
Of never wanted memories

Fate will light a candle for the one
Who stands the game of life
Under this blazing sun
