I'm on my own
No time and space perceptible
Just deaf and blind
That's the way I'm feeling
My courage gives up
The drive has lost it's reason
But the moment is near
And light is gone
Just for a short time
Life's got a new meaning

Sorry for watching you
But I adore you
Moments that let me now
That I'm alive

My mind is playing tricks on me
Imaginations of things that won't become reality
My dream keeps smiling and pain is hiding
Capture this moment for all eternity
Close your window cause it's getting dark
Bag rogues are crawling out of the park
Be not afraid 'cause it's only me
A little smile is all a poor boy needs
And life's got a new meaning

Sorry for watching you
But I adore you
Moments that let me now
That I'm alive

For just a second you're mind
My world of yearning
Close your windows cause it's getting dark
Bag rogues are crawling out of the park
Be not afraid 'cause it's only me
A little smile is all a poor boy needs
And life's got a new meaning

Sorry for watching you
But I adore you
Moments that let me now
I'm alive
