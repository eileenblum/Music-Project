My whole life I've been waiting
For someone like you
The one and only
But there are times I wonder
Who you really are
If you were alone
It's in your eyes and in your smile
It's in the way that you deny

Don't leave me, releave me
Don't run away and hold me
When thoughts are running wild
I hear you, I feel you
I truly adore you
I'm watching every move you make
I want you here by me
I need to feel your warmth
Tenderness and poetry
But there is still that odd feeling
It's in you eyes and in your smile
It's in the way that you deny

Don't leave me, releave me
Don't run away and hold me
When thoughts are running wild

Don't leave me, believe me
Don't run away and hold me
When thoughts are running wild
