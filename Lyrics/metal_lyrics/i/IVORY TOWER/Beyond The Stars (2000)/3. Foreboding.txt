You wonder if you like the way
He's playing with your feelings
You know that it is not the way
You actually wanted
There's something in your mind
That keeps you safe and warm
The mystery of foreboding
Something's going on
The tide has turned
You trust your inner voice that's saying

Hold on to your dreams
Whan all your feelings are
Raging like thunder

You wonder if she's really
What she pretends to be
Memories of broken love
Hope of eternity
Enchanted by the moment
The new
But something's going on
The tide has turned
You trust your inner voice that's saying

Hold on to your dreams
Whan all your feelings are
Raging like thunder

Out in your world and your universe
Try to find out what remains at last
Buils up a wall just to let them know
You can see through their brilliant show
Run away from nightmares

Hold on to your dreams
Whan all your feelings are
Raging like thunder
