Wandering in thoughts
I remember her calls
Her voice and whisper
Silhouettes of my past
Increase all my sorrow
Who am I now
She leaves a memory
Embodiment of harmony
Beauty of a woman
I felt eternal life
But now just realize
Dreams are broken down

I won't forget her words
Whatever happens to our life
No one will surrender
And if I fall
Keep me from going under

I know we'll meet again
I'm on my long way to you

Time will pass my way
And I will follow
On broken wings of dreams
Only for you

Her voice echoes in the hall
I try so hard to recall
But the echo fades away

It takes only a lifetime
I must wait
Where am I now

I won't forget her words
Whatever happens to our life
No one will surrender
And if I fall
Keep me from going under

I know we'll meet again
I'm on my long way to you
