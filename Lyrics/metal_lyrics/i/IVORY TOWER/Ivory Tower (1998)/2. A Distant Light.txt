I don't know why I have to look at the sky
Always strive to reach that high

I don't know why everybody tries to fly
Do we need to be so high

From all directions the warnings are drawning near
Close to the bring of ruin

It's getting dark and lost souls
Don't know where they belong
Or where they are
Or where they're from

But somewhere there's a distant light
It's warm and nothing shines so bright
The moment is now to realize
No hope anymore when the light burns out

The spring of fame everyone is searching for
Is just a legend of a dreamer

The sense of life
A mystery like stars above
Borderland of mankind's mind

From all directions the warnings are drawning near
Close to the bring of ruin

It's getting dark and lost souls
Don't know where they belong
Or where they are
Or where they're from

The signs are here
The meaning is clear
We do wrong
We do right

A constant inner fight
Look somewhere beyond, look somewhere within
