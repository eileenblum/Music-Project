It follows me
Tries to divert me
It's going to break into my mind

Dark forces calling from above
From another side of life
Parasites gnaw at me
But I will always be

Alive
Always be alive

I see people walking
In shadows of themselves
Won't find their way home
And I hear them talking
But they don't understand at all
It's not their mind that talks

Dark forces calling from above
From another side of life
Parasites gnaw at me
But I will always be

Alive
Always be alive

I'm watching TV
"Don't do this, don't do that"
I switch off before I get mad
I'm reading the news
"Don't do this, don't do that"
I throw it away
And hope good mood returns

Dark forces calling from above
From another side of life
Parasites gnaw at me
But I will always be

Alive
