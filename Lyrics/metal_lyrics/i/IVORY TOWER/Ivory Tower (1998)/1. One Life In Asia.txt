People in the downtown streets
Selling food and unusual things
Drinking water eater rice
A young boy sitting with his mother
Silently endures the day
Bothers making it alright

But look in his eyes
All the hidden cries
He doesn't know the reason why

One life in Asia
Every day short on food
Right after birth reaching childhoods end
One life in Asia

Social disease, endless screams
Lost in decadence
Hunger and pain is all they gain
Filled up with fright and out of might
Never seen the light
Dependent on help

One life in Asia
Every day short on food
Right after birth reaching childhoods end
One life in Asia

Are we worthly?
Full of blindness?
A child around the corner is crying
Slowly dying, crying, slowly dying

An old man in the house of mud
Smoking an cigarett
A remaining piece of luck
A young girl searching for safety
Hope she'll realize
She's selling her heart

But look in his eyes
All the hidden cries
He doesn't know the reason why
