She stops her movements
And whispers to the trees
Secrets of her life
And how it's meant to be
Clouds look like mountains
She wants to walk on
No wall could be high enough
Would always be transcended

Dreams are lost in eternity
Sense is getting mad
Nothing to regret

That is the way she falls in love
She could never be alone
The way she moves
The way she smiles
She could embrace the world
And sprinh grows
Out of winter it flows
Right into her veins
Covers all her pains

Dreams are lost in eternity
Sense is getting mad
And there's nothing to regret

That is the way she falls in love
She could never be alone
The way she moves
The way she smiles
She could embrace the world
