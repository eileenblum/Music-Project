Envy, greed and hate
Have left scars on me
Scars as deep as canyons
Now I stand here
Face to face with my fate

I absorbed the world around me
Compassion I've never known
I have paid the price
And I've lost my mind
Nowhere to go

It all comes back into my mind
The power and respect
So close at hand
I feel they're watching me
Both of them belonged to me
I was blinded
Like roses need the rain
Possessed me. Led enchanted me
I was blinded
So tasteful, so sweet
I gave myself up to a force
Tormented by remorse

On the run from shadows of the past
I regret all of what I said
I think I'm changing

The way I feel the way I think
No time to waste
It's time to part with the evil
If I had the chance to turn back
I would put right all I can
Learn to follow principles of life
Love is part os this advice
Oh, I try

If I had the chance to turn back
I would put right all I can
Learn to follow principles of life
Love is part os this advice
It's time to regret, it's time to respect
It's time to feel sympathy
With those who are victimized

Yes, I was blinded
