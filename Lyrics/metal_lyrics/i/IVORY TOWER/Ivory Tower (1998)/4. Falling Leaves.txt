Armies of butterflies
Whirling around my head
Senses I relied on just don't obey
It looks like paradise is near
Enjoy the moment and it will be here

Once I felt like this

I never thought that it could happen
That minds and thoughts would change this way
I tried so hard to cement our love

But how can we keep it together
When it lays in ruins at our feet

(Can't you see)
The leaves are fallin' down
Autumn's arrived
And it won't go away
It won't go away

How can we keep it together
When it lays in ruins at our feet

(Can't you see)
The leaves are fallin' down
Autumn's arrived
The leaves are fallin' down
Autumn's arrived
The leaves are fallin' down
Autumn's arrived
