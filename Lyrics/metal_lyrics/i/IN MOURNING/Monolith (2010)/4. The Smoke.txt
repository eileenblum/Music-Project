In the alley at night time, when the mist covers the ground
The restless on their promenades are staring at your misery
The smile of the beggar, as you try to hide from his greasy eyes
The nights are long when you are scared and alone

So you take one more deep breath to numb the pain
Why should you care when you are lost out in the rain

The girl in the mirror is bleeding, you have to live with her scars
The smoke is in your eyes, it hides the obvious for a while

So you take one more deep breath to numb the pain
Why should you care when you are lost out in the rain
So you do it once again to ease your sorrow
Why should you bother, the pain will not be gone tomorrow

When you are lost in your own escape
You wish upon another star and the tears starts falling
So you do it once again to ease your sorrow
Why do you bother, the pain will not be gone tomorrow

So comes another dawn with no hope in sight
It is much clearer now in the light
You stumble and fall back to the ground
One last breath in before you go back home
This is not a new day
This day it will be the same way

So you take one more deep breath to numb the pain
Why should you care when you are lost out in the rain
So you do it once again to ease your sorrow
Why should you bother, the pain will not be gone tomorrow

So comes another dawn with no hope in sight
It is much clearer now in the light
You stumble and fall back to the ground
One last breath in before you go back home
This is not a new day
This day it will be the same way
