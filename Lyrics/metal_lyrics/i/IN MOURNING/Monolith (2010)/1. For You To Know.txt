The pen scratches vellum paper and the words flow
Ink stained fingers dreaming up this letter to you
Your love lingers in the shades of a grey morning
Sentence escapes in the mist

The pictures of home swallowed by a narrow margin
Delusions creeping upon me, I'm shaded

The subtlety of time makes everything clearer
Clawing to my chains, squirming with my agony
Scared of never seeing you again
But I never knew you anyway
It could have been so different
It just never happened that way

Have I told you about the magpie, my only friend
Have you heard about the tears and the nights in the rain
And I want you to know, I want you by my side
I could have helped you find a way back into this world

If I ever face this world, we'll be together
This is for you to know. This is for you to feel.

The subtlety of time makes everything clearer
Clawing to my chains, squirming with my agony
Scared of never seeing you again
But I never knew you anyway
It could have been so different
It just never happened that way

The sun is setting, leaving me no sanctuary
And I can't stand another night like this
Tomorrow I will follow my friend among the trees
My final letter, I will write it down for you

Keep it with your poems because they were all true
Just so you know, you didn't get here in time

Have I told you about the magpie, my only friend
Have you heard about the tears and the nights in the rain
And I want you to know, I want you by my side
I could have helped you find a way back into this world

If I ever face this world, we'll be together
This is for you to know. This is for you to feel.
