In the outskirts of a real world, there was once a dream
Camouflaged by daylight, creating it's own mirage
Misdirected lover killed the mannequin
Did a shadow land hide the secrets for us all
On the other side of society, the promised morning never came
In the outskirts of the real world, dream got lost

It was the end of another life but just another day in this world
One more light faded away into the night
One more step back for the forgotten once
The cry of thousand rivers will not bring life back
Poor Julia she was not strong enough to stay
Crawling into the shadows to get some ease

Blind eyes surrounded
No one saw a single thing
Where were you, poet
Where were the ones who should have loved
Deaf ears surrounded
Nobody heard a single sound
Where were you, mother
Where were you all that knew the truth

Betrayal was all around her
No one seemed to be aware
Where were you, lover
Where were the ones who should have deeply cared

Pain and fear surrounded
So alone and always scared
Where were you, father
Where were you all that could have made it end

The October sky cried for her
No more keeper of the inside
In the water she felt no pain
Was the trail to the black lodge irrelevant

Blind eyes surrounded
No one saw a single thing
Where were you, poet
Where were the ones who should have loved
Deaf ears surrounded
Nobody heard a single sound
Where were you, mother
Where were you all that knew the truth

No more keeper of the inside
In the water she felt no pain
Was the trail to the lodge irrelevant
Sinking deeper, deeper down closer to the end
This was the final solution

No one wanted to know how far she had gone
The magpie came and brought the silence
Entering the black lodge, she lost the fight
The pain that once were hidden will now spread into light

Blind eyes surrounded
No one saw a single thing
Where were you, poet
Where were the ones who should have loved
Deaf ears surrounded
Nobody heard a single sound
Where were you, mother
Where were you all that knew the truth
