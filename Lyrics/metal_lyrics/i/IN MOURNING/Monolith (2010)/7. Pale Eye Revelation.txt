Outside the walls years ago, long before the loss
It rained that day when I first laid my eyes upon hatred
Just by the look in his eyes I saw the prophecy
I knew that he knew that we all could see
But I was the lunatic in the eyes of the world
No one listened to the weak mans poetry
Through the window I gaze and I meet the eyes of my queen
A glimpse of beauty to feed my broken heart

I faded to the ground like so many times before
The way that he looked at her told me everything
But I'm just a weird old man, what could I have done
So I retreated into my own insanity

Cold shivers from the sight of his eyes
This was the night when it all went down the line
Cold sweat from the cruel thoughts of you and him
I lost my breath and it all went down the line
Darkness swept in and held me to the fucking ground
I am so sorry that I was weak and let you down on this day of betrayal

Daddy's little girl in the hands of a beast of man
I had a feeling that something was wrong so long before
I never meant to do you wrong
I never meant for hope to be gone

I faded to the ground like so many times before
The way that he looked at her told me everything
But I'm just a weird old man, what could I have done
So I retreated into my own insanity

Cold shivers from the sight of his eyes
This was the night when it all went down the line
Cold sweat from the cruel thoughts of you and him
I lost my breath and it all went down the line
Darkness swept in and held me to the fucking ground
I am so sorry that I was weak and let you down on this day of betrayal
