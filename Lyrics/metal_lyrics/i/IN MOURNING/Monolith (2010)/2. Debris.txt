Darkness sets outside, a shadow dances frightened on the bedroom wall
It's quiet outside, soon the time is right
Carefully out of bed, slips into a skintight silky dress
Red lips kiss in the mirror, harbouring the sadness in her eyes
One sip from the bottle hidden behind the books in the shelf

Pushing down the handle, the door slides open wide
Cautiously moving down the hallway, don't make any sound
Finally out in the night, the air is warm and clear
A slight breath sweeps through the treetops in a moonlight serenade

No look back, no chance to turn away this time
She lights a cigarette and walks away from home

Rushing through the emptiness of a sleeping town
A few dreamless strolling in the dancing streetlights
Butterflies swarming the inside with shivers divine
Almost there, she stops to catch her breath
She straightens the dress one hand through the hair
Her eyes detecting their under bridge rendezvous

Minutes pass by, she's alone
He is nowhere in sight, loneliness lingering back
Hours goes by and love once more lost
In this corner of the world cold and empty

On one of the loneliest nights he came from out of a dream
Embraced and in a moment all pain went away
A dreamtime tied to a faded reality and for a while it all just seemed to flow

Rushing through the emptiness of a sleeping town
A few dreamless strolling in the dancing streetlights
Butterflies swarming the inside with shivers divine
Almost there, she stops to catch her breath
She straightens the dress one hand through the hair
Her eyes detecting their under bridge rendezvous
