Two lovers, we met with the poetry in France
We painted our life on broken glass
Lost in the moment it felt right this time

Beyond the embers of life glowing all around us
It was always there waiting to take me away
Dark and unwelcoming

Out of the blindness my hands freaked again, it's getting harder
Tongue tied and strung out we learned how to pray
Into shapes, safe in my permanent gaze
I can't really speak to you anymore
Her presence melts away the past

Drifting apart like leaves on a stormy sea
Why didn't I get the chance to try
There came the end of all beauty in life
She was meant to be our shelter from the madness
I thought she would make a difference
But Julia, she made it even worse
I thought she would make a difference
She made it even worse

I never saw the end until it came like the coldest wind
It cracked the sky open and I was left out in isolation

Out of the blindness my hands freaked again, it's getting harder
Tongue tied and strung out we learned how to pray
Into shapes, safe in my permanent gaze
I can't really speak to you anymore
Her presence melts away the past

Drifting apart like leaves on a stormy sea
Why didn't I get the chance to try
I was the dark star on our glimmering sky
The failing father I'd never become
