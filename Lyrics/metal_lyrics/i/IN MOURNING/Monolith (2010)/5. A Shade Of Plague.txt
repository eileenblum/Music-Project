Red eyes from tears and all the sleepless nights
Touched skin can never be washed clean again
You are burned by the fire of his flame
Trapped in the filth and all the fucking shame

Pushed down by disgust and desire
Numbing the wounds with other wounds
Here I am, you cannot see me
But look me in the eyes when you cry
I don't mind if you hide yourself, I will find
Don't you make me angry this time
You will never disappoint me again
Bite the pillow and make no sound

So Julia, darkness falls again
You leave the light on by the window
Praying to the moon and the stars
That tonight you'll be left alone

Forced into darkness by the fear of failing
Held down into loneliness
So beautiful but filled up with the tears and pain
In constant hiding from his hungry eyes
What is the price of lust, love and lies
No one will find you hiding in your shadow land

Wipe away all the tears from your eyes, can't you see
Pull the sheets above your heads, try to fall asleep
But scared to wake up by the sound of not being
But scared to wake up by the sound
Of not being on your own, all alone

Forced into darkness by the fear of failing
Held down into loneliness
So beautiful but filled up with the tears and pain
In constant hiding from his hungry eyes
What is the price of lust, love and lies
No one will find you hiding in your shadow land
