And so the giant crushed the ocean and the sun
Graced by the blood of the conqueror
Wander to the sea
A fervent lust born by the stars
Lost in the waves, driven by the flames

The unsung lament of the falling star
A dying echo on a burning shore
The beacon spoke with fire, ablaze
From the ashes rose a new dawn
To tame the sun

Huntress of light pierce the night
Goddess of moons guide the stars

Rise against the tide
Bow before the flame
Become the fallen sun
Beckon the fallen one

At the edge, the outermost
To burn out with fire in heart
To burn through the night

The final grace of a fading moon
Takes you home but never back

Adrift with the tide
