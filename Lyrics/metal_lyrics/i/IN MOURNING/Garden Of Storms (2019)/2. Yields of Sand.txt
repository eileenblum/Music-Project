I denied your swinging flail
Cutting through my shields
And you feel just right here
But you feel so dark
The night, it's all gone
You made me weak
You made me feel like i belong

Burning rain
Falling blade
Penetrates the ground
Search for shades
Staining the skies
With the blood of your hands

In darkened shapes
We're loosing all reflections
With an arrow to your broken heart
March in the fire

Fading trail
Demon tail
Cutting through the sand
Shielding hand

Burn, kneel before the empress
Before the face of defiance
So treacherous
Obey, deceptive are her hands

Burning trails in the blackened sand
Weaving a greater escape
Hiding all that would never be true
Beckoning grail of storms
Crushing all in it's path
When the shadows fade
You will find your way

By the hand
The yields of sand
The blood
All will fail
