The trembling ground in shade of pillars
Carry the weight, an endless walk(?)
Counting steps of an ancient time
A last decisive call

The clashing contrast of the silence
Gathers the hall, with malefic glow
The focus scatters though the stone
A labyrinth of lights

When the sand has passed
None will be untouched
By the blade
Before scorching lament
Permeates the origin
Weave the thread

The burden falls within the sunset
Resisting all of the might
Within the reach of a hand
The failure won't unto the harm
Moon so near ascension
To return upon the night
With blood before the eye
Bury the truth in the sky
Sacrifice for the lie
When the ending is nigh

When the final straw
Falls to the field
Animate the stars
Rearrange the path
The night, all set to fall
By the carrying crumb
