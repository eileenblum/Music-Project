I have seen this enemy
Crawling back with dignity
Came from my past so I couldn't defy it
Changing my looks so I couldn't deny it

Oh this is a new day
It takes me to the wrong way
I come and I go and I do ignore
I can't believe I've done this before

Dark is my hallucination
I've got a feeling of this pain that grows
Black ghost points into the mirror
Burning selfdestructive torture

Twisted thoughts drown determination
Just try and stop me, you can't control
Black eyes, we point together
Staring behind our fucking lives

I have seen this enemy
Crawling back with dignity
Came from my past so I couldn't defy it
Changing my looks so I couldn't deny i

Oh this is a new day
It takes me to the wrong way
I come and I go and I do ignore
I can't believe I've done this before

Twisted thoughts drown determination
Just try and stop me, you can't control
Black eyes, we point together
Staring behind our fucking lives
