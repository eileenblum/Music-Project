The tired moon was crawling through the trees
The branches were casting shadows on the ground
A sad tale took place that October morning
A lost soul left home for the last time
Betrayed by the world, the unknown and invisible
Tangled in a web of reality never real for her

The view of the world was so different
From underneath the surface
In the water she felt no pain
And the wings of the magpie swept her breath away

She kneeled for death in silence
The trail to the lodge is Julia
In the water she felt no pain
And the wings of the magpie swept her breath away

She was left to this decision alone
Misguided in the careless crusade

So she went away that day
It was the end of her world
She walked the narrow way blinded by life
Blinded by life

The presence of pain was here
In water tears were invisible
It was all in the crest of misery
She kneeled for death in silence

No answers will be found and the black lodge still remains
It has always been the end, and she was finally there
The dying moon laid down to rest through the nightmares
And overhead the cloudy sky started to cry
