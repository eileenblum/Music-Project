A tower of flames and fire carries the newborn sun
Above was once his home, from below now rises to the heavenly throne

A tower of fire and flame carries the newborn sun
Above was once his home, from below now rises to the throne
Lost the path so long ago, left the past into hiding
The new light is cold and casting shadows that linger

Red light gushes over land and sea, opening a floodgate of iniquity
To reconquer this fading earth, the below rises to the above

Creeping upon us all, feasting on the sanity of man
The insurrectionary ascending the cannopy
A new domain, bedarkened by the emperor.
Below rise to the above

Creeping upon us all, feasting on the sanity of man
The insurrectionary ascending the cannopy
A new domain  bedarkened by the emperor
All bow down! For this is a new age
The fire of death is among us now
