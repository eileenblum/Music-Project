The incarnation of Hades.
Sailing a crimson river.
Governing the newborn earth.

Behold
The tormentors creation.
Sculptures of ember
In the afterglow gallery.
In the midst of perdition
Lies the voyagers path.

With the aid
Of the shadows.
In hiding,
The legion withdraws.
A barren fate
In the hands
Of the keeper.
