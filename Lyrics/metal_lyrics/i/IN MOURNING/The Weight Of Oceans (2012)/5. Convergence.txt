Bleak, the sky is pale or is it the water
Vapor conceals the ends and the beginnings
Adrift between awake and asleep, the stillness entwines a wavering mind

Awake, the trail forms through transparent walls
To make way for stars to walk the surface
The silence enshrouded in a halo of light, to wake the sleeper

Wake up son, the storm is over
Don't let yourself slumber in the arms of the frail
It's time to remember why you are here
With fire to open the eyes of the hunter
The flow of time will not stay and wait for you
Rise before you crumble under the weight of oceans

A convergence of the lost light
To spark the flame that drowned in the storm

Who are you to abandon faith, you made the promise to conquer the ocean
A fall into oblivion, leaving the reborn to the black sea

Light climbing down, embodying the hunter
With fire to open up the eyes of the weary
He came with the call of the lost legion
With voices of the ancient ones, asking for remembrance
