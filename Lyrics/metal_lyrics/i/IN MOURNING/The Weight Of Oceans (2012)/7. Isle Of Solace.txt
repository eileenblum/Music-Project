Haggard body, frail existence
Breaking through the waves, grasping for a cold surface
Swimming in uncertainty towards undefined nothing
When a dream is dying, the water is an endless foe
Agony ridden desolate struggle
Underneath the dark lies an unending depth

One foot hit the bottom, a cold touch of the ocean floor
A brief glimpse of hope, a sight of a coming relief
Loosing contact, slipping away from the newfound reverie

Slither ashore on newfound soil
Salt meets sand, cleansing the hands of the wounded
Illusionary shelter
Stranded on illusive ground, an island in a dream of solace

Trembling ascends from inside of the island
Given new life, the land awoke from it's ancient rest
Arms shot like towers through the foam and the waves
Surrounding and closing in, pulled under and torn deep down

A stream of emptiness from underneath sweeps it all away
Rising in the distance, apparition
An island lures a dreamer on the verge between life and ocean

Sinking further into the blackness of the inkcloud,
Slipping away with a final breath of water
