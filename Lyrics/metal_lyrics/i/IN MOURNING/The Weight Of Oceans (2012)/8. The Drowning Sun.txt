The air from a starlit sky opens the eyes in another moon awakening
Stranded again without memories, not knowing where or how, not knowing why

An ocean haunted mind on the shore of a new beginning
Tired eyes gaze to abandoning skies, one last time reaching for guidance

A faded star appears, hanging by the silent horizon

And the sun fell from the sky, no hands could reach that very far
Drifting apart, so out of remedy
And the sun left like it knew, never spoke of what to come
Left faith flickering in a nebulous end

A drowning sun at the end of the day, star guider leading to nowhere
Questioning the coming end, is this what is meant to be the closing chronicle

A lonesome voyager at the end of the road
Star guider left an omega in spirit, in mind
A lost vow of an ocean that could not be conquered
Hope died the day the sun fell down
