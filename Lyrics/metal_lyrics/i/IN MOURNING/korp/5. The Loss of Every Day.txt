It's over now, why I'm here?
I loved your face, your smile, your breath,
I turn away I don't wanna see you,
You're hurting me, but you don't know.

I know that my dream will not come alive,
Whatever I see that's you,
I know that my dream will not come alive,
I miss you so much and I just can't take it.

Everything was so obvious you and me for eternity,
Everytime I'm so oblivious the loss of every day,
Everything was so obvious you and me for eternity,
Everytime I'm so oblivious the loss of every day.

[???].

Everything was so obvious you and me for eternity,
Everytime I'm so oblivious the loss of every day,
Everything was so obvious you and me for eternity,
Everytime I'm so oblivious the loss of every day.
