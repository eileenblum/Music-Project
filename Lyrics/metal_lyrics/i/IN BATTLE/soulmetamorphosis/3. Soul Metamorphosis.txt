Transform, transcend...
Rise from the ashes of life
I bless the darkness as I bless the light
At the end of the line we are the same

Rebirth, reshape...
Make my passing come
I son of darkness welcome the fading light
At the end of the line we are the same

Nothing...
Nothing...

In life and death we praise our kind
Not to realize that we are sheep and nothing more
We shall fall from grace and we shall suffer ever after
Life is for the meek, we shall transcend

Soul metamorphosis
Soul metamorphosis
Life, death symbiosis

Mesmerized, terrorized...
Haunted by our existence
Never shall you be god
Never shall the wicked rest

I wear the flames of eternity branded upon my soul
I wear the crown of the wicked and I am everlasting
