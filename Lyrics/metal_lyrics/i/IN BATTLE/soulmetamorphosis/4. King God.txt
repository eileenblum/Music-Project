Death god, king god, father of all
From the bowels of Ginnunga, create the world
The blood of Ymer flows through the land
As the king sits on the highest seat
In the morning of ages the oldest of gods
Lifted the land to the heights
From the flesh and blood of the old giant Ymer
The world of Midgard was form

In the well of Mimer... the power of wisdom lay
The sweetest of meads was given to our king
In return for the eye he gave

War god, king god, father of all
Nine chants of power, power of the runes
Nine nights he hung in the great tree of life
I know I hung in the windswept tree, nine whole nights
Pierced by my own spear and given to Odin
Myself to myself

King god
Hail and praise the king of Asgard
King god
Hail and praise the god of war

Death god, king god, father of all
From the bowels of Ginnunga, create the world
The blood of Ymer flows through the land
As the king sits on the highest seat
War god, king god, father of all
Nine chants of power, power of the runes
Nine nights he hung in the great tree of life
