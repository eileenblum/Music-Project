Blackness came to us this night of sin
And the gates of darkness opened
For the undead legion's of Hel
The heavens lay before us the night of death
And the black winds roar as the sky lights up with flames

Burning angels fall towards a certain death
Legions march... legions strike
Bursting into fire, the heavens are aflame
Legion of northern darkness strike

The mountains crumble into the sea
And the sun turns black
This is the arrival of the blackened one
Emperor of the north
Enforcer of doom
He comes to us with darkness
And by his side legions of wolves awaits
Awaits the sign of attack

The battle is over and through the smoke a new empire dawns

Dawn of darkness
