We are the new crusaders
We are the first in line
We are the coming, the rising storm
A manifestation granted in soulless flesh
We are the beginning, the end
And all that's in between
We are the future of the evolution,
Transformed into retched filth

I despise the human innocence
I vomit in disgust
We are the future dead... we are the pioneers
I create
I create the sickening slime
I destroy
I am a pioneer... pioneer

We are the lost crusaders
Lost in time and space
We are the dying, lying race
A glitch in a perfect scheme
We are the beginning, the end
And all that's in between
We are the pioneers of the dead future

A flaming moon rises to chanting of the night
Our future is coming, this time it's real
A flaming sphere rises, engulfing us all
The future is coming and I'm the first in line

We have fallen from grace
We are the vile stench of life
We are the restless, the wicked
We are the future
I am one with the filth
I am one with the lies
I am a pioneer
And I love the future... dead
