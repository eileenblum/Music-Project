Here we stand with burning souls
Together as one burning mass
I have gazed beyond the stars
And seen the depths of the abyss

I have walked through time and space
Forever watching the darkness spread
Now the time ahs come to embrace this 
World with flames

Rise...
Flames of the abyss burn
I'm the god of time and space... I am fire
Rise... scorch... burn... fire...
I'm the blackened flame... I am fire

Fire... fire of death
Burn and cleans this world
Fire... fire of time
Burn... reshape the flesh

Branded by eternal flames
On demon wings we come
Branded by immortal pain
From the abyss we soar
