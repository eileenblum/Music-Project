Standing tall... stone-faced mountains
In the silence of the Fimbul winter
A blistering cold barren landscape
Awaiting the storms of the century

Standing tall... stone-faced giants
From the frozen plains of Nifel
In great numbers the Rimturs march
Marking the beginning of the final battle

Stone-faced mountains
Eternal mountains... all that shall remain
Stone-faced mountains
Raging war... none shall remain

Storm of the century...
Winds of death blow with fury
Welcome to the battlefield...
Welcome to the lasts of wars
Storm of the century...
Winds of war are coming now
Welcome to the battlefield...
Spawn of Loki... scorn of this world
Storm of the century...
Winds of death blow with fury

Standing tall... fiery demons
The grand doors of Muspel opens
The king of demons release the flame
And the end has been brought
