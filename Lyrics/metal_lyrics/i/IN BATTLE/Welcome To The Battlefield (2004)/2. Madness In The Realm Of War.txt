Dead forever, forever shall be
In my dreaming void agonized
Forever to soar in the open flesh
Drink the blood of the beast

Madness... in the realm of war

Dehumanized, take my hand with trust
I give you the weapons to kill
Demonized by the burning rage of war
I drag your soulless flesh to the core

I manifest my worlds, I bring flesh to bone
I crush the pillars of life
I bring fear, I bring truth
I bring damnation for the blessed

Millennium of chaos, millennium of death...
Suffering and pain
Years of warfare, years spent on the battlefield

The stench of decayed, dying flesh

A taste of death so sweet upon your lips
A world decomposed, infested with rats
