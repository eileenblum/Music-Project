As thy arrive from the blackest planet of our solar system
Many aeons have passed since thy took advantage of dark mountain
The place where we observed.....Thy passed!
Thy in thee ritus of the black woods as thy black rays increase by thy summoning
Invoking in tongues unknown vomited like the elementals
Aeonic kaos spells echo through the black woods

Dogs in slaughter, yield in disruption â fear feeding thy astral veil
We observe and see â thy thought forms discreate
In our astral vision â awareness is one in Untime
Thy fungous entities are floating â through mists of dark vapor
Propulsive to the chosen building â to invade thee souls inside
Blown into the kaosmic abyss â thy fungi entities shrieking unto its gateways
most morbid in appearance â trans-morphing complex high technologies
placed vacuum brain android protoplasm â engaging into the vortex void
carries the droids awareness â into multidimensional atmospheres
in use of its astral seeing eye â the warlock observes its pathway
unto the blackest planets â travelling through all devouring black holes
to the all engulfing and unspeakable â kaos worlds of the ancient onesâ¦

As thy arise we observe thy 'floating'
above dark mountain with colors oh so bright
into interstellar space (without any form of ship)
aural shine like liquid travelling in this force field
the chosen souls are given a kaosmic in secret experience

In a leveled state of consciousnessâ¦.to be fatal yet unknown
lead by thy fungi (creatures) through kaosmic nether spheres
of darkest matter and subtle strange energies
Thy travel the kaosmic seas of pure utter darkness
on kaosmic winds we f(ol)low towards a void of no return
Back in the chosen building a wax mask was found of Nyarlathotepâ¦
Iak Iak Yog-Sothothâ¦ Iak Yuggothâ¦ Iakâ¦ Kthulhuâ¦
