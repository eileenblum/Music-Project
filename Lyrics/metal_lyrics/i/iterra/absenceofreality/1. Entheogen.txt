The purest transcendency
I go beyond the void
My blood only flows with purpose
With the music they call noise
This is my entheogen
This is me breaking away
This is me breaking the chains
This is me breaking the chains

I give myself away
Further and further into the deep space
Astral projected from the sound
The universe canât contain me now

The greatest ascendancy
I fall away from the abyss
The spirit is then released
Melodic chaos fills the emptiness
This is my entheogen
This is my only escape
This is my only escape

[Chorus]

I never feel more alive
I sink further into the sky

[Chorus]

I never feel more alive
I sink further into the sky
