You sit and wonder of what lies beyond
How the fuck did you end up this far gone?
No longer can I watch you waste away
The bonds between us have already frayed

Why canât you just feel it?
Why canât you just reach it?
Why canât you just believe it?
A reflection now blurs it all

Stop staring at yourself and break the glass
The blood can be replaced
The pain will subside
This could all subside

And this time-Itâs fair well
So long-Letâs burn it down
Consistency-Brings out an enemy
So gone-These vicious circles

Being human is your core distraction
Indulging in what killed your passion
The one promise you swore youâd keep
To never let go and accept defeat

I see the end of the world
And its deep in your eyes
But in the best way
But in the best way

Iâm hoping youâll shed your fear
Take the lunge to find beauty in the unknown
Stop injecting the fear
Stop ingesting your fear

[Chorus]

Break the glass
Break the glass

Watching colors form from gray
If only youâd find your way

[Chorus]

Like vultures
You hover above me
Hoping to tear me a part
No not anymore
No never again
