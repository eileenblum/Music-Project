Blown off the hinges
Walking cautiously outside
Realizing what had been
No longer dwells inside
I might just lose myself
Let the current take me
Manipulate my soul and my body

I found God in the ocean
But he refused to come ashore
The world is so unprepared
For whatâs in store

And in this moment
Iâve come to understand [2x]

There was a need for death
To have imprisoned myself
But I regret the casualties
But I regret the casualties

I found Gods just beyond the trees
But they set the forest aflame
Never to be seen or heard
Never to be known of again

[Pre-chorus &amp; chorus]

And I slip
Descending so slowly
Sitting and waiting
Drifting patiently

I will never be the same
One with the riptide
This will never be the same
I will never be the same
