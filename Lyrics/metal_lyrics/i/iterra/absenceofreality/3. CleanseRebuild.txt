The gears greased with their blood
They feed the machine
I, The Resistant-You, The Disgusting
Oh killers amongst the masses take your stand against the world
Those fighting above the ashes continue cleansing and rebuild

Damn this travesty-Weâve created
Born with such potential only to betray it

Oh how weâve betrayed it
And disgraced what weâve been given

You call yourselves humans
A race of superior beings
A lie furthest from the truth
A vile plague soon to kill itself
Soon to kill itself

[Chorus 2x]

I, The Resistant
You, The Disgusting
I hoped to never see this day

But only through destruction can we survive
So who has the strength to abolish the lie

[Chorus 2x]

I will see this to the end
Will you fight with me or fill the grave [2x]

Youâre lying in [2x]
