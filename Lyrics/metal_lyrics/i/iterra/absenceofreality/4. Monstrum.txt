Paralyzed from the luring intent
A new breed of fear it plans to invent
Enslaved in the rude awakening
Anger with such intensity
To defy it-To deny it
I speak of the insidious within me

Just breathe-Just bleed [2x]
Guttural snarls warm my ears [2x]

Through screams-I confront the beast
What is your desire?-Why have you come? [2x]

[Pre-chorus]

So give me-your fucking life
Lend me-your fucking mind [2x]

I will have it, I need it, I crave it
I want it now-I want it now

They say dreams
They say nightmares
No reason to fear or suspect
But it has come to collect
It has come to collect
It has come to collect

[Chorus]

Iâve watched you from the depths
I claimed you from the rest
I own you-I am you
Forever you are mine
