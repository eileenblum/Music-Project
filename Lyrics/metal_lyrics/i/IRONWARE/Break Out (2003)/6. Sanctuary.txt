Through yearsof war and confusion
We will never find our way home
We are lost without a trace
Where will we go to rest our souls
Through a battlefield we go
On a voyage far from home

A world of war a neverending fight
Will we survive our destiny

Take us to our sanctuary
A place where weÂ´ll be free
From evil and darkness there is no salvation
Save us from this madness

Before the dawn we must pass the line
Through a wasteland of evil we walk
Join us now itÂ´s time
With glory and pride we rise and we strike
WeÂ´re leaving the deadly ground
Follow us back home

A world of war a neverending fight
Will we survive our destiny

Take us to our sanctuary
A place where weÂ´ll be free
From evil and darkness there is no salvation
Save us from this madness

Take us to our sanctuary
A place where weÂ´ll be free
From evil and darkness there is no salvation
Save us from this madness

Take us to our sanctuary
A place where weÂ´ll be free
From evil and darkness there is no salvation
Save us from this madness
