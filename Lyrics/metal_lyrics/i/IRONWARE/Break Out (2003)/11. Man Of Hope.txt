Silent wind blows over this land
You got its faith right in you hand
You got to be the strongest one
DonÂ´t be the one who will fall

Open up your eyes do you know who you are
YouÂ´re the one who never will fall
Make a wish and it will surely come true
You were made to

Fight the evil, fight the pain
Make a wish or die in vain
Fight the evil, fight the pain
Make a wish or die in vain

To save our kind it is your faith
You must always fight and never hesitate
We put our faith and trust in you
Please make our wishes come true

Open up your eyes do you know who you are
YouÂ´re the one who never will fall
Make a wish and it will surely come true
You were made to

Fight the evil, fight the pain
Make a wish or die in vain
Fight the evil, fight the pain
Make a wish or die in vain

Man of hope walk into my life
Man of hope stand by my side
Save us now
Man of hope Stand by my side
Man of hope until the end of time
Man of hope Â´til the end of time

Open up your eyes do you know who you are
YouÂ´re the one who never will fall
Make a wish and it will surely come true
You were made

Fight the evil, fight the pain
Make a wish or die in vain
Fight the evil, fight the pain
Make a wish or die, die in vain
Fight the evil, fight the pain
Make a wish or die in vain
