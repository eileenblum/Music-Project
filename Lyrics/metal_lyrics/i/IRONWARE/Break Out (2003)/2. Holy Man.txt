They lost their pride, they lost their lives
They witnessed the perfect crime
For ages their story has been told
What could they do, what could be done
A dangerous struggle in a dangerous time
Tell me would I understand

Stand up and reclaim your rights
Raise your hands to the endless sky

Give me a sign from the sky
Make my voice echo through the night
And all the world can see
A dream made for you and for me

They searched for peace and faced war
Would they rise or would they fall
In an evil time without control
They lost their pride, they lost their lives
They were struggling in a dangerous time
Awaiting a hero to arise

WhereÂ´s the end and what is your goal
In this time preparing for war

Give me a sign from the sky
Make my voice echo through the night
And all the world can see
A dream made for you and for me

Holy man show us the way
To mother earth heal us again
Find the cure to our poisoned hearts
Will we ever find our freedom again

Give me a sign from the sky
Make my voice echo through the night
And all the world can see
A dream made for you and for me

A holy sign from the sky
Make my voice echo through the night
And all the world can see
A dream made for you and for me

Holy man show us the way
To mother earth heal us again
