Since you were born you never had any friends
You life it was a misery
They locked the door and threw the key
Your face on the ground
Dirt on your face they pushed you around
And told you lies
A longing pain inside your mind
Many nights you cried

Stand up now change the terms of your life
MakeÂ´em pay for
All the deeds they have done

ItÂ´s time to leave this world of hate
My friend break out before itÂ´s to late
Take a deep deep breath as we fly into space
It is time to make your stand

Can you hear them calling as the night is falling
The light of freedom shines so bright ahead
Whispering words in your mind
Break those chains that hold you down

Stand up now change the terms of your life
MakeÂ´em pay for
All the deeds they have done

ItÂ´s time to leave my friend
And this world of hate will die
Longing for a better life
Break those chains that hold you down

ItÂ´s time to leave this world of hate
My friend break out before itÂ´s to late
Take a deep deep breath as we fly into space
It is time to make your stand
