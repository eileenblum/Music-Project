I am walking down the line so far from reality
Eternal pain I donÂ´t fear this is who I am
For all eternity IÂ´m locked inside this misery
Eternal pain I donÂ´t fear this is who I am

Why canÂ´t you see it now
Why canÂ´t you believe it
Time to leave this pain from deep inside

IÂ´ve seen insanity a dark dream far from reality
I hold my ground, canÂ´t you see this is who I am
I see myself in line closer to my dignity
ItÂ´s time to break free is this real
No one is there to see

Why canÂ´t you see it now
Why canÂ´t you believe it
Time to leave this pain from deep inside

Why canÂ´t you see it now
Why canÂ´t you believe it
Time to leave this pain from deep inside
