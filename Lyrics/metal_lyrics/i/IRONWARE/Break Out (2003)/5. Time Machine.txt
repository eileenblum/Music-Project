Voices crying for help, voices of time
They will remain in pain
We see a sign, a sign in the sky
It shines so bright, please guide us in time

In a timemachine we travel on and on and on
Through a gate of dimensions we ride

Always in time for the battle beyond
Fighting with pride with the Gods on our side
Silent we rise and weÂ´re breaking the chains
Today is the day, weÂ´re gonna show you the way

In time we ride weÂ´ll be there for you
We never give in weÂ´re heading for the past
We see a sun, a sun in the past
ItÂ´s time for our fight feels like there is no end

In a timemachine we travel on and on and on
Through a gate of dimensions we ride

Always in time for the battle beyond
Fighting with pride with the Gods on our side
Silent we rise and weÂ´re breaking the chains
Today is the day, weÂ´re gonna show you the way

On and on through the gates made of time
Echoes from voices caught and left behind
Feel the rush as we fly together
WeÂ´re leaving our world with the speed of light
Whispering words the secret of time is finally revealed

In a timemachine we travel on and on and on
Through a gate of dimensions we ride

Always in time for the battle beyond
Fighting with pride with the Gods on our side
Silent we rise and weÂ´re breaking the chains
Today is the day, weÂ´re gonna show you the way
