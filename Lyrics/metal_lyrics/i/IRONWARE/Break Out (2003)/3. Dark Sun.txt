A galaxy beyond our minds
Our eyes are closed, we donÂ´t look behind
Freezing  air as the sun is turning cold
Like a broken arrow it will fall, hear my scream
ItÂ´s my final call, soon it will be time to leave

ItÂ´s time to see - Time to feel
Time to meet my destiny
Prepare myself for a mystical ride
To see the end of your time

I see the darkness beyond the stars
There is a space waiting for me
Cold breeze as the sun turns cold
Dark sun where the young turns old

As years have passed, the memories will last for evermore
Of an world made out of beauty
And a mankind filled with hope
The light is out, the end is near
Our sun will die , see my fear
The era of our earth will finally end

ItÂ´s time to see - Time to feel
Time to meet my destiny
Prepare myself for a mystical ride
To see the end of your time

I see the darkness beyond the stars
There is a space waiting for me
Cold breeze as the sun turns cold
Dark sun where the young turns old

This is the end of time right before my eyes
A world in pain that slowly fades away
Was I wrong or was I right, I leave it up to you to decide
Time is up the end came so fast

ItÂ´s time to see - Time to feel
Time to meet my destiny
Prepare myself for a mystical ride
To see the end of your time

I see the darkness beyond the stars
There is a space waiting for me
Cold breeze as the sun turns cold
Dark sun where the young turns old
