I met a man with a mastermind
He looked at me with his opened eyes
He laid his hand on me and said you need some help
He told me not to be afraid
YouÂ´re gonna be the one who saves
Eternal pain are what they live in
They are the slaves
I canÂ´t believe my own two eyes
When I look into the land
The wasteland where its people are in pain

Beyond tomorrow weÂ´ll be strong
We fight for the one who will join us
Together we ride out Â´cause we will return
Once again in the end

We are the saviors
We are the saviors
We are the saviors for you
We are the saviors
We are the saviors
We are the saviors for you

We break the line to a land of fear
To give a helping hand donÂ´t fear
We break the defense right down to the ground
The man I met with a mastermind
He looked at me with his opened eyes
He said IÂ´ll do it someday with you again

Beyond tomorrow weÂ´ll be strong
We fight for the one who will join us
Together we ride out Â´cause we will return
Once again in the end

We are the saviors
We are the saviors
We are the saviors for you
We are the saviors
We are the saviors
We are the saviors for you

So the world is dark and cold
YouÂ´ve got nowhere to go
There is no-one out there to protect your soul
But you shall have no fear
Do you know who we are?
We are the saviors tonight

Beyond tomorrow weÂ´ll be strong
We fight for the one who will join us
Together we ride out Â´cause we will return
Once again in the end

We are the saviors
We are the saviors
We are the saviors for you
We are the saviors
We are the saviors
We are the saviors for you tonight
