The king he stands alone
HeÂ´s standing all alone
And he cries because itÂ´s time
HeÂ´s too blind to see he will win this victory
With his mighty sword heÂ´ll fight
He will come one day and he will save my land
He is my king, MY KING

He came one night many years ago
The evil creature he took control
He stole the crown and became the king
The king of a twisted dream
Stories tell me about a man
Who will come some day to save my land
A man with a great heart
And will be the one and the only king

With shinning armor he will rise high above
To fight the evil down to the ground

Here comes the king proud as he stands
He is fighting with power with a sword in his hand
A mighty man heÂ´s the souls who have burned
I see it so clear, now the king has returned

He will save our land so the stories tell
Kill this man and break the spell
Fight by his side, fight for my king
I will fight for my land, I will fight to win

On hope we live through all our pain
The king will come I hope some day
At the sky I look as I pray
The king will come is all I say

With shinning armor he will rise high above
To fight the evil down to the ground

Here comes the king proud as he stands
He is fighting with power with a sword in his hand
A mighty man heÂ´s the souls who have burned
I see it so clear, now the king has returned

A land in pain a battlefield I see a lonely man
A sword held high he stands there
In anger he stands there in pain
I stand beside him and I will

Fight for my king I will fight by his side
Fight for my king Â´til the end, the end of time
Fight for my king every night every day
Fight for my king  silent I pray

I look to the sky in silence I bend
But it will never stop it will never end
Where is my king I want him here
He is coming to me now heÂ´s so near
I look in his eyes I see who it is, yes itÂ´s my king

With shinning armor he will rise high above
To fight the evil down to the ground

Here comes the king proud as he stands
He is fighting with power with a sword in his hand
A mighty man heÂ´s the souls who have burned
I see it so clear, now the king has returned
