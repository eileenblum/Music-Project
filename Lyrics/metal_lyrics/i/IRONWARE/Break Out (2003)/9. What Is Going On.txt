WhatÂ´s going with the world what is going on
Deserted by gods can I hold on
The anger inside defeating my life
Driven by hunger my heart is turning
This madness I see I can not believe
My mind is so blank the truth is a lie
I donÂ´t understand IÂ´m wondering why
How could this happen
Our world is so full of hate

Sail away with your heart and mind
Be true to yourself donÂ´t live a lie
With honor and pride youÂ´re standing so high
The future will open your eyes in time

WhatÂ´s left to fear my heart is of steel
Stronger and stronger I will not go under
The anger inside it keeps me alive
Driven by hunger the end is coming near

Sail away with your heart and mind
Be true to yourself donÂ´t live a lie
With honor and pride youÂ´re standing so high
The future will open your eyes in time

So now itÂ´s time to find a way
To turn this round and kill all lies
Stay alive for all mankind
Walk away from eternity
Behind those wall of reality
Find a reason why everything went wrong

Sail away with your heart and mind
Be true to yourself donÂ´t live a lie
With honor and pride youÂ´re standing so high
The future will open your eyes in time

Sail away with your heart and mind
Be true to yourself donÂ´t live a lie
With honor and pride youÂ´re standing so high
The future will open your eyes in time
