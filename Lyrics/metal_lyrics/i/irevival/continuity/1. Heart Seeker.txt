I have finally understood
The universe within my mind
Powered with such knowledge
Gifted with such pureness

Overcoming my weaknesses
My imperfections, insecurities
A vision without the eyes to see
A mind at peace is the treasure I seek

Across the ocean, across the see
Finding light, finally breaking free
I've seen realms of evolutions
I've built dreams through nightmares

I belong to no one as long as my heart can breathe
Nothing more that I seek for
Than running free

Listen, listen I know you've had your own affliction but there's another way to see yourself and discover

Traveling to and fro seeking for answers
Changing my mind, changing directions
Trapped in oblivion of circles and circles
Finding my way out of grief

Listen, listen I know you've had your own affliction but there's another way to see yourself and discover
It's not the words that put you in motion
It's not the words, it's not the words that put you in motion

I am not afraid
I am not afraid
