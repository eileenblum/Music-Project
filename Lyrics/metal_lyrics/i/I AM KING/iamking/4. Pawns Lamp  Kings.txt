I have seen the light
From a far and distant shoreline

I see things so differently
Than you who claims to know it all
Well, you're just a pawn while I am a king
You will never be free

You walk around and wear these chains
As if they were a fashion
And you will be eaten alive
As the sky fades to black
And colors fade to gray
And you will die alone defeated inside
Just remember no one makes it out alive

So you think you know what it's all about?
When the only thing you've seen is your face in the mirror
There's so much more, there's so much more

For I have seen the future
There is an eye that watches all
As time slips through our fingers
We realize it was never in our hands at all
The fault of man, we think we understand
The fruits of knowledge

When the first step in knowing is knowing
That we know nothing at all

I see the light of our people
On a far and distant shoreline

So you think you know what it's all about?
When the only thing you've seen is your face in the mirror
There's so much more, there's so much more

Look into me
Why don't you take a step back and tell me what you see
Were we not meant once with our hopes and our dreams
That we traded for death
Just remember no one makes it out alive

So you think you know what it's all about?
When the only thing you've seen is your face in the mirror
There's so much more, there's so much more
