This is all we have
Prepare for the worst
And let go of all fears
Don't let it take you in
To you, who hides
Who hides behind a mask
Your disguise is only getting clearer
So face yourself

Open your eyes and realize
That the monster inside
Is all you have to fear

The future lies in the palm of my hands
Wake me up, 'cause I'm still dreaming
Even though this world is deceiving

Take the time
And see these pieces
Fall into place
And everything I know
Has happened for a reason

Open your eyes and realize
That the monster inside
Is all you have to fear

We must let go of what we knew
And stand for what we know is true
I saw the light
And let the shadows replace it
I knew the truth
But I just couldn't face it

But I can't seem to find myself
Lost along the chain of memories
I have made

And there's something behind the clouds
That we can't see
All things that once had meaning
Drag behind me
We've been living a lie
We've been living a lie
A masquerade that will end in destruction
You've been living a lie
You're not at all what you pretend to be

When thoughts can only get you so far
Liar
Get down on your knees
And we see the darkness and the light
Entwine, as the end of the world
Becomes so clear to me

Open your eyes and realize
That the monster inside
Is all you have to fear

If you could see my heart
(so face yourself)
You'd see we're all the same
(You're all you have to fear)
If you could see my heart
(so face yourself)
You'd see we're all the same
(You're all you have to fear)

We're all the same
