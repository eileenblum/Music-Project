Tell me,
Why do we have to be so selfish
In the way we think in the way we breath.
Aren't we better than our machines?
Our hearts have turned to stone.
We walk away from everything we've known.

We build our lives on these moments
And haven't you noticed
That it's never enough.
They left you scarred and broken.
Now that your eyes are open
Hold on tight.

I wish you could feel what I felt
And see what I've seen
As the colors of this life
Blend before me.
If I could turn back time
I'd tear down that tree
That separates the love
In front of you and me.

There I see you
Standing at the edge.
Trying so hard
To find our remedy.
We need to find the answers
Despite the questions you perceive.

And I have come to find
And realize,
I can do nothing
About the way we live our lives.
Sometimes i feel like I'm the only one
And this has just begun.
The sky is crying for the son.
Oh, can you feel me?

I wish you could feel what I felt
And see what I've seen
As the colors of this life
Blend before me.
If I could turn back time
I'd tear down that tree
That separates the love
In front of you and me.

This is the side of me
I never wanted to see.
I tried to fight it off,
The roots are taking hold of me.
We put on these blindfolds
So willingly.
This is the side of me
I never wanted to see.
