Look into me, tell me what you see
Were we not men once with our hopes and our dreams
that we've traded for death?
Now we stand shattered and alone,
Longing to come home and kiss our mothers
But we can't go home, no
After all of the faces,
and the places that we knew
Through all this perversion,
And the death that we chose.

There is hope for the liars and the thieves,
The lost and lonely people in this world
Believe me I've seen it,
Swear that I mean it
And everything you've done is cast away,
away into the sea.
