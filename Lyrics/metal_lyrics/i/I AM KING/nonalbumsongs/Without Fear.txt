No longer you will have to be afraid
I'm here to guide you
Here to show you the way

They're plotting against us
This blood is on your hands
They're plotting against us
We speak of brotherhood
it's just another trend
from the beginning our humanity
has signified the end

we are a nation of whores
selling ourselves
selling ourselves

This is the last time that I'm not
giving into letting go
why can't I see the light in front of me
why can't I let this go

Let the rain pour DOWN
And let this take hold
we've lost control
we've lost control
nothingness
we will all dissolve into nothingness
nothingness

Nothingness
we all fade
nothing you can do will make this go away
so tell me why are you afraid
so tell me why are you afraid

the time for us to change is now
so let nothing stand in our way
it's time to let our demons out
and let the light wash them away

This is the last time that I'm not
giving into letting go
why cant I see the light in front of me
why cant I let this go

This isn't over
it's just begun
with hearts like
black diamonds

we run
ask yourself what you believe
because the man behind the mask
is pulling us back in
