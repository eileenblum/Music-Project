When everything's not right,
What will you do?
Will you raise your fist and fight
Like we ask you too?
They're plotting against us,
They're calling you by name
They're plotting against us,
To take what you've made
Oh how did we come to this,
It seemed so effortless
We let it slip away
Let me (let me)
Show you (Show you)
How this was supposed to be
We let all of our fears get the best of us
We let them win,
We let them take us away
Listen to me,
I'l mot the same as you once knew me
New me
Over my dead body,
You'll never win
Over my dead body,
You'll never win
So take my hand,
and I'll show you the way out from here
When time stands still,
and the world stops spinning...
I'll be there for you
When time stands still,
and the world stops spinning...
I'll be there for you
This is the choice that we have made,
Were lost along the road
I Can't find my way without you
Let me (let me)
Show you (Show you)
How this was supposed to be
We let all of our fears get the best of us
We let them win,
We let them take us away
We hear the sirens calling your name
We can't make this to the end
Over my dead body,
You'll never win.
