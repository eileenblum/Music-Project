This is so far from home and everything we dreamed of,
Like we set this scene with secrets,
And just let it burn away, let it burn away

This is the way we show ourselves
That you are the one who left me for dead
So tell me how you can make this out alive?
Just tell me how, just tell me now

And dear sleeper, it's time to...
Wake up, it's time to wake up
Let's make the best of this
You are the sleeper, and I am the all watching eye
And realize that what's at stake is more than just a reputation

Open your eyes,
See whats inside
Let the truth wash over you
Open your eyes,
Don't fight the light
And together we will take this city back

And now your face is turned back to the wall,
Griping your fist tighter as we lose control
This is the end of us,
This is the end we've been seeking
This is the end of us,
This is the end we've been seeking

This is the last time that I'm not giving in to letting go (why can't I see)
This is the last time that I'm not giving in to letting go,
Why can't I see the light in front of me
In front of me
I've never been the one to let something go, but I can't escape this
And I know deep down inside,
that together we can fight this
(Fight it)

Open your eyes,
See whats inside
Let the truth wash over you
Open your eyes,
Don't fight the light
And together we will take this city back
