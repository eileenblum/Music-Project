How could this happen to me?
How did we end up on the wrong side of the road when we were trying to get home...home
You put your faith in me,
And I put my faith in you
This is not what I intended,
Or how I thought the story ended
It's been a long time since we found our way back
Fight through the darkness,
Right through the darkness
You were born of the earth,
Where the man has a curse
But you're finally alive
I'm alive
I will find my own way home,
It's the only road I should have known
(I should have known)
This darkness creeps,
Consuming me into nothingness
And all along,
We were wrong
I won't let them take you away,
I will die before I see you fall
So just take my hand and someday we'll run away,
To where the ocean meets the skyline,
To where the waves crash down and wash this all away
I saw the towers fall before your feet
I saw the cities crumble upon the kings and the thieves
Why are you here?
Your empty voices fill the room
Why are you here?
Your empty voices fill the room
Stop now,
Just stand here in the dark
Not a sound through all the crowd except the beating of our hearts
They can kill you,
but your dreams will never die
They can kill the man,
but his dreams will never die
You're losing control,
I'm losing you oh
So tell me what are you waiting for
And I'll give you a reason for trying
And let this be a test to your faith and everything we thought we knew before
And all along,
We were wrong
I won't let them take you away,
I will die before I see you fall
So just take my hand and someday we'll run away,
To where the ocean meets the skyline,
To where the waves crash down and wash this all away
