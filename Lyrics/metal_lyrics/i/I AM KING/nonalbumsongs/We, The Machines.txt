This is our fate,
and were bound to it
We live our lives knowing we can't change a thing
So throw your hearts together,
And we'll try to take this back
So throw your hearts together,
So we can take this back
And we stand on these mountain tops,
Listening to every word you say,
Word you say
So speak up and tell me what you plan to do
We have you figured,
We know what you do
These lies can only get you so far,
Liar get down on your knees
And we see the darkness and the light entwine,
As the end of the world becomes so clear to me
And we see the darkness and the light entwine,
As the end of the world becomes so clear to me
Let the stars fall down around my feet,
And open up my chest so I can breathe
If you could see my heart,
You'd see were all the same
If you could see my heart,
You'd see were all the same
They'll make us run in every direction,
Don't turn your back
They'll make us run in every direction
Don't turn your back
Don't turn your back
So sit back and watch this fall apart
Believe me when I say that I'm afraid of whats to come
I will not shake,
I will not tremble in your shadow
These bones may break,
But I will fight until my dying breath
Let the stars fall down around my feet,
And open up my chest so I can breathe
If you could see my heart,
You'd see were all the same
If you could see my heart,
You'd see were all the same
Can't you see the blood on my hands,
It's wreaking of regret
We're fighting wars of our fathers
(and only time will tell)
We're fighting wars of our fathers
(And only time will tell)
