I'll change the world
Or drag it straight to hell with me
When every day's the same
Wanting something will keep you sane
I'll claw my way from the bottom
Then I'll yell down from the top
And when it's time to fall
You and all will know I want it all
But if they speak my name
I just might answer the call

[Chorus:]
My ambition
It will define my whole life and I
I want it all in the palm of my hands
(Palms of my hands)
I want it all

It's all a joke
Just fools in a maze
We all play the game
To get a piece of something
They say we need
Well I don't fucking buy it anymore

It's not the outcome
But the process that defines the man
Trust me, the heart to believe
The strength to succeed
You know nothing of these things
You're all the same
Like the ground beneath me
You always try to pull me down
Yet here I have this crown

[Chorus:]
My ambition
It will define my whole life and I
I want it all in the palm of my hands
(Palms of my hands)
I'm so alone
Yet so alive
Will you ever understand my ambition?

We are the broken and the brave
So raise your fist to the sky
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, fuck)

It just goes to show
I'd rather die feeling alive
Than stay alive playing dead

[Chorus:]
My ambition
It will define my whole life and I
I want it all in the palm of my hands
(Palms of my hands)
I'm so alone
Yet so alive
Will you ever understand
Will you ever understand
Will you ever understand my ambition?
(Hey, hey, hey)
