[feat. Elliot Coleman]Sometimes, it's like the air after midnight is a little bit harder for me to breathe
Sometimes, I just need a little bit of time to find some piece of mind
Sometimes, I just need you to move it nice and slow for me

Because I am only a man who crumbles and fades as the weight of the world takes its toll on me
And right now I need your touch,
will you be my sanity?

Move slow,
like the seasons take time to change
I know what it takes to make you shake,
so come close cuz I know that you feel the same
I know that you feel the same

I feel your breath on my skin,
your heart's paper thin,
but that won't stop you no
You want to feel what's wrong,
girl you know I'm right
Baby, don't pretend to fight me on this fake love here tonight

Let the clocks melt from these walls,
as we lose ourselves in something that we make believe is real
If only for a moment suspended in night

Move slow,
like the seasons take time to change
I know what it takes to make you shake,
so come close cuz I know that you feel the same
I know that you feel the same

I've got this feeling deep inside,
it's getting hard to fight
Lets not fight,
close your eyes,
and closer
So baby,
don't you be afraid
Lose yourself tonight,
lose yourself tonight

Come close,
let the walls begin to quake
I feel your heart beating faster with every move you make
Don't be afraid,
lose yourself in me tonight

Move slow,
like the seasons take time to change
I know what it takes to make you shake,
so come close cuz I know that you feel the same
I know that you feel the same
