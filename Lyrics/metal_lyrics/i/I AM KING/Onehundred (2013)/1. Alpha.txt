The best lies have truth entwined
Designed to keep your mind
Suspended in darkness
You're so weak
Why are you fighting just to breathe?

[Chorus:]
If this is the end
Then God let me know
We are living for nothing
will we ever change?

Can you see it in my eyes?
A sickness is growing
There's no way of knowing
Which way I'll go
But you should really
Just worry about yourself
Why are you here?
Speak out
In the sound of existence
Lose your way
Or find the strength to stay

[Chorus:]
If this is the end
Then God let me know
We are living for nothing
Will we ever change?
So remove all these ties that bind you
And clear the way
The stars burn out on this brand new day

What do you stand for?
Why are you fighting just to breathe

[X2:]
This line where we once stood
Will always stay the same
Break free and just walk away

Today's the day to live your life
Fight off the fear that binds you
Fight back
Get angry... Before it's too late

[Chorus:]
If this is the end
Then God let me know
We are living for nothing
Will we ever change?
So remove all these ties that bind you
And clear the way
The stars burn out on this brand new day
