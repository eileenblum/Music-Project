Such potential wasted
On feeling chasing nothing
On a fleeting moment chasing nothing

And we prefer a lie
We prefer a lie
Over the truth about you and I
We beg for lies
(We beg for lies, we beg for lies)
We pay for lies
And we want more

(We've forgotten our colors)

[Chorus:]
Life can be cruel
Time can be unforgiving
But we hold out hope for the sake of another

To be alive is to be conflicted
To be alive
You must find something worth fighting for
Something worth fighting for

Let's do art for art's sake
And make melodies
From music we've heard
Somewhere in our dreams
(Somewhere in our dreams)

We the poor find riches in our dreams
But are your dreams even your own?
Have you forgotten to question everything?
We have forgotten our place
we have forgotten the taste of life
All for a lie

(We've forgotten our colors)

[Chorus:]
Life can be cruel
Time can be unforgiving
But we hold out hope for the sake of another
To know life
You must give yours away
To be free
You must let go and realize
We're not here to stay
Nothing lasts forever

[X2:]
Yesterday is gone
Like tomorrow will be gone
Like today will soon be gone
Like you and I will soon be gone

Yesterday is gone
Wake up

[Chorus:]
Life can be cruel
Time can be unforgiving
But we hold out hope for the sake of another
To know life
You must give yours away
To be free
You must let go and realize
We're not here to stay
Nothing lasts forever
Yesterday is gone
