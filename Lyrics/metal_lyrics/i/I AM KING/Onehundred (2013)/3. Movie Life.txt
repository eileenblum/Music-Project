If life were a movie
I'd be your hero
I'd save you someday
(Believe me, I won't let this go)

In our little fable
I'd be your savior
I'd take you away
(Believe me, I won't let this go)

But life ain't no movie
They're coming to take us
To take us away

We came together at unfortunate times
They say our flag doesn't believe
In you and me
They say we're out of time
But that won't stop me
From fighting for our dreams

[Chorus:]
Does the way the story ended take your breath?
And do you feel the way I feel here
Seconds from the end?
If the things I said could make a change
Then believe me when I say
That we will never be the same

Breath may be fading from our bodies
As our bones dissolve to dust
(Dissolve to dust)
But even after death
In my love you can always trust

Why can't we learn from history?
We can't stop the world from spinning
But we can change the way we're living

[Chorus:]
Does the way the story ended take your breath?
And do you feel the way I feel here
Seconds from the end?
If the things I said could make a change
Then believe me when I say
That we will never be the same

(Will never be the same)
(Will never be the same)
(Will never be the same)

Sometimes these things
Don't work out the way we planned
Though we made charts and graphs and wrote
Paragraphs to help us make our stand

[Chorus:]
Does the way the story ended take your breath?
And do you feel the way I feel here
Seconds from the end?
If the things I said could make a change
Then believe me when I say
That we will never be the same

We'll never be the same
