She told me she loved me
But she had some place to go
She put on her jacket
And headed into the cold
Something so simple
Something so sweet
Something for-granted
That moment will always be to me

[Chorus:]
Baby, why did you go?
How could you leave me?
Don't you know I'm alone?

You were all that was good in me
(That was good in me)
I can't believe we were robbed of
The time that we had
And if there's a God
Does he know that I'm going mad?
You were all that was good in me

[Chorus:]
Baby, why did you go?
How could you leave me?
Don't you know I'm alone?
You know that it kills me?
Life seems so cold
To think of my baby
With no hand to hold

Sink now
Let the ocean take you in
Sleep now
One day we'll dream again
This can't be right
This isn't fair
How can I live my life
If you're not even there?
(Not even there)

[Chorus:]
Baby, why did you go?
How could you leave me?
Don't you know I'm alone?
You know that it kills me?
Life seems so cold
To think of my baby
With no hand to hold

[Chorus:]
Baby, why did you go?
How could you leave me?
Don't you know I'm alone?

She told me she loved me
But she had some place to go
