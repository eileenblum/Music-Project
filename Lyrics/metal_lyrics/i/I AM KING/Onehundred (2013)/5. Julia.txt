Through these sleepless nights
I just can't get you off my mind
And I lay here silently
Thinking about the faces
And the places that you knew

[Chorus:]
And I know I was the one
Who set your heart on fire
I breathed in all you had
And I killed the life inside
That set us both on fire
So please forgive me

I know that I regret
What I have become
But I could never regret you
Though your name is burned on my lips
I still thank God every day
That the stars aligned that way
I can see the fear in your eyes
Though you claim your scars have healed

[Chorus:]
And I know I was the one
Who set your heart on fire
I breathed in all you had
And I killed the life inside
That set us both on fire
So please forgive me

So now you're in the arms of another man
Never to return to mine again
So now you're in the arms of another man
Never to return to mine again

It's like the feeling of being haunted
Eeeah
It's like the feeling of being alone

[Chorus:]
And I know I was the one
Who set your heart on fire
I breathed in all you had
And I killed the life inside
That set us both on fire
So please forgive me
so please forgive me
so please forgive me
