The clouds come rolling in
Like giant castles in the sky
To carry me home
Though I feel far away
From the things I have come to know
From that which I know
Love has begun to grow
The black sea of stars is calling my name

And I will answer their call
For you, my beloved
For you I will fall
Always for you

[Chorus:]
Take me back to where
To where the ocean meets the skyline
To a time
Where things somehow made more sense
To a place where we walked with innocence

To the edge of the worlds
If I have to go
Should oblivion take me
Nobody will know
I'll follow my heart
Whether it stops or starts
To take me away
Or right back to your arms

At the start of it all
For you, my beloved
For you I will fall
For you I will fall again

[Chorus:]
Take me back to where
To where the ocean meets the skyline
To a time
Where things somehow made more sense
To a place where we walked with innocence
You're my queen of hearts
You're the keeper of my keys
Every breath you take
You take away from me

The future doesn't scare me at all

Stop now
Let's just stand here in the dark
Not a sound through all these worlds except
The beating of our hearts

[Chorus:]
Take me back to where
To where the ocean meets the skyline
To a time
Where things somehow made more sense
To a place where we walked with innocence
You're my queen of hearts
You're the keeper of my keys
Every breath you take
You take away from me
