[feat. Spencer Sotelo Of Periphery]Do you know who controls the world?
Did you know the stage is set for you and I
And there's nothing we can do?

You will be forgotten
The sands of time roll on and on
And the power of pyramids go on
And on, and on

The price I paid was great indeed
A love
And a soul
And a family
I hate the eye
Yet here I am
A rebellious slave
With a dollar in my hand

Here I stand
At the end of all things
Where time means nothing
where the light and darkness
Become one in the same

The time has come to choose your side
To choose who lives and dies
Is there a God
Or just nothingness?
Maybe some judgment is what we need
To kill our self righteousness
Or maybe it wouldn't be
So bad to sink into a sea of nothingness

As sure as the seasons come and go
They will come to carry us home
To a place where lies are truth
To a place where the minds of our youth
Are not their own

Here I stand
At the end of all things
Where time means nothing
where the light and darkness
Become one in the same

Pray to your God
Prepare your heart
Omega comes at dawn
Hidden kings tear us apart
(Tear us apart)
Love will die
With no tears in our eyes
So choose your side as the skies open wide
Reign of fire
we've reached the end
Nothing will ever be the same again...

Here I stand
At the end of all things
Where time means nothing

Here I stand
At the end of all things
Where time means nothing
where the light and darkness
Become one...
