Faces, faces, everywhere I turn
Faces I've seen, bridges I've burned
Wanting, pleading, I can't overcome
The pressure is rising but it's too late to wake up
Stuck in the dream
So I run

I'm running away from my problems,
Running away from my failures
Chasing me, racing me, I can't escape
Nothing can save me now

They chase me endlessly, relentlessly
They keep on haunting me, they keep taunting me
"We want your body, we want your soul
We're gonna catch you, we won't let you go"

The world around me, only darkness
Evil surrounds me in this place

Twisted trees, they tangle and trip me
Crimson rivers, flowing and dripping
Like blood from an alien wound
Lifeblood from an alien wound

What do they want from me
Why are they here?

Friends morph into monsters
Inhuman limbs and beastly features
Stuck in the dream
I see no escape

Clawing at my soul, these ghosts they won't let go

I'm running away from my problems,
Running away from my failures
Chasing me, racing me, I can't escape
Nothing can save me now

A cave, a cove, a safe zone
Maybe if I hide, they will leave me alone
