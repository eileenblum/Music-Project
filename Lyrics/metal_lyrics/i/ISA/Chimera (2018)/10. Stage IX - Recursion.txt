I emerge from my body
Lying crumpled on the shore
Buffeted by the waves
Abandoned and forlorn
This vantage point is one I've never had before

Floating ever upwards, I watch the land recede

I am but a speck, indiscernible, invisible

The air grows thin
I've never been so high
Our globe's blue glow fades into starlight

I turn up and beyond
The heavens beckon

I am but a speck, indiscernible, invisible

Slowly drifting, the world slowly drifts
The world slowly drifts away

Is this the end? To dissolve into nothing?

My body stirs
My spirit rises

Wake me up
