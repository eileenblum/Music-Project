What have we done?
I look around at the mess of the world
All that the light touches is in bloody pieces

The scent awakens within me
A lust, a hunger, a need to feed
The beast is me

I follow my nose
The shadow of a palace grows
Opulent, it gleams before me
I follow my nose
The odor of this pallid fortress
Reeks of a privileged purgatory

What have they done?
"We need this war," he said
"They need to see our strength"

So emboldened, I lust for another
To feast of their flesh
To paint with their blood
For they comprise my kin's opposite: the other
They are the other and I'm seeing red
