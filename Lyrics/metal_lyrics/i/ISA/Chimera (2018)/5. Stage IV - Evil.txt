A swirling black cloud of bits of burned souls descends,
Obscuring the light that we made
The cave, the cove, is suddenly cold,
My heathen friend vanished, only I remain
But the dance must go on

I'm being watched by a beast so black,
The cavern light seems to be sucked into its scaly back
Like a black hole of wicked souls

It feeds on the ghostly flesh
Of the recently deceased
Ripping, tearing, gorging itself on memories
And it feeds

Slowly the beast turns to me (don't look)
Blood dripping from his jagged teeth (nowhere to hide)
He lets out an evil scream (don't look)
And he throws himself at me (nowhere to hide)

I run past forests of evil, fields of fear
I'd rather be anywhere other than here
The rising sun beckons me onwards,
Illuminating the landscape before me

I look back and see his eyes,
Hungry and visceral,
But the sun offers me some hope

Banishing demons back to their holes
Back to their darkness, the sun brings hope
In the sunlight, I will be saved.
