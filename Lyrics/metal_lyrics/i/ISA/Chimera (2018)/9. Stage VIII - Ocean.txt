I find myself floating alone on an ocean of clouds
Wondering how I got here

Adrift on this ocean
I search for the shore
I search for a sign
That I'm not alone

There's no sign of life for miles
As far as my eyes can see
Gently undulating, riding the waves
A distant shoreline drawing me in
to crash upon the rocks, breaking with the waves

A storm is rising in the sky

As the cliffs and stones approach
My breathing quickens

I choke, coughing

Will I be smashed upon the shore
Like so many before me?
Will my body be discovered
Before it rots away?
