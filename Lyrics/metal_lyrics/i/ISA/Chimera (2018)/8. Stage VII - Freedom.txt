I am waiting for a chance to prove myself
I am not what I've been told to be
My blood lust fades
I become me

What I am is unconstrained by convention
Fuck convention

I am free to change my form
(spread my wings)

I spread my wings and leap into the sky

Soaring above the mountaintops
I fly into the clouds

The clouds are drowning me
