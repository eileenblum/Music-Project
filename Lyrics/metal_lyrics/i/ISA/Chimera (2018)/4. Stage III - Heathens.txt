Catch my breath
Take a breather

No more fear
No more panic
Sleep on
Dream on

My sleeping body stirs
My roaming conscience blurs
A pair of eyes, gleaming in the darkness
They blink and look deep into my soul
The creature stirs, its steps are cautious

Slowly emerging, it reveals itself to me
And we dance

We raise up our arms, and we open our souls,
Heads tossed back and skin aglow.

The creature danced, it danced with me,
A heathen's dance for none to see

We dance and we dance until the room grows bright
With the energy we release from our souls
No shame, no fear, we do as we like,
A heathen's dance until the death bell tolls.
