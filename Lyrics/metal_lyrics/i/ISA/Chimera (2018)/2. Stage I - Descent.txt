I lay my head to rest
But my troubled mind won't let me be
My demons awaken when the lights go dim

I seek solace in sleep, but toss and turn

Sleep, dream...

My conscience is restless
I must soon release it
The weight of the world has become
Too much of a burden to bear

Slowly drifting, the world slowly drifts awayf
