Thirty cadavers and counting
As life slips away from my grasp
One final view
Salvation is denied
Stripped of self redemption
Haunted by torture
Left unseen danger
Taunted by agony
One last cry seals my fate
Thirty cadavers and counting
Flesh eaten away
From a mysterious bacteria
Organs are petrified
From exposure to chemicals
Thirty cadavers and counting
Haunted by torture
Left unseen danger
Taunted by agony
One last cry seals my fate
Maggots feasting on the flesh
Bodies mangled and diseased
The sight of carcasses
Eternal death I'm confined
A pool of cess and blood
Eternal death I'm confined
Dangling flesh
Torn off by the scavengers
Feeding on the corpses
Decaying maggot food
Dead body odor and stench
Exploding organs ooze
Intestines stretched across this
Sacred land of neverending fucking war
