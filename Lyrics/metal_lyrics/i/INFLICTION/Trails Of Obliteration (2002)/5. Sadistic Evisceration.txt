Torture devices are put
To the test to dissect
Bodies are still alive
Will be spliced and chopped in half
This meat grinding death machine
Has a soul, Meat grinding death machine
Disposal of aliens
So mankind can reign supreme
Meat grinding death machine
Depriving their intelligence that's
Beyond understanding
Bodies strapped down, guts hanging out
Conscience sustained while being dissected
Torture and suffering
Analyzing their anatomy
Their soul subsides
Treacherous perception
Deconstruct anatomy beyond our own
Underground confinement, sick asylums
Fit for a repugnant existence
Behold the sins of mankind
A world on the eve of self destruction
A world without peace denies existence
Eyes glistening with sorrow
Emotions are mortified
A reflection of life
Despised existence, unleashing vengeance
Kill Kill Kill Kill
Some pray for death, some wake up dead
Dead Dead Dead Dead
Sadistic evisceration
World of filth laid to waste
Vacant planet shall remain
Treacherous perception
Deconstruct anatomy beyond our own
Underground confinement, sick asylums
Fit for a repugnant existence
Behold the sins of mankind
A world on the eve of self destruction
A world without peace denies existence
Condemnation, ill confidence
Break down the walls of suffering
I cannot understand
How you seem to exist
Corruptive and empowered
Pile of rotting flesh and bone
