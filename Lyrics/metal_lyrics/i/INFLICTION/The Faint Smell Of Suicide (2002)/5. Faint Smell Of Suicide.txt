speed up
a spiral martyr will lead to your end

never to return
on these shores of despair

another murder becoming closer but perfect
cleanse me impure
I am the devil's advocate
in divine resignation
searching for freedom
a fraction of time
too late to be saved
the tool, the key, elevate to second floor
feel and feed
act of transfusion
this is the faint smell of suicide
dreams of lifeless passion
hidden in blackened chariots
entwined with lethe
but still eyes wide open
to be suspended in the side
did you ever hear me crying ?
