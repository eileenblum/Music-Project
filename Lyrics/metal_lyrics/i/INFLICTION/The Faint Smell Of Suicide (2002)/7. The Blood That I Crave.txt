the blood falls down from your face
the blood falls down from your eyes
your blood in my goblet
now I drink your blood, raping your soul
demonic beast wants your eyes
demonic beast wants your head
the blood is so warm and your empty veins . . .
your body is so cold
now I'll break your fucking head

here I am, this is the blood that I crave . . .
