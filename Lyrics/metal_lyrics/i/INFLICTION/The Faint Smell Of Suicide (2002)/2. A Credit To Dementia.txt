invisible oppression
no sensations nevermore
my frustration caused the sickness encircled abandoned
total dementia
shelter from thoughts we'll find in space
taste of brainwash as a foolproof fucking cage
and from behind, the need of being blind
abuse is my view in complexity of mind
somehow confined nonsense, my crude decision
absence of static visions
my rusted soul can't hide no more
I made this mess and now it's over . . .
after an entire life in sanity fill my soul, then let me die
dreadful shapes all around, darkened as macabre . . .
