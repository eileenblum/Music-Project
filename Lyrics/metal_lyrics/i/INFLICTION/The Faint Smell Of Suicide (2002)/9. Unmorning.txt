surrounded by fire
cold wind blows again tonight

to subdue the calm before the storm
walking the path

a painful reminiscence
I leave myself once again ...
emptiness, as I die, here for a while
here the life non longer guards
while vanities enslave my heart
forever loosing horizons
in silence everlast

suicide, as I leave mankind
it tortures my mind

in loving memory, suffocating utopia . . .
