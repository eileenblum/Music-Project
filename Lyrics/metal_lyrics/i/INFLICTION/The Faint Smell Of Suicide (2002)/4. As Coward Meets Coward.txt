useless words are the weapons of your convinction

molesting
infiltrating every perception
disciples of a world called insolence
memories corrode my soul though I meet you again
I'm alone with a neverending wrong
feel so much pain and endless amazement

nothing is real as the uncertainty I feel
thirsted I drink the poisoned rain
my sentence . . . after a life in perennial cowardice
thousands of painful dreaming elements
like symbols of post-humanity

collapsing like houses of cards
fall into a strange, unusual chasm
I hear your voice, your suffering
while shattered mirrors reflect my damnation
the distorted vision of denied purification
as coward meets coward
as coward meets me . . .
