The wind was feeling me, my skin and my senses
Trying to take care me, guiding through faces
Autumn leaves across my face, blinding me from where I'm going I could hardly move,

Carry me away, high above the naked trees
I want to fly, a night bird in the autumn sky

but I didn't want to

Carry me away, high above the naked trees
I want to fly, a night bird in the autumn sky

Carry me away, high above the...
Carry me away, high above the...
Carry me away, high above the...
