Wandering in another dimension
My thoughts are away
Why... These days of wander
Why... And I amaze

When all is remembered
And the rain starts it's fall
I'm lying here scattered
My thoughts starts it's crawl

My expressions turns to horror
Released from darkness and pain
Gone beyond tomorrow
I'll see you never again

When all is remembered
And the rain starts it's fall
I'm lying here scattered
My thoughts starts it's crawl
