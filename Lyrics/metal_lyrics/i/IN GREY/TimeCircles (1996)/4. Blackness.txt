I am leaving my dying body and the sleep is oh so beatiful

The journey fills me with blackness
Black roses marks my steps
My body is stained with blood

Sea of sadness, drown me
In remorse I sleep
On the shore of shadows
The loneliness grips me

I turn around and see all that I love
I hear they calling me
My soul longs for you
The song is filling me with pain

No, no I can't escape now

I turn around and see all that I love
I hear they calling me
My soul longs for you
The song is filling me with pain

So I leave this world
With the memories of all I love
And I turn and walk
In to the corridors of the past
