Swift winds can change it all
But never blow the tidings away
You think there's a way, no not even in dismay
I will change you in every way

Follow me, let me take you for a ride
A ride into something you've never seen before
It might make you shiver, it might make you tremble
But in the end you will beg for more

You thought you could run away
Or maybe try to stay the fucking same
But in the end you want me
And you know that you never can escape me

Follow me, let me take you for a ride
A ride into something you've never seen before
It might make you shiver, it might make you tremble
But in the end you will beg for more
