Crystallized and clear, so beautiful you lye
And you make me wish that you were I
We've shared times of joy, we've shared times pain
But with you I will share nothing again

In times of sadness, in times of pain
Why do we try to stay and remain the same
Tomorrows hand might stalk and hide
All that you think that you are missing tonight

Speeding through time and floating free
Tasting pleasures of sin and sight
But when I was with you my soul had eyes
Eyes to see what we could feel

In times of sadness, in times of pain
Why do we try to stay and remain the same
Tomorrows hand might stalk and hide
All that you think that you are missing tonight
