You left me for reasons I never did understand
But now...

I can see the sun, comming back to me
Even though she wears this mask
This just might be my chance
If not I'll be forever lost

I, I want you
And you, you want me
So let us come together, here and now
And please let me, wear you mask!

Put the sun in the sky
Light up my heart
And please let me
Let me wear you mask
