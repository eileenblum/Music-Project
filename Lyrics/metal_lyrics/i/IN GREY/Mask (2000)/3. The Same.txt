I still need you
When I'm in this pathetic state
But you would detest me even more
And I would burn even harder

I would burn
Burn away from you

Nothing good ever came from you
You only brought me down
Nothing good ever came from you
Will I ever be the same?

And I still need you here by my side
Now that I'm in this pathetic state
But you would detest me even more
And I would burn even harder...
