Promises and lies entwined like tears in the rain
The bittersweet taste of ruin as the dream crumbles
The hope of tomorrow are replaced with the wrath of today
Silent words are spoken softly as passion turns to hate

Here I lay as a mere shadow of what I used to be
I'm withering from within without a reason why
Before my eyes I see the light as I'm about to die
Unfold the veils of lies that clouded my sight through life

I plunge into the dephts of the great emptiness
As the autumn caress gently stole my last breath
The hope of tomorrow are replaced with the wrath of today
Silent words are spoken softly as passion turns to hate

Here I lay as a mere shadow of what I used to be
I'm withering from within without a reason why
Before my eyes I see the light as I'm about to die
Unfold the veils of lies that clouded my sight through life

Promises and lies entwined like tears in the rain
The bittersweet taste of ruin as the dream crumbles
The hope of tomorrow are replaced with the wrath of today
Silent words are spoken softly as passion turns to hate
Softly as passion turns to hate
Softly as passion turns to hate
