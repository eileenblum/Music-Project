Your suffering is over
Sleep in silence until we meet again
It came softly as a friend
Touched your hand and led you home

I cry for you - In Heaven
I long for you - In Heaven
I fall - In Heaven
I'm leaving you - In Heaven

So tired, alone I walk
My love falls with my tears
She comes for me, in a dress made of longing
She holds me, as I need her

I cry for you - In Heaven
I long for you - In Heaven
I fall - In Heaven
I'm leaving you - In Heaven

My eyes open, I look around
But I am alone
Until I meet her again
In Heaven...
