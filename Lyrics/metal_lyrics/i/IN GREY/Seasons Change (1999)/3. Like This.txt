A river of deceit runs through me
It's drowning me from the inside
What put me into this
I never meant to hurt you... like this

Why, hurt the ones we love
Twisting emotions the other way around
The spring of it all being envy
I never meant to hurt you... like this

Now I finally know
Which way things might go
And now I finally see that
I never meant to hurt you... like this
