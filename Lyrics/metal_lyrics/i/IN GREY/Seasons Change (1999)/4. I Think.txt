Pain, darkness, despair: My life weighs me down. When will I, a righteous man, see
the light that I think I so much deserve? What have I done to be punished this way?
When will my time come? Or will I forever wander in darkness:

Please god help me die!
Help me away from all in this world. 
Don't let me search for death like a lost fucking bird,
If you can't let me into the others happiness.
