As octobers leaves fall on me
I still miss the feeling of you
As this grey dusk embraces me
I Wish I was loosing it all

Standing in the rain
As the night comes down
This total emptiness
Is filling me

The emptiness of a loss
Can it be more definitive
But the seasons change
And so do I

Standing in the rain
As the night comes down
This total emptiness
Is filling me

The emptiness of a loss
Can it be more definitive
But the seasons change
And so do I
