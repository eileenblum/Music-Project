Don't you try to hide from me
Impure thoughts and false sympathy
How can you disguise what's on your mind
Can't you reveal what you hold inside

Destroyed your dreams live in silver tears
The skies fall on you

Your cries wont change your mind just leave you down
And no lies can change your mind
No matter what I told you
You just don't listen to me
Now everything's changed
Just make truces with yourself and the world and set yourself free

Thinking you're Jesus with a cross to bear
But the emptiest pool of truth could be filled with lies from you baby
Would you run for me as I ran for you? Now you need me?
Ever wondered why you're alone now baby?

I have no hope for you
