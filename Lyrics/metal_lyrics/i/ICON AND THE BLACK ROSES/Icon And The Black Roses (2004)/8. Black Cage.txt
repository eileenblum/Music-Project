Through these eyes the world gives me pain
Knowing the sadness all the lies and the gain that we share
Something my touch gives to your soul, I know you're here, it's not that you love me but of what you fear

Without me you're nothing
You're just one in a million

Wait everyday inside this black cage
Hope doesn't seam to fade away
Wait everyday inside this black cage
Hope doesn't seam to fade away
Wait everyday inside this black cage
Tomorrow brings the same again

I'm a mirror reflecting your soul
The way you like, the way you like to see it
It's not really there
As this little boy cries I cried as well
Strange complexity of torture and madness my awareness brings to me

As i try to reach you
I can grab only air

Wait everyday inside this black cage
Hope doesn't seam to fade away
Wait everyday inside this black cage
Hope doesn't seam to fade away
Wait everyday inside this black cage
I reach out for the end
