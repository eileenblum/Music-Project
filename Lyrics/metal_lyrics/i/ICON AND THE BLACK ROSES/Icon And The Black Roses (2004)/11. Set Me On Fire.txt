You break my heart and set me on fire
Louder than love

You are coming down like an angel without wings and tear me up with a silver edge blade and everywhere I turn, I see your face

And everywhere I go I fear you
And everywhere I turn I see your face, with despair

I try to one still you are one foot from my back
I speed the pace as I reach out for a grasp
You've got me cornored, I have nowhere to escape

You drive me like your car to your paradise
Can't face this hell you're alone
You drive me in the highway to your heart
I wont stay here you're alone and still no matter what you say
No matter what you say, you're alone
