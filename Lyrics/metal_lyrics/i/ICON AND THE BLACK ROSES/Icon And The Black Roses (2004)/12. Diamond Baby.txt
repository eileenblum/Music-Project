It's your favourite pleasure
When your love cuts me deep
Like a razor or a diamond, baby

Its late at night and I can't sleep
Feeling the entwined streams of silver tears
They are running down my cheek

And I've never known such pain like the one you give me all night long
You just can't get enough
You just can't get enough

You are wondering naked in my bed
And everytime I close my eyes you are in my dreams
I see you there, you're everywhere

And I've never known such pain like the one you give me all night long
You just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

All the way, all the way, like a razor
Come on and wash your hands on my blood baby
Come on, come on, you are my lady, come on
Just come and wash your hands on my blood baby
