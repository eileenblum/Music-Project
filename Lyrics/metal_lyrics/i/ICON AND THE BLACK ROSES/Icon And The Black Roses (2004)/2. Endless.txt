She cries with the devil on her hands, now baby
And she wipes her way with tears leaving me to see
That she wont spend her night in vain
Blood is the whisper of her pain

She says
Endless words with endless pain
In a painful world and painful fate
Are endless words with endless pain

She cried, but the devil was on her hands oh baby
And she wiped her way with tears leaving me to see
That she wouldn't spend her night in vain
I still hear her whispers everyday

"And I have lost so much
And she swears she has lost so much"

Everytime you're not here but I can touch your heart
When i look on the mirror I still can see you smile
Everytime you're not here but still I can touch your skin
I just follow the stream of tears to your heart
