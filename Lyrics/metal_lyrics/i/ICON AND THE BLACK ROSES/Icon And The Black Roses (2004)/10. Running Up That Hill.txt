"If I only could, I'd be running up that hill"
"If I only could, I'd be running up that hill"

It doesn't hurt me,
Do you wanna feel how it feels?
Wanna know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you wanna to hear about the deal that I'm making with God?
"It's you
It's you and me"

And if I only could,
Make a deal with God,
I'd get him to swap our places,
Be running up that road,
Be running up that hill,
Be running up that building
And if I only could.

You don't want to hurt me,
But see how deep the bullet lies,
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder,
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts..
There's so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me, and we both matter, don't we?
"It's you
It's you and me, I won't be unhappy"

And if I only could,
Make a deal with God,
I'd get him to swap our places,
Be running up that road,
Be running up that hill,
Be running up that building,
And if I only could, oh...

"It's you
It's you and me, I won't be unhappy"

"C'mon, baby, c'mon darling,
Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling,
Let's exchange this experience, oh..."

If I only could,
Make a deal with God,
I'd get him to swap our places,
Be running up that road,
Be running up that hill,
Be running up that hill..

And if I only could,
Make a deal with God,
And I'd get him to swap our places,
Be running up that road,
Be running up that hill,
With no problems..

And if I only could,
Make a deal with God,
And I'd get him to swap our places,
Be running up that road,
Be running up that hill,
Be running up that hill..

And if I only could,
I'd make a deal with God,
And I'd get him to swap our places,
Be running up that road,
Be running up that hill,
With no problems.
