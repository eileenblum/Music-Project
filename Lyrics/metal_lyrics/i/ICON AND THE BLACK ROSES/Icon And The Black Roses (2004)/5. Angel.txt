I love the way that you cry
When your crystal heart is torn apart
And my eyes eager to see

I love the look on your face
The fragile consciousness
The fact you need
The presence of myself, your only true friend

And all you were you gave it up
And your soul is filled with emptiness
And how will you try to get through the night again?

You?re gonna cry like an angel
And when your craving salvation
Just realised I?m your angel
You want me, you left me, you said no no no

I love the way that you turn down your own happiness
And your eyes eager to see another smile from my face
The fragile consequence, the fact you need
The presence of myself, your only true friend

And all we were you gave it up
And your soul is filled with emptiness
And how will you try to get through the night again?

Tears that you cried in vain
You wake always tired of this life that you live
You turned down your own happiness and embraced this fate
