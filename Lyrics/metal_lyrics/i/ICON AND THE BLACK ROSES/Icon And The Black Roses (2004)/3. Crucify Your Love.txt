He is feeling a little bit tired of all this disguises he wears to conceal the truth
But now he truly realizes the fully compromise he took hand in hand with him

Crawl down and take a fall
It's the fear of what?s to come
Maybe he doesn't know it

Sometimes you scream, sometimes you pray
Sometimes you pray, sometimes you feel like sorrow is your only choice my love
Sometimes you scream, sometimes you pray
Sometimes you pray, sometimes you feel like sorrow and pain crucified you love

There was this little child that used to crawl in the dark and still had fun
While he listened hours and hours to his midnight radio and his favourite rock n roll bands

So long he?s waited, he feels the wind blows him to his special fate
Hold on does he see?
Watch him does he believe, behind this walls there?s a whole world to take

And when you wake every morning breaks your heart
-sorrow and pain for you my love-
And when you wake every morning breaks your heart
-sorrow and pain for you my love-

My love, my love, my love
As the pain crucifies you love...
