Now you're awake
Are you please with your pain ?
And I'm watching, smiling
With hatred comes hatred and your lips now taste it my coldest kiss

And I'd bet my life on this

You are crying for help, you try to reach out for my hand but I wont be there,
'Cause I don't care and I'm leaving you to drown in tears

Recalled your fears, now they become tears, remember I once needed you
