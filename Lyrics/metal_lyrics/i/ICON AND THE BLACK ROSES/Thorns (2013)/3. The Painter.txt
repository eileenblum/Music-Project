Last time I let you go,
I didnât know we were supposed to be together.
Baby, you and me in this frame.

Maybe you were scared of me,
oh baby, I got carried away.
My art is dark, so beautiful in the end.

Why donât you run away?
Cause hide and seek is my favorite game.

I will find you, I will find you.
I will find you there to paint it red,
to paint your soul with blood.
I will find you, I will find you.
I will find you there to paint it red,
to paint your soul.

Chasing silhouettes deprived.
I feel the guilt but I feel alive.
Iâve drawn a thousand pictures of me and you.
I know that I cannot be loved,
I cannot change my tainted soul.
I never really wanted to at all.

Why donât you run away?
Cause hide and seek is my favorite game.

I will find you, I will find you.
I will find you there to paint it red,
to paint your soul with blood.
I will find you, I will find you.
I will find you there to paint it red,
to paint your soul.

You wonât just come running back to me.
Baby, you will crawl.
