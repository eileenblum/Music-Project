Shattered by rain,
shrouded by thoughts on a runaway train.
Seeking shelter from the storm and from the pain.
Another empty glass.
Another line, another friend,
yet no sight or track.
You canât find your way back.

And your flame grows colder
as the night is over.

Now youâre lost
for following your heart.
It guided you so far
and you donât know where you are,
cause, baby, now youâre lost.
You were following your heart.
It guided you so far
and you donât know where you are,
cause, baby, youâre lost.

Holding you head up high
but the mirror canât lie,
it shows tears in your eyes.
Sadness blurs your sight,
like ether numbs your mind.
If I only knew
what youâd get yourself into...
I wish I could.
Wish I was able to save you.

And your flame grows colder
as the night is over.

Now youâre lost
for following your heart.
It guided you so far
and you donât know where you are,
cause, baby, now youâre lost.
You were following your heart.
It guided you so far
and you donât know where you are,
cause, baby, youâre lost.

Open the door to a dream.
Ran the playground.
Found a maze.
You dared to enter,
took a deep breath.
We were friends holding hands.

Walk deeper into the green,
ignore the colors as they fade.
The world grows larger as you shrink.
You turn around and no oneâs there.

Baby, now you're lost.

You were following your heart.
It guided you so far
and you donât know where you are,
cause, baby, youâre lost.
You were following your heart.
It guided you so far
and you donât know where you are,
cause, baby, youâre lost.
