Close, so close to your chest.
I can hear you breathe
in your darkest hour.
Touch, I touched your face.
Your skin feels like silk,
now I canât turn back.

So I kissed your lips and you whispered
âNow itâs too lateâ
As cold as ice, as blind as your heart.
You think itâs broken,
too proud to let it show.
But if itâs broken why is it still beating?
Youâve cut through your veins,
youâve cut through your heart and soul.
Youâre feeling dead but your heart still beats.

Pain,
I see it in your eyes.
It canât be reached so deep inside.
I surrender, I just canât fight.
This battle is yours to survive.

So I kissed your lips and you whispered
âNow itâs too lateâ
As cold as ice, as blind as your heart.

You think itâs broken,
too proud to let it show.
But if itâs broken why is it still beating?
Youâve cut through your veins,
youâve cut through your heart and soul.
Youâre feeling dead but your heart still beats.

Cry, to kill your pride.
Live to see the sunrise.
Why donât you cry?
Leave your fears,
release your tears.
Donât say goodbye.

Donât let go of my hand,
let the sun light up your way.
Donât let the darkness drag you in.
Stay with me, my baby,
keep fighting, keep holding on.
Donât you give up and close your eyes,
donât say goodbye, my love.

Stay with me, donât leave me,
keep fighting, keep holding on.
Stay with me, donât tell me,
the silence is everything.

Keep holding on, keep holding on my love.
