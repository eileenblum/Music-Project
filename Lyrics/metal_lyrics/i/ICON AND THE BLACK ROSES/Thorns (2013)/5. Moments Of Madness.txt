Itâs just a brief moment of madness.
Itâs just the sweet taste of fragileness.
It has taken all we had,
chewed it up and spat it out.
It brought me to my knees,
Iâm giving up.

Donât call if you love me.
Donât speak if youâre week.
Donât reach if youâre eager to feel
what we might have been.
Donât say that itâs hurting.
Donât weep if you bleed.
Quit trusting your heart, baby,
or else youâll sink with me.

Itâs just another moment of weakness.
Just another lie.
And we have crossed the borderline.
We canât go any further,
weâre left with no choice but to let go.

Donât call if you love me.
Donât speak if youâre week.
Donât reach if youâre eager to feel
what we might have been.
Donât say that itâs hurting.
Donât weep if you bleed.
Quit trusting your heart, baby,
or else youâll sink with me.

Donât call, donât fall for me again.
Our passion has died out.
Donât speak, donât even say my name.
What we lost was never found.
There is no place for you and me anymore.
If we keep remembering the past we can never be free.

Donât call if you love me.
Donât speak if youâre week.
Donât reach if youâre eager to feel
what we might have been.
Donât say that itâs hurting.
Donât weep if you bleed.
Quit trusting your heart, baby,
or else youâll sink with me.
