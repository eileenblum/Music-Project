I open my chest filled with sorrow.
Leave time to heal the wounds in me.
And once I lock the door and throw away the key,
you come back to life to haunt me in my dreams.

Higher,
up to the skies and drop me in the fire
of your lies, are fuelling the pyre.
No regrets, no sorrows in your demise.
Cause the devilâs made you
for one night.

Close your eyes and wash the pain away.
And sail me in your ocean of infinity.
Tomorrow I will cry beside your bed and sigh.
A dying song a dirge for our last goodbye.

Higher,
up to the skies and drop me in the fire
of your lies, are fuelling the pyre.
No regrets, no sorrows in your demise.
Cause the devilâs made you
for one night.

Youâre born out of hell to bring me pleasure.
Youâre fond of seeing me this way,
in tragedy and madness.
Indulged in destroying my life.
Iâll nail you to a cross, babe, when we say goodbye.

You take me higher,
up to the skies and drop me in the fire
of your lies, are fuelling the pyre.
No regrets, no sorrows in your demise.
Cause the devilâs made you
for one night.
