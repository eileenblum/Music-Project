Innocence faded, drowned in a memory.
Silence is a step away from our suffering.
I hoped for better days to come but joy is not for us.
Our love tastes like doom.
Itâs cutting you through.

Donât cry.
Baby, donât cry, no more.
Donât cry.
Baby, donât cry, no more.
Donât cry.
My baby, donât cry, no more.
Donât miss me when Iâm gone.

In love weâve lost track of reality.
Young hearts, hearts beating strong in a melody.
But the damage was too deep, so deep it got to me.
Infected my mind.
Opened a fatal wound inside.

Donât cry.
Baby, donât cry, no more.
Donât cry.
Baby, donât cry, no more.
Donât cry.
My baby, donât cry, no more.
Donât miss me when Iâm gone

Innocence faded from you and me.
Virtue was taken when we were sixteen.
Blossom and withered.
Weâre just bodies without a soul or dream.

Donât miss me, donât cry anymore.
Donât miss me when Iâm gone.
