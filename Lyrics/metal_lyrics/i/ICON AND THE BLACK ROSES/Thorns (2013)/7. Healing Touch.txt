I was born with a healing touch.
I thought I could wipe those tears.
Turns out Iâm not as strong as I thought
or as worthy of what Iâve been given.

You were born a precious stone.
You were everything I needed,
but I was too afraid of letting you go.
No, I canât be without you.
This ainât what Iâve pictured.

Oh god, what have I done?
Iâve cut your wings, my angel.
I couldnât soar the same skies as you.
Oh no, itâs true, I wish that I could mend it.
No love can heal what I have broken.

This canât be undone, I left you incomplete.
A statue gazing back at me with such love
it could melt solid gold.
The more I made you feel, the higher you had to fall.
Please forgive me, I know what I did was wrong.
No, I couldnât live without you.
This ainât what Iâve pictured.

Oh god, what have I done?
Iâve cut your wings, my angel.
I couldnât soar the same skies as you.
Oh no, itâs true, I wish that I could mend it.
No love can heal what I have broken.

No love can heal what I have broken.
