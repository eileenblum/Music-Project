My world is ending,
swept away by fear,
just fading away.
The mask has dropped,
canât face who we betrayed.

Nothing but criminals,
thatâs how they will see us.
Thereâs too much at stake in here.
We got no choice but to cut our losses and leave.

And when the city is burning,
Tonight Iâm leaving.
Iâll leave with or without you.
And when the streets are crumbling down to ashes,
Iâll leave with or without you.
This town is burning.
Tonight Iâm leaving.
Iâll leave with or without you.
The streets are burning, burning, burning.
Iâll leave with or without you.
With or without you.

With you my world is ending.
This time Iâve got to leave.
There must be something better
than these wounds that we share
and pain that we give.

And I hope you forgive me,
itâs your choice to come or stay.
If weâre fighting for our lives weâd better run away.

And when the city is burning,
Tonight Iâm leaving.
Iâll leave with or without you.
And when the streets are crumbling down to ashes,
Iâll leave with or without you.
This town is burning.
Tonight Iâm leaving.
Iâll leave with or without you.
The streets are burning, burning, burning.
Iâll leave with or without you.
With or without you.

With you my world is ending.

And when the city is burning,
Tonight Iâm leaving.
Iâll leave with or without you.
And when the streets are crumbling down to ashes,
Iâll leave with or without you.
This town is burning.
Tonight Iâm leaving.
Iâll leave with or without you.
The streets are burning, burning, burning.
Iâll leave with or without you.
With or without you.

With you my world is ending.
