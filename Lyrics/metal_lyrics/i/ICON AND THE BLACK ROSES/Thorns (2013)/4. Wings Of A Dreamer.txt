Do you light a smile
when it hurts the most?
And why do you seem to thrive
on the angst you put me through?
With you thereâs no future, at least not for me.
You make me a different man, made me so much weaker.
All my childhood dreams will never be
destroyed by your ruthless mind.

I close my eyes and step into the endless fall
while you break, the wings of a dreamer.
Held onto your arms,
your arms while I was pushed into the endless fall.
I canât forget,
you staring back at me, killing me slowly.

Once you were so kind,
once you believed the future held the best for both of us
and I believed in you.
Somehow you lost those feelings, that made you different.
Something I couldnât fight,
not that I hadnât tried to I tried to bring you back to life from hell
and you came wielding a scythe.

This canât be you, who are you?

I close my eyes and step into the endless fall
while you break, the wings of a dreamer.
Held onto your arms,
your arms while I was pushed into the endless fall.
I canât forget,
you staring back at me, killing me slowly.

Kill me.
Donât inflict this pain in vain.
A desert lies where all hope was once.
A leafless tree too strong to fall on its own.
Finish what you have begun.
When all love inside has died like a river dried,
no longer runs love.

Tell me who, who will pray for us?
Cause tonight the angels fall
while you break the wings of a dreamer.
Held onto your arms,
my arms while you were sucked into the endless fall.
I canât forget,
you staring back at me, drowning slowly.
