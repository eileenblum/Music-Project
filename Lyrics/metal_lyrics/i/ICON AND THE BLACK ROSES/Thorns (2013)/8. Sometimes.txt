Sometimes life gets the best of me
but when I call, you come and find me...

These were the best days of my life
I am so proud to be beside you
cause all I need is here.
Hold my hand,
weâll watch this world fade away into the starts, my friend,
cause all I need is here.

Sometimes life isnât what it seems
and sometimes we fade away into our dreams.

As I grow old and the more I see,
words you said reflect in me.
As time goes by,
I see the good in you shine through me.
In a world so cold, you were my best friend
and I canât thank you enough for what you have done.
I hope it shows in the end.

These were the best days of my life
I am so proud to be beside you
cause all I need is here.
Hold my hand,
weâll watch this world fade away into the starts, my friend,
cause all I need is here.

Sometimes life isnât what it seems
and sometimes we fade away into our dreams.

You never walked away.
You stayed right here beside me.
You never walked away,
not even when I hurt you so much.

I am so proud to be beside you
cause all I need is here.
Hold my hand,
weâll watch this world fade away into the starts, my friend,
cause all I need is here.

These were the best days of my life...
