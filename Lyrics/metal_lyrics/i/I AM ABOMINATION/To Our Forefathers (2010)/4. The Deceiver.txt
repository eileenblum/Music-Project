For God so loved the world
Is such a fabricated one liner
Whether I am right or wrong
We are both going to end the same
End the same
I will crawl out of the water
And you will magically Part it
Walk right through it

If I'm a deceiver
Then may lightning strike me down
Down
Reach for the sky
There's nothing left here for you
But atmosphere

Darwin would envy me
Lord I've been saved and it wasn't by you
Can you fathom that?
Oh can you fathom that?
My emblem of choice walks on it's own two legs
But yours just simply preaches a name
And I believe that you've all been naturally selected
To be irrational and perpetual to still believe
Believe yeah

This is survival of the fittest
Where is your savior now?
This is divine intervention
Worship the savvy

If I'm a deceiver
Then may lightning strike me down
Down
Reach for the sky
There's nothing left here for you
But atmosphere

If I'm a deceiver
Then may lightning strike me down
Down
Reach for the sky
There's nothing left here for you
But atmosphere

If I'm a deceiver
Then may lightning strike me down
Down
Reach for the sky
There's nothing left here for you
But atmosphere
