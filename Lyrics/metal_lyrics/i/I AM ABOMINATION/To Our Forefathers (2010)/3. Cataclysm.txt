What makes us human?
Is it out ability to create or our ability to destroy?
To whom much is given, much is expected.

To trust the corrupt is to swallow the toxins.
We're scarred with sickening fables.

Please don't take the lives of every man with an idea.
Everything with meaning is smoldering.
Pleading to the dead will not save us.
Two billion people can be wrong.
This way of life is outdated.

We are the unarmed truth and we fight for the unconditional love, 
For the final word in reality and it makes you think.

We set the stage,
We pull the strings,
Yet, we're in a world left heartless.
We live alone,
We hold our ground,
Yet, we're in a room left artless.

Lets wrap our roots around a new beginning,
Because we're in need of a designer future, a holocaust of the norm.

Sobriety is needed upon the desolate.
The country's nose is bleeding as we take another hit.
Social stratification is becoming bottom heavy.
Stirring our minds with delirious allegories won't cure past mistakes.

We are the unarmed truth and we fight for the unconditional love,
For the final word in reality and it makes you think.

We set the stage,
We pull the strings,
Yet, we're in a world left heartless.
We live alone,
We hold our ground,
Yet, we're in a room left artless.

Lets wrap our roots around a new beginning,
Because we're in need of a designer future, a holocaust of the norm.
