To our forefathers with love

Thanks for tearing the world apart. 
Primitive minds are left terrified. 
Strife, confinement, and the pursuit of lucidness.

This is philosophy of the history of our nations being. 
Fabricated, yet it's only what the public sees. 
There is significance in every move that's made.

We live inside a living, 
Breathing juggernaut. 
His eye sees all.

If we are so free then why are our minds not meant to be. 
Don't believe thy majesty, they'll eat you alive.

He who controls the war controls our history. 
Reasons of this, they are shrouded in mystery. 
Evidence of schematics are hidden within the media. 
Feeding off of greed, we are the prey of the beast.

We the weak, we man the front lines. 
Swallow lead, make sure the beast is fed. 
We have resided within the comforts of ignorance. 
But, this time through it isn't bliss. 

We live inside a living, 
Breathing, juggernaut. 
His eye sees all.

If we are so free then why are our minds not meant to be. 
Don't believe thy majesty, they'll eat you alive.

I will not be marked and considered disposable. 
We live like batteries, giving life to another yet simply born to die.

If we are so free then why are our minds not meant to be. 
Don't believe thy majesty, they'll eat you alive.
