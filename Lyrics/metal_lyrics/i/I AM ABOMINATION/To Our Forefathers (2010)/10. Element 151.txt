Satellites are falling to the ground
The trusting don't make a sound
What are we here for?
There are lights in the sky
Brightly flashing in patterns

(Mr. Lazio was so right)

The horizon is filled with strobes of light
The auroras create a different night
Losing touch with our sense of fear
This is your vision of splendor, a loss of feel

This isn't human, I know this can't be human

The ulterior are here
The world is in an uproar
Oblivious to warnings
That are embroidered by the media

(Mr. Lazio was so right)

The horizon is filled with strobes of light
The auroras create a different night
Losing touch with our sense of fear
This is your vision of splendor, a loss of feel

This isn't human, I know this can't be human

Will they devour our world whole,
Or spit it out because of the wretched taste?

The horizon is filled with strobes of light
The auroras create a different night
Losing touch with our sense of fear
This is your vision of splendor, a loss of feel

The emotion arrived, disappears from what once was home
