The greatest illusionist of all time
This is the end of an era
What a god damned shame they became

Eyes glazed over and hysterical
Like a moth to a flame
They've died with a smile

When you fight for something you can't see
How can you believe?
How can you believe?
To not have a remaining organ
That has a beat
Has a beat

The indifferent tone of your voice
Let us be your ventriloquist
The beloved, the devoted
The never ending force of the choir

Is this really so controversial?
Don't be so hypocritical 
Hung by our necks, we're suspended in disbelief
We'll keep on swinging 'til judgement day

When you fight for something you can't see
How can you believe?
How can you believe?
To not have a remaining organ
That has a beat
Has a beat

The indifferent tone of your voice
Let us be your ventriloquist
The beloved, the devoted
The never ending force of the choir

In the eye of the illusionist
Oh, what a pretty picture you are
To lay down
In the eye of the illusionist
Oh, what a pretty picture you are
To lay down

The indifferent tone of your voice
Let us be your ventriloquist
The beloved, the devoted
The never ending force of the choir
