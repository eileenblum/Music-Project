[feat. David Stephens of We Came as Romans]You gave birth to a deaf generation
Visual talent is the new sensation
The trade in value of soul has dropped to all time low
Plastic molds are the new gold

You devour virtue and spit out our glamour
Faces have become vagrant pieces of abstract art

This is rare
This is candor
This is sound without optical slander
You can destroy my face before you rid me of my hands
Pry out my eyes and I'll be all ears

I won't be the surgeons new canvas
Nor will I be the producers new plan
This machine doesn't off of music
Vanity's a drug and they seem to abuse it

You devour virtue and spit out our glamour
Faces have become vagrant pieces of abstract art

[Dave from We Came As Romans:]
"You have killed rock-n-roll and buried it with the average mans aspiration
Never will I, never will I, trade myself to be the machines cranking gears
You have killed rock-n-roll and buried it with the average mans aspiration
Never will I, never will I, trade myself to be the machines cranking gears"

This is rare
This is candor
This is sound without optical slander
You can destroy my face before you rid me of my hands
Pry out my eyes and I'll be all ears

This is rare
This is candor
This is sound without optical slander
You can destroy my face before you rid me of my hands
Pry out my eyes and I'll be all ears
