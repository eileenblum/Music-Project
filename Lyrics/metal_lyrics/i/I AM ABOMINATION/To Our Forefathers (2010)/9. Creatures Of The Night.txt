These creatures travel through the night
Coming to your town, bearing ideas through melody
They are the voice of a million upon open minds
They hold true, until they die, so much they're blind

You can stop an army, but no barricade can stop an idea

But the power they're all leaving
Shall conquer the universe 
They have given it all up
Just for the rush of the voyage

Constantly in transit,
But never alone
A family, not through blood
It's something deeper in our bone

They're still versed in nature,
But warriors at heart
Their rapping, a choice
Ourselves wish for art

These vagrant souls are in no search of a home
The feed on friends and misery
In hopes of turning inside-out
Who we don't really need, do you feel me?
Creatures of the night

People fear these persuasive creatures
Hiding the risk of exposure
They travel for many miles,
To leave an impression

They are the carriers of the truth
And it's slowly spreading
They seem to be exactly
Just what everyone's been dreading

They're still versed in nature,
But warriors at heart
Their rapping, a choice
Ourselves wish for art

These vagrant souls are in no search of a home
The feed on friends and misery
In hopes of turning inside-out
Who we don't really need, do you feel me?
Creatures of the night
