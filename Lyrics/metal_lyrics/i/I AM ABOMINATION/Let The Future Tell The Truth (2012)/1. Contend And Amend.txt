Rightful heirs to rights unknown
Oblivious to the merit
The parchment unwoven
No fortification, no security
Premonitions from the predecessors predicting that our freedom would eventually be obsolete

What kind of man neglects his license to breath easy?
Ignorant fools place trust in the men disgracing sovereignty
When revolution is before us privileged will finally mean it's means
"U!"
You force feed fear to the naive
"S!"
Essential to the butcher, you fatten up the swine
"A"
A march from the stock yard
Defenseless, we'd walk the line

Crafted by creators of the land of the free
The artisans who fought for what was right
This is my right
There are many like it but this one is mine
To govern those who govern us
And I refuse to be the white flag waving at the end of the sights

Unconstitutional, you've left me with a reason.
Vindication in the form of powder, plot, and treason.
When revolution is before us, we'll take it by it's throat.

Crafted by creators of the land of the free
The artisans who fought for what was right
This is my right
There are many like it but this one is mine
To govern those who govern us
And I refuse to be the white flag waving at the end of the sights

Powder, plot, and treason left me with a reason.

Crafted by creators of the land of the free
The artisans who fought for what was right
This is my right
There are many like it but this one is mine
To govern those who govern us
And I refuse to be the white flag waving at the end of the sights
