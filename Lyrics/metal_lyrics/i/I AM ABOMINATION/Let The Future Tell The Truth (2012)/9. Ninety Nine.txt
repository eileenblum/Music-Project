Held down by the weight of absent coin
Confined by the absence of wealth
The muted feud each other to stay afloat
Conflicted with convictions to make the most
We're left to wonder if opportunity will outlast empathy
We're left to wonder if our economy will outlast prophecy

I've got a message for you
And its justified by the nine to five
We've got the message for you
And its justified by the ninety-nine
So tip the scale back our way
So we may know what it is to be heard
We've got the message for you
You can not deny the ninety-nine

Unlike the higher we'd lift the veil from the acquired
Forge the cowards from their desks
Now heed this warning before the stricken revolt

I've got a message for you
And its justified by the nine to five
We've got the message for you
And its justified by the ninety-nine
So tip the scale back our way
So we may know what it is to be heard
We've got the message for you
You can not deny the ninety-nine

When man's worth is reflective of his work the state will be revived
While the gluttons burn alive

Those who pay it forward are the ones who truly keep the world afloat

I've got a message for you
And its justified by the nine to five
We've got the message for you
And its justified by the ninety-nine
So tip the scale back our way
So we may know what it is to be heard
We've got the message for you
You can not deny the ninety-nine
