Astray from perspective
We can not grasp our own insignificance
Ignorant to aspect, we're existing only in our own image

And we're blind to the future
The third stone from fire, standing still
In light of all this mystery, at least we exist
So here lies our lunacy

Relative law, existing as we persist towards the remedy
Our presence and obscenity
Let me enlighten you all
Tuition reaches further than the truth
Beyond the absolute

And we're blind to the future
The third stone from fire, standing still
In light of all this mystery, at least we exist
So here lies our lunacy

Product of the middle English, we lead ourselves to believe that we've had hand in creation
Although meaningless, we give ourselves purpose to survive

We give ourselves a purpose to survive.

In light of all this mystery, at least we exist
So here lies our lunacy
