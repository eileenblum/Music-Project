Put on your cap and your boots
We're gonna build this city
These times are rough
But we're drawing it up
The skies are filling with our brilliance
Tearing away from all the clutches of poverty

Uneducated adolescent nation
Without reserve we start the purge
Economic collapse has just inspired the masses
To be creative not be destroyed

To follow through is to abolish the hunger and equal the upper
Not a single hand
Left unblistered in the end

Three cheers for the state of the state
We're higher than all
Not a muscle left untorn
Not a dollar left unborn

Inspiring static minds
Mechanizing powers yet defined
With a touch of innovation
We establish domination
Over all who wish to vie

Brilliant minds
Introduce the facile times
Not a worry in the world
The key to life
Washes up in the tides
Of electron exercise

To follow through is to abolish the hunger and equal the upper
Not a single hand
Left unblistered in the end

Three cheers for the state of the state
We're higher than all
Not a muscle left untorn
Not a dollar left unborn

This flag flies above the reinvented
Shadows cast as we tip our hats

What a beautiful way to live destroy
The old design and implement the new idea

To follow through is to abolish the hunger and equal the upper
Not a single hand
Left unblistered in the end

Three cheers for the state of the state
We're higher than all
Not a muscle left untorn
Not a dollar left unborn
