Apathy, a living oblivion engulfing the world in which we all call our home.
Hatred is bliss compared to the nothing that feels just like slaughter.
Passing by the man whom drowns in the water.
It's just the way we are.
We're taught to hault the helping hand.

From my knees I plead to anyone who'll listen.
Falling on deaf ears, the message lost, imprisoned.

The world can burn around us and we won't turn our heads.
Serenity in front of our faces, with feet made of lead.
Your arms are occupied by victims of your selfish desire.
The tower scrapes the sky.
Humanity is on fire.

Let them bleed.
They watch from the horizon.
Red tides crash into the dead.
Let them starve.
They feast at royal tables, gasping as they choke on our lead.

Watch from afar.
Lonely corpses are charred, and you close those fucking eyes.

From my knees I plead to anyone who'll listen.
Falling on deaf ears, the message lost, imprisoned.

The world can burn around us and we won't turn our heads.
Serenity in front of our faces, with feet made of lead.
Your arms are occupied by victims of your selfish desire.
The tower scrapes the sky.
Humanity is on fire.
