History's been told through aperture
The eye observes lie
The future in shades of black and white
Cast the shadows, dim the truth
No wasted film, no rehearsal

You'll never see the color of the truth
Intangible haze
Denial sinking teeth deep into the naive
Huston we've found the best solution
To the problem at hand
Lights, camera, action

Give me quiet on the set
And turn your focus to forgery
Fake the voyage young cadet
Remember your lines
It's "One small step for mankind"
Make them believe
Make them believe that we've won the race
We are the power, we set the pace
Don't close the hatch
Don't close the hatch

Caution to the crosshairs
The last thing we need is a skeptic
A cynic, a smoking gun
The race is underway but we've already won

Cast the shadows, dim the truth
No wasted film, no rehearsal
Shot down, gutted, and stuffed
A thirty billion dollar eagle's
Landed amongst white sand
America snorts up the dust
That the capsules kicking up
It buries the rotten bird

Give me quiet on the set
And turn your focus to forgery
Fake the voyage young cadet
Remember your lines
It's "One small step for mankind"
Make them believe
Make them believe that we've won the race
We are the power, we set the pace
Don't close the hatch

We'll shoot
We'll shoot the moon

Transcend the futile task
Diluted reality

Give me quiet on the set
And turn your focus to forgery
Fake the voyage young cadet
Remember your lines
It's "One small step for mankind"
Make them believe
Make them believe that we've won the race
We are the power, we set the pace
Don't close the hatch
Don't close the hatch
