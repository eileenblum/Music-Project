Word is not bond. Not a handshake proven true.
Lured to the table with the promise of prosper, I bought in.
They say that you hold what it takes. That say that you have it.
Flashing the world in your face. They want you to reach out and grab it all.
A pen in our hands, Our backs against the wall.

We are the product.
We are the work horse.
Simply the copies of copies filed with no remorse.

They'll rip the promise from the pages.
Don't sign your life away.
Take me back to the day when I could easily say that persistance and devotion would pave my way.
Oppressor, enforcer, how could you?
Your machine is fueled by all our youth.
So go ahead and sell 'em somethin' to gaze upon.
I'm not done, So fuck you I'm hangin' on.

Blatant perjury, despite what they told me.
Shame on me for being young and naive.
Shame on you for taking advantage of me.
Well how can the Fight be considered a Good one if both the opponents just lose in the long run.
Lose it all.
A pen in your hand.Your back against the wall.

We are the product.
We are the work horse.
Simply the copies of copies filed with no remorse.

They'll rip the promise from the pages.
Don't sign your life away.
Take me back to the day when I could easily say that persistance and devotion would pave my way.
Oppressor, enforcer, how could you?
Your machine is fueled by all our youth.
So go ahead and sell 'em somethin' to gaze upon.
I'm not done, So fuck you I'm hangin' on.

Sign right here for success.
Don't forget to cross your T's and dot your I's.
Relinquish your rights.

How does one see with eyes so green?
This illusion of partnership dictates a dismal reality.

They'll rip the promise from the pages.
Don't sign your life away.
Take me back to the day when I could easily say that persistance and devotion would pave my way.
Oppressor, enforcer, how could you?
Your machine is fueled by all our youth.
So go ahead and sell 'em something to gaze upon.
It's all you're depending on.
