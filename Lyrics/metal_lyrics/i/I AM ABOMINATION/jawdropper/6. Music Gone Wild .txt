Yes, we are here to impress. 
We're trying to bring the life back to the party. 
An epidemic is spreading across country. 
We seem to think that we are the cure. 

Fire doesn't cleanse it blackens. 
Liars don't ever think this happens.
So we fight fire with fire. 
We are a preaching choir. 
Four turns to the right 
and you're back to where you started. 
That's why we never strike the same place twice. 

Just watch the tapes and follow these easy steps. 
We like to call this the dance fever. 
This is a sick addiction. 
Just a twist and a turn away from total euphoria. 
You're almost done now.

Catch us if you can. 
We're the only medication to can bring the smile 
from your necks back onto your faces. 
We are the miracle drug. 
Rejuvenation never came in such flashy colors. 

Fire doesn't cleanse it blackens. 
Liars don't ever think this happens.
So we fight fire with fire. 
We are a preaching choir. 
Four turns to the right 
and you're back to where you started. 
That's why we never strike the same place twice.

This plague means nothing to us. 
We'll fight through all seven of these.
