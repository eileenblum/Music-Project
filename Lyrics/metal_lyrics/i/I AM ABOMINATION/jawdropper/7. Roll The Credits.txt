Ladies and Gentleman this is our swan song. 
It's our way of telling you we told you so. 
And it feels so good to be right again. 
We brought forth our gods and flaunted them like gold plated children. 
Watch as the sky makes it's way towards you. 
You can dodge the impact but the aftermath still finds you.

This is when death became like cocaine. 
Breath in with your mouth closed. 
Destruction is creation of a more distraught image. 
The suits and ties have recommenced everything back to zero.

As the skin peels back we will realize the beauty that we have destroyed. 
The outside will only seem as monstrous as the ideas that we have manifested.
This is when death became like cocaine. Breath in with your mouth closed. 
Destruction is creation of a more distraught image. 
The suits and ties have recommenced everything back to zero.

Who would have thought that the cockroach would get the last laugh. 
Who would have though that the saviour would never come back.

Death became like cocaine. Breath in with your mouth closed. 
Destruction is creation of a more distraught image. 
The suits and ties have recommenced everything back to zero.
