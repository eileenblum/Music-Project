Off with her head you say? 
God can't save the queen this time. 
We have a full house on our hands 
and they're all chanting mutiny. 
In this kingdom you are considered archaic. 
There's not a cloud in the sky above our parade. 

The anatomy has dissolved but the spirit stays put. 
Life like a cigarette. 
Your ashes will float to the ground with elegance. 
The count down is coming. 

We are rewriting history. 
Come hell or high water, 
nothing will stop this celebration. 
Burn the monument to the ground. 
Can't you see that you're not welcomed here. 

Someone has gotta change and its not gonna be us. 
Drink from this grail I promise you it's holy. 
The count down is here! 3..2..1..Evolution! 

We are rewriting history. 
Come hell or high water, 
nothing will stop this celebration. 
Burn the monument to the ground. 
Can't you see that you're not welcomed here.
