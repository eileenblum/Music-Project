There's plenty of room in hell,
but you all deserve worse
The dead won't even walk on this wretched Earth
Skinned alive, hung out to dry, the salt pressed in before you die

This is eternal judgement
The day of the lord has began
The fear in their eyes was ideal as I preformed the scan

All I need is the word,
To start the show, to end the world you know
This invasion was planned millions of years ago
This is the end of your last rope

The oceans will flood the land at last
The sky will be on fire with toxic gas
Structures will crumble, the ground will quake
The pain you'll feel is worse than mine at the stake

This is eternal judgement
The day of the lord has began
The fear in their eyes was ideal as I preformed the scan

All I need is the word,
To start the show, to end the world you know
This invasion was planned millions of years ago
This is the end of your last rope

Nobody, nobody will survive
For they were not all pure
No more hope, no hope for your lives
Your home will be our source
