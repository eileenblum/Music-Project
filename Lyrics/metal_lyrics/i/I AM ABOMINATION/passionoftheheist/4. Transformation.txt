My eyes are open, and I have risen from the dead;
I'm no longer human.
And I can feel the infection spread

My former body is bitter, broken, and gone.
Now I hover with disease of feelings withdrawn.
This story started with my dissection;
And now it's ending with my resurrection.

I died the death for all
I've suffered pain that no man could ever endure
I was a sacrificial lamb, diseased and a king
And from the castle in the sky illusion sings
Whoa, judgment to everyone
We'll deal with all the child's force
No one forgets his face,
He's coming home to his birthplace

This here embodies as we hold so well
I have no restrictions or strings to keep me held
My former home was a prison and held me back
This is what freedom is, what dreams are made of

My former body is bitter broken and gone
Now I hover with disease of feelings withdrawn
This story started with my dissection
and now it's ending with my resurrection

I died the death for all
I've suffered pain that no man could ever endure
I was a sacrificial lamb, diseased and a king
And from the castle in the sky illusion sings
Whoa, judgment to everyone
Well deal with all the child's force
No one forgets his face,
He's coming home to his birthplace

And I have already chosen to rid of the filth
Now I must spread my wings and return to my throne

I died the death for all
I've suffered pain that no man could ever endure
I was a sacrificial lamb, diseased and a king
And from the castle in the sky illusion sings
Whoa, judgment to everyone
Well deal with all the child's force
No one forgets his face
He's coming home to his birthplace
