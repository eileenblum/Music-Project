[Featuring Caleb Shomo]Here I float, through the last frontier
This is my voyage to the heavens
Oh velocity will turn the stars into idle eyes
Help my [?] king of the skies

We have to build again,
start over from the beginning
Failure, and project warfare
Failure, Oh whoa
Now is the time to open up the nest of the hive
Until my rebirth, I never knew what it was to be alive
The drones and I will return to the palace in the sky
I'll never know what it is to die, oh whoa
This ship will climb through the clouds,
we'll crack the atmosphere that lies ahead

Holy gates, open up and let me in
My author's handing me the pen (and it needs an end)
These stripes are writing, theirs boil
they need to be destroyed
Pull them up from the roots

We have to build again,
start over from the beginning
Failure, and project warfare
Failure, Oh whoa
Now is the time to open up the nest of the hive
until my rebirth, I never knew what it was to be alive
The drones and I will return to the palace in the sky
I'll never know what it is to die, oh whoa
This ship will climb through the clouds,
we'll crack the atmosphere that lies ahead

The reckoning is coming
And it's women shall pay
The reckoning is coming
And the king will rise
The reckoning is coming
I will devour the sky
The reckoning is coming
and earth will be it's eye

Now is the time to open up the nest of the hive
until my rebirth, I never knew what it was to be alive
The drones and I will return to the palace in the sky
I'll never know what it is to die, oh whoa
This ship will climb through the clouds,
we'll crack the atmosphere that lies ahead
