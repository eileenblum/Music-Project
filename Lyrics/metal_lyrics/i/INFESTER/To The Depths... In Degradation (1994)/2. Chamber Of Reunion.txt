Room of reunion... Join with the departed,
Souls trapped in a timeless sanctuary of darkness.
... Witness the secret places which shall not be precieved by man.
Talisman strung in remebrance of the dead,
Resurrect visions kept in capsules of existence.
Perception enhanced by smoke and hypnosis,
Subconcious prayers for entreaty.
... Come to call, reappear in form!
Transcending through the boundaries of ancient knowledge.
... Notice the trancient beings
Which thrive on your fear,
Their meager existence I have already experienced
... Moving closer to the core,
I engulf in luminescence,
Aquired from this cerulean consumption,
The resting place of emptiness...
Where blackness robs the spirit
Chamber of reunion
... I may not return to this chamber.
From the blood, we are born of sadness...
But thy celestial spirits are breathed into me,
So I may never know.
