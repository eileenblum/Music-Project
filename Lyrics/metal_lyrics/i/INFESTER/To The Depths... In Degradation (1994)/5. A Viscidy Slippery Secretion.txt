A devious affliction of pain...
Mutilated beyond belief, no hope for resurrection.
There shall be no polluting of blood, our enemies are low animals.
Program to burn their offspring,
Lapadation to turn them away
... When the cross begins to burn,
Remove the cerecloth...
Reveal to all the soulless carcass,
His body was his cage.
Scraping off the rancid crust... Mortalized face and skin,
That which will never fucking die.

Cold sweat and fear sets in...
This scalpel that I grasp in fear,
Acidic compounds injested by mouth...
Self infliction is my intention.
