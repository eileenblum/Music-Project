I caress your head, my child...
Sweet cranium surprise,
Soon we'll feast on the grey matter.

Await the chants, Mephitis arises!
... When I spread your flesh,
And it reveals the insides
I rise to the heathens with joy,
My son, life.

New I'll take you to the breeding place
Be commanded by the primervial forces

,,, Swollen infant encased in the dirt,
To be the coffin of for your remains.
The gaseous hell is exposed from the core,
To rise the altar for damn's creatures...

... Waiting for the moment of chaos
When the ritual is to begin
-Exhumation, discover what swims in the soil...
It is that which dwells in remembrance...

... Interwined with the shadows, an end too complex.
Flesh and jasmine will flavor the air of night
A brisk energy of death... Power to reform life...
As a being of the twilight...
Transplanting windows to the afterlife.

Creep through the dark, through the fog to find
Our sacred ground, Where energy is received
-A band of souls transports onward to destinations
Now unknown... drained of sorrow...
Proceed to feast lost in cosmos...
Insignificance of perception disturbed,
Await the chants, Mephitis arise!
