Scarred, senile minds
Insane from the wait for death
As we watch them die
We can only laugh...
Crawling with a seizure
On the puke drink your own piss
How savoring are feces
When your head's in the toilet seat.
No medications can control the old
Gang green formation
A sick brain unfolding
Clouding of consciousness
Virtually rotting humans
Sadly roam the pensions
Morbid feeling up your spine
The smell of death will hunt you
They should be put out of their misery
Hellbound they shall suffer in reality
They should be thrown on a stinky pile
They must die.
