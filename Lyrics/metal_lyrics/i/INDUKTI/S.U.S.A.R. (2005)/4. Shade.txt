Cold mists, burning fire on my face
Written names in the sky, I read my fate
Red eyes, hear them calling out my name
You'll never taste the bliss of the chase

The world is black and white I'm running with my shade
Crying out, howling out to find the place

I truly understand
Truly understand

As I ran lust vanished from my head
Conscious mind woke up for a while and said
"You can,
There's nothing I can do
But if I know enough to turn your fate
I will try"
But the hunger still prevails and now
Ravening, slavering I bare my fangs

I truly understand
Truly understand
