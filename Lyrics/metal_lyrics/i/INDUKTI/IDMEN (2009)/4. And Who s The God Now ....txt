It's a sin...
It's a sin...not mine
Why...
I'm so weak,
I'm so naked...why...
The blood in my eyes

The pristine memory:
I'm touching tree of life
The oldest whisper:
Take an axe and use your mind

You may be as he is,
You're stronger than you think
You can do everything you need
Believe
I! I! I!
Now you'll be new creation
Forever

My brother's blood
Cries from the ground
What have you done
My brother's blood

You may be as he is
You're stronger than you think
You can do everything you need
Believe
I! I! I!
Now you'll be new creation
Forever

Days have become dreadful and fierce
I can see fear and distrust in her eyes
I keep quiet, I choose solitude
I pretend it's my way
I pretend I'm not lost
I am the law, I am the lie.
I am the love, the reason to cry
I am the good, I am the cure
Finally I'm the judge for my brother
Bright gates behind me, I stay in the ashes
It's doesn't matter - there's no return
My fate is here
My destiny is here
I'm passing away

Ye shall not surely die...
...your eyes shall be opened
And ye shall be as gods
Knowing good and evil...
Skin for skin
All that you have
You'll give for your life,
You'll betray your family,
Sell jewels and goods and...everything

From going to and from in the earth
And from walking up and down in it
I took an axe and fell the tree
There's no garden-the desert remains
I was to be...
To rule this reality
Come and hold my hands
Come and hold my hands, help me
Voice was selling lies and I bought
And now...
You may be only a human,
But you are stronger than you think,
You can do everything all you need
Believe
I! I! I!
Now you'll be new creation
Forever

Have new white stone
With new name written
