[Music: Acerbus, Lyrics: Acerbus &amp; TotalScorn]

We are death squadron
We are the living dead
We march the earth laughing
In your face, Fuck you!
You are the problem
We're the fucking solution

We'll cleanse your cities to ruin
We'll purge your filth
We break straight through
Mediocre laws you built

A truth so razor-sharp
You will fall in rank or try and hide
Armageddon's motherfucking looming
In your Christian nature to fucking die

So greet death legion
Great end times
We're the revelation
Unto all fucking nations

War of potence, war of blood

A truth so razor-sharp
So much more than a fucking song

Beyond the curtains of the blind
and not far away
Prepare yourself for Armageddon
