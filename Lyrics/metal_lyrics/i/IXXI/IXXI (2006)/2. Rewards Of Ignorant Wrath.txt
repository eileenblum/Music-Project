[music: Nattdal, lyrics: TotalScorn]

Zimmering fire and brimstone
Physical surging force
Beating sterile worldly odds
Glory on the course!

Merge fundamental desires
Toward future supremacy

Indeed an intrepid frontline
Resistance of hidden might
A dead man's quest to make it worthwhile
No better prospects for this night

The only peace I ever found
was everlasting fucking war...

Accomplishment they'll never quell
We're their fucking death-knell

A heaven void of substance
And no such thing as hell

Tossing beings like darts
In the heart of a decadent ghoul-empire
Nothing but a prelude...
It will be set afire

Rivetting bloodlusting all real
Constraint of a better steel
A time to control the All
And be what one can feel
