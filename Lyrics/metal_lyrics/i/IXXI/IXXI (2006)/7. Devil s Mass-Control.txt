[Music: Acerbus, Lyrics: Totalscorn]

Damnation is honor
Damnation is pride
Damnation the ultimate superiority-ride
Damnation is force
Damnation is key
Eternal source of every spirit free
Damnation is beauty from top to core
Damned souls to win every war
Hellfire, all admired, pristine fucking true
It's still a world that has no clue
Beyond lore, exterminating war

Shifting structures
Desperate empire
Never truly prepared for
The ancient ones
Revelling in this
Failing mass-control
Legislating the rule
Of righteousness
