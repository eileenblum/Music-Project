[music &amp; lyrics: Nattdal]

In nothingness everything is to be found

In everything no good is to come across

Except small pieces to use for finding
Something outrageous inside of me,
to awaken

Each day, I am dragged deeper down
I was born with an ambition to explore

Investigate the most horrific feelings of life
To in the aftermath be left with no emotions at all

The outcome of this, for what I believe
It will one day be worth it all

I was placed here for a splendid reason
I have always spread a disease
A diseased method of punishment
