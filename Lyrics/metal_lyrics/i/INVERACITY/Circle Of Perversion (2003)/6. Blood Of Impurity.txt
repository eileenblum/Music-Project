I indulge in this delusion
Incinerate demented memories
You're destined to suffer manipulation
Knowing tomorrow it all starts again

Disrespect
Subject to my ways of abuse
This blood of impurity that we share
No repent upon my sinful act
Incest my way to be purified

I indulge in this delusion
Infatuation has become delight
Destined to suffer manipulation
Making me last as I go deep inside

Disrespect
You've endured all these years of sin
Now I can see
How I've shredded your dreams for life

Turned to a lifeless object of desire
I erase all life from your ravished body
In order to be mine
