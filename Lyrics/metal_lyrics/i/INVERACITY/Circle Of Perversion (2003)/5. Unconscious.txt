She looks so innocent
Now that she fades
I will conquer this body

Motionless body lying
Naked - Before me
I awaited this for so long
My sleeping beauty
Violently penetrated
Sexually abusing
The unconscious

Lying defenseless
Just one more whore to be victimized
Body stands still
She is unable to feel what I am feeling

Awaken from the slumber
You see the scars I left
A fantasy come true
It was even better
Than normal intercourse
You were unable to react

Kidnapped, then drugged, raped
Never to recover
What a gruesome fate you've met
I could not resist
Traumatized, humiliated
By this misfortune
Treated like trash, no respect
