Blood flows down your legs
Deflowered with cruelty

You are not a virgin, not anymore
Tenderness was all you asked for

No feeling, only hate

Instead of love, I gave you disgrace
Another form of rape

Your suffering feeding my lust
You shed a tear as I cum

Treated like a bitch
Your virginity means nothing to me
