Let me purify you from the filth of flesh
You are not like the others
They are whores
Now my little beauty
Feed my fucking thirst
Trust your father that loves you

I caress you and you cry
Unconstrained erection with your tender flesh
I penetrate and you bleed
Pedophilia

I raped your innocence with filth
You lie unconscious, I have no guilt

Don't loathe me
