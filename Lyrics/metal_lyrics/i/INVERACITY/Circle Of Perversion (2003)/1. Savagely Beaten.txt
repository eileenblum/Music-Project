My eyes draw your back
This pretty face will bleed
But I love you I want to feel your pulse
I grab you and you freeze
Your fear reaches its limits
You beg me to release you
But I get more berserk

You little blondie slut
With innocent blue eyes
I smash your pretty teeth
I punch you till you bleed
Resistance wont save you
I fucking hate you

My elbow breaks your nose
My knee dislocates your jaw
My kick will crush your spine
I own you, you're mine

Now that you're defiled
You're lying before me
Now I'm your god
Accept your inferiority

I smashed all your dreams
And I took your last breath away
I gave you my love
But now you're dead
