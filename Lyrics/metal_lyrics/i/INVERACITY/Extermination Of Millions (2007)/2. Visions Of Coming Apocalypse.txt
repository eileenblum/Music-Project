Ignorant servants of a high power
Inhabitants of a decaying land
This world raped itself, a world misfortuned
A wasteland filled with lifeless remains
Your so-called evolution, is nothing but a lie
The world you create is internally decomposing
Visions of coming apocalypse
Driven by constant greed for wealth
Feeding on helpless humans
The fools are heading to their extinction
Disposal of the weak
Piles of dead bodies as the impure reign goes on and on
