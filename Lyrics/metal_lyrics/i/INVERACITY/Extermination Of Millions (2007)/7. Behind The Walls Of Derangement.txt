Hell behind bars
Suffocate, struggling to survive
A stinking pit of total despair
The light of day never to be seen again
Screams that go unheard
Once you cross these walls
It's the point of no return
Gates close behind you
Staring through iron bars
Man is one with animals in this hellhole
Beasts, ready to devour
A place packed with human waste
Convicted for rape, theft, murder
And any other kind of illegal act
The scars of imprisonment will never heal
Brutalized
