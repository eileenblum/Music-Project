Soon comes that time when everything will turn in nothingness
The uncreation of all will establish what was meant to be
The hour of perdition draws near but will be unpredictable
And it will lead the earth to return it's primal condition
Back to an era where no life dwelled
And every form of any existence was truly feeble
Humanity will suffer the consequence of it's ignorance
And constantly growing greed, misled into sin
The end isn't yet to come
Before this world of disorder falls by itself
Too late for repents of any kind, our final time has come
The earth will collapse just the same way it once was created
And then there's a blaze of fire, the ground opens to devour
And nothing left to show life in this goddamn place ever-existed
