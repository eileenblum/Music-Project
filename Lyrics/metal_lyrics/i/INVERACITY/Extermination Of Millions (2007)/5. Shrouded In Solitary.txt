Non existing reason, there is no one
In my domination I envision
Eternal solitary
All life erased by sheer hatred
Human existence burnt to ashes
Strong delusion of a diminishing world
Non alive but still i envision immortality
Non existing reason, there is no one
In my dominion I envision
Eternal solitary
No signs of life all erased by hatred
Human existence burnt to ashes
A vast necrotic field is all that surrounds me
The only witness of a world in misery
