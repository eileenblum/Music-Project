Depreciation of your existence
I will deteriorate your insolent life
Soon you will have a corrosive liquid to die with
I'm getting stronger - don't even resist
The lust for punishment lives on
Now i prepare to loath you more
Sliding in with ease
You 're twitching, you've lost control
As i pound my fists on you
The pain is unbearable, I'm unrelenting
Staying inside 'till the whole body is infected
With the disease I carry for years now
