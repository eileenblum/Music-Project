I crave extermination of countless million human trash
I will be convinced if i only watch them lay down dead
It's time for all to see my unstoppable delirium of murder
Nothing but my only way to be set free
I live just to see to fulfill my desire
Extermination - scum of the earth
Extermination- genocide
Fucked up - this hallucination becomes a reality I'd never believe
Obliteration of the human kind
Inferior than worms or leeches
Ignorant bastards their days meet the end
I am fed up with their idiocy
I define who's worth of living
Masses compelled in my own conceit
Mindlessly waiting for their final destruction
I abuse the right that me on my won gave to myself
I am delegated
My mission completed and as i stand
I breath the air of salvation
Humanity is extinct
I laugh as I'm supremacy
I breathe just to see to fulfill my desire
Extermination - the Earth becomes a burial place
I am perfection
