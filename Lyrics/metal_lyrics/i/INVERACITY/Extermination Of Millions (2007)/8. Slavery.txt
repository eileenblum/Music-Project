Bound to the blackest of futures
The human race is dependable of higher powers
No way or hope to get through
Strings pulled at random will
Abstract fear of extinction yet so obvious
Condemned to forever serve
Slavery
Ageless treat to all eternity human treachery
Blessed are the ones never brought to life to join mankind
None to decline their inferior state of mortal substance
Predetermined failure ceases the thought of life
Embodying submission
Indicating the secrets of subsistence
Seeking after what ages hide beneath
Recurring servants of sightless upmost forces
To ensure the blindness of living continuum
