Out of control we are running blind
No one knows the real world
Death stand next to us all
Someday you gonna pay the price

People beleave in paradise
Canât you see through their deny
Of endless day og devils hate
Kneel down and do so
For the wold you doesnât know
Now you tastes the real world
The madness waits for you

Nothing is waiting for you
Only darkness and pain
Blood and hate is coming your way
For Shure youâll die with shame

Out of control weâre running blind
No knows the real world
Death stand next to us all
So pray coz you are running blind

Nothing is waiting for you
Only darkness and pain
Blood and hate is coming your way
For Shure youâll die with shame
