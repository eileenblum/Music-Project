I wear the face of pain
Iâll put your soul in chains
Posses the only key 
I will never set you free
I wipe out your essence
Destroy your presence
You are consumed by fear
You are sheding your every tear 

Be wise and flee
Then you will not meet me
Iâll take your soul to keep
My terror will make you weep
The time is short
Your in my court
Its not an illusion
Await your execution

Iâm the one who makes
Iâm the one who takes
Worse than the reaper
I'm the soulkeeper

Your soul is rotten
Youâll soon be forgotten
Youâll die at my feet
I will burn your meat 
Iâll take you to hell
Become an empty shell
You cannot run
I am the one, the one 

I am the one who makes
I am the one who takes
Worse than the reaper
I'm the soulkeeper
