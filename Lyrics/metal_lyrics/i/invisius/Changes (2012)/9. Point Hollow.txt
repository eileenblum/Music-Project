Once again I find myself with you
And I can't tell if these feelings are true
This love is not felt but it is forced
To be a replacement for what I've lost

Fill the vacuum space inside of me

When I see your face
You take my breath away
I've learned that you cannot replace
What has forever been erased

Searching myself for reasons to stay
I find nothing but I'm desperate to feel again

For the last time I find myself with you
Now I can tell, these feelings are not true
I'm moving on, letting go of your hand
To keep on searching, digging in the sand
