I count the days since you walked away
But nothing seems equal to me
Since that day nothings's been the same
But now I see it's time for a change

And even though it seems so wrong
I have to rise and overcome

Now I can't feel you anymore
I'm buried underground
I know things won't be like before
But help me now and dig me out

Oh how I wish that you could be along
But you're alone and where you belong
I'll find a way, a way to carry on
Walk my own path and find my new home

Still I count days since you walked away
But I feel dead, nothing touches me
I know that things won't ever be the same
So now I know it's time for a change

Pick up the pieces that you left broken
But these words won't remain unspoken
Cause I can't feel you

All I wanted was to have you along
But you're alone and where you belong
I've found a home, a place where I'll grow strong
But I won't forget the times when two were one
