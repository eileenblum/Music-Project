You gave me everything I was longing for
Your breathtaking smile made me soar
But you burned all we had and put us on hold

And it's break that made me hit my all time low
I couldn't wake, I couldn't move, I couldn't grow

You are in my heart
And you'll be there forever
And if it won't work out
Let's fall apart together

And after years apart we reconcile for one single night
Make me an everlasting memory
Like a snapshot of this moment with all of my emotions

The taste of your lips
The smell of your hair
The look in your eyes
Your voice in my ear

But it's no longer you and I
Guess you think we've had our time
