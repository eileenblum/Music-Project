I know who you are
But never felt your touch
Tearing down your victims
But they can't get enough

You're hunting them down
Blinding their eyes
Squeezing their souls
They're losing the fight

You make them shake
Bend and break

She's bringing sweat and sleepless nights
Her kiss, a stain on their souls for life
With you people are not themselves
With you they are someone else

You bring them to their knees
With your wonderful kiss
Her smell, the endless temptation
Her rush, the path to addiction

That's why we'll never be together
Without you I am only better

And still I wonder what you could do to me
But I'm to wise so you and I will never be
