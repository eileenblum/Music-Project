Listen to the words I scream to your face
You're lost in a maze
And to get out you have to walk new ways
Your have to plant new seed
To reach your goals, to succeed

You're in distress
Reef your sails
Take control
Get back on course

Your crew need a reason to stay on board
Let me be a beacon to get you into port

You're lost in a maze
You have to walk new ways

Come follow my lead
And I'll promise to get you out in time
To plant new seed
The woods are dying, let that be a sign

Come follow my lead
And I'll promise to get you out in time
You're in distress
The woods are dying, let that be a sign

If we don't stand together, we don't stand at all
