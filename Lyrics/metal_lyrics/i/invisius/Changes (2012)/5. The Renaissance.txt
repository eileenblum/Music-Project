I better redefine myself
And learn how to live again
Cause when the storm is gone
I see that this is not the end

The waves were strong
But it has cleansed my men
Someday we'll realize
We came out stronger in the end

Life will lift you up, life will bring you down
Swallow the pain, hang in and stay around
Someday again the sun will shine on you
So raise your head cause we will make it through

We shall all overcome
So wipe away your tears
In misery we were not born
So raise your head and face your fears

Under the surface looking up
Reaching for the lights
Bring back the days from nights
Catch myself and take back my life
