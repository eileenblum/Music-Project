The words form your fathers mouth
And the pain from his swelling hand
His execution of anger, as you walk down this path
But the path's length made you comprehend

Like a footprint, deep in your mind
You're choosing a path, and their visions of life
What's suppose to be pleasure, they'll feel as pain
A fathers word is an uneraseble stain

Father, do you see the blood on your hands?
Your children's lives are lost, this was your only chance

You'll see it when they try to laugh but cry
How could you be so stupid to help them lose the fight
Look at us, listen to our words
Open up, and look them in the eyes

You can see it in their eyes
Desertion made their worlds
You can hear it in her voice
They never had a choice
