Running away 
I hear their screams
So shrill
Filled with terror
Dressed in death
With the suffering 
Allied on my side

My hate and coldness is
Freezing down their veins
Raping their minds
From everything but fear

Sonorous forever inside of my head
The look in their eyes the moment before
The trigger quits it all

Make their souls fall apart 
Into the darkest underground
Burning painfull along
With the devil forever 

Giving them 
Their darkest dreams 
Iâm addicted to show
My immortal rage
