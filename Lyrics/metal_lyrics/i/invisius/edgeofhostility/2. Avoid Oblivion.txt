In the end of the day
The sun is disappearing
I am standing still there is no way
The wind is all i am hearing
I regret now she is gone
Iâll never learn to face it
I feel the pain a darkened sun
The road is closed I cannot find the way

The light is gone I cannot see
My options is fading away
She doesnât know what she did to me
She doesnât know what to say
The madness is breaking through
Iâm lost in the world of confusion
There is no escape Iâm going into
A world of black with nothing but regret

She is gone and iâm torn to pieces
My world is turning dark
How can anyone resist the sickness
That strikes into my mind

If I could I would seek revenge
My mind is crazed and bloodred
I believe that everyone sense
My dark and burning hatred

She is over me
But she cannot see
I will chase her down
Iâll search every town
She can try to run
She thinks She has won
When I get to her sheâll wonder how
