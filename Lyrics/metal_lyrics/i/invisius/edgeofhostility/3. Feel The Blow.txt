No more faith to life
No more honor to keep
Confused and fading away
This guy was in too deep

Shaking and alone
Suicide - the only escape
An exit from life
And an entrace to hell

Nights without sleep
And nowhere to flee
All he wanted was just to be free
From the chains binding his feets
A true madness he was in too deep

He was afraight to die
But his situation
Didnât give 
Another choice

Then pull the trigger, and let it go
Then pull the trigger, and feel the blow
