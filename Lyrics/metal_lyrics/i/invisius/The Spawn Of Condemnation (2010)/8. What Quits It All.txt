Running away - I hear their screams
So shrill and filled with terror
Dressed in death
With the suffering allied on my side

My hate and coldness is
Freezing down their veins
Raping their minds
From everything but fear

Sonorous forever inside of my head
The look in their eyes the moment before
The trigger quits it all

Make their souls fall apart
Into the darkest underground
Burning painful along
With the devil forever

Sonorous forever inside of my head
The look in their eyes the moment before
The trigger quits it all

Giving them
Their darkest dream
I'm addicted to show
My immortal rage

Sonorous forever inside of my head
The look in their eyes the moment before
The trigger quits it all
