I, I see it in your eyes
The words that turn to lies
Your mind is all but bright
It all, lies within your words
They're burning as they hurt
Hard to believe, but you've been cursed

Will I ever walk this path?
Ever forget the past?
It's like a neverending doubtful task
A misgiving that remain
Cause will you ever change?
I hope that you will feel the blame

Now I feel like a fool, my heart is so confused
My time is now abused, but it's still hard to choose
You made me believe in a relation of betrayal
You were seduced, but I'm the one to fail
In your relations of betrayal I fail

[Solo - J. Tobiasen]

I can see it in your eyes
The words that turn to lies
Your mind is everything but bright
Still misgiving does remain
Cause will you ever change?
Still it's burning through all of my veins

You're in a world I'll never find
All this time, I was running blind
Standing at the gates of depression
Still I haven't heard your confession

Now I feel like a fool, my heart is so confused
My time is now abused, but it's still hard to choose
You made me believe in a relation of betrayal
Betrayal to fail
