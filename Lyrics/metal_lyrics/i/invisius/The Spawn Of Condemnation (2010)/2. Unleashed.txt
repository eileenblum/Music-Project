Past endless days in light of your beating
But I can't stand this anymore
Time to wake up, cause now the time has come
Awake and arise me from the floor

Too weak to struggle your hate
All confusion turned to ignorance
But temptations are now found in me
I'm awaking from my dream, time for recurrence

The past left nothing, but scars of red
Now they all break up releasing my hatred
A new dimension of me, is alive
In use of anger, showing my pride

I know you see me as a weakling
But your minds will chagce, when you see me as your king

Never expect me to rise
I am ready, now demanding the price

The past left nothing, but scars of red
Now they all break up releasing my hatred
A new dimension of me, is alive
In use of anger, showing my pride

You thought you killed, as you feeded the beast
You're wrong, the wicked is now unleashed
