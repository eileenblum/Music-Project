The time has now come
Stand strong at the battle's front
Fighting the forces of lies
This is our time to rise

Waking up the blinded people
To break their chains so fearful
Crossing the edges of brutality
For a life of new reality

We've reached the point to find
What we couldn't see as we were blind
Right now is the time to rise
Leaving the past as paying the price

[Solo - J. Tobiasen]

We've reached the point to find
What we couldn't see as we were blind
Right now is the time to rise
Leaving the past as paying the price
