I never saw it coming
I was too blind, too blind
You were a place of no belonging
With wicked thoughts, it made you flee

You - Can't - Drag me with you down
I - Will - Stand strong, as I watch you fail

You walk the path away
I wish I could make you stop
Insensitive dreams, leading to the bay
I wish I could wake you up, wake you up

[Solo - J. Tobiasen]
[Solo - M. Bennetzen]
[Solo - J. Tobiasen]

You were poisoned by your own hate
As you turned into what you couldn't take

You - Can't - Drag me with you down
I - Will - Stand strong, as I watch you fail
