Thrown into the dark behind the bars
As all acception crumble away
Lying with the future of open scars
This is right where they want my kind to stay

Memories from the night - Remembrance
Unregretted acts in moonlight - Revenge
Fighting against the forces of acception
Soon to disappear with a hateful confession

Soon to see the land of comprehension
Soon to hear their words of faith
They'll look upon me with appreciation
Home of eternity, heaven is the place

Memories from the night - Remembrance
Unregretted acts in moonlight - Revenge
Fighting against the forces of acception
I disappeared with a hateful confession
