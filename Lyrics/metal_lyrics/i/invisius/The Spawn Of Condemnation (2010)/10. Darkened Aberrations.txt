When life is taken memories are torn apart
The absolute pulls the strings of your apathy
The end has set the pace
I found it hard to breathe
I'm buried alive

As I watch the descent signs of life
It leads me to the point of no return
The end has set the pace
I found it hard to breathe
Asphyxiation from beneath

Staring into the eyes of eternity
The aberration in your life was me
When everything around you disappear
In a world of dark, unending fear

Until the end and into the void
I'm on the edge, dying inside - Inside

Staring into the eyes of eternity
The aberration in your life was me
When everything around you disappear
In a world of dark, unending fear
