A failure is what it is
Can't you see it?
I realized you were not trying
To keep us alive
As we were dying

I was sitting in my cage, blind, dead
Blinded by your grace and divine
My screams disappeared in the void
Now you seem so unreachable

I think you tried your best to keep me warm
But it began to seem so false
I couldn't hide, avoid, deny a feel of anger
We were moving closer, closer to the edge

Why all of these sleepless nights
Why all of these tearful fights
You turned my world into shades of grey
We were on the edge of hostility

[Solo - Flemming C. Lund]

I couldn't admit the pain
I was drowning, drowning in denial
Now I just wish that you could be
By my side forevermore

Why all of these sleepless nights
Why all of these tearful fights
You turned my world into shades of grey
We were on the edge of hostility

We were on the edge of hostility
