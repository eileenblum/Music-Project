[Solos: L. Koskenniemi]

I followed the path, leading to wrath
There was loss to see, all meant to be

[Clean voice:]  Eyes closed, I walk the miles
Drown myself in the sea of lies

Life ripped apart, so spare no-one
Forsaken, I became unknown to some

[Clean voice:]  All my life, 
All my lie
I had a reason, now you can
See right through me

That's who I am
That's who I am,
What I was and will be
Is this Hollow Man

In a moment, I left the sands
Clenching my blackened hands
Raging the road to my enemies
