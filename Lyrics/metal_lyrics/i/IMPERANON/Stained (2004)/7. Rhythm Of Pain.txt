Cold sweat running down my skin
This feeling I loathe, This feeling I craved
To drown again in to emotional pain,
To burn in the fire of misery

Warm flames licking my skin
Intense feeling of suffering
My vision will fade,
My heart will break
Help me now, no,
Please let me go!

Pain so extreme as to cause writhing
I'm convulsed by the agony.
I'm alive yet, I wish I was dead,
I close my eyes and take the dying breath.

Pain, pain, go away, come back again another day.
I can only escape it for a while, kill this pain, take it away.
All my pain, all away and here it comes back again...
