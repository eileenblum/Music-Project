[Solos: A. Sihvonen &amp; A. Virta, Titus Hjelm]

The old scars ripped open yet again
See me falter and see me fall
Watch me from the distance, sky growing darker
Gripping reality as I feel I'm slipping away

Every painful moment I bleed to fulfill
the sky painted with blood deeper still

Grey days and dark nights blending together
It seems this pain was made to last forever
Watch me from the cover, clouds getting darker
Opening the wounds, letting my blood run wild

The sun rises again to greet the pain
To sear my flesh, to open my vein
I waste no time for the madman's hope
Every passing day feeling closer to the rope

The ancient scars ripped open yet again
I will falter but I won't fall
Watch me from the shadows, Sky growing brighter
Spilling the life that runs cold inside of me
