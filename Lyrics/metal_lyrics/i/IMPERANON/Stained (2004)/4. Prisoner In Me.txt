[Solos: L. Koskenniemi, A. Virta, A. Sihvonen]

True freedom deep within, this agony is not a sin.
Inside these walls I'm captured in.
Blood dripping through my eyes, my life carries so many lies.
Thou shall fall, who shall rise.

If you see how these chains I have, make me feel like I was born to die.
If you hear my voice screaming out loud, please come save me before it's too late.

This soul is never sold, I keep only the trust of my own.
My soul, my cell, I'm a prisoner in myself.
Tonight oh, my lord so, I would like to flee from me.
This isn't real! Take this pain away!
