[Female voice:] As day turned to night, I saw the end approaching
No hope for us, but yet our faith stays strong

Kill them, hatred, flows inside my veins,
This will be the end of our days
All is lost but this blood will stain
My hands, my heart.

Die by my hand, all you hopeless ones
Deep down, my heart, darkest blood it runs
Through my veins its fire's burning bright,
You won't live through the night

[Female voice:] My eyes are blind, I won't survive

Years ago my life was torment
In the shadows I wait for my moment
To take your life, to make you pay
Under the cold moon you lay

I care not for the emptiness inside 
For in the end of this night
It will be gone, I will be whole
Your blood to mend my broken soul

[Female voice:] As day turned to night, 
I saw the end approaching
No hope for us, but yet our faith stays strong
No blade to take my life, no pain to make me suffer
This was the end and yet our faith stays strong

Air's filled with, air's filled with blood's scent,
I won't live through the night.
My heart is, my heart is dying,
I won't live through another night!
