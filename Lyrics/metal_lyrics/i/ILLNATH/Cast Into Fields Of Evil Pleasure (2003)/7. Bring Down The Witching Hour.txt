Pools of black eternity
Sweeping down on brightly burning fires
When comes the righteous ones
Bringing the servants of leechy throngs

Angels, remembering every promise
Black vise crushing the feathers white
Come pain deliver us in darkness
Unknown, the promise of their demise

Intercepting a world
Dwelling in disbelief

Were able to exterminate
You Down-to-Earthlings
With truth that would toss you into suicidal grief
What renaissance this hour will bring

Dark grimoires of sorceries
Filled with spells of cursed conjurations
Bring down the witching hour
From earth to ashes we all shall fall

Those eyes, ebony enchanted
Pass on the undenying truth
Of youth there isn't any left
What came from this insanity?

Bring on pain and suffering
The answer for crimes
Plead as much you can
You liar, you fucking liar

Pools of black eternity
Sweeping down on brightly burning fires
Bring down the witching hour
From earth to ashes we all shall fall

Free men, shall come as the unwanted
Forcing the old ones to leave in vain
At last denial bringing justice
Cruel fate, they are forever slain

[Bring down the witching hour - Comments]

[This lyric was done as a sort of homage to all the witches that died at the stakes in medieval Europe. The lyric was done some time before Narrenschiff joined the band, but it was a lyric that both he and I liked a lot so we decided to keep it as it was.The lyric is all about how the righteous people of the church killed all these women and the masses loved them for it. But now, today the witches are returning in great numbers and today we have no hallowed men to slay them for their knowledge. In the studio we found that it could do with a couple of lines and Narrenschiff added the final touch, so it's basically a joint effort. The title itself is partly inspired by Anne Rice and her Mayfair Witches.]
