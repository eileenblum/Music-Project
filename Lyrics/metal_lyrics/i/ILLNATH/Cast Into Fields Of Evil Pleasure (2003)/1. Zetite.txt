Deep I dig to discover the truth
Deep inside where secrets hide
I hunt the hierarchy's highest heroes
To hurt where vulnerability lies
Roses burning on a roaring ore
Of secret desires, hate and admirance
Within your soul, your mind and core
And leave you torn like an open sore

Without the use of violence
...Unless, of course, I have the chance

Now you'll see, now you'll find, now you'll recognize me
Caught in my grasp as you gasp to try and feel the air
Now you'll see, now you'll find how my ways work
You can try what you can to seek to find the answer here

Society's wars means little to me,
I have my pleasures, I have my affairs
My own agendas are impossible to see
Before you find yourself exposed in my lair
I sting and stain your insane soul,
I sting where it is fatal
You won't feel a thing at all
Unless you cause my house of cards to fall...

Try and find me
You'll find yourself lost in my maze
Try and get free
But I don't think you'll find the way

Now you'll see, now you'll find, now you'll recognize me
You're caught in my grasp as you gasp to feel the air
Now you'll see, now you'll find how my ways work
You can try what you can to seek to find the answer here

[Solo]

Step not close to me, because I may bite
As soon as you're stepping into my sight
No use to run or to try for flight
If I've seen you and feel you're the right
Jigsaw-puzzle-piece I need
To fulfill my ongoing deed
Of spreading my little, infectious line
Of immortal, blood feeding breed

Try and run now
Because you don't know the power of the blood bond
You can't hide how
Ever hard you try to find a haven safe enough to sleep
You can't hear me
Before I sneak up next to your resting-place
Nor can you see me
Before you look into my yellow eyes and

Feel your hope vanish in the air
And my bite sinking into your neck

[Zetite - Comments]

[This song was at the brink of causing us trouble with a company in Atlanta, whose name I shall not mention. It is based, I guess some of you already know, on the role playing game Vampire: The Masquerade (personally, I like the Dark ages setting better). I was quite fascinated by the song Death Becomes All from the "Angelic Voices Calling" MCD, and by this I spent my chance to make another song, in which the narrator describes how neatly he can tear off your head and shove it up your ass. I like these kind of songs.]

[Yet, I feel the lyric piece did not come very close to what a Setite in the role playing game might be like. Given this music, i think it was deadborn in the first place. Maybe Baali or Brujah would have fitted better, maybe even Malkavians... but I like Setites...]
