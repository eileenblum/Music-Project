Frozen constellations, now we are,
Forever trapped by illusions of fate
Arising from the ashes of fires,
Burning low in the shadows of hate

You and I, we are blinded by,
Hatred flowing from years of denial
As we cry, forever asking why,
The blind is following others in vain

Scorn these jubilations, by blinded ones,
They are a picture of bruteness and pain
Mourned by bygone years of exclusion,
Are forever the loss of our sin

Cursed, by shame and suffering
Our lives are but a memory of reason
Now it's time
Time for us to come crashing,
Down the broadening lanes of life
Trailing froth and illusion,
Showering others in the truth of their condemning lies

You and they, shall forever pray,
The common wish for a leader of man
Now and then, changed forever when
The old and powerful, slain was by man

Flowing tears, showing the world
All the pain and the fears
The old is here, and this time
There'll be no one spared

Frozen constellations, now you are
Forever trapped by delusions of pain
Real life breaks again bringing foolishness
You never know what tomorrow will bring

[One of the last songs I wrote, this one is about the Old Norse gods coming back to life and sending the Christian god running like hell... Not much to it, but a fun little lyric that I enjoyed writing. Don't think too much about this one.]
