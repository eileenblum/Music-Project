And there was light
And the darkness that followed blinded my eyes
The night made we trustworthy and hid all my lies
I called the seventh of the eight and gave him my offer
So cold were the feelings I bore inside after I'd lost her

Sometimes I still can hear
His voices calling, calling me from everywhere
And now and then
I feel my soul slowly slipping out of myself into his...

Hell claws at my window and makes me forget
To tell her of the deal and the conditions I met and now
It's far too late to tell her what's going on here
Somehow I'm almost looking forward to when this is over

"I felt my ghost cross over, and knew he was near
And across the river I could see him standing there"

And there was light
And the blackness that followed blinded her eyes
The night drew her to me and we met in the dark
And this "why am I here?" where the words she said
A kiss told her responsible for her being dead

She cried in silence and I wiped away her tears
She felt my cold hand amplifying her fear
She knew where she was and cursed her beloved
And all of a sudden it all was over...

Sometimes I still can hear
His voices calling, calling me from everywhere
And now and then
I feel my soul slowly slipping out of myself into his hell

"I know he's waiting there for me
In his limbo between destination and reality"
