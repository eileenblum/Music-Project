Behold, he stands before you all
Upon the tower, fit to fall
See the beauty of the never-ending
Hear his creatures call

Say then, say then:
Lay no eye upon my eye, lay no voice upon my crying
Set no truth above my lie, shed no tear upon my dying

An orphan is your child to be
And like you took my child from me
The likes of this, my vengeance
Have my hell bred creatures yet to see
I've never known such naked pain
As if I'm naked in the rain
I've searched each world for virgin soil
Fit for my slaughtered child's remains

Say then, say then:
For an eye you take an eye, take my voice for all your crying
Upon your infants grave I lie, upon it's death I do my dying
For his eye you take an eye, shattered was he when we found him
Stone and cut and crucify, leave his killer's heart unpounding

Men and angels hide in vain
For he who hath my firstborn slain
Shall die before the sun has set
He took my child, he will regret

Say then, say then:
Lay no eye upon my eye, lay no voice upon my crying
Set no truth above my lie, shed no tear upon my dying

Poised the strike in the slumberous sword
Of the dark and childless lord
"This machete of mine will get thee in time
We're alone in a room with no door"

Yes, I recall the death of one
Older and more holy son
I see the irony, but that won't render
This one deed undone

Say then, say then:
For his eye you paid an eye, a law you find is self-fulfilling
In your place your child did die
Death is all you gain from killing
