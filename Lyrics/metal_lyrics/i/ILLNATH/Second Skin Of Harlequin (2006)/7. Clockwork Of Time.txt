I see no hope where hope should be
A courtroom drama in major aspect
Mortal laws for those who see
Beyond extorted discipline and respect
I see no hope where hope should be
I see no seven, six nor three
Faith has vanished, they are banished
And gods fall furthers that you and me

Fall!

The clockwork of time is no longer divine
Shattered glass will guide the way, the path that leads
To judgement day

Pale and unmoving like golems of ashes
Away from the wind and the rain that slashes
Their powerful limbs to dust
Nothing left to loose, but no one left to trust

The ornamented entrance, the gate of pearls
The lack of maintenance hurts

And shivering is your empty hand
Pointing way to the promised land
Nothing is there but sun and sand
Nothing more than when we are banned
The shivering hand is loosing it's grip
Promises lamenting from your lips
As they're falling brick by brick
Falling brick by brick

Fall!

The clockwork of time is no longer divine
Shattered glass will guide the way, the path that leads
To judgement day

Stored in a space untouched by man
Praying for deliverance like only gods can
Do when they are alone
No churches nor shrines to call "home"
