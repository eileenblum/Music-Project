A granted wish for a demon's kiss
Drew lust for more and mental twists
Across the simple minds of men
And no one here was watching them
As they broke into their certain doom
By craving more that they deserved to

So crowned and claimed by Satan's eye
Is a book of truth that doesn't speak lies

Written words in well-inked shapes
In demon-blood as he rapes
The book of destiny
Claimed by the damned who wants
To stain his soul, but more can't be
For the one who seeks and will find me

Sought by the fallen one
Sought by the fallen one

And I can never leave
Forever bound in here
An everlasting dream
In an everlasting nightmare
And even though I still
Have my mortal soul to sell
In here I've found
My own personal hell

Sought by the fallen one
Recreating tortures down
Inflicted deep by the foulest demons
Children of the second son

Sought by the fallen one
Damnation for a battle one
There's nowhere left to hide my guilt
And nowhere left to run

My confessions were to grave
That no living priest was brave enough
To hear my spoken word be said
Corrupted by my pain
Slowly driving me insane
With oblivion due, I'd rather be dead

Seraphims sing their hymns in disgust!

"You cannot run from what isn't hunting", he said
"It cannot kill what was never meant to be dead"

Seraphims sing their hymns in disgust!
