She sweeps the doorstep, a well-used broom
Bring diseases and plague, the ultimate doom
By witchcraft of trolls she casts her spells
With curses from heaven and blessing from hell

With the unholy rain and the northern breeze
She curses the land with her broom-sweeps of disease
While beasts obey her commanding word
She sweeps mankind from the face of the earth

A damp air surround what's left
A faint touch of decay
A vast wreck yard is all that's left
Ruins of yesterday
Cultural monuments scattered

Broken, crushed, betrayed
As the survivors rise and start again
Trying to find a way

Plague! The devil is amongst us
Plague! Demise!
Plague! Run and hide the youngsters
Plague! Sacrifice!

"I'll kill you all as winter is coming and summer starts to crawl"

She comes to town at the raven-dark night time
When everyone lies restlessly inside
Like a lonesome ghost she walks out there
With red glowing eyes and pitch black hair

Bubonic plague, we're rotting alive
We are all bleeding so deep inside
Run to the forest, hide in there
Let not this demon come you near, my dear!

And all that's left is ashes
All that's left is dust
But we rise and live again
Because we know we must
And all that's left is broken dreams
All that's left is death
But we rise and live again
Living with every breath
