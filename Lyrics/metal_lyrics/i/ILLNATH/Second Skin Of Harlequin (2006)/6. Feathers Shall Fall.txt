The last days soon comes, the signs are shown
In the blood washed streets of a manmade Babylon

Feeding on everything our fathers left behind
Abasing her grace since the beginning of time

The rotten flesh of mother earth
Pleads in sincere desperation her longing wish for Armageddon
Deep inside a diabolical birth
Prepare the grim invasion of the twisted demons soon unleashed
"The worms shall seek the light, homeless children seek the night
Their minds in loveless bright, and dying sirens shall call
Angels walk the ground, no longer shall they be heaven-bound
Thunder's distant roar shall sound and feathers shall fall"

Pulling at her blood stained sleeve
Closing our eyes in disbelief

A starless sky in purple shades
Shine upon the landscape of am apocalyptical metropolis
It's a vast wound in her face
Decaying since the coming of man like god's leprous kiss
"The worms shall seek the light, homeless children seek the night
Their minds in loveless bright, and dying sirens shall call
Angels walk the ground, no longer shall they be heaven-bound
Thunder's distant roar shall sound and feathers shall fall"

Feeding on everything our fathers left behind
Abasing her grace since the beginning of time

Gnawing at her empty breasts
Tearing at her heartless chest

Rip the veil and secrecy away
Expose the truth, her deepest secrets in the name of progress
Bend the rules and break the chains
Binding us to the only touchable and certain god or goddess
"The worms shall seek the light, homeless children seek the night
Their minds in loveless bright, and dying sirens shall call
Angels walk the ground, no longer shall they be heaven-bound
Thunder's distant roar shall sound and feathers shall fall
The worms shall seek the light, homeless children seek the night
Their minds in loveless bright, and dying sirens shall call
...and feathers shall fall

...and feathers shall fall"
