[bonus track]

Children of the elements obey their fathers' laws
Worship the principles from which the manna falls.
Distinguish between the outmost truth and false
Catalysing divine riddles.

Searching between realities on a holy mission
Discovering the facts and fear the inquisition
Trying to read beyond the noise and the fission
Finding answers in the middle

Searching, searching, searching the ultimate one
Searching, searching, finding Aqua Diabolicum

Processes developing to a stabilized state
Time is expensive with everything at stake.

Through science almighty, through science divine
We bring nirvana to mankind.
Spotting truth in elements Creative ways of genesis
Achieving everlasting youth; death's quasid nemesis

Strange smells in the damp, warm corroded cave
Where acids burn and people learn as the fires rave
Beneath the boiling kettles 'tween where we stand so bold and brave
curious as well as damned

Creatures crawl in the deep dark corners of the chamber
As we peek inside of mother Earth and try to understand her
We find the disease, the reason then we find the cure
- So eager as well as banned.

[solo]

Searching, searching, searching the ultimate one
Searching, searching, finding Aqua Diabolicum

Something is developed after centuries of seeking
Something is shaped after centuries of beating.

Opening doors in the labyrinth of time
We brought eternal death to mankind
To break the code of gold, a holy quest for the chosen ones
We must stay secret, we must stay strong.

In the deepest black where the quill slowly creeps
across the ochre landscape of a paper sheet
Symbols of facts are written by a steady hand
like only a devoted and wise man can.
In dim candle light they all are written
letter that speak and seem demon-ridden
living, telling little lives in secret,
- are they truths or lies?
