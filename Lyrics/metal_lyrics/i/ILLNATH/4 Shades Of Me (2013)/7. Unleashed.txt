Plug in and join the scene
Forget what controls me
Just be here in this wave of electricity

This is it â It sets me free there is no pain
The smile on my face has set me free again
So kick back grab a beer and feel the wall of noise
And let yourself fall into a moment of joy

Have you ever felt the wave of sound move right through you?
Have you ever felt like the sound of your soul was unleashed upon the world?
This is it!

The air is thick
The string roaring towards the end of the world
The beat sending my head into a cosmic twirl
Join the wave and drink to this
The air is thick the rhythm of the world sounds like this

Plug in and join the scene
Forget what controls me
Just be here in this wave ÑÐ° this machinegun beat

Take a breath
Let it in surrender all you have left
Of your sanity, leave everything and reflect
On this moment you're in
The sound can be so fulfilling
This is so fulfilling

Have you ever felt the wave of sound move right through you?
Have you ever felt like the sound of your soul was unleashed upon the world?
This is it!
