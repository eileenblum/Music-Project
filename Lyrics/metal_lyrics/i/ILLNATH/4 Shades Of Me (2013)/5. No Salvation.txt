Salvation â Convicted for something we all know you did
I can't help but wonder, could you kill a kid?
And if you could oh how would it feel?
Have you ever asked yourself
How do they feel

How would you feel?
Pain, pleasure, anger, hate... destructiveness and pain

Thinking about those things you did
A smile appears on your face your soul's been lit
The way they fear you oh it turns you on
The fact that they can tell you no all they want

What you are justifies the penalty of death
I would love to be the one to take away your last breath

How would you feel?
Pain, pleasure, anger, hatedestructiveness and pain
How would you feel?
Pain, pleasure, anger, hate destructiveness and pain

To see those little bodies in such pain
To hear their voices crying out in vain
To feel them fear you oh it turns you on
There will be nothing left of them at all

And when they cry for your help
They realize there's no salvation

How would you feel?
Pain, pleasure, anger, hate destructiveness and pain
