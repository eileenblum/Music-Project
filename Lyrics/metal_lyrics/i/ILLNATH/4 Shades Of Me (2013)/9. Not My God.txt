If there is a god we are its creation
This god is so much more evil than you thought
It created man to be amused to celebrate deception
This god is so much more evil than you thought
My satisfaction comes from your cries of agony
They say I'm insane but I love my tragedy

Your god is ambivalent and cruel
He created all this misery you fool
Take a step back and consider the gravity
Of our little grasp on everything that could be

You are not my god â I despise all you are
You are not my god â Your god is a fraud

We might be nothing but a trace element of life
Time consumes us in the blink of an eye
The endless void we call the universe
Is closer to god than your treacherous words
My satisfaction comes from your cries of agony
They say I'm insane but I love my tragedy

You are not my god â I despise all you are
You are not my god â Your god is a fraud

This is my religion
Dedicationem et fortitudo

Anima et voluntas

Step into my world â This is the sound of my religion
Step into my church â These are the words of my creed
Dedication and strength â Soul and will

My satisfaction comes from your cries of agony
They say I'm insane but I'm loving my tragedy

I love this tragedy
I love my tragedy
