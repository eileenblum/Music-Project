So as he feels the knife she holds against his throat
His sweat breaks out, he's cold
The voice is a whisper from beyond
Angelic voices calling out to her in promise

She cuts his face
Demanding prayers
Sinful forever
Now wrath is here

From the time
When she loveth
Comes a burning pain
Deep inside

But now as the knife it searches deeper
He cries out from the pain
The men of her life forever sinful
And now she cleans the world of one more evil sinner

Live in pain
No more for her
Weeding out the weak
Is her ugly task

The voice is a whisper from beyond
Angelic voices calling out to her in promise

And now the time
For his departure
Has court with him
And death must come

Slit his throat

The knife is cleaned of his blood
She leaves the body dead
Going out to find another male
Deserving of her callous hate for being wrongful
