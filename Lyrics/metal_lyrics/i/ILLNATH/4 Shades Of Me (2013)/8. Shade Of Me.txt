This is the tale of death
Waiting to steal your last very precious breath
Have you ever seen the shade of you?
When you look at you do you see me too?

Have you ever seen the shade of me?
What did you see?

A thousand shades of me
Four shades entwined to be
You can never escape the need
To speak my name

Each and every one wear different shades
Take yours off and feel the sting of my blade
Be true to all beauty or beast
We all feast at the table, it has the shape of me

My shade is made of moonbeams and silence
Of life and of a million breaths
Of sunlight and four shades of death
Of life and a million breaths

Have you ever seen the shade of me?
What did you see?

A Thousand shades of me
Four shades entwined to be
You can never escape the need
To speak my name

I am the beast you must see
Your fears will end up feeding me
You can never escape the need
To speak my name

Quattuor umbras me
