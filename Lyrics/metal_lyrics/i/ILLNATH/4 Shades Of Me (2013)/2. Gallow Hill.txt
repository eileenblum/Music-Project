When they see you coming they all know what's coming
You are the murderer of them all
When they make mistakes you will be there to judge them
You are the murderer above them all

You carry the weight of the world
And now they carry it over and over again

The crowd goes wild oh how they love your shows
To most of them this is a joke
Not knowing that the steps of the condemned
Will be heard in these hills for ever more

You carry the weight of the world
And now they carry it over and over

You decide hang'em high executioner
Executioner hang'em high at your will
Their lives will end here gallow hill!
Angels fly hang em high executioner
Executioner hang 'em high at your will
Their lives will end here gallow hill

You will hang high here at gallow hill you die tonight at my side
Die with me tonight on gallow hill â DIE!

You decide hang 'em high executioner
Executioner hang 'em high at your will
Their lives will end here gallow hill!
Angels fly hang 'em high executioner
Executioner hang 'em high at your will
Their lives will end here gallow hill
