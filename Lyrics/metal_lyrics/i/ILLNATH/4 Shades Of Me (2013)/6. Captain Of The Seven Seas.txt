Once there was a man with a wooden leg
He had a knack for rum he kept it in a keg
His ship had pirates not many but a few
With nothing but the seven seas in their view

After work they would have a fight
Just like they would on any other night
If there were no one else there to beat
They would use each other as meat

Rum greed, mutiny
That's all a pirate needs
Rum, greed, mutiny
Captain of the seven seas

The journey for the man with the wooden leg
Took him past people that would scream and beg
For their lives though they never stand a chance
Against this man with a parrot that can dance

He has seen all wonders of the world
He has slain all the monsters in the world
He has seen the entire world with one eye
He is the man that doesn't know how to smile

If you desire to be like the captain of this tale
Fight all you can
And drink rum every day

Rum, greed, mutiny
That's all a pirate needs
Rum, greed, mutiny
Captain of the seven sea

Fight all you can
And drink rum every day
