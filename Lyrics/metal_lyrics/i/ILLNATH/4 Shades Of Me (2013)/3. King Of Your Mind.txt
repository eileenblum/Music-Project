Apocalyptic demons dancing in my head
Spinning a symphony of silky treacherous webs
If you dare to step into my imaginary home
You will become one to call my own

Watch your mouth you're in my world now
Feel your flesh fall from your bones while I take a bow
Watch your mouth boy!
You're in my world now
Feel your flesh fall from your bones while I

I am breath when you sigh
I am tears when you cry
I am king of your mind
I am the stone under which you lie

Frantic measures got you nowhere else
Than opening your mind to this madness
I now tell you what you can and cannot do
I am the product of your mind but we're not through

Watch your mouth you're in my world now
Feel your flesh fall from your bones while I take a bow
Watch your mouth boy!
You're in my world now
Feel your flesh fall from your bones while

It will crush your bones never leave you alone
Watch you suffer till the end
I will make you bend
I don't care if it kills me too oh god how I despise you
Your thoughts are my playground

I will tear everything down to the ground
I see my prey tries to leave
I can't help but smile you thief
You are the one with the key
I am your stress relief

Watch your mind you're in no ones world now
Feel your thoughts fall from your mind while no one takes a bow
Watch your mind boy!
You're in no ones world now
Feel your thoughts fall from your mind while I

I am breath when you sigh
I am tears when you cry
I am king of your mind
I am the stone under which you lie
