See the devil walking in the sun coming straight towards you
How does he make the decisions he makes?
He too has someone to turn to
Did you see me on his shoulder?
When you arrive I will be right there
To help him decide, I am what makes him decide to make you burn

So when you burn
You are welcome to blame it on me

You will feel this pain â it's on me!

So feel the burn â it's on me you don't have to pay me back after all
By now I think I owe you one for the years of shit you put me through
I hate you with all my guts and I ate yours for lunch they were bitter as me
And still the taste of them were sweet as sweet as anything can ever fucking bum

So when you burn
You are welcome to blame it on me

Your hate is what makes you bleed
And what makes me breathe
So here's a challenge
For your shitty mind
How it makes me smile
The freak in me
Has been unleashed

See the devil walking in the sun coming straight towards you
How does he make the decisions he makes?
He too has someone to turn to
Did you see me on his shoulder?
When you arrive I will be right there
To make him decide, I am what makes him decide to make you burn

So when you burn
You are welcome to blame it on me

You will feel this pain â it's on me!
