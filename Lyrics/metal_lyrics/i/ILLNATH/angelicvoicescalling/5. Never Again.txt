In the realm of the dead
Hatred born anew
Freezing souls unbound by fate
Comes to watch this abomination

She's calling out to him again
No answer is expected
Despairing in her pain
Feelings a whirlwind inside

In his wrath of the unjust fate
Chaos spreads among the dead
Never before a kind like him
Born from love and hate he is

But by the endless pit
The border eternal
Falling into the abyss
Is forever his love

All their pain
Comes again now
As the grayness of this empty
Realm forever

Trapped alone
Never more shall
Their love be fulfilled again
This romance is another

Never again shall they meet
Calling on him
Calling in vain

Hear the cries
All forlorn now
She feels eternity
Crushing her heart

Lost, alone
No postponing
The unavoidable
No more

Love
Shan't pass between
Lovers again

Fate
Brought pain and hurt
And now they know
Never again shall they meet

Now knowing his cruel fate
Believing the unwanted
Calling out to her in vain
Fortress of hatred he is

She's falling and the flames
Is licking her sweet limbs
Hearing his fated cries
Knowing cruelness is at play

Never again shall they meet
Calling on him
Calling in vain

Love
Shan't pass between
Lovers again
Knowing the cruelness of

Fate
Brought pain and hurt
And now they know
Never again shall she feel the embrace of her love
