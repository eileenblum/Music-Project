I am the master ruling the fate
Of the invisible ones guarding the gate
Walking in the shadows feeling the pain
Why do they wander fleeting in vain

I seek to gather and to enslave
The souls of mortal men wanting their awe
Watching the embers of burning bones
In gloomy darkness haunting their homes

They are forever the meek, facing the trial
So I walk with the moonlight, weeding the weak
No one escape my burning wrath
Feeling joy just listening to their final dying shriek

Living their lives out in utter misery
They are the mortal weaklings from birth forsaken
No need to shed no tears when time has come
For them to leave this world behind forever more

I seek to gather and to enslave
The souls of mortal men wanting their awe
Watching the embers of burning bones
In gloomy darkness haunting their homes

They are forever the meek, facing the trial
So I walk with the moonlight, weeding the weak
No one escape my burning wrath
Feeling joy just listening to their final dying shriek

Living their lives out in utter misery
They are the mortal weaklings from birth forsaken
You still shed tears for every loved one
But still I come to reap them all

I am the master ruling the fate
Of the invisible ones guarding the gate
Walking in the shadows feeling the pain
Why do they wander fleeting in vain

Reaper
Eternal is thy name
With the fall of the masses
Alight the flame

You are
The harbinger of fall
With the rise of eternity
When death becomes all
