You can see whatever you want to see
You can believe whatever you want to believe
The world will keep on changing and so will we
So suck it up, dry your eyes and wake up!

You want to see us fail? Not today!

Some will die, some will live, I fought for this privilege!
Some will fail, some will shine, it's up to you to live your life!

Sometimes things end, sometimes you bend
Things will change, tree of life
Sometimes things end, take your last breath
Take a look at the tree of life and death

Some will do their best to be static and detest
Anything new, or not created by them
Unfortunately for them, nothing can mend

You are blinded by your own insecurities
So afraid to stand up in case someone will see
We all have flaws and then you'll turn to stone
I love my flaws they are my own!

You want to see us fail? Not today!

Some will die, some will live, I fought for this privilege!
Some will fail, some will shine, it's up to you to live your life!

Sometimes things end, sometimes you bend
Things will change, tree of life
Sometimes things end, take your last breath
Take a look at the tree of life and death
