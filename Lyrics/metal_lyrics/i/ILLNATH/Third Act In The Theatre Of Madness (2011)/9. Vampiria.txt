Skin as pale as grave
More thirsty now than ever before
The hatred for each other fuels your lust
All you live for is blood no matter the cost

You will drain their lives
And still for blood you thrive
Nothing can stop you nothing can kill
This pinnacle creature of the night

Welcome to my world - Vampiria
I live for the thrill of the kill - Vampiria
To live or love? My home - Vampiria
I bid you to enter my world - Vampiria

Hunting in the night, take a breath make a sigh
Your victim has no clue what waits ahead
Eternal life and crushing hunger
For all eternity you will be no longer

Fangs as sharp as razorblades
More greedy now than ever before
The cold and bitter pleasure will rage
And kill the thrill of the kill

Welcome to my world - Vampiria
I live for the thrill of the kill - Vampiria
To live or love? My home - Vampiria
I bid you to enter my world - Vampiria

The only thing to fear is a wooden stake
In your heart so make no mistake!
