You can see me but can you see yourself?

Fight for freedom fight for war fight, doesn't matter what you stand for
Fight for nothing fight for fame, never knowing you put us to shame
So pick your conscience up from the floor
You betrayed it for so long, what are you fighting for?

...yourself or for everything?
So how can you tell us how to act when you don't know who you are?

You can see me but can you see yourself?
Let the lantern of passion lead the way
Let the lantern of passion lead the way

Fight for yourself, fight for your pride, do anything you can to deny
Fight for the right to fight, fight, as long as you can do it in spite
So pick you oppinionated mind apart
And remember, once you had a heart

Your heart is on fire
Fighting for any cause you can blame for your own mistakes
You lost your desire
Now aware that the flames consumed you completely
You are an empty shell full of hate
Walk towards the light
The lantern of passion will give you back your life

Fight for yourself, or fight for nothing!
Fight for nothing and fight for everything
Your oppinion becomes obsolete
Your cause has become to promote yourself
And nothing else

You can see me but can you see yourself?
Let the lantern of passion lead the way
Let the lantern of passion lead the way

For yourself or for everything?
So how can you tell us how to act when you don't know who you are?

Die!
