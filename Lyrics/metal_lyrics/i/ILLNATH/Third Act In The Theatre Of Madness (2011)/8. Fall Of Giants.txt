We have all secretly watched them create history
We have all enthusiastically enjoyed every masterpiece

They have helped mold me into who I am
They have changed my view of what can be done
I had no clue such fathomless things could be created by man
And I am crushed to know their time will come

We will live to see the giants fall

It doesn't matter if you like them or not
They have helped create the scene that you love so much
But be aware it is corrupted, everyone wants to be on top
Scavengers await your spot!

You can always sell your soul if your talents do not suffice
Money can solve your problems, drink their blood as lice

No integrity is left for sale, put on your suit and smile
But know inside that some of us see right through your lies!

So to those of you who paved the way I salute you
You have helped make my dreams come true
The world has changed because of you
This, no one else has the power to do!
So to those of you who paved the way I salute you

We stare at you and admire your guts and glory
And every one of us wish we could live your story

We will live to see the giants fall

To those of you who paved the way I salute you
