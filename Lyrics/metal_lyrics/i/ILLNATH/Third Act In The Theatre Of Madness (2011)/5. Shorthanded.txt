In order to be loved respect is needed
To give yourself completely
To another person knowing they can pick you apart
Knowing that by a flick of their wrist they can break your heart

Once broken it can never again be completed and
What can take you years to build can be torn apart in a second of guilt
It takes a lifetime to create, but love can be replaced with purebred hate
In the blink of an eye you'll be branded and both will end up shorthanded

Betray everything you've ever known
You'll betray, regret but not before it is too late
Betray everything you've ever known
You'll betray, regret but not before it is too late

A passion so strong it can turn doubt into stone
You find once in a lifetime if you overcome
The difficulties to give everything you have in order to live
With a person who has the power to rule
Your insides in whichever way he chooses

You'll be here but will you stay here, you can never convince my heart

Sometimes you lose and sometimes you win can you feel the difference?

You'll betray everything you've ever known
You'll betray, regret but not before it is too late
Betray everything you've ever known
You'll betray, regret but not before it is too late

Now you have to choose, take the risk or you loose
The latter will leave you shorthanded
And to take the risk can crush your bones
Decisions cracking in the back of your mind, making you wanting to die

You'll be here but will you stay here, you can never convince my heart

Corrupting the mind of another with false promises
Not realizing you smother everything it was meant to be
When your greatest fear is to end up shorthanded
Be careful where your seed is planted

You'll betray!
