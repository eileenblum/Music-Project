[CD Bonus Track]Cracking the whip in the burning sun
Breaking limbs and crushing skulls
In desperate need of victory
Denying to the bone, this is not your throne!

Your empire is falling
Crumbling at your feet
Your empire is falling
Into the righteous hands of your flawless fathers other son

Letting your anger out on them - slaves shall serve!
Wanting to rule more than anything else
Meticulously punishing their every move
Willing to accept anything but the truth

The city is burning feel the wrath of Ra
Pay for your betrayal you have come too far
You rip them up, tear them apart, leave them for dead and rot in hell
The ghosts of those you killed await your presence
Savage and enraged in the underworld they dwell

Your mind has betrayed you feel the wrath of Ra
Plotting against your own blood you have come too far
You rip them up, tear them apart, leave them for dead and rot in hell
The ghosts of those you killed await your presence
Savage and enraged in the underworld they dwell

In the end no one will hear your final call
In the end you will be alone when you fall
As corrupt as Seth, Osiris will prevail
As corrupt sa your mind I will prevail

Corrupting the minds of those closest to you
Wanting for your dreams of power to come true
The snake of desperation has poisoned you
Watching him, in war and peace, he's better than you!

Your empire is falling
Crumbling at your feet
Your empire is falling
Into the righteous hands of your fathers flawless other son

When the dust has settled the king is in his place
Incarnation of the god he rules unscathed
Whatever you were meant to, you'll do!
That is the most universal rule!
