The snake creeps around in your paradise, tasting the air, sly creature of Eden, cunning as the devil himself.

It watches you in your happy place, pushing you around a bit, there by your side at your best moments when they turn to your worst
When it turns your best into your worst

From the beginning there was a snake
Chewing on your conscience from within
But were you really not aware that all along it was your own private sin?

It watches you in your happy place, pushing you around a bit
There by your side at your best moments when they turn to your worst

It is so easy blaming everyone else for your choices
But your priorities are your own
It was so hard to consider our choices
But in the end our priorities are our own

Nobody is perfect, even Adam and Eve were fooled by the snake in you
Slithering, deceiving, denying yourself and everyone else the truth
I am sorry that your winning streak didn't last
But it was you who threw it away
The stakes were high and no one thought
You would be the one to betray

You blinded yourself

Friendship has been fading, you didn't pay attention to their cries
Did you not care or was it not worth a try?
Maybe something else caught your eye
Not realising the snake was you not I

You were here in your happy place, puhing everyone around a bit
There by your own side at your best moments
And you turned them to your worst

Nothing left to say now but goodbye
