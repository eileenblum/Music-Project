Spring Will Come
After the winter has ravaged your bones
Life Will Come

Everything will die, but it will return
Frozen rivers will thaw and reflect the sun back into space
The brutal winds of the north will settle down its elevated pace
But before spring comes the bitter cold
So brutal it can turn you to stone
And before warmth comes the bitter cold
So brutal it can turn you to stone

Spring Will Come, after the bitter cold has ravaged your bones
Life Will Come
Spring Will Come, after the bitter cold has scattered your moans
Life Will Come

Blizzards of chaotic tyranny will be tamed by the summer breeze
You will see the world and let go of your soul's dreadful disease
But before spring comes the bitter cold
So brutal it can turn you to stone

See the fields, watch them sway ayaw
See the sun, feel it on your skin

Spring Will Come, after the bitter cold has ravaged your bones
Life Will Come
Spring Will Come, after the bitter cold has scattered your moans
Life Will Come

The forrest will transform and once again provide for you
The land will be forgiving and you will pull through
After summer comes the bitter cold
So brutal it can turn you to stone

See the fields, watch them sway ayaw
See the sun, feel it on your skin
