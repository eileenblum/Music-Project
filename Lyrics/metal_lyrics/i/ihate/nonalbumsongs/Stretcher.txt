[feat. Chris Barnes from SIX FEET UNDER]On the run I take refuge
In this hospital a sheet covers my evil
Syringe in hand I hunt the next victim
You have no idea that you will die now
Into the neck you are injected dead
I hunt the next in this shadow of death

Kneeling down, reaching for
I back away and watch you there
Through the glass, I stalk your life
Through the glass, my next victim

Beautiful, the next to die
I will murder, the needle waits
For your soft skin, for your life
The hunt begins now

Following you throught the darkness
These corridors to the graveyard
I am your fucking savior
I am the grimmest reaper

Now you feel it, you know I'm there
Fear of dying, the nerves react
The mind plays tricks, you walk away
It's time to feel death, it's time to die

Through the doorway, down the stairs
My plan to kill you, unaware
You fucking whore, I'll make you pay
You goddamn slut, you'll feel my pain

This moment will endure
In my mind forevermore
A dose of death is my cure
The syringe will make it better

Now you feel it, you know I'm there
Fear of dying, the nerves react
The mind plays tricks, you walk away
It's time to feel death, it's time to die

I'll make you feel my pain
I'll make you disappear
You will suffer now

Alone to kill

You see the rage of my hatred for you now
