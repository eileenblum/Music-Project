Aeonian I dwelt
In caves of my demented mind
Upon the chasm of humankind
The Demigod expelled

Beneath the stars
But bounded by substantial mud
The one I brought to set the light
In realm of blind

The Star of East
I see it pale below the dust
Still shines non-plussed
Potential unreleased

I am the key
That waits the Man to come
Descent of Sun
The Chosen One
To set Me free

I show the Way
From ignorance to House of Gods
And someone has to step this path
One perfect day

I am the key
That waits the Man to come
Descent of Sun
The Chosen One
To set Me free

Eternity
Of pain for gamble I elect
Instead of Heaven to neglect
I wait for Thee

I am the key
That waits the Man to come
Descent of Sun
The Chosen One
To set Me free

It is done!
One day Iâll say it loud
Above the stolid crowd
The day Iâm gone
