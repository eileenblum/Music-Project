At last I see
Scales fell from eyes of mine
Monstrosity
Engendering the World Divine

True face of birth
The chthonic spawn of paramount void

In caves of Eden roves my mind
The den of flesh
Where thought of God materialized
Becoming mortal trash

Retrieved
Depressed I cry
In arms of Eve
The mother of mankind

Primeval monster of mankind
The evil predefined

The point where everything began
In utero of death
Like newborn God I feel with pain
My first and final breath

Retrieved
Depressed I cry
In arms of Eve
The mother of mankind

Primeval fiend of mankind
The evil predefined

So let me cross the purging gate
To get the other side
Your son becoming apostate
With ego petrified
