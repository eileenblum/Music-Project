In desert plains
I faced the monster of mankind
With billions eyes
On mucous leaden flesh

Misshapen, Deformed
Gigantesque desperate worm
The only goal it chases
To grope the Earth to devour

And every scale
Is smiling me with a face of dead
It croaks my name
And calling me to join

Itâs phlegm addicts
This sweetish, luscious, greasy taste
I start to sink
In corps of decadence

Misshapen, Deformed
Gigantesque desperate worm
The only goal it chases
To grope the Earth to devour

It eats me, absorbs
And makes me part of naught
In fragrant slime I soar
The Earth is doomed to be devoured

Sweet state of indolence
Engulfs me deeper in a dream
My form becomes
The faceless dummy slime

I have to run
The rays of sun I see abaft
The only chance
To stay someone
