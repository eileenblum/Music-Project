Our past goes with the light to the great nowhere
The radiation of our thoughts and visions
Ride the fourth dimension to get the center of Sansara
To enter the house of forgotten times.

I wander blind in sands of time
And grope illusions to adore
Amid the wail I yen to hear
Yet challenging...
The call of Yore

Past leaves with the light
Millenniums to radiate
The wheel of Sansara I ride
Reviving the dead

Begotten by the Age of fall
I choose to drink the cup of scorn
In void of present I recall
Yet challenging...
Descant of Yore
