Above the all
I soar on wings of my predestination
Above all morals and sins
With glance of damnation
I comprehend the guilt

And every damned will receive
What he deserves
And everyone is cursed

I am Lord Avenger! Behold!
Here comes the tempter and exposer
The Day of Judgement now gets closer
I am Forefinger of the God

And every damned will receive
What he deserves
And everyone is cursed

I bring redemption to the World
Detecting cravens and aborted
And every infamy will be rewarded
I am the Omen of Downfall

And every damned will receive
What he deserves
And everyone is cursed

I made of light which burns the souls
Of slaves atrembling in their temples
The God of Vengeance I recall
My Ark will float on waves of ashes
And blood

And every damned will receive
What he deserves
And everyone is cursed
