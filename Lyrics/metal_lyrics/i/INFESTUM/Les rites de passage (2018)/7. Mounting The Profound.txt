This vale is filled with gobs of serfs
I feel their smell of sweat
Like vermin building muggy nest
They rise their sacred place

Conduct the light
You must highlight the ground
Where fools abound
They mounting the profound

The higher grows
The deeper goes

And everyone thinks he is grave
When drags stercorous stone
Runs roughshod over other slaves
Thus the profound grows

The higher grows
The deeper goes

I plod midst scared architects
Erecting stones to chasm
The lash of light their skin dissects
Their prayer spreads miasm.

I cross the rabble
Of pointless acolytes
Erecting chasm
To reach the skies

The higher grows
The deeper goes
