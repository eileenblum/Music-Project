Illusion of time
Dissolved in beyond
Initial point
And perfection of mine

I am my Father
And I am the Son
I am my Salvation
And my Death to come

Falling free
Into void of unknown
In ethereal gravity
I do reborn

Arcane rite
Every step on my path
Redeemed I arise
Purified

I am the first
And I am the last
I am the Uprising
And recall from the past

I walk through the labyrinth
Of fears, anger, and pain
I am the priest and oblation
A blessing and a blame

Diving deep
Into void of unknown
In ethereal gravity
I do reborn

Arcane rite
Crucial step on my path
Redeemed I arise
Purified

The final passage
Of shifting my mind
All fears and doubts
Are left behind

I am the soil
And I am the light
I am the water of life
And a blaze in the sky

Every mortal shall
forget My name
