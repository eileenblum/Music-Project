Unveil the wretchedness
Of worms in hedonistic spree
Alone beneath a crowds of scavengers
I feel the smell of their glance on me
Descry your Priest, your Slave, your Avenger!

The grail of sorrows in my hands replete
With blood expelled

Drink from it, all of you
For this is My blood of the Ultimate Covenant
Which is poisoned for many abjections and sins
Communion begins!

Here I am
The one who will feed you with pleasures
Eat my flesh and suck all the blood I release
Fill your gorges with leper of fury I measure

I die for your bliss
I am spreading disease

Drink from it, all of you
For this is My blood of the Ultimate Covenant
Which is poisoned for many abjections and sins.
Communion begins!

Look above!
My spirit released and ascended
Will lead you to all the barrows and slums
Where humanlike beings are swarming
Spread my Word, my Flesh and my Blood
By the sweat of your face You will eat them
Till all of you return to the ground
Because from it you were taken
For you are the scum
And to scum you shall return

Here I am
The one who had scourge you with pleasures
Redeemed from your bliss
I am your disease
