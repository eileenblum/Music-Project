Here comes the light
The blaze the blind can feel
My single glance ignites
Veiled I reveal

Peace to ashes and joy to dust I turn!
Fuel the masses, to burn is to reborn!

I am the blaze
That scours the Man in flame
I am the Star
Fire be my name!

In flare of Will
I dance on pyre of allegiance
The aim to mayhem I fulfill
Divine irradiance

Fear to ashes and shame to dust I turn!
Fuel the masses, to burn is to reborn!

I am the blaze
That scours the Truth in flame
I am the Star
Fire be my name!

World putrid I slay
In my name

The God of Havoc I release
The medium of only truth
Celestial provenance of Genesis
Thus everything begins

The fiery Serpents I command
The ones who designate the Doom
They pierce the space with sparks of void
Void of embodied words
