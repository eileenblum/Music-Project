[Lyrics: Ion]

Eyes of the thousands in my eyes
I see no men but only slaves
I see no men but only doomed
I see no men but living dead

Voices of the thousands in my speech
I scream no words but only pray
I scream no words but only sneer
I scream no words but only curse

I turn into the beast
I turn into the god
See my greatness
See my wildest elation

I subsist since a human being arose from ashes.
In my essence lurked all secrets of creation.
I am the shade of every being
I am the law incarnation.

What will be the world without any shadow?
What will be the man without his true nature?

Envy me!
Join me!

Wisdom of the thousands in my mind
I muse no thoughts but only hate
I muse no thoughts but blasphemy
I muse no thoughts but dreams of blood
