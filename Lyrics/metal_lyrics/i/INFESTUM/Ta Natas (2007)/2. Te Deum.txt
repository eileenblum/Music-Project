[Lyrics: Ion]

I pray to Satan,
Pray to the Lord of Light
Asking for wisdom,
Power and delight.

I ask you for wisdom...
Oh, Lord, regain my sight!
I want to be omniscient,
To perceive the light!

I pray to Satan,
Pray to the Lord of Night
Asking for power,
Wisdom and delight

I ask you for power...
To rule sway the destinies!
Let the destiny die
Come true for all my enemies!

Let the slaves be sinful!
No single sin in my spirit...
Let the humans be blind!
No humanity in my being...

I hail You, my Lord!
I praise Your sacred name!
Bless my mind and bless my sword!
Let my eyes blaze with your flame!

Let me rise over this cruel world.
Let me be alone.
Let me find the part of mine.
Oh let me know, give me the sign!

I pray to Satan,
Pray to the Lord of Life
Asking for power,
Wisdom and delight

I ask you for delight...
Eternal pleasure for my slaves.
They want be carnally satisfied.
They will be bondslaves 'til their death.
