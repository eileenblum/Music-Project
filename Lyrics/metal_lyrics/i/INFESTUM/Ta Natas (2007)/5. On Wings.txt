[Lyrics: Thorngrim]

Wings of darkness
Fly up the sky
The sword of glory
Crack the night!

Ice and fire
Flesh and blood
A sacrifice
To my hungry heart.

Songs of forests
And the lightning strikes.
Essence of evil,
Do you hear my growls?

Mother winter,
Control my mind!
Unholy visions,
You pet my pride!

Winds of Nordland,
You rule tonight!
Take my cold hand,
And lead me to the fight!

Between two candles
My deathly face
And pure blackness
Still in my veins.

The twilight powers return
And destructive eternal flame
When the darkness reflects
My true infernal pain!

Oh, ancient moon
And stars on the black night sky
Magic source
Of the frozen violent light.

Open the gates
To the hall of sacrifice
Where I shall grind a fucking human life.

I feel the energy
Of the endless space
Its attractive emptiness
Like the nature's grace.

The black winds destroy
A dirty fucking Christendom
And the wind of my sword returns
To the lovely unholy kingdom

I hear the symphony of twilight
I feel the breathing of frost,
I want to see the sequels of the storm blast
And mysterious realms of ghosts.
