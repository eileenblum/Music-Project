lay basic principle is pain
And mental suffering of Word
Avoid is get into insane
Or go with stream of inner world

To die is only way of life
Prepare to leave your body soon
Your future is a carrion rive
Pass through the labyrinths of doom

You are living in a realm of Pest
The only fate to feed my mind.
Without goal, without rest
And only fortune is to die

You need the haven to escape
The glamour selfish lullaby
Your ideology was raped
So what? Tomorrow You will die!

I am not your savior
I deny your lies
Zero Beyond

Zero Beyond
I am not your savior
I am the King of disguise

Your soul is sentenced to erase
Defined as virus of mankind
Annihilating Deathâs embrace
For putrid flesh and shallow mind

The only guilt is you are brute
Eternal life for You is fiction
All this for You forbidden fruit
Your life is prays to crucifixion!

Redemption fails
There is no mercy for the blind
Baptized by nails
Your Heaven is recycling plant
