Among the human ghosts who never lived
eternity at last achieved
All universe had lost materiality
You fall into alternative reality

Eternity
Duality

All previous memories erased
There is nothing feels like form and weight
And like beginning and the end
At once you're rock and grain of sand

And what is fiction
You had been terrified
The cruel instintction
The Void of Nebulae

And what is real? What is fake?
And what to feel, to see, to take?
And no more reasons to regret
That you where alive and now you're dead

And what is fiction
You had been terrified
The cruel instintction
The Void of Nebulae

You're dead for all what lives in lies
Thinks their feels are real life
Thick balance on the edge of knife
The crucial moment has arrived

On the other side of your mind
Where is nothing to exist
Only shadows in mist
Do you call me your priest?
Want you find the way out?
Eyes opened wide
Deep in the night...
Void of Nebulae
