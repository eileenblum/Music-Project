I face the eternity
Standing at the end.
I see the reality
With the eyes of blind.

Not someone anymore,
Not any one at last,
Not on the pass,
But The Pass by myself.

Not gazing the stars
But Shining among.
Everything in me
And I am in everything

I dissapear in light,
Two infinities till dawn,
Nothing endless exists,
Nothing mortal resides.

Absorbing the substance,
Creating dimensions,
Evolving misanthropy,
Setback of ambitions.

Here and now I'm alone,
But time doesn't exist,
Natural born Messiah,
I invocate my priests.

Stars on skies are burning
Stars under my skin I see
Mind and Flesh Reunion
Summoning the Father of God in Me.
