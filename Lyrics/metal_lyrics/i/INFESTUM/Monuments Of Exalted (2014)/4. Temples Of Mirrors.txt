In Temple Of Mirrors I see The God
All World is reflected perception of mine
I draw this illusion by paints of my blood
The Will to Create is my vital lifeline

Soaring the skies, diving the water
Enveloped in flames I felt down to Earth
To enter the Gates

In Temple of Mirrors I see the Beast
My Mind is a vessel with poison of hate
It crawls in my being like a shadow in mist
The hand of destruction that is my fate

In Temple of Mirrors I see the flesh
It borders my Mind in dimensions of Time
Without my thoughts it is only a trash
Existence turns it into source of Light

In Temple of Mirrors I see no one
My World will exist while I am alive
Between Here and Nowhere I'm standing alone
All Universe falls from edge of my knife

Soaring the skies, diving the water
Enveloped in flames I felt down to Earth
To enter the Gates
