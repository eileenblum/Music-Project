I stand before the crowds of slaves
Poor bastards thinking they are free
I hear the clank of their faith
To fabled god of selfish dreams

Fake believers
The truth I deliver
Leading the blind
To the end of mankind

I sermonize the Word of Truth
But they are waiting for the tricks
The only food for scant belief
Like testimony for the weak

Fake believers
The truth I deliver
Leading the blind
To the end of mankind

This Spire goes through the worlds
The Tree of ten Sephirot
Here I crucify myself
My mind transmits to outer space

They need a wizard not a priest
Who turns the water into wine
And loosing blood in fight with Beast
But in three days returns to life

I rise upon the throne of flesh
Channeling to another dimension
My faith transforming to Will
The final stage of procreation
The God

I have the miracle they worth
Hard Iron Hammer of the truth
Wide opened eyes becoming curse
With lash of fears I am leading forth
