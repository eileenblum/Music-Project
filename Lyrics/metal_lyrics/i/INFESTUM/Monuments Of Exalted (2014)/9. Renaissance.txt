Total reunion of thoughts
I see invasion of clear mind
Awaken ghosts of renaissance
the key of wisdom lies behind

All natural beauty shines again
The scripts have risen from the dust
And celebration of Insane
Is gone away to tecnopast

I declorate New Age of Man
The renaissance of God in flesh
Altar of Pride Will rise again
embodiment of plebeian crash

All mystics of the human mind
Reborn from chaos of the faith
doctrines of rotten church denied
The only law is might and grace

The walls of Babylon rebuilt
And towers grow to reach the skies
Renewal by supernal wilt
After millenium of lies

I declorate New Age of Man
The renaissance of God in flesh
Altar of Pride Will rise again
embodiment of plebeian crash

Awake!

Perceived Divinity of being
Which holds the power to create
Revolted mind will spread the wings
To be the masters is Our fate
