Swear to kneel before no one
The root of slavery expelled
My God is Overman to come
All idols of foretime are felled

Decision...

Decision transforms into destiny
The destiny to choose the path
Among the stars

I swear to decimate the scum
To be the enemy of all
What rots in dungeons of the mind
Degenerated world would fall

Redemption...

Redemption transforms into renaissance
The renaissance of God on Earth
The world to come

One word that was never spoken.
One light that was never lit up.
An unparalleled confusion.
And a road without end.

[Excerpt from âLIBER NOVUSâ. C.G.Jung]

I swear to grasp the mysteries
The ways to rule my universe
And puissance of mind reveals
The dark reality's reverse

Ascension...

Ascension transforms into sorcery
The sorcery of intellect
Behold the God

I hail New Order
Dedication begins
I hail New Order
It is time to reveal the Self
I hail New Order

I swear to sacrifice myself
For passage to the Golden Age
Apparent omens I observe
And ready to escape this cage

Oblation...

Oblation transforms into Phoenix rise
The Phoenix is my Sign
My banner of rebirth

Amen, you are the lord of the beginning.
Amen, you are the star of the East.
Amen, you are the song that sounds far over the water.
Amen, you are the beginning and the end.

[Excerpt from âLIBER NOVUSâ. C.G.Jung]

I hail New Order
Dedication begins
I hail New Order
It is time to reveal the Self
