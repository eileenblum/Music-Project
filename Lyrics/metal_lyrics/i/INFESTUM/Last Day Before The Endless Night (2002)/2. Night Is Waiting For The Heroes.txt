In the land without heroes
Man was born without face
In the desert of the mirrors
He had hide in empty space

Always tried to be unnoticed
Time was looking for the man
He must pay for his asylum
Time is taxman, man is man

Victim's found,
But tale is going
Hunters looking for the next
In the land without heroes
Man was born without face

But in same land through the centuries
Shall be born another man
He will have his face and glory
No one can not that he'll can
