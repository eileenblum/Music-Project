Infant screams light up the night
Pregnant woman torn to pieces
Infants ripped out of their mothers' wombs
Total abortion - It all ends here

With a baseball bat I start to pound
As you open your bleeding eyes
you hear a clicking sound
My gun points at you - I start to count

Fire consumes their cradles
Razor blades in their cakes
Prams pushed out on the road
No babies - Birthrate Zero

There will be
no next generation
It all ends
Here!

Infant screams light up the night
Pregnant woman torn to pieces
Infants ripped out of their mothers' wombs
Total abortion - It all ends here

With a baseball bat I start to pound
As you open your bleeding eyes
you hear a clicking sound
My gun points at you - I start to count

Military control - I'm in control
Heavy tanks squeeze babies into pools of blood
Death squads seal our fate
as they eliminate the hopeful parents

Fire consumes their cradles
Razor blades in their cakes
Prams pushed out on the road
No babies - Birthrate Zero
