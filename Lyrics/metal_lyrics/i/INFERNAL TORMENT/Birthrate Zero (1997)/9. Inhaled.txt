Internal damage in my lungs
Another cigarette is on its way
Lots of smoke fills this place
Smoking cigarettes in different ways

Smoke another cigarette label
Smoke ten at a time if you're able
Hear the sound of coughing people
See the people biting nails

Trails of ash on my way
I've been smoking all the day
Cheating cigarette machines with foreign change
Its  a trick that never fails

INHALED

I light a flame
I scream in pain
I have burned my fingers
I drop the lighter in the dust
The cigarette price is very high
I could almost cry
Bombing on its way
The price I cannot pay

Cigarette factory - Termination
No more smokes - Mass frustration
A smart person - Selling pipes
To the people - Of the nation

As I light my pipe
You see me smoke
Sleepy eyes staring black at you
