I know it is too late
Too late to stop my hate
My hate will terminate
Terminate the human race

Kill the race
Smile on my face
Kill the race
Smile on my face

Don't believe in equality
Erupt your destiny

Kill the race
Smile on my face
Kill the race
Smile on my face

Don't believe in bosh and lies
We all eat shit and die
Die!

Terror is the oonly way out
Hate this fuckin' place and that's why
I have lost my patience
The human race will soon be extinct
Why are people so naive?
Don't they know we'll all expire?

Terror is the only way out
War and terror is the only way

on't do what you want
Do as I tell you
Die in a war against yourselves

Clench your fist around this world and squeeze
Human nature is its worst decease
Prophets say our race must stop to increase
I just want to see the whole world cease

I have lost my patience
The human race will soon be extinct
