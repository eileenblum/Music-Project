At first I felt confused
because of the ravings of this sick world
Now all I feel is total hatred

You faint but you still vomit blood
A sound like a sheet that has been ripped

At first I felt confused
because of the ravings of this sick world
Now all I feel is total hatred

Send the message clear
Die you queers
Reason to fear
The end is near

You faint but you still vomit blood
A sound like a sheet that has been ripped

It's your intestines
That burst like a balloon
Blood sprays from your rectum
The blood is filled with shit

It's so beautiful
A perfect form of life
Built with just one aim
Destruction of mankind

Profound frustration towards the pathetic human race

Send the message clear
Die you queers
Reason to fear
The end is near

The world has brought it on itself
Its own destruction
The deathly virus will poison the air
End of civilization
