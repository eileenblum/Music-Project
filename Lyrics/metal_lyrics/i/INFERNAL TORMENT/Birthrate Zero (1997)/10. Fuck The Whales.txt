[cover of "7th. Son of the 7th Son" at the same track]

Nature fanatics say that you must save the whales
but in my opinion you can fuck the whales and save yourselves
I see no delight in natural sceneries
Hate the colour green, hate the animals, the primitives
Love only myself and the modern society
Love the manufacture and the brand new technology
Preservation of natural amenities
is the worst bullshit mother fuckin' crap in history

Fanatics
Nature faggots fuck yourselves
Fanatics
Green peace members go to hell
Fanatics
Nature faggots fuck yourselves
Fanatics
Green peace members go to hell

FUCK THE WHALES

Do just like SHELL had planned to do
Dump all your shit into the sea
Cum every time you feel a tree
This is just pure sincerity

Watching nature bleed
Bleed for me and industry
Earth pollution breeds
Breeds for the technology
Fanatics give in
You can't fight development
New times must begin
Now

FUCK THE WHALES

Rain forest nuclear power plants
is the new step of development
Great buildings decorate the scenery
This is just pure sincerity

Little bird wrapped up in oil
I just want to crack its skull
Cataclysm fanatic
Smashing hippies with a brick

Fanatics
Nature faggots fuck yourselves
Fanatics
Green peace members you can't save the world
Fanatics
Nature faggots fuck yourselves
Fanatics
Green peace members you cant' save the
poor little bird wrapped up in oil
Rain forest nuclear power plants
More space is a necessity
This is just pure sincerity

[Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son]

Here they stand brothers them all
All the sons divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one.

Here the birth from the unbroken line
Born the healer the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds

[Chorus:]
Seventh son of a seventh son  [x4]

Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the evil which path will he take
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers before it's too late

[Chorus:]

Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the sechond sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done
