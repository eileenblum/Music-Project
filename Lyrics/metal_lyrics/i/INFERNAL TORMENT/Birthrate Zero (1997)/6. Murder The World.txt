Bring the world in pain
I wanna waste it
Raping the earth
I wanna taste it

Murder the world

Factories adorn the scenery
Smoke pollutes the sky
Hippies are gathered in long lines
waiting for the deaf ears to hear their cries
Nature in a state of decay
Decade of a dying nation
Some people say it's a threat
We call it liberation

Murder the world
Murder the world
Murder the world

They are so fascinating
The great machines we all know as our gods
and so they are creating
Now ther are dominating
The human race has now lost its domain
Conditions aggravating

Bring the world in pain
I wanna waste it
Raping the earth
I wanna taste it

Murder the world
Murder the world
Murder the world
Murder the world

It is so fascinating
Technology brinds all the dead things to life
Conditions aggravating
Remember when we made a
recipe of how the future should be
Now they and we are breaking
the rules we once gave this world
We don't give a fuck no more
We'll all make a nice end of this dead world

Factories adorn the scenery
Smoke pollutes the sky
Hippies are gathered in long lines
waiting for the deaf ears to hear their cries
Nature in a state of decay
Decade of a dying nation
Some people say it's a threat
We call it liberation

Murder the world
Murder the world
Murder the world
Murder the world
