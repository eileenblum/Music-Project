Take a good look
deeply into my eyes
You'll see the will to live
fades and slowly dies out
There is no harmony
within myself
This world is overcrowded
yet no one has heard my cry for help

Razor Twist

If you've got nothing to give
this rotten world is simply
no place for a man to live
The chaos in ourselves will rise
If you are smart enough
you'll listen to some good advise

Yeah, stand up straight or lie down dead
Just hold a gun against your head
It's your life, no one gives a fuck
Suck that shotgun like a cock
You're dead

Razor Twist
Razor Twist

Cutting wrist
The razor twist
Twist the blade
Unleash the hate

When you've got nothing to lose
The razor twist is the one and only way to choose
The chaos in ourselves will rise
If you are smart enought
you'll listen to some good advise

Yeah, stand up straight or lie down dead
Just hold a gun against your head
It's your life, no one gives a fuck
Suck that shotgun like a cock
You're dead

Razor Twist
