Just spit your lies as truth
And make sure that I taste your sand
And swallow 'till I go bizarre

Just feed machines in vain
To put yourself to reign
We're just who walks inside the measure
Of your greed

I wanna see you lead me
Right inside those walls
Just because "Big brother" can watch us all
Use this chain that I will wear for him
And feed my heart with guns

Right inside these walls
my mind has been chased
And I become a sheep
I'll never be the same

I can't find my thoughts
My words were never told
Cause my head has been refilled with hate

I wanna see you teach me
Some of that wrong world
The one in which the answers come out from thoughts
Use this chain that I've been carrying with
And lead me out from "home"

I feel your needles stabbing my brain again
It's my insanity that brings back my soul
'Till I break this chain
'Till I break this chain

I wanna see you teach
Some of that wrong world
The one in which the answers comes out from thoughts
Use this chain that I've been carrying with
And lead me out from "home"
