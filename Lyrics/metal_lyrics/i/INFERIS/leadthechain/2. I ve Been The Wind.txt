I've been the wind
Or just been air?
I've been the breeze and feeling
Or just someone's illusion?
A mysterious thought

That fades away among your fingers
In your fanciful illusion
You turned me in
Too many reasons now are telling
You... "forgive me"

And no matter how... I always told you
Do you have the time for waiting?
"I don't mind loving the wind again"
...again, again and again...
Don't walk away... because I'm lost... lost
Without you
Dreams not coming back

I don't know about the time
Just talk to me
The feeling in my heart I didn't find
By your side I'll go
A brief fate I'll create
To walk with you

Don't ask me for exclusivity I can't leave
Loneliness and you know it well
No matter how hard I try

And no matter how... I always told you
Do you have the time for waiting?
"I don't mind loving the wind again"
...again, again and again...
Don't walk away... because I'm lost... lost
Without you
Dreams not coming back

I don't know about the time
Just talk to me
The feeling in my heart I didn't find
By your side I'll go
A brief fate I'll create
To walk with you

I don't know about the time
...I don't mind loving the wind...
You always answered...
But you always answered...
But you always answered!!!

I don't know about the time
Just talk to me
The feeling in my heart I didn't find
By your side I'll go
A brief fate I'll create
To walk with you
