Don't be fool
They would lie to you forever
Now they know that you don't care

So let me know to understand
After all those years of fight
We're pretending all is fine
They're stoling all the lands

We're suppose to forget
but the story is the same

[Chorus:]
(Tell me what you see and what you hearâ¦)
Is a brother or a thief who we're stoling from?
(Tell me what you see...)
I guess it's fine, while some strangers
feeds their greed
(Tell me you see and what you hear...)
They bleed ages for this land,
Now bleed for hope
(Tell me what you see and what you hearâ¦)
Could you think about it?

They make us obey, believe and see
While the tube is turning on again
feeding what we ignore

We're suppose to forget
but the story is the same
Will you be part of this game?
or you will accept this joke?
Your silence, your blindness
It all it's helping strangers greedâ¦

I can't believe that we do none
there's no return
unjustice done
