Freezing cold blade
Spanish blood is on my hands
look at me for one last time
is the last face that you'll see

Swallow melting boiling gold
Is not what you came to looking for?
Thunders bolds and mountains explodes
so our gods rise from the south sea
Can you hear their cry?

Stand with me
Have no fear
Calm your heart
My little child
Ancients guard, the secrets
Arauco's strengths
Will show you again...

Rise! Be proud and be strong
Proof that they're wrong
Show me the meaning of their lifes

[Chorus:]
Fire and soul, tradition and blood
(run) through my veins
Hear my voice I went that you search on
My heart again
Pass of time
Will give me the reason and pride
Young brother be proud of your blood (cause)
We'll win thousand times...war will be
one and only way out!
