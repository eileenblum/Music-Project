One day after the war of moons
they came, so difficult to see
one day we realize...
we'll never be the same

They came, strangers cloth on steel
decide to rule and crush our will
bring fire and blazing swords to teach
by pain we knew their god
we don't know what "God" could
mean not even his word
but we're so sure we'll bleed in name
of him

...history we'll know,
what's right or wrong...

[Chorus:]
I'm now
in middle of these fields of fury
and despair
facin' them I realize
my land can cost my blood
I'll give it all, now I know
reasons lost
when men collide!
