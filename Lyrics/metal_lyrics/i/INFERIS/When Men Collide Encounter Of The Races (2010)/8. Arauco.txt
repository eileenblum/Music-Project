"..From sixteen lord is that possessed estate
State so much blood has been shed for
Venus and Amon here do not take part
Only raging Mars dominates"

Rivers from south
Fills with blood of my land,
Spirits are calling for the great NgenechÃ©n,
Youth of Lautaro, wisdom of Lientur
That's savage knowledge of an age
nature will revenges and strikes,
Ooh... One day...

[Chorus:]
"..Has never lived, A king who holds this
Mighty land or his sons
Daring, bold, brave and nimble people
Fearsome always were free
..Such its worth of these men
In the arts of the sword..."

(Our) path full of victories one day
Will be known
The worth of Arauco will shown the way
A tale of resistance for three centuries
Against the crown of Spain
And leading the sword, stained with blood
greed and faith
