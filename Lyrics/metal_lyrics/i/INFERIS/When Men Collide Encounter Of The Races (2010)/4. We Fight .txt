Four hundred years, long ago
Virgin land was forced by white race
(in the name of the faith)
face to them we stand lances up
ready to strike again (owners of the land)

Spain will not know most brave men
valiant warriors, Sons of the untamed
woods and south, Andes burns
king's men fall

[Chorus:]
We Fight!!!
waves after waves from the forest
We Fight!!!
leaving behind our differences
We Fight!!!
tribes become one by our freedom
We Fight!!! Side by side heart to heart

shadows of winners on Europe upon us
bring us slavery and faith
stained with blood

Clouds (of) arrows hide the sky
and fire kill men of steel
three hundred years of deed
See your fortress down as you rebuild
"leader of the new extreme"
death can't be curb this free n' mighty land
run you fools, fills of greed
blind with faith
