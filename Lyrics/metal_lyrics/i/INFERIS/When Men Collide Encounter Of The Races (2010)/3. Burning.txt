We wait, again
a few chosen pioneers
making history at world's end
but the all city would fall down!

Suddenly the torches shine
when the night has come
now I'm by your side
to hold back the strike

[Bridge:]
All king's men working for this cause
here in the middle of nothing...

[Chorus:]
Fire burns up the whole town
for me there's no turning back
revenge can be seen in their eyes
we are not much in this fight under siege
pray I for miracles pray for my fate!

The night goes on
there is no help there is no hope
we're losing faith there are no strengths
begin to think there is no escape!
suddenly a woman came out
and she took the blade
takes fate on her hands, withstand once
again
