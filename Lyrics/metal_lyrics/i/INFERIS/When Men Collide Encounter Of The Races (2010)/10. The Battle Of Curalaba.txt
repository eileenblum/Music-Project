When governor went out to war
To help the fortress of PurÃ©n
That month, December of that year,
On Curalaba
When (they) stop to rest
The others came at night
Behind the trees they're following the all troop
In the still of night

Pelentaro commands the attack
Eternal glory claim for himself

[Chorus:]
Vengeance, with anger they're
Stab the Spaniards
With a lance... and blood that night
Was written in the
Spanish files
In memories remains
The kingdom of the new extreme was lost!

Death tooks shine of governor's soul
Their send the arrow
Sign of the war!

[Chorus]
