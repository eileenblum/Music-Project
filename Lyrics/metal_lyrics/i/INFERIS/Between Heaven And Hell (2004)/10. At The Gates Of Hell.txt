[BONUS TRACK]

[L: Moran - Van Der Stam / M: Van Der Stam]

Tells the store of a man
Who tried to live alone
Thinking there was no one
And he turned us to believe...
Forcing us to fight
A war against his mad soul

[Bridge:]
Hear your voices screaming
Cause your precious time has gone
Now you find yourself alone

[Chorus:]
At the gates of hell
At the gates of hell

Now you cry on broken dreams
Sleep away the pain
Vaults on your mind
At the gates of hell he died
Forcing us to fight
A war against his mad soul

[Bridge:]
Hear the silence of the call
Cause your precious time has gone
Think your mad breath made your call

[Chorus:]
At the gates of hell
At the gates of hell

[Solo: Joshua]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
