[L: Contreras-Van Der Stam / M: Van Der Stam]

He fell in love with her smile
Another day to cry
Maybe she'll return

He won't taste her lips tonight
"My life is full of pain"
To look inside her eyes
Is to lose himself again

[Bridge:]
No one to feel, no one to say...
No one to see, no one to blame

[Chorus:]
I see her eyes
And her smile in the stars
I don't wanna
Miss her so much

I just wan't to live
So baby please take me back

The memories I cry
Between heaven and hell
There'll be no more tears
... you're not here anymore

[Bridge / Chorus x2]

[Solo: Joshua]
