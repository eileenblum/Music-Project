[L: Alarcon - Jorquera / M: Alarcon - Contreras - Van Der Stam]

Why do i have to kill you brother
In the senseless battle?
Time and again asking myself:
What am I doing here?

I see the children crying under
The weight of uncertain future
Grows a fear inside my chest
Despair and fear remains

[Chorus:]
Why did you leave me alone?
Fighting against my own daemons
That consume my heart
While around me
I see just pain

I rise my sight
And I feel the light
That fills my heart
From stars in the sky
And I wanna cry
For all that's left behind
In my life

All my friends making their lives
While I'm shooting the anger
Of another that's controlling
All of my life

Ripping fury strikes the battle
No man's land, just slaves and
Masters of a cruel destiny
That tears us apart

[Chorus]

[Solo: Joshua]
