[L: Contreras / M: Alarcon]

From the sea comes a breeze
And it's whisper: "come for me"
Those words in the sand...
They were written by your hands

"Trust in me I will be back
Through my eyes you'll see
Where I was at, I will stay with you
While you remember me and
Our love will set me free"

[Bridge:]
And I'm drowning in fear
It's been too many years
Maybe I should walk away
And escape from all this pain

[Chorus:]
Words in time fades away
Sorrow has taken my hope
And again I think, I know
That my life must come to an end
Without you it makes no sense

[Solo: Joshua / Felipe]

There's a shadow on the wall
I will not see it anymore
With this blade I will make
My pain come to an end

Now I fade and I see
Those shadows were for real
It was you in the night
Now I just can say goodbye

[Bridge / Chorus x2]
