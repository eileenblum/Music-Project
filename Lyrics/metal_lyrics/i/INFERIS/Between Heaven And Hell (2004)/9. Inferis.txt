[BONUS TRACK]

[Lyrics: Contreras - Van Der Stam / M: Van Der Stam]

Under these waters I see this World
We are all apart
Music has changed since the last time
We have come to take it back

Never surrender we are always fighting
The limits are stars in the sky
We are the keepers of legacy
Because metal is back

[Bridge:]
So we're still fighting for our love
No one can take this pain
You'll see...

I'm looking so deep inside of me
The memory that makes me feel
I see how this fire burns for us
Take the flame right with your hands

[Bridge:]

[Chorus:]
As the dust in the wind
As the wind in the trees
We will fight, we'll stand together
As the rain in the sky, as the stars in the night
We will go on forever...

[Solo: Joshua]

Under these waters...

[Chorus x2]
