When the end of times gets near
All my answers will be clear
I'll  be ready to my end
But I'm not going to die so easily
I'll raise my rusty sword

[Bridge:]
And I'll follow the horsemen in white
ï¿½cause my destiny has joined to their light
And I'll fight beside the almighty warriors
I'll see how they fall

[Chorus:]
Everybody here will die
The lightning storm comes
I can see the cities fall
Before my eyes

The angel of damnation
Is stealing our dreams
Everybody here will die
The lightning storm comes

When I look up to the sky
I see fate that comes to life
Just like the angels wrote
And now is time to pray for our lives
And as maybe it's not too late...

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Solo: Joshua]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
