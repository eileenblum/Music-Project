[m&amp;l: AlarcÃ³n / arrangement: Inferis]

Freeze cold blade
Spanish blood is on my hands
Look at me for one last time
(Cause) is the last face that you'll see

Swallow melted boiling gold
Is not that you came to looking for?
Thunders bolds and mountains explodes
As our gods rise form the south sea
Can you hear their cry?

Stand with me
Have no fear
Calm your heart
My little child
Ancients guards, the secrets
Arauco's strengths
Will shown again...

[Dan:]
Rise! Be proud and be strong
Proof that they're wrong
Show me the meaning of life

[Chorus:]
Fire and soul, tradition and blood
(run) through my veins
Hear my voice I want that you search on
My heart again
Pass of time
Will give me the reason and pride
Young brother be proud of your blood (cause)
We'll win thousand times

[Dan:]
War will be one and only way out!!

Rise! Be proud and be strong
Proof that they're wrong
Show me the meaning of life...

[Chorus]
