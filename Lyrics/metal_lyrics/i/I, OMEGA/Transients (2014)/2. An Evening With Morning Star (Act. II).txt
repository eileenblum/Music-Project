the executed have all moved on still I struggle in a shallow grave screaming at the impotent that put me here I am not whole from watching the soil spread solemn faces the earth embraces each grain represents every bit of doubt that spills out of me Iâm choking on the words that canât be released only rough skin remains where my mouth used to be it was condemned all the goddamn years ago when I still had pride call it off, call it off I have nothing to say If this bodyâs just a coffin I will choose when it lays Weâre all just dying to plot our graves serving ourselves a bit of grace on our own terms ignoring what weâve learned waste not what youâve earned I pray more than the faithful repent more than atoned Iâve been deemed a skeptic by every atheist I know yet I still canât find meaning in this world I mourn him as he wonât find worth eight eyes radiate desires of four hearts ever calling out two shoulders hold up the one burden they couldnât help burning up burning up thereâs a fire in me from a devil on my shoulder that seeks empathy protect the sinner fuck the saint not finding peace just disdain how can you say weâre meant to be this way when youâre living in an hourglass and you canât seem to find the time to change I refuse to go quietly if Iâm going to hell at least that means youâre in heaven holding her head and making excuses for a father who couldnât when I die I hope you see them picketing my funeral screaming at the top of their lungs at least then youâll know that they make the world a bitter place I left the world a better place to call home
