you left me hanging on the ropes but Iâm still swinging while the ref is begging me to choke dirty looks and bitter crowds signal the fight is fucking done. you best believe thereâs a war between I and me if that hasnât ended us better teach your fists to speak a little more thoroughly these gloves converse speaking tongues a stigmata stir syllables echo through arenas as teeth forget their roots round two eyes show through the black and blue Iâll taste fear in your sweat before youâll witness my final breath I wrapped my wrists with her colors I held them high and proud with her hands on his leg I watched her watch me from the crowd Iâm suffocating while Iâm waiting for the bell to ring this breathing commences when I see through your shattered teeth I took this match from a harlot called destiny alluded an inevitable knock out didnât specify whoâd be bleeding all I have to offer is a kidney or rupture spleen cause my fateâs still double dutching with my heart strings if this bloody canvas can be the stage for our disease Iâll gasp poetry to this stampeding heartbeat tap out when you comprehend loyalty Iâll respond when I reconcile with indifference if you work on holding your breath I will concentrate on thrusting every ounce of my distaste through the back of your head
