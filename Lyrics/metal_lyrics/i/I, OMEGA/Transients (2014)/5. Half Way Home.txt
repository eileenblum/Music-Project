the solace I find in your distant glow disintegrates as I neglect your throes as sheâs claiming my woes fully wasting youth in halfway homes gallivanting in gutters with the lowest of low if this pavement can lead Iâll trade my sight for taste and savor every ghost who canât recognize my face the open air has never felt so cold this cityâs embrace is all Iâve ever known If I fail please send my bones so my friends can see them worn from the road if left with these devices donât ask me to find my way back bartering stones for bread crumbs these wayward crows can count on me for that how the hell did I get here why am I bitter I followed the sounds of the bludgeoning chasing dreams when reality is a thousand miles away Iâve thrown away any hope of having a soul just ask the loved ones who I wasnât there for I used to call this life my home but houses never stand at the end of sorrow road when I die please take these bones and let them sink in the Ohio
