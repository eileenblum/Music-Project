itâs time to burn some bridges I just need a better flame when I strike my tongue on my teeth I canât guarantee a controlled blaze you say I need more fuel I got a handle on some skeletons hoarded in closets intended for pyromaniac obsession if you know these words sing out loud If I hear your song of sorrow Iâll stop right now I detest the silence I loathe the empty air Iâd trade everything to be enveloped in your condescending stare wrapped arms around sand torsos squeezed tighter than your resolve when the hurricane hits the shore dissipate just to say itâs not your fault board up the windows Iâll never leave this broken home Iâd die before Iâd give you up disregarding that you left long ago if you see me smile run like hell diabolical intentions always prevail just because Iâm sober doesnât mean youâre safer heroes are born from broken hearts villains die pretending theyâre fine when theyâre not if I could start a fire with a single word Iâd give it paragraphs just to watch it burn if I cause a spark just behind my teeth then letâs make a toast with gasoline youâre too busy spinning plates to ever be discreet laughing at gravity and spitting on the concrete Iâm too ashamed to recognize this game too proud look away as you go down in flames if your actions mean more than my words wave your arms letâs see those scars youâre out of breath cause you havenât moved be honest with yourself itâs the most you deserve be honest with yourself Itâs the least you can do
