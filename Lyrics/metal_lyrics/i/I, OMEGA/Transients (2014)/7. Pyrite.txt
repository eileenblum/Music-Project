all hail the queen of diamonds bow down to the king of dismay resting at the foot of disregard skin akin holds the will at bay happiness doesnât happen when itâs sleeping in anotherâs bed if Iâm here to bear your burdens then I am the Patron Saint of Bitterness I fought to taste your sweat breath on my neck a head on my chest count every moment at your fingertips before you let them slip focus youâre losing focus donât you dare take the attention from us if this night will be our last savor this moment keep your eyes open through the crash if pityâs required then Iâm the rebel breaking all the rules spent an entire life educating myself on how to play the fool you wonât atone for what youâve done bedposts notched deeper every time still I lay in these threadbare sheets the scent he left which you accept you know exactly what youâve done you failed to mention you gave up we swore to leap off of this cliff so forget to jump and settle for him you know exactly what youâve done, you failed to mention you gave up Iâll play the fool and take the plunge best regards from rock bottom Iâd rather watch you flirt with death than see you in the arms of a dead man who still doesnât know that heâs dead yet heâs too busy living on borrowed time doesnât see murder when itâs right in front of his eyes the doctor called in sick Dr. Love is a fucking bitch just pull the plug and weâll pretend that you did everything you could
