a masochist with a healthy fear of knives blindfolded cutting tendons screams at the top of his lungs as the crew holds a sigh I may be mad, but Iâm certain of the uncertainty so learn to with steer our failure and fill our sails for I am the royal we sirens soothing his fire with harmonic vows rocks calmly eviscerate this vessel as he takes no blame for himself darken my horizons waiting for your wake buried under shipwrecks loyalty will always lay if I hold my breath too long will I seal my fate this ship will meet bottom before it ports in disgrace storms up ahead cloud the eyes of our reckoning trust famished sharksâ agendas over this capsizing craft youâre piloting how can the traitorous dispute the lighthouse thatâs mocking me let fog roll like the heads across the deck youâre troubling can feel me underneath you can you hear me scratching through the hull every wave pleading my love Iâll pull every fucking board up just to welcome the flood. all hands on deck sheâll treat you sweet if youâre worth your salt all hands on deck weâve been waterlogged for far too long all hands on deck hellâs easy to find if youâre heading south all Hands on deck breathe the water in and pray to drown warm nights loving arms for rusted nails and colder dawns if this salted embrace holds true Iâd trade anything to hold course through you Just meet me at the bottom
