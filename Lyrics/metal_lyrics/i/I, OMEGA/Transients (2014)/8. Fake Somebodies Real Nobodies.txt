open on a man sitting on a stage captivating the audience with his grim face âThis is all your fault you just ignore the factsâ muttered as the triggerâs pulled and the audience laughs youâre too busy groveling at the hands that refused to feed us if vanity is all we have sit back relax this moment wonât last whatâs an artist to do when the entertainmentâs been compromised strapped to your seats eyes glued to a screen cognitive larceny pacifies five years Iâve laid in this trench hoping I could see you through it but this war only benefits the soldiers who surrender to gimmicks Iâm too busy hemorrhaging from every orifice I could give a fuck about where youâve been nor care when you desert us this moment wasnât meant to last to enjoy it while you can letâs take a minute to discuss all the places we wonât go the people who wonât hear us the success we wonât know you havenât any worth your art is pointless and thatâs coming from the guy whose point hasnât surfaced glory was made with tears sweat and blood you rescued the thirsty with piss in a jug Iâve come to terms with my obscurity I just hate to see my heroes accepting defeat
