We built these cells we locked them down with tongue and cheek please stand down now. Oh son you'll never believe it I feel alive since the first time. I've seen the sun walk quickly now before the night comes later every time that I hold your head under the realization that we're all calling out in hunger. The skin tight over knots and bones will ignite the fire set to destroy these homes oh how they run in horror. Goddamn this feeding monster before we all become one too. I scraped the blood from my nails with my tongue and teeth your marrow turned to longevity. I devour hearts still beating in hopes of the last image engrained in your eyes while be my sinister smile. Someone please call the butcher he can absolve us all. We'll stir the pot with your bones and steal the screams from your throat.
