I'll burn the masses to the fucking ground. I'll watch the trepidation take shape greedily savoring every reflection as your eyes begin to fade. You're safe now you won't feel a thing specifically my teeth as they rip through sinew and disbelief. I swore that I'd be accountable for counting out all the times that you were wrong with your heads held under water time stops as your heart falters. If we live to bleed then my veins are dry and empty you sucked them dry as you drank from my arteries. Our noble keepers are the worlds most foolish pawns they beg for your ears moving forward two steps then gone. We have nothing left more so nothing left to save you demand respect while striking the match against my teeth. I'm starving myself out of fear I'll never be human again. I swore that I'd be accountable for counting out all the times that you were wrong with your heads held user water time stops as your heart falters. If we live to bleed then my veins are dry and empty you sucked them dry as you drank from my arteries. The sweetened fangs of these snakes are keeping us here thirsty for their poison while they gently kiss your ear. I had the audacity speak of better times believe me that I've seen hell and you wouldn't last a day. I'm certain that all we'll have is a solitary death a eulogy written in sand while high tide pays it's respects.
