Watch martyrs fall and destroy our trust knees buckle as their limbs begin to rust while the meek are exonerated they say "these are fine, no need to evaluate." Throw them back you cowards or you'll be devoured don't you dare deviate. You had the nerve to spark the flame. Extinguishing it before the masses could tell the difference you had the nerve to spark the flame did you ever think that their arrogance would overcome you. Brandish golden smiles while you turn your cups onto disgrace while we caress out tongues soaking up what's left on the floor. We facilitate even though our principals are dead with an unmarked grave we keep their place with broken hands we hold our heads. I want the world's attention if only for a second to condemn you at the top of my lungs your standards have been questioned. We hold our hearts so they can stray the walls we've built will bend and break. What good is blood when the payments are passe passion has lost its worth and the players are un-phased. You had the nerve to spark the flame extinguishing it before the masses could tell the difference. You had the nerve to spark the flame. Did you ever think that their arrogance would overcome. This is a cattle call to every artist that dares don't conform to their confirmation. Don't relinquish your thoughts. I might lay down for a broken heart but I'll stand for a broken jaw your alibis haven't been acquired though they could save us all.
