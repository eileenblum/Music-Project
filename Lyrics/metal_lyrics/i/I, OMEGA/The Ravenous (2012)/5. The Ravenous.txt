Using our femurs as oars we pilot this vessel of flesh navigating with acrimony sacrificing while you digress. This downtrodden man has been staved by a culprit that we have created. Oh captain. I feel we made a great error for the mutiny has overcome us all you have not earned the right to sit at my table your muscles atrophied and your mind surely is not able. I feasted for fear that the famine I wore as a dinner jacket would display a truer shade of humility. We are the ones who let the tables clear licked every plate clean and drank every drop so the masses could adhere. We chose to turn passion into obsession we're here to feed and feed to breathe so the wretched can disagree.
These writhing piles of glorification can't fuel this murder machine but weathered hands that sketched plans will send letters from Hell. We are the ones who let the tables clear licked every plate clean and drank every drop so the masses could adhere. We chose to turn passion into obsession we're here to feed and feed to breathe so the wretched can disagree. I wrote this song while gnawing on the bones of my heroes flossing my teeth with their locks wearing their skin as robes. We are the ones who let the tables clear licked every plate clean and drank every drop so the masses could adhere. We chose to turn passion into obsession we're here to feed and feed to breathe so the wretched can disagree.
