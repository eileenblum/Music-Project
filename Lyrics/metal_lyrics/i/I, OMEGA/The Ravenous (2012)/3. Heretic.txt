I tear at these scars in my hands hoping the blood will warm and cleanse this red will sterilize the slate that I had to begin with three beggars arrived and brought forth to light this heresy grinning I sliced their throats and spoke through teeth "I know not what you speak."
I found my faith hanging on this door frame with legs kicking at the chair I'm holding inches away if I were God for only one day I'd protect those who were penitent and quietly looked away. You'll find me speaking to gravestones begging insight from the damned but taking the advice of the vultures perched of them.
I cradle my beliefs closer than most while water spills from your mouth. I keep my blood filled and closed. I found my faith hanging on this door frame with legs kicking at the chair I'm holding inches away. If I were God for only one day I'd protect those who were penitent and quietly looked away. The cancer that over takes us all is the ignorance we wear on our sleeves. Three beggars arrived and brought forth to light this heresy spilling their guts in the floor. I found them all to be as empty as me.
