Up above and so below
(Drifting us, into the beyond)
No escape route, only way out
(Is back from where you are from)
Go
(Fade away)
Fade away into to the past
Where it all started
Fade away
Just fade away

Separate
(Separate)
All the pieces inside
Before
(Before)
Before I lose my mind

Separate
(Separate)
All the pieces inside
Before
(Before)
Before I lose my mind

Up above and so below
(Drifting us, into the beyond)
When we all just
Fade away
Back from where we are from

I feel the pressure center rising
Separating
All
Points of
Weakness
(Weakness)

Separate
(Separate)
All the pieces inside
Before
(Before)
Before I lose my mind

Separate
All the pieces inside
Before
Before I lose my mind
