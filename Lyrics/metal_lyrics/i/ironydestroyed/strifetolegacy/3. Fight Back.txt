[Vocals by Lawlence Muchemi, Lenny Kiano]

You've reached the end of the line
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
You've taken it, hit by hit
With just one move up your sleeve,
Retreat, accepted it, heat by heat,
And now you're part of it,
Defeat.
Innocence bashed battered, beaten broken and damned
But what do I say,
Don't be a pussy!
Stand up for yourself, what do you have to loose?
With clenched fists, we'll take back what belongs to us
And I promise with every swing, we'll gain ground
Higher and higher.
Just bleeding out,
Get off the ground
Wipe the dirt off your face
It's time to face this
Just bleeding out,
Get up now,
And just like everything, life's a battlefield
It's all a game, a game of kill or be killed
Make up your mind and choose where you belong
With your head held high or with it in the dust,
Mtaka, Mtaka cha mvunguni sharti ainame,
Yeah!
Just bleeding out,
Get off the ground
Wipe the dirt off your face,
It's time to face this
Just bleeding out, you're not dead
You've the end of the line
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
It's time to ignite the fight,
Ignite the fight
