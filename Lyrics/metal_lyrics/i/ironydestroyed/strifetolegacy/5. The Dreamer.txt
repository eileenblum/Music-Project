[Vocals by Lawlence Muchemi, Skylar Lorena, Lenny Kiano]

We are, at war with reality
Supreme beings creating against all odds, just by a thread
we're holding on to chance,a path of the few
A path, a path of the Gods.
Thrashing crushing
All those who do not believe
In this machine
Obey! Or you will perish,
Like the rest who were here before yee,
In the lands of the dreams, where we all live
I create my own play, and you are just a piece in this game
A piece in this game, that is my life
Chasing the end of time,
Falling, crumbling you are not real
Same as everything, around me

I create, I create my reality
I choose, out of all possibilities
I create, I create my reality
I choose what is to be true
(Dream, sweet dreams)â¦
Eternal bliss.
The idea, is the construct
The all knowing power is the prime mover
The loyal maker of all that manifest, Before our eyes
We are all in the sea of casualties
And the tree of the selves of me
Now I clearly seeâ¦
I create, I create my reality
I choose out of all possibilities
What is to be true
(what is, to be, true)
I create, I create my reality
I choose what is to be true
