[Vocals by Lawlence Muchemi, Lennny Kiano]

Mirror, mirror on the stupid wall,
Why must I be the bully to fall
Stuck in the void, battling myself
Is this what I have been looking for?
Mirror, mirror on the fucking wall,
This barbaric savage I have become,

I beat on kids,
I whoop them helpless,
I love them weak,
I love them easy.

Who are you fooling,
Asked the mirror,
Am all alone, I have no friends,
Days spent by myself

Its not just not right,
The mirror says its cause,
I like to fight,
I am a bully,
The mirror is changing me

Rewiring my insides,
Rewiring my demeanor,

My reflections now flashing back at me
To plant a seed inside of me
Inside of me [2x]

The mirror has shown me poor
I'll change my ways and and start new days
The bully no more part of me
Dissolving the bully in me
Any bully can change.
