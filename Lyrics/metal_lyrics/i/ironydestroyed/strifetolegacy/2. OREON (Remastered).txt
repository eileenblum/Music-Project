And then it starts again,
Back to the place I once belonged,
Back to where it began,
Got to solve these undying questions
And then it starts again,
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
Sick and tired of jerking off with my own tears,
Got to solve these undying questions,
The thing that scares me the most,
Freaks me shitless to the core,
Is to see you in this form,
No one can save you now
The thing that scares me the most
Freaks me shitless to say the least
To see you in this form,
Your trap is collapsing!
This time, I will,
Not succumb,
To this defeat,
Of the mindâ¦.
Rewind the clock,
Kill the amnesia
Chain in the thought,
Rail it in to the eyes

I will never go,
Down with this ship

Through space and time,
I am forced to creep down this path
Of my sad and senseless life,

Just to be reborn,
My essence on a quest,
To save number one.
When the will is weak,
Even the broken will break
Rewind the clock,
Kill the amnesia
Chain in the thought,
Rail it in to the eyes
I will never go
Down with this ship
