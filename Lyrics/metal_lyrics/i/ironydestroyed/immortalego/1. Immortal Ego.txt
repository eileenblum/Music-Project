[feat. Lord SpikeHeart]Core!
Corrupted hearts with demon wills,
Disputing facts to nefarious ills,
My mind left this plane long ago,
Now all I'm left with is
Immortal ego,
For the first shall be the last,
And the future shall be the past,
What will become of your,
Castles of sand,
When you look back and you,
Can't understand, yeah,
Your saviours deceived you,
Your nemesis became you,
As the hours tumble into the black hole of the soul,
Oh,
Tumble
