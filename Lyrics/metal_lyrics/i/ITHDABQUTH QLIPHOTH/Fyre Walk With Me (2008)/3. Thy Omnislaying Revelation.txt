In ye Grief of defiled tomb
In ye fetus Torn from ye womb
In ye Shadows of all sinful lifes
Ye Secret of Thine Decimality lieth

In ye Blood of all Painful Wounds
In aroma of all Burning grounds
In ye Hammer that Smasheth angels'' chests
Enigma of Thine Septenarity reseth

... ..... .... ...

In ye Screams of Tormented whores
In ye scent of all Rancid Sores 
In ye Star of all Raging battles 
Ye Mystery of Thine Quaternarity settleh

In ye Terror of natural Disasters
In ye Madness of all earthly masters
In creator''s reversed name
Ye puzzles of Thine Quaternarity Flame 

In Desolation of Crowd of Gods 
Within ye Void of all wicked Lords
In ye Darkness of Uncertainty
Dwelleth ye Miracle of Thine Trinity

In ye giant heads with ye wings of bat
In Killing and Slaying with no regret
In every God''s Twin Menstrual Wine
Ye grim signs of Thine Duality Shine

In ye Crown of Hecatriel
In ye Venom of Samael
Beyond very essence of atom forbidden
Ye Evidence of Thine Black Unity hidden
Praise DEATH! Heil Satan!
