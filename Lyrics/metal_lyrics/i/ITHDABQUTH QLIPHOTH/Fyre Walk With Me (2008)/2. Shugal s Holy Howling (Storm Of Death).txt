My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart
and my lips shall utter Knowledge clearly

Call unto me and I will answer thee
and shew thee Great and Mighty things
which thou knowest not

The Curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked
but He Blesseth the habitation of the just
At the noise of the tumult the people fled
at the lifting up of Thyself the nations were scattered

O tell of His Might and sing of His Grace
Whose robe is the Light, Whose canopy space
His chariots of Wrath the Deep Thundercoulds form
And Dark is His path on the wings of the
Storm of Death

All his saints are in Thy hand
and they sat down at Thy feet
every one shall receive of Thy words

He that hath received His testimony
hath set to his seal
that God is true
