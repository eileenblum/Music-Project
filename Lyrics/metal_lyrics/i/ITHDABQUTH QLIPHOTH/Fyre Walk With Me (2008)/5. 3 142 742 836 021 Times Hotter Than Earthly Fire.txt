Supreme Beauty of Skinless Woe-man
Is left behind towards Prophet's Maw
In Aureola of Light before ×¦×××¦××
AL is CLEAR: EVERY THING is NO more

From Eternal Flame
To Eternal Flame
From Eternal Death
To Eternal Death

Embraced by Shining, Embraced by Blackness
That turns my bones to the fluids of steam
Defaced, silent
In ×××× × there's no mouth to scream.

The Shadow of the Shadow
of the Shadow of the Shadow
of the Shadow of the Shadow
Thy burnts are full Pain (Love)
The Shadow of the Shadow
of the Shadow of the Shadow
of the Shadow of the Shadow
Pathetic 'I' is Slain (Choose ye not the dove)

Inflame in us, LORD,
the Fyre of Thy Love
and the Flame of Eternal Devotion

Masturbate upon the ruins
of four watchtowers
by the Sickle of Sheolish
Primordial Flame
that is Sixty One raised
to the Seventh Power times
hotter than earthly Fire

Sinister Aroma of Buring Flesh
Is fascinating like first Succubate
Magnificent Odour of Burning Blood
Enchants like first Pig Sacrifice
