Succubus' Black Tongue
Penetrate my dreams of pain
All locks are liquid
Thou shalt obey once again
Divide in half
Lustful whore of death
Impurity is virtue
Betrayal is fidelity

To walk blindfold
Through the woods well known
Succubus' Black Tongue
Cut my fucking throat
Grim whirlwind of desires
Once hidden deep inside
Destroy all matter
Turn down all upside

Mystified and mortified
I have become
Since I've broken the enigma
Of Succubus' Black Tongue...

[Music by ADRAMELECH/AL-LA-ShT-ORR]
