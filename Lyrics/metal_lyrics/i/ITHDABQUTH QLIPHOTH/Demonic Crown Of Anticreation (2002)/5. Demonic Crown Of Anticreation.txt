Rise!

Nachiel, tear my heart out
For I must be the Blackest Sun
For I must shine as the Blackest Moon
The Priestess, suck all my lymph out
Extatical Flame of Pain
Cho my head off, Cursed Queen
I shall love the Blood of Moon
I shall love the Virgin Dead

Drown them in their blood
For they have sinned
Grant the human herd
Obliteration

May the scorpions die
After stinging my body
May the sun fade away
After shining on me
May all ashes return
To its primal state.
May my deeds and my thoughts
Slay all light within my soul.

No life shall ever touch
This scorched ground of sorrow
Unholy place where Ithdabquth Qliphoth
Reveals its unlight
Closer to world of flesh
And my Temple stands in Haitus.
Earth and water. Air and fire.
Die.

Oceans boil and soil is a flame.
Raining storm of molten lead.
Hail the coming of nonexistence.
Hail the end of space and time.

Hail the coming of nonexistence.
Hail the end of space and time.

[Music by ADRAMELECH]
