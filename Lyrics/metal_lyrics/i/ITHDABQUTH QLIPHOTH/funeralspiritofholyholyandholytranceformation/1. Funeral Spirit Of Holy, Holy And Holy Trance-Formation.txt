There is no being in the outermost Abyss,
but constant forms come forth from the nothingness of it.

Then the Devil of the Aethyr, that mighty Devil Chronozon,
crieth aloud,
Zazas, Zazas, Nasatanada Zasas.

I am the Master of Form, and from me all forms proceed.

I am I. I have shut myself, up from the spendthrifts, my gold is safe in my treasure-chamber,
and I have made every living thing my concubine, and none shall touch them, save only I.
And yet I am scorched, even while I shiver in the wind.
He hateth me and tormenteth me. He would have stolen me from myself,
but I shut myself up and mock at him, even while he plagueth me.
From me come leprosy and pox and plagues and cancer and cholera and the falling sickness.
Ah! I will reach up to the knees of Most High, and tear his phallus with my teeth,
and I will bray his testicles in a mortar, and make poison thereof, to slay the sons of men
