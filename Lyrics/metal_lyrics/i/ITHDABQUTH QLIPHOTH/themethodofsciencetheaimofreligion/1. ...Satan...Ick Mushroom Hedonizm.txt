Satan...ick mushroom hedonism
(am I not the father of time?)

Rejoice ye pure in heart
Your soul is our fucking slut
As we tear her apart
Rejoice ye pure in heart

In orgasm of the negative rheotaxis I fly
To reach ovicellian star at the wombick sky
There were millions of brothers
But they all were brutally slain
For the glory of my very first yet primordial pain

In orgasm of parturient canal's grip I drown
To usurp the heaviest lust of red lion's crown
They were billions in number
Black angels of mother Lilith
Dancing their magick dance
On the top of Naamah's clit

Cum on â dance!

Al I:13
Al II:62

In orgasm of the delicate velum's embrace I grow
For the holonomick disintegration must overflow
And my tail gushes forth with mosaic of axons and stems
As pile uses proudly vomit neurocytons' gems

SkaÅynajuÄysia Å­ arhazmach
SpakonvieÄnaje mudraÅci
NaÅ­prost spaÅcihaju
SapraÅ­dnuju reÄaisnaÅÄ
Jakoju joÅÄ pochva niabytu
Å¡to sparaÅ¾daje lipuÄy absurd
MinuÅ­Å¡Äyny I buduÄyni
Ci nia ja baÄka Äasu?
