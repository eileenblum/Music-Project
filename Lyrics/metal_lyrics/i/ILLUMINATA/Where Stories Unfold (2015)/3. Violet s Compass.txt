Whether it's going to die
The eye of the violet unfolds
Caressed and treasured in my heart
And given all the time to wither

The needle guides me
To a tiny spot of calmness
Amongst flower-swarms tender and sweet
Earnest and pure
At my feet clamour of blue
Craving for more and less

Whether it's going to die
The eye of the violet unfolds
Caressed and treasured in my heart
And given all the time to wither

Earth weeps just a tiny core of stillness
The sundown in your eyes a fragile light
At the entrance to your soul
At my feet clamour of blue
A single colour among all the greys

Whether it's going to die
The eye of the violet unfolds
Caressed and treasured in my heart
And given all the time to wither
Away again

The needle rested
Just for a while
We sang and danced and laughed
The music was the message

Whether it's going to die
The eye of the violet unfolds
Caressed and treasured in my heart
And given all the time to wither
Away again
