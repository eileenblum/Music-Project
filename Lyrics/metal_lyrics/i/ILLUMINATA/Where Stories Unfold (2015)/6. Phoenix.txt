Forever I've been one with the skies
Now dressed all in black and greys
All you can find in unseeing eyes
Are feeble tears of a dying blaze

Wings broke and hearts followed suit
As fire never dies alone

Hand in hand on embers we dance
Step by step through fire and flames
Shedding tears of cure and demise
Again and again from ashes we rise

I soared above the clouds with effortless grace
Carried by ambition and driven by desire
I fell dissolved in smoke and haze
A storm arose turn sparkles into fire

Wings broke and hearts followed suit
As fire never dies alone

Hand in hand on embers we dance
Step by step through fire and flames
Shedding tears of cure and demise
Again and again from ashes we rise

In embrace of nothingness and energy I opened my eyes
My skin sealed with the ash of time and memory
Bearing the mark of forever endeavour
As blood pump pale to colour the echoes of fading requiems urge
For the highest and lowest once more

Hand in hand on embers we dance
Step by step through fire and flames
Shedding tears of cure and demise
Again and again from ashes we rise

Hand in hand we walk through the flames
Again and again and perhaps to no end
With passion so real it is hard to control
Not better nor worse
Just different
