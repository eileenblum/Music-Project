BLUE SKIES
Once I knew a poet
We met between the lines
beneath domes of verse
so vast and sublime

walked me past gardens
adorned by flowers of youth
cast a trusting curtain
on future's stain on truth

From the rusting page
resounded songs of love
in a flutter the words
rose all around
and have fueled the embers since

It was the day I learned to live

Every piece a gift to life
unchain again the endless skies
We live the dearest hope
To leave but beauty in our fall

Once I met a painter
between the green and blue
A face lined like canvas
carved with joy and woe

As the colours trailed
Off into the dark
in gentle strokes
and the smiling eyes closed
for a world they had caressed so long

It was the day I learned to die

Every piece a gift to life
unchain again the endless skies
We live the dearest hope
To leave but beauty in our fall

SCORCHED EARTH
how profound are lines of idle dreams
What is the vain fool to the world
A child afraid of growing up
as wells of olden days run dry
all dreams will unpavel at dawn

THE INNER CIRCLE
I may have nothing else to show
than revelling in the flows of all
although too soon my time is high
I'll be beyond the curtain call
A dew-boin soul who learned to fly
and that is all I need to know
Flying upon a frozen sea
of souls cold and full of atrocity
hope to wake up afraid what will be
But is it a dream or reality?

Two fragile silhouettes closely embraced
their world hidden in a floating crystal ball
fulfilled with the greatest and purest gift of all
each crack mended by love

THE CORE
Every piece a gift to life
unchain again the endless skies
Though the world has showing us cold
in all our hearts the stories unfold

Blessed by weeping eyes we'll never see
a blessing dormant in you
