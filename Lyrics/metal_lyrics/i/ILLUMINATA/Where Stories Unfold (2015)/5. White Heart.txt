Thy grave upon this lovely cliff
With flowers all around
Oh how in life our anguish to
the beautiful is ever bound

From the day you left my side
I swore to laden skies
I shall find you again
and never left go

I walked to you so many night
as tears defeated sleep
your flickering flames within my heart
the only gifts I dare to keep

From the day you left my side
I swore to laden skies
I shall find you again
and never left go

As I travel into the dawn
and the sun sets on life
I shall only find peace
in the light of your eyes

At your eternal home
in evening's golden glow
I see and hear and breathe your soul
in everything I know
As the rolling waves return
and carry me to sea
I know we were blessed
and always will be
