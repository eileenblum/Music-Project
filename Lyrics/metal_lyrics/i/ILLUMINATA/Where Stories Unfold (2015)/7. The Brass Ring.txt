ENTRANCE

Again cracks open the colourful gaze
the box hums to a cheerful prance
while all around the dark joins fate
on arid vast in fatal dance

MENAGERIE

with the wild chase cross deserts and woods
under the sea and cut through the clouds
tossing and turning and laughter and burning
in a time of beautiful new and boring know

all darting senses in vivid, strange dreams
till eyes fall on the land and they fall on the lion
void of everything out wonder
a young soul opens and offers pure passion to all

BRASS RING

Our candles flickering seized by the spin
childish dreams torn over thrones within
from peaceful love lasting longer than we
springs ever a sparkle of hope for me

KING-HORSE

Then one day all the wonders would cease
in displays and levels behind glasses to please
the conscious masters are destined for keys
to a world unfolding piece after piece

So gallop along in holy crusades
act in your favour with flowers or blades
steer clear of sentimental charades
know right and know wrong and no other shades

BRASS RING

Our candles flickering seized by the spin
childish dreams torn over thrones within
from peaceful love lasting longer than we
springs ever a sparkle of hope for me

CHARIOT

Up atop the coach and two
racing over charred earth
surveying all things bound in rule
the earth and people as his tool

And nothing but an aged fool
yet still perhaps someday a man who'll
see the world for what it's worth
embracing nature life and you

BRASS RING

Our candles flickering seized by the spin
childish dreams torn over thrones within
from peaceful love lasting longer than we
springs ever a sparkle of hope for me

JUMPER

Wise heart which now the willow brushed
by love and reason sometimes hushed
It lived and grew in entropy
defying deformed symmetry

Where soul and body break their join
and no ones longing breaks the tide
on eyes once restless rests a coin
for the next elating ride

BRASS RING

Our candles flickering seized by the spin
childish dreams torn over thrones within
from peaceful love lasting longer than we
springs ever a sparkle of hope for me

EXIT

Thus is the way we all come and go
many in strive of gain and success
yet crown they will only remorses and woe
with a wish to have treasured more
- and less
