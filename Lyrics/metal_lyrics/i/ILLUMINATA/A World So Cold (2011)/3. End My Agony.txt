Could it really be the end of the line?
A way too short a tiny spark in time
Look back and cry over all the things undone

Open your eyes my fallen one
And leave your tears behind
They will be dried forevermore
This path leads to a better life
Come with me into the light
And I will heal your aching soul
Walk with me over blackened waters
To cleanse your fainting heart

Take my hand follow me
Draw a last breath and cease to be 
In life no one ever gets enough time
So bear a last farewell to all you leave behind

There would be so much to give (Heed not the blackbirdâs call)
Yet so much more there is to lose (For he is only pain and grief)
Regret (I am) your sins (eternity)
And hope for a clean cut

Have no fear of the world beyond
Everyone is bound to go 
After death there lies no threat
If you let go thereâs just ahead
In the darkness we unite
And fulfill your wildest dreams
I was chosen to guide your way
I am your precious memories

Raise my soul now 

Take my hand follow me
Draw a last breath and cease to be 
In life no one ever gets enough time
So bear a last farewell to all you leave behind

There is no heaven no hell to gain
One neither lives nor dies in vain
Thy beauty within constant fall
A paradise to bloom in all

Take my hand follow me
Draw a last breath and cease to be 
In life no one ever gets enough time
So bear a last farewell to all you leave behind
