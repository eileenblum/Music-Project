A flash of snow-white skin
A fatal kiss from bloody lips
A dream all dressed in innocence
Eyes forgiving every sin
Yet in nothing but eclipse
While on my grave delusions dance

A sleeping fool afraid to wake
A long dried eye shedding a tear while losing all a dreamer has

Deep inside my heart you hang upon a wall
Moments within a frame of beauty
Desperate love yet doomed to fall

Impression of your warming face
An easing for a bleeding heart
A memory to feast my eye
My heart and soul gone on a chase
Suffering from perfect art
Eternal hope to bleed me dry

I may not bear another night while nothing else Iâm longing for
Reality is my nightmare

Deep inside my heart you hang upon a wall
Moments within a frame of beauty
Desperate love yet doomed to fall

A rose to wither in the light
A love that wouldnât last a dawn
Holding hands through mortal bars

Deep inside my heart you hang upon a wall
Moments within a frame of beauty
Desperate love yet doomed to fall
