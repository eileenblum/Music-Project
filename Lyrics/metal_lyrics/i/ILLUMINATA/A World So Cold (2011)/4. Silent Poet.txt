Show me heavenâs melodies, gather me in your arms
Reaching out for immortality
A life to give to a dream above everything
Deserving all I ever have to give

Abandonment on you and I will fall too
Yet when Iâm giving in another part decays

A lonely soul, a life of warmth
Wandering on every path
Poetâs eyes on greater truth
Trapped in precious little loves

Show me lively fantasies and release me with your words
Guide me on across the battlefield
A life to treasure a warmth beyond everything
Deserving all I ever have to give

Abandonment on you and I will fall too
Yet when Iâm giving in another part decays

A lonely soul, a life of warmth
Wandering on every path
Poetâs eyes on greater truth
Trapped in precious little loves

Show me purest tenderness and steal a kiss from my lips
Take me from my insecurity
A life to give to a fire lighting everything
Deserving all I ever have to give

Possibilities, a painful urge to take them all
Treasures underneath, a painful greed to gain them all
Futures ahead, a painful will to live them all
The angels around me a painful need to love them all
