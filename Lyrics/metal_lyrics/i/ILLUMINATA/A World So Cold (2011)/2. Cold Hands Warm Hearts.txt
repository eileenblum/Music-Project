Countless worlds reflected in each diamond from an eye
That as the last one splashed and died forever ceased to cry
Sometimes I got up at night and gazed to the stars
Each like your wondering eyes without the weary years

All the white within your being
In the gentle wake of life
I feel your heart so close to mine
In a world too cold for me

Every moment that I crowned ended underneath the blade
Lowered in the downward spiral of the blind and the decayed
Saints burned in my arms and angels broke my heart
I hoped so many times just to see love die in vain

All the white within your being
In the gentle wake of life
I feel your heart so close to mine
In a world too cold for me

Let each new day be your first with silver linings on the sky
The shades of paradise to those who never let the fire die

Although too late the ghosts of my past fade away
You warmed my heart at last

All the white within your being
In the gentle wake of life
I feel your heart so close to mine
In a world too cold for me

At the end of disillusion
All the time waiting for you
In line with those hoping to see you again, someday
