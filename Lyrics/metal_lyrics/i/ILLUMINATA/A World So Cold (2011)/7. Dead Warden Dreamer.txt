The master of love yet a ruler of hate
To worship a life or sealing a fate

The slayer of hope leads the seeker astray
To open the chest and breakup the key

Indeed itâs the end of an infinite smile

Dead warden dreamer
Within a dark-hearted chest
Veiled obedient keeper
Let my eyes be greedy
Dead warden dreamer
Within a dark-sighted face
Sad unseen savior

The warden of dreams
Adheres me to my path
To find my deathbed
In his dark-hearted chest

We praise the land of horror, whereâs the future in tomorrow 
We raise the hand of God for what we hate in our existence
We leave the loved in sorrow, thereâs no future, no tomorrow
We bear hatred towards someone who once has played with our heartbeat

Dead warden dreamer
Within a dark-hearted chest
Veiled obedient keeper
Let my eyes be greedy
Dead warden dreamer
Within a dark-sighted face
Sad unseen savior

We are empty as our dreams, thereâs no hope, not for tomorrow
Our lies should bring us through the years that should have followed

Dead warden dreamer
Within a dark-hearted chest
Veiled obedient keeper
Let my eyes be greedy
Dead warden dreamer
Within a dark-sighted face
Sad unseen savior
