Upon a slowly closing book
A path to the fall, the end of it all
The lines laid out in dearest blood
Upon a golden moonâs descent
Once high, so bright in newborn light
Yet refused the eternal dance

A cloak of silence unfolds
Memory upholds the wounds

Our searing light and our debris
Our bloodshed and our mild caress
Our mercy and our cruelty
In black and white is endless

Upon moments of grace and bliss
A desire so strong to forever hold on
To a dream of eternal love

A cloak of silence now unfolds
Memory upholds the wounds

Our searing light and our debris
Our bloodshed and our mild caress
Our mercy and our cruelty
In black and white is endless

A cloak of silence covers all
Of tenderness and fatal thrall
A cloak of silence now unfolds
Memory upholds the wounds

Our searing light and our debris
Our bloodshed and our mild caress
Our mercy and our cruelty
In black and white is endless
