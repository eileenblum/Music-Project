It was like if the skies had kissed the earth to death
And if my soul opened widely up its wings
It was like if the wind had carried me away
Up to a silent star going bright before descent
It was like if I had been broken in twain
And it felt like every piece of me died

Serenades floated through empty air carried by eternal silence
Longing crawled right through me everywhere cooling from within

It was like if the moon had cheered the shades on dancing
And if my eyes could see through the darkness all around me
It was like if the fields had lost their lime-green shine
And all the purples and the reds had turned to grey

Serenades floated through empty air carried by eternal silence
Longing crawled right through me everywhere cooling from within

Once again my horizon ends

Singing a sad song waiting for so long
Leaving my old home I found myself alone

Serenades floated through empty air carried by eternal silence
Longing crawled right through me everywhere cooling from within
