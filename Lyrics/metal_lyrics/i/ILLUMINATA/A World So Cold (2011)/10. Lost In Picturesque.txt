I watch the sundown of my life
On these burning haunted plains
That once cared to make me smile
My utmost paradise on earth
I never gazed beyond the mountains
Guarding my scenery
And wandered the ruins of the past
Sharing with me their memory

In thoughts far way
To adore the sublime
Never reaching beyond
Lost in picturesque

A burden for the sense, a struggle without end to reach the final conscience
A flower for my love, blue roses high above promising the eternal

Sub specie aeternitatis
Temous edax rerum
Si moror, morior

A painful doubt igniting the being
Time is running towards the start
Drowned in need for the highest emotion
To rip my longing chest apart

In thoughts far way
To adore the sublime
Never reaching beyond
Lost in picturesque

A burden for the sense, a struggle without end to reach the final conscience
A flower for my love, blue roses high above promising the eternal

The torch in hand discreating my warming harbor
Nothing here to find to breathe fulfillment into me
The first timid steps towards a restless future
A journey far away beyond the margin into myself

Something around me to pull me further
Wandering on preying a distant treasure

Keep running along
To gain the sublime
Never reaching beyond
Lost in endless night

A burden for the sense, a struggle without end to reach the final conscience
A flower for my love, blue roses high above promising the eternal

Spirits will you hear me
I am here on my knees
I craved the infinite
You have taken all from me

Heed the flower blooming in you forevermore
