Now see what has become of us
And what has remained
You gave nothing to me
Except a moment of dead faint

I canât recall the feelings 
That I cannot show
No one yet believed me
With each goodbye I grow

The song in my head longed for a voice
Singing from the depths of my heart
A fragile line on the piano I wrote
Just to make the end complete

Seems like I have to take leave of you
To find you again
You played with masquerades I always knew
Every now and thenâ¦ now and then

Now see what has become of you
A jail without escape
This means nothing to me
An appearance of a fooling shape

Itâs the fate of mankind
That no one holds the truth
Yet the whit of what we share
Leads matters to its course
Iâm the despaired twilight
Seeing off the fading day
A world so cold, a world so dead
Is the place I have to stay

Time has stopped at the end of the world
Still a good place to end in smoke
For the ones trying to stem the tide
Though just a change can heal their souls

Seems like I have to take leave of you
To find you again
You played with masquerades I always knew
Every now and thenâ¦ now and then

Kiss my eyes 
And wipe away the dust of sleep
As in the first flutter of my sight
I see your familiar face
