Prayers to a gentle guardian echo through the air
I sadly treasure every word
Locked into a narrow lair
As the shepherd of your herd

Dependent souls and wonders to lift them up
I am but the spirit the cause flees with time

Just pull on a string 
Hope, hate, surrender bathing in the twisted splendor of another deceived king

Desperate pleas to a savage master dance within the wind
Hatred in each clouded stare
Raging of a world that sinned against a load it cannot bear

Fallen fools poured their blood on my hand
I was just created to turn the other cheek

Just pull on a string 
Hope, hate, surrender bathing in the twisted splendor of another deceived king
Flexible commandments gifts from a hallowed illusion

I am to blame for all cruel fates
I am to praise if fortune smiles
I am the one to bow my head
I am to stand up to all your lies

Forever a king with forced crown
Deliver me from evil

On my throne above the floods
And watching from a lonely sky
Iâd gladly give my heart to you
For one unexpected smile

Just pull on a string 
Hope, hate, surrender bathing in the twisted splendor of another deceived king
Just pull on a string
Greed, anger, vice bathing in the pure salvation raining from my sacrifice
