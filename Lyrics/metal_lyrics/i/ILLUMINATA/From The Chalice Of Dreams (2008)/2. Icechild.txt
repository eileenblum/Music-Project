I can't do anything...
I've lost the time and eternity... I don't have. 

She is standing here dressed all in white
dead eyes closed, skin covered with ice 
What does she long for?
Feeling the chill upon her face?
What do I long for?
Blinking my eyes to see the ruins of my life?

Seduce me, sweetheart, with crimson lies.
For the vanished and unheard
dreaming Icechild.
only loved when she's gone
searching a name for her withered home.

She is painting letters to lines carefully drawn
Makes up childhood games, gropes for toys missed for so long.
For the heart I once had?
The one beating in pain.
For the greed in her face?
And a man without a name.
