From the time when I changed
disturbed, greedy, dreary and dark
I was bloodthirsty and like a monstrosity
red eyes, burning, devilish and evil.

IÂ´m flying through the night in search of sacrifice,
creeping through woods with hope for finding someone,
my heart is bleeding with every bite and draft,
endlessly cursed with the dower to live deathless.

IÂ´m crouching under a tree waiting for the day light,
but this girl with the cloak recalls me into darkness,
when I see her neck, I become thirsty,
not after her blood but her body, her soul.

Your being accomplishes my heart with love,
your soul shows me the way to live.

IÂ´m stumbling through the night in search of her,
running through woods with hope for finding her again,
my heart is bleeding with every notion of a bite in her neck,
infinitely hexed with the gift to love forever.

Bring the life back to me, my love,
turn my being into something human.

In your arms I sense your love,
You fill me with humanity,
I feel your heart beating through my skin,
let us be together endlessly.

From the time when I saw her
mellow, greedy, thirsty and beloved
One bite in her delicate neck
my immortal heart, burning with eternal love.
