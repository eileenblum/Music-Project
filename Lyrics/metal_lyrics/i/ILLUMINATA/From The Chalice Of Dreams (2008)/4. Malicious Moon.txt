Nemus obscurus â Umbra crudelis
A frightened lad stumbles through a creepy forest
strepitus consternata â ventus mordicus
Biting cold pervades his fragile body and skin

Staturae exulatae  â Ocularis ruber arsi
Anguish and affliction curdles his blood slowly
Lupae frendere â viam intercludiunt
Hopelessly heÂ´s searching for a releasing way out

The reaper breathes down his neck
grins impishly fair in the face 
dashes his scythe sinisterly
Smells the childlike innocence

Portenti aggredientur â Luna plena lucida
Razor- sharp teeth biting into his flesh
Commutatio incepta - dolores indeprensi
The quest is over, he is the chosen one
