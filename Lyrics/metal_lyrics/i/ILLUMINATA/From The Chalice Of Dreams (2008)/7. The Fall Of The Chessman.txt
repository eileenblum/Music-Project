Breathe in the eternal being
Feel the air as it tries vainly
to lend me wings again
Inhale the boundless hope
beyond the fate of our mortality
just a joke for a shadow
Breathe out waive my being
a downfall into the abysm of my soul
dead is the dream obtaining us

Play yourself into divined heights
the valient knight as a sacrifice
masters hand moves a pawn to the end
the new queen shouts: "The King is dead!"

The one's still anathematized
off all the fields, black and white
Unfailing is the beauty of this kingly art
The one, the God of underland
rarely takes it to his hand
to arise lost souls to be unbanned.

Uncounted failured in attempt as victory seemed near
immersed into dark dephts of this baleful game.
More than a battle of wooden princess
more than just a sacrifice
pawn for light, knight for force
queen for heartfire, King's alive.

His lordship reaches in all directions
but lore wastes strengthness bittersweet
For all his wealth attached to throne
one step could be too less.

More than playing hide and seek
no-one dies on battlefield
give pawn for peace
rook for silence
queen for love
King's in check.

More than you have once believed
watch the grief on battlefield
give pawn for sweat
knight for fear, queen for love
and King for life.
