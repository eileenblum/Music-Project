Dropped in muddy cloaks
we're attempting to get
through this blustery night.

Evitare exitium
exanimare furia
effugere incendium
exanimare furia

Pretentious thunder clouds
ascending the dark canopy
ranging over our restless palls
Storm of life's arisen
but won't embrace our hearts
spreading our arms and shout
against the thunder

On our way to deliverance
our destination gets more and
more out of sight.
