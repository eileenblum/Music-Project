There's a dream that never died
It's coming back to haunt me
A fantasy of mine
Pure visions of a new world

Many miles I've traveled since
Through many different roads
Many stories I have told
But true dreams never die

They never die

Sometimes the heroes of our tales
become part of our lives
Deep in our hearts they live as idyllic fantasies
Sometimes the heroes of our tales
become part of our lives
Deep in our hearts they live as fantasies

The ghosts of the past

In the strange game of life
We can never tell who wins
We must always walk ahead
And never look behind

Now the future shines so bright
From a wide open sky
I know the wise man's speech
But memories won't fade and die
