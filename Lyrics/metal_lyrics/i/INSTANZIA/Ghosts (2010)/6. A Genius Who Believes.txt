A secret only known by an old scientist
No one would dare to believe
A masterplan to reach for the outer space
Is it insanity or genius?

They'd laugh and they'd never want to follow
No one would dare to trust
They quickly were proven wrong all he said was true
His ship will reach the stars

House or work
A dream on his mind
He'd never stop until he'd succeed

It's the dream of a man who wants to reach the stars
A genius who believes
The will of this man's unbreakable
He's a genius who believes

His plan quickly leaked then it brought jealousy
A scheme was to expect
The envious were prime to get his work for free
Now who will betray?
