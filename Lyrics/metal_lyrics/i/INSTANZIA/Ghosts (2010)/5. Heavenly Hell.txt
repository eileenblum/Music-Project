Here's a story of a dream gone bad
A tale of hate surrounded love
In this dream I believed a new world would come
to me

So many nice thoughts, so futile
I felt so full of faith
In this dream I believed a new world would come
to me

Then the whole world shifted shapes and hate
made its way
Their twisted minds kept telling evil lies

Then I tried to keep believing love's stronger
than hate
I hoped we'd reach our land of the free

Deep in my mind I knew that it was bound to fail
Some moments of illusion kept it alive

There's so much I regret, all the things I could
have done
I have been blind all that time
But now I know I should have followed my heart
Out of this Heavenly Hell

From the first day the battle was lost 'cause
narrow minds never surrender
We shouldn't have fought this war of lies

After years of closing our eyes the war had to end
We've never reached our land of the free
