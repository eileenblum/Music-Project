[Intro speech by Mike Prysner]

The war was raging all over the world
The Nazis were strong and unstoppable
Cross the land they killed with hate
Until the last foe alive

One day they needed to fight in the South
Hitler then looked for a wise and brave man
To defeat the British Commonwealth
Under the desert sun

Rommel was his name â he was a veteran
Born in November of 1891
Joined the army at eighteen
By his father he was forced

He served his country during the Great War
There he made his elite reputation
Honored with many high ranks
Praised for his strategies

There in Africa he became Hitler's favorite man
But deep inside he knew he fought for the wrong side

From battle to battle they fell at his feet
He kicked the Allies out of Lybia
But in Tobruk he was defeated
By Australian troops

He'd never stop fighting until he'd succeed
After three attempts the Axis finally won
Tobruk became a new victory
Egypt was next on the map

He was the Desert Fox
The unstoppable warrior with a heart of gold
When he could he spared lives

Desert Fox
The unstoppable warrior with a heart of gold
In history his own war will remain

El-Alamein was the decisive fight
There he lost twice 'gainst the British Commonwealth
The second time pulled him back
He then fought in Tunisia

There in the battle of Kasserine Pass
He fought and beat the American army
(that) was the last battle in the South
He then went back to the North

Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
Too many men were slaughtered here
To end this senseless massacre he knew
Hitler's ambition had to be stopped

Against their master they conspired
He and the enlightened ones
A masterplan was conceived
To put an end to this hell on Earth

All of the plan was found by the man
Their quest for peace was forced to stop
Vengeance, Hitler has to take
All these betrayers had to die

Once the favorite now the enemy
He had to pay like everyone
Either his family or himself
Had to die for what he's done

By the poison he died in October of 1944
By his fellows and his enemies
He'll be remembered as the Desert Fox
