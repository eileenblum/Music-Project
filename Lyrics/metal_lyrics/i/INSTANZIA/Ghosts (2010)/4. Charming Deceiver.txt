Your wicked mind struck once again
A promise to make a dream come true
My innocence fell for your lies
But no one can see through your angel eyes

I blindly put my trust in you
Like a child who gently holds his mother's hand

Your words had filled my heart with hope
Like the dawn of a new age
I dreamt of a journey to the stars
And had never seen the plan

You left me down all alone
With the deep wound of a broken dream
Now as the curtain falls I only wish I'll believe again

I crave to make you feel the same as I do
But those who can't lie can't fool liars
