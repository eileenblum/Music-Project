Something whispers my name
I answer but no one can hear

Picked up off the floor - thrown inside a door
See it close behind
Dim light on the walls - shadows in the halls
Ministry unkind

Minions walk alone - cataleptic drones
The eye is in the sky
Forever looking on - an endless sea of pawns
Clinging to a lie

Needle's sting I recognize
Staring down the barrel of eternity inside
Needle's caress - the horror dies
Staring down the barrel of eternity implied

Hands behind my back - cable with no slack
Noose is before me
So long I have fought detrimental thoughts
Tonight they claim victory

Needle pulls me from the dream
I still go on as do the screams
Needle's sting so far removed
Staring down the barrel of the debt that's been accrued

You have an invitation
To join me in the velvet darkness
Something calling your name
Don't answer, because it might hear
