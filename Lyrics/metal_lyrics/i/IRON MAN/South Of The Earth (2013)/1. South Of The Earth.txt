Sit alone here in the dark
And scratch the paint from the walls
Ringing deep inside my head
Is starting to splinter my skull
It resonates from below
And echoes mental stillbirth
Crawl myself to the source
To be with it south of the earth

Compassion trampled away
I'll laugh when it finally dies
Psychosis becomes my deliverance
Seduced by the truth in her lies
Born of the wrong kind of family
Too happy to pass on their curse
Pass me a shovel or spade
So I can bury them south of the earth

Usher yourself to my madness
The night man will show you a chair
Observe as I stare into space
Oh what am I watching out there
A face, a memory, illusion or dream
That's crying for all that its worth
Seeking redemption from jaws of contempt
Maybe its south of the earth

Seeking relief from the bonds of grief
Seeking the lie hidden in the belief
Seeking delight in the aftermath of blight
Could it be south of the earth
