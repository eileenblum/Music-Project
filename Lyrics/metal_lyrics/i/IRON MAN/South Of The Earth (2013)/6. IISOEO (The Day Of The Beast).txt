On the day of the beast the sun rose in the east
With a glow that just seemed wrong
He frowned at the sky and his heart said goodbye
To a home where he'd no more belong
The wind from the west had his weakness assessed
Lightning, thunder and rain
The bracing of foot was a hope burned to soot
The wind and the rain brought his bane

With valiant fight he rose to his might
In an effort to turn back the horde
Then in dismay it all washed away
Betrayal he'd feel evermore
Beaten and down he looked all around
The beast now blocked out the sun
His wounds open bled - spirit near dead
He realized the end had begun

In this year of the beast the sun dark in the east
With warmth that's remembered by none
He sits there alone with a heart turned to stone
As dreams fall away, one by one
The beginning has ended with force full intended
And trust that has withered away
The ending is here and now hope disappears
The beast has proclaimed disarray and pain
