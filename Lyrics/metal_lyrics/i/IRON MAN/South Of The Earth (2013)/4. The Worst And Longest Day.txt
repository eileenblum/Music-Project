Finally it's time at last - I have you back in my grasp
Cracks in your heart set free one most unholy seed
Your worst mistake, you see - you thought you'd defeated me
Now I've just one request - all that you love more or less

Laid to rest

Apart for these many years - I missed the sweet taste of your tears
I claim what's grown so cold - your dismembered, weakened,
broken, bloody, dying soul
Know that you'll never find a way to relieve your mind
Embrace the slow decay of your worst and longest day

I allowed you a taste of life so sweet
Bitter in your mouth going down as the horror repeats
I left you alone long enough for your guard to die...

Fall to your knees and pray - see if God will listen today
Silence - the final clue - He has forsaken you
Depths of my malignancy - drown in there eternally
The worst and longest day after day after day after day...
