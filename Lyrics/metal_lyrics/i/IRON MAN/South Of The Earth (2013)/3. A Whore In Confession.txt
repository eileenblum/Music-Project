There's a whore in confession - and a river of tears and blood to see
Try to drown the depression - take the edge from misery
Maybe learning a lesson - the price for a god to forgive a crime
There's a whore in confession - for the first and final time
Absolution raining down - retribution draining now

Raining down - so hard - so hard, those below it drown

The outpouring suppression - too much sin for one lone man to hear
Any chance of regression is torn away by dread and fear
Spilling out of aggression - self-hate for a life that's come undone
There's a whore in confession - tongue burning in the sun
Absolution washed away - execution wishing for a stay

Washed away - wishing - pleading
Begging, crying, dying, lying for another day

Bless me father, I have sinned - again and again and again
None to go and seven down - til I'm six, six, six in the ground

A lost war with obsession - the tears and blood pool on the floor
Just a single session can't purge this filthy whore
Hypocritical lesson - the flock just would not understand
This whore in confession holds a bible in his hands
Absolution gone to dust - scattered by the wind's disgust
