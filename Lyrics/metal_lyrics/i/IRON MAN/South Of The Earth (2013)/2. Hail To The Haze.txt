Hail to the hallucination - come here to placate
Slip into my mind where I'm confined and take me away
Hail to the sutures that stitch up an essence broken

But how much longer - how much longer
Hot much longer can they hold before they explode?
But how much longer - how much longer
How much longer can the strain conceal the pain?

Hail to unconsciousness - altered and benign
It cannot heal, but I can't feel so I don't care
Hail to the haze that comes to keep my demons at bay

But how much longer - how much longer
How much longer inside can this monstrosity hide?
But how much longer - how much longer
How much longer must I wait to release my hate?

Hail to the clarity - a hammer in my head
Confirmation of fears becomes so real and is congealed
Hail to the chemicals - ingest my final escape

But how much longer - how much longer
How much longer in this state will I be awake?
