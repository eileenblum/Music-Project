Cries rise from up the attic - abomination in a tomb
The curious would wish to look upon you
The keyhole would reveal an empty room
Are you smiling as you leave the house of Whateley
Escape the fifteen years you spent in there
Your first look at the Dunwich countryside
Footprints form but there is nothing there

Your lot in life - a plague unfurled
Passed down - wizard, brother, you unto the world

Cries are silenced 'neath the wreckage
Mercifully they're spared Cthulhu's call
A fortunate reprieve from Armageddon
Signed in blood when you crushed down the walls

Your father holds the key - your brother could not set him free
To open the door of time and space
Return where you were born - that cold dark winter 'morn
Bring the Old Ones to this place
His audience you seek - reunion on the peak
Eradicate mankind from Mother's face

Daylight breaks as you begin ascension
Watched in horror by a frightened town
They can't see you, but fix on your pursuers
Desperation as you're hunted down
A chemical discovered by your brother
Brings your form into the naked eye
Shattering the air with screams and terror
The incantation chanted makes you die
