Paradise awaits for those who will challenge their fate
Promised utopia looms - with agony ripe to consume
In its obscene bloom - in an unclean womb - to its foreseen doom

Road in front of me - stretched as far as I can see
Day and night become the same - looking on this landscape inflamed
Immersed in pain - enthralled with the game - such a shame

The sadists gather to catch a glance
Of pawns in rows who perform the dance
The thought of rest is a distant glow
A quick-fading memory of life long ago

Friends fall down and die - can't bring myself to cry
Wallow in mud to preserve the pace for the fools who deserve the race
Who deserve this place - who without a trace will dissolve in face

Long road's end in sight - pulling forward with all of my might
Crosshair watches til all is done - into the arms of the angel I run
Into her arms I run - into her arms I come - in the blazing sun

The sadists gather as paradise falls
Its implications are lost on them all
Too lulled into sleep to see past the disguise
And shedding no tears as paradise dies
