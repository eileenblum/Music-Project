A dreadful place--a dreadful man
All set to leave his little room
A world that looks the other way with blinders high
But they will know so much so soon

Apotheosis of reform was lost so long ago
A fuse that burned anticipating when it'd be let go
The skeptics will be taught what some have always known
In a wash of rage and blood we'll see how evil's grown

Destroyer then--so much more now
You can catch but you can't hold him
A heart that bled--the bastard's wrist was slapped
The faith in faith has turned so grim

The notion of remorse flat lined without a fight
Replaced by ideology burned in darkest night
The skeptics bow their heads as throats release a groan
The carnage on the walls spells out what now has grown

Itâs not alone

Aberrant beast we locked inside
Is walking out a full-fledged monster
All innocence has coughed and bled and died
Release paves way for a disaster

The novelty of change has washed away but not the blame
Responsibility seeks a home but goes unclaimed
The skeptics lock their doors to try to save their own
So painful--it is clear to see what we have grown

Now reap what ye have sown
