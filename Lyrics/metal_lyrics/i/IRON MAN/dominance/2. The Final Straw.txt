Daylight--maddening fantasy--last night never came
Blissful embers burn away
Coffin's sides are closing in--strained from the lack of air
Nightmares leave me with nothing

Like you--the mirror turned away--it can't stand the sight of me
I smash--smash it to the floor
Pieces reflect the shards of light--open my eyes
Epiphany of what I must do

I want to forgive but can't find a way
Lick clean the knife and spit away part of me
Broken--beaten--no understanding at all
The boiling results in the fatally placed final straw

I want to forget but the memory stays
Draining my being til an empty shell remains
Kill me--kill me--bleed me to quench your thirst
Now what would thrill me--for the torment to be reversed

Daylight fades as evening comes--the night's fingers grip
You're close--close enough to touch
Watching the source of my suffering standing alone
Silent--in darkness I follow you home
