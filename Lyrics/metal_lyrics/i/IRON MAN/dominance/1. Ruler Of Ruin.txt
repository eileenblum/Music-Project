Welcome friends, to my kingdom
Leave your dreams outside the door
Here where damnation reigns forevermore
A wound forever open
Enter if you might
Be dragged kicking and screaming into eternal night

Once I knew contentment
The gods began to resent
With heavy bows and arrows they shot me from cloud nine
Serenity abandoned me
Left eyes that could not see
What is left for me--broken ruined life

So come see what I do--and know that I'm a fool
My heartbeat and screams--the ruin that I rule

Minutes turn to hours turn to days--turn to years
I am just a fragment of what man has gone and deeded to himself

I pray that it isn't everlasting
I try--oh I try to believe
Slipping through exhausted fingers--my sanity betrays me
Component of the shattered landscape
That stretches to infinity
Time moves on and on--ridiculing me
