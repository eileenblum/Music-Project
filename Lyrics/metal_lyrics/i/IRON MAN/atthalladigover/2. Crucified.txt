I grow tired of praying to Heavenâs empty walls 
Rejection drains my spirit dry 
Once I believed it all would pass so far away 
Far into eternal sky

Once I believed the evil finally left my soul 
But it returned so bitter cold

I did not mean to kill the things I loved

Bring in the sinnerâwe want his blood 
Exacted as he begs for death 
Crying for salvationâhis hatred canât go on 
Exorcise his final breath 
His screaming rings of madnessâa mind enraged at war 
Desperate to have no more 
Sever his mad history and put to end his shame 
Cry for virgins turned to whores

We will watch this evil dieâa look of pleasure fills his eyes 
We will watch this evil dieâdrive home the nailâthe bastardâs crucified

Look upon the wicked then look into your soul 
This punishment is not ours to give 
Let him exist to be in agony 
Will curse him more to just let him live

Turn your back as evil criesâhe understands and cannot deny 
Turn your back as evil criesâjust walk awayâthe bastardâs crucified
