Wading through the quicksand to the grave
Fleeing life that's leaving me enslaved
With each step I'm more consumed
Downward spiralâfinal broken doom
Pitchforks, torches at my heels
Architects who mete out this ordeal
Becoming one with all the grime
Sinking in the quicksand one last time

In the quicksand to my knees
Suffocating this disease
Peaceful light so faint appears
Cuts the strings from my mad puppeteer
Hunters giving up the chase
So relieved to be rid of what they hate
They don't know upon this night
I'm clawing from the filth with all my might

Asinine to think that I'd just go
And let betrayal's seed take root and grow
Crush it dead to cast away
I am here to see it done on thisâthe final day

Judgment day

Are you scared of what has come for you
To call to task atrocities come true
At the endâeach take my hand
And come with me down to the sand
