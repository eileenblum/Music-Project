Stay away from the 7 deadly
They'll surely lead you astray
Don't mind the fact that man commits them, each and every day
Why is every great indulgence
Considered evil taboos
Restricting all of man's pleasures, a souls redemption he shall loose

[Chorus:]
Endulging, never languishin'
Exploit emotions within
Bearing sinister grin
SODDEN WITH SIN

Straight narrow minds that follow
These strict rules to obey
Fearing God; cardinal virtues, the soul is the highest price to pay
Committing 7 deadly sins
Ordaining the heavenly virtues
Damnation awaits the masses, for the actions that we now choose

[Chorus]

Pride in everything that you do
Envy others who have more than you
Greedy for earthly treasures, angry for not obtaining these pleasures
Lust the love that never gives back
Gluttonous soul, now turns to black
Man is sloth now accepting his fate, sodden with sin; it's too late

[Chorus]
