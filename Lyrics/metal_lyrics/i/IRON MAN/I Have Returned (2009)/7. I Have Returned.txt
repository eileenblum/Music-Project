They claimed I was gone, condemned and convicted
Ostracized, fate sealed tight
Resurrection the wise predicted
Overseen all Mankind, false idols pretended
Worship one, his only son
My Earthly reign never ended

Once Man was strong, the meek were protected
Now saturnine, sullen life
My teachings they rejected
Thy throne awaits for me, foretold by the profit
My rebirth, reclaim the Earth
And the universe that surrounds it

[Chorus]
The time has come to choose, wrong or right!
Will it be EVIL or DIVINE
Blackened darkness, Holy light
Chaotic fury, passive benign
...I Have Returned

I laugh as I cry, watching Man's demise
One and all, see them fall
Cutting their plights down to size
It's Man's right to choose, unbeknownst by me
To seek delight, or careless fight
Their own masters of their destiny

[Chorus]
[Lead]
[Chorus]

Your future lies with me, gates gold and pearl
Angelic choir, Holy desire
Where peace and love are eternal
Armies rise from the sea, 7 crowned headed whore
Creating war, on every shore
Until Man exists no more... I have returned... I have returned
