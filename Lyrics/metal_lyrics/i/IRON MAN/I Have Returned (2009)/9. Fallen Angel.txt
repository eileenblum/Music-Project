On the day, I believed my life would change
When you descended unto me
Thought you to be, a gift from above
Oh how I was deceived

I can't believe, I loved something evil
You were once my guiding light
Spoken actions, that promised only lies
Devil creature with angel's hide

[Chorus:]
You crowned me king, and to my surprise
Pulled the world from under me
You fell from the heavens to become my demise
You're my fallen angel

Promised eternal life, caring from the heart
Why was I too blind to see
Now I'm salvaging my world fallen apart
From the arrows you Aim ed at Mee

Time now has healed, most of my scars
But the pain still dwells within
Arriving unto me, an angelic entity
Departing a demons lust for sin
