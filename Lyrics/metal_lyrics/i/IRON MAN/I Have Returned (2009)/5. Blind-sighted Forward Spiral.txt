Full throttle, accepting my fate
Any unknown horrors to come
'Cause for me, grandeur awaits
Accepting all, won't settle for some
Never watching where I walk
My life's always been a coin toss
Dead dreams, outlined in chalk
Less regrets, for things that I've lost

[Chorus:]
I'm on a blind-sighted forward spiral
I'm on a blind-sighted forward spiral

Won't take no, for an answer
Blazing fire coursing through my veins
Scarring past, looms like a cancer
Razor blades slicing through my brain
Pressing onward, no time to look back
Not realizing, any misguided turns
Assimilation, for things I lack
Surviving pain, the only way I learn

[Chorus]

Absurd passions, engine fed by steam
Spirit charged, solar powered might
Many times, lead a solo team
Chasing taboos, clear conscience I fight
Skin weathered, my frame so weak
Heart is empty, perished soul shall burn
Blind-sighted, yet still I shall seek
Forward spiral, I shall never return
