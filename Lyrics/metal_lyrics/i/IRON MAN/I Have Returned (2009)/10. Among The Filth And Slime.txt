Breeding in the dust and grime, spawned since the dawn of time
Lusting hunger for gold and power, life around turns bitter sour
Practice the laws that they preach
Life sucking social leech
Twisting the laws that they make
So easily choose, the ones they break
Attorneys, politicians, and clergy, all decide what's right for me
Their flesh is bought so easily, all hail, praise the god money

[Chorus:]
I can't believe, what fools we are
Allowing them to reign, this long so far
Their true nature, will show with time
As for now we live among ... the filth and slime

Poisoned breath with restricting hold,
Forcing lives into a mold
Made to play their corrupt game, only ourselves we can blame
Delusional talk can surely deceive
Make you think what they believe
Altered words, supreme command
Iron fisted heavy hand
Attorneys, politicians, and clergy, all decide what's right for me
Their flesh is bought so easily, all hail, praise the god money

[Chorus]

Creating more of their kind,
Spreading their diseased crazed minds
Masking lies with fantasy, choking truth becomes reality
Spewing forth their lusting brain
Considered genius, now quite insane
Loathing stench of their hide
Scum and villainy, you must abide
Attorneys, politicians, and clergy, all decide what's right for me
Their flesh is bought so easily, all hail, praise the god money

[Chorus]
