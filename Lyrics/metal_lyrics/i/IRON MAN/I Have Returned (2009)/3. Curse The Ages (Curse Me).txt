Curse the ages, time spent on this earth
All False hopes, since the day of my birth
Curse the reasons, what should and shouldn't be
And all that is divine, the one who's cursed is me

Stubborn, like a mountain side
In you, I won't confide
knock down, merits you earn
Cast out, lazy will to learn
Imprisoned, like brain to skull
Implode, no self control
never see, pitfalls under feet
Won't accept, the goodness cursed on thee

Curse the patterns, showing cause for alarm
And the souls, that have always done me harm
Curse conditions, that molded minds this way
The cries and screams, unheard for another day

Why search for things untrue
Only one cursed is wretched you
Cursing others, and placing blame
You're the one, who lives in shame

Won't Stand up, and get in line
Narrow Minded for the asinine
Your self army, is only one strong
Lonely life, for you is too long

Stubborn, like a mountain side
In you, I won't confide
knock down, merits you earn
Cast out, lazy will to learn... [overlapped by "CURSE THE AGES..CURSE ME"]

Imprisoned, like brain to skull
Implode, no self control
never see, pitfalls under feet
Won't accept, the goodness cursed on thee ... [overlapped by "CURSE THE AGES..CURSE ME"]
