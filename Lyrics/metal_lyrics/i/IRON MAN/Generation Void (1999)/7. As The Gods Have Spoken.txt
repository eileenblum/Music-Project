Our time has come, oh can't you see
The skies have burst, where have we gone wrong
There's a rainbow, forming on the horizon
At the end, is a pot of gold

As the gods have spoken, a disciple is chosen
As the gods have spoken, youâre in a cloud of dust
My friend

Fame and fortune, is on the table
It's ours to take, not a minute too late
Not far away, within our reach
The final glory, that we see

As the gods have spoken a disciple is chosen
As the gods have spoken there is not time to wait
