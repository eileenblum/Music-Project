Where have we gone yesterday
Where will we be tomorrow
What lies straight ahead of us
Just cut the cards and place your bet

Skyscrapers standing all so tall
In a short time they all will fall
Enter a brand new universe
Overwhelmed by the new technology

Feel the thunder, shake the ground
Buildings are crumbling, just take a good look around
See the fire, in the sky, that's when itâs over, now it's
Your time to die
Look to the oceans, see them rising
A wall of waves will keep washing the filth away

Take my hand my children, and walk with me
Your life has just begun, oh can't you see
He'll lead us on, living for another day
Searching for a purpose, in the generation void
