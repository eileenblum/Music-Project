She is home for demons and evil spirits
She is unclean and dirty
All nations have drank from her wine

I heard a voice from above, come out my people
For her signs are all piled up
Give back to her as she has given

She is forever yours, no, no, no
Sheâll be forever yours, no, no, no

As a queen sheâs not a widow
From the throne she never will mourn
See the smoke of the burning city
Dust is thrown on top of their heads

She is forever yours
(Babylon) no, no, no
