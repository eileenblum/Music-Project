The evil one, he's back in town
He's come to take your soul
Where does he live, where does he walk, does anybody know?

On dark streets, in back alleys
He'll put 'em in the sheets
The man is fear, the man is death
He's Satan's only son

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
He's coming after you
On his tongue, he'll taste your blood, the knife is slicing through
Time again, and time again he'll find another kill
The police and their detectives are always stumped

One by one, as they come, they will always go
He's always lurking in the shadows just waiting for you
His lust is blood and killing fun
He's the Boston Strangler

On dark streets, in back alleys
He'll put 'em in the sheets
The man is fear, the man is death
He's Satan's only son

One by one, as they come, they will always go
He's always lurking in the shadows just waiting for you
His lust is blood and killing fun
He's the Boston Strangler
