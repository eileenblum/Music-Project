Take my spirit far away, look for a new day
Good times of the past, they never seem to last
Memories are all that is left, of the broken dreams
That we had. The promises that we made, were all in vain, In Vain
Now it's time to hold the line, take control of your destiny
Seasons come and seasons go, life is never ending
When you hit rock bottom, you have to get up again
Just keep moving on from town to town

Winds of change are coming our way, nothing ever stays the same
What the future holds itâs up to you to dream
In the beginning there always was war
There will be war again very soon - - again, again

Fight it back with a vengeance, never let them hold you back
Push is to the limit - you know you can
Winds of change are coming our way
Nothing ever stays the same
What the future holds, it's up to you
To dream To dream
Riding on the winds of change
