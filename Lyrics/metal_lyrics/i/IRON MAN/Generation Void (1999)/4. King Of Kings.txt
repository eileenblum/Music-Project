His name was Alexander he was the king
Of Macedonia one	of the greatest generals of war
He conquered what was the civilized world

Oh, marching across untamed land
Oh, they would die by his sword
Next was the conquest of Persia an army of 35,000 men
He gambled on a quick victory the Persians they died
Where they had stood

Oh - They would die by his sword
Oh - He is the king of kings

He is the king of all kings, his name is Alexander The Great
He was the king of all kings, his name will live on for infamy

On to Egypt he made his home
He was christened the son of God
Onward toward India, this would be his last victory

Oh He is the King of Kings
Oh His name was Alexander the Great
