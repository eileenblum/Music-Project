What do you see that lies ahead of you
Listen to the forest and youâll hear the echoes call
Following the trail you are bound to feel tall
Do you understand where we'll all be going to

On the mountain we shall survive
On the mountain conquest we'll find

Travelling this land there are many paths to take
Feel it in your heart an there will be no mistake
Blazing a trail there is fire in your eyes
Looking to the distance you can see the eagle soar

On the mountain we shall survive
On the mountain conquest we'll find

Climbing ever higher there is magic in the air
The wind is blowing hard as it flows through your hair
The final resting place is straight ahead of you
Youâre on the mountain and youâve done all you could do

On the mountain we shall survive
On the mountain conquest we'll find
