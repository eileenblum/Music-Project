Living in a wasteland, it's all in his mind
Taking care of business is what he's gonna do
Looking to the future, only time will tell
Recognize extinction, then we might exist

He is a survivor, in his own mind
He will surmise
Taking great pride in staying alive, strong focus on
Life leaves death behind

They're beating down your back door, itâs what
You can expect, ya gotta take cover if youâre
To survive
Your back on the run, get yourself a gun
It's a tricky situation, time to take control
