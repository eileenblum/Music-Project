When the thousand years are over
He will come to life
Satan is released from his prison
To destroy this world
He will deceive all nations
Of all corners of earth
Then fire came down from heaven

He is the false one upon us
He will be destroyed again
They like to call him the devil
He will never win - No way -

There was a lake of burning sulphur
Where the beast had been
Then another book was opened
It was the book of life
The sea gave up the dead that were in it
Then each person was judged
Then the lake of fire had erupted

The sun exploded in the sky
There was fire everywhere
The earth was shaking violently
And the cracks soon did appear
Where the rivers once did flow
They drained out to the sea
The time has come, the time is near
For the harvest of earth
Harvest of earth
