What are all these problems
That we are faced with now
Too many people
Inheriting this world
Man is looking for the answer
But it's nowhere to be found
The final solution
Lies beneath the ground

Nuclear Weapons
Designed to kill
Where are we going
Where have we been
Evil minds plot destruction
Killing next of kin
The time has come the time is near
How long do we have

The end of the world
The end of the world
