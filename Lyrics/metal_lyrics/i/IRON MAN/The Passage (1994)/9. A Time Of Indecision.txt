Now that. The final day is near
What do you always want to hear
Do you always close your eyes
And just guess what you might find

Progress is moving ever so fast
How long will this world last
Billions of dollars are spent on war
We have enough weapons yet, we want more

A time of indecision is upon us now
The choices we make are the ones that count
They must hear what we all know
The people at the top will have to set the goal

The government is playing games on us
Now who the hell can we trust
every time that you turn around
They'll stab you in the back when you are down

All this has got to change
People everywhere must rearrange
Our time will come and it will be soon
It won't be too long
Until they rest inside their tomb

A time of indecision
