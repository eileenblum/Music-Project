What in the world have they done
Look around what do you see
Will tomorrow hold the answer
Can we unlock the key

Now the journey's just beginning
We are breaking free
Now it's time we asked the question
Why does all this have to be

The one who seeks is the one who finds
Those that speak they are not blind
The road is long and narrow
Open your eyes and find the way

What do you think they're gonna be doing
When you tell them that they're totally wrong
Don't they see what's going on around them

This time they just took it too far
People living in the white house
Always trying to make a new law
Can't they see that it's not working
This had better be their alarm
