You're standing there with your hand to the sky
Reach for the sun and then you shall fly
Look to the skies and there you shall find
A world beyond the one you've known

As tall as a mountain, loud as thunder
Power like lightning, black as the night
Clouds in the distance, sky's turning dark
Time to get ready for the next attack
Strong as steel, bends like water
Hot as fire, clear as glass
When the sun shines, you'll see the light
Then the clouds break, the storm is over

Hell is often a truth seen too late
On wings of steel we'll ride through the night
The final day is coming to near
Coming on strong well take it all the way
