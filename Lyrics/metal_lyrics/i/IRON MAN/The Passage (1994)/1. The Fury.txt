Ride on into the night
Smoke and fire drowns the light
With eyes of fire, a head with many crowns
He has a name, but no one knows

The armies of the world prepare for battle
His sword will strike all nations down
He is the one who would be king

Come together for the supper of the beast
What once was will never be
On the mountain stands a white horse
The wrath of God is spilling out

On and on, it happens again
Can't stop this dream, what does it mean
Calling out one final shout
With one last breath we meet our death

God help us now
