The beginning of the day starts so early
They're getting prepared for the journey
All systems are go for the take-off

The engines roar into the skies
They soar - Fighting for freedom
They're fighting for the cause
Across the sea, over another land
Victory guaranteed, united they stand

Bombs are exploding, down below
People are running everywhere
The mission successful, they move on

Back across the sea, they return
Flying in formation, they are proud
Freedom is preserved for another day

Freedom fighters fly high in the sky
gliding on the wind, they're traveling
At great speed - waiting for the call
They're ready to serve
Where freedom fighters go
The opponent will fall
