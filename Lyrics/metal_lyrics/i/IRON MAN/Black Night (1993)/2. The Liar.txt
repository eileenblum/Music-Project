The dreams have all come home
The emotion is shared by one
The draft if all I feel
But the skin is what I see

Iâm destined for loneliness
Thereâll be no change
Where is the sunshine
Iâm involved in pain

My friend came for some fun
We drank together but were alone
His eyes were focused on her shine
While I tried to dissect her mind

He was caught in her spell
The shakes and lumps moved him
Immune to all her charms
Already sinnedâ¦
Returned to the lair
Never living for my share
They know a wretched soul
And work hard for the dough
Future is written here
Love will never be
Souls left behind
Never able to please
