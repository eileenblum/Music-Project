The time is now
To change the world
Tell the whole truth, money is power
All we do see, total havoc
All we can feel, retribution

We all count, we all feel

Too much change, has ruled the sea
Money rules, this damn earth
Hold on tight, find a cure

Filling the clean air
With gas and flames
Filling the blue sea
With trash that maims
The soft green earth, gone all to hell
Wake up, right now make a stand

Donât change the world
Clean air to breath
Donât changeâ¦

Donât want to fight, but it does hurt
Now end in sight, have to learn
Want a small child, to feel real safe
No Lukeâs hot fire, no rat race
