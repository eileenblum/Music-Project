How can the blockades go on
Human flesh halting our freedom
One side calls it murder
No regrets to ones future
Coat hangers and alley tragic
No time to turn back now

Marchers in the streets from both sides
Both claiming to be right
I believe in one voice
Itâs really her own choice

Yeah

Time to end this debate
Get away from all this hate
I believe in one voice
Itâs really her own choice

Yeah
