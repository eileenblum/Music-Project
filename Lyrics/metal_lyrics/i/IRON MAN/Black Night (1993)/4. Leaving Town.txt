Walking down the main street
Looking for some action
Feeling lonely and beat
Got no satisfaction
I hear some heels moving
In my direction
The face I see fills me with affection

I have to make my move fast
For the wolves are stalking out
Pull her to the clear
And get the hell out of here

Leaving town, beautiful lady
One true love,
Leave this fucking town

She makes my blood boil right to the top
Her body is so fine, very very hot
I change my life for her beautiful face
And in midstream change
My own fate

We race down the main street
Try to find
A place to hide
We find a deserted corner
And start making love

Leaving town, beautiful lady
One true love,
Leave this fucking town

Now that life has come to change
I know I didnât make a mistake
Mother, father believe what I say
Love is all that took me away

When my fawn looks in my eyes
I see the future and itâs very bright
Hold my hand and you shall see
True love is what we all should seek
