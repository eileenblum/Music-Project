Youâre sitting in a corner
Alone as I am
The pit of my stomach feels
And sadness always there

All I wish, to see from you
A chance to be your friend
We donât have to push, so very hard
Just remove these awful chains

Listening to you, so far away
I can see right through your eyes
Feeling you, from such a pray
I know this could be right

All I wish, to see from you
A chance to be your friend
We donât have to push, so very hard
Just remove these awful chains

I hope he comes, to rescue you
Iâm not trying to contain you
Maybe weâll meet and get to speak
Just wake up, listen and see me

All I wish, to see from you
A chance to be your friend
We donât have to push, so very hard
Just remove these awful chains
