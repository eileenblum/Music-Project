Sharp as the blade to skin
I canât resist those deadly pins
Smoke fills my fallen lungs
To my death I have plunged

Ice pick has sliced my heart
Devilâs blood, not too smart
No easy way to go
My lifeâs end I have chosen

Itâs crept into my mind
Poison has made me blind
Terror has ripped my soul
The blood the final tollâ¦the blood
The final toll

Evil is in my head
It says I should be dead
The cold and big dark clouds
The heat his deadly roundsâ¦the
Heat his deadly roundsâ¦yeah
