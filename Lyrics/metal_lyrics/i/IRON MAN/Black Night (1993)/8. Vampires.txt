Vision of black clouds
White powder on glass
Two teeth making power
As time disappears

My brother is alone
Women by his side
Sucking life heâs known
Nowhere to hide

People dealing all night
Sleeping their lives away
Turning fragments of light
Never knowing what game to play

A tin can is all you need
Some ash to fill that hole
First toke you feel free
First puff ainât no joke

Hanging upside down
Donât expect to fall
Powder turns you around
No one hears your call

10 piece seems safe
Hey that felt good
Increase buzz to my pace
Pain thatâs understood

A tin can is all you need
Some ash to fill that hole
First toke you feel free
First puff ainât no joke

Like rats in the dark
Steal another personâs soul
No chance make a mark
Never knowing home
Donât sink this low
Itâs hard to recover
Live life kind of slow, clear minds
Donât need cover
