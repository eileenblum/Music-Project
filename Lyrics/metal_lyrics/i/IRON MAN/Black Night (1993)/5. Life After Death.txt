Is there life after death
Do we all disappear
I hope I turn into flames
Hot fire drown out fear

Do we live? Can we die?
Do we live? Can we die?

There has to be more light
At least release my mind
Maybe the soul will grow
To learn whatâs really love

Nobody can find the way
Maybe itâs part of earth
Donât have nothing to say
Parts made up grass and dirt

Is there life? After death!
Is there life? After death!
