Full throttle , accepting my fate
Any unknown horrors to come
âCause for me , grandeur awaits
Accepting all , wonât settle for some
Never watching where I walk
My lifeâs always been a coin toss
Dead dreams , outlined in chalk
Less regrets , for things that Iâve lost

[Chorus:]
Iâm on a blind-sighted forward spiral
Iâm on a blind-sighted forward spiral

Wonât take no , for an answer
Blazing fire coursing through my veins
Scarring past , looms like a cancer
Razor blades slicing through my brain
Pressing onward , no time to look back
Not realizing , any misguided turns
Assimilation , for things I lack
Surviving pain , the only way I learn

[Chorus]

Absurd passions , engine fed by steam
Spirit charged , solar powered might
Many times , lead a solo team
Chasing taboos , clear conscience I fight
Skin weathered , my frame so weak
Heart is empty , perished soul shall burn
Blind-sighted , yet still I shall seek
Forward spiral , I shall never return
