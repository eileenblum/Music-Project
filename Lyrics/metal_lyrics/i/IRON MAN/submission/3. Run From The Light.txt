As we are told, to enter heaven's divine
Repent and rapture, you must go into the light
Stray from a beaten path, remorse for all your sins
Icons at the gates, will surely let you in

[Chorus:]
Caution deception, that burns so bright
Heed thy warning, and run from the light

Cowering in darkness, when death brings us the end
Awaiting the afterlife, one's faith does pretend
Merciful and righteous, you'll reap the great rewards
Immortal in bliss, Reign eternal forever more

[Chorus:]
Caution deception, that burns so bright
Heed thy warning, and run from the light
Welcomed temptations, you now must fight
Saving your soul, run from the light

Such a surprise, when you think you've saved your soul
Such a demise, after death you realize there is no goal
Striving for the now, gleaming future glows so ever bright
Preservation of one's self, for this is the only light

If we are to suffer, when choosing what is right
Then why so easy, to always find the light
Living hell on Earth, to gain a holy desire
Forewarned that light, is also caused by fire

[Chorus:]
Run from the light ...run from the light... run from the light
