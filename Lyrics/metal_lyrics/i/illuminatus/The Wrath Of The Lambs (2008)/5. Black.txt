The blackened whisper of the rain
Burns the memories black
You don't see it now
You don't realise
But you're fading out

It all comes back to you in the end
But how did we end up this way?
You don't see it now
You don't realise
But you're fading out

I was planning by revenge
But these poisoned words are meaningless
But there is so much left to say
That you disappoint me
That I will not forget
I will not forget
That I will not forgive you
That I understand
