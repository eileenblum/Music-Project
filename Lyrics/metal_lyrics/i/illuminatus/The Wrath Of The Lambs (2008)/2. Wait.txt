As you secretly plan your escape
From you world without fences that you fought so hard to defend
You watch the highway below
The silent breadlines of civilised men
As you cling to the edge of a dead Monday

Every town looks the same
It's just the streets that have different names
It's the infinite sadness of parallel lines
It's the shade in your eyes
We're not meant to be living this way

You watch as they dance to the pulse of a clock
With those ignorant faces that they lie so much to protect
But these are all broken men
Their eyes are extinguished, their dreams became lies
And you cling to the edge of a dead Monday

Every street looks the same
It's just the towns that have different names
It's the infinite sadness of parallel lines
It's the shade in your eyes
We're not meant to be living this way

Wait
Meant to be living this way
Wait
We are meant to believe in this
Living this way
