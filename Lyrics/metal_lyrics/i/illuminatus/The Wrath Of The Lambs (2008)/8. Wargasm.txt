You must be proud
The headlines claim you won the war
And you wear that flag on your lapel
But across your street
A teenage girl is leaving school
To look after the kids

He leaves a young wife and a son behind
As your mother trails behind the funeral parade
We need our heroes now
The population is losing faith
Turn to page three

I remember shots
Of bodies in a long embrace
Like they never knew in life
Across your street
A teenage girl is leaving school
To look after the kids

He leaves a young wife and a son behind
As your mother trails behind the funeral parade
We need our heroes now
The population is losing faith
Turn to page three
