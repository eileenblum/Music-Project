The tragedy read of children scarred with the faces of men
Consumed by the malice that runs through their veins
A fistful of broken dreams

Gun City, you're sleepless tonight
Gun City, we're drowning together

An ex-beauty queen with the sunken eyes of a hopeless bride
Consumed by the poison that burns in her veins
The cruelty of wasted years

Gun City, you're sleepless tonight
Gun City, we're drowning together
Gun City, you're sleepless tonight
Gun City, we're facing the rising tide
