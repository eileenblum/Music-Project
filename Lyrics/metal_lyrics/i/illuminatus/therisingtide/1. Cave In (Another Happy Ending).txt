You search her eyes but you find yourself, along the lines that crack her face
But certain things never seem to change â the poison words, the space between them now

The sound of desperation rips like a wave through the crowd in this quiet bar
Where the chosen few drink to better days, and other happy endings

Another happy ending lost, and you feel your heart cave in

A flood of red, a city drowning in its sleep
It passes by like a blue of grey, with its neon suns and discount glamour girls

The quiet resignation sinks in the eyes of the men on the last train home
Where the chosen few think of better days, and other happy endings

Another happy ending lost, and you feel your heart cave in
Another happy ending lost, and you feel your heart cave in
