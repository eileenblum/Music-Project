Out of time
Black is the winter of gods
Song of cold's fading out

Within the dark and decay
Find the one, find the one
Gone on the lost souls road

The lost souls road
The lost souls road
The lost souls road
The lost souls road

Grow,
Be strong my lonely child
Off-balance and out of control
Vague it always will be

Father god
Take me away from love
Take me away from life
Take me away...
