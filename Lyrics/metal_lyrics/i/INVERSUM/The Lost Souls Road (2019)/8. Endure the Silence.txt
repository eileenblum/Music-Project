Lorn, emptied
Buried in aftermath fire
Winds of the desert, shades of the night
Echoes of harrowing years

In tombs of darkness,
Is born another soul
And restless ghosts of us
Will fill it with sorrow

In her eyes
One can see a burning soul
A lot of time will pass
A lot of time will flow

Without grief
Without fire and pain
How one would fight a way through the twilight
Tangled within life-long maze

In tombs of darkness,
Is born another soul
And restless ghosts of us
Will fill it with sorrow

The memories of the lost ones
Like dreams passing by
The distance is calling me away
As days are fading into the night

Pain from the lost days
Veiled in echoes of past
Cures thy heart with new beginning
Gives the wisdom, takes back loss and despair

While heading through the distance
With the memories of us
Bring the message
Like a ray in the dark

Walls between us and inside us
Raised by pride and fear
Filled with doubts
Never break on their own

While heading through the distance
Bleeding makes us alive
Knowing follows
When one's already gone

We need more timeâ¦
We need more timeâ¦
Which never ends
Under the infinite skies

Days of past
Remnants of after-shine
Distance won't encourage sensation
Like life fades without rays of the sun

With the shadows of the new dawn
They are forever gone
Forever gone
