Cold is covering the unseen path
Far we are, drifting away
Through shades of unknown

Blizzards are forcing to knock off the road
The spirits of lost are leading our way,
In search of our home

Lost we are or heading the course
Under full sails we're full of new hopes
So it was and so it shall be
The pure aspiring defeats curse

Struggle with self
Is the weightiest battle
The gates of new are opening
To those with wide-opened heart

Lost we are or heading the course
Under full sails we're full of new hopes
So it was and so it shall be
The pure aspiring defeats curse

In the lands of eternal snow
And darkness shrouding the bright ones
The fire inside the burning soul
Will light the way to the stars

Far we are, yet drifting away
Through shades of unknown, shades of unknown
The spirits of lost are leading our way
In search of our home, search of our home

Lost we are or heading the course
Under full sails we're full of new hopes
So it was and so it shall be
The pure aspiring defeats curse

Heading the course
We're full of new hopes
We are drifting
Through shades of unknown
