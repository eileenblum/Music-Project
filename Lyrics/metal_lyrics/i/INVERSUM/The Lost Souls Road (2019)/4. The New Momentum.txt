Take chances, be brave
Hard it may be
The unrevealed vessel, rebellious soul
Urging for more, where would you go?

Would you run away
And lead your thoughts astray?
Would you look into these eyes
Facing the shadows of death?

Leave fears behind
Then you may know
How deep and undreamed is our rabbit hole
In stream of time there's no tomorrow

Would you then run away
And lead your thoughts astray?
Would you look into these eyes
Feeling the shadows of death?

Wanderer, where (do) you go?
Do you want to know
When new sun is bornâ¦ again?

Would you run away
And lead your thoughts astray?
Or proudly look into these eyes
Facing the shadows of death?

Never run away
As none is here to stay
Proudly look into these eyes
Facing the shadows of death
