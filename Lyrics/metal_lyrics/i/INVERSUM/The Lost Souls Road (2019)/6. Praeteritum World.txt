Beholdâ¦
Immortal but frozen in time
The son of the morning light
Condemned by the crowd

Is feeding the burden
Of suffering souls,
With bliss as a just treat ahead
A way to reward

One dies, but vicious patterns go on and on
The slave of misery gives blessings to a child
Enthroned, enslaved in your hereditary
To strive with no way out... with no way out

Runsâ¦
Their wicked theater of life
The king of forgotten ones
The lord of the flies

Like melts shades of darkness
The desert sunlight
He comes into twilight
With hatred and pride

Weak mind is holding straw of humility
Corrupted maniac is an iterant choice
The mere delusion fakes meaning of the life
Hides fear of the unknown, of the unknown

Flowâ¦
Of somber visions of hate
Like spasm of a dying mind
Foreshadows the end

We're vessels of power
Fragile inside
A spark in eternity
Of infinite night

Infected consciousness in self-destructing fire
Creates delusions and never-ending lies
The past world shadows are hanging over us
Where are we now? Where are we now?
