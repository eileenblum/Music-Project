Cry no more 
It is the beginning of our living 
I see a vision from beyond 
Through the darkness we still breathing 
Still breathing... 

Sweet silence of my bleeding heart 
Still follows me from the deep inside 
Dying eyes rising from the rainy nights 
Just come to me have no fear 

Iâve never wanted you to come to me 
Sweet silence that you cannot see 
The ocean from the ancient fire 
Still whispers to me wonderful desires 

Itâs the day we are looking for our sweetest desires 
The descending purity of our unburned fire
