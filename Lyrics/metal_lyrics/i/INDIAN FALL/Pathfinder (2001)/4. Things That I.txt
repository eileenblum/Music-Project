I wish to see 
The light 
The light upon darkness and 
I wish to feel the reality of life 
I need to know 
That I 
That I am no sinner and 
I wish to be things Iâve never been before 
There are eyes upon you 
Pulling me under 
Erotic for you 
The eyes of the thunder 
There are eyes upon you 
Pulling me under 
Erotic for me 
The eyes of the thunder
