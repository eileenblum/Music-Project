It only lasts an eternity 

Itâs the holy one 
I canât see the sun 
Am I the evil one? 
I canât see the sun 

Awaiting for his arrival 
I cannot see 
The identity of things 
Still confuses me 
But I am no preacher 
For your thoughts to believe 
More with a lie I see 
Less than a life to me 

Things that I see 
Thoughts confusing me 
Pray the holy one 
But never to face the sun 

And I cannot see 
The identity of things 
Still confuses me 
You know Iâm no preacher 
For your thoughts to believe 
More with a lie I see 
Less than a life to me 

Itâs the holy one 
I canât see the sun 
Iâm no evil one 
Now I see the sun
