Iâm sitting here in darkness 
Waiting for the sun to shine 
Never had a friend... 
...Replace my past 

The weeping of my tears 
The shadow still appears 
The silence of the nights 
If only I could drown into... 

My mind is full of tears 
Oh God listen to all of these 
My mind is full of no one 
Still raining in my dreams
