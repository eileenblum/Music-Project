You are a soft touch on our faces 
The deep, the cold of our souls 
You take our hearts in holy places 
Beautiful that you are 
You are sacred to me 

The mourning we 
Prepare to weep 
The rainy nights 
That are so deep 
The mourning we... 

If you are the reason for us 
To take our future and trust 
The meaning of life is a curse 
No soul shall awake... 
Awake in a world 
No human shall crawl
