Your eyes are opened now you see the dream you had is real 
You canât get up, you cannot move, you canât pretend 
Youâre even real 
But you are so real to me... 

There is a light 
That I canât keep it away from you 
The more lightly I see 
The more I canât understand myself 

Shadows of my dreaming 
Still burning in my head 
They are coming for you my friend 
-Are coming until the end- 
They are waiting for your love 
For your passion and your soul 

Into the deeper lost paradise 
I fear the darkness, I fear my mind 
And in the end I will see the sign 
The dreams are followed by deathâs price 
Into the deeper lost paradise 
I fear the darkness, I fear my mind 
And in the end I will see the sign 
I fear the darkness, I fear my... 

Shadows of my dreaming 
Still burning in my head 
They are waiting for you my friend 
-Are coming until the end- 
They are coming for your love 
For your passion and your sou
