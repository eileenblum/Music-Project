Altering our human nature 
Our bloody human soul 
Waste of love for all our creatures 
Our savior should now come 

Sacred thieves of sanity 
Still coming back to me 
Promise me in my sanity 
Iâll find the peace for me 
Sacred thieves of sanity 
Still coming back to me 
Promise me sweet sanity 
This is the only peace for me 

Our time is the answer for now 
Your life shall be trusted somehow 
The angels are calling between 
My faith is corrupted by sin 

You live in the same deep Dark Age 
Like the all of us you can feel the bleeding of our souls
