Falling rocks from above rolling over the edge
It is killing the dawn from the very first birth
...Scissors arms cutting through
Through stigmatic signs
Venom bottles of shiny green
Kill their thirst for red blood

Walking - filling her agony
Stripping - people in ecstasy
Running, from the demonic art
Splitting, butchering them apart

Is that the prophet
Tells her to stay away
But U don't have to listen
Her silent thoughts are turning grey

Birds screaming at the end of sights
Flying away
Serpents whores of salvation
Serpents whores of salvation
Arms falling from the angel sky
Embrace my sin
Silent bells of salvation
Silent bells of salvation

[Solo â A.V.]

Lovers lost in bed of blood
Shining away
Serpents whores of salvation
Serpents whores of salvation
Cruel laughs my erotic tears
Falling again
Silent bells of salvation
Silent bells of salvation
