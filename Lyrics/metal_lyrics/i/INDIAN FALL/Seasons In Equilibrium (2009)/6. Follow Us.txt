Walking away in the midnight
Yeah I'm falling
I'm going down
The river waits for a whisper
Generated
With or without you...
I'm going...

Follow me, follow us
Here is the path
Going down, follow us
Follow me, follow us
Here is the path
Going down, without you

Remove your pain, it's just fear
Fear leaving
Your body now
Step in the dark, it's just silence
You won't remember
Must been fall asleep
Awake in dust in the midnight
Oh I'm feeling
I'm going down
The river waits for a calling
Generated
With or without you...
