This empty heart
I wish to fill
With tears and blood
-I'm waiting (for you) to come near
The empty face
Delivered to
The evil line
-Ends in darkened space

This journey back
To my precious roots
Is full of pain
-I'll wear my ancient suits
The greatest life
You've ever had
Is lost in dust
-Ice falling from your hair

[Solo A.V.]
