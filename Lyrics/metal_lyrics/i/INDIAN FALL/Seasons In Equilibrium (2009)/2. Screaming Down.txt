Holding the archers before the night
Empties my brain
I see demons
Dead is the silence upon my plague
Until I find my lost sorrow
Wait for the artist painting my face
Shadows against human nature
Release the archers before the night
Empties my soul
I lost fear...

Scream...

When the rebels will see the fight
Rebels will kill the light
Where the other released free
Others condemned seeing

Battle winnings
Ordered killings
Seed our fire
The desire

I cross the age - thy kingdom come
The innocence for intricate

...Dead is the silence upon my plague
Until I find my lost sorrow
Wait for the artist painting my face
Shadows against human nature
Release the archers before the night
Empties my soul
I lost fear...

Let the freedom come
The freedom is there
