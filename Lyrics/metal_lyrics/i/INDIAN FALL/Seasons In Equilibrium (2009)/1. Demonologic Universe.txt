Wind carousing the night
No return to the reality
Swords are falling from sky
Planets shining in blood
Storm unchained in the night
Spinning thoughts in the (the) agony
Universe is at war
Silence wept in my eyes

It's the desire
Falling
Beyond
...
Demons
Reaching
In stardust

Must be a season fall
Watching the dawn you may be too
Trying to seek no stormy land
Stardust apart from hell

My ancient fear
Entering inside me
Drowning in blood
My hours

[Solo â A.V.]
