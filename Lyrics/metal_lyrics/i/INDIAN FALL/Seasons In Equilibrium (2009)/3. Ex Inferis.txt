The Son...
Of Moon...
Bleeding through the...
Forest...
Of souls...
Of creepy smiling men

They watch you crawling
They watch you sleep
I'm watching you...falling down but
Where can U fall so deep
Keep  coming crawling
Keep coming breathe
Keep going ...nowhere else but
Where I can find no sleep

From battle hesitations they drown into the sea
Their passing through the castle is full of misery
And once again...the army dies
The nomad wounded soldiers they become enemy
Their passing through the valley is certain destiny
And once again...the army dies
