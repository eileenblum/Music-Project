Fatality downwards â I'm peeling my skin
Full flames in the area â torment from within
The sunny day carries out â sickening
This story is cynical â now listen (to) it

Create my visions
Unleash our fire
This life is so lost
Without desire

The most deadly
Creature (on) Earth
Bloody evil
Breaks the oath
And your figure
Light embrace
Brings hell's daughters
Near my face
Near my shadow
Supreme...

I must have been more than Sidious...
Perfect and more oblivious...
I am myself / ex inferis

Mistfull shadows
Lose control
In this imprisoned
Painted wall
And your figure
Light embrace
Brings hell's daughters
Near my face
Near my shadow
Supreme...
