[Solo A.V.]

Wake me up inside it feels so warm...
Enter in my room I am here alone...
If you enter here right now you will feed my needs...
Will the smoke above my head turn into your dreams ?

We're marching to the orphanage
What U see is our course
The guilt of generations
Now the hours passing through

When passion is cruel awake my soul
I'm lost between the seeds of ancient dawn
It's my willing to show the shinny star
Guilt above you all this is your war

[Solo A.V.]
