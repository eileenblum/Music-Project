I am the one that mourns inside
I am the fear kept in the past

I am the void trapped in your chest
I am the meaning I am the God

I am the secret key
That burns all lies from
Your manipulated mind
There is no other way out
But to be born again

I am you and I will rise
Awaken from ethereal slumber
Lost forever without a crown
I am your shelter
I am your flame
