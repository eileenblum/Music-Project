I'll try to find my self
I'll try to fight with you
The fire from your eyes
It's burn my thoughts

I am the void

I talk with me and now
My soul is burning down
I am nobodies flesh
My fear rise around

I am the void

The hidden wisdom tamed the beasts of your hell
The chains are broken and the magic is gone
Eternity is burning
You...standing against infinity and emptiness

From darkness somehow I never leave
Carried away by my own premonitions
Crush this temple of anger and fear
