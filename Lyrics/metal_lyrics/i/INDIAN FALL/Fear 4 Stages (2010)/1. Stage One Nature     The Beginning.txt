Here you are follow the nature
Speak my name till the end of wind
Force the leaf to touch you fingers
Wait for someone to guide you safe
Forest is deep and the rain is falling
Fear is near and the bravery is going

Deep dawn in the middle of nowhere
The rain feed the ground with bloody tears
When the storm is closer and the sky is burning
The fear is near and the bravery is going

I try to feel you but the wind frozen my thoughts

Thousand voices split your head
Your endless dream has no effect
Feed the fear, no escape
Kiss the ground and start to pray

Left is talking: if you want I buy you fear
Right still wait a frozen tear
Thunders fall around your dreams

You are fear, the fear it's you
You are fear, the fear it's you
