Malevolent creations whispering and crawling through the sky 
As the darkness falls deeper and deeper 
Noiseless atractions coming from below 
Faces beyond illusions sinking in a sea of darkness 
All dreams came true... 

Evil threatening our wicked souls 
Death is everywhere in our fleshless bones 
Master of our tortured minds 
Tears and sufferance sicking the mankind 

The way you chose tommorow it has its yesterdays 
Now you can't avoid the sorrow 
And keeping all the good parts made from memories 
But memories are free to borow 
Like the beauty coming from itself 
Now you're an angel, spread your wings and fly... 

Malevolent creations whispering through the skies 
As the darkness falls deeper and deeper... 

Deep into the sky 
It's all that he's been dreaming 
We leave our past behind 
The way, the thoughts, the feelings 
Far into the oceans 
There's no limit underneath 
Like a soft light of a candle 
We are here to fight the wind
