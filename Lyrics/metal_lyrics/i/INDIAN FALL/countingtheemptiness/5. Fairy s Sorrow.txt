Mysterium tremendum 
Ages at the end of the night 
An emperor is rising... 

And by carnage he conquers the world 
In order to receive the blessing... 

Through whispers he heals the scars deep in their minds 
Still listening and crawling for desire... 
From a dreaming god, almighty in search of beauty 
The last breath on his face was not ment to be an obsession... 

And by carnage he conquers the world 
In order to... 
Receive... 
The blessing...
