Strange never-ending dream 
Sleep into my mind 
Cover your bleeding hand 
The peace you'll never find... 

Always keep the soul 
Keep your soul alive 
Black and bloody thoughts 
They will never die... 

These days I feel alone 
And I don't know where I belong 
This emptiness is part of me 
Like the river from below 
Falls deeper from above 
From the other side of me 

Strange never-ending dreams... 

Your unconverted soul lies into my hands 
The faith you thought you had, you thought it never ends 
Into the final end you know that you will see 
Some things that you don't know, some things that should not be...
