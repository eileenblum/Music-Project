Look deeper in the eye 
I've seen the holy light 
You, my friend, you could 
Step into the other side 

Listen to the voices 
Falling down into your head 
What thing it should be harder 
Being alive or being dead... 

Eyes of truth still haunting us 
It's all the same story from the past 
It's now seeking us, so dangerous 
Misterious, no pain, no loss 
It's critical, so magical, it hurts us all 
May build a wall, so you can fall, deep dawn below 
Think you can crawl, must break the wall 
It's from the outside, the inner beauty... 

Everything you dream it's just falling 
It's the enchanted rain from the holly... 
Haunted by the stars you start smiling 
And everything you dream it's just falling...
