Altering our human nature
Our bloody human soul
Waste of love for all our creatures
Our savior should now come
Sacred thieves of sanity
Still coming back to me
Promise me in my sanity
Iâll find the peace for me
Sacred thieves of sanity
Still coming back for me
Promise me sweet sanity
I'll find the peace for me
Altering our human nature
Our bloody human soul
Waste of love for all our creatures
Our savior should now come
You live in the same deep Dark Age
Like the all of us you can feel the bleeding of our hearts
