Shadows of my dreaming
Still burning in my head
They are coming for you my friend
-Are coming until the end-
They are waiting for your love
-Are coming until the end-
For your passion and your soul
-Are coming until the end-

The more I canât understand myself
Into the deeper lost paradise
I fear the darkness, I fear my mind

I fear the darkness, I fear my...
Shadows of my dreaming
Still burning in my head
They are coming for you my friend
-Are coming until the end-
They are waiting for your love
-Are coming until the end-
For your passion and your soul
-Are coming until the end-
