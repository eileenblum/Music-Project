It's too late to let the people know
It's too late to let your fears go
There's a cover up - in high places
Cover up! Hide your faces

Should have been ready for the attack
we could have beat them in the end
Sticking together, we could have overcome
see where your foolishness has led
Now the arrive, start to attack
Invaders falling from the sky
It's too late to stop the assault
The planet falls with a sigh

It's too late to let the people know
It's too late to let your fears go
There's a cover up - in high places
Cover up! Hide your faces

You stand in horror as the cities fall
You never thought it'd come to this
Now it is over, you dug your own grave
A planet crossed off the list
We should have shared all that we owned
We could have lived with them as one
But for your pride, jealousy and hate,
now the end of man has come
