[them:]
We have you here before us
Now tell us what you see
The people don't support you, in you they don't believe

[him:]
They always fear the unknown - the things they can't see
You had to have a scapegoat, the one you chose was me

Victory in disguise - the fire never dies

[them:]
You struggle for these people, why do you even try?
What is the sense in freedom when you yourself will die?

[him:]
If I can free just one life, my work is justified
It will go on forever, your power I defy

Victory in disguise - the fire never die

The smell of death is in the air
Why does the man - who they hate - cause them fear?
Is it because they know they're wrong and in the end he will have victory?

[them:]
Why do you fight for freedom when no one gives a damn?
Your little game is over, your death is now at hand

[him:]
I stand here chained and broken so you can be set free
The future is the answer - my death will be the key
