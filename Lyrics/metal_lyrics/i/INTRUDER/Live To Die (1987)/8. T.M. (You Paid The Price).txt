What went on in you head when they told you
did you think that it was all a lie?
You were leading cattle to the slaughter
you still lived when all around you died
How many lives did it take to convince you -
did you see that what you did was wrong?
Serving death to the people of the city
were you so cold you could not see the harm?

Mary - Mary - oh the blood of a thousand lives stain your hands
Mary - Mary - but you paid the price

How did you feel when they said you had killed them - did you feel their agony and pain?
Or did you think that they were mistaken - you would never, never kill or maim
You wouldn't let them cut in your body
you thought they were nothing more than fools
When you have to answer to the master
their souls will avenge themselves on you

Mary - Mary - oh the blood of a thousand lives stain your hands
Mary - Mary - but you paid the price

I feel your sorrow, your agony and pain
It's time to weep no more, sentence is over, your debt has been paid
Lay your soul to rest

Did you finally tire of the running - or did your conscience finally get to you?
Did they get you when you were not looking?
Either way, your game was all through
26 years you were locked from the outside
They slammed the door and threw away the key
You calmly accepted your 'sentence'
for with your death you knew you'd then be free
