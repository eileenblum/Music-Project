You were faithful to the family
They gave you everything you could ever need
The don treated you just like a son
How was he to know that you would be the one
Was it the feds - did they have a line on you?
Or was it cash that turned your head?
It doesn't matter, 'cause when we are through,
you'll be glad that you are dead

Kiss of death - for your dishonor
Kiss of death - now you must pay
Kiss of death - make peace with your maker now

Did you think that you would not be caught
or did you think that allegiance could be bought?
It doesn't matter, in the end it's all the same

Just like Judas you betrayed the one you loved
On his power you did feed
But unlike Judas the tables have been turned,

Kiss of death - for your dishonor
Kiss of death - now you must pay
Kiss of death - make peace with your maker now

I don't know why I did as I had done
I feel as though ironic victory is won
and through this irony justice will be served
'cause I know in the end we get what we deserve

This is a lesson for those that will hear
just try and cross us, then you'll know fear
When you least expect it, is when we make our call
there's no escaping the hammer when it falls
We have the power to bring you to your knees
or make you dreams come true
Both the options are laid at your feet
now the choice is up to you
