People live for the sunrise
I for the rise of the moon
They walk about in the sunlight,
like the dead I wait in my tomb
I awake and meet the darkness
feel the hunger in my veins
No way to stop these feelings
now it's more than just a game

It never ends - it's all the same
I need to feed to end my pain
I'm enslaved to my needs
I'm nothing more than a cold-blooded killer - that's what I am.
Cold-blooded killer - destroyer of man

So many wasted years gone
kill to live and live to kill
No end to all the slaughter
long ago I lost the thrill
I have taken the lives of millions
the innocent and the brave
With your blood I live on,
but in the end, I will pay

It never ends - it's all the same
I need to feed to end my pain
I'm enslaved to my needs.
I'm nothing more than a cold-blooded killer - that's what I am
Cold-blooded killer - destroyer of man
