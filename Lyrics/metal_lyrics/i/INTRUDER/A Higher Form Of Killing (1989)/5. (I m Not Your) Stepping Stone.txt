You're trying to make your mark on society, by using all the tricks you used on me.
You're reading all those high fashion magazines, the clothes you're wearing, girl, are causing public scenes, I said--

I'm not your stepping stone - I'm not your stepping stone

When I first met you girl, you didn't have no shoes, but now you're running around like you're front page news.
Well, baby, you've been careful about the friends you choose, but you won't find my name in your book of who's who's.
I said--

I'm not your stepping stone - I'm not your stepping stone

Now you say that you are free, you have no use at all for me.
Well I have got some news for you -- you won't be shit when I get through.
