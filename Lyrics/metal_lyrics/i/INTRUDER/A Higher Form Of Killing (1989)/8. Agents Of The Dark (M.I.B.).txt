[intro:]
it all started with a light in the sky.
I was driving home from work when my engine died.
Well I'm no coward - I'd rather fight than run.
But when I looked from my window that night,
I nearly came undone.

So big it filled the sky, as it rose from the sand.
So scared I was gonna die, I left my car and I ran.
It turned without a sound, as it came for me.
No control, I fell to the ground and then I ceased to be.

[chorus:]
Agents of the dark - M.I.B.
Agents of the dark - let me be
Agents of the dark - can't you see that I will never talk?

I awoke to the dawn. what was it I had seen? So safe - nothing's wrong.
Had it been just a dream? Back home I contemplate.
On the night before. Loud knocks - I hesitate, and then I go to the door.

[chorus]

opened the door to the night and there he was standing in the light.
dressed in black and eyes aflame,
in a threatening voice he spoke my name and said, "I'm from the government.
I'd like to have a word with you. we know all about last night.
now here's what you will do. never tell anyone about my being here - or the light.
we don't want to hurt you friend, so keep the lid on tight - we'll be watching you!!!"

three months have passed, still they badger me. how long will it last,
when will I be free? men in black everywhere, a nightmare come true.
can't talk - I don't dare, what the hell am I to do!
