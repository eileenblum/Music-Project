You feel so safe, sealed in your room.
Among the poisons, you think you are immune.
A broken vial, a mislaid hand.
That's all it took - to start - the end of man.

Genetic Genocide - Who Will Live - Who Will Die

A new breed of man, was that your goal?
Or was it something to cure the common cold.
Playing with fire you got your fingers burned.
Oh man in white - tell us - what have you learned.

Genetic Genocide - Who Will Live - Who Will Die

When Did you finally break down?
When you saw there was no cure to be found?
What price the crown of a king on his throne, if he is here in the world all alone.

Now look around you, see what you've done.
A parody of man is what we have become.
You are the father of this newborn race.
Come to us now - join us - to our cold embrace.
