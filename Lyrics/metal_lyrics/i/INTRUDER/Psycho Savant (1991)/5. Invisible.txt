I scream but no one hears me.
I hurt but no one seems to give a fuck.
can no one break the silence?
is it my destiny to self destruct?

the onslaught of silence chews in my brain.
your lack of emotions drives me insane.
I'm not invisible. I'm not invisible.

I stare into the fire.
the smell of burning flesh fills the air.
the sounds of sirens screaming.
destruction - the opiate of my despair.

the onslaught of silence chews in my brain.
your lack of emotions drives me insane.
I'm not invisible. I'm not invisible.

warning sent through the airwaves.
searching for the one their silence drove insane.
bringer of mass destruction.
invisible, a specter with no face or name.
