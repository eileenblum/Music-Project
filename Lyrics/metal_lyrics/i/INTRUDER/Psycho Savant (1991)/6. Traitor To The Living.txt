there's a secret and it's buried underground.
Virginia mountains is where it can be found.
another world just waiting there for them.
while in our world we have been condemned.
if we are old or sick or living in poverty, we will never get to see your special facility.
we don't give a damn about your logical philosophy.
you're just a coward who'd rather run than fight.
you'll live as we die. it's just not right.

you're a traitor - traitor
traitor to the living - traitor
traitor - for you there's no forgiving
traitor - the end is just the beginning for you

we see your smiling face up on the TV screen.
we hear you talking but your words don't mean a thing.
don't buy your world of peace, you talk of hope and love.
'cause you'll be safe and sound when death falls from above.
safe from the moans and the screams of those in pain.
safe from the burns and the scars of acid rain.
safe from the laugh and the touch of those insane.
you're just a coward who'd rather run than fight.
you'll live as we die. it's just not right.

you're a traitor - traitor
traitor to the living - traitor
traitor - for you there's no forgiving
traitor - the end is just the beginning for you

do you think your god, choosing who'll live or die?
fool - it's a faÃ§ade, you're only living a lie.
when it is done, there'll be no good or bad.
then you'll be the one to see you have been had!

now the time has come to end this whole charade.
from the path of "for the people" you have strayed.
we see you slipping, we know just what you are.
but you will never leave, you've let it go too far.
all the money and the power you can't resist.
have you forgotten that without us you don't exist?
when it is over and your gone you won't be missed.
you're just a coward who'd rather run than fight.
you'll live as we die, it's just not right.
