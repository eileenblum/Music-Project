mother, didn't you want me?
am I to blame for what you've done?
so many times new life is undone.
society makes it easy to run.

growing inside of you.
final word, my life's left to you.

you tell yourself I have no feeling.
a bad mistake, that's all you know.
you tell yourself, I feel no pain.
I'm pulled apart, you've stopped my soul

growing inside of you. final word, my life's left to you.

so now I speak to you from beyond.
where voices here are born and slain.
I could have filled the hole in your life.
now your mind is where I'll stay
