Intro: You put me here where I don't belong.
My body's old but my mind's still strong.
You'd not believe the things they put me through.
It would be so different if they happened to you.
Look around tell me what you see - pain, suffering, and misery.
Lonely people who've been locked away.
With no desire to live another day.

Left to die, I wonder why? We gave you the best years of our lives!
Don't you see, you are me and soon it's you they will despise.
You don't care, we don't dare. Who needs the hurt we'll just pretend.
All is right, day and night, you see a smile but our eyes say-

[Chorus:]
When-When will they end all their apathy
When-When will they open their eyes to see
When-When will they end the misery
When-When will he finally come for me
When!

Up at six, needle pricks, another day in hell's begun.
Someone cries, another dies, we play a game that can't be won.
Wet the bed, spoon fed, we relive our childhood again and again.
And our sleep is no relief, for in our dreams we still cry-

[Chorus]

I remember when we were young.
No thought at all of what we would become.
They sold us a dream-said we'd never die
But that was over sixty years ago.
We're so much older an now we know,
that what they told us was only a lie!
Now we realize-what a surprise-everybody dies!

Everyday I sit and pray, when will you come and take me home.
Where's the love, from above, I feel so lost and all alone.
I want to be young and free, not some fourth-class citizen.
It won't be long and I'll be gone. 'Till then I'll just keep wondering-

[Chorus]

Please tell me when!
