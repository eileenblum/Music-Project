so - you come for me.
I waited patiently.
I knew you'd finally come around.
I see you found my mark, those bodies in the park, and now you've come to take me down.
I won't resist - I must insist.
am I to blame?
am I insane?
or am I guilty?
I'm guilty, I'm guilty, I'm guilty, I'm guilty. I'm -

not guilty by reason of insanity - not guilty
not guilty by reason of insanity

I heard a voice.
I really had no choice.
it told me just what I should do.
now they're dead and gone, but, somehow they live on.
I guess my work is not yet through.
they laugh at me, won't let me be.
I'm not to blame - I am insane.
I'm guilty, I'm guilty, I'm guilty, I'm guilty. I'm -

not guilty by reason of insanity - not guilty
not guilty by reason of insanity

now look at yourself, look at your "mental health".
are you so different than me?
you want to play with fire, you have the same desires.
I've just learned to set mine free.
you know it's true - you see it too.
we're all to blame - we're all insane.
we're all guilty.
I'm guilty. your guilty. they're guilty. we're -

not guilty by reason of insanity - not guilty
not guilty by reason of insanity
