guilty - or so it seems.
you found a motive and he had the means.
sentenced - death by the chair.
but let me warn you it won't end there.
no! I have searched my whole life for the one who has caused all our strife.
now I find, he's in your man.
how can I make you understand?

he is the one who robs us of our will
he is the one who causes us to kill
we are the ones who feed his appetite
we are the ones who can end this thing tonight

listen - can't you hear?
it's not over, there is so much to fear.
locked up - he's "safe in a cell"?
well don't believe it 'cause I know him to well.
look! the human body, is just a host.
you might say that you captured a ghost.
and like a ghost, he will return.
how can I ever make you learn?

he is the one who robs us of our will
he is the one who causes us to kill
we are the ones who feed his appetite
we are the ones who can end this thing tonight

I don't know what he is or how he cam to be.
I only know that if he lives we can't be free - from the pain and the suffering.
then our lives they won't mean - won't mean a thing.

patience - it has run out.
you must be sure, there is no room for doubt.
come on - we're out of time.
we cannot argue, make up your mind.
now! I may be right, I may be wrong.
but if you wait you'll have waited too long.
it's down you, what will it be?
will you ever really see -

he is the one who robs us of our will
he is the one who causes us to kill
we are the ones who feed his appetite
we are the ones who can end this thing tonight
