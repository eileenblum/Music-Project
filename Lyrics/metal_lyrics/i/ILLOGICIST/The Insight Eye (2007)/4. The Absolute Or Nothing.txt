Crawl to live
In a self-made box
Claiming the end
Of the useless faith

No escape
You have to choose
Between two doors
The doubt takes up your mind

An answer due
To your questions
Expected truths
Desired since you were a child

One single chance
No more half-ways
An extreme pick
The devil and the deep blue...sea

Make your choice
The absolute or nothing
Play your ace
The absolute or nothing

Hesitation
Is forbidden
Resolution
Is the only way out

One single step
Then you fall down
No able to fly
You close your eyes and live

Make your choice
The absolute or nothing
Play your ace
The absolute or nothing
