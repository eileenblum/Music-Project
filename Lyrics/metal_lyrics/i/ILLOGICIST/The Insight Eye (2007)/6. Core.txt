Recurrent
Elements
Of an instable
Overtone
Fighting my war, hurt renewing wounds
This pain
Is my own result

Forced
To comply
One single purpose
I create
New prison of lies to lock inside
Demons
And angels as well

This time is
My war

Core
All my parts fill the whole
No one is to blame
Except me
Except fate

Core
All my parts fill the whole
Nothing is to claim
Gets my sleep
Holds my days

The absence
The presence
My double nature
I can't choose
The rumor inside me will keep on
Untill
I refuse this loop

To become
Entire, real
There is one pathway
To compose
Dissonant speech inside my true voice
Which is
Easier to accept

This time is
My war

Core
All my parts fill the whole
No one is to blame
Except me
Except fate

Core
All my parts fill the whole
Nothing is to claim
Gets my sleep
Holds my days
