Life inside me, it begins to call
Never heard before
Beating melodies, written by my heart
Make me feel about death

Disconnected flows, between my cells
Neuron burning smell
Asymmetric lines, between my eyes
I forget that my brain lies

Show me the way
Through my darkness
Show me the light
Into my life

Be my guide
Through the unexpected state of my mind
Be my guide
Through the unexpected side of my life

Emotional visions of my world
I'm trapped in my own
Irrational meanings for your words
I'm loosing self-control

Show me the way
Through my darkness
Show me the light
Into my life

Be my guide
Through the unexpected state of my mind
Be my guide
Through the unexpected side of my life
