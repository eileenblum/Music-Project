Keep your pace
With all this sense of guilt
Walking through the haze
Of your mental state

Lie in wait
To feel what your heart plays
Polymorphic beasts
Pulse on a mad breast

Soundless pain
Earing inside me
Fearing body creeps
Soundless pain
Resounding in me

Dream your peace
Without this mindframe leak
Turn down the scheme
Of your deadlock strain

Fade the rave
To keep under control
Everything you fear
Your rest will become...
...real

Soundless pain
Earing inside me
Fearing body creeps
Soundless pain
Resounding in me
