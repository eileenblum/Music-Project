No one's talking
About this hidden war
Conspirating
Against the spread of these truths

Burnt to ashes
Neglected to reveal
Cryptic backstairs
They've never had to be told

Secrets of human hate
Suffocate
Your will
Gate

Every day I live
Ignoring to be a serf
Wake up you, man!
And try to grab your own shade

Resurrecting
From unconsciousness dreams
Voiceless speakers
Making esoteric streams

Secrets of human hate
Suffocate
Your will
Gate
