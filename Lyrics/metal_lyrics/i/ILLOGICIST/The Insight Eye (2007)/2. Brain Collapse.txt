Please, follow me
Follow my words
To the path of reason

They believe
In a logic world
Stupid humans' hopes
The rational obsession...
...kills

(To believe the unbelievable)

Theorems they try to impose
Trying to rule our lifes
In a mystical order

Numbers, shapes and codes
All around us
Saturating the universe...
...implode

The time before insanity
The brain collapse
Behind illusions
A cage of ghosts

The time before insanity
The brain collapse
Behind your lies
I begin to live

Stabs through my head
Sudden bloody scars
The dagger of nonsense

Can I feel

Tears on my cheek
Flowing down to lips
Bitter drops of misery...
...falls

(To believe the unbelievable)

Laws feed their mind
Feed their appetite
Colonizing souls

Can I rest

Unbearable cries
All around me
Imploring for peace

The time before insanity
The brain collapse
Behind illusions
A cage of ghosts

The time before insanity
The brain collapse
Behind your lies
I begin to live
