Trying to escape this sense of desease
Wherever you move your eyes
Ghosts come back with their chains

Giving the way to breath to your fears
I'll never forget the mask sewed on your hurted face

Every time I look into your abyss
Suffering hands that scratch to be heard from your soul

Giving the way to live to your dreams
I'll never forget the fire burning on your deepest will

The cycles of existence
In a room of emptiness
Feeding my brain
Becoming insane

Rooms of emptiness
In a cycle of existence
Feeding my pain
I will be here to play my...
...game

Closing the gates you have made to resist
Obstructions created as self-defense for your peace

No one will break the thread of your mind
I'll never forget the blade cutting my self-control

What can you see if you try to explore
Different rooms of your emptiness be the first

To sacrifice the cycle of existence
I'll never forget your name man, you are my only god

The cycles of existence
In a room of emptiness
Feeding my brain
Becoming insane

Rooms of emptiness
In a cycle of existence
Feeding my pain
I will be here to play my...
...game
