You can see
Abstracted stares
Behind my mirror face

Sand made troops
Against my fears
Renewed by lonely tears

I try to fight
The frosted cell
I've ever failed to warm

I stop to breath
Merged in myself
A bubble of nonsense

The tear
Of my insight eye
Lost in the void side of myself
Bleeding, it looks for a bleam of light

The stare
Of my insight eye
Lost in the void side of myself
Crying, it looks for a bleam of hope

The wish to live
Legitimates
The melody of my pain

Never whelm
I start to swim
In the ocean of desires

Like a ship
Referenceless
In absence of purpose

The tear
Of my insight eye
Lost in the void side of myself
Bleeding, it looks for a bleam of light
