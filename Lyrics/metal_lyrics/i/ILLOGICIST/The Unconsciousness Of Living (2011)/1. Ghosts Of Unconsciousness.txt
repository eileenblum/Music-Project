You feel my blade that grazes you soul
Believe... It's not a game
Blood is what you fear to taste on me
You've never been so hypnotized from... gore

From left to right, your eyes try to escape
As far as they can see
Ghosts of your unconsciousness of living
Flying over shadows, they scream

Never looking outside in the middle of a dream, the pain...
Rediscovering a netherworld

In your shadows and over us
Ghosts of unconsciousness... they live

Confused, you crawl behind your own trails
Convinced to be on a new way
Lost, you look for a sign that could help your strong wish for freedom
For a new life

Never looking outside in the middle of a dream, the pain...
Rediscovering a netherworld

In your shadows and over us
Ghosts of unconsciousness... they live
