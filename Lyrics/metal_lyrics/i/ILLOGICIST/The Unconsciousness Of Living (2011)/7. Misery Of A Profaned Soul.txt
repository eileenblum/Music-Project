Nevermore I'll ask myself to exploit
My ability to fill the human void

Got the chance to look beyond your shell
I realize the wish to rule your will

The misery of a profaned soul
Violated to satisfy my wish to know

Please forgive me
I've been blinded by my nihilism

Carelessly, I try to climb the wall
You have built to protect your hidden world

The misery of a profaned soul
Violated to satisfy my wish to know

Please forgive me
I've been guided by my wish to feed...my ego
