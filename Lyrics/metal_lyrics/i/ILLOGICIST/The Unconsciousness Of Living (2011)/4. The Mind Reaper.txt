I feel my shade starts to disappear from your...fake theater of life

I see your eyes trying to hypnotize my sight to capture my eyes

You hold down your cold hand on my trembling lips, to kill my last hope

Wherever you can hide away
Look over your shoulders
A freezing breath on your pale face
Caused by his brain cÅ¯eaver
Whenever you can try to leave
Look behind your shadow
A frightening shade follows your steps
It's the mind reaper

I try to hide the weakest side of my self to escape from your rage

I always thought I could control my will to...react to your hate

Wherever you can hide away
Look over your shoulders
A freezing breath on your pale face
Caused by his brain cÅ¯eaver
Whenever you can try to leave
Look behind your shadow
A frightening shade follows your steps
It's the mind reaper
