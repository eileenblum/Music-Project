Looking for a reason to hate me
You try to find a non-existent proof
To condemn and prosecute the way
I face the dark without being overcome from my own life

This is the same old collision
Between who lives and who tries to kill
Humans that fight to dictate their vision
And everything else is...history

Pulling out your teeth from my deep flesh
I ask myself how long you can strike me
You persist in trying to defeat my will to live
My strong wish to escape from my nightmares

This is the same old collision
Between who lives and who tries to kill
Humans that fight to dictate their vision
And everything else is...history
