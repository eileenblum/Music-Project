Prevent yourself to listen to your deep-breathing flow
You will be caught by a whispering...
Melody, that seems to be composed by an evil
Disharmonic scale
A breaking wail into the void

Forbid yourself to listen to your hard-pulsing chest
You will be scared by the unnatural...
Resonance that fills the empty room of apathy
Asymmetric beats of death clock hand
That counts your time

Never been so ravished by these silent harmonies
I become to realize how the balance works inside of me

Hypnotized by a voiceless-sounding strain
I meditate on my own misery
Mesmerized by a loud surrounding scream
I try to escape from this deadly melody

Decieved yourself
You have found the wrong way to complete you quest
A long time journey through the unknown...
To look for your inner symphony
An invisible score to be performed into your mind

Never been so ravished by these silent harmonies
I become to realize how the balance works inside of me

Hypnotized by a voiceless-sounding strain
I meditate on my own misery
Mesmerized by a loud surrounding scream
I try to escape from this deadly melody
