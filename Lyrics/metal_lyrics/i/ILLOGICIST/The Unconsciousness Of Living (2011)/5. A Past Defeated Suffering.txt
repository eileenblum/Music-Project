It flails on to my face and tries to catch my eyes
Another ghost from my past has come to claim his rest

In front of me, like a tree upraised from the ground
It starts to stroke my cheek with its cutting endless roots

Spirits from a past defeated suffering
Came back to rape my mind
And to claim a role into my nightmares
Spirits from a past forgotten time
To satisfy their wish
And to posses my feelings, they live...

He comes into my mouth and tries to rip my throat
An overwhelming flow that paralyzes my limbs

I feel his nails below my skin, scraping hard my bones
Unbearable shrills resounding from my fragile... flesh

Spirits from a past defeated suffering
Came back to rape my mind
And to claim a role into my nightmares
Spirits from a past forgotten time
To satisfy their wish
And to posses my feelings, they live...
