You know, I've never been an oracle to predict my future
Ive always picked the hardest way to walk
Just scared from the easiest choice

Lost, I look around confused
To define a landmark and to understand
The distance between myself and the abyss that calls my name

The awareness of a never ending fall
Discovering the sharp-less grip to hang on and to hold
The awareness of a never ending rift
Created by the clash of my deepest thoughts

You know, I've never been do terrorized to face up my feelings
Looking for an easy way to leave
Obssesed by my inner voice

Hurt, I cry aloud my reasons to engrave my suffering
To eradicate the animal
I feel growing inside my brain

he awareness of a never ending fall
Discovering the sharp-less grip to hang on and to hold
The awareness of a never ending rift
Created by the clash of my deepest thoughts
