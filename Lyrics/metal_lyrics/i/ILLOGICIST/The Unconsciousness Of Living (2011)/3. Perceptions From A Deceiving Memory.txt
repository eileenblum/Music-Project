Bravely, I look at my own insanity
I have to break the chains that enslave my free will

Paintings
From a distorted vision of my reality
Are hung upon
The wall I've built with my demons

Leave behind perceptions
From the deceiving memory
They will slip you down to kill your inner child...
And to destroy his cradle

Scared, I escape from my own curiosity
I have to built a solid shell made of reason

Victim of an obcure choice
Made with inequity, I'm bound to suffer
The pain that comes from my visoins

Leave behind perceptions
From the deceiving memory
They will slip you down to kill your inner child
And to destroy your being
