Rave...to believe in something 
that doesn't exist
Crazy...it makes me
Looking for my own reality
Whichever way... I look at it, it's always the same
Thing...Rotting, the emotions I've never seen cry...

Dissonant ways...for a dissonant life it doesn't persist
Neurons...inebriated by the empirical flames of
Perception...what can be seen from the abyss of 
evil...Exciting every cell of my sick...brain...

Dissonant perspectives consuming my dream
The end unexpected of what I've ever seen
Dissonant perspectives between mind cells and eyes
The end unexpected of rationality

Rage...To understand that only tales do not exist
Affliction...It's been great, behind the wall of weeping
Deranged mind...Abused by faith, It's always the same
Thing...Crying, the emotions I've never felt

Dissonant perspectives consuming my dream
The end unexpected of what I've ever seen
Dissonant perspectives between mind cells and eyes
The end unexpected of rationality
