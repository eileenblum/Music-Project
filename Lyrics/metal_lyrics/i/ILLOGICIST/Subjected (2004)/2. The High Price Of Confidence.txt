Trust

Friend believed so near
But now all it's so clear
Fucking heaps -  of human flesh
Ruled by - wicked heads

If you look around it's not easy to see
People, they hide themselves
Behind your honest shade
Against your person
Against you
Sucking forces from your help

The harsh fruit of friend ship
The high price of confidence

Give your blood
For your friends
But pay attention
For your health

Give your trust
To their words
But pay attention
They won't be lost

Time has gone and now 
You just have to choose
What about a kind and 
gentle cup of hate
Freezing over - words of hatred
No more troubles - for their stabs

The harsh fruit of friend ship
The high price of confidence

Give your blood
For your friends
But pay attention
For your health

Give your trust
To their words
But pay attention
They won't be lost
