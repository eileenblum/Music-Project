Frost on Earth cold in my eyes like ice - drift
Flow down slight dreams and heavy thought
Present ruins from past to me
Future calls a new black hole
Deeds increase!

Life! Crystallized
Way for my growth

I walk on a stream of lava
Decompsed
Universal entropy law
A blank page eternally
Empty spaces and no substance
No light to see

Eternity calls me
Infinity kiss me
I will expose a new breath
I will improve a lower state
Multiple beings nails in my brain pierce
perpetual time

Frost on Earth cold in my veins
Like ice - Drift flow down

The edge of sanity
present ruins from the past to me
Future calls a new approach
To the awareness

Life! Crystallized
Way for my growth

Eternity calls me, infinity kiss me
I will expose a new breath
I will improve a lower state

Noble's disease, living in solitude
Knowledge is mine
I'm laughing at this curse
Noble's revenge, melt his own enemy
Knowledge makes free
Misfortune of this life
