What If some day or night
A demon says to you
The life you are living now
You will have to live once more
But nothing new will be
Condemned to feel the same
Jay and pain

Why can't I choose a different lie
Why can't I choose

Every straight lie
The circle of time
The eternal
Every straight lie
The circle of life
The eternal return

Like a stone thrown up so high
It must fall dwon so hard
You will be crushed to death
You will have to face your past

'Cause everything you will find
It will be lived once more

The life you are living now
You will have to live once more
But nothing new will be
Condemned to feel the same
Jay and pain

Why can't I choose a different lie
Why can't I choose

Every straight lie
The circle of time
The eternal
Every straight lie
The circle of life
The eternal return
