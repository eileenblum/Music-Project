Feel your brain consumed slow
And you know why
There is no way, we can only pray
Taste of times, devours your spine
He's beyond us
We are so weak, straggler bodies chained

Starving eyes, looking inside
And you know why
He feeds on souls, rapes human thoughts
Puppets of gods, as empty as life
Flowing in veins
He lifts his chalice, he begins to bite

Eats our feelings, makes a living
Reaper of life, hate is your knife

Soul feeder, beware the feeble
Soul feeder, beware of evil
Words screaming pain, heart is his reign

Drinking your lymph, drops slowly strain
From his own mouth
He steals our reason, he steals our life
Trees without roots, men without god
In your visions
Hands on my head that they crush me down

Tears our being, sucks our feeling
Follower of evil, haunter of feeble
Soul feeder, beware the feeble
Soul feeder, beware of evil
Words screaming pain, heart is his reign
