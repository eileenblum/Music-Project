Close your eyes in the dark of your face
Visions of sins to feed up his taste
Looking for signs the could help to live
In a no more faith world, without rules without laws
No man could know the power of his mind
No mind could be understood by it's brain

Subjection of your free will
To be free to kill your
Sense of independence
The sense of your life
Subjecting your spirt
To be free o kill
The taste of your wisdom
The taste of your life

From Grendel to Cain, converting your soul
Brainwashed by words to believe, to be theirs
From bible to Beowulf, no different ways 
mold their minds, to be free it's too late
Different poems only for a big aim
To subject your free will, to fill up their game

Words...
Tears...
To feed up my mind
To fill up their game

Subjection of your free will
To be free to kill your
Sense of independence
The sense of your life
Subjecting your spirt
To be free o kill
The taste of your wisdom
The taste of your life
