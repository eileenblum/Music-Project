Journey's at the end, your wings
Are rotting away, greet new coming day
Now all dreams of yours are dead

I don't know how to say, life, how much
I love you, ice grows over me
There is nothing I can do

Don't try to shout No!, when winter
Is coming slow, muse your early age
Back hundreds of years ago

Nature cries for you, wanting you
Back to her womb
Now prepare yourself... the end is the start

And the funeral drum sounds to me like fun...

I wish you good night
When against sun you close your eyes
I wish you good night
When Nature is taking you back
I wish you good night
When good old ground embraces you
I wish you good night
When they meet you with love.

[M.I., B. II, Ps. IV, 71-91]
