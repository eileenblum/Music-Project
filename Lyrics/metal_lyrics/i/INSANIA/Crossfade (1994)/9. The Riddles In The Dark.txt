It cannot be seen, cannot be felt
Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.
It lies behind stars and under hills,
And empty holes it fills,
It comes first and follows after,
Ends life, kills laughter.

An eye in a blue face
Saw an eye in a green face.
That eye is like to this eye
Said the first eye,
But in low place,
Not in high place.

This thing all things devours:
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;
Gnaws iron, bites steel;
And grinds hard stones to meal;
Slays king, ruins town,
And beats high mountain down.

[M.I., taken over, B. II, Ps. VIII, 177-194]
