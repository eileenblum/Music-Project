We just wanna play aloud under ancient trees
We just wanna play aloud among mounting hills
We just wanna play aloud in the very nature's heart
We just wanna play aloud and birds will stop singing
And our words to the Moon will fly.

We just wanna sing to stars at the open sea
We just wanna sing to stars and rouse them from their sleep
We just wanna sing to stars under open sky
We just wanna sing to stars and stars will take us
Into a different world and different time.

We just wanna roam at night and speak with the passed away
We just wanna roam at night and hear what spirits say
We just wanna roam at night and look for light in dark
We just wanna roam at night and through the insane forest
Over springs and roots we'll escape far.

We just wanna shout our names and cut them into stone
We just wanna shout our names before we die alone
We just wanna shout our names from this funny heap of ground
We just wanna shout our names and that's why 
We'll make sonic mess till our souls fly to the other star.

[M.I., B. II, Ps. IX, 195-210]
