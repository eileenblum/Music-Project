Try to imagine dark forests with moonlit lakes, numerous hills, rushing streams, rivers...
think of misty waterfalls gushing down mountain sides, unknown creatures living deep in woods...
and minstrels who travel on foot through an autumn country gathering this all in their music...
Open your eyes and you're back in the cybernetic world... but all the borders vanish deep in
human mind... have you ever listened to thousands years old news on a digital tuner?...
This is Crossfade.
