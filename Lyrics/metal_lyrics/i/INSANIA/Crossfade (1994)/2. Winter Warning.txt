Raven's black wings screen the sky from my eyes
Through an evil scenery I fall to insane visions
These meddle with an imaginative reality
This way in our country winter starts

Trees raise their dry arm-bones to beseech the sky
Under their dead leaves earth stops to breathe
In the distance now I often hear the winter warning
This way in our country winter starts

[Myth Insania, Book II, Psalm I, Verse 1-8]
