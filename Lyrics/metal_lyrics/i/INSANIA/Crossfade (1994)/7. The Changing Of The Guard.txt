Far away behind the city's protective shield
Nobody can quit alive
Far away behind old rusty machines' dumps
That form the city's border lines
The land is dominated by a mouldy slime
In all directions crawling on at night
Screeches in horror that fly through the endless space
From the surrounded city come out
And slime is spreading wider
Trying to get inside!

The silent land, your eyes never beheld
With dead trees drowned in wet dust
A lot of streams sprung out of the poisoned earth
Make up lakes of pus
The land is dominated by a mouldy slime
In all directions crawling on at night
Screeches in horror that fly through the endless space
From the surrounded city come out
And slime is spreading wider
Trying to get inside!

From the first time, when the first rags of muddy slime
Out of sea crept to dry land
And to cold stars their desperate voices shouted
"I am man!",
The land is dominated by a mouldy slime
In all directions crawling on at night
Screeches in horror that fly through the endless space
From the surrounded city come out
And slime is spreading wider
Trying to get inside!

[M.I., B. II, Ps. VI, 123-152]
