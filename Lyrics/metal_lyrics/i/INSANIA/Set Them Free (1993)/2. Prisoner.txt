Gina was sixteen'n hot
every inch she looked so good
this damned old town was too small
she headed out to the movies

I told her a thousand times
please don't go away
and when she left me
(I knew) I won't surrender

She always told me that I'm a sucker
now she's fighting on the streets for her life

Realize little prisoner
your dream is dreamed and over
Realize little prisoner
your dream is dreamed, over'n'out

I just looked into her eyes at the day of no return
I saw an empty space that I won't remember
I told her once again please don't go away
and when she left me I just heard a laughter

She always told me that I'm a sucker
now she's fighting on the streets for her life

Realize little prisoner
your dream is dreamed and over
Realize little prisoner
your dream is dreamed, over'n'out

Thousands of sluts they're passing my brain
'cause I got the way how to die
I've got the powder which boils in your veins
come take my dreams and you'll fly

All it was a dream of tomorrow
a dream of fame and gold
Another day a sirenge is sticking in her veins
another day 'n' you're dead
