Somewhere in the midnight
where the dark is running cold
somewhere in the lonelyness a cry

Somewhere in the midnight
where the earth was burned by nukes
a child is born sick and deformed a cry

Before her eyes a child is born
before her eyes sick'n deformed

She memorized the lightning
the smoke, the wind, the rain
she memorized the stormy day the heat

No one warned the danger
all the years before
No one warned the deadly mess
they'd cheated

Children, children, children of a lesser God
No one believes what they can see
just flesh but it lives
Children, children, children of a lesser God
No one believes what they can see
