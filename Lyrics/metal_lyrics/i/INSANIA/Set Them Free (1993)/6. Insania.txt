Here I stand and you don't see my fear
I hear you screaming for more, more, more
I know what your want I know how you feel
the loud is what you're living for

Raise your fists tonight no boundaries
join this time cigarettes 'n' alocohol
never stop, always on and on
never stop to scream for rock'n'roll

Beware and stay what your are
Beware the mania
Beware and stay what you are
You are Insania

All the time since the day that I was born
my behavior was a misery
kicks aside my life was just a fall
No place for me in this society
No, never stop we're playin' through the night
no once will stop us and no one will take our force
