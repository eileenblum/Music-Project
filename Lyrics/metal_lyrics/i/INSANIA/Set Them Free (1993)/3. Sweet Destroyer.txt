Sweet, sweet destroyer 
my blood started running wild 
Terrified, electrified, 
I was the little child

You'd spread your fire 
you'd filled me up with heat 
my heart was burned 
your feelings turned 
what's left are memories

I stand in the rain, 
tears are falling down

Sweet, sweet destroyer, 
what have you done to me 
you'd played your cards 
to reach my heart 
I was too blind to see

Pleasure fullfilled me 
when you were by my side 
I realized your deadly lies 
your love is just for hire

I stand in the rain, 
tears are falling down

Blood'n'fire I feel the pain 
no one told me how I should behave 
'cause deep inside my heart 
the flames they burn so hot 
you sweet destroyer are passing through my veins

Sweet, sweet destroyer 
inside you're cold as ice 
Sweet, sweet destroyer 
someday you'll pay your price
