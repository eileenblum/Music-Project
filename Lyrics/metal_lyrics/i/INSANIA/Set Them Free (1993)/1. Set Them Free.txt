A man walks 'round , around the ball
millions of dollars for his trips
In his hands the holy book
praying: 'Down the disease'

Hear what he prays,
don't trust the words
don't trust the lies 'bout the pill
millions of children
die by his words
die for belief in his lies
Set them free

He blesses the poor
someday god will help
he's marching on to another town
while they rest and wait for help
slowly the hunger rots 'em down

Hear what he prays,
don't trust the words
don't trust the lies 'bout the pill
millions of children
die by his words
die for belief in his lies
Set them free

Thanks god for making them believe
that I'm the holy father
next year I want to visit South America again.
The military's very nice
and the meals are very gently
Ha, Ha, Ha ...

Hear what he prays,
don't trust the words
don't trust the lies 'bout the pill
millions of children
die by his words
die for belief in his lies
Set them free
