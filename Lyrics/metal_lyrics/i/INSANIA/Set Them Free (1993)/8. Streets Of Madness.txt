I feel the sorrow I feel the pain 
frustrating sadness here today 
An amok fighter plays bloody games 
another breakout who's to blame

I've seen this madness each day it's on tv 
this is not the way the things should be

I can't find a reason what's goin' on 
immens aggression to be someone 
A fistful of liars 'n' million of worms 
an endless killing, nuclear storms

I've seen this madness each day it's on tv 
this is not the way the things should be

Living on the streets of madness 
I'm fighting to survive 
Living on the streets of madness 
I'm fighting to survive

Running, hiding, fighting in the night 
Running, hiding, fighting for your lives
