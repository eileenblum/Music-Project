Every year it is the same
the island calls it's pilgrims.
From the cold we're running into the heat

Every year always the same
we're following our tribes.
From the cold running into the heat

I saved my money just to be
to be there in this hell
a dream of it makes me feel
makes me feel like under spell

From the cold we're running into the heat
summertime feels so good
All the girls gonna ease my pain
like never before

At the day we're lying
like the fishes in their box
in the night I'm on the run
I wish that it will never stop

From the cold we're running into the heat
summertime feels so good
All the girls gonna ease my pain
like never before

After all I take no fall,
just two weeks therapy
After all I need no doc for me

Seasons, seasons in hell
