They say we'll be the falling ones
the future knows no doubt
it seems that nobody cares what we do
A million times I dreamed of it
to kick 'em in their teeth beware of me
the next one could be you

I need my freedom it's all for my life
Slowly we rot ....
Slowly (it feels like shit) drinkin' lots of beer
Slowly we rot

Freedom has another spell
than working from 9 to 5
and then I show how I like to be
A million times I dreamed of it
to kick 'em in their teeth
beware of me the next one has to bleed

I need my freedom it's all for my life
Slowly we rot ....
Slowly (it feels like shit) drinkin' lots of beer
Slowly we rot

I know someday my time will come
there's no doubt about
and then I'll how you how I like to be
A million times I dreamed of it
to kick 'em in their teeth beware of me
the next one has to bleed

I need my freedom it's all for my life
Slowly we rot ....
Slowly (it feels like shit) drinkin' lots of beer
Slowly we rot
