Why did this all happen to me 
Lost my face - crawled on my knees 
Felt all alone, never a gain 
My life's running deep inside my brain

No more lies - I realize 
It's no way to disguise 
I make you visualize 
No more lies 
No more lies - I realize 
It's no way to disguise 
I make you visualize 
No more lies

To speak the truth (is) the only way 
To believe the things you say 
Take my hand, exist betrayal 
And together stand against all fake

No more lies - I realize 
It's no way to disguise 
I make you visualize 
No more lies 
No more lies - I realize 
It's no way to disguise 
I make you visualize 
No more lies

My memory - it is so full of lies 
I'm going to change my life 
No stranger I let in my tide 
(No) liars at my side

No more lies - I realize 
It's no way to disguise 
I make you visualize 
No more lies 
No more lies - I realize 
It's no way to disguise 
I make you visualize 
No more lies
