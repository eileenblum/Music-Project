Once more some weak thoughts crawl on her 
For another rainy day 
Look out in the world, seek for believing 
Too strong - the vessels in her mind

Too strong - the vessels in her mind

The last told prayer - out on her way 
The last told prayer - out of the grey 
A last told prayer to help her here 
A last told prayer to end her fear

And there's no one out there to see her sign 
And there's no one out there to clear her mind

The time you feel to face what's real 
There is so much to reveal 
And so you want to end these days 
A lonely child - a sorrowed face

The time you feel to face what's real 
There is so much to reveal 
And so you want to end these days 
A lonely child - a sorrowed face

It shed a tear when she was hit 
She was alone when he commited 
The crime a girl cannot forget 
The things he did - the things he said

The last told prayer - out on her way 
The last told prayer - out of the grey

Once more you think you'd loose control 
I will wait for you until the youngest day
