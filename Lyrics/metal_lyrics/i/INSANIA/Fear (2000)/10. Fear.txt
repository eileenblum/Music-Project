Forces - scattered their brains - (their) souls in decay 'til nothing remains 
No way - breaking the spell - no way to get 'em out of this hell. 
Stories - or just a word - torture my brain - really it hurts

Darkness - even - when the sun is shining 
Helpless - victims - silently they're crying 
Nameless - faces - but they used to know 'em 
Will they - ever - get back to remember?

Forces - scattered their brains - (their) souls in decay 'til nothing remains 
No way - breaking the spell - no way to get 'em out of this hell.

Only - fear is a thing we can't hide 
Stronger - than power is only our fear.

People - suffer - from minority and 
other - people - call to arms against 'em 
further - people - who defend the minor 
what if - we'll get - in the line of fire

Forces - out of control - (a) world on its way into a black hole 
Tell me - is it a game - tell me a reason - who is to blame?

Only - fear is a thing we can't hide 
Stronger - than power is only our fear

Like a word unspoken - like a song not heard 
Like a promise broken - we're ashamed of fear 
Like a plague avoided - like a fault denied 
Like a leper hated - we're afraid of fear

Still a sign of the weak - but a sign of the strong 
So it's you to believe - or to take me for wrong?

But I know now - we gotta face our fear 
But I know now - we gotta face our fear 
now now now

Someday - wake up - in a land down under 
only - six feet - far from storm and thunder 
Must get - up now - tell my silly dreams of 
voices - somewhere - fading out to farewell

Forces - scattered my brain - down in the dirt I'm going insane 
No way - out of this place - body and soul make their own ways

Only - fear is a thing we can't hide 
Stronger - than power is only our fear 
All our - courage driven by fear
