I don't know, I don't know why 
Tragedy has come to rule our lives 
Don't know, I don't know why 
Loneliness is the winter of mind 
To love somebody is to trust him blind 
Don't know, I don't know why 
Darkness is the shadow of light 
That's where we live, that's where we hide 
Don't know, I don't know why

Emotion be thy value 
Don't hide your sensitivity

Under the cover of night 
We walk for a fight 
But it takes lots of tears 
To get rid of all fears

I don't know, I don't know why 
Erase the names, cut out the past 
Don't know, I don't know why 
Who we are you ask, my friend 
Well we never lived in Jesus' hand 
Don't know, I don't know why 
There is no need for mind control 
Together we'll not sell our souls 
Don't know, I don't know why

Emotion be thy value 
Don't hide your sensitivity

Under the cover of night 
We walk for a fight 
But it takes lots of tears 
To get rid of all fears

Under the cover of night 
We walk for a fight 
But it takes lots of tears 
To get rid of all fears
