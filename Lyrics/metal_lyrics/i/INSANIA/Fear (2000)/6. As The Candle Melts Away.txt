You are like the ground 
Collect my thoughts and 
My emotions just like the earth - 
Droplets for the spring

You lead everything I am 
You lead everything I got 
Through and out of the dark 
Into the overflowin' light

A long time I've been 
Wandering through decades 
Spent the time (that) was given to me 
Not known - the target

Oh, you can't find the right way 
But then you've shown it to me 
As you always say 
"There is a straight way" - so why

Does the candle melt away 
As the candle melts away

You always say 
"There are friends to trust on" 
You just say 
"If there's triumph of lies 
Truth bestowes the end"

Slowly I start to believe 
All your words - so could I live 
On without them 
Oh - when there's no unite with my mind

As the candle melts away 
As the candle melts away

Thoughts - agony - make me walk around 
Wandering in fear 'bove the unknown ground 
Start to release there's no way to turn 
Hopelessness fills my life without you ...

You made me pray again 
Without a real sense 
You made me trust you bitch 
Don't believe the things I did

Now I can praise the Lord 
Everytime you're not with me 
Now that I know the truth 
Sleep well in eternity

Now that you left no trace 
Can't look in your (fu**in') face 
Wish that you won't pass my way 
Now this candle melts away
