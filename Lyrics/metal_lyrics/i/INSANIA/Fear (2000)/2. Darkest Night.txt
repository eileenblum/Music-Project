Runnin' out of time
I'm runnin' out of space
Searchin' for a light
A little trace
(To) lead me to a place called happiness
Got no time to stay â I gotta pass

Like a spell my sadness took me to this emptiness
False prophets I did obey had led me to this maze

Darkest night â (there) ain't no day
A glimpse of light â still far away

Couldn't realize
I couldn't take my chance
I've been lost in my
Own self-defence
Like a wheel my mind is turnin' round
(I'll) take my chance to flee from losing ground

Like a spell my sadness took me to this emptiness
False prophets I did obey had led me to this maze

Darkest night â (there) ain't no day
A glimpse of light â still far away

Darkest night â (I'm) leavin' now
Into this light â (I) got to go

Darkest night â (now) out of sight
Increasing light â (I) know I'm right
