Fallin' down - fallin' down 
With giant pace a wizard moves silently 
Another fate for oldest irons 
Another fake - a picture for the blind

Fallin' down - fallin' down 
The final need some puppets to play for them 
Toy soldiers in a senseless game 
Another mankind has gone insane

Locked to the challenge - before I get lost 
Forever bound - I choose my own fate 
Hopin' to find out that's the only way

Fallin' down - fallin' down 
What is this for - not just a dream 
Watch in the mirror - see the dust 
(While) watchin' their lives I realize that I'm

Locked to the challenge - before I get lost 
Forever bound - I choose my own fate 
Hopin' to find out that's the only way 
Forever bound - I choose my own fate 
Hopin' to find out that's the only way

So many wisdoms - so many more ideas to fail 
So many answers - create your own sense to this tale 
(The) meaning you find - so watch out for worth and weight 
Different opinions - so don't hesitate

Forever bound - I choose my own fate 
Hopin' to find out that's the only way 
Forever bound - I choose my own fate 
Hopin' to find out that's the only way
