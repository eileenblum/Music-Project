Never surrender, never give up
Walls that surround you can't stop you from movin'
(They) call you the one who's aproaching the wisdom
(The) master of fire, of water, earth and air

Watch out because of some dark souls behind you
(They) try to control you, your thoughts and your mind
Beware of the grabbers and crawlers around you
Don't let them take control of your fate

Move on â forward â never look back
Hold your â head up â resisting the lie

Travellin' on to a time
To find your peace of mind
Travellin' on â day by day
Travellin' on to a time
(The) fear you left behind
Travellin' on â day by day

Follow your instict, take all your chances
(You) know that you carry the hopes of mankind
They call you the one who's aproaching the answer
(You) rose up among us to make us understand

Move on â forward â never look back
Hold your â head up â resisting the lie

Travellin' on to a time
To find your peace of mind
Travellin' on â day by day
Travellin' on to a time
(The) fear you left behind
Travellin' on â day by day
