Sky is the gate and comet is the key
itâs logical that sky can be unlocked
but youâll never know which star is the lock
though youâre closer to the Secret this night...
...though youâre closer to us this stellar night...

On my way back home I found a precious stone,
the precious stone shone and flew up away with me.

Our souls follow the comet together,
through the endless sky they fly on. 

Sky is the gate and comet is the key
itâs logical that sky can be unlocked
but youâll never know which star is the lock
though youâre closer to the Secret this night...
...though youâre closer to us this stellar night...
