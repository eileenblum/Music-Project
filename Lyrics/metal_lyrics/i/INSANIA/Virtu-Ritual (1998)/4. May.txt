It was late night - the 1st of May -
- the May night - it was the time of Evil.
Batâs voice invited for evil,
where was a smell of pinewoods.

Silent moss whispered about evil;
erratic boulder lied evilâs grief,
fire sang its hate for stars
and from stars came a quiet sigh

My will is a raging swarm of forest bees, believe me,
a raging swarm of bees that are flying towards you.
Seventh daughter of Seventh daughter, my will is fear,
believe me, the thousand yearsâ power of May is in fear.

It was late night - the 1st of May -
the dance of druids cast shadows
In that shadows Life blazed up for the seventh time
in the womb of Seventh daughter.

My will is a swarm of bees,
of Walpurgis Night bees,
a raging swarm of bees
that are flying towards you.
