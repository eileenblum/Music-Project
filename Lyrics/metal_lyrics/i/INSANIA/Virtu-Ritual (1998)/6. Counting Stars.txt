Lifeâs an infection dead matter has caught
And Iâm no exception, weâre all the same sort
First star means time when earthâs joining the sky
Second star means time when youâre ready to die
And I am thinking of the times 
when our dreams were needed only at night.

Third star brings your mind much closer to mine
Fourth star is a comet - a fairy-taleâs sign
And I am thinking of the times ... 

And I am thinking of the times 
when our dreams were needed only at night.
And I am thinking of the night
you with me once more will be counting stars.
And I am thinking of the dawn
when from the river bank Huck Finnâs whistling to me.
And I am thinking of the film
running off while projectionist has died
And I am thinking of the agreed light signal
that I get from the stars
And I am thinking of the noon
I for first time will drink tears from your eyes
And I am thinking of the night...
And I am thinking of the times...
