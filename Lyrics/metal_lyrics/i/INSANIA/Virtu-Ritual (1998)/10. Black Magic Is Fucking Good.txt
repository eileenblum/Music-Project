It was that night when Computer told me:
"Ha! Ha! Ha! Fuck you! You are a part of my virtual reality."
And my patience ceased being infinite,
despite that the infinite took me to Cybermagic.

Joe was my elder and did time for a virtu-ritual murder,
despite that he was several years ahead of me 
in the study of black cybermagic. 
And that time Joe says: "Comet is at the zenith,
this night we both will be an aeon closer to Light." 

Prognosticon shined on the monitor like the Moon,
Joe instructed me and I gave the command "Activate Dark."
That Dark was the essence of Evil 
and Evil was the negation of Love
and me and Joe have been trapped by Cyberoccultism.

A vantina ninavantifitio a stresuescu frequentione
A vantina ninavantiossimo a computrescu distantione
A tinniedinnieabynnieazinniearynnie monitorum ecu brescu

The epitaph on my tombstone will say: Black magic is fucking good!

A shiver went down my spine when Joe sang those word
That formula radiated such a strong power that I did not expect
And Joe counted apocalyptic numbers by candle-light
And I wanted to go on down the left-hand path.

And the infinite was like an infinite "trip" for us
And Evil stopped being Evil, but was just a childrenâs game
And stars played that game with us instead of being afraid of us
And Cyberoccultism was our purgatory.

A vantina ... The epitaph on my tombstone will say:
Black magic is fucking good!
