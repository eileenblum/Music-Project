My soul flies above the horizon where the night keeps guard
My soul flies above the land where Sun is asleep
My soul flies through universe 
where the fate of Dark is the shadow of a star
that is falling down towards fires on the earth.

My power aims at heights which mountains reach
My power aims at forests where is no hope for Light
My power aims at my soul 
where the fate of Dark is the shadow of a star
that is falling down towards fires on the earth.

My magic whirls over a dragon where it sings with the wind
My magic whirls over a fire where it merges with smoke
My magic whirls in darkness where it searches like a spy
and with its message it flies back to fires.
