"Hush, wandering mother of black sky, weâre coming now."
"I saw Tropic of Dragon covered with rolling egyptian dark."
"Equator! Meridians! Stand by us, we need your might!"
"I had a dream about solstice dying in astral wizardsâfight."

Hush now, planet, we are coming now...

"Magical symbols drawn on the rock, we call your names!"
"My last will is brought in dragonâs egg to you through cosmic flames."
"We hear tunes of blind sunâs ballad lost long ago."
"I am the sun, in the form of fiery cloud through this sunny night I float."

Hush now, planet, we are coming now...
...Hallo, you hear me? This is the astral traitor speaking... Bad news - this is the
night of my arrival, of the great astral betrayal, of the false sun, the sunny night...
Sunny night...
