I sing to vipers when they return to me through the dark
When vipers fall asleep on my breasts towards midnight

I sing to fires that blaze up towards stars
When I rock sleeping fire in my lap towards midnight

La, la, la, la ...

We swarm to fly away to dark regions
To Moon, my little sister, donât look for us there...
