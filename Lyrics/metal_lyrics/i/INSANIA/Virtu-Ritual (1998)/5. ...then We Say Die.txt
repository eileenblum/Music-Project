When you say you fear of losing and licking
When you say itâs reason why you donât want to defy
Then we say: OK, there is no place for you on this playground
We say you do not deserve to play with us this game

When you fear, when you say you fear, then we say: die

When youâre afraid of being ridiculed by morons
When you say that there is always enough time to wait
Then we say what the hell you think youâll be waiting for?
We say: wake up, stupid, youâll be waiting for your death

When you fear, when you say you fear, then we say: die

When youâd like to obey stars, but failureâs what you fear
When you say you want to live, you must protect your life
Then we say: poor guy, you donât have to be afraid
Your life to which you cling so much is worth a pile of shit

When you fear, when you say you fear, then we say: die
