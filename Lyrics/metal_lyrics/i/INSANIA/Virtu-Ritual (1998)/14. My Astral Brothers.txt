Mama said: "I hate you" two seconds before she died
She always preferred midnight with the light-echo
If you dream of dark side of the sun, you are not blind
My Therapy of full-moon finds lost light in your mind, light in your mind!

Daddy tried to read my fortune from the tarot cards
Iâll never forget his frightened face that day
I feel Iâve lost brothers during hybernation sleep
From the peak of pyramid I face open sky, face open sky!

I wonât be terrestrial when you read these lines of mine, 
Yes, my brothers, astral brothers are coming for me now!

Six years old I learnt my home is Star of Flaming Rat
Gentle pain is sweet, I use it as a toy
I see fear of death as ritual of mayflies
I see dreams of Labyrinth as flames in your eyes, flames in your eyes!
