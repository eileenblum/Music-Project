Pray! As you think of winter dreams cancelled by Sun
Pray! As you feel the orgasm of summer storms
Pray on my side! Stay on my side!
And set free fire-flies - the astronauts of summer nights!

And if you shut your mouth, you will hear me praying up to you
And if you close your eyes, you will see the never seen
And if you tell me truth, in my dreams youâll learn the real truth
Then one Midsummerâs Eve I will ask you to kill me.

Pray! To be born again in the same place and same time
Pray! As you read by black candle-light my last will
Pray on my side! Stay on my side!
And set free fire-flies - the astronauts of summer nights!
