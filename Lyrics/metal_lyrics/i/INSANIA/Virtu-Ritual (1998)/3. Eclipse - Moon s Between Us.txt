Moonâs between us
Between you and me
Between my hate and your love
Between us.

Moonâs between us
Between you and me
Between my dark and your light
Between us.

Between you and my evening bell
This night by moon I am eclipsed

(Between your faith and my sin
All this life Iâm living in eclipse)

Moonâs between us
Between you and me
Between my dreams and your life
Between us.
