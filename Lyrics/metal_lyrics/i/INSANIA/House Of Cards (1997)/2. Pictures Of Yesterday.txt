Rainy day, watchin' out of my window
Thinking of a time when the river did flow
And all the hills arose in pride
And all the seas awoke by morning-light

Pictures of yesterday - painted in my head
As longer as their colours change - I will go ahead

Full moon night, flowin' Ingo a new morn
Dreaming of a star that is soon to be born
While other worlds prepare to die
Or still have gone although we see their light

Pictures of yesterday - painted in my head
As longer as their colours change - I will go ahead

Like a wheel in the universe
Like a big machine you can't run away
Like a power of an magic source, (it's) gonna last forever
Like a neverending force
