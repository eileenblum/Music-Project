I'm so tired of all fighting
In the wars that I have been
It hurts to march all over killing fields to nowhere
Only sorrow you will find now
If you look into my eyes
I feel so disillusioned after all

Hey - hear me calling - now I know
Ain't no reason to follow their order to go

'Hero' I should be, a man forever free
But I'm the broken one, who had to fall
'Hero' all my life, a promised paradise
Now I'm the broken one, who's left alone

Once I was so proud of marching
Everywhere they sent me out
And me returning to my fatherland in glory
All my dreams now are empty
In my mind just loneliness
It's hard to lose illusions your once had

Hey - hear me calling - now I know
Ain't no reason to follow their order to go

'Hero' I should be, a man forever free
But I'm the broken one, who had to fall
'Hero' all my life, a promised paradise
Now I'm the broken one, who's left alone

Will there come a time for changing
And all the wars to turn to silence
Or is it just a dream for evermore?
Someday we will get the answer - and all the blood will turn to water
But here will be no winner anymore!

Will there come a time for changing
And all the wars to turn to silence
Or is it just a dream for evermore?
Someday we will get the answer - and all the blood will turn to water
But here will be no winner anymore!

Hey - hear me calling - now I know
Ain't no reason to follow their order to go

'Hero' I should be, a man forever free
But I'm the broken one, who had to fall
'Hero' all my life, a promised paradise
Now I'm the broken one, who's left alone
