So let me tell you now 
What it is all about 
If you sell out your soul 
This is no game

The story began some hundred years ago 
All of my life in fear of future 
Some kinda warm when he was passing by 
Something weird I couldn't understand

So far so near, world of fear 
Beyond the other side

Never again I should see a dawn 
Kill to survive my curse of future 
I gotta pay for everlasting life 
Felt abused by an only friend

So far so near, world of fear 
Beyond the other side

I'm a fool in a world of the undead 
Lost between the shores, like a ferryman 
I've seen the wars, I've seen the black death 
I can't forget the holocaust 
Enola Gay at all

Thoughts of her over centuries 
Feelin' damn depressed, there came a little girl 
He stole again her blood and her mind, 
he used her as a sacrifice 
I couldn't stand it all

She, so cruel, was born for murder and 
Liked the bloody game, 'til she realized 
With all her might she burned out his face 
But couldn't get the gift of life 
It's been too late at all

There is no end, it's going on and on 
Kill to survive, eternal future 
Meet him again, maybe another time 
Another place I'll never understand

So far so near, world of fear 
Beyond the other side

But now I'm here, no more fear 
I'm on the other side

Now you have heard it all 
About my rise and fall 
No way I lost my soul 
This was no game
