Don't you fear the silence, (it) ain't gonna hurt at all 
A chance to think about you - who you are? 
Take care of every minute, be aware of every day, 
'cos life is far too short - to throw away.

Lay down your indifference, there's too much wasted time, 
It's only up to you - you're alive. 
Try to share a minute, it might become a day 
'cos everything you share - it ain't away.

There is a rainbow in the end 
Rising after a thunderstorm.

Don't you fear the silence, (it) ain't gonna hurt at all 
A chance to think about you - who you are? 
Take care of every minute, be aware of every day, 
'cos life is far too short - to throw away.

There is a rainbow in the end 
Rising after a thunderstorm. 
I really hope you'd understand 
Why I'm here and I sang this song.
