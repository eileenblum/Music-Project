Child of tomorrow, you'd burn in a fire 
You would inherit the pain of today

World of tomorrow, they call it a cage 
Lacking an entrance or exit they say 
I know for all that you will understand 
I had to lead you onto you own way

It's really senseless to believe 
A loser you were born 
Oh little child, dry your eyes

Child of tomorrow, you'd burn in a fire 
You would inherit the pain so they say

It's really senseless to believe 
A loser you were born 
Oh little child, dry your eyes

It's really senseless to believe 
A loser you were born 
Oh little child, dry your eyes
