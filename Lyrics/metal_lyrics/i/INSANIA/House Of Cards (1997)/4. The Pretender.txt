You've got a kind of friends I don't like 
You've got a kind of friends I hate 
You're only counting my mistakes 
You're only talking 'bout my faults

You're treating me in such a badly way 
You're nearly driving my insane 
I cannot stand you anymore 
Get outta my mind 
Get outta my way

You are the winner and I'm still the fool 
'Cos you play your game with your dirty rules 
You're running away just to make me wait 
So it looks you're in time and I'm too late

You're treating me in such a badly way 
You're nearly driving my insane 
I cannot stand you anymore 
Get outta my mind 
Get outta my way

You're treating me in such a badly way 
You're nearly driving my insane 
I cannot stand you anymore 
Get outta my mind 
Get outta my way
