his poisoned pen hurts once to deep 
now he's a wolf among the sheep 
he was so true without a sin 
now truth is something strange for him 
one for all and all for one 
the same ideals we marked upon 
but nevermore like yesterday 
he lost his spirit on his way

his poisoned pen will hurt no more 
his mind is rotten to the core 
now i'm the truth and he's the sin 
believe me I would pray for him 
but i am all and he is none 
betraying all he marked upon 
forever now his spirit's gone 
but i got mine to carry on ...
