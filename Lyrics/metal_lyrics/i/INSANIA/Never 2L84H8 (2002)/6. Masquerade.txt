she's the wave that keeps me carryin' on
holds the key the one to free my soul

like the night - oh like the night that has awaken me
feel the fire - i feel the fire that's burnin' deep in me
(i'm) haunted by her magic spell, i can't escape her game
(i'm) locked into her mystic eyes - am i the one to blame?

when i'm down i'm feelin' lost and blue
when darkness surrounds (me) hear some strange cry
when i'm gone all i want to know

all i fear it lies deep behind your masquerade
won't you ever show your real face
cannot see what you hide behind your masquerade
you're the lust that sealed my fate

she's the power that keeps me still alive
risin' flames to feed my inner pride

like the blood - the blood i feel that's flowin' in my veins
there's a might - confusing might that's torturing my brain
something in my mind demands for things i cannot see
in your eyes and in your heart i'm locked without a key

when i'm down i'm feelin' lost and blue
when darkness surrounds (me) hear some strange cry
when i'm gone all i want to know

all i fear it lies deep behind your masquerade
won't you ever show your real face
cannot see what you hide behind your masquerade
you're the lust that sealed my fate

when i'm down i'm feelin' lost and blue
when darkness surrounds (me) hear some strange cry
when i'm gone all i want to know

all i fear it lies deep behind your masquerade
won't you ever show your real face
cannot see what you hide behind your masquerade
you're the lust that sealed my fate
