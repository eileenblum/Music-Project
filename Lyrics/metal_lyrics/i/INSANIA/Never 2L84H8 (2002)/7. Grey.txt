i'm gonna leave this world today
remember back a place so cold
escape to find some better place
leave my body, free my soul
i'm gonna leave your life today
your love and warmth, your tenderness
leavin' all that hurts behind
all remains ... just agony

grey ' as my wishes melt away, all i see seems so unreal
pray (to) be born another age, like a sunrise in myself
grey - as my wishes melt away, all i see seems so unreal
pray (to) be born another age, like a sunrise in myself

so i'm leaving this world today
no pain shall hit me anymore
no lonely soul to plague my life
hunted deep into this loneliness
ain't no shelter for my fears
maybe i'm not what you thought
hold my hands before my eyes
hide away the tears i cry ' it's ...

grey ' as my soul starts to decay, all the things seem so unreal
pray (to) be born another age, like a sunrise in myself

surely i will be missing your love
distance and closeness ' all things you gave
i'm fading away into loneliness
hide myself ' forgotteness
once you brought my face to light
once you warmed my lonely mind
will i ever see the signs
will i keep your face inside, it's ...

grey ' as my wishes melt away, all you said seemed so unreal
feel the birth of a new age, like i'm reborn by myself

grey - as you're going straight to hell, i'm not going to play your game
i know you're the one's to blame, as i take your life away
