dead - alive - reborn out of my grave 
i'm led only by your sweet smell 
and my tired body tries creeping up on you 
once again i'm forced by my greed

out in these nights, out in these nights 
seeking for some sweeter life 
out in these nights, out in these nights 
seeking for some other life

i taste your blood, drops still stuck here on my lips 
let me drink your love just once more 
but now you lay there lifeless and cold 
and again i'm led by this force

out in these nights, out in these nights 
seeking for some sweeter life 
out in these nights, out in these nights 
seeking for some other life

no trace of life left in you, givin' rights to my greed 
eyes are staring wide opened, your soul makes itself rare 
your blood now flowin' in my veins, forever on and on 
makes my soul wake up now, hearing the wolves howling

greed in these nights - seeking for some sweeter life 
greed in these nights - seeking for some other life 
greed in these nights - so why do i have to live forever? 
greed in these nights - tell me why i had to live that way

ready to hunt another time, for you no place to hide 
flee into the dark of night, save it safe my might 
i don't know how to find my love, she slowly passed away 
lovin' you forevermore until i go to hell

greed in these nights - seeking for some sweeter life 
greed in these nights - seeking for some other life 
greed in these nights - so why do i have to live forever? 
greed in these nights - tell me why i had to live that way
