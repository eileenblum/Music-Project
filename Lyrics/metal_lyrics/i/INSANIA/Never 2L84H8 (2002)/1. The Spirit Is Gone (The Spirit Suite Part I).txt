somewhere in time - on through the night 
among the living our forces allied 
denim and leather - hellbound forever 
riding the lightning to praise - the day ...

hell awaits - as he broke the oath 
judas the sinner was fighting the world 
the iron fist - of heaven and hell 
showing no mercy to him - no way! ... 

he is alive - believes to tell the wrong from right 
but in fact he lost his mind - in a world of black and white 
burning all the witches seems to him the only way 
in the end he is the one to burn at his own stake 

no prophet of steel - no hammer to fall 
can break down the jericho wall after all 
restless and wild - the beast inside 
screaming for vengeance again - today ...

he is alive - believes to tell the wrong from right 
but in fact he lost his mind - in a world of black and white 
burning all the witches seems to him the only way 
in the end he is the one to burn at his own stake

the poisoned pen scared once too deep 
now he's a wolf among the sheep 
he was so true without a sin 
now truth is something strange to him 
one for all and all for one 
the same ideals we marked upon 
but nevermore like yesterday 
the spirit he once kept has gone â away...

he is alive - believes to tell the wrong from right 
but in fact he lost his mind - in a world of black and white 
burning all the witches seems to him the only way 
in the end he is the one to burn at his own stake
