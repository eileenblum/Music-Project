a man walks 'round , around the ball
millions (of) dollars for his trips
in his hands the holy book
and it's praying: "down the disease"

hear what he prays, don't trust words
no more lies 'bout hell
lots of children suffer pain
masses die in vain
set them free

he blesses the poor someday god will help
he's marching on (to) another town
while they rest and wait for help
slowly hunger rots 'em down

hear what he prays, don't trust words
no more lies 'bout hell
lots of children suffer pain
masses die in vain
set them free

thanks god for making them believe
that i'm the holy father
next year i want to visit south america again
the military's very nice and the meals are very gently
ha, ha, ha

hear what he prays, don't trust words
no more lies 'bout hell
lots of children suffer pain
masses die in vain
set them free
