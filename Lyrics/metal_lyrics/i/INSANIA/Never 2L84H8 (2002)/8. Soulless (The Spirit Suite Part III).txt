his spirit's lost without a trace 
he hides behind a second face 
his heart is now as cold as ice 
time claimed its sacrifice

the only point we could unite 
too far away to see 
the only place to meet 
not more than an ancient ruin

soulless - any single word he writes 
is just like a breath in vain 
hopeless - we will never reunite 
get out of my way

he's at the point of no return 
all he believed in he has burned 
i think of dreams we used to share 
they've turned into nightmares

i never thought we could divide 
but we were torn apart 
the only place we meet 
not more than an ancient ruin

soulless - any single word he writes 
is just like a breath in vain 
hopeless - we will never reunite 
get out of my way
