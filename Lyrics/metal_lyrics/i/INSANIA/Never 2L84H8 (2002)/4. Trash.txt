still we suffer - the old disease 
minds poluted - brains are freezed 
circles are turning - while we stagnate 
(we're) fed up with glory - believe in fake

nothing is as simple as we really are 
do we really think to be the only ones? 
we just count on what we got 
rely on just a single part 
live our little world ...

we develop - in rise of shares 
minds retire - but no one cares 
science we measure - in gain and loss 
limit progression - repeating odds

nothing is as simple as we really are 
do we really think to be the only ones? 
we just count on what we got 
rely on just a single part 
live our little world ...

we are trash of evolution 
we are nothing - we are none 
we are lost - without solution 
no denying: future is when we are gone 
(in time)
