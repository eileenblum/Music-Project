[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Korsback]

As I am thinking 'bout my future,
And as I try to clear my mind.
I get these visions of my past life,
All these pictures passing by.

Now I am heading for tomorrow.
Maybe to lead another life,
A life in harmony, no sorrow,
And without selfishness or lies.

I got that feeling that nobody cares at all.
I got that feeling that I'm on my own.

I`M LEAVING FOR MY WORLD MADE OF CHRYSTAL,
IT LOOKS LIKE SNOW AND IT`S MY PARADISE.
IT`S GLEAMING EVEN WHEN THE SUNLIGHT IS GONE,
I CALL IT "WORLD OF ICE".

Now I am planning "world of glory",
What I shall do when I am there.
There won't be tears there won't be bad times,
'Cause I'll be king and I will bear.

I got that feeling that nobody cares at all,
I got that feeling that I'm on my own.

I`M LEAVING FOR MY WORLD MADE OF CHRYSTAL,
IT LOOKS LIKE SNOW AND IT`S MY PARADISE.
IT`S GLEAMING EVEN WHEN THE SUNLIGHT IS GONE,
I CALL IT "WORLD OF ICE".

[SOLO: Juhano / Both]

[REPEAT: Bridge &amp; Chorus]
-WORLD OF ICE!!!
