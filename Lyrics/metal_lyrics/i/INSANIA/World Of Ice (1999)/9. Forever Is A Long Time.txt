[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Korsback]

Sittin' here waiting, and I'm bleeding on my knees.
It hurts so much inside and I'm sure I know what it means
As I am crying I see my own tears on the floor,
I'm still sittin' waiting for your hands to knock on my door.

And I remember what I felt before-
How close our love has been from dying.
I wish that I could say -"I feel no more",
But here I am and I'm still crying, still crying...

I listen to muisc, I remember all our songs,
But now they have lost their words to the one whom my heart belongs.
Standing next to this payphone, am I man enough to call you?
I'm thinking 'bout the words you've said, and I wish I knew they were true.

'Cause I remember what I've done before,
How many times that I've been lying.
To say "I'm sorry"- that won't give no more.
But here I am feels like I'm dying, I'm still crying...

PLEASE DON'T BE GONE FOREVER,
NOT FOREVER, LITTLE ANGEL OF MINE.
BUT DON`T YOU KNOW FOREVER- IS A LONG TIME.
