[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Korsback]

The year was 1629, a ship was crossin seas.
Storm and heavy weather was their only enemy.
Rain was falling from the clouds, and thunder crossed the sky,
The captain and his crew onboard were praying to survive.

But no- Noone heard them praying.
No- Noone heard their cries...

IN THE NIGHT, THERE WERE CRIES.
SYMPHONY OF RAIN AND THUNDER PUSHED AWAY THE LIGHT.
IN THE NIGHT, THERE WERE FRIGHT.
LIGHTINGS PAINTED UP THE SKY AS STORMWAVES TOOK ALL LIVES-
-IN THE NIGHT!!!

Morning came with sunlight as the ship was sliding still,
Dockers in the seaport waited as "she" was closing in.
Emptyness was total and there was no sign of life,
Noone knew what happened to them all that stormy night.

But no- Noone heard them praying.
No- Noone heard their cries...

IN THE NIGHT, THERE WERE CRIES.
SYMPHONY OF RAIN AND THUNDER PUSHED AWAY THE LIGHT.
IN THE NIGHT, THERE WERE FRIGHT.
LIGHTINGS PAINTED UP THE SKY AS STORMWAVES TOOK ALL LIVES-
-IN THE NIGHT!!!
