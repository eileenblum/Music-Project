[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Korsback]

On the battlefield - where the sun was standind high,
Many hundreds of men were fighting side by side.
With fire in their hearts, and ice in their veins,
They promised themselves never to surrender.

WITH SWORDS MADE OF STEEL, AND VOICES TO REVEAL,
THAT CLANSMEN COULD SET FIRE ON THE SKY.
WITH HEARTS MADE OF STEEL, THE HISTORY CAN REVEAL,
THAT SCOTLAND FOUGHT WITH COURAGE AND PRIDE.

On the battlefield where the time now had come,
For the scottish men to bring freedom to their land,
William Wallace was the one, a leader "one of a kind",
They waited for his sign when he raised his hand.

WITH SWORDS MADE OF STEEL, AND VOICES TO REVEAL,
THAT CLANSMEN COULD SET FIRE ON THE SKY.
WITH HEARTS MADE OF STEEL, THE HISTORY CAN REVEAL,
THAT SCOTLAND FOUGHT WITH COURAGE AND PRIDE.

THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM,
THE ARMY OF THE ENGLISH KING STOOD ON THEIR KNEES.
WITH HEARTS MADE OF STEEL, THE HISTORY CAN REVEAL,
THAT THEY SACRIFIED THEMSELVES FOR FREEDOM AND PEACE.

[SOLO: (Both / Juhano / Vastila / Niklas / Both)]

[REPEAT: Chorus]

-WITH HEARTS MADE OF STEEL, THE HISTORY CAN REVEAL,
THAT MANY CLANSMEN CAN NOW REST IN PEACE.
