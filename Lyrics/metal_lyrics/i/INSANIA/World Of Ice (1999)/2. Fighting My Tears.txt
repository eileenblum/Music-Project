[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Korsback]

Throwing my thoughts out in anger, trying not to cry.
The time is up, now I'm leaving, and I wonder why.

But I'm planing my future: I'll come back again and
when-
I'll try to stay!

I can not live where I'd like to, and I feel so sad.
Father fate, tells me to stay here, and it's not that bad.

But I'm planing my future: I'll come back again and
when-
I'll try to stay!

I'M GAZING AT THE SKY, AND I CAN'T NOT DENY...
I LIKE THIS PLACE JUST MORE AND MORE,
OUTSIDE ITS WINTERNIGHT, PAINTED IN SNOW SO WHITE,
I LIKE THIS PLACE JUST MORE AND MORE, AND MORE !

I will be away for along time, but I will return.
I'm fighting my tears as I'm leaving, I will never learn

But one day the sun will rise, and chase away the rain,
I will be there again!

I'M GAZING AT THE SKY, AND I CAN'T NOT DENY...
I LIKE THIS PLACE JUST MORE AND MORE,
OUTSIDE ITS WINTERNIGHT, PAINTED IN SNOW SO WHITE,
I LIKE THIS PLACE JUST MORE AND MORE, AND MORE !
