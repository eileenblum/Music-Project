[Music &amp; Lyrics: H. Juhano]

Open your eyes, don't be so blind
Be ready to face our reality
Live free and die, someday you'll find
What's hiding in your fantasy.

Don't waste your life and give up your dreams.
Open the door and tell me what do you see
Inside your heart made of fire and steel.

I SEE AND DREAM VISIONS OF HOME
LANDSCAPES ALL COVERED BY ICE AND SNOW.
I'M GUIDED BY AN EAGLE ON MY WAY,
AND A RAINBOW PAINTS UP THE SKY TODAY

Fight, fight for the things you believe in
Never give up, fly your own way.
New life begins and lights coming your way
Open the gate and fly through the day

You've gotta live, and follow your dreams
Open the door and tell me what do you see
Inside your heart made of fire and steel

I SEE AND DREAM VISIONS OF HOME
LANDSCAPES ALL COVERED BY ICE AND SNOW.
I'M GUIDED BY AN EAGLE ON MY WAY,
AND A RAINBOW PAINTS UP THE SKY TODAY
