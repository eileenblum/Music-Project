[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Korsback]

There are no heroes no they really stink,
Can't even walk straight after thirteen drinks.
And in the movies they refused to cry,
But in the real world we all are gonna die.

Come take my hand 'cause I'm a real man,
Please let me show you all the things I can.
If you have the guts to wash off your pride,
Please come with me and take a ride.

I feel your fingers under my belt,
I start to breathe fast, you make me melt.
When I touch your body you're melting like snow,
Let's keep the heat up, this is our show.

ROLLING AROUND IN THE BED FULL OF SWEAT,
OUR PARADIS SHOW IS SO WET.
DON`T WAKE ME UP IF I SLEEP AND HAVE A DREAM,
LET ME BE YOUR PRIVATE SEXMACHINE.

I spread my wings together we will fly,
I'll show you some feelings better than the sky.
Close your eyes and "hush" - don't say a word,
I'll show you into another world.

This is a game that I will never spoil,
Play with my engine and just taste my oil.
If you have the guts to wash off your pride,
Please come with me and take a ride.
