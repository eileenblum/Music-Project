[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Korsback]

What if we could travel right through time.
What if we could plan our fate, our destiny.
Maybe we should leave our lives behind.
And reach out for the hands of time.

[Bridge:]
Come this way, and we might meet again.
Only time can change our destiny.

Now it's time to leave,
Cause i must give my life a try.
And i know, that when i go,
I'm forever lost in time.

Maybe I will loose myself in time.
Maybe I will rest in peace between dimensions.
But what is our life without a try?
Can we find a goal without a destination?

[Bridge:]
Come this way, and we might meet again.
Only time can change our destiny

Now it's time to leave,
Cause i must give my life a try.
And i know, that when i go,
I'm forever lost in time.
