[Music &amp; Lyrics: P. Vastila / N. Dahlin]

Fighting through fire and fighting through hell.
Walking on clouds and walking on air.

[Bridge:]
I know I can manage without you, I know that my dreams will come true.
Cause I am the one who will stay strong.

Trying to find through the roads in my life.
Different choices, made everyday.
Trying to find a true soul inside.
The past won't haunt me, i never look back.

I'm feeling the pain again and again.
Approaching the future, I'll have my revenge.

[Bridge:]
I know I can manage without you, I know that my dreams will come true.
Cause I am the one who will stay strong.

Trying to find through the roads in my life.
Different choices, made everyday.
Trying to find a true soul inside.
The past won't haunt me, i never look back.
