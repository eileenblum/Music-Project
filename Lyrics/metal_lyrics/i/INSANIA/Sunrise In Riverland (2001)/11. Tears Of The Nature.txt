[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Korsback]

Inner feelings: Anger in vain. I can't take anymore.
No one needs to tell me what I'm fighting for.
From thunder to sunshine, From sunset 'til dawn, What the hell is going on?
Is this world about to lose control?

[Bridge:]
At least I know that I've been trying. But still our paradise is dying.

And i've seen it so many times, mankind must be blind.
Destroying and killing the nature in pain.
Was my tears for them in vain? -tell me no!!!

Still pollutions pond and dust: Nature bleeds everywhere.
Why ain't mankind smart enough to feel my fear?
My voice is the thunder, my breath is the wind, my tears are falling as rain.
Why ain't mankind smart enough to feel the same?

[Bridge:]
At least I know that I've been trying. But still our paradise is dying.

[Rep. Chorus]

"Why do we have to destroy what God and the nature have given.
Why do we have to destroy what was meant to be our paradise.
I thought mankind was smart enough to understand
that we were brought into this world for one reason:
To rule the earth and to be the head of a body called " nature".
Maybe the storms, the great fires and the earthquakes are just
another way to punish us. And I believe - That's just what we deserve"!

[Solo: P. Vastila / Both]

[Rep. Chorus]
