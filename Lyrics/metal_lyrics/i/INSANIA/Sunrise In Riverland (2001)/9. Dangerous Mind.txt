[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Korsback / N. Dahlin]

[Intro solo: N. Dahlin / N. Dahlin &amp; P. Vastila]

To climb the highest mountain needs a higher sky, oh no.
To dive the deepest ocean needs a clever mind, and a sign to follow.

[Bridge:]
Always a pressure to the edge, from my dangerous mind. Years passing by, I'm playing the same
old game- And it's always the same.

I'm searching for a challenge, I never beware. Oh no- I'm guided by fear. Wherever I go,
whatever I try, my dangerous mind is always so clear.

[Bridge:]
Always a pressure to the edge, from my dangerous mind. Years passing by, I'm playing the same
old game-And it's always the same.

Well, i'll keep on living, The same old way that i always lived.
And i'm still believing, That this world has more to give.

[Solo: Both / P. Vastila]

Well, i'll keep on living, The same old way that i always lived.
And i'm still believing , That this world has more to give.

[Solo: N. Dahlin]
