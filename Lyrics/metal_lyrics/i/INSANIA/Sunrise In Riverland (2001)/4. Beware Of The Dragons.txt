[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Korsback]

A long time ago, when dragons and humans ruled side by side.
The links were so strong, time just went on with no hate- no lies.

[Bridge: 1]
No evil, no pain. No power no throne.
But there was a man insane who claimed to rule alone.
He gave us no choice, No freedom or peace.
He gave us reality with painful memories.

The time just went on, our lives turned out wrong.
Cause no one could see: this man just changed our destiny, -beware of the dragons!

Dragons in anger and dragons in pain brought us fear again.
What mankind had won, was taken and gone by this man- insane.

[Bridge:2]
We refused to fight dragons, Cause we had to believe:
That mankind was ment to be with so much to achieve.
But we still kill in anger, And sometimes in hate.
Will we ever understand that we will loose god's faith?

The time just goes on, our lives turns out wrong.
Cause no one can see, that mankind changes destinies.
Maybe i'm wrong, maybe this can go on.
But maybe one day, god will make us pay, -beware of the dragons!

[Solo: Both / N. Dahlin / H. Juhano / P. Vastila]

The time just goes on, our lives turns out wrong.
Cause no one can see, that mankind changes destinies.
Maybe i'm wrong, maybe this can go on.
But maybe one day, god will make us pay, -beware of the dragons!
