[Music &amp; Lyrics: H. Juhano / M. Korsback]

Into my life it came, from a road that leads to nowhere.
It tears me apart, into pieces that won't fly away.
Then came the wind, that forced my eyes to see.
No one to blame, even though I am afraid.

[Bridge:]
Fight- I'm going to fight, even though I have no chance at all.
Give up is the last thing I will do.

In the deepest riverland it seeks and destroys.
Making a way for other kinds, it's a neverending war.
Facing my destiny, I know that I can't survive.
There is no turning back, and I know it's gone too far.

[Bridge:]
Fight- I'm going to fight, even though I have no chance at all.
Give up is the last thing I will do.

I will hold my head so high, and the silvertears they'll cry:
They will cry for no reason at all.
I will reach up to the stars, i will rise with the sun.
We'll unite our souls and together, we will stand all for one.

[Solo: Both / P. Vastila]

I will hold my head so high, and the silvertears they'll cry:
They will cry for no reason at all.
I will reach up to the stars, i will rise with the sun.
We'll unite our souls and together, we will stand all for one.

[Solo: Both]
