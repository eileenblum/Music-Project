[Lyrics: M. Korsback / H. Juhano / P. Vastila]

In the night, when you're walking all alone, seeing faces everywhere,
Being scared as hell as usual.
In the day, when the shadows are away, and the darkness cannot stay,
And you try to live as usual.

[Bridge:]
Is this really what you call reality?
Is this really how you think your life should be?

Take a look at the sky, when the night turns to day.
And the sun is painting the trees.
Try to escape, there are one million ways.
Fight and win to be free.

Can't you see, that my life's just misery? No matter how I try to be,
Cause my life goes on as usual.
What is life, without happiness within? If there's nothing left to win,
Why should I go on as usual?

[Bridge:]
Is this really what I call a perfect dream?
I'm smiling, laughing - not as joyful as it seems?
Take a look at the sky, when the night turns to day.
And the sun is painting the trees.
Try to escape, there are one million ways.
Fight and win to be free.

[Solo: Vastila / Korsback]

[Rep. Chorus]
