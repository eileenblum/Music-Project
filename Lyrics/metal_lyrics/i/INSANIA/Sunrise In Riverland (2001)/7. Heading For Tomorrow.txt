[Music: H. Juhano. Lyrics: H. Juhano / D. Henriksson / N. Dahlin]

Waiting for something to come and fulfill my dreams.
By taking away the days from my early years.

[Bridge:]
Feels like I'm running through eternity.
Right now it's time to find the key.

I'll take a ride on the wind, like a bird i'll spread my wings.
I will search for tomorrow, and the end of our time.
When i fly through the sky, might get little higher.
No one can save a world of this kind.

I can't believe all the things I've seen in my dreams.
The future lies close, far away from insanity.

[Bridge:]
Sometimes I wonder if I'll end up in heaven or hell.
I'll ask the old man, he will tell.

I'll take a ride on the wind, like a bird i'll spread my wings.
I will search for tomorrow, and the end of our time.
When i fly through the sky, might get little higher.
No one can save a world of this kind.

[Solo: Both / H. Juhano / N. Dahlin]

I'll take a ride on the wind, like a bird i'll spread my wings.
I will search for tomorrow, and the end of our time.
When i fly through the sky, might get little higher.
No one can save a world of this kind.

-ANYMORE !!!
