[Music &amp; Lyrics: M. Korsback]

A long time ago in the night: Many men dressed in white, ready to fight, For their land and to
be free. Driven by hatred and fear, and love to a land in despair, which they had to bear. Oh
their 
hearts were full of hope and dreams.

[Bridge: 1]
But they had to stand the pain. To have a chance to live again.
The nights were so cold many died while sleeping,
God it was cold even the sun was freezing. Even the stars seemed to freeze upon the sky.

The fear was so strong on both sides, many men lost their pride, broke down and cried. They
could feel the end approach inside. The air was so cold and so dry, that their bodies told lies,
about 
condition and time. Before their eyes their lives were passing by.

[Bridge: 2]
But they had to carry on. You don't survive if you're not strong.
The nights were so cold many died while sleeping,
God it was cold even the sun was freezing. Even the stars seemed to freeze upon the sky.

There's no more crying, and no more dying. Forever standing strong, we will carry on.
We live with pleasure, the fear is gone, In the land of the wintersun.
