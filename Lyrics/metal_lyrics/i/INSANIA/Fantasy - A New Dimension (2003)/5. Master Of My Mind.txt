No one should tell me to lose or prevail,
when to move slower or when to set sail.
I'm the master of my own mind.
And no one should tell me the biggest surprise,
comes when our leaders cannot compromise.
There's more than greed and ego to find.

They're lying, I'm crying
Deep inside I'm sacrifying
A lot of tears so hear my cries...

JUST TAKE A LOOK UPON THIS WORLD,
A LOT OF PRAYERS STILL UNHEARD,
WE NEED TO TRY...
TO TURN AROUND AND FACE THE EARTH,
AND MAYBE GIVE IT A REBIRTH
BUT IS THERE TIME?

I see the panic in your eyes.
You know your life is short,
but still there is time.
So please don't listen to all lies.
Just be strong
and show them that you rule your mind.

They're lying, I'm crying
Deep inside I'm scarifying
A lot of tears so hear our minds cry out...

JUST TAKE A LOOK UPON THIS WORLD,
A LOT OF PRAYERS STILL UNHEARD,
WE NEED TO TRY...
TO TURN AROUND AND FACE THE EARTH,
AND MAYBE GIVE IT A REBIRTH
BUT IS THERE TIME?
