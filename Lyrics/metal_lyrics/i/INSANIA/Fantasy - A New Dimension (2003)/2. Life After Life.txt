Never showing the pain
Always tried to live an easy way.
Sun comes after rain,
And he lived his life day by day.

Now he's gone and will forever be.
He will always live in our memories.

He never betrayed, never turned his back upon his friends.
He refused to give up, and he fought so hard until the end.

Now he's gone and will forever be.
He will always live in our memories.

TRAVEL FAR, DIMENSIOS WILL PASS YOU BY.
GALAXIES WILL SURROUND YOU 
WITH WIND, STARS AND LIGHT.
STAND UPRIGHT, ENTER THE PARADISE,
PROUD AND STRONG,
IT'S THE LIFE AFTER LIFE YOU WILL FIND.

He smiled again and again, 
Even though he had this heavy pain.
Strong - Refused to complain,
He got used to always feel the same.

Now he's up there far beyond the sky.
He will always live within our minds.

TRAVEL FAR, DIMENSIOS WILL PASS YOU BY.
GALAXIES WILL SURROUND YOU 
WITH WIND, STARS AND LIGHT.
STAND UPRIGHT, ENTER THE PARADISE,
PROUD AND STRONG,
IT'S THE LIFE AFTER LIFE YOU WILL FIND.
