In this world - lost and alone.
Nothing more, inside but pain.
My heart is like, a broken stone.
Piece by piece, I'll build it up again.

We all live in sadness,
cause this world is full of lies.
But I can change the picture,
Right before your eyes.

HERE IN MY WORLD, WE ALL LIVE AS FREE.
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW GREAT IT WILL BE.
SHOW ME YOUR THOUGHTS,
THEY'LL LIVE WITHIN ME.
THIS IS A WORLD, BUILT FOR US THREE:
YOU AND ME... - AND OUR FANTASY

We must learn  - to share and give.
Stand upright, we must be strong.
Our heavy load, we can't relieve.
No matter what, it all goes on.

We all live in sadness,
cause this world is full of lies.
I'll paint a nicer picture,
Right before your eyes.

HERE IN MY WORLD, WE ALL LIVE AS FREE.
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW GREAT IT WILL BE.
SHOW ME YOUR THOUGHTS,
THEY'LL LIVE WITHIN ME.
THIS IS A WORLD, BUILT FOR US THREE:
YOU AND ME... - AND OUR FANTASY
