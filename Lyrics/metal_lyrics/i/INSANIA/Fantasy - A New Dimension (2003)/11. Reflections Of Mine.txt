Like a rainbow in the sea of tears,
Can't you see my broken dreams?
So far away in a place deep inside.
I will try to send those tears away,
Into the light I see so clear, 
Will I ever get some peace in my mind?

In my own imagination, I can hear a voice.
Is this just an old illusion, do I have a choice?

IS THERE ANOTHER TOMORROW?
WILL THERE BE ANOTHER DAY
WHAT CAN I SAY - 'CAUSE I CANNOT PRAY.
I LIVE MY LIFE MY OWN WAY.
DON'T CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY, 
I WILL FIND THE BRIDGE OF LIGHT!

With my eyes of fire and silent cries,
Can't you see my hidden lies?
Reflecting myself in this lake made of tears.
When I find myself on the edge of life,
I realize I can't deny.
See through the light, and there's no more fear!

Somewhere in my imagination,
I can see a light.
Is this just an old illusion.
Reflections in my mind?

IS THERE ANOTHER TOMORROW?
WILL THERE BE ANOTHER DAY
WHAT CAN I SAY - 'CAUSE I CANNOT PRAY.
I LIVE MY LIFE MY OWN WAY.
DON'T CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY, 
I WILL FIND THE BRIDGE OF LIGHT!
