He was standing on a mountain high,
Reaching to the sky.
You'll never see a land so strong,
Ruled by one alone.
They were living free in harmony,
In happiness and peace.
No starving and no stealing,
No pain and no disease.

He's good, old, wise and clever,
So listen to his voice.
'Cause if you treat his people wrong,
He's giving you a choice...

FACE THE KING,
AND STAND FOR YOUR DEEDS.
HE IS NOW THE ONE
WHO RULES YOUR DESTINY.
FACE THE KING, GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES.
PAY YOUR SINS,
OR FACE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE FREE - 
FACE THE KING!

A sailor sailed across the world,
In search for land and life.
Through storms and heavy weather...
His ships with crew survived.
His heart was full of evil,
His mind was full of greed.
With rage he fought the people,
to satisfy his needs.

But the king to strong and clever, 
Gave too much injuries.
The ships now without crew
Can never sail the seven seas.

FACE THE KING,
AND STAND FOR YOUR DEEDS.
HE IS NOW THE ONE
WHO RULES YOUR DESTINY.
FACE THE KING, GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES.
PAY YOUR SINS,
OR FACE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE FREE - 
FACE THE KING!
