Sometimes when my life seems hard to understand.
Sometimes when it's hard to carry on.
The world is spinning on,
And everything goes wrong and nothing's won.

Sometimes when I'm sad and I  feel down and low.
And even light's too dark to see.
Respect is what I need
Instead of selfishness and greed,
My heart still bleeds, and it hurts so deep...

But then I hear this voice from deep inside. (it's calling me)
It makes me realize: I'm free...
Just to be me!!!

SO HERE I STAND AGAIN,
AND I'VE LOST THE PAIN.
AND I KNOW THAT I WILL SURVIVE.
HERE I STAND AGAIN,
AND MY HEART IS STRONG,
SO I KNOW THAT I WILL CARRY ON.

Sometimes when I find that thing
called "peace of mind".
I really have to hold on to it... tight...
I try to see things bright but when the days turns into night
It loses light, and I lose my fight.

But then again this voice from deep inside of me. (is calling me)
It gives me strength and I brake free...
Cause I'm still me!!!

SO HERE I STAND AGAIN,
AND I'VE LOST THE PAIN.
AND I KNOW THAT I WILL SURVIVE.
HERE I STAND AGAIN,
AND MY HEART IS STRONG,
SO I KNOW THAT I WILL CARRY ON.
