We're born in this world with voices unheard.
No one will hear if we're crying out loud.
Nor shelter nor home, but never alone.
The circle unites us and still we are proud.

It's the freedom we're calling
Screaming out loud to the sky.
We will strike without warning
Together we're aiming so high.

WE WILL FIGHT FOR FREEDOM AND GLORY,
FOR YOUR LIES YOU WILL BURN
WHEN YOU DIE.
BE PREPARED FOR OUR VENGEANCE
TO COME,
'CAUSE NO ONE CAN FLEE FOR ALL TIME.

We're trying to say what no one can hear.
We're trying to show what no one can see.
Our hearts full of pride, but minds full of fear.
One day we'll stand where no one has been.

 It's the freedom we're calling
Screaming out loud to the sky.
We will strike without warning
Together we're aiming so high!

WE WILL FIGHT FOR FREEDOM AND GLORY,
FOR YOUR LIES YOU WILL BURN
WHEN YOU DIE.
BE PREPARED FOR OUR VENGEANCE
TO COME,
'CAUSE NO ONE CAN FLEE FOR ALL TIME.
