Believe us stars often tell lies in a dream
Believe us stars often tell lies in a dream
I guard a sentry fire on a rock
At night I guard a fire on a rock

Believe us southern wishes deceive the course
Believe us southern wishes deceive the course
I hear ringing bells behind your shadow
I hear ringing bells behind your shadow

Believe us our lighthouse shines out of the Circle
Believe us our lighthouse shines out of the Circle
I hear what your ears cannot hear
I see what your eyes cannot see

Believe us we live in an astral dream
Believe us we live in an astral dream
I feel your soul as its Part
I feel your soul as its Part

[Myth Insania, Book III, Psalm I, verse 1-16]
