This time we'll be more cheerful
Happier than we were
This time we'll disobey calling of winter warning
and this time we will not scare

This time we'll take things easy
This time we will not frown
This time we'll try to ignore things
that cast me down

These times you can hear our music shout
That you don't need to think of cloudy sky

This time we betray Gandalf
And tears in a prophet's dream
This time we'll watch the sun-set without gloomy melancholy
this time we'll not scream

This time we'll sound more simple
Not to depress your minds
This time you'll reach a jolly mood
except some petty psalms

And these times you can hear our music shout
That you don't need to think of cloudy sky

Kill, kill, kill the gloom, kill the gloom which is your doom
Kill, kill, kill the gloom, kill it ...when looms

[M.I., B. III, Ps. II, 17-38]
