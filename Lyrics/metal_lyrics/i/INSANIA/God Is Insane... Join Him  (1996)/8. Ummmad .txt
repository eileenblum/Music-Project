God said: "Who's mad shall gather behind the camp."
And I swear there were just me and God himself
You could see only God and me came there,
God confinded to me he's insane
We sampled devil's voice on God's PC,
At that time I told God about my introvert schizophrenia

Mad! Ummmad! I run out into dark
Mad! Ummmad! My steps approach the town
I kick cathedral's door open, I climb the stairs to choir
And there from hights of Heaven my head's roaring: Ummmad!

This night kills light you took for primal glare
I am mad, not dead, search ways you'd never dare
You see carriage running down forest road,
See insane God on a driver's seat
You see me in dark following its tracks,
And in one-dimension space at lunatic speed
my thoughts run forward

Mad! Ummmad!...

This night belongs to lunatics - we're dancing above trees
And windy weather ruffles our hair with a gentle breeze
Everything's in fire, my soul's happy,
Black smoke's choking only ordinary people,
I'm high enough to survive!

[M.I., B. III, Ps. VIII, 171-195]
