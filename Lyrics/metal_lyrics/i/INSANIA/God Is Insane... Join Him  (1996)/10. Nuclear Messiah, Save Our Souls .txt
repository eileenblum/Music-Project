1) 30 000 BC I gave command to Computer
And I was surprised at what appeared on the screen:
"Ha, ha, ha! Fuck you've been part of my virtual reality -
- see: slave that must do what I will."

2) 30 000 BC I gave command "magic mirror"
And I was appalled at answer the monitor showed:
"Ha, ha, ha! Fuck you puppet have no chance to change
programme that has been involving your death'n'life."
I call first time - Magic Moonlight!
Nuclear Messiah, save our souls!

3) 30 000 BC on my way from lunar station
I gave Computer command "activate Decalogue"
"Ha, ha, ha!" appeared on the screen. "In the distance
of light-years I see glare that activates me."
I call second time - Mighty Moonlight!
Nuclear Messiah, save our souls! 

A vantina ninavantifitio a stresuescu frequentione
A vantina ninavantiossimo a computrescu distantione
A tinnie, dinnie a bynnie a zinnie a rynnie monitorum ecu brescu
And if you wanna die everything will be all right

4) 30 000 BC on the emergency wave-band
Our tribal Wizard received my calling for help
"Ha, ha, ha!" was the answer. "Your wizard is dying,
get ready for Evening of the shooting stars."
I call third time - Gracious Moonlight!
Nuclear Messiah, save our souls! 

[M.I., B. III, Ps. IX, 196-229]
