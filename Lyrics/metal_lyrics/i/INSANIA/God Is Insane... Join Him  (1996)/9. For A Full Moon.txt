Forest will welcome me with the voice of an owl
When day falls asleep at the speed of dark
Who sleeps at the time of light among boughs
Wakes up in the evening with a full moon

(Night comes when I wake, from me bad light night will shake
Sheltering my mind, no people will find
My hidden smiling soul rushing like an insane foal,
Night, I am your child!)

It's me under you
Your blood mixes together with mine
And in the evening I am restored to life with a full moon
It is me under you
My soul merges in dark
And proceeds in all black directions
