(I Am the Melancholic Beast And Excuse My Schizophrenia)

Listen, my dear daughters and sons
Let me talk to you before you go...
...Hey, you there, could you do something
with the mic? I mean the bloody feedback,... so
I would like to tell you I am happy seeing
all you married, healthy around me
Wish you satisfied living in your
undisturbed domestic circles' safety, I wish you...

Growing pressure creature feels
Valleys full of fear that kills
And wind is blowing away ashes of burnt native trees
I am speaking of Taedium Vitae - don't you nuts feel anything like this?

...Beg your pardon, among people I should hide
my fits in a better way...
...Boy, bring me glass of water...for you all kids
I have some more things to say:
Pray God let no nightmare trouble your peace
Let every day for you be feast
...But wait now, can you hear from the woods
the weeping roar of the Melancholic Beast? Can you hear?...

Growing pressure creature feels
Valleys full of fear that kills
And wind is blowing away ashes of burnt native trees
I am speaking of Taedium Vitae - don't you nuts feel anything like this?

...Please, excuse your father,
my schizophrenia is in an advanced state
But it'll be O.K., trust me that I love you
and your spouses...in spite of my hate
How I hate you that you've refused what I call
"adolescent life", feel sorry for your choice...
...What the hell am I kidding?...
...I feel so sorry, my dead girls and boys, so sorry...

Growing pressure creature feels
Valleys full of fear that kills
And wind is blowing away ashes of burnt native trees
I am speaking of Taedium Vitae - don't you nuts feel anything like this?

[M.I., B. III, Ps. VII, verse 132-170]
