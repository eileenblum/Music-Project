One blue night before I woke
From cliff we were watching the sea
All of a sudden windstorm came
And we ran down to welcome waves

One blue night we saw a light
Far off on the raging water
Calling us with sea-gull's voice
That challenge was too strong

And despite heavy rain
despite rising wind
the only wish we feel...
...now we want to be at sea

One blue night when sea was mad
We were casting boat off pier
Water's roar was rather sad
And therefore we were not afraid

One blue night we on the beach
Parted with an extinct lighthouse
Expected new adventures
And then followed the light

And despite heavy rain
despite rising wind
the only wish we feel...
...now we want to be at sea

And suddenly there is sun and pale blue sky
Over our heads singing birds
And when we look around we can see water
full of manycoloured trip boats

In them having great fun people
of loose manners waving gay at us
And little waves are playing with the sunbeams
Lapping against sides of the boats

Fishes peeping out from water
Splashing us cheerfully with their tails
And singing rude sailor songs along with all
There is slowly coming tea-time

Oxford A.L. Dictionary says:
"idyll" is a) prose, poetry
describing a happy peaceful scene
b) simple pleasant scene or event

One blue night I had a dream...

[M.I., B. III, Ps. III, 39-90]
