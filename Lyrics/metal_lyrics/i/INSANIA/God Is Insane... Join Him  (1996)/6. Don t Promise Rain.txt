We are bunch of wandering parched souls
Through the Desert of No Hope we roam
Don't promise rain! Don't promise rain!
When there is no hope, beg you don't promise rain!

We travel through large deserted land
On sky sometimes set eyes full of sand
Don't promise rain! Don't promise rain!
When there is no hope, beg you don't promise rain!

God, your false promises cause us pain
When there is no hope, don't promise rain
Don't promise rain! Don't promise rain!
When there is no hope, beg you don't promise rain!

[M.I., B. III, Ps. VI, 120-131]
