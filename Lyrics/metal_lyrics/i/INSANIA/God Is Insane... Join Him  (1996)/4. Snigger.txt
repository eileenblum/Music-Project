We shall snigger at things we once feared to figure
snigger at things we were afraid to figure
snigger at... things

We shall figure up days we were too down to snigger
digging out pains we felt too sharp to snigger
figure up... pains

As a little child I used to look forward to time
I was ill at home drinking hot tea with lemon
In bed read one adventure book after another
Then quite tired of fever I often used to fall asleep

And my slightly diseased brain for me created many
Fantastical stories in which I was the hero
I travelled five weeks in balloon...
... flew five weeks in balloon...

And basket swinging like ship, I'm searching in old maps
In the 1666 feet height
And among creaking ropes Baron Munchausen
Tells one more tale about Moon every night

And as I wake up the next morning fever's gone
My healed mind begins to figure up my time...

[M.I., B. III. Ps. IV, 91-110]
