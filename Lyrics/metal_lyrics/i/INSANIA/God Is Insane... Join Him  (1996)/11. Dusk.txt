Sun is setting down, gives way to the night
On all peaks around, fires in no time will blaze up...

Boys watch falling star, in hills shepherds die
Old men around fire, sing an ancient chant...

Leaves are falling down, chill comes from the ground
From woods coming dark returns all to past... forever...

[M.I., B. III, Ps. XI, 254-259]
