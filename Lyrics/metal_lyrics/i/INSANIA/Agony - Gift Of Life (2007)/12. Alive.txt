[Music: Keiski, Lyrics: Keiski / KorsbÃ¤ck]

I am on my own.
There are feeling unknown,theyâre not gone.
I thought I was free to live and fulfill all that I dreamed.

But it all changed so suddenly.
Life wasnât what it supposed to be.
And if I keep on standing still,
I know I wonât be free.

Iâve been down and paralyzed.
Questions running through my mind. Is this right?
I just want to live my life, but instead Iâm falling apart.

But it all changed so suddenly.
Life wasnât what it supposed to be.
And if I keep on standing still,
I know I wonât be free.

Iâm not alive if I canât live my own life,
Time passes by and Iâm loosing my mind.
Iâm not denying, deep inside Iâm crying.
Tears from my heart, hear me please,
Let me be alive.

[Solo]

I have come to realize.
I must loose all my fear, starting here.
It might take some time for me to grow strong
And just to break free.

Iâm not alive if I canât live my own life,
Time passes by and Iâm loosing my mind.
Iâm not denying, deep inside Iâm crying.
Tears from my heart, hear me please,
Let me be alive.

Iâm not alive if I canât live my own life,
Time passes by and Iâm loosing my mind.
Iâm not denying, deep inside Iâm crying, fighting, dying
Let me be alive.

(This song is about longing to be free and do what you always to do, but thereâs always someone who wants screw it up. Itâs important to not give up and keep on struggling. As a good friend once said to me: âKeep on doinâ what you believe in, thatâs the key to successâ)
