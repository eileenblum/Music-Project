[Music: Insania, Lyrics: KorsbÃ¤ck]

When Iâm thinking of the life that we have lived,
I realize that times are gone.
When words were spoken out, but little was achieved.
But now a new life has begun.

Cause deep inside our hearts, a feeling is growing strong.
That we have so much left to show.

Weâve lived in Fantasy, in Illusions and in Dreams.
And weâve been fighting for this life.
Weâve seen the sunrise shine, and Hope is what we feel.
We have one chance to change our lives.

We burn the bridges down, and leave the past behind.
Cause new dimensions waits, and now it is our time!

Cause you donât know how far your eyes can see.
And that your life turns out to be just the way you see it.
So we try to change our destiny,
Knowing that we all could be facing times of glory.

Maybe youâre too blind to seeâ¦.

[Solo]

We burn the bridges down, and leave the past behind.
Cause new dimensions waits, and now it is our time!

Cause you donât know how far your eyes can see.
And that your life turns out to be just the way you see it.
So we try to change our destiny,
Knowing that we all could be facing times of glory.

(Thoughts: When we slowly started to realize that this could be a new start for us, we were so excited, and rehearsing was the best thing ever! This is maybe not a true story if you ask all the parts involved. But this is the story of one side. And remember: A story can be told in many dofferent ways. /Mikko)
