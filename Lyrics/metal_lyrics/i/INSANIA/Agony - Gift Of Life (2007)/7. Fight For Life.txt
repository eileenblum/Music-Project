[Music: Ãstros, Lyrics: Ãstros]

All your life youâve tried to smile.
But something warn you to die.

Thereâs just things hard to explain.
I will keep on asking why.

You can call it what you want.
Thereâs a reason I wont try.

Thereâs just things hard to explain.
I will keep on asking why.

It must be an evil pain.
But you keep on struggling.
Itâs hard for you to explain.
Youâve got to fight for life.

I once saw it every day.
But you had to walk away.

Thereâs just things hard to explain.
I will keep on asking why.

It must be an evil pain.
But you keep on struggling.
Itâs hard for you to explain.
Youâve got to fight for life.

[Solo]

Thereâs just things hard to explain.
I will keep on asking why.

It must be an evil pain.
But you keep on struggling.
Itâs hard for you to explain.
Youâve got to fight for life.
