[Music: KorsbÃ¤ck, Lyrics: KorsbÃ¤ck]

As I am thinking my destiny;
Never knowing what will be.

Facing the things that I have done,
It would be easier to run, but to face them makes me free.

So Iâm not proud but now Iâm strong,
And Iâve waited for so long.

Before I was blind but now I see,
That you cannot win a victory, if you donât fight and thatâs for sure.

Now Iâm moving on,I wonât cry no more.
Iâm leaving the bad things I have seen,
And walk into my dreams,
Now Iâm facing my own destiny.

Iâm not proud but now Iâm strong,
And Iâve waited for so long.

Before I was blind but now I see,
That you cannot win a victory, if i donât fight and now I will.

Now Iâm all alone, and Iâm moving on,
Iâm leaving the bad things I have seen.
And walk into my dreams,
Now Iâm facing my own destiny.

[Solo]

Now Iâm all alone, and Iâm moving on,
Iâm leaving the bad things I have seen.
And walk into my dreams,
Now Iâm facing my own destiny.

Now Iâm all alone, and Iâm moving on,
Iâm leaving the bad things I have seen.
And walk into my dreams,
Now Iâm facing my own destiny.

(Thoughts: This song is pretty much about taking the step to break free from something that doesnât make you happy anymore. Lotâs of issues appear, and you lose your strength somehow. The important thing is to stay strong, and thatâs why some of the lyrics appear twice in this song. /Mikko)
