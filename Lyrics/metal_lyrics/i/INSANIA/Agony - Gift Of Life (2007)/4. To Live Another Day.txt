[Music: KorsbÃ¤ck, Lyrics: KorsbÃ¤ck]

Is this what I had in mind, when I tried to see the sign?
The best days of my life just when away.
With tears in my eyes,years are passing by,
Iâm getting older every day.

So please help me see, the best things that life can give,
Cause I wanna be free.
I wanna live some more, thereâs so much to explore,
âHey Life!â, please let me feel.

Why am I scared to live tomorrow?
Why am I scared to leave today?
Will the future bring me joy or sorrow?
Is there time enough for me to pray, and live another day?

What if life could treat me well and cast away the spell,
That always has and still is haunting me.
I have to stand up strong, be brave and carry on,
Not to lose my pride and dignity.

What if i could change my life, add some light into the night,
Cause I wanna be free.
I wanna live some more, thereâs so much to explore,
âHey Life!â, please let me feel.

Why am I scared to live tomorrow?
Why am I scared to leave today?
Will the future bring me joy or sorrow?
Is there time enough for me to pray, and live another day?

[Solo]

Why am I scared to live tomorrow?
Why am I scared to leave today?
Will the future bring me joy or sorrow?
Is there time enough for me to pray, and live another day?

(Thoughts: This song is about the fact that we do get older every day. Suddenly you start to regret the bad things youâve done in the past and you realize that youâre just as fragile as everyone else. /Mikko)
