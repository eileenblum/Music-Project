[Music: Keiski, Lyrics: Keiski]

Since youâve been gone
Iâve seen your picture in my mind each and every day.
Why is it so that one must leave and one must stay?
It happens every day.

I keep on wondering why. Why is it so?
Someone please tell me because I just need to know.

All I can do is hope that I will see you again.
But âtill that day I know Iâll just have to wait.

When we were young
Life was a game and we just laughed,it seems like yesterday.
Sometimes I dream that you are here, but then again
When I wake up you disappear.

I keep on wondering why. Why is it so?
Someone please tell me because I just need to know.

All I can do is hope that I will see you again.
But âtill that day I know Iâll just have to wait.

[Solo]

There certain things
That I canât learn to undersand even if I try.
And âtil that day when we will meet again my friend.
I keep on asking my self why.

I keep on wondering why. Why is it so?
Someone please tell me because I just need to know.

All I can do is hope that I will see you again.
But âtill that day I know Iâll just have to wait.

All I can do is hope that I will see you again.
But âtill that day I know Iâll just have to wait.

(This song is about loosing a friend and the memories that are haunting you. I dedicate this song to my dear beloved cousin Leif Rikard Keiski. R.I.P)
