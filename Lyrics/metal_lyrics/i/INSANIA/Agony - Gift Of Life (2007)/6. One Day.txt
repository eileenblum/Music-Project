[Music: HalÃ©n, Lyrics: HalÃ©n]

What is love supposed to be?
Could it be a feeling inside of me?
Then why does it makes you sad?
All these emotions that we keep inside.
Tell meâ¦

Why canât we go on like we used to do.
Leave all the troubles behind.
Devastating thatâs a shame, when Iâm the one to blame.

Oneday I will find you
Oneday I will find my love
Summer turning into autumn, makes me realize
Even darker skies, they are approaching

What is love supposed to be?
A feeling inside that makes you free
Then why does it makes me lie?
Shouldnât have to be so hard
Like grasping for the stars.

Why canât we go on like we used to do.
Leave all the troubles behind.
Devastating thatâs a shame, when Iâm the one to blame.

Oneday I will find you
Oneday I will find my love
Summer turning into autumn, makes me realize
Even darker skies, they are approaching

Will I make it through the day?
Without you by my side.
Is there a chance, thatâs weâll meet again?
Oneday,we will meet my friend.

(Thoughts: This song was written when I still believed in loveâ¦)
