[Music: HalÃ©n, Lyrics: HalÃ©n]

Ainât it funny, the way life goes?
Ainât it funny,how life carries on?
Have we noticed,how time passes by?
Watching the light. Fade away.

Ainât it funny, the way life goes?
Ainât it funny, how our dreams carry on?
They try to tell me, you take my breath away, away.

Weâve been together for some time.
Maybe the best days of my life.
I was lonely,before I met you.
And you keep helping me trough the hard times.

Time passes by.
Time passes by.

If you see the clouds on my sky.
I know that you will wash away.
And keep on pushing me through the sunrise.
Always aware that I can count on you.
If you would take me back.
Then I maybe would stop to cry.
Iâm in need of someone like you.
To keep my faith and hold me tight.
You know Iâm growing stronger.
When Iâm down and you pick me up.
Why canât I see youâre the one for me.

(Thoughts: â¦You are not the one for meâ¦)
