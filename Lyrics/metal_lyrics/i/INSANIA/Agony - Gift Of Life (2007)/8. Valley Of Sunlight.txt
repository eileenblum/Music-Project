[Music: KorsbÃ¤ck / Ãstros / Keiski, Lyrics: KorsbÃ¤ck]

So we are searching for a valley far away.
But we have no direction.
But when we get there we will meditate and pray.
For mankind's own perfection.

Things have gone so wrong, yet we must carry on.
We must walk for days and nights, to find another home.

To the valley of sunlight we will arrive,
And we will lead a better life.
No pollutions, anguish and cries,
Just mother nature, mankind and the light.

We lose our spirits, many moons have passed us by.
And we have no protection.
Surrounding darkness, we canât wait to see the light.
We lose our minds from pressure.

Still we share this dream, to live in dignity.
We believe that we can achieve, to find another home

To the valley of sunlight we will arrive,
And we will lead a better life.
No pollutions, anguish and cries,
Just mother nature, mankind and the light.

[Solo]

To the valley of sunlight we will arrive,
And we will lead a better life.
No pollutions, anguish and cries,
Just mother nature, mankind and the light.

To the valley of sunlight we will arrive,
And we will live a glorious life.
No more shadows, darkness or fright,
Just mother nature, mankind and the light.

(Thoughts: When peace finally reaced Paradisia, mankind was defeated and outnumbered. Man had no place to live, sine earth was no more. Mandkind was now the pray and their search for a new home, for a new Mother Nature begins. This is their story.)
