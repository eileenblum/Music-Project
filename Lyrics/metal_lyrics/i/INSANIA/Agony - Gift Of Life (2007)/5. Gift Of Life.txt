[Music: KorsbÃ¤ck, Lyrics: KorsbÃ¤ck]

In the end of life Iâll be falling, thatâs what I have been told.
When ancient voices are calling, itâs time to go.
Only god knows where I am going, cause I have not been foretold.
All the good and bad will be showing. Then I will know.

[Keiski:]
But I cannot fall from down below
Canât escape from my own hell.
And I donât know when Iâll have to go
The end of life depends on what I am.

I just have to change my life and find away,
To see the light beyond tragedies, and take what life is giving me.
I know that Iâll find my way to paradise.
Now I see with open eyes, and reach out for the gift of life.

My life is passing before me,but all the bad things are gone.
Maybe all my prayers erased them? Cause there are none.
When the end of my life approaches, how come I am not scared?
Cause I will meet all my loved ones.theyâll all be there.

[Keiski:]
I believe that we will meet again,
Where itâs bright and always day.
An inner voice just keeps on telling me,
The end of life depends on what youâve been.

I just have to change my life and find away,
To see the light beyond tragedies, and take what life is giving me.
I know that Iâll find my way to paradise.
Now I see with open eyes, and reach out for the gift of life.

[Solo]

I just have to change my life and find away,
To see the light beyond tragedies, and take what life is giving me.
I know that Iâll find my way to paradise.
Now I see with open eyes, and reach out for the gift of life.

I just have to change my life and find away,
To see the light beyond tragedies, and take what life is giving me.
Iâll find my way to paradise, and reach out for the gift of life.

[Keiski:]
Well I donât know why Iâm still crying.
Cause I have seen the day,but the light wonât dry my tears away.
And deep inside I just keep on dying.
Could someone show the way, to give me strength to live and pray.

(Thoughts: These are the feeling that came to me when I lost my mom. Dimitri sings the thoughts that kept spinning around in my head, and Ola the words that I spoke out loud. The angels choir is the thing I wanna hear when itâs time for me to resignâ¦But âtil then: -Rock on!!! /Mikko)
