[Music: Stolt, Lyrics: Stolt]

I have been searching for the answers many times.,
In time we will learn the secrets of life.
The rules that are written will they show wrong from right?
The good from the bad, the rich from the poor?

Thoughts keep running through my head.
The feeling of solitude in this everlasting game,
But in the end we will see,
The gates of heaven may be our final destiny.

In my dreams I travel to a place far beyond reality
I let my mind fly free
This sets me free for all eternity, you canât imprison me.
My dreams are waiting for me.

When tome has run out and they carve your name in stone,
Our maker will judge us for our deeds in the past.
Relieved we may enter the realms of afterlife,
But donâr ever forget the way could go down.

In fire, our souls would cry out,
Forgiveness of sins committed in life.
A place in heaven is denied,
An ages the darkness will consume our lies.

In my dreams I travel to a place far beyond reality
I let my mind fly free
This sets me free for all eternity, you canât imprison me.
My dreams are waiting for me.

[Solo]

In my dreams I travel to a place far beyond reality
I let my mind fly free
This sets me free for all eternity, you canât imprison me.
My dreams are waiting for me.

In my dreams I travel to a place far beyond reality
I let my mind fly free
This sets me free for all eternity, you canât imprison me.
My dreams are waiting for me.

My dreams are waiting for me.
My dreams are waiting for me.

(This song is about all the demands that you encounter during life and the wandering about where you go after life has ended. Laws, rules and social stress keeps you in chains and the only place where you truly can be free is in your dreams)
