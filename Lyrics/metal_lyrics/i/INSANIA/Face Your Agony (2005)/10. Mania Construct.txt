behind your bedroom window a phantom's sittin' 
(and) it's playin' with your pillow 'til it rips 
(then) it paints the windows with the blood of your cat 
and then stucks some more feathers unto it

i'm not in hurry, i am not like you 
i'm waitin' as long as you're coming back 
you shoudn't tell me something, ask me something, hurt me 
i just won't let you get away from here

not in anger with you, not embittered nor sad 
only the thing i love you 
not in anger with you, not embittered nor sad 
can't get you out of my head

cause i have the right (to) clean and wash my mind 
warriors, victims - they spend me one wrong smile 
cause i have the right (to) free me up inside 
to watch on the dew

try once to live without having fear 
of firery flood and a hand full of scars 
try once to jump without knowing too much 
no leaves, no sea, no pillow for the clouds

down in the net of a mania construct 
it is really out of your skin 
down in the net of a mania construct 
that only the sun is stealing

cause i have the right (to) wash myself clean 
warriors, victims - they spend me one wrong smile 
cause i have the right (to) make myself free 
to watch on the dew - naked on the grass
