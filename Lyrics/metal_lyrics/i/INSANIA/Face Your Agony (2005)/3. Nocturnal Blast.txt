running from this nightmare 
no way to waste your time 
take care of what you pray for 
we're stalking 'round the night

it's just that same ol' highway 
tomorrow takes us to 
another place to fight for 
our vision of the truth

nocturnal blast, my friend 
we've come for you

p.a.s.c. comes to your town tonight 
run and hide 
p.a.s.c. comes to your town tonight 
run and hide

so let us give 'em hell 
we bath ourselves in cries 
and when your life is useless 
it's better when you fu**in' die

as your time slips away 
not much left to repent 
obey to the unholy 
psycho-active-storm-command

nocturnal blast, my friend 
we've come for you

p.a.s.c. comes to your town tonight 
run and hide 
p.a.s.c. comes to your town tonight 
run and hide
