slowly quite slowly struggles 
a word of thirst out of his mouth 
slowly quite slowly opens 
itself a backyard's door 
out on the masonry 
serving machines lie in wait 
and a dead plumptree rips off 
the passing by dog's tail

slowly quite slowly it dawns 
a boy is swallowing 
slowly quite slowly the bones of 
the right little finger of his father down 
the door in backyard closes no more 
the masonry was just a set 
the nightwatcher movie a wild slaughter of 
ancient sewing art in known lands

the nightwatcher isn't interested in that no more 
while the interested do not watch the night go on

and the tree - as you will see 
it is now lord of the machines 
and they are - away too far 
they're sewing a black stole for it 
slowly - you always watch the winter passing by 
slowly, slowly - the winter's passing by

the dogs they are no more 
have eaten too much plum 
the boy is also nearly full 
his father - the nightwatcher - 
he isn't interested in 
he's rather not thirsty 
with the nails of sewing machines 
in his mouth no dogs will bite him
