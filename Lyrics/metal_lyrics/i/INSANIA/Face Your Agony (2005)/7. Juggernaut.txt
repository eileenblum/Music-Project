down in the ground, agony around 
this is where you seed ya crop where poverty's around 
ain't got no doubt 
what it's all about 
selling us your bloody god who gets a madman out

your religion made you so fanatically blind 
blow up your insaniacally fanatic mind

blood's what you spill, unbeliever's killed 
you pretend a holy cause to justify your will 
smell (of) death around 
cemetary sound 
i'll piss upon your juggernaut who gets the evil out

your religion made you so fanatically blind 
blow up your insaniacally fanatic mind

war to sell - piece of hell 
don't believe a word you tell 
all the names are all the same 
Allah, Buddha, God or what you say
