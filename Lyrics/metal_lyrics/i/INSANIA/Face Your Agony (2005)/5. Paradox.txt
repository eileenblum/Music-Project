believe me i have sailed upon the seven seas 
i've climbed the mountains all around our mother earth 
i've made my way to infinity and back again

(but) no more believing 
we have to face our twisted minds 
(our) wounds keep on bleeding

when the blind looks in his eyes 
and the deaf will hear the cries 
when the dead one is alive 
it's the paradox in mind 
when the blind looks in his eyes 
will we ever realize?

and even if i've got the feeling to be right 
i find myself just one more time on the other side 
so i got to start it all again but i don't mind

(but) no way of healing 
we only tell our twisted lies 
(our) wounds keep on bleeding

when the blind looks in his eyes 
and the deaf will hear the cries 
when the dead one is alive 
it's the paradox in mind 
when the blind looks in his eyes 
will we ever realize?

when the blind looks in his eyes 
and the deaf will hear the cries 
when the dead one is alive 
it's the paradox in mind

when the wilderness is tamed 
and the warrior plays a game 
when the truth is telling lies 
it's the paradox of life
