game is up, we are not worth 
(we) gambled away our chance 
got to go, make way and leave 
preparing for the end

take a ride on wheels of time 
only decades behind 
we were fighting side by side 
for betterings to find

(we) only take the center stage 
by kicking everybody's face

burning in fire - fire 
our common ground 
lies for the liar - liar 
a fading sound 
burning in fire - fire 
our common ground 
no more desire - desire 
we're fading out

(the) wheel goes on and days arrived 
we could enjoy what we got 
(but) time had come to draw a line 
we can thank us a lot

searching for the difference now 
turning us all into buts 
the common dreams we had ago 
we love to drag in the mud
