just sittin' in silence and watchin' the red rain 
time counts for no-one, no matter if someone disappears 
you told me together we could face the enemy 
but now that you're gone I can hardly say that I miss those days

no way I can feel my own pain 
forever an agony game

when I faced you in this night 
and I stared into those eyes 
I remember of the calm before the storm

we fought side by side against any sort of plague 
even there was struggle between us we've let it flown away 
I don't know the reason why I started to hate 
and finally killed all that has tortured my psychotic brain

no way I can feel my own pain 
forever an agony game

when I faced you in this night 
and I stared into those eyes 
I remember of the calm before the storm

when I faced you in this night 
and I stared into those eyes 
I remember of the calm before the storm
