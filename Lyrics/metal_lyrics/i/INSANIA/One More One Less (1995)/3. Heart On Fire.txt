Heart on fire - she could be anyone
I'd like to tell a tale of little Any None
She felt like you and me
One title-page of those blinding eyes
And she got lost

No fear - the smiling face appears in her dreams
So near - the photographs still shine on

It was unreal
She bevlieved to see the chosen one
She won't see - cheating faces made her blind
Heart on fire

She couldn't stand to share,
she always claimed her right to own her idol's life
Her dream came true with a gun in her hand
For a tick of time

It was unreal
She bevlieved to see the chosen one
She won't see - cheating faces made her blind
Heart on fire

Heart on fire - her name was Any None
It hit her hard to see and realize
She'd never get in touch
Maybe one day beyond now

It was unreal
She bevlieved to see the chosen one
She won't see - cheating faces made her blind
Heart on fire
