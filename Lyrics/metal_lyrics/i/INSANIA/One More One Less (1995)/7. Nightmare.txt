Lightning strikes the night, a thunder is rising
from the sky above - you feel the sweat drop down
you can't sleep, it's like every night

It's a nightmare - your nightmare tonight
It's a nightmare
It's a nightmare - your nightmare tonight
It's your nightmare - the nightmare you can't fight

Every night is the same, you count the bell tolls
till it's 12 midnight - shadows on the wall
showing you the man with the mask

It's a nightmare - your nightmare tonight
It's a nightmare
It's a nightmare - your nightmare tonight
It's your nightmare - the nightmare you can't fight

Liar, liar, thats what they say what you are
no one behind in the story you told
no one believed that you're not guilty
the years they pass by, you're awaiting the end
someday you know they'll come to take you
oh god please help I'm to young for your heaven
oh god please help me now

You don't know when your time has come
sit and wait for the end
still a key opens up your door
and the priest is your only friend
