Fool for the nightlife
and the glory of a winner's fame
card on the table
take your place and play your game

Down and out - keep on rollin' the dice
call yourself a gambler
think you never lose a game
Down and out - you believe in your eyes
you are just a toy in a silly game

You need the nightlife
only destiny will show the way
shade and illusion
make you blind to play that game

Down and out - keep on rollin' the dice
call yourself a gambler
think you never lose a game
Down and out - you believe in your eyes
you are just a toy in a silly game

Down and out - you're deceiving the dice
still you are a gambler
in your dreams you win the game
Down and out - if you don't realize
no one will remember, none will know your name
