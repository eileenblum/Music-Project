Dead man's daily routine
pushing my back to the wall
bones to dust in the machine
(the) boss man's ritual

But how the tables turn now
eye kept on the dawn
forget about my troubles
and I get it on

Neon - beggars - they dance
while I just burn down the town
take the glass and take my chance
then just drink it down

But how the tables turn now
eye kept on the dawn
forget about my troubles
and I get it on

Twelve bottles - I keep it tight
Twelve bottles - I do it right
