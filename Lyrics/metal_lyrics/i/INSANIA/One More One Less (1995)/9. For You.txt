Lost in the glare of the fame
I stand every night
on stage and I'm searchin' for myself
I'd lose control - and you, too
I'm sorry - now and forever
I'll take it if you want to go

But deep inside, I'm lookin' for a home
a place for you and me,
where we're together all the time

For you - I'll keep on fightin' and dyin', baby hear me
With you - I wana be 'till the end
For you - I wanna sing the song, come and take my hand
Hey babe - I'm comin' home tonight

When I'm coming home, it's just some old hotel
in an unknown town
my heart is so empty, my mind's blow away
Another day - changing feelings
my desire for your love and affection
turned and repressed but only for a little while

But deep inside, I'm lookin' for a home
a place for you and me,
where we're together all the time

For you - I'll keep on fightin' and dyin', baby hear me
With you - I wana be 'till the end
For you - I wanna sing the song, come and take my hand
Hey babe - I'm comin' home tonight

This way of life I had to choose for a long time
but I'm comin' home tonight.
This way of life I had to choose for a long time
performance of glory, standing in the glaring
spotlight of a dream that does not exist

And then I feel great void in my body when
they're cutting the lights of the ball. 'Closing time'
they shout, the curtain will fall down on my heart
For you I'll keep on fightin' and dyin' Baby hear me
For you I wanna sing the song

For you - I fight
With you - I die
For you - I sing the song
and I'm coming home

Good times I had
and the point where I'm standing alone
has passed long ago
and it makes me happy to say
"I love you"

You and I we stand side by side
you'd catch me if I'd fall down
the dream is over, my heart beat frenziedly
and I'm happy when I'm comin' home
