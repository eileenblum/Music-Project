The wheel of time we can't turn back 
One day we meet, one day we forget 
Don't mind the absence of faceless hearts 
There ain't no power to tear friends apart

Friends stand hand (in) hand 
The answer, my friend!

Afraid to be deceived again 
(We) got to believe in the faith of friends 
It's hard to find a friend to trust 
But easier than leaving a friend we lost

Friends stand hand (in) hand 
The answer, my friend!

One more, one less - No need to cry 
(At) the end of the road - A new path's in sight 
One more, one less - No need to cry 
If hope's gonna live - In terms like "good-bye"

Voice: We have to rely on the meaning of friends 
Don't believe in those who pretend 
Ev'ry single friend is a priceless gift 
And better than dozens of liars - no matter if ...

... One more ... one less!
