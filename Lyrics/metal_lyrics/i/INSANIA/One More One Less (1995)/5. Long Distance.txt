Well it takes it's toll this reality
it knocks you down and you get up to fall again
you don't know how, I don't know why
the circle has made it's turn
than you end, where you begin

You're ill, confused
you've lost to feel for all that's real
you're ill, confused
you've lost to feel

There is no time, the words have run dry
but hey, so don't fight against me, but with me
I will help you

You're ill, confused
you've lost to feel for all that's real
you're ill, confused
you've lost to feel

Afraid to be alone, alone in the dark
without some-ones guiding hand
afraid to go out on the street
(and) live on the edge - to risk your life
