Lonely children they cry, out of the dark
but why don't we hear
The world we leave 'em behind is droning in blood
that's spilled in a war

And we get used of terror in here
we only close our eyes

All our stories and lies
of fairess and love, I'm tired to hear
words and numbers we write in letters of blood
that shine on the wall

This world is full of horror and fear
why do we close our eyes

White against yellow, red against black
left against right, all fight
Hunger, war and death are daily news
people suffer in neverending cries

All you children stop cryin', get out of the dark
Nevermore would you run and loose again
your apin will fade away, get out of the dark
Don't look behind you, ain't gonna stop you
a new generation is born

Children stop cry - out of the dark
pain fade away - out of the dark
don't look behind you
