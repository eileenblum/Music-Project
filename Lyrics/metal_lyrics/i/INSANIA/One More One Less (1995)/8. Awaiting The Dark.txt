Sometimes I remember those days of joy
and I wish I had the power to turn back the time

Awaiting, awaiting the dark
Awaiting, awaiting the dark

Sometimes I had dreamt of these days of pain
now I'm here I was sentenced to pay with my life

Awaiting, awaiting the dark
Awaiting, awaiting the dark

[Judge:]
Here in court, we made up our minds
in the name of justice and law
the judgement is passed by the truth
think of it and take the time, to repent
now it's time to die, time to die, time to die ...

[Accused:]
I'm here in the darkness
the light of life I can see
a senseless decision
hope you enjoy my dying

Awaiting, awaiting the dark
Awaiting, awaiting the dark
