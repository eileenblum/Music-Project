Dark was the night, in the candle light
I was in front of my PC by the fireside
During my secret cyberalchemystic ritual,
Which was virtual, intellectual.

Since the time I committed the crime
When on my web-site I put one esoteric rhyme
I've been receiving satanic spam emails each night
Each one reaching size of one gigabyte.

I admit it's a sin, but I was listening
To the secret talks between Christ and the devil's twin
About founding political party that was to win
And publishing their own magazine.

It's never too late to start to defy fate
In this dogma-idolizing psycho-apartheid
To fall in hate with new dogma preachers feels great
This life deserves no love, it deserves hate.

It's easy to fall in hate, it's easy to fall in hate
Much easier than to fall in love, it's easy to fall in hate

In the fire glow time is running slow
Deep in our blasphemous missionaries' ghetto
Inside me there sleeps my brother Cain's ego
Like an embryo in utero.

It's never too late to start to defy fate
In this dogma-idolizing psycho-apartheid
To fall in hate with new dogma preachers feels great
This life deserves no love, it deserves hate.

It's easy to fall in hate, it's easy to fall in hate
Much easier than to fall in love, it's easy to fall in hate

In this world of dogma preachers,
Who like to discriminate
Things that don't fit their straight thinking,
Who try to intimidate,
In this world of dogma icons
Life deserves no love, just hate.
