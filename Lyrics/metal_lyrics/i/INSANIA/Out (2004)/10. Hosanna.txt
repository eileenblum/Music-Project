Angel of night, protect us, hosanna
Angel of night, my guardian angel
Protect my little soul.

We were born on an evil star, hosanna
Angel of night, my guardian angel
Stay by me faithfully in my sleep.

Life is a tax on death, hosanna
Angel of night, my guardian angel
Plead for my little soul.
