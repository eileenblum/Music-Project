Ave Joe, Joe is the torch-bearer of our astral revolution
Ave Joe, our revolt of the Cursed feels moral superiority
Our blood is cursed, we are cast out of the world
And before a new day comes our cursed blood 
Will turn the ground below the stage red.

Ave Joe, stars told him not to play with fire
When he founded the revolutionary committee at Walpurgis Night.

Ave Joe, tabloids have ordered your murder
Ave Joe, our cruiser sails on under your flag.
