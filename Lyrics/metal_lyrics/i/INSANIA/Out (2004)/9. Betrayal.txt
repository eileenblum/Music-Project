My blood brought her to life
In my blood she washed her hands
Then from my blood she drank
And through black night, black forest
With a knife in her hand she betrayed me.
Thereâs a long way ahead of us
My brother, tonight youâd better sleepâ¦ alone.

And blood and dark and fear and betrayal
And blood is time and evil is in us
And evil is world and murder is pus
And betrayal of a sister is snakeâs venom
And night and day is like a bad dream
Your mind living inferno
And night and day is like a bad dream
And betrayal is their tune: â¦

My hair she was stroking
When blood rushed out of my wound
Then joined us with her kiss
And in her lap my blood forever
Has been mixed with her tears.
Thereâs a long way ahead of us
My brother, tonight youâd better sleepâ¦ alone.
