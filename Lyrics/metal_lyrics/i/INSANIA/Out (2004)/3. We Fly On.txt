We fly on, higher, higher above the earthâs gravity
We leave the hell on earth, heave anchors and fly on.
We fly on, higher, closer to other lives
We fly on, through dark, and sky is a big black hole
We fly on...

We fly on, higher, we fly to look for another hide-out
We fly on, higher, we fly to choose a new Earth
We fly on, through dark, escaping through the red sky
We fly on...

Our vanguard are headed for stars, they rush
Race like a stellar hurricane, far out
Our aim is a new underground, above us
We are the astral underground.

We fly on, fly on, it is our astral ritual
We fly on, to meet stars, dash through a hive of shooting stars
We fly on, to a new star, thatâs whatâs worth sinning for
We fly on...
