He had a disposition of a suicide, his course was a different world
He set out into icy waters on a journey out
And when the body came out, it saw us
And when the body understood, it heard this:
Y.R.U.L.IâVE?

He had a disposition of a suicide, his course was a different world
At full moon at an agreed hint he drank the poison
And when the soul had flown away, it had seen us
And when the soul understood, it heard this:
Y.R.U.L.IâVE?

Like a white crow fly more far and higher, where the flock of the black ones does not fly
Like a black sheep run to the distances, where the herd of the white ones does not run
Search for dreams in the forbidden books, in which nobody else searches
Think how you answer when I ask you Y.R.U.L.IâVE?

He had a disposition of a suicide and an unfulfilled dream
To take a header out of a thirteenth floorâs window
And being drawn by the earthâs gravity away from stars he saw us
And before he finished his journey of gravitation, he heard this:
Y.R.U.L.IâVE?
