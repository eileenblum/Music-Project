The world is a big game of chance, a cosmic roulette
And each of us is a gambler with a passing luck
... the roulette is spinning ... your Will be done.

The world is an absurd comedy, a cynical practical joke
And each of us has his/her role and plays it
... it is a wretched farce... your Will be done.

Our world seems to be on a different star
Fly to a different star, where your will is the law.
Your Will be done.

The world is an eternal chorale, each of us shouts it
And each of us has just one voice to entertain masses
... each of us just one voice... to entertain masses.
