Letâs say aggressive prayers together in dark
We will tell obscene stories from our childhood to each other
I will swap the roles with you secretly and we will not tell people about that.

Satan and God for fun
Made up a conspiracy
That they would swap their roles secretly.

We will drink to celebrate Death, that sexual goddess
With snake-enchanters we will smoke opium till the evening bell

Satan and God out of boredom
Agreed cunningly
That they would swap their roles secretly.

Which one is the most monstrous of the Seven Wonders of the Underworld?
And guess who of us is responsible for the Immaculate Conception?
