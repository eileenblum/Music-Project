You and me are saints shooting a porno in the sky
starring St Valentine
Our fellowship writes a sci-fi poem Adonai, 
death is our deadline
Christ on a belfry's wall sprays upgraded mystic signs, 
falls down and dies
Through the sea of stars we are sending jolly lies 
Our Black Moon still shines
Only you must decide what is true, what is lie
We are free guerillas of your soul, Moon still shines
Higher, our church is chaosmagick of black holes
Higher, our priest is stellar Judas of your soul
Higher, our Black Moon still shines

Lord got the title role in an occult soap opera, 
since that time he's been a star
Our yellow press brought news of Satan's parricide, 
readers are satisfied
Venus the Concubine sings an aggressive lullaby, 
death-wish be her guide
Through the sea of stars we are sending jolly lies 
Our Black Moon still shines
Only you must decide what is true, what is lie
We are free guerillas of your soul, Moon still shines
Higher, our church is chaosmagick of black holes
Higher, our priest is stellar Judas of your soul
Higher, our Black Moon still shines
