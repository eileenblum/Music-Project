We stand on the stage of the underworld
We refused the dictate of whatâs IN and OUT
For the morality of herd this means a curse
We donât wanna be IN, we wanna be OUT.

The underworld is a medium, which preaches whatâs in us
That the roaring herd of celebrities is the symbol of this time

We provoke sheep like a relic of evil
They shout: âThe herdâs Will be done.â

We wanna be OUT, in the underworld, we wanna stay OUT
When an ass preaches âThe herd means safety,â the more we wanna be OUT.

We stand on the stage of the underworld
We have refused the stage of the world
Because it is packed with the herd of celebrities today
We donât wanna be IN, we wanna be OUT.
