We're lost sons who with rolling of drums
Come back from their holy crusades
We're black sheep and our pathway is steep
It's our fate to stay renegades
Light your fire, it's our only desire
And let its light rise up higher
Shoot your god, replace him on your tod
With your own bright shining fire

Shoot your god each day
That's the holy game we play
Take his place with no delay
Shoot your god, take his place 
With no delay each day.

For light we thirst and our music is cursed
By our own breed that for dark prays
Stars are right we must fight for the light
God likes to write hateful screenplays
We fight for light, it's our eternal right,
"Traitors must die" is our desire
Shoot your god, replace him on your tod
With your own bright shining fire

Shoot your god each day
That's the holy game we play
Take his place with no delay
Shoot your god, take his place 
With no delay each day.

Shoot your god each day for desertion
This way leads to your liberation
Then celebrate his execution
Shoot your god each day for desertion
