As you must know now, itâs an ill wind that blows nobody any evil
Thereâs a new rock club here, but evil is that itâs us who play in it
Our friend Devil opened a new club
But he ignored good friendly advice
And unfortunately of all the bands 
it was us, who he booked for the opening.

I warned Devil myself in advance,
When he phoned me because of the gig,
Not to provoke God deliberately,
But it was us who he wanted for the party.

God finds our music too mad, too loud 
Too scandalous, too frenzied, unfit for any event.

As you must know now, itâs an ill wind that blows nobody any evil
A new club could have been here, but Devil wanted us for the gig
Under the pretext of violating peace of the night
Devil had to clear out the club completely
And after he had opened it with so much pomp
He had to close it because of us.

As you must know now, the gig turned out to be a failure,
Thereâs one club less here now and we are on the black list

God finds our music too perverted, too gloomy 
Too obscene, too vulgar, absolutely unacceptable.
