Join in for the Holy Communion
Eat Jesus Christ and drink his blood

Pray for your sins as sinners you are
Purgatory awaits the damned
Save your souls with the blood of Christ
Save us all from your sins

Forgive me father for I have sin

Pray for your sins as sinners you are
Purgatory awaits the damned

He despise you all in silence
He listens to your prayers of lies
He laughs and mocks you all
As he poisons you with the holy word

Poison the holy with the blood of Christ
Poison the holy and make them die

Take this body of Christ inside you
Your lives are build on a lie

Drink the blood of your savior
Eat the flesh of your lord
Poison the holy with the blood of Christ
Poison the holy and make them die

Poison, poison the holy
Poison, poison the holy
