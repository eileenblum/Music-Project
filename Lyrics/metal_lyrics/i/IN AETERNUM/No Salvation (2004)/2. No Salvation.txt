Nailed to the cross you held so high
As a heretic among thieves condemned of heresy

High above us all
Looking with tired eyes
Searching for mercy you cannot find
That of praying to the one above

Blood pouring down your face
As the crown rips your flesh apart

No salvation for the son of god
No salvation for anyone
No salvation
No salvation

Judas sealed your fate
Your sanctity gave you death
Forever will you be the one above
Nailed to the cross of your blind: faith

No gratitude..
No nothing no more..
No savior at all

No salvation only death
No salvation only death for the son of god
