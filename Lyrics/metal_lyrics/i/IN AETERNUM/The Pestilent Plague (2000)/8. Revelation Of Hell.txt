A bestial rite of darkness
A virgin sacrifice
Brings the antichrist to the world
With chaos death and destruction, I summon

From my sacrifice the blood will flow
This is the beginning the preparation
Streams of evil crush the world
It's the fall of the human race

Thunderstorms will follow you
Firestorms will burn the kind
Come forth and make them bleed
Revelation of hell

To the north, to the south
To the west, to the east
I summon thee unholy one
Rise from the abyss and be

Thunderstorms will follow you
Firestorms will burn the kind
Come forth and make them bleed
Revelation of hell
