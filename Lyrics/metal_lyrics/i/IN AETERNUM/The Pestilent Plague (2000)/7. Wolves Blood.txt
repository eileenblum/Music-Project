I curse you all to die
A revelation of purest fire born
As the world burns
Aggression opens forth

Rising from the abyss to conquer
I am the infernal inferno in your dreams
I am the darkness you see
I will set you free

Baptized in wolves blood
Raised by the demons I was

Superior elite to conquer

On the shoulders of fools I'm carried
I am the shepherd and you're the flock

Unbound from duties spree
Embraced by darkness you'll breed
Triumph of the will
I will set you free

Rising from the abyss to conquer
I am the infernal inferno in your dreams
I am the darkness you see
I will set you free

Baptized in wolves blood
Raised by the demons I was

A predator of now
Makes the fall of man
Vengeance be my weapon
And I will set them free
