Armed forces of hell gather for attack
On wings of steel we fly
Fire power supreme

Search attack destroy
No mercy no compassion
Total Armageddon

No survivors no life
Sepulchral silence will come

Eternal devastation
Demonic lust for blood chaos and destruction
Unholy sinners of the dead of night

Explosions fire and dust
Blood of the holy will flow
Sacrificed sodomized and brutalized
In the name of our lord we will kill
Fire power supreme

Slaughter in the name of our lord
Cleansing the world from Christ
You are condemned to die
Devastation to the holy
