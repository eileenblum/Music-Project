On a steed he comes
In his tracks fire spreads
No remorse in his hollow eyes
No pity in the heart of stone

Spreading like a raging fire
Pestilence to them all
A scourge upon humanity
Pestilence to them all

Death sickness and pain
A gift from hell's domain
Silent and fearful
The death bringing plague
Burning fever blisters and pain

Open eyes of the dead
The pestilent plague

The pestilent plague

Useless prayers to the sky
As pyres lit the night!
No laughter no cries
Damnations hell strikes

Burn the Christians, burn them all
The plague must be banned from this land
With the powers of darkness we burn the sick of man
The flames shall devour your sickening soul

The pestilent plague

Open eyes of the dead
The pestilent plague

Spreading like a raging fire
The hate of man
A scourge upon humanity
The Christian plague
