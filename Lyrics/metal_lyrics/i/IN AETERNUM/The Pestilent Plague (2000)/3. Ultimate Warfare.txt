Death or dishonor loyalty to death
Ultimate warfare and we will win

Beasts of steel attack
Blood and thunder
You will die at dawn
Begot your name on your bullets

Crushing tearing in the name of hell
A carnal lust for blood

War bombs and destruction
Hear the rattle of the chains
Beasts of steel attack
Fire inferno begin

Warfare
War

Execution of god's children
Nailing the holy one to the wall
Tormenting the human mind
As steel crush your hope

Ultimate warfare
Ultimate warfare

War bringing antichrists
Descends upon you

We are the tormentors of Satan
And we will win
Victory be ours and they'll forever be dead

Beasts of steel attack
Ultimate warfare
You will die at dawn
Ultimate warfare
