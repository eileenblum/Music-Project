Electrified
Terrified
Tortured with hate
You are nothing in a senseless world
Exterminated from the human kind

Die for your god
Salvation is death
Torture chamber

Sadism - sadistic perversion
Pain - cruelty ahead

Terror takes control and blackens your eyes
Darkness descends for your life

Violent torture

Barbaric masterminds of evil
Carnivores from hell descends upon you
In the chamber of maliciousness
We ripped you of your life

Die for your god
Salvation is death
Torture chamber

Extermination of the weak
Desecration of the pure

Rape the slaves of salvation
Torture the forgiving ones

Violent torture

Be my victim of death, my trophy of your failure
Be dead forever, breed no more scum
