The apocalypse is coming with chaos death and destruction

A distant thunder cracks the silence
Terrified faces of the human race
Frightened for the coming of the dark
Hiding trembling praying to be spared

Riding the winds of torture
From the abyss of hell
The apocalypse division came

A final war to end their lives
A night of unholy souls

Eternal devastation
Iron blood and blasphemy
The knights of hell you can never escape
A triumphant victory of the dark

The apocalypse division

We drink from the skulls of our enemies
We drink their blood and semen
The year of the apocalypse
An ending in devastation and pain

The coming of antichrist and the apocalypse division
We have triumphed over Christ with terror
Everything destroyed and burnt to ashes
The flames took thy life

The blood of sacred soul's forever lost
Open the gate for the apocalypse
Be ready to face the truth of death
And of evil
