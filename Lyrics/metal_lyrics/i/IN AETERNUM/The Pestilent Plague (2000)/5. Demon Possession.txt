Tangled in the lust of darkness
My mind is possessed by evil

Look into my eyes and see the fire burn
I am the son of Satan who ravaged thy soul's
I am the God of gods and destroyer of light
I possess thy feeble souls and murder your god

Blessed be thy soul's with demon possession
Praise the unholy force of evil

Tangled in the lust of darkness
I possessed your minds with wrath of evil

Demon possession

As the night conquers the day
The legions of Satan prevail over the light!
Blood dripping claws of evil tearing your soul's apart
Tool's of Master Satan that's what you were

Tangled in the lust of darkness
I murdered your god

The sacred blood of god is buried and forgotten
The Nazarene of heaven raped and crucified
By the legions of Satan
Our work is done

Demon possession
