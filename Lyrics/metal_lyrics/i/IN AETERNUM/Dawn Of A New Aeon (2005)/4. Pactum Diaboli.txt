I swear the oath to the blackest of the black
I drink the blood of the poisoned whore

Praise the one
Praise the lord
Praise hail Satan
Pactum Diaboli

A call for the dark to rise and grant me his blessing
Come forth and let the flames arise
In league with the damned
Possessed by the dark of humanity
Lit the way for salvation

I am part of you, I am Satanâs child
I am one with the dark

Communion of evil communion of sin
My will, will be your will
Be part of me and the never ending
Black chaos transpired

Feed of the sorrow and despair
Come with me

Praise the one
Praise the lord
Praise hail Satan
Pactum Diaboli

Pactum Diaboli
