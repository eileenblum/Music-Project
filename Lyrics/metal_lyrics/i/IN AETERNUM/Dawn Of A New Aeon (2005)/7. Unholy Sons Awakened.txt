Now behold the raging coming
For centuries below the light
The strength of a thousand entities
Summoned by the words of hatred

Unleashed blackened abominations
The vengeance of the Gods
The earth shivers in tremendous wrath
As carnality power collide

Unholy sons awakened
Furious wrath of the ancient ones
Consume... destroy
In blasphemy I summon you

Listen to the tortured screams
As blood rains from the sky
Blasting storms of annihilation
Genocide of mankind

Destroy the ancient empire
Conquerors from below the lights
Infamous force of the blackest abyss
Embrace the world with pestilent ironstorms

Unholy sons awakened
Furious wrath of the ancient gods
Consume... destroy
In blasphemy I summon you
