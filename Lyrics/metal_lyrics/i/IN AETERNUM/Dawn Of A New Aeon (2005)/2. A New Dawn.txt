Open wide before me
The gates to everlasting chaos
Make me see and hear how to
Consume the world in absolute darkness

I seek the truth the vengeance in my heart
The flame which burns for wisdom awakened
A wild untamed hatred to rise for powers
To rise for the coming of chaos

I despise the weak and the blind masses
Who are but sheeps
At the altar of madness and total freedom
I will unlock the gates to it all

By blood I sacrifice
With discipline I conquer
By blood I sacrifice
With strength I rule
A new dawn

Let the flames of the black abyss burn the heart of the earth
Let there be chaos let there be a new dawn at last
Let the flames of the black abyss burn the heart of the earth
Let there be chaos let there be a new dawn at last

I seek the truth the vengeance in my heart
The flame which burns for wisdom awakened
A wild untamed hatred to rise for powers
To rise for the coming of chaos
