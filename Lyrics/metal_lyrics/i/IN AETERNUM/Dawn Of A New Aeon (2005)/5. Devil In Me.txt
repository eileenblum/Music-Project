For Iâm the tool of him
To punish the weak observer
To strengthen the strong and to
Annihilate the weakness within

May God have mercy on your souls
For I will not
Fear me for what I am
A believer of purest truth

I am guided by the Devil in me
I am guided by the Devil in me

I am
Purest truth
Purest hate

Your lives mean nothing to me

Your lives mean nothing to me
I have the Devil in me

And I am merciless

I am the tool of him
To punish the weak observer
To strengthen the strong and to
Annihilate the weakness within

I am guided by the Devil in me
I am guided by the Devil in me
