We chant the hellish words of blasphemy
We speak the words of evil
We call for Lucifer
And sacrifice to our lord

In the dying light of our candles
We summon the dark of night
We raise our blood filled cups
For the unholy lord of the damned

Come, come forth mighty ruler of sin
Appear in full glory and pride
Rise through the pentagram
And show us your sign of existence

Open wide the gates of hell
Of fire we are born

The nocturnal sacrifice has begun
A virgin soul for the powers of unholy truth
Bring forth the existence of yours
And rise through the pentagram

Blasphemy and sin Lucifer has come
And light was consumed by his powers
Master of storms and father of all evil
The gate will forever be opened

Of unhallowed blood

Open wide the gates of hell
Of fire we are born
