Queen of the night enemy to the sun
And servant of darkness who walks beyond the mortals
In the hour of darkness to extinguish
The life of humans

Her thirst for blood is the death of a human existence
The vampiric art of immortality

As the mist comes closer
And darkness the sun
Come to me and gather in the night

As the mist comes closer and darkness the sun
Once again the night is here and she thirsts for life

The pale black death

Come on you little humans

Dragged into the shadows
Possessed by her beauty
To end their lives for the queen
Of the night

Who caresses the pale Black Death
Under the dying night

But death awaits you
Prepare to die

The pale black death
