Reaper in black

Clad in black he comes
Back from the shadows to haunt the living
Sinners of Christ and bearer of light
The reaper's night has begun

Claws of death desire's the living soul of yours
The reaper of death the shadow of the night
He will give you the ultimate death
And take you to the burning fires of Hell

Fires of Hell
Fires of Hell

Reaper in black will come forth
Reaper in black will come forth

By the blessing of Satan

High upon stakes you shall suffer your loss
Impaled and sacrificed

Reaper in black
Reaper in black

Await the final legions united by sin and lust
To triumph over the feeble light
Usurpers of hell arise and follow the reaper
