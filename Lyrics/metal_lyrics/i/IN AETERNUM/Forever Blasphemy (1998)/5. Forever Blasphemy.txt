Forever blasphemy

The wind bears the smell of blood
Death is in the air
Hunting the life of god's disciples
Sentenced to die

We're the fist in the face of god
We are of unhallowed blood born

By fire by iron and steel
Blasphemy to the light born

Tortured screams are heard
Burned at stakes and sodomized
Allow us to drink thy blood
Allow us to feast on your flesh

Soldiers of Satan gather and follow
The smell of weakness and betray
Curse the holy life, Armageddon is near

We're the fist in the face of god
We are of unhallowed blood born

Superior mighty evil
Blood and blasphemy
Fire burned the last betrayer
Come force of the dark

By fire by iron and steel
Blasphemy to the light born

Forever blasphemy

By fire by iron and steel
Blasphemy to the light born

We're the fist in the face of god
We are of unhallowed blood born

Superior mighty evil
Blood and blasphemy
Fire burned the last betrayer
Come force of the dark
