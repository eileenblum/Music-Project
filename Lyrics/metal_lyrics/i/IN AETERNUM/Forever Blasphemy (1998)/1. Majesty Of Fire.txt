Hidden from the sun
In the chambers below the ground
Walls made from human bones
An unhallowed place of sin

This place holds the truth
Of the fading light of goodness
This place of sin

And gathered here are we who
Are born of sin
Where life dwells no more

The majesty of fire shall caress your
Lifeless soul
For the last time you'll see the light
Soon to die

The majesty of fire creased you
And life ceased to be

Open wide the throats of lie
And let evil be supreme
Open wide the throats of lie
Damnation's bell is struck

The majesty of fire shall caress your
Lifeless soul
For the last time you'll see the light
Soon to die

We have come to slay the light
And crush the lie
Like a malicious storm of hate
The wind swept away their tortured screams

This place holds the truth
Of the fading light of goodness
This place of sin

The majesty of fire creased you
And life ceased to be

Open wide the throats of lie
And let evil be supreme
