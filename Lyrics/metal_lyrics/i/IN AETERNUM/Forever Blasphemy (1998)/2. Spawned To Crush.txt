A thunderbolt and born was the antichrist
Born was I
Spawned from depths below

Baptized in the flames of fire eternal
I drank the blood

My life belongs to the dark side and I was spawned
To sodomize and crush the will of god

Mighty am I the master of all life
Mighty am I the destructor
Be prepared for the wrath of the antichrist

Spawned to crush

The power I possess the knowledge that I have
Focused as one giant force to crush

The light in their eyes has vanished
Disciples twelve are dead
Jehovah's hordes are slaughtered
And blood stains the ground
The light in their eyes has vanished
The light in their eyes has died

The light in their eyes has vanished
Disciples twelve are dead
Jehovah's hordes are slaughtered
And blood stains the ground

Suffer I'll sodomize you all
For I'm the antichrist master of all
Life and destructor
