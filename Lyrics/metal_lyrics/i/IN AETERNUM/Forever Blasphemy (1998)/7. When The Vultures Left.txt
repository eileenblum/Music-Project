Bring forth the darkness
It's the fading of the light
Bring forth the pain of dark delight
I breathe for the life beyond the light
Eternity is waiting

Embraced by shadows I await
The call of damnation's retribution
It's the call for darkness and grief
Slay the liars to the cross of humanity

Die by my hand
Taste the blood
Spill the blood of the weak
Hear the call of damnation
Hear the call of retribution

Feeble men of Christ I'll watch
You fade away
From the throne of dark domains
I rule

Hear the call of lost souls pray
Fade into the night
Hear the call of dark
Obey your cries

Sons of Satan rise in superior retribution
When the vultures leave there will be
Only one who of darkness breathes to rule
Sons of Satan rise

Sinners be as one, united through blood
Light bearer, come into the sulfur fire

When the vultures left I stood supreme
When the vultures left humanity had died

Hear the call of damnation
Hear the call of retribution

Hear the call of lost souls pray
Fade into the night
Hear the call of dark
Obey your cries
