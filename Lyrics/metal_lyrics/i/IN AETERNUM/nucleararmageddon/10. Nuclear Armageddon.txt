Mankind the false of humanity tolerated scum of the earth
Fools destined to die by the truth
I command and you will submit my orders
Invade kill destroy
I command and you will die forgotten

I am the leader of chaos
The conqueror supreme
I command for blood and war
Armageddon to come forth

Technology ahead of it's time
In my hand a tool to destroy
Weapons of merciless onslaught
The way to tame the fools

Scum of the earth, destined to die

The weak minded people not worthy of life
A new race to be born immediately
The failure must be repaired
A start for the second world
Buttons pushed

Embraced by the cold and dark
Men and women of the new race order
Rise in glory and pride

I am thy leader of chaos
The conqueror supreme
I command for blood and war
Armageddon to come forth

Nuclear Armageddon
