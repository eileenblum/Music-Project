This can't be real
So open your eyes
Open your eyes
I've been awake in this dream
Oh god tell me this isn't real
You've made me your fucking puppet
As I sit in the palm of your hand
I bleed your name, and your feelings are not the same
She leaves me to die, she leaves me to do inside.
Just open your eyes, take a look at yourself
I've been awake in these dreams for too long.
Ash, is the sky above me
And you are the center of the fucking disease.
I want you to feel the hurt that you have given me, I want you
I hope I never see you again
Cause I'll never feel you
I've been awake in this dream for far too long
I hope I never see you again
I've been awake in this dream for far too long.
