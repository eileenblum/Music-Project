[2017 re-issue track][feat. Ryan Kirby]This water is getting colder
Like the chills that follow your spine.
Take for granted every fucking thing,
This is going down in history.

I can't even remember
When I saw a color that wasn't red.
My body is boiling beneath the thread
I'd rather be fucking dead

Cut me from my skin so I can feel alive.
(I need to go)
It's hard to realize that something in my life is missing.
My life is missing [3x]

This water is getting cold
My life is getting old
Take me away
I'm fading away

What do I stand for?
Epiphany I don't have time for apologies
This it means when you have no love.
I just want the pain to fucking go.

My demons are calling
They want to play with me in the sky.
I never thought this was important
I want my dreams to fucking die

I'm fading away
All I see is black in my sleep.
Figures of mercy take me away
I want my dreams to fucking die.

[Ryan]
There's more to life than surrender
You don't have to bleed again.
Even when the noose is growing tighter
You can fight from within.
Fight, fight from within.
You don't have to bleed again.
Fight, fight from within.
This is where these thoughts will end.

Cut me from my skin so I can feel alive.
(I need to go)
It's hard to realize that something in my life is missing.
My life is missing [4x]
