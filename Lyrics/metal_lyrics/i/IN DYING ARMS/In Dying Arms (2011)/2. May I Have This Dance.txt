These wounds will never heal
I've forgotten how to feel
I lie in this bed
Drowned in my own self pity
With thoughts going through my head
This blade sinks in oh so deep.
Time is up, I blew this chance
Please miss may I have this dance.
If only I could turn back time
I'd leave these burdens far behind
If only I could turn back time
If only I could turn back time.
My time was up, I blew this chance
For the last time, may I have this dance
Please miss, may I have this dance
If I could turn back time
I'd leave these burdens behind.
My time is up, I blew this chance
Please miss, may I have this dance.
