I wish that you could hear me now
If only you were here with me
And I can't belive
That you would do this to me
I gave you my everything
This is the way its supposed to be
You were my everything
Baby please don't cry
I keep everything inside
I've failed so many times, at least in your eyes
Forgive me, forgive me, now I know you forgot me,
But I can't forgive you.
I know you've forgotten about me,
But I haven't forgotten about you.
Forget my name
Forget my face
For we are not the same
You've been erased.
Forget my name, my face, you've been erased.
