I can save you
But this is the last time
I let you rot
In your own self-pity
I can save, I will save
What's left of forever.
But this is, will not be the end
I will bind what has been undone
And I'll break this pain away
And I'll save you for another day
I can save you
From yourself
But I, Can barley keep this together
And while your screaming forever
I'll just be here with another
I can save, I will save
What's left of forever.
