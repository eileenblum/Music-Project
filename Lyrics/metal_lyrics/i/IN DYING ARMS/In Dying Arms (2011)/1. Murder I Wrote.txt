Your love is a fallacy
You can't get the best of me
And you don't want to be a big dissappointment
So open wide and don't say a fucking word.
Bitch, I've had enough of this shit
Whad do you have to say for yourself?
Bitch, I've had enough of this shit
Bitch, I've had enough of this shit
What do you have to say for yourself
What do you have to say..
And I will take your breath away tonight
But we can still carry on
My feelings are just as strong
Bury me with your shame
Fuck me with your desire
Your lips quiver from my touch
Tensions rise as I proceed
Your grasp is tight
As I take your breath away
This will be the last time you see me
And I will take your breath away tonight
And you wont get the best of me tonight
It ends here, it ends here
Your eyes turn white as I take your breath away.
