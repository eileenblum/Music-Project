I watched you fade away
From every fucking thing
Your words are empty
This beauty is such a sin
My strength has been diminished
By such a small hand
I watched you fade away
From every fucking thing
I watched you slip away
From everything.
And I fall (pick me up)
Right from your arms (so pick me up)
Pick me up
Cause I feel you slipping from my finger tips.
I'm losing my grip
But why is it I feel you clawing
At my neck
I'm losing my grip.
I'm keeping you alive
Alive in my mind
Why the fuck won't you die?
Am I the only one that's keeping you alive?
But this pain, it feels so real
The pains astonishing, it's all I know to feel
So, slip away
Why was I put in this place?
Why did you leave me here all alone
I watched you slip away
From every fucking thing.
