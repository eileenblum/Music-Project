Do you remember?
The last words you said to me?
Neither do I
This weight is getting hard to carry
The weight of my regrets
Now I let it fall
This weights getting harder to carry
As your body has fallen to the floor
With these hands I will hold you forever
As your screaming and crying for more
I regret everything that I said
My life is no longer the same
With these hands I will hold you forever
With these hands I will hold you forever
I know your in a better place.
The only thing that keeps me going
Is the thought of your face.
I, remember.
What have you done?
Is there something more than this?
Will I ever hear your voice again
I never got to say goodbye
I know your in a better place.
The only thing that keeps me going
Is the thought of your face.
I remember us (you ask if I...)
I remember us
(The only thing that keeps me going is your...)
Forgive me. What have I done?
Darling, We were so young
I remember us
You ask if I remember this
Bitch I remember everything
You just werent meant for me.
