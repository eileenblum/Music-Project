Why don't you shut your fucking face..
SHIT!!
As I hold you from your tongue
Every word you fucking spit
That was shat from your lungs
Were all fucking wasted
You told me all this shit
Now I feel so stupid that I wish
You don't exist
Wish fucking granted..
OH.. Shut your face..
It's only just begun
My heart is throbbing as I
Do this just for us
With a smile on my face
What will we ever be
No one will ever see
What will we ever be
When will we ever be the same.
With our bodies, buried, 6 feet.
I will never give up
When will you say enough.
Will we ever be the same?
I wish you don't exist, you took this for granted.
I will never give up today. You're not the same.
