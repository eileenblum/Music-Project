I am never scared
I am what you fear
You are beneath me
I have seen the light burning deep inside
Dig deep
Dig deep
Now lay me down to sleep
I lie here in this bed you've made
I fall so hard for all the shit you say
I've been staring you in the eye
This whole time
Watching you lie
Watching you cry
You won't hold me back anymore
It's my turn to make a move
And I've got nothing to lose
Where were you when I was down?
Now that you're here I don't need you around
I've got you right where I want you
And you don't even fucking know
Traumatized by all this hate
My life is yours
Yours to take
Now that you've made me your king
Bow down to me
Now get the fuck off your knees
I've been staring you in the eye
This whole time
Watching you lie
Watching you cry
You won't hold me back anymore
I have seen the light
Burning deep inside
