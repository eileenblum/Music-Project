I've found myself
Without your help
I've found myself
This is who I am
When there is nothing left
And the ones you love treat you like shit
Tell me
Tell me
Will we see the light of day?
Stand up tall
Break my fall
I've seen it all
I've seen my rise and fall
I've seen it all
It just hurts when there's no one to call
I've found myself again
No this is not the end
And after everything
I see
And after everything
I see
I've seen it all
I've seen my rise and fall
I've seen it all
I just hurts when there's no one to call
