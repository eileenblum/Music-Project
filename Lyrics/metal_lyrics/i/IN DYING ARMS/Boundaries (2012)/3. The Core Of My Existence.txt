Iâm falling faster
to the core
of my existence
these walls are caving in
and Iâm just a piece of the puzzle
I could never be
what you wanted me to be
and Iâm taking this in
as this life exits my veins
âCause Iâm falling faster
through the core
of my existence
and it feels like
I could die
and it feels like
we could fly (we could fly)
I could never be
what you wanted me to be
And now this high is growing thin
I turn to you
What should I do?
just light the match
just light the match
and watch me burn
watch me burn
you watch me burn
as I wither away
you are shaden by grey
as I wither away
come fucking blow me away
Iâm falling faster
falling faster
I could never be
what you wanted me to be
âCause Iâm falling faster
through the core
of my existence
and it feels like
I could die
and it feels like
we could fly (we could fly)
Now that this high is growing thin
I turn to you
What should I do?
just light the match
just light the match
and watch me burn
so come blow me away
as I wither away
I could never be
what you wanted me to be
blow me away
