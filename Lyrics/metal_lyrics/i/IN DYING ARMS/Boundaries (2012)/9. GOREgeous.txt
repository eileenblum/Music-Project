I touch your hair softly.
A chill down my spine.
I touch your hair softly.
A chill down my spine.

The smile that you gave.
The smile that you gave.
Could never match mine.
But I hesitate to take this chance.
As I look at your face.

I sit here across from you.
Your eyes look in mine.
I see the beauty in you.
You're looking so good.
I have to taste.
I don't even know you.
But I, I know your face.
I know your face.
I know your face.
I know your face.

Your beauty is mine.
Try not to cry.
There's no one but us.
Your beauty is mine.
Try not to cry.
There's no one but us.

And then she screams.
This is misunderstood.
I rip off your clothes.
I made it feel good.
You're crying for help.
But there's no one around.
I give you a kiss.
Then put you on the ground.

I can't stop.
I feel your heart.
I'll take your beauty.
You're so gorgeous.
