This world is coming down
Who'll be next to me?
Who'll be next to me?
I took this final chance
To put myself to the test
And when you're with him in your bed
Remember what I said
When you're thinking about me
I'll be thinking about you
I've been drowning in your tears
I can't take this anymore
It doesn't hurt just to run away
This world is coming down
Who'll be next to me?
Who'll be next to me?
You're always one step ahead of me
I can't keep up the pace
I can't keep up the pace
You always leave me
Caught in your tracks
I've reached my destination
There's no turning back
When will I find a way out this time?
When will I find a way out?
I can't do this alone
It doesn't hurt just to run away
This world is coming down
Who'll be next to me?
Who'll be next to me?
I'm still running away
I'm still running away
