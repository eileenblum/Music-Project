I've been wishing for something new
But nothing can amount to you
My dreams are scenes
I don't understand
Sometimes I wake up
And don't know who I am

You told me how to hate
You showed me how to love
I can't change you
You showed me how to hate you

It seems like this is too good to be true
Just me and you
Just me and you
Let's make a wish
One last kiss
How can I love what did not exist?

I can't take back the things I've said
I can't take back the things I've done
But all I can do
Is take the bullets out that gun
I can't take back the things I've said
I can't take back the things I've done
But all I can do
Is take the bullets out that gun

You led me to the edge
You held me by the hand
You've pushed me off the edge
And this is why I hate!

You told me how to hate
You showed me how to love
I can't change you
You showed me how to hate you
