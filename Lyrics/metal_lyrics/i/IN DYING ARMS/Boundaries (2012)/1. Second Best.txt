I refuse to be second best
I've been picking these bullets out my chest
I can't die
I can't die
But you suck the life out of me
Fuck you
I can't breathe with your guilt wrapped around my neck
I can't breathe with your guilt wrapped around my neck
You lie so elegant as the dress falls from your waist
Your lips touch my fingertips
Can I get a taste?
Your dress hits the floor
This is me asking for more
Clinching my fist
I'm holding back but I can't resist
You say that I'm the one?
You've been added to the list
Choke on me
As your dress hits the floor
This is me asking for more
I refuse to be second best
I refuse to be second best
