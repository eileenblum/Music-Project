I'm blind by the lies
Deaf by all the cries
But standing strong as I walk alone
There's something deep inside of me that no one else can see
Dreams of the life that could never be
There's something deep inside
Or is it in my mind?
I can't breathe
There's something inside me
So I just dream
I just dream
Blind to the truth of what didn't last
I keep moving forward
But keep looking back
Can this be real?
This time?
Or is it in my mind?
This doesn't exist
We're not made to see
I fall to pieces when you look at me
This smile hides a million lies
My words are empty promises of what I never tried
Where do I pick up where I left off?
I try
I try
I tried my best this time
I cry
I cry
And now it's time to say goodbye
I can't breathe
There's something inside me
So I just dream
I just dream
Blind to the truth of what didn't last
I keep moving forward
But keep looking back
