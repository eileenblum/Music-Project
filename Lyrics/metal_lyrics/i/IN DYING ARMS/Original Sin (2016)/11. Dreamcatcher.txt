Repeating cycles of paralysis nightmares
Has left me wondering why should I sleep?
Trying to remember a time, when beauty this aligned, occurred right
Before my eyes
I've always been the one to come up short, to be unstable
But Iâm perfectly able
I just want to go back to a time
Where I can breathe again

My ambitions always get shut down
But nothing can take this away
I must stay strong
You have always tried to hold me down
But nothing can take this away
I must stay strong

I must stay strong

I'll always chase this until the end of time
I'll always chase you
Where we can both collide
I'll always chase this until the end of time
I'll always chase you
If only we could grasp it

We could be so high
But the weight of the world's always bringing me down
We're standing on hollowed ground
No substance in life but the will to survive
But how can we live this way
I will meet my maker, I will escape

I can face this

There's a whisper that speaks in volumes
It draws the fear right out of my mind
Can you hear the voices at night?
Can you hear the voices at night?

I'm not as strong as I think I am
I'm not as strong as I think I am
I'm not as strong as I think I am
But I know I can conquer this

It's haunting how the color fades and the flavor loses its taste
But I can't keep away
I'm waiting for the day when all of my dreams don't seem so far away

My ambitions always get shut down
But nothing can take this away
I must stay strong
You have always tried to hold me down
But nothing can take this away
I must stay strong

I must stay strong
