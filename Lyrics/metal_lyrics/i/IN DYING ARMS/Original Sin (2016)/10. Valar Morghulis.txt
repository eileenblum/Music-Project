Summoned once again
I've come to extinguish humanity
No negotiations
This is my
World proclamation
Season obliteration
God damn this world
Promise me blasphemy

Blasphemy

I've lost my trust in the truth
Living condemned in this world of conviction
When did we become so powerless?

We've been enslaved to survive in this fucking prison
Drowning in the filth of all this heresy
Don't turn your back on me
Don't turn your back
Betrayer

Drowning in the filth of all this heresy
I've lost my trust in the truth
Promise me blasphemy

I sense my presence is known
The smell of fear is bringing me home
Allow me to introduce myself
I am the bastard who sought rejection
From hell
From the abyss
I took a chance with the devil's kiss
And what was left was a taste of poison
And there he lays
Swallowing the plague

Armageddon
The time is now
Are you listening god?
Are you listening?
Are you listening?
God is fucking dead

Armageddon
