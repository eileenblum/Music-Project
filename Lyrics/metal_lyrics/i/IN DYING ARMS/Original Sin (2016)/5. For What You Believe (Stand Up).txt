I woke up with a hole in my chest
You are the burden that was stabbed in my back
I hate everything that you stand for
You're contagious, infectious, diseased

Rotting in fumes
The vessel will lay
Searching for answers on how we should be
Rotting in the fumes
The vessel will lay
Searching for the answers

I hold the power
Bow to my feet
How does it feel to be a slave

So don't try and fix me
I'll never be tamed
Don't try and test this
Accept no apology

Why do we sit and watch our world fall?
We have the strength to lift it up
We all know the struggle
We might be broken
But we won't fall down

Stand up for what you believe
Stop idolizing people that you wish you could be
Stand up
We all know the struggle
We might be broken but we won't fall down
Stand up for what you believe
Stop idolizing people that you wish you could be
Stand up
We all know the struggle
Stand up
Stand up
Stand up

There's not a price you could pay to earn respect and loyalty
You can't take back all the shame
Don't think this will save your fucking name

I tried my best to be like you
You had no faith in me
I tried to fill this void but you are my everything

Everything

I woke up with a hole in my chest
You are the burden that's stabbed in my back
You are contagious, infectious, diseased

I tried my best to be like you
You have no faith in me
You had no faith
I tried to fill this void but I won't fall down
I won't fall down this time

Stand up for what you believe
Stop idolizing people that you wish you could be
Stand up
We all know the struggle
We might be broken but we won't fall down
Stand up for what you believe
Stop idolizing people that you wish you could be
Stand up
We all know the struggle
Stand up
Stand up
Stand up
