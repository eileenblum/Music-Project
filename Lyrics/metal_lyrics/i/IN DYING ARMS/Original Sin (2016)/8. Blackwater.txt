I ask myself every night is it okay if I die?
And tell nobody
Nobody cares, nobody loves
And I leave a note who really gives a fuck?

But there's a fire that burns inside of me
It keeps on fueling when dreams seem out of reach
It might be useless
I know I'm one man
But I can change the world

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm drowning
These thoughts overpowering me
Tearing me apart
This fear overtakes me
It's starting to break me down
Tearing me apart

I feel like im drowning
I feel like it's tearing me apart
These thoughts overpowering
I feel like it's tearing me apart

It only kills me to watch you standing still
It only kills me to know you let me fail
Feeding negativity and dwelling on your doubts
I want to find a way out

But theres a fire that burns inside of me
It keeps on fueling when dreams seem out of reach
It might be useless
I know I'm one man
But I can change the world

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm drowning
These thoughts overpowering me
Tearing me apart
This fear overtakes me
It's starting to break me down
Tearing me apart
