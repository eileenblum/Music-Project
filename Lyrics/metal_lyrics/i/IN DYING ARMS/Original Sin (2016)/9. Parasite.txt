Let me go
Its taken me too many years
To realize I'm the victim
This won't be the last time I'll
Succum to your ways of the system

Let me go
You've got me clinching to the edge of my seat
I'm brainwashed by a leech
Parasite
I feel you crawling inside me
These wounds will never define me

Can't you see
You're clawing out of your shell
Ensure me
That you'll drag me to hell

I don't give a fuck what your name is
I don't care who you think you are
I exist for one purpose

I will stop at nothing until you die

I won't stop fighting
I won't stop climbing
You can try to stop me
You can't halt the will of a man

The will of a man

Let me go
You've got me clinching to the edge of my seat
I'm brainwashed by a leech
Parasite
I feel you crawling inside me
These wounds will never define me

Go

This cancer is taking my life
Until the day comes
I'll be biding my time
