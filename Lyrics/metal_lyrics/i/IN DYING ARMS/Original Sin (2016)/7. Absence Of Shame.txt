Let me consume you
You never put up a fight
My lust for this feeling is my only vice
Pressure on my lips like the devils kiss
I let you in
I let you destroy
You are my favorite
Precious as gold is the bottom of the bottle

You bring me satisfaction with every fucking swallow
Digging deeper, drowning in never ending sorrow
I sit here alone
Breathing in your vile
Sick how your poison makes me fucking smile

Makes me fucking smile

So keep destroying yourself
I can't live this life
You feed off others regret
Why can't you stand on your own

Cigarettes and empty conversations
Warm whiskey and expectations
The circle continues
Stop flooding yourself in the heart of a spiral
Stop flooding yourself and face all your problems

Stop flooding yourself

I think I'm in love
You are my possession
Bleeding from the inside is my new obsession

So keep destroying yourself
I can't live this life
You feed off others regret
Why can't you stand on your own
