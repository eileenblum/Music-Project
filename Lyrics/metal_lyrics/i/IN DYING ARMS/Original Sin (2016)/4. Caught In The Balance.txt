I'm caught in the balance
Dangling by these chains of my mind
I might be next to you
But I'm so far away

I'm sick of blaming you
You were right by my side
Tired of pretending
My life is a fucking lie

No more holding it in
All of my peers think I'm losing my shit
I know I've been changing
But you've stayed the same

You think you can see me?
I am one with the shade

I am one with the shade

I'm stuck and I'm loving it
Why can't I just fucking coexist
I know I'm a problem
I am the antagonist

I am caught in the balance
Why must I feel one with the darkness?
We are stuck in the silence
Why must we feel one with this sickness?

I know why you never look at me in the eye
I know the reason your skin is tight
I am a monster

You think you can see me?
I can't even see myself
The pressure is building
My wall's are crashing down

My wall's are crashing down

I am caught in the balance
Why must I feel one with the darkness
We are stuck in the silence
Why must we feel one with this sickness
One with this sickness

You think you can see me?
I'm one with the shade
