You thought you knew everything about life
You're blinded by a father, protected from the strife
I thrive on greed and all that its worth
You say You know of pride, ill bring you down to size

Erase the existence you claim to be
FADE TO BLACK
Thia is the consequence for those who
DISOBEY

She saw the threat in my eyes, oh god
In the sweat of your face
Shall you eat your bread
I am your maker
Maker of sin

Maker of sin

The prize has been accepted
Breathe life of immortality

Just take a look at what you've done
You've burned your only bridge straight down to the fucking ground
Your destiny has just begun
The prize has been accepted
Now you're blood line will be condemned

You're bloodline will be condemned

For fathers are forsaken
Their actions spilled in blood
Awareness of the naked
For betrayal of the lord

You will die in vain
