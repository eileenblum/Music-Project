Our kind has now been distinguished
We are trapped and deceived
For the invasion of our kind
I won't stand still anymore
The person you believed
Was marked a fraud
Before the start
We are the key to this revolution
I will be deemed
You world's suppressor

Paint your filthy
Picture of life
All over these walls
Of this fabricated
Existence
You've created for yourself because

You're so afraid
Of what we can do
Of what we are capable of

You knew this road would
Lead you here in the end
You love this
For all the wrong reasons
You're just a shell
Empty inside
You long for the attention
You think you deserve
I am beyond
Your imagination
I'm in control
Of this fucking generation
You've abused
Everything that you know
And love
Your beauty is a sign
Of everything you're fucking not

To be within and without
You want to know what it feels like
Take you eyes off
The screen

We put our lives on display
As if we're waiting for
The grand escape
Depression all time
I once thought I could fly
You're so afraid
I once thought I could fly [2x]

You're so afraid
Of what we can do
Of what we're capable of
I once thought I could fly
But these wings are too weak
To catch the night
I asked my questions
I looked for signs
And all you left was a taste
Of how I'm wasting
My time

We are the key to this revolution
