Yet again
another betrayal

Time was just an obstacle
a trap for you to captivate;
No, apology not accepted
this helpless feeling never leaves 

I hope he was worth the pain
was he worth the pleasure?
I can see through the lies you feed
as if I'm the animal to your falsification

And what is to be expected of me?
Forever?
The consequences will be great
Liberate me

What is the worth of my words?
When my words don't mean shit.
Yet, yet again another betrayal

Sometimes promises are meant to be broken
