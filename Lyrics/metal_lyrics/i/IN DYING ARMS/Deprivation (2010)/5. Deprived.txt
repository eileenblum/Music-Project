Oh, How I wish it was all a dream.
The repetition has left me in awe;
Ive seen this behavior once before.

I said I would wait forever...
you said forever would never come.

Shame has forever been bestowed upon me.
Lust is her never ending desire to kill.
If penetration would be the sin
Then allow me to deliver the devil her crown.

When will we connect our thoughts as one?
Is it possible we could actually be one?
The future is let to be determined;
when distance has become our everlasting demise.

If I could feel you for one more day
I would give my everything

I said I would wait forever...
you said forever would never come
