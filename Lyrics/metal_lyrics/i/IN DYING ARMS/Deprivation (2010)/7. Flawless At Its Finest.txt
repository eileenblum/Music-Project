Why does it have to be this way

I love the way your kisses scar
The blackest thoughts they always call
your scent is flawless at its finest
the presence of my nightmare in flesh

so we meet again, the epitome of my dreams

Don't say I will leave, don't say no.
Ill take this from my heart
you wont have to be
everyone will know that you're not this way
who will be there not to be

I want you by my side
to have and hold your mine
if only you were here
your kisses are designed to perfectly match mine
if only you were real

we are so in love
So we meet again, the epitome of my dreams
Don't say, you'll leave,

We are in love, we are in love
