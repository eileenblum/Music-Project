I've never felt so exhilarated, 
I can't picture this frame being broken. 
A fragile display of what we are, 
fragile, be gentle, 
don't break what we have.

My hands slide down your perfect structure. 
My senses are tightening by the second. 
I could never see this bind breaking. 
I see you on your knees like how is your fucking kind. 
You disgust me like a slut. You disgust me like a cunt.

The scars spread all around yourself, 
if you're so pure, then whats that blemish. 
Your blemish
