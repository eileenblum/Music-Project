My soul is hollow
My heart feels so cold
My soul is hollow I'll give you nothing but sorrow
My heart feels so cold it freezes all warm feelings

You trusted me with your love
I threw it away because I have none
Now you look at me with eyes of hate
Your heart is broken but mine is dead (my heart is dead)

I cannot ask for forgiveness (forgiveness)
Remember I don't know what it means (and I don't care)
You constantly say that I'm hollow (I'm fucking hollow)
I feel so empty (maybe you're right)

Spread the world I am the devil
And I made your life hell
Spread the world I am the devil
Make everyone believe almost even me
And I made your life hell
I guarantee that's what I live as well

I feel your sorrow, I don't care, I'm hollow
I feel your sorrow, I don't care, I'm hollow
I feel your sorrow, fuck you, like you I'm hollow

You can fool everyone but life
So fill in yours and I'll fill this hole in mine
