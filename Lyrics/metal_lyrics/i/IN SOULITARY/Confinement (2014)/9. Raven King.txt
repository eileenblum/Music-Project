It was three in the morning
I'm in the middle of my sleep
When he came to speak to me he said,
âYou shouldn't be afraid, but I have to take you away.â

Oh Raven King what do you mean?
Is it true or is it only a dream?

He has come (he has come)
Black winged form (black winged form)
He has come (he has come)
Now my life is gone
He has come (he has come)
Mighty raven take me home

There was no escape as his shadow came before me
It was so dark I could not see
He said, âCome in peace just lay down it's time to sleep.â

Oh Raven King what do you mean?
Is it true or is it only a dream?

Raven King what does this mean
Raven King is this but a dream
Raven King the Raven King will come for you and me
