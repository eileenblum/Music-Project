You bet I will break up this seal
Make one believe that I can be real
IÂ´ll make a stand, I shall be heard
And no one else will ever make me shut (up)

I will not be the one who they call a John Doe
I will not sit here and watch this river flow
IÂ´ll carve my whole name in the stone with sweat, blood and soul
Will shine bright in this river of colorless souls

I will make a stand and be one with my word

Destiny is killing me
Making me believe
IÂ´m too late to speak
I canÂ´t see
Why I should be
As quiet as they want me to be

IÂ´ll break the seal, make it all real

And even if it flows, IÂ´ll stick to my ideals
I can follow the course, but swim my own way
As far as we all know, time doesnât always heal
ItÂ´s a spectacle to stand strong in the right place
yeah

IÂ´m not the unknown, not in the darkness
Into the light IÂ´ll put it on your sight
Oh river of quiet, river of death
IÂ´m not following this ever flowing stream of souls!
I will make a stand and be one with my word
IÂ´ll break the seal and make it all real
The river is sad and theyÂ´ll end up all dead
They shall never know what they have left

And my time will only be complete
When I write my name in the books you will read
I will stand strong, my words will go on
It will go on!
