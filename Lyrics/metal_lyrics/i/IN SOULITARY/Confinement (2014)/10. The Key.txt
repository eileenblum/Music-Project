Last night, a nightmare instead
Of the usual lack of dreams
I shouldnÂ´t let it make me sad
But it insists on being so damn real

All the nights awaken
In the black of tomorrow
The face of fear
It never ends
There should be another way
I will find the key

I will fly
To tame my own mind
To see whatâs beyond
It hurts so bad
I found the key
It may be the chance
I want to leave it here
I will fly
No matter what
I need to see
I need to end this

See it in the raining glass
See it in the blood which spills
The nightmare is forever dead
For you have forever left

I wish I was part of all, but instead
I was just a marble pawn
I was so cold, I could not resist
But no one came to dry my tears

All the places I went to
None that I can remember
Is free from sorrow
What can I say? Where can I run to?
I will go away

All what was is gone
You went lost, itâs done
No more nights or days
No more price to pay

No matter what
I had to see
I had to end this, I found the key
