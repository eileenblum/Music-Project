Into the mouth of madness
We all crumble down
Extinctions cold breath is
Calling us in the wind

One by one, into oblivion
A zombie kind, the human race
They will not stop, they will not see
How terrible, their end will be

Into the mouth (into the mouth)
Into the mouth of madness
We shall fall (we shall fall)
Extinction strike us down

We did this to ourselves
There's no pointing fingers now
This was written long ago
Turn the page and see our end
