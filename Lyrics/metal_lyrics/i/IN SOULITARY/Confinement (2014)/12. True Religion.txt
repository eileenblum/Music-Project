Is it too late? To know that our thoughts are fake?
Weâre sealing our fate, âcause we preach love but practice hate

It's time to spill the virgin's blood
Take the life of your only son
Why sacrifice and end life?
For believes that are based on lies

I will not follow you this is my decision
Out of oblivion there is no true religion

Tear down these spiritual walls
Spiritual walls that build others of stone
Respect your brother and the path he chose
Keep to yourself the one you're on
For it's only yours to follow

What is right?? I only see the wrong in life!
Which is the way?? We preach love but practice hate
That's what we do!!!

Follow lies it's your decision
It's time to steal for the true religion
Follow lies it's your decision
It's time to rape for the true religion

It's time to kill for the true religion
It's time to die for the true religion

It's time to die!!
