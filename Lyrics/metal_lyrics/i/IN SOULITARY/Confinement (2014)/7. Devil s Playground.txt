Temptation's within swallow the sin
Come play in the Devil's Playground
Enter the game no need for shame
Everybody is doing the same

A fallen race
Full of hate
Meets its fate

The Devil's Playground (Playground)

Since the beginning, brothers killed their brothers
Since the beginning, death is what we've hungered FOR!!

Inside this pin, the game of pretend is the most played of them all
See them CRY, DIE, STEAL and KILL and pretend you've never seen the blood spill

What have we done? Our children's future burns
This violence is in our blood, we pass it down to our sons
How can this stop?
A lot is said but nothing's done
Talk is cheap on and it keeps going on!!!
And on and on!!!

If compared to you it is stronger
You will never stand the hunger
So come and play with me
In the Devil's Playground
