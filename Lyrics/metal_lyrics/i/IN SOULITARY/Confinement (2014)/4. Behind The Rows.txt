Come little children (come little children)
Gather around (gather around)
Do as I say (do as I say)
Disobey and you will never see another day

Kill Kill in my name
Die Die not in vain
I'll save your soul I'll swallow it whole
Behind the rows it's time you go

Put'em on the Cross the cause of your loss
They the impure carriers of unholy lust
They will never say again what you can't and what you must
Now I am the only God you love 'n' trust

I am he to whom your lives were sworn
Youâre my blood and seed
Come walk behind the rows

Make them bleed, destruction is my creed
Leave the corpses to the crows, come walk behind the rows

Live as slaves, to the end of your days
And when your time comes I will take you away
