I should know since my birth that the end would come for everyone
But how some things can be explained, brought to light and just make sense
I ask myself what is true
What the hell should I do when my father is taken from me?
I swear I just canât comprehend

Out of sight - what exists?
Underground or beneath
Feelings that I have lost, tormented and creating chaos in my own mind

The deep fear - Iâm lost without you here
My deepest fear - my thoughts i canât hear

I wish I could hear you, one more time, one more dream
Wipe the coldness from my eyes â clean the dark hole in my heart

IÂ´m confused, can it be explained, why do I have to face that pain
No father should bury his son, but the other way isnÂ´t fair enough
I ask myself what to believe
Should I cry? Should I grieve?
When my ground is taken from me, do I give up or fight till the end?

Out of sight - what exists?
Underground or beneath
Feelings that I have lost, tormented and creating chaos in my own mind

The deep fear - Iâm lost without you here
My deepest fear - my thoughts i canât hear

Hear me, let me reach you â one more time, one more dream
Bring comfort to my heart, ease the chaos in my mind

Out of sight - what exists?
Underground or beneath
Feelings that I have lost, tormented and creating chaos in my own mind

I drive fast through the city, looking for some relief
But I can never find my way
I drive fast through the city, looking for some relief
But I will never find you again
I drive fast through the city, looking for some relief
But I feeling like going insane
I drive fast through the city, looking for some relief
But I need to see you again
I drive fast through the city, looking for some relief
