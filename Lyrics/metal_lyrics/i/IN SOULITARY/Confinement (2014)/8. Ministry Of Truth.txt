War is peace, freedom is slavery
Ignorance is strength, ministry of truth

You are blind, brainwashed minds
There is no hope, your thoughts are crimes
Your life isn't yours, we take control

Who controls the past, controls the future
Who controls the present, controls the past
Lies today created, become the truth
Yesterday has faded, it don't exist

War is peace, freedom is slavery
Ignorance is strength, ministry of truth

The real power, the power over men
Make them suffer, obedience is not enough
Obey our will, never your own

You cannot fight, you cannot win
A wrong expression on your face, it will be your end
We will come at night, like we always do
We will drag you out of bed, to torture and kill your mind

Wherever you go He will know
Remember He is watching you
