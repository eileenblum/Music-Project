The candle has stopped burning
The light has seized to be.
And my heart just keeps on yearning
Where is the love for me?

The mist is drawing nearer
The road has turned away.
Despair is getting clearer
I waste my life each day.

Come over here
Hold me for a while.
Take a rest with me
Before we walk the next mile.

Nights are getting dark
Hours fade to black
Dawn enlights the sky
A new day brings hope, don't ever look back.

The wind is blowing stronger
All hope for spring is gone.
The winter's getting longer
I am waiting for a dawn.

Rain is falling down on me
It covers me at night.
There's nothing left for me to see
I'm searching for the light.

Come over here
Hold me for a while.
Take a rest with me
Before we walk the next mile.

Nights are getting dark
Hours fade to black
Dawn enlights the sky
A new day brings hope, don't ever look back.

I'd pass the sea of a thousand tears just to see the sun again.
It's me that lived through all sad years, only good times will remain.
