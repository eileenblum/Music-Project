I've seen it all,
Been down the street.
The empty alleys,
Where the lonely bleed.

I paid the price
A price so dear,
For all my failures,
I've paid for years.

I've crossed the ocean
Of the broken hearted,
I met my luck
Just to be again parted.

Washed down the gutter
I found my new home.
On the edge of sanity
I lived on my own.

I've felt the loneliness of the night,
But I came back laughing at the light.

And I drowned in the sea
Of malice, of lies and of greed.
But I came back through the storm,
Stronger than life - I'm reborn!

I saw the mirror
I looked at me.
The shattered pieces
That were left to be.

For in the eyes of the others
They say lies true hell.
I found it to be true,
Learned to live with this spell.

I've left the theatre,
Burnt it down.
I've shut the door
Without a sound.

No more shadows
From the past I left behind.
Nothing stayed with me
But the scars in my mind.

I've lived the loneliness of the night,
But I came back cursing the light.

And I drowned in the sea
Of malice, of lies and of greed.
But I came back through the storm,
Stronger than life - I'm reborn!
