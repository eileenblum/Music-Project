[He: ]

Oh fate what have you done to me
The bitter taste of life I feel.
The darkness rises, the lights fade out
Three colours black is all my life's about.

[Fate: ]

Can't you see
Your life is yours,
It's not up to me
To decide every move.

[He: ]

Nothing did I do to anger you
Why do you punish me? Give me a clue.
You took my life you took it all,
Do you really enjoy to see me fall?

[Fate: ]

I never took
A thing of you,
Why don't you look
At what you do.

[Fate: ]

Every decision you will take
Has a consequence to come,
It's not up to me to make
Up your mind when you choose.

[He: ]

It's not my life it all is fate
Where's the help when you need it most?
For all I feel is confusion and hate
Despair is near, I lost the hope to reach the goals I could.

[Fate: ]

It's not all fate it's all your life
I wouldn't help you even if I could.
For with perfection this world was created
Don't despair, I gave you all to play the role you should.

[He: ]

you tell me all is up to me?
How can this be for I have seen
My future and my end,
In the theatre walking hand in hand.

[Fate: ]

What you have seen is your free will
It's the direction you took right then.
Do you think that after all
It would be the same if you went there again?

[He: ]

You might be right I do admit
But still there's hopelessness and with it
The rocky road that lies ahead
The faces of the past that drive me mad.

[Fate: ]

Have you really thought that life's so easy
And to solve your problems is all I do?
Every path you choose bears pain and hope
Which one succeeds is up to you.

[He: ]

What is if she's really right?
What is if I choose my path?
If it's up to me, I might
Have to make up my mind and choose.

[He: ]

It's not all fate it's all my life
I'd take no help even if she would.
For with perfection this world was created
I won't despair, I found all to play the role I should.

[Fate: ]

It's not all fate it's all your life
I wouldn't help you even if I could.
For with perfection this world was created
Don't despair, I gave you all to play the role you should.
