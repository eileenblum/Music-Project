On this road of broken dreams
The wind is blowing rough,
What became of my memories
The friendships that I've lost?

Once we were like brothers
Together on this path,
Now that you deceived me
All I feel is wrath.

My mind is burning
World are colliding
Fate is turning
It's time to go

Things around me change so fast
Nothing forever will last,
No one's left to blame
But things won't stay the same.

You told me I'm your best friend
No one else would ever have been,
But when good times left and bad times came
You were nowhere to be seen.

I thought our friendship lasts forever
I put my trust in you,
You destroyed my faith in mankind
And my Memories II.

Nothing left
From yesterday
We won't ever
Rise one day.

Things around me change so fast
Nothing forever will last
No one's left to blame,
But things won't stay the same.

Oh those days are long gone by
There is no more need to worry,
There's nothing you can do.
No love left for yesterday,
My heart is drowning in sorrow
And my Memories II.
