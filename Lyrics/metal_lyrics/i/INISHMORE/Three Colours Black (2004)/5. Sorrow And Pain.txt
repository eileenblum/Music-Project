Staring into the mirror
What do I see?
A broken madman
With a face like me!
Reflections of a shadow
That I once knew.
Every day's a circle
There's nothing new.

The sands of time are running, what will still remain?
Can you tell me who's behind the rain?

Sorrow and Pain are nearly the same,
When you cry late at night.
Sorrow and Pain are always the same,
In the absence of light.

I'm sitting all alone,
The walls just drift away.
The truth is never shown,
It changes from day to day.
It's what they'll make us all,
Us all believe.
Our brainwashed minds
Yearn for relief.

The sands of time are running, what will still remain?
Can you tell me who's behind the rain?

Sorrow and Pain are nearly the same;
When you cry late at night.
Sorrow and Pain are always the same,
In the absence of light.
