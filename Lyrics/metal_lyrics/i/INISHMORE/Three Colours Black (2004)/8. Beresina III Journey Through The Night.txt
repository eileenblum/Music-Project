Mountains of my home, eternal snow.
Valleys of green, with lakes down low.
But here I am at war so many miles away,
Far in the east where battle took its way.

No hope is near.
It's death we fear.
A frozen tear.
It's hard to bear.

Oh through the night I see the bridges burning behind
us. No relief for our tortured souls to find.
The mists of life, no hope for tomorrow,
The cold winds of death deepen our sorrow.

No hope is near.
It's death we fear.
A frozen tear.
But then we hear.

Our life is like the journey of a wanderer through the night,
But unexpectedly night and darkness leave out of sight
Courage, courage brothers the sun will rise again,
Stand tall for this night and you'll find release from pain.

These words fade away
In the light of day,
As the fire burns
And the battle turns.

We're running side by side,
There's no place to hide.
As the grenades crack,
There's no turning back.

All hope and luck is gone
My friends fall one by one.
There's no way to retreat,
In the battles heat.

Somehow I get ashore,
I can't take no more.
I reach the other side,
I don't know how I survived.

I survived

Mountains of my home, eternal snow.
Valleys of green, with lakes down low.
Back now I am, from a war so many miles away.
Far in the east where still many brave souls lie.

No hope is near.
It's death we fear.
A frozen tear.
But then we hear.

Our life is like the journey of a wanderer through the night,
But unexpectedly night and darkness leave out of sight
Courage, courage brothers the sun will rise again,
Stand tall for this night and you'll find release from pain.
