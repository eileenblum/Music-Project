Who wants to hear my story?
Do I want to face the truth?
The shadows of my worries
Are tearing at my youth.

Where else could I go?
What more shall I try?
When the kiss of love
Turns into a lie!

Can I steer the ship before it hits the shore?
Another broken cradle lying on the floor.

I've been searching for a God
But his face was turned away.
Father don't deceive me now
Your child led astray.

The dove has left, it's out sight,
An open door, a ray of light.
But it's just another night
Father, how can this be right?

Can I steer the ship before it hits the shore?
Another broken cradle lying on the floor.

I've been searching for a God
But his face was turned away.
Father don't deceive me now
Your child led astray.
