I used to live in a peaceful Land, forever it seemed to stay like this
I had a job, a family there was nothing that I had missed.
But one moment would change all of our lives,
out of nowhere the evil force arrived.
Helpless we had to accept the things to come.
Knowing they won't stop until all live is gone.
And now it's
Oppression and terror that reign,
and our hopes are lost in time,
if courage and pride can unite,
we will survive
though we live each day in fear,
and the clouds gather the night,
if a ray of light touches the ground,
we will survive.
Broken and in ashes lies the land I called my home.
Fugitives in our own world, we're living on the run.
Always hide in darkness, never see the light,
but our plans are finally made, we're ready for the fight
After all the quarrels united we now stand.
And we know most likely death will be our gain.
And still it's
Oppression and terror that reign,
and our hopes are lost in time,
if courage and pride can unite,
we will survive
though we live each day in fear,
and the clouds gather the night,
if a ray of light touches the ground,
we will survive.
