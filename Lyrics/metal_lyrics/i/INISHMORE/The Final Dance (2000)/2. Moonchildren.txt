We have fallen from the sky with burnig tears of fire
all unique but still we stand as one.
Drowning in the pains we share our knowledge is our sword,
that you'll never take from us.
The enchantment of love our deepest mistery
We saw all the hate throughout your history.
All of our warrior souls, ancient gods shall guide their way,
will rise out of the darkest night.
To lead your kind into the light we died a thousand deaths
But you'll never understand before it's to late
Knowing no fear yet with a smile on our face.
We'll be with you in the old worlds final days
We are Moonchildren warriors of faith.
We saw it all the rise and fall of man.
We are Moonchildren, legions of the dark.
Moonlight enlights our way to fullfill our destiny
All of our Spirits will rise to the heavens above
They'll be as free as one can finally be.
Lifted by our holy mother,
we then will build a new tomorrow,
through fire blood and holy tears.
We're not afraid we'll show no fear,
and in darkness we will lie,
till one day we will rise again...
And when our kingdom has come,
freedom will rise forever and for all mankind
We will stand for what we are,
until it's the world that comes to the end
We are Moonchildren warriors of faith.
We saw it all the rise and fall of man.
We are Moonchildren, legions of the dark.
Moonlight enlights our way to fullfill our destiny
