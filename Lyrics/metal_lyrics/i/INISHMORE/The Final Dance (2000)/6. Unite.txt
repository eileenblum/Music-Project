After all the pain that spread across the earth,
the hour finally came to rebellion we give birth.
Full of pride again, we'll face the enemy,
this is the hour! Again our own Kings we'll be.
So we wait for the moment to come,
when the battle will finally commence (Hail our leaders)
And we pray to the gods with all of our faith,
always to stay on our side (forevermore)
The power and the glory,
the honour and the pain,
all are now united,
waiting for us to gain...
Unite, Unite
Into the heavens with fire we'll rise,
we'll stay together don't care for the price,
with thunder and lightning we then shall return,
the gates are wide open our enemies will burn.
No more tears my friend, we're not standing there alone
This time it's for real, either they or we'll be gone!
All the pain and all the sorrow, the freedom we had lost.
We'll regain what once was ours no matter what the cost.
Now we're getting prepared in a dark hidden place,
we're going to follow the enemies trace.
Through the forest we sneak to come closer to them
An overwhelming feeling forever together we stand.
The power and the glory,
the honour and the pain,
all are now united,
waiting for us to gain...
Unite, Unite
Into the heavens with fire we'll rise,
we'll stay together don't care for the price,
with thunder and lightning we then shall return,
the gates are wide open our enemies will burn
Though this day might be our end,
our names will be kept in the mind of men.
Even in 100 years from now,
these fine warriors shall be known.
This is the time, this is the place,
this is the chance for the human race!
So we enter the city that we will take,
vengeance is ours we let go our hate!
