I feel the rain is falling down on me,
my thoughts are smashed upon the ground.
I'm walking through the wastelands of my soul,
I can't believe the world's out of control
I don't understand what is going on,
it won't take long till we all are gone.
The spirit left of humanity,
the new world order name's insanity.
We're riding the winds,
we'll never give in,
we are the ones who always will win.
We're faster then light,
ready to fight,
we are the ones who will stand the night.
Look through your window, open your eyes.
Make up your own mind, don't trust their lies.
Everything goes wrong on this earth, in this desert land once so lively and strong.
It's time for a change now, there will be a new dawn.
And we all will be free again,
like the birds in the sky.
We'll ride with the wind in our hair,
heading for a better time.
We're riding the winds,
we'll never give in,
we are the ones who always will win.
We're faster then light,
ready to fight,
we are the ones who will stand the night.
Can you feel it in your blood,
your desire and all your wishes?
The lonesome riding never ends,
till one day everybodys free again!
And it will never be the same,
once this world has finally changed,
the heavens will come down for all mankind
so take our hand and follow us,
we are the last ones you can trust,
we're riding again and again and again...
We're riding the winds,
we'll never give in,
we are the ones who always will win.
We're faster then light,
ready to fight,
we are the ones who will stand the night.
