20 Years the same old song,
it's a long time, you can't forget.
But, times have changed all around,
and now you wonder what's going on.
Friends they came, some have stayed
and some are gone, you know it's sad,
but those who really stuck to you,
are the only ones you'll never lose!
And now I know you are the ones,
the ones that always will be there,
the ones I hanged 'round in this late night bar.
Watching TV late in the night,
drinking whiskey, sharing the pains,
we went through everything, my friends.
Oh, these days are long gone by,
there is no more need to worry,
cause you live today.
All that's left from yesterday,
oh it frees my heart from sorrow
are my memories...
Good times left and bad times came,
the night fell in, till the sun shone again
no matter what was going on,
I could count on you forevermore!
With you I had my own refuge,
when clouds came up in front of the sun.
You helped me see that there is more,
and that I can reach it if I just want
Oh, these days are long gone by,
there is no more need to worry,
cause you live today.
All that's left from yesterday,
oh it frees my heart from sorrow
are my memories...
We were alone, lost in our minds!
Everyone had his own world,
desperatly looking for some way out!
Trying not to drown in hate,
love and war united sometimes,
our hearts broke into many pieces.
So when I look back at this time,
a golden line up in the sky,
or is it just a white one on my hand?
Many tears and many fallen stars,
still we are heading on our way,
together we will raise one day!
