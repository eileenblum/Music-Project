My dear friends, colleagues and brothers
enemies, opponents and all of you others.
I will tell you stories about love, forgiveness and hate,
about no tear filling my eyes and the story of Fate.
The story how I fell down right to the ground,
how I lost my belief until only blackness was around.
It's hard to regain all your lost power,
For this here truly is my darkest hour.
After all the falseness and all the lies
I know where the darkest corner of my soul lies.
I can't love myself so how I can love another?
Everything is gone, but yes my dear brother
after all the fights, the love and the strife
I welcome you to the theatre of my life.
