The Theatre of my life,
life is dancing, passing by in front of my eyes.
Theatre of my life,
like a shadow, from the past that I left behind
The Theatre of my life,
life is dancing, passing by in front of my eyes.
Theatre of my life,
like a shadow, from the past that I left behind
The Theatre of my life
life is dancing, passing by in front of my eyes...

So that was it, now you've heard my story.
Story of broken dreams and empty hopes.
Depression and dissolution was never before in my life
I stand that the shadow remains of what once was I.
Surrounded by the stench of lies and treason.
I walked through the valley of the shadows of death
and I fear no evil
Though I know... Thou hast forgotten me.
