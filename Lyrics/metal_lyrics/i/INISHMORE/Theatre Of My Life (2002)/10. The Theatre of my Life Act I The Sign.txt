Down on Skid Row,
where all the fallen people use to go,
a sign is hanging beside the street
saying something I can hardly read.
A beggar sitting next to it every day
and I am wondering what the sign could say.
I can't get this out of my mind
I can't resist anymore
now's the time I want to know!
I'm walking up to the board
ancient letters invite me to the show...

[Chorus]
It's a sign on the street
that is catching my sight
It will guide me into the night,
A sign on the street

Weather-beaten and decayed
A tombstone for those who have failed
Paying for this play I walk up to the door,
entering a new dimension as I have never seen before.
Overwhelmed by this 19th century entrance hall
a pale light of candles is shining from the wall
I walk into the theatre through a curtain,
on the other side everything seems so uncertain.
In the room hardly any light is near
and none of the audience realises that I'm here.

[Chorus]

The people in this hall so strange I'd love to run
Like creatures managing their lives in the shadow of the sun.
But something holds me back I can't let go,
as I hear the magic words "welcome to the show"
