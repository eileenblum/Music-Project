[Chris de Burgh cover]

Wake up boys, there's a light at the window,
I can hear someone knocking on the door,
There are voices in the street,
And the sound of running feet,
And they whisper the word - "Revolution!"

There are men coming down from the valleys,
There are tall ships lying off the coast,
And they carry the light,
In the dark of the night,
Like a whisper in the wind - "Revolution!"

Bring my gun and a handful of silver,
By the sea we will gather for the fight,
It's been so many years, so many tears,
We have lost once before,
Now we'll settle the score,
When our cannons will roar - "Revolution!"
