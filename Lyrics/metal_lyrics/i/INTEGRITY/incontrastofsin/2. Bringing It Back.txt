To a time when this was all mine
We fought for this land,
No one can say otherwise
Approached in fear, fled when we came near
You knew the boundaries, and you stood clear
Bringing
It
Back
Fists of truth
Bringing
It
Back
Wrapping that chain around their throats
What once was pure
Now plagued by your disease
My hate for weakness burns through me
And to the survivors lost in the shadows of our tree
This scene shall once again fall to its knees
Bringing
It
Back
Your misery
Bringing
It
Back
One life...
Drug free
Watching day after day I see this world destroying itself with hate
As you sink to the hell you belong in
Nothing left for you
Nothing left but...
Regret.
