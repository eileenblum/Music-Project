Evil lurking around every corner
Appearing adhering
In the doubt of my mind's eye
Doubt fills you up inside
Drown emotion...
Insanity
Never for you or with you
Only alone by myself
In my search for divinity
Is there no answers
Is there no end
All alone in my doubt
Living in contrast of sin
My walls surround me now
All greeting ignored
I put every once of energy
In who
I am
So much failure
I wish I could understand
You're alone in a world
You could never know
Full pain and suffering
Offered salvation
Doubting your faith
Has your life been one huge mistake
Can you make amends
Gotta save yourself before it's too late
Conflictions of morals
Take it out on others pain I gotta know,
I gotta believe
You wouldn't leave me
In contrast of sin
