Experimenting on the innocent
Destroying their lives
To cover up your worthless hide
I can feel the pain
My anger still remains I'll never let you...
Live it down
Rage of the souls
That you have devoured
Seers through my heart
To fuel my power...
Hate for humankind
How can you sleep at night
Knowing what you have done
In the passing of a day
How many innocent creatures must pay
For the luxury of your life?
I cannot see, refuse to believe, I won't stand for it anymore
In the name of humanity I beg you to open your eyes
And see the evil, the murder
You commit day after day
You may be able to live with yourself...
But can you deal with me?
