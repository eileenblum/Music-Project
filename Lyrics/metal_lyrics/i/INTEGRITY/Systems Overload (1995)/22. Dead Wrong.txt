What appeared to be so innocent
Just a front to cover up your lies
You had it all planned from the start
Their loss is your gain
You didn't think it over too clearly
Because you were...
Dead wrong
No avoiding what must be done
Fight to win fight to overcome
You have no choice of what you can do
Enjoy the pain as it seers through you
There will be no second chances,
No escape this time
Go ahead and run
There's no place you can hide
We'll hunt you down
So you know exactly
How your prey felt
Thought it was just a simple sport
In my eyes you're just a murderer
You don't kill for survival
You kill for cruelty
You went from being the hunter to being hunted
You are dead...
