Looking around on these streets
There's nothing left to do
Penance through your charities
Not it's turned on you

Demons looking in on me
Slipping through the cracks
Watching, starving, waiting
Timing their attack

Beyond the flesh that imprisons
Beyond the death you've envisioned
Beyond the fear you'll embrace
Giving your life a foul taste

System's overloading
Fear envelops me
Cry out for redemption
Blind, forgotten - seen

All the while fighting
Trying to get on top
Once the focus changes
All your senses...
Stop.
