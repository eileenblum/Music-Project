Chaos consumes all I see
Infecting everybody
Lost amidst confusion
Blocking out the screams

Asphyxiation, strangulation, delirium
Seasons have come and gone
We've been here all along

Absorbed from your realities
Identity slowly fade
Lured from any distinction
As she slowly melts away

When it's finally over you'll know what I mean
Your first mistake was replacing the screams
Wanted to make it weak just like yourself
Theres more to this than your pathetic control
You can't fight it no matter how hard you try
