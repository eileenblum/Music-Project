Slipped right through my fingers
Afraid to take control
Watched on from the sidelines
Every moment took it's toll
I can't forget, too much regret
It'll never escape my soul
Haunting me everyday
As I slowly fade away

Walking through your eyes one more time
I finally realize it has all gone away again.
