I can't get it out of my head
Just can't let it go
You were supposed to watch my back
But you helped me lose control

Kept my enemies way too close
And everything I hated so much
They brought me down too easily
But I still won't give it up

Fought my way back up from the bottom
My torment never ends
I'll do anything to keep myself straight
And one step ahead of my sins.
Redemption haunts me eternally
In my quest to be free
I've turned my back on everything that I was
In my search for divinity
