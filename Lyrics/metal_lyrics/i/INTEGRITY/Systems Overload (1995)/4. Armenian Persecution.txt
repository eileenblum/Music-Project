All I can think about is revenge
The slaughter inside my head never ends
And to all who deny this sin
Bab eed Janed cach-nem

Ethnic genocide
One million died
Cries went unheard in 1915
No one remembers, no one believes
Some turks deny, but they fucking lie

America knew, but as usual
They just stood by and listened to the cries
"Why interfere? There's no money here.
Who are the Armenians... who fucking cares if they're alive.
Who cares if they fucking survive."

Forced in the desert and into sandy graves
Children were murdered while their mothers were raped
Babies were thrown in the air and impaled on swords
Nothing but death from the turkish hordes

Dispersal took place
Most met a cruel end
Now we are few but we'll always be true
To the Armenians that we will defend

First they were bound, then split with an axe
They juggled their heads, and the turks laughed
Set on fire like a human torch
Many were nailed alive to the floor
