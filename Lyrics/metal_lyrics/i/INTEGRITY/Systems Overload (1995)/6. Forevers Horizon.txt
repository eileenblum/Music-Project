Empowered by the duality
Memories abruptly fade
Slipped behind salvation's dress
Time expires at half speed

Aiding in the destruction
Blind to your dreams intensity
While your existence, ceases to exist
It's too late to believe

Into oblivion's arms
All desires dissipate
Forevers horizon pulling me in
This wasn't supposed to be the way
I was never good enough for your society
And you never let me forget your contempt for my kind
Everyday you tried to keep me down
But now you've changed and want to start coming around
Past won't be forgotten!
