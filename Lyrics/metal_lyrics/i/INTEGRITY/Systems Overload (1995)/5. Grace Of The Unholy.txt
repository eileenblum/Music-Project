A cycle to repeat itself
No matter how you try to ignore
The first ages of innocence
Instilled since before you were born
Your worlds punishments fulfills all your wrongs
Pathetic flesh involved pawn
Arriving on a sea of red
The cycle continues on
Struggling to survive
Deceit
It's coming down
Out of societies bother
You won't make a sound

A new horror for every horizon
Away from all the obstacles you've seen
An end to elusive unknowns
Behind the curtain of your dreams

Beneath this flesh that constricts
Exists more freedom than insanity
To sink past the core of your soul
Escaping the shackles of humanity
Escape.
