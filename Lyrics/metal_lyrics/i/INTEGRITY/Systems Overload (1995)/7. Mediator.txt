Snared in it's path
Can't get away
I smolder
Each and every day
I won't forget the threats you made
It's closing in on me
Your rules don't apply to me I'm not gonna "talk it out"
I've heard it all before
Won't hear it again
Now I'm gonna make it end

Condemned me
Publicly
Can't back up a word you've said
You can't run, you can't hide
I'm gonna get my revenge

Can't keep me down
You never wanted me around
Hated me from the start
Now your words are tearing you apart
Brought it all on yourself
You're never gonna be safe
Should have thought it over better
Before you chose to mediate

Never forget, never forgive
Vengeance consumes my mind
It'll keep building up inside
For as long as I live
