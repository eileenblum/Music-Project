You talk and you fucking talk
Your bullshit never stops
Do you think anyone is afraid?
Of all the friends you've betrayed
Who's gonna back you up now?
Alone in your own little crowd
Thinking you're the one who's in control
Your stupid shit's getting so old
No one,
Your words mean nothing to me
And vengeance...
Cross me again and we'll see
You'll be the one to fucking pay!
