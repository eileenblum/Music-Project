Severed forever, I'm never getting up again
I've breathed in life - don't want this to ever end
Stolen glance and I can't to save the end of me
Temptation fills the house - sin of iniquities

Cast shadows walk into my light
All my soul consumed by pride
I've feared the heavens for far too long
Await this moment with open arms

Denied ascent, forbidden salvation
This blind contemp can't go unanswered
On my knees, I can't breathe
In this infernal damnation

Seasons in the size of days I wait
Confined by salvation's malevolence
To decide my fate
All alone, I call you near
You've shown compassion... and how sincere

Look at this place that I'm in
Blanketed by your prejudice, your fears, your ignorance

Still, in the corner I see them stalking me
They taste the cowardice in the air

Enhancing their hunger, they move in closer
Terror blinds, salvation's gratitude confines
I can almost feel the demon
