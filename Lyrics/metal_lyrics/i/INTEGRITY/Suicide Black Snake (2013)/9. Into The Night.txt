Haunt forever
Beneath slithering night
Sacrificial serpents arise
Draw the blood of ancient whores
Their foul whispers
Conjure the night

Sorrow dreams my death inside
Where we were, screamed alive
Into the night

Faded fingers strangling
Crimson visions... arise to bleed
Into the night

Buried eternal
Lost from your world
Plague, what you have made me became

I have always been here
I will always be here
We will bleed you dry
