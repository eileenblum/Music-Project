Horsehair trunk left on the side of the road
In the midst of our dissipation
We can't help but hunger for more
Blood crawled on from the fallen down

Black crosses burnt upon my skin
Midnight prayers cower alone
Exterminating with innocence
You wanna ride? we'll ride

Until the end of time
Southern soul devouring
Knives slithering through my mind
Left a beast moaning on the floor

Rewriting history in the
Black courts of God
Corroded visions of humanity

We breathe burnt in the shadows
Cremated glory of the broken abyss
Cold nightmares embrace
I know where everyone lives

All we had was the dream
Destroying the world
Serpent writhing in a holy cloth
God help us all, all is lost
