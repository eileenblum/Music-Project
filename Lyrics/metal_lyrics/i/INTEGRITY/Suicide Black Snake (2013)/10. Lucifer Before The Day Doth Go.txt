The Serpent lies within our hearts
Slowly tearing reality apart
Burned us into ourselves
Strangled us with their dead Gods

Lost again against our will
Imprisoned. Fire burns against
Worlds eternal sin
Only in death shall we know...
Love

Drink from the nightmares
Bleed again
Welcome the death that holds our glory
Welcome the knife that frees eternity

Live the serpent
Shed your skin
And live again
