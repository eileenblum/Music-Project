[performed by Integrity]We have betrayed the serpent. Blazing a path to glorious abandon.
Our blood spills itself to feed the forests of eternity
Annihilation is our salvation. Severed heavens
Flames of the immortal. Interned towards oblivion.
Breeding in the shadows, a lost paradox of treacherous love.
