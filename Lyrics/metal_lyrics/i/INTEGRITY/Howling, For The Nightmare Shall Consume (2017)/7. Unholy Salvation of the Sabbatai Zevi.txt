The clock strikes its final hour
Awaken in darkness
Our light is within sight
Beyond the veil, serpent shall rise
Redemption through inversion, blasphemous indulgence
He deceives the entire world, deforming religion
Replacing the sacred with the profane
Purification through transgression, holy within unholy
Redemption through inversion, blasphemous indulgence
He is viewed as a mirrored reflection of man
So are His intentions, reflected in reverse
Flesh prisons confine those creatures
Greater than what we could ever know
Unleash your true beauty with sin, release the fiend within
Burn this world to the ground
We are the Gospel. We are the End
Sheep shall remain on Earth... Cowering in flesh
Only we shall be released, through our most glorious death
Shedding the skin of the serpent we rise
Eternal like the Night
Infect the Scriptures
Inverted Convictions
