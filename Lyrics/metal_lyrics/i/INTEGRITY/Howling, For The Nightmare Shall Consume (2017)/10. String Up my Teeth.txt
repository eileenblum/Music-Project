We are the illusion
Syphon the night
Right out of your mind
Illuminated darkness
Salvation tangling its way back into focus
And we fight
Through the night
Where dreams turn on you
Cursed by suicidal laughter
Weaving a lace of fear
Into your heart
Religious silence
Descending sisters
Transform the unknown
Shivering sacrifice
Your hands brittle like the taste of swollen glass
Falling through the spiraling shadows
Into the glorious abyss
Only in our name
Shall we hold the hissing destruction
