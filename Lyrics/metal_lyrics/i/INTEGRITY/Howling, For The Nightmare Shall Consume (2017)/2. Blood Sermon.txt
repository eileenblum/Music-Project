The great reckoning is upon us
Phantoms of miracle and disease
Infest the flesh of Gods only living spell
Night screams herself into your dreams
We shall never remain pure
Awaken and ingest
The strength to strangle our past
Legions of murderous hordes
Hunt in waves of powerless ruin
Invoke the cataclysm and testify
Nameless apparition
Lies we held so precious
Invoke the cataclysm and testify
Cowering husk of flesh
Your prison decays around you
Promises forgotten
Behind landscapes of time
We shall lead astray
And rake in the thorns of broken Processions
