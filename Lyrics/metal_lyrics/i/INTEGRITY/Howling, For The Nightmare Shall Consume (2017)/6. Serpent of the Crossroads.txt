Forever in shadow, serpent slithers on
All the signs within your eyes
Where were you Tomorrow?
Flooding through another Hell
The night she held us cold
Crossroads whispers Tomorrow
Held my knife to the throat of God
The sound of chains rattling forward
Where we left ourselves behind
Those lost years, we were promised
Slipped away in the ghost of time
When the serpent offered salvation
In a world that has held us blind
With hellhounds I ride
Stripes have caged my back
Death has known me well
Imprisoned by this mortal flesh
This broken desperation, burning on inside my cross
I can never be free
Turn your eyes away, blind the darkness, let it all fade
