know the answers
that will deceive
blind faith
prophecy unleashed
now for fallen angels upon
burning desired
baptised in fire
lost in heavens final war
bleed beneath your dreams
a sea of flesh never blessed
destroyed evermore
deadly sin
seraphic storm
breaking your will
nothing to feel
cost too great of a cross
slither inside
silent prayer
never shared pleasure forever
