this is all we have
this is all we need
you better believe
there's something to die for
we don't need you
or your rules - this is ours
there's something to die for
we hear every word you say
don't turn your back no us
dive in the crowd
shout out load
this is our town
there's something to die for
black bandannas
black wrist-bands
this is our land
there's something to die for
we hear every word you say
don't turn your back on us
bringing back all the hate
we remember 88
jordans, construction gloves
violent dancing
in a scene we were proud of
ban us
from your fucking clubs
you can't stop us
