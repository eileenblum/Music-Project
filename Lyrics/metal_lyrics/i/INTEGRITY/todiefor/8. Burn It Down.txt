time has run out
I'm in hell - let me burn
your blood - the mirror
everything - seems clearer
your lies over ride everything
i can't believe a word you say
this is the last time i trust you
and i it's the last thing i ever do
I'm gonna make sure
you never forget this
I'm gonna make sure
you always regret this
look in my fucking eyes
and tell me to believe
don't you ever try
and pull that shit on me
grown cold my heart is black
there's no turning back
