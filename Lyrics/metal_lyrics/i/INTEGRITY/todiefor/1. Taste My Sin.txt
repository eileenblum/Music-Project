lies driven
incision
through the cross of forbidden man
eyes stricken
pure religion
carry on in the forgotten land
time can't release
everything that you see
fear as your days
turn to night
demons come to life
you could
never taste my sin
my sin - my sin
you could
never taste me sin
my sin - my sin

lies driven
incision
through the cross of
forbidden man
time has captured my life
to do what must be done
feel it breaking?
come on!
butchered - bleeding
swollen - seaping
a cross to great to bare
enslaved vision
betrayed religion
forsake all those
who believe - believe
breathes final gasp
