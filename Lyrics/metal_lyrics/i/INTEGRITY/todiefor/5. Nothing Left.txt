beaten down and battered
thought you'd count me out
weight of the world holding me back
this is the time we attack
when you least expect it
that's when we go
for the throat
can't kill us - dead inside
heard all your lies
times run out
nowhere to go
nowhere to hide
now we know
there's nothing left
beat us down
we get back up
we're just too stupid
we won't give up
all our lives
we've been trained to believe
there's something
better than this out there
just a bunch of fucking lies
