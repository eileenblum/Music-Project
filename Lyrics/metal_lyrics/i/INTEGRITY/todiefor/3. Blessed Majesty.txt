dreams forgotten
lives lost long before
angels final war
stolen innocence
kept within eternities
serene screams
shapeless shadowed forms
take flight upon
blackened wings
like a dream
final light
fallen grace
blanketed belief
all my life
I've loved you
now you betray me
loyal return deceived
the reek of human blood
brings laughter to my heart
taking back their love
with each one torn apart
blessed for eternity
final light
fallen grace
draped in deceit
all my life
I've betrayed you
now you love me
read the lie in believe
the reek of human blood
brings laughter to my heart
taking back their lust
with each one torn apart
cursed for eternity
tear pour oceans of blood
neglected vengeance
unleashed
reigning down from above
severed wings impaled
forever
left for dead
lights burn out
