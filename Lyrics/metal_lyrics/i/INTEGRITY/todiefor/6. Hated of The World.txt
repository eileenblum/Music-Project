everything went away
even i turned my back!
back to the glory
the way it was
the way it should be
feel it coming to its end
those days of parasites
days of loss
time to begin again
those days of fear
those days of hate
when the world
turned against us
(for the music that we made)
for the things that we said
we were hated
of the world
i see through smiles of my enemies
and i wait and watch their
weakness shine through
nothing will ever relieve
the hate you instilled in me
you'll never learn
let me burn
