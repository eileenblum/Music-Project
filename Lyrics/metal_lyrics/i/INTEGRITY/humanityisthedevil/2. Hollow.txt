Blind overwhelmed completion as your desires and atrocities
(come to pass) exposing your soul to weakness
all set deep beneath leaded glass

[chorus:]
Precious flesh and greed beyond your hopes
beyond your dreams
Hollow (curse)
fire in me
I can't feel
I can't breathe
Together externally boxed
in flesh entirely

Fulfillment of your pride self absorbed, never, ever satisfied
Visions of depth and confusion entangled with disturbance
and sin A time is called for atonement as this nightmare comes to an end.

[chorus]

In the blackened heart of all your fears circling around,
I invite the shadows near no longer contained by your evils outweighing the curse of humanity.
