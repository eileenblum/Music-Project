Each doorway exists opening new worlds
one is born to obey
another to destroy
everyone is turning
everything is circling
Lost on so many levels
carving out my way inhaled so much freedom
forgotten I'd escaped.
Everyone is turning
everything is circling
There is no reality
this is a mere dream
I can hear their footsteps coming closer.
Forgotten so many moments
Forgotten so many.
Time is my only cost time is my only loss
