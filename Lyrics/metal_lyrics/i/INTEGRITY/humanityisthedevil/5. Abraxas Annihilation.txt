The final seal has been broken apocalyptic visions
embrace eternity terror
to consume the species
all along you knew this time would come Abraxas,
annihilation between the heavens
The lamb and the goat have finally fused as one Waters asylum drowning out all the voices that plague your mind
the curse of untapped intelligence pushes you to the edge of sanity
repetitive wave continues
blinded past your soul Abraxas,
annihilation between the heavens
The lamb and the goat have finally fused as one fires heaven purifies
cleansing you of all your earthly sins beneath your bearing
of reality past temptations grasp as destiny comes to it's end
