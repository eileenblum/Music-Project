Welcoming delusions (and) contempt for everything that you've become blurred corruption
your hearing fades to a dull tone
your vision cannot bear
the sight of your own flesh eating away at all your cancer
until there's nothing left everyday,
anyway to relieve your system of the disease getting it away
from your own deceit retribution,
the only solution carrying beyond salvation's grace
tested against time and reason
never face the result of your dreams
routine dreaming you wake up screaming
never a night goes by where I don't realize the trap you set for me
discrete impositions of cynical self abuse
never a mind more jaded
existing only by the skirts of their truth
brought me into your derelict
world delusions of gratitude and gain for all
we had to offer and still we end up this side of the blame
