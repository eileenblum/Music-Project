For as long as times existence
I've struggled with my own persistence blanketed
by deceit and willing stalking your young
as you kept on breeding filth upon filth
it never ends annihilation,
humanities only escape angels surrounding another victim
(as it all begins to fade)
Warfare consisting of frequencies
unbearable to your nervous system
existing far beyond your won intentions
and still you can't see the power
