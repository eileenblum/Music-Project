Among the wolves Flesh drenched in blood Fingers broken Swallowed darkness Carried alone Death Rattles Break the air Immortal torment Burdens despair Vexed Reflection Burning it's own way out Learning to love the lie Unveiling Flames of heaven Under a watchful eye Blinded betwixt Forgotten days of whispers Drowning inside my mind Broken words of resistance Learning to love the lie As the lies are unwound And hell is forgotten We bleed alone beneath the stars Barren light pours out our eyes We finally see the breathing dawn Through the shadows of forever We will return again...
