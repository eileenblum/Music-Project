Forever?!? Don't be fooled my friend There is no forever in life This was something you never had a choice in deciding Something created by powers That cannot be governed by any of mans rule For all things have a beginning and end And your cycle's end was complete When the crowns of sin conquered the weapons of salvation The only ones who get a forever are those that can Manipulate time and not let it dictate to them Only those who forsake life And embrace the unknown death that Awaits us will know forever So come my friend deny a lifetime of Waiting for something that will not come Take control of a real forever Take hold of the end Before it takes hold of you Escape the prison of your life And enter the eternity of death Take hold of forever
