For falling centuries Haunting in the shadows Night has gnawed her teeth Against the throat of the seasons Invoking the serpent to awaken Swallow humanity whole Freeing the binds placed upon them Eternity passing glance The judgement and deliverence Lost for aeons Wandering blind Long forgotten histories mist Brushed against familiar scents Stirred by echoes through blood memory Eternally coiling serpent deliver us from this torment Awaken Until the lingering madness drags Us so far beneath your prayers That even darkness keeps her promise
