Fade away Into another dismal wake Lost and alone In forevers torment We return the hunger Through the shadows of forever Unhinged will From their cold staring hearts Knife as the blessing The cross untwines Tearing reality apart Mind shattered thoughts Across the black divide Held divinity Through This body We fell toward the sky Through the shadows of forever Unhinged will From their cold staring hearts Knife as the blessing The cross untwines Tearing reality apart The unknown listening war Fall toward the sky Drape the night around The shattered shoulders Of glorious deception And believe in the end
