Twilight of the idols Rise forth confused effect Cause holds us never In her golden depths Doppleganger Destroying it's own reflection The essence of eternal difference Malformed perception Of mindless Reproduction Imagination Controls reality The doors of realization have Been kicked open it's own eternity Signs of it's existence That which conceals the truth Is the truth concealed That there is nothing Left to reveal? We are not here We are not real Subjected illusion The world, at last, has formed in myth Resemblance to difference Oppositions Friction Burning holes in times disdain Breeding an even greater creation Against the nights unknown
