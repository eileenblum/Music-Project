Hear the long voices Well up beneath the clouded Abyss of the mind Cold flames of awakening Darkened sunlight Burning symbols long forgotten Against our skin Eyes open The patterns welcome our past Tearing our soul home Solitude and servitude The moment of realization We must begin again It's already too late Hide the children Deep within your imagination Never let on that we are here Spirals of light seasons disguise Fragmented symbols Depictions of our past Unwelcome, forgotten Ascend the uncertain of the Wealth of light The dawn holds secrets for us all We can never fall
