Assorted black sadism The beginning of the new mankind The elimination of forgiveness The realization of our ancestral rites We are not the civilized worm That they have chained us to become Sinister lunacy Overwhelming joy in the fallen Raise up the sword again and again With every welcomed intention Awaken the senses Humans hold only amusement Their slow unimaginative demise The whip cracks a smile Upon bitter open flesh Wine forgotten pleasures Of unholy despair Arising in the boiling blood Of our sadistic passions Calmer waters know no boundary The chain around their throats Carry them to their well deserved fate Never forget we are not like them They must always be Crushed under heel I hold them not sacred
