They held us so close Lost concept of humanity We can never breath again The veil was placed Within our minds Spreading perception binding lies Resurrections death on The branches of eternal hell Damned, abandoned while Re-dreaming the end A wakened state cowers Before loves forever museum Of the inoculated deception With the tortured pacing of hyenas Engines of iniquity tower overhead This world shall always end It has always come this end We shall hold you In fearful comfort As the walls of reality dissolve From your viral existence Diseased awareness Hiding within the sharp angels Of sabered fulfillment Deliver my soul from This stark held flesh Allow my promise to soar Beyond heavens and telomeres confines Shouting against broken insects Disguised as prophecy The moons oracle silhouettes and Swallows fast the shadows of our escape Salvation, decimation, extinction Crawling blind toward the elusive exit Exalted seeds of war Pillage and release the horror of Majestic consummation Glorify the great destruction The days of obedience Have long folded inward Revel in the defiant return Of ancient cataclysm Drain their power over yours Unconscious undress fawning Uncomfortable eye contact We are not longer dormant slaves Humanitys heart shall decay and Wield the key to unlock Every desirable devastation Escaping the heretical blood Has saturated our world Long stolen history lies locked away In cancerous vaults I am empty, drained of division Flanked by teeth bared degradation Shattered victims of Histories final holocaust Turn our weapon toward the south Bestial boundaries illuminate Their darkness Unwind their deceptive violence Ride forth my blackened beasts Ride forth into the conquered flames May blood soaked banners smolder to Silken ash as we are delivered From humanitys blackest curse We shall unleash an avalanche of fire Upon humanitys incarcerated corpse Scorched earth choking out Lifes final death throes Rising in a swirl of crushed awareness Beneath a hooven claw Every cross in its place Every sword stained itself pure Darkness has kept her promise Only in death shall we know love
