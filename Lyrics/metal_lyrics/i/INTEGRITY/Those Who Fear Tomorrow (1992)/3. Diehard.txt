That last moment
Valued at a hundred words
A crystal clear picture was painted
And when I looked into your eyes
The pain I saw, such horror inside

I can't believe what I did to you
I can't live with the memories
Now I'm left all alone
Now that you're gone
I can't go on
Trial of humanity
Going on inside of me
And the verdict...
Will be the death of me
Now I'm left, the shell of a broken man
With nothing left but regret
I let them take you away
All I did was watch
Those times we shared
Those memories
I'll always die hard, Sable
