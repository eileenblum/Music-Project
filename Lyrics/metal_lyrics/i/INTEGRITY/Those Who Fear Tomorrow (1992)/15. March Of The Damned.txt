Starving to Death
Yet you keep walking on
Marching to the end of all existence
Nothing will ever reach you again
Fell victim to the innocent
Scar of a woman
Destroyed your very soul
God spare us all
Don't try to get out
You'll never escape
Locked behind the walls
Inside the prison's gate
Not a chance in hell
Of getting out with your life
What's the point of marching
When you know you're gonna die

Dear father in heaven...
Take me back
