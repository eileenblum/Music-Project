Rotting stench of my corroding remains
I'll never be the same
Distribution, disillusioned
I gotta lean to balance out the pain
Separation of state and mind
I cannot, I will not die
Locked away inside my mind
I am guilty, I am the crime
You gotta let me out
You gotta help me survive
In this world of pain
Icepick through the face
Bloodsoaked existence
Don't get in my way
A chain is only
As strong as it's weakest link
Flesh so durable
My razor is my only release
As your blood pours you inside out
