No name is legion
The son of a demon
Brought up form the depths of hell
The changing lamb
Turns to sand
Glorious renewal of war

Dawn Of A New Apocalypse, this is the end

Clenched fist
To the man in the sky
I stand alone again
At childhood's end
Locked away, locked inside
Kept from reality
Blind to reasons why

Dawn Of A New Apocalypse, this is the end

Ghetto stricken, filth ridden
Mother of mine
I'd give my left arm
Just to witness your demise
You brought me into this world
I'll be the one to take you out
So now you wonder what's wrong with me
Taking your life
