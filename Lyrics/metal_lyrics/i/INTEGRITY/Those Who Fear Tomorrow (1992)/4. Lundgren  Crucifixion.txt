Reflections shifted, masochistic
A glow of light up the room
New crowned beauty
Christian duty
Plotting to escape
Forever doomed
Neck restrained daughter
Endless slaughter
Hooked lung, stolen breath, cunt
Passion thickens
Pleasures forbidden
Avery's not one left

Every time world savior shows
Persecuting soon follows
Crucifixion lets the blood expand
Genetalia nothing less
Than a man to understand
Duty of this Christ
Frees forever beyond the light
When worn separate, reality blends
Past the mere flesh
Of barbed artery
How then heated abstinence
Free's the spine
Unleashing no minds

Stone cold bitter razor grew
Growing inside
Extinguish the fluids
Beneath this fire
Sudden restraint
Soften beauty known virginity

A time has shown seraphic streams
Pollute those close to copulation
Try to expand
Discourse the image
Running through class forms
Forbidden
