A challenge I can't ignore
My chance for a fight
To have my moment in the glory
This is the price I must pay everyday
A day in my life
You ask what gives me the right to judge you
I'll tear you limb from limb
Break you piece by piece
Put you in a state
Where it takes all you got to breathe
Thrill to your suffering
As you cry out in agony
Nothing could please me more
I am your maker
I am everything that you know
Have you at my mercy
And I am going to kill you slow
The harder they come...
The harder they fall
