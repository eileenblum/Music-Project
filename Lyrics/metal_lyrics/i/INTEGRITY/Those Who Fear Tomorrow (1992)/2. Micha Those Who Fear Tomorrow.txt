You can take a man
Free him from no garbage can
No one can ever see
No one can ever escape
You are going to...
You will feel the wrath
As you fear tomorrow

I'm gonna take you down
When I can, in and out
Nothing can save your misery
Don't know shit about me
Don't know anything
Sink to the bottom
All hell breaking loose
Feel the wrath
One time in your life
Cutting like a knife
Feel the wrath
As you fear tomorrow

There is nothing
Left for you now
You think you have it all
Don't have anything
One time in your life
Fear the knife
Fear the wrath
You motherfuckers
