"Gaze into my eyes and see the end of a time an age of disease
Spawn of the damned filling the seas with the blood of man
An iron fist reigning over a helpless land" (Ben Falgoust)

His life will be created for the purpose of death
Rotting soul entombed in rotting flesh
Tortured sadist setting free his mind
Start the beginning of the end of time
An empire conceived through his heart bereft
Of mercy lost within his twisted depths now fucking die

Through your eyes the future I have seen
But first your body sour soul must leave
I take your life to plant the future seed
I thirst for knowledge the power I need
The future is shown to me but for a brief time
I need to know more to illuminate my mind
But for this truth I must destroy to see
A slave to my dark shadow you will forever be
Forever be

Man on a pilgrimage to the final place of
Rest condemned to burn to ashes
Calling us to join the flame the dead consume the dead
Oracle show me the truth when life shall fall from this plane
Immortal demon spawn tell me when hell shall reign

Armageddon is born

His life will be created for the purpose of death
Rotting soul entombed in rotting flesh
Tortured sadist setting free his mind
Start the beginning of the end of time
An empire conceived through his heart bereft
Of mercy lost within his twisted depths
Now fucking die

Through your eyes the future I have seen
But first your body sour soul must leave
I take your life to plant the future seed
I thirst for knowledge the power I need
The future is shown to me but for a brief time
I need to know more to illuminate my mind
But for this truth I must destroy to see
A slave to my dark shadow you will forever be
