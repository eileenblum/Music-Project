March of death echoes to the rhythm of the guns
Towering clouds of human ashes blacken out the sun
Emaciated bones and flesh marching to their graves
Purge this world with spoiled blood no one will be
Depopulate regulate systematically exterminate

Round up the diseased for slaughtering
A crematorial funeral an offering
Holding on to life a futile dream
No need for pain or suffering
Salvation is survival a final ambition
Unveiled in the form of annihilation

Rat infested trenches filled with casualties of war
Christened by the blood of those who fought before
Wading through the bodies on the hallowed ground
If you listen closely you can hear the sounds of
Death
Arise, arise
Feast on the flesh of the dead

March of death echoes to the rhythm of the guns
Towering clouds of human ashes blacken out the sun
Emaciated bones and flesh marching to their graves
Purge this world with spoiled blood no one will be
Depopulate regulate systematically exterminate

March of death

Engulfed as the earth opens wide a colossal inferno bringing demise
Hungry and starving prey on the meek tear at the flesh of the dying and meek
The living and dead feast for control half eaten corpses unburied exhumed
Prophecies of an oracle's mind crazed demented seer of time

Arise, arise
Feast on the flesh of the dead

Rat infested trenches filled with casualties of war
Christened by the blood of those who fought before
Wading through the bodies on the hallowed ground
If you listen closely you can hear the sounds of

March of death echoes to the rhythm of the guns
Towering clouds of human ashes blacken out the sun
Emaciated bones and flesh marching to their graves
Purge this world with spoiled blood no one will be
Depopulate regulate systematically exterminate
