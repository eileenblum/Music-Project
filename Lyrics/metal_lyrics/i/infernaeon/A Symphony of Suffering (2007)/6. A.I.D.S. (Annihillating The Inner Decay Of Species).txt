Infecting the mind of the diseased to bring forth the end that the oracle forsees
Destroying their lives a chaotic release
A brand new holocaust burning the deceased
Collect the dead for a morbid feast
Feed the flames until the goal is reached
An ageless grudge against the living
His plan for the end times commence the killing

The diseased kill the diseased
Friend becomes foe
Decay of species
Beyond their control
Wretched creature
In angelic disguise
Takes over their minds
To begin their demise
As his plan begins
To unfold
His demonic vices
Quickly take hold
Crippling their bodies
Tainted within
His demented creations
Struggle to win

Ravenous lust for infected flesh
Eating intestines ripping at chests
Devour the hearts of those left living
A cannibalistic rage of death
Unforgiving

Human remnants litter the earth
Corpses of children slaughtered at birth
Butchered bodies spoiled minds
Give way to creations of death's design

Skinless bodies torn apart
Severed at the waist
From the scattered pieces grows
His malignant moribund race
Breathing in the stench of death
They slowly make their way
Bringing an end to prophecy
Devouring what they crave
