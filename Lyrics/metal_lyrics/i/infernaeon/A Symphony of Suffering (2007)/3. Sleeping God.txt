I awaken from 10,000 years of pain
I am ancient I am he who has no name

Now my time has come

Reteaching the ways of treachery
Redefining the meaning of misery
Paint a portrait with your pain

I'm the father of the seven ancient ones
I am rapture
Conviction unto Jehovah
I am malice exalt my throne unto what is mine
I am murder bathe in the blood of holy swine

I am your blood on the wall

Suumarian texts never meant to be written

In the absence of light
I have dwelled for aeons

Now I awake to a right handed plague
Rise like the phoenix from the ashes of a dying race
I created the sun, moon and stars
Now all that is left is a cacophany of scars
I vow with a black heart and soul
Never to forgive
His precious flock of sheep are slaughtered
With no eternal life to live

I have become death itself

Older than the stars themselves
Waging war on god himself
I have slept for 10,000 years
Our fight begins right now right here
I will reclaim what is mine will you fight or will you die
I am vengeance masked with pride
You cannot kill what cannot die
