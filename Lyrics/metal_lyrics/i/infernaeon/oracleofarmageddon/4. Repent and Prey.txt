[Chorus:]
Repent and prey, youâre a sinner my child
Listen, obey, discriminate, defile
To the father, the son, the holy ghost
Loved by some, hated by most

Nailed to a cross for the sake of Christianity
Youâll burn in the fire, along with all humanity

Drink of my blood
Partake in my body
Become the Lie

[Chorus:]
Repent and prey, youâre a sinner my child
Listen, obey, discriminate, defile
To the father, the son, the holy ghost
Loved by some, hated by most

Holy grail of the lamb, the carpenterâs cup
Filled with the malice of generations of man
From corruption and greed grew manâs affinity
To hate and loath those different from themselves

Forced into the flames of hell
Forced to die for the good of man
Forced to leave it all behind
Forced to be the slaughtered lamb

The spawn of the damned he stands on high,
Watching empires burn, watching mother earth die

Hell no longer imagination but now a reality
Where is your god now, as you die on your knees

[Chorus:]
Repent and prey, youâre a sinner my child
Listen, obey, discriminate, defile
To the father, the son, the holy ghost
Loved by some, hated by most
