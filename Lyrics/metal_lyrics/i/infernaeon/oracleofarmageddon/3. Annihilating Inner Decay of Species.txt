[Chorus:]
Infecting the mind of the diseased
To bring forth the end that the oracle foresees
Destroying their lives, a chaotic release
A brand new holocaust, burning the deceased
Collect the dead, for a morbid feast
Feed the flames, until the goal is reached
An ageless grudge against the living
His plan for the end times, commence the killing

The diseased kill the diseased
Friend becomes foe
Decay of species
Beyond their control
Wretched creature
In angelic disguise
Takes over their minds
To begin their demise
As his plan begins
To unfold
His demonic vices
Quickly take hold
Crippling their bodies
Tainted within
His demented creations
Struggle to win

Ravenous lust for infected flesh
Eating intestines, ripping at chests
Devouring the hearts of those left living
A cannibalistic rage of death, unforgiving

Human remnants litter the earth
Corpses of children, slaughtered at birth
Butchered bodies, spoiled minds
Give way to creations of deathâs design

[Chorus:]
Infecting the mind of the diseased
To bring forth the end that the oracle foresees
Destroying their lives, a chaotic release
A brand new holocaust, burning the deceased
Collect the dead, for a morbid feast
Feed the flames, until the goal is reached
An ageless grudge against the living
His plan for the end times, commence the killing

The diseased kill the diseased
Friend becomes foe
Decay of species
Beyond their control
Wretched creature
In angelic disguise
Takes over their minds
To begin their demise
As his plan begins
To unfold
His demonic vices
Quickly take hold
Crippling their bodies
Tainted within
His demented creations
Struggle to win

Skinless bodies torn apart, severed at the waist
From the scattered pieces grows his malignant moribund race
Breathing in the stench of death they slowly make their way
Bringing an end to the prophecy, devouring what they crave
