[Chorus:]
The march of death echoes to the rhythm of the  guns
Towering clouds of human ashes blacken out the sun
Emaciated bones and flesh, walking to their graves
Purge the earth for spoiled blood, no one will be saved
Depopulate, regulate, systematically exterminate!

Round up the diseased for slaughtering
A crematorial funeral, an offering
Holding on to life, a futile dream
No need for pain, or suffering
Salvation is survival, a false ambition
Unveiled in the form of annihilation

Rat infested trenches filled with the casualties of war
Christened by the blood of those who fought before
Wade through the bodies on hallowed ground
If you listen closely you can hear the sound of Death

Arise
Feast on the flesh of the dead

[Chorus:]
The march of death echoes to the rhythm of the guns
Towering clouds of human ashes blacken out the sun
Emaciated bones and flesh, walking to their graves
Purge the earth for spoiled blood, no one will be saved
Depopulate, regulate, systematically exterminate!

March of death

Engulfed, as the earth opens wide, a colossal inferno bringing demise
Hungry and starving, prey on the weak, tear at the flesh of the dying and meek
The living and the dead, feast for control, half eaten corpses unburied, exhumed
Prophecies, of an oracleâs mind, crazed demented, seer of time

Arise
Feast on the flesh of the dead

The living have died, the dead have risen
Ruled by the spawn of the damned
Extinction of a species called man
Leaving this mordant and barren wasteland

Rat infested trenches filled with the casualties of war
Christened by the blood of those who fought before
Wade through the bodies on hallowed ground
If you listen closely you can hear the sound of Death

[Chorus:]
The march of death echoes to the rhythm of the guns
Towering clouds of human ashes blacken out the sun
Emaciated bones and flesh, walking to their graves
Purge the earth for spoiled blood, no one will be saved
Depopulate, regulate, systematically exterminate!
