Never been easy, trying to find the
Answers to what you seek
Painful, memories, try to reason,
To find the bloody truth
You can't hide away and there's nowhere
Left that you can run today

Justice, the fatal choice, you've chosen well
As I knew that you would
Walk now, along with us, we unite against
Those who face us

We are who we are,
Find a cause worth fighting for.
We fight...for one man's word
Ideals are born to us.
A state of mind endorsed by us.
We live, for one man's word

So now you know, you can stand tall
The mirror never lies after all.
A hero, a heart cast of stone.
1000 fighters ensure you're not alone

One man's word. One man's word
We are who we are.
