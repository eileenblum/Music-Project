Were you the non believer
Who's summoning beckoned me
Sucked in by the great deceiver
Darkest mind games set me free
I walk only with mighty
Mighty is what we will be
Raise your eyes to the heavens
I'll burn the air that you breathe

I am the elemental
See me and you'll scream
I am the elemental.
I'm in your darkest dreams

We once existed together
It was a unity set to fail
2 worlds living as one
Further enhanced your shame
Unburden yourself of honour
This is alien to you
We live, we breathe, we prosper
The mirror image, reflecting back at you

I am the elemental
See me and you'll scream
I am the elemental.
I'm in your darkest dreams

He is elemental
Long live elemental

I am the elemental
See me and you'll scream
I am the elemental.
I'm in your darkest dreams
