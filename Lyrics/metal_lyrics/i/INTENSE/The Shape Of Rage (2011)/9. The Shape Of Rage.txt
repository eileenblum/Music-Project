You - the poison seeping through my veins
Try to force-feed me your lies
Twisting words distort the truth
To one I hardly recognise
A doctrine of no second chance
Deceive me once then more fool you
These things that you think make you strong
Could be the last you ever do

I want to break out
Free of this flesh-bound cage
Externalise my anger
Show you the shape of rage

You - who live in foolish ignorance
Know not the fire within this heart
I - the bringer of the coming storm
Am set to tear your world apart
A portal to my darkest thoughts
Through which this energy will flow
As is within, so is without
The changing flesh begins to show

I want to break out
Free of this flesh-bound cage
Externalise my anger
Show you the shape of rage
Psychotic takedown
On you I turn the page
Erase all that you stand for
Consumed by shape of rage

Feel it crawl beneath my skin
Let the synthesis begin
From my flesh it's given form
So this child of rage is born

Now - the fury burning at my core
A vengeance sentient and pure
Those - who stood before me stand no more
Tormented fall they shall endure
Wherever flee my enemies
The shape of rage shall hunt them down
No hiding place and no remorse
They shall be crushed into the ground

I want to break out
Free of this flesh-bound cage
Externalise my anger
Show you the shape of rage

Shape of rage
Shape of rage
