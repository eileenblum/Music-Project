Stars scorch a broken sky
As the night starts to fall
The older gods they embrace me
It's my purpose, I can't withdraw

Since ancient times
All souls are mine

Walk the path I show you
Don't falter at any step
Anubis soul conductor
I am protector of the dead

A shock, your spirit moved on
Now judgement waits for you
All alone, lost in the darkness
Hear my voice and know it's truth

Don't waste your cries
Too late to deny

Walk the path I show you
Don't falter at any step
Anubis soul conductor
I am protector of the dead
