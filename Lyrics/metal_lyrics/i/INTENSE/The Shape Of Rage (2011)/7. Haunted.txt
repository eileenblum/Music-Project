I feel a presence ever close to me,
And still they don't seem to want to speak
I freeze, feel a chill through my body
Believe, my minds broken and confused

Awaken as I'm haunted
And my mind begins to scream
I'm shaken as I'm haunted,
Why won't they leave me be

Unclear, what they want from me,
And still, they move ever closer
I feel, movement all around me
No speech, only voices in my head

Awaken as I'm haunted
And my mind begins to scream
Devastated as I'm haunted,
Why won't they leave me be

My cell is padded to comfort me,
Unwell... apparently mentally unstable
My friends, still are visiting me
Am I dead, or pushed over the edge

Awaken as I'm haunted
And my mind begins to scream
I'm shaken as I'm haunted,
Why won't they leave me be

Welcome to my nightmares,
Is this the end of me
This haunting is killing me
And now I believe...
