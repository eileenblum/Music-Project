I thought I'd escaped your attentions
One look from you and I fall
Now you're back to tease my frustrations
My broken mind answers your call

Please leave me be... forget about me we're history

Save me from myself... now I know
I need you to be the friend I can't be to me, slow down
Unlike anyone else, now you know
I need you to save me

Forgotten memories return to me
As a single tear begins its fall
You are the mistress of all cruelty
You take pleasure seeing me torn

Please leave me be... Forget about me we're history

Save me from myself... now I know
I need you to be the friend
I can't be to me, slow down
Unlike anyone else, now you know
I need you to save me

Save me from myself, save me from myself, save me

I know you're a vixen
You knew what you meant to me
You feed off my addiction
A poison fuelled black alchemy

Please leave me be... forget about me we're history
