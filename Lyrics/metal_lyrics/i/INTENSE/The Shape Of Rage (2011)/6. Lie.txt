As I walk in the room, amusingly...
You all turn to silence
I sense anger in the air, animosity,
Potential for violence

The warm welcome falls short, chillingly,
Determination flows through me
If conflict's what you seek,
I won't turn the other cheek,
I'll take you on

Always rallying support, innocently, pleading the victim
Twisting my words to suit, deceitfully,
Your shame has no limits

Won't play the game, to save your pride
You couldn't change and lived a lie
Oh the shame, inbred your life, you're whose to blame
You lived a lie

See the writing on the wall, obviously
You're losing the battle
Sense just cannot prevail, inside of you
Darkness conquers all

Won't play the game, to save your pride
You couldn't change and lived a lie
Oh the shame, inbred your life, you're whose to blame
You lived a lie
