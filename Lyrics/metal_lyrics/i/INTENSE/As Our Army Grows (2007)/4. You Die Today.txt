Purify your thoughts, from the dreams that poison your mind
Let In the light and chase away the shadows of negativity

This is your holy war avoiding the hand of fate
Once touched it will be too late

Everything feels wrong, the smiling stranger watches silently
It carries on, you can't hide from what has been pre-destined

This is your holy war avoiding the hand of fate
Once touched it will be too late
And if you're touched
You die today
And if he catches you
You die today

The hunter seeks you out
He relies on your emotions

And if you're touched
You die today
If he catches you
You die today
It's the the end of your world
You die today
You can't escape your fate
You die today
You die today
