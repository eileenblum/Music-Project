Enter, after, planning, tonight's activities
Focus, protection, a shielding, placed defensively

Fear is Not Enough
Fear is Not Enough (of an excuse)

Clearly, feeling, indifference, in my vicinity
Ice cold, shivers, warnings, whisper threats to me

Fear is Not Enough
Fear is Not Enough (of an excuse)

Psychological games as realities grip begins to tear
Can you hear the words, travel to your mind, from out of nowhere
From out of nowhere

Anger, Confusion, torment, betray emotions to me
journey to peace now, I can, help you to proceed

Fear is Not Enough
Fear is Not Enough (of an excuse)
Fear is Not Enough
Fear is Not Enough (not to hunt you)
