Where I've come to I can't see
Lost my sense of true reality
Actions of my hand are not my will
Other consciences are ruling me

Learn to live in this strange new world
Can't tell my waking life from dreams
Lost alone in this strange new world
Where nothing's ever as it seems

No control of flesh and mind
Thought and action intertwined
Programmed ideology
Living pre-recorded destiny

Cast adrift in this strange new world
I Cannot tell the truth from lies
Trusting none in this strange new world
I Cannot even trust my eyes

Can I find the way through
To the one who'll guide me
Change the program, set me free
Will I find the strength to
Fight the hand that leads me
Define my own reality

Learn to live in this strange new world
Can't tell my waking life from dreams
Lost alone in this strange new world
Where nothing's ever as it seems
Find the path through this strange new world
To see the prophet's will be done
Never fall in this strange new world
I am the word and I live on
