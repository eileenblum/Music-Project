Now god wields a new surprise
Thrown upon this earth in order to make the difference
Destined to become the saviour
Diffuse our destruction in Heaven and on Earth

I stand with you Danyael , I won't see us fail
We stand with you Danyael, we will prevail

Will you Follow
As our army grows
You are, Our Last Hope
Now Heavens torn
Engaged Mankind in War
We are, Our Last Hope

Clouded vision hides their destiny
Lucifer's smile at this Angelic cacophony

We stand with you Danyael, we will prevail

Will you Follow
As our army grows
You are, Our Last Hope
Now Heavens torn
Engaged Mankind in War
We are, Our Last Hope

Danyaeal you fight for all mortal kind
Your energy will burn the Seraphim's desire
Born of Earth and Heaven, Nephilim Saviour
Defeat the enemy with Gabriels, Whisper ..

Pyriel waits for you, your fate is in his hand
Holy Battle flares brighter than ever
for the future of our world
Strike the final decisive blow

Will you follow...
