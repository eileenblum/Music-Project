Never give into
Those who will tempt you
They'll lead you down a dead end street
Never turn away
From the light of the day
You'll meet your monsters In a dream 

She'll take you down
With her crystal mind
Challenge her and
She'll make you shine
She's way too strong
For you to fight
Take you down 
With her crystal mind 

Choose which side you want
If it's right or wrong
There'll never be a middle ground
If you pose a threat 
Then you should expect
Her to bring you down 

She'll take you down
With her crystal mind
Challenge her and
She'll make you shine
She's way too strong
For you to fight
Take you down 
With her crystal mind
