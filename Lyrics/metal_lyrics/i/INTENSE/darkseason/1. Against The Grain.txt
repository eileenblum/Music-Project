You spend your whole life battling
Colouring in their black and white
Ignore all their past glances
Results gained from tired lives
They see you so differently
Than you really are
They see a picture
Distorted by our media 

You need it and you breathe it
You feel it twist inside
So hold on for so long
And it grows on in your mind 

While your life heads that way
You're going against the grain
So just take the pain
Going against the grain
Sometimes you might feel you're dying
Going against the grain
They won't see the tears you cry
Going against the grain
