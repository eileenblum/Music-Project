Do you still remember me?
Realize what you've taken
Try to bring us down 
But we won't break
No sign of final reprieve
Money making schemes the music's tragedy
If you cut us
Do we not bleed? 

Deny
Betrayed once more
Deny 

Who owns the voices in your mind?
Turn the corner and once again you're blind
You line your pockets
But that won't open your eyes
Behind the desk you think you're god
Corrupted power you got the lot
You'll have your day
Then you'll be gone 

Deny 
Betrayed once more
Deny
We'll even the score
