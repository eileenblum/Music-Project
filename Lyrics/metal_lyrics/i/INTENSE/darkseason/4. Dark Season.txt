Is this now the stage you need
For you to wage your war whore
You've been cast out by your god
Who no longer cares at all 

Is this what feeds you
Seeing us fighting for air
Into dark season
Threads of humanity you tear 

Pretence is, one of the weapons 
By which you choose to fight
Prophecies of the fallen angels
Now finally come to light 

Is this what feeds you 
Seeing us fighting for air
Into dark season
Threads of humanity you tear 

So your jealousy
Drove you on
Your values confused
Between right or wrong 

Is this what feeds you 
Seeing us fighting for air
Into dark season
Threads of humanity you tear

Is this what feeds you 
Seeing us fighting for air
Into dark season
Threads of humanity you tear
