I've seen you looking
As you walk around the room
Your smile entices
You've tempted me too soon 

It's all that you want
It's all that you need::..Greed 

I still can't forgive
What you took away from me
You took my blood my life
And that's corrupted me 

All that you want
All that you need
You'll do about anything 
Just to satisfy your greed 

All that you want
All that you need
You'll do about anything
Just to satisfy your greed
