A godless soul without a hope
Betrayed a man the people loved
I was not alone in my doubt
So I betrayed and cast him out 

No remorse floods over me
As I see his blood run freely
I knew the tale would pass through the years
As weakened people embraced their fears 

Do I stop to explain it all
Or let them carry on their foolish cause
I started this so it lays with me
The unwilling founder of Christianity 

The seeds of betrayal
The seeds of betrayal rest with me
The seeds of betrayal
The seeds of betrayal are because of me 

Now I feel the power in me
For all eternity
You believed what I had said
It will be your death
A Christian nation now will arise
Born through my lies
What will your people have to say
When they find out your mistake 

The seeds of betrayal
The seeds of betrayal rest with me
The seeds of betrayal
The seeds of betrayal are because of me 

The power of conviction will guide you
And blind you from the truth
Will I cry for the victim of my hand
He served a purpose
Some say prophet, others say guide
I am neither
I had a man empty his veins
Whilst myself I am entertained 

The seeds of betrayal
The seeds of betrayal rest with me
The seeds of betrayal
The seeds of betrayal are because of me
