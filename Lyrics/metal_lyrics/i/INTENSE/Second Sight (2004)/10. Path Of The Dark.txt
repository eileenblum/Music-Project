Flames burn deep within your eyes
Destiny calls you to decision time
The one power do you control
Choose now before your senses fold
Since your birth they've await
Search the skies; one star seals your fate
Their priority is only you
Remember only your heart holds the truth 

Will you go to the dark one
Fatal choice to decide on 

What do the strange whispers mean?
Two sides bid to extremes
Will you be a blessed child of the light?
Or follow darkness into the cursed night 

Will you go to the dark one
Fatal choice now your life's gone 

Don't take the path of the dark
You won't make it through the night
Though you claim second sight
Don't take the path of the dark 

Thus continues the eternal war
Reminiscent memories of what went before
You have the power to save us all
And end the dominion of all of Satan's hordes 

Don't take the path of the dark
You won't make it through the night
Though you claim second sight
Don't take the path of the dark

[Solos]

Will you go to the dark one
Fatal choice to decide on

Don't take the path of the dark
You won't make it through the night
Though you claim second sight
Don't take the path of the dark

Don't take the path of the dark
You won't make it through the night
Though you claim second sight
Don't take the path of the dark.
