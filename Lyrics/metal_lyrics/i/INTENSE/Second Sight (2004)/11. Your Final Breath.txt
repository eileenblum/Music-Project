So you're free now, where you are
Life flow in the distance, a heartbeat too far
So, too little and way too late
Their ill timed urgency, couldn't change your fate
All the apologies, they offered to me
But it wasn't my life, taken prematurely 

Take my hand and let me guide you through the night
Time has passed, concerning me ease your mind 

The shadow's cast
You close you eyes
And take your final breath
Death's seen its task
As you fade away
You take your final breath 

Nothing was given you fought not to lose
Your golden light always shone through 

So come with me, I wish I could make it alright
Selfishly, it tore my heart and changed my life 

The shadow's cast
You close you eyes
And take your final breath
Death's seen its task
As you fade away
You take your final breath 

You will live on in my heart and mind
Your memories a jewel no one can deny 

The shadow's cast 
You close you eyes
And take your final breath
Death's seen its task
As you fade away
You take your final breath 

Where is the saviour?
Where did he go?
