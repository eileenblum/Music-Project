[bonus track]

Nature will make this my fight
Unjust alright
I will strive against those that deny
Feeling like I'll never breathe again
Another test
Pains in my chest from their icy breath 

Close my eyes, so I can't see
Take my breath, so I can't breathe
Confuse my mind logic's lost to me
Abandon life? It's not that easy 

Demons stalk our path every day
They hide away
When things go wrong they sing their songs
I can't concede my soul to them
My best defence
I will proceed to gain victory 

Close my eyes, so I can't see
Take my breath, so I can't breathe
Confuse my mind logic's lost to me
Abandon life? It's not that easy
The way the rivers flow 
They flow
And the torrent grows
The way the rivers flow 

Can you stay the fight, defend from creatures at night
All your friends change the demons come in every guise
Will you win the war, and battle once more
To win the first prize the ultimate right to survive 

Close my eyes, so I can't see
Take my breath, so I can't breathe
Confuse my mind logic's lost to me
Abandon life? It's not that easy
The way the rivers flow 
They flow
And the torrent grows
The way the rivers flow

The rivers flow
And they grow 
I stand in line

The rivers flow
And they grow
I won't die
