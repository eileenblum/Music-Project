It's bleeding from my pores
Controlling my mind
Welcome my lost cause
Or will the rhyme find me?
Looking back I can't remember 
Who I used to be
Someone's waiting in the mirror
But it's not me 

Drag me down and take me under 

A lifeless soul
Soulless life beyond control
My will has gone
I've drowned my future 

Spirit bond decays
Destroyed from the inside
Bond of hand remains
As all else slowly dies
Paranoia fuels the abduction
Insanity brews my destruction 

To the darkness I surrender 

A lifeless soul
Soulless life beyond control
Struggle for air
Existence squandered 

Take my poisoned dreams
And fall into the void
Fear to look within
And find what is not there 

A lifeless soul
Soulless life beyond control
I couldn't ask
For you to save me
