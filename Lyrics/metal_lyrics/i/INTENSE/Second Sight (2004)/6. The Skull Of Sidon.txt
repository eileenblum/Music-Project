Sworn into sacred code the knight did take his vow
Brotherhood and chastity his pledge
To God and order bound, no flesh desires nor woman's hand
Must lead the knight astray, henceforth to his parting day 

To serve his brother knight till death
Protect him to his final breath 

But to this Sidon Lord temptation did arise
A maiden pure and fair of face
In youth his lady died, yet passion couldn't be denied
He sought her body thus, to satisfy his wicked lust 

And as her lifeless form he held
Dreams to the Sidon lord did tell 

"Nine months have passed, since to ground she was cast
Seek out the place where she rests
On cross of thighbones her child's skull lies
This holds the key to your quests" 

Take the skull and ride to battle, wield the mighty swords
Raise the banner - "Beau Seant!"
All hail the Templar lords
Whilst the flag still flies above us we will heed the call
Skull of Sidon, power protect us, we shall never fall 

Holy army, power and might
Under flag of black and white
Fighting for the glory of the throne
No surrender, fear unheard
To your brothers give your word
'If I breathe you shall not fight alone' 

Guard of ten, kept apart
To protect the beauseant
Sacred symbol held aloft they see
3 to 1 and still they stand
Truth to bring across the land
Marching onward into victory 

Take the skull and ride to battle, wield the mighty swords
Raise the banner - "Beau Seant!"
All hail the Templar lords
Whilst the flag still flies above us we will heed the call
Skull of Sidon, power protect us, we shall never fall
