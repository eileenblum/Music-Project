I'm ready to bring 
The message to the king
Who can deny me?
We seek his return 
As our country burns
Will he kill the flames? 

Feel his father's eye
Guidance from the skies
You now have your call
Your people wait 
Accept your fate
Don't betray your ancestry 

Dispense with time
Leave mystery behind
For now is the time
You have to decide 

On destiny's eve
Even the blind can see
There's no way out
A collision of destinies 

Remember you should
Your time of rule
The days of omens gone
Reborn with the mark
Makes you history's part
And easy for me to see 

[Solos]

Dispense with time
Leave mystery behind
For now is the time
You have to decide 

On destiny's eve
Even the blind can see
There's no way out
A collision of destinies

On destiny's eve
Even the blind can see
There's no way out
A collision of destinies
