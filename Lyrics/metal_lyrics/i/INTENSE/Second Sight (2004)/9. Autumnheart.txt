Don't recall when I first felt the cold
Somehow it seems my tale already has been told
The past like photographs seems strange to me
The eyes may see; the soul forgets the memory 

Yeah I'm older, but can't say wise
Burning candles, praying for the sun to rise
Time was passing, but I never knew
The days were candle flames
Not rekindled once burned through 

Skies will darken
The rains will come
One by one my dreams depart
Like leaves fall from this autumn heart
Their end is met without a sound
Unlamented on unknowing ground 

Echoes of a brighter day
Spectres of summer into the quiet earth decay
And so I ask, "Is this my fate?"
Did I see the seasons change too late? 

In the green fields, I watched them play
Held my distance, waiting for a better day
Colours faded and they all are gone
Wish I could tell him
Break your chains or stand alone 

Skies will darken
The rains will come
One by one my dreams depart
Like leaves fall from this autumn heart
Their end is met without a sound
Unlamented on unknowing ground

Was I blinded? Have I done wrong?
Mind in blue skies, fast approaching winter song
In the fading light I see now clear
Though time renews
Each heart has but a single year 

Skies will darken
The rains will come
One by one my dreams depart
Like leaves fall from this autumn heart
Their end is met without a sound
Unlamented on unknowing ground 

Skies will darken
The rains will come
One by one my dreams depart
Like leaves fall from this autumn heart 

This autumn heart.
