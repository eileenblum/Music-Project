So speaks, truth the final prophecy
That spells the end for you and me
They seek vengeance from all of us
Their glory now soaked in blood 

With bitter, bloody tears they kill
Their fallen brethren now still
The war in heaven escalates
For mankind, it's too late? 

Feel their hate, you are alone
And Prepare yourself for war
Better prepare for war
For the war of angels
Kill for an unholy cause
This the war of angels 

Jealousy fuels their hateful bloodlust
Mortals' extinction, a must
We fight on for our lives
Mankind on trial 

Feel their hate, you are alone
And Prepare yourself for war
Better prepare for war
For the war of angels
Kill for an unholy cause
This the war of angels

[Solos]

Feel their hate, you are alone
And Prepare yourself for war
Better prepare for war
For the war of angels
Kill for an unholy cause
This the war of angels
