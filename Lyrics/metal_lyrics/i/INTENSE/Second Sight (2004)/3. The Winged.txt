All alone in a desolate surround
A backdrop of silence invites you to the ground
Your memory, serves, you well
Haste you thought as in weakness you'll fail 

Remember tomorrow is a different day
You know the world has to be saved 

The gathering, a flock of brooding fear
They listen as they hunt, and will find you if you're near
Hide, don't try to get away
Action with little thought, your last mistake 

Remember tomorrow is a different day
You know the world has to be saved 

Do you see the winged fly?
You can't avoid the winged's eyes 

So the stories are all true
The prophecies and tales now recall to you
Can you resist the possessions it brings?
Will you destroy the one true ring? 

Remember tomorrow is a different day
You know the world has to be saved 

Do you see the winged fly?
Can you avoid the winged's eyes
They seek you for evil's desire
Will you burn in the winged's fire? 

Remember tomorrow is a different day
You know the world has to be saved 

Do you see the winged fly?
Can you avoid the winged's eyes
They seek you for evil's desire
Will you burn in the winged's fire?

Do you see the winged fly?
Can you avoid the winged's eyes
They seek you for evil's desire
Will you burn in the winged's fire?
