Really, feeling the pain, that you kindly gave,
Suddenly, I notice your smile, wondering if I'll break, 

And every day is different
Every emotion I've felt
I stand alone inside torment 

Cruelly administer pain, it's part of the game
Flay me to punish me, you attempt to tame 

And every day is different
Every emotion I've felt
I stand alone inside torment 

So this is the world devised by you?
Unhinged conscience, is there sanity in you? 

Question, I must know why I have your blame
Freedom, I seek above all, and to see you fail 

And every day is different
Every emotion I've felt
I stand alone inside torment
And every day is different
Every emotion I've felt
I stand alone inside torment
