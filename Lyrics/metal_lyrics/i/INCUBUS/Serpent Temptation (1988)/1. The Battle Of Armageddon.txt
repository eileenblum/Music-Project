Roaming souls
Prisoners of the bottomless pit
Tempting us
To be tortured in the everlasting fire
They are trying
To penetrate
Into your...
Religious ones
Protected by the words of Christ
Militant atheists
Destroying the ones that are unsafe
With evil powers
They are pestilenting
The human race
They are trying
To penetrate
Into you faith

[CHORUS]
Spirits of damnation
Who wander throughout the world
Trying to destroy us before Armageddon
For the ruin of our souls

Beware the Anti-christ will be here
To exterminate our religion each year
Because he knows the son of man is near
Don't be afraid Jesus Christ will be here
The end is near
Let's all beware
Of the prophecies

[LEAD]

[LEAD]

[LEAD]

Deads and alives shall be judged
By all holy forces
Sinners will be Satan's wrath
For a thousand years they will regret
It's coming so let's all be aware
They're trying
To penetrate
Into you faith

[CHORUS]
Spirits of damnation
Who wander throughout the world
Trying to destroy us before Armageddon
For the ruin of our souls.
