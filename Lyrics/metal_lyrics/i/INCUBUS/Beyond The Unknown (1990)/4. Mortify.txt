[Lyrics: Francis, Moyses/Music:Francis]

Alone in their destination
Wandering thru this violent life
A part of all misconseption from their past
And now thrown out to the street to rot
Painful screams never heard
Hung on the wings of death
Germs are what they seem
For the rich they have no need

Left in the cold in crucial places
Feeling the horrors of real life

Places to places, no where to go
Agonizing pain and no one seems to care
Trying to revive'em for a higher place
But no one seems to give any support
They hear their torment call
Disarmen from an endless war
Aimed by all kinds of poverty

Vagabonds you will find in all types of societies
Resting in thew underground of this materialistic inferno

[Chorus:]
Mortify
In hostility of human injustice

They are living in a world of darkness
In which the light seems far away

[Lead]

No justice
Blamed for someone else's deeds
Humiliation
Because they are poor
Treated harshly

[Lead]

Is this what they call the advancement of mankind
Why men want to rule the space
While they can't even solve the problems of the earth
So much said, but so little done
Blinded and devoured by our greed

Facing all the worries of our minds
We can't feel what is happening in the world around us
Turbulence is the reasons which we all must face
Crossing the line of stupidity and discrimination
Is one of the reasons which makes us ignore
The actual state of the moribund

Breaking down their hope to pieces
Destitution increases infront of their own miserable lives

[Repeat chorus]
[Lead]

Days passed
Injured ones dying fast
Marsh temperatures
The whips of cold winds
Are frosting their bodies on the attack
Feeling the rigor mortis stage alive
Reaching to the ultimate muscular paralysis

[Lead]
