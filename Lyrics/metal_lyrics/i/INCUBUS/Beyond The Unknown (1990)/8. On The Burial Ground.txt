[Lyrics: Francis, Moyses/ Music: INCUBUS]

Die by violence in this world
Is nothing strange for us
With all those chemicals, wars and destructions
We do not know mother nature has in store for us
The race for economy makes people forget
The lives around this planet
As men become more egoist
Pretty soon
there will be nothing in this world
For men to spare

[Pre-chorus:]
Stupidity, causing pain
And sickness
To our world
Suffer

[Chorus:]
On the burial ground
Is what this planet is all about
It's where we are right now
We might not have any future to be found
On this burial ground
We have nowhere to hide
Death is laughing at our cries

And now we are feeling the effects
That the forces of nature has brought
The droughts, Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions
It's gettin worse than even before
We can see the revenge of this planet upon us
As we keep hurting the sea
The soil and the air
Sometimes some catastrophic accidents happen
Causting death rate and we wounder from where
People are dying in civilization of different lands
Because of the drought
Occurences of flooding everywhere
Killing innocent people and leaving others in despair
Abomination because people fear that all these events
Happen without any warning killing unexpectedly
Men subjugate the forces of nature
But we don't know that it's destroying us slowly

The animals are becoming extinct
Seas and rivers polluted by toxic waste
Combustible smoke
Factories are creating acid rains
That is burning our skins
Damaging plantations
And soon it will bring us to death
Air pollution is disintegrating our atmosphere
Allowing the ultra-violet rays to burn the earth
And to provoke us fear

[Repeat chorus]
[Lead]

Soon some of the lives on this planet
Won't exist anymore
Because we won't be able to recreate
Some of the beauty thta we had before
Nobody seems to care
About the future of our children's civilizations
We better act now
So they won't have a life of torment and frustration

[Repeat pre-chorus, chorus]

Cursed by men this world has become
We are building our own tombs
By eliminating our source of life
When blindly we continue the destructions
There's no future
Day by day we are reaching the end of our lives
