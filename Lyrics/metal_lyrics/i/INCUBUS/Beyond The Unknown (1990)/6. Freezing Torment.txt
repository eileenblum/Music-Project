[Lyrics: Francis, Moyses/Music: Francis]

Peaceful mission thru the air
Suddenly caught unware
Panic rises, lives in despair
Fasten the seat belts, praying to survive
All the memories of their lives
Flashes thru their minds
As the emergency landing is occuring at the time
To the cold, white deserted ground

Shock occurs in the violent crash
It's a morbid nightmare
Bodies torn to an unnatural position
Mutilated until unrecognazable form

[Lead]

Survivors trapped, afflicted pain
Of body and mind, screaming for help
Undergoing tremendous feelings of death

Agony
Misfortune
Misery
Tragedy
Torment
It all adds to an unpleasant destiny

Famish
Extreme hunger
Nourishment supplies ran out
Organism weakens each moment
Cannibalistic action the only way

[Lead]

Crying to god for forgiveness
As the slices of flesh are being devoured
From the dead corpses
There's no choice
Either choose life or death
Lowring themselves to a point
They would never thought to get
A living inferno where rational thoughts became repulsive

A place where the living needed the dead
Shocked by the scars of terror
A memory that they will never forget
For the victims of the freezing torment
