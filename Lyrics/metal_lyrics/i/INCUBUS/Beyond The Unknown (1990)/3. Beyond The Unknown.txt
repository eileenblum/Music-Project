[Lyrics: Francis, Moyses/Music: Francis]

Perfect night
The moon shines bright
But covered with blood
Because this is an evil night
Calls for a sign
Is what the invokers are meditating
The souls from beyond
Are hearing them calling

Moving objects
Sinister sounds in the air
Nerves tense
Hands holding tight
You can feel it answering everywhere
The seekers are happy
Thinking that they are hearing
The voice from their loved one

[Chorus:]
Beyond the unknown
Powerful spectre
Closing in
Is it a dream
Or is it true
Beyond the unknown

Communication begun thru the incarnated body
Of the spiritual leader
Questions are asked, answer correct
But they don't know the real horrors
Behind the spirit of the dead

Ceremony is over now
Relatives left in satisfaction
Knowing that he's resting in eternal peace

[Lead]

Days have passed
Then there was a knocking at the door
Live in the flesh
The missing one that they tought was dead
Memories coming back
Realizing what they have heard
Was nothing but a malignant force
Telling them nothing but lies

[Repeat chorus]
