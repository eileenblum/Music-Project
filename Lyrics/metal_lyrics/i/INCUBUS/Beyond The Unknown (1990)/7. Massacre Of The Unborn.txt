No survive
Unborn child
Cut to pieces
Left without a name
Unwanted because of the problems of humanity
Unspeakable crime
Silent war is the name of the game
Millions are dying in actions of death and pain
Misguited mothers make this happen
Sometimes for a financial situation
Or a sexual mistake

[Chorus:]
Massacre of the unborn
Massacre of the unborn
Massacre of the unborn child

Innocent blood cries in vain
Defenseless lives are slaughtered everyday
They should make a law against this insanity
Unborn corpses are growing inextreme quantity

Premature stage
Slowly destroyed by the human race

[Lead]

Tortured by tyrants
Unjustly demise
Infant children are left to die

Just innocent lives they slay
There is no chance to escape

Murdering is the matter of this case
A merciless torture to take
No one will live, because they won't survive
There's infant dying
Can't you see
That they will not have a chance
Of growing up in this life

[Lead]

[Chorus:]
Massacre of the unborn
Massacre of the unborn
Massacre of the unborn child
