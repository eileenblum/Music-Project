Broke through the heavens worst escaped the reapers laid on emerald trail with wind in tail. I ride immortal mare. Conquest for greed from fertile soils. You're raisen the most magical seed. Baby i'm blazin, not smith to tend my sword, ride prey to mountains wrath but on the anum eve no curse shall shift my path. Wear thin the horses shoe but not the pony's speed. Power hungry as my gift grows weak and so the holy plant i seek. I ride forboding nights with discontent. Weary eyes unrest is my lament. Nine moons i've gazed at the starts in the sky, unsure of my resupply. I dream of dope worth its weight in gold, i dream of power, but i'm growing old.
