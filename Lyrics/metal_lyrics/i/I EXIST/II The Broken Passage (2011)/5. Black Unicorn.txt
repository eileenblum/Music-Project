Slowing my heart as your touch sets in, i don't mean to complain. Though you're nothing but sin, i savor the taste, hope it ain't my last taste of your sweet, intoxicating blast. White girl, black unicorn. White girl, black unicorn. White girl, black unicorn. White girl, black unicorn. Winged beast, its every time we go flying i know i must be growing closer to dying. Can't extricate myself because I'm addicted to your buzz. Come on. Let's go. There is death at everybody's end. I'll ride the highway on a heavy blend. Decisions made are a hard thing to change. I find thoughts of a man who's deranged. White girl, black unicorn. White girl, black unicorn. White girl, black unicorn. White girl, black unicorn. I think my heart quit.
