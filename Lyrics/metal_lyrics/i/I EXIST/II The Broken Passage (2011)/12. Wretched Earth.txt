Life unenjoyable passing and wasting such precious time. Greed, found a weakness in me when i sampled tee taste of divine. Traded my cosmic distant paradise for a chance at repairing the world. I was looking for pleasure and only found pain in the hell broken earth. I was sold. Turn to the mountain becoming a smoldering lava pit. There you may flee from the cruelty, immersing yourself  into it. My power. My greed. Destroyed the world. But i tried to take another path. Follow the way of the lord. Battled creatures that tower my height from the desert to the shores. Wielded blade til my fingers ache. from the dawn through the night. Served this land more than any man, this place will never see light.
