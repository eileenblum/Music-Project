Dismember me, throw my soul to the sea, watch as it sinks so slowly. Man
overboard, my heart breaks on the shore. Caught staring at the lights in
her eyes. Sheâll pull you down to your fucking demise. Dragging you under,
lost in a foolish rapture, the lovers drown. Sailors lost at sea, can you
hear me calling as I scream beware? Youâre staring at the sinking ships.
Beneath the waves you come to grips. Youâve reached the end. &gt;From buried
bones the ghosts ascend.

Dismember me, throw my soul to the sea, watch as it sinks so slowly. Man
overboard, my heart breaks on the shore. Together we flow, caught in the
undertow. Cultivate and create what we already know, this is wicked love.
From buried bones the ghosts ascend.

Dismember me, throw my soul to the sea watch as it sinks so slowly. Man
overboard, my heart breaks on the shore.
