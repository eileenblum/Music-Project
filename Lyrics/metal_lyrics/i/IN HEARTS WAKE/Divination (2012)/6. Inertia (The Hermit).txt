[feat. Garret Rapp Of The Color Morale]You always had everything that Iâve ever wanted, and I still seem to have
these thoughtsâthey are running, running, running. My body, my mind and my
willâIâve had itâand I always will, I always will. And I will always stay.
Take time move forward, take time move forwardâ¦for what?

Iâm only now beginning, to see life differently. The visions Iâve had are
still always calling, calling and calling. Iâm searching and Iâm finding
my way, so I follow my heartâI always will, I always will. Take time move
forward, take time move forwardâ¦for what?
