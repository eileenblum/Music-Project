It took my breath away in each and every day. Take me back to the place I
canât erase. Turn the page release me from this cage, re-live my memories.
Were you ever told the tale about a place where no one ages? A vision in
the mist, a dream beyond the stars. Take me back to a place that I know
where all the rain clouds carry over. Carry me. Watch the sun as it goes
down and if I stay here I will live forever.

The shell degrades, time is running out. The stars are falling, sleepless
nights in pain, the ships are calling. Take me back tonight. So will you
turn the pageârelease me from this cage, re-live my memories. Take me back
to a place that I know where all the rain clouds carry over. Carry me.
Watch the sun as it goes down, and if I stay here, I will live forever.
The stars are falling, sleepless nights in pain, the ships are calling,
bring the rain. Bring the fucking rain. Take me back.
