Tell me, tell me, wonât you tell me pleaseâwhy do things always happen in
threes? I use to think you were in control of your own destiny. So many
moments being alone, you launched a plan. You chose to be the victim and
now youâre so, so far away.

Iâm waiting for the chance to finally breathe again. Hold on to me, until
the lights go out. Iâm waiting, still waiting for the chance to finally
breathe again. Hold on to me, until the lights go out. The heroâs journey,
the choices that you make. The villainâs downfall, the path you know you
canât escape. You lost control of everything.

Tell me, wonât you tell me why, I fail to see your face in the sky? The
cold rain, it distorts my eyes, questions run through my mind. You chose
to be the victim, you choked on the bitter end. You chose to be the
victim, and now youâre so, so far away.

Iâm waiting for the chance to finally breathe again. Hold on to me, until
the lights go out. Iâm waiting, still waiting for the chance to finally
breathe again. Hold on to me, until the lights go out.
