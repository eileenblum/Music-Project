The cure kicks in, this is medicine. Iâm not going home tonight. The
wolves are waking up from sleep, there are monsters in my head. I donât
remember where we were, so pick me right up off the pavement. I donât
remember where we were, so pick me right up off the sidewalk. Let me rest
when the moon descends. let me rest in the valleys overhead. Itâs in my
blood again.

release, this is our release.
