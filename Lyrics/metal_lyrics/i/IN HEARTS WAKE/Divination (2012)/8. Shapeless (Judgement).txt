[feat. Adrian Fitipaldes Of Northlane]In this limitless landscape my mind is running wild. All shapeless forms
collideâthe room around me evolves, and ever so softly I hear lies. All
paths lead to the end, will you attack or will you defend? Engage in whats
unclear, overwhelmed by fear. So fucking ask me what are you so afraid of?
Youâll never know the truth.

In this limitless landscape my heart is beating fast. All hopeless
thoughts dissolveâthe floor beneath me returns and ever so slowly I wake
up. False suns of trinity explode in the universe, Residual intellect
declines within a simple verse. Fate has mapped man as the master race,
can you hear time echo? Third eyes open to the world, intuition twisting
minds into what we know.

All paths lead to the end, will you attack or will you defend? Engage in
whats unclear, overwhelmed by fear. Mother, father wonât you make me brave
or will I live life to an early grave?
