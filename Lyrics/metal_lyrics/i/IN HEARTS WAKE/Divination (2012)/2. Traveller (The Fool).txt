Have you seen the traveller? He moves with the night and day. With no
items of value he finds fortune in being free. I remember when I use to
think that I was moving faster, but the whole world moves under me. Our
lives were closely interwoven then, but they unravel with such urgency.
You canât help this feeling inside. You belong to no one, as long as your
heart can breathe. You belong to no where, as long as you roam free.

All you need are the clothes on your back, with your health and your heart
intact. A life full of duty is a life thatâs full of endless strain. I
remember when I use to think that I was moving faster, but the whole world
moves under me. Our lives were closely interwoven then, but they unravel
with such urgency. You canât help this feeling inside. The road will never
swallow you, so live your life on your own two feet. The road will never
swallow your sunrise.

Now I can see what lies ahead and I can feel the wind in my hair. I know
the road will never swallow me. Iâll live my life on my own two feet, the
road will never swallow my sunrise.
