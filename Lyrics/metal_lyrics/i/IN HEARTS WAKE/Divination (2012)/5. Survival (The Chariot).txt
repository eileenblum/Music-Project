One life to live to pay your daily fee. The labor for your love weighted
with hours that never cease. They will tell you that youâll never make it.
Corruption lies within, never bow to forty thousand feet. We will survive.
This is the only way we will make it out alive. We will survive. Unless
you persevere youâll be left to rot behind.

Two deaths to die everything is closing in. Still pushing forward now
youâre standing on the edge. They still tell you that youâll never make
it. The avaricious wonât amend, you will be carried safely in the end. We
will survive. This is the only way we will make it out alive. We will
survive. Unless you persevere youâll be left to rot behind. The slaving
wager leads men to more than war. Motherfucking bounce. This is my
survival. We will survive. We will survive.
