[feat. Winston Mccall Of Parkway Drive]I will stand alone to the very end. I will stand alone. I am fearless I
will not give in to the bureaucracy of death. So many lifeless questions
left unanswered. When Iâm dead and gone, what will become of me? Will my
name be set in stone? Will I be more than blood and bone? Does the
strongest soul forever walk alone?

Cast me to the wind where did the time go? Searching all my life Iâll
never know. Drifting through the air where did our love go? Iâll never
know, Iâll never know. Boom. Meet me on the other side, Iâll say farewell
to the world we know. Cast me to the wind where did the time go? Searching
all my life Iâll never know. Drifting through the air where did our love
go? Iâll never know, Iâll never know.

I know I will leave this world the same way I entered, in solitude and
with nothing. Will I be more than blood and bone? As the strongest soul
Iâm destined, I will stand alone. I am fearless. I will not give in. Alone
with nothing.
