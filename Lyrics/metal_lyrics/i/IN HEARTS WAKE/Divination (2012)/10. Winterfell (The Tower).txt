Murderers. No one would hear me, no one knew I had a soul. Now winter
comes for you all. I will run the rivers dry, I will make the molten
mountains cry. Iâll bring the fire, Iâll take the air. I am the earth we
will never share. I dine with the moon, I am the father of mother nature.
I move to and fro wonât you let the others know that I am out to kill.

Murderers. Now can you hear me, now can you feel my soul? My winter comes
for you all. Thereâs no place to hide. I will call upon the raging tide.
Iâll bring the fire, Iâll take the air. I am the earth we will never
share. I will bring you down. Youâve brought this on yourself, itâs been a
long time coming now. I dine with the moon, I am the father of mother
nature. So can you hear me now?

Youâre all victims of the same dying race. What have we done? Have we
reached our destination? Youâre all features of the same lying face. We
die as one. Will there be another generation?
