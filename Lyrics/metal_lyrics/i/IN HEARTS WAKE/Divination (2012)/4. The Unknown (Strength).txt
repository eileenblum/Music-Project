[feat. Chad Ruhlig Of Legend]To all victims and witnesses of fear: your brave young hearts, they will
prevail, they wonât find defeat. Broken homes fuck the way, they breed
hate young hearts repay. Born on the battlefield your past remains
unknown.

Bringing back all the days youâve been through, finding life so hard to
value. If I could take away the pain, thereâd be more to inherit your last
name. Where are you now?

To all victims and witnesses of fear: your brave young hearts, they will
prevail. Older now laid to rest with six feet upon the chest. Born from
the battlefield your past remains unknown. So burn this motherfucker down.
Burn it down.
