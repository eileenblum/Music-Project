Hear me now
When the brightest city has fallen
And the last animal is diseased
Starving children
Will inherit a wasteland
What then has money achieved?

Stone monsters tear away
Great rivers burn aflame
Children of the future
Renew the truth

Renew the truth

We cannot have
Infinite economic growth
On a finite planet
Disengage everything
That you were ever told
We must restore the balance
And believe

[Chorus:]
I believe we must reshape this world
With so much to lose
We're dying to prove
Our life on Earth
I believe we must reshape this world
(Shape this world)
Do my eyes deceive me
Or is it us that need to change?
Where do we go from here?

When the purest rivers are poisoned
And the last forest destroyed
(Destroyed)
Dying children
Will be born from extortion
What is this evil contortion?

Everything you know
Everything you love
Sacred chaos unfolds
We're losing control

We're losing control
Disengage everything
That you were ever told
We must restore the balance
And believe

[Chorus:]
I believe we must reshape this world
With so much to lose
We're dying to prove
Our life on Earth
I believe we must reshape this world
(Shape this world)
Do my eyes deceive me
Or is it us that need to change?
Where do we go from here?

When the brightest city has fallen
And the last animal is diseased
Starving children
Will inherit a wasteland
So what the fuck will money achieve?
