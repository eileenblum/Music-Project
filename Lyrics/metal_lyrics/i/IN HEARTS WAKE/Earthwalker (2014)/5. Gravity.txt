Do you remember the days when our blue eyes were blinded and we found ourselves? The brightest stars eclipsed by a windblown sun. We all know that life's not forever. Why can't you see that you'll always be weightless without gravity? What are you running away from? Will
you ever come back home? So while you're searching for some direction, try to remember that I'm still waiting. Why did you run away or was it home that ran away from you? You said that you would stay. So where do you belong when things start to change? We can't choose
where we've come from, but we can choose where we go from here. Maybe then things will be different when you can see there's still life in a dying tree. We'll walk in an evergreen park, holding hands we begins to depart. Face to face, eye-to-eye, on a deathbed we will
lie. What brought us together will tear us apart. Heart to heart, yours and mine, bathed in sunlight we will shine forever. So while you're searching for some direction, try to remember that I'm still waiting. Why did you run away or was it home that ran away from you?
You said that you would stay. So where do you belong when things start to change? We can't choose where we've come from, but we can choose where we go from here. I now know that time is forever. We are free and we'll always be voices unbound in eternity. Why did you run
away or was it home that ran away from you? You said that you would stay. So where do you belong when things start to change? We can't choose where we've come from, but we can choose where we go from here
