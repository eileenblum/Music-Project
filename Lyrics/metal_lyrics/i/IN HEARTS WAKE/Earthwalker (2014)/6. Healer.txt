Searching for guidance on an altar of dreams. Laying before death and torn at the seams. The stiching of scars, the knitting of bones, bound by the healers, the holder of thrones. We're facing demons in the dark â I feel them under my skin, I feel their hatred within.
This vision's tearing at the heart â despite the pain that I'm in, new life begins. All we need is to live and forgive everyone, everything that holds us back. No hate, no fear of anyone. All we need is to heal and reveal everyone, everything that helps us grow. No hate
no fear of anything. Retrieve my soul. Within, without, I know what it's about. Above and below, will you ever fucking know? I was praying for life at the depths of my soul. I surrendered the ego, returned with control. Everything is as it should be, all that is and ever
will be. The vision is clear. We're facing demons in the dark â I feel them under my skin, I feel their hatred within. This vision's tearing at the heart â despite the pain that I'm in, new life begins. No hate, no fear of anyone. All we need is to live and forgive
everyone, everything that holds us back. No hate, no fear of anything. Within, without, I know what it's about. Above and below, will you ever fucking know? Within, without, I know what it's about. Above and below. Retrieve my soul. Back from the dead.
