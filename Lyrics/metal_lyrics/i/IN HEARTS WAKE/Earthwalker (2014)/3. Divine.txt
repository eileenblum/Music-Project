[Chorus:]
Breathe
And feel the air in your lungs
Breathe
And see how far that you've come
Even when our worlds collide
Just breathe in one more time

Step into this world
And see through my eyes
You'll find that there is a love
Behind disguise
In this heart space
I feel perpetual grace
And through time
We will both survive

I can feel her taking me back
(Taking me back)
I can hear her calling me home
(Calling me home)
Mother nature suspended in time
We are one
We are divine

Living in a dream we can't control
(Trol, trol, trol, trol)

[Chorus:]
Breathe
And feel the air in your lungs
Breathe
And see how far that you've come
Even when our worlds collide
Just breathe in one more time

When doubtful feelings
Flood into my mind
I remember I'm here and I'm alive
It is human to feel
It is love that will heal
Even through the darkest of days

I can feel her taking me back
I can hear her calling me home
Mother nature suspended in time
We are one
We are divine

Living in a dream we can't control
(Trol, trol, trol, trol)
Living in a dream of reality

We are divine
We are divine

[Chorus:]
Breathe
And feel the air in your lungs
Breathe
And see how far that you've come
Even when our worlds collide
Just breathe in one more time

[Chorus:]
Breathe
And feel the air in your lungs
Breathe
And see how far that you've come
Even when our worlds collide
Just breathe

This is serenity

Living in a dream we can't control
(Trol, trol, trol, trol)
Living in a dream, we are alive
