So dark, no light can enter. So cold, no heat escapes. No gold will ever buy us warmth. In this state, at this rate, there's only so much a heart can take. Looking back: I have read everything you've ever sent to me, and we both know living lives apart is how it's meant
to be. Now we go our separate ways, letting go of our dreamer days. I'll draw the lines to a new map. I will never look back. True North is my destiny. I'm just trying to find the best in me. As the years age and rust, and our tears turn to dust, we'll say we were better
off this way. Captivated by those sapphire eyes, to follow the intangible, a path unwise. In this place, give me space, there's only so much a mind can face. Moving on: I am turning the page, my direction can't be changed. Like waves in the sea, I am breaking free. We
both know this is how it's fucking meant to be. Now we go our separate ways, letting go of our dreamer days. I'll draw the lines to a new map. I will never look back. True North is my destiny. I'm just trying to find the best in me. As the years age and rust, and our
tears turn to dust, we'll say we were better off this way.
