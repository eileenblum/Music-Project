She was ready to leave home, her journey planned out for so long, and in a moment it was all taken away. It tears at her skin. It pulls out her hair. It seems sometimes life just isn't fair. I know, I know nothing is forever. When you go, when you go what will you
treasure? These days are passing by like clouds in the summer sky. Hold close what you love in life. Like whispers of winter, she faced the last of her days. Why doesn't fortune ever favour the brave? Tears stream down her face like pouring rain. We saw her bloom like a
wildflower. I know, I know nothing is forever. When you go, when you go what will you treasure? These days are passing by like clouds in the summer sky. Hold close what you love in life. These are words you'll never read, and I'm a voice you'll never hear. I know you fly
free, and you haven't left me. You're always with me. Relieving all the pain, you shed away your shell but not in vain. Love is the only answer, with joy and laughter, forever after. I miss you wildflower.
