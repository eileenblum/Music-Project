Earthwalkers: you are a part of the Earth and the Earth is a part of you. The blood that courses through your veins is like the sap that courses through the trees. When the Earth in your bones returns to the ground. perhaps then you will remember that this land does not
belong to you, it is you who belong to this land.


Thanks to hornhaver for sending tracks ## 3, 4 lyrics.
