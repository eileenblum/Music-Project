We're taking on water.
How long do you think we'll last
Before we have to abandon ship?
I see the end and it's coming fast.

We started this war.
So why are we surprised that the Earth fought back?
Thunder cracks like a broken back.
Close your eyes. Brace for the impact.

Brace for the impact.

All we want is safe passage,
But you can't set sail when the sails are damaged.
I can't stand it.

Who's steering the ship?
We just drift in the eye of the storm.
Who's steering the ship?
Don't let it slip. Resist! Resist!

We've torn apart this precious ark as fuel for the fire.
A charred and blackened future sold to the highest buyer.

All we want is safe passage,
But you can't set sail when the sails are damaged.
I can't stand it.

Who's steering the ship?
We just drift in the eye of the storm.
Who's steering the ship?
Don't let it slip. Resist! Resist!

Pull me up from the undertow.
Follow the sun, let the wind fill our sails.
Pull me up from the undertow.
Chart a new course, and the ark will prevail.

Who's steering the ship?
We just drift in the eye of the storm.
Who's steering the ship?
Don't let it slip. Resist! Resist!
