I am the king of my own kingdom
The only population is number one
I hold the key to my own freedom
But there are many miles to go down the open road

Far from home
I was born to roam
Lost at last
I have set no path
I am what I create
My past evaporates
Leaving this life
I will say goodbye

So long, I won't stay where I don't belong
The higher I climb, the more I leave behind
So let go, the hardest part is holding on
But the higher you climb, the brighter you shine

Follow my lead, find your own domain
Out in the wilderness you create your name
There's no wrong turns, only different ways
But there are many miles to go down the open road

Far from home
I was born to roam
Lost at last
I have set no path
My vivid dreams take flight
Into the clearest night
Leaving this life
I will say goodbye

So long, I won't stay where I don't belong
The higher I climb, the more I leave behind
So let go, the hardest part is holding on
But the higher you climb, the brighter you shine

I am the king of my own kingdom
I hold the key to my own freedom

Liberate me
Liberate me

I am the king of my own kingdom
Liberate me
I hold the key to my own freedom
Liberate me
