I have felt both sides of a double edged blade
In the forge where I was crowned
Everyone thought I was standing tall
But I was crawling on the ground
I created a mask
To deny and deceive
And I built this prison
For the demons that are trapped in me

Vapours of foul bats vow to consume me
Noises of old rats set to gnaw through me
Blinded by their shadows and deafened by their screams
The dead of night wages war inside of me

Darkness is only the space
Between the light
This pain only remains
If you don't face the fight

I will overthrow all the negativity
Break through the walls that hold you down
Overthrow all that is consuming me
Face your fears they don't control you now

There's a beast born in every man
When lead leaves the chamber from the weapon in hand
All the rage is boiling in your blood
If you pray for the rain, you have to deal with the flood

Waves of my regret vow to consume me
I'll never forget the pain that ran through me
Wade through the wreckage and learn to reject it
I'm the survivor, no longer infected

Darkness is only the space
Between the light
This pain only remains
If you don't face the fight

I will overthrow all the negativity
Break through the walls that hold you down
Overthrow all that is consuming me
Face your fears they don't control you now

Trapped in despair
A cycle going nowhere
End this nightmare it no longer serves you
Break
Through
The walls that hold you

Overthrow all the negativity
Break through the walls that hold you down
Overthrow all that is consuming me
Face your fears they don't control you now

Break through the walls that hold you down
Overthrow all that is consuming me
Face your fears they don't control you now
They don't control you now
