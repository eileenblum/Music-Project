You can't own what is only borrowed
The consequence will rob us of tomorrow

Under cloak and dagger
Seeds of deceit are scattered
Another empire shattered
Trying to claim what can never be tamed
The outcomes always the same
Elemental war will reign

We've torn the fabric of life
Like an earthquake tears into the ground
The hand that holds the knife
Isn't worthy of wearing the crown

Elemental war will reign

You can't own what is only borrowed
The consequence will rob us of tomorrow

Suppress them, second guess them
We won't sit back and watch the world burn to ash again
Monoliths of man erode (erode)
History repeats (repeats)
So what good is greed when there's no air left to breathe?

We've torn the fabric of life
Like an earthquake tears into the ground
The hand that holds the knife
Isn't worthy of wearing the crown

We've torn the fabric of life
Like an earthquake tears into the ground
The hand that holds the knife
Isn't worthy of wearing the crown
