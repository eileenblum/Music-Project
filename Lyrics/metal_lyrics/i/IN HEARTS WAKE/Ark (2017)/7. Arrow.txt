Dear world, I found home on your horizon
Resting safely along your shores
I had it all, my shelter on your island
Never knowing or asking for more

Do you ever wonder what we could have been?
Every gift you give, gone with the wind
We wore away the bond before it could begin

Two halves of a soul, two hearts in the dark
I held the match and you held the spark
Two halves of a soul, two hearts in the dark
So close yet so far apart

I was the bow
And you were the arrow
Straight through the heart
Broken apart
Beneath bone and marrow
I was the air
And you were the fire
We danced in the flames
'Til nothing remained
Our moment expired

Why do we destroy one another?
If there was a time we understood each other
You know I gave you all I could, it was never enough
You've broken this trust and left me to rust
Like I knew you would

Two halves of a soul, two hearts in the dark
I held the match and you held the spark
Two halves of a soul, two hearts in the dark
So close yet so far apart

I was the bow
And you were the arrow
Straight through the heart
Broken apart
Beneath bone and marrow
I was the air
And you were the fire
We danced in the flames
'Til nothing remained
Our moment expired

Don't let our past turn to dust
The best memories will remember us
I'm sorry that I let you down
Don't let our past turn to dust
The best memories will remember us
I needed to let you know I wouldn't let you go

I was the bow
And you were the arrow
Straight through the heart
Broken apart
Beneath bone and marrow
I was the air
And you were the fire
We danced in the flames
'Til nothing remained
Our moment expired
