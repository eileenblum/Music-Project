Watch the stars shine through a telescope lost in time
The silver moon light will carry me through the night

For years I've carved the coastline
Never knowing where I belong
Drifting away, falling into the fray
Where did I go wrong?

What is your frequency? (Somebody save me)
I'm begging please don't shut me out
I need you desperately (Why can't you hear me?)
Listen in before I drop down

Hear the rainfall in the lullaby of the tide
The lightning storm calls in the valleys of the great divide

This lonely heart has no home
Where is the hope I can hold onto?
Sinking below I continue to roam
Always in search of you

What is your frequency? (Somebody save me)
I'm begging please don't shut me out
I need you desperately (Why can't you hear me?)
Listen in before I drop down

Someday I will find you
Trust me, I know
We are all lost souls
Searching for connection
Put the pain behind you
Resurface, find purpose
Recognise the strength
In your own reflection

(What is your frequency?)
(What is your frequency?)

What is your frequency? (Somebody save me)
I'm begging please don't shut me out
I need you desperately (Why can't you hear me?)
Listen in before I drop down
