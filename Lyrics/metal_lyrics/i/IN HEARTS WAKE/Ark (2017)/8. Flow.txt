Take me to the water
By the river's edge you'll see
I could be the man
No man could ever be
Wandering beyond the mountains
Seven eagles guiding me
Far away from all the static
I've never felt so free

In the great unknown I surrender
In the great unknown I remember
No matter what we go through
This heart will always hold you

Move into the flow
Let it all go
Shed the dead weight of your shadow
Be the light that you've always known
Move into the flow
Let it all go
When you find yourself you are not alone
You are not alone

Our souls are now connected
They dance in secrecy
You are the one
No one could ever be
Float along the warmest waters
Where the stars shoot over me
In the present there is magic
Our hearts in harmony

In the great unknown I surrender
In the great unknown I remember
No matter what we go through
This heart will always hold you

This heart will always hold you

Move into the flow
Let it all go
Shed the dead weight of your shadow
Be the light that you've always known
Move into the flow
Let it all go
When you find yourself you are not alone
You are not alone

Run with the rivers, break with the sea
Now is the youngest that we'll ever be
Life is a flash in the blink of an eye
Don't live your life like you're waiting to die
Run with the rivers, break with the sea
Now is the youngest that we'll ever be
Life is a flash in the blink of an eye
Don't live your life like you're waiting to die
