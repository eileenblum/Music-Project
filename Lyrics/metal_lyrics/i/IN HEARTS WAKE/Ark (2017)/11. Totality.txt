We have travelled so far
To leave it all behind
They tried to sell our souls
To a future we wouldn't buy

Follow the forest that bears the soil
To stem our roots back into the leaves
Life forever revolves
Like a dance of energy

It's all around us
What more do we need?
It's all around us
The cycle repeats
The cycle repeats!

This is a warning sign
Don't wait 'til it's too late, we're almost out of time
This is a warning sign
How far forward can we go before we can't rewind?

Waiting for an answer
As moments melt away
They tried to mold our minds
With a system built to decay

Islands of ice, once pillars of stone
Disappear back into the sea
Life forever revolves
Like a dance of energy

The tree of life splintered in our hands, our hands
The tree of life splintered in our hands, our hands
The tree of life splintered in our hands
Splintered in our hands

Branches severed by the avarice of man
Rising tides, sinking lands
The tree of life splintered in our hands

It's all around us
What more do we need?
It's all around us
The cycle repeats
The cycle repeats!

This is a warning sign
Don't wait 'til it's too late, we're almost out of time
This is a warning sign
How far forward can we go before we can't rewind?
This is a warning sign
Don't wait 'til it's too late, we're almost out of time
This is a warning sign
