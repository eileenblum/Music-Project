I am the night sky hunting you down. I am invisible, out of sight, like truth to the world.Â  I am the starless emptiness you feel. Youâre the epitome of âvacuous.â Fucking suffocate.

And as the streetlights start to fade away, you feel the sudden change. I know Iâm better off without you in my way. My hands around your neck, taking away your breath, the air is leaving you but I donât feel a thing. I am here.

I am the starless emptiness you feel. Youâre the epitome of âvacuous suffocation.â

And as the streetlights start to fade away, you feel the sudden change. I know Iâm better off without you in my way. My hands around your neck, taking away your breath, the air is leaving you but I donât feel a thing.

I cannot be heard. I canât be felt. I exist in your surroundings so therefore I am here.
Fucking suffocate. I cannot be heard. I canât be felt. I exist in your surroundings so therefore I am here. I am here. With weapons being words, Iâll surround you all.

I am the night sky hunting you down. I am invisible, out of sight, like truth to the world.Â  I am the starless emptiness you feel. Starless epitome, so fucking suffocate. Weâre waiting for the end.
