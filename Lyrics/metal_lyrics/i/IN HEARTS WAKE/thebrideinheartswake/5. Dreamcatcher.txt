Time moves on and we wonât change. Follow your heart or life will fall away. We can change. The less you dream the faster you die, give yourself the chance to breathe.
Chase your dreams, follow your heart - why werenât you taught this from the start.

Cast your weary nets may they cradle home. Aim to search, you wont find. For the answer is inside. Believe this mystery, this is within your reach.

Time moves on and we wonât change. Follow your heart or life will fall away. We can change. The less you dream the faster you die, give yourself the chance to breathe.

With every heartbeat one less remains. With every heartbeat chase all your dreams.
Find your everything. Find your everything. For in the end weâll be weightless history.
Time moves on. Life moves on.
