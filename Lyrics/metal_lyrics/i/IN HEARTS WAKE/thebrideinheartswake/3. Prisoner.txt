Prisoner
Who is the prisoner?
You wanted more and more and now you have nothing left.
Who is the prisoner?
A man sat alone drenched in the darkness, he whispered softly to himself, âI had it all.â

After all the battles you have won
After all your greed has been found finely spun
Iâll tell you, Iâll tell you anything
Iâll show you, Iâll show you everything

That man sat alone drenched in the darkness, he whispered softly to himself, I am no more.
Shrouded in a cloud of misery

After all the battles I have won
After all my greed has been found finely spun
Iâll tell you, Iâll tell you anything
Iâll show you, Iâll show you everything

You wanted the world but you threw it all away!
I am alone

Prisoners.
I am that man, I am that prisoner
I am alone, we are alone
