Everyone around me, Seems to be aging by the day.
Lines like war maps upon their faces...
Where is our neverland?
Where is our innocence?
For all I want to do, is escape away with you.
To hear the blue birds call, blue birds call.
To see the blue snow fall, blue snow fall.
Trudging through the blizzards singing home.

Singing home.
Running, Screaming, Laughing, Dreaming, Never grow old.
We will spend our lives not losing, but gaining with those we love.
Happy endings have never seemed so far.
We must make our way home, our way home.
Happy endings have never seemed so far, happy endings.
For beyond that lies paradise, where we will never grow old.
Running, Screaming, Laughing, Dreaming, of our paradise, paradise.

Where we will never grow old.
