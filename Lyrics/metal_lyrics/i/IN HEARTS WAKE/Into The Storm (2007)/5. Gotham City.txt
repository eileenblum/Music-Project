We will never let this happen, again. The Beginning, of the end
The city clocks tick us towards the end.
Wealth neglecting "poor"
Something must be done. Awaken these demented souls.

For all they can hear is the sound of angels singing, singing them to death.
The people suffering, their walls growing mould.

How can all this be real?
Why can't this be a dream, a dream?
How can this all be normal?
How can this all be true?
Why can't this be, just a dream.

The streets they suffer.
The nocturnal bees, that quench the nectar blood...
I can't, I won't give in.
We can't loose this fight
I can't, I won't give up.
We can't loose this fight, we need a chance.
Revolution go.

Change.
