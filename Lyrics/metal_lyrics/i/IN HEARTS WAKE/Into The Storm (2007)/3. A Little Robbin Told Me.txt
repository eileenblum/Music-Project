Why are we still fighting this war?
What are we still fighting this for?
Open your eyes from what may awaken them to see the true night and day.
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up!
We won't stride this woeful world for much longer.
Harrowing the earth and building every city.
We are lost in this dark place, of no return.
We are lost in this dark infinite abyss puncturing the earth.
What will be Death Valley.
And in the end, all life dies.
And in the end, This will end with dark dead Skies.
Where have we gone wrong?
Tears from gallons, our ships slowly sinking.
Where have we gone wrong?
The sooner we sleep, The sooner this will pass.
Projecting fear into our enemies
Before we die, Before we die.
We must change our ways for the future.
I'll watch the sun set into a sea of blood and wonder if it will ever return, Return?
And in the end all life dies.
And in the end, This will end with dark dead skies.
And in the end, In the end.
The eyes begin to open, but hence to no avail.
The torn earth still weeps its sullen cry.
The bloodstained clouds still remain me of yesterday.
The vegetation begins to grow, To grow.
Upon the mouths of stone angles.
And in the end, All life dies
And in the end, this will end with dark dead Skies.
And in the end, all life dies.
Why can't I dream anymore?
