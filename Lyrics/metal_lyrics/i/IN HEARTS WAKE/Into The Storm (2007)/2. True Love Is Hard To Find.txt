From that one night, There's no turning back.
A silhouetted angle so warm to,
So warm to touch.
Embracement withheld, We spoke of love,
We spoke of love.
How cold the wind blows, In her presence I lay,
In her presence I lay numb.
Shooting stars shared wishes for my desire was hers.

One day I want to wake to see the sunrise in your eyes,
Your eyes.
Where clouds wash away, And nothing dies.
Tried hours beckoned a sleepless sleep.

And now forever I remember us alone together,
Where we would talk and we would walk into our own dreams.

On these cold nights will you remember me?
With one farewell, A vow was made on these cold nights, Please remember me.
Remember me, Please remember me.
One these cold nights, will you remember me?
Remember me, Will you remember me?

One day from forever, Forever from one day.

"The red son rises... Blood has been split this night."

From, One, Day...
