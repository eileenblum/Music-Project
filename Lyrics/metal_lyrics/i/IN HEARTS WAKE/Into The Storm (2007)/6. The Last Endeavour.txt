Last night the storm an I, where caught between tow seas.
Lighting bleached the sky, thunder shook the glass.
The wind striped everything, of its sullen moisture.
I longed for the rain, that fresh sweet scented air to find new life.

Sailing ever after.
The moon our guide, sailing towards the sunset.
Where had I drifted?

Where was I lost?
Or had I found?
one last journey, of what this could be.

We must make this last endeavour holding hands and thoughts together, this last endeavour.
To find your sunset.

Fill our sails with hope, a drawing of a new day.
This will be our last pain.
