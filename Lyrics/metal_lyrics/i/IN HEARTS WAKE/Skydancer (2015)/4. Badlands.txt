[Verse 1:]
Walking through the badlands
I watch the tyrants scar the red sands
Their greed is like morphine
Drilling into the veins with machines
The purest form of evil that I've ever seen

[Pre-chorus 1:]
Who are you to destroy this ancient land?
How dare you disrespect what you don't understand
We will rise up
We will take it back
You are called out
This is where we make our stand

[Chorus:]
We're tearing down the walls
We are the outlaws, we are the outlaws
Your kingdom was built to fall
And now we're coming for you all

[Verse 2:]
Riding through the canyons
I am the outlaw left abandoned
Fingerprints of future lives
Footprints of homes left behind
Self-destruction is the greatest failure of mankind

[Pre-chorus 2:]
Who are you to destroy this ancient land
How dare you disrespect what you don't understand
We will rise up, we will take it back
You are called out
We will make our stand

[Breakdown:]
Don't let this world go
We'll never make it on our own
Don't let this world go
The only home we've ever known

[Chorus:]
We're tearing down the walls
We are the outlaws, we are the outlaws
Your kingdom was built to fall
And now we're coming for you all

[Outro:]
So here we stand back to back at crossroads
Our guns drawn now
It's time to reap what you've sowed
Bronze, silver and gold
Now lead is all that you're owed
With your last ten steps
You'll suffer six feet below
