Can you see what you've become?
Hiding yourself behind a loaded gun
You will never feel true love
Living in the shadow of the sun
The hopeless now lie crawling on their knees
And who will lead with compassion in their hands?

Break, break away
Break from the past, break from everything you know
Take, take away
Take from the dead, they are living proof

Try to breathe the smoke-filled air
Haunted by the voices of the dead
You will never win the war
Or wash away the blood that has been shed
The hopeless now lie crawling on their knees
And who will lead with compassion in their hands?

Break, break away
Break from the past, break from everything you know
Take, take away
Take from the dead, they are living proof

Break, break away
Break from the past, break from everything you know
Take, take away
Take from this life; itâs the only fucking truth

To the cowards who sit back and watch
Fathers become a casualty notch:
Where are they now the truth is out?

To the mothers who grieve and cry
While their children fight back and die:
Where are they now the truth is out?

Break, break away
Break from the past, break from everything you know
Take, take away
Take from the dead, they are living proof

Break, break away
Break from the past, break from everything you know
Take, take away
Take from this life; itâs the only fucking truth

This is the only fucking truth
