Questioning the wildfire spreading in
So tell me is there more to see? How is life supposed to be?
I feel it begin
The here and now within
And I can taste the rising flames
Radiating through my veins
Ignite your fire tonight

Ignite your fire tonight

This light is now burning constantly
I can feel the fire spreading from beneath my feet
It's brighter than the rising sun, so don't let it set or we'll come undone

Back in the shadows
I saw everything
And I now know there's more than DNA
In our minds, in our lives

Here in the meadows
Life is everything
And I know this is a brand new day
In our minds, in our lives

My blind eyes have seen the brightest day
The more the fire begins to blaze the more darkness is pushed away
It now writes my name
In colours of the flame
Trust those who seek the truth
Question those without pursuit
Ignite your fire tonight

This light is now burning constantly
I can feel the fire spreading beneath my feet
It's brighter than the rising sun, so don't let it set or we'll come undone

We're burning alive
We're burning alive

This light is now burning constantly
This light is now burning constantly
Ignite your fire tonight

This light is now burning constantly
I can feel the fire spreading beneath my feet
It's brighter than the rising sun, so don't let it set or we'll come undone
