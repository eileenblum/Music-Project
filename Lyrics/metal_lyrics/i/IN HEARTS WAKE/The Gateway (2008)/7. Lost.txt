My mind is a lost battlefield; Thinking will be the death of me. However itâs result has brought me to understand, that the real war is the war within. So are we getting stronger? What we fear is fear. Are we learning? Donât let this doubt fill my mind. I sense danger here. No more suffering. Itâs the sound of stars that will guide us home âSilence. On a journey ill my mind goes wandering again. âSilence. To climb out of this well, Iâll need something greater, something more than a ladder. Something with need,
Something with motive, something with steps, -Greater than I. Let us not falter. Our families are destroyed, through heedless actions. Why do we feel so lost? -Why? Why cannot we be content with life? If you seek a journey of revenge, dig two graves. Dig two graves! Lost.
