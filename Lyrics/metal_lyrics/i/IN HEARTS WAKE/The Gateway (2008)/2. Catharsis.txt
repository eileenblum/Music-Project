This is my story of a dying earth. For all I can see is unhappiness -surrounding me. We have all led to this. We are in this together. Having more has only made us lesser men. Why has laziness led to selfishness? Why are we wanting what we don't have? Evil prevails when good men fail to act. Only dead men cast long shadows. There will be no constellation - shadows. Could you ever give, or love something more than yourself? With no land to conquer we are digging underground in this nightmare
We live in a world where fact is worse than fiction. Now Iâve told this story but left a chapter, for us to complete. We are falling into a deep sense of insecurity. Evil prevails when good men fail to act. We are the only ones who can write the end.
