This was my hiding place, my sanctuary that I once called home -I belonged. So many times, so many concentric circles. How many times have we been here? The salty waters here brought me many tales of the deep and thoughts of forever. Am I relationship-less or just a sailor without his ship? In all fair honesty, I gave you all.
I gave you everything. If I could walk on water Iâd take you out to sea. Even our heavy oars couldnât get us this far. We have only skimmed the surface of the ocean. Why were we always searching for something that was never there? -Never there. The white horses upon the sea were waiting for our dreams to grow their wings. Where the hungry come to feed the weak come to fall. I will never drown beneath your waves. This, this is never over I am moving on. Moving on! I can no longer call this place home. Happiness is only real when shared.
