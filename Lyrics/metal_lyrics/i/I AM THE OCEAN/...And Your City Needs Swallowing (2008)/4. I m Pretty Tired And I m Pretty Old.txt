She said "Let's do it again"
And I said it too.
"You would," she says, "If you knew what's good for you."
So I says to her.

Listen to me closely; I'm of utmost seriousness when I say this with these eyes partly (not unheartedly) broken open.

And she heard me good...I know.
I still got a heart though, it's gone hard and cold.
And if I'll ever quit, well I don't know...
But I'm pretty tired...and I'm pretty old.
And maybe if I was more like a/my/her dad, I could lie, so much better (and I don't mean to "fib")
It's meant much more "biblical"...
Like a spear: taking to rib(s).

And I'm not scared to let you know:
Some (will) soon see: more (of) my fists.

And when she says: "Let's do it again,"
I'll always say it too.
I may say that I quit, but I really never do.

Oh no (no no)... I won't believe you.
Well, you're just a copy, and I love my junk...
Oh, no (no no)... She said: "I don't believe you:
You always say that you quit, but you really never do."

But just give me one more... Just one more day?
