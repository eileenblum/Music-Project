At first:
This knife fight had begun, and with a straight blade crossed neck the other's done.
Their intentions: gone fermenting.

And then:
The blood (just) like the bulls, began to run sure as will (a)rise: the sun, end will/could/have come.

Just as quick as their battle had begun, a straight blade crossed a neck, and the two became or becomes:
The one.
Ends came, run.
(Run for it, Marty!)

(Sure I'll meet you there)
Seven p.m. sharp
Still checks his wrist
(for the status on)
His lack-of-clock scars...

(Great Scott!)
