Did you think that we won't notice all your faces as you entered this room to discard us just as soon?
Well, I'll tell you what now:
You're fools, (be)cause we did.
And please don't think:
We'll take kindly to it,
Or you'll have to picture one:
Pinned, punctured, penetrated, you!
We could touch (on) all your favorite bases.
We sure could caress all your faces...
But that would just be too easy...
