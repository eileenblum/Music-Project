Dear you (know who),
Have you ever noticed how all the best flames in your fires are always the ones you see when you're not looking?
Well then I guess you should pay more attention...or is it "less" (attention)
(But to get back to our subject)
Did I fail to mention how I will sit still (at times) and stir myself all up about you
Just beat/break myself into believing "I don't care!".
I can't care; could care, should care, but I don't.
And, now, as much as you know how I'd like to; (well) but I'm gonna say a thing.
(Be)cause you just might be compelled to reciprocate (reciprocate)
...and I don't know if I wanna let myself(s) get/be crushed like:
This and like that (repeat that shit, G).
(I guess I'm really getting to)
I just need to leave, knowing that when I left, I was doing what I love and do best.

Oh, and speaking of crushing and closure:
A well-writ list of (a) slit-wrist composer, created diversion.
A literary aspersion!
Seven letters mathematically returned aversion.

Shit, it's all about priorities...

Orderly, invited cordially, orally or in(g/j)est.
Suppressed/De-pressed upon watermarked pages, etched in colorless bandages and premade excuses.
(Or) chiseled in the drizzled-rain-parched sand.
Sideways, in a foreign hand.
I'm just choking on a steady diet of ecstasy lights...you?
Can you outshine this?
Just tell me... am I that apparently overwhelmed?
Distracted...I seem busy...I dunno...
Either way I breathe, it still goes down the wrong tube.
