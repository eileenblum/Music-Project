I had a dream it was my birthday today...
For a while it became normal, but now I wish that I had not forgot so much...
Was there a battle here?
Me vs. me?
Perhaps... perhaps...
(I dunno)
But here it is now anyway: the kid's (severed) head - right there in my lap!
I (notice that now I) got my head in my hands, and my hands are in my lap.
(head in hands)
(hands in lap)
I don't know if I do (know) though if it's bad news or bad ass..

(wake up dreaming still)
But here I am now anyway, and it's my birthday...
Swear to god I'm gonna buy something bad.
(Maybe an apple bi-product)
(or a product by "Apple")
And I don't know, but I'll bet you your job that it will be the baddest thing you ever seen.

I sure hope that this dream is really just a dream.
And I'm saying it once again: I sure do hope that dream was just a dream.
Because if it was not then I got a problem that's getting to big to be controlled and my hands are just barely not big enough...
Plus it's my birthday, and I don't need some "dead-me" to come and ruin it.
It's my birthday, and I swear to god I'm gonna buy something bad.
