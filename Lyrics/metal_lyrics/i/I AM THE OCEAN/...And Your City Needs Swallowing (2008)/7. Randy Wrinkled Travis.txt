Sometimes you really do need to be more sincere...
More sincere about your bloodlettings.
It's not about your consistency in frequency, it's all about leaving a scar.
A crime of mathematical passion, if you will.
(the product of 7 and 3 is 21)
(the difference of 5 and 2 is... well, let's see: 5, 4, 3!)
(the sum of you and me, it could be Optimus Prime)
(but the quotient of you and I will be so divine)

...and I'll try harder today than I ever tried before...
...and I promised myself to be disappointed if the least I see(slash)saw is bone.
...and I want to feel that (God Damn) knife cut through
Multiple parts of my soul (all) at the same time...

Please, just be more sincere.
Thanks.
