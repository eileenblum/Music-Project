Mandating slaughter of public views
Dictatorship prevails, rioting ensues
Just don't ask questions, censor the news
These are all the attributes in the

Cycle of violence

Our peoples' voices protest our rights
Deteriorating promise truth burns in the fight
Don't try to stop us, it's in our sights
And this just fuels the hate and spite in the

Cycle of violence

It's a cycle of violence
The cycle will never end
