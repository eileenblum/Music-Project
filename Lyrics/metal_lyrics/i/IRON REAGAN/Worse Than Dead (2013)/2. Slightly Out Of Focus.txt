I'm never going back to sleep
Here's the reason why
I feel the next time I do
I'm surely going to die

I really can't tell for sure but I bet it's over there
Slightly out of focus floating somewhere in the air

It's always going to show up, it's never going to go
Does someone have some pointers because I probably need to know

I'm never going there's no reason why
