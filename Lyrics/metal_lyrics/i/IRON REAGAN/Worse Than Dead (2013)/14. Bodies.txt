You don't know what's best for their bodies
Stop slandering victims, forcing motherhood

And it is their choice entirely
Who are we to better see if she's forced to live with this wound

Not you, not you
Stop! This wound!
Not you, not you
Stop!

I'll never know what's best for their bodies
But I don't believe this choice is made by fascist laws
You'll never know their hurt so stop trying
And you'll never understand the obstacles, the anguish involved

Not you, not you
Stop!

Stop!
