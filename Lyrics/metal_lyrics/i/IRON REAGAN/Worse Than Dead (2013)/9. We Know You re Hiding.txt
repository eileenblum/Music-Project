Patiently waiting day after day
For next time you can strike
With words as your weapons waging a war
For your own meaningless fight

You've shown no compassion to things in this world
Laughed at the pain others felt
You can't wrap your brain around anything real
Since you've never lived it yourself

We know you're hiding
So what's there to laugh at?
No one's smiling now
Your time is running out

When you realize your life's filled with the hate
You helped create all yourself
The attention you craved has now caused you to rot alone in your own private hell
