What the fuck happened
We're barely awake
Someone just made a terrible mistake

It's our time to exit
It better be fast
or the repercussions are going to be bad

Eyes, piss, tears

It's just a shame
You might want to call it a day
She's scared for life and I want to erase this from my mind
For years
Burnt in our brains now all we see is

Eyes, piss, tears

Head for the door
Don't look back
You should have took cover
But who'd expect that

It got on the books and everything else

The police are coming let's head for the hills
A horrible way to being a week
When all we just wanted was a place to sleep
Eyes, piss, tears

It's such a shame
They're not going to forget that day
We're scared for years
Burnt in our brains now all we see is

Eyes, piss, tears
