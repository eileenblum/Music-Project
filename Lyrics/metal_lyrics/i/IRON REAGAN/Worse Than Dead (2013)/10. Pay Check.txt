Here I sit with wounds and bruised
Head's pounding, I'm so confused
How did I get signed up for this
I'm sure the point is something I have missed

Fighting for my life, I remain loyal
It makes the blood inside me boil
It's getting harder, but I pull through

But that's not an excuse

They'll have to bring it on, I know that I'm going strong
I've been learning from the best, now I'm ready for the test

Loyal to the code, it's not my first rodeo
Another face to wreck for another motherfucking paycheck
