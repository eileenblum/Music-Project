Metal and mean rolling machine, if you see me get the fuck off the scene
3-tone wreck wreaks hell on the street, thunderous danger if ever we meet
9 in the gallon, ten in the tank, no friends on the road
Nobody to thank
Scars and scrapes, rusted intake, I always get the right of the way

Take notes, take heed
Rule of the road, you must obey

Don't care, don't need
This is my way

Rubbed in filth on the door of the car
Law of the road, open for war

Take notes, take heed
Rule of the road, you must obey

Don't care, don't need
This is my way

The Murder Mile, all of them, run down

A ballet of footwork in a floor full of trash
The hood, the doors, crushed and bashed
Brake pad screams like the angel of death
The beast, the horror, dead black breath

This is my way
