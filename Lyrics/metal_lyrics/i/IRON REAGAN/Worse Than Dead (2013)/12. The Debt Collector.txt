My arm's broken in two, go to the waiting room
(Everything's going to be alright!)
And then you'll call my name? Please sit and don't complain
(Everything's going to be alright!)
It's been two hours man! We'll do the best we can
(Everything's going to be alright!)
Just help me numb the pain, try and relax, OK?
(Everything's going to be alright!)
(Going to be alright!)

You covered or self-pay? Not a penny to my name
(They're going to bill me for life!)
The total that you owe, is that seven zeroes?
(They're going to bill me for life!)
And here's the interest rate, I'm ruined, fucked, a waste
(They're going to bill me for life!)
We care about your health, misfortune is their wealth
(They're going to bill me for life!)
(Bill me for life!)

I'll never be alright

Debt! Collections!
Affordable health is the conception, human needs are compromised
Debt! Collections!
Affordable health is the deception, pay up front or fucking die
