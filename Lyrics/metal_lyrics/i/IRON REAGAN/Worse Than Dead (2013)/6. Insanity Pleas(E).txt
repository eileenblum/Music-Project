They'll all think I'm crazy
I'll tell them I got brainwashed
They'll just try to help me
And forget all this death I caused

Like John from Flint
A business man
I slit his neck and watched his end

That's just one example
There's plenty more where that's from
But I just found a loophole
The system's finest outcome
