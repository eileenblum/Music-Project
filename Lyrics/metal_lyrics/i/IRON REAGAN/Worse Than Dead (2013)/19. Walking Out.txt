Up since 4, not a thing done
Can't get a break of a quarter past one
No days off, impatiently wait
While all I hear all day is your complaints

I'm gonna walk out
I've had enough
I'm gonna walk out
This place is fucked

What's going to happen? Will your brain melt?
When you have to do all this shit yourself
Because soon it's coming and when it starts
Your whole worlds going to fall apart

I'm gonna walk out
I've had enough
I'm gonna walk out
This place sucks!
