I hear what you're saying
but think you're faking
Remorse for the violence
I need more time to finally be convinced

Like rats in a cage
Pumped full of drugs then squashed out like bugs
The end of an age
Just shut your mouth and watch as we're all wiped out

Our new mission is
Find a reason why we're all dying
While their profits keep on multiplying
