Each time that I hear a shrill word out your mouth
There's just one thing I'd like to do
But I must confess before we move on
There's something I must say to you

Eat shit! And live, you'll never be the same
Or go die! But I feel you're much more fun in pain
Eat shit! And live, I'd rather see you squirm
So feast now, or soon be food for all the worms

I know that my methods are twisted and sick
I'm sure you didn't have a clue
Of all of these fucked up things that I planned the second I got a hold of you

Eat shit! And live, you'll never be the same
Or go die! But I feel you're much more fun in pain
