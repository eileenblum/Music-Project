How could you just stand there and not take their side
And witness your own people fight
How could you just sit there while all this goes on
Knowing the side you stand for is so wrong

You're just being used as you already know
How far can you let this thing go
Will you feel betrayed once the crisis is gone
And you're standing there with no one

You just played the game
While your peers look on
You should be ashamed
You should drop the gun

I guess you're just working and doing your job
Oppressing those who help your rights
But some day that guilt's going to catch up real soon
And then it will eat you alive
