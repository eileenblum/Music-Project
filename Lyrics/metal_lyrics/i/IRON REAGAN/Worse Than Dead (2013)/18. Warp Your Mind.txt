I guess I'll take this lying down
Unexpected intruder
When no ones around
It crawls into my brain and stirs

Cold sweat delusions
Panic filled illusions
Temperature gets hotter
Realistic horror
Brace yourself
This hell of a time
Fever dreams will warp your mind

I guess i"ll take this lying down
No way to defend myself
All thoughts are unwound
Trapped in my own living hell
