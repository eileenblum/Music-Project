I've known some selfish fucks but your face points its blame
An egotistical, know-it-all self-proclaimed
Head held high like you're God's gift to man
But you're crammed with ridiculous thoughts
Simple minded spam

Spent too much time defending your halo
Burning bridge after bridge is all you know

You refuse to believe it, but we're all laughing in your face
because your self constructed genius is a joke, a fraud, a fake

You're a joke, a fraud, a fake
Suck it up, you're a joke, a fraud, a fake
