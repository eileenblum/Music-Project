[performed by Iron Reagan]Been a long day
It's getting late
There's a slight chance I'll get some sleep
At every place I travel to
It's always there in every room

Why is this here?
Just disappear

I pulled it out
Ripped it apart
I pulled a page
And lit a spark
I held it like a punter would and kicked it as far as I could.

My justification is just common sense
Don't push your beliefs
When I just want some rest
