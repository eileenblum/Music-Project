[performed by Iron Reagan]You've got it all figured out
Life beater!
You're blowing off the ones who care
A selfish trip with no one there

Three times in a row
I can't take this
Is this all for show?
I can't take this anymore

Three times in a row
What the hells got into you?
Is this all for show?
I can't take this anymore

You've got it all figured out
Life beater!

A selfish trip with no one there

Three times in a row
I can't take this
Is this all for show?
I can't take this anymore
