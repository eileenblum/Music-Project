[performed by Iron Reagan]Around the corner waiting in shadows
A beast rarely seen with deathly intention
He's staring on, waiting to take you away

On these busy streets
No one has seen something so bizarre
So few know the truth of what's going on
They wouldn't believe anyway

What's preying these few lost souls
They'll never believe anyway
They're coming to take you away

So few will notice
So few believe
Most will not trust what can rarely be seen
But there in the shadows waiting to take you away
