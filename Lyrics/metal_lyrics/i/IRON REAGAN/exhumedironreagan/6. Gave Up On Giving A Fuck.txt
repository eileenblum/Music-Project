[performed by Iron Reagan]If you just told us what you really thought
Instead of pushing everyone aside
Eventually it broke the final straw
I gave up.
I gave up on giving a fuck

So guess what? The world has stopped revolving around your every thought
Perhaps someday you'll come to and realize we've all had enough
We gave up on giving a fuck!
