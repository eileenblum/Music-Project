[performed by Iron Reagan]Thereâs poison water
From your sink
Corrosive liquid
Portrayed Safe

Prepare for the worse now this is long term
This was your right that youâll now die from
Results from neglect from those in power
All proudly unaccountable

The crisis continues
Disease spreads
Children poisoned
And no one cares.

They wonât be the last ones
