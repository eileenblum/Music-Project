[performed by Iron Reagan]Itâs shredding itâs shredding
This machine has the answers
Itâs shredding itâs shredding
No one will ever know
Itâs shredding itâs shredding
Devouring all doubt
Itâs shredding itâs shredding
Your secrets stay unknown

Itâs shredding itâs shredding
Innocent till its proven
Itâs shredding itâs shredding
Letâs make it go away
Itâs shredding itâs shredding
Letâs keep the papers moving
And shred every last one today
Weâre shredding
