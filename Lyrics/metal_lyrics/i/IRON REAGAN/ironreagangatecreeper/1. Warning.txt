[performed by Iron Reagan]The endâs been slowly coming
Youâre mindâs been steadily numbing
While we just ignore

An obvious impeding ending
The people keep forgetting
To believe whatâs in store

It doesnât really matter
Someone else can make it better
At least Iâve been told

Donât try to shift the blame around
We all knew that weâre going down
You have been warned

Death
To accountability
Itâs not our problem
We failed
Weâre gonna die

Thereâs no point to make the effort
To try to make things better
Conveniently so

Letâs sit and scratch our heads when
We all just turn out dead
Letâs see no remorse

It doesnât really matter
Someone else can make it better
At least Iâve been told

Donât try to shift the blame around
We all know that weâre going down
You have been warned
