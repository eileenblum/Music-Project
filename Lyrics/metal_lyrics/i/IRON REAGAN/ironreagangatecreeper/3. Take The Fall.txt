[performed by Iron Reagan]Itâs too late there wonât be
a pardon tonight
Wonât be saved even though the evidence proves otherwise

Guilty as charged
Now put to death
Justice a fraud
Pleading innocence to the very last breath

Minutes away a death sentence sets things right
Into the grave bury the truth six feet deep and out of sight

Guilty as charged
Now put to death
Justice a fraud
Pleading innocence to the very last breath

Exposing the truth, exposes all
In a corrupt system we take the fall

Take the fall, we take the fall
