[performed by Iron Reagan]For this night only
This annual meeting
The city gets reckless
A celebration of violence and fire
So tragically senseless

Traditional carnage
Resulting in rubble
Illogical practice

Youâre going to burn for this
Try to survive
Itâs devils night
No one
No one gets out alive

Remains of this city
So tragically shaken
Just grey dust and embers

No oneâs realizing
The senseless destruction
But theyâll sure remember

This timely custom
A failed exorcism
Now onto November
