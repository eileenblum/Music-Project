Here they are lined up waiting to consume
A day masked in kindness and giving for you
A day named black gets darker each year
Trampling the weak for the very best deal

The best spot in line
They'll wait in the cold
The doors get dismantled

The hour is now
You must step aside
Or you will get trampled

The gift of punishments all that's dispersed
The weak fall to the side
While hundreds lay hurt
A stampede of bargains, discounting compassion
Each man for himself for the very best cash in

Itâs that time of year
I must be the one
Who gives them the most
Step in the way
Of the hunt for deals
And you will be toast
