Iâm not going to apologize
You know that you all deserved it
I never promised to keep promises
Thereâs only some that are worth it

My advice to you
Is give me a second chance
It takes a while to get started
And all that song and dance

Give me four more years
Itâs all I can do
Blood and tears
Iâll give to you
Four more years
Itâs all that I need
Cash and fear
To fuel this greed

What I really need now
Is just a little more time?
To make the wrong decisions
To put us years behind

Four more years
Itâs all that I need
Cash and fear
To fuel this greed
