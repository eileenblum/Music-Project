Spend the rest of my life waiting for death
I don't give a fuck either way what's coming next

It can't come fast enough please God take me out
If given the option I would of opted out
I'm already at my end there's no doubt
If given the option I would of opted out

You can't save me
I would of opted out

I won't save me

You must think that I'm sick praying for death
I don't give a fuck I've lived long enough show me what's next
Bored to death!
