Maybe you were brought up a certain way
That makes you not want to fulfill each day
Or perhaps scared of what youâll find

Just know,
Iâm urging you to just let go
You don't need to care at all
You should learn to just say go!

Would you rather sit? Just go do something
Itâs easy to complain rather than create
Get off your ass youâre in control
