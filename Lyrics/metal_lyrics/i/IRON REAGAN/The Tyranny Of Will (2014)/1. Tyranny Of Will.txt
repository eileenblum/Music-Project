Hidden agendas
Informing the world of made up facts you use to push your views

With tireless effort
You see nothing wrong to mislead millions to their foreseen doom

This war machine fueled only by lies
Forcing skeptics to run for their lives

With tireless effort, endless ammunition
A cycle of hate with non-stop repetition

I call bullshit on it fucking all
And you should too before its all gone

Theyâre just lying to steal the world
