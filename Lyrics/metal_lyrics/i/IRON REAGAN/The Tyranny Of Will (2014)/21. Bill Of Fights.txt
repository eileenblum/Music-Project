Bill of fights
The fights we've gotta win
Bill of fights
The walls are closing in

Some time, we gotta make a change
Today, things can't stay the same
Move on from yesterday's mistakes
Ball a fist and do what it takes

We can't let it end this way
The profit from war and poverty
We'll make a list of what we gotta do
Now you know, we're coming for you!

Bill of fights
The fights we've gotta win
Bill of fights
The walls are closing in
