Everyone's lazy that makes way less than you
Abuse the wealth they work to produce
Indignant warfare

Some families fight to feed three out of five
No equal pay with prices on the rise
Can they survive?

Please take a second before you wine and dine to watch the lower class die
Impoverished families all hopes on the decline watch them die

With empty pockets the workforce marches on
Into the depths of class holes and beyond
Indignant warfare
We will survive!

Please take a second before you wine and dine to watch the lower class die
Impoverished families all hopes on the decline watch them die
