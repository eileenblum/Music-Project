You crossed the line in the sand too many times
With no regard for no one but you
So why should I give a fuck
When you push all your luck and burn every bridge you've came to

Keep stepping close keep stepping close
You have no idea how close youâre getting
To something youâd rather not be partaking
If you don't back up soon
Itâs going to roll right over you
Youâre toast
You better back up fast
Or this round of shit talking may be your last.

Heâs close to toast!

You just canât slide out this time
Itâs too late your ass has been warned

Heâs close to toast

Nobodyâs bailing you out
And this time thereâs gonna be war!
