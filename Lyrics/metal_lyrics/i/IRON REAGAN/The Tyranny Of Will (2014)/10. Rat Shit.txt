Out all night searching for the lucky pick
The one to pay for his sins
This won't be his first time

Randomly chosen by this lunatic
Then the real hell begins
For no reason why

A violent attack
Eaten alive by rats

They rip and tear and gnaw right through the bone
You scream but you're all alone
With nowhere to go

Struggling to survive, a frivolous fight
Millions of rats bury you alive
Handcuffed and gagged deep in this sinister pit
Now you've becomeâ¦.

He's the prime suspect on those coppers list
But there's just no evidence
This won't be his last time

It's been too long he won't stop doing this
A deranged killer hell-bent
On turning humans to rat shit
