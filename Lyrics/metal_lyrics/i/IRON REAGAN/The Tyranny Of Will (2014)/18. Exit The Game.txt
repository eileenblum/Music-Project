All day long you sit and play
Hoping to block out reality
In that world you are the king
But the truth is more disgusting

Every hour that passes is fixed
On getting passed level six
The worlds hard to endure
So you hide behind closed doors

Exit the game!

The screens glow is your only friend
This real life you canât comprehend
A sad case, a common condition
As you sit in your own made prison
Eye fixed into a permanent gaze
Trapped in your pity inflicted maze
