Sometimes I canât get up
To face the day
Some folks just wont let up
And keep bothering me.

I live by my own rules which may bother some
Just because Iâm not like you doesnât mean that Iâm dumb
Iâd rather just set a fire and be left alone.

Iâm a miserable failure
Thatâs what Iâm told
Miserable failure
Much too old
I'm a miserable failure
I donât know why
Miserable failure until I die.

Sometimes I canât get up
To face the day
Some folks just wont let up
And keep bothering me.

Iâm a miserable failure
Thatâs what Iâm told
Miserable failure
Much too old.
