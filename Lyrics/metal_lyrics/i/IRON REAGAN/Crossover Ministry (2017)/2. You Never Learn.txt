Fuck up your parents cut a check
I bet you would never expect
Tonight I'd blast that privileged fucking face right off your head and watch it burn
Watch it burn

Don't give a fuck if they catch me
I won't get off I'm not wealthy
Chicken shits like you hide in your parent's pocketbook and never learn
You never learn

Kill and rape, just pay 'em off
Immoral checks don't bounce at all
Corruption profits from disgrace and money buys the human race
It's sick

You're fucked you brainless trust fund kid
My blowtorch says you burn
