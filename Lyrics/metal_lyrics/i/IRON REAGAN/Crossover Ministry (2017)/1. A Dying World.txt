Plague, anguish, pain
It kills to breath, toxins course through my veins
Welcome to the tragic end of all life

Construct a perfect place
Created living hell

Cannot save a dying world
A dying world
No way to save a dying world

Decay, suffering
Chemical blast, poison air seals our fate
Witness the extinction of humankind!

Construct a perfect place
Created living hell

Cannot save a dying world
A dying world
