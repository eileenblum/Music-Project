Sick of this place I want to be dead with my friends
Sick of this world I want to be dead with my friends
Sick of being stuck in a monotonous pace
Sick of all the words coming out of your face
Sick of my life I want to be dead with my friends
How long should I pretend to care?
How long am I stuck living here?
How long should I keep going on?
Keep going on and on?
Sick of this place I want to be dead with my friends
Sick of this world I want to be dead with my friends
Sick of those always avoiding the truth
Constantly force me to listen to you
Sick of my life I want to be dead with my friends How long should I pretend to care?
How long am I stuck living here?
How long should I keep going on?
Keep going on and on?
If everyone is a puppet
How am I the only one that sees the strings?
How long will this last?
How long should I pretend to care?
How long am I stuck living here?
How long should I keep going on?
How long how long how long?
