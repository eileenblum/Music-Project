Strangers suggesting I keep my voice down
Just because it's 5 am
Not my problem or fault you picked this place to live

Fuck the neighbors
Fuck your yard
The more that you complain
The more we'll go hard

We know you're the one that calls the cops Then politely waves to our face
Not my problem
We'll be the last ones to leave this place
