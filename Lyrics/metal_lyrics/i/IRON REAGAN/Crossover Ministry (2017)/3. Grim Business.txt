Shut down
From constant pressure
The blinding realization
There's no way around it
They've already won
They've already won again

Fucked by this grim business Victimized by business plans
Bought
This grim business
Pave the way for bigger scams

And I think about what's already done
And I'm sure the worst is still yet to come
Is there even a choice for what's wrong or right?

What's wrong or right?
