The losers of a lost war
Strangely glorified
Reminiscing a force of hate
Under the cities guise

Condition evolution
It's time to move on
Condition evolution
Get up or get gone
Condition evolution
It's critical as can be
This condition is your admission to forcing change

Quit holding onto the past
Make progress last!

There's better ways to look back

Disguising your hatred
In plain sight everyday
Glorifying ignorance
Cluelessly mocking me
