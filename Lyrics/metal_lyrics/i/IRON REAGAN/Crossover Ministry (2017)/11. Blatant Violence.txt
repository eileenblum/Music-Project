Religious tyrant mobs
Bow or die is the law
The corpses burn
Forced in a false belief
Slaves in a life of grief
Had nowhere to turn...

Death squads stomp
Crushing the skulls of them all
Blood-soaked boots
Torture, murder, the perfect choice for...

Demonic militants
Mass murder evident
The corpses burn
The innocent now prey
Put to death for glory's sake
Had nowhere to turn...
Death squads stomp
Crushing the skulls of them all
Blood-soaked boots
Torture, murder, the perfect choice for...

Blatant violence!
