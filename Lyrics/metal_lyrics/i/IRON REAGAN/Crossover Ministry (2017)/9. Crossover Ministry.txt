Here, there's no false gods
No need to feel wrong
No guilt to be had
A place you belong
A place with respect
The pits our church
It shall bring you peace
You still may get hurt
Don't fall to your knees
Stand up
The cross over ministry

Here, you'll still feel blessed
Through love all around
Your feet still moving
Your face in the ground
This place gets wrecked
The pits our church
Violence our communion
We're baptized in dirt
