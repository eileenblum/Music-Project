Racing towards Armageddon
We're going to make it so
No matter how you twist your fate
It's plain to see we all gotta go

Heading towards extinction
We're gonna make it fast
The bad news is we'll miss it
The good news is we're not gonna last

It's bleak and fucked
Can we help ourselves?
Is it hopeless yet?
Only time will tell
