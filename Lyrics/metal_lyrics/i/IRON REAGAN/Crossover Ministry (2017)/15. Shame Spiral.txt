Shame spiral spinning out of control
It happened again
It's spinning around
Building and building
Bringing me down
Shame Spiral is never letting go
Shame spiral spinning out of control
It happened again
Continuous spins
Spinning and spinning
Making you sick
Shame spiral is never letting go
Politely retract the statements I've made
Don't reenact the things you've seen
Swear to yourself it's the lowest you will go
Dogsnotgods
I have a whole lot of faith in my heart
And I have a reason to believe
I found an eternal sanctuary
And it's been right in front of me 
I feel the love, I feel the freedom
I've seen all there is to see
I feel the spirit, I don't get judged
It comes unconditionally
