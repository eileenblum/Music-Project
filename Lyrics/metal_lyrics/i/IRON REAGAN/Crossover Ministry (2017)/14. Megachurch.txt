A massive system of fraud
Built upon the word of God
Gospel of prosperity
Just keep sending in your money
A holy pyramid scheme
That will not submit to anything
They're costing us millions
So they can live in their mansions
We all turn a blind eye
Their humbleness is a lie
As they light all their candles
They're ripped apart by scandal
How quickly that they forget
They're supposed to help the poor and the sick
A holy pyramid scheme
That will not submit to anything
On the podium they speak
About giving a hand to the weak
Liquidate their assets
Their separation of classes
But they keep giving them more
More and more
Evangelical eyesore
