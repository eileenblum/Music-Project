A world full of people
Crowded and diseased by
A race so arrogant
Of self-proclaimed knights

As we fall
We don't realise
(What is wrong)
Without knowing 
We stand mesmerized

Where are the answers
For our demise?

A world full of hatred
Destroyed and poisoned by
A race so arrogant
Of self-proclaimed gods

People are always claiming
They're conquering, never sharing
Caring 's so scarce
Unmeasured sacrifice

As we fall
We don't realise
(What is wrong)
Without knowing 
We stand mesmerized

We never recognized
We're not the only ones
If we keep our ways
Our world will die

The people surrendered
Helpless and ashamed
If we do not change
Everyone dies

Conflicts are always rising
Fights are most exciting
Violence grows
The prices are unknown

As we fall
We don't realise
(What is wrong)
Without knowing 
We stand mesmerized
