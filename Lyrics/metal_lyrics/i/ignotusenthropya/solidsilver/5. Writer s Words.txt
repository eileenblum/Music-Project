Forlorn and castaway
I sail the seas of time
All alone, beneath landscapes so dark
Lost in this world,
Disappeared in the past
Trapped here forever, yet still unbound

Open that dusty tome,
Inhale deeply the knowlegde within
Delve into the mysteries
Break the silver chains of time

Fade from this world
Breathe from the void
A gateway to another realm
The thoughts I share
Absorb 'em if you dare
I guide your dreams, control your fears

Control your fears

A pact with the Devil
An entity of ageless past
Envisioned in lost memories
Manipulator of thoughts
Seeker of souls

Embrace that evil tome
Defy your visions of it's dark presence
Submerge into it's spells
Reverse the golden currents of time

Fade from this world,
Breathe from the void,
A gateway to another realm,
The thoughts I share
Absorb 'em if you dare, 
I guide your dreams, control your fears

My Soul...
Defiled...
Will I ever be free?
Wretched, Cursed...
Poisoned...
Only death could save me

Master and Apprenctice as one
Divided by time, entwined in soul
You slowly realize
You have crossed the chasm

Fade from this world
Breathe from the void
A gateway to another realm
The thoughts I share
Absorb 'em if you dare
I guide your dreams, control your fears
