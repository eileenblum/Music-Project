Dawn approaches
The omen of damnation
Delirium flows through the beast with dreadful teeth
The fullmoon on the sky
Enlights so cold and pale
Below it's obscure shine I wake to see
Its time to meet my fate

Ruthless rush through the dark woods
The prey is somewhere close
The trees around me echo
Those rabid, gruesome growls

The blade is in my hand
Solid silver
Man against monster
Who's the hunter and the hunted?

Wrathful instincts
Sense of bloodshed
Before sunrise
Final struggle
of strenght and wisdom
Which will surmount?

Emerging from the shadows
The wolf shows it's face
Fangs, peaked like arrows
Ready to reach out for me

The blade is in my hand
Solid silver
Man against monster
Who's the hunter and the hunted?

Ruthless rush through the dark woods
The prey is somewhere close
The trees around me echo
Those rabid, gruesome growls

Alone I fight
The edge of my weapon 
Flashes bright upon the first dim rays of morning light
Soon it's all over
I behold fear in it's eyes
In final desperation 
It rushes into my final strike

Emerging from the shadows
The wolf shows it's face
Fangs, peaked like arrows
Ready to reach out for me

Solid silver - Stabs right through it's heart
Solid silver - Spills lycanthrope blood
Solid silver - Stabs right through it's heart
Solid silver - The beast falls to the ground
