Synthetized the way we're born
Taken away all our purity
Keeping secrets, hiding the truth
They taught us to be the same

Synthetized the way we live
Taken away our sincerity
Keeping distance, forging the truth
They took our souls away

Mesmerized
Hypnotized
Deceived We are
Without life
Without heart
We'll never be the same
Mesmerized
Hypnotized
Deceived We are
Without a fate
We are detained
Can't break through their lies

Hollow lives we possess
Driven by senseless obsessions
Too blind to recognize
This digital deception

We always lived in tyranny
Lies formed our world, our galaxy
A mortal disease we all inherit
Blinded sight, deafened mind

The oppression of self
Paralizes the spirit
Endarkens the remnants
Of unique thoughts
Conceives the claim
Of joint retaliation 
Surrendering to instincts
We are lost

In the search of a solution
Rationality is extint
Unintentional enlightenment
Potential has been achieved 

Synthetized how we wither
Taken away all our sanity
Secrets revealed, blinded no more
We defeat tyranny

Awakened
Disillusioned
We see through deceit
Revitalized
With firm mind
What was lost we regain

Purified the way we die
Taken back all that we used to own
Secrets revealed, blinded no more
We're prisoners no more!
