[Lyrics: Jack IstvÃ n Rossi]

Keep believing in our dreams was for stupid vanity,
There's nothing more in the darkness, nothing but your cruelty.
I've tried to hold on, while you stabbed my heart
That's why I'm jailed in a box made of past.
Let me go, let me go! Seems there's not escape.
Let me find my way, let me love again.

Nevermore your pleasure-slave.
Never, ever and ever a prey.
I'll be waiting forâ¦

A new day for me to come and to say that the worst is gone.
Your dark shadow and all you've done, will be a past eclipse of my sun.
A new day for me will come, to say that the worst is gone.
Your dark shadow and all you've done, will be a past eclipse of my sun.

You'll never, ever and ever be real.
Can't no more make me weep
A new day for me to come and to say that the worst is gone.
Your dark shadow and all you've done, will be a past eclipse of my sun
A new day for me will come, to say that the worst is gone.
Your dark shadow and all you've done, will be a past eclipse of my sun.

Nobody's toy, not anymore. You've poisoned my soul.
Your dark shadow, your betrayal, is just another scar on my heart.
Nobody's slave, not anymore. You've poisoned my soul.
Your dark shadow, your betrayal, is just what I left outta the door.
