[feat. Giulio Capone][Lyrics: Jack IstvÃ n Rossi]

Lifted up my face from the bitter ashes of what once was,
I couldn't do anything but wonder how the fuck
I survived,
The tribulation of the heart
Some kind of sentence from the stars
A ruthless attack to erase love

Walkin' through these soiled debris and grey rust of what once was,
I couldn't do anything but brood on all that
I have lost,
Annihilation of the heart
Some kind of plague disguised in love
A ruthless attack from the Earth

Disarmed against your fire
This is the end of time
Lasers that burn my eyes
Your sun no longer rises

The day my heart stood still

Draggin' on my wounded limbs through memories of what once was,
I couldn't do anything but wonder how the fuck
I should die
The tribulation of the heart
Some kind of sentence from the stars
A ruthless attack to erase love

Left behind the hate and the bitter wastelands of what once was,
I couldn't do anything but brood on all that
I have found,
The charming imperfection of our hearts
Some kind of redemption from the stars
An unlikely chance to be The One

Disarmed against your fire
This is the end of time
Lasers that burn my eyes
Your sun no longer rises

The day my heart stood still

The one that resist your fire
This threat's built on a lie
Lasers that burn my eyes
No more control my mind

The day my heart stood still

Disarmed against your fire
This threat's built on a lie
Lasers that burnt my eyes
No more control my life

The day my heart stood still
