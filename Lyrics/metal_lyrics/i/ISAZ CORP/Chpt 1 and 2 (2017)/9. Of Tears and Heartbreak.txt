[Lyrics: Jack IstvÃ n Rossi]

That night I went alone,
Where the oldest angels bark
At the moon and stones are wetted by blood and tears
Of my remembrances.

That accursed night on your own
Down the cliff to reach the end
Where there's no heaven, there's no hell
Where all hope is dead and gone

In thy eyes there's no more dreams
The rise of darkness will make me relive
The night when you dashed into the river of tears

That night I rested alone,
With the oldest-evil mark
On my throne stained of blood and tears
Where the undead was born

That cursed night on your own
Down the cliff to be lent
To that river where you'll dwell
Your frozen bed beneath the stellar-dome

Is thy cry what is next to me?
The rise of darkness will make me relive
The dire nightmare that I shaped to hush what I feel
