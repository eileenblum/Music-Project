[Lyrics: Jack IstvÃ n Rossi]

Threat is in between,
Her warm ruby lips
And arch green eyes.
Behind her beaming grin
The spooky grace of a woesome life

On her milk-white skin
An ancient glyph
Hidden by black hair
Perfume of the sin
Her loveliness turns into a crime

Miss Hyde embrace me tonight, take me far away
I know that there's no sun in your messy days
Your lewd bites and your moans that burning inside
Will pierce my heart for the rest of my life

Threat is in between,
Her warm ruby lips
And (her) arch green eyes.
Behind her beamin' grin
Her loveliness is now my shrine

Be my goddess, be my bride

My sweet obsession, mistress of love

Miss Hyde embrace me tonight, take me far away
I know what you've done, but I still love you anyway
Your gentle bites and your moans that burning inside
Will pierce my heart for the rest of my life.
