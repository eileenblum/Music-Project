[Lyrics: Jack IstvÃ n Rossi]

A night out in the otherworld
I swear, it was just like a this
So much nights spent in sorrow
I own nothing but sad memories
There was something strange
I had tried to resist in vain
She drove me insane
But these are just details

She was the overlord
I swear, it was just like a this
So much love in borrow
She recovered all the interests
There was something strange
I had tried to resist in vain
She drove me insane
But these are just details

So another the day has come, the time is now
This heart was dried up, but it will revive somehow
When I had cross the world, under a summer storm
I could never thought to see you go

Seems there's no tomorrow
Seems to live in the abysses
Every cry, I swallow
All her lies and trickeries
There was something strange
I had tried to resist in vain
Still singing this sad refrain
Trapped in my gloomy tale.
