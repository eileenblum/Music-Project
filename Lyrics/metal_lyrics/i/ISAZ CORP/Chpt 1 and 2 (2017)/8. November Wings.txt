[Lyrics: Jack IstvÃ n Rossi]

One last night,
To clear my agony
One last flight
To rid of me, finally
Shaken off the dust
Turned the eyes to the stars
And the wind will drive the fall

(It) dazzles like the winter's light
(It) withers every tear I cried
(It) ices my soul while I was dying
My soul while I was dying

One last night,
To end internally
One last flight
To bleed eternally

(It) dazzles like the winter's light
(It) withers every tear I cried
(It) ices my soul while I was dying
My soul while I was dying

Oh, spread the wings
Clouds are calling my name
Oh, cheated for so long
Just to make me tamed

(It) dazzles like the winter's light
(It) withers every tear I cried
(It) ices my soul while I was dying
My soul while I was dying

Shaken off the rust
Turned the eyes to the stars
And the wind will drain my heart

(It) dazzles like a blessed shine
(It) it pledge to return what was mine
I was doomed in seclusion until I'll die

Oh, spread the wings
Clouds are calling my name
Oh, cheated for so long
Just to make me tamed

Oh, spread the wings
(the) void is calling my name
Oh, bruised for so long
But I've borne the cross in vain
