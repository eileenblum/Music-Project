[Lyrics: Jack IstvÃ n Rossi]

(The) scene was upside down
You've left me on the floor
Why didn't you want
To kiss me once more?

Wounded to the core
You've scratched my back
All night long,
Then left me on the floor

(I've) skipped all mind tips, stunned by your fake love
Bewitched by thy lips
We've played between sheets 'til dawn...

Cold as a tombstone
When you've left me on the floor
Why didn't you want,
Let my life go on?

Wounded to the core
You've shredded my soul
All night long,
Then left me on the floor

(I've) skipped all mind tips, stunned by your fake love
Bewitched by thy lips
We've played between sheets 'til dawn...

The way you loved me
That cursed night when your eyes shined bright
As a waking dream
Through blackest night of a troubled life

Miles away from your heart
When I stare into the space
I still hear your numbing song
As when you crossed that open door

(I had) confronted your wild lips and tried to overcome
The delight of the sin
We've played between sheets 'til dawn

The way you loved me
That cursed night when your eyes shined bright
As a waking dream
Through blackest night of a troubled life

The way you loved me
That cursed night when your eyes shined bright
As a waking dream
(I) think back to your smile for a little while
