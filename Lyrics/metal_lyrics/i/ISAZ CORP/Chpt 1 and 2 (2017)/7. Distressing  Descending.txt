[Lyrics: Jack IstvÃ n Rossi]

How could this be so distressing?
For how long will I roam after breathed my last?
Through these fragments of the past
That you turned into dust.

While diving, into the night
Wounded by what I left behind
Haunted by my old shames
Please leave me, go away

How could this be so exhausting?
For how long will I regret all that I've I lost?
All memories come to hurt me,
Whilst Iâm descending into a black chasm.

How come your ghost still haunts me?
Not even the end was a riddance
How come your ghost softly whispers to me,
From a distance?

While diving, into the night
Wounded by what I left behind
Haunted by my old shames
Please leave me, go away

Oh, these dark stones
That I called home.
Oh, my dreary shore
Testifies your fault

While diving, into the night
Wounded by what I left behind
Haunted by my old shames
Please leave me, go away

While crawling out of the night
Wounded by what I left behind
Haunted by these ghastly shades
Please leave me, go away

While crawling out of the night
Wounded by what I left behind
Haunted by these ghastly shades
Please leave me, go away

In my passing out of the light
Frightened by what I have beside
Haunted by these ghastly shades
Please leave me, go away, go away
