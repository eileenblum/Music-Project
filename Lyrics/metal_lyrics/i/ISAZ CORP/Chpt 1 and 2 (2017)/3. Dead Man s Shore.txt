[Lyrics: Jack IstvÃ n Rossi]

Light
Outstanding
Through the grey
Stormy tides
Nightly shores
Siren's moans
Over the sea - where my whispers live.

Spring dew
Smell of fresh
Scorching blood
Singing boats
Rise the horns
Light I want
'Cause I deserve - one chance more

Blackened my sight
You're satisfied
On a distant port
'Til the end of the night - I'll stay
(I) drowned my dreams
In the sweetest cider
Remembering old feast
And my funeral pyre

Light
Outstanding
Through the grey
Crumbling sky
Dreary shores
Our lost lore
Whipped by breeze - I am still right here

Blackened my sight
You're satisfied
On a distant port
'Til the end of the night - I wait
(I) drowned my dreams
In the sweetest cider
Trapped in distress-maze
Where no lights transpire
