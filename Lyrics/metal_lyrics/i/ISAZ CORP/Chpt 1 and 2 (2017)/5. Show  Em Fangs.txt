[Lyrics: Jack IstvÃ n Rossi]

All these struggles lift the dust,
They thought that there's no life in my fist.

I feel a beast inside, I'm goin' out of my mind
Can't believe I'm the only one of my kind.
Surrounded by dead brains, surrounded by fake faith
I swear, you all will know my name!

All their fears choke their hearts,
They hide and they cannot fight for their dreams...

You will never hurt my side, you'll never wear-out my pride
I was made to fight for my whole life.

It's always been so hard, anyone went to make me fall apart
This troubled life will be repaid with the enter in the great hall
How they cannot understand that we are not all the same brand.
It's time to raise and shine and show 'em the fangs!

All their awes
Now comes truth
Who will be the next line for the whip?

I'll crush them all, I'll burn all down!
I'm seeing red, I'm burstin' out!
I'm marching on,future is mine!
Let's drink their demise!
I'll break it all, I'll burn all down!
I'm seeing red, I'm burstin' out!
Now I want more!Now I want more!

You will never hurt my side, you'll never wear-out my pride
I was made to fight for my whole life.
You will never hurt my side, you'll never wear-out my pride
I was made to fight, to bleed and override.

I'm am the ironside, the rejected, the cyanide
By axe and fire your silliness will purified.
