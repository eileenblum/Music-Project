[Lyrics: Jack IstvÃ n Rossi]

You're gone too far,
But this is not a dead-end
You're escaped from shame
To take shelter within flames
Temptation inside
A shiver along spine
Kneel and confess
First let slip your dress

You'll never gonna see the light again,
Never gonna live your life again
You're captured, tied and bent.

Turn your back to daylight
Here comes your feral lover
Too late to escape, you're mine
Here's your infernal lord

You're gone so far,
And don't need to repent
You don't have to be ashamed
To take part in my game
Temptation inside
A shiver along spine
I will teach you to behave
Taste the juice, enjoy this scent

You'll never gonna see the light again
Never gonna live your life again
You're bound in chain (and) I'll make you beg
I'll make you beg for me...

Turn your back to daylight
Here comes your naughty lover
Too late to escape, you're mine
Here's your lewd overlord

Hesitate for an instant,
You've got nothing to regret
You don't have to be ashamed
To take part in my game
Temptation inside
A shiver along spine
Forget past days and do your best
Unleash your flesh, enjoy the fest
