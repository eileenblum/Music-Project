Time for repentance is over
The ending's close at hand
Soon you all will feel my pain

Wrenching through my body
You too will share this grief
You'll fear my second coming
My darkness now released

You'll never see it coming
The nightmare drawing near
Soon you all will feel my hate

Boiling up inside me
It'll drop you to your knees
You'll fear my second coming
My darkness taking shape

You feel it all around you
Fear
My Darkness coming from you
Let it begin

Your pleas left unanswered
At last vengeance is mine
Soon you all will feel my strength

Around your neck like fingers
Pulling at your feet
You'll fear my second coming
My darkness shows its face

My second coming
You will feel the hate
My second coming
Feel pain
