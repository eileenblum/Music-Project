One by one the words reveal
a tale of past mistakes
One by one the words reveal
a story of heartbreak
Another circumstance
of love to young to wait
So I'm holding on
waiting for... one more day

And all mistakes aside for one more

Now I've found one of your letters
It seems so long ago
The way we left each other
It hurts more than you'll ever know
And I can still feel you beside me
Like a ghost frozen in time
The memories of that moment
Still chill me from inside

Inside I fight the lonely tears
and prayed it washed away
Inside I fight the lonely fears
that haunt me still today
without a second chance
We threw it all away
Now I'm holding on
waiting for... one more day

And I'll swallow my pride
For one more

Now I've found one of your letters
It seems so long ago
The way we left each other
It hurts more than you'll ever know
And I can still feel you beside me
Like a ghost frozen in time
The memories of that moment
Still chill me from inside

And after all of these long years have gone by
The pain remains
The past returns to haunt me once more
Within these pages I search for solice
But it's all in vain
One by one
Each word reveals my mistakes
And more

One more

Now I've found one of your letters
It seems so long ago
The way we left each other
It hurts more than you'll ever know
And I can still feel you beside me
Like a ghost frozen in time
The memories of that moment
Still chill me from inside
