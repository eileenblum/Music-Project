If you've fallen, found you've fallen
It's a lesson learned
Lift your head up, pick yourself up
And embrace the burn

When this life's too much for us
And there's no one left to trust
Within our hands that lift us up
Lies a heart of Icarus

I'll fly into the forever
And I don't care if I burn
I'm looking towards the future
And if I fall it's a lesson learned

Life is calling, heed the calling
At each blinded turn
Lies a future, unseen future
For which I'll always yearn

When this life's too much for us
And there's no one left to trust
Within our hands that lift us up
Lies a heart of Icarus

When this life's too much for us
And there's no one left to trust
Within our hands that lift us up
Lies a heart of Icarus

I'll fly into forever
I'm looking towards the future
