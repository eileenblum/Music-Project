Please cry for me
For I've cried all I can for you
All that I bleed
I pray it's not for nothing
Each selfless deed
I lay humbly before you
And now I see
All I can offer you
Is my pain

You'll no longer have my bloodied wings
To protect you from all that you'll be

Please fight for me
My hands are weak from defending you
And now it seems
This time I must surrender
My end complete
I've given all I can for you
And still you ask of me
But all I can offer you
Is my pain

You'll no longer have my bloodied wings
To protect you from all that you'll be

Somewhere along the way my light began fading
Silhouetted against your storm
With each drop of your rage my strength began failing
And soon will be no more

Please die for me
For I've died inside so many times
Or leave me
And let the wicked take me
What's left of me
You'll find scattered about you
And maybe now you'll see
All I can offer you
Is my pain

You'll no longer have my bloodied wings
To protect you from all that you'll be
Just rip off my bloodied wings
