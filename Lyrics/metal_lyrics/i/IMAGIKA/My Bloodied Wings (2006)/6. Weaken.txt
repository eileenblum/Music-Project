Weaken once and you've fallen
I'm all you ever wanted
Receive my love and affection
At least for the moment

And still you ask once more
To feel my dark embrace
And all the power that I hold
Is more than you can taste

Weaken once and you've fallen
My charms are so tempting
Craving my touch forever yearning
Again used and forgotten

And still you ask once more
To feel my dark embrace
And all the power that I hold
Is more than you can taste

For me longing
Begin to weaken
Now you're mine

And still you ask once more
To feel my dark embrace
And all the power that I hold
Is more than you can taste

And still you ask once more
To feel my dark embrace
And all the power that I hold
Is mine alone
