Indifferent our distance knows no bounds
And I'm so tired of pretending
My weakness, you tear me up inside
As I beg for your lies
Anything to feel again

Pray, we've made it to the end of another day
But still we've failed each other
We are inhuman

Breathe, longing for life in this daily decay
Such a cold bed we've made
We are inhuman

Speak to me, is something on your mind
Your smile's insincere and so uncaring
So full of spite, that sex becomes a weapon
A senseless act so bittersweet
Anything to feel again

Pray, we've made it to the end of another day
But still we've failed each other
We are inhuman

Grieve, mourning the love lost along the way
But still we've chosen to stay
We are inhuman

The passion is dying
We've abandoned our dreams at what cost
Each moment that passes is silent torment

Indifferent our distance knows no bounds
And I'm so tired of pretending
My weakness, you tear me up inside
As I beg for your lies
Anything to feel again

Pray, we've made it to the end of another day
But still we've failed each other
We are inhuman

Breathe, longing for life in this daily decay
Such a cold bed we've made
We are inhuman
Breathe inhuman... breathe
