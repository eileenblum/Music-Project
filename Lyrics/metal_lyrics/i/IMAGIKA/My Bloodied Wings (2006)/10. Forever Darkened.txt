I was never given a choice
Or told what I'd done wrong
And if I was I'd rather have died
It's like a horrible dream
And I'm not waking
Can anybody hear me?

Forever Darkened
Forever Darkened

I'm in hell
Crouched in the corner
A shell of man
Locked behind this mask

Forever Darkened
Forever Darkened

They went and hid me away
Stole my life
And I'll never know why
They shackled me like a beast
Without warning
Can anybody hear me?

I'm in hell
Crouched in the corner
A shell of man
Locked behind this mask

Forever Darkened
Forever Darkened

Locked this mask over my face
Just enough light to see
And I can barely breathe
A brand new kind of hell
My voice is screaming
And the echo's deafening

I'm in hell
Crouched in the corner
A shell of man
Locked behind this mask

Forever Darkened
Forever Darkened
Forever Darkened
