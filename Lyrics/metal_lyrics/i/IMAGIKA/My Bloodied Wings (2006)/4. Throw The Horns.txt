We are one under a single banner
United with a common goal
Let's make this a night to remember
Here's what you came here for
A metal scream ignites the masses
Heads banging as the guitars blaze
Feel your adrenaline pumping faster
We know this is what you crave

So, have the time of your life
Light one up and burn
Now's your time
Metal thrashing mad in an old school way
Throw the horns

Watch the floor erupt into a circle
This is the place where real men are made
Let out your fury and passion
Everything's better with a side of pain
Lost in a sea of denim and leather
Bullet belts and spikes galore
Months passed in anticipation
This is what you've been waiting for

So, have the time of your life
Light one up and burn
Now's your time
THROW THE HORNS!

The lights fade as the last notes rings out
The smoke hangs as you finish your beer
The stage emptied and the club starts to clear out
Standing defiant with your fist in the air
What a night of metal
The band's called out for an encore
They blaze through some of their best songs
Just leaves you wanting more

So, have the time of your life
Light one up and burn
Now's your time
Metal thrashing mad in an old school way
Throw the horns
Now's your time
Throw the horns
