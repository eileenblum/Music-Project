Nightfall closes in
My vision begins to swim
This wine within me awakes
This fledgling vampire strain

Here I wait alone
In a dungeon made of stone
For months left to dwell
Somewhere between here and hell

Chains binding, I'm fighting, paralyzing
Inside I'm dying

Can't breathe lest he hear it
I can't move my bodies weakened
Can only shiver as he searches
For the darkest of all secrets

Can he sense my fear
As the time approaches near
To taste again my flesh
Each night I pray for death

Here I wait alone
In a dungeon made of stone
For months left to dwell
Somewhere between here and hell

Chains binding, I'm fighting, paralyzing
Inside I'm dying

Can't breathe lest he hear it
I can't move my bodies weakened
Can only shiver as he searches
For the darkest of all secrets

(Dear Lord
Release me from this prison
Or send death on swift wings
help me)

Here I wait alone
In a dungeon made of stone
For months left to dwell
Somewhere between here and hell

Chains binding, I'm fighting, paralyzing
Inside I'm dying

Can't breathe lest he hear it
I can't move my bodies weakened
Can only shiver as he searches
For the darkest of all secrets
