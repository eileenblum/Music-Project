Fearful of the hand that reaps
The shadows that trail behind you
The horrors found in dreams
A cold chill fills the night
Strange occurrences surround you
Nothing is what it seems

In the Hunter's Moon
You can feel your heart pounding
Hunter's Moon
Your voice paralyzed with fear
Hunter's Moon

Not another soul in sight
You feel something watching you
Your intuition is screaming
Paralyzed inside
Yet you're moving a little faster now
Don't believe all you see

In the Hunter's Moon
You can feel your hear pounding
Hunter's Moon
Your voice paralyzed with fear
Hunter's Moon
Fear

Moonlight dancing through the trees
There's no cause for alarm
It's just a trick to confuse your mind
Nothing is what it seems
What's that lurking in the dark?
It's just a trick to confuse your mind

Hunter's Moon
You can feel your heart pounding
Hunter's Moon
Your voice paralyzed with fear
Hunter's Moon
You can see the shadows trickery
Hunter's Moon
The night feeds upon your fears
Hunter's Moon
