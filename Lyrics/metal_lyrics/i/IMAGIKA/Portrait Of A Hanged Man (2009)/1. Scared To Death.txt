[Skinner]

Drifting in a sea lost and alone
Water's all that surrounds me
The sun burning my skin
I've been swimming for hours on end
Looking out for land
I don't know how much longer I can
Until the ocean takes me
Out of breath I try to scream

Sinking... sinking

I'm going down
Scared to death
Fighting so hard to breathe
No one around
Scared to death
Beyond my wildest dreams

I feel my body sink beneath
I close my eyes and don't dare breathe
The light grows dimmer as I see
My life slip away from me

Gasping for a last breath of air
Calmness upon me I release my cares
Thoughts of what will be
And of the world I'll no longer see
I slowly extend my hands
An act much braver than I am
Without a chance to think
I open up and take a drink

Sinking... sinking

I'm going down
Scared to death
Fighting so hard to breathe
No one around
Scared to death
Beyond my wildest dreams

I feel my body sink beneath
I close my eyes and don't dare breathe
The light grows dimmer as I see
My life slip away from me

I'm going down
Scared to death
Fighting so hard to breathe
No one around
Scared to death
Beyond my wildest dreams
Scared to death
Fighting so hard to breathe
No, no not a sound
Scared to death
