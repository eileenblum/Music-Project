[Skinner]

Something wicked draws close today
Death is coming to play
Focused come what may
The right price has led me to your door
I'm here to settle a score
It's nothing personal

Here I come so silent
Your fortune decided
Body caressed in black
Prepared to attack
Here I come so silent
Your fortune decided
Body caressed in black
Prepared to attack

Hands behind your back on your knees
I am immune to your pleas
Pull the trigger with ease
Forgiveness is not mine to give
I do not pass judgment
On the crimes you've commit

Quiet, this is not personal
Violent, God bless your slaughtered soul
Silence, you're reaping all you sow
The hit, clean and professional

Here I come so silent
Your fortune decided
Body caressed in black
Prepared to attack
Here I come so silent
Your fortune decided
Body caressed in black
Prepared to attack

Quiet, this is not personal
Violent, God bless your slaughtered soul
Silence, you're reaping all you sow
The hit, clean and professional
Quiet, this is not personal
Violent, God bless your slaughtered soul
Silence, you're reaping all you sow
The hit, clean and professional
