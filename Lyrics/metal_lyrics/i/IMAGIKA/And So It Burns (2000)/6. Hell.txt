Low behold the ground is rising
Just before the dawn
From the bowels of hell it's blazing
Evil clips the sun

What's going on ?
Time stands still
What's  going on
A loss of will

Devils become the night air
Circling where man is bound
Demons ravage out of hatred
Killing, raping, all is damned

The great secret show
Lies the angel reveals

Flames engulf my corpse
My soul descends
The gates of hell are open
Leviathan

What's going on ?
The price for fame
What's going on ?
I sold my name

Devils become the night air
Circling where man is bound
Demons ravage out of hatred
Killing, raping, all is damned

The great secret show
Lies the angel reveals
If only I'd known
Damned your soul is the deal

Sin
The pit of doom is despair
Slave
To the lord of the darks' nightmare
Whoed
My spirit was the secret show
Lies
Something for nothing too good to be true
Life
A sense of hope gone forever in you
Cries
Pleading mercy only knowing I'm to blame
Years of glory - An eternity of pain
This great and secret show
