The Antichrist
The one who's fallen
He stands alone with fire

He speaks to me
With words euphoric
My head it swoons with desire

Welcome to the first day of your life
A choice you made a long time ago
No need to plead it will get you nowhere
Vanity is what gave you my control

Hosanna on high
Hosanna's now to die

I wake to see
I'm wrapped in horror
My crimes are read by death
The rain is blood and the sky is jet black
The fallen one writes another epitaph

Hosanna on high
Hosanna's now to die

The holy Christ
The one who's risen
He stands upon his cloud
The book it blinds
The word is given
I fall into the abyss

[2x]
Welcome to the first day of your life
A choice you made a long time ago
No need to plead it will get you nowhere
Vanity is what gave you my control

[Chorus]
