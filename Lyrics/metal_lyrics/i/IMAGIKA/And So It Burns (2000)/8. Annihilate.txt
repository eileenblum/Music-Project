The judgements of the last day
My nightmares come to excite
But little can I delay
As this world lights the fuse to ignite

My veins explode with venom
And my heart is poisoned black
Massacre disintegrate
This rotten filth, which our kind creates

[Chorus:]
It's my rage infiltrate
This deadly stage annihilate

Blood streaks in the back of the mind
Waiting to torture enslave
To damn you into hell
Lustful motive decapitate
Racist to pedophiles necrophiliac
You're satanists and lunatics
The rapist with the twisted smile

[Chorus 2x]

The horrors of our kind
It drains me inside our
I want no part of your world

Explosive blow concussion
Psychotic mayhem
Promote the thieves to murder
Exterminate then mutilate them

'Cause my veins explode with venom
And my heart is poisoned black
Massacre disintegrate
This rotten filth, which I create

[Chorus 2x]

Deadly stage... deadly stage !
