Child I see you here
Candles flicker than weep
Intoxicate I feel the hate... humanity
Mesmerized love it weaves alluring pain

Darkness has come
Tantalize the graveyard

Spaces between shadowed lights
Places spirits can hide
They bide their time
And wait for you to call upon
Life they crave it captivates
We share the throne

Darkness has come
Tantalize the graveyard

Twilight lost in a trance
The headstones all around you
They dance
Staring eyes they tranquilize
The burning light
Feel the cold you're losing hold
Say goodbye

Darkness has come
Tantalize the graveyard
Darkness has come
Trapped between the graveyard
