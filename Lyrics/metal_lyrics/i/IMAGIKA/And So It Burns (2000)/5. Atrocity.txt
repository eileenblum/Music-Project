Torch the land destroy without pity
Tables turned legends disperse the enemy
Battle of the undead rise from hell
Broken graves desecrate all humanity

I can see iniquity
Close the door
From this...

Visitors below the ocean floor
Contact made science we trade a hidden lie
Virus spreads so changing death to life
Cannibalised nature defiled destined to die

I can see iniquity
Close the door
From this atrocity

Ride through the trail of your mind
Hide in the mirror of another lie
Speaking truth when all is said
I wish you all the dead

Soldiers of the damned the fight is lost
Consume the brains to release the pain
That's how they won
Armageddon the battle at Megiddo
Man now extinct our bodies they sink
Into the sea

I can see iniquity
Close the door
From this atrocity [3x]
