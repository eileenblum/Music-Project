In the land of the blind
The one eyed man is king
And a little nonsense now and then
Is relished by the wisest man

Your fire down below
Abandon ship

Toy with words
Words toy with you
Back and forth
What's false is true

Turn around
Around your turn
I'm up and down
So cold it burns

Walk the blade inside the mind
Dance or crawl you'll fall in time
Puzzle out mutated labyrinths
Backward forewards who's losing to win

You fire down below
Abandon ship
Fire in my head
I'm losing grip

Toy with words
Words toy with you
Back and forth
What's false is true

Turn around
Around your turn
I'm up and down
So cold it burns
