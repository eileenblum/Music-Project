My blood dip very fast
Nothing I can do anymore
The act has been done already
Now only wait...

I start not fell my body
My hands sweating and cold
My body freeze fast
I try to move nothing else obey me...
Anymore

What I did?
Only now I release
If I cold go back
Now come I left it happen
My life pass by my lays
Thoughts I can't even cry...
Anymore

Everything is getting darker
I fell my last moment alive
My pain and agony not even...
Start
