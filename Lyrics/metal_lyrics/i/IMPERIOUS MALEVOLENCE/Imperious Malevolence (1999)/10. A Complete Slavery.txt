Crazy thing... Made in the name of your god
Manipulating... Ignorant people to abominable things
Looking only... For power and money

Temples have been build
To alienate the illusion
Controlling ever felling
Controlling ever thought

Absurd promises thought your mind
Your body and your soul
Religion the best way the man found
For his own alienation

Be careful... with your faith
Can take... you to a complete slavery!!!
