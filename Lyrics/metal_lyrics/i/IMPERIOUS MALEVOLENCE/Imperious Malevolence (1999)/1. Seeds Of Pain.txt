What matters the blood
That pours out of my wrists...
...if the sorrow that torments
My soul still consumes me?

I am own revenge, and behind the light
Where the shadows don't exist. I am
I am not an accursed poet anymore
Who fills up his mouth with blood, hate and blasphemy
Against everything and everyone
I just spread what's the truth in this world

The eternal pain

Severance madness revenge
Martyrium fear suicide
Suffering blood the death
All the hell of this world is contained
In the secrets of my mind
And it's not difficult for you
To try to disclose them
Cause what I say, is also destined four you...
And these severe words just confirm

My blood existence
