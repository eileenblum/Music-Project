Every instant happen disturbance
People degladiate themselves and kill the each other
Many times for no reason
Either for absurd motives
That's no way to stop it
It's a natural effect
From the self survivance
To kill or to be killed?

There is no more conscience left
Ignorance and hate dominate all
To kill or to be killed?
The death seems to be only way out

One way step to go no way
A trip without return
To kill or to be killed?
Would it be the solution?
