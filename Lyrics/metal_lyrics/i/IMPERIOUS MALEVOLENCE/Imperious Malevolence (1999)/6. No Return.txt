Multiladed bodies
Deformed faces
Thousands agonizing
Claiming for the death
Many still trying
To find pieces
Of their own bodies
Spread everywhere, no return!!!

No body can act rational
There is no time for it anymore
Soon everything will restant again
Screams of pain and revolting all over

The only thing can be seen is the blood
The earth is red, no other color exist
The red dominate every side
The reason was lost in the middle of so many bodies
This time the destruction expected
Has been achieved, no return!!!

That's no way to stand up anymore
This war on everybody
Nobody will be stand up
To tell this history
