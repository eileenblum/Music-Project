Fear devastate every body
Beasts hungry of blood attack again
Another victim of your madness
Does't breathe anymore
Everyday more bodies are found
Each time more awful death

In each dawn new ways of killing are found
Without knowing why
What makes these animals kill
Torture and lead their victims to the most deep pain

 Agonizing until their last sigh
As their screams of pain were music
Music that conforts their blood thirsty souls
About to attack other victims

Faster than a lion who destroy it's prey
An endless way of slaughter
The nightmare doesn't stop
Tomorrow will be another survival day
There isn't mercy anymore
The route of death starts again
