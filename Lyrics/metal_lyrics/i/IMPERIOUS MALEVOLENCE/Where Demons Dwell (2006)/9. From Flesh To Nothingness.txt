Look into the eyes of death
Blinded by the shine of light
To be dead is forever dream
Close your eyes and return to me.

From Flesh To Nothingness.

Entrails on the altar
Atrocious sabbath
Lament of the week.

Blood and wine I shall devour
Drink the venom of the sacrament
Prepare for divine carnage
Crush the bones of the lamb of god.

Listen to the rites of fierceness
Burn the coffin to be purified again
Breed of blessed shall not remain.

Chaos...forever

This is a war, I will be victorious
I take yous life, I got your soul
They call me death, lord of tombs
No walls nor gates, could make me stop.

Entrails on the altar
Atrocious sabbath
Lament of the week.

Blood and wine I shall devour
Drink the venom of the sacrament
Prepare for divine carnage
Crush the bones of the lamb of god.
