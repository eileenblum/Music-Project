Evoking demonized spirits
Storming over storms
I am the snake
My eyes have seen  rites of lust
Reveal to me seal of Abaddon.

Nails within your flesh
Embraced by plague and filth
Father of Divine Disease.

Rebel maniac is who I am
The one who burns and cast disgrace.

Pestilent debris shades
Transcend this fallen earth
Irreligious killing troops
Hellish legion march on.

Thy mortal god I shall kill
Fell the crown of thorns and iron stakes
On the damned cross
Lucifer shall stand before me.

From chaos I am
Rising from the Necronomicon
Worm of Golgotha will downfall
As divine presence fade away.

Nails within your flesh
Embraced by plague and filth
Father of Divine Disease.

Pestilent debris shades
Transcend this fallen earth
Irreligious killing troops
Hellish legion march on.
