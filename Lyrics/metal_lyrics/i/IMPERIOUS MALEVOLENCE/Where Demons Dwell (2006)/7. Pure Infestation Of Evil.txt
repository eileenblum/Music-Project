Letâs fuck!
Beneath my flesh
Legion reigns supreme
Burning my  heart
The venom within me.

We raped the culture of mankind
Became it black
Creatures with horns evil gods
Sacrificial dawn.

Carnal beast inside
Vortex of pestilence
Marching over flesh
The horde of impiety.

Pure Infestation of Evil
Drowning in agony
I am a demon!

Manifest of wrath
Wicked  presence
Pestilent seed
Of raging plague
Suicidal winds
Mark of the beast.

Satanâs sword crush those of above
As I shall fly into the pentagram
Carnal beast inside
Evil god.
