Dream of sacreligion
Smashed mayhemic doom
Blood of fallen Christ
Runs below their pathetic cross.

Demons with tongues on fire
Branding angels with hate
Cult of Nazarene
Exterminated by holocaust and pain.

Cast down from heavenâs paradise
Surrounded by thousand torment and flames
Descending into utter darkness
Hereâs the place where you belong.

Icon of Filth

Sanctified in contradiction
Mass illusion â the redemption
Lunatic twisted faith â fuckist.

Blood on blade and stench of death
I prey for beast â no redemption
Christians hunted until end of life â Satanstikes.

In the dawn of annihilation
Blood of fallen Christ
Runs below their pathetic cross.
