Evil spirits celebrate
Darkness ursup the throne of temple of light.

Hate was made for me
Reign of cross debauchery.

Fallen angels of death arise
In hell kings of madness calling my name
Leading Christians to the lions
Enslaved rotting Jesus sodomized.

Love was made for fools
All pain of Christ wonât be enough.

Martyr on cross
With nails in your hand and feet
The lord is dead
Carnage with his bones and flesh
Terror on heaven
Vengeance wonât stop so fast
Satan lives on
Black hordes drowning in sin.

Horns of beast rise !
Death of god be done !
We are The Christcrusher !
