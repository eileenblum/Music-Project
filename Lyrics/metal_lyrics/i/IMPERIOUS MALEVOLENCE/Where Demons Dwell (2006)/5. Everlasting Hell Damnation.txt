Wake up my friends
Letâs burn Christâs church
And celebrate the darkness.

Rise up Oâbrothers
With souls on fire
Walk with us in blasphemy.

Hellâs legion march
Under evil stare.

Restless spirits of the inferno
Spawning terror over this land
Enraged with hate for angels of god
Woe be this world!

Behold the horns of Baphomet!
Ride on the wings of Azazel !

Jesus beggar in
Everlasting Hell Damnation
Imperious Malevolence
Raping the ears of those above.
