Here they come marching down
Underneath sorrowful land
Midnight Death Bleeding.

Desperation fills your hearts
Blasting blows world below
Midnight Death Bleeding.

Enemies of everything
Cast hellâs seeds to worms erupt
Midnight Death Bleeding.

Age of pain
And genocide
Nuclear winds
Consume the skies.

Nihilistic entity
Raise the dead
To kill for me
Evil spheres
Demon eyes
Nazarene bleed for me.

Here they come marching down
Desperation fills your hearts
Enemies of everything
Midnight Bleeding Death.
