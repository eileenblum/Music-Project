Primordial spirits of darkness arising from begotten seas
Universe of damnation in madness awaiting the legions of doom
Beginning of the end, no time to regret, Armageddon is here
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest, infernal expansion

Sigil of chaos in spirit and bones in solitude reborn
In six spheres of death and destruction shall be created
Angels of light burning at dawn world cremation
No one knows, no one hears what Iâve said

Machinery of death
Bestial engines of flesh
Mechanized Belialâs march
Upon creation spheres

Apocalyptic annihilation
Under a grey storm
Mechanized Belialâs march
Upon creation spheres

Dead blinded master
Pestilent entity
Pure blackest hate
Against the angels of God

Decimate...Let the divine carnage begin
Excruciate...Relentless lust of bestial wrath
Incinerate...Let the angels burn to ashes
Lightning...It leaps upon Nazareneâs Funeral pyre
