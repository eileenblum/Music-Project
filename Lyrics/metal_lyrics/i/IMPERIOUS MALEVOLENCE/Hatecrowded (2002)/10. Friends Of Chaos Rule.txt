Death gods, kings of chaos and madness
Transform me into a demon
Lead my souls wings
Towards your kingdom, of sin and fear

Once again the day is surrounded
By a Black Vulture
Banishing all the rays of the sun
That shines in the sky
Like itâs never really
Had a reason to exist
Demonic Dark Dimension
Satanâs Consciousness

Father of the bloody homicidal
Listen the grinding of teeth of  a  cursed soul
Father of the desperate suicidal
Embrace the soul of one castaway chosen

I still hear terrible screams
I am the true essence of horror
And in the delirium and spells of the night
The sea of disgrace goes on...

[Lyrics Rafahell]
