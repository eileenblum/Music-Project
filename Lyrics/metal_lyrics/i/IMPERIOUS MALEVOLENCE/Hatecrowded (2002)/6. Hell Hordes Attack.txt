After years of complaisance in his dungeon
Hereâs revealed your sentence
Wretched and harsh
Though fair for a weak
Into darkness
Where the Malevolence  dominates

Guilty  for  your own actions
Charged by your own shadow
Now you scourge
Nourishes with blood
Spirits of a Dark Era

See the Nefheim gateways
Being opened
Legions of witches and demons
Now attack â Taking revenge with fire
On the persecution -In the inquisition

Feel the grudge  thatâs threw as anathema
Then heresy flows as  chaos
Reaping lives â lewd dance
Desperated about Death

[Repeat 2nd verse]

Hell Hordes Attack!!
Now!!!

[Lyrics Rafahell]
