Listen what I say
Lamentations and martyrium
Falling from the skies
Suffering and disease
Walking through this world
Is this promise of your god?
Black visions show me
The accursed day, the fall of heaven

Hell on earth
Fire in the sky
The opening of infernal gates
Peace? There is no peace
When your hypocrisy dominates you,
Pain and anguish.
My sorrow wasnât created
To be understood, I suffer
But you will suffer too

Who are you???
Why so many suffering???
But my soul is immortal!!!
And your god is dead!!!

Now the ruins and the corpses
Arenât yet only pale visions
Created by the shadow of death
The blood of your tears
Bathes the earth sphere
Youâre blessed with forgetfulness
Hereâs your Eternal  Martyrium!

[Lyrics Rafahell]
