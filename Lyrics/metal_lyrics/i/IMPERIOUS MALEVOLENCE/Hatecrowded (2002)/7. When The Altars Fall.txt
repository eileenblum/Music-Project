When the veil of the temple is torn
When darkness start to wrap the world
And all Christian altars fall
There will be the time

âThere wonât be better daysâ

The star called misery
Hurls down unto the earth
You will can see the flaming skies
Now turns black
The sacred sign will be stained
With blood and tears

âThere wonât be better daysâ

Despair and trouble
Come  over   us
That will be your time
Your world is lost.

[Lyrics Rafahell]
