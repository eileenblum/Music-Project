Beyond the gates of the horizon, I am
Where there is no light, neither
Life or lamentations, unluminous being
And the infinity is my time, in this place

Like a titan among the giants...

Then, reject your blindness, your armour
Because this was
Forget in your mind
And walk bound, for the fountain of death
Crossing the fields of sorrow and hate
Of solitude and bitterness
Of life and death
Gloomy and macabre, are the paths of life
My revenge, inherited by you

My words will be your words
Strong and sharp as the sword steel,

Where there is no light, neither
Life or lamentations, in this place
Beyond the gates of the horizon

[Lyrics Rafahell]
