Arising through the fire
The fire eyes that surround and condemn
Like a black thorn nailed in your heart
I see the grief painted in your eyes â staring

This time of war and sin
We abdicated light and love
On time of your suffering and sorrow
We execrate your decayed god

Kill me before betray me
Try and watch my victory

Arising through the storms
That in the means of his vortex
Reveal the secrets of death
This death thatâs true and eternal life

Turning immortal sublime souls condemned
Which in cursed nights spreads the silence
Through the shine of the moon
Reflected in the blood of your carcass
Perception in ember â fainted by mystery

Kill me before betray me
Try and watch my victory

The weaks and cowards heritage
Is to be condemned to forgetfulness
Through Aeon
Is the confession of their suffering
Is their definitive karma

[Lyrics Rafahell]
