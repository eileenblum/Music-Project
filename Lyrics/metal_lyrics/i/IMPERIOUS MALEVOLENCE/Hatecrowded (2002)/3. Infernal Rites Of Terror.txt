On the boundaries of loneliness
Where all my secrets are
Out of your reach
My thoughts confuse you
Making your reason blackened
Trapped in a gloomy atmosphere
I awake for death

Trapped in the ends of the inferno
Tragic and ghostly will of destiny

Infernal Rites of Terror

Opening the gateways of death
Dimension of sad memories
The Judgment Day is coming
Demonic spirits capture
Lives through death
Death through eternity
A black storm forever

Thatâs the beginning
Of an age of wrath
Thatâs the feeling
Of revenge and hate

Infernal Rites of Terror

Demonic spirits capture
Lives through death
Death through eternity
Youâre trapped in a black storm
Forever!

[Lyrics Rafahell]
