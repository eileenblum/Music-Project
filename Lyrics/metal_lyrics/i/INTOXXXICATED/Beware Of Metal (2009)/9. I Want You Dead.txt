I see your world falling down
Your holy sky is turning black
And thereâs a cry in you heart.

I see your world falling down
Your holy sky is turning black
And thereâs a cry in you heart

Think, youâre dead
Start your agony
Your fear feed my fuckinâ hate
Pain smashes your face

I am the one who wants you dead
I want you contaminated blood on the floor
And kick your empty skull

DIE FAST!!

I made your laughter love me in your grave
I will rape your blessing
And she will scream my name
Pain smashes your face
Donât you get it? Think!
So real, so pathetic, so false

I am the one who wants you dead
I want you contaminated blood on the floor
And kick your empty skull

DIE FAST!!

I see your world falling down
Your holy sky is turning black
And thereâs a cry in you heart.

Iâll be the one who bury your smelly corpse
With your holy words
I canât save you now
Wearing the scars of your lies
With your holy words
I canât save you now
Wearing the scars of your lies

I see your world falling down
Your holy sky is turning black
And thereâs a cry in you heart.

Iâll be the one who bury your smelly corpse
With your holy words
I canât save you now
Wearing the scars of your lies
Iâll be the one who bury your smelly corpse
With your holy words
I canât save you now
Wearing the scars of your lies
