Confusion, I only see deception
A broken heart in the mirror, but with dark infernal behavior
Surrounded by hollow eyes

Can't dope my anger with your lies
The gun is here
There's no feelings, detonate my trigger
I try to forget this life, try to suffocate my mind
Something arrive my memory and stop me from behind

I only know a way to escape; I need your ears to rape
Wait for my penetration, my unholy adoration.
It's better than a fuckin' drug. I'll crush you like a bug.

Ahhhh!
Its sounds better than life
Ahhhh!
Try to feel my blood
Ahhhh!
It's sounds better than life
Ahhhh!
Now I'm into...

Intoxxxicated I live for this
worshiping metal and your mental disease
Intoxxxicated, alcoholized in vain
Thrashiping metal just play it in my pain.

Intoxxxicatedâ¦I live for this worshiping metal and your mental disease
Intoxxxicated, alcoholized in vain Thrashiping metal just play it in my pain.
