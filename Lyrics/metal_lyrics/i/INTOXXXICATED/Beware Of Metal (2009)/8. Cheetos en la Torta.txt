I can not deny
This is what I like
Traveling near or far
With the fuckinâ thrash band!

Drinking all the time
Slamming until die
Fucking in a car
Cheetos en la Torta!!!

I came afraid to this bloody world, I found a please to
Release my pain
I join a band, four of a kind. Thrash to destroy thrash metal war.
This is what we do, we donât follow rules.
We just drink to lose our heads, we just came to thrash this place.

I can not describe
Itâs like the metal sign
Itâs like the fucking horns
Of Satan lord!

Four fuckinâ mad men
From a nasty basement
Working day and night
This is what we want!

We are the ones that make you head bang
We are the ones that kill and thrill and fist, fuck, cum, kill
Thrill and laugh at you!

I can not find some peace of mind; you most release the beast in me.
Open your eyes this is my life; open you eyes now your
Inside

I can not deny!
This is what we want!
Playing fucking thrash!
CHEETOS EN LA TORTA!!!
