You can run but you can't hide, your eyes don't lie
The truth is here, can you see it? Can you feel it?
It's with you.

Don't look the empty sky
Is not your place evil in your veins?
Don't look the empty sky
Is not your place evil in your veins?

Think in you just one last moment
And discover the wasted time
Reflex, don't listen fool
Hear what I have to say, you can't live hiding your feelings.

Don't look the empty sky
Is not your place evil in your veins?

Make your brain vomit the words of the priest
The cross is in your ass, don't be blind, believer of emptiness
Break the chains, for freedom your heart screams.

Don't look the empty sky
Is not your place evil in your veins?

You can run but you can't hide, your eyes don't lie
The truth is here, can you see it? Can you feel it?
It's with you.
