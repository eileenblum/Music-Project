I know you read the holy words lines with the meaning for you're life
Preaching the wisdom of the sick 'cause you want to be free
I know you are the weakness, the fools who believe in paradise
'cause god is the reason of your war the machine that kills

The earth finally rest in peace
Where's the light of your hope?
Now you're alone, can you see it?
'cause you want to be free.

Understand the reason of the slaves for conviction
On total destruction of the earth
Come and see the human race!
Now is dead because the lust!
Was stoledâ¦from your god!
See and smellâ¦the corpse
The putrefactionâ¦of the brains!
Can you see it? ...Is in the air!
Ha, ha, haâ¦smell the stench!
Know your own conviction.
