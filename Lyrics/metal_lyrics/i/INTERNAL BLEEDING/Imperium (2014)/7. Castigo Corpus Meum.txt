my path to absolution
is found within my screams
I must achieve redemption
to have my soul be clean
I offer up my body
my skin is free to thee
I'm sacrificing my flesh
my faith grows as I bleed
self inflict empathy
pain is my homage
shackled and tormented
to feel worthy
on my knees
arched back
the lashes commence
kisses of leather
rub flesh
I'm at peace
bit my lips
and taste my flow
and clench my fist
and swallow
the agony
I watch the day
before my eyes
slip into
a tortured paradise
I feel his swath replace my blood
the masochist's worship
man's diseased
his hedonistic ways a plague to all
I'll show them the wrath of god
I pray for thee
their salvation and uncertainty
I'll show them the wrath of god
father forgive them for they know not what they do
lost
wayward
fall to earthly vice
I surrender them to you
castigate my body
strike my flesh
save my soul
mutilate my body
this vessel
of damnation
castigate my body
burn the flesh
blind thy eyes
anticipate
my elevation
salvation I shall rise
rise
the ecstasy
of my misery
from the purging of
my impurities
rise above
my mortal need
for faith and love
and worldly greed
