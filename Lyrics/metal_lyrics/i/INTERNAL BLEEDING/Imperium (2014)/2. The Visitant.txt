salvaging the remnants of my sanity
staring back a tortured version of I used to be
clock exhausts a minute nine
soon I return to recesses of reality
I am a prisoner of my own mind
soon I invite a never ending serenity of death
bodies torn apart
the children burn
the dancing flames beckon me
feasting on still beating hearts
orgy atop the defleshed elders
pain absorbed unwillingly entices me
vicarious display of what I can never be
lean to the left my purpose now defined
epiphany bequeathed upon me
my mental state
a chosen trauma
sweat cascades
profusely
I shan't resist the sadist's siren
wanton thoughts embalm me
all the years wasted
serving the consensus
hoping my reward waits in agerlife
humans are voracious
endeavors are contentious
never to obey and be patron to a lie
now refute me the ills of my philosophy
exist in the act of the theater of the absurd
a world without hate
connotates the irony
causing misery and feel the remorse
the visitant
lies
greed
envy
sloth
one cannot survive
without the other
all the years wasted
serving the consensus
hoping my reward waits in the afterlife
sign of the time
enslaves me
it traps me
vicarious display of what I can never be
moving to the left my purpose now defined
the epiphany bequeathed upon me
the visitant
