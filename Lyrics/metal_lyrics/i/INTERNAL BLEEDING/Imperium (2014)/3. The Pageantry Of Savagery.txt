Just as a child that requires nurturing
Forces inside us compel us to ascend
Past accountings paint the mind a picture
Lesser still sufferâstrong becomes the victor

Tribulations verify theory's veracity
Realization of an unsavory necessity
People must fall for the ones in wait to rise

Indoctrinate the next inheritants
The students of malfeasance will propagate
Forces of the diatribe escalate
Compelling ignorance into a feverish pace

Study man's depravity
Fear tears through your shadows
Decimate equality
Pageantry of Savagery
Divorcing reality

Abhorring society
Paranoia breeds
The sociopath
Psychosomatic

Panic feeds the susceptible mind
The scenes of horror
Respect it commands
Projections so majestic
Formulate the twisted
Plan set forth to rid the world of those who are deemed, unfit and malcontent
Unfit and malcontent

Wasted
Burdensome
Siphon on society
No more allowed
To infest with treachery

Utopian vision doesn't seem implausible
Utopian vision doesn't seem improbably anymore

Hands rise from the ashes
Chance to survive
Defying all logic
Pageantry of Savagery
Realization of an unsavory necessity
