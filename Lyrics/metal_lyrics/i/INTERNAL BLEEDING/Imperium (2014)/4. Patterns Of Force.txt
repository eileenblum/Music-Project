[I. The Discovery]

in this new world
a brotherhood of man
the epoch of tranquility
spread throughout the land
but below the surface
lies cruelty and hate
and the ancient animosities
that bind our fate
the long dormant texts
of a madman's mind
plan for unraveling
all of mankind
the wisdom I have found
shall brant unto me
the knowledge to implement
the age of hostility
you shall worship me
in prayer on bended knee
come to me
gather thee
helpless ones (covet me)
flock to me
bow to me
swear to me (fealty)
fight for me
all for me
die for me (incessantly)
slaves to me
never free
eternally (in misery)
implement the plan
of ruling this weak word
with blood and sacrifice
our flag shall be unfurled
desecrate the land
and bathe yourself in sin
fight till your last breath
I command you to begin
in communion with my words
compelled masses start to rise
in lockstep they marched forward
towards harmony's demise
movement born of hate
progeny of a father long since dead
soldiers swathed in black
just waiting to be lead
the time has now arrived
to victory
I compel thee
the future dawns
humanity's legacy of violence is now a distant memory
lost in the mists of time
peace, contentment and conformity
utopia has achieved
but there are those who still abhore these virtues
men born of a different time
who long for strength
and lust for power
zealots who seek dominion over the weak
with the knowledge of the past unlocked
they seek imperium
through genocide and war

[II. Plague Agenda]

dawn of a brave new world
devoid of those deemed weak
subhuman rabble disposed
through the retribution I seek
morning rise
the troops amass
the lines now set for the first wave
a haunting silence coats the land
while in the distance tanks crush the sand
buffer the lines with the kidnapped man
masses gathered
the storm approaches
propaganda feeds
feeds the feeble minds
assembled en masse
to do their bidding
sacrifice to quench
sacrifice to quench the greed
dominoes the bodies fall
these human shields
killed by their own
hospitals harbor the artillery
awaiting the unknown
houses of the lord
blown to pieces
for the caches they conceal
the visage of a god
fails to exist
in these winds of war
too many still die
those to be spared
already chosen
war
merely slaves
merely slave for the reconstruction
pace of death needs new direction
seek new methods of mass extinction
horrifying seed kills regardless of gender
enter phase two
plague agenda
eyes open
to new possibilities
smiles paint the faces of the elite
through it lethal efficiency
now die
my children
this victory
sacrifices
sacrifices thee
dehydration paradox
drowning by thirst
blood seeps from every pore of the skin
aborting all birth
doom the unborn to death at birth
a lifetime lived in mere hours
mothers clench the weakened children
as the agenda devours
their world

[III. Aftermath]

upon the horizon shows
plumes of the residu
of a bloodbath
the horror of the death toll grows
pure impotency of the opposition
falling to the enemy
inviting their defeat to ease the anxiety
soldiers valiantly defend the impossible
waiting for the kill shot to achieve the inevitable
such unreal weapons
that appear improbable
no hope of surviving
victorious
a nameless corpse
discarded as human flotsam
victor rejoices in celebration
revel at the images of the foe's devastation
propaganda appears to vilify
mankind
the infidel
mankind is the infidel
new world shall rise
new world
shall thrive in the aftermath
invading forces assess their holocaust
lesser beings
slave forever
destined to serve
weak ones
those who die allegiance
to the god that never comes
waiting for the god
that never
comes
the discovery lead to their existence
plague agenda decimate the power of the enemy
new perfect world shall rise in the aftermath
