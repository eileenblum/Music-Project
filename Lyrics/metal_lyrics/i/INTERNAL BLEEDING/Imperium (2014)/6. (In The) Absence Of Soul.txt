existing
with no morals
no compassion
no respect for what his eyes can see
the center
of importance
holding himself
to a level no one achieves
he is the paranoid
scorn the egotist
excoriate the pure worship
a new deity
free of will
no wall
fall to thee
branding himself
a messiah
bow to his foul words
his presence reigns supreme
he's the one who decides who breathes
judge and jury
an inquisition
with blood
he rids the world
those he deems unclean
his rapture now begins
he's stalking
he's blinded by a 
rage so consuming
hate so compelling
stench so revolting
mankind sickens him
race undeserving
creed in need of purging
none escape the terror
mankind sickens him
this child must die
the product of a cretin
union cannot exist
these are the words of your lord
dissection of the min of a madman
juxtapose the core
of his darkest seed
force fed
taste of betrayal
as neglect culminates into which we fear
slice of the martyr's blade
his vision is portrayed
painting his masterpiece
with his peers
this emptiness cannot fill
no matter who he kills
set expectations low
cannot
fail
this wicked child
achieve the convoluted logic
we owe him a lot
downtrodden
beaten
neglected through life
bow down
to the nihilist throne
the scars that he bares now tags his victims
absence
purity dissolves in the absence of soul
