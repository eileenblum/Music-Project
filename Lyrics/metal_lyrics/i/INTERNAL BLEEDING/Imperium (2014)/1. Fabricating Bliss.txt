In my mind's eye I can see
a pitiless fantasy
simphorophila all consuming
driven by insanity
lust, excitement, perversion, pain
can't stop
the pounding
in my brain
I am drawn to the macabre
I get enthralled by others pain
arousal is achieved for me
through sights of human carnage
I can't explain the thrill for me
the smile adorned through tragedy
the sickness afflicting me
has intensified proclivities
cacophony of voices streaming in my head
contemplate the majesty of what they said
tingle of my skin as pleasure touches me
ecstasy abounds
the catastrophe
my morbid
fascination
feats to feed my sanity
a gifted imagination
to satisfy my lunacy
I must now create
my fantasy
give birth to the chaos
commence the havoc

build my dreams
plan the scene
anticipate
it's killing me
the fear I see
a drug I can't resist
the misery
way they flee
disorientate
it's sex for me
it's ecstasy
fabricating bliss

fire burning
ground is in your sky
screams so deafening
the moment that you die
climaxing with
every stretcher I see
the humanity of my peers
no longer a concern to me
the joy of tragedy
reflected in my eyes
burning flesh
twisted steel
hasten your demise
ecstasy is building with each tormented scream
the precipice of that moment where I achieve my dream

simphorophilia
all consuming
simphorophilia
this sickness
simphorophilia
afflicting me
simphorophilia
arousal achieved
simphorophilia
thus is my life
