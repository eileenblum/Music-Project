scores of the population die
no one contemplates its meaning
simply dismissed as inevitable
final phase in life
complete exhaustion of the soul
man lives completely benign
apathetic to the moment
when time comes to take its claim
lamb's blood fills its coffers
henchman rise
behest the masters wish
absolve
pay the homage
appease the gods
sanctify
as the elders punish
blood of man their sustenance
to tame the wrath that lies in wait
to tame the wrath that feeds on hate
to tame the wrath that seals our fate
to tame the wrath that we create
all the violence
man inflicts upon himself
holds a solemn purpose
all the hatred
satisfies their need to feed
death our dowry to the liege
we must suffer to save the world
from horrors never to be seen
rampage of minions
never to be thought mythology
weapons of the gods once horrified
never to be thought mythology
now is full of murderers
reality
world awakes
to a horrid exposition
ungodly entities rise and breathe
the skies turn gray
with creations of fiction
hammer of the gods bent on ending humanity
besiege for our insolence
tridents wielding fire
rivers of blood to feed the beast
talons tear the flesh
rolling meadow of the dead
avenge the heresy
the armistice was broken
when one life prevailed
with the stench of the weak
the cycle never grew to fruition
reiterates futility
man kills man with impunity
elders now rise from their slumber
placate the ancients
suffer to insure existence
placate the ancients
bleed or life will cease
