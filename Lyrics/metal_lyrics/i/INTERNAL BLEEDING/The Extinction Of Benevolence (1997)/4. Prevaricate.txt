Spit out lies!

Backstabber
You were my friend
So I thought, not anymore
Friendship shot, lying cheat
You faithless whore

Unity and strength
We thought we had has disappeared
Tempers rise, breakdown walls
Hatred has flared

Help me to control my anger and rage
Fighting, we must engage
Stand up, youâve faced your match
Loyalty has now been smashed
Bonds of steel have been broke
Contempt has been cloaked
Arguing and no one wins
Prevaricate, Iâll smash your grin

I am the one to see your soul
You are the one who is so bold
I am the one to point this out
You are the one to cause me doubt

Liar, traitor, creates haters!

Youâve made me enraged to the point
Where I do no want to know you
Iâll get my revenge, you pompous fool
Youâll eat your own words, I promise you
Time has come, you will now see my rule

Fuck you!

You are the one who has hurt me
I will make sure that you will never flee
My conscience is now warped with murderous thoughts
And they all have been directed at you

Bow to me now, repent your sins
I see your face, now you know that Iâll win
I have no remorse as I hold you down
And I beat you to the ground

I am the one to end your pathetic life, you fool
I am now at peace, knowing that you no longer walk this earth
I have now learned that you were a mistake since birth
The chains are broken and I have taken on a new form
Now I feel complete that I can continue my life
