Destroyer of earth howls in the dark
Taking my claim infinite power
I reign upon immortals taking in all that exists
Refusing you god, god of illusion
Resurrect the exalted one

Into foul place of death
Begotten realm of eternal thirst
I reside within him, devouring the divine
I am the light, truth and the life, bread of life
My words in you

Illuminate the first magic
Adjunction of eternal will
Quenching my thirst for power
Pronouncing damnation

Upon you, subjects made unto me eradicate
We laugh at you
Your âevilâ gods, an amateur existence, exterminate
We laugh at you
I am the god you shall not fear not (living a dream)
We laugh at you
Begotten one, obscure creation, exterminate
We laugh at you

Agents of chaos unfold the true heritage

Copulation with the spirit
Invert your rituals
Distort your holy laws
Call the infinite splendor

Vanquishers of death
Subject of my covenant

Forgotten ones let your bornless life emerge
Mad god of chaos remember
What binding spell has brought thee here
Ever burning one moan unto me
Heralds of the pestilence, of the burning gods

Empowerment identify self as god, who art thou?
Who sears and enchains
Devourer of flesh and madness
Deliverers of my vision
May the dead rise and smell the incense!

Watcher of the gate
The highest vision remembered

He who awakens calls the ancient power of the infinite
He who is lost to the outside will offer the final death
I am the sun, red water of life, I am the shepherd
Lord, spirit that remembers

The bread of life
Wrecker of the light
I am the chosen
Children of the forgotten world
Give birth to forever
Through our words
I give its existence
Slash the planes into the infinite
