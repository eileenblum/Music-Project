Life of debauchery
Orgy of ecstasy

Sex and lust has been bastardized
Another female has been victimized

Cycle of vehemence

Stifled cries in the night
Tear off clothes with delight
Arousal of perverse thoughts
Blade placed upon the throat

Thrusting in and out
As she screams and shouts
Another woman defiled

Beat repeatedly
As the blood flows silently
He smiles at his host
Vile act achieved
While the prey twitches violently

Morbid scorn consumed
Filled by the need to abuse

Desire to rape and torture
No care for repercussions
