Trapped within this spiral torment
I have now unleashed my hell
As I stare through my dimension
Pained emotions start to swell

Struggling with this intent to kill myself
My life is worthless, something Iâve always felt
No one cares about me, so why should I?
Gun to head, knife to throat
Now itâs time to die

Scorned by my peers, my friends, my family
This is fucked up because they should be helping me

I am the one who puts myself through this shit
Razor in my hand, my wrists will be slit

I must realize what this is doing to me
Selfish meditation, canât I see?
Happiness is what I need
It is my wish but thereâs too much pain
When Iâm plagued by catharsis

I am the one that feels this pain
Rain-fallen tears are not my gain
Self-pity is something I hate
Now it is time for a clean slate
Making a mark is what Iâll do
Keep on pushing, death to the fool

My life, no longer black
Iâve got myself back and itâs time for me to change

Self-pity is gone
I now feel strong
To conquer all that is thrown at me

Feel the power of my soul
Now the future is my goal

Plagued by catharsis
I will rise above
Plagued by catharsis
Standing proud

Plagued by catharsis
I now understand
Plagued by catharsis
My reign at hand

Release myself unto this world!

My repressed rage will now take form
My new being, I am now born
Living in this state of anguish is no longer feasible
True to myself I am living, it is getting easier

I am happy because I now hate
No more sorrow, bring forth this trait
Weight is lifted from my shoulders
My feelings are growing colder

No longer plagued by catharsis
Now my rage is getting stronger
Erased thoughts of my once loved

I will not allow myself to get close to anyone

I donât need your sympathy
Content in my misery
Just leave me alone
