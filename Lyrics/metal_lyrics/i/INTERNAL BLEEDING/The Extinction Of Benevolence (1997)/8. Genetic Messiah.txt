Virtually real, but so far from reality
Savior of silicon
An icon to manâs stupidity
Lost faith in our father
Built our own, in our image

The Genetic Messiah
Conscious electric deity

Coupling human DNA to artificial intelligence
Heroes and criminals from the past brought to life artificially

It guides our lives, it influences our thought
We are but sheep, living to please its will

Individual thought is a sin
Pleasure is a capital crime

All of us please our new lord
Produce, perform, satisfy its will

The Genetic Messiah
Bow before its omnipotence
The Genetic Messiah
Praise our electric god

War is inevitable as our new messiah exerts its will
Millions will die in the worldâs greatest crusade of all

Hate is what it thrives on between us, thereâs a bond
No such thing as free will
Its intent is to kill
Collection of human beings
We are its playful things
It controls us with ease

Malevolence, jealousy, spitefulness
Are whatâs inside of it
Severing ties from man
Earth will be a wasteland
Slaughter of innocents
People are mere peasants

Kill! Rape! Main!

We deserve this fate
We think weâve recreated the lord
We shall pay for our sins
Burning in a thousand years of flames

Power of its twisted mind
Weâre not worthy, we are blind
Pawns to its destructive nature
The lordâs power is less greater

I have risen!

Feel the darkness
Closing in...

Hitler will pale in comparison
Atilla will be seen as a saint
The Genetic Messiah
Our beloved god of hate

People are dying, children are crying
Darkness envelopes the earth
Tortured people scream as their faces bleed
The messiah now breathes

People dying, children crying
Darkness swallows the earth
Tortured people scream
The messiah now feast

Kneel before its power
Our new father of time
The lord created the universe in six days
The Genetic Messiah will destroy it in one
