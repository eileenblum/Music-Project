You blame me for all your sorrow
Take a good look at yourself
The temple of hate you built is
Supported by pillars of ignorance

Hatefuel [4x]

Speak with two tongues
See through blind eyes
Listen with deaf ears
Nothing but lies
[2x]

Hatefuel - You're fueling
The fire within me
Hatefuel - you're hanging
Your sorrow on me
Hatefuel - you'll soon feel
The power within me
I'm burning with anger
And righteous truth

Unrestrained fury- armed with the truth
With strength of conviction - I extract punishment
Possessed of clear vision - I see through your lies
The violence my resolve - can be seen within my eyes
Oppression is the God - you worship to - and revile
Indoctrinate the young - mislead the weak- and the poor
Corruption of belief - belies the hate - of yourself
Cultivate the seeds of jealousy and despair
Lack of - vision - short of - wisdom
See beyond yourself - beyond the West - inside your soul
To the Mecca that you built - to house the lie - that's your life
Don't blame me when you fail to lift yourself - from your fate
I gave you all the tools and still you stab me in the back

In the back

Look - back - what you created
Rise - up - make a difference
Look back - at what you have created
Rise up and make a fucking difference

Hatefuel - you lashed out - and hurt me
You tested - my will
Now you - shall pay

Hatefuel [4x]
