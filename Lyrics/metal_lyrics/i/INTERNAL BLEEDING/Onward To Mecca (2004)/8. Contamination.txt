We are a nation on the brink
Propaganda creates the unrest
That shakes foundations
Primetime TV bring us
Flesh dripping from bones
We all watch until we are trained not to feel

[CHORUS:]
Upheaval - violent rise a puritan
Cleanse this land - unleash crime
Weed out the weak
Contaminate - the enemy
Puritan passion for war
Let innocent blood - moisten the sharpening stone
Humanity put to rest - in every nation
Not one death will be mourned - no longer counted
Contaminate - human waste - earth's every corner
Communist - terrorist - no longer matter

History - rewritten by a common man
Heaven and hell - die on earth
Heaven and hell - die on earth

[SUB-CHORUS:]
Contamination
No apologies
Contamination
Ruthless unleashing
No refugees
