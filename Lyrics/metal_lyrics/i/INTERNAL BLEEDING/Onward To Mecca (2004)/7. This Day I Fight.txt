Born and bred to kill at will - for this cause
The times come to pay the price - for our loss
Will not be led to defeat - by your lies
This day I fight and you're - dead to me

Forty tons of anger and fire
Is erupting from my chest
It's time to pay it's time to die
This is American fury

Born and bred to kill at will for this cause
This day I fight and you're dead to me
I'll take back what is mine
For this I'm ready to die
You can't convince me I'm not right
I've chosen this day I fight

Arm yourself
Bare hands won't right the wrong
Sacrifice - victory through violence
I'm willing to trade - I'm willing to die
I'm ready to trade and I am ready to die

Take a stand don't be
Separated from your life

Stand up and take back your life
This day I fight
