Cut down- bleeding as innocence lay dying
Revenge - is the only thing that you see
Small price to live inside a cell
You'll die and it will be by my hand

For those that suffered
Our hate grows stronger
For those that suffered
Our hate grows stronger - Now you'll break down - you will scream
You will stare for one thousand yards
Broken by brutality - broken by brutality
Unequaled evil - within me
Awakened neck deep
In numbness - focused and violent
Disregard - for life
Alive in hell [2x]

Your whole life is suspect
Intolerance - conspiracy to overthrow
Intolerance - outright lies and savagery
Intolerance - I'm screaming out hypocrisy

You gave your life for nothing [2x]
I - am a product of your hate [3x]
Despite what you done, say and do
I will always see through your lies
