Your simple thoughts delude your mind
Steal your soul and leave you blind
Obsessed your own misery
Without hope you cling to me
Your attempts to harass me
Leaves no guilt on my psyche
Weakness masked in a world of lies
As tears drown your childish cries

So tragic your weakness
Pathetic ways of life
You dread the time you spend alone
Won't see the truth you've been shown
Let it be known I hope you die
As payback for all your fucking lies

Pathetic - obsession

The world know your game
That you are insane
Lie to all you see
Stories constantly
I have all the proof
You can't fight the truth
I have all the proof
You can't find the truth
Fuck you and die

[CHORUS:]
I'm so far above you
You have to lie
Condemned by the truth
Imprisoned by your lies
I'm so far above you
You have to lie
Condemned by the truth
Imprisoned by your lies
So far - above - you - you
Lie - try- cry - die
[2x]

Far above you way beneath me [2x]

[CHORUS]
