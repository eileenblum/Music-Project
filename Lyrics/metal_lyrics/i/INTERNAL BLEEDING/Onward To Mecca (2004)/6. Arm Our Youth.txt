War is waged - every fucking day
In the hearts and minds of our young
Black is wrong and so is white
They must be prepared for the fight of their lives

Blood in the street and social descent
Freedom is raped every fucking day
Imprisoned - hands tied
Too afraid to live their lives
They don't have to live this way
They don't have to die this way
You shouldn't let them live this way
You shouldn't let them die this way

Bleeding - it's a wound that will never heal
Clawing - at the soul of society
Hatred's alive walking the streets
Hunting you down right where you sleep
Bleeding - it's a wound that will never heal
Bleeding - it's a wound that will never heal
Hatred's alive walking the streets
Hunting you down right where you sleep

Defend your home, defend with force - we must arm our youth
Don't leave one thing to chance - we must arm our youth
What are we being taught - we must arm our youth
We'll never see things this clear again - we must arm our youth
Wage your war - wage your war
This is a call to arms
Wage your war - wage your war
Tensions are mounting [2x]
Times of testing are coming
Don't be frozen by fear
Survive - survive - survive
Survive - survive - survive
