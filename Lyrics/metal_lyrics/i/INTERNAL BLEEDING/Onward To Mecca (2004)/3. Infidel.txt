You awoke a sleeping giant
Now deal with the wrath
Site set on the East
Laying waste to all in its path
There will be payback
All life will cease
We rain down fire
We are the coming beast

[SUB-CHORUS:]
I am all you hate
An eye for an eye
Bringer of death
The prophecy

Slaughter - I'm killing with precision
Not leaving one soul to chance
All heaven can't stop this now
As hell is unleashed on earth

[CHORUS:]
Infidel proudly - and I wear it like a badge
Infidel proudly - succumb to my rage
Infidel proudly - overthrowing your cause
Infidel proudly - and I'll bathe in your blood

[SUB-CHORUS]

You've tragically misconceived my power
Now take your place amongst the dead
The fate of the world is at stake
As I piss your life away
Mass murder
Forced starvation
Agony
Annihilation
[x2]
