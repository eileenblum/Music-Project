In this season of death
I am my own weapon
Resurrect our spirit
We can't be divided

[CHORUS:]
Cut to deceive
Defiance of threat
Determined
Learn to resist
Absence of cause
Compelled response
Exploited
Learn to reject

The time has come to
Take up arms
The time has come to
Bleed by example
[2x]

Essence of reflection
Arrogance of anger
My reaction response
Deploy all my hatred - hatred

You show that we're few
Encamped and improved
Now I challenge you
Let me see you bleed

The masses unafraid
We can't be defeated
The masses are prepared
We can't be defeated
[2x]

[CHORUS]
