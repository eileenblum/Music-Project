Living below ground existing in fear
Hours of madness the ending draws near
Hellish inferno of fire and steel
Seventy-seven days of the unreal

[CHORUS:]
Siege in the clouds - withstanding
Unending days of hell
Siege in the clouds - surviving
Beneath the mud I dwell
Siege in the clouds - I'm longing
For this to end I cry
Siege in the clouds - no warning
When the next soul will die

Misery and death
Amongst human trash
Await my last breath
In my mud-filled world
Fear
Eats away at me
As rats gnaw my flesh
Maggots dance macabre
On the friends who fell, fell...

With each day comes a loss of will
Why must I live among the killed

Friends who've gone - are the lucky ones
Those who live - just await their death
Does it end? Will I die this way?
Must I want to draw my last breath

Forget me - write me off - I am gone
End it all - stop the pain - I want out
Friends all gone - torn to shreds - before my eyes
Please God why must I be in this misery?
Misty days - ice cold nights - living hell
Hatred tears - as it burns - through soft flesh
Pray for food - cry for drink - gasp for air
In my home - deep below - the vile - stinking earth

[CHORUS]
