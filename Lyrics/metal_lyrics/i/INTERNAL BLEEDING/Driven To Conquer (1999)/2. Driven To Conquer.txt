Those who share our dreams of a new world
Marching line by line toward our fate
Subjugate the poor, enslave the weak
All those who oppose shall be ground into dust
On this hallowed ground we stake our claim
Victory or death before dishonor
Those unfit to live shall be erased
Plague of human trash cleansed and relieved of life
Driven to conquer destined to succeed
Driven to conquer for selfish needs
Driven to conquer hunger and greed
Driven to conquer on victory we feed
And if I shall fall
Will you carry on?
Struggle for our cause
Pursue victory!
Justice and freedom
For those deserving
Triumph through force of will
Destroy those who hold us back
Persevere or die
We triumph!
Let nothing stop us - destroy
We shall overcome all odds
Driven to conquer destined to succeed
Driven to conquer for selfish needs
Driven to conquer hunger and greed
Driven to conquer on victory we feed
Weakness overcome, replaced by strength
Covered in glory. Victorious
Defeated masses crumble and fall
Hatred burns our souls
Driven to conquer all
