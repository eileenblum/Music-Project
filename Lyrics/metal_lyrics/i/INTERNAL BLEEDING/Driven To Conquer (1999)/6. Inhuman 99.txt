Oppression in thy master's name
Leaving only you to blame
Die alone in your sin
Waiting for the depravation
Feeling the searing pain as your mortal soul chips away
Devoured in a flame that burns with hate
Your crucified mind stops as you slowly die
Repentance for the slaughtering of God
Beyond those hallowed crypts lie cursed souls of the damned
Prophets of damnation, rulers of the dead
Now you shall join them
in the crypts of the dead
Your body before you slowly turns to dust
Your presence is fading in a well of scalding blood
Your soul sacrificed to the master of the flame
Banished. Inhuman suffering, your afterlife
Inhuman torturing, inhuman suffering
Afterlife, torturing, inhuman suffering
Your afterlife, inhuman torturing
Inhuman suffering. Inhuman suffering
Wrath of God on your flesh, on your soul
Fear His holy coming
As you shall not inherit this Earth
Your years of tyranny
Of your misbegotten life
Inhuman suffering. Inhuman suffering
