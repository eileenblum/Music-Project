Choking clouds of death
Drift across the land
Mustard gas burns lungs, blisters flesh, ends life
Grotesque spasms
Wrenching up blood
Thousands lay dead in the trenches
Soldiers drive forth
Break through the lines
Strongholds have fallen
Many more to die
Stalemate broken
Anthem for doomed youth
Testament to man's greed
Bloody mud clogged with death
Gears of war grind poor souls
Anthem for doomed youth
Testament to man's greed
Pulverize human flesh
Trenches filled with dying souls
Accepting death without question
Years shall pass by
Will we learn?
Are we so blind to such waste?
Will we ever learn from the past?
Pain, misery, death, suffering
