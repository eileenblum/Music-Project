Betrayed
Fought your stupid war and died for you
Thoughts awash with blood and pain
Suffering through loss of pride
Humanity is stripped away
Conditioned to hate
Returned to empty arms - abandoned
Nothing but vacant stares - neglected
Feel my rage start to grow - hatred
I'll show you what I know - prepare
Conditioned to hate, conditioned to hate, conditioned to hate
Pre-programmed to kill
Conditioned to hate
Pre-programmed to destroy
Now you'll feel the burden I bear
Gave me no compassion - fuck you
Watch me as you die - fucking traitor
Look into my eyes see the rage
I reached out for you
you left me there to die
You closed your eyes to hide
As thousands more died
How could you be so cruel?
How could you abandon me?
Left my soul in that world
Never will I get it back
Conditioned to hate, conditioned to hate, conditioned to hate
This is my fate
