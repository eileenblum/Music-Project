You destroyed my being and my sanity. Tried to break my shell through the slaughtering of my family. You ran away unscathed, but not for long. As I wait in my asylum, temporarily my mind is gone. You had better fear me. I'll make your life a living misery. Once I find you I'll punish you unmercifully. I will feel your pain, an orchestrated symphony of cries. But now I wait, you'll soon die. Sitting here alone, I wait in the darkness, plotting my revenge. When I find you my family will be avenged. Motherfucker. You will submit to my punishment. As I wait in limbo I know this isn't it. Dreaming of a time when I have a piece of mind. A time of dreams and pleasures, a life without crime. Now I'm over the edge, towards the brink of insanity. But now it's becoming a part of me. I'm starting to enjoy this new existence and loathe all of humanity. Hate monger inflicting pain. Through years of waiting I'm finally free. Fooled all around me, into believing I'm sane. Now begins my trek, into this torturous game. I know where you live, where you sleep/hide. After these years, you thought I was away to die. My hate increases, my spirit is renewed. I feel alive again, ready to strike soon. I can taste your blood and your pain. This punished existence is a burning flame. A flame of hate, sorrow/grief that's embedded in my name. Oh it will feel good to tear you apart. Limb by limb your flesh will be sore. You will scream in anguish and I will punich you more. I've got you now bastard, in my clenching grasp. You can't escape me as you breathe your final gasp. Your life is being snuffed out with each slashing gash. Your screams of torment excite me more and more. Your life's now over in a flash. Now my quest comes to an end. Is it over? Or is a new beginning at hand?
