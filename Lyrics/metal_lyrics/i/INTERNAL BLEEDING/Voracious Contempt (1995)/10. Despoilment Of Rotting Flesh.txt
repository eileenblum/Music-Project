Quietly you rest, waiting for the light. Six feet below reality, where the world is so black. Eagerly excavate partially rotted body. Pry the wood casket open and see what's waiting for me. Body/Sight now to behold. Bove your bloated body and love is all I see. I penetrate the folds of flesh, a chill creeps from your thights. Despoilment of rotting flesh. Pumping, pounding, motionless you lie below me. All you see. All you see, me. You're the only one who loves me. All you see. All you see, me. All you see, everything is cold. Pumping and Pounding again and again. Your cunt is dry. Feeling a love that is out of this world. All for me. Feel the love burning inside me. Things are pointed to, pointed to me. Things are out of control of your body. Restless thoughts well through me. Pump and pound below me. Scream. C'mon scream for me. Where the world is so black. C'mon scream in misery. All my love lost in this paradise. In the Act of Despoilment. Waiting for the Infinite Being. Come to me.
