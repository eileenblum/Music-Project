Altered from man to a living nightmare in a blink of an eye. All my hopes and dreams are just passing memories. Despair and depression are where I find my sanctuary. This pain is now taking control over me. Burned all over my body, I now resemble a faceless corpse. My body has been emaciated away. Barely any skin to keep my life bloods in. I am now skeleton in nature. Bone showing right through my charred limbs. Once a human, now a freak of nature. Dependent as a child. How I wish for death.  The stench of decay is setting in.  My flesh burned beyond recognition. Lightning quick pain searing through the walls of my skin. My body spasms with every strike from this foreign entity. Stripping me of my defenses. I am a helpless mortal. As my life is slowly being drained away. No one hear. Not a soul in sight. Now I can embrace death. With open arms I tear loose these tubes and machines. My body contorts in deathlike convulsions. My life is now coming to an end. Drakness is setting in. But the thought of being at peace has become my dream. Now death wraps its arms around me and I drift off towards my destiny.
