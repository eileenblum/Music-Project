I dominate the hell blackened night. We now destroy arcangels in their flight. I am Thanatos. Prowling in the shadows. Messenger of Hades. Extinguisher of light. Sealers of your fate. I dominate the hell blackened night. Cross the styx. Cross the styx, for you must die. Eternal torment, demonic cries. Cross the styx, for you must die. Eternal torment, demonic cries. Face the cenotaph, blackened and burned. A monument for the victims of those, who never learned. Lord of Suffering, Prophet of the blasphemies. God of hell's fire. consequence of your fate, destined to perish. I shall now rape the innocent and the pure. Let forth the horsemen to spread their wretchedness. Famine &amp; Disease. Pestilence &amp; Death. Baptize the Holy world in my righteous name.
