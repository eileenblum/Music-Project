Torture. Flaps of gutted flesh upon the altar. Hunger for flesh we seek. Spellbound victims for my ritual. Eviscerate, innards clogged with blood. Sacrificed to King of Hades. Ceremony of death. He from the depths, rise from the filth. Receive the holy word. Desire to strip the bones from your flesh. The songs deliver my soul. Crush breath of life. Overlord manifests. Summon the foulness. From the wretched depths of the burning pit. Now death is all you see. Ejaculation of the black beast. Now we feast upon your flesh. Necrophobic lust, engrossed carnage of the young. Strips of tattered flesh, torn from your bones, now we feed. Feed on the young. Pray to your god's fiendish hands for me, now. Plundering your rectum for my god's of the pit. Reign. Brutal stabbing of the virgin in the face, you're left alone. With the slaughtered corpses, come with me towards doom. It pleases me to hear the screaming bodies for my bloodthirsty god. We fiend for sounds of gushing blood. Embrace my theme womb. Open the gates. You're gutted. Sacrifice.
