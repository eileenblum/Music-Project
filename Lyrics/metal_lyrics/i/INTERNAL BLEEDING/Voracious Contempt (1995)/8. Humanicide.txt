Secrets from the past denied. Plague is spreading far and wide. Biological warfare, sentenced to death without no care. Liquefied organs, blood from eyes. Hemorrhagic fever intensifies. The only thing certain is death. Lesions over body, mutating cells take over within the hour. Systematic shutdown, there is no hope to see tomorrow. Horrors to man. Will the government gain the upper hand? Transmit the final phase. Germs are spreading like wildfire. Government breakdown 'cause of liars. People rounded up like cattle, to wage war, the final battle. Humanity is dying. All hope is lost with no great cost. Greed is too strong, man has been wronged. Faceless facade, pray to your god. You have now confessed your sins, there is no hope for a win. Death will be the only cure to make the earth once more pure. Faceless facade. Where is your god? Armageddon is now here. Judgement of the living. Mercy for the dead. Rest in peace.
