Oppression in thy master's name, leaving only you to blame. Die alone in your sin, waiting for the depravation. Feel searing pain as your mortal soul chips away. Devoured in a flame that burns with hate. Your crucified mind stops as you slowly die. Repentance for the slaughtering of god. Beyond those hallowed crypts lie, cursed souls of the damned. Prophets of damnation. rulers of the dead. Now you shall now join them, in the crypts of the dead. Your body before you slowly turn to dust, your presence is fading in a well of scalding blood. Your soul sacrificed to the master of the flame. Banished. Inhuman suferring. Your after-life. Inhuman torturing, inhuman suffering. Wrath of god on your flesh, on your soul. I'm inhuman suffering eternally. Fear his holy coming, as you shall not inherit this earth. Your ears of tyranny, of your misbegotten life.
