Hypocrite. Ignorance is what you preach. Owing more likeness to a separatist. Hating others, while lacking intelligence. Streams of prejudice reach far and wide. It is a fear that you do hide. Violent urge towards a certain race. Human population is disgraced. The glass shows no imperfection as you bathe in a reflection of ignorance. Create something that is hidden unremorceful presence. Initiate deadly intentions, reflection of ignorance. Righteous man, or so he thinks. Deceiving others has been achieved. Freedom of expression. Freedom of thought. Freedom to hate. Is that what we've been taught?
