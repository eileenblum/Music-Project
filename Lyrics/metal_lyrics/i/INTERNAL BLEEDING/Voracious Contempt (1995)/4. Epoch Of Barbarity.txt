Barren. Wasteland. Devoid of life. Barbarity reigns supreme in this land. Nirvana is burning, man's fate at hand. Lord Jesus crying. Father god dies. Famine and bloodshed, amongst the desperate cries. Humanity's greed, corrupt to the core. Slaughter for power/profit from war. Epoch of barbarity, man against man. The evolving of humans to fit Darwin's plan. Feeble fools wait and see. Kill yourself, while facing nihility. Crushing the weak, feast on the skin. Delicacy of man's flesh, the ultimate sin. Feeble fools wait and see. Feeble fools wait/see. Epoch of barbarity. Feeble fools wait and see. The shadow of death looms-eclipsing the now cold sun. The horsemen they ride again in search of the Nazarene son. Rivers running dry, the earth is parched and cold. Dying by the millions, like the prophecies once had told. Epoch of barbarity. The world will surely die. Tears of sorrow flow, like rain from the bleeding sky.
