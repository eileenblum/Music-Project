Snowdancing
Possesses my soul.
I am slipping
On the snow.
My blue heart
Is white with horror.
My sweet dream's
A dream of sorrow.
I wish
I were not an owl -
Keen and strong
Until the dawn.
My fear
Will disappear
When I know
That the night is near.
But I'm shot
By a fatal arrow,
A sniggering gnome's
Caught in the snow.
He's sneering me down,
His mind snow-bound,
He is my lot,
A snake in the snow.
His smouldering soul's
Smothering my hope.
Smiting me with horror
He's getting in my road.
But still snowdancing
Is everywhere around.
The snow's falling down,
It's touching the ground.
It reigns in the world,
It's whirling about.
It's reinless like a wild horse,
It's soft as down.
It says:
"I'm so close,
But you cannot see me,
You hear my coming
While your body's dreaming..."
