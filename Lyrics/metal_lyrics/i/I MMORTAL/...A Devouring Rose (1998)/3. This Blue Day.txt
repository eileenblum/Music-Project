This blue day
And the darkest night
I've ever seen.
Silent trees
And the endless road
of mindless dream.
Taste of sorrow -
I try to escape my
broken way.
Wait for tomorrow
For I don't know
who I am today.
Stand by me
If you want to face
the troubles yet.
Run away
From the hundreds men
you ever met.
Be yourself,
For you've still got something
in your heart.
Paint the dawn
That divides night and day apart.
Crying rain -
You're saying what you really mean.
Sinful wine,
You play on the game
you'll never win.
Cracking wall
That has words of prayers
written on.
All I had
I held in my hands
and that has gone.
