Imprint with shame
The trace we leave 
Foreseen events of
The omen of creed
Desecrated image 
Our purest gift 
Save us from perdition 
Grant shelter 
To those after me

Repentance, now itâs too late 
Maintain equal balance
Between nature and men
Chastise upon us 
Feast on the holy flesh
Bleak halo, dark, unclear 
Martyrdom of the weak.

Mesmerizing achievements 
As the deluge couldnât with thee 
Standing on the 7th seal 
The countdown will reveal 

Fools the penance is here
Fools perished shall be
Soldiers and knights 
On bent knees 
Awaiting the demise

*Thus heaven Iâve forfeited,
I know it too well.
My soul, once true to god, 
Is now chosen for hell. *

[* Adapted from The Pale Maiden by Karl Marx]
