You think you own this land 
Cause you are a mammal 
Who developed more
Than the others around 

Covered your parts, 
With an exploited carcass 
And ruled above men
Enslaving everyone else

The ecosystem failure 
Caused by your greedy nature 
Shall consume your fossil fuels

And see the massacre 
The true disaster 
Mass killing murder

Capacity of production 
For the sake of consumption 
Never ending story 
Of a species full of glory 

Yesterday as today 
Nothing will ever change 
We wrote in stone 
The way we want our end 

This goes on
Full speed beyond 
Itâs time to confront the cancer 
Which is humanity itself
