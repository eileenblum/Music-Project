Unrecognizable 
Stands the man
Behind the lectern 
Whose distorted appearance 
Turns inside out 
Stubborn demagogy 
Seduces eyes like a spell  
Death incantation, 
A sentence to the night 
As a part of the rite
Refused to deny 
The atrocities, 
Grim portent 
In a dim light 
Thirty-three steps
An imminent impact 

Begotten son 
Of the pharaoh 
Inherits the throne,  
Chants of brothers 
Fire burning bright 

Casting shadow 
On the unlight 
Following orders 
In Molochâs commands

âLift up your heads
Oh ye trees
And be ye lifted up 
By everlasting spires

Here is bohemian shrine 
And holy are 
The pillars of this house
Touch their world-blind 
Eyes with carrionâ¦
As vanished Babylon

His body/ has being brought 
Yonder to our funeral pyre 
To the joyous pipings 
Of a funeral marchâ.
