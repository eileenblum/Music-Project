Misconception of thoughts 
Collide confronting 
A new vision of colors 
Onwards on the same page 
Where no one understands 
A single letter

Taking a stance on unwritten 
Statements of power 
Denying sworn promises 
Unrelated circumstances
Bow down, the enemy has grown.
Retrieve the rights we never got. 

Oppressed or oppressor 
Doesnât matter anymore 
Judge right or wrong
Same side of the horrors
Narrow minded houses 
Once peaceful now divided 
By pre-made words
Seen on television

You are a number
You are a code 
You are a sheep 
We are the flock
No matter who holds the scepter 
No matter who is above. 
Nothing was designed 
To benefit everyone
Well they need the poor
And disagreement to rule
Condemned to this fate
Left to our own luck.
