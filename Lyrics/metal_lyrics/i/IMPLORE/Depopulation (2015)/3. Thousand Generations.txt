Irrational and cynic
Stands this paradox
From the beginning humiliated 
But the contrary told
Altruistic hands 
Choking us slow 
While the hand-shake 
And the smiles are the only things shown 

Pages are stained in blood
By the so called liberators
These are the foundations. 
Of the fathers of your nations
No approach is peaceful, 
Retaliation against the crown

Oh!

Forgotten genocides 
Never made it through history
No propaganda of widows 
Mourning man and kids
A candle dies
For every victim 
One more name is gone
Thousand generations of wars

Pages are stained in blood
By the so called liberators
These are the foundations 
Of the fathers of your nations
No approach is peaceful, 
Retaliation against the crown.

Weâre alone 
In a devastated land
Piles of ancestor lies 
Beneath our feet, 
No veil is enough 
To conceal this
Pestiferous reek 
Lives based on lies
So the hoax 
Will perpetuate crime
