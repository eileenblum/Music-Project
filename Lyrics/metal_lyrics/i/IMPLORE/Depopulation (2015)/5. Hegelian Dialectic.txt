[thesis]

Chaos reigns 
Above the heads 
Of servants 
Illuminated 
By flawless 
Misery of the icons 

Aloft the skies 
Witness the downfall 
Of the days weâve known
Internal secrecy
On the mist 
Of traitors (traitors)

[antithesis]

Spawn the disease
Among plebeians
To retain 
Humanity growth 
Dreadful shades hide 
On the bright side 
Of worthy ideals

[synthesis]

Useless stomachs
Into the moat 
Consent, needed no more,
Surrender identity
Embrace the new world. 

Want it or not.
