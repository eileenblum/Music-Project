Searching for a common enemy 
Against whom we can unite, 
Came up with the idea of pollution, 
Global warming, famine and the likeâ¦

In their totality and interactions 
These phenomena do constitute 
A common threat  
Designating these dangers 
As the enemy, 
We fall into a trap

All these dangers 
Are caused by humans
In natural processes, 

Itâs only through changed attitudes 
And behavior that can be overcome. 
Advanced forms of biological warfare
Of terror is the weapon they use

The real enemy then is

The ploy of finding a scapegoat 
As old as mankind itself â 
When things become too difficult,
The blame will always be on you.

[Adapted from The Club of Rome â The First Global Revolution]
