Obey the established
Born, consume and breed 
Chained to a lifelong mortgage 
Satisfy your material needs

Wish what you canât have 
And donât need
Only to seem superior 
To climb up the hierarchy 

Null individuality 
Stand out pretending to beâ¦
Believe in a god or not
Born, consume and die

Aware of this cage
We live in 
One more day 
To avoid reality 

Patterns were given 
Take what you need
Shepherd of the system 
For empty fulfillment 

Living ostentation 
How miserable do you feel?
Show thy life above 
Your capacity.

Debt. 

"Modern society creates a type of man whom I have earlier called theÂ homo consumensÂ -- the consumer man whose main interest becomes, aside from working from nine to five, to consumeâ.
[Erich Fromm]
