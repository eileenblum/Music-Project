Expired morality 
Rising to shine in plenitude 
Violence of constitution 
Approved by a few

Prophets of salvation 
Decimate the unborn
Undercover benevolence 
Vaccinate the future voice 

Loathsome plans built on smiles 
Of early dreamers
Hypocrites condemn us all
Punishing the sinners 

Kneel or crawl 
The venom will numb
Misbegotten plans 
Gestate in the womb of the devil

Lack of empathy 
Betrayed by those once feared 
Corrupted and abandoned 
To the mercy of the system

No saviors, no icons, no leaders 
Peace is a pantomime
A ticking bomb, 
Deadly rising tide 

Sewn lips, shut eyes 
Nothing around is real 
Mostly its a false flag 
To profit a minority

Summoning the storm 
Knell sounds loud and clear 
The bells of the third Reich 
Had âthe unionâ melodies.
