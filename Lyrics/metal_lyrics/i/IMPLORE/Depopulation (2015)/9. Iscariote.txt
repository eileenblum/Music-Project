Nailed to the cross 
That points up to the sky 
Crucifixion of ideals 
Rot slowly and dies 
A mere attempt 
To obtain the demands 
Whilst the dismal
Burns from inside

Sore feelings 
Of those seeking life 
Guilty of all pleasures 
Hide in their lies 

Deny it 
two more times
Thirty silver coins
Sold convictions 
Eradicated heart 
Bigotry biased 
No one else left behind 

Sore feelings 
Of those seeking life
Last of a breed 
Everyone has a price
