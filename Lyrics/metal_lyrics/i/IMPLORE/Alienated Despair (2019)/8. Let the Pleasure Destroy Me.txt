Let the pleasure destroy me
For I have sinned
Let the pleasure take
The best of me
Consumers of lust
The product you will buy
Swipe side by side
Swallowed by the crowd
Give me the pleasure
And don't give me guilt
Give me the pleasure
All what I need
I will find peace when the worms eat my flesh
I will find peace when there's nothing left
Watch me melting
Behind dirty glass
Watch me destroy all we've known
Let pleasure take over pain
Let it destroy me slowly.
I am no saint.
