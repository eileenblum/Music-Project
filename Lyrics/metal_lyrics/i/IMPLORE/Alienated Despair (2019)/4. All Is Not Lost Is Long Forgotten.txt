All is not lost is long forgotten
When every gallows finally sagged
And the prophets meet their crosses
We will be left with stones and bones
Maybe one day you'll see
We are not here to rule and breed
We should go extinct
Before we cut down the last tree
The spreading disease
Spawned forth the devil
The curse of humanity
Castles burn in disbelief to my eyes
We celebrate our greatness
Losing our minds
While we decimate everything around
You gifted me with anger and contempt
Your reckless actions turned into my despair
I'm trying hard
To survive with a block
Of concrete attached to my back
You gave me the carcass.
