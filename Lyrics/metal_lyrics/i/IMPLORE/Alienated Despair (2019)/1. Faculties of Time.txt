The aversion cast a shadow
Since the moment I realized
I'm conscious, a useless animal
And how life begins to shrink itself
As all I could see was the abiding nature
Of time...
Creeping down on me
Lacerated by the arrows of clocks
And a fragile circadian rhythm
I begin to understand
How the line is getting shorter
Of the cycle of being
Blurred in a parody
Diminished existence bound
By the faculties of time
