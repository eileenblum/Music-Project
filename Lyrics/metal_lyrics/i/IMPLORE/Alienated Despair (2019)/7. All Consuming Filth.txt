Discouraged and alienated
Without truce or plans
And still the scourge
Won't give any solace
Even if I'm reluctant
Blessed me with my miseries
Their martyrs march
On hollow corpses
They cut their wrists
To welcome me with open arms
The filth consumes me
As it rips out my eyes
I won't be tamed
Resurrected from the dust
Wind sculpted my face
To resemble the grace
That washed away
And now I stand
Rotting away
With what we've learned
Till our obituary
If I could understand
What all of this meant
Laid on the hands of fate
Engraved in myself
