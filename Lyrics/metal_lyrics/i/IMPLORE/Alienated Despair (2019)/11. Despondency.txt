I was heading
To a degree of catastrophe
From the start knowing why
The imperfect beings we are
A road to oblivion
Abysmal downfall
To quiet this mind
That gnawed into itself,
Troubled spirits
Can greet the first signs of pain
And I'm relieved
I reach the final breath
To find comfort
In the midst of memories
Everything I am is bound
Everything I've done is bound
In consequences
That began with birth
Which I'm powerless
To alter at will,
When right and wrong
Are just as one
Accepting both is accepting life
How many days and nights
Have rolled upon me?
Awake before dawn
Consumed by the fear
Deep hours in the dark,
Play with my fateful destiny
Let the sun and the moon
Dig a grave for me
