The constant dissonance
Of one single voice
The sound of echo caused
By these four walls
The static sound
Penetrates my bones
Isolation is never enough
I hear no voice but only lies
Sentenced to failure
I burst from my despair
Finding pleasure in pain
Absolute disappointment
What if I'm worthless?
Blissful and numb
I sunk, ignorant
Take all I am
The past that I will be
The mind is projected on it
As in a mirror of eternity
An immortal being is all men
A way of saying that I'm nothing
Take all I am
