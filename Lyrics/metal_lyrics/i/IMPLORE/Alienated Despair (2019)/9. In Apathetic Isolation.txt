This is the relief
I've been longing for
Heal the wounds
I chose to have.
Withdraw with me slowly
Into our true nature
And leave this
Hell in the past
In apathetic isolation
All life goes away
Devoid of purpose
Days go by
Too much too little
But never enough
Fed like rats,
We ate from the hand
This perspective
Won't change any of us
I wish I could go back in time
To retrieve the essence of existence
Before it all falls apart
