Hope based in others
Can turn your back
On what cannot be undone
Abandoned desires
Knowing that you're gone
Before it makes any difference
Hands and mind
Raised to the sky
Dull, from the iron taste
From the blood on your forehead
Leaving a world
That would have been
Better off without us
Failing, writhing
Falling, cowering
Hands and mind
Raised to the sky
Dull, from the iron taste
From the blood on your forehead
Damn my eyes
Swallow me whole
