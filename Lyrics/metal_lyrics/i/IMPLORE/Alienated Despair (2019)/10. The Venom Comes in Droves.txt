Let me smell the morning rain
One last time, let me rejoice
Simple pleasures at last
Touch the earth and feel alive
Lay my fingers in the dirt
To hear the beat of my heart
Real truth lies in lifeless eyes
Wasting away what was never
Destined to any of us...
Damned into the endless solitude
Without chance to bear a light
I'm running out of remembrance
While our sight greys and fades out
Our minds are running dry
Now there's nothing left to recommence
I swallow in guilt
We weep in loss
Nail the coffin
The balm is now venom
