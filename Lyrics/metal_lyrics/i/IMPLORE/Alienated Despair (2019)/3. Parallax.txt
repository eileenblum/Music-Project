I forgot how
To roam free
Under the stars
'Cause all of my
Instincts have
Atrophied for life
I'm caught in this endless disease
Subject to be an instrument of tyranny
The self-deception
Worshipers of greed
But to say it is a noble lie
Behind the glow there is a dying light
And I became the prey
The natural slave to the heirs
For this I have kissed thy ring
This love no longer feels real
For I'd rather cut off my tongue
'Cause I already don't have a voice
The self-deception
The bottom feeders
All my prayers, all my vows
All my anguish, all my scorn
All misfortunes
All famines
Come with a price
And if I've shown
Respect at times
Down below awaits
The punishment to their souls
