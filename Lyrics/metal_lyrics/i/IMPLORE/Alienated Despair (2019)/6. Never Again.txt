There is a certain feeling in the air
You can see the clouds coming
The tension is clear
Hear the drums of despair
Banging from far away
Wolves from the east
Planting the seeds
The threat to my liberties
Detriment to all your needs
The threat to my liberties
For one arm a thousand fists
There are those waving the flag of self defense
And those seeking shelter in common sense
The eagle has landed, claws sharped with fear
Another chapter in the book of ignorance
There is a certain feeling in the air
You can see the clouds coming
The tension is clear
Too late for lamentations
Watch life repeat itself
Like vultures to carrion
Seizing every chance
Laudation of fools
Carving their way
We are sworn forever
I said never again!
