Human forms in the distance
Pathless on the empty road
Roaming where thereâs no light
Avoiding all law
Fences built up high
Stopping the dreams of those
Who fought against all systems
To find the comfort

Utopian picture awaits,
Where it stands the North.
Silence wraps the tension
That infects the air with the cold
Nylon houses in transit
Shelters thousands of dogs,
Sons of perpetuation
Daughters of oblivion,
Forsaken ghosts.
