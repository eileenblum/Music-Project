Follow the guidelines
Of a dictated speech
Repeating without judgment
Is what they want to hear

Retaliate this paradox

This misconception
Is rooted in guilt
From the shadows
Youâll carry for centuries
While you address
Your insecurities
To the others around you
Just to be set free

To be set free

Derogatory interpretation
Of everything thatâs said
Obsessive, compulsive
Defeated dependents

Lone Wolf

Designed to belittle you
And destroy your pride
Sever your independence
And replace it with drugs

Retaliate this paradox
Regressive paradox.
