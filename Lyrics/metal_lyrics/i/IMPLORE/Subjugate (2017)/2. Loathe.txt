Woken up in silence and disbelief
In a chamber of void
Senseless, worthless,
Senseless, pointlessâ¦
Will I ever emerge from this pressure
That fills my needs?
When my sternum lingers unaware
Of the lack of breath.

Beams of light filter and blind
While the shrill sound rapes my ears.
Anxiety triggers the worst of me
Surrounded by material excess
And mundane hypocrites
To fulfill synthetic wishes
And embrace mediocre times

I find myself in a relentless
One-way path.
By irksome obligations
My soul is crushed.
