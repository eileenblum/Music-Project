Exercising no self-restraint
And concern for consequences,
This is the underlying root
Of all existence and its complications
The naÃ¯ve malice
Mankind portrays over its habitat
Accelerates the exhaustion
Of basic resources

Warning signs were given long ago
But this generation of idiots
Multiplied and gained form
Summarizing this behavior
The compelling statement is
Humans are the infection

No rational thought left
To minimize the impact
With the sole attitude of selfish
Center of the universe

Invasive maggot
Corrupting all surroundings
Imposing thoughts
Violating
I was forced into self-hatred
I discovered our real face
Joy canât exist without pain
Love canât exist without hate

If the course of things canât change
I wonât be the first one to say
We left behind a putrid place
We rotted the world and
We have to be erased.
