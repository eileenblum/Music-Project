Create a new beginning
When it means the end for us.
The cycle starts once again
Days of abundance
They are forever gone
Hence starvation and atonement
Letting it all go

Reform and regenerate
We shall go back
To what we once were
Return what has been takenâ¦
Cast the last stone and
Silence all anthems
War chant turned into
Total stillness

As above so below
Simplifying all
Against this sickness
Cast the last stone and
Silence all anthems
War chant turned into
Total stillness

Indulgent we have been
Therefore we shall dismantle
Modern society or
Succumb to the machine

Thou shalt not return
All the harm is done
Walk upon the land
Meaningless in space and time

Deconstruct the pillars
To pass the next phase
Regain the balance
Destroyed after thousands years
Let us be dust and wind.
