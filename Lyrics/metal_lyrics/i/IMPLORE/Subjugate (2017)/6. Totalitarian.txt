Vicissitudes of fate
Complaints were never heard
Convictions with no reward
Sentinels of lies
Coercing conformity with
Surveillance and censorship
Their hegemonic powers
Canonize whatâs left of us

From behind the gated walls
They punish with no remorse
Gloating without shame
On the face of the innocents
Prisoner in a hometown
Where we dwell, the basic rights
Forbidden to the masses
While we await resigned

This plutocracy of tyrants
Has been long enough
Switching names through the ages
But itâs always the same goal
How to keep 7 billionâ¦
The same purpose as before
Terror by all means
Terror for control

In lieu of learning from the past
Other techniques arise
An illusion of evolving
In this regime we now love
We are given the chance
To choose between two sides

Call it as you want
Itâs the same frustration
You simple man who
Wants to live in peace
Accept that you are a slave
Accept your destiny.
