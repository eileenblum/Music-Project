Morning light
A hand was raised
To worship in grace
The beginning of life
Agrarian curse
Settling basis
Of forthcoming
Damned times
Hunters-gatherers
Always submitted
Emancipated in
What was paradise.

Learning to domesticate
We learned to dominate
The path of survival
So vital and clear
From egalitarian
To property and greed

How did irrigation
Lead to mass warfare?
Control and subjugation
Population growth,
Work and oppression
And vertical society foundations
Bestowed Shamans
And so bowed the chiefs
Kissed the martyr
Glorified the kings
Once we were
One with the earth
Instinctual freedom renunciation
For the sake of civilization.
