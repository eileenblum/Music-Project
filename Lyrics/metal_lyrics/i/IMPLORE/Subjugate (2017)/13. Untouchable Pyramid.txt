The pestilent legacy
Upon we wash our hands
Condemns the progress
As the progression goes
With solid steps onward
Rulers of the earth
Species by thousands
On our backs leaving no trace

On the verge of primitive
The littering ape
Embodies definition of disgust
People keep reproducing
Feeding their own lust

More mouths are open
More cheap-labor hands
Industrialism cannot exist
Without these two basic plots

The net of linked vultures
Flying up high
Sentence an effect
Unilateral
Hidden from the sight
This cannot be reformed
Because thereâs nothing
Greater than the expansion

Ouroboric cycle,
Pile up those dead and gone
Replace them
For the new generation
This tragic disposition
Evoke us to a grim epithet
No time left
To solve mistakes

On the verge of primitive
The littering ape
Embodies definition of disgust

The net of linked vultures
Flying up high
Sentence an effect
Unilateral
We dug our grave
No time left to analyze
Prophecies were written
And we ignored all words.
