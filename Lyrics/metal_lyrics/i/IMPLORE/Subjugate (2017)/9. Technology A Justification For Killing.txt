Uncontrollable and delusional drive,
I never thought it would affect me
Among the landscapes I've seen
But for instance, these wallsâ¦
Obliterate what's left of me
May this solitude be my epitaph
Eroding me rather than liberating us

Man's downfall resides on every thought of anguished imprisonment and neglected dependence
In (a) strive to breakthrough
Fighting the agenda
Every reckless action points thatâ¦
Success is a failure
This ornamental decay as obedient servants of law

Advent of device
Gadgets monopolize
Blessed thy be
Beseeched upon thee

Contemplations of reality in megalopolis of vast consumption
Darkened windows of affliction
And few interactions
Seems impossible to find the adjustment
With the environment
Without its desecration
Behold the remains of this sanctuary of indoctrination.
