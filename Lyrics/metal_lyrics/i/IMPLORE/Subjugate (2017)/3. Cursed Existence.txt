Whatâs the porpuse of it all
And where does it come from
Particles in the air
Moving without pattern
Thereâs need to put
Order in chaos

Aware of
Inevitable death
We are anti-matter
And existential dread

The best for us/wouldâve been
If we were not born at all
We are unworthy
Of the gift of life
We made hell
Out of paradise

Despise and reject
Humanity in this form
Causing only
Contempt and scorn

Aware of
Inevitable death
We are anti-matter
And existential dread

There are no answers
For questions
There is no understanding
For cosmic measures
As you were
The human animal
There was no goal in life
As you evolved from the son of man
You need meaning
A reason to be alive
Keep seeking for the answers
Or believing the lies.
