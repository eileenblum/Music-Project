Gazing at the stars
Admiring their heavenly glow
Attributing their powers
To communicate with the Gods

Creation for deception
Celestial body less exposed
To the sun divine light.
Oh Saturn keeper of time
Devour your child

El, hexagon
Three dimensional cube
The greater malefic
Enthroned in capricorn
Grant the dominance
To the highest,
Praise the demiurge
For prolific harvest

Ineloquent plebeians
Marching into the unknown
Archetype of salvation
Of cloned symbolism
Indomitable courage
Against impossible odds
Struggling blindly
To the imminent fall
Seal of salt, omen
Of energy that flows
Blatant worship.
Disciplines and limitations
Imposed to restrict
The stance of things
Gnostic pleroma
Of the conspiratory.
