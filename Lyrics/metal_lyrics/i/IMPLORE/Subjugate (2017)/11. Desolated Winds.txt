The sequels of the fall
Left irreparable injuries
This is not a conclusion
But what I have perceived

Hope has never appeared
Yet grey covers
Whatâs left in here
While weeds grow from the concrete
Apathy is resignation
Of those who donât want to be
Desolated winds blow
From the distance of the sea

Massive disjunction
Of colossal force
Met against two brothers
Fighting for the soil

Conceived to represent thoughts
Erected for the victory
A reminder
Of ephemerality
Both ceased to exist,
Trapped in anachronism
And memories
Empires shatter,
Characters are gone
Empires crumble,
But scars last forever.

Leaving behind
A host of traces
Decaying
And rusting away.
