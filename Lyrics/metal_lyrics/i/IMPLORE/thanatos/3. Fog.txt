Will the fog carry the shadows? 
Of the martyrs you cannot see
Will the tree cover the woods? 
Of the blind hole you chose to live in

I fight fire with fire 
Unlike those lines 
You hid away.
So futile, so empty 
Divide and conquer. 

Iâve seen the giants fall 
One by one down to the soil 
The allegiance once pledged 
Turns into stone.
(Falling from grace) 

Avoiding dialogue  
Exchanging thoughts 
Putrid sanctity 
A pedantic view 

Make it shine again 
As it was before 
Your confronted enemy 
Is mirrored to you.

I fight fire with fire 
Unlike those lines 
You hid away.
So futile, so empty 
Divide and conquer.
