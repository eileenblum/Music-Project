Walking among misery and desolation 
No light, no answer to this situation 
I canât find solutions to fill this emptiness
And reasons to see this not ashamed

From dust to dust we belong
Branding the decades
To ashes weâll go again
No one was born to reign
Refused those who maintain 
Upright the letters of our name

But in this kingdom fear reigns
And every face speaks itself

On thee, the portion of our time depends,
Whose absence lengthens life, whose presence ends.
The forgotten liturgy turned into rotten hope 
Saviors wait in line for the end of the rope

How long can we carry disgrace?
How long can we live in pain 
Dragged to ruin to the land

Covered in black veil 
And in dead let us crawl
Take no possessions
Itâs only one way
Survivors of all plagues
