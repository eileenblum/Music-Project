Skeptical masses 
Confused and renegade
From mass media 
Words and coverage 
Manipulated to raise, 
Fear among them selves
Itâs so easy to lie 
and to makeâem understand

Lies beneath the surface 
Strived to be concealed
The profit taken from all blindfolded face
Whatâs behind every monument?
Facing the sun in every city every town
Demolish them pullâem down 

Driven by the hand that controls our fate
