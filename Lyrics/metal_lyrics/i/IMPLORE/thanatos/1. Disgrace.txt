Say what you want 
Iâve heard enough
Everything is bullshit to me 
Iâve seen you before 
You keep rolling on
Choke until you canât breathe 

Consumers of souls 
Go where you belong 
Save up your time 
Please donât waste mine 

You are a curse 
I came across 
Demanding victim 
Iâm done with your loss
Everyone carries a corpse 
Mourn it with a closed box 

Consumers of souls 
Go where you belong 
Save up your time 
Please donât waste mine 

FUCK!

No pity for the weak 
I wonât take it 
You wonât make it 
Donât ever show up.
Donât fucking come back. 
Disgrace.
