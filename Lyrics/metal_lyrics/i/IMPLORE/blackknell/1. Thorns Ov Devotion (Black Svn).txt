Mouth full of lies
Preaching the word of love
Among the strongest
Weakness being your crown
Divine illusion
Has come to an end
I owe you nothing
Weâve torn separate ways

Malevolence,
You are also guilty
Being part of the lust,
being part of the filth
Hypocritical subterfuge
Holding you down
One more lie
From your sins you canât hide.

Free myself
From the curse of your nights
Path of the righteous,
For most the unknown.
