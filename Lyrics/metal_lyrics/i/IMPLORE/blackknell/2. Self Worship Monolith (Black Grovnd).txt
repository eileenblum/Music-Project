As if reflecting in the mirrors
Wouldnât be enough
Pupil dilate on self obsessed love
Projecting adoration over no one
Confidence has a price
Affordable with likes and kind lines

Archetype of confidence
Self-esteem left no trace
In this modern age
Of vanity and emptiness
Fill the silence with no sound
Fill the void, fake a smile.
