Deprived from our creation
Regression to our demise
The march of human beings
Machines replace mankind

Destined to ruin
All what we touch
Barcode marked for a lifetime
Ready for the grand finale

Dark clouds approaching in the sky
Walk towards the cliff that await
Upcoming generationsâ¦.

A hideous landscape
Where grief rules above everyone
As long as we exist
This hecatomb wonât stop

One more victim
Of the hand that feeds me
The one you tried to bite
Try no longer son, this is a lost war.
