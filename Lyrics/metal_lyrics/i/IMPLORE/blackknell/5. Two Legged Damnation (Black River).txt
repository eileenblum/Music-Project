Tamed tribe
Cursed society
In order to persuade
The behavior of this breed
Despise the nouns
Of the so called morality
Despise the values
Of the imposed life we live

Dogmatic declarations
Leaders flag your needs
Meeting demands
And forced fed lies
From dawn to dusk
Throughout 12 months
Serving the master
On a slavery pact

Developed complex
Of unhappiness
Tools for recreation
Loss of concerns
Nothing to say
As nothing to be
Quiet and tied
Shall set us free.
