Stench of ignorance
Floods the air I breathe
With a vile excuse
That they donât feel

Am I an extremist?
This is the legacy they left
I inherit the pollutionâ¦
Of the culture they created

This the cancer to eradicate
My answer wont be kind
And we wont tolerate
The unjust and unfair

To every innocent their freedom
To the guilty, infinite pain
To the slave, freedom
To the captor, punishment

Would you ever deny
What happened in the world war
Then you shouldnât look away
The pain you inflict onto them

Corpses hanging head down
this carnage, I refuse to be part
Morbid smile, sharps the knife
Enough to quench this bloodbath.
