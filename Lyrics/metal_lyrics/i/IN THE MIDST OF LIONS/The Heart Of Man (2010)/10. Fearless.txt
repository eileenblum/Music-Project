Blessed are those who are persecuted. And blessed are those who will stand for You. These men thirst for blood, they are my enemies. Drive out the fear that has taken my heart.
These men thirst for blood, they are my enemies. Drive out the fear that has taken my heart.

They cast their stones and lies are on their tongues. I make this oath: my words will never denounce You.

What can these men do to me? They can kill my body but never kill my soul.

And even now, staring death in the face, my heart will not stray.

I am not afraid to die! I am not afraid to die!
I am not afraid to die! I am not afraid to die!
No I'm not afraid...not afraid to die!
I am not afraid...I am not afraid to die!

By His name I stand. By His word I stand. And by His Son I stand. You will never break me! Death has no hold on me. Eternity is mine.

They cast their stones and lies are on their tongues. I make this oath: to always love You.
They cast their stones and lies are on their tongues. I make this oath...I give up my life for the One who gave up His life for me.
I give up my life for the One who gave up His life for me.

Forgive these ones my God; they know not what they do.
Forgive these ones my God; they know not what they do.
