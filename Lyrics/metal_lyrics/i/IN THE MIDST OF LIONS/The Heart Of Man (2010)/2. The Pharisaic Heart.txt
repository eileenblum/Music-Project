Walk these streets and hear their cries. They scream of their righteousness. They reek of lies. They call on His name for the masses to see. Claiming their reward in this world. Forfeiting the eternal blessing of the One who gives us life. Hypocrisy reigns in the pharisaic heart.

Brood of vipers!

Venom spills from their mouths, poisoning the minds of those who hear. Through murderous intent they plot to end the life of the One. Look at the monster blinding their eyes with pride. Walk these streets and you will find them. Mocking the One who gives us life. Sending my Savior to the grave. Forfeiting the eternal blessing of the One who gives us life. Hypocrisy reigns in the pharisaic heart.

Brood of vipers! Brood of vipers! Speak your lies.
