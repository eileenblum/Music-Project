This is war! His citizens are marching into the bowels of the serpent. Godless men are surrendering to the sin in their hearts.

Lord please lift us up. Make us whole again. As the darkness swallows this world alive, restore...restore our hope in You.

May Your glory be revealed. May we seek You before the end.

God save us all! For when that day has come and the sky has been split in two, His army will follow and then it's too late. Power and authority have been exposed to us. A blinding light from our beacon, our Christ. His name will ring out for eternity. The battle is won. This is the end of the world. The beast lies in ruin at the feet of creation...creation.

Lord please lift us up. Make us whole again.
Lift us up. Make us whole again.
Lift us up. Make us whole again.
