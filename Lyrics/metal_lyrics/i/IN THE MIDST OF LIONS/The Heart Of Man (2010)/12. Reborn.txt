Break the chains of this monster holding onto me. Break the chains on my heart. Far too long have I been blinded by his ways. Break the chains on my heart.

Conform my heart to that which is pleasing to You. Reborn into a new life. I will spread truth to the nations. Light a fire inside of me.
I will rise up! I will rise up!
I will rise up! I will rise up!

A darkness is rotting us from within. We must renew our lives and wipe this slate clean. Send forth Your Spirit as we cry out, "Abba, Father!" Overcome the dark with light!

My body will perish, but my soul will stand firm. I refuse to let the fire consume me.
My body will perish, but my soul will stand firm. I refuse to let the fire consume me.

You fill me up with Your Spirit. I am forever Yours!
The deceiver may claw at my faith, but I will stand strong.
The deceiver may claw at my faith, but I will stand strong.

I will move the mountains. You are my shield, who can touch me now? I know all he speaks are lies, while You alone are the Truth.
I give up all that I am. I give up all that I am.

Take my heart. Make it Yours.
Take my heart. Make it Yours.
Take my heart. Make it Yours.
Take my heart. Make it Yours.
