"They know the truth because creation points to it; and its glory makes it obvious to them, singing, 'I'm shining through these invisible qualities, and I loved you, but you wouldn't worship me.' And every excuse will be nothing. That malice, greed, envy. Claiming to be wise, they betrayed truth for a lie. So give them over to that 'wisdom', their hate. I will withdraw my hand and give them everything they want: abandonment. Corruption and consequence. And you can drown yourself in that emptiness. I'll be patiently waiting for you to call on my name while you try to find your own way home." [x2]
