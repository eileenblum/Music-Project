Reward and consequence will be the final outcome of this world and all who inhabit it.

Loving but just is the King of Kings, bestowing upon His creation according to the choice we make. Be devoted to the Lamb or continue following this world. Men shall reap what they sow, accepting life or embracing death.

His wrath will fall on all who oppose. Lucid choices made all too difficult when truth is staring us in the face. The line is drawn. Where do you stand? The skies will be split in two and all will fall to the ground in reverence. His glory will overtake the land. Withdrawing now seems all too meaningless.

Time is short and days are numbered. Repent.

Reward and consequence will be the final outcome of this world and all who inhabit it.

While all are crying, "Peace and safety," Annihilation will transpire and none shall escape from His fury. The final judgment will be made. This race was not created to fall into darkness, but be warned, narcissistic disposition will find one staring death in the face.

His wrath will fall on all who oppose.
