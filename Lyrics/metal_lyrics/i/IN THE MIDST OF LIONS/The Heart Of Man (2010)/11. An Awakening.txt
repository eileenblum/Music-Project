The time has come. I have now realized that my life was meant for something so much more. No longer living for myself. No longer living for this world. I must be transformed.

What must I do? Take me from this life. I can't go on this way. God transform me.
God transform me. God transform me.

The world will see that I am Yours. They will know that Your Spirit dwells in me.

What must I do? Take me from this life. I can't go on this way. I can't go on this way.
What must I do? Take me from this life. I can't go on this way. I can't go on this way.

God transform me. God transform me.
God transform me.

The world will see that I am Yours. They will know that Your Spirit dwells in me.
