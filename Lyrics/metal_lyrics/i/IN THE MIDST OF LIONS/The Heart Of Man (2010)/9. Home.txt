"But we have a great high priest how is able to sympathize with our weaknesses, who is able to set the captives free. 'I came to rescue my lost sheep, you blind guides, my prodigal sons. I have fulfilled the law. I have passed through the heavens, and you are not forgotten. Come boldly into this throne room of grace, because I will be there for you when you need it most, and my hands are still outstretched, raw, but your stones fit through their holes perfectly and what you cast as evil, I transformed, and took the consequence. I remembered all of my promises. There is hope for you. You are a new creation. You are a new creation, and I will always take you back if you've forgotten your first love.'"
