The heart of man!

The hearts of men are easily corrupted, and through these eyes you can see the deceiver's grip on them all--controlling every thought.
We are lost with no minds of our own. This world is where the heart lies.
There is no love in those dead eyes.

Here is the Savior. Here is the sacrifice.
Here is the Savior. Here is the sacrifice.

An undeserving love for an undeserving heart. An undeserving love.

And from the overflow, the mouth is speaking lies and leading all who hear to their demise.
And from the overflow, the mouth is speaking lies and leading all who hear to their demise.

Fight the darkness.
Fight the darkness.

Wake up. Seek the Truth.
Wake up. Seek the Truth.

The heart of man!
The heart of man!
