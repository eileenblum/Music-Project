With tongues of fire, every man shall hear!
The Son has risen, every man shall hear!
Blood and tears were not shed in vain.
But they were shed with a purpose in mind.
Blood and tears were not shed in vain.
Spirit descend for our work is not done here.
Tongues of fire spew forth and let these men hear.
SPIRIT DESCEND!
With tongues of fire, every man shall hear!
The Son has risen, every man shall hear!
The Son has risen, and the end is near!
