Your life is not your own!
This life is not your own, you were bought for a price.
Therefore honor our God with your body and mind.
Before your own eyes this truth was present, yet you ignore it.
Sin has taken hold of our world and all that is in it.
A Saviour is required, blood is required.
Wake up!
You were bought for a price.
Wake up!
You were bought for a price.
The king will say to those on His right, come you who are blessed by my Father.
Take your inheritance.
Those on his left shall hear these words: Depart from me I never knew you.
Depart from me I never knew you.
Descend into the fire.
Descend into the fire.
Do not let this be the end of you!
Do not let this be the end of you!
