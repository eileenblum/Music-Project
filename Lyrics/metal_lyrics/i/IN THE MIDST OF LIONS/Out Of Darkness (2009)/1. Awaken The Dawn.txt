"I am in the midst of lions; I lie among ravenous beasts
Men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.
They spread a net for my feet   I was bowed down in distress.
They dug a pit in my path   but they have fallen into it themselves.
My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music.
Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre!
I will awaken the dawn."
[Psalm 57:4-8]
