Alone and hopeless, this darkness I roam.
Searching for deliverance from this dark void.
Searching for deliverance from this dark void.
This journey attempted by my own will has never been complete.
Marching onward, once more, blind in this place.
My life has no meaning.
With blistered hands clasped, I fall to my knees.
What is my purpose? Where is my meaning? What is my purpose?
Where is my meaning?
A voice calls out bringing sight to my eyes. "Follow me and I will show you the light."
A voice calls out bringing sight to my eyes. "Follow me and I will show you the light."
I will pull you from this horrid place and bring you a new life.
Out of darkness and into the light I tread on with my Saviour.
I am now one of Gods chosen.
Declaring praises of He who has called me out.
Out of darkness and into the light I tread on with my Saviour.
I am now one of Gods chosen men.
