Dear God, I am declaring myself as an instrument...
Dear God, I am declaring myself as an instrument to be used at your will.
Use me to fight in the war against the evil contained in this world... evil contained in this world.
I see so much wickedness.
It surrounds me.
It surrounds me.
Pull me up from this ugly mess.
Do not let me falter.
Pull me up from this ugly mess.
Do not let me falter.
Pull me up from this ugly mess.
Do not let me falter.
