A diabolical ruler has arisen to corrupt this Holy Land, with lies deceit and violence he will reign.
His heart will be filled with hate and he will show no mercy for the weak, with lies deceit and violence he will reign.
Through spiteful action, the blood of righteous men will spill upon the earth.
Ignorant of the end that awaits his wretched life.
His blasphemies are heard by the Father and will never be ignored.
The angels are descending from above and are commanded by the Alpha and Omega.
This man shall never see another day!
Electricity is streaming through every pore, and there's no turning back for this man!
The smell of burning flesh fills up the air and life forms rise up from the earth.
Now tell me as the worms consume your flesh,
DO YOU FEAR MY GOD NOW?
