Now you stand upon the ground where the betrayer met his end.
He took his life on the field of blood.
By his own hand he has brought on an excruciating end.
He took his life on the field of blood.
Memories of the events that compose the last days of his life cloud his eyes.
And will not be forgotten, for they re burned in his mind... in his mind.
For Satan did penetrate the darkest corners of his mind.
Thoughts of betrayal.
Betrayal that brought my Saviour's life to a close.
Thoughts of betrayal.
Betrayal that found a price in silver.
But in this decomposing world of now, this resembles a shell of my life.
But in this decomposing world of now, this resembles a shell of my life.
Why are my actions not what I know to be righteous?
My Saviour's blood is now on my hands.
Why are my actions not what I know to be righteous?
My Saviour's blood is now on my hands.
I am the betrayer.
I am the betrayer.
It is my sin that holds him to that cross.
I don't deserve what You have done for me... have done for me.
But through Your grace and Your love You have saved me.
You have saved me.
