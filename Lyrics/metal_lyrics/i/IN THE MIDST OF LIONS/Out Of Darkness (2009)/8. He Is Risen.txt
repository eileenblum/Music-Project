Bring him forth, this Son of Man, this King of Kings, this Saviour of Men!
His crimes are punishable by death!
CRUCIFY! CRUCIFY!
Take him from my sight!
Take him from my sight!
Take him from my sight!
Take him from my sight!
To my left is a dead man.
To my right he will live on.
In three days I will rebuild what today I will destroy.
My God, why have You forsaken me?
My God, why have You forsaken me? ...forsaken me? ...forsaken me?
Now His life has reached its end, He died with a cause.
Now His life has reached its end.
With grace that can fill the ocean and love that knows no bounds.
With grace that can fill the oceans and love that knows no bounds.
Examining an empty tomb, no answers are found for them.
Where is the man they call the Christ?
What have you done with Him?
I have done nothing!
All prophecies are fulfilled!
He is risen!
He is risen!
He is risen!
He is risen!
