THe time has come to move on, no longer living the life you did before. The time has
Come to move on, this is the change that you have been waiting for. Be still and wait.
Better days are ahead. Take the first steps into freedom. A new man. A new creation. A
New life. A new beginning. A new man. A new creation. You cannot live your life in the
Past, one that haunts your every move. There is nothing left to fear. Not even fear
Itself! What lies ahead? Open your eyes and see. What lies ahead? This is a new beginning.
Freeom. This is a new beginning and no longer will you live in the past, no longer
Will you dwell on mistakes made. Your old ways are dead. A new man. A new creation.
A new life. A new beginning. You have lied to yourself and become a new
Creation, risen from the grave to a new life. The time has come to move on, no longer
Living the life you did before. The time has come to move on, this is the change that
You have been waiting for.
