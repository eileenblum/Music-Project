This is a cry of the oppressed! I fix my eyes above and I scream for relief. This suffering
Is just to much. My God, Hear my cry. My throat is raw from screaming and the pain
Is setting in. What's becom of my life? This isn't how I imagined it. He is faithful. He has
Heard my cry. This darkness will not be allowed to be the end. Deliver me from the
Hands of my oppressors. Show me the light. I fix my eyes above and I scream for relief.
This suffering is just too much. I will trust in a God who first trusted in me to save me
From the hands that placed me here. Free me from my oppressors. Lead me from the
Chains that bind me here. I am free. I'm no longer a stranger in a foreign land.
The promises made have been answered. I will walk with my head held high,
Proclaiming the name of the one who saved me.
