Open your eyes as the rivers run red. Open your eyes as the skies turn black. You speak,
Yet they do not listen. They see the signs, but they heed no warning. Stretch out your
Hands to these hardened hearts and humble those who stand against you. They will
Know that you are God! You are exalted among the nations. You are exalted in the
Earth, Only you are wory. You speak, yet they do not listen. They see the signs, but
They heed no warning. Stretch out your hands to these hardened hearts and humble
Those who stand against you. Open their eyes stretch out your hand until they can
Understand that you are worthy. They will know that you are Go. Stretch out your
Hands untilthey can understand that you are worthy. You are wory. You speak, yet
They do not listen. They see the signs, but they heed no warning. Stretch out your
Hands to these hardened hearts and humble those who stand against you.
