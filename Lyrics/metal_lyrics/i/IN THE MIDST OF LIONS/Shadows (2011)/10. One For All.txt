Oppressed an afflicted, yet silent he remaine. A lamb led to the slaughter, He kept
His mouth shut. My sorrow he carried, for he had none. His blood rained down on me,
And now it dwells within. Rain down on me! A perfect creation, we tarnished
That name. I am underserving. Oppressed and afflicted, yet silent he remianed. A lamb
Led to the slaughter, he kept his mouth shut. My sorrow he carried, for he had none.
I give you my life, because of all you gave. My God, You gave me everything. A perfect
Creation, we tarnished that name. I am underserving. One for all. We are the
Underserving. One for all. We deserve death, but you give us life. Oppressed and
Afflicted, yet silent he remained. A lamb led to the slaughter, he kept his mouth shut.
