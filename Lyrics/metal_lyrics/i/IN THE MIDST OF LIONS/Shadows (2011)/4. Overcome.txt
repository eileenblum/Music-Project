I will overcome! I take a look at myself and I see my own fault. I know my own weakness
How am I to speak what has been commaned? And then I heard a voice. "Who gave man
His mouth? And who gives him his sight? Is it not I? I am the one who gives you strength.
I am." Give me strength. Remove this doubt from my mind. I have built these walls of
Weaknes. Remove this doubt from my mind. Break down these walls! Break down these
Walls and leave nothing behind. Erase all doubt and deceit from my mind. Give me the
Strength to speak your word. Break down these walls and leave nothing behind.
Break these walls down. Remove this doubt.
