Now is the time! This is the purpose you were made for in life. Will you answer the call
Or will you fall? You were meant for so much more than what this world has told you
In the past. Will you step up, or will you stand down? This is The Call. You will do great
Things through the strength of the one who created all. Conquering the evil forces
In this world. Now is the time! We must realize that there is no excuse to ignore the
Purpose we're been born into. This is the call. You will do great things through the
strength of the one who created all, conquering the evil forces in the world.
Greater things await you. This is just the beginning. This is the call. Now is the time.
