Take this sacrife. Oh, God, I am yours and my blood is poured. I bring this Holy
Offering. Raise your voice to declare his name as His glory rises upon you. God deliver
Me. My blood flows for you. I have eyes, but I do not see. Redeemer lead me on my way.
Righteousnes flows from my veins. Raise your voice to declare hi name as His glory
Rises upon you. Bring us home.
