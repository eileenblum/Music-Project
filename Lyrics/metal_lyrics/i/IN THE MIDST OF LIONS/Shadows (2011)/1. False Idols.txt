Look as they worship. These are false gods. Not worty of attention. Wealth and
Possession. The golden calf; Smash your idols. Destroy distraction. Exchanging truth
For a lie. Masters of the world and bringers of death. Blinding the people of the truth.
Wealth and possession. The golden calf. Smash your idols. Destroy distraction. Rid
Yourself of the things that blind you. This is the war within us. Wealth and possession.
The golden calf; Smash your idols. Destroy distraction. Kill your idols destroy.
