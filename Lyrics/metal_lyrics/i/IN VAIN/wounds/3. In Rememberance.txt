I saw a future standing
before my weary eyes.
A reformation of life,
grasp or decay.
Frightened by light,
this opportunity escaped.
Lonely and cold,
hiding from daylight.

These burdensome longings
tearing me apart
I hold my breath
to stay alive
I'm lost in confusion,
stranded on air
I remain in despair.

Waiting in silence,
hiding the pain.
I enter nightfall,
never left any trace.
Only memories of what
could have been remain.
In my secret plight.

These burdensome longings
tearing me apart...

Through the sorrows of
my life I slowly realize.
My longing, my desperation
can not be cured.
Before the pain in my heart
has been tread apart.

These burdensome longings
tearing me apart...

No one ever saw me gleam.
