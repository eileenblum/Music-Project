Thirsty dogs of war seeking the glory
Our nation demands full of pride
Steel cavalry smashing the bodies
Of every fool who defies

All the heads we collect as crusaders
Of the merciless order of hate
Are the medals we win as berserkers
Defeating a few country men

[Chorus:]
From the valley of the sins
Spreading misery and fear
Rise the ones who rule the world
With an iron fist
Now keep looking to the ground
This glorious army holds your town
And those who dare to claim
The war machine's heading for your reign

Find some honor in killing the old ones
Find some justice for children in flames
Don't you mind, we think for you Johnny
Hoo-Ah!!

This machinery works from the cradle
Making titans of stone out of flesh
Call us saviors never invaders
And god bless our land!

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
