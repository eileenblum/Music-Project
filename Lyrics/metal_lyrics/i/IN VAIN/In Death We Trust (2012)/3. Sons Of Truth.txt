Black tides, blinding the sight,
Hear the call of disgrace
Steel roars far in the night
Death shows us her face

We claim so loud for justice
Can't believe the system fails
All nations united
To ignore the weak ones' pain

[Pre:]
Hope you get enough gold to mute your remorse, that you once had it
Children learn hard this lesson it will be their last

[Chorus:]
Sons of truth, the bodies of the dead
Rise and fall of evil men, it's all because of them
Sons of truth, the bodies of the dead
The evidence you try to hide, rising from the grave

Seeds grow, fed with our blood
Field of thorns they'll become
When you think the rose is at hand
Ripped flesh is your reward

Keep saying you work for justice
Only your coin sees the light
You fool the world smiling
Muppets built for telling lies

[Pre]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
