Here we are the cowboys of destruction
Riding our horses of steel and wrath
Bringers of unjustice and corruption
Wearing the disguise of saviors who have come with hope

Playing all the time with the illusion
Whipping hard your backs when you leave our guide
All the world believes that this intrusion
Tries to reach democracy but all we want is

[Chorus:]
Gold, black gold is flowing
Your sun's going down
This land is burning
Your sun's falling down

Hey we look for nothing but your safety
The child I shot today was going to steal your watch
Close your eyes give me your blood I'm thirsty
The day we leave this dunghill is when you run out of

[Chorus]

[Solo]
