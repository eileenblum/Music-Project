You came to my lands
And thought all my people just could run
Discovering late that we're all born to fight
A god-like pretender
Can't hide the evil in your veins
The entire world now sees the truth on your face

[Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh
The time has come for you and me to cross our steel
Oh, oh, oh
Into the abyss we will find our destiny

The expected reaction is far from the fist that hit your eye
You'll never defeat those who fight for their lives
Don't wait for surrender, 'cause death is the goal this dark path hides
We learnt how to suffer and we won't step back

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
