Night finally falls, embracing our skin
The time for a long goodbye comes, the moment of tears
They told us to go, they built up this dream
So why do they cry? We do the right thing

[Chorus:]
Far away from home
Far away from home I ride
Far away from home I'll die

A whisper now blows, like breeze in the fields
We're here to defend our land, that's not what it seems
Stealing our faith, stealing our hopes
Fearless we came and fearful we fall

[Chorus]

[Solo]
