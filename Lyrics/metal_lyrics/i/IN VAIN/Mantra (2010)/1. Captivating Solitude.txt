I have been pierced by a deadly thorn
There is no way to undo what's done
My disease, my infection
I am so impure
My release, my redemption
Is there a cure
I'm falling from the righteous path
Hollow silence follows these days

In silence enduring the pain
Protecting my soreness from daylight
Alleviate this loneliness, contaminate this fright
I hope for a better tomorrow

Vague memories painful enough
To wish they had never been
They're still haunting me
Shivering with horror, awaiting tomorrow
Desperately searching for a cure
Each drop of life absorbed by this void

In silence enduring the pain...
