On the banks of the Mississippi
An old man sits on his bench
Watching the river's water flow
Smoking cigarettes as time goes by
Reminiscing about the years passed
And his loved ones who've gone old
Now his life is shortened
His better days are gone

Watching the moon in the eventide
In the cold freezing rain
Three destinies in a cruel world
With vague dreams buried by loss
Laying their burdens down
On the banks of the Mississippi

On the banks of the Mississippi
A woman breaks down in tears
Crying for her lost love
Who was consumed by the waves
On a stormy autumn night
Never to be found again
Now her life is without meaning
Now her life is dead

Watching...

On the banks of the Mississippi
An old sailor is drinking his ale
Trying to find peace of mind, trying to ease the pain
Regretting his actions of the past, and all those wasted years
Time spent at bars around the world, miles away from home
Now he longs for someone
But no one is to be found

Watching...

Cast your sorrows to the wind
And stay for a while
Don't let them bring you down
Those sorrows you cannot hide
They're tearing you up inside
Another day will come
When you lay your burdens down
