In the times of my trial
The days slowly moved along
But nothing ever changed
I struggled to maintain what was left
Tried to find some peace of mind

Days filled with nothing
And no hope in sight
Close to losing all ambitions
I could not endure
In a deteriorating situation

Restless sleep
Again and again
I cried out in the name of desperation
Endless nights and shattered expectations
Haunted my day

I poured myself out
Tired of longing
Awaited the sunrise
But life could get no colder
I vanished into obscurity
No means of solace, no sign of liberation
In a hopeless reality

I could not endure
As life grew ever bleaker

Restless sleep...

But as I reflect upon time I realize
I made it through one of my worst afflictions
Carried through when times were hard
Found a meaning in a hopeless situation
Found peace by time

Through a somber fall and burdened winter
With my mind set I resolved the strife
My adversary can no longer hold me down
Because there is still a fire burning
I stand bold and strong
And hope to stay positive and live among dreamers

Experience the value of life through pain
Rise above the depraved
Ever vigilant, poised to rise against
Set sail against the wind
Rather fail, than never try at all
Reach for the stars
