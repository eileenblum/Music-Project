Saw a bright of confidence in your eyes
Two mirrors reflecting my own desire
I walked to your smile, and there died my dreams

A beginning faster than any thought
No one got so close as you did before
Poisoned tongue, firing your words

[Pre]
Iâll never know what you got with my pain
What are the rules, of the game we have played, 'cause

[Chorus]
You, ate my heart and ate my flesh
And proclaimed your innocence
While my blood run through your lips
And I lay dead, at your feet
But my anger burns inside
And you have nowhere to hide
Oh my little butterfly I will not rest
'Till you die!!!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
