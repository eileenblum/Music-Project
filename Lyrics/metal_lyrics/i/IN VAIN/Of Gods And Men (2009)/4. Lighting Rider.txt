A new age soon will come
Brought by tears of the ones
Who live and die in pain

The prayers fill the air
And get at last to the right place
The hidden greatest reign

[Pre]
Another lie, another crime, another sleepless night
The need of sanity and hope
So now it's time to sing my song
Another king must fall

[Chorus]
Midnight fighter, sent by elder gods of rain and stone
You prayed for my return
Lightning rider, keeper of the secrets of the stone
I'll purify this world

[Solo]

Time is running out
For those who put upon your head
The oppressive boots of death

Let the helpless win this day
Their avenger ride again the Earth
I bring what they deserve

[Pre]

[Chorus 2x]
