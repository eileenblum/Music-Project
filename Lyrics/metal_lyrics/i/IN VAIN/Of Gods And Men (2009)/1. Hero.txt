Dark comes the dawn, dark seems my fate
Out of the walls a dog's crying my name
The God's puppet fights with their shield while my flesh bites the steel

Think you are brave, I see your game
Divine goats you have, but will you face a certain death with just mortal hands?

[Pre:]
I'm the hero of men
You're an Olympus pet
I get the glory you'll never deserve

[Chorus:]
Destiny, sent me an invitation
Agony, shall ride by my side
Fuck your blood and suffer your damnation
Hector holds the anthem of the human pride

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Pre]

[Chorus 2x]
