Killing pyres, illuminating the way
To the greatest false illusion
Five hundred years ago, our ignorance was their strength
And goodness their disguise

[Pre:]
I donât know, the time when one of us destroyed the chains
But the knowledge gave us freedom to decide
You sowed death, don't feel amazed because you harvest hate
Now your time is running out

[Chorus:]
Wisdom times
Blind faith's fallen
With the rotten cross

Still trying to impose today, your fucking moral code
When the crowds spit on your faces
Get locked inside your church, and stay there till you die
I swear Iâll try you don't get burnt

[Pre]

[Chorus]
