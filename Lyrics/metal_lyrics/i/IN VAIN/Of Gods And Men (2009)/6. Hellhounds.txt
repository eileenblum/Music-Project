[Devil:]
Look back! They're running just behind
Barking with fire in their throats
My Hell Hounds will find you anywhere
They bring me every condemned soul
Cold and paralyzing, black death filling their eyes
A smashing fear crush your spine
Flesh, blood, bones, skin fall under their fangs of steel
Think you have suffered? Wait for me...

[Templar:]
Thought I was in the right side
All of my acts follow His guide
Now my worst nightmare runs behind
Why am I a condemned soul?
Killing for justice all my life
Now for salvation I must fight

[God:]
You were useful for my plans but now you're scum
For your obedience be proud, our faith grows strong
But the blood that stains your steel claims for your soul

[The Hounds:]
Please run! Give us an endless race
Seeking your fear across the lands
We see now your staggering silhouette
The sword is falling from your hands
Face to face reaction, someone you've seen before
Your fallen comrades turned to beasts
You cry, you pray and all in vain
Scream while we rip your flesh
Join us and pay as well our sins

[Templar:]
Thought I was in the right side
All of my acts follow His guide
Now my worst nightmare runs behind
Why am I a condemned soul?
Killing for justice all my life
Into the abyss now I ride

[God:]
You were useful for my plans but now you're scum
For your obedience be proud, our faith grows strong
But the blood that stains your steel claims for your soul
