Their spirits will rise
They will rise at the end of time
Now they ride with the wind
Across the lands of the ancient times
They possess memories of glory and fall
Their spirits will rise
Arise at the end of time

"Banished and betrayed, hunted by empires
Slaughtered in numbers, killed by plagues
The people were brave, but they were chosen to die
In the end they found rest in their promised green land

Once they moved like the wind, now their spirits ride with the wind

Their presence still lives in their pillaged lands"
