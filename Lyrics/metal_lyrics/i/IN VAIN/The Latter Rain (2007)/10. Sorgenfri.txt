Fire
The fire within
The fire in our hearts will keep us alive
The hope for a better day
The strength of will (the will of a martyr)
Together we will see another day

Need for perseverance
Cause life is hard
Painful fact known to all
There will be no more pain
Our inner flame gives hope
The fire brings rest to weary souls

Every tear in our eyes will be wiped away
There will be no more death, no mourning
The old order of things will perish
The soul is quiet, the world is empty

And everything is vacant

Together
We will find our way
Freed from the shackles of discord and repine
Always remember
A brand new morning will come
In times of sorrow, in times of pain

Hold on
To the bitter end
Through worst tempest we shall stand adamant
We shall not be moved
In the midst of a storm
For the sake of mankind
We will overcome
