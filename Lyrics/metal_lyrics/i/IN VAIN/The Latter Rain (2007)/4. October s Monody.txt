Like a thief in the night.
I didn't see it coming.
As it creaped nearby.
It burns.
Destruction in it's wake.

Ashes by ashes.
It will all fall apart.
Screams in the night.
No mercy to be found.
Agony rises.
Dismay and fright.
Hope is fading.
No sign of daylight.

Apathy fills the room.

Discourage takes control.
Taking what is left.
No more strength to find.
You will find no cure for this.

Ashes by ashes.
It will all fall apart.
Screams in the night.
No mercy to be found.
Agony rises.
Dismay and fright.
Hope is fading.
No sign of daylight.

I wish I could find a ship and just sail on by.
Let the wind guide me all the way.
Watch all the birds leave and follow them.
In search for warmer land.

The rebirth of time.
Will leave no man behind.
The rebirth of time.
Will conclude the faith of all mankind.

Relieve us of our torment.
