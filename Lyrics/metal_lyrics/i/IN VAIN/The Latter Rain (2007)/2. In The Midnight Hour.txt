In the midnight hour
The moment it all will come down
The earth will roar and its people will tremble
As the unforeseeable comes to pass
In the roaring of the midnight hour
Some day

Beware until morning comes

Some will succumb, but some will never surrender
Their agonized screams abruptly quelled
In this moment families will be torn apart
In the roaring of the midnight hour
Some day

Beware until morning comes

A world full of hate
Where love is weakness
People are deceived by snakes
So many fail to see through their veil of lies
Man striving for none but himself
Human greed drives this world to the edge
One day will they all regret
In the midnight hour

In the midnight hour
The moment it all will come down
The earth will shake and people shiver
The unforeseeable will come to pass
In the roaring of the midnight hour
Some day

People will fall and some will never surrender
The masses, raped, cry out in pain
When it will happen families will be ripped apart
In the roaring of the midnight hour
Some day

Beware until morning comes

Morning brings the rising sun
The beginning of a new world

Serenity, deliverance
For some

Hear the pounding of the drums
The moment of truth will rend all we knew
Hear the sound of the mighty horn
In a winter night so glimmering and
cold eternity will rise
