So there he was again.
Standing on the edge of massive cliffs.
Longing for separation, longing for release.
Yet he is unable to claim liberation.

Still he is affected by the years from the past.
He screams out in vain.
Raises his voice, but it cracks.
Leaving wrathful echoes in the crest.

Caught within!
Naked like a child at birth, left out in the dark.
Crying like a child that hurts, forever to mourn.

The struggle continues.
He tries to forget â a seed of life is sowed.
He regains control â appearing as a glimpse of bliss.
When he draws himself up, it all seem so clear.
He won't remorse.
His feet stumbles the first steps of the trail.

The journey has begun.
To return to where he belongs.
The march leads upon unknown paths, giving new perspectives.
He attends a funeral of the old.

Finally home and a cold wind blows in his face.
He watches his friends come to his rescue, or...

They stare at him with a fleeting glance.
He replies quietly, believes he is forgiven.
But again he is deceived.
Betrayed by those he loved.

The old man wipes the dust off his jacket.
I guess, for some the sun never sets...
