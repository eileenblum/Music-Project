A strange dream brought me into to a mortal state of mind.
All of a sudden a shadow whispered: "Come!"
By it's presence I was enticed into a divine dimension.
I became able to see through time.

I saw how it all would end.
I witnessed the nature decay.

Through the mist in my dream, it all came clear
There is no future.
Dreams will be shattered and hope will vanish in the night

The revenant followed me through the fields.
He guided me past the inner circle.
It was beyond time I realized.
What was to come.

I saw how the world would end.
I witnessed the fall of mankind.

Through the mist in my dream, it all came clear
There is no future.
Dreams will be shattered and hope will vanish in the night

Suddenly a voice broke the silence:
"Release us while I'm still breathing!"
I looked for spread of hope, but found none.
The moon had called for the night.

Slowly demoralizedâ¦
My face turned pale.
I saw dreary people everywhere.
Most of them had lost some of their friends.
I watched them mourn, as they searched for survivors among the dead.

We have been led to believe the untrue, forced to kiss our king on his feet.
I saw how it all would end.
I witnessed the nature decay.

Through the mist in my dream, it all came clear
There is no future.
Dreams will be shattered and hope will vanish in the night
