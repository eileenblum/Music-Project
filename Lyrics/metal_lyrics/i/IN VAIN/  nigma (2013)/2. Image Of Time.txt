Walk through the branches
And see into it all
Walk through the branches
And hear mother nature's call
That will rise again

Travel along the contours
In a landscape with no boundaries
Follow the roads into the unknown
Along the path of our ancestors

Summon the aura
And the species we have seen
Envision a lost world
Before it was torn by hands of man

Red leaves from the tree
The tree of life
Cast by the wind
Down in the beckoning hollow

One time in history
We lived in harmony with the earth
We chanted around the campfires
And gazed into the mysteries of the stars

Red leaves from the tree
The tree of life
Cast by the wind
Down in the beckoning hollow

One time in history
We lived in harmony with the earth
We chanted around the campfires
And gazed into the mysteries of the stars
Wandering across the open plains
To a promised green
Free feet among the whispering grass
That stretches further than the eyes can see

Summon the aura
And the species we have seen
Envision a lost world
Before it was torn by hands of man

Travel along the contours
In a landscape with no boundaries
Follow the roads into the unknown
Along the path of our ancestors
Nature is an image of time

One time in history
We lived in harmony with the earth
We chanted around the campfires
And gazed into the mysteries of the stars
An endless chase for new resources
Constant pace towards the end
As a testament to our forefathers
In our lives we honour them

From the peak of the mountains
We ponder upon creation
Seasons gone by and seasons to come
Nature is an image of time
