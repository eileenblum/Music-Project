I have crossed the plains of opulence
And sent truthfulness to the grave
I have fled from true serenity
And left the origin behind
The decades are passing by

Times of yore
I've seen enough
Forlorn the gifts of life

Witnessing our nation descend into chaos
Called upon the times of yore
I fled from the true tranquility
To prevail the ways of life
The dacades keep passing by

Times of yore
I've seen enough
Forlorn the gifts of life

Calling times of yore

Falling to the gore
Misled by a materialistic society
Back to the country where I belong
Calling times of yore
Falling to the gore
Times of yore
The country where serenity prevails

I keep searching for utter sincerity
I'm going back to where I came from
Times of yore
