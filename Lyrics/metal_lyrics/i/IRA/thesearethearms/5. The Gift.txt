Caring is easy - but who cares
Creeping is easy - but I don't creep

I give up the past - pass it away
I give up the past - pass it away

Playing is easy - but I don't play
Sleeping is easy - but I'm awake

I give up the past - pass it away
I give up the past - pass it away
Playing is my passion
I pass your gifts away
I will give up the past
Will never be a child again
Will never be a fool again

Brother failure - welcome...
