We are worried
About your welfare
About the things you do

I was born with a silverspoon
In my mouth
And I will keep it forever

This is something
I don't want to share with you
And it could save your life
It could save you

I was born with a silverspoon
In my mouth
And I will keep it forever

I was raised with a banknote
Stuck between my teeth
And I learned to speak

This could save you
This could be you

What if it goes on...

And what if I don't care
If this never ends
And with my opened eyes
What if I'm still asleep?

What if it goes on...
