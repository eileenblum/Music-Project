I'm not sure if it's me
When I talk to you I talk to myself

I hurt you with my words
Put the finger in your flesh

You bleed like a slaughtered lamb
Your pretty dream is long gone

You speak through me like a voice
And I'm yours
I'm your lamb

We are the same and you are in me
Half blind half happy sweet slavery
For you I would hurt myself
Change myself

I'm your slave
I'm a little lamb

I don't care who you are
I don't have a story to tell
I only use the word lamb to describe

It's just a phrase
Don't blame me
Think for yourself
Listen to yourself
Listen to yourself

Listen to me
