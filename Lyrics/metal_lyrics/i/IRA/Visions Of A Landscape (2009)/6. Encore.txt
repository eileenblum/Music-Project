Poor young lonely stranger boy
Ideals in your chest
And you are sure that you do the best
Playing around with all those toys

Say hello to the preachman
He tells us how it works
I hang on your lips when you speak about pestilence
Please give me some sense

I know you can - yes you can

Welcome to the new life
Feel free to love yourself
Welcome to this hardcore show
Feel free to hate yourself
Welcome to the core
Feel free to lose yourself
Feel free

Because the world is good
Because the world is bad
Because the people are sick
Because you are okay
Because the fires are burning
Because there is no learning

Is there learning?

This is the encore...
