Searching for an image
To tell you something about my time
What is wrong and what is right
That question is also mine
Standing on a thin red line
No answer there to free our minds

There must be an image
That tells you something about my time
What is darkness and where is light
That question is also mine
Standing on a thin red line
No answer there to free our minds

I believe
This mind is mine
I believe
This vision is mine
And I hope
This mind is mine
I believe
This vision is mine

There is need for a change for a vision of a landscape

You say there are no miracles - but what makes you so sure?
You say there is no hope - but do you have a cure?
Are you passionate with what you do?

Through the eyes of an insect
Maybe god is watching you
God is watching you

The clocks end the time
They have the clocks but we have the time
The have the clocks
But we have the time...
