Everybody is in the mood for dying
Or just wants to leave
Everybody is in the mood for lying
Or does not believe
Everybody could be somebody else
Somewhere else
Everybody is in the mood for loving
Or sleeps love away
Everybody is in the mood for falling
And fails every day
Everybody is in the mood for dying
And dies every day

War is over
If you want it
Peace is over
If you want it
Faith is over
If you want it
You are nothing
If you want it

Won't you resist it
Won't you forgive
Won't you believe it
Won't you release it
Won't you speak to me?

War is over...
