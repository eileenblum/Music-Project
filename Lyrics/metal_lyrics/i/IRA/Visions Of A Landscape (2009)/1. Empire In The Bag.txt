When robots pass by sucking out each others oil
When presidents say "We're sorry" or when passengers die
When people create laws speaking in an unknown language
When there are no questions left you know you're in their claws

But who are they and have you ever seen them?

Maybe you will walk with an empire in your bag
Maybe you will stop 'cause you're stuck with yourself
With a bomb in your head with an empire in your back
With a bomb in your bag with an empire in your head

Stumbling through the woods - plundering
You know greed is just a word
Watch the seas how they burn is there anyone left laughing
And is this really the end of the people?

We are a system and you are not the change
This is the people and this is the machine
God blessed the machine

This is not the end of the people
This is not the end of the world

Is there anyone left laughing?

This is not the end of the people...
