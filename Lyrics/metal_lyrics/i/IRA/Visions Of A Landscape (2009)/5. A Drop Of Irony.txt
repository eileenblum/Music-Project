Some kind of isolation is growing in your head
Another common conversation needs to be fed

Where gods hide themselves
Where angels live in cells

This is a strange place
I yelled before I fell

The trees spread their legs
The snowman comes alive
Let god know how it is
To live a life

A drop of irony
Is a glimpse of hope

Everything changes
Everything stays the same
Everything;s in bloom and grows
Everything goes to hell

A taste of life
Is a glimpse of hope

The trees spread their legs
The snowman comes alive
The night is full of lights/dreams/noise
The asphalt becomes grass
