"Keep your ear on the ground
The story is in the soil"
- it's in the soil
Keep your senses naked - open
Watch out for a sign
- outside
It's all on you
DonÂ´t be washed away from the flood
- wash away the flood
See and wonder how it feels
- do you know how it feels?

Do you know how it feels
Do you know about me

Keep your ear on the ground
It's all in the soil

Do you find the time
To find your mind
DonÂ´t believe in yourself
DonÂ´t believe in me
Put your hands on the ground
Pick up a leaf of grass
Keep your mouth shut
DonÂ´t turn your head away

Now put your hands on the ground
Pick up a leaf of grass
And listen to the sound
Just pick up a leaf of grass
