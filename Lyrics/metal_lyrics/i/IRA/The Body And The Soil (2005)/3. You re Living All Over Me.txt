A few million pictures
I can not focus all
I am caught between the lines
Except when you are here
We are on the run
Yes and you know my name
You talk to me
With thousand voices
YouÂ´re living all over me

This is a planet full of news
You give me too much views
I need more space to think my thoughts
To fill me up with emptiness

You fuck me up with pictures - dreams - and the noise
ItÂ´s too loud out here to hear my own voice
Between two pictures we fall apart
I need some silence I need some love
Give me a little silence

YouÂ´re living all over me

DonÂ´t touch me
DonÂ´t touch me
DonÂ´t talk to me

Touch it
Touch it
Touch it
Touch it

Touch
Talk
Touch
