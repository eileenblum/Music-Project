Between these meaningless words
"I search for the language
That is also yours"
Let me kiss the words from your lips
Let me touch your tongue
Breathe your breath
Taste your skin

I am slaved by language
I am slaved by you
I am a tool for you
Another word in your notebook
I search for the language
Long live itÂ´s parts
Long live the parts

Long live the stars
Long live the eye
Long live the soul
Long live the sky
Long live the hearts
Long live the the love
Long live the trust
Long live the pain
..the cock ..the cunt ..the telephone ..the madman ..the machine ..the gods ..the mirrors ..the animals ..the children ..the screens ..the dead ..the voice ..the poem ..the poets ..the music ..the asshole
Long live the ecstasy
Long live the abyss
Long live the disease
Long live the body
Long live the junkie
Long live the hope
Long live the fields
Long live the sun
Long live the things

Long live itÂ´s parts
Long live the parts
