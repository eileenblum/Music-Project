We rot inside the depths of our own minds
Seeking a place of comfort,
But instead finding only turmoil and disorder
Utter disarray disrupts inner harmony
As we search for the catalyst that lies within us all,
They are perched on their thrones awaiting our downfall
And until I seek what is truly mine,
I will not see past the dark design
Brick by brick they build a wall,
Brick by brick they will blind us all
We must stray from the pack and be our own
We must be the candle in this cold dark room
With our flame ever rising, freeing us from this tomb
Can this be that weâve been deceived?
Within these four walls a small flame breathes, and reaches for the sky
We rot inside the depths of the dark design.
