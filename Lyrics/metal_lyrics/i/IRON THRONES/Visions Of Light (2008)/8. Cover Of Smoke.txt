Dreams have led me here,
Lost in silence,
The darkness surrounds,
Searching for something more
I can feel a breath of air,
Rising to touch pale skin
A gentle caress brings me back
Iâll wait for you, locked away
I hold the key to this room
I hope you find, find your way,
Lost within the cover of smoke a voice cries out,
I will save you from yourself
Here we wait while hope still sleeps,
The beautiful entry now a solid door to pass through
The water breaks against stone,
We find ourselves close to home
Lost within the cover of smoke a voice cries out,
You are not alone,
I will save you,
Lost within the cover of smoke a voice cries out,
You are not alone,
I will save you from yourself
There are statues along the way to keep us safe,
Below the sand disappears,
And our footprints fade in the wake
The trail left behind escapes under the cover of night
Moving into the dim light,
We have made it at last
This is ours alone,
This is ours to hold
Never let go.
