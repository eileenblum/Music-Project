Weâve followed these set paths for far too long,
And our feet grow weary of the familiar
Our minds strive for a conduit of expression,
Yet we shiver in the cold,
Alone in the darkness
When we reach for the stars,
They only seem further away,
But that never stopped us and today is our day
With these shadows revealed,
Our reflection is finally true
This time we will never stop reaching,
Until we are consumed by the light,
Inching our way from darkness to forever escape its cold bite
In a place of peace is where we shall be,
For the rest of our days
This is our creation in every way.
