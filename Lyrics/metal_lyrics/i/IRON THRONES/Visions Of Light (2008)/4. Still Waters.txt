We all scratch at the walls,
Trying to get some kind of grip
In hopes of finding our way out of the fog,
And have our eyes be graced by the vivid brightness
The beauty that lies outside the boundaries
This docile valley struggles to breathe,
Void of reality,
And complexed by depression
The water still rises just as a string section
This music for the first time has hit my ears
This never changing life,
I must erase,
Determination gleaming in my eyes like tears,
I believe this is the first time Iâve seen my real face,
Please believe
Let your true colors be your guide,
For you are the only resident of your mind
Together lets escape these still waters,
Let this current flow no more
Turn out its light and shut the door.
