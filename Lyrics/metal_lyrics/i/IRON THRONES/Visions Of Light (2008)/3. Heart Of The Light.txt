I believe there is beauty within the deep, hidden from our eyes to see
This place where everything comes to life in disconnected pieces
Buried in the desperate words of desperate men
Stare into the mirror,
Afraid of whatâs inside
The sun will burn away all desire,
The sun will heal us with its fire
I believe there is beauty within the deep, hidden from our eyes to see
This place where everything comes to life in disconnected pieces
Buried in the desperate words of desperate men
Sitting silently,
Feeling the beat of my heart,
Waiting for a sound to,
Come and take, take me away
Dancing in the heart of the light,
Shadows stir desperate for life,
This troubled mind will find relief
In the wake of disbelief
I came to feel the fire,
Let it come for me
Take my hand and steady my sway,
Take my hand and steady my sway,
I came to feel the fire,
Let it come for me
Waiting for the light to fade,
Watching as the flames consume,
Everything will burn (in our eyes)
Everything will burn (in our eyes)
Thereâs a voice in the heart of the light, pulling me in
My head is pounding now, to the rhythm of the glow
I can feel the fire now,
I can feel the flames move in,
I can see the end of the road,
Now I can finally sleep.
