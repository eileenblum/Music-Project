I watched as the fissures formed 
Splinters in the unbreakable sky 
And as the pieces fell to earth 
I knew my foundation of existence was lost 

The path that lead us here is now nothing more than a barren wasteland. 

This broken ground barely holds the weight of me 
The foundation has dissolved to sand and mortar 
The wretched sun no longer shines down on me 
All light has gone from the sky 

A ghostly road where we hear nothing but the whispers through the trees. 
This is the day when the world shattered, 
because the sky came falling down. 
Now I barely speak. Now I barely sleep. 
Trapped inside me is a tragic outcome. 
This is now a hollowed version of me. 

The path that lead us here is now nothing more than a barren wasteland. 
Now the demon awakes inside these walls, 
and tears into flesh that only bled for her. 
Burned down and burnt out. 
This pile of ashes no longer reflects 
the radiance of the flames that we once created. 
Instead it lies there as a reminder of hollow words 
and hollow years that I never desired to see.
