A slowly winding wind 
Carries me blindly towards the unknown 
With fog as thick as death 
I can only hope this is a dream 

Why does this blinding radiant light 
Not brighten the darkness within your eyes? 

Out of the mist your figure appears 
We walk down this shadowed path 
But your feet never touch the ground 
With hand in ghostly hand 
Beneath a sky not of this world 
Can you not see the sun your presence creates? 

Why does this blinding radiant light 
Not brighten the darkness within your eyes? 

As a cold feeling grips my throat 
I know that this moment is fleeting 

There must be a way 

Come back with me 
Into the flesh and blood! 
Is it not better to die with me 
Than never to live at all? 

But you were never there 
You were never there 
As I cry into her hollow chest again, 
I'm reminded of the false reality that is 

As I cry into her hollow chest again, 
I awake 

Is this a shell that become one with me? 
Or did I dig too hard against the grain? 
And as this room loses warmth 
And the light fades from my eyes, 
I'm haunted by your promises 
That everything will be all right
