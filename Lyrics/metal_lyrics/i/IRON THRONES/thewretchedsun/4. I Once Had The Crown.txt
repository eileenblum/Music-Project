Standing on top of the world and looking down. 
I'm mesmerized by the beauty of this light we have created. 
As we watch the years pass us by, we sit together and let the music sleep in our ears. 
This is how it was always supposed to be, just you and me. 

The look in your eyes is slowly becoming distant. 
But I dig my nails in deep and hold on for dear life. 
Once our memories fade our footsteps will disappear. 
The path will no longer be brightly lit by your tainted light. 
I thought you were walking beside me, only to find out that you were never there. 

I thought you carried me when only one set of footprints were visible. 
Now I know I was walking alone. 
You were never there. 
Now I fear I must walk alone, and it makes me feel empty and cold. 
My feet are heavier than ever before. 
As the storm rolls in I prepare for war. 
Stuck inside my own mind and lost within the sands of time.
