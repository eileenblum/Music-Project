Just a hollow shell making my way through life 
Drawn in by the radiance of the light 
The blinding beauty I see in your eyes 
The first embrace 
The warmth of your skin 
Desire deceived 
Like a moth to flame 

The beginning of a great adventure, 
I'll no longer walk this path alone 
The fear of flying to close to the flame 
never crossed my mind 
If my wings do burn and I fall towards the ground, 
our memories would be worth the fall 

You left me without words 
Tongue tied in a knot of anxiety 
I knew I needed you 
The blinding beauty I see in your eyes 
The first embrace 
The warmth of your skin 
Desire deceived 
Like a moth to flame 

Spiraling towards a wavering brilliant moon, 
Betrayed by the very instincts that guide my way 
Although the unfamiliar glow 
Should have warned me of blinded senses, 
The smoldering heat could not dissuade my path 

We are the ocean waves upon the crest 
We could crash or we could flow 
But only we will ever know 

We are the ocean waves upon the crest 
In a storm you are the only vessel, 
Left untouched by the squall 
A shining star that guides me home 
Drawing me in 
Like a moth to flame 
Guide me home 

Spread out over the distance 
is the road that we shall walk 
Step by step 
Hand in hand
