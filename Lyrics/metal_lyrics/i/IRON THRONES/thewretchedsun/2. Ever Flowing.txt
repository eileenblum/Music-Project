The path goes on and on 
But we walk hand in hand 
Fighting off the swarm 
The cold realization 

That life is not what we expected 
But we continue together and pick each other up 
When the other has fallen 

Flowing like the water that runs through the earth 
And nobody knows where it will lead us, 
Yet there is a sense of comfort in not knowing 

As long as you're by my side then flow we shall, 
No matter what the direction 
The gravity of this endeavor determines our course 

Forever is a word you mutter often, 
Adding brick by brick to our foundation 
But are we setting ourselves up for failure? 

Time will tell 

Every now and then we stumble and stutter, 
Yet the outcome is always the same 
We pick up our tired feet and carry on, 
because I have you and you have me 

The path goes on and on 
but we walk hand in hand 
fighting off the swarm. 

Anything that comes our way 
We will climb the steepest of mountains, 
And break the strongest of barriers 
Flowing like the water that runs through the earth.
