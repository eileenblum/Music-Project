There is a bond between creations and creators
We are one in the same
We are experiencing the dawning of a new age
The shackles of suffering and greed are falling away; the surfacing of consciousness
As we shed this third dimension, we are witnessing the breaking of the world
Aquarius
Dark entities are moving upon the face of the earth, projections of disharmony
Ascend and realize the true meaning of our existence

Coexisting between holographic galaxies,
We confuse reality
We must not let the powers that be deceive us any longer
The voice within is the only true constant,
The mind's eye is the gate to all that is
All is one

Close your eyes and make contact

Light beings guide us from a distance
Calculating space by means of galactic understanding
This vibration is a choice of spiritual manifestation
