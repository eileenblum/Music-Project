The poles have shifted, the tides are turning
Time is speeding up and the money is burning
Shifting beyond the age of yearning,
Paradise found in the culling occuring
Now that the earth is purging entities feeding on our suffering, I am no longer enslaved by this cycle
The people are rising, the sleeping giant will wake once again
March to the gallows,
With your tail between your legs like a dog
How does it feel to know you'll take your last breath with roaring applause?
Fuck your philosophy
Fuck your New World Order
Fuck it.
