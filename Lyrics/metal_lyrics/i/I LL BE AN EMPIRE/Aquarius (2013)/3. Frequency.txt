Subliminally altering mind frequencies,
With intentions of mass consumption through product enslavement
Mindless servants indulge in the altered perception,
Brainwave enslavement affecting our judgement of reality
Sit and stare, for hours and hours, wasting the life you are given
Never questioning, only bred to consume and obey
This is not the meaning of life, the meaning of love,
This is a prison without the bars, an illusion of free choice

Subliminally altering mind frequencies,
With intentions of mass consumption through product enslavement
Mindless servants indulge in the altered perception

Sit and stare, for hours and hours
