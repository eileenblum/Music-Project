What have you done?
This is not the place I remember
Crystal springs, clear blue skies
Now replaced by aluminum, barium
There is poison in the sky and poison in the water
There are chemicals in the tap water
Fluoride is calcifying your pineal gland, deterring critical thinking
A blindfold for the mind's eye
A blindfold for the masses
You've been deceived, I am a guardian of the galaxy
There is no hostility among my people
We operate on higher frequencies
I am here to help you through these changes
Lights will go out, and glass will shatter
For freedom will resound in the hearts of your courageous race
Rise up, and become who you were meant to be
There is so much more,
Create your own reality
Create the world you want to see

The kingdom of heaven is within you, in forgiveness lies the stoppage of the wheel of karma
