Can you experience me on this frequency?
Are you following patterns, are you a slave to this vicious cycle
Open your mind, this is an illusion
Its just a matrix
We're just rats in the fucking cage
The wheel just keeps spinning and spinning and spinning
Over and over again
I've been molded to be just another cog in the machine
But I'm breaking free
You bring the oil and I'll bring the gasoline
Burn it all, burn it to the ground
Burn it to the fucking ground
Burn it all, burn it to the fucking ground
Stack the money in the streets and burn it to the ground
