I can see it all
The heartbeat of the universe
Presented before me, uncovering the subatomic framework
Bringing forth visions of immortality
Atomic dissipation
Watching as my essence escapes me
I am gone, but my mind lives on
Soaring through an abundance of emptiness
Senses are not of relevance
I find comfort in omnipresence

Enticed by ancient patterns
I begin to understand I can see it all
Transcend into the astral realm

A new awakening shows truth
Our world is an illusion
Painted upon us by beings once among us
