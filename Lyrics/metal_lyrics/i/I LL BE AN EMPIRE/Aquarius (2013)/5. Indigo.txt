It's so god damn depressing watching the human race devolve into a drone-like state,
A mindless vessel
A projection of disharmony within us all

I am awakened but it comes with a price
I feel so fucking alone, like no one's listening
Looking back, its been a long fall down the rabbit hole
I never thought I'd be here now
Holding a flame to the Wall Street

Molotov in hand, a heart burning for humanity
I will have my freedom, one way or the other
Molotov in hand, a heart burning for humanity
I will have my freedom, one way or the other
