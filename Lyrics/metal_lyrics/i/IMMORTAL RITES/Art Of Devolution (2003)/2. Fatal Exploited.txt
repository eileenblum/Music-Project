I can't identify myself
With the life as a machine
Working well-earned to feed
Our state to pleasure their needs
Forevermore fucked we will be
With our leaders in our democracy
Wake up, wake up and you will see
Taken our money with taht hypocrisy

[pre-chorus:]

Open your eyes
This is for you
They come they take
Another law another fake

[chorus:]
Fatal exploited fatal [2x]

We are the little bastards inside
Who keep the economy alive
Asurrance tax is coming next
Human being is what they dissect
I am a revolutionsoul for the free
Another spine against insanity
At least we are the youth today
Searching the way out of the grey
