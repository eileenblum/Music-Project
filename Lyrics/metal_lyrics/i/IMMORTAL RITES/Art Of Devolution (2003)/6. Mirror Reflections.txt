Mirror mirror on the wall
Why are we chosen to fall?
That's the question of all
How can we get immortal????

Blind on an oneway road
Drifting into a dying future
Will we find a solution?
Maybe at the end of the line

At the end of the line

[chorus:]
Wasting time has begun
That's the answer maybe I'm wrong
Leaves me alone this work is done
I will go out and have some fun

I'm feeling young and free
Escaped from that philosophy
I breaked down this wall
Mirror mirror thanx for all....

[chorus]
