About all who have died
Who left this world behind
Where time seemed to stand still
Others be glad they were killed
Symbols altering in ruins
Ground zero give it's birth
An option we can't change
We see security has failed!!!!!!

Turn the page
And see for what they've sold their mind
Sold their mind

Turn the page
And see they're hater of all mankind

[chorus:]
Commandments are consumed
Shivers of a new terror world

Fighing what can't be fought
Martyr in a drug called faith
Choking on the rage of the insane
Buried by an error of thousand minds

Echoes of innocence
No control who raped their souls???
Political shroud that we all wear????
Pathetic patterns unchanged!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
