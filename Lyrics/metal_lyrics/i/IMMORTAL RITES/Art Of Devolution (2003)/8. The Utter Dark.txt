Passing onwards to dimension zero
Walk the path of nocturnal fire

No return; descending into the abyss of time
Winds of creation -downfall of mankinds creation
As night conquers day
We're lost in the utter dark
The utter dark

[chorus:]
Embraced by the dead
The nectar of life
Dries out no escape
Embraced by the dead
The nectar of life
Colours lost their bright - lloooossst!!!!!

Passing onwards to dimension zero
Where colours lost their bright...... their bright!!!!!!!!!!

Dusk sets its spirit free
Nightfall starts to reign forever
Mist rises from the frozen ground
The final darkness is unbound

Demise; descending into the abyss of time
Winds of creation - downfall of mankinds creation
Final state of insanity
Awaiting the last slumber to come............................

[chorus]
