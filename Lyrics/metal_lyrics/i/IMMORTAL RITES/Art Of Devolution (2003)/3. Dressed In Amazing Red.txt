I'm on the way to load my gun
I want to make a bullet run
You better remember my name
'cause I'm the man you go insane
You are losing your mind
When I'm losing control
You are losing your mind
As your head looks like a hole

[chorus:]
Alright!!!!!!!!!
Now I'm satisfied life goes on
And I'm looking what I've done
Was it good or was it bad
I know that I haven't lost my head

There is nothingmore to say
I bring you silence when I slay
You show me everything I need
My pleasures of lust and greed
You're dressed in amazing red
And you know soon comes the dead
Through your eyes never be alive
Through my eyes a nice bullet ride!!!!!!!!

[chorus]

I killed you
I raped you
I killed you
I raped you

[chorus]
