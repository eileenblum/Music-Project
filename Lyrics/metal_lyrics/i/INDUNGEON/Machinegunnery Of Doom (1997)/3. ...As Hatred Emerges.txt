In tile of darkness
the power of war arise.
Out from the shadow
striving to own tomorrow.
Driven onwards by powers unknown,
in search for glory they enter the warzone.

In this raging no-mans-land
fear is put aside.

The troops of victory gain their pride
as hatred emerges from inside.

The arriving forces lose control
as hatred emerges from inside.

In this devastating Armageddon
no mercy can be reached,
as enemy are outnumbered
by the divisions just unleashed.
