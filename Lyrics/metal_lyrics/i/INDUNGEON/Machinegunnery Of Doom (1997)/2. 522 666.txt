From an unknown galaxy
millions of solar years away,
we came to your earth
with technology unknown to you.

From beyond the stars we came.
Human race had met its superior.
Defended you with simple weapons,
against high technology.

Encountered by a higher civilization.
Invasion!

From beyond the stars we came.
conquered you planet.
Eradicated the race of earth,
and returned with a newfound life form.

Brought through the galaxies.
Born past distant stars.

From an unknown galaxy
millions of solar years away,
we came to your earth
with technology unknown to you.

From beyond the stars we came.
Human race had met its superior.
Defended you with simple weapons,
against high technology.
