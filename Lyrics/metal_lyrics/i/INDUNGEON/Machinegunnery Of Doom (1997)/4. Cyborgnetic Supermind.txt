A new life form is born.
A creation of science
with a digital mind
and muscles of steel.
It soon gains control.

The new order is soon to begin.
An order of enslaved mankind
and a cyborgnetic supermind.

Cyborgnetic supermind.
Cyborgnetic supermind.

The human machines
control all of flesh and blood.
Mankind forced into submission.
It's final chapter of life.

History falls into oblivion
if this systematic clean-out succeeds.
Our own intelligence cleans out our breed.

Cyborgnetic supermind.
Cyborgnetic supermind.

The world has got a new
leading race who rules
with horror, mania and brutality.
Only death can release me from this agony.
