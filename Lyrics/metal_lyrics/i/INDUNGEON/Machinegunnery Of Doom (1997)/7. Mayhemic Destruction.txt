Like a cyclone I'm invading the warzone.
Raping, ripping ans slashing.
Invading with pleasure but for you I am pain.
Tormenting, tearing and hacking.
Total devastation and utter death.
When I am done there will be no one
left for no one will escape my
mayhemic destruction.

Raping, ripping and slashing.
Tormenting, tearing and hacking.
mayhemic destruction!
mayhemic destruction!

The humans have now faces their destiny.
Erased are they who crossed my mayhemic warfare.
Left are ashes from where I raise with
power and glory.
And like a cyclone I invade the next warzone.

I'll strike with furious anger and no one will escape
my mayhemic destruction!

Raping, ripping and slashing.
Tormenting, tearing and hacking.
mayhemic destruction!
mayhemic destruction!
