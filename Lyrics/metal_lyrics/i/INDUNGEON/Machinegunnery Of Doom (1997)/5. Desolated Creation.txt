Remains of human life!
Death, misery and infertility.
Products of an intelligent life form!
Mutations, desolations and radioactivity.

Among the rest of the technological failure,
the fragments of civilization lies scattered.
Among the ruins of the last generation.

Disrupted harmony fades away into oblivion!

This is a creation of capitalization.
A collapse of increasing population.

The extreme population
led to mass exploitation.
But the rest products of society
led to a chemical extinction.

Remains of human life!
Death, misery and infertility.
Products of an intelligent life form!
Mutations.
