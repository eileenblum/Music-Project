I walk through
the ashes of civilization.
I do behold
my world of great attraction.

Some survivors escaped this planet
for a new life on the space colony.
But most people stayed
in my world of mourning and misery.

Genetic mutations do rapidly increase
'cause of the nuclear disease.

I walk through
the ashes of civilization.
I do behold
my world of great attraction.

Mutated bodies lie
scattered everywhere.
It's now an everyday sight
but who cares?

I walk through
the ashes of civilization.
I do behold
my world of great attraction.
