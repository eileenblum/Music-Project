These years of your ignorant threats
has now reached it's end.
Furiously I raise my arms
in sign of total war.
Nuclear launches are on it's way,
they will pulverize you into dust.
Divisions of panzar are on its move,
expect on global extinction.

I'm charging against you.
I'll fight you until death.
I'm charging against you.
Prepare for your final breath.

Extinction!
Your scales of survival will reach its bottom.
Invasion!
Your feeble power will be erased
as we gain control.

Here you have my pace treaty:
Surrender or fight! Fight!

I'm charging against you.
I'll fight you until death.
I'm charging against you.
Prepare for your final breath.
