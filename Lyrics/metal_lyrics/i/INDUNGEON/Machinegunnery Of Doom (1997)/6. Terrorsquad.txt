Battlestorm assault from hell.
Helldivisions, destroyers of all.
Conquer the lesser races,
destroy all in sight.
All life suffer all life end,
the earth laid in ruins
when this final war will end.

Terrorsquad!
Burns and desecrates.
Terrorsquad!
Slays and annihilates.

The dead shall outnumber the living.
Those who remains shall be dragged in chains,
to the pits of hell for everlasting torment.
Towards the empire,
the dominions of anguish and doom.

We are terrorsquad, the troops from hell!

Terrorsquad!
Burns and desecrates.
Terrorsquad!
Slays and annihilates.
