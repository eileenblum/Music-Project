Nothing can harm me
As I moul you down with me
Battletank in furious revenge.
You can not escape from me
As I blow your shelters away
with my blazing death machinery.

Battletank No.1
will not let you survive.
It will always conquer new land
it will never leave you alive.

In hatred I press the trigger
and mark the trace.
which you have left in fear
of getting to be my next victim.

My x-rays eyes will finally spot you
then it's time for you to
bow for me and bow on your knees
as I end your tiny resistance

Battletank No.1
will not let you survive.
It will always conquer new land
it will never leave you alive.

Battletank No.1
Battletank No.1
Battletank No.1
Battletank No.1

[Repeat 1st and 2nd]

Battletank No.1
