[Lyrics: John McEntee]

Hordes of nomadic tribes
Heathen pantheons crushed
Infestation of monotheism

Transcend into absolute dissolution

Halts progression
once superior
now symbolizing
the deplorable

For ineffectual mortals
decrepit intellect
Lost in destitute
spirituality

Four crumbling walls symbolizing
nihility
gateways to dissilusion
realm of ignorance
we shall defy
Die!!!
