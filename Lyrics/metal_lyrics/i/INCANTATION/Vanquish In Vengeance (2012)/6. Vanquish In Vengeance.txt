[Lyrics: Chuck Sherwood]

Aller, weser rivers flow
Christians flock, judgement

Thousands perished
on the block

Axes fall on necks
call forth vengeance at verdun
scorn heaven

Heathen arbitration!
Christian castration!
Vengeful retribution!
Holy dissolution!

Eulogy in stone, that now stands alone
let no filth, infect your lands

Cower, die, in defeat
