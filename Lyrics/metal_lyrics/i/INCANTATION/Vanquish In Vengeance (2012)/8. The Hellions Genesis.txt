[Lyrics: Chuck Sherwood]

Spawned from the vortex of death
Your microcosm that flows
In frozen veins, mirrors

Yet immortal, with pride and faith
Night skies and blackened domains
We advance as a legion unbound
all fear and remorse are drowned

Every warrior joins thier echelon

By chant
By conjuration
By dagger

Create the scales of this celestial hydra

Whispered dream speech that
consumes

By chant
By conjuration
By dagger

We're at one with the beast
and we must feed
