[Lyrics: Chuck Sherwood]

Devoted I hold the dagger
carve the will
darkened forces, revel (in) rapture
portals flung wide

Behind this altar,
forgotten pantheons

Ride winds of ethereal incantations
flame and moonlit rite ravages
Harkened soundscapes open
Passages

Now a tyrant unleashing unholy
obliteration

Vortex churning blackness
approach into being

Thier breath is repulsion
earthing abominations
