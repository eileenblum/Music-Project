[Lyrics: Alex Bouks]

Unseen eyes watch
closer I become one
I follow them down
riding the winds of the forgotten

The phantom in your heart
I am the hidden wisdom
The unconscious universe
Frozen in darkness

Lead me to this place where the dead
cry and sing
In the image of the beast I roam

Devoured by the earth and all it's
vengeance
Inside this mortal frame
I ascend in the eternal

Appease the wraith of the dead
I walk among the lifeless

So few stands in the hour glass
slipping so fast away

I ascend in the eternal
