[Lyrics: John McEntee]

Indulged insanity
Inexorable
Spawned from sorrow
Infliction of naivete

From hollow sands
advocation on lies, reign eternally
From hollow sands

Indulged insanity, inexorable
Spawned from sorrow
Infliction of naivete

Dogma is reinforced
consuming indoctrination, to weaken
control thier minds

From hollow sands
advocation of lies, reings eternally
from hollow sands

We are your disease
engulfed in iniquity
your indoctrinated soul
let the degradation consume you

we defy your broken prophet
and decrepit god!!!!
