[Lyrics: Chuck Sherwood]

Ludi Saecularis
receive our sacrifices

Altar of Blood
neptune's blood

Son of Saturn
Centennial pattern

Bowels of earth churn
Dis pater's return

Sulfuric Legion
ash coats the sun

In Darkness cremate
Pyroclastic fate

By breath of Neptune
The boiling ocean consume

Man and beast
Fuel the pyre
broken by fire
