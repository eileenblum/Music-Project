[Lyrics: Chuck Sherwood]

Sanguine, the father
on riches and power, masked dissent

Murdered
A retort of treason, endorsed
dominion

Whores - exile and butcher

Conspiracy
Thier god's words shall never
transcend

Usurper
Enforcer reap children for slaughter

Bastereds
Execute and torture

A feeble attempt to perpetuate
Thier god's kingdom
All ways overthrown by imperial
Freedom

Progeny of tyranny

At the end worm ridden putrefaction
laced his face

With no intervention of salvation
by his god's holy grace
