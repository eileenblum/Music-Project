[Lyrics: Chuck Sherwood]

Nails impacted, the chains are retracted
A moment of agony in lue of power
every nerve will twitch in pain
till your unable to feel you're insane

Liquid glames gnash thier searing teeth
shearing the tissue from your form
joints rupture and ligaments breach
the fleshy confines of humanity
weak!!!

Hair incinerated, eyes liquidated
teeth crushed by powder
under this strain, when all life cower

The mind succumbes to oblivion!

A charred and hollow silhouette
as the entrails fall loosely from your body
shrouded ones approach this
cadaverous art
sitting through your remains to
foresee after you depart
