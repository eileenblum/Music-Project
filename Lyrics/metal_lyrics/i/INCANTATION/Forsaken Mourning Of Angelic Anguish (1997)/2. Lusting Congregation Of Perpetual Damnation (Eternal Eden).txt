Frail worshiper
Dominating phobias
Threacherous beleifs...

Perish...in flames...

Destiny of damnation
I will perish
Eternally...
perish into perpetual damnation

Burn...Burn...

Nazareth died
Our souls redeem
From Christ

Perish...in flames...

Destiny of damnation
I will perish
Eternally...

Indulge in the body of the Goat
Pleasures in my abysmal blasphemy
Paradise of immortal flesh
We endure eternally...
