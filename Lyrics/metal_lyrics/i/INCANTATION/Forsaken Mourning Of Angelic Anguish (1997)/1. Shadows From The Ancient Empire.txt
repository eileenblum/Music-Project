I hear the chants from ancient minds
Like the darkness caresses my essence
The intensity of crimson twilight
A twilight that will guide us to an empire...

of forever Pure tranquillity, of darkness
For true tranquillity can be found in our somber souls

Where perversions will previal
A place of unremitting shadows
Where we savor the sadness of divinity...DIVINITY

The hour has arrived When perversion will prevail
The blood red skies will infest the heavens
The chorus will guide us to paradise.
We will eternally live in so-called forsaken damnation
Indulging in the sweet hunger of temptation.

Like the darkness that caresses my essence.
