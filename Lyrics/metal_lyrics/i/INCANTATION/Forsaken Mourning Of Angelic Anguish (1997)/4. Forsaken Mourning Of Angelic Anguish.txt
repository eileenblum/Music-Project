For I am he
Thy mortal man
A messiah that will never come
Born a king dethroned

Angelic disgraced
Prophecies, Misery

A dawn will rise nevermore

Mournful entity
Spiritual anguish

For I am he
Feeble as kings before me
For I am foolish to worship thou
A weak throne of mortality...

Suffering Seraph
Wretched Magus
