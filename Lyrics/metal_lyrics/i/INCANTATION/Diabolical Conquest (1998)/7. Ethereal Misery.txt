Profane invaders, demonacy arises
Feasting on angelic sweetness, cries of holy mourning
Diseased souls crushed
Profanity brought upon a once holy kingdom...

...ethereal desolation

Underworld of devoured souls
Catastrophic plagues

Thou blessed trinity of once pure flesh
Desecrated by satanic cleansing

Profane Invaders, demonacy arises
Feasting on angelic sweetness, cries of holy mourning

Our genuine purity lies in our instinctive twilight
Witch is never to be forgotten.
