Diabolical redemption, a fallen word
Stand so-called eternally
His Righteousness, decayed...

Demonic existence will conquer
Thy mortal falsehoods, obliterate

Impending triumphs, thy trinity will perish...die!
Impurity, domination, ever-enduring darkness I long for...
Impurity, domination, ever-enduring darkness I long for...

The vitality of his worshippers shall be forever ignored
His Righteousness decayed...

Demonic existence will conquer,
The impending diabolical conquest

Beliefs of a rotten church, decree by flames
Salvation, somber ecstasy
