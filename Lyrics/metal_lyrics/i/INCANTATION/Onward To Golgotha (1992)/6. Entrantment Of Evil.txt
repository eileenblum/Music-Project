Evil one enters the helpless soul, merciless, the giver takes his
toll.
Reveals the evil, condemns the victim.
Corruption of the holy, destruction of gods.
He is the giver of the living torment.
Deny the blackest wrath, devour sweet suffering...

Endure the precious soul, break through sacred flesh.
Exorcist, the demons wrath, entrantment of the evil one...

They call on the beginning of burning.
Enter the maze, the realms of darkness.
