We will be pure in the abyss.
Salvation.
Reigns...

Praying for a dying religion.
The lord will bless us...
Misfortune of God.
The throne is lost.
Christ's fate.
Was a lie...

Beyond the holy grounds.
His souls are torn apart.
Reality has descended upon.
Abominations is the love of God...
