Disciples of mockery, blasphemy.

Christ will rot, suffer in pain.
Nailed unmercifuly, grotesquely hung.
Gasping for air, collapsed lungs.
Stripped of vitality, suffocate...

Denied from salvation.
Destroy, the remains of Christ.
For his flesh won't rise.
Burned to ash, Christ's abolishment...
