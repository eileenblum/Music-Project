[Music by John McEntee and Kyle Severn, Lyrics by Joe Lombard]

Reprimand this holy alliance
Delivering us from prophetic fate
Hailed Babylon
Hailed Babylon

Deprived the will of mortals
With unabashed revelation claims

Conjure the servants
Hailed Babylon
Risen to siege promised land
Conjure the servants
Hailed Babylon

Unrelenting eternal torment
Bestowed upon angelic reign

Angelic reign

Defeated godhead
Omnipotent no more
Departed from his virtuous throne
Conjure the servants
Hailed Babylon
