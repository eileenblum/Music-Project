[Music by John McEntee and Kyle Severn, Lyrics by John McEntee]

Gates of hades
Realm of the dead
Multitudes will be shamed to everlasting contempt

The messiah is my servant
A serpent for my greed

[repeat 1st and 2nd verses]

Manipulation for an agenda
Mass enslavement over mankind

With diabolical fear
And schoel as our weapon
I ascend the throne
Oblivious, I submit

My essence is wasted...

[repeat 2nd and 1st verses]
