[Music by John McEntee and Kyle Severn, Lyrics by Kyle Severn]

Question your god
You've lost your faith
Once man of the cloth
Now consumed by disgust

Your will was weak
Now is strong
My turn to destroy
Arise, the fallen priest

I lust for sin
3AM, I mock the church
Invert your savior
Awaiting the heaven's descent

Unleashed from hell
To spill your blood
No mercy
No remorse
My turn to destroy

For my grief, you will pay

For my pain, you will suffer
Now I see what you did for me.

[repeat 2nd verse]

Faith no more abides in me
Released from its deception
I harbor no guilt
Reborn through my transgressions
