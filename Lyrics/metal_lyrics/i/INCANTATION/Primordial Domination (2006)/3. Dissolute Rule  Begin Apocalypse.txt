[Music by John McEntee and Kyle Severn, Lyrics by Joe Lombard]

Exultant
The dawn of dissolute rule
Receive strength through iniquity

Profound judgement
Spewed forth upon the pure
The upright have faltered
This image altered

[repeat 1st verse]

Awakened age
The gods proofed weak
Begin apocalypse
Revel in vengeance

These temples
Pillars of lies
Begin apocalypse
Revel in vengeance
