[Music by John McEntee and Kyle Severn, Lyrics by Joe Lombard]

Relinquish no reverence
No allegiance, no honor
Defile this covenant
Freed from restraint

Devote faithful
Revere idols of mercy
(Omit their god, bring absence of praise)

Revoke redemption
No clemency from sin

Doctrines of reproach... [x4]

Revoke redemption
Fear of knowing no heaven to behold

Doctrines of reproach... [x2]
