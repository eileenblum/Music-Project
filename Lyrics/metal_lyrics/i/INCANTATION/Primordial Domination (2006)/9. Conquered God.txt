[Music by John McEntee and Kyle Severn, Lyrics by Joe Lomard]

Deceived no more
Departed from a dying faith
Abomination to their god

Deceived no more
No Christ to return
Certain death undenied

Deceived no more
Chatised only to arise and prevail
To conquer god

[repeat 2nd verse]

Only to arise and prevail... [x2]
To conquer god

[repeat 2nd verse]

Lineup:
John McEntee - Vocals, Guitar
