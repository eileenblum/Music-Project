[Music by John McEntee and Kyle Severn, Lyrics by John McEntee]

Held high
Crucified like thieves
Suffering in agony
Burning flesh
Putrid stench
Charred in the wind

In hatred we indulge
Your cruelty we rejoice
Let it be known

A morbid martyr for all to remember

[repeat 2nd verse]

The stench of crucifixion... [x4]

In hatred we indulge
Your cruelty we rejoice
Weeping for your god... your fucking god!!
