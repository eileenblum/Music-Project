How repulsive is man
When they bring no profit to humanity

Advance your allotted span
Never to illuminate your quran
Closed is your understanding
Talmudic rhetoric fading
The Bible and it's addicts
No life to contradict

We seek discipline through power
All feces of faith must cower

Slaves of belief in their frailty
Now grovel before us in fealty... die !
