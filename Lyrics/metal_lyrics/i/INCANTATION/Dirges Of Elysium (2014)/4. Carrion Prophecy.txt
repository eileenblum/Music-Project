Black veins it's shadows cast
From a radiant sacred flame
Delved are it's bloodquenched roots

Wielder of the crooked staff advances
Vestals contort in stances

Festering flesh of the "divine" host
The means to tread the astral path
How the "godly" succumb to their wrath

Virtuous three bequest the corpse sight
Knowledge passed through this rite

In fetters the defeated enslaved
Their infinite victory

Devotees self immolate then to profane

Patrimpas.......... nurturer
Perkunas............. cleaver
Patulas............. enslaver
