Inside this shroud I remain
Behind this light my emptiness
Erase your rotten shell
Instill my oceans of death
Dawn of the everlasting
Sacrament and sacrifice

Reaper in the moonlight of waste
Yield to the sword of truth

Enter the eternal reign
Spill there blood
Feed the flesh to the soil
Impalement of divinity

The inevitable ending
Creation through darkness
