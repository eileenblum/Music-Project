It rapes the heavens from it's summit
Looming from aloft, to destroy innocence
Symbols archaic and ancient
Stones gleam on it's gates

How the flesh held taunt walls it's chambers
Foundation never splinters made of bone
Crafted throne of pestilence
By hands of spectral malevolence

Endless reign from the darkness bestowed
Binding sigils hold the fortress to soul

Festering carrion in heaps will remain
Mankinds future forged from his domain
