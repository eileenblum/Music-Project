[Prologue (Millennium in Elysium)]

Each endures ones shadow
The shades of misdirection
To wide plains we are led
Till the centuries complete their millennium orb
Extracting the ingrained
Leaving those of virtue to ethereal consciousness
And the fire of clean air under mauve skies
A millennium in Elysium and eternity is nigh

[Lethe (Forgetfulness)]

Born from fury you mock it's purity
You are stained with innocence

The blood will not cleanse
Rooted in lethe it stems

Mercury's gift isn't for the unworthy
Silt is in the veins of god's larvae

Forgotten - scrolls and scriptures was your deceit
Blotted - severed from the mind never to rejoin
Discarded - like the spawn from your loins

The nether that flows to Amphora
Grave offerings for the third epoch

Unknown to man, lust unfulfilled
An urn for life that spilled

[Acheron (Sorrow)]

In utter woe you lacerate your freedom
Every gouge brings you closer to Hades

Guilty - purge your undoing in life
A trial in wretched agony

Greeting your flesh with fevered delight
Envious - sculpt away the fallacy

Loss exhausts your vitality
Within this torrent devoid of mortality

Amongst brethren in harmonious mire
A deluge of sorrow merged with desire

Envious - sculpt away the fallacy
Loss exhausts your vitality
Within this torrent devoid of mortality

[Styx (Hate)]

Divinity trampled under foot
Revealing the path which we course

Never to swell or recede
Flowing is the purity of hate
Tributaries only deceive
Diligence to rage opens his gates

In life you weren't worth conception
Vomitted from the womb
In death the Earth in repulsion
Vomits your corpse to consume

[Phelegethon (Fire)]

Rewarded for devotion and service
Submerged never to surface

Gasp in flames
Inhale the Inferno
No lamentation heard of sorrow

Now you are luminous as we
Says your gods as you plea

Ash lined shores clouding waves above
Radiant limbs flail
As Gods exhibits his love

[Tocylus (Lamentation)]

This tide heaves and sighs
A fountain from sorrow brings cries

Sniveling servants
Slaves of attrition

Mourners wade this descent
Wails of hope are fervent
Silent is the dirge of torment

Your god's promises echo in vain
Your lamentation carries in this domain
