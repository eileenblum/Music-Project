[Lyrics by Robert Yench, Music by John McEntee]

In tribute to your revenge, we proclaim ourselves to thee
Open wide the hellish portal victory, arise our darkest revenge

Storm laden skies vomit black rain, awaken the return

Satanic Minions, unlock the past
Bring forth chaos with bitter revenge
Desecration of laws at our command
Receive thy masters and mourn eternally

Forgotten glory
Visions of infernal inspiration, we are servants to the Abyss
Horde of conquerors, we dethrone the savior
We shall reign in Lustful Demise

Conjuring summoned ones with unholy recitals, ancient Spells
In Lustful Demise
