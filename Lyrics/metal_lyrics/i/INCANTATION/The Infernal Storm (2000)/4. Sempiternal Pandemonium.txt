[Lyrics by Robert Yench, Music by John McEntee and Robert Yench]

Seraphim immersed in scorn
Perceptions decrepit, eclipses blind faith
Sagacity with misery itself entwines
And the roots of blasphemous deception stem from their minds

Indulging in temptation and sin, they were cast down
Into regions of sorrow, the deep tract of Hell

Transformed into devils, for they would not revere
Beguiled, curse their miserable fall

The liberty of Perdition
Spiritual descantification
Inverted redemption
Sempiternal Pandemonium

Thrown into the utter deep darkness of Chaos
Their baleful eyes cast contempt upon Heaven

Eternal light now immortal dark
Rise again hierarchy of imfamy, your black wings ascend the skies
