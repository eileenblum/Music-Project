[Lyrics by Robert Yench, Music by Mike Saez and John McEntee]

You are the last to be seen, outblazing the sun
Spirit of the dark
Son of the mourning star, eclipse the flight of Jehovah

Soar onto Heaven
Sinful revelator, arcane arts, everlasting evil
Exalt your throne above the stars of God

Host of Evil, Harbringer of Death, bequite and seduce man
Apocalyptic Destroyer of Angels

Ascend above the clouds, wings outspread triumphant

Become the most high
Sit in judgement at the mount of the congregation
Emperor of the grand grimoire
