[Lyrics by Robert Yench, Music by John McEntee and Robert Yench]

We break the chains of God's will
Vengeance for those who challenged the law
Arise, awake or forever be fallen
Create unholy war, black council of Armageddon
Impious ressurectors of eternal blasphemy
We worship you in dark idolatry

We call out their secret names
Come forth the spawn of sin, we await your command
Unleash your wrath upon the world

We break the chains of God's will
Vengeance for those who challenged the law
Arise, awake or forever be fallen
Create unholy war
Black council of Armageddon
Impious ressurectors of eternal blasphemy
We worship you in dark idolatry

Anoint the chosen, and swear our souls to Damnation
