[Lyrics by Robert Yench, Music by Mike Saez]

Persecuted they gather, remnants of a coven
Converge into enchantment
Mystic storm of phantom devilry
They summon the Impious
Inciter of truth
He shall bear right against their foes
He takes charge of their souls
Into the rings of Hell
Supreme lord of unholy blasphemy
Their brothers tortured and burned
&gt;From the ashes they now return
Visages of sinister possession
Bestowed with ardent powers upon them
They seek atonement for treacherous ways
And weave their spells of dark sorcery
Filled with impetuous rage
