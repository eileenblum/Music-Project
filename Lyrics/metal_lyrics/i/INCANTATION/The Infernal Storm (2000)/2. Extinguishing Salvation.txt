[Lyrics by Robert Yench, Music by John McEntee]

Spurn all past allegiance
Curse and reject the law with abhorrence
Before the mighty and ineffable
Master of the darkness

Usher in the storms that vex
Your sulfurous hail of disobedience
Transgresses the will of our grand foe
Bent on bloodshed, revenge and destruction

Spurn all past allegiance
Curse and reject the law with abhorrence
Before the mighty and ineffable
Master of the darkness

Bring forth his lecherous upheaval
Abdicating God's abode
Deny the meek of their paradise
Extinguishing salvation

In our sovereign's wake lies destruction
Loathsome savior mourns again
Our reign shall be glorious
