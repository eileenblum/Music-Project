[Lyrics by Robert Yench, Music by John McEntee]

Paraide the lie of rotten design
Fervor from this prison of holiness
I need freedom from this death
Bathed in the solitude of righteousness
The cold grip of misery burns my soul
Corrupted in the impurity of sin

Succumbing to the excommunication
I am forever lost in the waves of rebellion

I descend into this world
The kingdom of Indulgence
A palace of provocation, anathema

Banishment becomes escape
Heaven departed
Consumed into flames
Heaven departed
To reign with the dolorous King

Lands scorched with the burning knowledge maleficent

Banishment becomes escape
Heaven departed
Consumed into flames
Heaven departed

Lands scorched with the burning knowledge maleficent
