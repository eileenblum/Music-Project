[Lyrics by John McEntee, Music by John McEntee and Kyle Severn]

Nocturnal kingdom of demonic enlightenment

Dwelling of pestilence
Endless twilight
Behold Thy feeble savior
My kingdom will reign

Gazing upon the nocturnal divine
With lust of eternal paradise
Indulge in the flesh
My horns stand high
