[Lyrics by: John McEntee, Music by: John McEntee &amp; Kyle Severn]

Anguish brought upon the savior
Darkness
Pathetic kingdom
Deepens

Twisted Blasphemy

Nocturnal righteousness
Feasting (on the) lamb of god
Rejoice in malevolence
Hypocrisy

I deny thee

Rotting, withering
In your salvation

Rotting, withering
In your salvation

A myth of lies
Decayed Trinity
In infamy we await
The infernal wrath

Twisted Blasphemy

Rotting, withering
In your salvation
