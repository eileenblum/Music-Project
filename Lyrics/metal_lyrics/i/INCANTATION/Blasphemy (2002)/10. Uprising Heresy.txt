[Lyrics by: Joe Lombard Music by: John McEntee &amp; Kyle Severn]

Under conquered skies
Once thought holy, now have died
Uprising heresy
Impious reign of destiny

Reign down unwanted crown
Possess
Unholy ground
Guide into climactic times
Incarnate
Ways prevail
Uprising heresy

Under conquered skies
Once thought holy, now have died
Uprising heresy
Impious reign of destiny

Days and age of wrath
Empowering
Forsaken will
This legend of the past
