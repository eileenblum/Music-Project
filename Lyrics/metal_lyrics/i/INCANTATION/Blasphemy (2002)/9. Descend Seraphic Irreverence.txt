[Lyrics: John McEntee Music by: John McEntee &amp; Kyle Severn]

Altar of iniquity
Denouncing he
In hatred we conquer

Unholy heaven
As we arise, to conquer
Triumph is evident
Perpetual anguish

Malevolent Plague
Desecrate his body
Persecute his soul
In Desolation

My tormented soul free from serenity
