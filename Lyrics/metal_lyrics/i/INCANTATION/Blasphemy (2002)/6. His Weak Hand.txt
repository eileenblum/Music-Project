[Lyrics by: John McEntee Music by John McEntee &amp; Kyle Severn]

Crippling dogma
Tormented devotion
Light of deceit
His withering hand
Destroying the sacrament
His feeble hand
Has forsaken me
Spawn of bethlehem
Doomed to die
Lord misleading
Of the ashamed
The strength we endure
The christ we deny
The reality we live
Freed
In darkness eternal
Your pathetic religion
Your feeble so-called king
Hung on the cross
The sign of weakness
Darkness has come
And we will prevail
And conquer
The weak hand of god
