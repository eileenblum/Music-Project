[Lyrics &amp; Music by John McEntee &amp; Kyle Severn]

Upon the sign of the night
Longing for a prophecy
Indulgence will prevail
The essence of humanity

Obliterate the trinity
Descending beliefs

Lord of lies, we defy
His purity, proven only lies
Decayed beliefs, twisted truths
Denounce your faith, we testify

Obliterate the trinity
Descending beliefs
His vanquished image
The sign of suffering

BLASPHEMY

Obliterate the trinity
Descending beliefs

Weakness in all his essence
We will triumph 
In Blasphemy

BLASPHEMY

Now pure and excruciating
Enduring in perpetual anguish
We will prevail in Blasphemy

BLASPHEMY
