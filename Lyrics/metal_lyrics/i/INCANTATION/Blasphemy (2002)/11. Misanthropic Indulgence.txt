[Lyrics by: John McEntee, Music by: John McEntee, Kyle Severn]

Need not pay
for my transgressions

For my sins
Brings liberation
Purity, I won't receive
Twisted destiny
Disgracing
My essence

I will not follow thee
I'm a saint of blasphemy

Persecuted
Crowned
And naked
This deceiver

Thanks to mephistojuzam for these lyrics.
