[Lyrics by: John McEntee Music by: John McEntee &amp; Kyle Severn]

Rotting with your christ
I can see
The impending suffering
Your words vanishing
Christ for the weak

False
Messiah
of
Mortality

Lord of lies
Rotting their minds
Bastard childs
We deny
Despise
His heavenly lies

I have freed
My mind of god
Condemn
Your kingdom come

Your
Mindless
Followers
We despise

Prophets for the weak
Your followers blinded
Dreams, Eternal paradise
Rotting with your Christ

I see blood
And obliteration
Humanity's sake
This JESUS must DIE
ROTTING WITH YOUR CHRIST
