[Lyrics: Joe Lombard, Music: John McEntee &amp; Kyle Severn]

Safe haven torn
The ultimate lie
The coming of christ
Rapturous demise

Where's your salvation
Deliverance lost

Deliverance lost
Now fallen and weak
Self-pious fools
Crushed in defeat

Awaiting redemption
Claiming a sign
The hypocrites prayer
Lies of despair

Blasphemy

Cause of opression
Manipulate minds
False sense of power
Self-righteous demise

Blind faith, leaves you scorned
There's no redemption
Safe haven torn
