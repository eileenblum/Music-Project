Commands of the mind must be
Unnumbered spirits will see

Each holds sway over thee
The vessel only yearns to see

But we plant the very seed
Which guides to deceive

No banishment can cure
The muse's nature so pure

Behind his eyes they know
Your attempts to deny show

Ecstasy in every life you take
Driven by our ethereal hate

Again ... Consume the ignorant
Regret ... Speeds your descent

Rebirth through your shell
No longer a denizen of hell
