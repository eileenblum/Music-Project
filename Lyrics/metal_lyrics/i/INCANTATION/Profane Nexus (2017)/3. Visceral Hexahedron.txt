I reside within, under fathomless silence
Event horizon of gathered darkness
Their daggers, slice through thought, subconscious
This chamber, I'm confined, cerebral
Secretion cloaked interior, where life is inferior

Luminous races palms, scorn the sky
Homage to those who never die
Subconscious ripped wide under spell

Unborn larvae, now in hand, rose and fell
Consumed through, emotionless maws
Cilium flow, coursing......... enthralled
Clenching their, serpentine dance
Heaved from me, in trance

Born-less reincarnation
Deathless transmigration

Now you are beckoned through this veil
Shared suffering through the lidless eye I hail
