Life illuminates Avernus
Feast for the lions of Venus
Shallows hold dead offerings
Crimson descends on harpy wings

Bespattered blood, on black stone

Savaged the sentry has fallen
Sated beast had left him rotten
Stones shower as it was foretold
Visions from the basin of gold

Branched tongue, Juno is ablaze
Raptures fire, in Jupiterâs gaze

Satyr hooves pound with delight
Foul seed drowns in fright
These omens, lead to its return
Now your god, will forever...burn
