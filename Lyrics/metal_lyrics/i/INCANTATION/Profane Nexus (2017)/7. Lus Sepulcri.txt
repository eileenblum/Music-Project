Soil that surrounds
Fester underground
Tombs so profound
Shrouds fall unbound

Reduced to dust
Epitaphs carved
Overgrowth barbed

To live with filth by choice we don't
To die with filth by right we won't

My work is to dispose
But never bury those
Faithful decompose
I will appose

Bloodline died
Generations piled
Side by side

To live with filth by choice we don't
To die with filth by right we won't

Take your divinity (elsewhere)
Silent (in your) empty stare
Wasteful life the holy lied
For I interred when you died

I won't cremate
Vermin permeate
Apostate

To live with filth by choice we don't
To die with filth by right we won't
