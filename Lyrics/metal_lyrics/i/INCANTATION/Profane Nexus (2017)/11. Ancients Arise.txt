Descending peaks of Kur
Abode of breathless, ancient lord
Realm beneath, unexplored
Fall....

Engulfing void, her madness is might
Blood creator saves, us from finite
Guide our path....

Lead with tablets of destiny
Forge ahead, in wondrous cruelty
Miscreation erodes
Now vomit the inferno....

Scales glimmer, wings bellow
Delirium, fury, overthrow

Mid absu, and earth
Tiamatâs glory, prophesized
Sanctified....

Old ones, awake arise
Kingu's behest, agonized

War cry, thunderous
Prophet, flock, purified
