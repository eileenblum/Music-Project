Before the universe and physical law
Time did not exist nor the human flaw
Poisonous beasts and your vanity
Only virtue of interest is dependency

My scorn forces submission to fate
Domestic or savage feel my hate
Crowned bovine
Shackled swine
Equal in ash, mortal trash

I am your Messiah, I am the worldâs cure
Hunting the earthly cattle, unholy savior

Dreamt into existence by theologian strife
Collapse to dust for the foul usury of life

Bestiaries of humanity
Guardian of rage binds you to shame

I was your Messiah, at last I cured this world
Hunted the earthly cattle, destiny unfurled
