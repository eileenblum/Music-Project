Sacrilege has devoured
All holy entities
Breaking bones of faiths
And ideologies

Mindless blind devotion
Fails to purify
Life everlasting
These souls of Christ denied

Desecrate Christendom
Decimate Christendom

Undaunted wrath consumes
Every likeness of God
Abolished realms of these
Scared idols now debris
