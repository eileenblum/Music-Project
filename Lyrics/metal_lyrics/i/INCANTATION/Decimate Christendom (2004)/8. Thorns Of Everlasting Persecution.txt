Persecute the fools
Of Christian conformity
Disclaim visions
No paradise awaiting thee

His blessed folds extremity

Bring his kingdom
Obliteration
Crumbled sanctuaries
Now wastelands of faith

Multitudes of faithful
Give vacuous praise
Useless prayers
Fall on deaf ears

Deface the image of God
His blessed folds extremity
