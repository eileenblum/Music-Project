Repercussion of all faiths
Brought failure to mankind

For centuries past
Enslaving
The will of mankind

This deviance
A gathering of lies
Blaspheme the
Sacraments of Christ

Look to their Christ
For liberation
To spare them from
A great tribulation

Ignorance no
More conceals
Falsehood
Unanswered
Empty prayers reveal
Falsehood

The wreckage and remnants
Of Christianity
Will be all that is left
Of what plagued humanity
