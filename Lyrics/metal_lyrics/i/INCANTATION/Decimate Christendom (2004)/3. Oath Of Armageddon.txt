Rising from the dead
Now immortal
Carrying out
My satanic decree
Left unfinished

True coldness
Unbridled cruelty
Petulant aggression

Your ethereal infamy
To ensure retribution

Holy extermination
A foretold vengeance
Everlasting inequity
Of your bastard's fate

Your ethereal infamy
To ensure retribution

We await your return
When his disciples
Will burn once again
