You were nailed to a cross
Punished left for dead

Die among thieves
End of an ungraceful life
You said you'd return
To save our sinful minds

I see nothing of power
Only words of lies

I rip from you, your crown
Slaughter your weak servant fools
I denounce you king
For there is no God

Fuck the heavens
Tales of ecstasy
No paradise awaits

Whom I receive my soul I enslave

Can you believe?
Words of a prophet
No paradise awaits
