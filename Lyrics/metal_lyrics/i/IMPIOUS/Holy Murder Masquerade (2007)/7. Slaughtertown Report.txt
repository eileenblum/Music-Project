(..in this peaceful town. It appears like last night's killings could be
the work of a serial killer on the loose. And yet another horrible
murder occurred earlier today. Officials say that the police are still
investigating most of the crime scenes, but have no main suspects at
this point. Yesterday the resident of Portertown went to sleep like any
other night, but woke up today in what appears to be "Slaughtertown".
People in this town are scared and mostly chocked by all...)

(Freaks...They know nothing. And even if they did, they wouldn't understand)
