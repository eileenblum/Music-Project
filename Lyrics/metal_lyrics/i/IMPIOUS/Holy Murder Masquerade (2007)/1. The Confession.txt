Forgive me father for I will sin
May god forgive me
For what I have done
Once and for all 'm close to end it all
For years and years of pain
Deep despair and full of hate,
I saw no light.
Forgive me father
For I will sin.
I kill as Jesus
To save us all
Send me an angel
To guide me through hell,
And to give me the strength I need
For I must prevail!
So send me an angel,
My shelter from heaven.
My line of sinners I must end.
May god forgive me
For what is to come.
I confess to you,
My darkest secret path
For years and years of pain
Deep despair and full of hate,
I saw no light.
Forgive me father
For I will sin.
I kill as Jesus
To save us all
Send me an angel
To guide me through hell,
And to give me the strength I need
For I must prevail!
So send me an angel,
My shelter from heaven.
My line of
Sinners I must end.
May god forgive me
Father,
I confess to you.
So hear me father,
There's nothing else to do!
Forgive me father
For I will sin.
I kill as Jesus
To save us all
Send me an angel
To guide me through hell,
And to give me the strength I need
For I must prevail!
So send me an angel,
My shelter from heaven.
My line of sinners I must end.
