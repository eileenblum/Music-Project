To clean the house of those who desecrate.
Full of rage -- Empty of compassion
Killing -- Reaping
Hearing the call of voices
Screaming to kill them fucking all.
A feeling of disgust
Pounding hard while starring at the wall.
Everlasting Punishment.
Facing god and asking for his blessing
To slay as Jesus -- A masquerade of death
Killing -- Reaping
Hearing the call of voices
Screaming to kill them fucking all.
A feeling of disgust
Pounding hard while starring at the wall.
Everlasting Punishment.
Liberator -- The only chosen one
Behind the mask to cover all disgrace.
Killing -- Reaping
Hearing the call of voices
Screaming to kill them fucking all.
A feeling of disgust
Pounding hard while starring at the wall.
Everlasting Punishment.
Everlasting Punishment!
Everlasting Punishment!
Punishment!
