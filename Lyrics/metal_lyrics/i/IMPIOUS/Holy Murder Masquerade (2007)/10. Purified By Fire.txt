Burn you piece of shit,
You worthless spawn of Hell!
A human torch is lit to light me
The sacred Path.
One day of suffering forever rest in peace.
Death's cold hand is here, to set you free.
Strapped! Gasoline! Fire!
Leashed and paralyzed.
The countdown must go on.
Must carry on!
Burning you enter my empire.
Burning you're purified by fire.
In seconds the flames arte high
Burning red infernal.
Frantic screams of pain.
A sacrifice!
Burning you enter my empire.
Burning you're purified by fire.
Burn you piece of shit,
You worthless spawn of Hell!
A human torch is lit to light me
The sacred Path.
One day of suffering forever rest in peace.
Death's cold hand is here, to set you free.
As the flames reap the flesh blazing heat devours.
Endless pain defined. Pain Divine!
Burning you enter my empire.
Burning you're purified by fire.
Burning you enter my empire.
Burning you're purified by fire.
Burning! Burning! Burning! Burning! Burning!
