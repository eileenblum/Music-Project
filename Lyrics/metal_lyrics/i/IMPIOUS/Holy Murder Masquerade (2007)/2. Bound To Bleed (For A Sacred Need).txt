The hunt is on in the early dawn.
A wicked saint in vein.
A peaceful night is soon to end.
Let's fucking kill!
Raging madness!
Now death lies ahead!
Trapped with panic!
No getting away!
Standing alone with fear.
Bound to bleed for a sinner's feast.
Standing alone with fear.
Bound to bleed for a sacred need.
A victim running for his life
Racing against death.
A knife engraving in the neck
Marked as number 8.
Raging madness!
Now death lies ahead!
Trapped with panic!
No getting away!
Standing alone with fear.
Bound to bleed for a sinner's feast.
Standing alone with fear.
Bound to bleed for a sacred need.
With the mandatory mask
Of Christ in place nothing is sin
A sudden stab coming from behind
Piercing flesh -- Ending life.
Standing alone with fear.
Bound to bleed for a sinner's feast.
Standing alone with fear.
Bound to bleed for a sacred need.
