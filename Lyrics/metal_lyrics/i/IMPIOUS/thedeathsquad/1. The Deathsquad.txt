Raving painful endless night
All alone on deadly ground
Fire starts ruling the battlefield
Violent flames of hate
Demolition
Devastation

"Standing proud we won't surrender"
Troops of doom defined
"There's no way we'll raise the white flag"
Loyalty denied

Hatred strikes with battery
Evolution of what will be
Searching and killing and serving well
Soldiers born to fight
Demolition
Desolation

"Standing proud we won't surrender"
Troops of doom defined
"There's no way we'll raise the white flag"
Loyalty denied
Loyalty has died

Oh, listen to the noise
Sweet sound from the bullet race
Back to the front, to face the end
Left alone, to fail again
Left alone, to fight death

Marching on with fear
To no man's land
The end is near
Helpless blind men
Obeying the war
Unaware of their loss
They're marching alone

Abort mission!
Evacuate!
Roaring bombs keep falling down
Left all alone on this deadly ground
Praise the squad of death
Demolition
Desecration

"Standing proud we won't surrender"
Troops of doom defined
"There's no way we'll raise the white flag"
Loyalty denied
Loyalty has died
