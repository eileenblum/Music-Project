[Lyrics: Valle Adzic]
[Music: Valle Adzic]

Crosses rising on top of Golgotha
Lonely, helpless, gathering what's left...
of nothing 

Nothing shall stop this death of Christ
Betrayed, the pain grows deep inside 

Flowing blood caused by the crown
Flowing tears caused by failure
The dreams are past 
and the future is here 
Face the message:
NAIL UP THE FUCKING SAVIOUR ! 

Drown in deep depression, 
as you are left to die ! 

Naive thoughts that God
would be there for you...
Ha... you have carried the cross
and now you're upon it
Let the sacrifice begin! 

Violent screams of torment,
this is the end and it's dark within
Bringer of light, 
where is your holy gift now?
Bleeding, crying, 
forget the thoughts of rising 

Behold the dark flowing blood
Fearing that you have failed...
in the name of God 

Flowing blood caused by the crown
Flowing tears caused by failure
The dreams are past 
and the future is here 
Face the message:
NAIL UP THE FUCKING SAVIOUR ! 

Long hurting nails 
are forced into the flesh
There will not be a rebirth
for your soul 

Suffer...
To be tortured...
Die and you will see!
