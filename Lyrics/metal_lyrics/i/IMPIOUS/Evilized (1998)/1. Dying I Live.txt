[Lyrics: Valle Adzic]
[Music: Valle Adzic]

Open me and see,
how purity becomes suffering
and angels turn to demons
Untouched is my soul
as water turns to blood 

Cut my heart wide open,
tear it apart and see
Please put an end 
to this circle of misery

No one has the right to make me believe,
to praise God and to follow the light
Come my dear, eat the fruit of innocence
You'll be lead to heaven 
and I'll stay in this chamber of hell 

No one has the right to make me believe,
that if I don't believe I will forever sin
Creation of destruction 
and destruction of creation
I am the battlefield!
I am destruction!

There's no room for me in heaven
Lust is taking over 
and I'll never sleep again
The one who taught to bless
taught to curse! 

I'm trapped in this world of disgust
Oh, I hate this cold life!
Not 'cos I'm unused to coldness 

What is love?
What is desire?
What is creation?
Take my life or I'll be living dead
Can't you hear my empty calls?
Abused by the wisdom of the fallen souls
Inside of me there's a battle
between hope and a request for an end
Why don't you hear my empty calls? 

[Solo: Ãkesson]

There's no room for me in heaven
Lust is taking over 
and I'll never sleep again
The one who taught to bless
taught to curse! 

I'm trapped in this world of disgust
Oh, I hate this cold life!
Not 'cos I'm unused to coldness,
but 'cos I am used to hate! 

No one has the right to make me believe,
to praise God and to follow the light
Come my dear, eat the fruit of innocence
You'll be lead to heaven 
and I'll stay in this chamber of hell 

No one has the right to make me believe,
that if I don't believe I will forever sin
Creation of destruction 
and destruction of creation

Bitten by the guards of hell,
the soul-eating dogs
Will I prevail again?
