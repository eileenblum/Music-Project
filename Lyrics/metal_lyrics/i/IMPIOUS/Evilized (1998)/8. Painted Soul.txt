[Lyrics: Valle Adzic]
[Music: Valle Adzic]

Worshipping the weak misbegotten lord
I was doomed to live and die as a coward
Doomed to live by false tales
I couldn't stand the suffocating pain
I shut my eyes and saw the open gate 

Now, you will follow me!
Slaves, help me to seek!
In hell, my soul I keep!
Satan shall turn us to beasts! 

I'll sacrifice...
The hate is growing strong in me
I'll sacrifice
my flesh and blood to the dark forces
beyond mortal life
I shall now arise and damn your souls
We shall arise
and sacrifice their blood 
and their holy souls 

Weak and scared 
they gave my life to the light
I shut my eyes and saw forever
I closed my eyes and realized
that reality takes more than lies
I woke up and hailed my future 

Now, you will follow me!
Slaves, help me to seek!
In hell, my soul I keep!
Satan shall turn us to beasts! I'll sacrifice...
The hate is growing strong in me
I'll sacrifice
my flesh and blood to the dark forces
beyond mortal life
I shall now arise and damn your souls
We shall arise
and sacrifice their blood 
and their holy souls 

With a strong soul 
I give my life to darkness
Chosen to destroy 
the never-ending lies 

[Solo: Adzic]

I'll sacrifice...
The hate is growing strong in me
I'll sacrifice
my flesh and blood to the dark forces
beyond mortal life
I shall now arise and damn your souls
We shall arise
and sacrifice their blood 
and fuck their holy souls 

We shall arise!
