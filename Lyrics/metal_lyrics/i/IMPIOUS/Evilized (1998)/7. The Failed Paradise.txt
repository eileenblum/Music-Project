[Lyrics: Valle Adzic]
[Music: Valle Adzic]

Cold blooded murder this is
The burning will was not our choice
Scared eyes are staring at the sickness
Raped bodies will never be buried 

Our children were slaughtered 
by the holy might
We all live like beasts in the field
When your skull is crushed, 
he smiles with joy...
God will dance on your grave
He'll dance on your grave
and spit on your stone 

[Solo: Adzic]

Preachers of holiness 
believe in the innocence of God
We're hatred and born to bleed
Shall we survive in hell or commit suicide?
Before my eyes all shall die
But the preachers are hiding 
behind the walls of stone
Immortal death lives inside 

Cold blooded murder this is
The burning will was not our choice
Scared eyes are staring at the sickness
Raped bodies will never be buried 
Our children were slaughtered 
by the holy might
We all live like beasts in the field
When your skull is crushed, 
he smiles with joy...
God will dance on your grave 

Indemnity is lost 
in this world of beasts
Lay down and face the doom
in these black hating eyes
...my eyes! 

[Solo: Adzic]

Preachers of holiness 
believe in the innocence of God
We're hatred and born to bleed
Shall we survive in hell or commit suicide?
Before my eyes all shall die
But the preachers are hiding 
behind the walls of stone
Immortal death lives inside
