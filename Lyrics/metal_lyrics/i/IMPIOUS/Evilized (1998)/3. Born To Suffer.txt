[Lyrics: Daniel Ãkesson]
[Music: Martin Ãkesson]

Welcome to my lair
Thou wilt be my guest
Falling down the stairs
Your beauty I detest 

Forever you will stay
the cellar is your hall
It's no use praying
I chain you to the wall 

You are my playing field
Your screaming echoes through
To pleasure you will yield
As I'm entering you...

Born to suffer
Thou art in my domain
Born to suffer 
Experiencing pain
Trapped forever
There's nowhere you can flee
Born to suffer
Your life belongs to me! 

Your part is over now
It was played until the end
Your life ends here
It's your turn, turn to descend 

My own little doll
Oh, I'm playing within
my personal toy
Feeling no sin 

My personal toy
How I love your fear
Torture with joy
You'll never get out of here 

[Solo: Ãkesson]

You are my playing field
Your screaming echoes through
To pleasure you will yield
As I'm entering you...

Born to suffer
Thou art in my domain
Born to suffer 
Experiencing pain
Trapped forever
There's nowhere you can flee
Born to suffer
Your life belongs to me!

My own little doll...
My personal toy...
Torture with joy! 

[Solo: Ãkesson]

Born to suffer
Thou art in my domain
Born to suffer
Your body will remain
Trapped forever
There's nowhere you can flee
My possession
Your corpse belongs to me !
