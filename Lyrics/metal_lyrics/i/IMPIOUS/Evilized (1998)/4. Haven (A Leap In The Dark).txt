[Lyrics: Robin SÃ¶rqvist]
[Music: Robin SÃ¶rqvist]

By the ruins on the hill,
all painful days I kill
Oh those thoughts within my head
My mind welcomes the dead 

Rain - stings my cold face
by any chance I embrace
Failure - makes my value for life decrease 
I fight misfortune with hate
Strength is so hard to regain
This has to be fate
I'll fall like an angel from heaven 

Pain - emerged with my birth, 
if I do anything right I get burned
Storms - in my mind a hunger for death 

I fight misfortune with hate
Strength is so hard to regain
This has to be fate
I'll fall 

I gather all misfortunes
and conclude the path of life
Future is lost and so is my hope
The only way out is to die 

[Solo : Ãkesson]

By the ruins on the hill,
all painful days I kill
Oh those thoughts within my head
My mind welcomes the dead
Oh God, where is my haven?!? 

I step out on the edge, 
watching the abyss below
Preparing with a deep breath,
as into the dark I flow 

I fought misfortune with hate
It was so hard to regain
This was my fate
I am falling! 

By the ruins on the hill, 
all painful days I kill
Oh those thoughts within my head
Death welcomes me dead
Hell is my haven!!! 

[Acoustic solo: SÃ¶rqvist]
