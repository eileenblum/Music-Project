[Solo: Ãkesson]

Lightning strikes! It's time...
All sins are gone everything is so clear
Winds of fire made my path
Take my soul to the unknown half 

Wounded hate I keep in blackness
Misery is what I am and see
I can't breed in life
Give me strength that forever lasts 

My beauty come forth or I'll fall...

I stand alone in the fields of fear
Feeling that death crawls under my skin
The bloodred sky now starts to bleed
It covers my face with hellborn seed 

I stand alone in the dark fields of fear
All sins are gone,
everything is bright and clear 

There's no way to proceed the life of light
Infernal one, bring me the promised night 

Sweet end please enter my heart of rage
Winds of fire now blow my ashes away 

With death I'll feed the beast inside of me
Death is by my side! Death will set me free! 

Behold the grace of frightened dreams
I fill my hole with emptiness
I will survive...
but in another dimension of life
I will survive...
I will not die !!! 

[Solo: Ãkesson]

Serenity invades my mind
I am dead but still newborn
with pleasure chains
Don't kiss my grave!
The light beyond is here now
to stay forever
I am through... not dead!

[Solo: Adzic]

Blackened might, all mighty!
Confusion's dead, engrave hell in my flesh
Liars blinded by crosses, forget heaven
Why change my destiny? 

I stand alone in the fields of fear
Feeling that death crawls under my skin
The bloodred sky now starts to bleed
It covers my face with hellborn seed 

I stand alone in the dark fields of fear
All sins are gone,
everything is bright and clear 

There's no way to proceed the life of light
Infernal one, bring me the promised night 

Sweet end please enter my heart of rage
Winds of fire now blow my ashes away 

With death I'll feed the beast inside of me
With death! 

I watch with joy!
Oh yes I enjoy
watching the blinded ones
trying to climb the six-feet wall
Drowning above the surface
they will forever fall
Forever Fall !
