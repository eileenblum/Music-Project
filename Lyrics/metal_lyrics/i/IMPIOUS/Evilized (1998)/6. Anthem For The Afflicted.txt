[Lyrics: Daniel Ãkesson]
[Music: Martin Ãkesson]

Hear my anthem for the afflicted
Listen to your faith
To your fall I am addicted,
caressing you with hate 

You're the shame of God's creation,
the blackness of his work
Lowest form of creatures
Below the blind you lurk 

So deeply I hate you, 
Godless scum!
Deform my paradise
With salvation I have come
An end to all your Lies...

My sword will drain your lustful souls
Rightful path I lead
A higher sky I will provide, 
I will make you bleed,
drown you in your greed
BEHOLD THIS MOMENT
OF PEACE...

I am your world's Godsent saviour,
this is what you need
You're not worthy of God's creation
I will make you bleed 

Idol deformed by malady
A cancerous disease
Performing sacred surgery,
the cure of sin is this 

I'll castrate the human race,
remove you one by one
Into your feeble eyes I gaze
Die unholy son! Salvation's what I am
You'll never sin again
You bringer of antiseption 

Follow me, I'm your guide
Forceful death I'll provide
Unleash you from obsession 

Your master was decrowned,
by me he was dethroned
I'm next for succession 

Fear me now, fall on your knees
your last prayer was cried for me
Darkening your vision 

[Solo: Ãkesson]

My sword will drain your lustful souls
Rightful path I lead
A higher sky I will provide
I will make you bleed,
drown you in your greed
BEHOLD THIS MOMENT
OF PEACE...

The holiest of all I am
The only fucking priest
I'll kill them, torture, slaughter them
Clean my world from beasts
BEHOLD THIS MOMENT 
OF PEACE...

With vengeance I will emerge
From black skies I'll strike
Erase your race from this world of mine
I'll be alone at last!
BEHOLD MY RAGE AS YOU CEASE...

Am I really as sacred as I lied?
Hell no! Pale evil personified!
