[Lyrics: Valle Adzic]
[Music: Valle Adzic]

Welcome to the game,
the game called life
Blessed with noxious greed
I am the Lord of lords 

Ready to rise, ready to kill
I'll evilize this world of mine
You're feeling so safe
You're feeling supreme
But when I'm done you'll be crucified 

Believers in torment, souls in pain 
I will make you suffer
I'll cut your bodies over and over again
Don't you try to flee!
I will make the blind man see
I will put the dead in pain again 

With hate and desolation
I will evilize, I will deathenize
With a strengthened soul full of disgust
I will eliminate you stupid lambs
Listen when I laugh,
despair runs through your veins 

Blessed with atrocity
It controls, it has no sins
Reinforced by the twisted
You are lost! 

Honour of hell I will release
I'm oh so pleased, this is my feast
Prepare for attack you holy sluts
I will evilize! Lightning crashes in your eyes,
reflecting the fire of hell
I will kill you all,
kill your lies
I will evilize! 

Children of perversion,
your days are numbered
I will raise you well, give you hell
You're the holy dirt beneath my wings
I hate you oh so deeply
You cowards I will reap 

[Solo : Ãkesson]

Believers in torment, souls in pain 
I will make you suffer
I'll cut your bodies over and over again
Don't you try to flee!
I will make the blind man see
I will put the dead in pain again 

With hate and desolation
I will evilize, I will deathenize
With a strengthened soul full of disgust
I will eliminate you stupid lambs
Listen when I laugh,
despair runs through your veins 

You will rot in heaven,
the filth you created
Your mortal journey has just begun
Welcome to the Evilization!
