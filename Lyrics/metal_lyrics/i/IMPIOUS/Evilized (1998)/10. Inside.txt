[Lyrics: Daniel Ãkesson]
[Music: Martin Ãkesson]

Voices calling, my limbs in its grasp
No Regression like a homicidal marionette
Animated like a corrupted carnivore
A puppet meant for murder, 
tempted by a twisted mind. 

Oh lord, exorcise this creature
lurking in the dark windings 
of my grey matter
Release me from this entanglement 
of epidemic tissue,
demanding those dark deeds of death! 

In my skull I'm not alone
I know it's dwelling there
Demon dominating me,
with which my mind I share 

Deep within I'm oh so sure
It's lurking in my head
But I'm bold, I'm fighting back
I shall not be misled 

Blood begins to surge
Turns my fear to lust
Can't deny the urge
in doublemind I trust 

My control I lose
The other me is strong
There's no way to choose
To him I belong 

Regression 
My mind was far too weak
Temptation
A victim now I seek
Unearthborn
Not of flesh nor soul
Possession
My mind's been captured 
now in its control 

[Solo: Ãkesson]

I'm a schizophrenic creature
Tracing scent of prey
I'm the puppet of my master
At the end of the endless hunt
I'm getting what I seek
Gashed by a blade in 
bloodstained night
Adrenaline at its peak

[Solo: Ãkesson]

Can't resist 
Trapped by unearthborn forces
from far beyond 
And those voices keep whispering,
keep hailing my hate
The urge is strong, 
I know what has to be done,
when entering euphoric state of lust 

The funeral choir mass 
about bloodstained nights
And those voices inside 
gaining in strength,
possessing my will, 
I'm not my own anymore.
I've lost control of my flesh
Please set me free 
from those black chains of insanity...

Stabbing on as victims fall
Finally I'm pleased
Listening to my inner calls
We have had our feast 

Lust and hunger double minded
I feed the inner beast
Shame and remorse undivided
My sanity has ceased 

Blood begins to surge
Turns my fear to lust
Can't deny the urge,
in doublemind I trust 

My control I lose
The other me is strong
There's no way to choose
To him I belong 

Regression 
My mind was far too weak
Temptation
A victim now I seek
Unearthborn
Not of flesh nor soul
Possession
My mind's been captured 
now in its control
