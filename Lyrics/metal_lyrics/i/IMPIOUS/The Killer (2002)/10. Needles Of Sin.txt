When man has lost his sense for human value
He sometimes gets satisfaction from abusing mortality

This is the place of all your needs
Take your time to look around
Everything is what it seems
Just a peep n' then you're bound

Whipped and stained
Hanging from chains
Longing for your touch
A mansion filled with meat
Contemplate feel attracted to condition
Lead her in perdition
Yeah!

He feeds his needs
Neither dead nor alive matters

A rousing touch burns deep within
Here are limbs well preserved
This fortress poured with deepest sin
You'll take what you deserve

Whipped and stained
Hanging from chains
Longing for your touch
With blood within her smile
Oversexed begging for a round of sin
In a game called needles and pins

Close your eyes break the ice
Get swallowed here tonight
Unlock the chain taste the flesh
Feel attracted to pierce the skin
Conspiracy of sin

The arousal gains
You've got the grip
Oh bringer of pain
Licking bloody lips

Noxious games performed
In a way of art
Harmony lives deep within the heart

Close your eyes break the ice
Get swallowed here tonight
Unlock the chain taste the flesh
Feel attracted to pierce the skin
Conspiracy of sin
