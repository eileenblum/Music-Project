Alright!
The sinner's feast is on
A sentenced soul to rot
Shut inside
Forever living to die
Burning
Caught in flesh
Screaming
To leave its chamber
Reaching out for mercy
Breeding in emptiness

A battle to survive
Fighting to stay alive
Forever caught in flesh!

Trapped!
Trapped forever more
Stuck in endless void
To rot inside
Waiting for the flesh to die
Crying for liberation
Searching for a destination
Darkest world of silence
Living in emptiness

A battle to survive
Fighting to stay alive
Inhaling the dust of remorse
A soul in torment
Eternal punishment
Trapped in a cage without doors
Forever caught in flesh!

Damn the sinner's feast
Reign of terror
So rule with sin
To feed the inner beast
A dying soul in torment
Slowly, torn apart
Slowly, torn apart
Unholy desecration

Alright!
The sinner's feast is on
A sentenced soul to rot
Shut inside
Forever living to die
Burning
Caught in flesh
Screaming
To leave its chamber
Reaching out for mercy
Breeding in emptiness

A battle to survive
Fighting to stay alive
Inhaling the dust of remorse
A soul in torment
Eternal punishment
Trapped in a cage without doors
Forever caught in flesh!
