2021: We're no longer alone
Our dream of ice has frozen the sun
We gave it a mind, we changed the world
No we suffer in pain
Devils art defined

Soldiers of death
Marching to war
Spilling blood
Reaping forth
Protecting our race
This is the science revelation

2021: We gave it a soul
What have we done?
We'll end up in hell!
There is no way to stop these
Killing machine
Children of technology

Soldiers of death
Marching to war
Spilling blood
Reaping forth
Protecting our race
This is the science revelation

Legions of steel are marching forth
Spilling the blood
Degrading
Slaying our race

Legions of steel are marching forth
They're wasted our nation
And now, now they are back, back for more

Soldiers of death
Marching to war
Spilling blood
Reaping forth
Protecting our race
This is the Devil's revelation
