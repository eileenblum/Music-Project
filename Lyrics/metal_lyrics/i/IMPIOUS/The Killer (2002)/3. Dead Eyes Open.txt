Buried to be forgotten
Evil souls lie under holy ground
With dead eyes open
They stare at you as you walk their ground

They shall rise
They will return
Like a storm they blow you all away
With dead eyes open
Behold the souls to whom you'll pray

No more daylight
They have returned
Demons unite
To rule with evil
The renegade will stay
Revolution of bane
With dead eyes open
Evil will obtain

Horror
You live in fear
When lightning strikes
Nothing will be spared
With dead eyes open
They stare at you as you cease their ground

No more daylight...

Die enslaved
Dying caused by pain
Unleashed again
No one to blame
As misery takes control

Bound in blood
Slaying on with pride
A message from hell
Nothing will remain
As evil takes it all

No more daylight...

No more daylight
They have returned
Demons unite
To rule the earth
