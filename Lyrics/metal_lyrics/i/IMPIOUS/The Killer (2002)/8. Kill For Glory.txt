Kill for glory...
Twisted needs for exaltation
No one knows, but blood may flow
When the game is over it will show
Wrath of pain
Fury striking from behind
Now to show, that blood will flow
But the game ain't over 'cause there are more
Kill for glory and take control!

Shedding blood instead of tears
Praying to God for glory to appear
Fearless
Without regret
The hunt goes on

Kill for glory...
Sweeping breeze of satisfaction
Sacrifice to pay the price
One shot closer to paradise
Bullets race
Sweet rounds of punishment inside
Kill for glory and take control
It takes a body to sell one's soul
Kill for glory and take control!

Shedding blood instead of tears
Praying to God for glory to appear
Fearless
Without regret
The hunt goes on

Human blood is your fuel
Illusion of what could never be
Beast of morbid art
Manic seeker of hallow ground

Kill for glory
You're God's murder device
Stand above humanity to sacrifice
One last tear, to show the fear
One last breath, and now... death!

Shedding blood instead of tears
Praying to God for glory to appear
Fearless
Without regret
The hunt goes on

Shedding blood instead of tears
Praying to God for glory to appear
Soulless
Falling down
Hope forever gone
