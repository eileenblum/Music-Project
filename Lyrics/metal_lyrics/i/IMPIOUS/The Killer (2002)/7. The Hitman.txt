"Killing marks just turn me on
While I hunt it feeds my soul
When spilling blood I'm always cold"
The hitman shows no mercy!
"Say hello to my little friend
He'll put a bullet right through your head"
The mark is set and there's no escape
It's time for termination

"You'll be found before you know
When I aim there is nowhere to go
The mark is set there's no escape
When I pull the trigger you'll be gone
A single blast will bring you down
Murder's my salvation
I'm the killer
I'm the hitman
Erasing one by one"

"Pray your prayer now
As my feast has begun"
Seek to kill, kill for bliss
There will be no tomorrow
Execute
Assassinate
Silver bullets will show the way
"Do not hid, it's far too late
Face your execution"

"You'll be found before you know
When I aim there is nowhere to go
The mark is set there's no escape
When I pull the trigger you'll be gone
A single blast will bring you down
Murder's my salvation
I'm the killer
I'm the hitman
Erasing one by one"

"Pray your prayer now
As my feast has begun"
The mark is set there's no escape
The hitman knows no sorrow!
"Say hello to my little friend
He'll put a bullet right through your fucking head
Pray, so pray again
It's time for termination"

"You'll be found before you know:"
