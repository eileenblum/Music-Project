How can you sit there with a smile on your face,
When knowing you're gonna die?
How does it feel when I cut your pale skin
While days and days pass by?

69 days of pain for you my friend
69 stabs of vengeance is what you pay

I'll make you bleed all night and day
Until you pass away it'll never be the same
Now can you feel it?
Can you feel the pain?
Drilling blade inside your chest
You will never live again

Say, when I turn the knife inside your chest,
Do you regret that you defied?
Pay the price for betrayal
I'll stab you 69 times

69 days of pain for you my friend
69 stabs of vengeance is what you pay

I'll make you bleed all night and day
Until you pass away it'll never be the same
Now can you feel it?
Can you feel the pain?
Drilling blade inside your chest
You will never live again

It's final!
I'll stab you 69 times
When I turn the knife inside your chest
Do you regret what you defied?

Revenge
Makes me feel I'm alive
Make me feel I won't drown
You're going down
As I stab you 69 times!

Bow to your noble master one last time
Cause soon it's time to die
Now before I cut your hear wide open
Do you wanna ask me why?

69 days of pain for you my friend
69 stabs of vengeance is what you pay

I'll make you bleed all night and day
Until you pass away it'll never be the same
Now can you feel it?
Can you feel the pain?
Drilling blade inside your chest
You will never live again
