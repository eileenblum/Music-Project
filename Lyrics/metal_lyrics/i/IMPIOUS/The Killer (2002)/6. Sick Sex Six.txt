Sexual sin
Curse of lust
Satanic lover, taste the blood
We are not what they are
We are known for what we are not

Sick sex six
Crawl in dust
Cast the spell and unleash the lust
We do not what they do
We are known for what we are not

We hunger for tasting their blood
We kill again as we're reaping through the night
We are the masters of this slavery
We kill again
We kill our slaves
Satanic lover
The devil's disguise
Is watching its preys stained with innocent blood
We hunger for tasting their souls
We kill again as we're reaping through the night

Sick sex six
Crawl in dust
Cast the spell and unleash the lust
We do not what they do
We are known for what we are not
