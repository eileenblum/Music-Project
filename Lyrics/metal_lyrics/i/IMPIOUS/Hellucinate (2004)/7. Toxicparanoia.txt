You see the light
You're going strong
But then you lose control and feed that soul
You see no right nor wrong
You're here to kill them all
Homicide
It's like a spell
You are going through heaven and hell
So hear the Devil's call... To slay them all!

Toxic paranoia
Psychotic vengeance reborn
Trippin' with the devil
Euphoric madness for all
There's no room in hell
All sinners will walk the earth
Till heaven falls apart
Toxic paranoia!

That's right, hunt 'em down
But have you ever felt that evil bites
So hear the Devil's call... Slay them all!

Toxic paranoia
Psychotic vengeance reborn
Trippin' with the devil
Euphoric madness for all
There's no room in hell
All sinners will walk the earth
Till heaven falls apart
Toxic paranoia!

Reach out!
Reach out for a hand that's not there
Soul torn out
Torn out of you
Play the game and you'll survive
Your eyes are turning black

Reach out!
Reach out for a hand that's not there
Soul torn out
Torn out of you
These chains are made of sin
Deadly poison
Shattered dreams await

You see the light
You're going strong
But then you lose control and feed that soul
You see no right nor wrong
You're here to kill them all
Homicide
It's like a spell
You are going through heaven and hell
So hear the Devil's call... To slay them all!

Toxic paranoia
Psychotic vengeance reborn
Trippin' with the devil
Euphoric madness for all
There's no room in hell
All sinners will walk the earth
Till heaven falls apart
Toxic paranoia!
