With empty eyes I stare at the wall
Needles nervosa in control
Release the pain in my own way
Nail my body free from ear at last

Chaos raging the inside of my mind
For lust
For glory
For anything
For everything I want

It's the pain...
Like a crushing hammer to my head
Death supreme in my own dreams
Forcing me to please my soul again

Chaos raging the inside of my mind
For lust
For glory
For anything
For everything I want

Needles nervosa
Purified I dwell
Manic depression
Needles nervosa
Damnified

Like a crushing hammer to my head
Death supreme in my own dreams
Forcing me to please my soul again

Chaos raging the inside of my mind
For lust
For glory
For anything
For everything I want

Needles nervosa
Purified I dwell
Manic depression
Needles nervosa
Damnified

Sadistic shell,
A nailed body gone through hell
Modified
Glorified
Psychotic spell
Repulsive frantic pleasure,
Core of sin deranged
Needles of addiction,
Forcing me to live

Needles nervosa
Purified I dwell
Manic depression
Needles nervosa
Damnified
