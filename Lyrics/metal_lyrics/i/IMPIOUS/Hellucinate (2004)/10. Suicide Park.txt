A thousand souls in trance to serve the chosen one
Led by sirens, so lost in the dark
For death and life they'll follow,
For death and life they'll swallow
No one welcome to Suicide Park

Embrace the deadliness
Now do not fear the face of hell tonight
Nothing, no nothing shall remain of this Promised Land
So do not hide, drink the potion
It's suicide for salvation
Father demise, father demise,
Now show the grace of sorrow
Liberation
Genocide

Children of faithfulness devoted to serve their God
Victims of wrath in "paradise,"
A personal sacrifice
Irreligious fortress,
Trapped till dawn
Released by death
Raise the cup
Sweet cyanide
Chemical suicide

Embrace the deadliness
Now do not fear the face of hell tonight
Nothing, no nothing shall remain of this Promised Land
So do not hide, drink the potion
It's suicide for salvation
Father demise, father demise,
Now show the grace of sorrow
Liberation
Genocide

Watching the grey sky drained of light
Will it ever pass?
Without a word of warning
Panic is unleashed

As the night creeps over Suicide Park
Fear is rising, it has begun
Dreaded words in command
Salvation's near
This is the final white night

Embrace the deadliness
Now do not fear the face of hell tonight
Nothing, no nothing shall remain of this Promised Land
So do not hide, drink the potion
It's suicide for salvation
Father demise, father demise,
Now show the grace of sorrow
Liberation
Genocide

So the sirens of death scream again!
Now it's time
Chaos!
Death!
