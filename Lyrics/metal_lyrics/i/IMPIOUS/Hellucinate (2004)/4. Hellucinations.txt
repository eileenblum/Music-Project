At the jaws of death I am my own prey
Rely on a needle fare, a twisted mind insane
No sun to announce tomorrow
Nocturnal of one kind, hallucinated mind
It's a godless fucking ride
Do or die!

No control to save the day, there's no light to follow
I interrelate
Damage done
To kill the rage I embrace the sorrow
I hellucinate

Schizophrenic mental warfare
Abusive suicide
Stand by for another ride, illusion of higher kind
There is no light to follow; no sun can shine in hell
Inject the perfect drug
It's a Godless fucking ride
Do or die!

No control to save the day, there's no light to follow
I interrelate
Damage done
To kill the rage I embrace the sorrow
I hellucinate

Desolation
A curse of grown despair
Inject the mortal poison shreds
A vision of walking dead
Incarnation
Dedication
Euphoric full attack
Devastation
Exaltation
For all is turning black
Horrid dreams replaced
I'm breeding hell, melting my head

No control to save the day, there's no light to follow
I interrelate
Damage done
To kill the rage I embrace the sorrow
I hellucinate
