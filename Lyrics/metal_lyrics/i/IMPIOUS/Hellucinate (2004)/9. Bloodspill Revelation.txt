They crawl
They beg
They kill on command
Like puppets made of human clay
For blood they will obey

Eliminate
No man shall stand before me
To liquidate
No savior to await
Withdraw the faith
For this is our last crusade
Until they're dead
With power I will raid

Bloodspill revelation!
Through death you'll see my name
Dust to dust
And ashes to remain
Bloodspill revelation!
With blood you'll have to pa
Dust to dust
And ashes to remain

They prey, they kill
They will do what I say
For I am total death unleashed
And we are here to stay

Eliminate
No man shall stand before me
To liquidate
No savior to await
Withdraw the faith
For this is our last crusade
To desecrate
We raise the flag of hate

Allied we devastate...
Renegade
Soon you're all to be deceased
A plague unleashed
The world is turning black
As all life fades away

They crawl
They beg
They kill on command
Like puppets made of human clay
For blood they will obey

Eliminate
No man shall stand before me
To liquidate
No savior to await
Withdraw the faith
For this is our last crusade
Until they're dead
Bloodspill is my faith

Bloodspill revelation!
Through death you'll see my name
Dust to dust
And ashes to remain
Bloodspill revelation!
With blood you'll have to pa
Dust to dust
And ashes to remain
Unholy death unleashed
Bloodspill revelation!
