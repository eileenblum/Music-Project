Cast aside
Like shadows with no light
Oppressions won by thrust
Gone to past

An image of stone to never be undone
For there's an evil thorn stuck so far deep inside
Sacrificed
Crucified
Almost disappearing in the light

All the wicked kept in silence
Forever to remain unknown as hatred grows
Rising from the depths of saints
Alone in the darkness, with half a soul they're not forlorn
Serving the sane
They're the castaways

Death unfolds
As two worlds do collide
While burning down...
In fire they will shine

Now riots serve as a driving force
As hatred grows from far beyond their sight
Demon rise the antichrists
Shadows reappearing in the light

All the wicked kept in silence
Forever to remain unknown as hatred grows
Rising from the depths of saints
Alone in the darkness, with half a soul they're not forlorn
Serving the sane
They're the castaways

All the wicked kept in silence
Forever to remain alone
Suppression out of absence
Deceived in the dark
With half a soul they're not forlorn
They're the wicked saints

All the wicked kept in silence
Forever to remain unknown as hatred grows
Rising from the depths of saints
Alone in the darkness, with half a soul they're not forlorn
Serving the sane
They're the castaways
