Put a gun to my head, pull the trigger
Hell, I don't care
Doesn't really seem like much to pay for what I am
Demonic violation
Infernal spawn
Never to decrease my will to live, we're made of soil

I shall last descend
I am not alone
For I am meant to crave forever
And I am blessed with heaven's pain
I'm your slave
I won't defy the bringer of death
You give me pain I cannot end

Tie a rope around my neck, hang me high
Hell, I don't care
Doesn't really seem like much to pay for what I am
Seductive misery reborn
Infernal spawn
Never to decrease my will to live
We're made of soil

I shall last descend
I am not alone
For I am meant to crave forever
And I am blessed with heaven's pain
I'm your slave
I won't defy the bringer of death
You give me pain I cannot end

I shall last descend
I am not alone
For I am meant to crave forever
And I am blessed with heaven's pain
I'm your slave
I won't defy the bringer of death
You give me pain I cannot end

My death wish shrine
My eyes so blind
When will it end?
