All these years I did not know
But now I know and do not fear
Hold the razor blade to my skin
And I feel alive as it cuts deep in

A burning soul
Marked with a death wish scar

No more of what I've been before
I've realized what I could not see
I cut myself, but feel no pain
'Cause I remember how it was to be insane

A burning soul
Marked with a death wish scar
Straying for another one
Never to erase, never be the same
Death wish scar

A burning soul
Marked with a death wish scar
Straying for another one
Never to erase, never be the same
Death wish scar

Night and day I question how
How deep I could cut without descending
Still the only pain is the mental suffering
I feel in my head

A burning soul
Marked with a death wish scar
Straying for another one
Never to erase, never be the same
Death wish scar
