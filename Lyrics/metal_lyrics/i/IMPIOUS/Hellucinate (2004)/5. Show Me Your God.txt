An eye for an eye and the world goes blind
All your prayers are made of what has begun

Redefine the lines, see the terror divine
Oh you senseless ones, now where is your God?

Silent screams
Redemption dreams
In truth lives the lie of religious belief

All you sacred ones, so let evil be
Epidemic disease, how can you not see?

Show me your God!

I watch the sacred cry, their precious dreams denied
So where is your God when heaven fails on us?
Creation divine in devil's hands, damnations begun
Redemption dreams to die
Where is your God when heaven fails on us?

An eye for an eye and the world goes blind
All your prayers are made of what has begun

Redefine the lines, see the terror divine
Oh you senseless ones, now where is your God?

Show me your God!

I watch the sacred cry, their precious dreams denied
So where is your God when heaven fails on us?
Creation divine in devil's hands, damnations begun
Redemption dreams to die
Where is your God when heaven fails on us?

Lies...
Death...
There's no light!

Terror succeeds!
No heaven...
Hell...
Hell on earth
Earth of war
War for God
God of hell?
Misery guides
Drawn to lies
Despair and suffering

I watch the sacred cry, their precious dreams denied
So where is your God when heaven fails on us?
Creation divine in devil's hands, damnations begun
Redemption dreams to die
Where is your God when heaven fails on us?
