Inside my coffin I lay
Silent in slumber waiting
Waiting for the day of retribution
Waiting for the day of retaliation

I remember the dark past
I remember the cold altar
When human flesh was opened
And blood was let out

I remember the vortex before me
Gazing into the abyss
Gazing into the void
I remember now He called me

Visions of the dark past
Again I see the bloodstained altar
I feel the cold ice blade
Opening my veins

Overwhelming power
Pulsating black might
The gates have opened
Revealing the nothingness

Slowly I awake
Scratching the coffin lid
