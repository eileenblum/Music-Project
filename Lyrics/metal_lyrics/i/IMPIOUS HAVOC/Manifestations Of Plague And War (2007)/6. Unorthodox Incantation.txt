There is place where blaze
He smiled and evil deeds appeared
We sing for flames
We sing for your glory

I remember the flames
In the kingdom of flesh
Those who saw, thought or heard
They know what we know

The cities were blazing
He smiled and evil deeds appeared
We sing for flames, for your glory
We preach love for those who saw

We are gathered here tonight
In the name of our Lord
In Nomine Dei Nistri Satanas
Luciferi Excelsis

O Great Lucifer
You are our mater
You and only you
You are our only God

We obey your will
We are your servants
We deny all other Gods
Churches and sacraments

Hic Est Jesus Christi
Hic Est Calix Volupatis Carnis
Ecce Corpus Jesus Christi
Dominus Humlin Et Pex Servorum

I am the whole who was borjn in empty cradle
I am the one whose becoming the stars predicted
I am the one whose heart is black as coal
I am the one who takes Satanâs unborn soul to its reeling aim

I am the one who will redeem
This world and send Christian souls
To their devastating destruction
I Demigod, Satanâs unbegotten son

Graveyards filled with blood
Churches in eternal fire
Blazing into the black night sky
Rising from graves and chambers

Priest crucified upside down
On the burning wall of sacharisty
Entrails spread into the burning flames
Portals straight to Hell

Darkness and suffering
Thereâs no salvation
No temple where to run and hide
The wrath-filled sermon

Thereâs no hope in light
No more love and peace
Forgiveness descends into oblivion
No remorse for the servants of light

Domine, Rex Infernus, Imperator Mundi
Introiso Ad Altare Domini Inferi
Domone Satanas, Rex Infernus, Imperator Omnipotens
Ego Vos Benedicto In Nomine Magni Dei Nostri Satanas!
