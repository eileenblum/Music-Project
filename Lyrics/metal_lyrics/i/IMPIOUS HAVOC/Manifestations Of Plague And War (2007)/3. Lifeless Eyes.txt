Blurred vision becoming clearer
Digging their own graves
With bare hands, bleeding fingers
Life will end today

Grave not deep enough
To cover the lifeless body
Will have to do for now
Life will end today

So many dead
So many will die
My flesh is strong
As is my will

Few are left alive
To spread the terror
Hands cut off
Eyes burnt blind

They shall be my disciples
They shall go forth
And spread the gospel
The genocide gospel

Lifeless eyes staring
Into the void inside
Women and children raped
Upon the dead

Cut open and left to bleed
Grotesque images
Screams of agony
Life will end today

They shall be my disciples
They shall go forth
And spread the gospel
The genocide gospel
