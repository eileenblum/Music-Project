Lost dogs of God
Wandering leashed
To the light of lies
To shadows of darkness

Leashed blind slaves with suppurate cadavers
With empty gazing eyes
They wander towards destruction
Vivere Non Est Necesse

Sheeps dare not to think
Tearing the odours of life
Damned ojnes embracing death
Quem Motuum Manu Miserat

Feeble-minded tremble with fear
Before their liberating death
Afraid to reach the other side
They march like slaves without destiny

Dominated, dethroned
Life harnessed for fear
Without warning
Like wolves they pray damnation

There was once light and God
And the kingdom of Heaven
Now thereâs only death and darkness
Hell and no hope
