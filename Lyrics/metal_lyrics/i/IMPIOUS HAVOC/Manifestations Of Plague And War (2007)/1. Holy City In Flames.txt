The city of the three Gods is burning
Smoke rises from the Dome of the Rock
Church of the Holy Sepulchre is set on fire
The Western Wall is torn to pieces

Apocalyptic visions of the holy city
Getting rid of the pestilence
No trace is left of the fool
Who spoke in Aramaic tongues of his hallucinations

The five-pointed star shall triumph
Fight their holy war with war
Express your hate through violence
Let them feel your wrath

Burn the churches
Burn the synagogues
Burn the mosques
Eradicate all the poisonous weeds

For too long have their followers ruled
It is time to set the world on fire
And throw the veil of humanity aside
Chaos shall be the only law
