You who live in misery
You who grieve for past days of life
You whose heart is hard as rock
And wrath runs deep in your veins

Open your mind and find your innermost
Look deep inside the microcosm
See what your life really is
Sorrow, pain and misery

You who seek the black destiny
Free the howling beast from your heat
Cry out the spell of Black Gods
To get the answer from the God of Impurity

Come come join us
For we are the demons of eternal life
Pay the price with your life
And join us while you can

Emptiness in your heart
When life is bursting out of your veins
Youâll find a celestial netherworlds
Where infernal flames grow eternally

Pay the price with your life
And youâll suffer nevermore
Enter to the pentagram
End your life

O glorious creature of the blackest night
Kneel down before the masterâs throne
Offer your blood to Him
And suffer no more

Pay the price with your life
Strike down the ceremonial dagger
Open your eyes and see the light
Before you die

Come take my hand
Fly with me my child
See the world beyond the stars
To the dark endless

Lurk in the nocturnal shadows
And sacrifice onto me
That which I desire most
For you are mine
