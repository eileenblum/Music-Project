I am all!
I am darkness. I am light. I am war and I am hate. I am the one who brings forth death.
I am night. I am day, my sceptre is called decease and hell rides with me.
I am the darkness that surrounds you and seduces you to commit the most blasphemous acts.
I am the steel in the axe which decapitates the men of cloth.

And as the blood of the holy taints the shining steel I will cry out my satisfaction.
I am the black spirit of the woods,
the stench of fear is my sign to attack. And do they fear me... I am nothing and I am all.

I am the void and I am the singularity of the unlight.
I am the absence of light, the true essence of unlimited darkness.

And as the blood of the holy taints the shining steel I will cry out my satisfaction.
I am the black spirit of the woods,
the stench of fear is my sign to attack. And do they fear me... I am nothing and I am all.
