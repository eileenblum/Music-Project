Born under the unholy signs of the master.
Brought up for only one purpose, to wreak havoc upon the whole earth.

We are the iron fist in the face of god.
We are spikes and the spear that impaled Christ.

We are the ones who made the feeble son of god cry in pain and rejoiced as he took his last breath.

We are the evil within all, we are chaos,
we are war, we laugh as innocents are killed.

We are slaves of the horned one.

Satan, Lucifer, Belial, Leviathan we hail thee,
for thou art the true rulers of this dying world.

What are we all, but slaves of the horned one?

Satan, Lucifer, Belial, Leviathan we hail thee,
for thou art the true rulers of this dying world.

What are we all, but slaves of the horned one?

Satan, Lucifer, Belial, Leviathan we hail thee,
for thou art the true rulers of this dying world.
