The moon is full and the time is nigh,
infant flesh must be sacrificed
to satisfy our dark lord Satan,
to satisfy our dark lord Satan.

Fires blaze and in the distance a lonely church bell is tolling the witching hour.
Crying suddenly ends with the flash of the silvery blade.

Babies bred for this purpose only,
innocent blood shall be shed.
The cult that serves the living fire,
once again has assembled.

Fires blaze and in the distance a lonely church bell is tolling the witching hour.
Crying suddenly ends with the flash of the silvery blade.

Not one drop of blood gets wasted,
all is collected to a chalice made of human skull,
and the shared equally among the black clad,
worshippers of the horned one.

As the warm blood is being consumed,
dark powers fill the members of the sombre cult.
As the warm blood is being consumed,
dark powers fill the members of the sombre cult.
