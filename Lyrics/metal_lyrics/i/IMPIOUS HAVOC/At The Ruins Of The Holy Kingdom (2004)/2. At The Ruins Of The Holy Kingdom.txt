Attack upon the gates of heaven,
the satanic hordes have gathered and the palace of god shall burn.

The last line of defence of the holy forces shall be crushed as all the lines before it.
Today is the last day of heaven.
The archangels lay slaughtered and scattered around the plains of the holy kingdom and their blood covers the once so clean realm.

Today blood rains from the heaven upon the earth,
and all living creatures shall drown to the blood of the holy.

As we now stand at the ruins of the holy kingdom we can be proud of what we have done, what a glorious sight indeed.

The pearly gates and the golden walls of heaven are now crushed down
and a thick smoke from burning flesh and feathers hovers around.
The pearly gates and the golden walls of heaven are now crushed down
and a thick smoke from burning flesh and feathers hovers around.

The bastard son of god is now re-crucified and his twelve disciples hang with him.
God himself shall impaled on a stake and we see him wither away at the ruins of the holy kingdom.
