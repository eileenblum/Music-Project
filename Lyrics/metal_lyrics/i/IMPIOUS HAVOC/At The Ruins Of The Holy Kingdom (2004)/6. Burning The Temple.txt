Do you see the flames blazing, in the distance.
Can you smell the smoke of burning wood and flesh.
In the middle of the coldest winter,
we can warm our hands at the glare of the burning churches.

Until the last of them falls,
shall our swords be wet from Christian blood.
Until the last of them falls,
shall our swords be wet from Christian blood.

Our only rejoice is to see them, crying in agony and despair as all they held holy and sacred is ruined and shall soon be forgotten for all eternity.

Until the last of them falls,
shall our swords be wet from Christian blood.
Until the last of them falls,
shall our swords be wet from Christian blood.

As the temples of god burn,
and the lambs of god are being slaughtered,
the era of satanic tyranny is upon us.
There will be no mercy for the weak.

Until the last of them falls,
shall our swords be wet from Christian blood.
Until the last of them falls,
shall our swords be wet from Christian blood.

Might is right. As the temple of god burns shall the sun be darkened by the smoke of burning hypocrisy.
Ave Satanas. Ave Satanas.

Until the last of them falls,
shall our swords be wet from Christian blood.
Until the last of them falls,
shall our swords be wet from Christian blood.

Might is right. As the temple of god burns shall the sun be darkened by the smoke of burning hypocrisy.
Ave Satanas. Ave Satanas.
