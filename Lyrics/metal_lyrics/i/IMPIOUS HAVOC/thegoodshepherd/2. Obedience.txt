Genocidal needs
To cleanse the earth
Of the human scum

Holocaust waiting
For the chosen ones
Triumphant end in fire

No right for living
Burning away
Ashes to ashes

No time to waste
Light the ancient fire
Let it burn

We must execute
All his commands
Obey him 'till death
