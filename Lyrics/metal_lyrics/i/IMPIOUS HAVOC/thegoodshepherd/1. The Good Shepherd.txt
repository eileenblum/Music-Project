This is a blessing in disguise
Like an act of god
Call it divine intervention

I just what I was told to
If the voice of god speaks in me
Who is able to resist?

Like a good shepherd
I look after my flock
Keeping them on the path of righteousness

The your ones I impale
With my holy spear
My holy spear of flesh

Blessing them with my seed
I force them to keep this secret
As others would not understand

That everything I do
I do for the glory of the lord
