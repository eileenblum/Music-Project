On the third day of the uncreation
Shall all living creatures
Of the seas and skies
Be put to death

Uncreation of god's work
The destruction of his creation

On the forth day of the uncreation
Shall stars fall from the skies
On the fifth day of the uncreation
Shall earth burn and all life shall end

Uncreation of god's work
The destruction of his creation

On the sixth day of the uncreation
Shall all light be no more
And then shall we rest
And then shall we rest

Uncreation of god's work
The destruction of his creation
