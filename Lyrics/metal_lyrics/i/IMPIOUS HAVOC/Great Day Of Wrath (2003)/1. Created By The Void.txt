Do you think you are something?
You are nothing,
But a pitiful error
Created by the void...

...which someone call God
and that error shall been fixed soon.

Soon shall there be,
No more humanity.
The whole mankind
Shall be erased...

...From the earth.
There shall be,
No more life,
For the likes of you!

Only eternal torment,
In the fiery abyss.
Our master shall,
Rise from the oblivion...

...To rule over his,
Vast dominion,
And with eternal death,
He shall reward you.

Only eternal torment,
In the fiery abyss.
Our master shall,
Rise from the oblivion...

...To rule over his,
Vast dominion,
And with eternal death,
He shall reward you.
