Demons rape and slaughter the nuns,
Blood of the holy flows and covers the earth.

All good shall be turned to evil
And all sins shall become virtues

What once was held holy,
Shall now be ruined and turned to dust

All good shall be turned to evil
And all sins shall become virtues

The tower of the Babel
Shall be raised again
To mock the failure
Of the feeble God

All good shall be turned to evil
And all sins shall become virtues

The holy scriptures desecrated and burned
As it should be done.

All good shall be turned to evil
And all sins shall become virtues
