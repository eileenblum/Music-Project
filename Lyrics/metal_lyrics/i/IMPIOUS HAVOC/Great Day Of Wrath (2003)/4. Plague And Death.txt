This is Armageddon
The four horsemen
Of apocalypse
Shall come forth...

...And bring forth war,
Famine, plague and death.

Earth trembles
The sun turns black
And the moon
Turns red as blood

Stars fall from the sky
Fire and hails rain from the sky
With blood and the earth shall burn
With blood and the earth shall burn

The beast shall rise
To mock
And blaspheme God
And all that is holy

Stars fall from the sky
Fire and hails rain from the sky
With blood and the earth shall burn
With blood and the earth shall burn

And all that is holy
Shall the beast destroy
And all that is holy
Shall the beast destroy
