Hear the priest
He is chanting
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust"
He is saying

Remember these words,
When we will come
Because we will give new meaning
For those words

We kill your family and
Burn them to ash
We destroy your homeland
And make it become dust

Pray for your God
Pray him to save you
He may hear your prays
But what could he do
When it's time to suffer

We kill your family and
Burn them to ash
We destroy your homeland
And make it become dust

When you look at the hill
When there stand three horsemen
You know the God didn't heard you
You know it's time to die

We kill your family and
Burn them to ash
We destroy your homeland
And make it become dust
