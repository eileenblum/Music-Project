Welcoming the glow; unmeasurable plasmis spiral transparant life in light
Embrace the lifeless invisible to all eyes
Caustic vibration; atmosphere ignites...
Red, barren, blank canvas; unlimited potential
Biological fortress microcosmic delusion
Defensive instincts, reflective shine the heart of a star
Unending womb; beyond comprehension siamese dimensions; intertwine...
Independant environment known only to those born of it
Intransient connection feeble are the attempts
To break that barrier we are alone
For we are narrow and lost unable to accept the presence
Alien to our perception unknown...
All in bloom... new life in eternity...

(there cosmic spores dance in the cosmic rays
Escaping their fate the flow of the universe
Another world to fertilize)

Endless cycle, another eden to follow...

(seedlings rain down upon yet another blank canvas)

They paint a life of hope in the nothingness
