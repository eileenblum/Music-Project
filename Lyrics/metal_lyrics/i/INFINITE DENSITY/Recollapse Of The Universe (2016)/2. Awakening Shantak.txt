My wings span lightyears in width
I dodge the heavenly orbs
Weaving innumerable webs of dark matter with every glide

Unveiling the cosmic theatre beneath my stride

My feathers are like a painters bristles

The light spectrum is my color palette

Carving wormhole caverns through uncharted territory
The home I call my own

Summoning my awakening every 14 billion years

When the multiverses collide
And ripples come
Knocking at my chamber door

Bestride me. 360 vision - expanding in all directions
