Inevitability, the unwritten fate of the universe
The galaxies stop gyrating outward bound

The last stars left begin to fade to black
All wavelengths of light dissipate
No more gas or matter to accrete to solid forms

Empty space cools beyond scientific measure
All quantum physics break down

The re-collapse starts enclosing

Beyond the speed of light
But the speed of black
The only observer will be its faceless self
Form of all, and ever belonging
Still existing; the architect with a blank canvas
