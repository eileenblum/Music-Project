Trillions of glowing eyes, effervescent and blinding
Sentinels burning for aeons past
Observers to all cosmic death and creation
Massive nuclear energy furnaces pustulating
Beaming incandescent rays from every pulsation
They are the center of gravity
Warping the fabric of space
All barren rock accrete around their immense pull
Creating structure and life in the solar system
But as all things existing; it must face death
This flame will eventually extinguish
Losing hydrogen and helium
Temperature begins to decrease
The supernova pulses, abating, diminishing breath
Immense radiation released as its core is crushed inwards
Final chapter. all matter dispersed violently throughout the void
Multi colour heated particles forming nebulae
A natural cosmic art with infinite shapeless beauty
