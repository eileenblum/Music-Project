Mirrored reflections
Understand the cellular makeup of man
Hexagonal corridors of light beckon
Pulses of immense heat blast of all flesh
Reconstruction of self in antimatter form

Infinite plethora of knowledge in a single thought
Quantum level and grand cosmos unite in my perspective
No concept of dimensional depth
All is one and the same
Stars are the atoms in this dimension
Universe's are the atoms in this dimension
I am beyond dimension
All collapse into itself
