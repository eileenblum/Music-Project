Chaotic vibrating points of matter the smallest constituent known
Droplets of the quantum soup
Existing beyond the collapse of time

Forming abstract spirals of grandeurpillars of gas- a nursery for the stellar imperium

Giving birth to stars that dwarf our sun

Their solar hands stretch lightyears back in time

Reaching for the retinas of ancient man
Of which they bowed before and praised almighty

The sun is the only true god
Bringer and destroyer of all life

Long after its flare is abundant upon us

Its essence will forever shine on
For many million flames to come

Spread its wings and illuminate our globe
Shroud us from the deafening sting of the void

Alas, in a universe of impermanence

Celestial fathers will wander on
