Energy clusters pulsating in spiral webs
Globular radiation beaconing through the cosmos
Tearing through the fabric of time
Consuming a trillion stars all tethered by the one blackness.
Kaleidoscopic patterns thwarting structure and form
View quantum nature in true unhinged perception.
See through the spectrum;
Arrive at the monochrome of totality.
The truth of all things; existing as static
Deconstruct the visionary grandeur you have always perceived tangible
Matter is just a construct of thought.
Pierce through the veil and dissolve back in the primordial
