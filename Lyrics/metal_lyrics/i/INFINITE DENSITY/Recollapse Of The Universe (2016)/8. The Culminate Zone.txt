Enter the zone above all that you've known
A headspace of pure nothingness
All neurons stop firing signals
All that ever once was is no longer
All vision folds into blinding light
Detachment of the physical self
Shed all perception and escape the confides of the flesh
Beyond cell structure and protoplasmic organisms
Beyond the iridescent spectrum
This is the self awareness of no awareness
Awaken from your neurosis and meet your origin
Light and darkness are all that have ever truly existed
Survival is futile when the stars stop burning
