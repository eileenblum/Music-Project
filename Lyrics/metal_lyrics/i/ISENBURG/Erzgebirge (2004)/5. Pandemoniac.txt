Ravens, ancestors souls, guide me through darkness,
declare my appearance.
Maggots under my shadow,
you follow my steps, you know my intent.

No life behind, no future before me,
so in past and so forever.

Making no difference nor being a slave of sense,
my game is to interrupt your illusion of justice.

Feeding from endless pain,
Master of insanity, conqueror of flesh.

I'm no fallen angel,
I'm a son of you.
Without wings - no chance to fly above,
damned to turn the pandemoniac wheel.
