Opening dead eyes
To find that nothing has changed
Nothingâ¦
Dead hearts
Pumping cold blood
Dead minds
With the same tired thoughts
That never change

Weâre not anyone you knowâ¦
We are just corpses wearing living masks
Separated from your world
By our bitter depression

Witheringâ¦
Negativity ...
The parasite that drank our lives

Weâre not anyone you knowâ¦
We are just corpses in living masks
Separated from your world
By our bitter depression
