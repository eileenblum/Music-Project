Uselessâ¦
My thoughts and words
Isolatedâ¦
So uselessâ¦
My mind,
It is pool of blacknessâ¦
A place of despair and isolation
That I have trapped myself in
Lightlessâ¦
Hopelessâ¦
I stay locked in my mind
Watching the black waters
Lap at the shore I sit on
They call to meâ¦
They say I can not escapeâ¦
They tell me to give in
And let them fill my lungsâ¦
I stand at the edge and weep
I can not escapeâ¦
Uselessâ¦
I wade into the blackness
Until I am wrist-deep in depression
I wade into the cold waters of despair
To let them overtake me
