My continued existence is worse than death
Yet I still live on
Trying to force apathy upon myself
To replace my depression with numbness
I tell myself that itâs workedâ¦
That I donât feel anything anymoreâ¦
But deep down, I know that Iâll never
Be anything resembling âpositiveâ
Life is my coffin
And itâs time to shut the lid.
One final action
And this will all endâ¦
One final action
And this will all endâ¦
One final actionâ¦
I canât fight the inevitableâ¦
So I embrace itâ¦
Embrace suicideâ¦
I want to die alone and cold,
And hating myself for every moment of hope that I ever had

Sad-ist â bass, keyboard, vocals
Adorable â guitars, drum programming, vocals
