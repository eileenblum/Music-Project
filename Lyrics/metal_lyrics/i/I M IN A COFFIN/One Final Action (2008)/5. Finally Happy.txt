Life is too muchâ¦
On occasion
I take
I take the razorblade
To my wristsâ¦
To my throatâ¦
Blood shows me Iâm aliveâ¦
Alive too long
I must dieâ¦
I must die today
Tonight I will be goneâ¦
Alone and dead
In my painâ¦
Sufferingâ¦
Suffering as a soul in Hell
Torment shoots through my soul
My dead soulâ¦
I will never find peace
And in my eternal suffering
I am finally happyâ¦
Finally happy
For I am dead now
