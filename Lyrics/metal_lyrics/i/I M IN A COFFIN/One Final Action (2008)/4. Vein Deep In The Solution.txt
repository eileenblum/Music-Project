I sink further into the blacknessâ¦
Down
Deeper
Foreverâ¦
Unable to feel its sting 
As I breathe it inâ¦
As it courses through meâ¦
I know I can never escape
Neverâ¦
This blackness has seeped into me
I tear at my veins
I have found a solution
To take shelter in
As I try to drown
