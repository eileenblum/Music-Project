I tasted the lips of misery
And she stole what little I had
How heavy a toll I paid
To have just a taste of the abyss
Just a tasteâ¦
Emptied, my only companions
Are mourning and self-hatred,
My lover, miseryâ¦
She was too alluring to refuse
Her offer of what lies beyond
So I took her hand and held her close
She showed me wonderful things
And promised me eternity
If I would promise eternity with her
Just a tasteâ¦
And she devoured me
Just a tasteâ¦
And all Iâve been left with is
Self hatredâ¦
The only thing I wanted
Just a tasteâ¦
Of the abyss
