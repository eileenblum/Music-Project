I stop to look as I ink this page
Turn it slowly towards your hands
Hardly turning on the wood grain
I slide the letter across its face

I stop to look as I turn to stone
Look back now, see for yourself
Burn my eyes, teach me to think
Iâve never practiced what I preached

Burn this A into my chest
And Iâm sure I will stand but you will fall
You will fall like a stone in the walls
The walls of Jericho

Look at me, look in my eyes
Is this the sinner you left alone?
Of course I wonât take this to heart
Itâs not like you left me over the phone

I stop to look as I turn to stone
Look back now, see for yourself
Burn my eyes, teach me to think
Iâll never practice what I preach

Burn this A into my chest
And Iâm sure I will stand but you will fall
You will fall like a stone in the walls
The walls of Jericho

This kiss of death, in ecstasy
Ignites my fatal fantasy
I just canât face reality
I wonât admit my fallacy

Jericho, youâre caving in
Giving way to gravity
