Sowing seeds of doubt
Growing into evil
Chaos or perfection?
Destiny or free will?

Daughters of job
Lost in the ether
Children of logic
Black holes of reason
Slow burning countdown
Stalled evolution
To our extinction?
To our awakening

Is this why weâre here?
Carrying this burden
Will it bring us peace
Challenging our maker?
