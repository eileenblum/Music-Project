In a dream of dreams
He comes to me
The waking world
Cannot compete
With the dreamwalker
Heâs all I ask for

I dream of life
And live in dreams
The waking world
Is out of reach
For the dreamwalker

Dreamwalker, dreamwalker
Dream until I return again
Dreamwalker

Through the mist I see
My destiny
To be reborn
On wings of sleep
With the dreamwalker
And sleep forever

I long to wake
To feel the sun
She cannot know
What dreams may come
With the dreamwalker

When I wake
I fear the wrath of sunlight
The moon will bring him once again
The earth will turn until the sun dies
To sleep, perchance to dream of him

The final dream is closing in
Itâs time to pay the wage of sin
For the

Dreamwalker, dreamwalker
Dream until I return again
Dreamwalker, dreamwalker
Dream for me
