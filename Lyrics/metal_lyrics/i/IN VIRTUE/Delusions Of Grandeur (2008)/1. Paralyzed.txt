I never fell so hard
You were everything
I canât control myself
Youâve got me paralyzed

My only dream
To be redeemed
My self esteem shattered
Growing cold while you leave me waiting

Paralyzed
You left me numb
Seeking comfort that never comes
I surrender to the pain
Unrequited I remain

I never fell so hard
You abandoned me
Now I canât console myself
Youâve got me paralyzed

Why have you forsaken me
When I need you the most?
Iâll never feel again
Iâm haunted by your ghost

Why have you abandoned me
When I was there for you?
I gave all I could give
Now all I want is the truth

Now Iâm awake from this dream
My free will is redeemed
Resurrect faith in me

My shell will break finally
Your command fracturing
Feel the rush of sweet release

Paralyzed
You left me here in a daze alone
Paralyzed and confined in solitude
How could you leave me here waiting?
