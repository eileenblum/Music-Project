[Trey:]
It begins
Flowing forth from its resting place
Lava creeps across the planetâs face
Behold the final event
A worldâs untimely descent
A downward spiral to a cataclysmic shock

Embrace the horror
I think itâs time for a new world order
Devastation

[Ms. C:]
Born from chaos, now we must return

[Trey:]
So be it
Quiet rumblings at the planetâs core
Slowly build into a deafening roar
The force will soon overload
A world thatâs fit to explode
The curtain falling with a cataclysmic shock

[Ms. C:]
Hallelujah, itâs a firestorm
From the earth to the sky
See the shattered pieces fly
Thereâs nothing like the smell of sulfur
In the atmosphere
'Cause Iâve been waiting my whole life
To see this planet disappear
And so we sing

Seismic symptoms of a future splintered
Weâre about to witness something massive
Molten judgment from erupting fissures
Youâve built a life and now youâll watch it melt away

[Ms. C]
Hallelujah, itâs a firestorm
From the earth to the sky
See the shattered pieces fly
Thereâs nothing like the smell of sulfur
In the atmosphere
'Cause Iâve been waiting my whole life
To see this planet disappear
And so we sing
Hallelujah, itâs a firestorm
Apocalypse divine
We are thine
Finally itâs time
Apocalypse divine
So bright
Splits the sky

[Choir + Ms. C:]
Hallelujah, itâs a firestorm
From the earth to the sky
See the shattered pieces fly
Thereâs nothing like the smell of sulfur
In the atmosphere
'Cause Iâve been waiting my whole life
To see this planet disappear
And so we sing
Hallelujah, itâs a firestorm
From the earth to the sky
See the shattered pieces fly
I wanna see the fractured fault lines
Spitting brimstone high
And when I see that molten tide
The shining moment of my life
Youâll hear me sing
Hallelujah itâs a firestorm

[Trey:]
Pieces fly off from the shattered sphere
No evidence that there was once a planet here
Disaster waiting to strike
Dutch fingers pulled from the dike
A flood of fire to a cataclysmic shock

Embrace the horror
I think itâs time for a new world order
Devastation

[Ms. C:]
Hallelujah it's a firestorm
