[Ms. C:]
Endless journey towards the sun
Dying in this wasteland
Decomposing as we are born
Lifeless we wander on

[Both:]
Righteous fury from sinful men
Charlatans and misers
Hypocrites who defile the truth
Lifeless they wander on

[Ms. C:]
Born to be let down
A waste of life it seems
Fallen from the grace of heaven
A hymn for tragedy
Broken hearts that mend for no one
Mourning souls are we

[Trey:]
Fight for all youâre worth
Shield yourself from pain
Never lose control
Pain is a disease
Virtue is the cure
Nothingâs worth your life
Standing on your own
Or living on your knees

Slaves unto ourselves
Why deny yourself?
Trapped inside a maze
Power can be yours
Your gods are made of wax
Take it from the weak
Melting with my gaze
And Iâll never say die

[Ms. C:]
Endless horror breathes awake
Boundless evil is what we make
When will the answer come?
How much more 'til weâre done?

[Ms. C:]
Born to be let down
A waste of life it seems
Fallen from the grace of heaven
A hymn for tragedy
Broken hearts that mend for no one
Mourning souls are we

Endless journey with context none,
No direction specified
With no rulebook we live a game
Time makes fools of us all

Born to be let down
A waste of life it seems
Fallen from the grace of heaven
A hymn for tragedy
Broken hearts that mend for no one
Mourning souls are we
