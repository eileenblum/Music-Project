[Ms. C:]
There is safety in numbers
Where the truth cannot find you
Thinking with one mind you will waste away
With no virtue to guide you
Thereâs a battle inside of you
This is not living
This is your decay

Itâs just a theory
But Iâm thinking much more clearly now
Iâm persevering
The truth will cost you dearly

We pursue perfection
We will suffer for it

The essence of unreason
Is the sleeping pill and youâre the bottle
Bottomless and dreaming
Now youâre wide awake and screaming

There is safety in numbers
Where the truth cannot find you
Thinking with one mind you will waste away
With no virtue to guide you
Thereâs a battle inside of you
This is not living
This is your decay

One decision
Canât take the life Iâm living now
A war of attrition
Iâll fight to be forgiven

We pursue perfection
We will suffer for it

The essence of unreason
Is the sleeping pill and youâre the bottle
Bottomless and dreaming
Now youâre wide awake

How long have you been straddling the fault line
Waiting for the perfect time to just let go?
Body is broken so sick and tired
Waiting for the perfect time to just let go
Donât lose hope
Donât dull away
This is not living
This is decay
Here youâll be tiptoe straddling the fault line
Until you find the perfect time and just let go

A parasite
Dwells in me
This parasite
That I feed

Time to let go

Iâll let go

There is safety in numbers
Where the truth cannot find you
Thinking with one mind you will waste away
With no virtue to guide you
Thereâs a battle inside of you
This is not living
This is decay

Now youâre no longer straddling the fault line
Waiting for the perfect time to just let go
Body is healing, the spirit regains feeling
Waiting for the perfect time to just let go

Don't lose hope
Don't dull away
This is not living, this is decay
This is decay
This is decay

Waiting for the perfect time to just let go
