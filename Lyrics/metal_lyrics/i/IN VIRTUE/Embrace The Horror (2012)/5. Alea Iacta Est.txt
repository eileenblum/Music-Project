[Trey:]
Roll the battle dice
Three red sixes we conquer
Believers will kneel before the crimson flag
As we rattle the sabers of war

With no warning we take away all you have worked for
Believers will steal from those who stole before
As we rattle the sabers of war

[Ms. C:]
Kinsmen
Clansmen
People of earth
Children claiming what is not yours
Desperation sowing the seed
Youâll never succeed while I breathe

[Trey:]
Crescent moon and crescent sword
We are the hammer to the anvil of the crimson flag
We will crush the disbelievers with an iron fist
Nations will tremble as they face the iron giant we create
From fear
As we rattle the sabers of war

[Ms. C:]
Kinsmen
Clansmen
People of earth
Children claiming what is not yours
Desperation sowing the seed
Youâll never succeed while I breathe

[Ms. C:]
Flames are spreading
The dominoes are falling
And facts will crush the truth
The time is coming
The dice are rolling
And death reigns absolute

[Trey:]
One last verse for the human race
Gasping out its final breath as desperation takes its toll
The four horsemen will laugh and death will spread across the earth
And weâll rattle the sabers no more

[Ms. C:]
Kinsmen
Clansmen
People of earth
Children claiming what is not yours
Desperation sowing the seed
Youâll never succeed while I breathe
