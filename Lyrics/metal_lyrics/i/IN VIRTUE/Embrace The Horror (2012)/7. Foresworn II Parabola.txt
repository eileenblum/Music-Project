[Ms. C: the wife]
[Dank: the husband]
[Trey: the horde]

[Trey:]
Death spews forth from an empty grave
The dead are coming to life again
Thereâs some hot red blood on a cold dark tomb
What a way to ruin your afternoon

[All:]
We are destroyers of darkness born
Into the light thrust
Out of the darkness we crawl

[Trey:]
Death spreads quick with a jugular kiss
Itâs a blood-borne nightmare of carnal bliss
Thereâs a thousand screams ripping through the night
For the twisted love of a murdered wife

[All:]
We are avengers of betrayal born
Husband and wife, we
Will lead the growing horde

[Ms. C:]
Soul of a man left behind
Only a killer remains

[Trey:]
A ghastly silhouette
Who would make a meal of flesh
Oath breaker, plague bearer
Your sins are come to life
A global pandemic
The world will pay the price

[Dank &amp; Ms. C:]
This wounded fear unhinging
The world, in pieces, burning
Lovers in life, but killers now
A feast of the walking lifeless
A cannibal plague
But what has changed?
Are we nothing more than puppets?
Whatever goes up must come down now

[Ms. C:]
Why do you cringe in terror?
It will be over soon
The restless hordes of hunters
Swarming, consuming, theyâll come for us too

[Dank:]
Death is all that is left of this
Unholy matrimony
Our promise sealed with a kiss
Foresworn for things ungodly

[All:]
We are destroyers of darkness born
Til death do us unite
Weâll tear the world apart

[Ms. C:]
Soul of a man left behind
Only a killer remains
Children of death come to life
Spawn of our union invade
