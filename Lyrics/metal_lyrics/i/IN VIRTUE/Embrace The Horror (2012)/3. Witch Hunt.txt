[Trey:]
The New World kneels before me
By God Iâll make my name
Bound for eternal glory
Those who oppose me shall perish in flame
Two faces, scarred and saintly
One for each god I serve
Die screaming like a banshee
Burning to death as your cries go unheard

[Ms. C:]
Bleed hysteria
Praise Deliria
Going on a witch hunt

[Trey:]
Iâll be the one standing at your door
With a pitchfork and a torch

The free world kneels before me
The crimson flag shall fall
Black lists and black intentions
Flush out the traitors and bury them all
Youâll be my final scapegoat
Ye children of the lamb
My vengeance is the last word
Sign the confession and bow to the demon again

[Ms. C:]
Bleed hysteria
Praise Deliria
We hunt
Nothing is sacred to us
Who will save you when your name comes up?

Bleed hysteria
Praise Deliria
Kneel or burn

Stride la vampa (The crackling flame hisses)
Giunge la vittima (The victim arrives)
Necrovestita (Clad in black)
Discinta e scalza (Half dressed, barefoot)
Grido feroce (A ferocious cry)
Di mortir levasi (Of death arises)

[Arthur, Trey, Ms. C:]
Leave no stone unturned
With the failing light
Build the fire high
Roasting strange fruit
Torches burning bright
Fire leads the inquisition
Through the forest
With the fallen one
We will take no names
We play God tonight
On a witch hunt
Leave your mercy behind
