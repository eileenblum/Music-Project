[Ms. C:]
Deep and silent
Tidal current
Swallowing miles of shore
A shadow consuming the coastline
Mountains are islands and islands are no more

Swimming, lost in a nightmare
Weâre sinking off to sleep in a liquid grave
Search in vain for solid ground
Seven hundred fathoms down

[Trey:]
There will be no survivors
Only corpses in the riptide

[Ms. C:]
Mighty Poseidon will have his way

Cities lost in a deluge
Another sunken monument to the dead
All along the ocean floor
Everything youâve ever known

[Trey:]
There will be no survivors
Only victims in the feeding frenzy
There will be no deliverance
Only corpses in the worldwide red tide

[Ms. C:]
Sea and sun
And no other
Here they come
Eyes of murder
We gave our hearts but it could not be saved
Weâll lay the earth in a watery grave
And Iâll sing a requiem for you
Of gnashing teeth and dead black eyes
And as the screams fall silent
Another species cauterized
Weâll bleed into the water
And bleach beneath a blood red sun
No witness to the slaughter
But blackened eyes that overrun the world

[Trey:]
All around you the water will rise
And the last thing you see will be
Dead black eyes

An endless horror wakened
A seething sea of Kraken
Something brushes past your feet
They donât come to hunt
They come to feed

[Ms. C:]
Mouth of madness
Open wide
Face the horror deep inside
The belly of the beast

All around you the water will rise
Flooding the world with a vengeance
Coming towards you the blackest of eyes
A murderous gaze in the waves
Mighty Poseidon will have his way
Taking the earth as his kingdom
Only oceans to mark where we lay
And circling fins for a gravestone

[Trey:]
All around you the water will rise
There will be no survivors
