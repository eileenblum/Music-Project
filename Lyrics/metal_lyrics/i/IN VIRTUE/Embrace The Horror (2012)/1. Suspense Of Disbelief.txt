Why does the earth shake with no end?
Why does the sky turn red?
Why does the ocean break its bonds?
This is the final curtain for mankind

See the sky, falling down on us
See the ocean, rising high
See the dead, waking from the grave
As it began it shall end and so shall we

What if we never meet again?
How will I find my way home?
Witness the death of dreaming
Witness the birth of chaos

Look to the sky, fall to your knees
Nothing survives the coming of chaos

What if we never meet again?
How will I find my way home?
This is the death of dreaming
This is the birth of chaos
