Riding the waves of timeless nothingness
on the unseen borders of existence
raising the immeasurable mountains on the unknown worlds
summoning the eternal spirits to the godless reigns

my sword is forged of wisdom
thus my enemies encounter impenetrable chaos
my sword is forged of the countless moons
thus comes my strike always from the shadows

raging black flames I bear within me
for I am the bringer of ageless decadence
I am the carrier of the incomprehensible torment
accompanied by the final era of chaos
