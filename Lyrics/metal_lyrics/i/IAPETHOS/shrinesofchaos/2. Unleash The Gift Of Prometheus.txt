Burn!
behold the legion of the upcoming era
the growing echo from the past
the everlasting memory of what once was
the first division of this rising tempest

come forth the the sons of chaos
hailing the forgotten deities on their ancient names
tear down their temples on our ancestors graves
spreading the plague of their masters lies

as a gift once we received the fire
unleash it's power to free us from chains
