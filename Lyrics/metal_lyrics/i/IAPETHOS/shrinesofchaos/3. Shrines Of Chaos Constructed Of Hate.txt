endless black swarm of hideous birds
swallowed by the shimmering boiling firmament
obscure figures baptized in draining pus
molten hands bearing the rusty artifacts
as the absence of the sun launches the lust for witchcraft
makes the living flame one to desire of burning
salacious rituals horned nocturnal dancers in pain
veiled in the blood-stained worn colourless robes

arise the gigantic serpent of the filthy water
worm unbound by chaos itself the obliterator

never again we will see the dawn
