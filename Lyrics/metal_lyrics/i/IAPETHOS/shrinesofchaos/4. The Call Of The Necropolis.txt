from the unknown planes comes the chant irresistible
like thousand sirens song in a chaotic tune
what a macabre moment like the scene of an old theatre play
burning with a lust of belonging with them
and feeling the same (nothingness inside)

hear the orchestra at the entrance coming closer
ruptured curtain opening, revealing the shadowy musicians
these fires are not illuminating the surroundings
they burn just to mark the eternal path of Tuoni

passage into the eternal night
the call of the necropolis sounds clear
this is the essence of being
timeless harmony on the trail of demise
