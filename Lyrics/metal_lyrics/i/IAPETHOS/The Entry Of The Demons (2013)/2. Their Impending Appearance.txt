The essence of hatred
Compressed inside an hourglass
A nemesis descends circling slowly
Down on the world of twilight
An epiloque of the last play in the darkness is beginning
Time is now the stage and the violence is an actor

The moment has come for the kings to leave the board
The place of rebirth of the goat has been decided

Strange statue-like figures on the crowd are moving impatiently
Beheaded god standing alone on the dead plains

See the march of demons on the horizon
Pace of their steps is the rhythm of destruction
Cries that had been heard from the depths of the earth have now been silenced
