Shadows surrounding these withering fields are on the move
Their presence is invoking the darkness from the past
Unanswered questions forgotten on time of the reign of fire
Old gods reborn from the depths of the mind

Distrupting the all levels of conciousness while forcing their way out on this world
Like a pieces of a puzzle that has no solution this nightmare has become endless
Endless like the continuously recurring art of the fallen painted on the my timeless halls
The upcoming age of wrath is to be shown within these invisible frames created by the abcence of joy

In this thickening darkness these gods crowned me an undisputed emperor on this earth
To weild the sword of misery as the shadows grow taller
Still the crown is not for me to carry

As the await for the new era has begun
