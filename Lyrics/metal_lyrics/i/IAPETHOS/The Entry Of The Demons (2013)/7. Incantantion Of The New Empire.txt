Chaotic chanting that filled the night was suddenly silent
World of mercy as they built it had vanished

Bleeding for centuries for this moment of purity
Arisen from the depths of earth this new empire

Sense these endless walls and towers carved in black stone
Sinful reflections from the past lit the countless temples of genocide
The spiral staircases rising into the nothingness
Godless wisdom springs refreshing from the fountains of eternal life

Palaces decorated with the five pointed star
The empire of the beast that arose out of the earth by witchcraft

The dawn holds no hope or joy
As the the skies have turned into the amorphous black mass
