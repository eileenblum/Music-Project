Welcomed was the dream that revealed a new absurd dimension...

The twisted spawn of the limbless angels
Those whose destiny is only to exist for terror and pain
To crawl bleeding and blinded and cry ashamed
Reforming the ground with strange elliptical shapes

Blessed were those whose voices sang from darkness
For their songs were heard indeed

Facing away from the remaining light
The horned god stood still
