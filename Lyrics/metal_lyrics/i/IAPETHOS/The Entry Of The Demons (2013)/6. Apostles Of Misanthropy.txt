Sprouting seeds of hate sown across this universe
Aiming for the death to this world of servility

When the old oath raised the arm for the final strike
To extinguish the decadence of centuries

This world deserves no salvation
Unleash the obliteration!

Flowers of misanthrophy
In the dawn of this harvest
The fall of the
Stagnant souls

Formal deception
Existence in aposthrophes
