In search for the fountain of answers
The unknown stream of inspiration
The eternal obsession of sorcerers
Thousands of years it has kept it's mysteries
Away from the conciousness of the mortal

Seek for the gold and the eternal life
Hail the one with keys for the gates of knowledge
The one that taught us to sin

The bringer of answers strenghten my heart!
Bringer of light who dwells in the dark
Enlighten my path!

Praised be the one who bears the hidden gift
Ride aside with the winds of pestilence.
Burn away the barriers ahead us!
