I'm waking up, I'm again just on my own,
Swinging on the fresh foam by myself,
And looking at the red sunset,
My reflection sneaks to the distance.

The raft tears with me,
I wonder where I will touch land.

I'm passing through the world, while I'm
Looking for my mates but people fade away in a flash
I can never get answer to my questions?

The whole world tears with me,
But I feel I touch land right away.

The region is getting colder,
And my body's growing stiff slowing down,
Life almost stops,
Just my brain rattles on.

Thoughts fly in me
I'm cold, and the loneliness pains
Now black twilight's falling on me
But I trust in taking fire here!
