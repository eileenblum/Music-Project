The animating light of the Universe strokes my face,
And my body begins to revive,
I'm floating around the magic Sun,
And my heart is full of gladness.

I' m taking delight in the sight
In the sight of the fullness of life.

I feel that the tongue of hotness lashes me,
The Sun doesn't admit me in his empire,
But forces me into endless spinning,
And pushes me into deep tumble.

Fate - Struggle- Greathness- Rising
