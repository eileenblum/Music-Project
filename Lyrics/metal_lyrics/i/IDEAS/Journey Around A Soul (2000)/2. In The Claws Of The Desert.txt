There, again arrived a caravan
That, I feel, saves me from the death
From the death that's carried by this beautiful but fearful desert
I'm sailing now wearily, but in safe with you on this boat
On the boat that's taking us to a common destination

We're holding tight each other's hands
Nothing can break these chains
The chains that are soldered by blood and spirit
Into a league that's endless and sacred
This is how we cover our long way
On the boat that's taking us to a common destination

I'm writing these lines sitting in my cabin
While I feel the breath of the tempest
Over there the wind causes huge billows on the horizon
And begins the splendid thunderstorm

I can see as the earth and the water is
Becoming one
We're flying into a new dimension by the
Wings of the ray of lights
And passing through wonderful countries
Reaching the gate of the limits
