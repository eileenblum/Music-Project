After midnight,
The dawn welcomed, dawn welcomed
Asks me to wake up
With a song, with a song

Brought by a blessed moment
The deep was so dangerous,
The hope still lives in us

Something called me,
But I couldn't see, I couldn't see
Waiting for myself,
It will be me, it will be me

There was no way back,
Just the deepness
The end of being hopeless,
Without doubt and barriers

So you should see and feel
That a bird of fire is in your mind
Just waiting for the light

You know that dawn and life and fate
Will wait for you anytime
Firebird in your mind
Free your mind

I had enough,
I looked in the mirror, the mirror
I've never been afraid of anyone, anyone

I could see my face in its face
I heard my voice in its voice
Dangerous and beautiful point

So you should see and feel
That a bird of fire is in your mind
Just waiting for the light

You know that dawn and life and fate
Will wait for you anytime
Firebird in your mind
Free your mind

So you should see and feel
That a bird of fire is in your mind
Just waiting for the light

You know that dawn and life and fate
Will wait for you anytime
Firebird in your mind
Free your mind forever

Freedom calls
