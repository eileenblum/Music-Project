Nevermind the noise,
You have strength in your voice
You can bury your head in the sand,
You can close your eyes until the end

Won't be easy,
You'll be more and more confused by life
Believe my words
You should stop right now

Without question do that one step now
Only shadow hesitates
Who's asking now,
Not a friend or foe
Just another twist of fate

Your war makes no sense,
There is contradiction in yourself
The reflection is a painful one,
Understand there's no one else

Painful questions would torment you
And you may lie to yourself
Believe my word,
You shall stop right now

Without question do that one step now
Only shadow hesitates
Who's asking now,
Not a friend or foe
Who's speaking from the other side of life
The voice from your mind and says...

Without question do that one step now
Only shadow hesitates
Who's asking now,
Not a friend or foe
Who's speaking from the other side of life
The voice from your mind and says...
From the other side
The voice from your mind and says...
