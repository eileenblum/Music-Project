The storm began to rise,
A cry from the sky
The guardian of secrets:
A poet writes

Countless shadows appear
And twist him round and round
Behind the veil of knowledge
The dark guardian rises

From home of the stars
Fire falls to earth
Because of suffering
Learns to remember
Love of eternity
Is burning its soul
Thirst for knowledge drives him
Far beyond control

Which way to go?
Like echoes in silence
Who do you see in mirror of existence?

Why do the two eyes look with desire?
Falling into dust, and bleeds to death in fire

From home of the stars
Fire falls to earth
Because of suffering
Learns to remember
Love of eternity
Is burning its soul
Thirst for knowledge drives him
Far beyond control

Fire, water, earth and wind
No one understands a thing
Why do we need pain?
Why there is grief?
Someone who cries,
Someone who fears
Living with no faith or promises

The light of one will raise you,
And raises everything

From home of the stars
Fire falls to earth
Because of suffering
Learns to remember
Love of eternity
Is burning its soul
Thirst for knowledge drives him
Far beyond control
