As peaceful islands we are sitting here
in the timeâs storm,
my hands I feel, will never let you goâ¦

The bustle takes away so many people and many things,
and a lot of peopleâs desperate fight can be seen,
but I know, I wonât let the storm rage,
and the life be destroyed.

Touch my face, heal my soul,
donât let any bad thing pester me!
Letâs sail on the see of wonderful things
towards the glittering lights of the dawn.

A new day has dawned in the grey
but hasnât revealed itself
with the rise of its stars a new life began.

I can see the future shining in your eyes,
a still purling little brook,
that will lead to the see of life
our small boat.

Touch my face, heal my soul,
live forever in me!
weâre dreaming, and false
which is happening with us
so nice this place.

A new day has dawned in the grey,
and brought You,
with the rise of its stars a new life began.
