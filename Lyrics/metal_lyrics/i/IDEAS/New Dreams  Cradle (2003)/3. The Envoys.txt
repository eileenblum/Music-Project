The weight of the long way makes me feel like falling,
but something doesnât let me rest somehowâ¦

The figure af a beautiful woman by the flickering candlelightâ¦
The face of an old man following me following everywhereâ¦

Today Iâm writing in a book of another lot,
The snowwhite pages are full of my hopes,
I engrave my beautiful mateâs name thousand times,
I want our life to be at least as nice!

Baleful feelings come to me,
The masked danger haunts me laughingâ¦

Fear flashes through the sparkling lights of the townâ¦
An old face brings me calming downâ¦

Today Iâm writing in a book of another lot,
The snowwhite pages are full of my hopes,
I engrave my matesâ name thousand times
I want our life to be at least as nice!
