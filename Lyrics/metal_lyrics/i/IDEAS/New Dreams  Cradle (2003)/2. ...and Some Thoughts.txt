So simple we are so innocentâ¦
we can see objects, things; receive and send feelings, from people to others.
We can experience many things and teach many people
weâre led by something when weâre acting-just like everyone.
We can feel love or throw it away
(we can feel pain, sometimes great.)

We say easily that we know many thingsâ¦
Friends come and change later, refuse us, become good pals of others.
We are also invisible: we live behind our own face, isolated from the others,
Nobody knows the hidden parts of our soul.
We judge others they judge us,
we disapprove if they act differently.

â¦ and some thoughts
that go through my mind after all that has happened
or maybe while itâs happening.
I just tease myself, because I donât know what to do with them.

And have you lived, if you havenât seen
stars diving into the sky by the lakeâs shore,
and Webberâs song screaming into your ears
the clearest feelings that music can carveâ¦
I think I understood deeply then and there
the word-covered things told by my taleâs main characterâ¦

In fact, I donât want to teachâ¦
Selfish intentions lead me, when Iâm telling you
what happened in a small country, because I hope
my soul lets me have a rest and I can treat all the things
that happened to me and still theyâre happening.
Just listen: a beautiful tale it isâ¦

Maybe Iâd done something before I died,
thatâs important, that matters much, that will help laterâ¦
It may fail or win, but I must finish
the things I got, hushing and swinging the winds of centuriesâ¦

If I tell you now, maybe then you will understand what occurs in me.
These thoughts change my life,
but they may not matter while all these things happen.
