Tell me, how it feels
to look in the old, broken  mirror on a new dawn,
and staring at the distance, to see in the splinters:
this man is not you anymore.
Your face is deprived of the light,
in darkness, locked up a hundred times.

Youâre slowly disappearing and swallowed by the endless distance,
Iâm reaching out my arms for your emerging hands,
to make you stay!
On the stage of life just an empty chair stands,
the curtain drops, the scene endsâ¦

On the stage of life just an empty chair standsâ¦

Iâm calling you to myself to embalm your broken wings,
for youâre the only one, for whom beautiful dreams waiting.

Youâre slowly disappearing and swallowed by the endless distance,
Iâm reaching out my arms for your emerging hands,
to make you stay!
On the stage of life the pressure ends,
the curtain drops, the scene endsâ¦

On the stage of life the pressure endsâ¦

Look at me with your musing eyes from the far distance
raise your soul, this drama is played for you.

Youâre slowly disappearing and swallowed by the endless distance,
Iâm reaching out my arms for your emerging hands,
to make you stay!
On the stage of life nobody has play,
the curtain drops, the scene endsâ¦

On the stage of life nobody has playâ¦

Iâm looking for my lost face,
to see myself in the splinters once againâ¦
