Hereâs again the Allover, enclosed by many questions, and defending itself from their merciless chokingâ¦ but still so deepâ¦ Walking alone on the cold streets and the endless ways of mind, searching for that little ray of light that will help me step outâ¦
Searching for the peace and truth without additional sinsâ¦
Sometimes I feel as if I knew the answer, but this all is not worth a stawâ¦
This all happens over me, I know youâll help meâ¦ Iâll step outâ¦ Iâm leavingâ¦
I wonât be here anymoreâ¦
Donât forget me, because maybe I will die soon, bring me the harmony, the calmness, these may make me leaving peacefully!
Preparing for the last word, but still waiting for the absolving lightâ¦
