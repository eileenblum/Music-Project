Weâre travelling, the Far East waits for us,
weâre called by the destination flying above the clouds,
weâre deeply looking at each otherâs glance
even without words our thoughts expressed.

Yet donât know what tomorrow brings,
on the sunlit townâs strange streets
every day is a secret in regard to the future,
but the time is passing, and the life wonât stop.

After a hard day,
with my dear so calmingâs a walk
but something still upsets me
couse I feel myself watched.
Reaching the square, coming out of the alley,
a ring of strange faces suddently surrounds me,
but an old hand helps me again
and when weâre coming to our sense,
we already runaway.

Whoâs this old man,
helps us on our way, rising from nothing?
Never talking about secrets,
though in troubles saves us in silence.
Now he comes with us and wonât disappear,
he may tells us why heâs hearâ¦
But he wouldnât say a word, just follows us,
and the three of us comes back from the East.

Dreams â¦ witch come back,
Mysteries â¦live deeply in me,
Secrets â¦ ensnare my life,
Thoughts â¦ speechless, without words
