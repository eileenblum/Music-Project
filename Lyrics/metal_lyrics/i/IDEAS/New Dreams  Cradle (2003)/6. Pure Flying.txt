My soulâs so vexed, I wonder where I could rest?
Whereâs that only place that hides my peace?
with wide open arms Iâm looking up the sky,
waiting for your help and feel like I could fly.

Light breeze strokes down my face
itâs so wonderful, so calming.
I move into your soul, put up your skin
to make you be with me all the time
and if I never see you again
keep my smile till youâre alive.

My soulâs so vexed, so much Iâd like to live
Please, lead me through the suffering, thereâs no end,
there I can hold you tight with a light movement
and we listen to the peaceâs endless silence.
