Here, on a strange land in deep silence, alone,
Iâm looking through a gloomy shell towards my world,
My paralyzed inside is contracted by beauty sometimes
and sprinkles a silent smile towards the rigid days.

In spite of the raging storm, I canât feel the hits of the lash,
with glazed eyes I wipe my racking prisonâs walls, Iâm speechless

Yet the power chases, yet the longing drives,
from dull reality my heart cries for life!
Iâm longing to be in the world of our dreams
the moment that there wait for us are beautiful and real,
there the ordered fate may become true,
thatâs the way Iâll find my real homeâ¦

Iâm staring at the distance just myself, but not alone,
while youâre looking at my summit from above, I do it from below,
how the setting sun paints its slices into different colours
from time to time.

Hundred days and hundred nights are burning in my mind,
the passing years engraved deep wrinkles in my life,
paying for everything by millions of bleeding wounds,
praying for a nicer day, waiting for a shining dawn.

I can feel, Iâm a shinking mote in the whirl,
tell me, where I should go in the storm?

Yet the power chases, yet the longing drives,
from dull reality my heart cries for life!
Iâm longing to be in the world of our dreams
The moment that there wait for us are beautiful and real,
there the ordered fate may become true,
thatâs the way Iâll find my real homeâ¦
