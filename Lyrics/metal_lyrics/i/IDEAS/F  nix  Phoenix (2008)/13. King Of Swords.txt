Frosty and ice-cold days
A touch without senses
Thus the king of swords
Is waiting long for his pray

After all, king of every swords
You cannot be the muse of my soul
Don't even, it's all in vain
There's no need for your heart's pain
Hard game

Clever and willy conqueror
Somehow it is suspicious
My soul is freezing in your kingdom
My ice king

After all, king of every swords
You cannot be the muse of my soul
Don't even, it's all in vain
There's no need for your heart's pain
Hard game

A living flower is blooming yet
In the altar of my soul
But my flower is dying, look
If you're nearing with your frozen thoughts

After all, king of every swords
You cannot be the muse of my soul
Don't even, it's all in vain
There's no need for your heart's pain
Hard game

After all, king of every swords
There's no need for your heart's pain
Hard game
