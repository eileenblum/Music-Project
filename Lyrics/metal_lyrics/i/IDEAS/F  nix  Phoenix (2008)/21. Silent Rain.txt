Silent raindrops
Are falling on the land
My heart is breaking
My dear homeland
God bless Hungary
So the anthem says

Look, doubt is growing in the eyes of men
Because they don't understand, understand why
Why does chaos rule the land
And who should they believe
Who's still worthy for their homeland

This is our home
But darkness embraces us
It's winter in the souls

This is our home so far
Wars are raging on the streets through
But they don't breed truth

Look, doubt is growing in the hearts of men
Because they don't understand and are afraid to ask why
Power is a vile, hungry wolf amongst sheep
And the pillar of lies reaches the skies

My dear homeland
Stormy winds are rattling your flags

You holy land, you are bleeding now
Who will save you my holy homeland?
Life calls you and the purging flames will give you rebirth

You need more than an arousal
Our homeland is bleeding from thousand wounds
Tension is growing higher and higher

But order rules the universe
These purging flames are all we need
To waste the crowd of lies

Don't need more sermons
Don't need more tension
This is the demand of this generation
You holy land, you sole one
Peace be with you

You need more than an arousal
Our homeland is bleeding from thousand wounds
Tension is growing higher and higher

But order rules the universe
These purging flames are all we need
To waste the crowd of lies

Silent rain, ease my pain
Cause my soul is a frantic sea
Silent rain, wash it away
Wash it away

Silent rain, wash it away
Wash it away
Peace be with you
