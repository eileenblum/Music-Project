The night is like a velvet dream
Tells me wonders and I hear
The wanderer of heavens
Hitting the road

I feel the fire still lives
And burns inside me
Gaining its powers from the eternal light

Long time ago
When I had the heart
Of a child inside me
I heard a fairy singing

Fancy I could get to her
And touch her wings
Because my faith made me
Reach everything

Wake me up, if you feel I'm far away
If the weight of the world
Makes me sleep, wake me up
Please look at me
After so many sins
If I can't bear the weight of the world
Wake me up

Awakening on dawn
I leave my tortured body
And give it back to mother earth

But until that many thing await me
And I put my tomorrow into your hands

Wake me up, if you feel I'm far away
If the weight of the world
Makes me sleep, wake me up
Please look at me
After so many sins
If I can't bear the weight of the world
Wake me up

I believe, if we want it
The world can be a better place
Because the key is in our hands

Come with me
And on the wings of fantasy you will see
The power of creation is ours

Wake me up, if you feel I'm far away
If the weight of the world
Makes me sleep, wake me up
Please look at me
After so many sins
If I can't bear the weight of the world
Wake me up

Wake me up
