Anywhere I turn my eyes
I see a dark ghost coming for me
Destruction comes in his wake
A mighty, fearful power bounds me
And put chains around me
This killer doesn't know else

On a stony dawn my spirit hears the earth crying
Her tears are falling down
To the deepest corners of hell
Her suffering is unbearable

Please throw away your weapons
Don't be a killer
You decide who you become
Deny, deny, say no to death

Look at the tears of a child
He's silent but he shouts
Don't you dare demanding his pure life

He drinks the blood of innocent people
With his face of a true man
Lies on his false playground
On tortured souls
The tears of children tear up
Long forgotten wounds
This is the world we live in

On a stony dawn my spirit hears the earth crying
Her tears are falling down
To the deepest corners of hell
Her suffering is unbearable

Please throw away your weapons
Don't be a killer
You decide who you become
Deny, deny, say no to death

Look at the tears of a child
He's silent but he shouts
Don't you dare demanding his pure life

How many lives do you need?

You decide when, why
Where and who you are
You can choose eternal life
Or shady death instead

Please throw away your weapons
Don't be a killer
You decide who you become
Deny, deny, say no to death

Look at the tears of a child
He's silent but he shouts
Don't you dare demanding his pure life

You decide
