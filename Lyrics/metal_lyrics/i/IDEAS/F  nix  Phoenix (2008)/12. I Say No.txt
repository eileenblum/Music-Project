I have a question
What have the values become?
Why do you call it human
When it burns up in vain?

A pale star shines
Then it falls down
Because you need plastic virtues
So you must become a tool

No matter if it hurts
It feels so human
Hard business
Luxury takes your soul
You can't be what you were

Inhuman just a tool
It hurts to look at the mirror
Burn up all your emotions
Just to become a star

An image lives deep in my soul
A fair story about a child
His heart knew exactly
What he is worth
He's not afraid

This is the fate you chose
This is a narrow pathway
Who lives faithfully
May his life be blessed
An ancient rule
Heavenly rule

An image lives deep in my soul
A fair story about a child
His heart knew exactly
What he is worth
He's not afraid

An image lives deep in my soul
About a child, who lives straight
His heart knew exactly
What he is worth
He's not afraid

I say no
I say no
