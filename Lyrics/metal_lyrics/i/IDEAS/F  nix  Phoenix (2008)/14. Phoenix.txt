So, the story says
There was a lonely maid
Her sincere eyes
Were full of deep pain

A world put into prison
A world that's afraid of love
She was walking by night
With sorrow in her heart

Firebird, where are you?
Firebird

My heart is seeking, my heart is searching
In the fullness of the entire universe
My heart is joyful, my soul is free
A real starchild was born for me

The years went by
Her torments went too far
It has changed the color of the sky

Words meant nothing by now
The past faded to plane
In the end she could read
The signs of the times

Firebird, where are you?
The girl asked:
Angelheart, touch me now

My heart is seeking, my heart is searching
In the fullness of the entire universe
My heart is joyful, my soul is free
A real starchild was born for me

Angelheart, touch me now
