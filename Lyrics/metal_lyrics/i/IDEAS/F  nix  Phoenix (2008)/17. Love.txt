When I feel I'm dying
When I feel I'm drowning
The whole world is swirling

I've got to escape from here
Insanity surrounds me
I need to seek refuge

Love sets my soul on fire and I burn
When I breathe music
The love is the flame of purgatory

I can't wait for its touch and temptation
With wasted desire I wish to hear the song
Everything passes away: loves, luscious dreams
But my soul revives when I hear
The sound of the guitar

When I'm not singing
I live like a shadow
And the moon laughes at me

When I'm walking the streets
Or dreaming of a better place
My soul just keeps singing as well

I can't wait for its touch and temptation
With wasted desire I wish to hear the song
Everything passes away: loves, luscious dreams
But my soul revives when I hear
The sound of the guitar

This love sets my soul on fire and I burn
When I breathe the music
I'm alive

I can't wait for its touch and temptation
With wasted desire I wish to hear the song
Everything passes away: loves, luscious dreams
But my soul revives when I hear
The sound of the guitar
