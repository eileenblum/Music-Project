Let it burn
Let it burn

Poured its shadow on you
On the paths of your fears
Maybe dark spirits of your memories
Are pursuing you

Be strong now
Yesterday is already behind you
Just go ahead on your way

An angel brings you
The heavenly flames
Hides it into your heart, burn on
Sky is dark by the crimson river
You may be afraid
Just move on

The heroes are touching land wearily
From their faith, a new world is born
The last candle is still lightning
Its hope itself

How many times did you fail?
You should just ask yourself
Because your soul torn by fear cried up again

Can you hear the guitar?
And behind the hills the sun rises
Bringing peaceful times

An angel brings you
The heavenly flames
Hides it into your heart, burn on
Sky is dark by the crimson river
You may be afraid
Just move on

The heroes are touching land wearily
From their faith, a new world is born
The last candle is still lightning
Its hope itself

Heaven and earth meet
And it's about to begin
Angelic lights touching you
You will be free
Forever
