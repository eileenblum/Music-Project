The universe holds thousands of secrets
We are flying through the night without wings
The darkness is approaching

You are sightless and deaf, like a mortal man
In a dark and angry storm, where are you going?
In a cruel and hostile world, who do you call?
How do you stay fair in a war?

I don't know how long the great war will last between the worlds
But for your spirit and for my soul we gave birth to this song

A clean-hearted child rises from the past and calls you
He asks you not to remember what you were, remember him

Because you are blind and deaf, like a mortal man
What have you become in a dark and hostile world?
Why do you swear an oath on your fallen gods?
What do you expect from your illusions?

I don't know how long the great war will last between the worlds
But for your spirit and for my soul I sing it a thousand times

To light the fire in your heart
Let it burn until your live
And charm away darkness

I don't know when the times come
When you have to leave for good
But the silence will make up for everything

Silence, in the silence you can hear the whispering
The calm ones never shout
Long time ago I'm been waiting in the deepest corner
For your spirit, I just want you to remember me

The ancient war rages between
The skies and the world
Run away before the storm breaks out

I don't know how long the great war will last between the worlds
But for your spirit and for my soul I sing it a thousand times

To light the fire in your heart
Let it burn until your live
And charm away darkness

I don't know when the times come
When you have to leave for good
But the silence will make up for everything
