I stand in the freezing wind paralyzed
Barely living, half dead
A revelation eats me up
He was the traitor

This viperish snake, this crawler
A treacherous adversary
Who resides this planet just to make sure
That you are losing

You felt so many times that it's over
Like your two selves were dueling
Or you just feel you're going crazy
Or what on Earth has happened

Never believe that you have lost
Never believe that your power is gone
Please see it through
He needs your soul

Sometimes the heavens were yours
And you have one piece still in your heart
That's why he hates you
And he demands your treasure

His sweet kiss poisons you as he traps you
Unnoticed but he kills so fast
While you strive in distress
You wouldn't believe

Your illusions are falling in the deepness
They meet only lies and frost down there
You know you can't be any deeper
But it's an illusion too

Never believe that you have lost
Never believe that your power is gone
Please see it through
He needs your soul

Sometimes the heavens were yours
And you have one piece still in your heart
That's why he hates you
And he demands your treasure

Only the heavens
He needs your soul
And he demands your treasure

Don't believe, it's a lie
You shouldn't compromise
He lies in ambush for your treasure
Don't believe any thought
Anything is a lie
He's afraid of the light of your treasure

Don't believe, it's a lie
And nothing but this light can destroy him
