Under starry sky you stand alone
How could you escape and fly away
Deep inside a temple
Tears of your sins can't make you stay

Back in time the darkness chased you
And played its deadly games
Fooled your mind again
Closer to hopelessness
Closer to gates of the insane
It was in vain

And still we don't give up the fight
We fail and still we pay the price
Our tears will lighten up the night
Fate is pulling the strings
And still we survive
Ever when God is closing his eyes
So you will rise up
You are not alone

It's hard to notice the hand to help you out
Deep in the dark
So let there be light
Light the spark
Through this deep abyss
Sweep away the lies
You can feel the might

And still we don't give up the fight
We fail and still we pay the price
Our tears will lighten up the night
Fate is pulling the strings
And still we survive
Ever when God is closing his eyes
So you will rise up

Under starry sky you wait for me
You wish to fly and finally disappear
Our wings have broken so long ago
You're deep down but your prayers hit the sky
