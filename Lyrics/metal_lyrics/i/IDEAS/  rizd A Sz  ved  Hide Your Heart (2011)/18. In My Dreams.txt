The fire, the desire
The will to run and sink inside your smile
Just listen to your dreams now

My dreams are burning fires
Blinded in my desires
There's no more early mornings
In my heart a rose is blooming

We all hope that love is more than just a dream
It's not illusion anymore, you fly like an angel
Safe in the clouds, there's no danger

We all hope that love can tell the secret words
But who will pay for the tears
When the fiery summer disappears

The fire, the desire
The will to run and sink inside your smile
Just listen to your dreams now

We've lost this fire somehow
I have to pay the price now
This dream is finally ending
My rose is slowly dying

We all hope that love is more than just a dream
It's not illusion anymore, you fly like an angel
Safe in the clouds, there's no danger

We all hope that love can tell the secret words
But who will pay for the tears
When the fiery summer disappears

Take this tiny flame
Like many times before
It's the last one
I don't need it anymore

Through your heart the fight just took my dream away
I'm finally awake, the memory is all left to stay
Through my heart the fight just kissed your dream goodbye
I gave you my heart, I give you to the night, now you can fly
