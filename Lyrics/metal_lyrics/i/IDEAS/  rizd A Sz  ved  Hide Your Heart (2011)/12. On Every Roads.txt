Beautiful, you are rambling down on every roads
You're a fool, you will find ashes all along
Somewhere there will be a better world you know
You stare till the end, when there's nowhere to go

I love that you're rambling down on every roads
I'm a fool, I needed time to understand your goals
Inside I just have to heal with my own heart
To find a reason why we never be apart

You know that everywhere you go I will be there
And I will see how you become one with the road
I know that everytime you fall again
You won't feel the pain
And you will rise again to carry on
Carry on

This life is just a lullaby
Let it pass you by
Clear your soul of anger
Clear your weary mind

I know wherever you go, wherever you are
There are miracles by your side

You know that everywhere you go I will be there
And I will see how you become one with the road
I know that everytime you fall again
You won't feel the pain
And you will rise again to carry on

I know wherever you go, wherever you are
There are miracles by your side
On every roads
