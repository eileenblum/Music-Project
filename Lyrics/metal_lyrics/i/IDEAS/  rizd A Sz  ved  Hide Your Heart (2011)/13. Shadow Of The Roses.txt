Wherever you can be, your soul is here with me
Don't cry my love, I gave all my pain to the endless sea
And if you're too scared to call, just trust me like before
There's some hope, the dream is there, just let that curtain fall

You know that no one's perfect, don't tell me what you've done
But I've had to turn away, my doubts and fears have gone
There's someone waiting for you, a guardian by your side
So release the curse if you can kiss your sinful past goodbye

I had no guide, only loneliness, I couldn't start to fly
Emptiness inside, only misty mess, in this heart of mine

In the shadow of the roses we can find a secret moment
Don't you cry, our life is just dust in the wind
In the shadow of the roses everything will be different
Under the stars our pain and sorrow will turn to nothing

So everything will burn and the pain is fading away
Reach for the light, salvation is on the way

I had no guide, only loneliness, I couldn't start to fly
Emptiness inside, only misty mess, in this heart of mine

In the shadow of the roses we can find a secret moment
Don't you cry, our life is just dust in the wind
In the shadow of the roses everything will be different
Under the stars our pain and sorrow will turn to nothing
