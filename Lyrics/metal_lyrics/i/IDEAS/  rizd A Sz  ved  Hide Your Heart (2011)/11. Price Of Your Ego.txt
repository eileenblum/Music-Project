No, no, I did not ask another lie
I have just my patience now
Just tell me, how long till I wave goodbye

Your words embrace me, but they just fool me...

So you don't realize that it's over now
Now you will pay the deadly price
Everything's gonna fall apart

I was waiting for your call
Leaving all your pride behind
But you're just like Judas deep inside your mind

I hear your voice now, it poisons somehow...

So you don't realize that it's over now
Now you will pay the deadly price
Everything's gonna fall apart

So now you close your eyes and you turn away
You don't wanna see the game you play
I hope you will find out one day

All the pain and all the tears that fell
All through the years, they will hunt you now
So you remember all the time
Your ego will kill your mind

So you don't realize that it's over now
Now you will pay the deadly price
Everything's gonna fall apart

So now you close your eyes and you turn away
You don't wanna see the game you play
I hope you will find out one day
