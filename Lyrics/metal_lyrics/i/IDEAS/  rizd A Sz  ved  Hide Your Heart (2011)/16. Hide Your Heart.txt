You're standing at the door with a soul of raging war
And your heart is looking for an answer
You try to step outside but you're locked down by the lie
And it cuts you like a knife, like cancer

Just hide your treasure deep in your heart
Deep in your sweetest pleasure

You fill your cup with hate as you drink it's all too late
And all the hope is bleeding out from your eyes
Law or empty fate, it's the eternal debate
How to go on, you can't decide, no surprise

Just hide your treasure deep in your heart
Deep in your sweetest pleasure

Don't you fear, just hide your heart
The night will be over soon
Don't let the world tear you apart
Upon the Earth, under the Moon
Don't you fear, the dawn is rising
It will tear the night apart
Seven angels bring the morning
Just hide your heart

Don't you fear, just hide your heart
The night will be over soon
Don't let the world tear you apart

If you let the peace inside
Pain will fade, pain will die
You will be really free
Then the endless sky awaits
When your heart will bathe all the light
Then you can find heaven
