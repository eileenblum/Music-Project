Earth and sky, near and so far
I am searching for you desperately
Hundred-thousand moments I'm dreaming away
You're the dawn for me

I don't care how much longer
There's a few more steps I have to go
You know me for so long and see me as you child
I am your prodigal son way back home

Now I know, the only place called home is you
I give you everything, deep in your soul it's my life

Earth cries out for you and all the hearts inside of you

Another dawn is rising and the tears fade away
See the shining light and all the answers in those rays

Earth cries out for you and all the hearts inside of you
So hear the call, fade away into the blue
