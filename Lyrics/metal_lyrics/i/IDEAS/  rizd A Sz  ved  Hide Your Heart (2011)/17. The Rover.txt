As the rover walks
He doesn't ask or talk
When he finally stops
The crossroads wait in vain
Where to go now?

But the answer is far away
The stars are all so silent
Is anything gonna change
Is anything gonna fade
Still he feels it all again
He starts to walk these roads of pain
Everything is in vain
Everything is the same

As the bridge awaits
The abyss is too deep
It's time to meet the fate
There is nothing to keep
Time to go on

Now the pain is far away
The abyss is so silent
Is anything gonna change
Is anything gonna fade
Still he's wandering again
He keeps on following the pain
Everything is in vain
Everything is the same

He's the rover
Walking over the distance with a smile
And again and again
He won't stop until he dies
He's burning, never turning
He will walk to reach a goal
Just like every day before

Deep down he knows there is nothing to follow
The road will go on and on
It's time to rise, carry on

He's the rover
Walking over the distance with a smile
And again and again
He won't stop until he dies
He's burning, never turning
He will walk to reach a goal
Just like every day before
