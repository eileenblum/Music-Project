Deadly silence around
All this sorrow, all the pain
And I'm watching my teardrops
On the ground

Fate is so cruel
It's like a judge, without emotions
Still it hurts so much to fall
Without a sound

In the embrace of your soul
Your heart told me the secret
That forever you may go, you will be here
Where do we go after we fall
It is true that we will live on
Our everlasting soul can find its home

Surrended by the light
Shining stars start to glow
Somewhere a new life is dawning
This is the way, I know

In the embrace of your soul
Your heart told me the secret
That forever you may go, you will be here
Where do we go after we fall
It is true that we will live on
Our everlasting soul can find its home

And in the end of the road I will see you in the light
Just hear my words before I let you fly

In the embrace of your soul
Your heart told me the secret
That forever you may go, you will be here
Where do we go after we fall
It is true that we will live on
Our everlasting soul can find its home

And in the end of the road I will see you in the light
Just hear my words before I let you fly

I don't say goodbye
Just send to your dreams goodnight
