Whispering trees of summer nights
This world is just full of noise
Only stars can give a choice
Serenity

All over my body
I can feel energy flows
I can feel the hope that grows
Inside of me

I know, the role just drained your life away
But you're still holding the key
Guard it well for you and me
And you will see

You have to pay the price of life
For love you have to burn inside
Sometimes no one will hear you cry
(They won't hear your cry)
You have to love just to be loved
Just like you love your eternal god
To feel it all around
(To feel it all around)

And now your role is just to be yourself
The world won't stand in your way
Say what you have to say
I won't turn away
And if there are no miracles in your life
No one will help you
You have to find your peace
And make it real somehow

You have to pay the price of life
For love you have to burn inside
Sometimes no one will hear you cry
(They won't hear your cry)
You have to love just to be loved
Just like you love your eternal god
To feel it all around
(To feel it all around)

It might hurt you and it might haunt you
Just to see the end is near
I know, I know this fear
Let it disappear
You have to love and to be loved
Just like you love your eternal god
So let go out this fear
Let it disappear
