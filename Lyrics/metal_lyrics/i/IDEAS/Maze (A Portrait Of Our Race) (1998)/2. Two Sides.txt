Two siblings,
They are our eternal friends
They are in our blood,
Though sometimes they aren't so important.

They are the twins of the world,
The best judges of life.

"May you be kind to us" - these are the words of the prayer.

Two angels and two devils,
It's rough but it's true,
They are the companions of the human tasks
Living by each other.

"You are bind as we're to you" - we say, but it vain.

[Laszlo Bekesi Jr.]
