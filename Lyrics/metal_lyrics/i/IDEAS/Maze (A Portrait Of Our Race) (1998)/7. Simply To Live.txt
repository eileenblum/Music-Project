There are clouds in the sky,
The roaring wind has blown my life away.
But I can still remember the embracing of the last sunrays
And how my happiness escaped.

The storm has been going on for hundred days,
I'm waiting for it to strike on me,
But the silhouette of the sun is calling me -
Living in a shame, I suffer from pain.

I've made some sins.
But only I?
I've killed the clear wonderful happiness,
But my hands are not covered with blood.

Will the fight of the heavens be finished?
The lake has reached my feet.
I'm ready for the last word,
But I'm still waiting for the absolving light...

[Epilogue]
I'm standing here, on top of the hill,
I need a word and I will stay.
