Open your eyes and see,
And listen to people singing.
Though their lives are full of pain,
They are still smiling.

Your star is also in the sky
But it is not shining.
You locked the door behind the other world
Your dark mind is locked up you don't hear anybody.

Go, if you wish,
But you'll be sad at the end of your road
You may cry for help,
But nobody will hear you
Are you longing for love?
It's too late for being accepted.
Did you want to be different?
You'd better be who you are.

You thoughts cannot help you
Your heart is too weak
You'll remain who you are
And your star is also disappearing.

[Tibor Preil]
