A new day has dawned in the grey
But hasn't revealed itself,
With the rise of its stars,
A new life began

I'd been lulled by this life
And clasped in its arms
Then I got aim in my hands
And didn't believe my eyes

We're dreaming
And false which is happening with us
So nice is place

I've accepted the gift,
The delicate beauty
And admiring it I feel asleep

[Laszlo Bekesi Jr.]
