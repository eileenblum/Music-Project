He's forced to live his life
Immortal by the light
He stands alone in silence
With a soul of just delight.

It's a long time since he's been
Keeping memories in his mind
He's covered with rotting bark,
In the grey twilight
A gentle, childhood scene
A dark, destructive heart

His cold suol is exhausted,
And slowly cooling down
Tired hands are grasping his heart,
That's gleaming inside
A soundless shadow
A harsh and frostly wind

He's forced to live his life
Immortal by the light
He stands alone in silence
With a soul of just delight
He's the rememberer
With a treasure in his mind
And no one else guards
The past of the mankind
