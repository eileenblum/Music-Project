In the quest beyond mere existence
our lives are our resistance.
In the quest beyond the final solution
our death is the only revolution.

Humanity hangs on the cross of despair. Only the sun sees
our world has disappeared to exist only as point of moot.

Prepare to meet the arrow of the sun while in the hour of
our death the fire will burn. Burn. Now the sun is in flames.
It seeks our flesh. And... we... die... silent. Die silent.
You will die silent.
