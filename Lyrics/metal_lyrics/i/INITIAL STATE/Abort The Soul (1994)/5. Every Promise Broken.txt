And still we must resist.
We have nothing to celebrate, break the silence.
We have nothing to celebrate, break the silence.
And still we must resist.
For 500 years, every promise broken.
For 500 years, every promise broken.

A legacy of slavery.
Do not be overwhelmed by forces aligned against us.
Do not be overwhelmed by forces aligned against us.
And still we must resist.
Our determination will bring the vision to life.
Our determination will bring the vision to life.
And still we must resist.
For 500 years, every promise broken.
For 500 years, every promise broken.
Our legacy...
