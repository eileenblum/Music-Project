A million eyes turn up and pierce the sky.
A glimpse into oblivion. The irrelevance of time.
Eclipse... Eclipse... Eclipse... Eclipse...

Can we blot the sun?
Are we so strong after all?
Worshipping our idols, surrounded by walls.
Eclipse.

Protection from what? Infinite conquers all.
Like sand castles when the waves take their toll.
Always fall.
Eclipse.
