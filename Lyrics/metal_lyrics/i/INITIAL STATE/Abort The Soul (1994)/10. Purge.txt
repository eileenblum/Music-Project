The first mosquito that bites hardly annoys.
Ten billion parasites sucking leave the most choking.
The conquest nearly absolute
nothing left for science to reproduce...
(We are) our own pesticide.

And the sermon speaks of progress so embrace the new religion.
Witness miracles. Speak in tongues. Revel in tunnel vision.
But the earth is eternal and it will heal in time
so much the more majestic devoid of human slime.
(We are) our own pesticide.
