There is only one solution.
Utter annihilation of this one parasitic abomination.
The words can only be the fuse. The bomb it must be real.
The idea made of flesh and only then, to break the steel.

Back to the beginning. Back to the womb.
And if the people refuse then the people are doomed.
Back to the beginning. Back to the womb.
And if the people refuse then the people are doomed.

There is no salvaging any part of this techno artificial disease.
Just the fortresses built of concrete falling to the persistence of the trees.

No revolution in the context of our reality.
Irreversible decay of the industrial remains.
Visualize collapse of everything resembling.
Loss of human contact with the force that makes us free.

Only then can we dream, and begin to breathe.
Back to the beginning. Back to the womb.
And if the people refuse then the people are doomed.
Back to the tribe. Back to the earth's womb.
And if the people refuse then the people are doomed.
