Abort the soul. Plant the seed.
The natural state fall casualty.
Gods... Gods... Gods... Gods...

Shout platitudes above idiots fervor.
Let us obey. Lambs to slaughter.
Gods... Gods... Gods... Gods...

Icons worshiped. Lobotomize.
Forked tongues. Slivered spines.
Gods... Gods... Gods... Gods...

Bloodlust satisfied. Salvation sold.
For the new Christ. Abort the soul.
Gods... Gods... Gods... Gods...

In fertile minds plant the seed.
In vacant minds abort instinct.
Salvation sold. Abort the soul.
