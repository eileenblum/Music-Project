You would bring another into the vile machine?
One more mouth among the billions to hang agape in need.
Another nail into the coffin of a planet bursting at the seams
Such a price you ask to soothe your human vanity.

Feast! Feast!

Good citizens make us healthy babies there are factories to build.
Good people make us sickly babies there are hospitals to fill.
Good people make us black babies to fill the prison cells.
Good people fuck like beasts so the state can...
(And you would bring another?)

Feast!
