We are the new people. We are the old people
We are the same people. Wiser than before

Water it feeds us. Fire to forge
Air for outstretched wings. The earth it heals

We are the new tribes. We are the old tribes
We are the same tribes. Stronger than before

Water it feeds us. Fire to forge
Air for outstretched wings. The earth it heals
