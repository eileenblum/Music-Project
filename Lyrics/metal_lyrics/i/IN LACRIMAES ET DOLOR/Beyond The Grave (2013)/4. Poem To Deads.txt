[1st verse]
Rise, children of loss,
Shine over your sorrow.
Rouse, your time arrived,
Lay out your wounds.

Rise, children of tears,
Dispel your loathing,
Rouse, lead our souls
To edges of the mourning.

Rise, sons of despair,
Reborn from the past
Emerge, inner creations,
And guide us to lust.

Rise, wandering spirits,
Reveal your desires,
Howl, decay your fears,
Beyond world's sweet lies.

[Interlude:]
A dense mist rise upon my feelings,
Enshrouding me with mourning and fear,
Screaming painfully and suffocating,
Souls from withered past are near...

I opened my eyes and I looked to the skies,
And a cold breeze sweeps to my skin,
And the windswept drops suddenly
Bearing on its wings the chants of the fallen.

They will never live again in this world,
They will never can hope in an better destiny,
They were forgotten by their cold gods
And the death bring to them an inner salvation.

Their chants are sad and salty like the sea,
Like the tears they lived on autumn leaves,
Their fragile paths lead them to the end,
Where days turns to the cold tombs of hopes.

[2nd verse]
My God, see them, hear their prayers,
Help them, save them from themselves.
My God, see them, hear their voices,
Help them, be their guide to joy.

My God, teach them, forgive their misdoings,
Adopt them and give them a new live.
My God, trust them, adorn with patience,
Believe them and don't let again to die...

[3rd verse]
Rise, children of loss,
Shine over your sorrow.
Rouse, your time arrived,
Lay out your wounds.

Rise, children of tears,
Dispel your loathing,
Rouse, lead our souls
To edges of the mourning.

Rise, sons of despair,
Reborn from the past
Emerge, inner creations,
And guide us to lust.

Rise, wandering spirits,
Reveal your desires,
Howl, decay your fears,
Beyond world's sweet lies.
