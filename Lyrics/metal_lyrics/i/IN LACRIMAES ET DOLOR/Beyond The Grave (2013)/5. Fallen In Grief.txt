In madness we'll dwell quietly ,
in grief we'll slow fade,
in deep valleys of sorrow
our jaded moon will descend.

In loss we'll drown gently,
In distress we'll fall asleep,
and our crimson sunset
will veil our stern sin.

.................
and crimson sad sunset
.................
will veil our stern sin

[Interlude:]
Since I was rejected,
since I fell in sins,
I've searched my sanity
at the edge of fears...

since I was an godless,
since I've lost my faith,
I've searched my answers,
at erroneous prophets.

[2nd verse:]
horns will play dirges,
winds will howl odes...
in tempest we'll hum secrets,
sands will veil throes...

countless crows will swarm
beyond painful deceits,
remnants of loss will entomb
our silent regrets.

[3rd verse:]
In madness we'll dwell quietly ,
in grief we'll slowly fade ,
in deep valleys of sorrow
our jaded moon will descend.

In loss we'll drown gently,
In distress we'll fallen asleep,
and our crimson sunset
will veil our stern sin.

.......................
will veil... our sin...
......................
stern sin...
