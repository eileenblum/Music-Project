[1st verse]
I'm lost in this sands,
I'm running from fate,
I'm living in sorrow
I'm searching the gates

There's so much lost,
In my senseless life,
So cold and so empty,
I'm dying inside...

My colours are fading,
I feel this poison,
This taste of the mourning,
And I am (alone)...

[2nd verse]
I've lost my sanity
Between darkest nights,
I sail through rough oceans
Behind vague gods.

I'm damned and doomed,
I'm trapped in my paths,
No one hear my prayers,
My tears or my wrath...

My heart is so leaden,
My mind is so tired,
My life is so empty,
I'm dying inside...

My fears are so many,
My days are so gray...
My dreams are fragile,
Like fragile my ways...

[Interlude:]
Why You are so silent,
Why You are so cold?
Be my guide, my shepherd,
Save me, oh, my Lord!

Why remain You a witness
Of my pain or defeats?
Why are You so rigid
With my errors and guilts?

Save me from my madness,
Save me from my fears,
Where is now your kindness,
Where You disappeared?

Save me from my deserts,
Save me from false helps,
Don't ignore my prayers,
Save me from myself.
