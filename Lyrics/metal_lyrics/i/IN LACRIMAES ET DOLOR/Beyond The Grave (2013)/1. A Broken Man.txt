[1st verse (growl)]

Loss, sadness
Grief, madness.
Pain, tears,
Ashen memories...

Darkness, silence,
Fear, coldness,
Cries, despair,
Deep nightmares...

Hurted, locked,
Kicked, stalked,
Sad, Withered
In quiet emotions...

Buried, Broken
Lost, forgotten,
drown, frozen
In my aeon...

[2nd verse (growl)]

Horns, whispers,
chants, distress,
ashes, secrets,
arid windswepts...

shame, aches,
thorns, wounds,
suffering, sore,
strange sounds....

deep, dark,
stream flows,
vague, loose,
dark crows...

Buried, Broken
Lost, forgotten,
drown, frozen
In my aeon...
