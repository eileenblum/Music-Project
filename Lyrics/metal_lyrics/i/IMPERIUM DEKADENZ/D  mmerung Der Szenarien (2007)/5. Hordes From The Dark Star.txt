From spheres of damnation, they rise
Lead by an unrestrained hate
Convinced of pure evil
They terminate the era of light...of light

Fugam victoria nescit

The hordes from a dark star

Hate built up through millenniums
Cursed are the weak
Driven by a malignant obsession
Their grand victory is eternal...eternal

Mors ianua vitae

The hordes from a dark star

Morituri te salutant

The path of men...came to an end
The voyage into oblivion...has just begun
