Traitorous light betrays my soul
My reflects, affected in a negative way
My nature requires for darkness
As my spirit strifes for release

Nocturnal elegance
Proudly and raised
The night, my throne
The night whispers to the wise

The strength of isolation
Which the most cannot feel
An experience for the chosen

Nocturnal divinity
Proudly and raised
The night, my throne
The veil of darkness
Coats my mind
The night whispers to the wise

Traitorous light betrays my soul
My reflects, affected in a negative way

Nocturnal elegance
Proudly and raised
The night, my throne
The presence of knowledge
Attracts my spirit
The night whispers to the wise
The night, my throne
The night whispers to the wise
