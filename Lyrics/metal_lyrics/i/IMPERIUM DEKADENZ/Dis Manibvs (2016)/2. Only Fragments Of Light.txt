Poisoned falls the time
down to the depths of unknown
with crippled might and potency
rankling the soul
lost in undertow 
an abysmal fall
anchorless down
to the unlighted home
in the thorny grove
silence stills the heart
rage chases the cold spurs
to a shimmering light...so pure
dreams break on a scant tide
lives hope are shorn
with many thoughts unborn
a fire is inflaming the night
a cry echoed thru the trees
their mystical dancing begins
...and whispering spells
the soul glows
awful awakening 
torment of soul
...strafing the chains
only the dreams are free
owls glide through the night
leaves sway silent in the wind
stars are dancing on the sea
and whispering spells
the soul burns
awful awakening 
torment of soul
...strafing the chains
only the dreams are free
a fire is inflaming the night
a cry echoed thru the trees
their mystical dancing begins
...and whispering spells
the soul flies
living in dreams
unchained and free
one day i will arise
from my profound abyss
