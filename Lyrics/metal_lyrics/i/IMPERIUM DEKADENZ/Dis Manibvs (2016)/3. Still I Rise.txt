The Mysteries of life and death
that make you weak â just make me stronger
on the fields of destiny
I know where I belong

Standing at the edge
drowning in the sea
carried by the winds
Still I rise

Like the moons and like the sun
with the certainty of tides
in the darkest of all nights
Still I rise

Darkest nights, lack of empathy
a journey towards creation

Standing at the edge
drowning in the sea
carried by the winds
Still I rise

Like the moons and like the sun
with the certainty of tides
in the darkest of all nights
Still I rise

Still I rise
Still I rise

The world we see
our destiny
we will leave it all behind someday

The world we see
our destiny
we will leave it all behind someday
