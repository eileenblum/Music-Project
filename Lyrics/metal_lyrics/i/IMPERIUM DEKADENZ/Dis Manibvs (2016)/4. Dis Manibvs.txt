A pale light frames your weary face
your labored breath clouds the last light on the day

Unbidden thoughts of better times
donât make the trade any easier

This last stage you must go alone
would that I could go with you

As we travelled many such before
whether through storm or sunlit meadows
all these roads we walked together
all these memories will never fade

Your tender smile catches my breath
how can I go on without it

The moment thenâ¦
There is nothing worthwhile anymore

Your eyes swallow the light

The ship has sailed
you have breathed your last

All these roads we walked together
all these memories will never fade

So light you lie in my arms
that the burden has been lifted from you
