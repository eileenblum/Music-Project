Beneath Vesiviusâ watchful eye
lies our city of might and glory
the bright light of Pompeii
it will shine eternally

Temples of wisdom
blazing in the morning sun
lush wines and olives lines
A life so pure!

Felix hic locus est!
Felix hic locus est!

The theaters and stone clad streets
endless nights of sin
Sculptures of the mighty gods
Temple walls â where the truth lies withinâ¦ lies within

Temples of wisdom
blazing in the morning sun
lush wines and olives lines
A life so pure!

Felix hic locus est!
Felix hic locus est!

An ashen cloud
shrouds the breathless crowd
as the grey snow falls
the grey snow covers it all
with its dying dew*

Surrounded by death.
Bitternessâ¦
All the gloryâ¦
Consumed by volcano

The august dream is gone forever!
The august dream is gone forever!

[inspired by Judith Nicholls â Pompeii]
