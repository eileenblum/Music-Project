I ride the whore
Pure nocturnal Rome
my destiny

I drift away, far away
from light to unknown places

Fraught with energy
Pure nocturnal Rome
I lose reality

Winds carrying screams from the Palatine
Like words of wisdom and fatality
Real or not, this becomes the essence of the manifest

I ride the whore
Pure nocturnal Rome
my destiny

Entering the place of sacrifices
where blood bleached its way of awe
nourishing the gods of war

I walk away, far away
Through the night and mystic places
