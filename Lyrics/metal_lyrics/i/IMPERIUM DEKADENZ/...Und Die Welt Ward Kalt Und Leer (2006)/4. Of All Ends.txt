Blood red signs
Written in the color of life
Composed by the damned
Telling from the end
The end of all ends

Freezing human skin
Burning arrogance
Breaking bones
In endless torment
The end of all ends

Don't cry

Eternal pain for eternal disgrace
Termination of the whole breed

Sacrifice your gods
Hope dies at last

Hear the voice of death
Hear the voice of death
