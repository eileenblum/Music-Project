Under the pillars of flesh
Where the hopeless yell
Stinks the taste of death
Blowing winds of lust

Yell their pain
Yell their lust
Breathe their greed
Into death they must
The halls of lust

Bloody cuts mark their skin
Pale faces sneer
Crying empty eyes
Into the final ride

Lost their faith
Lost their sin
Hope for death
That gloomy grim
The halls of lust

Yell their pain
Yell their lust
Breathe their greed
Into death they must
The halls of lust

When the night falls
Darkness cloaks this gallery of cruelties
Freezing fog covers their tortured bodies
Oh...this endless winter night
Offers depressive silence
Awaiting the first light
To begin and pump their blood
Into their rotten veins

Fill the halls with lust
Flee from the night's frost
Let the filthy blood flow
Make the painful final cut

Yell their pain, yell their lust
Breathe their greed
Into death they must
The halls of lust

Lost their faith, lost their sin
Hope for death
That gloomy grim
The halls of lust
