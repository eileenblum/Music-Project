Far beyond the mist
I chase the spirit
Of times forgotten

Follow me... Into the night
Walk the path of mystery

Years of oppression,
Didn't make me weak willed
I will stand
Firm in my beliefs

Follow me... and we will reign
Pass the gate to immortality

Obsessed... by the absolute truth
I remigrate into the night
Guided by a million moons

Guided by a million moons

Far beyond the mist
I chase the spirit
Of times forgotten

Follow me... Into the night
Walk the path of mystery

Obsessed... by the absolute truth
I remigrate into the night
Guided by a million moons
