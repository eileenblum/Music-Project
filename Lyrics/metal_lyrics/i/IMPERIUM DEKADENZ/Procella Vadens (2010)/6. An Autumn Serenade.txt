The mysteries of this season
With it's dark essence
Send me to a journey
...after evenfall

Sometimes,
When I walk through the woods
I am searching...
...for the harboured truth

Leaves of rust and scarlet
Reveal the key of destiny

Images of transience
Before the vigilant eyes

Withered trees, afflicted souls
Dead leaves - lost dreams

Sometimes,
When I walk through the woods
I am searching...
...for the harboured truth
