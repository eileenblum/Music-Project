Guided by the shores of death
Lost in reverie
A dark tempest prevails
The taste of freedom

Lingering among the shadows
I seek for eternal freedom

Ocean
Mountains mirror,
Refusing times ravage,
Without form and void

Flashing images from the past
A call from the distance
I seize the quintessence,
As he draws me into his depths

Beyond the fall of the night
I found my path of redemption

Ocean
Mountains mirror,
Refusing times ravage,
Without form and void
