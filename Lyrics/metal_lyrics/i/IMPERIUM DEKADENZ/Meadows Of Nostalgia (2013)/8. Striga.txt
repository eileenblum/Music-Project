[Lyrics by Vespasian]

Deep in the black forest
Obscure retreatfor the wise
I felt this cold embrace
A magic spell enchanted the night

Striga â Striga â Heresy!

You knew the ways of old
You could see beyond the barriers
You always followed the moon
You acknowledged the truth

Eradication and Misery
Judged in a religious ecstasy

Malevolent enemy of the church
Burn in autumnal fires

Deep in the black forest
Obscure retreat for the wise
I felt this cold embr embrace
A magic spell enchanted the night

Striga â Striga â Heresy!

You knew the ways of old
You could see beyond the barriers
You always followed the moon
You acknowledged the truth
