[Lyrics by Vespasian]

Danubius rages through the land
Cutting the earth with its mighty hand
Digging mountains across the face of time
Revealing a land that is intertwined

Stream of passion
Danuviusâ pride
Source of enlightenment
My guidance at night
â¦Take me home

Ave Danuvi. Viam nobis monstras!

As I walk through vales and fields
Your silver stream leads my way

Through lands it guides
Walks and runs, Carries its secrets
Into the black sea

Stream of passion
Danuviusâ pride
Source of enlightenment
My guidance at night
â¦Take me home

Ave Danuvi. Viam nobis monstras!

As I walk through vales and fields
Your silver stream leads my way

[Inspired by L. T. Padgett]
