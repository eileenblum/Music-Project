Waiting in the darkness
Waiting for your soul
Time to pay the price
The price of blood
Don't try to hide away
cause the only place to stay
is deep down in the dirt
That's the price of blood

It's growing stronger every day
The bad conscience in his head
Never thought it would be like this
The pain is tearing him apart
Just a little stupid mistake
turned out to be a nightmare for life
Now he's the one who's suffering
The Devil is waiting right behind

Hunted by the memories from the past
Horror visions of the bodies he once smashed

Waiting in the darkness
Waiting for your soul
Time to pay the price
The price of blood
Don't try to hide away
cause the only place to stay
is deep down in the dirt
That's the price of blood

Time is running out
Now will he be free at last
from this terrorising hell
he's been trapped in for so long
A trip to the other side
to the world deep below
Now will he ever find some peace
or will his soul forever burn

Hunted by his memories from the past
Horror visions of the bodies he once smashed

Waiting in the darkness
Waiting for your soul
Time to pay the price
The price of blood
Don't try to hide away
cause the only place to stay
is deep down in the dirt
That's the price of blood

Waiting in the darkness
Waiting for your soul
Time to pay the price
The price of blood
Don't try to hide away
cause the only place to stay
is deep down in the dirt
That's the price of blood
