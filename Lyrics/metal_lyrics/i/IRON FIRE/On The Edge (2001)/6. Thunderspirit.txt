You've got to look deep inside
and let your inner demons out
Don't be afraid of what you see
in the mirror of your soul

The only dream I've ever known
Slowly fading away
Dark horizons are closing in
It's time for the Gathering

Follow the forest
The Moon will guide the way
Through the darkness
Through the Gate of Eternity

Thunderspirit, ride with me
Rise up from the grave
Thunderspirit, set me free
Show the way to the kingdom of the brave

Here I stand all alone
and I don't know which way to go
But somehow I will arise 
on Resurrection Day

Follow your heart
Spirit and might in the name of Victory
Bring me hope to carry on
O, mighty Thunderlord

Follow the forest
The Moon will guide the way
Through the darkness
Through the Gate of Eternity

Thunderspirit, ride with me
Rise up from the grave
Thunderspirit, set me free
Show the way to the Kingdom of the Brave

Thunderspirit, ride with me
Rise up from the grave
Thunderspirit, set me free
Show the way to the Kingdom of the Brave
