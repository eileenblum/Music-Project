Standing on the edge, and I'm looking down
Into the darkness, everywhere and all around
I see people fall and lose their grounds
Another war and another thousand deaths
Everyday the streets are painted red
So many homeless without a bed

I can't believe it's true
The end for me and you
O, Lord please tell me what to do

We are facing the final hour
The end of the suffering
The last page of the final chapter
You see the world fade away
Mother Earth has been torn apart
Not even God can save us now
But we are the children of the night
So hang on tight
Cause we are falling
into the abyss

Schoolchildren shoot and kill just for fun
Young kids feel unsecure without a gun
You take your aim and then you try to run
Unstable psycho high on dope
pulls the trigger and then he uses the rope
Lost in a freak show without a hope

I can't believe it's true
The end for me and you
O, Lord please tell me what to do

We are facing the final hour
The end of the suffering
The last page of the final chapter
You see the world fade away
Mother Earth has been torn apart
Not even God can save us now
But we are the children of the night
So hang on tight
Cause we are falling 
into the abyss

We are facing the final hour
The end of the suffering
The last page of the final chapter
You see the world fade away
Mother Earth has been torn apart
Not even God can save us now
But we are the children of the night
So hang on tight
Cause we are falling 
into the abyss
