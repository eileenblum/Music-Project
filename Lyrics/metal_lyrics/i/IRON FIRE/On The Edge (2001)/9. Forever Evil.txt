Come take my hand
and leave the past behind
The Armies of Evil await
You were betrayed
Now, take your revenge
And strike them down with your hate

From the grave you will arise
reborn with sinister eyes
See them suffer, see them burn
Now there is no return

Forever evil
In darkness we ride 
Forever Evil 
In Hell we unite
Forever Evil
No turning back
Forever Evil
The Devil in black

Disciples of death
Are sent to destroy
And bring souls down here to me
I will show you the world
Deep down below
I promise you will be free

From the grave you will arise
reborn with sinister eyes
See them suffer, see them burn
Now there is no return

Forever Evil
In darkness we ride 
Forever Evil
In Hell we unite
Forever Evil
No turning back
Forever Evil
The Devil in black

Forever Evil
In darkness we ride 
Forever Evil
In Hell we unite
Forever Evil
No turning back
Forever Evil
The Devil in black
