Rising up from the ashes
The ashes of the past
Out of a fairytale he comes
The Prince of Darkness
He has returned
to make all your wishes come true

He's watching you everywhere you go
The master from deep below

Prince of Agony
Coming from the underworld
Prince of Agony
Possessing your soul
Prince of Agony
In your darkest dream
Prince of Agony
He will make you scream

Collecting souls
in a magic stone
Cause he holds the power of the world
So be aware
the black sorcerer 
He's waiting for you in the shadows

He's watching you everywhere you go
The master from deep below

Prince of Agony
Coming from the underworld
Prince of Agony
Possessing your soul
Prince of Agony
In your darkest dream
Prince of Agony
He will make you scream

He's watching you everywhere you go
The master from deep below

Prince of Agony
Coming from the underworld
Prince of Agony
Possessing your soul
Prince of Agony
In your darkest dream
Prince of Agony
He will make you scream
On The Edge

I've got a monkey on my back
and my soul feels like a wreck
Screaming voices in my head
Sometimes I wish that I was dead

Flying so high
into a toxic sky
On a trip to Hell
To the sound of the judgement bell

Still on the edge
of another breakdown
Alone in the dark
I'm lost in a dream
Still on the edge
of another shakedown
Facing destruction
with one foot in the grave

With a blade against my wrist
In this world that makes me so pissed
I was a master, I was a king
Now my angel's got a broken wing

Flying so high
into a toxic sky
On a trip to Hell
To the sound of the judgement bell

Still on the edge
of another breakdown
Alone in the dark
I'm lost in a dream
Still on the edge
of another shakedown
Facing destruction
with one foot in the grave

Still on the edge
of another breakdown
Alone in the dark
I'm lost in a dream
Still on the edge
of another shakedown
Facing destruction
with one foot in the grave
