Stars are shining in the night
The ancient sky shines so bright
Will I find eternity
Find the way to my destiny
I'm not a mystery, or a wicked man
To tell you the truth I don't give a damn
Cause I'm the one, I will be strong
Show them all that they are wrong

I will search until I reach my destination
On a ride to the final station

Here and alive, here and alive
I was born to survive
Cause I'm here and alive, here and alive
No time to say goodbye
I'm here and alive

Unchained I will arise
Embraced by the holy skies
I will make them pray
Never will I fade to grey

I will search until I reach my destination
On a ride to the final station

Here and alive, here and alive
I was born to survive
Cause I'm here and alive, here and alive
No time to say goodbye
I'm here and alive

Here and alive, here and alive
I was born to survive
Cause I'm here and alive, here and alive
No time to say goodbye
I'm here and alive
Miracle

The preacher once said
we have to open up our eyes
find a way, make all realize
the end is near so tie the rope
we need a miracle, it's our only hope

But I believe that there still is a little time
for us to change before the world turns to dust

We need a miracle
to save us all from judgement day
A miracle we need
I still believe in a miracle
The time has come for us to pray
for a miracle

The writings on the wall
and the ancient prophecies
tell us the story of a destiny
Every man has to pay for his sins
Say goodnight before the nightmare begins

But I believe that there still is a little time
for us to change before the world turns to dust

We need a miracle
to save us all from judgement day
A miracle we need
I still believe in a miracle
The time has come for us to pray
for a miracle

We need a miracle
to save us all from judgement day
A miracle we need
I still believe in a miracle
The time has come for us to pray
for a miracle
