Sitting here just a lonely man on my bed
I just can't get you out of my head
Sometimes it feels like I'm living in a dream
and the world just can't understand what I mean

Take me far away
Take me today

I'm lost in loneliness
I feel so cold
I'm lost in emptiness
I need somebody to hold
Cause I'm lost; that's what I am
I'm just a lonely man
Who's lost n' alone

With a little hope and my guitar
I'm wondering how I made it so far
Cause without your love, I'm just hanging on
to the only dream I've got, now you're gone 

Take me far away
Take me today

I'm lost in loneliness
I feel so cold
I'm lost in emptiness
I need somebody to hold
Cause I'm lost; that's what I am
I'm just a lonely man
Who's lost n' alone

Take me far away
Take me today

I'm lost in loneliness
I feel so cold
I'm lost in emptiness
I need somebody to hold
Cause I'm lost; that's what I am
I'm just a lonely man
Who's lost n' alone
