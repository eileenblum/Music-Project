[Lyrics: Martin Steene, Music: Kirk Backarach]

Out of the dungeon comes the beast
the jaws of death are bloody and ready to feast
it takes a hero to hold the crown
and beat the enemy down
the lord of the darkness has returned
crushing sculls and all the innocent will burn
it's a path for the wicked one
blood will run

Down from the sky evil never sleeps
it never dies and the gate that leads
to the kingdoms of hell

Doom riders, dark fighters
doom riders, the evil eye
doom riders, dark fighters
doom riders, the evil eyes is watching you

From the dark side of the mind
from deep within all evil can be found
it's a choice between good and bad
that we all must take
behind the mirror lies the key
the reflection might not be what you want to see
the devil comes for the weak
and lost souls will break down

Down from the sky evil never sleeps
it never dies and the gate that leads
to the kingdoms of hell

Doom riders, dark fighters
doom riders, the evil eye
doom riders, dark fighters
doom riders, the evil eyes is watching you

Death in the morning
we try to hold them back
hell is calling
in this final attack
they break the alliance
and the end is near
we are forced in defence
the afterlife we don't fear

Doom riders, dark fighters
doom riders, the evil eye
doom riders, dark fighters
doom riders, the evil eye
doom riders, dark fighters
doom riders, the evil eyes is watching you
