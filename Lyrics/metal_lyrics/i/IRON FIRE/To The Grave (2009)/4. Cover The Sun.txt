[Lyrics: Martin Steene, Music: Kirk Backarach]

Brothers are shaking
it's my awakening
my head is spinning around
they will hit the ground the hammer will pound
my brothers are fighting
the keep we're defending
the battle is bloody red
my mind is set the steel they will get

Pain is my friend from heaven I descend
I feel the power embracing me

Legions are falling
when death comes crawling
my god is calling
blood will run
cover the sun

My enemies are dying
the women are crying
the blade is going in
it's not a sin I know we will win
it's time for the gathering
today the dead will sing
arrows are coming down
will we die when they hit the ground

Pain is my friend from heaven I descend
I feel the power embracing me

Legions are falling
when death comes crawling
my god is calling
blood will run
cover the sun

Strike down the unbelievers
tonight they'll be deceivers
of the curse of the dark empire of the undead

Pain is my friend from heaven I descend
I feel the power embracing me

Legions are falling
when death comes crawling
my god is calling
blood will run
cover the sun

We cover the sun
And the blood will run
We cover the sun
