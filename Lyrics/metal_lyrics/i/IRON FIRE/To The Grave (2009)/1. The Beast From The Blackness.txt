[Lyrics &amp; Music: Martin Steene]

Fear the black from the void
feels like it's consuming me
taste the blood from the beast
from deep beyond
look into the eyes of black
but I'll still carry on
in the forest of the damned
I will find the key

Where is the answer
in all this madness
all I see now is the dark path

Fight fight, fighting the darkness
fight fight from deep within
fight fight, fighting the darkness
from beyond
comes the beast from the blackness

Feel the heat from the abyss
that slowly drags me in
at the gates of my doom
show me the light
the underworld calls my name
the voices are closing in
on the edge of the thunderstorm
I will find the truth

Where is the answer
in all this madness
all I see now is the dark path

Fight fight, fighting the darkness
fight fight from deep within
fight fight, fighting the darkness
from beyond
comes the beast from the blackness

See the shadows I see them dancing on the wall
Feel the presence of an evil spirit all around
I'm losing ground

Invictus ira dominus
SÃ¤nctus deus lutulentus
intus lupus ascendo

Fight fight fighting the darkness
fight fight from deep within
Fight fight fighting the darkness
from beyond
comes the beast from the blackness
