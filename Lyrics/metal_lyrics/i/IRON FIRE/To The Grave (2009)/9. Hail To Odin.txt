[Lyrics &amp; Music: Martin Steene]

From the shores of the sea
we come not as friends but as enemies
guided by the north star
warriors side by side we travel far

Over mountains covered by snow
protected by Odin everywhere we go
come as shadows in the night
but soon the steel will shine so bright

At dawn the slaughter will begin
the mighty northern beast
burning corpses and drinking blood
this battle we will win

Hail hail, hail to Odin
Hail hail we keep on fighting
in thunder and lightning
hail hail, hail to Odin
hail hail we keep on fighting
hail hail, hail to Odin
with thunder and lightning
comes the last Viking

Scull crashing maniacs
the blood and gore will cover all the tracks
vanish like ghost in black
the legion of butchers will soon be back

At dawn the slaughter will begin
the mighty northern beast
burning corpses and drinking blood
this battle we will win

Hail hail, hail to Odin
hail hail we keep on fighting
in thunder and lightning
hail hail, hail to Odin
hail hail we keep on fighting
hail hail, hail to Odin
with thunder and lightning
comes the last Viking

When the eagles fly and a brother die
We'll meet again in Valhalla
the hall of the brave will be our grave
we all unite with the gods of war

Smashing the sculls of all enemies
we are not afraid of anything
breaking their bones burning all down
in the end I hold the crown

I hold the crown

At dawn the slaughter will begin
the mighty northern beast
burning corpses and drinking blood
this battle we will win

Hail hail, hail to Odin
hail hail we keep on fighting
in thunder and lightning
hail hail, hail to Odin
hail hail we keep on fighting
hail hail, hail to Odin
with thunder and lightning
comes the last viking

Father Odin

Hail to Odin
