[Lyrics: Martin Steene, Music: Kirk Backarach]

Under the ice it's been asleep
in the frozen snow so deep
from the kingdom of the dead
the arise will come at sunset

The storm will come like fire (burn the liar)
from deep below rising higher
it's the awakening

Frozen in time (pure evil)
frozen in time, the dark warrior
frozen in time (pure evil)
frozen in time the master of doom
has been frozen in time

You can feel it coming near
the bringer of death and fear
the darkness is closing in
and soon the final war will begin

The storm will come like fire (burn the liar)
from deep below rising higher
it's the awakening

Frozen in time (pure evil)
frozen in time, the dark warrior
frozen in time (pure evil)
frozen in time the master of doom
has been frozen in time

The master of doom
has been frozen in time

Lost in the void many years ago
trapped under ancient ice and snow
the beast is lose again
the wrath from beyond
like a plague his anger will destroy

The storm will come like fire (burn the liar)
from deep below rising higher
it's the awakening

Frozen in time (pure evil)
frozen in time, the dark warrior
frozen in time (pure evil)
frozen in time the master of doom
has been frozen in time
