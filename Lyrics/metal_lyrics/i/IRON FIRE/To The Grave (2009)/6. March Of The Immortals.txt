[Lyrics &amp; Music: Martin Steene]

We wait till dawn before the big attack
and we show them what steel can do
we hit them hard and strike them back
and let the hammer fall for you
we're not afraid of death in the field
the mighty Odin watching over us
with flags held high blood on shields
we burn the holy cross

Show no mercy at all
We'll fight until we fall
today we march for victory

March of the immortals
this is the final stand
march of the immortals
blood brothers take my hand
march of the immortals
this is the final stand
march of the immortals
blood brothers take my hand
and fight
fight till the last man

We take the land and strike with thunder force
true warriors ride side by side
brave crusaders never ending wars
into battle into hell we ride
this is the day that we've been waiting for
we hold the line until the end
a thousand men will hear the thunder roar
the metal heart we will defend

Show no mercy at all
We'll fight until we fall
today we march in victory

March of the immortals
this is the final stand
march of the immortals
blood brothers take my hand
march of the immortals
this is the final stand
march of the immortals
blood brothers take my hand
and fight
fight till the last man

We never surrender
