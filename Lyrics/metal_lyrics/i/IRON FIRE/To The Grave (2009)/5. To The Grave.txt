[Lyrics &amp; Music: Martin Steene]

From the black abyss to the battlefield
we fly on eagle wings
forced again to hold the line
together we stand as kings
brave at heart we raise the flag
in thunder wind and rain
the brotherhood will unite
as warriors we show no pain

We are coming home
lost souls to save

To the grave
riders of Armageddon
to the grave
the legion of the dead
to the grave
blood brothers of damnation
warriors to the grave

Return with steel to the glory days
the flame will never die
the iron head and the warriors
will rise to the battle cry
from the mountainside to the seven seas
metal will shake the ground
all for one we will make a stand
the drums of doom will pound

We are coming home
lost souls to save

To the grave
riders of Armageddon
to the grave
the legion of the dead
to the grave
blood brothers of damnation
warriors to the grave

I see the sign from the divine
no one will walk alone
I've seen the vision
with my own eyes
the path lies ahead and I follow

We are coming home
lost souls to save

To the grave
riders of Armageddon
to the grave
the legion of the dead
to the grave
blood brothers of damnation
warriors to the grave
