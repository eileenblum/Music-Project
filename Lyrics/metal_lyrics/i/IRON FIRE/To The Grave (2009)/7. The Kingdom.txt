[Lyrics &amp; Music: Martin Steene]

One holy night long time ago
when the gods hammered the gates
but the price still remain the same
a thousand knights will fall
now the time has come to make a stand
and break the walls of sin
the enemies will become our friends
and glory will arise

Once again we ride side by side
and once again we need them eye to eye

The Kingdom is mine
in darkness we will find
the kingdom is mine
in hell we will dine
the kingdom is mine
forever we hold the line
the kingdom is mine
divine and the kingdom is mine

The kingdom is mine

The legacy of the great old king
lives on within these troops
across the plains through the northern lands
we ride to victory

Once again we ride side by side
and once again we'll meet them eye to eye

The Kingdom is mine
in darkness we will find
the kingdom is mine
in hell we will dine
the kingdom is mine
forever we hold the line
the kingdom is mine
divine and the kingdom is mine

The kingdom is mine

Forever we hold the line

We come alive we ride tonight
the crusade that never ends
the brotherhood and the crown
forever we will defend

Once again we ride side by side
and once again we'll meet them eye to eye

The Kingdom is mine
in darkness we will find
the kingdom is mine
in hell we will dine
the kingdom is mine
forever we hold the line
the kingdom is mine
divine
the kingdom is mine
in darkness we find

We still hold the line
and the kingdom is mine
