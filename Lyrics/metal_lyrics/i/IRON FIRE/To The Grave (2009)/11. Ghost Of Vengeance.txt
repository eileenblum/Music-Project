[Lyrics &amp; Music: Martin Steene]

I've been through hell and back
I feel the time attack
but I still carry on the dream
I fight the mighty beast
from deep within released
but in the dark I still scream

I take control I try to ease the pain
but everything is in vain
the mirror of my soul is fading out

I am the ghost, ghost of vengeance
bringing me down
ghost, the ghost of vengeance
I am the ghost, the ghost of vengeance
bringing me down
ghost, the ghost of vengeance
I am the ghost

I see with different eyes
I pull off all the lies
still I try to run away from myself
I play along to please
it is a deadly disease
once again the clock strikes twelve

I take control I try to ease the pain
but everything is in vain
the mirror of my soul is fading out

I am the ghost, ghost of vengeance
bringing me down
ghost, the ghost of vengeance
I am the ghost, the ghost of vengeance
bringing me down
ghost, the ghost of vengeance
I am the ghost

All the lies I tell myself every day
it has taken me straight to hell
I know the truth but it's killing me
I will not face reality

I take control I try to ease the pain
but everything is in vain
the mirror of my soul is fading out

I am the ghost, ghost of vengeance
bringing me down
Ghost, the ghost of vengeance
I am the ghost, the ghost of vengeance
bringing me down
ghost, the ghost of vengeance
I am the ghost
