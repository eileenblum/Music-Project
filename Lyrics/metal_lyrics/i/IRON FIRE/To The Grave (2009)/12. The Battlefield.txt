[Lyrics: Martin Steene, Music: Kirk Backarach]

We'll make them burn and bleed
and won't accept defeat
when sunrise come
we will charge with magic force
no matter what we meet
there's nothing we can't beat
unholy giants will fall down
by the mighty blade

But tonight we hold our women tight
we light a fire and share tales about how
we will fight

In the battlefield
we bleed
in the battlefield
it's death on repeat
in the battlefield
we die
in the battlefield
we say goodbye

This time we won't retreat
we all will face the heat
when the dying day comes for us
we will stand up straight
in the mists we rise
as our brothers die
this is the place where we will meet our final fate

But tonight we hold our women tight
we light a fire and share tales about how
we will fight

In the battlefield
we bleed
in the battlefield
it's death on repeat
in the battlefield
we die
in the battlefield
we say goodbye

In the battlefield
we die
we will make them pay
and they will bleed tonight
the victory of the bloody sword

But tonight we hold our women tight
we light a fire and share tales about how
we will fight

In the battlefield
we bleed
in the battlefield
it's death on repeat
in the battlefield
we die
in the battlefield
we say goodbye

In the battlefield
it's death in repeat
in the battlefield

Death, death, death on repeat!
