[Lyrics: Martin Steene, Music: Kirk Backarach]

In the darkest night
across the northern land
into the morning light
riders approaching
in death or victory
destruction is at hand
the truth or fantasy
the armies are marching

Standing face to face
in the battlefield
this is the gathering of evil

Demon master
towards hells gate we ride
the demon master
today there'll be no light
the demon master

It might be the grave or the path to hell
a true king or slave time will tell
I will taste the blood from my brother's blade
guilty flesh will rot on the final crusade

Standing face to face
in the battlefield
this is the gathering of evil

Demon master
towards hells gate we ride
the demon master
today there'll be no light
the demon master

Come to me my little friend
and I'll show what hell is like

Come take my hand, come take my hand
together we'll ride through the darkest land
come take my hand
together we'll ride through darkness
tonight

Demon master
towards hells gate we ride
the demon master
today there'll be no light
the demon master
