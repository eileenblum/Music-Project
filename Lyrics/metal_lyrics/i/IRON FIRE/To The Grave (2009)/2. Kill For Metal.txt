[Lyrics &amp; Music: Martin Steene]

Back in time before time
the chosen one made the steel of blood and glory
out of the flames came a new king
and today the gathering will stand
in the battle of the brave
who will be the new gods of metal

We'll take them one on one
the war has just begun
and we'll fight them side by side
there is no place to hide
it's a journey for the brave
I'm master, no slave
we come out from the dark
and relight the metal spark

Let's ride together and strike them down with force

The last metal troops will rise
born in the fire we meet them eye to eye
the last metal troops will rise
born in the fire we meet them eye to eye
and kill for metal

We kill for metal

Our steel is unbreakable
the king is untouchable
the blade is bloody red
a true metal head
we cannot feel the pain
tonight we go insane
it's the savage prophecy
we'll break the enemy

Let's ride together and strike them down with force

The last metal troops will rise
born in the fire we meet them eye to eye
the last metal troops will rise
born in the fire we meet them eye to eye
and kill for metal

It's here to blow my mind
like a beast from behind
I feel the tension in my body and my bones
I've been here for many years
it has brought me many tears
but I can't turn my back on
what I am

Metal man I am

Let's ride together and strike them down with force

The last metal troops will rise
born in the fire we meet them eye to eye
the last metal troops will rise
born in the fire we meet them eye to eye

Metal metal
we take them one by one

Metal metal
the war has just begun

Metal metal
it's a journey for the brave

Metal metal
we come out from the dark
and kill for metal
