[Lyrics &amp; Music by: Martin Steene]

I canât ï¬nd home
I donât know my name
I donât know the number
Where do I go
When nothing seems to make sense at all
Close to break down
Tell me what is going on
I lost my crown
Give me a reason for a new dawn

What is the mission for me now
Tell me master tell me how
Is this the ï¬nal call
In the dust I crawl
Approaching mechanical break down

My awakening
Turn on the light
And bring me back again
The voices from within
Can this be right
My satellite or my awakening
(My awakening)

I donât recall my past
The memories have disappeared
Where or what I was
The place where I belong is lost
A race from deep within
I need to ï¬nd the answer
A place of deadly sin
In this hell I ï¬ght the cancer

What is the mission for me now
Tell me master tell me how
Is this the ï¬nal call
In the dust I crawl
Approaching mechanical break down

My awakening
Turn on the light
And bring me back again
The voices from within
Can this be right
My satellite or my awakening
