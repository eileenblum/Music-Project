Creeping and crawling up from behind
When you turn thereâs nothing to ï¬nd
Feels like something
Breathe down your neck
Itâs scary and it makes me sick
A creature coming from down below
So deep where no one dares to go
Step higher on the food chain
Welcome to the house of pain

Coming with speed out of the night
Sent to bring you hell
Who will be next no one can tell

The creeper is here
To spread fear
Beating you down in the dust
The creeper is back to attack
Hundreds of bodies been crushed
Itâs feeding time
And youâre the chosen victim
In the phantom symphony

Soon youâll be under the blade
Your life will slowly fade
Collecting bones and human skin
Now let the blood bath begin
All alone in the killing road
Break your hope
And slice your throat
Get ready for another shock
Out of the dark comes a truck

Coming with speed out of the night
Sent to bring you hell
Who will be next no one can tell

The creeper is here
To spread fear
Beating you down in the dust
The creeper is back to attack
Hundreds of bodies been crushed
Itâs feeding time
And youâre the chosen victim
In the phantom symphony

Up from the abyss
You get the devils kiss
A love story for the maniacs
Coming from the deep
Where evil never sleeps
666
Raise the funeral ï¬ag

Rise up from hell

Are you ready for the end my friend
Are you ready for the ï¬nal embrace
You are the chosen one
Descending to the lowest level
Pain is coming today
Chain you in the darkest chamber
Destination heaven or hell
This train is only going down

Symphony of the damned I am

The creeper is here
To spread fear
Beating you down in the dust
The creeper is back to attack
(Coming for you)
