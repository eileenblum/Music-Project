Annihilation of the human race
A quest of rage
The fall of freedom
Conspiracy till the end of days
In the palace of doom
A child will be born

Among the wolves chaos will rise
Deep in the forest
Under the full moon
The son of destruction
King of the night
Gather the troops
For the ï¬nal attack

The coming of hate and violence
No such thing as innocence
Slay all the guilty ones

Legions of the underworld
Obey the words carved in stone
Legions of the underworld
The chosen one will conquer the throne
Tyranny for eternity

Show your face behind the mask
Betrayers will die
No one will remain
True disciples of the underworld
Like predators
They hunt in the name of the dead

The coming of hate and violence
No such thing as innocence
Slay all the guilty ones

Legions of the underworld
Obey the words carved in stone
Legions of the underworld
The chosen one will conquer the throne
