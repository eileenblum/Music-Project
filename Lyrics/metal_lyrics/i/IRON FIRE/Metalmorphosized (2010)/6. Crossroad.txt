Had it all planned
We were meant to be
Slowly sinking in the sand
Unable to feel free
Misguided hearts
Lost in illusions together
Assigned from the gods
With blinded eyes
Love dies

Standing at the crossroad
I donât know where to turn
Standing at the crossroad
I know my soul will forever burn
Iâm the guilty one
Yes I know

Had to let it go
The rope around my neck
No one will ever know
How sanity turned sick
I left you behind
In the shadows of my mind
Now is up to you to ï¬nd
Another door
That will bring you more

Standing at the crossroad
I donât know where to turn
Standing at the crossroad
I know my soul will forever burn
Iâm the guilty one
Yes I know

Itâs alright to be afraid
Itâs alright youâre feeling hate
When luck has turned you down
Itâs okay to crash and burn
Thereâs no way weâll ever learn
To understand the meaning of it all
