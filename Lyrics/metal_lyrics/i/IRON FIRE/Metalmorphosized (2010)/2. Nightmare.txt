[Lyrics &amp; Music by: Martin Steene]
[Feat. Gunnar Olsen on Drums]

I wanna wake but my eyes are closed
In the darkness comes a ghost
I wanna run but thereâs no place to go
Isolated in a horrow show
When Iâm asleep they torture me
Fills my soul with misery
Bloody madness in my mind
There is no open door to ï¬nd

In the nightmare
Thereâs a house on the hill
In the nightmare
Another wolf to kill
In the nightmare
Blood stains on the wall
In the nightmare
When midnight comes
Lost souls will burn

Start to dream
And all hell breaks loose
This time I cannot choose
Coming for me heâs coming for you
In this world there is nothing we can do
In the kingdom of the damned
A nightmare Iâll never understand
Mr. Sandman please set me free
Moonlight is my enemy

In the nightmare
Thereâs a house on the hill
In the nightmare
Another wolf to kill
In the nightmare
Blood stains on the wall
In the nightmare
When midnight comes
Lost souls will burn

We burn

We claim the night and your soul
(And the nightmare)
There is no light only the cold
In the nightmare

In the nightmare
Thereâs a house on the hill
In the nightmare
Another wolf to kill
In the nightmare
Blood stains on the wall
In the nightmare
When midnight comes
Lost souls will burn
