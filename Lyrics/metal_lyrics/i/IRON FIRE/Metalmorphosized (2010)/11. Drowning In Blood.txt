[Lyrics &amp; Music by: Martin Steene]
[Feat. Morten Plenge on Drums]

World empires are burning down
Is this the end of the beginning
Hatred chaos and aggression
The choice is yours live or die

Planet hate
Planet pain
Planet death
So many lies
So many die, die on planet death
Cause weâre drowning in blood
No one cares anymore
Drowning in blood
Fighting another holy war

Cause weâre
Drowning in blood
The world is not like before
Drowning in blood
Chaos and hatred forever more
Cause weâre drowning in blood

The abyss is waiting for you and me
In the grave weâll be free
From suffering and suicide
Where are you God
Lord of lies

Planet hate
Planet pain
Planet death
So many lies
So many die, die on planet death
Cause weâre drowning in blood
No one cares anymore
Drowning in blood
Fighting another holy war

Cause weâre
Drowning in blood
The world is not like before
Drowning in blood
Chaos and hatred forever more
Cause weâre drowning in blood

Religious warfare everyday
Be prepared for the gathering
Bullets ï¬y
And soon youâll die
Donât you understand God is dead
