[Lyrics &amp; Music by: Martin Steene]
[Feat. Kristian "Iver" Iversen on Guitar]

Iâm screaming
Iâm dreaming
I am the cold wind in your face
Iâm freak show
I am John Doe
You know my name is disgrace

Master of the twilight world
King of the kill
Rage from the black abyss
Up from the crypt
Now arise

I am the one
The long lost soul
Now I awake
The wolf inside of me
I am the one
The long lost soul
Trapped in the dark with only desperation
Once again Iâm here
Back in the pit

I bring sadness
I bring madness
A lost soul that will never rest in peace
Iâm the shadow
The black widow
Misery and death is my disease

Master of the twilight world
King of the kill
Rage from the black abyss
Up from the crypt
Now arise

I am the one
The long lost soul
Now I awake
The wolf inside of me
I am the one
The long lost soul
Trapped in the dark with only desperation
Once again Iâm here
Back in the pit
I bring the sadness I bring the madness to you
I bring you down on your knees

I am the one
The long lost soul
Now I awake
The wolf inside of me
I am the one
The long lost soul
Trapped in the dark with only desperation

I am the one
Your darkest nightmare
