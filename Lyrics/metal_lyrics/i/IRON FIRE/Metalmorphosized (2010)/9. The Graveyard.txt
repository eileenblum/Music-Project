[Lyrics &amp; Music by: Martin Steene]
[Feat. Jakob Lykkebo on Bass]

I am an unbeliever
I follow the winds of ï¬re
Donât try to change my ways
Cause my home is in hell
Thereâs no guardian angel
Watching over me
Guided by the will
And the dream of revolution

Some day the raven will appear
Nothing to change
Nothing to fear
We all walk through the

Gates of the graveyard
Itâs where I lay my soul to rest
Gates of the graveyard
I am the uninvited guest
Gates of the graveyard
My private paradise
Gates of the graveyard
Into the dark
And into the grave

I was born a thunder child
Wild blood is in my veins
Get ready to face the demon
That lives inside my soul
When I grow old
I will have no regrets
Cause Iâm unbreakable
Almost invincible

Some day the raven will appear
Nothing to change
Nothing to fear
We all walk through the

Gates of the graveyard
Itâs where I lay my soul to rest
Gates of the graveyard
I am the uninvited guest
Gates of the graveyard
My private paradise
Gates of the graveyard
Into the dark
And into the grave
