[Lyrics &amp; Music by: Martin Steene]

You left me here alone
I walk into the darkness
My heart was turned to stone
Dwelling in madness
You turned your back to me
Now thereâs only dead voices
I was too blind to see
Show your ugly faces

For all those years of trust
Thereâs only one to blame
Memories will never rust
Feeding the ï¬ame

Left for dead
Six feet down in the dirt
Dust from the burning
Ashes to ashes
Left for dead

Empires are falling down
The castle is torn to debris
The king has lost his crown
Thereâs nothing left of me
Drowning in emptiness
I walk the path of ï¬re
My name is empty space
As the ï¬ames go higher

For all those years of trust
Thereâs only one to blame
Memories will never rust
Feeding the ï¬ame
(Iâm glowing red)

Left for dead
Six feet down in the dirt
Dust from the burning
Ashes to ashes
Left for dead

You brought me down into the ï¬ames of hell
