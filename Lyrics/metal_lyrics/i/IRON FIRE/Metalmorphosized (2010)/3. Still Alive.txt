[Lyrics by: Martin Steene]
[Music by: Kirk Backarach]

This is for freedom
This is for those who care
I got my reason
No more in despair
We stand united
This is decided
The hand of fury
Youâre all invited

I crawl out of this nightmare
Out of the shadows
I walk into the devil's lair
My life
My path
Is where faith grows

Cause Iâm still alive
Feed the ï¬re inside
Iâm
Iâm still alive
The fuel
The ï¬ame
Will ignite

This is the threshold
This is the quickening
No more rampage
In the battle ring
Fight for independence
For what you believe
The right to stand out
The glory to receive

I crawl out of this nightmare
Out of the shadows
I walk into the devil's lair
My life
My path
Is where faith grows

Cause Iâm still alive
Feed the ï¬re inside
Iâm
Iâm still alive
The fuel
The ï¬ame
Will ignite

Take now what Iâve learned from
All these years of agony
And bring it
Take now
What Iâve learned from all these years of agony
And bring it to you

Bring it here tonight
