[Lyrics &amp; Music by: Martin Steene]
[Feat. Kristian Hegelund Martinsen on Guitar]

The candle is burning out
My life is near the end
I will leave this earth
And enter the underworld
Years of suffering
Days of misery
God took everything
Now feel my rage upon you

Legions of thunder
Let the crusade begin
We are many
Born in sin
Come on in

Reborn to darkness
Reborn in the ï¬re of evil
Still ï¬esh and blood
But not human anymore
Reborn to darkness
Reborn in the shape of Lucifer
I return in black
Knock knock open up your door

Soon I am dying
Oh how I long for peace
But I will revenge
Return as Lucifer
Get ready for the storm
Of the century
Vengeance is beautiful
God you will die

Legions of thunder
Let the crusade begin
We are many
Born in sin
Come on in

Reborn to darkness
Reborn in the ï¬re of evil
Still ï¬esh and blood
But not human anymore
Reborn to darkness
Reborn in the shape of Lucifer
I return in black
Knock knock open up your door
