When the men fall to the ground
Their rebel parts begin to pound
The brothers of the ancient clan
Servants of sacred land
At dusk they will raise their swords
To honour the fallen ones
They will drink around the fire
In the forest of immortality
Their freedom has been taken away
But they will never ever obey
The king of many lies
Is the devil in disguise
At dusk they will raise their swords
To honour the fallen ones
They will drink around the fire
In the forest of immortality
When heroes fall
Their fight won't be lost forever
When heroes fall
Their spirits will live on and on
When heroes fall
It's the rise chosen one
When heroes fall
The wind will blow
When you hear the holy call
Sorrow will strike the king
He will die before the spring
His castle will be burned
Death is what he has earned
When they return from the field
All their wounds will be healed
Revenge has been fulfilled
Battalions of evil they have killed
When heroes fall
Their fight won't be lost forever
When heroes fall
Their spirits will live on and on
When heroes fall
It's the rise chosen one
When heroes fall
The wind will blow
When you hear the holy call
