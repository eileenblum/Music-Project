Look at them fight
With magic at night
The wizards from the past
Look at them burn
Look at them die
With fire in their eyes
Follow the winds of fire
Deep down to Hell
The dream of flying higher
And find the secret bell
Where have they gone
The creatures of might
The Dark Lord has taken their souls
Will they still burn
Or will they return
With fire in their eyes
Follow the winds of fire
Deep down to Hell
The dream of flying higher
And find the secret bell
Behind the mirror
Is another world
Behind the mirror
Its a distant dream
Welcome to the world
Behind the mirror
Look at the night
Open your eyes
The mirror has taken your soul
Is there still hope
Is there still life
Behind your burning eyes
Follow the winds of fire
Deep down to Hell
The dream of flying higher
And find the secret bell
Behind the mirror
Is another world
Behind the mirror
Its a distant dream
Welcome to the world
Behind the mirror
