I am lying here with tears in my eyes
I guess it's time to say goodbye
Do you remember all the love that we had
But now it's lost and gone
I keep a candle burning
Deep in my heart
But I am still learning
That we are so far apart
Angel of Light
Shining so bright
I just want to hold you closely
And feel your love tonight
Angel of Light
Shining so bright
I am so lonely, Baby
Lonely in the night
Rainy days, lonely nights without you
Now I'm just lost in my misery
I'm left with my broken heart
With no strength to carry on
All the memories I just can't forget
I keep a candle burning
Deep in my heart
But I am still learning
That we are so far apart
Angel of Light
Shining so bright
I just want to hold you closely
And feel your love tonight
Angel of Light
Shining so bright
I am so lonely, Baby
Lonely in the night
