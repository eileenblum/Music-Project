This Tale is from the Magic Kingdom
Told by Generations
About the King's Crusade
Against the Mighty Dragons
Many Years of Endless Suffering
Still no Sign of the King
Now the People are Forced to Serve
The Lord of Darkness
As a Shadow he is riding through the Night
Into Rage, into Battle he Rides
Soon the Majesty will Appear
And the Empire will Arise
Freedom will have its Victory
By Fire and Steel
As a Shadow he is riding through the Night
Into Rage, into Battle he Rides
The Return of the King
The Crown and the Ring
He is Fighting for the Peace
Destroying all Disease
The Fall of the Dark Lord
By the Power of the Sword
The Gods of the Promised Land
Will bring Glory to the King
From the Dark Hills through the Enchanted Woods
Riding on the Wings of Glory Embraced by the Holy Light
The Return of the King
The Crown and the Ring
He is Fighting for the Peace
Destroying all Disease
The Fall of the Dark Lord
By the Power of the Sword
The Gods of the Promised Land
Will bring Glory to the King
