I have seen the magic light
Shining down on me
I have heard the demon cry
And the burning witches die
Thoughts of darkness, let me out
Cause I am on the edge
Am I lost or alive
Without hope to survive
Holy Dragon fly with me
To the sky across the sea
Guard of Glory, set me free
And break the prophecy
Just to see
Rise of the rainbow
Rise of my souls
Will the sun ever rise again
And stop this evil dream
Oh, Master, heal my sword
I will only serve the Lord
Give me strength to carry on
And fight this twisted world
Born to rise, born to burn
In fire I will return
Holy Dragon fly with me
To the sky across the sea
Guard of Glory, set me free
And break the prophecy
Just to see
Rise of the rainbow
Rise of my souls
Rise of the rainbow
Rise of my souls
The rise of RocknRoll
