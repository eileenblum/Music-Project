Flying free as the wind
Like an eagle in the sky
No rules will ever hold me down
My soul will never fall
Destiny wont you hear my call
The chosen one, who is born to wear the crown
Riding fast through the night
I am the keeper of eternal light
Holy blood is in my veins
Independence I will gain
Cause I will ride over the rainbow
Into the promised land
Ride through the fire
In search for victory
I will ride across the rivers
Which flow with holy blood
Ride and never surrender
I am riding free with the wind
Free will take its toll
And I will conquer all
Facing evil to cease all slavery
Fighting all the demons
which infiltrate the world
Breaking the chains of pain and tyranny
Riding fast through the night
I am the keeper of eternal light
Holy blood is in my veins
Independence I will gain
Cause I will ride over the rainbow
Into the promised land
Ride through the fire
In search for victory
I will ride across the rivers
Which flow with holy blood
Ride and never surrender
I am riding free with the wind
