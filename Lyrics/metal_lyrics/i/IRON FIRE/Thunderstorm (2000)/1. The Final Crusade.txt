Commanded to fight
And defend the light
Against the unknown
We stand alone
Some will die
And some will cry
We will return
Prevent or burn
Stranding strong
One for all
Hail to the brothers
And the glory of the sword
The battle has begun
The troops of the sun
Will fight for the pride
Side by side
The burning pain
We will enchain
The brothers of war
Will strike forevermore
Stranding strong
One for all
Hail to the brothers
And the glory of the sword
The final crusade
The gathering of steel
The final crusade
Surrender or kneel
The final crusade
The rise and the fall
The final crusade
Once and for all
