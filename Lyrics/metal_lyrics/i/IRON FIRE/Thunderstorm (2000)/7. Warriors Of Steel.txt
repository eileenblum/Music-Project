Riding through places where eagles fly
Through the valleys seeking for our destiny
The path of glory lies across the northern sky
Into the kingdom of the evil majesty
Lord of Darkness be prepared for war
On a holy quest we will ride
And strike with power and might
Hunting for revenge and the stolen treasures
And the holy steel that lies beyond the ancient sky
Of the enchanted hills where the dragons fly
Fight eternally for the mighty warriors of steel
On a trail of blood the castle will appear
The land of chaos will taste our steel
The time has come where justice is near
We will conquer, fight and reveal
Lord of Darkness be prepared for war
On a holy quest we will ride
And strike with power and might
Hunting for revenge and the stolen treasures
And the holy steel that lies beyond the ancient sky
Of the enchanted hills where the dragons fly
Fight eternally for the mighty warriors of steel
