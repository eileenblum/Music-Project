Hear the drums pound
Hear the bell toll
The fallen one burns in the sky
A journey so long
To somewhere beyond
The Dark Lord is calling your name
Into Battle you ride
To set your spirit free
And if you die
A legend you will be
Unchain your spirit
Fly with the wind
To the master you are ascended
Out of the dark
And into the sky
Your soul will be set free
Into Battle you ride
To set your spirit free
And if you die
A legend you will be
Ride, ride with me
To the fields of eternity
Ride, ride with me
To a place where we'll be free
And let the battle begin
And we will be free
Behind the shadows
Is a place called divine
It's our destiny
Only one sun will shine
When we are gathered tonight
We're all destined to be
Legends of the holy light
And together well be free
