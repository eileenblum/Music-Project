Riding through the ashes
Of many broken swords
Lord of thunder
Take them higher
The resurrection of the evil majesty
Flying on winds of fire
Through the holy land
With danger in the eyes
To the gates of hell
To the devil in disguise
Ride into the sky
Where the eagles fly
Cause I will never die
Break down and cry
Yes I will prevent
From heaven Ill descend
And I will defend
Never repent
Ill fight until the end
The scream from the darkness
still goes on and on
It nearly drives me insane
Shadow of the black moon
Appears in the sky
The fear is running through my veins
Through the holy land
With danger in the eyes
To the gates of hell
To the devil in disguise
Ride into the sky
Where the eagles fly
Cause I will never die
Break down and cry
Yes I will prevent
From heaven Ill descend
And I will defend
Never repent
Ill fight until the end
