From the sea we attack
In the center of pain
We all fall under one flag
Never beaten nor slain
Breathe the fire of Odin
Spit the poison of death
Dive into the fire wind
Cut the belly of the beast
Lord of lightning, bringer of storm
Give us strength to carry on
To live and die without fear
Now matter how it hurts
Alliance from the north
We are brothers of Thor
The hammer and the sword
Will bring slaughter and gore
Will the battleships return
And the angels are burned
We drink the wine of gods
To the blade of triumph
We charge from the sea
Under the stars we belong
Among the gods we will be
United, standing strong
Die in the battlefield
Under Odin's command
Resurrect the ancient gods
And bring glory to our land
Lord of lightning, bringer of storm
Give us strength to carry on
To live and die without fear
Now matter how it hurts
Alliance from the north
We are brothers of Thor
The hammer and the sword
Will bring slaughter and gore
Will the battleships return
And the angels are burned
We drink the wine of gods
To the blade of triumph
We drink the blood of triumph
Defend the land and embrace the sky
The water blue and the fire from hell
Shadows of death and the angels will fly
Together we fight and break the spell
Your voice will be heard
The wings of victory
We come as one and split the sky is two
Like the eyes of a lion
And the horns of a mighty bull
Like a comet that rips the sky to pieces
With the blade of triumph
Lord of lightning, bringer of storm
Give us strength to carry on
To live and die without fear
Now matter how it hurts
Alliance from the north
We are brothers of Thor
The hammer and the sword
Will bring slaughter and gore
Will the battleships return
And the angels are burned
We drink the wine of gods
Alliance from the north
We are brothers of Thor
The hammer and the sword
Will bring slaughter and gore
Will the battleships return
And the angels are burned
We drink the wine of gods
To the blade of triumph
Our quest has just begun
Children of the sun
It has just begun
