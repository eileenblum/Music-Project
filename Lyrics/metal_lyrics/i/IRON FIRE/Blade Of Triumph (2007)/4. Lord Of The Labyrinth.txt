Through the ancient forest, the home of the elves
Dark magic wonders will rule the old wood
My enemies are many, but my sword will prevail
The crimson warrior on the path of doom

Strong and brave rise up from beyond
A heroâs quest the story has just begun

Riding through thunder â Through wind and through rain
Approaching the castle of judgment in vain
Only one will hold the crown and the ring
And bring the fall  of the goblin king
âCause you know, he is the lord of the labyrinth

Face the mighty snow lord, the keeper of the cold
Ride the wings of thunder on the unicorn

Fight the slimy creatures that hide in the deep
The wizardâs spell will guide you through the bloody fields
Strong and brave rise up from beyond
A heroâs quest the story has just begun
Riding through thunder â Through wind and through rain
Approaching the castle of judgment in vain
Only one will hold the crown and the ring
And bring the fall  of the goblin king
âCause you know, he is the lord of the labyrinth
Donât know where to go or where to turn
Cause every where you go, your path will burn
Donât know where to go or where to turn
Cause every where you go, your path will burn
Strong and brave rise up from beyond

A heroâs quest the story has just begun
Riding through thunder â Through wind and through rain
Approaching the castle of judgment in vain
Only one will hold the crown and the ring
And bring the fall  of the goblin king
âCause you know, he is the lord of the labyrinth
Riding through thunder â Through wind and through rain
Approaching the castle of judgment in vain
Only one will hold the crown and the ring
And bring the fall  of the goblin king
âCause you know, he is the lord of the labyrinth
