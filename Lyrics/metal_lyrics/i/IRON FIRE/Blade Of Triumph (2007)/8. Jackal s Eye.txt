I'm the survivor of my clan
The fight for freedom and for the land
The battle is raging and men will bite the dust
We show no mercy in steel we trust
Lock up your sons and daughters
The time has come for slaughter
In your sleep you will see
The eye of the jackal
Like a beast in the night
The eye of the jackal
Always ready to fight
Eye of the jackal
Immortal battle cry
Eye of the jackal
The flame that never dies
In the jackal's eye
The last man standing in these bloody fields
With the sign of fury on my shield
A bite from the jackal and you scream in agony
A taste of the hammer and dead you will be
Lock up your sons and daughters
The time has come for slaughter
In your sleep you will see
The eye of the jackal
Like a beast in the night
Eye of the jackal
Always ready to fight
Eye of the jackal
Immortal battle cry
Eye of the jackal
The flame that never dies
The eye of the jackal
Like a beast in the night
Eye of the jackal
Always ready to fight
Eye of the jackal
Immortal battle cry
Eye of the jackal
The flame that never dies
In the jackal's eye
