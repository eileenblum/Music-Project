The smell of blood - the smell of pain
Will unleash the beast in chain
Come as knight and return as king
Dragonheart the chosen one to bring
As written in the prophecies
A hard quest to the fire breeze
A new king will seize the day
Fall in battle or dragon slay
Marching across the fields
Like an army made of steel
Holding high our shields
As we engage the beast of rage
Flames in the night the dragon we fight
One by one men will fall
Flames in the night blood brothers unite
Fire from the dark in flames right from the start
Dragonheart
If you claim the land the throne
Face the creature of steel and bones
Bring back the price for the crown
Every soldier will hail and kneel down
Marching across the fields
Like an army made of steel
Holding high our shields
As we engage the beast of rage
Flames in the night the dragon we fight
One by one men will fall
Flames in the night blood brothers unite
Fire from the dark in flames right from the start
Dragonheart
Through the lands
Through the forest
I got my sword - I must be brave
Over the hills
The horizon is calling my name
I guide the flame
I fight the beast
I fight the trolls
I smash the skulls
Of the goblins that stand in my way
No wizard spell can stop me
The price is high
But glory will be mine
Marching across the fields
Like an army made of steel
Holding high our shields
As we engage the beast of rage
Flames in the night the dragon we fight
One by one men will fall
Flames in the night blood brothers unite
Fire from the dark in flames right from the start
Dragonheart
Flames in the night the dragon we fight
One by one men will fall
Flames in the night blood brothers unite
Fire from the dark in flames right from the start
Dragonheart
