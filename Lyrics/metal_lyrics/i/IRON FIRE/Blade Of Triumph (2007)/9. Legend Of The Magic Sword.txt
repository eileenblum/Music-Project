Secret of the sea â Lady of the Lake
Brought the sword
A true king will hold the steel
It will only be owned by a pure heart
A magic spell will hold the blade
In the stone for chosen one
It was made to bring harmony
And to reunite the ancient land
You got to ride the wild wind
To the gates of Camelot
Sanctuary for those who feel lost in Avalon
Cause a king will be born
Raised in the forest
Behind the golden gates of the shiny fortress
At the table of knights, a brotherhood of light
In the legend of the Magic Sword

Merlin claimed the child
In exchange for a deed â A little magic trick
Arthur was his name
He was young, he was brave
With a righteous mind

You got to ride the wild wind
To the gates of Camelot
Sanctuary for those who feel lost in Avalon
Cause a king will be born
Raised in the forest
Behind the golden gates of the shiny fortress
At the table of knights, a brotherhood of light
In the legend of the Magic Sword
The legacy lives on and on
On a trail of magic sorcery
A thousand years in you and me
A legend of steel and Bravery
You got to ride the wild wind
To the gates of Camelot
Sanctuary for those who feel lost in Avalon

Will carry on
Cause a king will be born
Raised in the forest
Behind the golden gates of the shiny fortress
At the table of knights, a brotherhood of light
In the legend of the Magic Sword
