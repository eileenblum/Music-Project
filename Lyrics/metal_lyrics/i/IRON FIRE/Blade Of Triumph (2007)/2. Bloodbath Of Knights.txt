Straight from Jerusalem to the gates of Babylon
The crusade moves on and on
From the Danish shores of blood
To the kingdom of the king
With evil tongues we sing
They call it holy war
We have seen it all before
Unwritten pages will burn in flames
Die by the blade, die by the sword
Write them their last rites it's a bloodbath of knights
Die by the blade, die by the sword
Write them their last rites it's a nightmare
Bloodbath of knights
Been centuries of war and men have died in vain
No one can cease the pain
They wheel the bloody sword the fight goes on till dawn
And the battle still rages on
They call it holy war
We have seen it all before
Unwritten pages will burn in flames
Die by the blade, die by the sword
Write them their last rites it's a bloodbath of knights
Die by the blade, die by the sword
Write them their last rites it's a nightmare
Bloodbath of knights
Blinded in darkness by fear
Judgement of heaven is near
The fall of the gods and the holy
Prophets of doom give us mercy
They call it holy war
We have seen it all before
Unwritten pages will burn in flames
Die by the blade, die by the sword
Write them their last rites it's a bloodbath of knights
Die by the blade, die by the sword
Write them their last rites it's a nightmare
Bloodbath of knights
Bloodbath of knights
