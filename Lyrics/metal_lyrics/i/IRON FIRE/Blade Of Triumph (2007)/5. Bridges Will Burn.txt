Cheap tongues and we don't believe a word
By god our voices will be heard
No second chance - no afterlife
But we come from the land of miracles
White light will shine from above
Spellbind those who play it rough
A broken soul, a broken heart
Will be filled with the light of the unicorn
Ride holy knight in to metal evolution
The time has come to revolution
The chosen one will soon become
The master of the universe
And then the gods will return
The crimson king will draw the sword
From the stone for eternity
And then the gods will return
And bridges will burn
Dark path for the lost and lonely one
With dreams that shine like the sun
The deepest fear, the darkest hour
Will burn in the flames of victory
Find the grail and then you find the king
A search for the crown and the ring
A battlefield, a sea of blood
From the ashes a legend will arise
Ride holy knight in to metal evolution
The time has come to revolution
The chosen one will soon become
The master of the universe
And then the gods will return
The crimson king will draw the sword
From the stone for eternity
And then the gods will return
And bridges will burn
We came at night ready to fight
Embraced by black we came as strangers
Send from the sky, we'll never die
Bridges will burn in flames so high
We came at night ready to fight
Embraced by black we came as strangers
Send from the sky, we'll never die
Bridges will burn in flames so high
Ride holy knight in to metal evolution
The time has come to revolution
And the bridges will burn
Bridges will burn
We will burn
