Just wanted to be free
Born into slavery
Breaking the chains tonight
The hammer and the steel will bite
Burned down everything
And the sword will swing
Revenge is beautiful
My vengeance won't be merciful
The arena will be covered in blood
Now it's time to give all that you've got
And when they open the gate
All is at stake
The price is glorious
In rage steel will kiss
The endless battleground
Victory not in second round
No pain can hold me back
Now it's just full attack
The king will return
The chosen one will set you to burn
The arena will be covered in blood
Now it's time to give all that you've got
And when they open the gate
All is at stake
My name is Armageddon
My steel is like the venom
From the cobra that will bring you down
(Die for the gladiator)
Deep down in the dungeon
I await like a scorpion
Someday all will kneel down
The gladiator comes for you
Feel the pain when the steel goes go through
All enemies will hit the ground
He was betrayed by the general in arms
Crucified on the desert planes
Rivers of blood
The angels will cry
Here comes the man that never dies
Rise from beyond
Kill you in blind
Here comes the king
From the underground
The time has come
For the battle to start
He will tear you
Tear you apart
My name is Armageddon
My steel is like the venom
From the cobra that will bring you down
(Die for the gladiator)
Deep down in the dungeon
I await like a scorpion
Someday all will kneel down
The gladiator comes for you
Feel the pain when the steel goes go through
All enemies will hit the ground
The gladiator comes for you
Feel the pain when the steel goes go through
All enemies will hit the ground
(Feel god's wrath)
The gladiator's path
