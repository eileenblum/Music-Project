Just like the road that leads to nowhere
Riding the time like there is no tomorrow
Obey the voice that speaks from the inside
Through the darkness and into the light
From the shadows and the underground
From the dungeon faith is rising
The spell is broken and the curse is gone
A deadly omen back from the past
The clock is ticking - end of the hourglass
Time for justice, now it's payback
It's the calling and the gathering
Dawn of glory - no fear nation
The ghost of failure is dead and gone with the wind
Guardian angel spread your wings and fly away
Just follow the sign
Through fire and water
Follow the sign
Follow me
Like an arrow through the thunderstone
In lightning heaven just like lightning
See it coming, with the speed of sound
In the moment a free spirit
The ghost of failure is dead and gone with the wind
Guardian angel spread your wings and fly away
Just follow the sign
Through fire and water
Follow the sign
Through pain and slaughter
Metal is rising here tonight
Metal is rising you see the light
The crusade that never dies
Is been here since the dawn of time
Metal troops you can defy
The time is right here tonight
The crusade that never dies
Is been here since the dawn of time
Metal troops you can defy
The time is right here tonight
Just like the road that leads to nowhere
Riding the time like there is no tomorrow
Obey the voice that speaks from the inside
Through the darkness and into the light
And fly away
Just follow the sign
Through fire and water
Follow the sign
Through pain and slaughter
Metal is rising here tonight
Metal is rising you see the light
Metal is rising
