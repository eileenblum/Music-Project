Sons of thunder we're born in slavery
The darkest hunter boys of bravery
A circle of fate dream of defiance
A new crusade magic alliance

Raven wings will carry me
Wizard rings will set me free

Horsemen of the might we are few but we will fight
And never die as a slave stand up for the brotherhood
The kingdom is mine just follow the sign
We are warriors to the grave
Brotherhoods of the brave

Alien fighters are marching in
Crossroad riders let the storm begin

Raven wings will carry me
Wizard rings will set me free

Horsemen of the might we are few but we will fight
And never die as a slave stand up for the brotherhood
The kingdom is mine just follow the sign
We are warriors to the grave
Brotherhoods of the brave

Arrows are flying with the speed of light
Betrayers are dying suffer in the night

Raven wings will carry me
Wizard rings will set me free

We keep the flame burning born into Ironfire
We keep the wheels on turning metal takes us higher
We keep the flame burning born into Ironfire
We keep the wheels on turning metal takes us higher

Horsemen of the might we are few but we will fight
And never die as a slave stand up for the brotherhood
The kingdom is mine just follow the sign
We are warriors to the grave
Brotherhoods of the brave
