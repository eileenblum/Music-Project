Hunted by demonic eyes all I see is burning skies
Vision seems so real trying to break free
This place is spellbound
The shadow land below the ground
Voices cut like steel
Lost without a key

Try to find a open door
That leads the way to the robot wars

Alone in the dark for ages
Nocturnal slave from the cradle to the grave
Alone in the dark for ages
Eternal slave where the lost soul creeps
Alone in the dark

Every second seems like a year
I'm longing to get out of here
To get back with my brothers
Keep fighting till dawn
Prisoner in this twilight
Salvation will be the sun light
Dark warrior rising
Twisted black and reborn

Try to find a open door
That leads the way to the robot wars

Alone in the dark for ages
Nocturnal slave from the cradle to the grave
Alone in the dark for ages
Eternal slave where the lost soul creeps

A journey from the dark and from the beyond
When the time is right for freedom
The saviour will appear again
Again

Try to find a open door
That leads the way to the robot wars

Alone in the dark for ages
Nocturnal slave from the cradle to the grave
Alone in the dark for ages
Eternal slave where the lost soul creeps
Alone in the dark

Try to find a open door
That leads the way to the robot wars

Alone in the dark a tortured soul
