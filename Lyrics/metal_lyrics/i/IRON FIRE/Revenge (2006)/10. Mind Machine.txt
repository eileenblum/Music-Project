Mind machine

Aroin has provided a new fighting power
The alien Armageddon force will attack
The evil doctor with the devil hand in hand
Creating thunder with a little help from down under
One with the master mind domination be designed
The chaos engineer behind the machine in gear

Pain is coming blood is running
Down the blade

Mind machine
You won't see it even if it's close
Mind machine
Cyber liquid overdose
Mind machine
The monster of a new age
Mind machine
The doctor spreads his disease

Mind machine

Lifetime of defeat the evil circle will repeat
Madness has found a home
Sky-high in the thunder dome
Seen before in history this time there is no mercy
The code in the end humanity will dissent

Pain is coming blood is running
Down the blade

Mind machine
You won't see it even if it's close
Mind machine
Cyber liquid overdose
Mind machine
The monster of a new age
Mind machine
The doctor spreads his disease

Evil is coming, it's coming your way
Evil is coming, it's coming your way

Pain is coming blood is running
Down the blade

Mind machine
You won't see it even if it's close
Mind machine
Cyber liquid overdose
Mind machine
The monster of a new age
Mind machine
The doctor spreads his disease
