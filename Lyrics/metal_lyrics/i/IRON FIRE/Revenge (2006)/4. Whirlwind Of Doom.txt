One for all

It's been five long years in the dark
And now a new age will begin
This time there will be no prisoners
There will be no mercy
Bloody wars in the underground
Has made a new monster
And the war for revenge, will strike now go

Trapped in a nightmare lost in a dream
Betrayed at the battle scene
backstabbing brothers wanted me dead
Now my steel is all that they get

Like a shadow rising up from below
Years in darkness now we finally
Know where to go
Metal we will consume like a

Whirlwind of doom one for all
The hammer of Caine will crush you
Whirlwind of doom hear the call
Ironheads united

Whirlwind of doom one for all
The hammer of Caine will crush you
Whirlwind of doom hear the call
Ironheads united for revenge

They granted me power and took it away
Here's another battle to slay
A monster of metal a creature of steel
To no man we will ever kneel

Like a shadow rising up from below
Years in darkness now we finally
Know where to go
Metal we will consume like a

Whirlwind of doom one for all
The hammer of Caine will crush you
Whirlwind of doom hear the call
Ironheads united

Whirlwind of doom one for all
The hammer of Caine will crush you
Whirlwind of doom hear the call
Ironheads united for revenge

It felt just like paradise days of no compromise
Bridges will burn but we will built new ones
So join use in our world and fight by our side
Brothers and sisters we bid you welcome

Hail to the chosen ones
There will be no mercy no prisoners
Hail to the chosen ones
We will last like no one before
Hail to the chosen ones
There will be no mercy no prisoners
Hail to the chosen ones
We will last like no one before

No one before
Like a whirlwind of doom
We're out for revenge
Like a whirlwind of doom
