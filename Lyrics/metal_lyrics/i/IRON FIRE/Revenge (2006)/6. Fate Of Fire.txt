When the thunder strikes on the mountain side
We claim the land the last crusaders ride

Slaughter divine we follow the sign
The years have been long
but now we're standing strong with

Fate, fate of fire
Burn it all down
Fate, fate of fire
Smashing the ground
Forces will unite

With glory and steel we fly on the eagle wings
We come down with fire in memory of the kings

Slaughter divine we follow the sign
The years have been long
but now we're standing strong with

Fate, fate of fire
Burn it all down
Fate, fate of fire
Smashing the ground
Forces will unite

We will unite with fate of fire in the night
Iron legions will unite

Slaughter divine we follow the sign
The years have been long but now we're standing strong with

Gate keepers of the flame light it up till we burn it down
Gate keepers of the flame light it up till we burn it down

Fate, fate of fire
Burn it all down
Fate, (fight, fight, fight) fate of fire
Smashing the ground
Forces will unite
