To rise with the wind
And to carry on this flight
A chance to be noble
And brave tonight
The task lies ahead
For the chosen one to see
Follow the path a legend to be
Savage prophecy

Rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise

You thought it was over
You thought we we're gone forever
The flames are still burning
This time we are gonna fight together
Back from the dead back from the war beyond
We left you behind but now the battle is won

United we stand
Metal will bring to the Promised Land

Power to rise, power to the gods of victory
Power to rise, power to the savage prophecy

Hail to the spirit hail to the king and the land
Metal domination the iron legions in command

United we stand
Metal will bring to the Promised Land

Power to rise, power to the gods of victory
Power to rise, power to the savage prophecy
Power to rise, power to the gods of victory
Power to rise, power to the savage prophecy

The savage prophecy

United we stand
Metal will bring to the Promised Land

Power to rise, power to the gods of victory
Power to rise, power to the savage prophecy
Power to rise, power to the gods of victory
Power to rise, power to the savage prophecy

The savage prophecy
The savage prophecy

To rise with the wind and to carry on this flight
A chance to be noble and brave tonight
The task lies ahead for the chosen one to see
We follow the path a legend, legend to be
