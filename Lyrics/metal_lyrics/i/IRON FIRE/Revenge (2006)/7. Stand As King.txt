Feeling down like never before
Like a spirit been beaten in war
Wind in your face without luck on you back
Waiting like a shark to attack

Striking hard when no on expects it
We're rising higher
Like a statement the hammer will hit
In the name of Ironfire

Stand as king, let the legions unite
Armed and ready to fight
Stand as king, feel the power in light
Heavy metal tonight - stand as king

Glory will come for those who will wait
And believe that it's never to late
When times get dark and blind your way
Remember there's a price to pay

Striking hard when no on expects it
We're rising higher
Like a statement the hammer will hit
In the name of Ironfire

Stand as king, let the legions unite
Armed and ready to fight
Stand as king, feel the power in light
Heavy metal tonight

Your not alone everybody's got their own cross to spear
Stand up straight and walk the line
All for one we leave no one behind

Die for the king
For the crown and the ring

Striking hard when no on expects it
We're rising higher
Like a statement the hammer will hit
In the name of Ironfire

Stand as king, let the legions unite
Armed and ready to fight
Stand as king, feel the power in light
Heavy metal tonight - stand as king
