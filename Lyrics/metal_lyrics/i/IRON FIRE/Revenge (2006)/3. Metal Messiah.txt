Behold the steel this is for real
Tonight the master command
Coming for you know what to do
With hands in the air make a stand

Can you hear the voice from below
Can you see the path where to go
We all kneel down to the

Metal massiah
Creator of thunder
Metal massiah
Lightning from down under

You feel the heat punch from the beat
The magic is smashing the sky
All standing proud we make it load
The legions that no one can buy

Can you hear the voice from below
Can you see the path where to go
We all kneel down to the

Metal massiah
Creator of thunder
Metal massiah
Lightning from down under

Keepers of the universe
Bring us metal at birth
Keepers of the universe
Bring us metal at birth

Can you hear the voice from below
Can you see the path where to go
We all kneel down to the

Metal massiah
Creator of thunder
Metal massiah
Lightning from down under
