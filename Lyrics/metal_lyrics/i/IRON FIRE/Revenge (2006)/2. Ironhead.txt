There are no chains that can hold him down
Iron head is here in town
On wheels of freedom riding hard
Born with a rebel heart

They call him outlaw call him fear
In smoke and fire he appears
A king of the highway call of the wild
Here comes the thunder child

His legacy lives on for ages
His destiny is unknown
Blood on the tombstone

Ironhead last rebel riding
Ironhead on hells highway
Ironhead true hero fighting
Ironhead he will blow them all away

Legions of the ironhead

Raising hell a gambler son
He is always on the run
A gun fighting man a true patriot
Gasoline is in his blood

Never surrender, never give in
You got to ride the beast now let it spin
Like a desperado gone on a crusade
Forced on a renegade

His legacy lives on for ages
His destiny is unknown
Blood on the tombstone

Ironhead last rebel riding
Ironhead on hells highway
Ironhead true hero fighting
Ironhead he will blow them all away

Come from a land a planet far away
A rebel heart is hard to tear apart
Come from a land a planet far away
A rebel heart is hard to tear apart

Ironhead, Ironhead
Ironhead, Ironhead

Ironhead last rebel riding
Ironhead on hells highway
Ironhead true hero fighting
Ironhead he will blow them all away
