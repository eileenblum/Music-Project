A planet far away long forgotten savage land
Before the aliens became a part of the masterplan
A landscape of harmony - so beautiful and crystal clear
The arrival at Arion turned fire and ice into fear

Came as strangers and took the peace
Sent on a mission, to spread the evil disease

At the ice-cold Arion
Where the snow is falling down
At the ice-cold Arion
Keep the throne and the crown
At the ice-cold Arion

A galaxy of pain, a twisted picture of the doctor's wrath
One step closer to the Armageddon and the evil path
When the line is crossed, there's no way back - no return
A frozen enemy deep in the snow - hellfire will burn

Came as strangers and took the peace
Sent on a mission, to spread the evil disease

At the ice-cold Arion
Where the sky is turning black
At the ice-cold Arion
Feel the wind is coming back
At the ice-cold Arion
Came as strangers and took the peace
Sent on a mission, to spread the evil disease

Ice-cold Arion
Where the snow is falling down
Ice-cold Arion
Keep the throne and the crown
Ice-cold Arion
Where the sky is turning black
At the ice-cold Arion
Feel the wind is coming back
At the ice-cold Arion
