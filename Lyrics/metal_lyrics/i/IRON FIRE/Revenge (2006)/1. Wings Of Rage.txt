Rise with the wind
We win the fight with steel and light
Here we go

Through hell and back
In the temple of the dead
Time to attack
Final quest of the ironhead

No more betrayal nothing is gonna hold us down
This time we slay conquering our own fate

Wings of rage
Fly across the old desert sky
Guided by the moon we fly
Wings of rage
Taste the blood of the brother's return
In unity we rise again with
Wings of rage

The crusade goes on and on and on

We had it all
Threw away now we return
The magic restored
The fire and the flame

No more betrayal nothing is gonna hold us down
This time we slay conquering our own fate

Wings of rage
Fly across the old desert sky
Guided by the moon we fly
Wings of rage
Taste the blood of the brother's return
In unity we rise again with
Wings of rage

Children of the night
Riding on the lost highway
Children of the night
Riding on the lost highway

No more betrayal nothing is gonna hold us down
This time we slay conquering our own fate

Wings of rage
Fly across the old desert sky
Guided by the moon we fly
Wings of rage
Taste the blood of the brother's return
In unity we rise again with
Wings of rage
