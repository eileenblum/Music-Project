It's been far too long we've done it wrong
Down the road overload
Been paralyzed almost hypnotized
The wake-up call for us all

Believe it or not - there's a better way
It's all that we've got
It's hell to pay now before its to late

Break the spell once and for all
We're dancing with the devil
Break the spell, the hammer will fall
White horse coming for you
Break the spell

There's no escape - your soul to rape
The hammer falls - darkness calls
Out of control - straight in the home
The final strike - that's what it's like

Believe it or not - there's a better way
It's all that we've got
It's hell to pay now before its to late

Break the spell once and for all
We're dancing with the devil
Break the spell, the hammer will fall
White horse coming for you
Break the spell

Isolated forever sedated in a fantasy world
A fairytale like the demons in hell
That's what we've created
You have crossed the line

Break the spell once and for all
We're dancing with the devil
Break the spell, the hammer will fall
White horse coming for you
Break the spell
