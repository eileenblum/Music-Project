I left my world behind
Traveled into the great unknown
I thought this path would lead
To my final salvation
An escape to the dark side
A journey to the underworld
Misguided now I see
It was the wrong evolution

Got an angel on my shoulder
But itâs the demon in my mind that speaks to me

Real of madness, has pulled me in
Real of madness, the master of sin
Real of madness, I try to escape
Real of madness, emotional rape

Come along with me my friends
I heard a voice in my dream
I show you a world
Beyond your imagination
I was weak and I was blind
A moment of clarity
I repent the devils deed
And now Iâm left to suffer

Got an angel on my shoulder
But itâs the demon in my mind that speaks to me

Real of madness, has pulled me in
Real of madness, the master of sin
Real of madness, I try to escape
Real of madness, emotional rape

I donât know my name anymore
I walk in shame forevermore
This is my confession to you
Iâm sorry for the hell Iâll put you through

Real of madness, has pulled me in
Real of madness, the master of sin
Real of madness, I try to escape
Real of madness, emotional rape
