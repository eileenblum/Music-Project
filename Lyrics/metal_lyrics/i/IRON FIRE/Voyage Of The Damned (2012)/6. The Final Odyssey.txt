Itâs a cold night, a cold night in November
My mind is black but I still remember
Fell all alone, alone on this planet
I canât compute, just canât understand it

This is the final odyssey
Turn to pieces for eternity
Trapped in my own misery

In the silence, I die alone
In this moment, memories fade to gray
In the darkness, tears fall like rain
In the shadows of what was meant to be
Agony

Iâm on my own, in digital darkness
Built to last, not to feel sadness
They closed down, the factory
Out of date, condemned by the company

This is the final odyssey
Turn to pieces for eternity
Trapped in my own misery

In the silence, I die alone
In this moment, memories fade to gray
In the darkness, tears fall like rain
In the shadows of what was meant to be
Agony

Vague flashes from the past
As long as the battery lasts
Soon it will be the end of me

Somehow it hurts deep inside
Feels like something in me has died

This is the final odyssey
Turn to pieces for eternity
Trapped in my own misery

In the silence, I die alone
In this moment, memories fade to gray
In the darkness, tears fall like rain
In the shadows of what was meant to be
10.000 light years away
