Darkness taking over me
Left all alone in the cold stratosphere
Computerized technology
Am I victim of a conspiracy?

Somethingâs wrong, but there is no turning back now
I must carry on
A damned machine, frontiers of the unknown
This is how nightmares are born

Voyage of the damned
We ride into the starlight
Voyage of the damned
We walk into digital
Suffering

Chaos riding next to me
I canât believe how this madness re-appears
The devil speaks frequently
Who are a friends and who are my enemies

Somethingâs wrong, but there is no turning back now
I must carry on
A damned machine, frontiers of the unknown
This is how nightmares are born

Voyage of the damned
We ride into the starlight
Voyage of the damned
We walk into digital
Suffering

Iâm one with silence, darkness is my home
Iâm one with the shadows, last one to reach eternity

Iâm the first in line, no one will ever get in my way
Iâm the one to shine, forever until judgementday

Gluttony, greed, sloth, anger, pride, lust, envy

Slowly Iâm becoming something different
And I donât know this face anymore
I feel deep inside things are changing
Things will never be like before

I see frontiers of endless darkness
I see the stars reach out for me

A trail of tears is all I left behind
I walk the guilty path
In the land of the blind
I search the universe and now I understand
The truth comes from within
There is no master plan

Trapped in a damned machine
This is how nightmares are born

Voyage of the damned
We ride into the starlight
Voyage of the damned
We walk into digital
Suffering
We ride the moonlight
Voyage of the damned
We ride the starlight
Voyage of the damned

My god its full of stars
