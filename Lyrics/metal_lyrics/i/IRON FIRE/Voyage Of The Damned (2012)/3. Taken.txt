They will come in the night
Sky light up bright
Theyâve been here before
The black hole is the door
Claim the right to test
The uninvited guest
Losing track of time
A universal crime

Blinded by the black
A mind control attack
Forever a slave to be
The truth will set you free

I think Iâve been taken
I might be mistaken
The truth will set you free
And Iâm not faking
Taken

Denying all the facts
Surveillance all intact
The sequence we canât break
Transmission kills like the plague

Evil comes in black
In time they will attack
Before the dawn of days
Mankind was meant to face
Blinded by the black
A mind control attack
Forever a slave to be
The truth will set you free

I think Iâve been taken
I might be mistaken
The truth will set you free
And Iâm not faking
I think Iâve been taken
I might be mistaken
But I canât stop shaking
And Iâm not faking
Taken

They grab in my dreams
Time stands still while they operate
