Verge to collide, I see my shadow burn
Verge to collide, now there is no return

Voices are calling, from far beyond
Insanity unfolding, in my unconscious mind
In sadness Iâm falling, the shadows of my soul
Is closing, embracing, the fury from within

Look into the dark again, what do I see
The reflection reveals whatâs inside

Verge to collide, I see my shadow burn
Verge to collide, now there is no return
Verge to collide, in this tunnel there is no light
Verge to collide, now there is no place to hide

Grim choices revealing, the path of misery
Sad voices still calling, Iâm lost in agony

Look into the dark again, what do I see
The reflection reveals whatâs inside

Verge to collide, I see my shadow burn
Verge to collide, now there is no return
Verge to collide, in this tunnel there is no light
Verge to collide, now there is no place to hide
Deep inside

I take the misery, I take the agony
And push it away from me
I put it down to sleep, nothing left to keep
I kill that dirty creep

Look into the dark again, what do I see
The reflection reveals whatâs inside

Verge to collide, I see my shadow burn
Verge to collide, now there is no return
Verge to collide, in this tunnel there is no light
Verge to collide, now there is no place to hide
Deep inside

I take the misery, I take the agony
My symphony
