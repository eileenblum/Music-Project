Take the backdoor into deep space
Enter the universe
There is no limit to this place
The birth of mankind's curse
Beyond time and into starlight
The unknown void awaits
Into the black we take a flight
The galaxy is the gate

Out here the silence is loud
The sound of dying stars
Get no clue what itâs all about
Since we left from Mars
The father of time and the mother of God
Destructive to the core
A magnetic force so powerful
There will be no final war

This fate I canât comprehend
We fall into the dark
There is no escape from this place
Where time and space can bend
Enter oblivion
Exploiting fire in deep space
Enter oblivion
The darkest hour shows its face

A star crusade in the cosmos sky
The captain and the crew
Got no fear of the unknown
We all condemned to die

The last frontier for humanity
Flashes for our eyes
We take the ship from planet Earth
Into the event horizon

This fate I canât comprehend
We fall into the dark
There is no escape from this place
Where time and space can bend
Enter oblivion
Exploiting fire in deep space
Enter oblivion
The darkest hour shows its face
