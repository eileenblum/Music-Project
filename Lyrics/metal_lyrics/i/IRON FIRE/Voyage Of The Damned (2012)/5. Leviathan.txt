I feel the weight pushing down on me
From a distant world beyond reality
Prepare for the arrival
From freezing cold in the galaxy
The time has come for mankind to make a stand
There is no survival

What can we do to stop the agony?
Have we passed the point of amnesty?
The time is running
From the sky comes the bringer of hate
The enemies emerge outside the gate
Empires are burning

In the hour of need we fight together
Against the unknown force
We face the deepest fear of mankind, in the

Jaws of the leviathan, in the jaws
Of the mighty beast, in the 
Jaws of the leviathan, in the jaws
All hell breaks loose
Prepare for the arrival
There is no survival, no

The vision from the old prophecy
The ancient words of our destiny
The final conflict
Madness comes from way up high
Time to pray for your soul and say goodbye
There will be no retreat

In the hour of need we fight together
Against the unknown force
We face the deepest fear of mankind, in the

Jaws of the leviathan, in the jaws
Of the mighty beast, in the 
Jaws of the leviathan, in the jaws
All hell breaks loose
Here comes the invasion

We fight in the darkness,
We hide in the shadows
Even if it takes for eternity
We will solve this conflict
On alien district
Until we finally are free

In the hour of need we fight together
Against the unknown force
We face the deepest fear of mankind, in the

Jaws of the leviathan, in the jaws
Of the mighty beast, in the 
Jaws of the leviathan, in the jaws
All hell breaks loose
No survival

Prepare for the arrival
There will be no, no
No survival
We are in the jaws, we are in the jaws
Of the leviathan
