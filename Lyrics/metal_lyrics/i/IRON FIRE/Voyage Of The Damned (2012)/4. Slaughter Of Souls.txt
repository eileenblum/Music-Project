Annihilation of your soul will begin

Hellraising dark shadows
Death embracing winds of fury
Night crawling strange walking
Hate feeding creatures marching
Dark kingdom ascending
From beyond hell force rising
This planet, doomed and curse
The slaughter of all mankind 

In search of light and the truth
Itâs the curse that lives in me and you, and the

Slaughter of souls, slaughter
When we enter the star gate
Nightmares of rage, nightmares
When we enter the star gate

The gateway that leads to
Destruction of it all
We enter the darkness
The virus eats our flesh and blood
In search of light and the truth 
Itâs the curse that lives in me and you, and the

Slaughter of souls, slaughter
When we enter the star gate
Nightmares of rage, nightmares
When we enter the star gate

We are the truth, we are the pain
That breath inside your mind
The bringer of hate, creator of death
Scavengers of universe

In search of light and the truth 
Itâs the curse that lives in me and you, and the

Slaughter of souls, slaughter
When we enter the star gate
Nightmares of rage, nightmares
When we enter the star gate
The extinction of passenger five is now complete
