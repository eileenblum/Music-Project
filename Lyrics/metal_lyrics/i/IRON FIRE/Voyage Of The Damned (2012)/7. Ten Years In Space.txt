Back in time, ten years ago
I heard a call of a hero
Stand the ground until the end
Straight into hell I was sent
We were told to hold the line
What to do, where do I sign
Do your best to earn the crown
Nothing said in hell I drown

The years have passed and still I carry on
The best days of my life are gone

Ten years in space, ten years
Mankindâs fall from grace
The years in space, ten years
Humanity shows its ugly face
Ugly face

In the dark I not alone
Endless days of agony
I fight my own misery
I guess this was my destiny
They told me lies and I was blind
Lost and found by the killing kind
Young and brave they made a slave
Now I kick back to the grave

The years have passed and still I carry on
The best days of my life are gone

Ten years in space, ten years
Mankindâs fall from grace
The years in space, ten years
Humanity shows its ugly face

I kick and I break you
Dominate and I take two
I hate and fall through
I die but I love you
I kick and I break you
Dominate and I take two
I hate and fall through
I die but I love you

I carry on

Ten years in space, ten years
Mankindâs fall from grace
The years in space, ten years
Humanity shows its ugly face
Ten years in space
