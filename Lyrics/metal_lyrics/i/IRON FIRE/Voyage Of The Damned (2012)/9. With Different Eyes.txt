I walk among the ruins
And in the dark Iâm losing
Every sense of time and space
I trusted you in silence
The truth you gave in return
The pain cuts like knives

When all is said and done
I twist and turn
I look into the sun and burn
Now I see with different eyes
Once again I close my soul
Now I see through all the lies
Looking through the mirror of disbelieve

I look close into the mirror
And what I see makes me a shiver
Is this the man I really am?
The guilt is haunting me
Madness will set me free
Condemned like a child of the damned

When all is said and done
I twist and turn
I look into the sun and burn
Now I see with different eyes
Once again I close my soul
Now I see through all the lies
Looking through the mirror of disbelieve

I twist I turn
And in the end Iâll burn
He will take my name
Straight into hell

When all is said and done
I twist and turn
I look into the sun and burn
Now I see with different eyes
Once again I close my soul
Now I see through all the lies
Looking through the mirror of disbelieve
