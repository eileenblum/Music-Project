Standing alone with no one to turn to
This is my own nightmare without you
I donât know where to go from here
My destiny or my darkest fear
Feeling dead but Iâm still here and alive
The shadow land is where I am the king
I am drown to a place of suffering
Desperate thoughts circle in my head

The vision unfolds
The slaughter of souls
A nightmare so cold
In my sleep there is only

Dead dreams, dead dreams of the dead moon
Dead dreams, the voices from the void I blame
Dead dreams, dead dreams of the dead moon
Dead dreams, voices from the void call my name

Taking the blame, this story is stillborn
Walking in shame, all my thoughts are torn
Take my hand and feel the endless pain
A tortured soul broken and so slain
The vision unfolds
The slaughter of souls
A nightmare so cold
In my sleep there is only

Dead dreams, dead dreams of the dead moon
Dead dreams, the voices from the void I blame
Dead dreams, dead dreams of the dead moon
Dead dreams, voices from the void call my name

Call my name

The vision unfolds
The slaughter of souls
A nightmare so cold
In my sleep there is only

Dead dreams, dead dreams of the dead moon
Dead dreams, the voices from the void I blame
Dead dreams, dead dreams of the dead moon
Dead dreams, voices from the void call my name
