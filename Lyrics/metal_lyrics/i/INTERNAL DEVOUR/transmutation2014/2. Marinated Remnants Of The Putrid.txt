Violence is all I have ever known,
Since I was young,
Butchering animals and dissecting cadavers from day one,
Psychotic killer, is this what I have fucking become?

Another successful day,
Another pile of cunts stuffed away,
Some slightly decayed.

Tonight I have a taste for meat,
Walk downstairs into my home made morgue,
I feel like human femur,
with a side of rotten tongue.

Violence is all I have ever known!

I like it better when its decomposing
I grind the rotten skin using it for seasoning.

I rip out the oldest corpse and throw the ugly cunt on the bench,
Start the chainsaw and cut her just above her cunt,
Then another vicious cut to the knees.
I throw half a body in a tub of human fat and grease,
Let it soak for the rest of the day.
I return home with a nice book to read
and a bitch to rape.

Fuck!

But first I take this beautiful lump of flesh
out of the bin its soaking in.

I wonder whats going through her head,
as I chew on a half human spread.

She tells me I'm insane, Now this bitch is in for night full of pain.
I shove her head in my oven and fuck her cunt while I watch her face melt.
As the blisters pop and explode so does my nut sack all over her back.
