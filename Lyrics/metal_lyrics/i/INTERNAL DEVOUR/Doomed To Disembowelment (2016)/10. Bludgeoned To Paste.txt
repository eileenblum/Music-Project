Iâve made up my mind to slaughter this swine, 
He cut me off in traffic now I have to cut off his legs. 
That's how it works with me, piss me off and I'll make you bleed. 
Follow him home, hot sluts wearing pink. 
Park across the road, inhumanely jerking my dick. 

Watching his wife and playing with a knife, 
Either way this bitch is going to cop it. 

Alive or dead Iâm going to fuck it. 
Either way this is bitch is going to cop it. 

He walks outside, garbage in hand. 
I leap from the car, machete in hand, 

Running at the fucking cunt, no hesitation. 
Twenty-Seven stab wounds only devastation. 

Splay him out in his front yard, removing his limbs, 
pick up the garbage bag and stuff this cunt in. 

Bludgeoned to paste, hacked up human waste. 
We couldâve been happy together but now your fucking bleeding, 

My lust is peaking, cock starts leaking 
and now the drugs start kicking in. 
My lust is peaking, cock starts leaking 
and now the sickness begins. 

Doused in petrol and set a light, what a pretty sight, 
as her skin melts I tear it off the bone and carve shapes into her smouldering flesh like a fucking jigsaw but when Iâm finished with her no one will be able to put her back together. 

Back together. 

I can hear the sirens but I donât give a fuck, 
Iâm nuts deep in this perfect slut. 

I can hear the sirens but I donât give a fuck, 
Iâm nuts deep in this perfect slut. 

Snap her neck around, make her look back at me as I arch her back and destroy whats left of her 
Deep in her perfect arse, take a look down 
Good girl she took it all. 
All. 

People just shouldnât trust in me, but I always seem to find my way in. 
In my wake I leave a trail of hacked up waste, 
thousands bludgeoned to paste. 
Paste.
