Manifesting in me, petulance and vexations. 
Confusion induced compulsions, Intrinsic vehemence. 

Slow cuts into your head. 
I like this feeling of hair, 
falling away beneath the hacksaw blade. 
Wrecking your skull as these sickening intrusions eat away. 

Voids of sullen and foul notions, 
subtle vibrations lead to violent judders, 
your teeth chatter as Iâm pushing through the last layer, 
I hate that fucking sound, now swallow your teeth cunt. 
Continuing to fucking pound, gaping hole. Bashing you violent and brunt. 

Becoming unrecognizable to the human eye, but now you look perfect to me. 
Fit for consumption, just a few more alterations. 
Your eyes sunken into the back of your head. 
I just realized Iâve beating you for 11 hours straight. 
Constant, violent blows to the chest causing your lungs to deflate. 

I look around trying to figure out where I am, 
bodies ferment and stink all around. 

Fading into darkness, forever diminishing holes seem to chew 
the insides of my soul. 

Perceptions vacate, remembering all my mistakes, 
deteriorated state and suffering I canât escape. 

Tissue stretching and contracting, anxiously twitching. 
Ligaments and bones snapping, skin is stripping. 
I canât see anything but my eyes are open, 
I donât think I can stay, my screaming starts to fade away like Iâm being taken from this place. 

Descending into misery, deep into darkness. 
Into a world where the black clouds breed despair 
and delusions beyond repair. 
This is where I belong, deep in dark figments of my mind. 
Lost in my head, lead blind into the voids of sullen.
