Livinâ The Dream 
My mind mutilated, 
Violence slowly eats it away. 
Now merging with reality, what's fucking happening? 
Iâm not like the rest, I have never loved anything. 
Dark shadows cloud my mind, vicious creativity. 
My eyes begin to see clearly now the mist is gone. 
Feeling sick to my stomach but aroused by what I've 
done! 
Awaken to my own dark fantasy, 
brick bludgeoning her fucking skull. 
My eyes begin to see clearly now the mist is gone. 
Feeling sick to my stomach but aroused by what Iâve 
done! 
What the fuck! Everything I thought was in my head, 
is right in front of me bleeding. 
Bodies strewn and covered in blood. 
Remains of the dead. 
I look around I was sleeping in a pit full of detached remains. 
I look down my cock is deep in her slit full of her fucking brains. 
Her brains. 
Fuck I love looking in their fear stricken eyes, abhorrence. 
I canât ignore the voices in my head, 
I just wish I stayed awake to hear their cries, repugnance. 
Once I choose you youâre already dead. 
Am I living in my head? Iâm a messed up type of freak. 
I feel sick and twisted inside but killing is one hell of a ride. 
Scattered limbs around me, fermenting. 
Oh Fuck! 
I feel sick and twisted inside but killing is one hell of a ride. 
Splattered skin all over me, slow rotting. 
Iâve lost it. 
Thousands lay wasted in my wake, viciously raped. 
Some are left alive to deprive, 
cutting off their hands and feet. 
Crying in pain they beg and say that they have changed. 
I prepare the feast of each others leaking meat. 
Iâm livinâ the dream, 
Iâm livinâ the dream.
