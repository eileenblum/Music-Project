Butchering this fucking whore, 
Laying dismembered on my floor, 
Swinging this clever into her cold fucking heart, 
I live and breathe to tear these cunts apart, 
You all wonder what infects my soul. 
A shitty wife or a slutty wife? 
What is inside me that I can't control? 
Obsession or possession? 
Killing my mind making me insane. 
I can't take this fucking pain. 
Clenched teeth, pick up my hammer. 
The next slut is watching on telling me to stop. 
Spit on the cunt. 
Cunt! 
Bludgeon her head with something blunt. 
Smashing her kneecaps out. 
Puncture her lungs watching blood pour from every hole. 
Laugh as she fights just to breathe. 
The beautiful sound of struggle. 
Now you know how I live my life with this knife. 

You stabbed me in the back, now I cut off your rack. 
Hang it on my wall to remind myself I settled the score. 
They tell you anything to escape. 
Present their snatch for you to fucking rape. 
Arching her back, slapping her arse. 
I fill her cunt full of broken glass. 
Both bleeding out fucking her arse. 
I won't sleep until your limbs are scattered through this shit hole. 
Until the floorboards soak up your fucking guts. 
The stains remain, reminding me I'm not sane.
