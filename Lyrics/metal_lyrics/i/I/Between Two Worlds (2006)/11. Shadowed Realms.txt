[bonus track]

[Abbath / Demonaz]

Solar worlds open to us
Days are shadowed into the realms
We pass away not alive nor dead
Souls are sleepless eternally
Blackened by lights
Burning a long time now
We leave for the end, damned again
The sun won't heal our frozen souls
Winds are rolling here
Called for the dark

Solar worlds risen from the dust
Days are shadowed into the realms
We fall away not alive nor dead
Restless souls in the deep
The fire is gone
But still it smells
Sky is burning here
Called for the dark

Respect the force
Grounded long ago
We leave for the end, damned again
We won't heal, we won't feel
One soul in the cold
Seasons are no longer here
