I ride a wind of no return
My soul is cold my mind burns
I ride my fate with all my hate
This is my search this is my state

I ride a storm of no reverse
My spirit's dark this is my curse
I journey fast this time won't last
My fate is sealed there's no reveal

The storm I ride,again and again
A soul on ice
The storm I ride until the end

I ride a war that's on my own
My will is strong I bow to none
I am my fate I breathe my hate
Into your soul you're in the cold

The storm I ride,again and again
A soul on ice
The storm I ride until the end
