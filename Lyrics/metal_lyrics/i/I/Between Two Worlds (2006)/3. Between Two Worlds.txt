Clear sights through the depths I ride
Inside my mind the thoughts I hide
I ought to bear my existence
And burn to be...

The visions that was brought to me
Not different from my fantasy
Between two worlds I am
Quested not to be

I ride beyond the realms of the past
I see the sights of what won't last
From the blinding daylight
To the utter dark

The golden winter blows a breeze
Not different from my fantasies
Dark and light far in sight
Quested not to be

Too long I have dwelled in the shadows
Too long I have slept in the shades
Too long I have searched the desires
Release me so I can awake

Stone cold in the soul
With nothing to return to

Between two worlds
Between two worlds

Clear sights through the depths I ride
Inside my mind the thoughts I hide
I ought to bear my existence
And burn to be...

The visions that was brought to me
Not different from my fantasies
Between two worlds I am
Quested not to be
