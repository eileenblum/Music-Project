Marching through the gates of fire
New battles on the rise
Breathing in the winds of war
Victorious desire deep inside

Tyrants' wrath upon this world
Bestow the might to throne
Battalions on the fields of war
To chaos we are bound

Nameless cities left behind
High fires in the air
Fear us those whose time has come
Awaiting in despair

Fury swings its blackened blades
From the sky a fire rain
Darkness marches on this night
On pride we fight

With the dying sun we ride
Into the honored age
Searching for the golden past
Bounded deep with rage

Magic moments magic times
Barbarians born to stride
Ride with splendor for the war
Battalions at our side

Fury swings its blackened blades
From the sky a fire rain
Darkness marches on this night
On pride we fight

Stories tel of fallen men
Great victories and fights
And all that rode towards the fields
To conquer thrones and might

Legends brought forward to tell
Tempting from another time
Devoted to the victories
They battled for themselves

Battalions
Battalions
