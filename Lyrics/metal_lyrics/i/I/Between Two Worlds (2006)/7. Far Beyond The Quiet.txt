[dedicated to Quorthon]

Far beyond the quiet
Where the gods no longer reign
The ice once formed the landscapes
Into mountainsides and stains
Many miles to walk here
Still so many miles to stalk
A place to be remembered
Still the story is untold

Waiting for the darkness
Lights are soon to disappear
Black clouds in the horizon
Drift away in the open air
A man stands on the hillside
Watching the blackened sky
Memorizing times from another age
Now make his soul and spirit glance like fire

See the ravens fly there
Circling in the storm
Hidden from the new world
Where the spiritless are born
Watching from his mountain
Stands a man who knows his fate
He who brought the legends
And became a god himself

Far beyond the stillness
Where the gods no longer reign
The ice once formed the landscapes

Into mountainsides and stains
The wisdom from the Dark age
He brought forward to tell
The lightening in his spirit
Strong he carried his own fate
