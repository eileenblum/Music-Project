Along the mighty mountainsides
Fog creeps beneath the tops
A winding climb upon steep mountains
To where the glacial tongue becomes my path

Upon the mighty mountains heights
These plateaus of my dreams
I am at the greatest sight of all
To where the glacial arms reach for me

Highest mountains hear my call
To you I'll guide myself
The time has come for me to reach
I'm  brought too far to turn

Tops that seem unreachable
Tower in the sky
Horizon to horizon
On platforms yield with wind

Mountains of ice calm in my sight
Platforms built by wind
Mountains of ice calm in my sight
Platforms built for kings

Along the mighty mountainsides
Fog creeps beneath the tops
A winding climb upon steep mountains
To where the glacial tongue becomes my path

Highest mountains hear my call
To you I'll guide myself
The time has come for me to reach
I'm  brought too far to turn
