It's a great day for fire
It's a great day for wrath
It's a warrior's desire
Ride down the mountainside

Blinding days on the desert
Blinding sun in my eyes
Mighty cities before us
Ride with your heads held high

Hungry hordes rode the sands
Into the open fire
I ride through savage lands
For victory and desire

Steel glimpse - waving spears
This hunger's constantly
Passing through the endless world
Where great warriors sleep

From the mountainous regions
Awakens the day
Shining armours and horses
Head to the battlefields
It's a great day for fire
It's a great day for wrath
A man's fate is his own
The world's at an end
