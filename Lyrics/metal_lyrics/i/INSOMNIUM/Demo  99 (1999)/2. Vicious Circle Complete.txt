Now it's too late
Can't you hear the calling
We are no longer safe
Mankind is falling

Close behind until you see
All is swelling in incorporeality
We are rendering a service,
Inconsequence reigns
Vicious circle completes

What have we become more than
Traitors in the face of time

Disharmony unleashed,
What would satisfy your hunger
For there is no hope,
For there is no meaning

Inanimate spirit outbreaks the silence
Strangles the motion, catches the fire
Reflections define our failures
When everything is said and done

...For there is no hope...
...For there is no meaning
