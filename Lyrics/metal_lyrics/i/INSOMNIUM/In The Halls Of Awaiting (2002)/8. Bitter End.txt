The silent moment right before the dusk fades away
I open my eyes but the darkness stays
Night frost covers the brittle flowers around you
I realize that what I dreamt is true

Beauty beyond words
My dearest one
Her light burns my eyes
She is all mine

By these frosty waters I rest by Your side
I hold you in my arms for the last time
If only I could tell you how I need Your love
If only you had seen what I kept in My heart

Now it's the time of grieving
Reign of sorrow in my heart
All i have ever wanted
Is today forever gone
Bitter is the nightly silence
Bitter till the end of time
The sky grown ever darker
Through now she'll always be mine

I hold you in my arms so tight
I kiss your frozen lips for this last time
For the first time
