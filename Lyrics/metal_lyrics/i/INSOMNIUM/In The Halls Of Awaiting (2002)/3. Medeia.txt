Where there once was love, only hatred now resides
Where I once had heart, only nothingness now dwells

Guilt-ridden shall be your days
Heart-rending your nights

By starlight I rock to sleep my dearest ones
Under the cold sky I lull to rest my darlings
Good to lie in a bed of cloudberry flowers
Soft to dream on a moss-grown pillow

Betrayed by one I loved, deceived by one I caressed
Cast into the dark, thrust into the endless night

But even bitter is your fate
Way darker your path

For nothing have I been by your side
In vain have i wasted this life
All that was fair has been marred now
All the love I gave you have emptied my heart

Soon I'll be feeling no pain 
sleeping in silent shade
The ones you cherish most
I'll take with me to my dreams

Haunted by your deeds
Wrapped into the grief
You are bound into this sorrow
Until the end of time
