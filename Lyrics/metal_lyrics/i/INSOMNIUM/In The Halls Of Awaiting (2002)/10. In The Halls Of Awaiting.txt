Evening full of grandeur, skies tinged with red
Mountains crowned with crimson, treetops with scarlet blaze
As the dusk is falling, night settles in
Stars slowly come out, moon glides skywards
...Still cheerless is in my soul, my heart filled with cares...

Longing for the misty shores, weather-beaten strands so poor
Where the weeping sky archs over water calm
Pining for primeval woods, murky shade of leafy roof
Where the silent trees arch over our path

Do you walk in mourning, still wear the grief
Raiment of sorrow, remembrance of me
Through the years of bleakness, winters of bitter cold
Will you not forget me, forsake my soul
...Low-spirited  is my song, downhearted my tune...

Beyond enchanted sea, wistful is my sleep 
Darkness by my side, through the dreary night
Will you follow me, through eternity
To another world, to the quiet halls

I've lost my way in the dark, strayed apart from my love 
I've faced the demons of might, passed away into shades

Long are lonely years, slowly pass these days
In undying land, in the divine light
Where I wait...in the dark

The black of the night turns to dusk of the dawn
Through the mist now shines the fairest light of all
The caress I've waited for eternity
Into the shades, together we fade
