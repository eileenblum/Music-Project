Somber is my mind, now that
Misfortune has faced my kind;
Weary glazed stare,
Beneath the pitch-black hair.
On my cheeks, once so alive, adorn
Flood of tears, caused by strife
And as I grieve under the sky,
Even raven croaks to me it's despise

My warm hand against your cold
Palm...
Words echoing in the air though
You're gone...

Somber is my mind,
Black is the colour I feel
These completely dead emotions,
Drain the last bit of me
No matter how many tears I've shed,
No matter how much I repent,
Some things just can't be undone
And some of us can't be forgiven.

No matter how many tears I shed,
Some things can't be undone...

I've reached the point of no return,
These are deeds from I can not flee
From a reflection I see a tired man,
Longing for a relief
Black waters in front of me
Will sway me till I'm in sleep,
Take me to the shores of Manala
Where I'll be free from my sins.
Black waters will sway me till I'm sleep...

This roaring stream will wash me
Pure and clean...
