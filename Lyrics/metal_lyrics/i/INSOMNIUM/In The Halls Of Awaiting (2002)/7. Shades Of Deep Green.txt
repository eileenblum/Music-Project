...This path leads into dark...

In shrouding veil of thickening dusk,
In the caress of darkening woods
There winds my path, narrow and fading 

Let this twilight linger, long upon me
Moon and stars take over when sun has fled
And bring her scent to me

May the blowing of winds cease
And all birds fall silent from singing
May the dreary waters lay still
And hands of time stop turning

So in forms of evening mist
I can feel her slender grace
In shades of deep green
I can drown in her tender eyes

Now that her light has gone away,
All this searching has led astray,
These turns are filled with grieving, this moments with loss

What a cruel world left for me to roam alone
What a scornful fate, took my light away

Neither the glittering dew on moors, nor the the whispering wind in dales
But only these shadows of green can remind me of her

What a cruel world left for me to roam alone
What a scornful fate, took my light away
