[Bonus track]

Another break of dawn
Forces the shadows recede
Breaks the barrier of clouds
Blaze a trail for the light

In the arms of white soil
Lies a fallen boy
Left alone to freeze to death
Grown numb in the cold

This is the new beginning
Start with a clean sheet
Redemption of the liberty
Freedom through the bloodshed

When hatred old for centuries
Poisons the minds of sane
Distrust kills all the kindness
Envy slain the ideal

Demise of spirit and flesh
No victory in death
Only the defeat remains
When the sons take fathers' lives

What good can come out of this?
Is this the price we must pay?
Redemption of the liberty
Freedom through the bloodshed

This is the new beginning
Rebirth through devastation
All the hope of a nation
In the hands of few

Another chapter in common story
Nothing new under the sun
This is the new beginning
Sad ending to others
