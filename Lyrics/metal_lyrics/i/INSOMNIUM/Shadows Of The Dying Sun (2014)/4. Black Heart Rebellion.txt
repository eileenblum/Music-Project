[Music &amp; lyrics: Friman]

Never pariah but always on one's own
Unwavering mind, black heart rebellion

Cold is the night for the ones born of shadows
Solemn is the way for the ones never restless
Cold is the night for the ones drawn to darkness
Desolate is the path of self-believers

[2x]
Never bow to anyone;
Never give in
Never surrender to anyone;
Never go astray

Morning star, angel of the dawn
Light your torch, your radiant crown
Fill the silence with trembling thunder
Light our path with glimmering eyes

Lies...
Lies will bend the minds of the weak
Life...
Life is meant to be led, not followed

Lonely is the road for the ones seeking the truth
Bleak is the trail leading to perception
But only knowledge can cure the blindness
And only knowledge can open our eyes and make us see

Never bow to anyone;
Never give in
Never surrender to anyone;
Never go astray

Morning star, angel of the dawn
Light your torch, your radiant crown
Fill the silence with trembling thunder
Light our path with glimmering eyes

Lies...
Lies will bend the minds of the weak
Life...
Life is meant to be led, not followed

Never below
Never above
On one's own
Never below
Never above
Black heart rebellion

Morning star, angel of the dawn
Light your torch, your radiant crown
Fill the silence with trembling thunder
Light our path with glimmering eyes

Morning star, angel of the dawn
Light your torch, your radiant crown
Dress the sky in ever-cold silver
Unshroud the sphere from the clouds
