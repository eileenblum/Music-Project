[Music &amp; lyrics: Friman]

Behold; never trust anyone
Every shadow shields a traitor
Always keep your friends near you
And your enemies even closer

Behold; never trust anyone
Betrayal lurks in every corner
Always keep your back against the wall
Your mind collected and focused

The crash of collapsing worlds
The crackle of burning paper
Always speak less than you know
Walk one step ahead of others

Their words cut like knives
Their words sharp as razor
But never surrender to fear
Never let them take your freedom

And remember, you'll always be alone
Since the day you choose your own path
So make sure to prepare yourself
For everything live might throw at you

Because you know your only chances are
To win this war by each battle
Merit the difference; never bow anyone
You are your own saviour

Live as if you were to die tomorrow
Learn as if you were to live forever
Stay awake while the world is sleeping
Free yourself before you disappear
