[Music &amp; lyrics: Friman]

Darkness is ignorance
Knowledge is light
Fight only with yourself
Or the shadows of the night

For this life will break you
Years will wear you down
And everyday you die a little
Until the shadows will take you

Dying doesn't make this world dead to us
Breathing doesn't keep the flame alive in us
Dreaming doesn't make time less real for us
One life
One chance
All ephemeral

All the pain and suffering
Will dispirit or feed you
For each and every time your failures
Will craft you
When the fear of them is gone
Fear is gone

We stumble and hover
At the edge of the world
One life, one chance
That's all we have

Never walk away
Turn your back on yourself
One life, one chance
That's all we have
