[Music &amp; lyrics: Friman]

We're nothing more than shadows
Light scatter of the dying sun
Just particle beams in passing
Waves riding the eternal dark

We're nothing more than shadows
Mere remnants of the distant past
Animated sparks of energy
Bursting flames of the end

We're nothing more than shadows
We grow tall then fade away
We're vessels for a surging power
With solar fire in our veins

We're nothing more than shadows
Flares blazing in a blink of an eye
We're nothing more than shadows
Glimmers of hope against the black sky

And far upon the skies
Lies the truth within
We are shadows of the dying sun

Children of infinity
Always gazing to our past
We are dust of the stars

And I feel it in my heart
And I know it in my mind
That's all, ever will be

We're the dust of the stars
