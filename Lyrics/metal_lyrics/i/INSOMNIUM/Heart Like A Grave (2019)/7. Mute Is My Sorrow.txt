[Music: Liimatainen; lyrics: SevÃ¤nen]

How could there be laughter left in these songs
How could there be mirth and joy in this world
For what am I now anymore
But a wretched old bard
Weary and torn

For all of those dreams have withered and died
For all of those hopes have vanished into the night
No grace in this voice anymore
But a wretched old bard
Forlorn and torn

But there was ever only one
The one that I would hold
The one that I still long

Mute is the sorrow of mine
Voiceless the yearning inside
Dark is the path in the end
Sore are the wounds I hide

Once there was a time when they all praised my name
Once there was a time when hearts turned to me
For even the birds hearkened to my songs
That quivered in the wind
Echoed through the night

But where is the glory, the gold and fame now
But where is the crown that once blazed on my brow
Not one by my side anymore
This wretched old bard unsung and torn

And after all the years that go by
I remember the one
The one that I still look for

Only for her I would play my tunes
Only for her I would write these words
Only to her I would sing
But she never hearkened to me
