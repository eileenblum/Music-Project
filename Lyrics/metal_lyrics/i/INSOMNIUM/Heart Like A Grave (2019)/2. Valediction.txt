[Music: Friman; lyrics: Friman/SevÃ¤nen]

Underneath the blackest soil
I lay down my warm beating heart
And deep beneath the frozen ground
I bury down my deepest thoughts

Because the road I've chosen
Is free of fortune and desire
Or the mundane toil and worry
Because the trail I've taken
Leads down into the darkest shore
Where the stars have passed away

Tonight, the world is burning
Black smoke hides the skies
Dark clouds rise up swirling
Shadows engulf the land

By the side of forsaken path
I leave behind my old shadow
Into the deep under these shores
I drown my broken memories

For something to change
Something has to give
For something to grow
Something has to yield
I kiss the light goodbye
