[Music: Vanhala; lyrics: SevÃ¤nen]

Sound of the waves
Song of the woeful wind
Beauty of yearning
The tune of my heart

For once there was a time
When I sat by your side
And right before our eyes
The world was open wide

Days of youth are long since gone
Never to return again
But a long slow descent left anymore
The waning years of heartache and regret

And yet the winds sing
They sing the fairest tune
And yet the waves sigh
They sigh out the pain

And since you set out
To reach for your hopes and dreams
I'll stay here with this hurt inside

For with these wounded wings
I never left this barren soil
Where all my wishes slowly fade away

Days of youth are long since gone
Never to return again
But a long slow descent left anymore
The waning years of heartache and regret

Do you still remember?
Would you still believe?
That this blackened soul of mine
Once was untarnished

Years of disappointment
And disillusion
All I see in the mirror now
Is an old man with a heart like a grave.

Do you still remember?
Would you still believe?
That this blackened soul of mine
Once was untarnished
