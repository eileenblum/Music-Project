Oh how it hurts inside of me
The pain of a thousand men it seems
A manifestation of all my sorrow
Personated in visions of no tomorrow

I swallowed my fears into sickness
Vomiting fragments of my former life
Divisions of damnation usurping my wasted body
Out of my inner self

I drown... I drown...

I drown in needles that used to be my thoughts
Crucifying my soul on the last standing column of vanity
The essence of my life is pain
Welcome to the bleeding of my sanity !

I will die !

I will enter eternal oblivion !

I have stopped the fighting, I am empty
Lost and alone, carrying off this plague
I count the hours, how long will it take
To furking leave this goddamned place

Hear my moaning, feel my rage
Desolation supreme, I destroy myself
I am ready to leave, detach me from the source of life
That was meant to create but only destroys... only destroys

Oh how I long for death I can't await
I still count the hours, how long will it take
The greater the pain, the larger my delight
Step by step approaching to the other side

Step by step approaching to the other side...
