Is it the darkness that guides my way through the sickening light ?
Is it the icy winds that warm me deep inside ?
My eyes staring past the forthcoming way
Into the darkest hole of all - into myself

This is the path that I walk into night
Accompanied by thoughts that I fight inside myself
The throne far beyond the limits of consciousness
The end of delusion, the tempest of truth

Tear it out - the cancer of my intellect !
Too long it dominated which path to neglect
But the way that I walk tonight,
Is free of this blinding, delusive light

Through memories of a worthless life
Through pain and mental devastation
Out of there into crystal seas I dive
Negotiating the plague called life

Manifesto invidiae, I hate that lives inside
The creed of my existence, the precursor of my everlasting night
I cannot abandon this course - there is no need
Manifesto invidiae, and finally I will be free

Lift me up to listen to the wind
Cleaning my thoughts, embracing my skin
This overwhelming act of katharsis
Embodying reluctance throughout my burning passion

So free my soul, oh you purest place
So full of hate, despise and rage
Counter my shadows for they are light
Rip me apart, receive the night

Manifesto invidiae, I hate that lives inside
The creed of my existence, the precursor of my everlasting night
I cannot abandon this course - there is no need
Manifesto invidiae, and finally I will be free

Tear it out - the cancer of my intellect !
Too long it dominated which path to neglect

Through memories of a worthless life
Through pain and mental devastation
Out of there into crystal seas I dive
Negotiating the plague called life
