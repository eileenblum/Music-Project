Empty is my mind, cold and blank
Due to thoughts that bleed into my veins
Black blood infesting blackened flesh
Willinglessly anticipating death

No emotions for what is left
I will not move, won't take a breath
Meaningless these deeds have been
Meaningless that stays unseen

Desolate solutions for desolate minds

Desolate solutions for desolate minds
Undo this life, tear out the shive
That drills so deep inside

Unfold the curtains, taste the change
Fall deep into this unbearable stench
Empty eyes that talk of elusion
Empty hands that never felt delusion

Labyrinthine paths adorn this flesh
Getting lost in eternal loneliness
Distrustful I confront this spectacle of piteousness

A maze of torment
Materialized in suffering flesh
So deep within but still no rest
Willinglessly anticipating death

Desolate solutions for desolate minds
Constructive destruction in abnormal discomposure
Forfeited, lost and corrupt statues
Rendering homage to the art of denying life
...The art of denying life
