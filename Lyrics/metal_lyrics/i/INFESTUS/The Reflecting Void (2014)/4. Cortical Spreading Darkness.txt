Out of nowhere a usurping promise
A hideous reversion into painful re-existence
A biochemical thunderstorm of relentless retrospection
The smashing hammer of blackest affection

You down-dragging force, a parasite all along
The irreversible downfall which I ever since prolong

Daze me with your black-lectric stings
In haste I surrender
Ill-lumen me with your white poison wings
You false pretender!

I can feel your defiant presence!
Cortical Spreading Darkness! 

An arcane existence from within
Cold claws soaked in sin 
carving their way into my labyrinth
I feel no pain

My trembling thoughts, just as my flesh
are diffusing into a state of painful separateness
The pulse generating white halo monster 
Is pulling the strings of my demise

Save meâ¦!

The way back is just an illusion to keep the prey alive 

I can feel your defiant presence!
Cortical Spreading Darkness!

The curse of my life, my strength for which I would die
