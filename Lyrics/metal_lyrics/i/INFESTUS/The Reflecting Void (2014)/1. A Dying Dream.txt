The crystal gates of a promising change
Distant, unreachable, the relieving faint
So far away...

Have I reached what they call freedom
by ceasing to taste the darkest sea?
But still it keeps on breathing 
in the very inside of me

A Dying Dream

Inside it is pulsating, the procreator of demise
Within, there is laughter, a darkest stare of ice

I will not surrender!
I will not let go this âsoulâ!
I will not surrender!
I will not let goâ¦
