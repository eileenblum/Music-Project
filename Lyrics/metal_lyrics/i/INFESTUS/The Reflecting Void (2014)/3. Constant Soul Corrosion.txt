This current in which I drift day in day out
Every breath taken to prolong this doubt
A wish? - No words. A fading will.

This never ending pain â a painful and infinite sustain
accompanying this life until the end

The consuming tragedy of falling quiet
The weight of the world on your shoulders
And the deafening voices within this mind
reflect the annihilating nature of constant soul corrosion

Is this the end or just the beginning of a horrendous repression?
Self perpetuating, every returning malicious beast
In your eyes I see the progenies of my aggression
The all consuming path of deceit
And still I keep on believingâ¦

The constant corrosion of my soul
Will persistently emaciate your life
And the deafening voices within this mind
are collapsing realms in a vortex of empty worlds

This current in which I drift day in day out
Every breath taken to prolong this doubt
A wish? - No words. A fading willâ¦.just a fading will

Constant Soul Corrosion
With open arms I welcome what is to come
An empty shell contains nothing that can be harmed 
I counter my doom drowned in utter emptiness
