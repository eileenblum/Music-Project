Deep within - a devouring darkness
With you and no one else I am bound to live
With you and no one else until the end of all time

No escape and no remorse for what lies behind and further
the countless times that we fed on each other
We stood as one on the brink of this abyss
yearning to finally receive the ultimate bliss

Time, within this ocean of pain
drowning outlasts a life
I am running towards a âsalvationâ
consisting of nothing but lies
And by my side an omnipresent darkness
devouring all the light

Life, within this dungeon made of flesh
I am attending a masquerade of emptiness
And by my side an omnipresent darkness
devouring all the life

Katharsis is an illusion
