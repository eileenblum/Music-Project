In my restless attempt of giving a name to my darkness
I see myself striving towards the unknown
Is it necessary to define the suffering
when it is suffering that defines all life 

The illusion of relieving obsession
A fateful companion on my darkest course
In its longing words there is no end to its deceiving persuasion
â¦no end 

Driven by the pursuit of divine fulfillment 
A human mind on the apex of destruction
Relentlessly depleting the source of life
In desperate hope to be reborn through its own creation 

I burst into pieces!

Andras: Everything
