[Music by In Apostasia, lyrics by J. Britto]

Night sky
Once again
We celebrate
Our glorious path

This lonely road
We chose to march
Persecuted
But never defeated

Never down
For we seek our strength
On our most valuable truth (roots)
Never asleep
Shields are up
This is our hunting ground

This is our killing ground
The kingdom by the sea
This is where you'll cease to be

This is my father's throne
This is my mother's womb
These are my brothers in arms

The iron on your throat
The blade right through your heart
From one who knows no remorse

The soil soaked in blood
The filthy putrid corpses
The fortune of your kind

Before the sun is up
We'll hear the creatures cry
We'll hear the wolves down south
My fathers voice shall roar

The wall of pain shall fall
Upon your disbelief
Down crushing skin and bones
We'll feast on your remains
