[Music and lyrics by J. Britto]

For the crime of heresy and for conspiring against the holly church and your holiness the pope, you shall now hang by the neck till death and your body shall be impaled, and displayed at the heart of the city as an example to others like you.

Repent yourself before you die and make peace with our lord Jesus Christ and his father, your god almighty!

I am my own god!

Hang him!
