[Music and lyrics by J. Britto]

At times, the night is dark
Times when the world outside burns in me
And the major parasite attacks

Ignoring is an option, but not for long
For it comes to feed again
Even stronger now if allowed
And fear is a thief from behind

And I confess my disbelief
How long has it been?
How many times have I found mercy?
How many times only demise?

I feel the silent death that comes quietly
As the flesh remains in numbness
Frozen as the winds outside
Quiet as the dark night sky

The weight on my chest and I can't breath
It takes away my silver, my pain and my sea
It is too soon for so much grief
And it's too late to fall asleep

Everything that lives on my footprints
But a little of what I am is always lost
And I keep on dissolving through time

Another night, one less fragment of me
