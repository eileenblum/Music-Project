[Music and lyrics by J. Britto]

Iâ¦ I remember when death
Arrivedâ¦ in ships from the north
Emergingâ¦ from ice cold waters
Thinkingâ¦ itself as god

Bewareâ¦ all of you sinners
Bewareâ¦ men of no faith
Bewareâ¦ the lake of fire
Bewareâ¦ you'll all burn in hell

In their mouthsâ¦ the news of a god
In their handsâ¦ the knives and crosses
The offerâ¦ redemption from the sins
In their voiceâ¦ words of betrayal

Bewareâ¦ all of you sinners
Bewareâ¦ men of no faith
Bewareâ¦ the lake of fire
Bewareâ¦ you'll all burn in hell

They burned the land
They killed the children
They raped the women
They skinned the men

Iâ¦ I am the Antichrist
Iâ¦ renounce thy faith
Iâ¦ I fuck your virgin mother
Iâ¦ I spit your other face
