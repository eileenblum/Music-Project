[Music and lyrics by J. Britto]

Warâ¦ warâ¦ warâ¦
Gather your weapons

Warâ¦ warâ¦ warâ¦
We'll have our revenge

Gather all your weapons
The enemy is upon us
Cowardly they hide
Now is time to strike

Our sword and our pride
Shall be end of their line
No fear, no remorse
Attack and take no prisoners

Warâ¦ warâ¦ warâ¦
Gather your weapons

Warâ¦ warâ¦ warâ¦
We'll have our revenge

Through the river and beyond the valley
March through the land of our forefathers
We were hunting in these woods
Long before they arrived

With their god, and his salvation
Murdering and rapping our land
With their lies and diseases
Now we'll have our revenge

Have them on their knees
Make them slowly bleed
No mercy and no compassion
Through the mist we'll hunt

In the silence of the night
The screams of agony
As they fall under our blades
Praying to their god
