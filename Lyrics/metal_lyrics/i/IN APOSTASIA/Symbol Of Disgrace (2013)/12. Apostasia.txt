[Music and lyrics by J. Britto]

Renounce thy nature
And thy long weak roots
Must break the shackles
That keeps you blind

My pride stands tall
For I am alone
No god or faith
Besides myself

Crush the parasites
Crush the liars
Crush the hypocrites
Crush the liars

Just look outside
You may see the truth
All Judging priests
Are they better than you?

Renounce thy nature
And thy long lost week roots
Burn down the bible

And all holly books

Crush the parasites
Crush the liars
Crush the hypocrites
Crush the liars

I am god
