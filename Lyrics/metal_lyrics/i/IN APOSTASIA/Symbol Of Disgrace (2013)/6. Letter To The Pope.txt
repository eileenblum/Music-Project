[Music and lyrics by J. Britto]

Murdererâ¦ [3x]
Killer in the name of god!

Sitting on your throne of blood
Writing hypocritical laws
Who the hell do you think you are
To tell the world what's right or wrong?

Sitting on your throne of shit
Throne of lies, you hypocrite
Holly man I'll have your head
Bleeding on my stake.

Begging for forgiveness
On your kneesâ¦ as you die

Crying to a god
Who's is not thereâ¦ as you die!
