[Music and lyrics by J. Britto]

Try not for you'll fail
To set faith in my heart
With the old lunacy
That the fire shall burn

Wake Up!

"It is god's will"
An excuse for carnage
Hostility is the law
He'll forgive all your sins

Searching for paradise
You've created hell on earth
A place of disgrace
Consumed by disease

Slaves of yourselves
Blinded by your faith
