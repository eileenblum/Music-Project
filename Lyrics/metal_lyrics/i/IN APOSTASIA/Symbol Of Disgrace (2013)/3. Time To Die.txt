[Music and lyrics by J. Britto]

Now the sun is down
And it's your time to die
Looking in the distance
Beyond the forest outside

The dark night is here
The wood burns on the ground
Praying for forgiveness
On your time to die

The moonlight. The fire
The cold windsâ¦ on my skin

The wolf cries. My blade shines
Your bloodâ¦ on the ground

Crying you squeal like a pig
You will not find mercy in my eyes
Praying shall not save your life
Your good god has left you here to die

My blade sinks deep in your throat
And now I can see all the fear in your bleeding eyes
You're quiet as drown on your own blood
I stand on my feet and laugh on your lest breath
