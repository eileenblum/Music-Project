[Verse]
A simple explanation
Can often clear the doubt
Which some of us can feel
Should we let, sleeping dogs lie

Inside the mind exists
A fragile breeding place, for ignorance and fear
Which shelters the shame

[Bridge]
No-one, person is ever the same
No-one, person is ever to blame

[Chorus]
[backing vocal] Slowly, slowly
No matter what the cost, secrets exposed
Slowly, slowly
A pandora's box, is harder to close

[Verse]
The evil that men do, the hidden secrets
Aren't they better left alone
So why, prolong the pain

[Repeat Bridge &amp; Chorus]

[Middle-8:]
Don't search any deeper
If pandora has wings.. then there's no turning back

[Solo]

[Repeat Chorus]
