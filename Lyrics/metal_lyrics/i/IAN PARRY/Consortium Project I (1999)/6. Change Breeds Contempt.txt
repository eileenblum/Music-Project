[Verse]
See how we waste our enegy
To protect our lives our primal instinct
Insignificant ways... paramount
There must be more than this
It's like a reservoir of hate

[Bridge]
All indifference, signifies
We're unprepared, for change
No reluctance is, very rare
When shall we walk, in one direction

[Chorus]
Change breeds contempt, and misery
When you fight it, we're history
Change breeds contempt, instinctively
Have faith not, hostility

[Verse]
It's hard to reach society
The methods they all praise, inspires complacency
Is this why we're so afraid

[Repeat Bridge &amp; Chorus]
