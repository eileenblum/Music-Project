[Verse]
If I play the waiting game
When the world's not waiting 'round for me
How will I achieve the things
Others seem so easily to reach
...Why must this be?

[Bridge]
Is this somebody elses dream
'Cos I'm unable to see my face
No motivation
Bashing my head on the concrete floor

[Chorus]
Criminals, acting like kings
Criminals, acting like, criminals and kings

[Verse]
Citizens with empty heads
Second class that's how we're meant to stay
All caged up like animals
Just keep 'em fed, and they'll do as you please
...Why must this be?

[Repeat Bridge &amp; Chorus]

[Ad-libs:]
You know your place... Don't believe a word!
