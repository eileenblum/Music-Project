[Verse]
Throughout my life, I've travelled around
It's time to stop and say
A miracle... is what we need

I know it seems hard this way
I'm not the one who made, these fatal rules
We live by every day

[Bridge]
It isn't make believe
The images are real

[Chorus]
A miracle, is all we need
A miracle, as time keeps, it keeps tickin'

[Verse]
It's true someone should say
I didn't wanna be the one, to tell the truth
While others turn away

[Repeat Bridge]

[Chorus]
A miracle, is all we need
A miracle, as time keeps, it keeps tickin'
A miracle, to help us see
A miracle, 'cos time just keeps on slipping away

[Solo]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Ad-libs:]
Time keeps tickin' on
