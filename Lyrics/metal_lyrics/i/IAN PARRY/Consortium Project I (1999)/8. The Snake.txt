[Verse]
Like the snake
You crawled around
Now nobody likes you
Constantly sneakin' about

[Bridge]
Where is it written
Be cruel to be kind

[Chorus]
Don't pity, don't you pity me
Not a single friend in sight
No pity please, luck is running out
They're all to blame

[Verse]
So much hate
You've wondered why
Such an obvious answer
The friends that you had, you'd buy

[Repeat Bridge &amp; Chorus]

[Bridge]
Your skin keeps on changing
You think like the snake

[Solo]
[Repeat Chorus]

[Ad-libs:]
They're all to blame... it isn't me
