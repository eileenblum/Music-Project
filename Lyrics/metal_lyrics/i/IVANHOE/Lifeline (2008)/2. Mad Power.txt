I canÂ´t look in your face
I don`t want your embrace
You try to dominate my art and space

And don`t forget that I try
so hard to accept
all of your delusion and vanity

You're running round in circles
You give advice and high moral outrage
Keep following your, follow your, follow your round
Fulfill confinement by yourself

Keep the distance to me
Keep your eyes away
I will raise my powers
I will destroy........

Don`t cross!!!
I will rock you with old forgotten
Mad bad power
Don`t cross!!!
I will rock you with old forgotten
Mad bad power
My mad bad power, my mad bad power

I canÂ´t get no relief
you caused anger and deep
In my heart your vision holds me down

No way to care for myself
No chance to lock up my shelter
Hold on to my myths to carry on

What if all the good times
all the red lines are lost in conversion
they follow me, follow me, follow me down
Respect my border if you'd like to stay

Keep the distance to me
Keep your eyes away
I will raise my powers
I will destroy........

Don`t cross!!!
I will rock you with old forgotten
Mad bad power
Don`t cross!!!
I will rock you with old forgotten
Mad bad power
My mad bad power, my mad bad power
