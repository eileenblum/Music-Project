Visions of a healed world
Summerwinds and snow
We should take care and yes we must share our place on earth

I know that you will fall behind to stay unseen
The strangest thing you do is searching for a loosing streak
The world we live in is only measured by our science
The way we live goes on like this an ocean full of lies

Can you imagine what I feel
When all the raging thoughts never cope with your will
Immaculate decisions
your customerÂ´s delight
No human agenda
a mockery for your life

Nobody will, nobody will face the light
TheyÂ´re tired of fights
Nobody talks, nobody cares whatÂ´s right
They all leave in the night

I care too much what you say
And what IÂ´ve been told
I know that you wonÂ´t look into my eyes
If I cried

I know that you would die to get a piece of love
But all you do is walkinÂ´ to security and laws
And as you travel by ship across the sea
ThereÂ´s nothing more than dollars for your rational relief

Can you imagine what I feel
When all the raging thoughts never cope with your will
Immaculate decisions
your customerÂ´s delight
No human agenda
a mockery for your life

Nobody will, nobody will face the light
TheyÂ´re tired of fights
Nobody talks, nobody cares whatÂ´s right
They all leave in the night
