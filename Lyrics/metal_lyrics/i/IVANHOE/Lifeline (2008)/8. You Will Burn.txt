Feeling the power
Hunting her beautiful aura
Get the ring, her sacrifice
I know she`s with me
My daughter you won`t have to fear all the secrets
All of my madness

Christian insanity
Deep cryptic, you getting strange
As the youngest child
Your spell of illusions
Where are the chosen gods
To keep you-away from yourself
Dark realm shall disappear
Let it all begin

Somewhere you'll burn in fire
I hope you're on your way
Someday you'll burn in fire
I hope you're on your way

Wondering, searching
For the beauty in her life
Curious but she's just reflecting your cries
Lucifers crusade
Justice is worthless you`re guilty of what you`ve done
A Monster's mind

Christian society
They saw you down by cross
At the altar
The creed of your damn life
Where are the chosen gods
To keep you-away from yourself
Your dark realm shall disappear
Let it all begin

Somewhere you'll burn in fire
I hope you're on your way
Someday you'll burn in fire
I hope you're on your way
