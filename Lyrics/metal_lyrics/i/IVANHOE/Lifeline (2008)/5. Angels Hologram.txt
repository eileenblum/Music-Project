Why
I still feel the pain
It doesnÂ´t let me go
Are you just a picture now?
A picture for my pain
That`s anyway
in my lifeline

A perfect hologram
Cause you get hurt by life
Ohh........before you die
No, no I think the painÂ´s just the fact
I canÂ´t hear you laughing - again

Your pictureÂ´s alive
My pictureÂ´s a lie
Your pictureÂ´s alive
My picture........

I'm shy
I dare to touch
It`s hard to realize
Are you just a picture now?
Are you free from this prison
I'm living in?
Far beyond your spirit there

I saw the skyline
do you paint the sky?
Ohh....I see your smile

No, no please stay a while
It feels so strong, it must be real time and again

Your pictureÂ´s alive
My pictureÂ´s a lie
Your pictureÂ´s alive
My picture........

Your picture alive--Your picture a lie?--My picture alive?-- My picture......

Your pictureÂ´s alive
My pictureÂ´s a lie
Your pictureÂ´s alive
My picture........

ItÂ´s my own private cage
it`s something I like
I think IÂ´m a friend of pain but...
I don`t want to call myself a victim
I really enjoy this kind of pain - it shows me IÂ´m still with you and you're still with me
I love you.........I love you
