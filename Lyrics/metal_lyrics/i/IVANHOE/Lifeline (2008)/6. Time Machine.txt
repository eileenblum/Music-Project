I gotta extricate myself from here
To find my own religion
I need a travel close to the speed of light
But my time is running out
I never thought I`d feel this way
I wanna crack my incarnation
Like a rusty nail stuck in my brain
This dream won`t disappear

The structure of the world as far as our science can reveal it
All I know is I want to move in seconds from sunlight to moon

Oh what is it for, remonstrative religion
With no motion in our hearts
Oh it is a lie, systematically repeated
To build the brain-dead man

Let me live inside a time machine
Gonna be here and there and kill myself for a while
Let me live inside the time machine
No one there to fear my style

I will create a new cosmic string
I will travel to your smile
I wanna dream like elements so fast
Kiss my grandma for a while
I escape this snobby place and change it
Turn everything to love
Can do everything without a risk
Stretch the universe

Oh what it is for, remonstrative religion
With no motion in our hearts
Oh it is a lie, systematically repeated
To build the brain-dead man

Let me live inside a time machine
Gonna be here and there and kill myself for a while
Let me live inside the time machine
No one there to fear my style
