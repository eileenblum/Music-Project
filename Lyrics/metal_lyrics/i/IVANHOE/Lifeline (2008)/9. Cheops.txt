Long ago far away
They built a pyramid in desert sand
Precise as a razorblade
Khufus obsession the greatest impression
A dream becomes a massive force
Desert ships are sailing through this land
Through all our lifetime and the centuries
Everyone fears time but the time fears the pyramid
But soon our life is history......so

Who creates the great pyramid?
Who creates the great home of the king?
All the memories in all these years
A life to create the 'tomb'

We all go trough life
And textbooks told us about the universe
But here`s a wisdom far beyond our science
Desert ships are sailing through this land
Trough all our lifetime and the centuries
Everyone fears time but the time fears the pyramid
And soon our live is history

Who creates the great pyramid?
Who creates the great home of the king?
All the memories in all these years
A life to create the 'tomb'

Desert ships are sailing through this land
Trough all our lifetime and the century`s
Every one fears time but the time fears the pyramid
But soon our live is history......so

Who creates the great pyramid?
Who creates the great home of the king?
All the memories in all these years
Of hope and anger, theyÂ´re fadinÂ´ away
Thousands and more, alive to create the 'tomb'
