If I cry for you contritely
If I knew you all along the line
If all the things will flow
we truly never know

No matter how to
or who to (blame)
or how long
I donÂ´t know who you are
the words are hard to find

No way -- dont try to hide or find me, I stay in here
ItÂ´s too hard, things we struggle through this lifetime all apart

There`s a thing we both deny
WeÂ´re creatures suffering inside
But all we need to know
This spirit's compromise

Falter from under
to flash a wonder
and prise our soul
I don`t know where we are
so far
two of a kind

No way - don`t try to hide or find me, I stay in here
ItÂ´s too hard, things we struggle through this lifetime all apart
No way - don`t try to hide or find me, I stay in here
ItÂ´s to hard, things we struggle through this lifetime all apart

No way - don`t try to hide or find me, I stay in here
ItÂ´s too hard, things we struggle through this lifetime all apart
No way - don`t try to hide or find me, I stay in here
ItÂ´s to hard, things we struggle through this lifetime all apart
