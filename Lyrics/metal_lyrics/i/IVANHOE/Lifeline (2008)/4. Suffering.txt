Another time you seize my day
Wont you try another way
I am not the one you love
you cast the spell so take it off me
Offerings easy to see
You warm me in your pillory
Offensive is your style of play
Reflections for what`s holy

Infection of my faith
Betray my soul itÂ´s suicide
Use all worries I am in
To get me out of pain
and make me suffering

Youre wrapped around my soul
Warmin` my mind
Just trying all the time
Let`s get suffering
Wrapped around my thoughts
Leaving us behind ......dying all the time
Wrapped around my soul
Warmin` my mind

Suddenly I'm on your way
You love it if IÂ´m here to stay
You are not the one I love
So don`t pretend and take it off me

Fairy tale it`s not for me
It`s like a living misery
All the tricks to get me in
Reflections for whatÂ´s holy

Infection of my faith
Betray my soul itÂ´s suicide
Use all worries I am in
To get me out of pain
and make me suffering

YouÂ´re wrapped around my soul
Warmin` my mind
Just trying all the time
Let`s get suffering
Wrapped around my thoughts
Leaving us behind ......dying all the time
Wrapped around my soul
Warmin` my mind
