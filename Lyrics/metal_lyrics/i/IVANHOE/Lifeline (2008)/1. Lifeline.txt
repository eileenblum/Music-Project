Trapped in myself
I was blinded by a fool
I am breaking my own rule
in the heat of the day

Follow my heart
There is someone to be found
Somewhere around
but my fortune has failed
my fortune has failed

And IÂ´m burning out

Watch me dying while IÂ´m running out of time
I am the fool I see, inside my painful memory
Watch my lifeline shift backwards while IÂ´m trying
In present history no distance will save me

Make up my mind
And I haven`t any clue
See everything I`ve done
from a dark point of view

The past is now
For awareness for myself
I am on the shelf
cause my fortune has failed

And IÂ´m burning out

Watch me dying while IÂ´m running out of time
I am the fool I see, inside my painful memory
Watch my lifeline shift backwards while IÂ´m trying
In present history no distance will save me

Watch me dying while IÂ´m running out of time
I am the fool I see, inside my painful memory
Watch my lifeline shift backwards while IÂ´m trying
In present history no distance will save me
