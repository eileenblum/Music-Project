So cold inside the dark
Memories went away
Hear the answers of the questions asked before
But they've closed the door
For you
Oh when he closed his eyes

Darkness in the mirror he thought
He'll never die
Well he knows, he kept a dream alive (for himself)
Now the time has came
The time to keep your soul free
It's time to fly

Sometimes he sleeps
Sometimes he's not alone
Waiting for a better life
It's so simple but it's dangerous to play
And dreams went away

Now as he closed his eyes
Shades of life, a whisper tells you only lies
Cut your heart into two pieces black and white
When you try too much the only truth lives
Side by side with you
Eternal light see the face
They're knockin at your door
Eternal light whispers in his ears

He will never fly the echoes in his mind
To find the only way a better place to be
So naive a life to learn
To call, to reach or fall
When it's time
Time to fly away from tome
Darkness descends, and no, no-one will ever knows

See the light feel its cold
It's another world
All that he had all he lived for
Can't stay here anymore
