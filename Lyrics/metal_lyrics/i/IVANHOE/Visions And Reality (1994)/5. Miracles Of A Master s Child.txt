When you hear the sirens
Like whispers in the night
Cold and dark alone outside
Do we live in harmony
If you dream about freedom
Solutions peacefully
Can't believe cause nothing's done
Is this the right place to be?

Oh where the night comes down
No-one will be around
But you can't understand
No harmony, no place to be
No-one can run or hide

Can you see what they've done before
Only behind your closed door
Don't you know, what you're missing now
Can't you feel

Do not believe the lies
No-one told you what's wrong or right
The answer is made from fantasy
But you can fly

Who can believe
Running side by side
Dream until your father dies
Don't touch the needle into the sky
The light inside your eye
(It's the) miracle of a master's child
When the clock strikes four
Your rhythm can't be ignored
When it surrounds your mind
Oh look, look inside their eyes
The freedom that money buys
It's not the answer
So stay behind

Piece by piece you'll fly away
And when you want you'll die one day
Do you see black before your eyes
You can fly
When you're dreaming, you're screaming
Turn the pages and you'll see them
All the news and the obituaries
Is this the real world?

What you believe
Take a look inside
Into the real world, and see the light
Tales from a world beyond
No hope, no life, no-one
It takes the miracle from a master's child

Don't let'em be screaming
Wake up stop your dreaming
Talk about it with your feeling
So you can escape them
Talk about it with an open mind
Believe yourself don't trust the lies
And you'll know you're innocent
