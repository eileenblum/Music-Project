Lost in the labyrinth of a sunken dream
You hear my screams are without power,
Reality has cut the dream like a knife
I recognized now it's over

Can't you see, what they've done to me,?
In democracy it's called morality
Now I need a place to hide and see
A possibility to fly away

My brain is desolate as all my life,
It's the result of all my honour
Now I just ask me for the reason why,
I recognized now it's over
Can't you see, what they've done to me,?
In democracy it's called morality
Now I need a place to hide and see
A possibility to fly away

You can't help me!
The war is over and I feel
It hadn't change the world
You can't help me
Now I'm feelin' left alone, on my way
Fly away don't wanna stay,
Wanna fly away
