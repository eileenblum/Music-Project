Leave the past behind
Forget abort those times
Live your life honestly
Can't understand and can not see

Come realize your dream
Do you believe - what you see?
Slaves of a different kind
So many dreams - no open mind
Can you forgive those hearts
Rebellion and indecision

Something in the morning light
Take a look to the other side
Silent screams in the sky
No-one knows just really why
If you'll survive this night
Tomorrow starts another fight

Following a defense
Rebellion is pestilence
Don't believe the lies
Better not leave the blind behind
