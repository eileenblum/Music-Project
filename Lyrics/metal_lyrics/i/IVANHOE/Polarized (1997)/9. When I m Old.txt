Now here I sit alone
Still see your smile while you sleep my son
And when you call out my name
You know wherever I am
I can see it in your eyes
There's no kind of fear inside
I want you the way I do
I only want to be like you!

Sometimes when you cry my sweet child
I'll come inside don't fear
Cause I'm here all time
Nightmares will be mine
We're lost in a game full of joy
See your smile know you, you're my only one
You're my brightest sun

When, whenever you're around
I want to be with you
When I hear your sound
I know a dream came true

Oh can you tell me: Where are you now
When our life's like an ocean
Where are you now
When we're sailing across the sea

And all the things you fear
Don't be shy soon they'll disappear
Oh yes I'm telling you
Things to leave and: You don't have to do...

No sun in my heaven
Without you every morning at seven
Show the world your love
And the sun will rise above

And when I got old
You still will be the same
And hold, hold on to your dreams
Together we'll join the game
Someday you will tell me.

Where are you now
When our life's like an ocean
Where are you now
When we're sailing across the sea
