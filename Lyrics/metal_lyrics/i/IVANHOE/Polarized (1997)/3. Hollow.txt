Do you still know their names
Do you believe in flames
Any reflections now in their eyes?
Can you turn the time
You've not been inside
And the reason for...
They've never reached the sky
Do you hear me
Do you feel the memories you won't forget
Can you save 'em
Can you take 'em to a better place to rest?

We thought 'bout justice?
More than a word
Falling meanings I've never heard
Grab, hold your dreams
Who knows what it means
No-one cares but they're all right
Open your eyes and realize

Till you come down to me
Living your believe
Close your eyes to see
Oh will you live the dream

They have to stay together somewhere
Over the edge they're alone
There's no remainder of what's happening
So cry and your tears mean one thing
Everything neverything
Now where is the laughter
And where is the time

They call it fate and they'll soon forget
Unclear reasons will never end
Now you've found your peace
Pleasant memories
Someone has seen the sign before
Now it's time to close the door.

Till you come down to me
Living your believe
Close your eyes to see
Oh will you live the dream
