Darkness is falling
They reach for my soul
I can't see a hole in my brain
Since my self-destruct you know
Oh I can't believe they wanted you
Now I live like a shadow
Can't handle the truth
No fear no eyes no tears!

Dance with myself
Far away from the shadows
Realize it's a million to one
It can make you cry feels so good inside
We try to find a saving solution
Old frozen memories of the mind
No-one should ever find

The times have changed
Falling into disarrance
Something between us
Your eyes are so strange
Fall down from the sky
Loneliness inside
Now cry and fill the shadows with the....

Souls of fire
They're falling between us
Falling inside
Still falling between us
Far away from the sun

Memories have slipped away
Emotions have changed
I can't believe we're patients of no-one
Everytime spreading the old ones disease

Now we cry
Spread the disease it's so close to your dead life
They won't survive my trial yes
An other black hole in the killing zone
A little more mad in the methedrome
I've wasted my time in the shadows
Yes solutions
Solutions.

The times have changed
Falling into disarrance
Something between us
Your eyes are so strange
Fall down from the sky
Loneliness inside
Now cry and fill the shadows with the....

Souls of fire
They're falling between us
Falling inside
Still falling between us
Far away from the sun
