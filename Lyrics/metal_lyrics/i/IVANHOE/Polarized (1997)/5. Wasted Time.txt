A code of corruption no-one really cares
You and your first blood on a throne of despair
Know that you can take
Their lives every single soul
Preacher, your only friend trouble to beware
They kill the truth help me and myself
Fly with me to the moon
Your healing hands defends
Now they touched my innocence my angel walks away
Help I cried for this real life I've never seen before

Please try to find a way
One line one crime
Holy stairs inside

Wasted time
Now feel my love I'm over you
Wasted time
Would you choose to walk away

Love me or you won't forget
Hate me and you'll hear my step
Help me and you'll understand
Touch me and you'll burn your hand
Memories of humanity
Burning in your mind
Sanctuary
From a grim regime
Another part of mine
They take no prisoners
Children follow me
Face the facts of present day
A space-age hideaway.

Please try to find a way
One line one crime
Holy stairs inside

Wasted time
Now feel my love I'm over you
Wasted time
Would you choose to walk away
