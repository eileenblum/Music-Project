The freedom in your eyes
Solutions of fate
Still you try
You're never satisfied
Sometimes you hear the bell
Now gone again alone
Close the door step inside
But you can't hide

You miss the fragrance of the flowers
Breathing air on top of the hills
Open your eyes and watch the white coat
A friend has gone farewell
Frustrated visions return of the truth
Welcome home inside your cage
Cheap old pictures on the sidewalls
Another needle control the rage

The fire and the flood
Some hurt themselves
Some never would
The fire and the flood
Now I reach the sky
Thought I never could
The fire and the flood
Don't fear the pain
I know I should
The fire and the flood
Reject yourself
Try to shoot

Now you have no fear
Use words that hurt yourself
No reason for
But still you cry
Living torture living sin
Beyond the edge your suffering
Crucify yourself
But there's no-one else

Washed away the tears of sorrow
Where your restless mind will sleep
An illusion-trip you follow
Some faith you'll keep
Here comes the flood
Here's paradise
Whipping yourself now satisfied?
In chains your end is near
You are the one you fear!

The fire and the flood
Some hurt themselves
Some never would
The fire and the flood
Now I reach the sky
Thought I never could
The fire and the flood
Don't fear the pain
I know I should
The fire and the flood
Reject yourself
Try to shoot
