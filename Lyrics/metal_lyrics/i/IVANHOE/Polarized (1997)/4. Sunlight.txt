Hear the thunder in the sky
No-one knows the reason why
I can feel the trouble's running through my veins
Hold they key unlock the door
Tell me what's the reason for
Can you make the fear a silly kind of nevermore
You are not the holy kind
You are not a stupid mind
Are you just another part of a killing game
What is right and what is wrong
Ask the priest: What's going on
And the gates will be open to your soul

Lords and thieves still it seems
Like you don't believe me
Through the rust and the gasoline
To the neon dream
Welcome to my world

It was the light it was the sun
I'm telling you my friend it never ends
To find the only-one
It was the light it was the sun
Sometimes we ask the ourselves we pray for health
Who knows what's right or wrong

You taught me everything I know
Criminal mind machines ready to go
Communication breakdown a child cries
For these cold bodies no sunlight shines

Can you believe what's it for
Do you still feel your soul
Down inside down in the light
This is your real mind.

It was the light it was the sun
I'm telling you my friend it never ends
To find the only-one
It was the light it was the sun
Sometimes we ask the ourselves we pray for health
Who knows what's right or wrong
