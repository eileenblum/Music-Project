Behind the silhouette
Who's running through the night
Sirens around someone shouts: Orders and rights
Madness joins the chase a human life in disgrace
No clear sky
Another day another world same sun another lie
They won't remember yesterday the future dies
History must change
We're here to arrance the mind!

Everything we do needs to be true
Everyone follows the perfect view
Over my shoulder emotions went colder
They use the same words until they say good-bye!

Misery
Suffering
Still we feel it
Can you hear me: This crying now

The best of times have gone
Ignored and tossed away
Emotions killed our message leads to the new way
Need to justify
Dreams you rely
Follow your mind.

Everything we do needs to be true
Everyone follows the perfect view
Over my shoulder emotions went colder
They use the same words until they say good-bye!

Misery
Suffering
Still we feel it
Can you hear me: This crying now
