Now in some other way searching for a different stage
With the toys in your hand and that young old face

Doctor Mad watch how you play
and if you have no luck today
You are one who's on the doctor's way
In a doctor magazine you have nothing to say

You scream but no one hears what you have to say
You scream but no one listens to your pray
You scream but no one hears what you have to say
You scream but no one listens to your pray

You wake up in fear
Doctor Mad is near
All you want is the ultimate dream
But doctor mad puts you on his genius machine

Oh I hear the angels calling my name in flame
You scream but no one hears what you have to say
You scream but no one listens to your pray
You scream but no one hears what you have to say
You scream but no one listens to your pray

Tell me why when no one listens to...
Jesus, where is your sign? I try to believe!
I try and I hope! Just keep on to my faith?
Tell me! Just tell me! Will I live? Will I die?

In here?
