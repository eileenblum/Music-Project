I went crazy till
I realize the useless thrill
Your soul is packed with Gom Jabbar
Yes you've come too far

Ain't got no perfect heart
And who's got one anyway

This is your time your liberty
You should be free

You're waiting for tomorrow
And for a better time, no sorrow
Out of your suffering, fall into your old example
Hold on to what makes you strong this time

Save me, is your eternal cry
Your only goal's to lose the game
The easy way to play insane
A wicked angry man with your bitter tin can
Right â to find the ground, you have to go down

Just leave your pain, this low degree, for liberty

You're waiting for tomorrow
And for a better time, no sorrow
Out of your suffering, fall into your old example
Hold on to what makes you strong this time
