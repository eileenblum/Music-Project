Oh did you know, did you know you're killing me?
And did you know did you know you threaten our lives?
And did you know did you know where I could be?
When the rest of our life lost the ground

Speculations â the game of infinity
Lucky winners deny all that's lost in one day
Higher circles are saved by society.
And the rest of the world will be doomed to fail

Enter Protection
Fighting the cause â die happy without any reflection
The enemy's right â the fascist, the fear
Enter the court, enter the court

For the rich â For the poor
Play the rich â Play the poor
Play the rich â And the poor
And the rich â And the poor

You sell â we bleed
Keep on fighting the war of the centuries
Hollow words ââ not real
Just to feed the perverted mind machine
Destroy unity
War against the love of the centuries
Safe your wisdom, and let us go into your cube
