The entire world of people
choose wrong paths to find the right
We're praying here alone
And we suffer to our bones
We're searching for a real love
While we try to touch it with a glove

It's a gift if you can find a way to confine 
your adoption of feigned comfort here
Cause you will realize the misery around you is made invisible

Under, don't you know we all get blinded by a System
And believe it's evolution of our wisdom
Full of fear just to break out of systematrix

Praise our Symbiotic Predator
Enjoy yourself and please consider... do not think!
Praise our Symbiotic Predator
While not far away families fade into poverty

To continue as we did, it would mean to knit with the grid,
Can't you taste the dead pale flavor
Perhaps this is the price
If we hide the truth and not recognize the signs

Failure, to feed our culture as a culture of reptilians,
Manipulated, I'm as stupid as the Billions
our luxury is paid with the blood of poor people

Praise our Symbiotic Predator
Enjoy yourself and please consider... do not think!
Praise our Symbiotic Predator
While not far away families fade into poverty

Praise our Symbiotic Predator
Regardless of the consequence of our own values
Praise our Symbiotic Predator
The consciousness of the consciousness...
is the circle loyal to the system

Praise our Symbiotic Predator
Drawing pictures for a while
Under his reign, everything feels comfortable
Praise â we're lying-on a beach "all inclusive"
While not far away families fade into poverty
