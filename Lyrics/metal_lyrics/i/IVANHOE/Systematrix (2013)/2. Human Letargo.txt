There's one thing that won't: change
We know we have to: rearrange

All that we say, or cry, or pray or do
Stand and; believe, this time this point, this view
Nothing in history will ever be the same
Humans still change our world in everybody's name

Tonight it seems she talks to me
Of everything that's gonna be
We take too long to understand
Just like drifting continents

There's one thing that won't: change
We know we have to: rearrange

Even sometimes we build then break our rules
I still believe we change, look back, we always do
Remember building' kingdoms with bloody slavery
Or witches burn for Rome, religiously

Tonight it seems she talks to me
Of everything that's gonna be
We take too long to understand
Just like drifting continents

Outside, outside, outside our mind an early view
Kingdoms come and go and now we fly to the moon
Rocket ships to mars, escape the border of our universe

Tonight it seems she talks to me
Of everything that's gonna be
We take too long to understand
Just like drifting continents
