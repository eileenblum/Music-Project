You are still not satisfied with
Everything you see around
Some force deep inside you
Pushes your mind

Who is the observer
Are we all speculations
Quantum mechanics, is this reality?

In the past you've seemed to hold on to...
The established state of science
But one thing's for sure
To hold back is wasting time

Hold on!
This is "your limit don't move further
You'll crash the border of your mind
There will be nothing you can count on
Just an endless space

If you don't there's no one starting
And for this the world doesn't care
Something that you can't believe in
Always be there

Something you never thought of
Will bring our peace of mind
Forces no one believes in
Always, everywhere

Come on and just except there's 
so much more we can take

And now you trust in more than just one sight...
Our established state of science

Is just a part of all
And all is always one

Hold on!
This is your limit don't move further
You'll crash the border of your mind
There will be nothing you can count on
Just an endless space

There's just one way to carry on
Reset our mind we must be strong
Cause all the things we cannot see
Are waiting here for you and me
