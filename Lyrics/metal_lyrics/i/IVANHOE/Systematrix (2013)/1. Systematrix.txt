Systematrix Brother
With no less cash in time.
A credit seducer and you'll be fine
Get your state of mind, your style

Systematrix Sister
I wonder how you've been betrayed
You pay the price to move this spinning wheel
You feed with your hand

Systematrix Brother
Searching the fine line, think of it all
You have to disguise, you could analyse and take hold

Systematrix Sister
can you see how you've been shoved
and see how you're resolved, to fake your helping hand

Here is my place, here, you make me cry
Here I want to die

Open your heart, open your mind
Don't let me stay here in this cage all blind
With your selfish behavior
Is it the time when you think it's right?
Is it the way? I know that you can't believe it this time!
Is it the time where you think it's right?
Is it the way? I know that you can't believe this time!

Don't let me cry, don't let me die
Don't make me wish to fly...

Systematrix Father
looking at the screen
You need a contagious mystery
for the sake of false detection

Systematrix Mother
To misconceive the love
Affection for the bastard
and hatred of your son

Open your heart, open your mind
Don't let me stay here in this cage all blind
With your selfish behavior
Is it the time when you think it's right?
Is it the way? I know that you can't believe it this time!
Is it the time where you think it's right?
Is it the way? I know that you can't believe this time!

Don't let me cry, don't let me die
I don't wanna leave the cage to live in a cage
Is it the time?
Is it a way?
