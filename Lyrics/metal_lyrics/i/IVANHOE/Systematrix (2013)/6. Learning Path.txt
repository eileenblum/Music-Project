Talked the universe, how to change our mind
Among humans there is no peaceful coexistence,
If there is no approval of individual rights

I cry out forthright, this should apply to our earth
For the memory of nature
From time to time, from Arab spring what will come
For the memory of nature

Who is gonna live a life with no regrets?
And who knows how to force our speed our learning path?

Yes we should still believe in all of us, 
even if we don't know how
...and thoughts are not allowed!

Who is gonna live a life with no regrets?
And who knows how to force our speed our learning?
Who is gonna live a life with no regrets?
And who knows how to force our speed our learning path?

A morphic field society, newly civilized
A new dimension will exhale

I cry out forthright, this should apply to our earth
For the memory of nature
From time to-time, from Arab spring what will come
For the memory of nature

Who is gonna live a life with no regrets?
And who knows how to force our speed our learning?
Who is gonna live a life with no regrets?
And who knows how to force our speed our learning?
Who is gonna live a life with no regrets?
And who knows how to force, our speed our learning path?

From time to time
From Arab spring what will come
We protect minorities from majorities,
maybe it's the wrong key, water for the Judas tree...
precisely we don't know
