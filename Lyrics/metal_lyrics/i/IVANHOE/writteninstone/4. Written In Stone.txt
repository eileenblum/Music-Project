It's the nation unknown like mystery 
No conclusions just these incertainties 
Buildings, buildings by your loving stone to stone 
To talk the chance you like that match 
Put as your mind to grow 

We are the God and queens of heaven, the waiting stairs 
We don't know which decisions that we well regret 
But I know that something's knocking at my door 
But I know, I may wind up down on the floor 

Realizing this makes all you win deserve, 
For all the work you do you regain your self respect 
The means are there for you to use or to ignore 
The future is for you an others to explore 

Ah ahaah it's written in stone 
Ah ahaah for it's my word 

We are the God and queens of heaven, the waiting stairs 
We don't know which decisions that we well regret 
But I know that something's knocking at my door 
But I know, I may wind up down on the floor 

Ah ahaah it's written in stone 
Ah ahaah for it's my word
