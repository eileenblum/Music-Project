There are no more boundaries wires over wall 
Reach yourself a fantasy 
And climb the winding road 
Take my hand let's go 

It's you that's shinig bright 
Ascending in the sky 
Come real near and feel my fingers 
Grasp your heart 
Hold me close don't let go 
No need for explanation following inspirations 
Together heart and soul 
We'll make it up as we go 
A journey without an end 

I will be a part of all your fantasies 
Close your eyes and bring the vision into sight 
Don't trust the assents 
Of your senses sharpening 
And together we'll decide what's wrong or right 
The world of imagination sods of inspiration 
Into the realm of unknown 
There's no happy end no time to spare 
We'll make it up as we go 
I will be a part of all your fantasies 
Close your eyes and bring the vision into sight 

Don't trust the assents 
Of your senses sharpening 
And together we'll decide 
What's wrong or right 
No need for explanation 
Following inspirations 
Into the realm of unknown 
A journey without an end 
We'll make it up as we go 

Reopen the door don't cry no more 
It's time to take a journey 
On a long and winding road 
Into the realm of unknown
