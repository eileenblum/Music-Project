My love is sacred
Your love is sacred
Our love is sacred
Forever in our minds 

What have I done to why did you cling to?
Why did you ever believe it's for free 

Bless my soul
I won't give it up until you
Bless my soul
To blind to see our love 

We live in shadows
The end of endless sorrow
Look for the future and believe in me 

Pain can't you see Ã¯Â¿Â½ time my enemy Ã¯Â¿Â½ rain comes
Down on me Ã¯Â¿Â½ how could we be free? 

Bless my soul
I won't give it up until you
Bless my soul
To blind to see our love 

My love is sacred
Your love is sacred
Our love slowly dying tonight 

Tonight... 

...I'm not the one
...I'm barely secret
...just face the light
