Look out and the sun will shine
No place to hide in front of my time
All my ways come to one end
All the love that I give, all the time that I spent
My heart beats like a drum to the things I say, to the things I've done 

Now's the time to ask myself is it liife that I live
I live on my own? 

Who will I be when my end is near?
How does it feel?
The target is clear, but I live with fear 

Farewell for a little while
From a twilight dream, from the pain that I love
Like the stream has reached the sea
There's a reason to be for all that we see
Yet quietly I will search for peace of my soul, for the real love 

The faithful say believe in god, is it a solution
Or just an illusion? 

Who will I be when my end is near?
How does it feel?
The target is clear, but I live with fear 

Stand up just one more time
The dark behind the sun to find
Sand upon the shores of time
I'm a part of this world, the world I live in
Oceans of tears to drain and dream away my last pain 

I'm dancing with my memories to the music of love in shadows of pain 

Who will I be when my end is near?
How does it feel?
The target is clear, but I live with fear
