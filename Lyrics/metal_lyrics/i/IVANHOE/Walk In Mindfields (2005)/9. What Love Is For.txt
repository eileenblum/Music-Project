You've kissed away my tears, that's all I need
I'm not afraid, full secure, heavens just a kiss away
You free my mind, I knew what love can do

And if you cry, you've lost your smile, as if you're miles away

Running in a bad devotion
Lost in time, I'm left alone now
Now I know you're gone, I'm trying to find out
What all love is for

Much time has past to step out of the dark
Sun won't shine, heavy clouds, if it only would rain today
Pray to the sky, I've touched the flame for you

And I found myself now and again

Running in a bad devotion
Lost in time, I'm left alone now
Now I know you're gone, I'm trying to find out
What all love is for

For me, I would try to love if anything's left for us
You say that our love was right
I can't help myself
