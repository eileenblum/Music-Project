I know it's crazy but I'm here again and I need to see your smile
It's such a long time ago and I just want to know who you turned out to be
Please don't be afraid, I'm really not the same as I was before
I'm so happy to see you ... ok ... we will meet us the same place after all 

But now that I see you, you've lost the child in your eyes
Something bad has happened, I'm begging you to realize 

Who scares your soul? What happens in your life?
Go away from what is killing you
Save your dreams! Your husband must be blind to see
He takes everything from you 

I try to remember in the things you've done and the things that you believe
And somehow I knew that we meet again and I won't miss the chnce
Your emotional world, I couldn't believe, was rotten to the core
I think of the past, the way you smiles to me
Yes, the way you smiled was free 

Can't you see the light? You got to leave this all behind
I knew the time was right. New solutions you will find 

Pain scares your soul. A shadow in your life
Go away from what is killing you
Save your dreams! Your husband must be blind to see
He takes everything from you
