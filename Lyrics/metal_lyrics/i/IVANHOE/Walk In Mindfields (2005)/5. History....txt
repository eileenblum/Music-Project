[lyrics for whole History Of Crime]

Let's break a thousand walls. I know we will fall
Apart from what is here, apart from anywhere
Let's win a thousand wars. I know there's no cause
I know that we're wrong, everything is gone 

Now that I come closer
Try to remember. But peaces must be done
It seem s to be a kind of conception
But still no sense in everything I've done 

If all I say is not true, just watch my hands come over you
From a spirit far behind
I've killed this life but not myself. Wake up like anybody else
What have I become 

Where am I? is that crime?
That I'm leaving those souls behind
In history I'll be fine
However I am leaving those souls behind 

I have seen the late horizons
From south east where frequently there's war
The old life is drastically altered, we bring them culture
It's just a state of mind 

In the name of god our culture grows. The battle more the blood will flow
Sacramento valleys
We've killed our live. Fight for the cross wake up in hell. No sign of god
What have we become? 

Where am I? is that crime?
That I'm leaving those souls behind
In history I'll be fine
However I am leaving those souls behind 

In the name of god we've killed ourselves
We've killed ourselves in the name of Bush
