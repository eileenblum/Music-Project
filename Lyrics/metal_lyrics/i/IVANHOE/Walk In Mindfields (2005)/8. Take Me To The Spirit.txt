One step to madness 

Easy to see
It's a hard way to follow all things you believe
I know you close your eyes and dream your dreams
But this tragedy drives you insane 

My vision is dead, no hope inside
Leading the powers away
My dreams in control, I'm under your spell
This world is not for me 

Oh take me to the spirit of my home
Oh will be a safe before the storm 

Too many faces. Still know we're blind
A silent scream burning my mind
Memories fade, we'vematched so far
To many thoughts in who we are 

Feast of the crow Ã¯Â¿Â½ it's burning in me
Face in the flame Ã¯Â¿Â½ and no one would see 

The sound of a distant thunder
The dawn of the judgment day
I know you close your eyes and dream your dreams
But this tragedy drives you insane
My vision is dead, no hope inside
Leading the powers away
My dreams in control, I'm under your spell
This world is not for me 

Oh take me to the spirit of my home
Oh will be a safe before the storm 

Oh take me to the spirit of my home
Oh will be a safe before the storm
