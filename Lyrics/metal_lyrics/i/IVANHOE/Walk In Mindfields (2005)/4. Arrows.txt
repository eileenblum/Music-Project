All I have is a passion for rock'n'roll
In a maze where hundred arrows prick my soul 

Love is an arrow
Friends are like arrows
Help me out of this sorrow
Music is an arrow
But it gives me tomorrow
And help me out of this sorrow 

Oh no, there must be more to life
I know it was the truth
Just take a look at me, the autumn and you 

Love is an arrow
Friends are like arrows
Help me out of this sorrow
Music is an arrow
But it gives me tomorrow
And help me out of this sorrow 

Ore is life, just the the time in there, the arrows try to kill me
A destination this no learn
Ore is life, just the time in there, the arrows try to kill me
Just like a river of no return 

Father tell his life is lovely and nice
But maybe a million arrows kill him before 

Love is an arrow
Friends are like arrows
Help me out of this sorrow 

Ore is life, just the the time in there, the arrows try to kill me
A destination this no learn
Ore is life, just the time in there, the arrows try to kill me
Just like a river of no return
