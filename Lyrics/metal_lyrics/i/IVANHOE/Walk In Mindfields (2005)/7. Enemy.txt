Slightly go insane
Softly words I'm praying
I've been the best I can
Certain tears in falling rain

I've said please don't lie
I've thought there's no need
Forget what you've been forget who we are

Material things just belong to you
And I've found no regrets in your eyes and I saw him win

But I know it's tru, painful worry
I can't believe you're my enemy, you're my enemy, you're my enemy

Diamonds and pearls
That's what rules your world
The last embrace we do
Too cold I'm not the one for you

You know all my tears
You know long before
Forget what we've done, forget all my love

Material things just belong to you
And I've found no regrets in your eyes and I saw him win

But I know it's tru, painful worry
I can't believe you're my enemy, you're my enemy, you're my enemy
