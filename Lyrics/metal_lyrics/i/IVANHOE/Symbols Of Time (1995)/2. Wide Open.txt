I walked through the shadows
all these years
our eyes were all so blind
all the secrets, all the memories
forgotten by an ignorant mind
open up your closed out mind
color all your dreams
turn the clock it's not too late
new horizons, change your fate

oh - wasted faith,
the nameless children
of the holy ground
God have mercy, heal the blind
'cause out of sight is not out
of mind

Doors are open wide
a glow in sight
it only takes a minutes to strike
oh, hope is like a candlelight

In a world of many religions
who's the judge to make decisions
I don't know

Law and suicide, moms and kids
classified racistic pigs
I don't know

Open window of the world
problem child - your money hurts
you make me laugh and smile
you got me paid for violence

Control your eyes - faith reaction
with many sides of non perfection
you live your life in wonder
let the others hear the thunder

Oh, can I believe what's wrong
and right
another day, another night
you found yourself, the doors
open wide
