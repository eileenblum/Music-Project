To the stars
to a better world
can't you see, what your money
means for me

Still the same
I'm the only one
you'll believe my words
and tell the kids
where all their dreams have gone

I can heal your fear
no time to disappear
Search alone
please call, the endless one

Hope and fear are both true
first I touch then taste you
over the edge
into my mind
into my soul

I won't be alone in darkness
search for the one
that guides you through
the space of time
until your mine

seriously - out of this world
can't you see - one way to turn
seriously - out of this world
misery - this money burns

Can you believe what you said to me
can you ignore - can't you see
now I see
what you've done to me
now I know my place to be
