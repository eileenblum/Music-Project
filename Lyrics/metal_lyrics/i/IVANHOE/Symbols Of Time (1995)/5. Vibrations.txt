Now you see the water rippling
best make sure the boat's not tipping
underneath you know there's something
the croc is there your heart starts something
our boat is rocking to and fro (frightening)
sometimes fast some times slow
over the edge you can see his head
this crocodile, he wants you dead
oh one false move that's all it takes
the vibrations fill me with panic and fear
the beast begins with wild thrashing
open jaws huge white teeth gnashing
is this the end I ask myself

With tail smashes, in you go
now he rolls you very slow
the crocodile, me takes you under
your smashing bones they sound like thunder
the pain is gone - the end is here
