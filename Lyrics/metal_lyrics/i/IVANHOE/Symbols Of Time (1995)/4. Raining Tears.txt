Uh, I came along
this desert road
and never have
I felt like this before
I searched my own identity
the way of life,
pretty things will be

Another call another night
in many dreams
illusions out of sight
I can't believe
the things I've seen
I can't believe the helpless
human beings

Look in his eyes and follow him
same old game
another chance to win
I found myself in a money world
a million games
I've played before
I just believed in paradise,
a colored world a world of demise
blind to my fate deaf to my soul
no hope but getting older

When we're fighting
through the world
search and find it
money burns

One man's hirachy,
confused by the words
which meant so much
to fall on ears which
just don't care
wasted time on different things,
only care what money brings

I place my trust in
both your hands
afraid of making mistakes again
seasons passed emotions died
helplessness, oh God I tried,
words on paper,
they're hard to read
the will to learn is not my creed
humanity, what's wrong
what's right
this empty glass
I'll crawl inside
my new found care
for mankind shows
it's not too late to
change the role
live for the moment,
for today
help your children
come out and play
