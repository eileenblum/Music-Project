Time to leave me father
time to say the big - goodbye
I came out of silence
I came out of a desert storm
to find another reason
to find the only way to go
it's like a new beginning
another time, another lie
you can hear me, you can see me
so please, open up your mind
- all solutions passing by

Why should I go on I'm thinking
when will the sun - shine again
these are the memories of a (man)
time, let me be another man

Can you hear me
can you see me
Do you really know the game
all the answers
all the questions
all the dreams I'm fighting for

Open your eyes
open (up) your mind
come - hear the sirens now!
come read my lips
come taste the truth
let yourself come true
