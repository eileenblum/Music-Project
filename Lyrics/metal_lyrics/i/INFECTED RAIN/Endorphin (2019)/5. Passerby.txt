Passerby, it hurts, it hurts every time
Passerby, it hurts, it hurts every time

You make me feel like a whore
Thirsty and hungry, always begging for more
Tonight with you, tomorrow with another
You selfish jerks don't even bother

You don't even bother asking me how I feel
When I'm breathless and drowning in tears
Broken, carried away by the melody
I'm trying to keep it together because you're staring at me
You're staring at me

The face you see when you look at me, it's not me
It's just skin and muscles, not the real me
Not the me you hear when I sing to you
Not the me you feel when I touch you
Not me
Not me

Passerby, it hurts every time
When I open up, giving you my confession
Merciless, you're eating me alive
Still, you are my only way out, my salvation

I know the frosting on the cake is sweet
But the stuff inside is bitter
Mouth full of razor blades
Lost in a deadly mirror maze

I know, I know the frosting on the cake is sweet
But the stuff inside is bitter
Mouth full of razor blades
Lost in a deadly mirror maze

Lost in a deadly mirror maze
Lost in a deadly mirror maze

Passerby, it hurts every time
When I open up, giving you my confession
Merciless, you're eating me alive
Still, you are my only way out, my salvation

Hello dark stage embrace me
Let the time pass by me, erase me
Let me disappear in silence, swallow me
I'm small and breathless, forgive me, forgive me
