You think I'm to much
And I'm crossing the line?
Get used to it because
I'm not losing this fight

Some of you think I'm twisted
Out of my mind
Crazy and wasted
Some of you think I'm twisted
Out of my mind
Crazy and wasted

Blink, blink, blink
I see your eyes blink
Trying to figure out where is the trick
There are to many hands in a cookie jar
You're used to only gimmicks
All the lies

Maybe I'm crazy but I know I'm not lost
I'm done being lead by hungry fake gods

Fake gods
Fake gods

Because I slay while I play
Listen and follow me
I've got a demon in me
I am the prodigy

You think I'm to much
And I'm crossing the line?
Get used to it because
I'm not losing this fight

Some of you think I'm twisted
Out of my mind
Crazy and wasted
Some of you think I'm twisted
Out of my mind
Crazy and wasted

Just stop judging me and listen
Open your mind
Stop bitching
I'll change the world
With or without you
I'm sick and disgusted by this glamorous lure

Blink, blink, blink
I see your eyes blink
Trying to figure out where is the trick
There are to many hands in a cookie jar
You're used to only gimmicks
All the lies

Because I slay while I play
Listen and follow me
I've got a demon in me
I am the prodigy

There is no luck in a four leaf clover
I'm here to lead you to start all over
There is no luck in a four leaf clover
I'm here to lead you to start all over
