Hear this prayer, hear this Mantra
No mercy for the fire starter

It's our fault your startedârotting
Yourârage is whatâwe deserve to drown in
By harmingâyou we are destroying our home
By selfishness and pride our brain is thorned

We are in anguish and lost in despair
Poisoning our own food and air
By gluttony and greed our soul is devoured
There is no more sweet, only bitter and sour

We are parasites
Living in a gloom, living in a gloom
We are parasites
Living in a gloom, living in a gloom

Never satisfied with what you give, what you give
We steal from you, neglecting your gift
What is the price to pay for this disaster?
For this ludicrous, humiliating fiasco?

Never satisfied with what you give
We steal from you, neglecting your gift
What is the price to pay for this disaster?
For this ludicrous, humiliating fiasco?

Humiliating fiasco

You are our mother
You are our mother

Shock the ground with thunder
Thunder
Drown our bones with rain
You are our home, you're our mother
You spotless innocence was stained
Stained

We are in anguish and lost in despair
Poisoning our own food and air
By gluttony and greed our soul is devoured
There is no more sweet, only bitter and sour

We are parasites
Living in a gloom
Living in a gloom
Like cancer we spread, it's lethal
We are parasites
We forgot how to live, our existence is doomed

Shock the ground with thunder
Thunder
You are
Drown our bones with rain
You are our home, you're our mother
Your spotless innocence was stained
Stained

You are our mother
