Walking into the night
Walking in the night, I am trying to find you
Waiting for the stormâtoâpass so Iâcan find you
Walking into the night
Walking into the night
Walking into the night
Walking into the night,âI'm trying to find you
Walking into the night, so I can find you
Walking into the night, walking into the night
I'm trying to find you, walking into the night
Walking into the night, walking into the night
So I can find you
Walking into the night

The ice beneath my feet is breaking
I'm going under
The freezing water is swallowing me
I'm going under
The ice beneath my feet is breaking
I'm going under
The freezing water is swallowing me, swallowing me

I want to scream into the ocean
(Walking into the night)
Hear it echo, hear it sunder
(Walking into the night, walking into the night)
Then sink back into the ocean
(Walking into the night)
Feel the pain rise up in the sky
(Walking into the night, walking into the night)
Awakening the thunder
(Walking into the night)

Feel the pain rise up in the sky
Feel the pain rise up in the sky

Walking into the night
(Walking into the night, walking into the night)
Waiting for the storm to pass
(Walking into the night, walking into the night)
It's hard to move, come find me
It's hard to breathe, please save me

It's hard to move, come find me
It's hard to breathe, please save me
It's hard to move, come find me
It's hard to breathe, please save me
It's hard to move, come find me
It's hard to breathe, please save me
It's hard to move, come find me
It's hard to breathe, hard to breathe

The ice beneath my feet is breaking
The freezing water is swallowing me
I'm going under
Walking into the night
I'm going under
Walking into the night
I'm going under
Walking into the night
I'm going under
Walking into the night
I'm going under
