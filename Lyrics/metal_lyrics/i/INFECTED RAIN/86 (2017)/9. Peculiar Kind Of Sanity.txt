Anger is a corrosive acid
Eating you from the inside
Sense of self importance is a narcotic
Addictive and destructive
So what to do and how to be?
Body in a conflict with the mind
There are no rules, no one to lead
No signs of the finish line

So take me, take me far
Where the skies embrace a star
Where the land swallows the ocean
And the water is in constant motion

The unknown is terrifying
One thing you have to be afraid of is fear itself
Washing away the guilt
One more thing you have to learn is loving yourself
Is loving yourself
The smiles and sparkles are only an illusion
Don't get fooled, open your eyes
Reality is a lie but, there is a solution
You'll need a crystal clear mind

So take me, take me far
Where the skies embrace a star
Where the land swallows the ocean
And the water is in constant motion

We choose our path, we choose our lives
We choose what to see in front of our eyes
We choose our path, we choose our lives
We choose what to see in front of our eyes

So take me! Take me far
Where the skies embrace a star
So take me! Take me far
Where the skies embrace a star
Where the land swallows the ocean
And the water is inconstant motion

We choose our path, we choose our lives
We choose what to see in front of our eyes
We choose our path, we choose our lives
We choose what to see in front of our eyes

So take me
So take me, take me far
Where the skies embrace a star

Take me, take me far
Take me, take me far
Take me, take me far
Take me, take me far
Take me, take me far
Take me, take me far
Take me
