Suffering beautifully, perfectly drunk
Hopelessly sorry, terribly lost

Everything has gone too far, this is serious
Your thoughts and speech are delirious
You're not the queen of the candy world
You're a flower with a putrid core
Life is not an endless party
With drugs and men with Bugatti
The game you're playing is theatrical
The game you're playing is theatrical
It's going to end dramatical
The game you're playing is theatrical

You are a nightmare
Dressed like a daydream
No one you care about
Too busy vomiting glam
Disgusting little freak
With a small mind
You make me sick
I can't stand your lies

You are just a wonderful tragedy
Totally misled and naÃ¯ve
A character in a bad comedy
Ridiculous and hard to believe

The game you're playing is theatrical
It's going to end deplorably dramatical

It's going to end dramatical
It's going to end dramatical
It's going to end deplorably dramatical
Deplorably dramatical

You are a nightmare
Dressed like a daydream
No one you care about
Too busy vomiting glam
Disgusting little freak
With a small mind
You make me sick
I can't stand your lies

Suffering beautifully â perfectly drunk
Hopelessly sorry â terribly lost
Hopelessly sorry â terribly lost
Hopelessly sorry â terribly lost
