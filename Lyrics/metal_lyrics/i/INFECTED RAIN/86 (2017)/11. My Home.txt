I thought I have you but I feel alone
You are my gravity but now I fall

Fall, now I fall
Fall, now I fall

But I've been following your footprints
Following your leads
But I've been following your footprints
Following your leads

I want to go out and get lost
In the forest in the dust
I want to forget my way back home
And get more drunk the further I go

I thought I have you but I feel alone
You are my gravity but now I fall
Your words fooled me, I've been clouded by your beauty
Trusted all your promises, now I'm lost in eternity

Somebody blow the air into my lungs
'Cause I forgot how to breathe
Somebody please help me rise
'Cause I have swollen, tired knees
My weakness is the reason of my pain
Being selfish and possessive is my shame
I'm far and all alone, I miss you
I miss you and I know you are my home

I thought I have you but I feel alone
You are my gravity but now I fall
Your words fooled me, I've been clouded by your beauty
Trusted all your promises, now I'm lost in eternity

Fall
Now I fall, fall
Now I fall

But I've been following your footprints
Following your leads
Now fall
But I've been following your footprints
Following your leads
Now fall

There is no way out of this misery
It's going to be hard every time

There is no way out
It's going to be hard every time
There is no way out
It's going to be hard every time

There is no way out of this misery
It's going to be hard every time
Endlessly fighting with the insecurity
It puts us on the edge of committing a crime

There is no way out of this misery
It's going to be hard every time
Endlessly fighting with the insecurity
It puts us on the edge of committing a crime

There is no way out
