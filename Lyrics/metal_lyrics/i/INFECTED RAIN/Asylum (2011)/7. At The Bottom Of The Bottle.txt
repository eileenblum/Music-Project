Alcohol, it makes you feel good
It makes you feel sick
Alcohol, you want more and more
But you're clouded so quickly

The bottle beckons you
And you feel so weak
Here you are at the bottom
And your ego's so big

The bottle beckons you
And you feel so weak
Here you are at the bottom
And your ego's so big

You hate to be sober
Problems all gone
Your sorrow has been stolen
You're full and happy now

This pain, this pain is too loud
You try, you try to come out

Alcohol, it makes you feel good
It makes you feel sick
Alcohol, you want more and more
But you're clouded so quickly

You hate to be sober
Problems all gone
Your sorrow has been stolen
You're full and happy now

This pain, this pain is too loud
You try, you try to come out

You are at the bottom of the bottle
You, you, you are at the bottom of the bottle

You are at the bottom of the bottle
You, you, you are at the bottom of the bottle

You are at the bottom of the bottle
You, you, you are at the bottom of the bottle

You are at the bottom of the bottle
You, you, you are at the bottom of the bottle

You hate to be sober
Problems all gone
Your sorrow has been stolen
You're full and happy now

This pain, this pain is too loud
You try, you try to come out

You are at the bottom of the bottle
You, you, you are at the bottom of the bottle

You are at the bottom of the bottle
You, you, you are at the bottom of the bottle

You are at the bottom of the bottle
You, you, you are at the bottom of the bottle
