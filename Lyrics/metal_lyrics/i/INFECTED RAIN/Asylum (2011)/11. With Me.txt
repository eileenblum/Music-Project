Come with me
Let's drive to the sunset
Look at me
I'm sick, don't you see that?
I want to run, run from the past
I want to die, die and forget
Forget me
I'm weak and useless
Don't be scared of me
I'm full of madness

Listen to me
My soul is still breathing
Help me
Can't you see that I'm living

Listen to me
My soul is still crying
Help me
Can't you see that I'm dying?

I'm lying here alone on the floor
I'm still afraid
Don't want to suffer anymore, anymore, anymore

Come with me
Let's hide in the darkness
Look at me
I'm getting thoughtless
I want to fly, fly and leave all back
I want to die, die and forget
Forget me
I'm weak and useless
Don't be scared of me
I'm full of madness

Listen to me
My soul is still breathing
Help me
Can't you see that I'm living

Listen to me
My soul is still crying
Help me
Can't you see that I'm dying?

I'm lying here alone on the floor
I'm still afraid
Don't want to suffer anymore, anymore, anymore

Help, help me
Help me to survive
Save, save me
Save me from the light

Listen to me
My soul is still breathing
Help me
Can't you see that I'm living

Listen to me
My soul is still crying
Help me
Can't you see that I'm dying?

I'm lying here alone on the floor
I'm still afraid
Don't want to suffer anymore, anymore, anymore
