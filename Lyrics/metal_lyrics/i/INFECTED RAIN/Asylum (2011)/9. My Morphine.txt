I need to feel you around
Please don't let me fall
My heart beats without a sound
Afraid to let you go

When I'm alone
I feel so empty so unknown

The madness between us
Only you can let it go
The weakness inside me
Only you can face alone

When I'm alone
I feel so empty so unknown
When I am lonely
I feel the madness above me

Because I'm drowning in you like a shadow
There is only you I want to follow
Because I need you like a dose
You're my morphine that I can not lose

L feel so clouded
Always whining
I'm the hollow can resist
I feel so weakling
Slowly waiting
I'm the silence
Can not speak

L feel so clouded
Always whining
I'm the hollow can resist
I feel so weakling
Slowly waiting
I'm the silence
Can not speak

I'm the silence
Can not speak

I'm the silence
Can not speak

When I'm alone
I feel so empty so unknown
When I am lonely
I feel the madness above me
Because I'm drowning in you like a shadow
There is only you I want to follow
Because I need you like a dose
You're my morphine that I can not lose

Because
There is
Because I need you like a dose
You're my morphine that I can not lose

When I'm alone
I feel so empty so unknown
