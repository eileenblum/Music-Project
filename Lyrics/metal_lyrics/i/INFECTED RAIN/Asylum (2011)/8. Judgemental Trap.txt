Life is too short, come inside and get involved

Here we are manipulated
Dead enough to hesitate it
Have no voice to protest
Have no time to regret

Open your eyes, drop the gun
Stop with the lies, look what you've done

Don't be confused, this is not the time
Stop your abuse overpass the enemy line
Here we are manipulated
Dead enough to hesitate it

Lean your head upon my shoulders
Tell me the story of the solders who
Suffered, cried and died for what?
That fought, tortured and killed for what?
Alive

You think you have your eyes wide open
In this world where dreams are broken
No one sells the tickets to come back
No one will remember you till you're masked
My voice is scratching, lashing inside me
My hate is burning, exploding inside me

This is a web
A judgmental trap
[7x]

Lean your head don't be afraid
Tell me the truth now you're safe
Lean your head upon my shoulders
And tell me the story of the solders who
Suffered, cried and died for what?
That fought, tortured and killed for what?

No one, no one, no one, no one
Will save you
No one, no one, no one, no one
Will love you

Here we are manipulated
Dead enough to hesitate it
Have no voice to protest
Have no time to regret

No, no voice
No, no voice
