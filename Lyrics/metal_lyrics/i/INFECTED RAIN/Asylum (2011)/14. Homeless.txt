I thought I died without conclusion
But you know what, I'll give you your revolution
Your bloody acts signed me forever
I'm like a freak removed from heaven

I thought I died without conclusion
But you know what, I'll give you your revolution
Your bloody acts signed me forever
I'm like a freak removed from heaven

I can tell a sub-story of a quiet little doll
She lived in the world without hope and control
Her father was absent never came home sober
He destroyed her world and made her mother suffer
I'll tell you the truth this doll is my reflection
I'll open my heart and I'll give you my confession

I thought I died without a conclusion
But you know what? I give you your revolution
Your b***** acts signed me forever
I'm like a freak removed from heaven

I thought I died without a conclusion
But you know what? I give you your revolution
Your b***** acts signed me forever
I'm like a freak removed from heaven

Why?
You played with me like a doll
A doll without heart and soul
You told me I'm your blood
And what we did is very smart
You lied to me and made me suffer
You ruined me and used like cover

I thought I died without conclusion
But you know what? I give you your revolution
Your bloody acts signed me forever
I'm like a freak removed from heaven

I thought I died without conclusion
But you know what? I give you your revolution
Your bloody acts signed me forever
I'm like a freak removed from heaven

Now you're gone, I feel like in a nightmare
You're not here, but I feel like you're everywhere

I thought I died without conclusion
But you know what? I give you your revolution
Your bloody acts signed me forever
I'm like a freak removed from heaven

I paid for your sin
And now it hurts
But I can scream
I lost my mind, my family
I don't want to cry
You're my enemy

Why? Why? Homeless, useless, why? Why?

You used me, abused, you're mean
You fucked my childhood, and left me

I thought I died without conclusion
But you know what, I'll give you your revolution
Your bloody acts signed me forever
I'm like a freak removed from heaven

I thought I died without conclusion
But you know what, I'll give you your revolution
Your bloody acts signed me forever
I'm like a freak removed from heaven

I thought I died without conclusion
But you know what, I'll give you your revolution
Your bloody acts signed me forever
I'm like a freak removed from heaven
