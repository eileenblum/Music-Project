'Nature is a whore'
As said Kurt Cobain
We have nowhere to go
Just run in circles again

Again and again we're drowning in this web
Again and again we make the same mistake
Always hunting the same lamb
All we get is the same crap

This life routine
Slowly kills, slowly wins
Transforming us into machines
Without voices without dreams

This life routine
Slowly kills, slowly wins
Transforming us into machines
Without voices without dreams

Everything's a fake
We are nothing but mistake
Our guilt, the obsession
Being good, being special

Again and again we're drowning in this web
Again and again we make the same mistake
Always hunting the same lamb
But all we get is the same crap

Go!
Obey!
Be a zombie
Don't betray
Obey!
Be a dead man
Don't delay
Obey! Obey!

Transforming us into machines
Without voices without dreams

This life routine
Slowly kills, slowly wins
Transforming us into machines
Without voices without dreams

Obey! Obey!
