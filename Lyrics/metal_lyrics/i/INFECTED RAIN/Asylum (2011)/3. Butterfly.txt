I can sing you a poem
About an innocence that once was stolen
I can read you a novel about the truth that never was written

Once upon a time, a long time ago
There was a butterfly, flying alone
She flew above the hills 'til she got lost
Either it was the wind, or she was cursed

This is not where you belong
You need to escape
You need to live long
These are not the people you love
Open your eyes don't let them eat you alive

She found her self lost in a completely new world
There was no flowers, the hills were all rough
She shines like an angel in the completely darkness
Now she is doomed to drown in this silence

The truth is, she never was lost
There was a period in her live she had to pass
She grows too fast, and her childhood is gone
An adult was what she hated to become

This is not where you belong
You need to escape
You need to live long
These are not the people you love
Open your eyes don't let them eat you alive

Her mouth was dry and tired of screaming
Her eyes swallowed by flames from crying

This light is so blinding
She hates to be nothing, nothing
She wants to survive
But the truth is so whipping, whipping
It seems like we live in fairy tales
Everything is so colorful
Everything's a mess
We feel the sweet taste of happiness
But it's so crowded here
And everyone is useless, useless

Her mouth was dry and tired of screaming
Her eyes swallowing by flames from crying

This is not where you belong
You need to escape
You need to live long
These are not the people you love
Open your eyes don't let them eat you alive

This is not where you belong
You need to escape
You need to live long
These are not the people you love
Open your eyes don't let them eat you alive

Alive! Alive! Alive!
