Hey, little child
Tell me about the pain
Tell me about the nightmares
And fears you can not stand
Tell me about the time
When you were weak and lost
Tell me about the monster
That scared you in the past

Thoughts are consuming you
Words are killing you
Mercy is a lie
We all live in sacrifice
You were born in this world
Of misery and hate
You have learned to fly
In this cruel dirty sky

Thoughts are consuming you
Words are killing you
Mercy is a lie
We all live in sacrifice
You were born in this world
Of misery and hate
You have learned to fly
In this cruel dirty sky

You don't belong to this world
You don't belong to this time
When you are alone
You're getting out of your mind

Come here and play
I know you wanna stay
I know you've tried
You'll be free and pass the line

Come here and play
I know you wanna stay
I know you've tried
You'll be free and pass the line

Here she is in a deep, deep darkness
She's alone, empty, colorless
Breathing too loud
Scream without a sound

You don't belong to this world
You don't belong to this time
When you are alone
You're getting out of your mind

You don't belong to this world
You don't belong to this time
When you are alone
You're getting out of your mind

Cry! Cry!

You don't belong to this world
You don't belong to this time
When you are alone
You're getting out of your mind

Come here and play
I know you wanna stay
I know you've tried
You'll be free and pass the line

Come here and play
I know you wanna stay
I know you've tried
You'll be free and pass the line

Hey, little child
Tell me about the pain
Tell me about the nightmares
And fears you can not stand
Tell me about the time
When you were weak and lost
Tell me about the monster
That scared you in your past
