This is my endless story
It has no glam, no glory
It's a life of disappointment
Without that it can't be perfect

Lie! Lie to me
Make! Make me cry
Try! Try hard
Don't! Don't be shy

Hey! Hey dead mannequin
Try again to come in
Put some visions in my head
Do it now, go ahead

Lie! Lie to me
Make! Make me cry
Try! Try hard
Don't! Don't be shy

No one will come in
You will remain clean

No one will come in
You will remain clean

No one will come in
You will remain clean

No one will come in
You will remain clean

There are lies in your eyes
You are putrid deep inside
Need no friends, no luck
You are closed, your head is locked

Lie! Lie to me
Make! Make me cry
Try! Try hard
Don't! Don't be shy

Don't be shy
Don't be shy
Don't be shy
Don't be shy
