You insult me 'cause I'm different
You accuse me 'cause I'm strange
Yes, you like me it's apparent
But here I am up on this stage

Come over here
Tell me, what you want to hear
What's your problem
What's your bound
You don't like me
So what
Me against you
Tell me what you want to do
You want to bite me
You want a fight
I'm not scared, turn off the light

Hey, who are you to judge me
Who, who are you to care
I, I will be so happy
I, I don't need you there

Come over here
Tell me, what you want to hear
What's your problem
What's your bound
You don't like me
So what
Me against you
Tell me what you want to do
You want to bite me
You want a fight
I'm not scared, turn off the light

I was
Speechless
Invisible
Weeping
And hysterical

Needed
Reanimation
Cold blood
A good
Acceleration

Come over here
Tell me, what you want to hear
What's your problem
What's your bound
You don't like me
So what
Me against you
Tell me what you want to do
You want to bite me
You want a fight
I'm not scared, turn off the light

Come over here
Tell me, what you want to hear
You want to bite me
You want a fight
I'm not scared, turn off the light
Me against you
Tell me what you want to do
You want to bite me
You want a fight
I'm not scared, turn off the light

I was
Speechless
Invisible
Weeping
And hysterical

Needed
Reanimation
Cold blood
A good
Acceleration

Who are you to judge me
And who are you to care
I will be so happy
And I don't need you there

Who are you to judge me
And who are you to care
I will be so happy
And I don't need you there

Who are you to judge me
And who are you to care
I will be so happy
And I don't need you there

Who are you to judge me
And who are you to care
I will be so happy
And I don't need you there
