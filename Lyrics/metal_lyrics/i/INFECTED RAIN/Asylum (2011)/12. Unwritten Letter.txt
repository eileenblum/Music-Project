I will go over you
My voice will strangle you

I will go over you
My voice will strangle you

Here I am, I'm writing a letter
I'm sitting alone looking at this paper
There are things I would like to say aloud
But I'm blocked my words don't come out
I want to try without being shy
But you will have to read behind the line
Feel confused, my hands are shaking
Feel depressed, my heart is broken

I will go over you
My voice will strangle you

I will go over you
My voice will strangle you

Here it is, my pencil on this paper
Still alone, now I feel better
I can't sing aloud all my pain and suffering
Feel strange, feel my memories crumbling

I need to read
This unwritten letter
My heart still beats
But I feel better

I need to read
This unwritten letter
My heart still beats
But I feel better

I need the wings to feel free and fly
To feel free and fly

I need the wings to feel free and fly
To feel free and fly

I need the wings to feel free and fly
To feel free and fly

I need the wings to feel free and fly
To feel free and fly

I will go over you
My voice will strangle you

I will go over you
My voice will strangle you

I will go over you
My voice will strangle you

I will go over you
My voice will strangle you
