I'll never ask for help
I will take care of myself
I will live
I will breathe
There is nothing you can give

The wind blows to the future
I still write about the past
My heart still beats but I fill putrid
I never find the things I've lost
I know it's done, now it's over
That little girl is just a past
I was a bird, I was a soldier
Never found the things to trust

Here I am begging you
Daddy, please, just let me go
Let me fly, let me escape
I have no more things to take
Daddy, please, let me breathe
Don't punish me for the things you did
Let me go, let me die
I have no more tears to cry

Can you hear the message I'm bringing
Can you take me to the past I'm singing

Can you hear the message I'm bringing
Can you take me to the past I'm singing

Can you hear the message I'm bringing
Can you take me to the past I'm singing

Can you hear the message I'm bringing
Can you take me to the past I'm singing

I will scream and you'll get deaf
I will fight and you'll get mad
'cause I hear the voices callin'
Feathers from my wings are fallin'

I will scream and you'll get mad
I will fight and you'll get sad
'cause I hear the voices callin'
Feathers from my wings are falling
Falling

Can you hear the message I'm bringing
Can you take me to the past I'm singing

Can you hear the message I'm bringing
Can you take me to the past I'm singing

Can you hear the message I'm bringing
Can you take me to the past I'm singing

Can you hear the message I'm bringing
Can you take me to the past I'm singing

I will never ask for help
I will take care of myself
I will breathe
I will live
All I want is just to leave
