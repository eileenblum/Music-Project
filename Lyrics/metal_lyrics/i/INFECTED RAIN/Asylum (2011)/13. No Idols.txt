Can't understand the pain
Can't understand the dreams I've made
Wake up!
Wake up!
Look in the mirror and tell me are you satisfied?
The person you see, is that all you purify?
All you have is your black and white life
And more and more all you do makes you weak and blind

You become like them unreal without feelings
This plastic little people have no right for living
They'll make you disappear and you'll be fucked
Tell me do you want to follow or bring your life back?
Open your eyes and forget about idols
Start your live from beginning and break the silence
They all watch the things we do
So prove them there is a lot of color in you

I'm singing my anger with this words
I'm sick of this masks so give them freedom of thoughts
I'm sick to scream under my breath
I want to explode, I had enough
I'm insane
Burnt from pain
My scars are bleeding without a meaning
No idols
No idols

All we do is run in circles
We'll run until my voice will disappear
Until my sound will break the silence
In this world will be no violence

All we do is run in circles
We'll run until my voice will disappear
Until my sound will break the silence
In this world will be no violence

No!

All we do is run in circles
We'll run until my voice will disappear
Until my sound will break the silence
In this world will be no violence

I'm insane
Burnt from pain
My scars are bleeding without a meaning
No idols
No idols
