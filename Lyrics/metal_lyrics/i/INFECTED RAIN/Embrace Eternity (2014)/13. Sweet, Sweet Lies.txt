Can you hear me? I'm screaming to your face
Can you feel me? I'm burning through your veins

Are you alive? Standing here with me
Are you blind? Or just ignoring me?

You think this is a dream
And you'll wake up sober and clean?
You think somebody cares
About the scars on your chest?

You think this is a dream
And you'll wake up sober and clean?
You think somebody cares
About the scars on your chest?

You think this is a dream
And you'll wake up sober and clean?
You think somebody cares
About the scars on your chest?

Beautiful people, beautiful life
Beautiful cities, sweet, sweet lies

Is that what you want, what you really dream about?
Is that what you want, is that what you want?

Is that what you want, what you really dream about?
Is that what you want, is that what you want?

Reality is knocking at your door
Stop dreaming, wake up and face them all
You are a warrior, go and fight
A hungry animal, angry and wild

Is that what you want, what you really dream about?
Is that what you want, is that what you want?

Is that what you want, what you really dream about?
Is that what you want, is that what you want?

Beautiful people, beautiful life
Beautiful cities, sweet, sweet lies
Is that what you want?
Beautiful cities, sweet, sweet lies

You think this is a dream
And you'll wake up sober and clean?
You think somebody cares
About the scars on your chest?

You think this is a dream
And you'll wake up sober and clean?
You think somebody cares
About the scars on your chest?

Can you hear me? I'm screaming to your face
Can you feel me? I'm burning through your veins

Can you hear me? I'm screaming to your face
Can you feel me? I'm burning through your veins

Through your veins
I'm burning

Through your veins
I'm burning

You can't fight when the war is over
You can't change all that is done
Never try to make this world better
You'll never drink the whole ocean

Is that what you want, what you really dream about?
Is that what you want,
Is that what you want?

Is that what you want, what you really dream about?
Is that what you want,
Is that what you want?

Beautiful people, beautiful life
Beautiful cities, sweet, sweet lies
Is that what you want?
Beautiful cities, sweet, sweet lies

Is that what you want, what you really dream about?
Is that what you want,
Is that what you want?

Is that what you want, what you really dream about?
Is that what you want,
Is that what you want?
