I'm standing alone, facing my fears
Facing you, judging me
For who I am and what I do
But I am still here, stronger than before
I feel my roots burrowing the floor
I'm ready to die, ready to fly
Here with you on the stage
Full of lie, full of rage

It's to late for you to save me
I'm already infected
Stop trying, stop blaming me
I am already infected
Haunted by memories
Haunted, haunted by fear
Never care about danger
I am enslaved by my dreams

I'm standing alone, facing my fears
Facing you, judging me
For who I am and what I do
Ready to die, ready to fly
This is my life, my long-waited dream
This stage and me standing here
I'm enslaved by the music
No one will change my mind
I'm engaged with the music
And I will be its bride

I'm ready to give you the last part of me
Part of my breath, the last taste of me
Just give me the chance to show you this place
The wild pulsing veins, inside of me
The weeping rain, breathtaking pain
The unbearable shame, inside of me
The unbearable shame, inside of me

So here I am, like an open book
I have no chance, I'm on your hook
Let me show you why I'm here
I've been broken beyond repair
It's to late for you to save me
I'm already infected
Stop trying, stop blaming me
I am already infected
Haunted by memories
Haunted, haunted by fears
Never care about danger
I am enslaved by my dreams
