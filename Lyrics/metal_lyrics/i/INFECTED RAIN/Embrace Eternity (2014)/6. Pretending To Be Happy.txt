Give me the medicine
'Cause I'm crazy, 'cause I'm ill
Give me the medicine
I will never let you in

The system swallows us, we became robots
We have to be nice, be kind and smile
Make the money for life than die
Our life is black and white
Bury us deeply into the ground
Makes us just a part of the crowd
That follows a stealthy idiot
(You idiot)

Give me the medicine
'Cause I'm crazy, 'cause I'm ill
Give me the medicine
I will never let you in

Here we are again, falling down
Still amazed we look around
No matter what will hit the ground
No one will help yet 'cause we are bound
We have to stop doing this
Pretending to be happy
We need no one to help us
No preacher, no saints

Give me the medicine
'Cause I'm crazy, 'cause I'm ill
Give me the medicine
I will never let you in

We're crashing down
Oh my God, we're falling down

We're crashing down
Oh my God, we're falling down

The system swallows us, we became robots
The system swallows us, we became robots
The system swallows us, we became robots
The system swallows us, we became robots
The system swallows us, we became robots
The system swallows us, we became robots
