Years are passing, passing, falling through time, falling through time
Nobody is watching, watching, I'm sleepy and blind, sleepy and blind
Watches are ticking hysterically, I'm bored and weak, bored and weak
Screaming and crying pathetically, I'm tired and sick, tired and sick

Watches are ticking, time is passing

Loneliness is sucking the air out of my lungs
Bitterness penetrates me and my thoughts
Butterflies possess me and my belly
Snakes trying to choke me all day

Loneliness is sucking the air out of my lungs
Bitterness penetrates me and my thoughts
Butterflies possess me and my belly
Snakes trying to choke me all day

So many thoughts in my head, falling through time, falling through time
So many holes in my bed, I'm sleepy and blind, sleepy and blind
I can't sleep, I can't forget, I'm bored and weak, bored and weak
So many things I can't accept, I'm tired and sick, tired and sick

Loneliness is sucking the air out of my lungs
Bitterness penetrates me and my thoughts
Butterflies possess me and my belly
Snakes trying to choke me all day

Loneliness is sucking the air out of my lungs
Bitterness penetrates me and my thoughts
Butterflies possess me and my belly
Snakes trying to choke me all day

My eyes are saying don't cage me
I just want to be free
My body is yelling possess me
I don't want to be here

Watches are ticking, time is passing
Watches are ticking, time is passing

Loneliness is sucking the air out of my lungs
Bitterness penetrates me and my thoughts
Butterflies possess me and my belly
Snakes trying to choke me all day
Snakes trying to choke me all day
