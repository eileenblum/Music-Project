Something bothers me inside
Pointless dreams blacken my mind
I'm weak and I'm blocked here in my cage
I hate to be controlled, it's making me edgy

I'm screaming and yelling under my breath
I'm crying, I'm bleeding silence scares me to death

I'm screaming and yelling under my breath
I'm crying, I'm bleeding silence scares me to death

Things are going on so strange
Tears are falling on the page
I tried to write about my fears
About the past and harmless bliss

Claustrophobia, creeping up on me
Breathtaking thoughts are sharp and hurting me
Piercing silence, freaking me out
Dreamless nights come right on top

I'm screaming and yelling under my breath
I'm crying, I'm bleeding silence scares me to death

I'm screaming and yelling under my breath
I'm crying, I'm bleeding silence scares me to death

Things are going on so strange
Tears are falling on the page
I tried to write about my fears
About the past and harmless bliss

My body is my cage, my past is my religion
My creed is this stage, you are the one I breathe for

My body is my cage, my past is my religion
My creed is this stage, you are the one I breathe for

My body is my cage, my past is my religion
My creed is this stage, you are the one I breathe for

My body is my cage, my past is my religion
My creed is this stage, you are the one I breathe for
