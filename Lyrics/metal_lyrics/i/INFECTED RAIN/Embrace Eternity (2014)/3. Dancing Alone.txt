Slowly, softly suffocating
I feel my lungs aching and burning
The painful fullness of my lips
The whipping savage music bits

I feel the madness on my tongue
From your smell I feel so drunk
I'm curling and dancing barefoot
Itching, feeling damn good

My hands are tight, I'm begging for your touch
My eyes are blinded, I want to see your light

My hands are tight, I'm begging for your touch
My eyes are blinded, I want to see your light

You perfect knowing fingers, fire on my skin
I feel your gaze and hunger, I'm drowning in your scent

My blood, heating in my veins
Desire unfurls in a wild hurricane
I'm crying, I'm smiling for you
I'm dancing, I'm fighting for you

I want you to breathe me in, never ever breathe me out
Blind me, hurt me, burn me from inside
Grip me, bite me, make me scream out loud

My hands are tight, I'm begging for your touch
My eyes are blinded, I want to see your light
You perfect knowing fingers, fire on my skin
I feel your gaze and hunger, I'm drowning in your scent

I can't stop dancing, afraid to move
I feel so empty, I feel so full
Arching my chest I wish you were here
Trembling from desire, I can feel you, dear

I feel the madness on my tongue
From your smell I feel so drunk
I'm curling and dancing barefoot
Itching, feeling damn good

My hands are tight, I'm begging for your touch
My eyes are blinded, I want to see your light
You perfect knowing fingers, fire on my skin
I feel your gaze and hunger, I'm drowning in your scent

I want you to breathe me in, never ever breathe me out
Blind me, hurt me, burn me from inside
Grip me, bite me, make me scream out loud
