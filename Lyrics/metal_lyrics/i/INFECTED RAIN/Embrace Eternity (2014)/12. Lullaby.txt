I wanna sing you this lullaby
Now you're home, clean and safe
I wanna sing you this lullaby
Just sleep and forget about yesterday

No one will hurt you again
Now you are on a safe distant land

No one will hurt you again
Now you are on a safe distant land

Close your eyes, forget all the pain, all the lies
Close your eyes
Embrace the silence and the stars

No one will hurt you again
Now you are on a safe distant land

No one will hurt you again
Now you are on a safe distant land

Go back to sleep
No more thinking spread your wings
If you wanna fly you are safe
While you are dreaming, close your eyes

Go back to sleep
No more thinking spread your wings
If you wanna fly you are safe
While you are dreaming, close your eyes

Close your eyes
Forget all the pain
All the lies (all the lies)
Close your eyes
Embrace the silence and the stars
I know there are not enough rocks
To throw into the emptiness
Through the dust
I know there is not enough dark
To hide the bitter truth
Of our empty lives
But you don't have to swim all the seas
To deserve the big ocean, ocean
And you don't have to jump over the cliffs
To learn to fly, to learn to fly

Go back to sleep
No more thinking spread your wings
If you wanna fly you are safe
While you are dreaming, close your eyes

Go back to sleep
No more thinking spread your wings
If you wanna fly you are safe
While you are dreaming, close your eyes

Go back to sleep
No more thinking spread your wings
If you wanna fly you are safe
While you are dreaming, close your eyes
