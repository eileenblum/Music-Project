Wearing mask every day
Always going the wrong way

Long hair, high heels
Blue eyes, red lips
Blissful voice, creepy toys
Plastic body, lover boys

This is you, and your madness
It's your life, but you are reckless

You're wearing pink glasses, false eyelashes
Long black nails, little shiny dress
Hey!
Stupid girl, with no soul
Always smiling, perfectly shining

Wearing mask every day
Always going the wrong way
Can't you see, you're blind
And your wings are tied in knots
Your wings are tied in

This is you, and your madness
It's your life, but you are reckless

Everyone is your friend
Can't you see, you are blind

Everyone is your friend
Can't you see, you are blind

Long hair, high heels
Blue eyes, red lips
Blissful voice, creepy toys
Plastic body, lover boys
