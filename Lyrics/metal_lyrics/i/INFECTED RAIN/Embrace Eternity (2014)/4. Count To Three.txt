Hey, mister sorcerer
What do you have for me?
Will you stop playing cards?
Try and trick me

Come on, show me what you've got
Come on, show me what you've got

Show me flowers and butterflies
Make me fly in the liquid sky
Let me feel the sickness on my tongue
Show me what is good
Show me what is wrong

I feel your venom in my veins
Will you drown my eagerness?
Show me the magic
Show me the end
Hey, mister sorcerer
What do you have for me?
Make the rain run in circles
And the whole world (disappear)
Make people kind, peachy and thoughtless
Do it on the count of three
One, two, three
One, two, three

Show me flowers and butterflies
Make me fly in the liquid sky
Let me feel the sickness on my tongue
Show me what is good
Show me what is wrong

Make the hope bloom in my chest
They all said you are the best
Make the hope bloom in my chest
They all said you are the best
Make the hope bloom in my chest
They all said you are the best

Can you make the angels weep?
Can you make me laugh and shriek?
Can you make the angels weep?
Can you make me laugh and shriek?

Can you make the angels weep?
Can you make me laugh and shriek?
Can you make the angels weep?
Can you make me laugh and shriek?

Show me flowers and butterflies
Make me fly in the liquid sky
Let me feel the sickness on my tongue
Show me what is good
Show me what is wrong
