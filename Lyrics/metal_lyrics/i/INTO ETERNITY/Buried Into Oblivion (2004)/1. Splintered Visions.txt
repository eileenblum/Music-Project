Medicate the mind
Recover and Evaluate
Pills swallowed
Sleep sets in
Enter the other side

Splintered visions
Brought on by your mind
Splintered visions
Believing the lies

Recollection thoughts.
Trying to understand.
One more pill to sedate.
Diminishing the pain.

Splintered visions
Brought on by your mind.
Splintered visions
Believing the lies

You're running forever
Getting nowhere
Changing routes takes you back to the beginning
Falling down
Hit the wall

Splintered visions

You're running forever
Getting nowhere
Changing routes takes you back to the beginning
Falling down        Hit the wall
Hit the wall
