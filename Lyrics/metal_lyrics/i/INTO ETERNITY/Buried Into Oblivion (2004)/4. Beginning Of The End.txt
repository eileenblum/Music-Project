The legend brings forth a time to come
No reason to slay the newborn son

The sky is falling
No escape Armageddon
The sky is burning
The end is just the beginning

Burning dead send swirling victims

Ending
Lights fade away
Your searching for your soul
Beginning of the end
Your searching for your soul

Invasions dark armies armed with hate
An ancient world rises once again

Eradication of the mind
Beginning of the end
No escape Armageddon

Ending lights fade away
Your searching for your soul
Beginning of the end
Your searching for your soul

Burning dead send swirling victims

Ending
Lights fade away
Your searching for your soul
Beginning of the end
Your searching for your soul

Beginning of the end
