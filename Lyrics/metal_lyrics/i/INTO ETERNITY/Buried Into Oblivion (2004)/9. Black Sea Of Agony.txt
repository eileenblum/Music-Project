A black sea of agony

The Skies are blackening
What was will never be
Sent out into the sea
My sails won't carry me

Lack of worth is all I know
This guilt out of control
The ocean crashes down again
A black sea drowning me

I close my eyes and pray for the end
Pray for the end

A black sea of agony

Wind blows out of control
Unrelated unrelenting
Alone I drift off again
Diminishing the pain
Take away my sanity
This vessels shielding all I see

Block out all the thoughts of inner rage
Protect me from myself

I close my eyes and pray for the end
Pray for the end

A black sea of agony

Impassable
Screaming
Impassable
Visionless
Screaming in oblivion

A black sea of agony

Impassable
Screaming
Impassable
Visionless
Impassable screaming in oblivion

I close my eyes
and pray for the end
