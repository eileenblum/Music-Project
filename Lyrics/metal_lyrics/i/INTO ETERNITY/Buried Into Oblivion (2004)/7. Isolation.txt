Inner scars that never heal
Another day in this solitude
This resistance turned prison cell

Your life is slowly fading
Your life is built upon a lie
Existence now forgotten
Memories of isolation
Isolation

The anxiety's convincing
You'll end your tribulations
Panic has taken over

The fear sinks in a crushing hold
Keep the outside from closing in
Slowly dying

Your life is slowly fading
Your life is built upon a lie
Existence now forgotten
Memories of isolation
Isolation

The fear sinks in a crushing hold
Keep the outside from closing in
Slowly dying

Your life is slowly fading
Your life is built upon a lie
Existence now forgotten
Memories of isolation
Isolation
The anxiety's convincing
You'll end your tribulations
Panic has taken over
