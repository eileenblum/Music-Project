Faded thoughts reveal passages of time
Time slips away cannot face this rising hell
Hell awaits the non- believers of old
Old memories of silence scream in through my soul

I see the nameless
I feel the soulless

Embraced by desolation

Can't take no more desolation
Self-murder, revelation

I see the nameless
I feel the soulless

Embraced by desolation

Can't take no more desolation
Self-murder, revelation
