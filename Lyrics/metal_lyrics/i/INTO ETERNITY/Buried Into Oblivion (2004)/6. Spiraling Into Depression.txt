Trapped inside a broken world
Condemned, fallen
Now you are home
A drought ridden spirit

Useless fear is sought again
For the next self-induced fall
Dreams discarded

Spiraling into depression
Spiraling into depression

Still you cannot bear all this pain
Still you cannot bear to walk away
Darkness still rips silently within
Still you cannot bear all the shame

Alone in your circle of despair
Your dreams are discarded
Clinging to a sterile existence
Self-pity and lingering grief
Depleted and beaten
Depleted and beaten

Nailed to insecurities
Life's forfeit and no longer your own
The day becomes night

Still you cannot bear all this pain
Still you cannot bear to walk away
Darkness still rips silently within
Still you cannot bear all the shame

Spiraling into depression
[x3]

Still you cannot bear all this pain
Still you cannot bear to walk away
Darkness still rips silently within
Still you cannot bear all this pain
