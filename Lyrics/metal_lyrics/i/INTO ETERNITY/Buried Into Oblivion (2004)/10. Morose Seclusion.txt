No reason no words to win no reason
Tragic lives are all the same
When you play inside the game
All alone inside your fears

The thoughts of a season
Mith a mindless hope or view
My eyes deceive the pain

No reason no words to win no reason
No reason no words to win no reason

Tragic lives are all the same
When you play inside the game
All alone inside your fears

The thoughts of a season
Mith a mindless hope or view
My eyes deceive the pain

The thoughts of a season
Mith a mindless hope or view
My eyes deceive the pain
