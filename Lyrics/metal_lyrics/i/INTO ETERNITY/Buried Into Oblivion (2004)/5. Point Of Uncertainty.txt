Personal glory clouds your mind
Another victim of circumstance

Point of uncertainty
Words escape me

Praised by your peers
Cascade like god
Your new life decays since you've strayed

Point of uncertainty
Words escape me

You've sold my dignity
Accusing me of this forgery
Fuck you and your snub perception
I'll transcend and rise above

Point of uncertainty
Words escape me

You've sold my dignity
Accusing me of this forgery
Fuck you and your snub perception
I'll transcend and rise above
