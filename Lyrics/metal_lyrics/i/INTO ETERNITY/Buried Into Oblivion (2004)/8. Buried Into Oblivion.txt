Bitter hate fuels my existence
Emptiness fills time
A constant state of mental illness
Self worth decreasing
Demoralize
Drown myself in a black sea of agony

My conscience with grief
Led myself astray once more
Nothing seems real
Disillusional shadow

Impassable
Screaming
Impassable
Visionless
Impassable screaming in oblivion

Soon the suffering will end
These blackened memories controlling me
A living hell for me
Every waking minute that I'm breathing

Impassable
Screaming
Impassable
Visionless
Impassable screaming in oblivion
