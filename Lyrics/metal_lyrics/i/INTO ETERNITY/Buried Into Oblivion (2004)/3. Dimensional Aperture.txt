Fading in the night to end the suffering
The world you've left behind
Adventitious thoughts disclose the path you've chosen
Darkness shows you light?

Eternal soil, approve in three dimension
skin cold and white
Internal self, transversing through this terra, spirit full in flight

A dead eye flashback recaptures
Mentally sensing with subconscience

Once here, once there now another life you're living
Destiny, revives the sight awaken
Recall a place that you once knew
Misery, another life is taken
Recall the spirit breaking through

Faint voices in the breeze -
Stare into darkness at the 3 dimensional aperture
Faint voices calling me -
Stare into darkness, stare into darkness
Feel the cold skin haunting me -
Stare into darkness at the 3 dimensional aperture

Gathered by the site, with lonely tears, a fallen victim of life
Cut short, broken, cheated, banished by the light
A cold black grim stone's writing offers to remind
The cold dark moist soil is where all shall one day lie

A dead eye flashback recaptures
Mentally sensing with subconscience
Once here, once there now another life you're living

Destiny revives your sight awaken
Recall a place that you once knew
Misery another life is taken
Recall the spirit breaking through
