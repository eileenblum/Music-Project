Diagnosis terminal

My life is ending soon I know
This diagnosis terminal
Alone forevermore
Disbelieving

Terminal leads me back into eternity
Empty void inside
Any future denied
This virus inside
Eating me alive

You were waiting in my sullen dream
My reality

My life is ending soon I know
This diagnosis terminal
Alone forevermore
Disbelieving
My life is ending soon I know
This diagnosis terminal
Alone forevermore
Disbelieving

You were waiting in my sullen dream
My reality

Incurable
Take me back to the way it used to be
All my dreams deprived
No more sense of life
My emotions collide
Biding forth my time

Diagnosis Terminal

My life is ending soon I know
This diagnosis terminal
Alone forevermore
Disbelieving
My life is ending soon I know
This diagnosis terminal
Alone forevermore
Disbelieving
