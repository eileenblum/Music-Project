The story is over
I can't get it out of my mind
Crippling thoughts rape internally
The incurable tragedy

Terminal cancer
This infliction engulfs me
Aware of the pain I yearn to reconsider

The story is over
I can't get it out of my mind
Crippling thoughts rape internally
The incurable tragedy

Now I realize I won't be leaving this hospital
I'm finished
The anguish is ripping me apart

The story is over
I can't get it out of my mind
Crippling thoughts rape
Internally
The incurable tragedy
