Immedicable
Irreversible
Lash out
Face my fears they're right before me
Rage envelops this state of mind

Malignancy
Why is this happening to me?
Spreading slowly
The pain is just too hard to take
Fate eternal
Eventual

Fade into the dark of the night
Soon I'll never feel the sun upon my face
Lift away this burden that plagues me
Indignation

I will die

Substance to escape what's started
Accepting this corruption
Feeling so alone and helpless
Curse unforeseen

Eradication
False acception
Reach out but let down
There's nothing for me
Life is nothing to me anymore

Fade into the dark of the night
Soon I'll never feel the sun upon my face
Lift away this burden that plagues me
Indignation

Malignancy
Why is this happening to me?
Spreading slowly
The pain is just too hard to take

Fade into the dark of the night
Soon I'll never feel the sun upon my face
Lift away this burden that plagues me
Indignation
