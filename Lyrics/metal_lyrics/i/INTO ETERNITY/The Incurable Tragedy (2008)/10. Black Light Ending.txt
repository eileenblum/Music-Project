Obscurity detains the light
Clear I have never forgotten
Blindness draining your belief
Consumed and absorbed all you had

Darkness sweeping envelop the fear
Blackness onward never ending

A black light ending
A black light ending

Imagining
Entranced by imagination
Hallucinate
Envisioning to remember
Commemorate
Reminisce a past existence

Memories remain dampened
Clouded thoughts are abandoned
Suppress and unremembered
Expired and unconscious

Darkness sweeping envelop the fear
Blackness onward never ending

A black light ending
A black light ending

Imagining
Entranced by imagination
Hallucinate
Envisioning to remember
Commemorate
Reminisce a past existence

A black light ending
A black light ending
A black light ending
