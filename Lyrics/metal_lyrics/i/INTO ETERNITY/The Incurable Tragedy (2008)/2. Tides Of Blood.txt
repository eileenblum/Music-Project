Unrelenting screams are deafened
Running away from this unknown pain
Barriers of reality
Scour the black for answers to
Questions unknown

Eyes awake it seems
This nightmare's ending
Clutching your chest
Wipe the sweat from your brow

There will be blood before the end
The tides of blood consume you
Your life is slowly taken
Fate lays the path before you

Premonitions of death flash before me
Turning away from this reverie
Rising tides flooding over me
Finding strength in solitude
Never-ending

Eyes awake
This nightmare's never ending
Clutching my chest
The pain begins

There will be blood before the end
The tides of blood consume you
Your life is slowly taken
Fate lays the path before you

Eyes awake
The blackness is surrounding
Grasping for strength
Face this dark certainty

There will be blood before the end
The tides of blood consume you
Your life is slowly taken
Fate lays the path before you

Tides of blood
