One funeral hymn for three

Loved ones gathered here
In this sorrow
Anthems sang
There's no tomorrow
Laying here cold and white
Empty with no soul

One last song for three
Sang to you from beyond
Funeral hymn
The end has passed
I now see so much clearer
Funeral hymn

Sacrament of the sick
Last rites were performed
Laid in the morgue
Entombed in darkness
Never to breathe again
Final farewell
These last words

Body embalmment for
Final preservation
Memories are all we have
For any resurrection
Lowered down into
My final resting place
This is an ending we must all embrace

One last song for three
Sang to you from beyond
Funeral hymn
The end has passed
I now see so much clearer
Funeral hymn

One funeral hymn for three
