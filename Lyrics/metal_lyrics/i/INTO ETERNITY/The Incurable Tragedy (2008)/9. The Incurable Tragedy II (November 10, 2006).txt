I'm on my knees but I can't follow
I'm sitting here alone abandoned torn apart
I'm on my knees I can't continue on
Emotionless and deserted

The incurable tragedy
The incurable tragedy

Tragedy

Frozen lost and out of time
Crossing to the other side
The ending came so suddenly
Now here I stand and there you lay
Endless grief conceding
Presuming
Allowing
Undaunted

The incurable tragedy
The incurable tragedy
