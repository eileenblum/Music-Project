Entranced by insanity
Entraced by the thoughts in my mind
I only want to be free
Fukushima

The candles were lit for the dead
Fukushima
The candles were lit for the dead
Rebuild and overcome

Situation deteriorating
An ongoing crisis
Decommissioned
Never to surrender

Arise
Emerge the victor
Overcome and Prevail
Outliving the weather

Fukushima
Transcend and engulf a new life
Obtain and dominate
Fukushima

The candles were lit for the dead
Fukushima
The candles were lit for the dead
Rebuild and overcome
