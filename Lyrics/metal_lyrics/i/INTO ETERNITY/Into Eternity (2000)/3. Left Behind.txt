I've seen my life burned
Before my eyes
Out of control it's too late
Too late to say goodbye
Enter a new state of mind
Release me from it all
Exit all problems that I've
Worried for far too long
Soon free

Cast out left behind
Acceptance will take time
My cards laid on the table
I'm coping can this be
Why is this happening to me?

Drowning you push
Me under water

Left behind

Dig down I'll be found
Closing the coffin now
Forget of my existance
Don't worry, now I'm free
Already forgotten me
Hammer the nails and
Close my tomb

Soon free
