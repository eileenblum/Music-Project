Fog thickens the air
Falling into a sea of despair
Dreams of a rescue
Entangles then tears
Silence through virtue
Imagination twisting
A false way of thinking
Trapped in the sorrow

Sinking deeper
Undying denial

Innocence stolen
Never forgotten
Forgive not forget
As the bullet
Leaves the chamber
Silence through virtue

Discouraged to speak again
The blame is all too real
Controlling endlessly
A constant blackened fear

Sinking deeper
Undying denial


Thanks to desert.eagle for sending track #10 lyrics.
