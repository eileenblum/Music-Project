Sometimes I wonder what went wrong
Do I even belong here at all no
Where am I how did I get here
Wale me up from this nightmare
I don't deserve this no one does

And then he stared into the sky
Feeding his fright denying
Feeling the pain hear the screaming
I don't want to die

Clear my mind
So many times I've tried I've failed
So many people slaughtered
Don't they have a conscience
Slaves brainwashed to be that way

The darkness clouds I can't see
Will I see my family
They pray
Would they die for me
Bury me
