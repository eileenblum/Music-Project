Look to the sky
Reassuring wondering
Look to the sky
Cleansing suffering
Cleaning all wounds

Nailed to the cross
Life drifting away
Ripped apart from the inside
Crown of thorns
Sands of time slipping away

Torn
Torn apart

Skies are blackening
Mind is wondering
Withdraw all emotion
Lost helpless
Thoughts begin to sway
