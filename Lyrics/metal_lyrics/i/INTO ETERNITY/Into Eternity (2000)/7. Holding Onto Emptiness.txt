Holding onto emptiness
Lock yourself in guilt
Self conscienceness mass ignorance
Changing once more

Overtake
Enraged
Controlling the mind
Senses destroyed
Torrent of rage
Overtake master your fate
Boiling point
Channel out hate

Surpass weakness redemption
Giving up giving in
Forming twisting
Turning into something else
Thrown off track
Relenting anger

Emptiness
