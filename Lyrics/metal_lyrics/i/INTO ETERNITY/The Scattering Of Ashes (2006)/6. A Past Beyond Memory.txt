Hiding again behind your wall
Decay decline a downfall
A failure forgotten out of time
Collapse so long ago

Drifting on
Lost on the way
A past beyond memory

Gone past the point of no return
Lead to a place so far gone
The dark embraces all your fears
Someday you'll rise again

Drifting on
Lost on the way
A past beyond memory

[solo]

Drifting on
Lost the way
A past beyond memory
Minutes seems to pass away
Lost upon my way
A past beyond memory
