Sailing of sea of lies
Of perfect unformity
Created stimulated
Fabricate the falsification

Suspension of Disbelief

And I fall into the ocean
Will you be there to rescue me?
As I start to take on water
Drowning me

Commencing your ending
Believing falsity
Your ending inception
Consummating your demise

Suspension of disbelief

And I fall into ocean
Will you be there to rescue me?
As i start to take on water
Drowning me

[solo]

Sailing on the sea of doubt
Believing the forgery
Distorting your invention
Fabricate the falsification

Suspension of disbelief
Suspension of disbelief

And I fall into ocean
Will you be there to rescue me?
As I start to take on water
Drowning me

[solo]

And I fall into ocean
Will you be there to rescue me?
As I start to take on water
Drowning me
Drowning me
Drowning me

Commencing your ending
Believing falsity
Your ending inception
Consummating your demise
