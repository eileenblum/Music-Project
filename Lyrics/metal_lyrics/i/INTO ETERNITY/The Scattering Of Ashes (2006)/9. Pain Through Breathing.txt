Pulling away slowly
Scurrying on
Wending through the land escape
An absence of data

Void of all emotion
Hoping this day is my last

Chasing the unobtainable
Believing my own lies
On the path of self destruction
Strangled by all emotion

Blur the edges of my memory
Pain through the breathing
Drown myself to help forget
Silence all my thinking

[solo]

Chasing the unobtainable
Believing my own lies
On the path of self destruction
Strangled by all emotion

Blur the edges of my memory
Pain through the breathing
Drown myself to help forget
Silence all my thinking

[solo]

There's no believing
There's no returning
There's no beginning

Blur the edges of my memory
Pain through the breathing
Drown myself to help forget
Silence all my thinking
