Running away from within
Emptiness follows you there
Rapidly shift inside
Swallowed by apathy

Flowing perpetual streaming
Your dismay is concerning

Paralyzed
With fear in your eyes
Paralyzed
The fear won't subside

Bleeding until deep despair
Grasped to corrupted lies
Never to falter again and again
Your truth has long since died

Flowing perpetual streaming
Your dismay is concerning

Paralyzed
With fear in your eyes
Paralyzed
The fear won't subside

[solo]

Paralyzed
With fear in your eyes
Paralyzed
The fear won't subside
