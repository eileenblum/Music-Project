Your destiny in despair
Offered no escape
Chronic burden terminal
Winds of plague
End this dream

Out of sight
Out of mind
Shades of black despondency
Out of sight
Out of mind
My spirit crushed by agony

Out of sight
Out of mind
Going blind
Out of sight
Out of mind
Walking blind

Abandon hope relinquish
Undo this creation
Ethereal collapse terminal
Cast aside
Wither away

As the light in your eyes
Fade from your lifeless body
Transcending on your way out

Desperation dejection
An eventual ending
Spiraling into a void
Lethal end incurable

Standing on the ledge
Euthanasia
Going over the edge
Not the answer

As the light in your eyes
Fade from your lifeless body
Transcending on your way out

[solo]

Standing on the ledge
Euthanasia
Going over the edge
Not the answer

As the light in your eyes
Fade from your lifeless body
Transcending on your way out
