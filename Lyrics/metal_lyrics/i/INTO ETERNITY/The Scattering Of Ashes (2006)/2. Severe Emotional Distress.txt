Cutting yourself to relieve the pain
Try to believe that you are same
Self mutilation to self redemption
Now you're on your own

Cutting yourself despondency
Mental distress overwhelming now
Cold blunt steel now is critical
Now your on your own
Now your on your own

Severe Emotional Distress

Separate the Anguish
Separate this fear
Separate from sadness
Now I see things much to clear

Cutting yourself a dependency
Anxiety mixed with agony
Bleed out the grief with a knife
Now your on your own

Cutting yourself end this wretchedness
Tribulation will not finish this
Lacerations cannot help you
Now your on your own
Now your on your own

Severe Emotional Distress

Separate the Anguish
Separate this fear
Separate from sadness
Now I see things much to clear

[solo]

Separate the Anguish
Separate this fear
Separate from sadness
Now I see things much to clear
