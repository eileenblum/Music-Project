Selling your God
Preaching the word of the
fallen one
Asking your price
Your fee will be damnation

Sinners selling God door to door
Masking lies
Why do you?

Sell God

Follow the Lord will set you free
Hoping to live for eternity
Led to believe he was the one
Your life returned
It wasn't gone

Sell God
