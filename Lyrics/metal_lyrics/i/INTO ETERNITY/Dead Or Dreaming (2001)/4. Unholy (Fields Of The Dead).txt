Unholy Holocaust
A mass suicide
among us
Convey my crucifix
Pleading for release

Walk through the 
fields of the Dead
This garden swallowing me
Walk through the
fields of the Damned
Falling down, imprisoning me

Staring eyes are piercing
Hear the children laughing
Twisting wounds
that never heal
Infesting with a choking fear

Nothing here is as it seems
Silent screams haunting me
Dialysis contorting viens
Destroying all that
was meant to be
