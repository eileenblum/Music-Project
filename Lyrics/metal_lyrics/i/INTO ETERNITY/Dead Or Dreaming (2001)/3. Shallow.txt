Disillusional thoughts
infect your view
Assets fuel your shallowed
integrity
Lost in a world of rejection
Expose the hell you cannot hide
An outcast of society
An orphan of life's reality
Retribution time will come
Sarcastic ridicule confining

I fail to perceive or
understand
You failed to maintain,
gone astray

Liquid promises drain
with your lies
Blaming others before
yourself
Forgotten disposable fool
caught in a fictional
daydream
Skeptic, unbeliever
Taking everything for granted
Shallow
