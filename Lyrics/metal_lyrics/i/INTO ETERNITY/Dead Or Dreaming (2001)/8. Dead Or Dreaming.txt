Led down the path of darkness
A black trial of despair
Entranced, lost momentarily
Walking on

End it all
Walk that path again

Fabricate my existence
Into the unknown
Confronting, accepting eternity

End it all
Walk that path again
Is it over?
Am I Dead or Dreaming?
Occupy my time remembering
the way it used to be
Contemplate suicide
End this life
End this life now
