Endless sorrow
No tomorrow for me
End this misery
Endless sorrow
No tomorrow
Alleviate the suffering
Suffering

Abominate absolution of the soul
Accommodate the noose tied
Around my throat

Desecrated, conpensated
Dissolution drawing nearer
Verdict in, judgement down
Sentenced, Revolution
Revolution

Reward my soul
Denial
