You look into the mirror
The mirror
A distant pale future you fear
The mirror

Life has failed you for the last time
Existence declining
Chasing something that cannot be
Fade into eternity

Daydreams of death
Your destiny's unclear
False hopes and promises
are misleading

You look into the mirror
The mirror
A distant pale future you fear
The mirror
