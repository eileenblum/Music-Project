Seven days of worship
Insomnia sets in
Vision is your weakness
A modem to the afterlife

Cyber Messiah
Linked to your master
Alive but not living
A screen  Your salvation

Kneel at your throne
Kiss the plastic cross
Bow down to your God
A religion beyond reason
Weakness by time
Process the data
Your life an illusion
No will of your own

Alone in your chapel
Singing praises of thanks
Idol worship and defication
A higher form of reason
A ritual that's non-existent
Negative, nothingness
Layout your sacrifice...your life
