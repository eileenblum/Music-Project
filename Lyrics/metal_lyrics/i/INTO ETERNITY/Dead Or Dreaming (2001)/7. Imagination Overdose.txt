Distorted
Can't recognize or recall
Deformity
Everything's misproportioned

The more drugs injected
The more sights contorting
Imagination overdose

Addicted
Lost all control
Intake
Venom in the veins
Absorbing
Detained anxiety
Confinement
Imprisoning decay

Abstraction
Dispensed nervousness
Immolation
Body is sacrificed
Tearing
Ripped apart, Discerp,
Strangulation
End this suffering
