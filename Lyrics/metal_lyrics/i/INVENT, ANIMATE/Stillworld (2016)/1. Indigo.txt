harvester of the night
there are no secrets left anymore
we reap, and sow, and follow the road.
the dead weight finally brought me down;

but I will resurface.
in stillness, came balance, and ears to hear.
but all I know is so frail at this moment in time,
push me aside.

hanging on the edge of what Iâve been told,
and whoâs to say that it was your mind to mold?
restore control, mend your broken bones,
there is more to be found.

every path has a beginning and end,
but I never chose where to begin.
if love is what weâre living in, so be it.
Iâm not afraid anymore.

the great unknown, is all I've ever wanted to know.
a journey not about myself, but about the test of time

weightless love, you know me so well.
weightless love, you know me so well
weightless love, you know me so well
weightless love, you know me so well

weightless love.

stripped down to nothing, humble and shameful,
I have nothing to lose
bring me back to dust, start again
I have nothing to offer.
I have nothing to lose
I am dust once again, in the endless blue.

every path has a beginning and end,
every soul has a story to lend,
tell me how you perceive this life you live,
tell me do you watch it slip away?

all the knowledge you've ever retained,

burn what you know
burn what you love and start anew.
what's left of it all, is the truth.
burn what you love,
whatâs left of it all,
is the only truth.
