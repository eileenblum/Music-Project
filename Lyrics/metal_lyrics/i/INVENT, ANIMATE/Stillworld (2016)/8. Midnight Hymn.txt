I was just giving in.
I was just spending my time
All of my time, in my head
While the outside of me was dead.
I was just giving in.

When we speak, we create,
When we love, we relate.

Exist, for just a fraction of a second
And you know youâre alone.
Paint myself in purity,
Lose myself in weightless love,

Close my eyes, as the world goes away.
Call it emptiness, or call it grace.
To never know, is not the saving face.

When we speak, we create,
When we love, we relate.

The audible mind, meets the mind awake
We align our thoughts, to mold like clay.
Quiescent beings, of the new age.
Find your way, find your way

Exist, for just a fraction of a second
And know youâre alone.
Paint myself in purity,
Lose myself in weightless love.

The aura hides in a sacred place.
Quiescent beings of the new age,
Find your way, find your way, with me.
In this solitary state, every word has weight.
We align our thoughts, to mold like clay.
Find your way, find your way.
