All Iâve ever longed for,
was it a waste of time, or will I get mine?
Abandon me, and Iâll adapt to the loss.

What a dark and fragile place this is,
I am stuck in between the lines of understanding
What it is to merely exist, and to prosper.

I canât believe Iâm alive,
amidst the world taking away everything I am.

all I am, all I am.
all I've ever longed for, was it a waste of time, or will I get mine?
abandon me, and I'll adapt to the loss.
quintessential growth, in the palm of your hand.
winter embrace me and all I am.
forgotten souls bask in the bitter cold.

The feeling of being cherished, is an unfamiliar one
leave me be under the leaves, in the wake of spring,
I'll be descending in my sinking sleep.

Wishful thinkers,
We are the ones with a seed of hope,
With no space to grow.
We are the ones,
That hold what little we have so close
My mind longs to be still once more

What a dark and fragile place this is
I am stuck in between the lines of understanding
What it is to merely exist, and to prosper.
But in my mind, I'll be fine
But in my mind, Iâll be fine
I am forever in debt, to the ones who left.

I would never ask the world a favor,
it would never happen
