Native tongues,
We have accepted
That we can never see eye to eye
With one another
Fear remains on your soul, and as life unfolds,
You have become the tale untold.

Bury me under dirt and sorrow,
Like a broken dream
This was never meant to be
End the noise, end it now
Slow voices surround me,
With nowhere to go,
I refuse to listen.

Empty stares from uneasy eyes,
I see you're dead inside
Stuck in gloom, so soon
Am I in the wrong?
Am I losing ground?

The judgement you speak
Has skewed all clarity.
Pacing around the room,
All the eyes are now on you.

Empty stares from uneasy eyes,
I see you're dead inside
Stuck in gloom, so soon

The outcast in me,
Can see right through
The desperation in you.

I have just one word of advice
A message to the stray:
You've become stagnant,
You've become tame,
Stop living halfway, stop living halfway.
Stop living halfway.
