How long has it been,
Since I was reassured,
That everything will be alright in the end?
Tell me the things I never wanted to hear.
All this time, you tried to fix what wasnât even broken.

Tread on me, subconsciously.
Give me what I lack,
There is no turning back.
Holding my tongue, was holding me down,
I couldnât say anything as you watched me drown.
You watched me.
You walked on me.

You watched me.
You walked on me.
Ruined me from the inside out.
Watch me fall apart

The here and now is such a daunting task.
Every part of me has changed,
But thereâs something inside of me,
That stayed the same.

The nights are cold, and the days are bleak.
Like the oldest tree, I am weak.
Iâll live on, away from it all.
Itâs the only way Iâll find
Where I really belong.

Tread on me, subconsciously.
Give me what I lack,
There is no turning back.
The undeniable remains.
The truth will always sting.

How can I learn to love at all,
When everything is so temporary?
How can I learn to love at all,
When everything is so temporary?
