Everything you love, you let down,
Tell me is it wrong to love at all?
Call me the victim, call me the failure
The ice gets thinner, as I break through layers

Treading through the boundless,
I rebuke the blessing that I never received
In hopes of a wish, the hopeless one Iâll never keep

A thousand times before, Iâve been here
On the outside looking in
Poisoned thoughts, from those somber days

I've become the darker half.
This is the part of me
I want to go away
I am abhorred;
And allured by this current state of darkness
And in retrospect,

I could never be, a shepherd without the sheep
A forest without the trees, an empire without a king.
Ambition without a dream, the sand without the sea.
In darkness, light persists
In weakness, we resist.

My former self was a cry for help.
Closed off to the world and ones I love,
A lost cause, with an ounce of hope,
Clinging to it with everything in me.
A chapter lost, is a lesson gained.
May the fire that resides, still remain
Remove the thorns from my side,
Luminous sky above, hear my cry

All my life, the angst and agony
Take me away, this is my final plea

I could never be, a shepherd without the sheep
A forest without the trees, an empire without a king.
Ambition without a dream, the sand without the sea.
In darkness, light persists
In weakness, we resist.
In darkness, light persists
In weakness, we resist.
