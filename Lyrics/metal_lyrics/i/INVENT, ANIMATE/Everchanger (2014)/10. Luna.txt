I wish I knew you more.
I wished that feeling away,
and it always comes back,
comes back in my head very late,
when I rest my head to lay,
my thoughts get the best of me.
That day,
the clouds hung over me.
That day,
it seems so distant.
Brother,
do you watch over me?
Brother,
why do you linger in my mind?
On my own.
You have no business haunting those you loved.
Don't know exactly
where you are,
in the afterlife.
My brother,
i cared so much.
Forced to grow on my own.
Forced to fill your shoes, and to take on the world.
Forced to grow on my own.
Forced to fill your shoes, and to take on the world.
To take on the world.
Now time has left me to heal.
You disappeared, you disappeared.
The last thing I want to do is feel.
You had a brother, you had a brother.
Now time has left me here to heal.
The last thing that I want to do is feel.
Brother,
do you wanted over me?
Brother,
why do you linger inside my mind?
Despite what I've said,
I'm not bitter,
only regretful of the time
we didn't spend.
The laughs we didn't share.
The brother
you could have been.
