I have so much faith in the fact that things will all go wrong.
I'd never doubt that.
I'll never doubt it again.
Struggling with the fear, it's eating me alive.
I need a chance to survive.
Hate, subconscious rage, relapse again into my ways.
Reshape the philosophy of what I see versus what I believe.
Burdened by the weight on my back I don't know exactly where I went wrong.
With my own eyes I've seen the innocent die, I watched the multitudes lie through their teeth to all the homeless in the streets.
I hear them say they want a truth, and they want peace, they want it handed to them,
and they don't even want to dig.
Paint my insides black, not like it matters in the end.
I'll do whatever it takes to get me in.
And on my skin, I'll paint it white, I'm free from sin.
I'm free from sin, oh god I'm desperate.
I need to feel heaven in my hands.
Wandering, my mind, we go our separate ways.
I found my faith in relation again.
I reconsider every moment that I spend.
I have so much faith in the fact that things will all go wrong.
I'll never doubt that, I'll never doubt it again.
Struggling with the fear, it's eating me alive.
I need a chance to survive.
Just know, I didn't want to assume the worst.
Just know, I didn't want to be of this world.
I know that I always assume the worst.
I know the world assumes the worst of me.
And now I feel the judgement of the masses.
There's no "I think I believe", there's only things I can see.
Lingering in the basement of your mind is that fear that you were wrong all along.
It's my deepest fear.
Go on, expose the truth for what it is.
