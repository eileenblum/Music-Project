Let my guard down;
throw me on the floor.
I lost the only crutch that I had.
Another fail safe; another guarantee,
I'll surrender with a "let me be".
And now I promise that I'm not the only cynic, I'm just so numb to the world.
So frail, so pessimistic.
I never wanted to be this way.

Dusk awaits, bringing somber feelings,
Forever hiding behind a mask I made,
I walk the same path everyday,
It gets darker, but it feels the same.

The truth is lost.
Where do I turn when I question myself?
Where do I turn when I lose someone else?
The truth is lost.

I lost faith in you.
I lost faith in me.
[2x]

And I'm clinging to the here and now.
And I'm feeling, like I've never felt at all.
Draped in a cloak that hides my skin, but not my shame.
Ease my mind beyond what I've been feeling.
This is the real me, and I want out alive.

Dusk awaits, bringing somber feelings,
Forever hiding behind a mask I made,
I walk the same path everyday,
It gets darker, but it feels the same.

Where do I turn when this aura surrounds me?
Where is I turn when I question myself?
I'm losing sleep.
Where do I turn when this aura surrounds me?
I'm losing sleep.
I'm losing sleep.
