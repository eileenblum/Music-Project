Don't believe in love,
it will let you down.
I believe in loss,
when I hear,
when I hear the sound.
I felt it once, when I was young,
and so indifferent to all the things
being pushed my way again and again.
It intertwines.
In a perfect world there would be purity,
perfect moon, perfect sun, together in harmony.
We're living in all this fire.
Ignore the ether, it's much to far away.
The feeling of loss is what I know too well.
Send me back to the sky and I will start anew.
Detrimental bliss,
I would give it all up to start again.
Lost track of time,
and if I had the chance,
I would lose it all,
I would lose it all again,
as rooted as I am.
Don't believe in love,
it will let you down.
I believe in loss,
when I hear,
when I hear the sound.
The song in the distance
Let me down.
Let me down.
Let me down, let me down gently.
I'm not bind this time.
Love let me down again.
I don't believe a thing.
Love let me down again.
I won't believe a fucking thing I hear ever again.
Pull me back in the dark,
it's been calling me for years,
I've been taking my time,
and I push it aside.
Pull me back in the dark,
it's been calling me for years,
it's been taking my time,
and it's taking my life.
Pull me back into the dark.
Pull me back into the dark.
Pull me back into the dark.
Pull me back.
