[feat. Jesse Cash of ERRA]Take notice, the everchanging is all around you.
Take notice, the everlasting is nowhere to be found.
An innocent night, can't hear as you cry,
"What the fuck am I missing?"
And as you fall and sink to the ground, some loved ones die, some loved ones fight to survive.

Do you see the flowers fade?
Do you feel the sun and its rays?
Another day in the life of a passerby.
A sonder stare, a frozen mind.
No one is here to last.
I am the here and now.

Internal disharmony.
I can't breathe.
External tranquility.
For once, I can breathe.
It's a delicate ecosystem, and somewhere in the core of you, you'll find a warmth that's unexplainable.
In the wake of a new day.

In the wake of a new day,
You'll see that you're not the victim,
It's a simple structure,
The universe is the victim.

I've been under siege,
And overthinking it,
Thinking endlessly,
And now I know the truth,
Walls are built to be broken down.
It's all built to be broken down.

Take notice, take notice.

In the wake of a new day,
You'll see that you're not the victim,
It's a simple structure,
The universe is the victim.

An innocent night, can't hear as you cry,
"What the fuck am I missing?"
And as you fall and sink to the ground, some loved ones die, some loved ones fight to survive.
