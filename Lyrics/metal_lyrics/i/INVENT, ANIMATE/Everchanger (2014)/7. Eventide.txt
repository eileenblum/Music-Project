Adrift a vessel,
into the never.
Undisputed,
just like the violent weather.
Violent weather
Inhale, breathe it in.
Reveal, reveal.
Assembled by hands with a vision,
to find reason without religion.
Have you ever thought that the world could be wrong?
The most intelligent minds never sit on the throne.
Crooked motion,
has swayed us back,
we'll turn it around,
the acceptance we lack.
Fall deeper with me,
the further we fall,
the more beauty we'll see.
Reveal.
Fall deeper with me,
the further we fall,
the more beauty we'll see.
Reveal.
The modern unveiling is here
Reveal
Inhale now,
breathe it in.
Inhale now,
breathe it in.
The unveiling is here.
It's time to retrace our steps, and walk a new direction.
I'm sick of losing ground, and absence of progression.
I'm sick of passed down beliefs, every generation.
Uncage the free mind, and unshackle the free hands.
This vessel leads us to the promise land.
The unveiling is here.
Inhale now, breathe it in.
Inhale now, breathe it in.
Fall deeper with me,
the further we fall,
the more beauty we'll see.
Fall deeper with me,
the further we fall,
the more beauty we'll see.
