We wait until the best things are gone,
to realize they were the best things.
We wait for the moon to replace the sun,
to think about what weighs us down.
Make me realize just what I have.
I won't leave this earth
with an uneasy mind.
Hold on, hold on
A future is what I fear.
A future I did not envision.
Hold on, hold on
A future is what I fear.
A future I did not envision.
You've made me, shaped me into
Exactly who I need to be
I just want to be there for the end.
I don't want to lose you, but I know I have to.
Left here is the mold of a man,
that you guided, that you guided.
A part of me, is you, and we will live on.
I won't let this slow me down,
I won't let this carry on,
if a future is what I fear,
then i will create my own.
Onward.
Onward to the future I fear so much.
We wait until the best things are gone,
to realize they were the best things.
We wait for the moon to replace the sun,
to think about what weighs us down.
Hold on, hold on.
A future is what i fear.
A future I did not envision.
Onward, to the future I fear so much.
Onward, to the future I fear so much.
Onward.
Onward.
I will face it with my worn down soul.
