Wandering, with no intention,
gave me reason to stay and grow,
I will not decay.
Rotting from the inside out,
no sense of direction,
weathered and hollow,
I will not decay, not decay.
I refuse to take things as they are,
the eyes of the world are much different from mine.
I will shift with the winds, and I'll grow as my own.
Seasons change but I am a constant.
Take me home.
Everyday searching endlessly for my motive to be, and something to make me feel whole again.
The sweet embrace of home has withered away, and I am left standing in the cold. Take me home
Take me home.
The sweet embrace of home has withered away.
Take me home.
And I'm left standing in the cold.
Take me home
The working hands, and a broken man,
amount to nothing, but a house on the sand.
So many wandering years, on my own two feet, the rugged terrain is rougher than it seems.
No sense of direction, and no sense of time,
Up in the sky, will you be my guide?
Up in the sky, where can I confide?
I swear to you, I won't forget you in this life.
I am the only constant.
I am the only constant.
Wandering, with no intention,
gave me reason to stay and grow,
I will not decay.
Rotting from the inside out,
no sense of direction,
weathered and hollow,
I will not decay, not decay.
I am the only constant.
The sweet embrace of home has withered away.
I am the only constant.
I'm left standing in the cold.
I will shift with the winds, and I'll grow as my own.
I will shift with the winds, and I'll grow as my own.
I am home.
