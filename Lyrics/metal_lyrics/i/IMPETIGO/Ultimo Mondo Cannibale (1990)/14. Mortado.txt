Running through the jungle
Running not to die
Mortado and the Cannibals
Mortado crucified!

Skewered to a tree
Mondo torture hell
Mortado and the Cannibals
Mortado lived to tell...

Sticks and stones can break my bones
But natives cannot hurt me!
I lived through hell, I lived to tell
Because the Cannibals deserted me!

Through my hands and feet were driven
Cricifixion nails
And now you're paying to hear
My horrible cannibal tales!
