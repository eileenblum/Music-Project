Innocent women, hacked to pieces
The killer smears and fondles
The Bloody Mess!!!!
I can't help but look...
I can't help but stare!!

Razor blades slicing, and jabbing, and ripping
Crimson intestinal eye-slashing death!
I can't help but look...
I can't help but stare!!

"...to satisfy my thirsty needs,
to tension out,
I've got to see the guilty bleed
my own path to glory...

Kidnap a bitch, a slave to my pain
a in her head
bruise her fuckin' brain...
and when she's unconcious
and blood begins to flow
my black heart laughs
and I really start to go...

Slice and stab and pound and chew
finger fucking the open wounds
of the deserving dog, the bitch,
my mouth in her guts
stretching elastic tissue
cumming with the stench,
licking her nostrils,
holding back my erection...

The rusty knife peeling back
layers of virgin cunt flesh
my fat greasy fingers
covered in shit, teethmarks of
hatred tatooed in death
I feel pure and holy..."

Sheer violence, vicious intent
Blood stained fingers ripping flesh bare!
I can't help but stare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
