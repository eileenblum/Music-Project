[Lyrics: Stevo /february 1990 / Music: Stevo and Mark /january 1991]

Wearing the disguise of the working class
I use my occupation to fulfill my desires,
When you're dead you'll be mine at last
You cold, naked body, recently expired
How can I resist
your sagging breasts?
Lain on the table, you smell of sterile death
When I put the embalming
needle into your flesh so blue
I place my throbbing penis inside of you...
My tools are ready... your
insides to dispose
I caress your slick abdominal cavity... my desire grows
I lick your icy ear and fondle your lungs and toes
I come... while my tongue is buried in your nose...
OHH...
[...solo: Scott ...]
The stench of your decay arouses me... alone in the prep room no one to see
our disgusting sexual lust, no one will know... I'm alive, you and I are all
alone... I want... to take... your cadaver home... I swear I'll never leave
you... always yours... my love...
[...solo: Scott ...]
