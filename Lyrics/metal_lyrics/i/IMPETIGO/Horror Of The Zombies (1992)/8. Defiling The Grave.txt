[lyrics and music: Stevo /may 199?]

Stalking through the black of night
Unholy ghoul's lust for blood
The human vampire in the crypt
The seek dead flesh to carry on
Their morbid life no one can save...
Defiling the grave...
Cement bonds are torn away
The insane might they now display
Their hunger for the stench of death
To violate the resting place
The unholy fiends, the blood they crave...
Defiling the grave...
[...solo: Mark...]
Ripping caskets inside out
The evil ghouls scream and shout
And dance with corpses in the night
Devour the rotten flesh
The maggots crawl in the Satan's name...
Defiling the grave...
