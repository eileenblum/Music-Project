You're not important!
Being unique is a concept!

Yeah, its You!

Who are investing way too much time,
Over the uselessness of the Self
The Guinea Pig, nothing but another stupid loathful subject
Say it, Shoot it, Tell Them!
Say it, Fuck it, Shoot THEM!

And it compels you,
The complete lack of goals and values
Repeating without ever learning, futile attempts
To upgrade your condition, lame as ever

To leave the cushion comfort of your flat existence,
What a curious thought?
Isn't it?

Under the gaze of a lavish sky, how can you not feel humble?

You're so pretty in pink,
I'll think I'll grab myself a cold one and watch you explode...
Except I'm no messiah, well damn....
Come to think about it, I still own my .357

Shout it, Shoot it, Human!
Think about it you Fuck and Shoot THEM!
