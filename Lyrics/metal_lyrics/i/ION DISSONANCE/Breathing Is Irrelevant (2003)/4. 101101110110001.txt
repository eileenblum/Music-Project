Gazing at a silver screen, I wonder not...
What am I waiting for? Streaming?
Wait, Wait, loading binary instructions
Drowned in surrounding CPU resolution,

Absorbed by this unique light of Datas

Drone!

In this machinery's lore, I'm constantly seeking some...

A discreet anomalism... and I'm distracted, from this not so obvious purpose that I'm trying to reach (in vain).

Disturbed, yet its just a coffee spot, lyin' on the table.
One of many, and maybe the only fragment of reality I had in weeks
(Can't tell, have'nt count)

I remember now; this substance must be injected by oral means.
