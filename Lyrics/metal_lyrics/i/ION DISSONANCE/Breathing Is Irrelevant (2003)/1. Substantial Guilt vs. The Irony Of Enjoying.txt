And I lay numb, waiting for something worst to happen

Sweet innocence, it happened so suddenly

She crossed my path on the way to nothingness
I knew that was encountering an angel of Purity
And in the process I've quickly understood
That I dont deserve her, none of us, humans, do

Beholding such a fatality leaves you empty with bitter grief
Life seems to be tarnished and sour, raped in its very essence
But sorrow is rapidly replaced by frustration, envy &amp; despair

Dressed in White,
A child so alone, so fragile and beautiful has dawn
To hold her close was exhilarating in a most vicious way
I felt so weak, yet empowered somehow

One thing leading to another,
I knew then, that if I could not experience nor possess Purity,
I would at least try to take it and choke the life out of it

And I did, oh why, I dont know but I did...

Violently, I've pummelled her face with my bare fists
Until she became awfully deformed, bleeding and dying, all twisted up in terror...

I have forcefully replaced every teeth in her mouth by razorsharp shards of glass,
Slowly inserting every pieces of glass in the little one's gum

Why was I laughing? (In complete (dis)harmony with her screams)

I guess that is my Art,
To inflict upon Purity the only thing I can give,
And unfortunetly its not love

I should've feel guilty, I know,
But it simply didn't occur
