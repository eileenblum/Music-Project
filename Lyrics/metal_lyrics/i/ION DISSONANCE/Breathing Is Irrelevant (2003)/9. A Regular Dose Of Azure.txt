As a flower, she bloomed
Once her wrists were opened

I remember her scent, intoxicating

My communication with her was clearly enhance
But hers was quickly fading, discontinued and frail
Her eyes reflected a hopeless apprehension,
For a compassionate smile, a misplaced melancholy

Liquid-Azure, she stared at me...
Like when we used to drink to much cocktails
On Sundays afternoon...

I remember her heart-breaking smile, now beautifully distorted
Agony and orgasms combined, I swear

Don't worry girl, everything is going to be alright

Can't wait till she sober up and realise what is truly happening
She seem gently desperate, numb and on the verge of collapsing

But that I cannot allow
This is a Test and I couldn't get more sentimental

I'm feeling her pulse, slowing down, foreshadowing a very long and quiet season,
Of dreamlike serenity.... I'll miss her so much

(Ether died as a martyr, unknown, in a secluded asylum)
