I'll reap vengeance upon the weak.
My desperation mirrors your future so bleak.
I'll reap vengeance upon the weak.
I'll gratify my action so to speak.
The massacre of hundreds of innocent humans echoes through me, like the chorus of a symphonic orchestra.
Fear imprinted in their eyes so deeply, deep.
I'll reap vengeance upon the weak.
My desperation mirrors your future so bleak.
I'll reap vengeance upon the weak.
I'll gratify my actions so to speak.
Reap vengeance, on everyone who dared to call me a freak.
Pleading for mercy to be kept alive, for a brief moment longer.
Only to shatter a glimpse of hope held so dear, of one day seeing sunlight again.
My dementia praecox has pushed me over the edge to unstableness.
Failure to react has led us here.
Pushing this illness to new extremes.
Feel this, my desperation.
Hear my plea, my desperation.
Feel this, my desperation.
Conceive my desire to inflict retribution.
A distant memory of roaming these streets daily overshadows me.
The mind numbing sensation that I could have accomplished so much more.
Is it any wonder why we're are all here today?
I am the mastermind behind your demise, a victim of abuse now willing to die for his gratification.
I'll reap vengeance upon the weak.
My desperation mirrors your future so bleak.
I'll reap vengeance upon the weak.
I'll gratify my actions so to speak.
Who knew I was capable of such barbarism?
