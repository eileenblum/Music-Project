Solaris
Since she left I'm sleepless,
A year passed by since the
"She's Strychnine" (incident,)
I've swallowed it and survived... (apparently)

And now, due to its nature, history repeats itself....... she's gone

Her, the knife that brought an edge to my life
Remember when you use to cry out of pleasure and complete orgasm when we made love?

Tell me!
How could you take Solaris away from me? How?

Why the fuck did you have to go and put us through this?
Pound my dreams in to dust, did I truly deserve this?
Am I that repulsive?

Take away all that I had that was pure and true and give it to an insignificant piece of shit?
How can I possibly have faith for a better future now, you fucking life ruining bitch!

And still you're trying to play as if you had done nothing wrong...
If only I could erase everything we lived together...

No, instead I'm condemened to love you still.

...this is useless...
I could go on forever...

...you are useless...
I will go on forever
