And I donât know for how long. How much longer Iâll be able to take this shit from you, and now your ostentatious behavior is getting way out of line. Unceasingly battling with myself to play this off like it was nothing. To be a bigger man than you could ever hope to be, but this has gone on for too long. This ends here. Just who do you think you are? Chump. Take a step back. Realize youâre insignificant. Take a step back. Realize youâre insignificance. What infuriates most with this, how could you not conceive this would eventually get back to you? A profound ignorance clearly voiced. The time has come to crush you. Take a step back. Comprehend youâre insignificance. Take a step back. Realize youâre insignificant. In the end it caught up to you.
