The truth will set you free. Glancing around the room, but everyoneâs so hollow. Where did all the people go? What resides now is this perception of vertigo. Iâve ascended so high and I would love to come back down. Plant my feet back on the ground. With these lights turned down low Iâll get through this nice and slow. The truth will set you free. Ardently searching, but all the masses do is follow. Apprehensive of the sea, but these waters remain shallow. This bond has been cut dry. My aim is true. Those tired out words you shout somehow rang true. The truth will set you free. Questioning rigorously, but all the masses do is follow. Apprehensive of the sea, but these waters remain shallow. Running up a slippery slope, but weâre standing on the gallows. Never knowing how arduous these times are destined to be. Grinding hard to comprehend all that we come to bear. Constraints in life can break you down at times. In due time the truth will set me free. Iâm still striving to find my place in this world. Grateful for the chances Iâve been given.
