Even though I know I canât just turn back the hands of time, weâve got to make this right. For ages now weâve been maneuvered and mislead down a wayward path. Down a path of hate. Down a path of lies. Swindling spiral of deceit pointing towards demise. Heavily chastised. While fueling unheard cries. The cunning un-dead sneakingly disguised. For too long now we have been forced to endure a one sided structured life. The strength of this democracy is not derived from its corrupted leaders, but more so from the multitudes who gather here to stand tall in opposition. An insurgent uprising is underway. A malcontent revolt assimilating in this time. Itâs our obligation to try. Constrained for ages now while knowingly mislead down this wayward path. Rain down your asinine laws. Rain down the impending storm. We stand united for the cause. Resisting the pressures to conform. Weâll never conform. Bring on your ill-tempered forces. Bring on the urgency to adapt. Down a path of hate. Down a path of lies. A swindling spiral of deceit pointing towards demise. Heavily chastised. While fueling unheard cries. The cunning un-dead sneakingly disguised. We wonât stand by and act like we are supposed to just let it go. We just canât let it go.
