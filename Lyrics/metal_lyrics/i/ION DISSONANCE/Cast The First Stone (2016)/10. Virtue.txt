For now weâll proceed to push forward. Provoking the house with this familiar spell. Composing fresh crude ways to compel. Keeping it heartfelt for the clientele. For ages in the making. Thereâs just no god damned mistaking. The reign is up for the taking. Timelessly intended to lead. Unwilling to conform to the new breed. Absurd concepts of revolution within the confines of destitution. Nothing less than counter revolution. We patiently await our thorough retribution. If we were ever destined to accomplish distinction, something truly honorable with this life. Surely we canât let it fall to pieces. In due time contemplate how we made it here and now. This is the beginning of the end. For now weâre destined to keep on going. Rise up to the opposition and rebel. Dishing out fresh crude ways to compel. Dead set on a course to raise all hell. Dedicated to mass shaming. Thereâs just no god damned mistaking. The foundations were radically shaken. Your ideals rightfully forsaken. The foundations were radically shaken.
