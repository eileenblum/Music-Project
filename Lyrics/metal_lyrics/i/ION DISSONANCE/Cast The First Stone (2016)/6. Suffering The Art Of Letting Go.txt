This heavy anguish within my being intensifies with each passing day. And lack of sleep deprives my essence to a point where I donât give a fuck about my presence. Lately Iâve been feeling like thereâs no escape. Another futile attempt at effervescent joy has now rendered me bitter and apathetic. Locked up like a caged animal. Iâm now a shadow of the man I was, but is it really too late? Detaching to remain levelheaded. These heinous emotions are now embedded. Iâm finding it increasingly harder to function while standing on the brim of total destruction. Unattended in this empty room with these visions of the memories I consumed. Supplicating for an honest shred of peace of mind, and to finally âlet goâ of what you leave behind. You pushed me over the edge throughout the years. Thereâs just no running from your fears. I gave it all I got. Gave this a fair shot, but thereâs just no turning back from here. Unattended in this empty room, with the memories of visions I consume. You pushed me over the edge throughout the years. Thereâs just no running from your fears. I gave it all I got. Gave this a fair shot, but thereâs just no turning back from here. I donât know if I ever told you this, but my conscience died on that night with your tales of cowardice. I can see your shadow fading away when I close my eyes at night. I can feel your presence raiding in me. So the time is now to make this right. This is not what I had in mind when I said I needed to do this. To do this in my own way, but mark my words. Iâm not doing this cause I want to, Iâm doing this because it needs to be done. The line crossed, the toll paid.
