Certain things are better left in the past. Prophecies unfold unto victims of circumstance, but regret is a broken window that shouldnât be rehashed. The alarming certainty of life is the realization that it is merely a temporary respite between birth and death. Certain things are better left in the past. Emotions of despair overshadowed you so fast, but donât give up on hope, donât let fear deplete you. It all seems so unfair. I wish there was something I could do. A self-directed life will get you every time. Listen in. Listen up. I just canât save you now. The wheel of fate wonât let me spin this. This doesnât change a thing between you and me. Tonight weâre burying your remnants, farewell my friend. Certain things are just better left in the past. Departing quicker than the blink of an eye. Lamentable for being too late to say good-bye, and now the time has come to lift the dead hand of the past.
