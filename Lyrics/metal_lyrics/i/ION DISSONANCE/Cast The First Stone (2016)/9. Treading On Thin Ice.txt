Feeding the masses ideologies. Animosity neither here nor there. A very thin fine line exists amid free speech in voicing your opinions and spitting bullshit lies and injustice. In this day in age, in present time, itâs incomprehensible to fathom that division and segregation remain a prevalent affair to our way of life. How could this culture not learn from the faults of our departed forbearers? While governance openly turn a cold shoulder to their kin. How dare our democracies allow such shameful ties to persist on? Fall back and consider how edacity has constantly inhabited as a mystic shadow hiding behind the curtain. Draw back and deliberate how it invariably comes down to a question of affluence. Greed is inevitably the root of all evil. Doomed to fail. Fail to learn. The writing is on the wall. Forever doomed to repeat the cycle. Cursed to the grave. Repeat this cycle.
