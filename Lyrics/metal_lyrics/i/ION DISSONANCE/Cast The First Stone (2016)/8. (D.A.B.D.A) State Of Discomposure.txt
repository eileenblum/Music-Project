Damn you for thinking that Iâd let you slip away. You got another thing coming. In the thick of things youâre so naÃ¯ve. Iâm powerless to relate to any of the words conveyed tonight. Do you really think I could let you walk away? And do you really think you could play? Iâd let you play me for a fool? So stand clear. This hostilityâs reinforced. Aggression fuels the fury building up inside of me. Iâve come to feel this rage strengthening inside my soul. Iâve come to feel my life slipping through my fingertips. Iâve come to feel my pulse fading with each passing breath. As clear as day is the dismay displayed within my eyes. So stand clear. This resentmentâs amplified. Aggression fuels this fury building up inside of me. Only one aspect left I aim to grasp. In legitimate candor, what do you expect? Duplicityâs written all over your face. No pain no gain, but this canât be erased. I will never condone this. I will never acquit you. I will never absolve this. I will never forgive. Please donât give up on me tonight. Just know that sooner or later youâre bound to miss us. Tell me how to fix this, to make you stay. This lust is mine and you canât leave me, just leave me the fuck alone. Unabridged blackness masks sentience of right and wrong. I havenât slept a single night in more than a month. The remnants of you and I afflict this reality. I can never leave the past behind. Every man has his secret shadows concealed from the malicious eyes of the world, and this just doesnât matter like it did before. This Just doesnât matter anymore. To let go doesnât mean I donât care anymore, but now I can move on. Look past all this grief. Coming to terms with this. I donât care anymore, but now I can press on, to emerge anew again. Come to accept my reality.
