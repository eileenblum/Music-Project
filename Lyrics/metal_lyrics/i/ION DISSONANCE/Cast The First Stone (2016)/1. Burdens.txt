Get out of my head! We both know itâs not how our sagaâs intended to play out, but itâs too late to reiterate now. I need you to know this. I donât heed to pull apart. I left these ghosts in the past, and I donât fear death, but Iâm scared of what comes next. Every dawn gives way to dusk. Itâs just not fair, fair to know that we can move on, on with our lives, but Iâm over it, Iâm over you, and itâs not fair to presume I succumbed to the weight of these burdens. Molding and shaping me into the man Iâve become today. With loose ends tied nothing seems to satisfy. Fire everything youâve got. This is merely food for thought, and itâs just not fair, fair to know that we can move on, on with our lives. Iâm over you, not over this, and I donât care to quarrel anymore with the voices in my head.
