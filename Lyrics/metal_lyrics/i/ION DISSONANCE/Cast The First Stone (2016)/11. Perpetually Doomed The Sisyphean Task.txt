For narrow minded fools. Thick headed to the bone. One would infer that the concept of constructive criticism would be a notion simple enough to comprehend. Donât hold your breath. Iâm sick and tired of faking this. Comparatively to being insightful with leadership and integrity, you leave me menaced, riddled with pessimism. Rather than to give the benefit of the doubt, Iâm only left with the doubt leaving no esteem for these accomplishments. To this day I still canât see the forest for the trees. Completely blinded by your lack of empathy. With hostile negativity brewing inside your ego, nothingâs left to say. Nothing is worth the embarrassment of your ways. Nothing is capable to repair this mess. You know it helps to write it down. This ship has finally sailed. Life is nothing but a test. Letâs set the record straight. The storm is coming in. Itâs time to set the record straight.
