Every now and then life forces you to choose sides, straying from the course of your everyday passage. Our intuition blindly leading us into uncharted grounds, a blackened shrine captivating fearless intellects. Nothing can affect our alliance here. Forcing a deaf ear to all their critiques. Rekindling embers of a departed past seems so much easier said than done. These bodies are far from being indestructible. Contradicting what we were brought up to believe. While your lives hang in the balance, we stand indecisive as to which way to venture. We're born infidel to our upbringings and our every fraternal instinct. Sit back and watch these lives collapse, knowing that compassion can be carried out. To change individuals for the better with a simple wish to make these wrongs, right.
