Fuck you... so after everything that's happened here between us, just what the fuck did you expect? I put up with all your bullshit and games, not to mention disrespect. Now after everything that's gone down here between us, can you finally come forth and admit your faults? Fuck! Who the hell am I kidding? I know that you haven't changed at all. Over consumed with popularity and looks, unable to free myself from these ridiculous hooks. It was never in my nature to act out in rage, unleashing a bitter being of uncanny viciousness. It's time to take out the trash. Bitch, I'm taking you out tonight. When I'm through with you, no one will ever want anything to do with you again. Go fuck yourself you're an ignorant hood rat.
