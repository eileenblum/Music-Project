I seek through these charred remmants for a vunerable person I once knew. We outgrew all our shattered dreams. Our hopes for the future were as bold as any. Now look at where we ended up. The day my fist comes into contact with your fucking face, I hope you'll realize your life's a disgrace. You white trash bitch. Keep running your mouth like you're some kind of know it all. You know you're gonna fall. Your life ain't shit.
