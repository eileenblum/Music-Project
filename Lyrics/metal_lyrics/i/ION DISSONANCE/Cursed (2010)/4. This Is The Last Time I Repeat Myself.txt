I'm never going to live this one down. The weight of these burdens held upon our fail backs, just what where you thinking? A feebleminded idea you got caught up in. Stained with a poignant shade of shame, tears fill the void in your bland eyes. You find yourself trembling over words you cannot bear to speak. What the fuck is the matter with you? After all the shit that you put us through, is this really what we've come to? When broken down, this feels just like dÃ©jÃ  vue. You know that it's inevitable, that all things good must eventually come to an end. A bond kept strong for 12 years long, now here we stand writing up this song. Believe me you will know this deception. This anguish felt from the treacherous betrayal you've drawn upon us through the years. Through it all, I can't help but feel fatuous. Reminiscing over everything, this seems all too predictable. Were we ever worth our former selves, tonight still plenty young and we're yet to become. The very thought of confronting you with these allegations, recollections of past life obsess my every sentiment. We won't go down without a fight. What the fuck is the matter with you? After all the shit that you put us through, is this really what we've come to? When broken down, this feels like just dÃ©jÃ  vue.
