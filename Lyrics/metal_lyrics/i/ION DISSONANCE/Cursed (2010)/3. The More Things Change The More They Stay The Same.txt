If you are a blameless victim, I guess that makes me the culprit in this absurd affair. Never would have I imagined it to be quite like this. Recap and play it back. No matter how you look at this, the numbers they never lie. Unable to wrap my head around this, the only question left is why? To salvage what's left of these fading memories. Furious bursts of rage overwhlem the best of us. A scapegoat for all your fucking flaws. The breaking point becomes inevitable. My soul is protected by fire, reinforced with optimism. Conforming to what was begged of us. Through thick and thin, we stood our ground. We fought tough and held our own, we stood our ground. If you are the innocent victim, I guess that makes me the culprit in this affair. To salvage what's left of these fading memories. Furious bursts of rage overwhelm the best of us. A scapegoat for all your fucking flaws.
