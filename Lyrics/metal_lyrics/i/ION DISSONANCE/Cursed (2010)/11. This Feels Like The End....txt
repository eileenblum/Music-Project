I'd like to trust that you're not a piece of shit as you fooled us all into believing. Some how, deep down I know we're all mistaken, you remain a moronic passing phase. It's ironic to see yourself as the villain and mutual trust was never considered as a given right. The day my fist comes into contact with your face, I hope you'll realize that your life's a disgrace, you punk ass chump. Keep running your mouth like you're some kind of know it all, you know what they say? The taller they are the harder they fall. There's nothing left to say about this fib of treachery and so we fall back down just to pick ourselves back up again. This is my town, this is my hood, don't get shit misunderstood, you wouldn't get it even if you could. Still spotting you at all the places we used to meet, keep sporting that obnoxious smile on your face. Your mother. Your poor mother raised a pathetic asshole. She's best to kiss you goodnight one last time before I never give her the chance again. Don't get it twisted, my goal's not to take you out. It's to disgrace your name in shame and all which you stand for. I don't know why you think you're slick, I don't know why you think you're quick, I know you can't compete with this dick, all I know is you're gonna wish you'd quit. The day my fist comes into contact with your face, I hope you reallize that your life's a disgrace, you punk ass chump. I don't know why you think you're sick, I don't know why you brought your clique, I know you can't compete with this dick, all I know is you're gonna wish you'd quit. Your life ain't shit. You don't got what it takes to roll with us. Pull over and hand me my nine, I know I got you as soon as I spot you.
