Can someone please explain this to me? All signs indicate the worst still to come. Who will be there to break our fall? Better yet, who'll stick around to tear down this wall? Ostracized from our domestic habitation. Heavily blinded from characterization. All the while helping to strengthen and solidify our local foundations, establishing our safe haven. I wouldn't change a single thing about it. A common goal for us all to strive for. So why's it all swerving out of control? Out of focus. It's slowly fading away in the distance. Every attempt made at survival has failed. Panic stricken the fear eats you alive. Stranded in solitude, with only the blackness of night guiding these damned souls. Remain with the idea of redemption through renewal. To be reborn into this youthful wake of rejunvenation. To attack the whole with new tactics and groove. Our motivation secured for years to come.
