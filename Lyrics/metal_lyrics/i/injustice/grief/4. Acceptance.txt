[feat. Richard &amp; Malik of Amor][Richard]
I'm not okay
I've never been fucking okay
Every single day
I fake this Goddamn smile
Just so they can get their way

It makes me sick to live through this misery
How much longer can I bare with this agony?
The anticipation to take a gun, put it to my head
&amp; pull the trigger

[Malik]
Pull the trigger
&amp; see how much red will spread
Until I drop dead
I'm sick in the fucking head
I long to lie in my wooden bed
Cross my arms
Kill my sight
Reaper, save me
Hold me tight

Broken since birthed
No one can comprehend
What it's like to truly be cursed
It can only be heard so far within this closed coffin

I know I'm not like the rest
I'm just a piece of shit at best
I'm sorry I'm not okay
I wish I could be for both you &amp; me

I'm trying to save you from all that's bad
When I am the reason what's wrong in this world

I always turn my back to the clock
Because I never want to know when my time is up
[2x]
