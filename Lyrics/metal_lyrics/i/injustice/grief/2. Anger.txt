I'm always portrayed as an enemy
You're depicted as the victim
Having no purpose in life
False tears will only get you so far

Pathetically seeking sympathy
Any chance you have the opportunity
Do the world a favor, commit self immolation

But when you get to the top, where will you go?
No one cares for you, back turned to the world
These feeble attempts to bring yourself up, are getting nowhere
Another foot in the grave

In your grave
Watch as your life fades away
In the end
Who will stand by your side?

I can't comprehend the fact that you believe, the world will take you by the hand
Implored to get your way through life, will only get you so far

Bringing others down to attempt to carry your way through life
Will only get you so far before you're kicked to the curb

It's only a matter of time
Before your world comes crashing down
You mean nothing to me
You mean nothing to us all
