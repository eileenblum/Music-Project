No one will attend the funeral of a failure
It's no surprise to be let down over &amp; over
Prepared to drown in my sorrow
My chances to live will never see tomorrow

This baggage is too much to bear on my own
I always knew I would die alone
So this is how it feels to be overthrown
The feeling of never finding a home

My entire life I've been living a lie
As the seconds tick, I've been waiting to die
Unwilling to even put up a fight
I'm ready to comply, this is my last goodbye

Doctors say in the head I'm not feeling well
My entire life has been nothing but a living Hell
No one will ever know how far down I've fell
Not even my own fucking self

Watch as my soul parts way
For I fear I won't live another day
Tear out the sutures from my heart
I don't deserve a restart

It's hard to keep a straight head
When your life's going down in a spiral
As every grain of sand falls down into this dial

My mind seems to wander when I'm wasting time
Guess the best way it's put, I'm not doing fine
I understand you are whom you define
But I always feel my life's on the fucking line
It never ends, existence is a crime
Humanity is meaningless, we're all fucking swine
Thoughts race, steady hand, pull the trigger, &amp; watch my life decline

Bury my body, deep within the sea
Death will only set me free
As the waves enclose down on me
Drown within the triangle, is where I'm made to be
25Â°N 71Â°W
I dare someone to find me
