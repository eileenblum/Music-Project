Father's hand on son,
telling life can't always be that easy.
The things that I must do
jeopardise my life with you

Once the screens have fed the masses,
spread the secret that limits their lives...

Lights ahead, I failed the mission of my life.
my skin dissolves, my soul will last forever.
Lights all around, I feel serenity.
But something's hunting me from inside.
The torrent is on I will play their game.

I am your angel here to guide you.
come with me, you're not alone!

Life flash before my eyes
until my last endeavour
failed me.
I've come to realize
I have to rectify.

Searching for redemption still
until my final victory.
I'll haunt them in their sweetest dreams.
Screams echo in silence.
Lights all around, I feel serenity.
But something's hunting me from inside.
Hunters and hunted I'm one of them.

And so I search the night
to find their evil faces.
Ending me in the best part of my life
will haunt you endlessly

You turned your face from love to evil.
Time to see your family

I see the teardrops falling gently down their faces.
Our story ended all too soon, oh no
And it's all because of lies.

Mother's hand on son, telling life can't always be that easy.
I too wish this undone,
but we have to get through.

See the world from after life, I'm flying.
Mystical life!
I have a vision that pierces all lies.
I see the puzzle to our life.
World in my eyes!

Emotional impact, departure of love.
How I crave for revival,
to hold my loved ones
and keep them away from the wolves.

I keep calling your name in despair
hoping answers will appear.
Tell me, how did we get lost inside this maze?

Five to three,
both the rifles in their position.
I go down.
Two to three,
I have reached my final decision:
I will make the call.
when I pick up the lobby phone
my wife appears
She approaches a smiling face

As I gaze upon my love
all the light has made me blind.
My angel cries and fights for my life,
memories unfold.

I was traveling through great dimensions
while people were gathering around me.
The attention was won,
but all I had worked for was gone.

See the world from after life, I'm flying.
Mystical life!
I have a vision that pierces all lies.
I see the puzzle to our life.
World in my eyes!

Look out the window,
look at the stars.
Will you ever find an answer there?
Look at my picture,
look in my eyes.
Will you wish upon a star to make me strong?

I search Lou Cypher
offering souls of evil
for redemption.
When I'm back
I need my life.

Now with demonic force
I have the face of evil.
Agony, with the last breaths of their lives
has been their destinies.

Come back to us.
We need you so.

Sometimes it seems
that the unreal
has happened anyway.
And when I'm walking through their door
looking at their faces
fades my pain away.
