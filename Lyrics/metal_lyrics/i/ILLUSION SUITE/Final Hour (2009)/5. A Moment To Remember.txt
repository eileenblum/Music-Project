Sometimes I feel like I'm falling
away from all that keeps me to the ground.
The sun is going down.
Our love has withered.

Another time, another place,
right back to the start;
I had a perfect night with you.

All our love, I miss the times we had.
Rainy days I live my life without you,
within these walls where love grew up.
And this you told me
when your mind had started to run:
Life is cruel.
What is love without all our memories?

Walking alone out at night gives me time to dehumanize.
I got too many feelings for a valentine,
saving my pain for a future's ordeal.
There's noting in between small change and insanity.
Light as a feather or indulging dejection,
it's hard to be on either side.

Once so vigorous a light,
illuminating all,
shined through an open door
and made me love her blind.

Then one day when she looked in my eyes
she'd forgotten my name.
Gone were all the days that we lived through.

It's you, it's you. You are my only love.
How could I forget...forget to recollect.

So I tried to be a hero.
I tried to make you understand
in your memory; I'm your heart in life.

House of cards in heart,
oh, the pain, the torment I feel,
how it's hard to make it through.

Like an arbitrary prey she's sacrificed to decay
where the present and past slowly fades away;
an ultimate path to her demise.

Living in a moment to remember, oh
You know the time we have is here and now.
Life is us on an island.

Now and then when she looks in my eyes
she forgets my name.
Gone are all the days that we lived through.

Living in a moment to remember, oh.
You know the time we have is here and now.
Only us!

The doctor's opinion is words filled with poison.
It seems that I now for the rest of my life
will need a cynical point of view to withhold all my love.
Now until you're gone, I'll keep you here.

I bring you again to the start of our days,
I will make us believe.
I'll make you retrieve
memories buried deep inside your mind.

Now here, we're back again
where love encountered long ago.
The present meets the past again,
we're trying to connect.

On this day when she looks in my eyes,
she does not see my face.
I'm gone with all the days that we lived through.

It's you; it's you my only love.
Now I'm here with you.
Today my head is clear.

So, we both knew on that evening
the chance was here to reconcile,
the changes that would cripple her inside.

House of cards in heart,
oh, the pain, the torment I feel,
how it's hard to make it through.

Once so vigorous a light,
illuminating all,
shined through an open door
and made me love her blind.

Living in a moment to remember, oh.
This is our time, these are our lives.
Living in a moment where I'm keeping all your dreams.
The time we have is here and now.
I'm saving my tears, I cry another day.
