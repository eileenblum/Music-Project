As I gaze at the midnight skies
a shimmering light appears.
For I know that you see the same
from fourth dimensions mirror.
Pathway to a star, watching the moon,
tempest of memories.
What I feel is real, time will reveal
words unspoken in my mind.

My life is my ordeal,
with all these interceptions.
Unleash the future with liquid dreams.

As I gaze at eternal lines,
the lines that lead to heaven,
then I know they will guide my way
through fourth dimensions mirror.

Where to?
The stairway is endless, a journey starts.
Where to?
A new sphere is waiting, another task.
Where do you go?
Then into the vast space, awakening comes.
Where do you go?
I'm leaving my life now, flesh and blood.

I'm fading in existence.
I drift in a moment between carnations.
So close, my loved one, but yet so far.
Now this is the line, I can't cross time.

Where to?
The stairway is endless, a journey start.
Where to?
A new sphere is waiting, another task.
Where do you go?
Then into the vast space, awakening comes.
Where do you go?
I'm leaving my life now, flesh and blood.

I see reflections in your eyes, scarlet skies.
There's something that I will do when I'm here.
I see reflections in your eyes, scarlet skies.
There's something that will come true when I'm here.
