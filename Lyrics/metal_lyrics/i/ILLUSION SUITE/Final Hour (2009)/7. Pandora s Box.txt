Evil clowns in the hall.
Crucified adults are hung on the ceiling around,
and a sorceress fights
genies descended from heaven.
Magical, mystical
fountains with human blood.
She looks in the mirror; what does she see?
Her mother making tea for noon

She unleashed an evil force.
It may seem the world will fall in days.
Evil's free.
Unleashing the power that hides in Pandora
is the first step of seven that leads you to hell.

Little girl held the box.
All her fantasies would soon
be transcended to life.
What could be there inside?
She was obsessed by her treasure.
Magical, mystical.
What did she see inside?
Her blue little eyes were longing to see
strange voices calling from long ago.

She unleashed an evil force.
It may seem the world will fall in days.
Evil's free.
Unleashing the power that hides in Pandora
is the first step of seven that leads you to hell.

Julie, what you do can affect us all.

When the box is open wide
nothing will be the same again.
Reach out for love
fight for life.

Hiding there alone inside:
a girl without a memory.
Dark is all around,
but people dream of sunset horizons.
The world has fallen.
The seven headed beast is collecting the souls.

She unleashed an evil force.
It may seem the world won't be the same.
Evil reign.
Unleashing the power that hides in Pandora
is the first step of seven that leads you to hell.

Julie, what you do can affect us all.

Hiding from the world outside:
a girl without a memory.
Dark is all around,
but people dream of sunset horizons.
This is the final turning around.
The world has fallen.
The seven headed beast is collecting the souls.
