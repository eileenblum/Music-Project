I wield the story of these wasted lands.
Memories buried in the past, fantasies and dreams
guide you through adventures beyond your mind, oh, oh.
Flowers grew before the tragic fire.

I see the scarlet skies crashing down before my eyes.
Is this the end is this the final call?
The earth is cracking through the lands.
Heavens are falling down.
Erratic skylines drawing near.

I had a dream with smoke and fire, tragic scenes,
a lucid nightmare, the ending was surreal.
I see the dark embrace the light.
Insidious, the skies.

And so the end arrives.
Universe collapse in time.
Is this the end, the final call?
See lightning flashes through the night
loosing perspective of time.
Transcended souls lost in despair.

I had a dream with smoke and fire, tragic scenes,
a lucid nightmare, the ending was surreal.
I see the dark embrace the light.
Insidious, the skies.

In those times of complications I cried.
Trapped in time with this broken mirror;
the world's a broken figure.
Once we were here.

I wield the story of these wasted lands.
Memories buried in the past, fantasies and dreams
guide you through adventures beyond your mind.
Flowers grew before the tragic fire.

I see the past that never comes to be.
History ends in misery,
memories and dreams.
