A perfect lie: a game that never changes.
Vicious circle of life:
deceived by hollow lies.
Lost and found, you reach again.
You will never make it on your own.

Turn the wheel of time.
Your moment of truth could last forever.

The devil in your heart is leaving now.
You swallow pride to realise that
treasures come from heart and not from gold.

Dreaming of a world of your own
in a circle of pride,
pretending you don't care.
Be a lie, mime a fool!
You masquerade a life that once was true.

Turn the wheel of time.
Your moment of truth could last forever.

The devil in your heart is leaving now.
You swallow pride to realise
hands of time.

In the end, then you're rising
from the blinding shadow,
freed from life that you once lived alone.
Seasons come and seasons go.
I too was lost, and so:
it took my life away from me.

You rise to be a better man.
Your inner war is through.
Let the light of day wake up you,
spend your worries!

Step behind and look into
the mirror in a world where you're a fool

Turn the wheel of time.
Your moment of truth could last forever.

The devil in your heart is leaving now.
You swallow pride to realise.

Heartless intensions.
Hearts break in two.

These are the words of a woman I knew.
Felt my heartless intensions grow cruel.
End of the line,
the shortest straw.
Never again shall I lie.
I gave my sacred vow.
In the trying to break out
it always seems
that you will stay behind there for ever.
Never again did I lie.
