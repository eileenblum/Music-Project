Now the time has come to show me:
All my hope did fade away.
I will sail my ship to new lands
where new horizons will appear.

Another day, another story.
Make your own miracles.
Carry me, ride with the phoenix, arise.
She carries me under wings of fortune.
Carry on away.

A different moon is slowly rising.
My old ship has found the way.
Now in hope and search for new lands
a new horizon has appeared.

Another day, another story.
Make your own miracles.
Carry me, ride with the phoenix, arise.
She carries me under wings of fortune.
Carry on.

Pitch black anger.
Welcome madness.
Madness blocked my senses.

Into a new world.
In the mist I see a light.
Is it home that I've been searching for?
A silhouette, I think this is my father.
Fire in our eyes!
And all the things I wandered through
in life from birth to now oh, oh
it all comes down to stay in the moment
and burn it to my mind.

So the wind did change for me.
It carried me up to the shore line.
Now it's time for me to see:
the passage is merely a door.
