Electric tension will foster an iron scourge
Inside the tower of Wardenclyffe
The weather's running wild
Craving force, power fusion, radiant diffraction
A whole production managed by one man
The tower of Tesla will stand

All the world rejoices
Now as science brings the world to light
But the electromagnetic field of the Earth
Brings all to a wild collision

This December something's on the rise
There's a sign in a dark horizon
Cosmic fusion, sky divine

Ash from above
Makes an illusion
Liquified metal rain down
Draping the sky in shades this night

There was a place called Iron Cemetery
And science made it so
Forceful and decisive was the ironizing
And when metallic smoke had cleared up
The human race resembled robotic remains
They met their end in silence

Watching his act
Turning to chaos
Trying to finalize a cure
Watching his loved ones turn

So the years pass in silence without intrusion
Then suddenly a fragile flower blooms
Diffusing its life-giving fumes

Ash from the sky
Made its intrusion
Forging its liquified crown
Down on the living of this world
