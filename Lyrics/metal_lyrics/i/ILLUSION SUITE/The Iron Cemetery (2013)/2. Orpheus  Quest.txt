Â§ Orpheus

I play poetry. I want this God deceived.

And when the sun goes down
I will climb into the underworld

How did I lose my way in life?
Can I start it over again?
I want to blind this God with music
To bring my loved one home

I played along with the boatman's hunger
For the coins in my hand
He brought me into the darkest of realms
For my love I will cross past this dimension door

Â§ Hades

I will raise the foes of my kingdom
There's no fight
I am crushing all my enemies
Now, there is no heart
There's no sympathy
There eyes are as cold as the night

Â§ Orpheus

How did I lose my way in life?
Can I start it over again?
I want to blind this God with music
To bring my loved one home

You took her...
I want her back tonight!
Under these circumstances I'll fight
Let us settle this nice
Today you picked a flower of innocence

Â§ Hades

You tremble at my throne in awe
My darkness prevails

Â§ Orpheus

It is my poetry emotions that
I share with you tonight

I praise thee
I intend to commence in the writing of a hymn
They'll be chanting your name in the living's realm
Writing about thee in poetry

Â§ Hades

I can see across my whole kingdom
I said: "Go, but you don't look at Eurydice!"
Now go back and meet your destiny
Torment awaits her in the abysses of Hell

Â§ Orpheus

But in the end he released my love
On the terms we agreed:
"Walk not to turn, do not look in her eyes"

In the end I could not help but to turn around

Â§ End game

Five birds are flying above
one bird's perception the others are ignoring

So, two birds part their flock this day
All will never play together
There is another kind of ball game
From this day on, and from now...
