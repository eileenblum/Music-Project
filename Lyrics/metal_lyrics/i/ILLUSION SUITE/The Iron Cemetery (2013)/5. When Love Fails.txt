He's staring out the window
As his mother leaves
He opens a door in his own mind
To search for the company he'd love to find
This is the first time that he's left behind
In Christmas time
He tries to make food on the floor
he lights up the firework his mom brought home

Love fails then something breaks down
And out of despair when deceived
He is strengthening his fantasy faculties

Beating in her daily care
With a fist that hurts or self-sustaining mind games
The cracks in the wall are beginning to show now
Drunk in his bedroom she laughs 'til he wakes
Then she scares him with faces she makes
In a soft stream he travels now
The garden and his fairy let him in

Into the great unknown...

I travel down
Beneath the stones and rocks I go
It's a lonely, lonely road

I had a talk with my angels and demons
On my world of true affliction

I rolled the dice, what to do, and believe in?
Which way is the best to walk?

He narrows his consciousness
To a state of mind that astral-travels far
Now is he asleep or awake?
Alone with his sister he's five years of age
He doesn't think he can do this alone
On a soft bed he lays her down
The window of Anubis lets her in

He travelled the stars and then back again
His mother is waiting this time
On the floor lies his one-year-old sister
She's lifeless...
