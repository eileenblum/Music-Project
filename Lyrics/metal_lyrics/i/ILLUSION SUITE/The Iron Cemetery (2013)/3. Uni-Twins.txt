With no intention
I face a door that hides a chain of reactions.
Trans-universal eyes unite.
Let's mess around with the God of creation.

Can I find a way to reach your soul?
The clockwork spins; divides the uni-twins.
Then how can we unify?
We are the twins through time.

Feel my soul through the fibers of space.
Cosmic events are the soul of the world,
And gathered in the consciousness of life.

Am I? Do I exist without a memory of my body?
How do I know if I ever lived? What's real?

With no intention
I face a door that hides a chain of reactions.
Cross-universal eyes unite.
Let's mess around with the God of creation.

Can I find a way to reach your soul?
The clockwork spins; divides the uni-twins.
Now in a sense I am your equation;
The fool that sought your reflection.

Feel my soul through the fibers of space.
Cosmic events are the soul of the world,
And gathered in the consciousness of life.

Feel my soul through the fibers of space.
Cosmic events are the soul of the world,
And gathered in the consciousness of life.

Sense my soul; unite us as one!
So I can figure out how to break out.
I have been able to cross time;
Merge your universe with mine.
Fare well!
