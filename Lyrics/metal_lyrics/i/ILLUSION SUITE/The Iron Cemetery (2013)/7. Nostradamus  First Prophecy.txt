One artifact has been damaged in Chambery
Through fire it held
A riddle's found at the 1890's end
Much is lost
As records begin
I take the time to advertise my vision
God's earthly bound

Technology will set us free
Through my mind's
Prophecy the visions shows history
Plot is acted out, all the world our stage
The space-time decipher

I sense a man
And his fortune is our history
A wrap from a white shroud
Hides the truth to the year 2004
Mystery solved
By science's advance
it was a man's acceptance with misfortune
A cross to bear

Technology will set us free
Through my mind's prophecy, the visions shows history
Plot is acted out, all the world our stage
Space-time decipher

As I rest on cavern ground
All the world is praying
My spirit will be free
My sacrifice binds man
