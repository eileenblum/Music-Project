Where is this fiend you are denying 
What is this tool you've been in distant lands 
With frigid eyes some one can see you 
Your inner self, that you could never stand. 

For now you are what you have longed be
forgotten light - forgotten in your fear 
Threw out your night, behind its safety care
this shield conceals your fragile sleep 

Come watch your blood that turned to ice. 
This poison in you mind, your substitute for life 
Those broken peaces of your mind 
Those crumbled tiny grains, now parted from your mind.
