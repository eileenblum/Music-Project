[written by Grom]

Crawling slowly through the night 
Need to speak, whisper the last word 
Search for light, Searching for a far gone light 

Stay forever in a dream 
Vision that so close and grim 
Look into those eyes so strange At the light that shine so dim... 

Starring by closed eyes at me 
Take a look take a look inside 
You shall see the other side 

You shall see the forlorn past 
Seared blood of grim despair 
Ugly face of torture mask
