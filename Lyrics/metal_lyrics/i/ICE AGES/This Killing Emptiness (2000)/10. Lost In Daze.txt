Make this word for me, that never mine has been.
That's all I want from you, or see me fall and you will follow. 
Lost in our daze, just hear our voice inside 
This tender sound it feels - like thunder in our mind so hollow. 

Seized with fear at night till endless hours die. 
Our passion of the night, to dreadful dreams it turned for ever. 
We see it through a mist, this precipice we feel 
Where none dared to be, before the time we lived in sorrow 

These seeds of hope we once knew 
will fall on ground, on the ground no more 
Our tumbling souls they won't reach 
this fertile soil of your life. 

Inertia's falling down 
From dusky past, from the time that's lost 
Resistance falls apart 
brings this glory times no more
