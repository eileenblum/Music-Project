Make a lie and then you'll see that we will save you. 
And if you please we'll screen your lucid sight. 
Your anxious dreams reflects the bygone live you forsook 
So if you please we'll keep your silent sleep 

Gasp for breath, this kiss of life we'll give will save you. 
we'll be here while you faint 
Your dwindling hope will recurrent each time you see us. 
Your sober mind will turn to life again 

Frozen souls like mine, are here to stay 
Abandoned hopes and fears will shape our lives for now 
Shades of former light black out our sight 
to darken all despair, that I lightened up the way to here
