Here my heart; my heartbeat is your time 
Feel this trembling sound, take care don't let it plunge you into misery 

Dreadful dreams will be your home divine 
In your narrow mind, a torturous path will lead you to your enemy 

Mindless lives will greet you from afar 
Walls that bind their minds will be for you the boarder to your emptiness 

Breath this life like it will breath in you. 
Come out of your shell, believe in me- your eyes will see just endlessness. 

Take this forces if you like 
Leave your memories here, in my forgotten soul 
Drag your burdens to the dark 
Let them be beside mine- in obscurity
