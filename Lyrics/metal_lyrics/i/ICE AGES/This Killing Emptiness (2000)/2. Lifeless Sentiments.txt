Void in my mind, in my thoughts, 
that never knew this life 
just feel your force that contradicts my life

Live threw the night then you'll feel, 
this terror force I found 
This terror force I found in distant times. 

This Gate to the scope of my mind 
is locked by live unknown 
My mind is caught, please trespass if you dare. 

Live threw the night then you'll feel, 
this terror force I found 
This terror force I found in distant times. 

Come, you saved my hollow dream; 
and all this hiding places there, 
where you and me have been before 
where I don't seen what you have suffered 

All this lifeless sentiments 
are here to stroke my skin no more 
just watch me from my unknown side 
and be here when this heart gets blind.
