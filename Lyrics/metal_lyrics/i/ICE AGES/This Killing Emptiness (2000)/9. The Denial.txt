[written by Grom]

My eyes refuse to see 
This pale sky filled with sorrow 
The empty space we gain in melancholic dreams 

My heart refused to count 
The time I have till ending 
To be a friend of dying leaves 

My fate belongs the dark 
This pain will leave no gashes 
Closed eyes won't ever see this pain 

My lungs refuse to breath 
and prefer suffocation 
To never see this thing called life
