[written by Grom]

Come back you silent hour 
so we could die again 
by night that washed away the pain 
that comes here to remain 

By blood red dawn we'll leave 
this killing emptiness 
And ever to bring death and grief to me
to wander with our grief 

A scent of blood, remember now! 
A sence we had to kill 
To never meet on the black hill 
Just stay away and thrill 

A void in blackness will remain 
To keep a secret dream 
Don't bother the enchanted flame 
Just drawn in pain; again 

I long to burn I long to mourn 
Forever we'll remain 
To die again, with sweetest pain 
To stay away by grey

... by grey long shadows on a grave 
To watch the mortal dy 
To be eternal silent slaves Of death 
- to meet again... To die in vain...
