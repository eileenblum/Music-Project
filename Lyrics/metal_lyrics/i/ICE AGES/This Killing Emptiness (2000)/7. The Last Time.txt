Take if you meet one heart to feel, one soul to die
and let this dark soul prevent this heart from pain
Bleak bygone walls They cast a shadow over you
And if you'll be there Your heart will be confined

Dawn on your mind this deadly pallor in you face
will fall a prey to this terrifying life
Time to forsake this gasping maze for evermore
but all this wide doors have seemed to fade away

This creature that you are will seek refuge in caves you made
in long forgotten times
This misery you see will forecast all the times you feared
the last time that you feel
