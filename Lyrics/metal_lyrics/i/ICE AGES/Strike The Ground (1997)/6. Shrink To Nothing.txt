Like a spider in the darkness
Emptiness is feeding my pain
I'm not really human
Not quite of flesh and bone

There is chaos in my being
A lonely soul so dark
Slowly I am fading
And none wants to care

I hear the secret calling
Everyone else is so deaf
The world moves on
Depressions, I am by myself

Light shines bright above me
I reach but fail to grasp it
Lonely I am fading
No one to hold my hand
