Look at me my fearful friend
I worthy I seem to you
Well then look closer into my eyes
I am sicker than you think

I mock you while you cry
I am the dark side beneath your head
The spider in your head

I am the rodent in your guts
The knife in yourself that cuts

I stand before you
A mirage of your fear
A dream so real - like darkness

[by Ray Wells]
