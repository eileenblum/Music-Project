Sadness lives by my side
Laughter distorts my face
I am the crystal master
That lives inside my head

A maze of endless torments
The doors to nowhere lead
Forever lost, trapped and scared

Tears now drawn my eyes
Here in this lonely part of the world
Where nothing left to lose
And I am floating endlessly.

Forever to be found
Surely I am certain
Dead I'll be and without life
Never to tell this story.
