No more home that waits with wide opened doors
No more child that faces the morning dawn

[Refrain]
Slaughtered in vain...
Abandoned cold world and doomed,sacrificed

So proud in shame
So twisted in mind and paying it's price with fear

[Strophe]
No one will stare at the blood-raining sky
Never more, No hope ever to be found

[Refrain]
Tormented in grace
and sacred delight where agony cries

The Reckoning day
Subverted and bent so Fractured and deadly days.

[by Grigorii Petrenko]
