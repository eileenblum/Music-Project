Frozen light, I feel so cold, having frozen mind
I know I have to decide

Frozen space; my empty veins, my unspoken prayers.
The grateful sin: suicide.

Frozen home, the last revenge for all those who died
All of those I now deny

Frozen soul, now I am ruling this world up high
This ugly grin is now my smile

[Refrain 1]
Above the world; now it is mine
and under my world you are wasting your time

Now follow me, I am divine
Your mirror is broken, this is my last crime

[Strophe]
Cross the line, and try to make it all cold and bright
I want for you to decide.

Stop the tide, of hopes and thoughts, of eternal "why?"
Know how to dare and defy

[Refrain 2]
Above the world; now it is mine
and under my world you are wasting your time

Just step aside, you will face time
My wrecked and disgusting visions of life

Don't follow me, I am divine!
Just worship your mirror and worship your crime!
