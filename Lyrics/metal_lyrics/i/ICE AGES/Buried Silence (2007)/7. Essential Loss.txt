Unseen is what you are
Though unveil before the juices of scorn
Consume your sad remains
No purpose has promised you salvation

[Refrain]
A big restless struggle evolves
A desperate game
No way to resist

And as I am watching you die
My limbs are tied up
My spirit revolts

[Strophe]
Reckless the gratefulness
Itï¿½s grinding on every pure decision
Reason obliterate
The towers of further inclinations

[Refrain]
A big restless struggle evolves
A desperate game
No way to resist

And as I am watching you die
My limbs are tied up
My spirit revolts

A big restless struggle evolves
eradicate now
Oh failure so sweet

And as I am watching you die
The universe glows
The essential loss

[by Lorenz Graf]
