Damn you, die with me now, you say this to me once more
never to be, we find nothing else

So damn you, broken you lie; broken your creed,
I hate you. I'll never believe these dreams where you're shining.

[Refrain]
See, I seek, I seek for where you've gone
The water where you drown, the grave that you belong to

Deep, so calm my peace under the ground
I'm sure I wouldn't stay in your world much longer.

[Strophe]
Damn you, shut empty eyes, you won't face truth here,
not me! How could you try, to feel my regret, but...

Never, no more disguises nothing to hide,
I drag it, down to the ground.
I won't come back to light

[Refrain]
See, I seek, I seek for where you've gone
The water where you drown, the grave that you belong to

Deep, so calm my peace under the ground
I'm sure I wouldn't stay in your world much longer.

[Refrain 2]
See, I'm free, so come to me, up here
Now we are both so near to what we did appeal for

Deep, within I still will not believe
No secret of your truth you never can reveal, no.
