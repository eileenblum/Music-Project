One day it could all turn grey; from white to black it stops to change.
And only grey will here remain to stay; forever day by day

Grey is the reason for despair, grey days are getting old and bare
So old and never ever to come back; forever turns to black

[Refrain]
Grey take my soul! I fade,
Falling to the depths of time
This nothingness inside me, deep inside

No reason here to bow
for the world of all the blind
Killing the light of life ... of senseless life.

[Strophe]
Come look around, say what you see; again this endless futile joy,
and hear this whispering silent's deadly voice; that speaks inside of me.

Your wounds are open and you bleed, the blood is mixed with all the sand
And time is running slowly to its end; a time for you to live

[Refrain]
Grey take my soul! I fade,
Falling to the depths of time
This nothingness inside me, deep inside

No reason here to bow
for the world of all the blind
Killing the light of life ... of senseless life.
