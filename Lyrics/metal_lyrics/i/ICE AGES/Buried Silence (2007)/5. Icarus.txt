I cannot take the world's new turn
I cannot make the sun stop burning

I cannot stop the sun, it burns
Flaming my eyes, I can't return

I cannot loose the time,I'm learning
Learning to leave this place alone

I cannot fake the inner yearning
I cannot find my faith, it's gone

[Refrain]
How could you do it? what you did
Burned up my wings and made me creep

Trapped me inside of hopeless creed
Threw me down to the abyss, deep

I cannot hate the sun,it's burning
I cannot stop the world, it's turning

I cannot touch the sun,I burn
But I know I was never wrong

[Refrain]
How can you live immortal day?
How can you be reborn again?

How can you be so true but fake?
How could I make a fatal mistake?

How could you stay inside of me?
How could you make me trust in thee

How could I take your sun,your lust?
Searing you,turning you into dust...
