Away from all that light, apart from this strange life
We're dancing now, immortal dance we share in twilight

We cry as we fall down, we're staring at the sky
We die tonight ... we take our rest in our silence

Illusion brings back night, and call the darkened tide
In wish for nothingness and void we shall forgive us

In darkness step by step, towards eternal lie.
We are just falling down to find our last deliverance

[Refrain]
Here we have nothing to see
Only curtains of illusions where all the time stands still

In agony, trying to breath
All my useless thoughts are wasted, my unforgiven will

Here you leave and see, I bleed
In this killing and this silent, this filling emptiness

Feeling what's lost, where to flee
And the Shadows that are fading I lose again my way.

[Strophe]
Our silence where we dwell, our silence where we're spelled
Our silence to forget each other once forever.

To ease in misery, to know how deep we fell
No matter what we'll loose, we have it now or never.

And so its time for grief, but never to forgive
We're thrown away from throne of sacred violent fire

Abused we cringe to slaves, within this hollow grave
We're traitors to forget this is our last desire.

Here we have nothing to see
Only curtains of illusions where all the time stands still

In agony, trying to breath
All my useless thoughts are wasted, my unforgiven will

[Refrain]
Here you leave and see, I bleed
In this killing and this silent, this filling emptiness

Feeling what's lost, where to flee
And the Shadows that are fading I lose again my way.
