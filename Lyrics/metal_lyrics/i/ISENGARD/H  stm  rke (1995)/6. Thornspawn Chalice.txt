Emerging from the abyss of black hearts
Behold, the rise of the flaming trinity
Come forth high priests of impurity
Dwellers of the deeps of the Painking Sea
Mourners of life, yearners of death
Who fills their chalice with Thornspawn visions

Emerging from the abyss of black souls
Behold
The rise of the flaming trinity
Come forth high priests of impurity
Who fills their chalice with Thornspawn visions
Embrace symbols of that night without end
Glory, glory. Armageddon.
Chant damnations hymns
Bloodsmeared  ripping love to our souls and flesh
Rape out hateful hope in Daimonion communion
For we are draped in shadows
Until the night of the rising unholy three
