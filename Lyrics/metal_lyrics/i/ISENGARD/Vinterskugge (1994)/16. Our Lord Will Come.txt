We live for the woods and the moon and the night
we cast aside those who are searching for light
we dream of the days when the dark lord will come
preparing for doomsday       the battle is won
yeah

you're searching for light, you're searching
for night
- no-one can tell you who is right!

a joy fills my hear which is blackened inside
knowing my future will end at His side
the earth with is pitiful creatures and men
must suffer and cry slaying friend upon friend
yeah

bells are ringing into the night
nooooooooooooooooooooooone knows who's right!
oh yeah!

the time will come of the night without end
coldness and hate - the most beautiful friend
grim are the visions that live in my head
I hope that I live to see all of you DEAD.
oh yeah.

listen, listen:
now it's time to say goodbye
you can weep and you can cry
no more tears, little thing - no more tears
- you'll be dead; forgetting your fears.

the time has passed       
and we're the last,
the last.
