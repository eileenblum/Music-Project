A monument of brutality
Razor like precision killing
Eliminating wasted space
Enforcers, executioners
Heading the flock
Cranial manipulation
Synthesized organs
Harvested for the wealthy
Pulmonary bio-mechanics
Combined with nano-enhanced body systems
Unethical practices
Creates the first superhumans
A silent death at the hands of a synthetic beast
A hand on the throat
While the torso is evacuated
First entire dwellings
Then entire cities
Wait to die at the hands
Of Lord Cyborg
Hybrid metal fist breaks through the rib cage
Hydraulic fingers tear flesh
Feeling their way through the cavity
Reaching the heart and ripping it out
Over and over again
