False sense of hope aided by religious
Concepts blinds the populace
We are smiling as we traverse
The apex of our civilization
Our abuse sours the earth
As well as ourselves
We painfully realize our misdirection
Horrid experimentation begins
A struggle to adapt
A series of genomic failures
Starting on the poor
Mutilating, altering the flesh
A modern day bloodletting
A scramble to revamp the human body
Our inner barbarity fusing with
Our latest technology
Augmented cadavers
Sprawl the black horizon
Experimentation slows to a crawl
There will be no way to adapt in time
But we will continue the attempt
Our once ignorantly blissful race
Is now a flickering light
That feeds on itself
