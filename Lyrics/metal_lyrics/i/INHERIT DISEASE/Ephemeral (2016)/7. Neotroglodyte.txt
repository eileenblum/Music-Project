Forced de-evolution
Natural selection takes over
Left far behind
The last of the biological remnants
Pathetically forgotten
This is not what god intended
Monstrous deformities are a blessing
For they are removed and consumed
Hunchback filter-feeders inhale
Sulfuric scum that oozes
Up though the cracks
Of this abysmal purgatory
Now called home
They gather around
The cross at feeding time
Daily surgeries are a social event
That are greatly anticipated
The fleshy clumps resemble cauliflower
They are traded for fresh teeth
The closest thing to currency
Every vibration of thought and movement
Weeps with regret and sorrow
In a place where faith has prevailed
Over science and reason
