Stemming from beliefs it begins
Sides are taken, moral corruption ensues
An apocalyptic war follows
Mans inability to reason
There will be a world scale slaughter that
Completely severs the connection between sides
For one has the aid of technology and will prevail
Time will pass, knowledge will grow
As will depravity
Hate, fueled by pain replaces kinship
And overrides rationality
Eventually the reasons that have created the
Catastrophic divide will be forgotten and
the 'naturals' will be left fighting for scraps
In a wasteland of godless barbarity
Religion is the great plague of man
Science is the cure through utilization of
Technology
