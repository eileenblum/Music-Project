Long ago the bio-mutations ravaged the humanoids
In the peak of their despair
As humans crawled into their caves
They fed off the remains
As time passed, evolution took hold
Breeds of the miscreated mammalian atrocities
Sharpen their crooked appendages
Honing their frightening dispositions
The reproduction rituals assimilate
The discarded shells
Of the machines that now rule the universe
A bastard breed of nano enhanced
Cannibal monsters are born
Creatures with the ferocity of those
From the cretaceous, only impossible to kill
These upgraded mutants serve no purpose
Scouring the desolate landscape
In search of nourishment
Cleaving their disshoveled victims
From the cracks in the blackened earth
Where they dwell in fear
As most natural life is scarce
This breed has grotesquely adapted
The un-reachable victims are digested in place
With an external stomach
Liquefied in the charred strata where they hide
