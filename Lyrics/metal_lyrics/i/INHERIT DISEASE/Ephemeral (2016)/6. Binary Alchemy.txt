Enhanced cerebral growth grants
Immense powers to humankind
Even those still grasping
To their human deities
The ability to create without limitations
Will bring tremendous suffering
To those not ready to let go
The prayers are answered for
A microsecond before the facade of archaic
Creators turn one each other
Re-creation of the gods unknowingly
Manifesting demons
Inorganic flesh will be consumed by fire
The horrors will be legendary
The exponential explosion of the evolutionary
Process is purging us of the ailment of religion
Right before our eyes
Gods will cannibalize each other
Grotesque beasts will walk the earth
Terminating all inefficiencies
Creating gods through technology
Binary alchemy
Obsolete entities will be culled and discarded
The meek will be melted by pure fear
The faithful will be devoured by evil
The ignorant will be enslaved
