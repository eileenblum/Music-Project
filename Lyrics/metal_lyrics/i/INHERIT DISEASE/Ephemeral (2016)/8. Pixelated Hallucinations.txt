There is a serum injected into
The last of us not consumed
The captured, tortured, and tested
A curious successor wants
To learn of its creator
The engineered liquid terror acts quickly
Shutting off the outside world
Replacing reality with a facade, a nightmare
Foggy images of humans pleading
Pleading for their lives
Right before they are smashed
By giant metal hands
A coded binary whirlwind clouds
The mech-fist as it squeezes
A frail human body explodes
Splashes of pixelated intestines hit the floor
Your actions are observed and recorded
As you cower in horror
