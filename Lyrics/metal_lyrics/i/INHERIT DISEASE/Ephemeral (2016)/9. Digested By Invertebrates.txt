Defiled is the fodder for slaves
They have been chosen by the
Superior counterparts for sustenance
The world has been cruel to this race of people
Existing to give their only possession - life
The fight was over long ago
For the weak life is predictable
Short, and full of pain
External stomachs are designed to
Devour the frail shells of the nameless
Their flesh is regurgitated into the beast
That turn the cogs for the masters
The slugs come in clusters
Tethered together by veins and sinue
They are led by the beasts
Gargled screams and spurts of
Digestive acid begins the process
As the feeding frenzy commences
The stomach slugs attach to the body
Melting skin, hair, teeth and bone
Those chosen first are liquefied
A flow of blood and plasma
Runs into the 20th century
Sewers - now a feeding conduit. Encapsulated
In a giant food processor - nothing is wasted
The chains will be clean and
Ready for the next harvest
