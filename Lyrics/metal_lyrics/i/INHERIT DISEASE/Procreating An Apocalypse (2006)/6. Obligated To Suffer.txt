Heavens gate
Spawn ranch
Waco
Obligated to suffer

Removal from the exterior world at any cost-emigration
Societal deviant
Recruiting with immoral misleading means
Displays of unconditional affection and kindness upon entering

Eliminate free operation of personal thinking, and all judgement
Spirit breaking brain washing procedures, absolute dependence on a deranged leader

Convinced that the world is an unsafe place
Causing phobia, guilt and agony
All are embraced
Cults way of thinking becomes second nature
Individual ideals disintegrate

There is no exit imagined from this twisted evil place
Forgotten children expire slowly
Self completely gone, tortured existence
Giggling while reviving castration
