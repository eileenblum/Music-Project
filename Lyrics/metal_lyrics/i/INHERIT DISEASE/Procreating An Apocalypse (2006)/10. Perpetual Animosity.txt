Human disease
Torture everyone and everything-embedded in my brain
Tormenting my every moment, permanently toxic
My blood forever burns, my hate is fuel
A gift from humankind channeled from me to you

Perpetual Animosity

The hatred for this path is what drives normal men to kill
For the twisted and depraved, it's a never ending cycle
To dream of ending life, without a question why
There is no moral boundary to the sickness

The world moves to quickly for your fragile mind
An apathetic ending to your obnoxious life

This mental torment an ailment that will not stop
The entire world must be punished for what I am
