Host to maggots prematurely
Infestation begins early
Being devoured alive
As gangrene spreads,
They quickly thrive

Harboring a colony, killing of the living tissue
Derma now eradicated, wounds no longer superficial
Many frantic mating flies, hovering around the sores
Feasting on a living human, this cannot be happening

Degeneration, septicemia

The rise of suppuration
They feed off of the pus

Live, rotting

Dwell in my own foul odor
To far gone to be preserved
Past the onset of disease
I now welcome my demise

Degeneration, septicemia
Afflicted victim of the
Spreading myiasis
