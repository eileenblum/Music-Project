Catathymia
Emotionally traumatized
Beginning of the end
My brutal fantasy
Envelopes me

Unsolvable internal state
Leads to emotional tension
Dreaming of a violent deed
That i must now carry out

Paranoid, and anxious your blamed
Building desperation-uxoricide

Anger now a threat to my fragile sense of self
Imbuing violence with symbolic thinking
Tension culminates-catathymic rampage

Anger, tension, destabilization
My core perturbed, ungodly time bomb
Paranoia, killing the only way

Rage motivation

Stabbed hundreds of times

Killing with unparalleled ferocity
Animal instinct has taken over
I'm now a programmed killing machine

Extremely violent episode has been achieved
Target of the tension smashed repeatedly
After the brutality, relief

There is no recollection of the catathymic killing
