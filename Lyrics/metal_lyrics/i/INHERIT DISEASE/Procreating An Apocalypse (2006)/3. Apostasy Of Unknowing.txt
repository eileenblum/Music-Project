Apostasy of unknowing

Aposthetic rebirth
Pious to the unknown
Reverent paradox
Revealed

Your faith is my void
Absolving the venerable

Venerable opprobrium of fallacy
Sacred allegiance of lies
Doctrine of inconsistency
Apostasy fulfilled

Aggrieved conceit
Gagging on your own rhetoric

Dissolve hierarchy
Blind obedience
Recant parables
Of hatred
Deny leap of faith
Absurd remnants
Of a frantic
Necrophobe
