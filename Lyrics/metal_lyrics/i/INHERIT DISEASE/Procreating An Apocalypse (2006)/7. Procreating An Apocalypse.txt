They all stand up
Simultaneously
Viciously attacking living human beings

They move to fast to find decent shelter
A wave of death causes instant hemorrhaging

Virally infected-suffocate

Melting eyes and taking limbs and heads from torsos
Awake, and dead virus is devouring

Its over, human life, the sky bleeds
Devouring everyone who's heart still beats

Finish off the human race remaining life is dying out fast
Screams are now fading away, society a thing of the past
No prayer for a dying world, the blood in veins no longer courses
The living have all expired, behold a forst of virulent corpses

Procreating an apocalypse
Nothing left, turn on each other

Unbridled display of gore
Husk of man, freakishly torn
