Shades of gangrenous grey
Starts at the toes
Wounds that do not heal
Slowly it grows

Plastic bag
Draped over the limbs
Hiding the stench
Geriatric masochism

Engorged with fluid
Bag suffocated
Waterlogged, blackened feet
Toes obliterated
Resembling legs
Washed up on the shore
Hidden from the world
Geriatric masochism

Desperation evident
Amputation eminent

They perform the operation
There cutting of the feet
Amateur amputation
They burn the stubs of meat

Unable to hide
The horror is now discovered
Order the task
Of truncation
Unable to hide
The body is now dismembered
Order the task
Of truncation
