you are no longer human with a mind uploadeda tireless conscious grows weary no need for sleep , after 5 dayssanity melts awaywhat is was to be human, goneno mind left to decaycomputation blackoutkilling spree, of inhuman waysincoherent, images, irrational attacksconfusion, fighting each othercannibalism , mass obliterationof living things and objectsa world without rest , no cortexyet a need to escapeloss of function, paranoiaon a global scaleinfecting the hivemindthe world shutters as we slidetowards the edge of darkness
