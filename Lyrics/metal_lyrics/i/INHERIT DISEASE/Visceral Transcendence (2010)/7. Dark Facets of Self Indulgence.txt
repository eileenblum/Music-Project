a cold gaze of the unrealfalse realms of our inanimate childrenthrough veins do not coarse , synapses are firedas we travel through a twisted paradiseof our own making, a realm of indulgenceof lust and powerthe decay of reality myriad of pleasuresrepeating endlesslyto the point of disgusting perversiondrunk with powerin this garden of edenpleasure fuses with paina god with a bloodlustsurpassing the most deprivedmasochist, blinded by a fiendish brutality thought of the insane and schizophrenic are deleted redirection into another reality
