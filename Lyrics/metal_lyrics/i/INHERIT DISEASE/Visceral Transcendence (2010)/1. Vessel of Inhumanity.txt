precisely emulated soft tissue and tendonsdevoid of emotions bio weaponconglomerate of implants - gargantuanwretch - cthulhu liketentacles capturenot one drop of blood is wastedan experiment gone totally awryfrom its original purpose artificial monstrosityterrorizing the poverty stricken countrysidesucking bodies out of their shantieslike marrow from bonesadly this is only the beginningof the pain that man must endure in order to reach his destiny
