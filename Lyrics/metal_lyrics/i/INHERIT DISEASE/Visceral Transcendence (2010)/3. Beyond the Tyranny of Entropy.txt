the anchors of flesh trapped in the confines of biology no choice but to live or diebut with one err setting ourselves apartfrom the cold infinity - human intelligencecreative and destructivecapable of atrocities and great beauty has fabricated a successorto the ways of the natural worldapplication of intelligenceto the chaotic waysso begins the endof lifeonce the universal splendornow obsoletethe elimination of flesha transformation surpassing the emergence of intelligencepain is a memory of a now upgraded entity shapeshifter, god-likeunexpressed realms of creation and informationwill be released at light speedreconstruction of the universeon its way to perfection
