astonishing evolutionunnatural inheritancethe forfeiture of the earthreaching the human equivalentnecessarily soaring pastknowledge rivaling the emerganceof human intelligenceaccelerating proliferation of information technology innervates society and begins to subsume matters into codeman and machine convergesubmission eminent , denialan army of non-living entity's  become the master in secondssociety has a new castle system humans are as a race toleratedare pitied by the machines spiritual mechanical conscious begins human kind passes the torch of supremacy hope for the future withers beings bitter we are as our creation rulesself replication frenzy unrestrained creatures of a metal broodsupercomputers powerthe embodiment of a global brain
