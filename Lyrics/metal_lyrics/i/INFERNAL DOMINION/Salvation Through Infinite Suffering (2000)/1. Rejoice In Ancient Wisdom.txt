upon the sacred deception, the throne of a false conception
lies, blood, lies
with eyes to see, the cross does fold to which there is ancient wisdom
truth, will time see the fate of belief
death is to be where christ may be
christ in the mind of deception and dismay
shrouded in guilt and shame to god pray
it's to believe in false thought of a kind
blood runs in streams to a hill called calvary
rejoicing, kingdom damned
eyes to see (embrace undefiled wisdom)
lies of thee (embrace undefiled wisdom)
asunder is (embrace undefiled wisdom)
christianity (embrace undefiled wisdom)
return to the real world, no lies of god
shunning the oppressive holy crosses
restored is the truth of martyrs dying
to hear their voices no more
corpses collapse onto holy crosses
sinning, breathing of their hell
with real knowledge i know no hell
