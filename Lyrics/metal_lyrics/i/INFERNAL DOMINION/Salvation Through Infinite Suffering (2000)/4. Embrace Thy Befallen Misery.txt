sinner! no goodness waits for you. perish in the flames of hell.
no holy pain will ever touch my soul
what i have seen off from the lord's plea for fragile souls to offer them peace
i shall not go to his outstretched limbs; i offer my soul to no one
the cross stands before me and i laugh at its cause knowing all of its
faults
the cross stands before me and i strike it down, so hear my words that i
say,
"fuck jesus christ!"
embrace hell
the lord be dead to thy soul
i embrace the pain of hell
of the darkness waiting, a destiny to welcome the thought of never serving
to
a light, a power
i choose misery, i choose godlessness, i choose myself
fuck the standing of the lude church
the reigning power of the heavens is to be damned by my own hand
i will never see the ways of christ
i am the reason christ suffered
i am the reason christ died
i am the reason that christ will fail
that all of man told me i will burn is the reason that i must withstand
from the crown that bled his brow
to the followers that keep him alive today, i proclaim a wickedness to
expose
his weakness
embrace thy befallen misery
fuck jesus christ
no man should stand before a god to serve
no woman a whore for holiness
no child a slave to his tyranny
christianity is a punishment to the mind and soul, a punishment that is
unfitting and illusive
i will not go
this is what i know
this is what i will burn for
hear my words
i will burn for this
i will burn for this
