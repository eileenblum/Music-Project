gutted..
confessions for the youth to weaken resistance
gutted..
for a god, his dead slaves
no light of god, i choose madness
gutted children of faith
inside the well of life, poison diseases fortune for the herding of the
throne
common are the bleeding dying entrails of what used to be their reasoning
don't forgive my sins, i'm not your son
with pride i stand alone from the cross
nails through flesh, beckon me not for i will not pray
gutted..
as he guts his children, i will not be forgiven
gutted children
the weakened savior turns to the worthless masses, claims their minds, owns
their thoughts and owns their souls
a delite to herd his sheep
as he guts his children, i will not be forgiven
gutted children
