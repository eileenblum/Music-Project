of the many-venomed earth hell has risen to peneance those of he whom hath
damned us.........
waste deep in christian blood
glory in such a path to inflict such dark pain and deny all mercy
conquering in a sea of blood, here christ is not king
the righteous now suffer so long as done before to all of us here
so is this hell where you've fallen?
sink into the depths of what's holy
passed is the dawn, cursed as our kind
christian bitches die
as we pass through blood floods, i spit down onto them
looking above to see heaven
laughing and claiming victories
shedding floods of holy blood
jesus turned wine into his blood
and they drank it for salvation
now in one tide its all the same...
dead
