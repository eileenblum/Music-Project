Let these be words to damn the luminous cause of the tyrannical cross,
Without mercy, let the darkness in me show faulted volumes of deceit that
have been enriched
By the lord; and may all men holy decay in the shadow that is my refusal
and
strength,
From the abyss that beckons my soul, from the darkest causes that logic has
forced me to endure,
From the blackest dreams of Heaven's true existence, and from the tainted
throne that will never call to me;
This is my testament, that I am never to return from the darkest places of
human reasoning, that I am never to bestow upon myself a return to the
frail
land of clouds, angels, and thin glory,
I create my commandment, and I refuse the chosen ten.
I loathe the boundaries of the mortal man that weeps in the arms of the
Heavenly Father,
I reject the miseries therein, and I state, as I have proven in so many
passing blasphemous occasions before, I will never bow down to one man, to
one statue, to one belief, or to one thought that puts me below any
ideology;
I am of one voice, but of many;
I am of one man, but an army;
I am of one opinion, but of ancient wisdom and truth;
Of destiny and dark clouds, let my causes be known, let the truth shine
upon
the cracked faces of Christian adoration, and let them see the corrosion of
their very souls;
But for one to understand the nature of my hatred, one must know of the
Father in which my hatred is focused;
He is the father to decompose all of his peasants that swallow disease;
It is of his love that all breathing, aspiring souls will taste sickness,
shame, and death;
He harvests those he grows in the common fields of blind holiness, those to
be slain by his book;
He punishes the shameful and the willing,
He destroys the very instincts that compose humanity, the more precious
elements of the human being;
Let the meek destroy their own minds and let perish the children who would
obey
Let the criers of eternal life and infinite promise exhaust themselves in
the
mist of absolute truth;
Were the pages of biblical torment have sworn me to blasphemy, let the
masses
know of my contempt;
Let it be known to God and Man that I am this far gone
Understand my lawless existence among the degenerating free will of
blistered
holy puppets
For so long I have dismissed the false grandeur of bright, gentle angel
wings
upon the brow of
Children, heroes, and the great suffering masses;
For ages I have come to despise the sweet chimes of Heaven's glorious
bells,
For I know this place as no paradise, I know this place as no refuge;
This place called heaven was fused to hang his children at their very
throats,
I have seen from the clouds of paradise, the great masses hang high,
beneath
his laughter they decay;
I will not choose this destiny, I will not die with the rest;
With every effort my cause is strengthened,
With every passing moment I dissolve another preset paradigm of worthless
righteousness;
I am here to deconstruct the falsity of the Christian being,
I have this voice sounding in my throat for the sake of mirroring the
greatness of Heaven with truth of a tainted promised land;
I desire these timeless fables to crumbled within my heretic grasp
No hollow, threatening rants from the void and tired throats of blind
followers can convert me,
No fear of the mighty hand of the sky can sway me,
I am the unbeliever, and in this disbelief I can not be moved,
For I am this far gone
