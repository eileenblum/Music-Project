hence, i witness the foul, and bereft....
onto which the lord hath blessed, whither the shadow of heavenly light
to the grim taste as purity dies, disgorge thy disease that entombs thy
mind
and swallows thy dreams
break thy oath to the lord to see clear the sky above... nothing
as thy children choose to die and perish without thy light
to embrace the sins of man
purging purity
seek not hope, nor redeem christ painted soulfully
force fed their deaths
god within their cheeks and gagging throats
here's the end, purity purged
mind aflame at christ's death
go kill what's inside
within his reign
to purge thy faith
invert thy pain carving out from the holy man
