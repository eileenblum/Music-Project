Gateways Of Tragedies
Now Are Opened Up To M
To The Landscape
Where Dying Sun Glows
Darker  Darker  Horizons To The Gale
There Our Step Further Shall End
In Soil Of Ashes
As Stenches Of Rot We Shall Unite
Standing On The Dead Ground
That Commended To Die Bewildered
The Calm Before The Storm
As The Darkness Itâs All I See
A Dying World Enigma
Is An Abysm Of Bedropped Lands
The Thundering Burst
In The Skies Full Of Wrath
Revelation Of Our Destiny
Seeds Of Life Submerges
In The Embers Fireâs Blaze
Havoc Is Worshipping Death
Darker  Darker  Horizons To The Gale
There Our Step Further Shall End
