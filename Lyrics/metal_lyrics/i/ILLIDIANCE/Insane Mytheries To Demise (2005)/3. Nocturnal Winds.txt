Spirits are rising from the fullmoon flame
With the darkness in sky
Aghasting rebellion inside 
Eternal evil
Benighted creatures are waking
Await me in dark !
To rise in nocturnal winds
Chains of past arenât bound me now
Iâm arriving to endless dark
In cold rays of moonlight aiming
Upwards to the frozen sky
Vortex relieve me from earthâs soils of torment
Uplift me in wise wind of freedom and whod
Grant me wings blees me by thy moonlight
In blackwinged night enclouded gates
As I return to the form of the beast
In the bleak light of the blackening moon
Shadows fell â my time is coming
Thus Ashtaroth release me

Evil beauty in this dark skyline
And I fly in a funeral stream
Streams from abyss bring all mystique
At the gates of endless dark 
Void of coldness â ancient powers
Abyss blows in the light of the moon
To beyond world now lead by clouds
To infernal evil in gates
I am pure I greet this new world 
Behind the curtain of false world of lies
With the winds of the darkside 
I return to a nocturnal lands

Now I return to domains of nocturnal winds
