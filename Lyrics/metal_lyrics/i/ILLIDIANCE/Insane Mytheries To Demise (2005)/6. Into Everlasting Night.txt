Trial by fear is done and I prefer darkness
That owerwhelmes me, raising wings skywards

âDarkness descends from the sky aboveâ
Falling to me - achieving my heart
âDarkness descends from the sky aboveâ
Embracing me - my arms opened wide
All despair endured, soaring in clouds
Rise above, influence of dark...
I gaze into this everlasting night
The call exciting leaves from regrets
My bestial nature screams out my name
My splendid passions search for release
âRevealing fireâ from the heart

World enslaved by night

âDarkness descends from the sky aboveâ
Embracing me - my arms opened wide
âDarkness descends from the sky aboveâ
Encircling me - curtains of dark
Infinitive walking with the wind together
Without painful light
Mourning clouds lead my way
Where stars are bid me welcome in lurking dream
The exergone of dark
Dominion of nightshade
Where freedom winds have reigned
My pure essence will dominate
