Iâm Flying On Burning Wings
To The Sething Skies Of Dusk
Captured Angels Are Falling, Bleed
Wolves Tear Them With Battlelust
Twilight Is Flamed With Funeral Wind
Coloured Battlesky In Red
With Blessed Sword Iâm Fond of Kills
Bastard Angels Became Dead

We Are Chosen Vultures In The Skies
The Funeral Wind Now Blackens By Our Side
To Dethrone The Light

As The Gates Opened To A Death Below
Christian Whimps Are Dying, Filthy Blood Flows

Your Fucking God Shall Die

Our Wrath Released In Bloodrain 
Wounded Angels Are Falling Down
Look Below There Our Betrayed Brothers
Lie On Ground

I Raise My Wings In Powers Of The Gale
With Bloodlust
As The Mighty Berserk I Want Only Blood
So Die Light
In These Battleskies Our Darkness Shall Triumph
Then Light Fades
Unleash My Fury Mighty Sword Of Evil
With The Singing Of Death

There Is No Salvation
Decapitate Them
As The Gates Opened To A Death Below
Christian Whimps Are Dying, Filthy Blood Flows

Look Above Welkin Is Flamed With Wrath
Saint Liars Are Falling From The Skies
Bugles Singing â Our Battle Ends
Light Fades Out , Wolves Now Are Led By Freedom
