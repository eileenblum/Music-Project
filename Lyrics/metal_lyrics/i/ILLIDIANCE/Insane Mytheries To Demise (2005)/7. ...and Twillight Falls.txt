Thus in miriads of days obscure
I look for another time â darkness to cure
Clouds are fading out bringing melancholy
Midnight sun is calling my soul to release
I wait for the darkest hours
In the blessings of twilight
I wander
Twilight now falls from skies
In reverence I blaze inside
Darkness begets my soul to living freed
My wounds all are healed
