Flame takes crosses â requiem of life
Blood in oceans, saints wept with gore
Human kind Canât survive
The creation is turned back   
Judjement day has come
Faith dies wasted, conquest ruined earth
Descends darkness pouring down with blood
Opened gates To realm of death
Unleashed beast Life diseased
Inauguration evil one of thy spell
Earthquake â the abyss howling
For our lifes burnt to dust

Revelation â the seventh day is passed
Supremacy of calling evil bells

The art of life drowned in void of hate
The world collide with invasing death
No asylums left, sorrow wept within
As our way commended to the soil of ashes

Forever fading out That is our last dawn
Wrath comes from the sky This is the end of lifeâ¦

The art of life drowned in void of hate

No asylums left, sorrow wept within
As our way commended to the soil of ashes

Forever fading out That is our last dawn
Wrath comes from the sky This is the end of lifeâ¦
