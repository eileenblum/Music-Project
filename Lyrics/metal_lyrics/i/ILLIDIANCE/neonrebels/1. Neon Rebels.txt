You feel the scream, but no sound is coming out 
As surture needle impales the skin , all senses overloaded 
Your boiling blood is infested with living drug 
Replacing the nerves with nano-swarm 
Your turn, your stride, the yearning heart beats in time 
Get up, Get up your fucking ass and jump 
To the pulse of doomsday party 
Youâre mesmerized, ascending electrified 
The rebels soul ignites with neon , control denied 

Go forth, there is no tomorrow 
And you canât remember yesterday 
The blinded eyes are opened wide 
With gliding wings life steps aside 

Wherever it takes you higher 
Youâll find the divine touch of insanity 
Bringing you down, in flamesâ¦ 

Deserted hell, but none here is to care 
As the doomsday party goes next floor, 
The stage is overcrowded 
The goal is near , just take the new âred pillâ 
Obtain the dose of cyber splendour 
The afflux of ecstasy , decoded divinity 
The mortal life is actually out of fashion 
Your back â two scars, endeavor and kiss the stars 
Metallic leaves remove the rust from soul, your encaged soul 

Wherever it takes you higher 
Youâll find the divine touch of insanity 
Bringing you down, in flamesâ¦ 
Again and againâ¦ 

It feels like youâre bleeding, youâre wasting your life 
Face to face with the profane grace, 
Fear the taste of a daylight dream of injected venom 
On delusive desire, and youâre falling down 
Agonized, desensitized, 
Burnt inside youâre falling down to the stage of party 
It feels like youâre bleeding, youâre wasting your life 
Face to face with the profane grace, 
Fear the taste of a daylight dream of injected venom 
On delusive desire, and you fall fall down 
Agonized, desensitized, burnt inside you fall fall down 

Go forth, there is no tomorrow 
And you canât remember yesterday 
The blinded eyes are opened wide 
With gliding wings life steps aside 

Wherever it takes you higher 
Youâll find the divine touch of insanity 
Bringing you down, in flamesâ¦ 
Again and againâ¦ 

I know we are not angels, 
But weâre able to tear down their leavesâ¦
