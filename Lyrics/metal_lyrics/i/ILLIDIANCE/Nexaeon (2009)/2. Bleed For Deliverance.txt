...I prepared my veins to bleed
Let scars to adorn me on liquid poison from my veins
Aspered the ground demigod I've become
Let the spiritual fire burning bright as stars
Into the skies of all dominions my redemption final sin
Let fuck off this world, die abandoned
Bleed for deliverance
The bewildering chaos in my eyes says no regrets
Let my wreath of sharpened horns
Bewailing me like Christ in Babylon
Yawning abyss look into me
Let the spiritual fire burning bright as stars
Into the skies of all dominions
Let the guilded throne of distant realms I behold
Horned weath the crown of razors
Light is fading in me like a candle in the wind
The pain below I left delivered freedom, said I...
Let the spiritual fire burning bright as stars
Into the skies of all dominions my redemption final sin
Let fuck off this world, die abandoned
