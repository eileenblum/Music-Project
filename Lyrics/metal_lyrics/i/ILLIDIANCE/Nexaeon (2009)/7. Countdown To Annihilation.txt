Maelstrom of coming war leads the blade,
Consuming our vengence
Our Detest hate is ranged with
Nuclear klotons
The sight of loaded gun, the final strike
In war already lost in the beginning
Vacuum belongs to blind
Fanatic weapons blasting, gets shattering the Earth
And more than prey they'll becom?Never
Hardened they're haunted, and subsequently
Will find asylum in paws of their own created vultures
I conjure that
The human kind's self putrefaction
Too enfeebled to defiance from the deceit
Shall die.
Scorched Earth I witness
Rigid time in the reverence of dust
Thawing light dwells awaiting the last strike?
No fragile human being!!!
