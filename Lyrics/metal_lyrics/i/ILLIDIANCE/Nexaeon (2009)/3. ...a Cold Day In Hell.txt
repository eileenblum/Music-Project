Denomination! Share the dawn of lost soul
Through hatred rushes I'm obtaining beasty shell
I'm hunting...
Non-living assassin, prevailing the pain with
Blood's amphetamine, death is the only escaping way
From shallow grave called human being!
Let the gallow of the will hauting me - no
The one who's no soul inborn
I lurk in afflux of nightmare beside
Ensared in subconciousness, murdered mind
Exile of death, infested with madness anguish ravages within
Default - Killing my flesh!!!
My pandemonium entered, rampagious fear
I'm coming for you...
Moving beneath the surface of world
Plundering the coul of dying mortals
The god has forsaken me
I lost my essense in delivered fates
Inhaling haze of fear, shredding like razor
The yawning chasms of chaos beyond all
But still in me!!!
Yeah, the only way - my destiny
No mercy, coz I'm your cold day in hell!!!
...I'm your cold day in hell
My wounds are so empty like eyeholes og skulls
Torture I swallow is your cold day in hell...
