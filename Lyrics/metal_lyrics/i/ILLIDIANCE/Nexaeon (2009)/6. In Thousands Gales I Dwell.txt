Upcovered with my dreams
The ocean drifts opened
In depths of darkest gales I breathe
Where black devours the light
They're waves, the ageless nomads
The wanderers of seas
I roam with them all
...Aeon by aeon, wave by wave
In dormancy I'm patiently waiting
The dungeon I am, infested with enigmas
That is older than the universe
And time itself
Let cold waves be my eyes,
That look beyond horizons.
The sphere I submerge
Deep down in roaring oceans.
In thousand gales I dwell,
Dementia concealed,
Shall be revealed at end
...I am emptiness
...I am infinity
...I know the final gate
I am the gate!
