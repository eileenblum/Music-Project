I search the universe with my myriad of eyes supreme
All transcendental senses
Scan the infinite web of stars
Yeah, I find the way - In nebulas there is a sign
For my tribe, my clan, my breed - chaos wanderers
Go, nomads, devouring of stars
Just reloading our guns
Go, demons, in blazing spheres
Taste the chaos of the space
Thus inconceivable our being from before the time
Erupted prominence us our cradle, 
We inhale the dust of ways of inner
Universes we ride astral bodies wrapped in 
Blackness beyond cosmic boundaries
Rise! Rise!
Chaos reborns us non - living
Chaos reborns us non - living
Chaos' nomads - crawling among stars
Chaos' nomads - crawling among stars
Aghasting is the wisdom we bring
With the waves of abnormal choas we come
Endlessly wandering under cosmos' shelter
