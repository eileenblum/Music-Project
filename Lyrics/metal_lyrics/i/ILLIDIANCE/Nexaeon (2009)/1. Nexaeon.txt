We bring the fucking birth of a new world 
And dust to the predating
Let praise Messiah nailed to plastic cross
Predicting chaos uprise
While the extinct race at all rots
In injected paradise
From genetic perversions we born
The trive of demigods
Conform us as cradles of Nexaeon
The Wheel of will is turned
Upnail the skin of Earth with neglecting spheres
Necrobionic seeds
Finally, there is no humand kind heh, there is no any kind
In synthetic fates we wander
Admiring the innocence indeed
Abluted by torrents of ether
We bow to the dawn of new age
Abnormal nature full of phantasms the void of unbeings 
Let Nexaeon genotype brand the forthcoming dawn
Of thousand stars in union
We bring the fucking birth of a new world
Intent supreme
And dusk to the predating, Infested with lepers
Let praise Messiah nailed to plastic cross
Predicting chaos uprise
In reverence we shall burn
