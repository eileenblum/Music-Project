A litany Of Exileâs Echoes Agnostos
Where Eternity Loose Itâs Meaning

Dormancy Beyond All Stars I Inhale
Profound As Thousands Of Nights
And Bonds Of Time Abandoned, Let Common
This Is The Autopsy Of All Faith
Abysmal Dark Desires
The Wisdom I Obtain
Abnormal And Unhallowed

Splendour I Submerge Eternal
Sacrilegious And Hallow
Heal And Deliever , Unveil My Soul Forevermore
Dreadful Wisdom Lies In Chaos
Asylum Of Minds I Share 
Not Recoiling I Collide

So Many Aeons Have Passed On The Face Of Earth
But Illidiant Kings Of Abyss Still Dwells Within Itâs Utter 
Darkness

The Past Present And Future At One 
In Pharinx Of The Abyss
The Madness Phantasms Of Infinite Space
Supremacy
Universe I Shall Roam Among The Stars Ephemeral
Enigmas Iâve Discerned And Submerged
In Torrents Of Chaos Iâve Summoned The Beast

Cold Void Of Unconscious Dream I Enter
Rebel Phenomenons With Chaos Breathe Universe 

I Drown In Thy Sea Of Anguish And Pleasure
My Mortal Burden Left, My Essense Is Avatar Of Demonic Breed 
Sins Iâve And I Will Sin Forevermore Will Be Freed 
In This Void
