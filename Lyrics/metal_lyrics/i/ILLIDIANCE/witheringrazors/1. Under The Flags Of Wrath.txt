The Battlefield Weâve Waited So Long
A New Canvas We Drawing On With Tears
That Asperse Our Sacred Swords
In Catharsis Of A Bleeding Soil &amp; Transfixing Groans
Weâll Nevermore Repent

[Ref:]
Quell And Broke The Gates
Inaugurate The Our Deliverance
Waking Againâ¦
Harden Our Souls As Swords
Raise The Flags!

The Flags Of Hatred Burn
Unleashing The Beast
Convoking Our Berserk Ride

With Oskoreign Ride We Praise Nemesisâ Coming Forth
Bewildering From Land Of Slavs
Aghasting Rage

Battlesounds On And On
Thus We Vow To Bonfires Of Ancestors
The Land We Sworn And Kneel
With Lambent Eyes We Shred This Light
Forbidden Art Our Essense

[Ref:]
Quell And Broke The Gates
Inaugurate The Our Deliverance
Waking Againâ¦
Harden Our Souls As Swords
Raise The Flags!

The Flags Of Hatred Burn
Unleashing The Beast
Convoking Our Berserk Ride

With Oskoreign Ride We Praise Nemesisâ Coming Forth
Bewildering From Land Of Slavs
Aghasting Rage

[Lead Xyrohn]

So Many Aeons On Earth Remember
Our Will Shall Be Done
And Became An Eerie Legend Of â¦
â¦Slavonic Chaos Warrior Hordes
Besieging All Strongholds Of Lies

[Repeat first verse and ref.]
