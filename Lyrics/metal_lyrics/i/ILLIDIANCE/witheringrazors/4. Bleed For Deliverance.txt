...I prepare my veins to bleed

Withering razors within my skin
Let scars to adorn me on
Liquid poison from my veins
Aspersed the ground
Demigod I've become

Let the spiritual fire burning bright as stars
Into the skies of all dominions
My redemption final sin
Let fuck off this world, die abandoned

Bleed for deliverance

The bevildering chaos in my eyes
Says no regrets
Let my wreath of sharpened horns
Bevailing me like christ in a babylon
Yawning abyss look into me

Let the spiritual fire burning bright as stars
Into the skies of all dominions
Let the guilded throne of distant realms i behold
Horned wreath-the crown of razors

Light is fading in me
Like a candle in the wind
The pain below I left delivered
Freedom said I...

Withering razors within my skin
Let scars to adorn me on
Liquid poison from my veins
Aspersed the ground
Demigod I've become

Let the spiritual fire burning bright as stars
Into the skies of all dominions
My redemption final sin
Let fuck off this world, die abandoned
