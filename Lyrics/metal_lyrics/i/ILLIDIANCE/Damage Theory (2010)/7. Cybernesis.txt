I've discerned what's fucking burning within my mind
Cyber implants are groaning in hunger
Shattered, re-issued DNA now is haunting for me
Pain denies regrets, Termination bliss

Something is killing me

Straight into streams of my own
Reliving radiance I dwell
The life's insanity I'll feel never ever again

Morphing biomech is undercover
Blood within my veins from currents of power
I realise that cyber issues absorb my own
With a myriad knives within

Straight into streams of my own
Reliving radiance I dwell
The life's insanity I'll feel never ever again
I'm dying

Now I'm free, drowned in anguish and pleasure
Leaving a shell aside
Let me feel the nano-sense direction, covering my mind,
My ascension
