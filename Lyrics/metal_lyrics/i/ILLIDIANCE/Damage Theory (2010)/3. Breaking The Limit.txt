All the nerves are straining on, let's start the race
One second to take-off and tire-covers
are burning down, I burn the trace
Bolide is my extension
Yeah, this pursuit I was born to, and I'm ready to drive
I strain my mind to one thought
I am on a highway
Outrun to survive, flameout of injecting toxic fuel

Elusive, I turn on nitrogen dioxide and break the limit

Turbulence is on my trail, the torsion torque
Is shattering the night
And the needle is going off-scale,
My nozzles burn the contest is mine
Yeah, this pursuit I was born to,
And I'm ready to drive

Elusive, I turn on nitrogen dioxide
And break the limit

I strain my mind to one thought
I am on a highway
Outrun to survive, flameout
Of injecting toxic fuel
