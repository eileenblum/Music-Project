When I opened my plastic eyelids I've stored you
Virus of restricted emotion rapidly filled my nano brain
I'm not able to rectify the error in the program,
Failed to erase your image
Segments of code from your face again

Kill me now, stop the synthetic heart
No, I can't do it by myself
Time is running out and disappearing from us
So it's time to fade away

My own feelings are just a side-effect of the test
Why it becomes so painful to realize that you're just a tool?
Life procreated me and now it dumps me as waste,
It kills my self-rendered nature,
My cyber love violates their rules, their foolish rules

Kill me now, stop the synthetic heart
No, I can't do it by myself
Time is running out and disappearing from us
So it's time to fade away

For my love there are no asylums left
But I'm a human being

There's no place for my synthetic fate
And I want to scream
