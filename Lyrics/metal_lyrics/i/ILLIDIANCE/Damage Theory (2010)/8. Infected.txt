Dead eyes watching me
Earth's hit with leprosy
Legacy of a dying kind
Killed by itself from inside

No fate I witness
We're fucking rotten
Infected

Ruins of all fates
Death's nemesis naked a blade
Plague comes from space
To fuck down a shameful race

No fate I witness forever
The voices in me,
They're calling from the ashes of bygone days
A failed way with no answers, no memories remain
Just scars of neglected cities,
Filled with emptiness and silence at the end
The day of reckoning,
I hear them all - their desperate cries

No Fate I witness
We're fucking rotten
Infected

All around me - just empty eye-sockets
