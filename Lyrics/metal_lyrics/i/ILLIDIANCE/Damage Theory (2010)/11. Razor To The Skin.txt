Razor into your skin
You're infected with a lie
Virus boils your mind
Mesmerized by suicide
One death every forty seconds
Like the last burned leaf will fall
You are no more

Unsheathe the razor blade
You cannot live this life again
No way for salvation, avoid the disease
All aims for solution lead you down

Fake, it's just a code
Forcing you to kill yourself
Carry on, contaminate
With infection from the web
Your running blood
Conjures all life around
Choose the end of pain
Shot, rope, spots on withered blade

No way for salvation, avoid the disease
All aims for solution lead you down

Unsheathe the razor blade
You cannot live this life again
No way for salvation, avoid the disease
All aims for solution lead you down
