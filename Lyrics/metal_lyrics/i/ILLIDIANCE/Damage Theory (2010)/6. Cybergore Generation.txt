Go, activate the secret programs
The core is crushed
Terminate the secret cradle
Deny the mind control of mortals
We are leaving our cyber womb

We'll break the source of limitations
In your eyes I see a new generation
Go, set the world into new progress

Set the world into new progress
We clone ourselves and force self-evolution
Our minds achieved the genesis
We are not slaves

We'll break the source of limitations
In your eyes I see a new generation

Lack of mortal life absorbs us
Self-rendered
For them we are lurking
Virus in the web,
That brings new world's dawn
