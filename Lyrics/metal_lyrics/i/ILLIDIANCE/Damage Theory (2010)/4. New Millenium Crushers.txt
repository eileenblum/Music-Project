Open Your eyes and see the glow of a dying sun
Rusted shell of day-dream, bosom of injected fate,

The mode that you'll give up
Feel the sonic waves shaking,
Thrilling through your spine with electricity
Come to their source,
Where the millennium crushers
Are coming and waking a new dawn

Right here! Refuse the world made of delusion,
Fake! I wanna hear you
Right now! All your neurons collide in fusion,
Trying to restart your life

Open your mind, break free from the puppet threads
Feel your pulse charging in deep resonance
With our cyber-beat
Sonication is crushing the overcrowded
World of lifeless dreams
A gleam of hope where the millennium crushers
Are coming and waking to a new dawn

Right here! Refuse the world made of delusion,
Fake! I wanna hear you
Right now! All your neurons collide in fusion,
Trying to restart your life

As we're coming near!
