Do you see me?
I'm on your trail
My exoskeleton
Injects the rage
Weapons-Checked
You're in my sight
I raise the gun
And fucking hit the mark
The strike is done, scaled as
Critical Damage

I smell your fear
The drops of splashing blood
Give me direction
I'm overdosed with rush
Weapons-Checked
You're in my sight
I raise the gun
And fucking hit the mark

The strike is done, scaled as
Critical Damage

My searchgate will always find your beating heart
I'm coming for you now, like a hunter for the prey

Your system failure cannot hide, you cannot hide
The game is over, I'm near, I'm just behind!
