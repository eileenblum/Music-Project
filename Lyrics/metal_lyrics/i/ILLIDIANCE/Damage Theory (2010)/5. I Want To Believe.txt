Have you ever dream of world, not coloured in grey
Where someone is waiting for you...

One day I've awaken above the rusted jails of skyscrapers
Above the streets filled with dust of days
And vice of nights

Was it a dream or was it real?
I don't know, but I want to believe
I know we're not alone, I've seen the new suns shining
I've seen another worlds, where roads are paved with starlight

Another race showed me new life, not wasted in routine intentions
Where freedom is not joker in a pack of days

Was it a dream or was it real?
I don't know, but I want to believe
I know we're not alone, I've seen the new suns shining
I've seen another worlds, where roads are paved with starlight

I've seen the faces weaved of light,
But no one believes me
And I take a look to the sky above,
While others stare at ground...

Was it a dream or was it real?
I don't know, but I want to believe
I know we're not alone, I've seen the new suns shining
I've seen another worlds, where roads are paved with starlight
