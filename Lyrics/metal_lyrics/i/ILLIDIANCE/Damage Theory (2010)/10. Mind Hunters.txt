I'm hunting, shredding down the thorns
Chained to your own reality
Through subconsciousness
I exhaust my mind and replace thoughts
With illusions!
Light...you see the shine of the deceptive sun
Real...there's nothing real at all, besides me

Your thoughts injection overwhelms my blood
I relieve my satisfaction
Like a junkie needs a dose
I'm addicted to emotions

Life burns away, life burns and even more
The perception you feel is me
Throughout the time I'm stealing all your minds
Your life's breeding inside me
Light...you see the shine of the deceptive sun
Face to face, I am the god or death or even Christ
Game over, disconnection
Your fucking mind is next in line

Life burns away, life burns and even more
The perception you feel is me
Throughout the time
I'm stealing all your minds
Your life's breeding inside me
