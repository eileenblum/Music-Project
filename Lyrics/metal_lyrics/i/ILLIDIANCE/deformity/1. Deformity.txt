I am the one, deviation from the kind,
With fate blown up to splinters
Destruction is hardening me with stabs
But I'm not undone, pain - I will overcome it!
These days, these scars , the boiling blood within my heart!

Gale clouds hide my smile

[Refrain:]
My daydream ocean coasted away before your pride,
Bare hopes fired by sun, but I'll never give up faith
My own fate, this day will never come

I deny the red tape of weekdays, I'm driving in the oncoming lane
Deforming me - sharpening my spikes
Fuck your deception, I hate your lies
I run the gauntlet and my will never die

We're playing circles the same old game,you draw the rules so I should loose again
This must end, it's my complaint, cause I'm fed up with your judgement
I'm loosing you, you want me loose my mind, but all senses tied, I'm burnt inside,
Your game failed, more I'm not to
No matter, now I hate you

My daydream ocean coasted away before your pride,
Bare hopes fired by sun, but I'll never give up faith
My own fate, this day will never come
