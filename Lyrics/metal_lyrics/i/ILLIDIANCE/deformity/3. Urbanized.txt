Shadows fill the empty heart of the city overcrowded, and I am
Seeing lights that gives no heat, erased fates that make my soul bleed
This night I'm mesmerized, I can hear your silent cry beside
Despaired, Denied, Starving to breathe...

I walk through puppet crowd, cold valleys, web of subways, and I see
Dead drones that fill the hive, sleepwalker shells stripped of their lives
Still hope to find your sign, I can hear your yearning breath beside
Despaired, Denied , Searching for Me

So runaway now, Into everlasting night that draw emotions
Well hidden and waiting for the day
Never lived, never loved one day will be awaken
But now, but now I feel so cold

I feel you, I want to, to hold you in my arms
But NO, Nothing I can touch
When every taken step becomes countdown in the silence
And every bygone day forms a string of your judgement
You desperately wanna find out who lives not just exist
Because "to breathe" is not enough "to feel"

So runaway now, Into everlasting night that draw emotions
Well hidden and waiting for the day
Never lived, never loved one day will be awaken
But now, but now I feel so cold

When every footstep makes me bleed, when no one believes I hide the truth within

You're dying all alone surrounded by your own heartbeat
You scream and for thousand miles there only silence in respond
You scream you want to live, but for what do you stay alive here?
So stay with me, stay with me, so runaway with me!

So runaway now, Into everlasting night that draw emotions
Well hidden and waiting for the day
Never lived, never loved one day will be awaken
And now, right now I'm not alone

Right now I'm not alone!
But why is my body cold?...
