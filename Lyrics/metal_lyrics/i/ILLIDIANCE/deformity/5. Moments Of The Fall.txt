Joy... Sorrow... Our paces hopes and actions...
Our victories and defeats...
Our strivings and passions, the faces of beloved...
Are the leaves in whirl of autumn winds...

Alone on the valleys of my heart
I'm arranging the candles in the dark
My recollections never let me be
These times of joy and grief are inside of me
The sparks above the flame are the moments of the fall
They are slowly fading out in shadows of the dusk

On my way, every step reveals the moment of my fate before me
But in the end, bygone days remain me falling in love...that lost
I will wait you all lifelong...

I stand on the seashore of our times, where waves are reflections of you and I
I hear the words I failed to tell, wind carries them into the gale...

On my way , every step reveals the moment of my fate before me
But in the end, bygone days remain me falling in love...that lost
I will wait you all lifelong...
I will wait you all lifelong in never ending waltz of our fall

There is no way to rewind our days as a filmstrip and only memories can show it again
Our fates are the leaves arrayed in sienna; they're sinking in cold autumn rains
