This speed completely changed my mind,c I drive faster than reflection.
My soul is ignited with a fuel, a fuel of hatred.
Erasing the rust of hypocrite world , i shatter all the limits,
I've reached the fucking boiling point, i press the gas I'm leaving out

I drive to horizon, like a distant falling star that's waiting for you,
piercing the skyline i outrun, just one more mile I'm closer to my fate

I'm here, the outlaw on the trace, drunk with acceleration,
and now I'm free enough for you, for you to hate me.

The rush of octane overdose, the sound of tire meltdown,
beyond the final boiling point i found my maniac haven.

I drive to horizons, like a distant falling star that's waiting for you,
piercing the skyline i outrun, without backward glance

the pages of memories torn apart, burning down the chains cause i break loose.
I'm going away and you cannot trace me or even hold down me, fuck you.

I've stunned with pulse of rebel blood, no fucking fear, just scorn of death.
There is no more my shattered life just one more mile I'm closer to my fate.

I drive to horizon, like a distant falling star that's waiting for you,
piercing the skyline i outrun, just one more mile I'm closer to my fate
