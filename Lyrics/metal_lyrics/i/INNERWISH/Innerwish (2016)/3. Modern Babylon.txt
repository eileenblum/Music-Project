Black Or White
Left Or Right
Religious Or Non-Believer
Under Same Skies We Were Born

In Every Choice
In Crossroad's Dwell
Decay Was A Deceiver
Guiding The Flock To A Land Forlorn

Slaying The WorldâBlindfold And Full Of Envy
Change The CourseâLeave Immensity To Lead The Way

We Stand United Or Fall
Hear The Cry Of Mankind
Repent Or Crawl
We Stand United Or Fall
Burning Times Upon Us
Modern Babylon
We Stand United Or Fall
One Can Start A Wave To Carry Us All
Through The Fire And Flames Of Today
To A New Shore
We Stand United Or Fall

Rational Eyes
Revise The Lies
Feeding The Growing Deception
What Was Pure Now Asks Of You To Feel

Mountains And Seas
History's Seeds
Powerful, Majestic And Timeless
Spinning As They Fade Cause Of Our Greed
