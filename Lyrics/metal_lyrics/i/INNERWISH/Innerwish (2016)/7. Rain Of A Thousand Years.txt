Silence Reigns The Iron Hill
Forged With Sacrifice
Through Centuries Of Pain, Grief And Cries

Unknowing, You're An Enemy
To Kith And Kin In Death
Beneath The Earth And In This Life's Dwell
[Quote From "Oedipus The King" by Sophocles]

Salvation
Redemption
Know Thyself And Rise
Salvation
Redemption
Eagle Flies

Pride
Lost In The Whirl Of Time
Souls
Still Linger In Twilight
Altar Of Freedom Filled With Cries
Rain
Of Thousand Years Of Might
Wash
Away Our Sins And Crimes
Dissolve The Haze From Our Eyes

Free Besieged From Our Own Selves
Imprisoned By Denials
The Rails Once Broke, But Hope Was Killed By Liars

A Mother's Tear Dressed In Blood
A Father's Silent Cry
Still Echo In The Wind And Haunt The Sky
