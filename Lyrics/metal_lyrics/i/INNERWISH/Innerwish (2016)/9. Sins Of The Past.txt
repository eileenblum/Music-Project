Born In This Life
With The Burden Of An Unknown Fate
It's Not Us To Blame, But Complicit We'll Be
With Apathy

We're Feeling That None
Cannot Hear A Word That We Say
So Decadent Lies
Our Generation's Pace

But Now
We're Reaching The End Of The Line
No Fear, But Will To Survive
The Time Has Now Come For Us To Decide
What Else Can We Do But To Try?

We're The Children Of A Lesser God
The Ones To Guide You Across The Dark
Set For The Stars, The Future's Lust
All On Our Shoulders
We Pay
The Sins Of The Past

Watching The Sands
From The Hourglass Now Slipping Away
It's Either We Thrive
Or Abandon Our Dreams And World In Flames

Now We Must Stand
On Our Feet, Make Our Choice With No
Complains
We Have To Believe
In Tomorrow's Dawn Of Change
