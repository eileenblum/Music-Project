I'm Lost And Absorbed, My Powers Abate
Despair And Agony Are Driving Me Insane
Wanna Bring Me Under? Wanna Mess My Brain?
No More You Will Defy Me - Manipulate My Fate

We're Born With Rights
Enslaved We Live By Choice
Ego And Vanity Silence Our Voice
But Again, What A Hell! You Don't Seem
To Care And Stare Soulless
While They Kill Your Dreams

You Watch The Days
Turn Into Nights
Just Passing By
Don't Stand In Apathy
Don't Compromise

Your Life, Is Not What The Gamblers Oblige
Stand Up, Cause Your Pain Is Only Fear In Disguise
How Long You'll Bear Until You Realize?
You're Destined To Win
It's Time You Roll The Dice

Can You Hear What I Say?
Can You Feel The Urge?
Elusive Freedom Is A Momentary Bliss
In Your Own Microcosm
You Think You Are The King
But Take A Look Around You
You're Just A Pawn They Shift
