Running Fast On A One Way Lane
All This Rush For A Life So Hollow
Where's The Essence And What Is The Price?
Where Do We Go?

Fragile Dreams Made Of Misleading Needs
Deify All These New Messiahs
Disillusion And Reality
Mocking Me

But Tonight
I Will Cleanse And Lift Higher
For In Life
There Is More To Embrace

We Hide A Sigh
Under The Moonlit Sky
Unstrained, Unbound
Searching For Zero Ground
We Shelter Our Eyes
Embrace The Morning Light
The Dawn Will Sound
Renaissance From Zero Ground

Stand In Line
Wait For Your Turn
Say Your Number, Forget Your True Name
Breathe The Air Of Feelings Lost
For So Long

Trapped Inside Walls Of Demand
Corridors Of Some Cheap Desires
Searching Just For A Thread To Escape
And Walk Away
