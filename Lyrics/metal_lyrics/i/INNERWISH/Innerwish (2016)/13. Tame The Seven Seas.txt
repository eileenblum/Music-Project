When I was a child
You opened your arms
And found serenity

And as a grown man
Needing just a friend and brace
You were always there for me

Now you're gone
In painted skies you fly
In distant shores you roam

But even the flow of time
Didn't fade your face away
I still feel you guiding - march my own

And I know you hid
All your fears from me to see
Up to your last act
You had one more lesson for me

I have to make it on my own
In my dreams I still see you
Set sails against the wind
To navigate with grace
And tame the seven seas
I close my eyes and linger
Drift by the tailwind
Along we navigate
And tame the seven seas

I recollect
Moments we had side by side
Silently I bow and cry

So many words unsaid
All those feats I did myself
Just by following your steps with bless

Now I am the one
Who hides his fears inside
In my darkest times
I know you will be by my side
