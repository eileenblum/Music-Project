Here I Stand
Broken Man
On The Edge Of Life
Wandering
Through A Land
With No Sun To Light
All My Darkened Memories
My Forgotten Smiles
What Is This That I've Become
I Might Have Failed, But Tried

Castaway From Tidal Dreams
I Humble Lie Down On My Knees

I Raise My Hands
And Pray For Someone
To Reanimate My Life
Abandon Sorrow
And Guide Me At My Last Fight
I Turn My Eyes
Resist My Demons
The Mirror Never Lies
Reflects Salvation
Myself I Have To Find

All Alone
Face The Cold
Emptiness Inside
Lost My Kingdom
Lost My Soul
A Crownless King Am I
Feeling Tired
Time To Go?
And Leave It All Behind
Weakness Now Has Overcome
No Will, No Guts, No Pride
