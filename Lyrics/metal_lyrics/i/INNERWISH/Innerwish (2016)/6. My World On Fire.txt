Looking Back I'm Watching Silent
Faded Pictures Of My Life
There's The Angel, There's The Beast And There's The Harlot
Changing Forms, That With All I Identify

Futile Search, For An Alibi
Paralyzed, As I Keep Connive

I Set My World On Fire
For All The Dreams I Left Undone
I Set My World On Fire
But I Won't Burn This Final Chance
Ablaze My Eleventh Hour
I Just Forgot Who I Am
I Break Down My Inner Liar
And Seize My Life

Blaming All, But Never Concede
Claims, But With No Will To Face
My Obligations, My Ephemeral Sensations
For Wasted Time, Is It Me The One To Hate?
