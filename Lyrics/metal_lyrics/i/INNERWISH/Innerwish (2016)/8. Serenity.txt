In Seductive Mist
I'm In Your Hands
Like A Helpless Child
Under Your Commands
But You Won't Bring Me Down

Cause You're Hiding Yourself Under Those Mystic Eyes
Enchant With Haunting Melodies
Crumbled By The Power Of The Gods
You'll Have To Desist

It's The Yearn To Revive
And Return To Light
Deception Cannot Veil My Dream
I'll Be Trialed But In Time
I'll Find Serenity
It's The Need To Survive
To Regain What Was Mine
And Return Where My Heart Doesn't Bleed
Find Shelter In Time
Embrace Serenity

Terrified Like A Child
I Walk In The Dark
But The Eager For Return
Enlightens My Path
