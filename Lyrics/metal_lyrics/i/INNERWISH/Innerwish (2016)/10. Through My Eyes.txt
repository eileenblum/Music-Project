There Are Times
You're Feeling Lost
Trapped In A Maze Of Thoughts
Alone You Roam
And Tremble As You Sear

Maybe I'm The One To Take Your Hand
And Walk You Through This Sombre Path
That Without Restrain
You Have To Cross To Calm

Maybe I'm A Dreamer
Of Things Undone
But Aren't You The Ruler?
Of Your Own Heart?

Why Can't You See Through My Eyes
Meet Your Wonder
Break The Chains
Of Stagnation
Try And See Through My Eyes
With Broken Wings
You Cannot Fly
Just Believe
And Reach The Sky Through My Eyes

There's A Light, The One You'll Find
To Comfort You And Heal Your Scars
The Road Of Change
Is Vast But Full Of Stars

Now It's Time To Free Your Mind And Soul
Cause The Best Things Are Meant To Come
Lean On Your Feet
This Is Your Swanlike Dance
