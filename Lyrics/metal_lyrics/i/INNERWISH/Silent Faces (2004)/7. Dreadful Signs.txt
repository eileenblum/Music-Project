Deep in your mind something strange
growing faster tonight
Your dying emotions 
review all the dreams you recited. 
You'll never forget all these things
that left you betrayed
Your innocent face now has turned 
into a masquerade of hate.

Born to love, an unworthy form.
Born to walk for ever alone

We hide the fear, and nobody reckons the consequence.
The crawling years will always be there in our minds
We hide the fear, end when pressure 
is growing we face.
These deadly signs, the dreadful signs of our lives

The promises broke but the images
still punish your mind.
The tears in your eyes testify
that your patience has died.
Your thoughts have revealed,
there is nothing to feel, only pain.
Your innocent face now 
has turned into a masquerade of hate.

You are staring alone, with eyes full of dread&amp;
With eyes full of rage
