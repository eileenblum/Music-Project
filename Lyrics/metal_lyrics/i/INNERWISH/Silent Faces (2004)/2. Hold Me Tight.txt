I run, run through the night
Feeling the wind as it blows
I ride, a stranger in time
Live on my own.
My heart, is straining too much
I'm just breathing through this chance
As time is killing time I'm approaching a dream
And tasting the sun from the ground
I feel it rising again restless and bold

My eyes, full of desire
Blink at the holy gates
I glide to reach out to the paths
Out of my brain
My life is rolling too fast
I've never felt so strong
Travel with me to the land of delight
Follow me when the night comes down
Just let your senses and touch
The afterlife

[CHORUS:]
Just hold me tight
With the wings of an angel tonight
Even now that I'm afraid of lies
Blazing the night
Come to term the Afterlife
Just hold me tight
With the wings of an angel tonight
Even now that I'm afraid of time
Blazing the night
Come to term the after life
