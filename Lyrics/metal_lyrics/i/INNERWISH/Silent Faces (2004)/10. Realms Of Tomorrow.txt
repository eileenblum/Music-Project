Feeling the heat of this impulsive youth
Engulf your words before learning the truth
Cover my skin with a sense of desire.
Avoiding the price of your mind
Leaving for nothing but hoping for all.
Use the compassion so easy and cold.
Ponder suspicions of join and calm 
But there is nowhere here to hide......

Into the realms of tomorrow I will go
I'll create a dream to touch the face of God

Just give me time, give me the reason,
To recall bring me the essence of your soul
Give me the reason to relieve with a several hope.
Give me time, give me the reason
To recall bring me the essence of your soul
Give me the reason to relieve with a several hope
For the realms of tomorrow we hold on...

Tension enfold me when the sun hits the ground
And scenes of my lifetime would never resound
Pictures have changed I'm not so confined
I drained you out of me and I feel fine.
Walking exempt from my desolate days
I've buried your memories of sorrow and grace
Hide through the dark, cause I'm turning back,
just lay down your soul and run...
