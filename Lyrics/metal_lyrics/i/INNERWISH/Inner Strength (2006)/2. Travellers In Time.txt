Come to my dream and live in the past
Away from the daily confusion
Where things they are so peaceful and calm
Away from the madness that we are

Let's follow our hearts and run to our final destination
Discover the things that we have left behind

Travellers, all we are travellers in time
Travellers, a trip to nowhere till we die
Travellers, all we are travellers in time
Cause life is short no matter how we try

A magic light is calling us back
To dive into our imagination
A sparking throb is showing us the path
To enter the channels of time.

Let's follow our hearts and run to our final destination
Get all the things that we lived and left behind
