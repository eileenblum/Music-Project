For years I was trying to find out who I really am
Lost inside my memories that were tearing me apart
I was walking down an empty road with tears in my eyes
Trapped inside my lonely world and chained from the past

You've always been afraid to face the cruelty of this world
Trying to stand on your feet and scream against all odds
Standing on a crossroad and can't choose which way to go
Longing for a helping hand to make you carry on

You know that I will never let you down
I will always be beside you and hold you tight
Never let the people hurt you and never let you cry
You know that I will never let you down
I will always be beside you and hold you tight
Never let you feel alone and always make you smile
For all eternity I'll be your shining star

Lets forget the things that were holding us apart
Wasted years that gone by and never coming back
Now we are together we can make it, so lets try
I don't want to see again this sadness in your eyes
