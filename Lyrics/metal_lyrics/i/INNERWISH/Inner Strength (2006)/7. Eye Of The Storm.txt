The moon is watching over me
Stars are spying silently
The night calls out my name
Born to fight, to change the world
Hearts so warm but eyes are cold
Steps straight across the road

Always alone, against myself against the world
Passion rules my lonely way.

In the eye of the storm
I'm living day by day
In the eye of the storm
Always live in the eye??

Fairy tales sometimes are real
Wounds are difficult to heal
But there is no turning back
Many times tried to forgive
Never stopping to believe
We are made for sins

In the eye of the storm
I'm living day by day
In the eye of the storm
There is nothing left to say
In the eye of the storm
Always stand in the eye??
