Don't you see that we are wanderers?
Don't you feel that we are lost out and cry?
All our dreams turned to shadows
We filled our lives with pain and lies

But I can show you a way
I can show you my own promised land
In a place where together can build a new world
For you and I

For ever and ever let's follow the signs
Together for ever and reach for the sky

We sail far away Far away straight to the stars
We sail far away Far away for a new start

Now we are living our dream
Where we share and we no longer cry
All the questions have answers
And we filled our lives with love and pride

And we can show you the way
To the place that is existing at last
In a land where together
Can build a new world
For you and I
