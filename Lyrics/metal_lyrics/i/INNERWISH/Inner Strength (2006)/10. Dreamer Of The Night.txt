All my life I was trying to be myself
Holding on to the dreams that we've both shared
Always believe, never repent

And day by day, I'm working hard hanging on a hope
Holding on, feeling anxious to go on
Into this world that sunk beyond

But every night I ease my mind
Where silence rules desires and dreams are know alive

Dreamer of the night
Gazing at the burning sky
Dreamer of the night
Setting free my desperate mind

All these fears all these nightmares haunt my way
Solitude is a price I have to pay
I'm standing so week in front of my fate

Now I know that my heart can't stand for long
I'm burning on and my mouth can't speak a word
Break into tears and sing alone
