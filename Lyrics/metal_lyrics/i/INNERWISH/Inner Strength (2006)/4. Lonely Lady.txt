This is the challenge of a lifetime, lifetime
I saw her standing in the cold, twilight
She is never been in love
She always gave it all away

Lonely Lady, Lonely lady, lady on my mind

This is no ordinary love affair, love affair
Her memories she tries to hide, inside of her
She is never been in love
She always gave it all away

I give her everything and all my love - all my love
This is a perfect chance to show - all of them
She is never been in love
She always gave it all away
