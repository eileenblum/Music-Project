We are lost in a time
Where darkness rules in an endless fear
And only the strong will survive, so watch out

Trapped in a circle
Moving round and round until we fall
Spiting venom, breathing fire.

Salvation under the price of pain â we are sinners
We are sinners. we'll never find our own Salvation

We seek and destroy, to feed our vanity
It's the final prophecy

Gazing the fire
And failed to see that life is too short
In a burning path we have to cross, so look out

Blind by the anger
Possessed by the daemons of our fears
Deliver the dark horsemen to rule the haunted years

Accused for our sins
Damnation till the end of time
In the eternal flames of hell
We'll get our souls burned
