[Music: Krisko, Tsigkos/ Lyrics: Tsigkos]

I see your shadow in the night
I hear your whispers
An empty life
Your face is haunting
All my dreams
A sorrow's path in front of me
A lonely running
No place to hide all these fears

Can't resist, let me live
Conceal yourself in darkness
I must fight
And relight my soul fire again

Burning desires
Life's full of liars
Burning desires
All we are just victims of our fate?

I remember all those worlds you've said
Like waves that drown me
A shining blade your eyes
Tear the world apart

In obscurity I'm lost
A falling empire
Help me my lord to carry on
