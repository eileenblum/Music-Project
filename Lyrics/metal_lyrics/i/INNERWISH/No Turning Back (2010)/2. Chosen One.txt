[Music: Krisko, Tsigkos/ Lyrics: Tsigkos]

It's the darkest times 
To conquer all the flaming skies
Don't hide away, it's now or never

Red alarm it screams
Follow just your heart and dreams
In your life there's no surrender

Fly like an eagle tonight
Open your wings and lead us to light
Show us the rainbow again
Together we'll stand at the end

Don't be afraid it's your sacred time
Don't let your fears haunt your way
Fight for all
You have the strength of god
You are the holy man
The chosen one

Fire storm is closing in
A higher voice pushes you in
Don't run away, you must believe

Lonely road ahead this night
Lord of truth will be the guide
Eternity is the inner wish
