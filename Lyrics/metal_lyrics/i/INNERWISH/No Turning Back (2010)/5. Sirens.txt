[Music: Krisko, Tsigkos/ Lyrics: Tsigkos]

As the night's falling fast
And the sky is full of stars
They arrived from the unknown
From a land far beyond

They were seeking for blood
Holy war just begun - Stand and fight
It's the time to live or die

Hear the children's war cries
Feel the madness the reigns
You are alone in the dark
Soul hunters are back

All raise your swords
It's the end far or near
Carry on lead the way to the light

The sirens
They are calling your name
The sirens
There is no time to pray

Sacred fire burns your heart
Marching now full of lust
It's the call or the fate
Don't stay still, don't be late

Flaming path cross the line
God just give us a sign. Stand and fight
It's the time to live or die

Hear the children's war cries
Feel the madness the reigns
You are alone in the dark
Soul hunters are back

All raise your swords
It's the end far or near
Carry on lead the way to the light

The sirens
They are calling your name
The sirens
There is no time to pray
