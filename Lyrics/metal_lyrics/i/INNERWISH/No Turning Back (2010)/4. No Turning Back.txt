[Music: Alexandropoulos, Krisko, Tsigkos/ Lyrics: Alexandropoulos]

The earth is shaking, clouds in the sky
We feel the savage threat that warns us
We hear it coming, from far beyond
So it is written. So it must be done
Mankind is trembling, the fear of death
A hostile voice forecasts our future

Unworthy people, what you've done
You have dissolved your own lives

Trapped inside your sins
Rulers of the earth
Your punishment will come
Now it's time to pay
You should realize
That there is no turning back

Last hope died, the end is near
The judgment day approaches, so beware
No Christ can save us, no moan, no god
No exit from this living nightmare
Rape of nature is the crime
We've sentenced ourselves to death forever!

Unworthy people, what you've done
You have dissolved your own lives
