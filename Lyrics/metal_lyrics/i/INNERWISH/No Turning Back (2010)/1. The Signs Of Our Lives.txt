[Music: Krisko/ Lyrics: Alexandropoulos]

Midnight strikes again
Floating on my sea of past
Alone and helpless in the dark
Lies that burn my soul
Will never let trust again
Those snakes that ruin my life before

But I have to try
Look up to the sky

The signs of our lives
The seeds of our lust
Are helping us all to remember our past
The signs of our lives
The feelings we have
Are leading us all
Till the end of our time

Compassion, sympathy and love
But I say ignorance it was
Tearing the bottom of my heart

Now I have a heart of stone
No one can control me like before
I'm ready to survive
