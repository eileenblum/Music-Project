When I'm sad, I never turn down 
my head to the ground, never surrender
but with a smile at take a look at the sky.
Don't you know, that if you walk in a lonely road
You'll never end it, so take my hand,
together we'll ride on tonight

down into the streets
the fire still burns and everything is rotting
Find your broken wings, rise up again
Always believe and hoping.

Just when you'll dream
You'll see an angel calling
and'whispering deep into you soul

Carry your cross.

Run and fight, for what you thing
that is wrong or right to make things better
just believe and some one will show you the way.
Fight for all, even if you are about to fall
don't ever stop it.
Heaven wing at last will take you away.
