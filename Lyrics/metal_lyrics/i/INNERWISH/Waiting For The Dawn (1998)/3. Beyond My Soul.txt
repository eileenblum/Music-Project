Get away from the oddity, fade away
Hide you self in the golden rain
Once again we should wonder
Is it worth avoiding any hue of pain?

And our fortune is witness
Of a rainbow smile.
Will it make the difference
And take care of our desperate mind?

In this land of insanity
If we could find some relief and delight
Boren enough of the routine's tide
I'm sick of my peaceful side.

Now I'm searching for madness
An un-earthly desire
Just dismantle the sadness
Recreate the human kind.

With the first days of the dawn
I'll have the chance to stay alone
And by the sunset I will go
And I'll try to find world that's sunk
beyond.......the gates of my soul.
