Walking alone once again by the shore
A coast where I've wondered for years
Here is a spring for my soul
A home where I cover my tears

My steps break the numbness
Moon looks silent and pale
Darkness deluges my cave
Wolves scream at me on sight
They are always awake in the night

A sparking flame invades my brain
Tonight grief wont destroy our game
My elusive dream now escapes from the sleep
A restless vision joins my fool-moon trip

As you wait for my sign
keep you right frame of mind
your mouth can't avoid a lie
You break into tears
Betraying your most inner fears
Try to make up you mood
Was I misunderstood
Our fates now are truing to drawn
Life seems so sort
So don't close your eyes to the dawn.

A sparking flame invades my brain
Tonight grief wont destroy our game
My elusive dream now escapes from the sleep
A restless vision joins my fool-moon trip

Wait for the dawn
When you search in the dark all along
Wait for the dawn
When you are trying to find the unknown
Wait for the dawn
