Take a look at the sun
And you'll see what is been done
Feel the mystery of love
A different life now begins
And the believer wins
found the secrets of God

Lord of truth I'm begging
Listen to my prayer
Take the clouds that
Are hiding my way

I know that your words
Could not be betrayed
So grace me and bless
To be strong for the day

Take a look at the sea
For a little be free
Beauty and mist what you'll see
Touch my heart with a song
And for ever be strong
Finding where you belong
