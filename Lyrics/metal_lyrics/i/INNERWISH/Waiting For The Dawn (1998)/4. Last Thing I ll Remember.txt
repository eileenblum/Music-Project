Deep inside I feel you missing
Like a fading ray.
Like all the thing that I have trusted
You hide you self away

I've had enough of those nights full of lies
I'm on the way to find new walks of life

Scars of hate to me are growing
All around my place
As the strangers pass beside me
Looking to my face 

I've had enough of those nights full of lies
I'm on the way to find new walks of life

Cause every night I know
How to sing alone
For I can feel for ever what is pain.
When you'll see me again
Never call me friend
Last thing I'll remember is your name.

Now it seems the night is calling
Passing thought my door.
With my spirit living only
Born to walk alone
