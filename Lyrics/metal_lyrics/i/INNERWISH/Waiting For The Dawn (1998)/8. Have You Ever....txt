One more day passed behind
Promises inside my mind
As the lights fades away I'm alone
Feeling come like old waves
Then the clock trucks twelve
And my self fights to swallow the pain.

Have you ever heard and angel cry
Have you ever tried to touch my mind
Have you ever heard a single word that I say
Word that means a lot of thing to me
Have you ever tried just to be here by my side
Help me find my self a place to hide

One last chance left to try
Find paths towards the sky
Waste the fear cause the sorrow is blind.
I am anxious to feel and I'm dying to forgive
You are the one in whom I could believe.
