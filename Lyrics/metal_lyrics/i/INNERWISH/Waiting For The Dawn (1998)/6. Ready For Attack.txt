We're marching with last
From another world below
And no one dare to close our ways.

The enemy awaits,
But we're never turning back
This battle takes our fears away.

Standing in the fields we take an oath.
A debt of honor to the swords we hold.

Hearts ready for attack
Time to raise your fist against the wind
Hearts ready for attack, be ready for attack.

The power we have, is a never ending flame
Our freedom and our faith we claim.
The tyrants above will surrender in our force
And they will not forget this day.
