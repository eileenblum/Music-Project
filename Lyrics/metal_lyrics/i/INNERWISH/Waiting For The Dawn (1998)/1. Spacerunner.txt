Signs come above the air
As we seek for our future ways
Sail far beyond the stars
There you'll find your expecting days.

Days painted black down on earth
We recall since our birth
We were given no hope
At last we are ready to go.

Spacerunner

Face you eternal dream
Break the cell of your boiling fears
No trace, move with out a trace
From the past there is no time for tears

Days painted black down on earth
We recall since our birth
We were given no hope
At last we are ready to go

Take a ride to the sun
Tasting space as you run
From this lie now you are gone
Find the place we belong

The place where we belong
Is far beyond the stars,
Spacerunner....
