Waiting for something that I never saw
I heard it screaming a long time ago.
There is a fire and there is a flame.
And like a siren it calls my name.

In the waves of destiny I fall
The judgment sound awakes my soul

Spending my life time yet never been told
What is the purpose of this world
Until the day that I loved and I cried
Why am I searching now for the reason.
Why?

In the waves of destiny I fall
The judgment sound awakes my soul

Screams, I've been hunted for so long
Everyway I've touched and every where I've gone
Time. Time is hunting on and on
Now my soul is flying to reach out to the final door.
