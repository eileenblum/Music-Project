How can I stay safe in this world?
Discord divides us
What's going on?

I don't want to live this way!
I can't stand anymore give me a break!

Human instinct killing and exploiting
Can't you see? We're all manipulated

I don't want to be part of this shit
Where lives are stolen by the greediness

The leader of us
Could make this a better world
Leading us
To share our wealth
The leader of us
Could make this a better world
Teaching us
Benevolence for progression

There's no apology
For the hungry in Africa
Developed countries
Just spending resources

Social inequalities in least developed countries
Undernourishment is on the rise
Low life expectancy
Crimes against humanity deliberately committed you see
