Sweet fallen angel, come to me,
Let my embrace set you free.
Let my blade take away your pain,
For you and I are one and the same.

Let me weave the dreams you dream,
Let me kiss away your tears.
Let me hold you as you sleep,
Let me take your soul to keep.
Let me take your soul to keep.

Iâll cradle you through endless sleep.
Iâll stroke your brow through endless sleep.
Iâll hold you close through endless sleep.
Iâll kiss your lips through endless sleep.
