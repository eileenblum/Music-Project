Gone, he is never coming back,
Gone, the sky has turned an inky black.
Gone, the world's become an empty place,
Gone, now I'll never see his face.

Gone are his eyes of brown,
Gone is his wrinkled frown.
Gone is the smell of musk,
Gone is the thrill of morning lust, now he'sâ¦

Gone, there's a hollow in the bed,
Gone, now I wish that he were dead.
Gone, are the days he spent with me,
Gone, now that I am finally free.

Gone are his desperate pleas,
Gone, when he was on his knees.
Gone, the hollow "I love you"'s
Gone, the never-ending blues, now he's gone. 

Gone, the bell has tolled it's final peal,
Gone, was our love so very real?
Gone, the crow has called it's sorry song,
Gone, now the man is truly long gone.

Gone is the golden dawn,
Gone are his looks of scorn,
Gone is the misery.
Gone, the times he laughed at me,
Gone, the threats of suicide,
Gone, my hope to be his bride.
Gone, the throes of ecstasy,
Gone, all the jealousy, now he's gone.
