In the hot night as the moon rises higher,
He has come to quench your desire.
Here comes an angel to fan your fire,
To take you to the stars, take you higher.
Back from the days when the world was young,
Back from the days when life was fun.
It is him; he has come,
He is the Beast and he is the One.

Horns of the Goat,
Hooves of the Goat,
The fire of the Goat is in the eyes of the Goat
Hooves of the Goat,
Horns of the Goat,
The fire of the Goat is in the eyes of the Goat

In your hunger and in your lust,
He makes you do the things you must.
The red-hot flames are in your blood,
The red-hot flames of sexual love.
The god of madness will take your hand,
The god of madness lead you to the dance.
Lost in the rhythm, lost in the trance,
Lost in the fever, lost in the dance.

Across the seas, across the sand,
These are all the lands of Pan
Every fey, every woman and man,
You are all the babes of Pan.

In the eyes of the Goat,
Is the fire of the Goat.
