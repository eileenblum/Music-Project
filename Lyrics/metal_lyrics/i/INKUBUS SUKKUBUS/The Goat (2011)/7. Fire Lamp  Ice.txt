Electric storm in the summer sky
On the wings of love in a dream we fly
Forever lost on the turning tide
Who can save us, save for you and I

Fire and ice, fire and thunder
All the world will watch and wonder
Watch and wonder
At the summer sky

Apagan pulse in the forest glade
Into the green our souls shall fade
My nature child of the night
With lips that burn and eyes of fire
