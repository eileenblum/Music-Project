Two broken angels against the storm,
Alone together beneath the electric sky.

Two star-crossed lovers in the night,
With you I'm born again, and love is blind.
It's been so long, so very long,
A myriad stars alight when we are one.

Two star-crossed lovers in the night,
Liquid fire runs through my burning heart.
We rise together in the night,
With you I'm born again and love is blind.

It's been a million years,
I've cried a billion tears.
With you, with you, Melancholy Blue.

The fates have bound our souls as one,
My love, together we are a flame divine.
The dice are cast, the cards are turned,
For life eternal, I'm yours and you are mine.

It's been a million years,
I've cried a billion tears.
With you, Melancholy Blue.

Melancholy Blue.
Melancholy Blue.
Melancholy Blue.

It's been a million years,
I've cried a billion tears.
With you, with you, Melancholy Blue.

It's been a million years,
I've cried a billion tears.
With you, with you, Melancholy Blue.

Underneath the stars above,
You and I, my only love.
Drag me down, my fallen angel,
Fall for you, my fallen angel.

Fallen angel, fallen angel,
Falling, falling, fallen angel.
Fallen angel, fallen angel,
Falling from the sky, from the sky, from the sky, from the sky.
