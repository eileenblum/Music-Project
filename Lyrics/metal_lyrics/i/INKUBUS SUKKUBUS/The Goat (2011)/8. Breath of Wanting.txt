Breath of wanting
Leave my body
Breath of yearning
Leave me empty

How cold is the stroke of your icy fingers

Lungs of fire
Fight no longer
Spare the fury
Release what life you have inside

So sweet is the stroke of your icy fingers
How warm was the breath that you took from me

Heart of fury
Beat no longer
Why so defiant?

How cold is the stroke of your icy fingers
How sweet was the love that you gave
How cold is the stroke of your icy fingers
How sweet was the love that you gave to me
