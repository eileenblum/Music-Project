From old Rome they come a-riding
On a song with armour shining
Christian sons with hearts of anger
Bring the book, the cross, the chancre
Hallelujah, hallelujah, kiss the cross or they will burn you
Hallelujah, hallelujah, they have come to rape and murder

Tell them we've had it all
They've had their day now they shall fall
Tell them of the turning tide
They can run but they can't hide

Across a sea of tears and blood
Across a scape of murdered babies
They will cleanse and purify
For their Christ and for their Lady
They will take the joy of love and
name it as a badge of shame
They will steal and they will plunder
They will tell you you're to blame

On the wheel and on the gibbet
Broken bodies, broken dreams
In the churches, the sheep, the traitors
Now they are both pure and clean
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
