[Rolling Stones Cover]

I see a red door, and I want it painted black,
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black,
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes,
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.

I see a line of cars, and they're all painted black,
With flowers and my love, both never to turn back,
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away,
Like a newborn baby it just happens every day.

I look inside myself and see my heart is black,
I see my red door and must have it painted black,
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts,
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue,
I could not foresee this thing happening to you.

I want it black, as black as night,
As black as coal, as black as death,
I wanna see the sun blotted out in the sky.

I want it painted painted painted, painted black, yeah.

I want it black, black as coal,
As black as ice, as black as death,
I wanna see the sun, blotted out in the sky...

I want it painted...
