Herne, Herne, Herne, Herne!
Come with bright eyes a-flashing
Come with your dark hounds crashing
Come rend the sky asunder
Come with the rain and thunder
Break all that lies before you
Take all that dies around you
Ride with the Hounds of Hell
Fly with the Hounds of Hell
Take me to the Wild Hunt
Break me with the Wild Chase
Take me with the Wild Hunt
Take me riding wildly with the Wild Hunt now
In darkest green you move now
With oak and ash and thorn now
The cloak that's swathed around you
Denies I've finally found you
I've sought your untamed beauty
Within the hearts of men
I've found both love and cruelty
In equal parts within
Come with those bright eyes flashing
And with your hounds a-crashing
I feel I've always known you
Tho' none would ever own you
Proud Herne to ride beside you
And leave the dying day
But who knows who is hunted
And who shall be the prey?
