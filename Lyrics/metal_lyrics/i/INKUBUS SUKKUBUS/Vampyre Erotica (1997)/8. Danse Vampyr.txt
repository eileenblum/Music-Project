Oh, night of beauty, love and cruelty
Twisting, writhing bodies guiding
Love of splendour, kisses tender
Palest skin to touch surrender

Wild desire rising higher
Fragile limbs denied their power
Holding, touching, kissing, crushing
A dance before the dawn comes rushing
Fingers reaching, glances fleeting
Purest souls are slowly weakening
Screaming, crying, living, dying
Yearning breast descending, sighing
