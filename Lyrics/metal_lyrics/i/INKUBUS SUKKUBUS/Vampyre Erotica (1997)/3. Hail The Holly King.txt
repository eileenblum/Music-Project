All across the virgin snow
And through the naked trees
On a cold winter's night
His song is on the breeze
Where the moonlight paints the frost
Upon the robin's song
He's come a-calling for us all
Now the summer's gone!

Hark! Hear the children sing
Glory to the Holly King
Let the jingle bells all ring
Hail, hail the Holly King

In the whisky and in the wine
He is here this Yule-tide time
A-dancing in the home-fire flames
A-dancing, singing, playing games
When the prayers are to the East
He is with us at the feast
His crown is nailed to the door
He's with us forevermore!

Underneath the mistletoe
He is in all lover's hearts
He fans the flames of desire
'Tis he who fires Cupid's darts
He is in all children's dreams
Dressed in red or dressed in green
Riding on the astral sleigh
He's the spririt of the day!
