So much we'd learn in this age of denial
Wild Rabelaisians to teach us their pleasures
Do what you will we could all learn to live by
Though guilt and torment are our only treasures

Hell-Fire and brimstone and blasphemy be mine
Liberty reign with Sir Francis for all time
Do what you will and evour all that's divine
Hell-Fire and brimstone and blasphemy be mine

Strange tales are told of their nights filled with pleasure
Of wild excesses and boundless debauchery
I'd take irreverence and sweet Breast of Venus
If faith and wafers was all I was offered

Deny yourself and deny you are living
Deprive yourself and you'll die knowing nothing
Though some would say we are mad in His likeness
We're flesh and blood and there's so much to drink of
