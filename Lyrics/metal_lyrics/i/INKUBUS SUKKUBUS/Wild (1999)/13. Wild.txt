Child of darkness 
Child of lightness 
Child so bright that you dazzle weary cynical men 
Child of brilliance, wisdom, wildness 
We would thrill as our souls ignite when you are near us 
Wild! Wild! Passion plays a part in all you do 
Wild! Wild! Heart and soul as nothing else will do 
Live for magick 
Live for greatness 
Live for power to shape and change the never-changing 
Make a difference, bring some fire 
Light the world and our hearts and minds with inspiration 
Live for glory 
Strength and fury 
Play your part in the greater scheme of life and nature 
Show your brilliance 
Show your tolerance 
Show the beauty in doing what you will with your life
