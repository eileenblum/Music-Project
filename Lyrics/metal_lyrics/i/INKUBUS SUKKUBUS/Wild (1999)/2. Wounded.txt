You, the walking wounded 
You, the hopeless victim 
You, who craved new feelings 
Risked it all to get them 
I thought you may be stronger 
Thought your fight was greater 
When I watched you falling 
How I pitied what you were 
I could have made you whole 
instead you gave in 
Now I'll leave you lying pale and wounded 
Thought you may be worthy 
I thought your soul was brighter 
Hoped we'd share forever 
Dreamt of flying with you 
I saw you had some spirit 
Saw the spark of fire 
Tasted only water 
Left you drowning on the floor 
Barely walking wounded 
Barely walking wounded 
Wounds of apathy and 
Wounds that should have healed 
I have loved you briefly 
I have given freely 
You denied me your trust 
I shed no tears for you
