Sun-kissed and god-blessed and caressed by glorious honeyed fire 
Undressed and cherished I care less what others think of me . 
You brought the sun to my life 
Your beauty blinded me 
You brought the sun to my life 
My golden sonnet, Adonis, I love you more each day 
Your secret promise, I daren't miss what you have to say 
You brought the sun to my life 
You brought the sun to my life 
You are my Lammas song 
You are my Lammas song 
You brought the sun to my life 
And chased away the grey
You brought the sun to my life 
You are my Lammas song 
You are my Lammas song 
You are my Lammas song 
My heart's desire, your fire has scorched the greenest leaf 
My joy soars higher that's why I will always need you here 
You brought the sun to my life 
You brought the sun to my life
You are my Lammas song 
You are my Lammas song 
You are my Lammas song 
You are my Lammas song 
You are my Lammas song 
You are my Lammas song
