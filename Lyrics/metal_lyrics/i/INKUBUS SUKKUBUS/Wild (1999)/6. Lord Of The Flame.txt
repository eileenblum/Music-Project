He is coming through dust, sea and sand 
And he is coming from the Ancient Lands 
Angel of Light, and Lord of the Sacred Flame 
A liberator to free you from your shame 

Ride out and set the slaves all free 
Fill our souls with your love and with your ecstasy 

He is Osiris, and he is also Pan 
And he is god, but he is also man 
He has come from Heaven and of Earth 
A god of lust, of music and of mirth 

Ride out and set the slaves all free 
Fill our souls with your love and with your ecstasy 
Break the chains of the last two thousand years
save us from pain, save us from fear

Oh great Horned God, we have not forgotten you 
Oh great Horned God, we have not forsaken you 
Oh great Horned God, we have not denied you 
Oh great Horned God, we have not defied you
