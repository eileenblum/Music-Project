Hold my heart in your cold clenched fist and squeeze until you bleed me dry 

Take what you will of my life force and leave the pain behind 
You would take it all from me and only leave my suffering 
Why not take my hope, you demon, you are welcome to that now 
You, my idol 
You, my teacher 
You, my laughter 
You, my crying 
You, my daybreak 
You, my sunset 
You, my living 
You, my dying 
Twist the threads much tighter and to you my last breath will belong 
You will know my broken form will honour you forevermore 
I would give my life to you, my dreams, my talents are forgotten 
What a trophy to inscribe beside the ones who've gone before 
Lace your kiss with cyanide and plant it when I contradict you 
Razor-sharp are fingernails that trace a line to yielding pulse 
Shower me with useless gifts, I'll drown in insincerity 
Lover, take your love away and use it on yourself
