Eyes of Love and Eyes of Fire 
Hearts of Lust and Desire 
Dancing, jumping, laughing, raving 
Driven by a sexual craving 
Here they come with love and flowers 
With their songs and their dark powers 
Bodies naked, hot and writhing 
Belladonna wine imbibing 
Here they come datura dreaming 
Out their minds in madness screaming 
Wild spirits from the dreamworld 
Nature spirits from the dreamworld 
With the Nymphs you are free 
In the fire of ecstasy 
In a dream of sexual love 
In Hell below and Heaven above 
Boy meets nymph the sacred story 
Told again for all it's glory 
She's so wild, he can't tame her 
Sex and drugs, who can blame her 
He's the fingers, she's the matches 
She's the fire, he'll be the ashes 
He is hers for the taking 
Love is hers for the faking 
Forget the future come and kiss 
On the Poison Lips of Bliss 
Let them sing you to your death 
Let them sing you to your death
