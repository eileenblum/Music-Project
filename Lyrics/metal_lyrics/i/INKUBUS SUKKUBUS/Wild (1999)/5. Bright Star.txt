Brightest of souls shining through 
Dearest of boys, I love you 
Wrapped in my arms I would stay here with you 
You are my lifeline 
You make the stars shine 
All of my life I have waited for you 
You are the brightest star 
I love all that you are 
You are the brightest star 
My beautiful child 
Beautiful boy, I can see 
How you have brought joy to me 
The smallest thing you do captures my heart 
How I could watch all the day 
Watch how you think as you play 
You have a mind that has opened my own 
You are my bloodline 
You make the stars in heaven shine 
All of my life I have waited for you
