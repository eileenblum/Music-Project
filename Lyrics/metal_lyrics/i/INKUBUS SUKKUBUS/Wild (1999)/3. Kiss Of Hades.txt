The night is cold and filled with pain 
And a cruel wind drives home the blissful rain 
But underneath this neon light 
A dream away is paradise

Come and take the kiss of Hades 
All you gents and all you ladies 
Before you stands your liberator 
The loving god, annihilator 

The lost souls line the concrete wall 
Their blank eyes of death, they tell it all 
Of shattered dreams and ruined lives 
A dream away is paradise 

Come and take the kiss of Hades 
All you gents and all you ladies 
Before you stands your liberator 
The loving god, annihilator

In despair, he's all around
And the dark claws of hell drag you down
And death has wings and time it flies
A dream away is paradise 

Come and take the kiss of Hades 
All you gents and all you ladies 
Before you stands your liberator 
The loving god, annihilator 

Come and take the kiss of Hades 
He will save you, sorrowâs babies
Your final saviour stands before you
He will love you, heâll adore you

Come and take the kiss of Hades 
All you gents and all you ladies 
Before you stands your liberator 
The loving god, annihilator 

Come and take the kiss of Hades 
All you gents and all you ladies 
Before you stands your liberator 
The loving god, annihilator 

Come and take the kiss of Hades 
All you gents and all you ladies 
Before you stands your liberator 
The loving god, annihilator 

Come and take the kiss of Hades 
All you gents and all you ladies 
Before you stands your liberator 
The loving god, annihilator
