Smile of torment
Eyes of anger
Lips of passion
Blood hunger
A dark angel
Lust for danger
Come take my hand and Iâll lead you to madness
Claws of thunder
To drag you under
A heart thatâs burning
An evil yearning
The dark fever
Will bring you nearer
Come take my hand and Iâll lead you to madness
Fly with me into eternal night
Iâll take you up on my wings of astral light
Lust maker
Heart breaker
Soul taker
Love faker
Thirst slaker
Accumulator
Come take my hand and Iâll lead you to madness
Fly with me into eternal night
Iâll take you up on my wings of astral light
And Iâll will love you for a thousand years
Iâll take you up then drown you in your tears
