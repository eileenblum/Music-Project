Underneath a harvest moon 
Come and hear a wytches rune 
Air and water, earth and fire 
Give to me my heart's desire 
Give me love and astral flight 
Give me darkness, give me light 
Dance with fury, wild abandon 
Circle spinning round and round 
Fire burning, circle turning 
ever faster round and round 
Join your sisters and your brothers 
spin the rune and touch the ground 
Spin your wishes, spin your magick 
spin with trance-like ecstasy 
Spin desire, spiral higher 
catch your breath and all fall down 
North and south and east and west 
Let the sacred place be blessed 
In a circle, round and round 
Lift me up and take me down 
Fire bright and fire burn 
Let my wheel of fortune turn 
Show me who will love me madly 
Show his face, I'll love him gladly 
Queen of wytches, hear my call 
Come to earth to save us all 
Oh, great horned god of goats and men 
Come to earth, return again 
Let the thunder give you youth 
Let the fire give me truth 
Free my mind of senseless trivia 
Ecstasy and joy deliver
