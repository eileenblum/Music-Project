Dark'ning sky, the senses tremble 
Song of Thor's resounding rumble 
Nature holds her breath in waiting 
Calmly all anticipating 
Flee in haste or wait her coming 
Taste the sweetness of her fruit 
Salient fingers start their drumming 
Thrill now heaven's power's made loose 
Wash me, soothe me, come cleanse my mind of mundane things 
Awaken the senses, electrify my nerves and skin 
Deepening, speeding rivers racing 
Groaning roots to ground are bracing 
Her magick is the power of change 
She leaves no single thing the same 
Wing and rain and lightning change me 
Work your spell to rearrange 
Swell the rivers, drain my ego 
Bend the trees and strengthen will 
Wash me, soothe me, come cleanse my mind of mundane things 
Awaken the senses, electrify my nerves and skin
