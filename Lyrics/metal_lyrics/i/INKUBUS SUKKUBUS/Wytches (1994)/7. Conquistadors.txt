To the shores of the wild lands
Come the Christian men
With the word of their Lord God
And the plagues of another world
To take your pride and give you shame
To purify with iron and flame

They have come to slash and burn
They have come to rape the Earth
And the native people shall be their slaves
Resistors die under bullets and blades

Broken on a cross
Hangs their graven God
And all his well meant words
Are lost amongst the lies
The blood is on their hands
Those evil men from the Christian lands
They have come to slash and burn
They have come to rape the Earth
And the native people shall be their slaves
Resistors die under bullets and blades

And what of the tribal people
What do the Christians say?
For they are as the beasts
And Satan is their Lord!

The Christian Church wants blood and gold

The Christian God demands sacrifice

[2x]
They have come to slash and burn
They have come to rape the Earth
And the native people shall be their slaves
Resistors die under bullets and blades
