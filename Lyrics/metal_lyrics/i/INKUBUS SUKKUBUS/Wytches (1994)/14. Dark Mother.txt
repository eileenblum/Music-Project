The corn is high underneath the moon
And Winter comes, it seems too soon
For Time waits not for woman or man
And Death rides out across the land

Our dark mother Queen of the Night
Through Death's door guide us to the light
Through the pain set us free
Our dark mother Queen of the Night
Let us be reborn again

Now Death has come, and Death has kissed
Death's bitter song is upon the mist
The dreams of youth bring a cynical smile
But my true love shall never die

Our dark mother Queen of the Night
Through Death's door guide us to the light
Through the pain set us free
Our dark mother Queen of the Night
Let us be reborn again

The buds have blown and the flowers have gone
The once firm breasts hang wrinkled and long
The Wheel of Fate is a spinning round
The Autumn leaves are upon the ground

Our dark mother Queen of the Night
Through Death's door guide us to the light
Through the pain set us free
Our dark mother Queen of the Night
Let us be reborn again
