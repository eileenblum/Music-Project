He comes as a darkened knight
Upon the raging storm
And as an angel of love he reaps the harvest corn
He comes as a leveller to make one and all the same
His song on the western wind to deliver us from pain
Take his hand
For only he'll lead you on to the promised hand
He is the only true friend of the poor
Can you not see that only he can ever set you free
He is the only true friend of the poor
And all the kings and the queens and the generals
Dread the gaze of his eyes
But to the sick and the cold and the starving
He's a blessing in disguise
For his sweet kiss brings release
And they shall suffer no more
So they don't fear when he comes
A-knock-knock-knocking on the door
