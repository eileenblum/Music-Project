Come join with us in our rune tonight
And feel the circle spin
Let your spirit soar in the lunar light
As the Spiral Dance begins

[Chorus]
Come with us speeding through the night
As fast as any bird in flight
Silhouettes against the Mother Moon
We will be there soon

When the spinning ceases you can dance no more
Kiss the silent earth
We will tell our children of the Ancient Lore
At the moment of their birth

[Chorus]

Isis Astarte Diana Hecate Demeter Kali Inanna [repeat]

Darksome night and shining moon,
East, then south, then west, then north
Hearken to a Wytches Rune,
Hear we come to call ye forth!
Earth and water, air and fire,
Wand and pentacle, and sword,
Work ye unto our desire,
Hearken ye unto our word!
Cords and censer, scourge and knife,
Powers of the Wytches blade,
Waken all ye into life,
Come ye as the charge is made!
Queen of Heaven! Queen of Hell!
Horned hunter of the night,
Lend your power unto our spell...
ISIS ASTARTE DIANA HECTATE DEMETER KALI INANNA!
