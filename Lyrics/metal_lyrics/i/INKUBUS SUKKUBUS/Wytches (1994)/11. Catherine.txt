The bloom of youth
Shone from her lovely face
A rose against her skin
Would not seem out of place
This silent succubi
Had men enrapt in dreams
Such sweet seducers
Are never what they seem

Catherine [x16]

The rage of unloved wives
Would seal this beauty's fate
Many years of fading looks
Brought bitterness and hate
A man of god must ensure
Justice will be done
For satan dwells within
The black heart of this one

Catherine [x16]

[Gregorian chanting]

Catherine [slow x7]
Catherine [fast x12]
