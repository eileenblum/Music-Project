Can you hear the forest sing?
On a breath of damiana it calls his name
Seduced by his spirit once again
Cloven hooves beat upon the earth
He comes to us from Arcadia through the trees
The rush of his force felt upon the breeze
He comes on hooves of goat
He comes with songs that float on the wind
Let your senses know of him
Feel the earth it trembles underneath shaggy thighs
The sky is afire from his flashing eyes
If a nymph I'd follow him
Be a match for his wild carousing and bestial ways
And in the woods I too would play
