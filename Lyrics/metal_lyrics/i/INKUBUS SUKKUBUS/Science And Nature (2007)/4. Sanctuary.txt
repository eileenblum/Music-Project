They said come on in
All you women of sin
Come all you girls
All you dirty girls
Let us come and save you
Let us destroy you and degrade you
We are sisters clean and pure
And you are filthy whores

Come to us, you Magdalenes
Come to us, let us crush your dreams
And take your babies
And make you slaves
Cleanse your sins
With your tears
Surrender hope
Surrender your souls
Come to us, you Magdalenes
Come to us, come to us,
Come to us, you Magdalenes

You will never get out of here
You will die old maids in here
Come to us, Sisters of Mercy
Remember you are cheap and dirty.
