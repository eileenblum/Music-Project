Come to me now on the wings of the storm
Hear me now, come at my call
Come to me across the midnight sky
Awaken to the darkness and fly

Across the sea of space I take flight
Come to me, I need you this night
Across a million years make haste
Come to me at this time and place

Come Nightwing, my Nightwing
Take me up and save
My Nightwing, my Nightwing
Rescue me my Nightwing.

At the light of the dawn I may well be dead
So come to me now and share my bed
Time is short and I canât wait
And in a moment will be too late

Come Nightwing, my Nightwing
Take me up and save me
My Nightwing, my Nightwing
Rescue me, my Nightwing
Oh Nightwing, sweet Nightwing
Only you will do my Nightwing
My beautiful dark angel
Come to me, my Nightwing
