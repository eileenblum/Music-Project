All the riches count for nothing when Iâm holding you
All the dreams of greatness leave me when Iâm close to you
Lift me to a realm of ecstasy, I rise with you
Melting in your arms,
I know not if Iâm me or you

Come lay me down, Iâll lie with you
Iâll lie here close beside you
Come lay me down, Iâll lie with you
Weâll lie here close together now

Sweet surrender, loving you
I leave this world behind
Bold defender, you protect me when Iâm weak inside
Come raise my body, raise my spirit to a life anew
My senses numb, I need to feel that Iâm inside of you.

God of pleasure, you have taken me to fantasy
Just how complete I have become, you are the rest of me.
I need your breath to touch my skin and thrill my soul within
We may not rise again, but leaving now would be a sin.
