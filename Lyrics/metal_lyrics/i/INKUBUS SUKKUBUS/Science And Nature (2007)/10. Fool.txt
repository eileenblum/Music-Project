Was she too much to resist
Those lips a thousand others have kissed
Were you too weak at the touch of her flesh
Did you drown in her eyes of death?

You were but a fool
But now you know better
You were but a fool
Now forget her.

Were you in love with love
Did she put some fire in your blood
Did she take you to a higher place
Did her scent drive you insane?

You were but a fool
But now you know better
You were but a fool
Now forget her.

You touched her flame
And you burned
You are but a fool
With a lesson learned.
