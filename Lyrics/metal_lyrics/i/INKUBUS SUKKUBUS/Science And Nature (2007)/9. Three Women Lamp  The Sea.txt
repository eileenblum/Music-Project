She said the water had a hidden depth where monsters lay
She said she knew theyâd drag her to death beneath the spray
What fearsome creatures would envelope her, she only knew
But die she would, a tragic victim and a martyr too.

Sister united, sisters divided by the sea

She said she had a fear the sea would take her breath from her
Itâs all-pervading flow would fill her lungs without a care
As useless limbs betray her weakened by the oceanâs might
Sheâd slip away beneath the blue into the endless night

Sisters united, sisters divided by the sea

I said I feared the blackness feared the things I couldnât see
Of water black as in, a blackness to infinity
Iâd gaze for hours with a fear but with a longing too
To disappear completely and to live a life anew

Sisters united, sisters divided by the sea.
