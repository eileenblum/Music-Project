You have really shed your skin
And now Iâve seen the demon within
Youâve changed, I donât know where to begin
Thereâs fire in your eyes and hooves on every limb

Creature stripped of all feeling
Beast without sense of meaning
Demon, now I know your name.

My love is threatened by this cruel revelation
Your eyes reveal a kind of twisted elation
I sense the beast within your skin is starting to tire of its patience
And my pure soul will feel a new and sweet degradation

Creature stripped of all feeling
Beast without sense of meaning
Inner you is so revealing
Common sense is less appealing
Demon, now I know your name

Wait, I recognise your sin
And fate has brought us back together again
Iâd changed, kicked out my humour and my demon friend
Thereâs not a moment to lose, my demon soul needs nurturing

Creature stripped of all feeling
Beast without sense of meaning
Outer layers are so appealing
Lift me to a higher ceiling

Creature stripped of all feeling
Beast without sense of meaning
Inner you is so appealing
Common sense is less appealing
Demon, now I know your name.
