You said you wanted life, you died on me
You said you wanted truth, you lied to me
You said you wanted health, youâre sick again
You said you wanted me, then bedded men

You and your Catholic taste
I think itâs such a waste
Why donât you concentrate
And choose what you want before itâs too late

You said your god has horn and died for you
You wear a crucifix and pentagram too
Youâve tried so many drugs, your spiritâs pure
Youâre wilder than the wind, yet so demure

You said youâve royal blood and common touch
Your roots are working class but donât show much
You hang out with the boys, the girls love you
You love expensive toys, youâre spiritual too

Youâre living other lives, ainât yours enough?
Youâre someone I despise â you try too much
You talk and talk for hours â I turn to dust
Youâre losing all your powers â you turn to rust
