I was wooed in the wagon of a Massey F'son
My daddy used to holler and the fella he'd run
Brother did whatever he could
Drink a jar of Jasper's
Bag a brace of rabbits with stone and wood

Gypsies, tramps and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town, 
They'd call us
Gypsies, tramps and thieves
When late at night all the bikers came around
We send 'em back to town

There once was a bloke who owned a Capri
Sideburns and flares, he was learning Tai Chi
Said he'd take me to a sacred land
I was young and restless
Got as far as Weston and passed out on the sand

Gypsies, tramps and thieves
We'd hear it from the people of the town, 
They'd call us
Gypsies, tramps and thieves
When late at night all the men would come around
And get our trolleys down

That long summer was a whirl of madness on the wild
Weston shore
We played bingo and the one-armed bandits
And I'm sure he took me for a whore
I really should have shown him the door

She was born in the wagon of a Massey F'son
I began to holler and the fella he ran 
I just did whatever I could
Drank a jar of Jasper's
Probably much more than a mother should
