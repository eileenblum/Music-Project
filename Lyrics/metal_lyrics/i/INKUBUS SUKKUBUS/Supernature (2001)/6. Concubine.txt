You call my name and I will come
A precious gift to be undone
A willing harlot for your pleasure
Day or night, I am the one
To tend your needs and offer solace
Soothe you to affirm your greatness
Love you as you were Adonis
Light the flame of tenderness

Oh, favoured concubine
Lift the veil and my will shall be thine

I will be still and not complain
Give up my will into the flame
Anoint your brow with oil of rose
Accept that Law is what you say
A son and heir is all I wish
To keep me from the dark abyss
A barren womb would seal my fate
So with a prayer I leave my kiss

Oh, favoured concubine
Lift the veil and my will shall be thine
Oh, favoured concubine
You think I'm yours, but you're already mine
Oh, favoured concubine
Come to me, the holy and divine
Oh, favoured concubine
Lift the veil and my will shall be thine
Oh, favoured concubine
You think I'm yours, but you're already mine
