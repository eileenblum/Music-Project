He's the one who the people trust
But his evil heart is filled with lust
From the pulpit he is preaching
The law of God he is teaching
With a smile and sweating palms
He is there with open arms
Wit his prayers and with hit psalms
It takes a priest to unleash the beat

Can you see him, can you smell him
Can you see through his web of lies
Can you hear him, can you sense him
Can you read his dirty mind?

He will blame you for his sin
The devil without, and the devil within
From his lair they call a church
He has the power to pervert
He the right to rape and bugger
For God the Father, and Mary the Mother
In Christ's name he shall pervert
It takes a priest to unleash the beast

Can you see him, can you smell him
Can you see through his web of lies
Can you hear him, can you sense him
Can you read his dirty mind?
Can you feel him, do you fear him
Do you know the preacher man
Do you love him or despise him
Does your flesh creep at his touch?

He's the hunter, and you're the prey
And the Sweet Lord Jesus shall lead the way
In his guilt he shall despise you
Victimize, then sodomise you
In the fever of his lust, he will turn your faith into dust
The Siren of Desire is screeching
It takes a priest to unleash the beast
