We have found her in Supernature
In the Earth below an in the skies above
We have found her in Supernature
In all our hate and all our love
We have found her in Supernature
In both the day and the night
We have found her in Supernature
In all the darkness and all the light

SUPERNATURE

We have found her in Supernature
In the rain and in the dust
We have found her in Supernature
In all our pain and all our lust

SUPERNATURE

We have found her in Supernature
Here in life and so in death
We have found her in Supernature
In our blood and in our breath
