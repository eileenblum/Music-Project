Misguided Messiah
Pariah of twisted beauty
Spirit of fire climb higher
And higher ever
Desire, desire, to taste all
That isn't worthy
Enlightened defiler, to tire
Would shame your brilliance
Show us your fire
Messiah of phoenix wing and
Unburden, empower, deliver
The Light of Knowing

Lucifer Rising

Misguided Messiah
Pariah of twisted beauty
Spirit of fire climb higher
And higher ever
Desire, desire, to taste all
That isn't worthy
