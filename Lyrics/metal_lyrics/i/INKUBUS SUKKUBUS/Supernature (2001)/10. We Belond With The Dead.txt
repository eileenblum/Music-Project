It's too late to turn back now
For we have slain the Sacred Cow
For paradise we are bound
We were lost, but now we're found
As the razor cuts the wrist
Rejoice for Heaven's love has kissed
The icy blade shall lead the way
Don't you cry and don't you pray

We belong with the Dead

Come and sleep eternal sleep
Don't you fear and don't you weep
On a chariot we shall ride, all the way to suicide
You took me up, you dragged me down
Now my soul is quite unbound
Don't you try to change my mind
To sense and reason I am blind

On the ferry to the Underworld
Round the blade our fingers curled
Let me give you your release
In my love and in my peace
