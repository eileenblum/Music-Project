One of the fey, within the dark and gloom we'll find our way
One of the fey, we have a calling which we must obey
Here in our lives supernature lives and breathes
Once in a while you'll see your future in our eyes

Oh, we have magick in our lives
Oh, secret lives are charmed and wise

Lifted away, the shroud that blinds the soul is cast away
And joy and pain and dark emotions seek the inner flame
Caught in the light, you hold them 'til they fade and die
Blessed with the sight, your spirit soars to distant skies

Oh, we have magick in our lives
Oh, secret lives are charmed and wise
Oh, we have magick in our lives
Oh, in our eyes the moon shall rise

One of the fey, you feel a magnet pull you can't ignore
Finding the way, the path will lead you to the open door
Lost in a sea of busy times and mundane lives
In time we'll see, the future lies in open minds
