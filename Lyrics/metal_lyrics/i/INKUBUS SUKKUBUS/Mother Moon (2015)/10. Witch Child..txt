The crowd walk by, they don't see what is inside
Don't see the power, of the flames within her eyes
She is beyond the vanity of their world
Free nature child, wise woman in the girl

She can't be changed
She's got the witch child inside of her
She can't be changed
She's got the Pagan Fire in the heart of her

She's got a book of secrets, sacred herbs and of spells
She's got the look to ignite a thousand hells
In the darkened city where no one hears you cry
A full harvest moon fills the empty skies.

She can't be changed
She's got the witch child inside of her
She can't be changed
She's got the Pagan Fire in the heart of her

She can't be changed
She's got the witch child inside of her
She can't be changed
She's got the Pagan Fire in the heart of her

[Instrumental]

She can't be changed
She's got the witch child inside of her
She can't be changed
She's got the Pagan Fire in the heart of her

She can't be changed
She's got the witch child inside of her
She can't be changed
She's got the Pagan Fire in the heart of her

She can't be changed
She's got the witch child inside of her
She can't be changed
She's got the Pagan Fire in the heart of her

She can't be changed
She's got the witch child inside of her
She can't be changed
She's got the Pagan Fire in the heart of her
