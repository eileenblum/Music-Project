Hand in hand, toe to toe
The Dance of Death is never slow
We beat the drum, with bone of thigh
Our hollow eyes lift to the sky
We dance with life, beyond all life
We tell out tales of war and strife
A knife, A sickle, rattle drum,
All play the song, 'till others come.
The moonlight glow on sallow flesh
There's beauty in our Dance of Death.

Dance macabre, dance divine
Devour the flesh and drink the wine
Dance macabre, dance with me
Dance to set your spirits free.

The harpy's cry, the carrion crow
Will teach us all we need to know
Come, break the earth and touch the sky
We're here to teach you how to fly

Dance macabre, dance divine
Devour the flesh and drink the wine
Dance macabre, dance with me
Dance to set your spirits free.

Dance macabre, dance divine
Devour the flesh and drink the wine
Dance macabre, dance with me
Dance to set your spirits free.

A bow, a curtsy, fingers brush
With bone to bone, the Reaper's touch
We need not lungs to lift the cry
There's other life when once we die.

We spin, we dip, we leap and skip
Our teeth and fingers gnaw and rip
With grace we greet the rising sun
Our Dance of Death has just begun.

Dance macabre, dance divine
Devour the flesh and drink the wine
Dance macabre, dance with me
Dance to set your spirits free.

Dance macabre, dance divine
Devour the flesh and drink the wine
Dance macabre, dance with me
Dance to set your spirits free.
