With the eyes of a doe
She will take you for her own
Now the seeds are all sown
For she is wicked to the bone

There is no mercy, and there will be no peace.

With cord and with her hands
She shall make you half a man
She will tame the raging beast
She will bring you to your knees

There is no mercy, and there will be no peace.
There is no mercy, and there will be no peace.

Honey song of Lorelei
In the promise is the lie
Like a fragile winter flower
In her weakness is her power.

There is no mercy, and there will be no peace.
There is no mercy, and there will be no peace.

There is no mercy, and there will be no peace.
There is no mercy, and there will be no peace.
There is no mercy, and there will be no peace.
There is no mercy, and there will be no peace.
There is no mercy, and there will be no peace.
There is no mercy, and there will be no peace.
