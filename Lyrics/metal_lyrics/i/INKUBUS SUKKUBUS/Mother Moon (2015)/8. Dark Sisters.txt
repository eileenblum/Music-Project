Outsiders, the carrion crows
Fallen women on the left hand road
For their charms, come the Valkyrie Band
To cut out the pizzles and to take the hands
They the maggots, Battlefield Hags,
Here for the jewels, the rings and the rags.

In the city down the love-named lane
Bound together in the guild of shame
Painted mothers and daughters wait
To sell their bodies to men they hate
With scented flesh and fingers that rob
It's a nasty, dirty job.

Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.

Been so long since the ancient days
When they loved the Witch for her healing ways
Been so long since the priestess divine
Forgotten now, lost in time
Forgotten now, and now no more
Just the mothers, the virgins, the whores.

Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.

Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.

Long gone, the unwanted touch
There's gold in the ashes of the fires of lust
Now the men bother them no more
No filthy desires disguised as amour
Forgotten now, the drunken forced kiss
At last, they are free from all this.

Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.
Dark Sisters, dark sisters.

A spell for love, a spell for lust

A silken stocking, a sun-dried stool
(Dark Sisters, dark sisters.)
To stop the harlot and save the fool.
(Dark Sisters, dark sisters.)
Wand of copper, wand of glass
(Dark Sisters, dark sisters.)
To raise the storm and start the dance
(Dark Sisters, dark sisters.)
Three red candles, to seal the names
(Dark Sisters, dark sisters.)
Of star-crossed loves to the flames
(Dark Sisters, dark sisters.)
Witch hazel leaves to keep your youth
(Dark Sisters, dark sisters.)
A greasy mirror to hide the truth.
