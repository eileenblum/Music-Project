Upon the hill, decked in red and green
Beneath the skies, before the Midnight Queen
Fill us with your fire and fill us with your love
Let your silver light shine down from above

Mother Moon, let our love shine
Mother Moon, bless the food and bless the wine

Take us to the Vortex, lead us in a trance
Unbind us from the future, unbind us from the past.
Let our spirits soar high on the Astral Plane
Underneath the stars, make us wild again.

Mother Moon, let our love shine
Mother Moon, bless the food and bless the wine
Mother Moon, set our lust free
Mother Moon, loose us in the ecstasy.

[Instrumental]

Mother Moon, let our love shine
Mother Moon, bless the food and bless the wine
Mother Moon, set our lust free
Mother Moon, loose us in the ecstasy.

Mother Moon, let our love shine
Mother Moon, bless the food and bless the wine
Mother Moon, set our lust free
Mother Moon, loose us in the ecstasy.

Mother Moon [4x]

Mother Moon, let our love shine
Mother Moon, bless the food and bless the wine
Mother Moon, set our lust free
Mother Moon, loose us in the ecstasy.

Mother Moon
