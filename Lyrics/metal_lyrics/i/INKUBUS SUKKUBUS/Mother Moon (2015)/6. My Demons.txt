I have known a thousand demons.
Seen through terror eyes
I have felt and I have seen them
monsters with no disguise
I was lost and then was found
And then was lost again
I fight with tooth, I fight with claw,
They have the strength of ten.

My demons, legion they may be.
My demons, feed inside of me.

I have known the blackest dog,
He follows at my feet.
He knocks me down, he smothers me,
So darkness is complete.
I feed him love, I feed him joy,
It's not enough for him.
His appetite it knows no end,
He tears from limb to limb.

My demons, legion they may be.
My demons, feed inside of me.
My demons, live so carelessly
My demons, perfectly replete.

My demons, legion they may be.
My demons, feed inside of me.
My demons, biting at my feet.
My demons, Know no empathy.

I have known the path to heaven,
liquid and divine.
I drink it down, I bathe in it until that joy is mine.

My demons, legion they may be.
My demons, feed inside of me.
My demons, fickle with deceit.
My demons, monstrously elite.

My demons, legion they may be.
My demons, feed inside of me.
My demons, biting at my feet.
My demons, Know no empathy.

My demons, legion they may be.
My demons, feed inside of me.
My demons, live so carelessly
My demons, perfectly replete.
