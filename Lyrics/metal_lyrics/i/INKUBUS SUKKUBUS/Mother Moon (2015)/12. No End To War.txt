A million years of war
And there will be more
For the soldiers and for whores
There is always war.

With teeth and claws and fists.
With bones and rocks and sticks
War has always been a bitch
There is no end to it.

And carrion birds will feast
For there shall be no peace
It will never cease
North, South, West and East.

With spears and flint knives
For taking eyes for eyes
For cutting down more lives
Stealing land and raping wives

There is no end to war
There is no end to war

With iron, steel and tin
All it takes to win
With beer rum and gin,
The drum beat and the hymn

There is no end to war
There is no end to war
There is no end to war
There is no end to war

There is no end to war
There is no end to war

With musket and with pike
For Allah, Rome and Christ
For any god you like
For hate, fear, love and spite.

There is no end to war
There is no end to war
There is no end to war
There is no end to war

With cannons and the bomb
It just keeps on and on
In legend and in song
Never right and never wrong

There is no end to war
There is no end to war

Death rains down from the skies
With all the tools of genocide
There is no truth, there are no lies
Just the maggots and the flies

There is no end to war
There is no end to war
There is no end to war
There is no end to war

To the fire and the guns
They sacrifice their willing sons
To the brave the reaper comes
To Hell on Earth they shall be done.

There is no end to war
There is no end to war

It has always been the same
The vultures fest upon the slain
Till nothing but the bones remain
But he children left to take the blame.

There is no end to war
There is no end to war
There is no end to war
There is no end to war

To Old Valhalla, the blade awaits
To Paradise, to the pearly gates
A name in stone, the chosen fate
Just a name for future days.

There is no end to war
There is no end to war
There is no end to war
There is no end to war

There is never any end
There is never any end
There's never any end
Never ever any end.

There is no end to war
There is no end to war

There is never any end
There is never any end
There's never any end
Never ever any end.

There is no end to war
There is no end to war
There is no end to war
There is no end to war
[repeat until end]
