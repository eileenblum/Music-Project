Hidden in full view
Free from prying eyes
Unseen, unknown
Angels in disguise

Within the Secret World
Cloaked by disbelief
In the Enchanted Realm
Beyond what is believed.

Shadows in the Darkness
Creatures of the Night
Shadows in the Darkness
Forever wild

Everywhere but nowhere
The ghosts in the machine
We are the secret history
The nightmare in the dream.

Shadows in the Darkness
Creatures of the Night
Shadows in the Darkness
Forever wild.

Shadows in the Darkness
Creatures of the Night
Shadows in the Darkness
Forever wild

Calling from the Netherworld
Calling from the Netherworld
Calling from the Netherworld
Calling from the Netherworld
Calling from the Netherworld
Calling from the Netherworld

Wrapped in our deception
Dark humour hides the truth
Underground for a thousand years
Because the world is too cruel

Shadows in the Darkness
Creatures of the Night
Shadows in the Darkness
Forever wild

Shadows in the Darkness
Creatures of the Night
Shadows in the Darkness
Forever wild
