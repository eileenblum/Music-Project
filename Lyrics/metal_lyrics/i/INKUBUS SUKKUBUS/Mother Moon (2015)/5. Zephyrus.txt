You had left me long ago
Body here, heart and mind had flown
The god of wind I'd grown to know
Had swept you to a land unknown

Fair blows the wind that brings you near
Cruel is the one that left me here
A breeze so sweet, the nectar kiss
The Fates foretold it would come to this

Fair blows the wind that brings you near
Cruel is the one that left me here
Fair blows the wind that brings you near
Cruel is the one that left me here
Fair blows the wind that brings you near
Cruel is the one that left me here

The wings of gold have raised you high
An absent love with no goodbyes
Fair blows the wind that brings you near
Cruel is the one that left me here

A fragile love with summer's breath
The sleep of gods, the gentlest death

Fair blows the wind that brings you near
Cruel is the one that left me here
Fair blows the wind that brings you near
Cruel is the one that left me here
Fair blows the wind that brings you near
Cruel is the one that left me here
Fair blows the wind that brings you near
Cruel is the one that left me here
Fair blows the wind that brings you near
Cruel is the one that left me here

Oh Zephyrus, I loved you so
But why, oh why did he need to go?

Fair blows the wind that brings you near
Cruel is the one that left me here... [repeat until end]
