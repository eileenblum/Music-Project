At the hour of the witch, she has come for just one night
With scented hair, and the devil in her eyes
On whispered breath she says
"You can be weak with me, Just like a girl, is man enough for me."

Fade away in the dream
Fade away in the dream

And like the river, she will take her sacrifice
She'll take the fools, the cowards and the knights,
Her song, sweet song, says come unto my breast,
Drink from my goblet and be spent like all the rest.

Fade away in the dream
Fade away in the dream
Fade away in the dream
Fade away in the dream

She says to you, it does not matter what you are
For on this might, you are a god beneath the stars
In erotic rapture, caught in the dark romance
Bound to the moment, but the moment will not last.

Fade away in the dream
Fade away in the dream
Fade away in the dream
Fade away in the dream
Fade away in the dream
Fade away in the dream
