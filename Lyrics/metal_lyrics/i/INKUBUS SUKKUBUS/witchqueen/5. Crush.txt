With love and fire
Untimely Messiah
I fought passion, desire
You never tired

Thrashing like a demon
Steel is slashing through my veins completely
Crashing like a storm against my heart
You caress my body with a
Thousand salty kisses, stinging
Every poisoned one shall leave its mark

Live to destroy
Destroy all to thrive
In your bloody harvest
Love is the scythe
Hold back your passion
From love Iâll survive

Youâre crushing, youâre rushing
With fury hard against my heart
Defenses are strengthened
No earthly man can leave a scar
Youâre crushing, youâre rushing
With fury hard against my heart
Your love can only tear apart
