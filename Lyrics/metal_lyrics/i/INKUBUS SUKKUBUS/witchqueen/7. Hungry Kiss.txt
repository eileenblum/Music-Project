This way to all of my love
This way, the dark heavens above
This way to all of your dreams
This way to honey and cream
One step and your are undone
One kiss to what Iâve become
One touch to raise you to lust
This way to return you to dust

Underneath this moon
The dawn will come too soon
Underneath this moon
Donât hesitate, itâs already too late

One sip from my cup of wine
One sip to touch the divine
One sip and youâre lost in time
One sip and youâre ever mine

Underneath this moon
The dawn will come too soon
Underneath this moon
Donât hesitate, itâs already too late
Underneath these stars
You have come too far
Venus in conjunction with Mars
Your fate was cast
A thousand years in the past

In a field of graves
You shall be enslaved
Rush upon my blades
And lose yourself like never before
Underneath this moon
The dawn will come too soon
Underneath this moon
Donât hesitate, itâs already too late

Underneath these stars
You have come too far
Underneath these stars
Your fate was cast
A thousand years in the past
Take my hungry kiss
My aim will never miss
Give me your bleeding wrist
So I can have your body and soul
