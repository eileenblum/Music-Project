So she is the devil, and she's a bitch
She's half whore and she's half witch
You sell your children for her perfect kiss
You wonder how she brought you to this
Lady Geneva

She will enslave you and she'll set you free
You're released from your pain and bring you to your knees
You will sell your body for a cup of her love
You will murder and steal and stain your hands with blood
Lady Geneva

She will make you a fool and spit in your face
Crush your broken soul and dance on your grave
Twice the poison of opium and cocaine
Twice the damnation and twice the shame
Lady Geneva(taste the evil)
