In the womb I felt her calling to my sweet consort
And at the breast she nurtured me and helped my spirit grow
I have known her by her many names
I sang them joyfully

Freyja, Venus, Isis, Inanna, you come to me
Calling the witch queen
She's given life to me
Calling the witch queen

The arms that span a million years now hold me close to her
Eyes that capture history now smile into my own
Feel the caress of her gentle touch
Upon my skin

Mother, daughter, goddess, you are everything
Calling the witch queen
A lover endlessly
Calling the witch queen

The night has helped me see
Calling the witch queen
Ooo, yeaaa
Calling the witch queen

She's come into my soul
Calling the witch queen
She has made me whole
Calling the witch queen

Never be alone
Calling the witch queen
Never be alone
Calling the witch queen
