Come into my heart
Crawl into my grave
Like a shot of cyanide
You be crawling through my veins

Intravenous love affair
Rushing through my blood
Like an oilsmith on the sea
You corrupt all that you touch

You infect indiscriminantly
From an occipital vein
To a docile digital
Intravenous love affair

Lift me when I'm down
You can lift me way up high
Your pure and fatal drug
And to come down leaves me dry

And then I cannot let ride
Anyone into my heart
I will let you slip inside
Fill this chamber with disease
Intravenous love affair
