We've got the fever of all of the night
We've got the pain of the dark side of love
We've got the fire that burns and more
We've got the beast in us all

We've got the storm rising high in the sky
We've got the lightning and the hurricane
We've got the thunder and the devil's own rain
We've got the beast in us all

We've got the power that we can't control
It's in our genes, body, and soul
Nations rise and nations fall
We've got the beast in us all

We've got the kiss of the holy divine
They gave us brains and they gave us the wine
Made us special so that we might shine
We've got the beast in us all

We've got desires that fill us with shame
Everyone of us the mark of Cain
We''re never free from our animal chains
We've got the beast in us all

We've got the future but it's lost in our past
We've got culture but it's lost in the dance
We've got lust and we call it romance
We've got the beast in us all

We've got our vision but we don't see the truth
We want wisdom but we won't give up youth
We've got the beast in all of us
We've got the beast in us all (until fade)
