Now the mist is on the land
before the hoards of the dead we stand
against the cold of the western wind
against the demons of the night 

Let us Drink another drink
as we stand here at the brink
Let us dance, and let us feast
every man, woman and beast

On All Hallows Eve once again

On the First day of the year
let us shed another tear
let us all count the cost
and recall what we have lost

Let us kiss and have some fun
for we know whats done is done
and those who went before,
are lost forever more
On All Hallows Eve once again
On All Hallows Eve with the dead

Young girls dream of your true love
For he will soon be in your blood
may you see him in the fire
may you have your hearts desire

Young men be brave for the year ahead
Before the end you may well be dead
enjoys yourself while you are young 
and think not of whats to come

On All Hallows Eve once again
On All Hallows Eve with the dead

Underneath the moon and stars
Now the sun is in line with mars
We can lose into the night
we can have both dark and light
On All Hallows Eve once again
On All Hallows Eve with the dead
