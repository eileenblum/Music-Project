Lily Bolane, Lily Bolane.
Lily Bolane is a witch with no shame
Lily Bolane, Lily Bolane,
She'll catch you and curse you and craze you with pain
A figure of hate, a figure of fear
You cross yourself, pray and hope Mary can hear

Lily Bolane, Lily Bolane
She's wretched and twisted and ugly and lame
Spit in her path, laugh at her name
Despise and torment her again and again
You laugh when she's gone, you shake when she's near
You're brave with your friends though you're spinelss with fear

Lily Bolane [x4]

Call her a witch, call her a freak
Knock on her door when the hag is asleep
Hate with a passion, dread but deny
You're scared of her magick, you think she can fly

Lily Bolane, Lily Bolane
Lily Bolane has to carry the blame
Call her a crone, accuse her of all
Escape her revenge, shut and batten your door
