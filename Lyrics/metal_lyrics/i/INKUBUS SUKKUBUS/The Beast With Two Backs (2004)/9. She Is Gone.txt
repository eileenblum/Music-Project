The summer sun burns in the sky
And fills the world with golden fire
But your true love is lost to the night
On the wings of death she flew to the other side

She is gone, she is gone
To another world she is gone

She betrayed you with her own hand
With a silver blade, to the unknown land
There was no love, forevermore
Forget her now and cry no more

She is gone, she is gone
To another world she is gone

Now she's a memory, a fading dream
What might have been, she is gone

The buds of spring will fade to dust
And our love, was born of lust
Tomorrow comes and is yesterday
Release your pain and let it fade away

She is gone, she is gone
To another world she is gone

Now she's a memory, a fading dream
What might have been, what might have been
She is gone, she gone
