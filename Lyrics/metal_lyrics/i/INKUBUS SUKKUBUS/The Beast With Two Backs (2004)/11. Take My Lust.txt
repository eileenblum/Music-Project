I am a drifting shadow,
A ghost rider on the lonely road
My soul is craving for you,
But I know that I'll destroy you.

I hear your soul a-calling,
Like a screaming angel falling
I'll kiss you, I'll damn you,
As a fool for love I'll have you.

Take my lust, fade to dust
The grave sings like a siren,
Descend with me to Hell
My lips are sweet and poison,
And they will take you there.

Paradise and elation,
Only I can set you free,
Only I know the way,
And only I can set you free.

Take my lust, fade to dust
For this I must and you will be nothing
Take my lust, fade to dust
For this I must and you will be nothing.

Take my hungry kiss, it has come to this
The dagger on the wrist and you will be nothing
Taste my deadly flesh, lay your head to rest
Welcome unto death, and you will be nothing
Come and die with me..
