Born of Hell and born of night
Anarchist and Antichrist
Lost in lust, you shall be dust
Now the burning Sun is falling

From the dark skies above
We have come devoid of love
A cornucopia of disease
We will bring you to your knees!

We're the Vampire Punk Rockers from Hell!
And we have come to destroy your world

All your nations rise and fall
We have seen it all before
We are your apocalypse
And we are the final kiss

We're the Vampire Punk Rockers from Hell!
And we have come to destroy your world
We're the Vampire Punk Rockers from Hell!
And we have come to destroy your world

Black on black and black on black
From the void we're coming back
We are lost, and lonely
But we're the holiest of the holy

We're the Vampire Punk Rockers from Hell!
And we have come to destroy your world
We're the Vampire Punk Rockers from Hell!
We are dreaded, we are destruction
We're the Vampire Punk Rockers from Hell!
We will take you and we will waste you

We are a nemesis from a distant star
We are the dead, we are the damned
Angels and monsters, from your nighmares and your dreams
And we will drown you in erotica

From Hell
