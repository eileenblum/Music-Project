Star of Venus
You are the dream of sexual love, my love
The Moonlight in your hair
The stars shine in your eyes
And I am lost without my love of loves
Cast out in the night
A leaf on the Autumn wind

In a dream beneath the stars
Loves fire burns in my heart
Star of Venus fill me with your love

And I burn for your erotic kiss
To send me to the stars
Set my soul alight
And I cant live without my love of loves
Angel of my heart
Angel of my heart

In a dream beneath the stars
Loves fire burns in my heart
Star of Venus fill me with your love
In a dream, out of my mind
Lost in space, lost in time
Star of Venus fill me with your love

Read to me from the book of love
Sing me to my sleep
Fill my dreams with lust
And I am but a fool for you
Angel of my heart
Angel of my heart
