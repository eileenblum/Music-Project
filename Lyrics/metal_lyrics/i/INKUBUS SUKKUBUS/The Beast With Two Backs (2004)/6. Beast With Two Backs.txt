Under the sun
Under the moon
Under the stars
Through out the night
To set you alight
To steal your soul
To conquer your mind

And, it comes alive
To walk on the land
To swim in the sea
A run of the wheel
A run of the power
Forever sleeps with the beast with two backs

I missed you a while after all these years
I'm still drowning in a sea of tears
And the beast draws us to the flame
Giving us both joy and shame

Every woman
And every man
All of its subjects in total command
Whatever they think
Whatever they do
They are enslaved
That is the truth

All of the kings
All of the queens
All of the priests
All of the nuns
The rich and the poor
Forever more
Forever more

I missed you a while after all these years
I'm still drowning in a sea of tears
And the beast draws us to the flame
Giving us both joy and shame
And there is no God of love,
For we are born of flesh and blood
To desire we are bound
Here in lust we are lost and found

I missed you a while after all these years
I'm still drowning in a sea of tears
And the beast draws us to the flame
Giving us both joy and shame
And there is no God of love,
For we are born of flesh and blood
To desire we are bound
Here in lust we are lost and found
