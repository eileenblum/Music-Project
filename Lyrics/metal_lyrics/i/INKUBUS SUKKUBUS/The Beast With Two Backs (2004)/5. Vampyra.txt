Drown in a night of erotic love
In the sweat and in the blood
Riding high on the tide of pain
Come and die within my flame

The temple of sin has let you in
Gone is the light let the night begin
Horn of flesh rising higher
Filled with lust's holy fire

Oh, Satanica romantica
Oh, Vampyria erotica

Come and suffer come and bleed
Give to me everything I need
I will break your little heart
Tear your tiny soul apart

You can't hide, there's no escape
Let the fever exacerbate
In your torment you will need me
For my caprice you will feed me

Oh, Satanica romantica
Oh, Vampyria erotica
Oh, I'm Lucifer in heels and fur
Oh, my serpent kiss will never miss

I'm Leviathan, you can't refuse
Your evil goddess, and your sacred muse
A demoness born of lunar beams
Dread destroyer from your darkest dreams

Oh, Satanica romantica
Oh, Vampyria erotica
Oh, I'm Lilith with a killer kiss
Oh, you'll lose your mind while we're entwined

Oh, Satanica romantica
Oh, Vampyria erotica
Oh, I'm Venus at her meanest
Oh, Lugosi only rose for me

Oh, I'm Lucifer in heels and fur
Oh, my serpent kiss will never miss
Oh, I'm Lilith with a killer kiss
Oh, you'll lose your mind while we're entwined
Oh, I'm Venus at her meanest
Oh, Lugosi only rose for me
