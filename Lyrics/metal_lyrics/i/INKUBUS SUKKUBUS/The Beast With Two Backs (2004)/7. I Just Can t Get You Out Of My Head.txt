Can't get you out of my head
Got a devil here inside of me
Can't get you out of my head
The dead in Hell are calling me

Can't get you out of my head
As a razor tears into my flesh
Can't get you out of my head
When drowning in this misery

Everynight, everyday
Just to be there in your arms

Na na na, na na na na na
Na na na, na na na na na
Na na na, na na na na na
Na na na, na na na na na

Can't get you out of my head
When the soul is ripped right out of me
Can't get you out of my head
When the cloak of death is over me

Everynight, everyday
Just to be there in your arms

Can't get you out of my head [4x]

Na na na, na na na na na [4x]
