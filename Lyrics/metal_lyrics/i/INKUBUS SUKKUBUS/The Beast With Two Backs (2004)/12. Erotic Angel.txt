Beneath the sun of a blood red sky
He fell like a stone to eternal night
Like a comet in a ball of flame
An Angel of Light from the astral plane
Knight of Heaven, to the Tsar of Hell
To the Underworld with pride he fell
In a distant time, the old primeval
The time has come, the tide has changed

Fly Erotic Angel, Angel of desire
Lead us to temptation, take us ever higher

Twelve thousand years, cast down to earth
With broken wings and a broken heart
One dark prince of the Seraphim
Of passion, love and of Sin
Bothers, Sisters, cast off your chains
Let the slaves be free again
Let the Devil take all the blame
The time has come, the tide has turned!

Fly Erotic Angel, Angel of desire
Lead us to temptation, take us ever higher
All of the kings, and the sons of Men
Have enslaved their women, and dread his name
Lord of the Flies, Lord of lies
With cloven hooves, and bloody eyes
Fly Erotic Angel, Angel of desire
Lead us to temptation, take us ever higher...
