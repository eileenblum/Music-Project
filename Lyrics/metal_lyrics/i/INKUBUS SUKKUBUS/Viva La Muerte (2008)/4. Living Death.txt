You left my senses calling, I'm empty without you
You left my soul, mourning,
There's nothing I can do
My life was offered as a sacrifice,
You took the blade
Cut out the heart, removed my soul,
So nothing could be saved

Life with all its madness is like a carnival
You ride the horses, play the games,
Release the inner child
But when it comes to games of chance,
You lose before you begin
When others make the rules of life,
You'll find you never win

A gambling man enjoys the thrill
Of losing everything
I've lost much more than gold alone
Could ever buy again

Sweet thief of reason,
I thought you were my destiny
The future looked much brighter
When you were near to me
How quickly dreams can crumble
Beneath the cold of light
I wish that I could slumber
All through the endless night
I lie awake, the pain of light
Destroys my reverie
My skin grows colder day by day
âtil you come back to me
A gambling man enjoys the thrill
Of losing everything
I've lost much more than gold alone
Could ever buy again

You left my senses calling
I'm empty without you
You left my soul mourning,
There's nothing I can do
