Love, fire of love
Burn ever higher
Love, fire of love
Feed my desire
Love, fire of love
Born of my sighing
You are my daylight
You my endless night
You are my firelight
You the stars so bright
You are what's yet to be
You are my memory
In war and raging sea
You will defend me

Love, fire of love
Stay close beside me
Burning inside me
Love, fire of love
Give and take freely
Love, fire of love
Never deceive me

Love ascending
Love eternal
Love transcending
Life (it can never die)
Love and laughter
Pain and sorrow
Love lives after
Life... and death

Take me with you
We have forever
In love, we two
We'll be together
Wrapped in your arms
I am much braver
With strength and charm
You are my savior
