Spread on wings of soaring dove
Our love carried higher
Lifted high in silent flight
Never, ever tire

Love never ending
Love never fading
True love ascending
Promises made in
Truth, dedication
Hope and devotion
Now we are slipping
Into the endless night

Love like ours will find a way
To live on forever
Time will test,
But come what may
We will be together

You had always been my love
We were childhood sweethearts
Life had blessed us from the start
Then it tore us apart

Love never ending
Love never fading
True love ascending
Promises made in
Truth, dedication
Hope and devotion
Now we are slipping
Into the endless night
