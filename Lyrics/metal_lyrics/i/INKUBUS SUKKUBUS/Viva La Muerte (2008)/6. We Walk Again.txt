Newborn limbs, carry us back home
Take us with hope where we need to go
Each creaking step feels like it's the first
Now we are born again
We walk again on this earth
Love has its own sacred birth

We share our strength
Walk the empty street
Cruel sun above, stones beneath our feet
Your hand in mine, nothing will defeat us
Now we're born again

We walk again on this earth
Love has its own sacred birth
We fly like doves in the sky
My love and I, we will fly

Love has life of its own
Stronger than blood, flesh and bone
Love has the power to endure
Love that is strong, bright and pure

We walk again on this earth
Love has its own sacred birth
We fly like doves in the sky
My love and I, we will fly
