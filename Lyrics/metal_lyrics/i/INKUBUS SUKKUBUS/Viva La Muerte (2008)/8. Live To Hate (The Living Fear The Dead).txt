You knew me when I was
Young and lovely
You knew him when he was
Strong and healthy
Walked in your world
And you loved us freely
We're just the same,
Why can't you see that

You live to hate

Don't fear our love
And the power to endure
Don't fear our hearts,
Though they're still, they are pure
Don't fear the night,
She will love you dearly
Never fear death,
And please never fear me

You live to hate
You hate to love
You live to hate

Look to the sky
And the flight of two doves
Look to the sky, how they carry our love
Don't look to the earth
She released us gladly
Remember our lives,
But please never sadly

Let us walk again among you
Leave us free to be together
Let us walk again among you

Free to be with him forever
Let us walk again among you
Being here's not your concern
Let us walk again among you
You have life, we've love eternal
Let us walk again among you
He and I are lovers always
Let us walk again among you
You think we've forsaken your ways
Let us walk again among you
He's my lungs, my air, my last breath
Let us walk again among you
Don't fear us, and don't fear death
