You are the colour of sky in the morning
You are the light of the sun as it's dawning
You are the dew on my feet
As I first step into a brand new day
Dance by my side, I will hold you gladly
Sign for me now, I will love you madly
You are my sun and my moon,
And the stars are our children yet to be
You are the passion
That stirs deep inside me
You are the life
Flowing through my veins
Strong as an oak,
You are standing beside me
Without your love I could never remain

Brighter than sun on a brave new morning
Fresher than rain on my face as it's falling
Darker and deeper and richer than night
As I sink in your warm embrace
Lift me to you, I will dance with you always
My life it is yours, I will follow your ways
In life and in death, we are one, we are
Whole, we are joined for eternity
We'll dance with the living in joyous fiesta
Tequila will flow, we will drink of our fill
We'll dance with the dead,
We will dance with the best
And nothing will stop us when it is our will

Laughter and love, I remember it clearly
Head spinning wildly, my lover here near me
Into the night full of magic and madness, he
Slipped from my view suddenly...

You are the passion
That stirs deep inside me
You are the life
Flowing through my veins
Strong as an oak,
You were standing beside me
Without your love
I could never remain
