We have known of a truth
And we have known of a life
And we have climbed to the top of the tree

And we have screamed of a brand new liberty
Come and join in the Song for our Age
For you've created the Song for our Age

Greed and misery abound
The old control must not reign
Now we are many who through the dark can see
In our future we can all choose to be free!
