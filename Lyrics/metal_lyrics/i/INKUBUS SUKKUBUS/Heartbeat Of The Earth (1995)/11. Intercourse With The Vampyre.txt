Come inside my love and join me
I'm your worst nightmare
Thrill my cool and flesh with kisses
Ooh just right there!
I can fell your heart a-thumping
Your blood, your soul, my body pumping

[Chorus:]
Come and taste the bitter fruit
I will drain you of your juice
Let the straining serpent loose
Put your head into my noose

Come and kneel, boy, before me
Kiss my sacred altar
Come to me like a ram
To the slaughter
Feel my poisoned sting
Tonight I'll spread my wings

[Chorus]

[Guy:]
Let my serpent lose
But how can I refuse
What have I got to lose
Take my blood, take my noose

[Chorus 2x]
