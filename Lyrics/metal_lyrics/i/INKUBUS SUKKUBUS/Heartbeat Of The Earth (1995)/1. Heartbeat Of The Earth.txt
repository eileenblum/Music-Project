Can you hear the Heartbeat of the Earth?
Can you hear the Heartbeat of the Earth?
The rhythm comes and the rhythm goes
The river ebbs and the river flows
Can you hear the Heartbeat of the Earth?
Can you hear a whisper on the wind?
Can you hear a whisper on the wind?
A voice that says 'Come with me'
'And I'll set you forever free'
Do you know the mystery of the Moon?
Do you know the mystery of the Moon?
Up high in the midnight sky
Up high where the witches fly
Do you know the mystery of the Moon?
Have you seen the turning of the Wheel?
Have you seen the turning of the Wheel?
The Wheel spins round and round
It picks you up and it drops you down
Have you seen the turning of the Wheel?
