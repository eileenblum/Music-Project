Welcome to the Underworld
Here thou shall be weighed for truth
Down in Subterrania
Far from the heat of Ra
Within the womb of Nut he lay
As thou within her bones shall stay
Welcome to thy Judgement Day
Down in the Underworld

Down, down to the Underworld

Heart of sin, come not within
Thy fat shall feed a belly's greed
But come, oh thou, who doth allow
The plume to rest below
The Utchat has secured thy path
Thy place within the Boat of Ra
Descend thou with a willing heart
Down to the Otherworld.
