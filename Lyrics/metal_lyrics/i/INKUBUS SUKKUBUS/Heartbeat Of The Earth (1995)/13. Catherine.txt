The bloom of youth
Shone from her lovely face
A rose against her skin
Would not seem out of place
This silent succubi
Had men enwrapt in dreams
Such sweet seducers
Are never what they seem

Catherine [x16]

The rage of unloved wives
would seal this beauty's fate
Many years of fading looks
brought bitterness and hate
A man of God must ensure
Justice will be done
For Satan dwells within
The black heart of this one

Catherine [x16]
