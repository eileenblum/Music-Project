Let's have you show some grief
For the fools let your hearts bleed
For those who are lost in love
Those who cry for a lover's lies
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Don't cry for love

Young Lovers suffer the pains of love

Underneath a winter's moon
The end has come too soon
And filled the world with pain
In the night and in the day
The pain won't go away
Won't set us free from love

In a field of marble stones
Lie one long dead lover's bones
Forgotten, dead and gone
Sorrow's tale is on her lips
The icy blade where love once kissed
The blood runs cold inside
