With a kiss of pure steel I pierce the skin
With a wish it sinks within
With the red of your blood and the red of mine
Its flesh shall stain as wine
Our love is greater than we two
And stronger than our lives
And though our bodies may decay
Our love will survive

With threads of pure silk and scarlet in hue
I join, in love, we two
Your life you have offered freely to me
And mine I give to thee
The Earth shall hold our lovers' wish
And keep it from the day
And as the soil grows richer now
My Love, it shall stay
