Your life, so much sorrow
Let me take one moment of your pain
You have died a million times over
Who would comprehend the mystery of life's game
So come, let's share of life's treasures
We'll live a life of passion undisturbed by shame
What you require, I offer with pleasure
Let's fall laughing, tumbling in vermilion rain

Come into my life
My Prince of Shadows

My heart shall know of no other
Within your arms I feel strangely serene
All those lives you've seen rise, mature and die
Who else could say that they've seen the sights you've seen
The world shall show us such wonders
I'll cast my act into the Sea of Dreams
And so, my love, I give you my life blood
And disregard the hollow life that's been
