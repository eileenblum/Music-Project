Your love is crashing through my veins
Your heat has far eclipsed the day
Let nought but hunger take the pain
We've lived as those who've lived for fame

Take my hunger
Break my anger
Steal all madness
Slake my thirst

All those who would condemn our love
Know not the beauty in your sun
We'll live for that which must be done
Release the bird to soar above
