It's been coming for a million years,
A parasitic cancer that feeds on your fears.
And the wise men say "Look to the sky",
For the day is coming when everyone dies.

There's a plague in the East, there's a plague in the West.
There's an angel calling, and her name is Death.
There's a fireball streaming from the plane of hell,
And a thousand sirens to scream the death knell.

Here we are at the edge of hell,
Here we are at the end of the world.
Here we are at the end of the world.

And the graves will open and spew out The Dead,
Be ready when they come, to shoot them in the head.
The black sky falls, and Jerusalem burns,
And the comets crash down as the dead world turns.

Clinging together, hold each other tight,
And the magic of lust might get you through the night.
The Dead to the left, dead to the right,
Blood on the Earth, and fire in the sky.

Here we are at the edge of hell,
Here we are at the end of the world. 
Here we are at the end of the world. (x8)
