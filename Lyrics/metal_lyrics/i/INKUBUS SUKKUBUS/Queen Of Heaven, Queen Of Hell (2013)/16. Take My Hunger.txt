Take my hunger,
Break my anger.
Steal all madness,
Slake my thirst.

Take my hunger,
Break my anger.
Steal all madness,
Slake my thirst.

Your love is crashing through my veins,
Your heat has far eclipsed the day.
Let naught but hunger take the pain,
We've lived as those who've lived for fame.

Take my hunger,
Break my anger.
Steal all madness,
Slake my thirst.

All those who would condemn our love,
Know not the beauty in your sun.
We'll live for that which must be done,
Release the bird to soar above.

Take my hunger,
Break my anger.
Steal all madness,
Slake my thirst.

Your love is crashing through my veins,
Your heat has far eclipsed the day.
Let naught but hunger take the pain,
We've lived as those who've lived for fame.

Take my hunger,
Break my anger.
Steal all madness,
Slake my thirst.   (x9)
