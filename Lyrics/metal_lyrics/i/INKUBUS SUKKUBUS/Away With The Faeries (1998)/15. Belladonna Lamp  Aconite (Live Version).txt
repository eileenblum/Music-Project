Belladonna and aconite 
Give to me the gift of flight 
Take me up, airborne in the night 
In a dream, across the sky 
A hundred - million miles high 
Take me ever onwards in the night 

Dark sisters join my night flight 
See how far you can climb 
Holt's with us on this bright night 
Ride with him 'cross the sky 

As a screaming horde 
We cut the scape 
The Devil's Apple exacerbates 
To the sabbat on demon steed I ride 
Across the astral plane we race 
The universe my fingers trace 
And I am lost forever in my mind

Dark sisters join my night flight 
See how far you can climb 
Holt's with us on this bright night 
Ride with him 'cross the sky
