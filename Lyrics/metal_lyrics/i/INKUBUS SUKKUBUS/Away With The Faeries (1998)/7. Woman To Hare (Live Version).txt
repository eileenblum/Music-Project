Woman to cat to hare and back
Woman to cat to hare
I shall go with care
A woman with power may fool a man
As a hare I shall go from his sight
To most anywhere
Racing with the wind behind me
Chasing 'cross the fields of green
Running with the speed a hare can
Never will this hare be seen
A woman, not a hare, shall snare a man
But the hare and the cat shall know
Where'er he's at
His secrets and his solitude shall not be his
For a man with a plan and a mind
I wish not to find
I have watched many men in their beds as they lie
As a cat I have sat and I know
What I should not know
They may think they are strong and are brave and they rule this world
But with quiet and with magick and with hare
They do not compare
