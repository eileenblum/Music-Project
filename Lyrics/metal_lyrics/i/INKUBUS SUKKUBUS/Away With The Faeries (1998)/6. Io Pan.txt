Great god of all mankind, of nature and of lust 
Of the future yet untold and nations in the dust 
From an age of wood and stone, through bronze, iron and steel 
In the forests and in the trees and in both man and beast 
For a hundred-thousand years and onto the future days 
He's the earth, he's the sky and he's the solar blaze 
Io Pan! God of death and all creation 
Io Pan! God of lust and of nature 
Great god of the internet, his web around the earth 
In every city in every land, across the whole wide world 
Pan, Herne, Cernunnos, Lord of the Sacred Flame 
But to the Christian fools Satan is his name 
Angel of the Seraphim, they dread him more than death 
And they wait for apocalypse, they wait with bated breath 
Io Pan! God of death and all creation 
Io Pan! God of lust and of nature 
Io Pan! God of all that stands before us 
Io Pan! God of light and god of darkness 
Great god of the wild hunt, speed us to the prey 
To the game, to the stars, speed us all the way 
Guide for me my axe of flint and let my aim be true 
Lord of darkness, Lord of light, lead us to the truth 
Great god of the Universe give me my heart's desire 
Give to me the gift of flight and your eternal fire
