Come and lay down in the meadow 
Rest your head amongst the flowers 
Come and sip the sacred poison 
Fly away on the wings of madness 

They were once known as angels from the sky and heaven 
But now they are known as devils, demons, alien monsters 

Chariot of psilocybe 
Take me up to ride the lightning 
Can you hear their feet are dancing 
Can you hear their voices singing? 

They were once known as angels from the sky and heaven 
But now they are known as devils, demons, alien monsters 
Let them fill your dreams with wonder, fever, pain and passion 
Let them fill your head with thunder 

On a toadstool painted scarlet 
Sits a queen, a faery harlot 
She will lead if you will follow 
Down the road that leads to sorrow 
From the Dreamworld she is calling 
Come to me, come running, falling 
Come and sip the sacred poison 
Come and sip my sacred poison

They were once known as angels from the sky and heaven 
But now they are known as devils, demons, alien monsters 
Let them fill your dreams with wonder, fever, pain and passion 
Let them fill your head with thunder

They were once known as angels from the sky and heaven 
But now they are known as devils, demons, alien monsters 
Let them fill your dreams with wonder, fever, pain and passion 
Let them fill your head with thunder

They were once known as angels from the sky and heaven 
But now they are known as devils, demons, alien monsters 
Let them fill your dreams with wonder, fever, pain and passion 
Let them fill your head with thunder

They were once known as angels from the sky and heaven 
But now they are known as devils, demons, alien monsters 
Let them fill your dreams with wonder, fever, pain and passion 
Let them fill your head with thunder
