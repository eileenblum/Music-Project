All across the barren land 
Still cold from winter's hand 
It has been a time for tears 
Season of the Goddess return 
On this eve, the first summer night 
Out of the darkness and into the light 
Set the Beltaine fires alight 
Season of the Goddess return 
Hail! Hail! the Queen of the May 
Now is the season, now is the day 
A time to laugh and a time to play 
Hail! Hail! the Queen of the May 
Through the time when the green leaves hide 
The dream of summer has kept us alive 
Through the darkness we have survived 
Season of the Goddess return 
Let the trees be green again 
Let us all be free from pain 
Out of the ice and into the flame 
Season of the Goddess return!
