A summer night, and a long-forgotten dream 
She is here, in the moonlit stream 
She's so lonely, her soul screams to be free 
She calls to you, "Boy give your heart to me" 
Come to me, she's calling you 
Come to me, come to me 
Like a siren to the sailor moribund 
Her song of love will drag you ever down 
Her kiss will take you to a fabled sacred land 
Her lips will break you and lead you to the dance 
Come to me, she's calling you 
Come to me, come to me 
Come to me, I'll break your heart 
Come to me, come to me 
Ten-thousand years she's waiting for your touch 
Through all her tears she's dreamed of love and lust 
She's tired of crying each and every night 
A sexual bonfire, come set this girl alight!
