Starchild, on a mission of love 
Starchild, fallen from the skies above 
Lost forever in a dream 
In a mescaline time machine 
Starchild, in the danger zone 
Starchild, now she's all alone 
Lost forever in a dream 
In a mescaline time machine 
Here she comes, burning like a supernova 
Here she comes again 
Starchild 
Starchild, in the summer sky 
Starchild, drinking of the poppy wine 
Never ageing, never dying 
Always laughing, never crying 
Starchild, on the astral plane 
Starchild, in a dream once again 
Never ageing, never dying 
Always laughing, never crying
