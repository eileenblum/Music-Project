In the hush of the gloaming
As the young sleep without a care
Dark lovers greet the cool night sky
And drink of the liquid air
The time has come for the eternal young
To leave the still of the earth
And rush through the night
In their nocturnal flight
Wild beneath the midnight sun
Those who have tasted it satiates
It's an experience you won't want to miss
So cast out your fears, they're ever near
So much can change with a single kiss
They come on wings of black kid leather
Anaemia adds haste to the flight
The sky is alive with anticipation
Another soul will join them tonight
With one fatal kiss of exquisite bliss
Your body is left pale in the wake
But the vampyre catalepsy is brief
And pretty soon you'll join the feast of blood
