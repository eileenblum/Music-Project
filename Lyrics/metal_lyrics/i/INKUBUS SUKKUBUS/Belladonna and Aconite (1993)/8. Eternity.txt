Lying 'neath the trees your arms enfold me
There's some sweet magic
In the way you hold me
I feel the power in your midnight eyes
Let me drink deep from your witches potion
Like the trees we will sway in motion
Watch our souls tumbling from the sky
Wrap me up within your cloak of myst'ry
All nature holds is breath
Whene'er you kiss me
Hear my secrets uttered in my sighs

You know I'll always love you
As the Moon shines far above you
You know I'll always love you
May her light shine on our love

Fall with me into deepest ocean
And let our bodies drown in pure emotion
I feel that I'm immortal by your side
We'll live this life and then we'll live another
For all of time I hope you'll be my lover
We'll be as one long after we've died

You know I'll always love you
As the Moon shines far above you
You know I'll always love you
May her light shine on our love

You know I'll always love you
As the Moon shines far above you
You know I'll always love you
May her light shine on our love

You know I'll always love you
As the Moon shines far above you
You know I'll always love you
May her light shine on our love
