I feel you drawing near
And I will show no fear
No pleasure be denied me
A hunger grows inside me
I need your fiery kisses
Thrill me with your icy touch
What mortal lover would
Ever hope to give a woman this much
Dream lover, dream lover
Deceiver, Reliever
Dream lover, dark brother
I'll open my soul just to give you my whole
Man's greed has known no boundaries
His cruelty has no end
I feel desire as you do
So why need it so offend you?
Speak not your words of anger
Carnal acts by the Devil's will
I don't hear your accusations
Someone slipped me a happiness pill!
