A breath of wind has stirred me
From hypnotic lands
The cup falls from my hands
I feel your spirit come
A-rushing through the trees
Your call upon the breeze
Let us sing to Herne tonight
Come join his dance of life
Let us sing to Herne tonight
And join his dance of life
Proud horned one come now
With swiftness and with mirth
Be with us on this earth
We praise the phallus that has
Brought the gift of life
Join with me in this rite
