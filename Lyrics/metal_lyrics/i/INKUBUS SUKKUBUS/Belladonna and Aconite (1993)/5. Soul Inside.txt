Waking in the still of night
Darkness all around
Cold walls whisper to my soul
Of pleasures never found
I scream your name to shrouded ears
You hear what charms you most
And though I know what gifts you hold
I cannot love a ghost
I felt your spirit in me
It thrilled me so
If I ever can touch your skin
My love will surely grow
Wrapped within your lucent arms
There safety with my love
Asylum for a bleeding heart
Though limbs not flesh nor blood
Oh, let me just be close to you
Of what else do I care
And if it means another world
Then that will be my prayer
