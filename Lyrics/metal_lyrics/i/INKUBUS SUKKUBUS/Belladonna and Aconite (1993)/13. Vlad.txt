How I've loved you
And will always love you
You were the one to light
The stars in my night
Why can't one of such
Beauty live forever
Hear my soul scream its plight
You were the gift of joy
You were my light
You gave so much to life
My angel of the night
Oh hear me call you
I'll always call for you
Though you are no longer here
May my voice be carried
To your spectral ears
I need to know you are near
