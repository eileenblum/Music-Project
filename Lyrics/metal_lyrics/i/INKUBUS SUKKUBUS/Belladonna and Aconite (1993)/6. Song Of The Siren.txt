Draw near, closer now
Into my painted wings
What man can resist
When the Siren sings
Let not your ears be deadened
By the ocean's roar
Just hear my sweet lament
And I'll ask no more
Give up your will to me!
You've travelled far, my love
And the sea's been cruel
Come rest with me awhile
Why act like a fool
For I will guide your ship
To my welcome shore
So give your soul to me
When you hear the call
Upon this crimson rock
Your body lying still
And from your broken veins
I will drink my fill
Your love has given me
Meaning to my song
Within my empty heart
Is where your blood belongs
