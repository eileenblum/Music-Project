Come take my hand, run with me,
To lands of milk and honey.
Come kiss my lips and share,
The sweet taste of ecstasy. 

And lie with me, laugh with me,
We'll drink deep and frequently.
I'll love you tirelessly,
You'll raise me to ecstasy.

Drink deep of my love,
Lover be mine, we have the best of heaven.
Drink deep of the wine,
We are divine, we have now and forever,

You're wild and I'm carefree,
We live fast and dangerously.
I'll love you and you'll love me,
I'm drunk with shameless glee.

To Bacchanalia we will run,
And we'll watch the evening sun.
With hearts full and voices high,
We'll touch the fiery sky.

Drink deep of my love,
Lover be mine, we have the best of heaven.
Drink deep of the wine
We are divine, we have now and forever.

Drink deep of my love,
Lover be mine, we have the best of heaven.
Drink deep of the wine,
We are divine, we have now and forever.

Drink deep of my love,
Lover be mine, we have the best of heaven.
Drink deep of the wine,
We are divine, we have now and forever.

Drink deep of my love,
Lover be mine, we have the best of heaven.
Drink deep of the wine,
We are divine, we have now and forever.

Drink deep of my love,
Lover be mine, we have the best of heaven.
Drink deep of the wine,
We are divine, we have now and forever.

Drink deep of my love,
Lover be mine, we have the best of heaven.
Drink deep of the wine,
We are divine, we have now and forever.
