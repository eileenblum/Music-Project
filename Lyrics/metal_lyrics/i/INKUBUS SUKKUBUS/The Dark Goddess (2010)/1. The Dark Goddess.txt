It is the darkest hour of the night,
And it will be filled with blood and fire.
She said be quick before I am gone,
For I shall fade before the morning sun.

She said act now while you can,
While you can and are still a man,
Because time will come, crueler than death;
Before death comes to claim the rest.

Yeah, oh yeah, you better believe it,
The sweetest angel is the most evil.

She said kiss me, I'm a phantom born of desire,
And I shall make of you a man and a child.
She said place your hand upon my breast,
For I will be gone before the dawn's first breath.

Yeah, oh yeah, you better believe it,
The sweetest angel is the most evil.
There is a darkness in this dream goddess,
And the most beautiful is the cruelest.

There is now and there is tonight,
And tomorrow is an unwritten page.
Do it now while you are of age,
Before sorrow writes tomorrow's page.

Yeah, oh yeah, you better believe it,
The sweetest angel is the most evil.
There is a darkness in this dream goddess,
And the most beautiful is the cruelest.

Yeah, oh yeah, you better believe it,
The sweetest angel is the most evil.
There is a darkness in this dream goddess,
And the most beautiful is the cruelest.
