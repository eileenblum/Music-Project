In the year of our Lord 1505,
As an unquiet soul is stripped of it's life.
The thousands that fell âneath his hammer,
Need their story told.

There was fear at the heart of the Christian Church.
Failing power, losing trust,
Losing those that should worship.
The One True god,
What they needed was one to take hold

Of the pestilence spreading
Across the fair land,
Like disease through the veins of a slow-dying man.
Taking souls, raping souls, showing demons the route to us all.

The hammer is falling, no pity, no stalling.
It crushes with hate and with fear.
Why fear women much more, than the men and the babes?
Do they tempt you with passion, and make you their slaves?

Would they lie with the Devil, and change to a cat or a hare?
Would they come to your bed, in the form of your wife?
Would they trick you with love, and deceive you with lies?
Would they make you do things, that bring shame in the mornâs early light?

The hammer is falling, no pity, no stalling.
It crushes with hate and with fear.
The hammer is falling, no light in the morning,
It falls even though you are near.

[unknown]

The hammer is falling, no pity, no stalling.
It crushes with hate and with fear.
The hammer is falling, no light in the morning,
It falls even though you are near.

The hammer is falling and destinyâs calling,
The reason it falls is not clear.
The hammer is falling, a new day is dawning,
Remember and now shed a tear.

The hammer is falling, the hammer is falling,
The hammer is falling, the hammer is falling.
