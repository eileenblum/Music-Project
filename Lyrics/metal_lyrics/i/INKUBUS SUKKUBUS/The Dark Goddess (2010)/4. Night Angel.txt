Out of the darkness, hell unbound,
One thousand miles above the ground.
With eyes of lust and heart of fire,
She's everything you will desire.

Night Angel, she's coming for you,
Night Angel, now take the torment,
Night Angel, she's here for you now.

From the Abyss and from the dead,
She is coming for your bed.
Descending from the storm above,
She will break your heart with love.

Night Angel, she's coming for you,
Night Angel, now take the torment,
Night Angel, she's here for you now.

Night Angel, the song of heaven,
Night Angel, from hell descending,
Night Angel, it's never ending now.

Night Angel, she's coming for you,
Night Angel, now take the torment,
Night Angel, she's here for you now.

Night Angel, the song of heaven,
Night Angel, from hell descending,
Night Angel, it's never ending now.

Night Angel, she's coming for you,
Night Angel, now take the torment,
Night Angel, she's here for you now.

Night Angel, the song of heaven,
Night Angel, from hell descending,
Night Angel, it's never ending now.

Night Angel, Night Angel, Night Angel,
Night Angel, Night Angel, Night Angel.

Night Angel, she's coming for you,
Night Angel, now take the torment,
Night Angel, she's here for you now.

Night Angel.
