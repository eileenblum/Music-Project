Make your peace now, it is time,
One last feast now, sweet honey wine.
Are you ready for the Ferryman?
Are you ready for the Ferryman?

Come with me to the boat of the dead,
Across to the other side.
It's time to go now, where you belong,
Say farewell now and take my hand.

Are you ready for the Ferryman?
Are you ready for the Ferryman?
Come with me to the boat of the dead,
Across to the other side.

Across the sky, on the boat of the dead,
Hold on tight for the ride.
Come with me to the boat of the dead,
Come and take my hand.

All aboard! The boat of the dead,
Hold on tight for the ride.
Come with me on the boat of the dead,
Now it is the time.

Come with me to the boat of the dead,
Across the midnight sky.
Come with me to the boat of the dead,
Come and take my hand.

All aboard! The boat of the dead,
Hold on tight for the ride.
