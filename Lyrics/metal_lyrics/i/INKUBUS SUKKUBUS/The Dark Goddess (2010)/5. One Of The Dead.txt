No one can hurt her now.
No one can use her, or give her pain.

No one can do the things,
Do the things the boys, and the men, they do.
There is no cold wind, that in it's spite,
Would chill her to the bone.

She's one of the dead now,
She's one of the dead now.
She's one of the dead now,
She's one of the dead now.

There is no hand of fate,
That is never to late to crush her dreams.
There is no descending sorrow,
As the mirror looks back and tells no lies.

She's one of the dead now,
She's one of the dead now.
She's one of the dead now,
She's one of the dead now.

There is no hate or fear for the liberator,
Who came with a kiss and a knife.
He came as and angel of love,
To lift her up, and set her free.

She's one of the dead now,
She's one of the dead now.
She's one of the dead now,
She's one of the dead now.

She's one of the dead now,
She's one of the dead now.
She's one of the dead now,
She's one of the dead now.

She's one of the dead now,
She's one of the dead now.
She's one of the dead now,
She's one of the dead now.

She's one of the dead now,
She's one of the dead now.
She's one of the dead now,
She's one of the dead now.
