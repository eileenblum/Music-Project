Life is sweet with all it's mystery,
The death of sleep when Eros kissed me.
Your hand in mine, descending deeper,
With you beside me, sleep is sweeter.

The perfect touch of love and fire,
The touch that kills with pure desire.
A touch of lust that spares no feeling,
The touch that sends your senses reeling.

Close my eyes with silken thread,
Let me rest my heavy head.
Close my eyes with silken thread.

I am yours when you are not here.
Iâm mad with pain when you are not here,
Mad with longing, you are not here.
A silent scream without my god near.

Madness, take my senses from me;
Rip at my eyes, bring death upon me.
Destroy my hearing and my memory,
Flesh be gone for you offend me.

Close my eyes with silken thread,
Let me rest my heavy head.
Close my eyes with silken thread.

Heart, be quiet, pulse be still now,
Eros, go, Iâve had my fill now.
You vex my mind, I do not know how,
A god of love has to kill now.

Body weak, senses drifting,
Oh, so sweet, the feeling lifting.
Higher still, higher, higher,
Stripped of love and dark desire.

Close my eyes with silken thread,
Weave my dreams in gold and red.
Lie here close within my bed.

Close my eyes with silken thread,
Sing me songs about the dead.
Tell me things youâve never said.

Life is sweet with all it's mystery,
The death of sleep when Eros kissed me.
