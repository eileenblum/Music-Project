At the Nymphaeum you can lose your mind,
You can lose all time and damn yourself to love.
At the Nymphaeum you can have it all,
You can be reborn, and damn yourself to love.

Lose yourself at the Nymphaeum,
Give your soul up to lust.

At the Nymphaeum you shall have the truth,
You shall have your youth, damn yourself to love.
On a summer night, perfume in the air;
Desire is everywhere, damn yourself to love.

Lose yourself at the Nymphaeum,
Give your soul up to lust.
Be consumed in the ecstasy,
Drown yourself in sexual fire.

At the Nymphaeum, and underneath the stars;
Sink into the dream, damn yourself to love.

Lose yourself at the Nymphaeum,
Give your soul up to lust.
Be consumed in the ecstasy,
Drown yourself in sexual fire.

Lose yourself at the Nymphaeum,
Give your soul up to lust.
Be consumed in the ecstasy,
Drown yourself in sexual fire.

Fall as a fool to the lunacy,
Underneath the summer moon.
Lose yourself at the Nymphaeum,
Paradise is here and now.
