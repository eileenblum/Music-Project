The brightest moon, the fullest moon,
Her power can move the ocean deep.
That shining disc of silver light,
Can rouse the dreamer from his sleep.

Great Goddess Moon, you pull the strings,
And lead the dance of life and death.
You fill the spirit, fill the soul,
And fill the lungs with vital breath.

Mother Goddess Moon, healer and destroyer,
Lighter of the Dark, torment of the soul.
Mother Goddess Moon, light the dark with fire,
Cloud the clearest mind and mystify.

You move among us, move within us,
Mould our flesh with grace and ease.
You fill us up with joy and love
Then break us down whene'er you please

Great Goddess Moon, sweet Mother Moon,
The fury of the storm is yours.
The storm that rages in the soul,
The lunacy and broken laws.

Mother Goddess Moon, healer and destroyer,
Lighter of the Dark, torment of the soul.
Mother Goddess Moon, light the dark with fire,
Cloud the clearest mind and mystify.

Mother Goddess Moon, healer and destroyer,
Lighter of the Dark, torment of the soul.
Mother Goddess Moon, light the dark with fire,
Cloud the clearest mind and mystify.

Mother Goddess Moon, healer and destroyer,
Lighter of the Dark, torment of the soul.
Mother Goddess Moon, light the dark with fire,
Cloud the clearest mind and mystify.

Mother Goddess Moon, healer and destroyer,
Lighter of the Dark, torment of the soul.
Mother Goddess Moon, light the dark with fire,
Cloud the clearest mind and mystify.

Mother Goddess Moon, healer and destroyer,
Lighter of the Dark, torment of the soul.
Mother Goddess Moon, light the dark with fire,
Cloud the clearest mind and mystify.
