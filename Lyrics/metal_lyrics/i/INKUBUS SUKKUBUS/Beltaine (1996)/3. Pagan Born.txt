A rhythm stirs within the earth 
That tells all nature of a birth 
A return to light, return to life 
And lead us from this darkest night 
God of the Sun, now have you come 
Your reign of light has just begun 
Though all must die to be reborn 
Return now on a bright new morn 
My lord applauds my Pagan ways 
And in my heart he'll always stay 
Pagan Born! 
In winter's cloak we've sheltered long 
Waiting for spring's sweet song 
Tho' warmth we found beside the hearth 
Its glow could not break through the dark 
I look toward the fiery sky 
And know that your return is nigh 
Though I shall fall as the harvest corn 
It is my fate, I'm Pagan Born!
