Fall into my arms my love
And dream sweet sinful dreams
Where no-one is ever who they seem
Let me be your darkened angel
Surrender your love to me
Embrace the nigth for all eternity

Let me hold you, open up your love to me
Feel my caresses, open up your heart to me
Where in this life would you find a lover like I can be
I will destroy you, open up your soul to me

Feel no fear my love
For we were meant to be as one
Is not the moon much finer than the sun?
Let my cheeks be stained
By the yeilding of your heart
And never more need we be apart

Fall into my arms my love
And dream sweet sinful dreams
Where no-one is ever who they seem
And while my crimson lips
Are still moistened from the kiss
Share with me such unwordly bliss
