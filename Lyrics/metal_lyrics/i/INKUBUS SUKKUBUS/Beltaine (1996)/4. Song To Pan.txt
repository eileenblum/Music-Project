Can you hear the forest sing? 
On a breath of damiana it calls his name 
Seduced by his spirit once again 
Cloven hooves beat upon the earth 
He comes to us from Arcadia through the trees 
The rush of his force felt upon the breeze 
He comes on hooves of goat 
He comes with songs that float on the wind 
Let your senses know of him 
Feel the earth it trembles underneath shaggy thighs 
The sky is afire from his flashing eyes 
If a nymph I'd follow him 
Be a match for his wild carousing and bestial ways 
And in the woods I too would play

"Oh great horned god of ages past
Lord of the hunt, Lord of the dance
From that place where you lie slain
Come to me, return again
Across the mountains, the fields, the sands
Be once more upon this land!
Oh great horned god, of times gone by
Lord of the earth, the sea and the sky
Of the forest, and of the glade
Be with us now, and for all our days
Herne, Cernunnos, Karnayna, Pan
Be once more upon this land... "
