A distant shriek breaks the quiet night
Night creatures turn their their ears
Skyclad figures ride enchanted steeds
Chasing on at breakneck speeds

Can you see them speeding through the night
As fast as any bird in flight
Silhouettes against the mother moon 
They will be there soon

When the cloud rolls on there wait there sister dears
No one else could seem to hear
Let us join together in our secret art*
Merry meet and merry part

Can you see them speeding through the night
As fast as any bird in flight
Silhouettes against the mother moon 
They will be there soon
