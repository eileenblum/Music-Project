I am the One 
From the dark side of your dreams 
I am the One 
The one who hears your screams 
I am the One, I am the One 
I am a vampyre a - calling for your love 
I am the fire that burns within your blood 
I am the One, I am the One 
I am the One, I am the One 
No bars or chains can keep me from your bed 
Nothing on earth can get me from your head 
I am the One, I am the One 

I'm the angel of your desire 
Burning in the night 
I'm the pyre, I'm the fire 
Come to set you alight 
I am the One 

Forget the past, live only for tonight 
How many loves have shared such pure delight? 
I am the One, I am the One 
I am the One, I am the One 

I'm the angel of your desire 
Burning in the night 
I'm the pyre, I'm the fire 
Come to set you alight 
I am the One 

Rest now, my love, let troubles slip away 
I shall return on the darkening of the day 
I am the One, I am the One

I'm the angel of your desire 
Burning in the night 
I'm the pyre, I'm the fire 
Come to set you alight 
I am the One
