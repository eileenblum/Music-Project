Underneath the neolithic sky 
Where the beasts are so proud to die 
Across the sea of a million dreams 
Where nothing is as it once seemed 

I hear the Pan Pipes playing 
In what the wind is saying 
Here comes the fallen angel 
Here comes the long-dead god 
Back from the years in exile 
Here comes a wild Pagan hunt

And the May Queen sings her song 
For her consort who is gone 
Children mourn the loss of Pan 
Whom Death banished from this land

I hear the Pan Pipes playing 
In what the wind is saying 
Here comes the fallen angel 
Here comes the long-dead god 
Back from the years in exile 
Here comes a wild Pagan hunt 

It has been two thousand years 
The earth is soaked with blood and tears 
The once-great Lord of the Hunt lies slain 
His bride's a-burning in the flame 

Mother Earth lies raped and poisoned 
The final day draws ever closer 
To a time of ice and fire 
She shall be the funeral pyre

I hear the Pan Pipes playing 
In what the wind is saying 
Here comes the fallen angel 
Here comes the long-dead god 
Back from the years in exile 
Here comes a wild Pagan hunt 

I hear the Pan Pipes playing 
In what the wind is saying 
Here comes the fallen angel 
Here comes the long-dead god 
Back from the years in exile 
Here comes a wild Pagan hunt
