Come and dance with me to the sound 
Of enchanted feet thumping on the ground 
And if you listen well, you're surely bound 
To join the dancing wildly round 
Come and join the dance without delay 
Let the faery people lead the way 
When their voices call you you obey 
Feel the rhythmic beat of the bodhran 
And let it summon up a storm 
And tho' your head may reel, and eyes may fail 
Any sense beside it would be paled 
Come and join the dance without delay 
Let the faery people lead the way 
When their voices call you you obey 
Stare into my eyes that hypnotise 
And give your soul up to the night 
And with the power we raise in our delight 
A thousand spirits will take flight! 
Come and join the dance without delay 
Let the faery people lead the way 
When their voices call you you obey 
Come and join the dance without delay 
Let the faery people lead the way 
When their voices call you you obey
