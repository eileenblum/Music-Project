In the forest, in the night
Underneath the full moonlight
She's always there
Nature's child in the woodland air
Fade into the dream
And when your heart is filled with fear
Close your eyes for she is here
She's always there
The stars shine in her raven hair
Fade into the dream

And on a night like this
You'll find her burning kiss
Her hair all wrapped around you
Your dreams are here to drown you

And in the winter and autumn time
Sing your song, drink your wine
For she is here
The Midnight Queen is dressed in green
Fade into the dream
Does the cold air chill your spine
And to the truth you are blind
For she is here
The naked spirit of the forest glade
Fade into the dream
