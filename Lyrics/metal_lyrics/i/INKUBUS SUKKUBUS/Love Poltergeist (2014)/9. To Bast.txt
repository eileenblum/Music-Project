Warrior goddess, sacred yet profane
A child of Ra, avenger of our pain
Destroy the poison and rebuild our land
With strength and power, my hand is in your hand

Our Lion Queen, our feline mother
Our Warrior Queen would serve no other

Protect the land and protect the King
Destroy those who would threaten him
With Lionheart and with all your might
Do not let aught ever stop the fight

Fight with power and fight with passion
Fight with all so you can pass on this land

Mother, daughter, consort of Ptah
With tearing claw, you the Eye of Ra
You love with fury, vengeance is your creed
Fulfill our loves and fulfill our needs
