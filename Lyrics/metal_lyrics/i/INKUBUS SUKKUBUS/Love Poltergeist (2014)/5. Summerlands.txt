The time has come, the time has come
What is not done can stay undone
For the days ahead they are no more
For I am bound to nature's law

Take me up to the Summerlands
Take me up where I will be free

The end it comes, it comes too soon
And there is so much left to do
But it's too late and time won't wait
And I must go and face my fate

To dance again in the realms of Pan
To Elysian Fields of music and wine
