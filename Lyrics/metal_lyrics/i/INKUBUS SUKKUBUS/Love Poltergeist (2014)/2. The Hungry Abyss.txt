The lonely night stares out with hungry eyes
The lonely night hears all your fears and cries
The Phantom World is here and is now
The Phantom World hat enwrapped you like a shroud

Angels of Darkness, Angels of Light
Born of your craving, born of the night

A lover comes on the ether of a dream
A lover comes to take you as you sleep
The trembling kiss will feed your starving soul
The trembling kiss will free you from the cold

The ghostly touch is a touch to much
The ghostly touch and yourself you cannot trust

Beautiful demons, irresistible nightmares
Monsters magnificent, born of the night

The Abyss is staring back
