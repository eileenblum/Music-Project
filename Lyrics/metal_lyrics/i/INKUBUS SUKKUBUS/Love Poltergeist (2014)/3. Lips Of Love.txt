Love will come but lust will never stay
And you must act on the seasons and the day
For time is here and time you cannot tame
And time will take us one an all and all the same

Put your lips on the lips of love and set all heaven free
Feel the fire in your blood and taste the ecstasy

Don't let fade an earthly paradise
Don't lose to the past your one true heart's desire

And the sweet fair skin that was born of youth's fair spring
Shall fade with the dawning of each day and every night
To be young is a dream that cannot last
Old age to come is a spell long since cast

Put your lips on the lips of love and fall forever more
Put your lips on the lips of love, let the mystery be no more
