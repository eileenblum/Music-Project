Lies
Pulling blinders locking coffins tight
Nothing written of past rebellions
Just proclamations of our judgement day
Where righteous soldiers will kill to pave the way

Hey
Did you hear our diplomat betray?
"Progress lies in aero-techno-crats and missiles garnering defence
Of poverty and sickness we will cleanse
No more"
We've had our minds ripped-cleaned-restored
And no longer own them

Been poisoned
Been shackled
Tired and locked down
The way they want us to be

Times
Are dangerous for the last unbridled minds
Consensus wrapped us in a handbag
Mesmerized by TV sets and craze
For winning numbers and a chance to hate

We've had our minds ripped-cleaned-restored
And no longer own them

Been poisoned
Been shackled
Beat to death
They still brought me back to life
Build gallows
Kill Neighbours
String helpless
To carry out the final plan

Will progress still lead us?
Or will progress just watch us all die?
Small voices all around us
Will we march to the sound of a dying cry?
