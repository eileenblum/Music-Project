Crawling under Skin
The voices are back again
They will never rest
Until everyone is dead

Fire burning inside your mind
I see the look in your eyes
Are you prepared to die?
Storm your way through the gates
Right into death's embrace
And burn yourself alive
Hear the curdling screams
Piercing walls of flame
Until ash only remains

Bound inside of human flesh
They will never rest
Until everyone is dead
There will be no remorse
There will be no recourse
And they'll do it all again
Tear the flesh from bone
Murder and move on
Until the next victim is found

We'll clean up the blood
We must hide what we've become
