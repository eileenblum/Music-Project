I walked the tightrope of time to see where it goes
It turned into a noose and hung me
I saw the ending and a handful of lies
We were force fed and bleeding for days and nights
Hell had come to earth and conquered
They Assembled
No one leaves alive

I spit the bullet that was shot right for my throat
Skipped out on the new bomb shelter
Then hide out in the woods behind your house
For forty days and forty more
We stuck it to the news and papers
Smashed windows
Waged our war

Your new tomb raiders
Crystal balls
That take the money
When the clarion calls
For new blood to cover old blood soakened faces
Didn't ask for much or the iron fist

For evil that is lurking
And darkness that is turning
We'll crush you with the iron fist
