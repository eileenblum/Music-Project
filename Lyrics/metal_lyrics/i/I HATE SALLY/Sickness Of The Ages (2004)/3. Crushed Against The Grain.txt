Bring this cold insanity
This cold bedeviled liar - Lets bring him to his knees
We're not fighting fire with fire
But your sanctity must die

Cause there's no god in fuckin' state
Wasn't born too late to realize that hate
Means building walls
Means killing sin
We're breaking in
Enough deceit
Enough of grief
I can't believe
Election lost
This holocaust
Turns terror in

Enough deceit
Enough of grief
This I believe

Lets bring this dead humanity
This monotonous machine
Rebuild it from its knees
And fuck the American dream
Fuck these common themes

Injecting spikes into my veins
I bet it rains when you create these higher walls
This higher sin
We're breaking in
You're breaking in
Enough deceit
Enough of grief
I can't believe
This Martial law
Exists at all
The blade it falls

Enough deceit
Enough of grief
This I believe

Crushed against the grain
