Yes, I believe in torture and anger and hate
Yes, I believe in murder and hunger and rape
Are you proud of this horror you've become?
Would you sell your soul and bow
To your knees and pledge your allegiance to me?
You'll never see
I'm the bringer of death and disease

Watch out:fingerprints mark innocence and shame
Lets congregate
This national rifle pointed at me
I'm under the ribs of death alone
They feed me cancer
Your sycophantic cronies
Poke the ribs of death they know my fear

You'll never see
I'm the bringer of death and disease
Cloaked and unseen behind the promise of liberty

Watch out:fingerprints mark innocence and shame
Lets propagate
This national rifle pointed at me
I'm under the ribs of death alone
They bleed me of answers
Your sycophantic cronies
Poke the ribs of death they know my fear

These walls don't end
Stretched arms grow thin
Great minds locked in
These wars don't end
