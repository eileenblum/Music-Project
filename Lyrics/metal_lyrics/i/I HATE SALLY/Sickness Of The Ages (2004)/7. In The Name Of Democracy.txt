Burn the village to the ground
Gather the survivors and kill them all
Leave no stone unturned
Stop at nothing to quench your thirst
Dehumanize the enemy
Human fodder fuels the machine
Slaughtered by the dozens in the streets
The soil of this place still bleeds with the blood of innocents
Three generations put to death
The rape, racism, revenge never ends
Poison the well with the dead
Silence the conspirators by caving in their heads
Smoke them out of their holes
Rape their bodies - Burn their souls
Bruised, beaten, bloodied at my feet
Bullet in the back for those who flee
Slaughtered by the dozens in the streets
The soil of this place still bleeds with the blood of innocents
Three generations put to death
The rape, racism, revenge never ends
Systematically seek and destroy every living thing
Do it in the name of democracy

Taste the blood of innocents when you gnash your teeth and lick your lips
The rape, racism, revenge never ends
Systematically seek and destroy every living thing
Do it in the name of democracy
