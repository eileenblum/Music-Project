A pathological government told be of another Vietnam and said
"If you lose sight while you're searching, we'll find you a target and rise 
our unity"
Then the witch-hunt starts to come within
But not for a while
Wealth or the "innocent"
You're either with us or against us
You better understand
We're not slipping
Just looking for the answers
There's nothing we don't know about you
Finance, structure, religion
Indoctrination won't be broken down
Death tolls don't compromise position
What we bury deep will rest alone
Now it seems we're cut from the living
On the outside or the darkest skids of town
And the neighbours talk and hiss at long-dyed hair
Metal tapes
The underground
Anti-this finds fault with anti-that
And our ghetto wars
Tear each other apart
The rent cheques finds the bottles
A toast to us hiding here's to us being exposed

We're not slipping
Just looking for the answers
There's nothing we don't know about you
Finance, structure, religion
Indoctrination won't be broken down
Death tolls don't compromise position
What we bury deep will rest alone
In the shopping malls that are built on graveyards
In the funding for this warlord government
These roots of evil turning up again
