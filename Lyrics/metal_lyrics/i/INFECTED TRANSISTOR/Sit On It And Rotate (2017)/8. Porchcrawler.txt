Porchcrawler
Stuck in the eye
Foreboding and misbegotten
To a T, to a lie

To sway down this path of deplorability
To sit in your throne of wet paper
Shrugged off the ghosts of yesteryear
To sit in a vile stupor of fragile peace

Stained and peeling, like an old weatherboard

Reality's slowly crawling away
To save face, to slap yours

Drown the river
Down the gullet
Down the barrel
Stuck in your eye
