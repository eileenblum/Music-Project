Blind to your failures, that you'll never give up
You can't be wrong because you can't bare to be stumped
Something inside is telling you to keep pushing on
Without giving me a fucking seconds thought

I need some time to think it through, but you can't stop
My wits run thin but you keep ranting and raging on
You keep firing on all cylinders
Pushing me to the point of self destruct

One sided argument

Let me be
Let me be
At a loss
For words
...with you

...just for a moment

The best form of defence isn't always attack
You always leave me slightly astonished
As just to how feeble you really are
Can't take a tiny fucking chink in your armour

Why go all out going swinging for the fences
When you don't know what's on the other side of the fence
You can't admit defeat if you don't know your beaten
Your selective lack of empathy

Misguided recalcitrance

Let me be
Let me be
At a loss
For words
...with you
