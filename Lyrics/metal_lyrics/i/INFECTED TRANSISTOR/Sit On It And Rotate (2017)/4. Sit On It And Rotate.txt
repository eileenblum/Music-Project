Filled to the brim
Agitation wearing thin
Weary yet still restless
Discontent in helplessness

This is what you heed
Arbitrarily
What are you finding
Or is it finding you

Sit on it
Rotate
Sit on it
Rotate
Harden up cunt

Is it finding you
Down to the sinew
Is it grinding through
Down to the sinew

Run it's paces through
Opening the wounds
Bear trap snare removes... conviction
You just have to sit...

Sit on it
Rotate
Sit on it
Rotate
Harden up cunt

Left in ruin
