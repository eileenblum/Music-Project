The hippos never see the truth
Burnt the tree he grew on
Why is the duck on fire
My jetpack's a piece of crap
The government

Get your own vegemite cunt
Chewing through a spitfire wing
Burnt halfway into a custard cream

Divide by zero, times by one
Gary ate the fried udon
Peyote vole climbs the stairs
Weaving loosely through my hair
Didn't know they sold that there
Shit-faced Jesus fucked a bear

Ate my leg but it grew back
Ten foot cherry pancake hat
Never flashed that ballroom dancer
Even when she rode that panda
Now I know just where I am
Naked in the aquarium
