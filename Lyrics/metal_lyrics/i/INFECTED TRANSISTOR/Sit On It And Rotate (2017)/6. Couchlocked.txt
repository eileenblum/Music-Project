Seven fingers on one hand
On the bottle, in the can
Pictures streaming on the box
Now I've realised I'm couchlocked

Take the hit
Keep it in... and hold
Exhale slowly
Repeat it

Slowly it dawns on me
Sudden clarity on the TV
Gilmore girls preaching gospel
Rory warming the cockles

Stuck sweating contemplating
Thinking while procrastinating
Actually maybe it's ok
Lauren Graham's fascinating

Take the hit
Keep it in... and hold
Exhale slowly
Repeat it

Take the hit
Keep it in... and hold
Exhale slowly
Repeat it

Walls slowly moving
Closer they encroach
Tendons quickly tensing
As the flames near the roach

Reality fading
Replaced by soap opera
Story lines intersect
Weaving through cornucopia

Break the chains... invisible
Escape the pull while it's weakening
The toilet seat awaits

Pushing through the pain
Gritting teeth, clenching fists
This has gone way too far
Someone call the anaesthetist

Euphoric state of mind
Eyesight shifting, never focused
Toilet paper running thin
Fuck it, guess I'm sleeping here tonight
