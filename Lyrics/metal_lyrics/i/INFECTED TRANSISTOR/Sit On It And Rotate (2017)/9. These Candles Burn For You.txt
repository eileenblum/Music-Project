Scatter the ashes of the dead over the headlines
Salt the wounds of the living with the deadlines
Pray for the survivors to shatter their prey
Riddled with bullets, let the ashes rain

Loss of life, loss of love
Their spirits stand true
Within the darkness these candles burn for you

The romance of war is dead and buried
Turning the cities to cemeteries
Torn and worn from the scars of war
Waiting for the fall
A state so paranoid

Loss of life, loss of love
Their spirits stand true
Within the darkness these candles burn for you

Tears shed for the lost
Blood shed for the cost
Of the remaining
Equality in sorrow
...pertaining

Loss of life, loss of love
Their spirits stand true
Within the darkness these candles burn for you
