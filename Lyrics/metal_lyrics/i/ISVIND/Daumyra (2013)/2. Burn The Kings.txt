High in the mountains, deep in the woods
Old spirits, regents of the fields
Fire across the land, all living must face the end
Only kings remain, lifeless, mighty, walking
The ground trembles so mountains fall
The landscape is gone, they call it their home
Under the sea, over the horizon
There can be no one left
The sky opens, a fiery doom
The air melts, time to leave
