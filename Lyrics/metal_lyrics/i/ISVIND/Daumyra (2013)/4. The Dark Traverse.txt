Dressed to walk the path of wrath
Soulless wandering onwards
His life has long since left
Dragging chains meant to lock him in
No walls can keep him out
No gates can stand his might
A fist to grasp the cross
And thrust it down by force
Flames are rising from the corpse
Scorching heat to boil the blood
His soul is cold and vast like space
His gaze as sharp as his scythe
The black cloth of eternity
Covers his lifeless bones
Fear has come to bring you down
Death has come to let you in
