World in fire, dark desire
I welcome you in, to crush you with sin
Ghastly terror, always horror
Here I leave you, here I leave you
Trembling death, cold delight
To slowly rot alone in time
Truth collides with truth and lies
A mass hysteria kept alive
From life to death, from death to hate
Blood like ice, flesh like fire
Yearn for pulse; Their dark desire
In a shattered mirror my reflection arise
