...Hiding in consuming fire
She trampled the face of endless desire.

Clinging to perversion daughter eve,
destroy the light and curse the night,
her daughter will deceive.

Tied and bound,
where is power lying naked,
helpless on the ground?

Feeling your time slip by,
Treacherous deceit repaid,
her daughter now must die...
