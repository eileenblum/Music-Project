Time the time
Faith no longs
Fight the minds
And lock the dots
None of nothing wakes for a change
All of remained, locked in a cage
I must confess that,
I could not be what I want
cos I don't know what's inside
what's inside
I am circled
Ä°t gets me crawl
And I need to crawl
These bends hve never been this tallÂ 
To fall over
This lonely space never meant to be
Forgotten
Maybe some will try
An' I did, and seen moreÂ 
In this lost june
I'll heal myself
In tis lonely june I'll heal myself to death
Timing, to see you all fading
These are wholy lies
These maggits wait a life time to see you
Fading to die
All grains blows fragile leaves to see the june
Not for whom to tune
Never went there to be a rumor
I just wanted to know how
Never send here to be a human

I just want to know why
Just give me a sign
These maggits wait a life time to see you
Fading to die
All grains blows fragile leaves to see the june
Not for whom to tune
