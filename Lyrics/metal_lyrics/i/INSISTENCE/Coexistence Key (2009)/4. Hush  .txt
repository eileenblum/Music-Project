Told , passed and doneÂ 
Are not so far awayÂ 
As the blood in my vein is
Flowing as hopeful as that day
Youâve made me seenÂ 
Got me felt the hellâs face on the earthÂ 
But you gotta know that lies donât
Get you felt , make you burn
Before all of theseÂ 
The world is little , the city is moreÂ 
(So) probably youâll face your fateÂ 
Very near , donât wait (for) the date
But donât be afraidÂ 
Of my feelings with full of hateÂ 
Somehow youâve got more reasons than
Everyone who's going there
God doesnât always wait there to sayÂ 
The words that make you , give you pain
For all those reasons , for your rushÂ 
The suit reply is a hush
Reply is the hush â¦Â 
Response is the hush â¦
Both of us will be deadÂ 
Then ?
To see your helpless eyesÂ 
Is the only wish of mineÂ 
Donât see that as a revenge
God doesnât always wait there to sayÂ 
The words that make you , give you pain
For all those reasons , for your rushÂ 
The suit reply is a hush
