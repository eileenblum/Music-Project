vulg the baby in a filthÂ 
and just cut the cordon,
That was the only thing you could , I could not care
when I smelled the gift you gave to me
I realizedÂ 
Crap was my hometown
nose was my eyes nose my only way
Everything savoures one by oneÂ 
images are smellsÂ 
shapes too...
You were the first, You were murdered just by my instinctsÂ 
But I'm sure that I can create your love
I just have to learn how to capture the smell
I can take your smell
everywhere I was sent I thought I smelled your heart
I breath the freedom
purified all beauties I saw, to smell you again
They named me Angel
I'm standing here as a guilty
Everything is timeless right nowÂ 
And dont adore me, it was just a pour of my life

everywhere I was sent I thought I smelled your heart
I breath the freedom
