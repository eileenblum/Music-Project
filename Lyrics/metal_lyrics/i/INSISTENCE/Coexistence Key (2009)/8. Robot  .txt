I am the product of the modern timesÂ 
Live in the city, love the fast foodÂ 
Talanted on consuming life and love
And they have a remote controlling meÂ 
Only one button commanding only one missionÂ 
To âget the right things at right place in right timeâ
Who are they ?Â 
No one from my race even knowsÂ 
Yes, I am not aloneÂ 
We like to walk as billions
Billions ? reminds me itÂ 
Always complaining about its lackÂ 
It comes over, we get happy
It can wash away the sins, pains
It can reverse a huge dust cloud to a big blue marble
Whose role was this ?
