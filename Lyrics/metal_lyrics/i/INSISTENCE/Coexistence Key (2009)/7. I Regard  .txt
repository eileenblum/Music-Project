Your tainted bastard fails
Your mess will dissappear again
How could you think that I could barely forget my name shit,
I Regard myself
Those days will never come
All lies passed by your rotten throat I guide
No hails, no scars can change me
I see your face an' I Regard myself
Somehow I see your face againÂ 
I regard myself
Somehow it dissappeared
I regard myself
where I come along
I regard myself
where Ä± wont go away
So impressive case you came to me
I cant belive you
I cant believe how Can you look in my eyes
How could you say you cried for me
I'm stand alone for years
