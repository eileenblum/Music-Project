[Inspired by âFul YapraklarÄ±â]

After passing (the) point of no returnÂ 
Nothing seems the former formsÂ 
You become another fleshÂ 
Whose perceptions confused
Objects of life get changedÂ 
Rulers and rules get razedÂ 
The only way to shake your groundÂ 
Its cure (is) still unfound
Scraped images on my mindâsÂ 
Reflections donât seem like youÂ 
That iâve been for so long imagingÂ 
This is the pain despite having you
Having you is posibble as to realize my weakness
Being aware is impossible as finding me in darkness
After passing point of no returnÂ 
Lies and truth get bluredÂ 
Every word of her lipsÂ 
Is closer than your mindÂ 
Knowing is not to knowÂ 
Seeing is not to beÂ 
Dreams of pink fine daysÂ 
Will not ever be
