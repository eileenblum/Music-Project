Solutions are set when I felt hope in groundÂ 
Hope of covering, covering all shades
I cant blame on, seas never filled me
I cant blame for this lovely beat
Leading colors, help me to change this
Roundig goddess wake up and join the dream
Leave all the hands, close all your eyes
Try all keys to unlock this rain
Spit all the colors of your eyes
Make me think the rainbow we watch
There must be a problem, a solution
makes me think the lonely colors
Again I'm awake
I'm sober
There must be a problemÂ 
I should erase the word
How could I say that I'm sober
There should be world where I raised
I cant find the way
And I say Its changing me
