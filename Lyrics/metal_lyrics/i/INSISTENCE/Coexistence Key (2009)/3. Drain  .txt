Mankind is gathered around a holeÂ 
For carring out their last goalÂ 
No one takes blame upon oneselfÂ 
So no guilty , co-operated show
More and more and moreÂ 
Wanting is never endingÂ 
Losing humanity â¦ Nothing ..!
More and more and moreÂ 
Consuming grain by grainÂ 
Kindness and faith â¦ Drain â¦!Â 

Humanrace built the world
using science and philosophy
When the time came to choose
Which way is rightâ¦ evil might!
Step by step they are going to the end
On the judgement day, nothing to pretendÂ 
Despite this conscious, they go drain â¦Â 
Optimum rate (is) not maximum gainÂ 

More and more and moreÂ 
Wanting is never endingÂ 
Losing humanity â¦ Nothing ..!
More and more and moreÂ 
Consuming grain by grainÂ 
Kindness and faith â¦ Drain â¦!
Humanrace built the world
using science and philosophy
When the time came to choose
Which way is rightâ¦ evil might!
