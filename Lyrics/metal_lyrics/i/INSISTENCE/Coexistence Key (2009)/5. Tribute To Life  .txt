Everytime i searched for the waysÂ 
To break the truthÂ 
âlonliness from birth to deathâ
I saw the ambition slaving on the mouths
I saw the fight that iâve been, aimless
Going as i came , dying as i bornÂ 
Everytime i thought this painÂ 
I can see the human made truth
But I canât change the orderÂ 
Faith and soul tied
Ones like me calmed
With optimizing realityÂ 
I realized â¦
Everyone has a storyÂ 
Everyone failed once test of lifeÂ 
My pain doesnât decrease yoursÂ 
And yours doesnât mine
Rivalry is told as the best way for nature
Ok , Allright â¦Â 
Have ever the ones told that realizedÂ 
That the solidarity was ever tried ?Â 
Going as we came , Dying as we bornÂ 
Is this the natural state of mind ?Â 
Unanswered questions , using none of mind â¦
Compelled to understand , But â¦Â 
Despite all lived memoriesÂ 
Despite bloody criesÂ 
At the end , my last words standing :Â 
âthis is real lifeâ
