Smells soury , seems browny
(I) canât remember before
The noise and calamity
Fragments of my mind call me
Somethings living had to be â¦
An end pulled this ruins down
Vast land where the coloursâ gone
Coloursâ gone â¦
I remember something now
Worldâs created , wholly divine
Someones used to live there
With no honesty and kind mind
(Itâs) not hard to find out
How a being could do this
Ambition , anger and fight
(Had) replaced understanding
Slaves of desires
Masters of the lanses
Despite (to) drink âkevserâ
Blood was main feeding
They were fed by blood â¦ By Blood â¦
Now I can say that clearly
Mankind reached that finally
I think this is the end expected
âexpect the unexpectedâ
But every end is a new beginning
Is a chance to write lost foreword
Of the unfaithful dead ending
Futureless acts were the cause of the end
In any guilt , anyone behind to stand
The end will be a new beginning
And will be a chance to write evident foreword
Of the fine expected days coming
Future lies through so plainly
Chance to give up same mistakes
I think this is the chance expected
âExpect in this wayâ
At anytime , in anywhere
In no way whatsoever
Mankindâs gotta know certainly
âThere wonât be a new beginningâ
