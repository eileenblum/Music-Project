[with respects to Thomas Stearns Eliot]

Between the plan and the truthÂ 
Between the state and the actÂ 
Falls the shadow and the hypocricyÂ 
Among the existence and (the) natureÂ 
Between the thought and the spokenÂ 
Falls the shadow and the sneakness
Not to be aware of these â¦Â 
Living (in) this way isÂ 
Propping up (the) devilÂ 
Consenting (as) normal isÂ 
Being (a) part of evilÂ 
Not to be aware of these â¦Â 
Not to be aware of these â¦
We are the hollow menÂ 
We are the stuffed men, leaning togetherÂ 
Headpiece filled with straw and dirtÂ 
Donât step into favor
No need to search the devil anywhereÂ 
Standing on your left shoulderÂ 
But donât forget the (other) one on the rightÂ 
He is always following your kind fight
Tell your wayÂ 
Left or rightÂ 
Choose your colourÂ 
Black or whiteÂ 
Till the answers will be clearedÂ 
The hollow will not dissappear
We are the hollow menÂ 
We are the stuffed men, leaning togetherÂ 
Headpiece filled with straw and dirtÂ 
Donât step into favorÂ 
Not to be aware of these â¦
Not to be aware of these â¦
We are the hollow menÂ 
We are the stuffed men, leaning togetherÂ 
Headpiece filled with straw and dirtÂ 
Donât step into favor
If we want to stuff the holeÂ 
In life weâve gotta hold our roleÂ 
Only way is Right and White
Where shadows donât hide
