Come to the cryptic tombs, hear their call
Fire rises up high from the mouth of Hell
Strong as iron and steel I attack with hate
Dark legions in service of Satan strike with lethal fate

Destroy sons of Christ - Attack sons of Christ

Rise of the sharpest blade, prepare for war
Lords of the Heathen ones grant us might
With pride we stand up strong, claim our ways
Strike of the morning star obliterates

Destroy sons of Christ - Attack sons of Christ

Exterminate them, annihilate them, exterminate them, annihilate them

Destroy sons of Christ - Attack sons of Christ

March to the sounds of war soldiers of Satan
March to the sounds of lightning sons of Thor
Power of fire and ice inverts the cross
Blood runs down the hills from synagogues

Destroy sons of Christ - Attack sons of Christ
