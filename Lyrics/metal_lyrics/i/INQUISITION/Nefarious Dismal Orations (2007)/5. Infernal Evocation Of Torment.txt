Beneath the battlefields burns the fire of the ancients
I call upon the demons Abbadon, Berith and Satan

As the blaze of the ancient cult burns the enemy with hatred
"Holy trinity of God I trample on your faces"

Cryptic tombs in the earth open for the lambs of Jesus
Morning star in the sky... shine upon the earth your forces
Big as a moon, bright as a star, strong like the wind I kill you
To you I bring this ritual - Infernal Evocation Of Torment

As the blaze of the ancient cult burns the enemy with hatred
"Holy trinity of God I trample on your faces"

Dark flames of the blackest thrones illuminate the skies of a crescent moon
Like the sea with titanic waves enemies of God will sink you
