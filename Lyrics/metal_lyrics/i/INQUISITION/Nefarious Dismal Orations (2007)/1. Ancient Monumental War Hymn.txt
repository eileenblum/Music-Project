Satan I invoke
Lucifer I call
Berith one of war
Hymns of battle roar!

Flesh of Christians rip
Blood of feeble drip
Bones are burnt to ash
All in name of Satan

Realm of Christ will fall
Underworld shall rise
Reign upon the light
Ancient rite of war...

Beast of fire speaks
Hell's gates open wide
Death of holy sons
Sacred graves open
