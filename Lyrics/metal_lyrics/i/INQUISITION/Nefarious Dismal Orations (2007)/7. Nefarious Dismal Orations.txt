Master Satan, king of Inferno
Whisper to me spells that annihilate

Black goat urine fills a human skull
Menstrual black blood drips on the altar

Candles of black made from human fat
Infants crucified, throats cut, skin peeled

Nefarious dismal orations... magical words of the elite
Nefarious dismal orations... gather, stand and hail
Nefarious dismal orations... the sound of Satan's cult
Ancient rites of passage as the members sing
Black nocturnal skies embrace the full moon light
Now I sing to masters that obey my call... await!
