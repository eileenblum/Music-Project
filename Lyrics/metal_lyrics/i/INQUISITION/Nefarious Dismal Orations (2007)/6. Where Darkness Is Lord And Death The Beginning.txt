Melancholy moan of mystic wind
Melodies of sadness that sing the hymn
Towers casting shadows over graves of loan
Fire on the torches now dies with gloom
Walking on a path of lonesome doom
Silence of a night when death arrives
Travel through the tunnel when life shall end...
Never finding light at the end.

Symphony plays... music of the dead and darkness sings
Funeral chants... wicked lord of song and words of sorrow
Pagans dance... holding black torches as a symbol of death
Lonesome tomb... summons me to eternal realms
