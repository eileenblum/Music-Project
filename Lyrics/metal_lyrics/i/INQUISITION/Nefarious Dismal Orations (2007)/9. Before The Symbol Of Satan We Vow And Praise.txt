Praise the symbol of Satan's might, bow before the darkest light
Hold the torch and chant with pride, as the bells chime tonight we rise

Dancing in shadows, casting dark spells where the holy ones hide
Mystical fire, shining on the altar of the ancient king
Enter the cult, follow the ways of the left hand path
Trample on the cross, praise the pentagram and all Hail Satan

Bray the horns of shining bronze, songs for rites on full moon nights
Far in lonesome woodland realms stands the temple of the cult

Dancing in shadows, casting dark spells where the holy ones hide
Mystical fire, shining on the altar of the ancient king
Enter the cult, follow the ways of the left hand path
Trample on the cross, praise the pentagram and all Hail Satan

On the darkest mountain peaks where the black winds carry me...
There I stand and sing this hymn to the sounds of infernal bells
