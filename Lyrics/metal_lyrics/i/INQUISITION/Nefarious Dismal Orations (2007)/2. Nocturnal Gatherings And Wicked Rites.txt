I am the one that is summoning thee through the powers and the forces of Satan
I am the one that is calling for rites for the gathering of holy burnings
Dark moon in the blackest skies I call upon your presence for wisdom
All in a circle of wicked rites, blood of the virgin shall drip tonight

Starlight from the cosmic sea shines upon the blood soaked altar
Unholy fire that burns up high on the head of the ancient horned goat king
Pleasure of the sacrifice brings us might, strength of a beast we are given
All in a circle of wicked rites, blood of the virgin shall drip tonight

Lord in the heavens we deny, followers of you we despise
We are the ones born of fire, element of earth you must fear
Now is the time to worship death through the sacrifice of the holy bitch
All in a circle of wicked rites, blood of the virgin shall drip tonight
