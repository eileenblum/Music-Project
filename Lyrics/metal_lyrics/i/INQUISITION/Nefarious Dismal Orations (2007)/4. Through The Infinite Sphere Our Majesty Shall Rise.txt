Through the cosmos demons fly as a dark star killing light
Universe without an end opens gates that lead beyond
Oh! death take me now, may my soul become of dust

Majesty as old as time when beginning was the end...
Master of the ancient war where the angels fall below
Darkness of unholy kingdom - shadows of Lord Satan's throne

We of fire, wind and moon call to you
I am summoned to your realm where you rise as Lord of Hell

Chanting winds of burning skies moan forever
High upon spheres of glass our majesty shall rise again
