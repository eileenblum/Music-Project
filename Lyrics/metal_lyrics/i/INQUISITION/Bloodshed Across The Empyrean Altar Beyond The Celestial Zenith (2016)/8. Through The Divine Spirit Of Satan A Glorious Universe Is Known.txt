Through the darkness of skies and the aging of stars I shall rise as king
Flourish from the one I shall seize the sun, I am mighty as fire
I am chanting to thee, lord inferno and king, ignite the flame
Journey through stars is a journey afar in the cauldron of black

As the wisdom of one is the wisdom of mine, I raise the the flame
Cosmic bodies above floating like gods, masters of the gods
Serpent of the skies, lizard of the suns, thy creator of time
As I sign the pact and draw the seal I bleed for thee

So it is done as I summon the moon and grasp the sun
Water in my hand and soil from tombs for infernal pact
Fire fills the sky and lights the night as I chant the hymn
Oh powerful one, oh lord of supreme I hail thee
