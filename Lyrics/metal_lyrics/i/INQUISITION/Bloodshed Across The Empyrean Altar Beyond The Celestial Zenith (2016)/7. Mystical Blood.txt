Gates to the stars and mystical moons
Solitude spheres and flames of the sun
Tongues of the snake carry me far
Into the endless cosmic abyss

Lord of all power, secrets and law
Heaven and earth spawned by your blood
Darkness and light, seeds of the temple
Torches of Satan illuminate earth

Crown of the dark one on head of the goat
Claw of the eagle carries the soul
This is my temple, a forest in blackness
Enter the cosmos, vessel of death

Mystical blood... Mystical blood...
