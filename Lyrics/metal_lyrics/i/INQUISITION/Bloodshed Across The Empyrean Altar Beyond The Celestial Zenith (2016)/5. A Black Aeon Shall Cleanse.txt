Black serpent dragon soaring through the sky, dark ancient master of the night
Majesty of gold with poison for wine, from the abyss you shall rise

Aeon of the black star, age of the pharoh
Essence of the gods is shed with blood

Orbit from the south of Anzu, spawned from the waters of Abzu
fire breathing gods of the stars, planet in the path of their wings

Aeon of the black star, age of the pharoh
Essence of the gods is shed with blood

Blowing winds of the south storm at the rise of the first dawn
Demon wind for six days moaning for the six nights
Cleansing of an ancient race, deities of new beginning
Flooding the mortal ones, pyramids are rising

Aeon of the black star, age of the pharoh
Essence of the gods is shed with blood

Master, in your name drink the blood
Veil over the black moon falls with stars
Satan is the force that flies
Darkness is the light from the its throne
