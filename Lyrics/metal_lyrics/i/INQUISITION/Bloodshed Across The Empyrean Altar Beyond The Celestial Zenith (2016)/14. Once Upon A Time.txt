[originally by Typhon]There was freedom and life
Until the chains were bound
And the false prophets
Began to walk the land

Once upon a time

A dark lord came to show 
The way to fight the ones
Who bring slavery to the world
Under fire and blood
Satan's kingdom rises
And the words are spoken
To the ones that are chosen
To walk the land as kings

Once upon a time

The lord of lies were dead
The lord of flies is here
And dark becomes the light
To show us freedom and life

Men is free again
To live by his own instinct
To fulfill his desires
By the death of God

The holy trinity is no more
The lord of light is here
Lucifer arrives
To let us be kings again
