Shining stars in blasphemy
Moonless skies in the black

Element of earth, fire and wind
Raise from the ashes of the dying son
Rivers of blood flowing from skies
Cult of the stars where the third shines

Blackened winds, cosmic storms
...where the dragon flies to moons

Element of earth, fire and wind
Raise from the ashes of the dying son
Rivers of blood flowing from skies
Cult of the stars where the third shines

Kings of the rising sun - Lords of the fallen son
Temple of the blood red moon - Rising with the force of hate
Lord of the southern wind - keeper of the darkest tongue
Ocean of the poison gods - Venom of the gods arise

Born from the fire of Satan's sun
Wickedest of the blackest blood
Lord of all stars and the cosmic throne
Kingdom of fire and fire shall burn!

Lizard soars with wings of fire
Anunnaki, bird of heaven

Element of earth, fire and wind
Raise from the ashes of the dying son
Rivers of blood flowing from skies
Cult of the stars where the third shines
