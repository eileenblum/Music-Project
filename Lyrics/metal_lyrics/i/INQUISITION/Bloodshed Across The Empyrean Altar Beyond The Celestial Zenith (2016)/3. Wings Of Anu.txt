Satan's forces, one of dark skies
Into blackness with blind eyes
Wings of shadows from the heavens 
Craft of reptile blowing fire

Wings of Anu 
Wings of Anu

Oceans dying,mountains rising 
Stars are falling back to Earth
Solar eagle of creation 
Dropping life seeds into soil

Wings of Anu 
Wings of Anu

Gods, masters of light,Blood shall mix with the earth.
Lords, rulers of life. Flesh shall mix with the earth.

Creatures of the moonlight spawning from the life seed
Starlight shining wisdom, secrets of creation 
Those from the heavens went to the earth 
Planet of the reptiles, glory of the universe

Wings of Anu
Wings of Anu

Gods, masters of light. Blood shall mix with the earth.
Lords, rulers of life. Flesh shall mix with the earth.
