Far before
When time began
Those who came from heavens to earth
far before
When darkness shined
Those who came from heavens to earth

Far beyond
Where stars were born
Those who came from heavens to earth
Far beyond
Where creation dies
Those who came from heavens to earth

Blackest of cosmos, deepest horizons
Vortex of stars, spirals of fire
Distant lone star, fading away
Gods of creation igniting the skies
Moons of the planets, tombs of the sky
Streams from the poison gas clouds in cosmos
Craft of the gods like the black dragon
Flying through the portals, into the sun
