Voices of the dying stars
Choirs from the end of time
Hymns are sung to honor death
To the future it shall sing

Flesh, blood â mortal soul
Fire stars, master's soul

When the starless sky is open
In the real of cosmic time
Ash of bones are dust of stars
...to the stars my flesh returns

Flesh, blood â mortal soul
Fire stars, master's soul

...and the moon is red
...and the kingdom won
...with the force of Bune
Attack!

...and the moon is bright
...and the kingdom won
...with the force of fire
Attack!

Cosmic eyes is serpent's eyes

Universe of time and space
Fire reigns upon his throne
Where the universe is lord
Mortal's are the ash bones

Flesh, blood â mortal soul
Fire stars, master's soul
