Powers of destruction embrace me with might
For annihilation of the sacred king!
I am the fallen angel summoning his death
Abaddon, the one of war, I call upon his crown

Instruments of torture in the hands of sin
I tear the flesh off the face of god
Shadows from a crescent moon at night they speak...
Words that embrace me with powers from the abyss

King of th shadows
Mystical god
Give me the strength
Like the black winds
Oh! Abaddon!
Lord of all death
Give me the power
That you possess
