Strong mighty warriors of Satans cult arise
Now is the time to kill followers of Christ
Preachers of the Jewish faith must also meet their death
Gather all your weapons for the war against the light

Battlefields in churches is a vision we all have
And cutting off the head of every Jewisch Christian pig
They turn the other cheek and we give them death
Honoring our ancestors we give them our revenge

Abbadon, the ancient god of destruction and all death...
Is the one that is asking that we answer his wish
Sacrifice the lambs of God legions of black arts!
Satan shall feel proud that we help him reign on earth

Under mystic fullmoon skies we honor satans throne
In return for the worship we are given arms of war
Massacre the holy ones again and again
This is a battle that will never have an end

Warriors of Satan killing for their lord
Mutilated angels falling from the heavens
In the battlefield is where the truth shall be revealed
I stand in the pits of sulphur and fire
