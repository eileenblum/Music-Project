Sons of the God Satanas, lord of shadows,
Raise your left hand; give the sign of the goat!
I call upon demon thrones with these words:
"My blood is yours king of mine... Lucifer".

Black ritual knife in my hand held up high.
I cut my flesh; slash my neck and my wrist.
Oh! Shiny chalice slowly fills with my blood.
Oh! Death is near, take me now lord of shadows...

Dark mystic night sings, as I die songs that invoke fires form hell.
Grieving in pain I slowly bleed as I caress wounds in my flesh.
Enter my world of cryptic death; take your own life into the graves.
I am the one that summons thee... lord of the night, master of death.
