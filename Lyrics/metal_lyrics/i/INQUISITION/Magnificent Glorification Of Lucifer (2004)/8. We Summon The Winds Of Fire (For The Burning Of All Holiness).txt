Burning fire
From the depths of Hell
Your powers I invoke
With these words I chant...

Winds of fire; burn flames of Satan's realm
Destroy holy skies for the end of light

Open gates of Hell
I call upon your forces
Release your fire gods
Burn with pride the holy throne...

Winds of fire; flames of Satan's realm
Destroy holy skies for the end of light

Holy throne in ashes
Unholy throne supreme
Victory is in the fire
Fire is in our hands...
