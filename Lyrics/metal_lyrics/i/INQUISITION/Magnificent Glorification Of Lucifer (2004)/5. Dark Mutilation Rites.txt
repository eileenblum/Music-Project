Unholy rites of blood and knives
Sell inflicted wounds for my lord of Hell

Altar calls my name; I shall summon my own death
Take my offer to you king of all kings

Far inside our temple black candles burn
Six inverted crosses hang on the walls

Mutilation now begins as the ancient cult chants
I cut my flesh in the name of Satan

Cut, cut, so deeply cut, drain your life for me
High above the cosmic sky, thrones of black await
Far below the black soiled earth, thrones of fire await
Cut, cut, so deeply cut, give your soul to me
