Wisdom of darkness lies in the shadows
Mystical fire burns on your black torch
Star in the night sky, brightest of all stars
Son of the morning shining unholy

Fallen from heaven rebel of angels
You are my ruler, lead me to your throne
Speak to me master, teach me your secrets
Follow the left hand path into Hell's fire

Chanting to my lord as he looks at me
I obey his words in return for strength
To Him I remain loyal to the cult
Hail Lucifer... Hail Lucifer
