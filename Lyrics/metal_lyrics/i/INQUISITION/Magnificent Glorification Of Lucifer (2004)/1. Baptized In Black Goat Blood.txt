Baptised in black goat blood on the mystic altar
Infernal gods of death bless thy sons of Satan

Raise the knife; cut the goat, drain its blood
and fill the chalice

Ancient words are spoken as the rite begins
Members of the cult raise their torches high

Raise the knife; cut the goat, drain its blood
and fill the chalice

The moon is full... the night is cold... the stars are bright... the wind so moans...
A fire burns... within our forest... the blood is thick... and only black

Baptised in black goat blood on the mystic altar
Infernal gods of death bless thy sons of Satan
