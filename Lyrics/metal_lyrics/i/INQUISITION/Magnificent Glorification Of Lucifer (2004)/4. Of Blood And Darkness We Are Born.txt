Members of the cult
Circle of the elite
Raise your head high
With satanic pride

Fire burns in our name, sons of darkness, brotherhood of Satan
As lone wolves in the forest we shall walk together in shadows
Left hand path to Hell guide us far where wisdom lays
We seek truth and knowledge, grant us this and we shall honor

We are born from blood
We are born from darkness
We are strongest of strong
We are Satan's sons
