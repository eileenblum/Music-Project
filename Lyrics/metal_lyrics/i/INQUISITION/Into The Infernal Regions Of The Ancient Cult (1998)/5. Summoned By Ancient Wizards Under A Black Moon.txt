Rituals in the night under black moon skies.
I will open gates of unknown time.
I will breathe my fire towards the cosmic eye.
In the crypt shadows sounds of black arise
Immortality I seek.
Winds of death, thrones of black
Call the ones as I chant
Far beyond the end of space
I invoke the voice of time
Summoning ancient gods
Raising the torches high
Master of all black arts give my
Soul the wings
Far before all time, far beyond all time
I shall fade away in the fire realm below...
Stars that hide
Endless time summoned by wizards
Moon demons hear the call
Eternal black thrones await
Infinite I am an endless
Like eternal flight through the cosmic sea
Moon and stars of night I shall worship thee
You have granted me immortality of life
Here in kingdoms of shadows eternity
Remains dark and true... Roam through realms of truth.
More ancient than time I am for I have no life of flesh...
Death lives in time
Mystic melodies of cryptic winds,
Carry the voices of
Fallen tears... Fly, high, OH!!
Fly through stars of red fire, I fly beyond light.
Total pagan worship at night
Wizard voices summon moon skies
Eclipse enshrouds ancient woodlands
Mighty shadows flocking black wings
I am thy one summoned by thee
Cosmic body grant me immortality.
