Hidden secret sabbat summoning my name
On my way to satan to give the kiss of shame
Flaming pagan fire burning high at night
Wild copulation in the fullmoon light
Atmosphere so wicked as the mass begins
Deep inside the forest
Where the dark lord reigns
I renounce the god of the christian faith
I deny the virgin and trample on the cross
OH!! Master grant me your knowledge
OH!! Master grant me your power
Take me and teach me your ways
I will serve you forever
With my human blood I sign my secret name
In the book of shadows I will now remain
Invocvation chanted standing in a circle
In the name of satan ceremony ends.
