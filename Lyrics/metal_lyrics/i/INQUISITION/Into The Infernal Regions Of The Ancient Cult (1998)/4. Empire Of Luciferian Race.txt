Rise... pagan ones
Rise... satans sons
Rise... shields and swords
Rise... sounds of war
Destroy realms of light
Burning heavens throne
Reigning ancient ways
New world here to stay
Satan lives, satan lives,
Satan lives, satan lives.
Rise... red eyed beast
Rise... fullmoon god
Rise... black abyss
Open seven gates
Stand high knowledged ones
Fire summons thee
We are thy new breed
Satan lives, satan lives,
Satan lives, satan lives.
Legions marching
War drums beating
Weapons striking
Christians falling
New world reigning
Pagan victory
In the name of satan, lucifer and baal
Hail the ancients and their mighty realm
I raise the torches flaming high above
Lord of nature I worship thee.
