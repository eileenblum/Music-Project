Gathered in a magic circle singing ancient hymns
In the name of satan.
Bring me to the mystic lands mighty prince of
Hell for I seek the power.
Cosmic guardiance of the stars is the path
I worship for my pagan journey.
Sounds of moaning winds blowing through
The skies of eternal black.
"Worship - Satan - Worship"
Witches soaring through the skies to the streams
Of hell from belial's cult.
Rites of carnal lust in the ancient caves,
Goat on the altar bray.
Killing on the pentagram draining all the blood
As the victim weeps.
Lord of wickedness we summon you shedding
This childs black blood... bleed!!
Blessed in the fire of night, Lucifer I serve.
Hail!! Oh mighty one!! With this kiss of shame.
Marked with your claw, chalice fills with blood.
Gates, open wide, offer me your flames.
