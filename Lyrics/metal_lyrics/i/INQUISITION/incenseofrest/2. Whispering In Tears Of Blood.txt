Scream of hate dooming,
rising sun is falling,
fading eyes are bleeding,
tears of blood are dripping.
A massive voice - A weeping cry,
Satan speaks - Angels cry,
God of light - Forever gone,
freezing storms - dying lands.
"Scream for me as I bleed for you;
live inside my shadows. So here I am
to possess my land, my land, my land
of golden damnation."
No sun, no light.
Chanting souls above hypnotize.
