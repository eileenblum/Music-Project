I hear a scream within the misty fog. I see the
lights of the gods of total end of time. I am alone
freezing in the eternal sleep, come to me and bleed
upon the throne of dawn.
Sing for me gods of the ancient skins, lonely wizard
within the woods. Darkened face has taken my 
eternal wish, now I bow and await. I am granted 
mighty dark wings for flight, infernal power, 
infernal crown. Now I?m god, god of the darkest 
skies, I fly away to the bells.
Labasu - Come to me,
Namtaru - Awaken me.
