River to Hades, I look for you. Mighty dark wings,
guide my voice. Ancient Charon,
hear my cry. Save me from the son of light.
Dancing spirits respond my call. God
of darkness takes my souls. Sing thy 
song of victory. At last I rest, towards,
Hades I float.
Voyage of souls - Incense of rest.
Voyage of souls - Mystic hymns cried.
