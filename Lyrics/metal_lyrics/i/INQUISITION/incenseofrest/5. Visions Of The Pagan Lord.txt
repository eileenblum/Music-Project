Dark sky above awaits my cry of the sacred hymn.
One thousand souls are calling me. I give no answer.
The god above has prepared the gates bound
in iron chains. In pain mysouls rises blind of 
sense, I hear no sound.
Kingdom in flames surrounds the chants of the 
arrival. A blury haze, a shiny path, a mystic 
voice. I am guided by the voice on the shiny path 
in the never ending tunnel. At the end of the tunnel
I see a beast. He speaks to me...
"Your human spirit haw now arrived at the end
of the silver path. Thy soul shall burn in eternity.
Choose my path of blood and pleasure, and you
shall be saved from the eternal flame."
