Through cosmic chaos, through burning stars, abyss horns now bray.
The dark is calling infernal beings on paths of fire
The valleys open where mountains rise and winds are moaning
A past is hidden where moon rays shine like astral light

"Deep in the shadows wings take to flight through clouds of chaos where stars die."

The kingdom closes through which I fly as darkness opens
Our Earth has opened as lunar craters become infernos
As ancient hymns call I sing the song in caves of sorrow
The echoes wander with lifeless moan as horns are braying.

"Deep in the shadows wings take to flight through clouds of chaos where stars die."
