Far in the night sky a path is born
Stars form the path
and carry my soul
Cosmic fire of the stars I ride
High I rise as a master of skies

Lonesome realm where the
spirits are dust
Poison clouds are the breath of
life

Tunnels of death are invisible wings
Mystique moons are floating tombs

Black cosmic sea, I sing to
thee
Open the path, oh! Majesty

Infinite universe as
silent as death
In this coffin I lay to rest

Astral
bodies guide me to the throne
Now I have joined the cosmic
crypts

Black cosmic sea, I sing to thee
Open the path,
oh! Majesty
