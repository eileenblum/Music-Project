Cosmic invocation rites summon ancient war
Members of the ancient cult chanting to the stars
Demons of unholy ones gather upon our call
Powers from the stars above give us strength of fire

...burn!

Journey through the tunnel eye on the path to moons
On the lonesome worlds of dust solar rays shine
Flying through the rays of death rising as a king
Satan, you, I call upon... spirit of my soul.

...rise!

Cosmic realm - Satan's eyes
Endless black - where light dies

Falling stars - Satan's rise
Magic rays - burn with might
