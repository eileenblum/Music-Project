Black mountain silent winds here I stand in the lonesome lands
Bright sun wheel in the sky spinning the cosmic realm
Demon of the golden star flock your wings for me to ride
I await your rays of light, Lucifer the one of light
Black are the heavens of the trinity
Demons of fire I speak to thee
Forces of Satan carry me
Fire winged demon flies away free
