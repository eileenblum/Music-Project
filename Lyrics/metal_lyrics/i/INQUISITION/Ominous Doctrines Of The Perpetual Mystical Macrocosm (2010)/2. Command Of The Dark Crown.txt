Wind and fire of the cosmic eye
Take me to where the wisdom lies
Ancient crown of the blackest thrones, grant me power of fury and death
Crystal gods I smash with might by command of the crown
I serve King and prince of the black abyss, rise up high as I sing your song
Under skies of a moonless night torches burn with a mystic glow
Deep in the forest where spirits roam demons speak in their ancient tongues
Blood from the heavens now drip to earth filling the soul with virgin blood
On this mountain of dismal peaks, horns are brayed for the heathen one
