Wraith / oh! Cryptic One I see - black / the veiled one chanting near
Bray high songs of death, call tombs where they hide
Sad dark hymns in the air, black - the covered one roaming near
Winds chant songs of death, graves deep, open wide
I roam through somber woods, death, the shadow one in the mist
Wings flock to my crypt, I fly to my throne
