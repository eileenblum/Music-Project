Rise of the fire cult through cosmic eyes
Moon has arisen as a king
Those of the fire realm summon your name
Songs for the doctrines and the cosmic sea

...for the mystical ones I sing

Trance of the masses through astral light
Sounds of war drum soars through skies
Rites of the temple honoring stars
Mystic chanting to lords of night

...for the mystical ones I sing

Intro doctrines of the cosmos
Black hole portal consumes all light
Roam through black paths in your journey
.. Deep within the macrocosm
