Lonesome moon, silent tomb
Darkness holds magic veils

Fly... fly into the winds of stars
Rise... rise above the cosmic seas

Lifeless skies joined by mass
Maze of black, force unseen

Where... where the caves of death embrace
Rites... rites through mystic astral planes

Fly... fly into the winds of stars
Rise... rise above the cosmic seas
