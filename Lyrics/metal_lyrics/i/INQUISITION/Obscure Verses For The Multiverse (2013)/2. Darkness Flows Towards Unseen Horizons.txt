Ancient mystic kingdom
Mystical sphere
Music of the cosmos
Launching as spears

Sounds on the horizon
Blasting in the skies
Spirits of the cosmic
Battlefields in mist

Universe of Satan
Universe of all
Flowing massive darkness
Energy that flows

Far into the eternal
Unseen horizons
Only through the cosmic eye
Knowledge will arrive

Rising
Dark one
Honor
Satan

Pillars of the temple
Crumble with fear
Towers of the golden horns
Blowing hymns of war

Blood of the unholy
Casting rays of light
Ride upon the beams of light
Truest one
