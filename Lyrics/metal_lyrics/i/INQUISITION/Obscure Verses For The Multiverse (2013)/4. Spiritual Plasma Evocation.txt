Rising as a king, flying through the blackness
Echoes of wicked screams soaring through the starlit skies

Rays of hate from Satan's eyes, curse of death to you I cast
Drink the serpent's venom seed, fall now you doing one

Majesties of moonless skies
Spirit of the darkest one
Master of the golden sun
...evocation rites of death

Chanting to the darkest one
Summoning the fallen son
Master Satan rise as king
...rays of plasma now attack

As the fire fills the sea
Poison vapors carry me
Thrones of mystic ones shall rise
...rays of plasma now attack
