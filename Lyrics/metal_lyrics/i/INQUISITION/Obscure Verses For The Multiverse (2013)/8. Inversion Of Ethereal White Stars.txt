Rise above the mystical ones
Shining throne that ignites the skies
From its life shall come its death
I invoke the inversion of stars

Astral songs are the hymns of war
Mass of black energy reigns
Through the holes of cosmic worms
Like a god in the valley of moons

Black sun rays of the throne - lord of the eternal fire
Black shadow of the skies - king of the ancient star

As I chant to the primal night
Wizards mourn to the ending of times
White stars fall through the cosmic eye
Golden horns now bray up high

Black sun rays of the throne - lord of the eternal fire
Black shadow of the skies - king of the ancient star
