Blackest skies where you shine
Greatest one, lord of stars
Spewing from the dragon's mouth, flowing ancient cosmic sea
From the ancient text you read verses for the multiverse

Streams of fire, new creations
Portal open, lord arises
From dimensions where you came, ruler of creations key
On thy head a golden crown, high upon a throne you reign

Only darkness in the skies
When you came, light was shined
Wisdom from cosmic snakes of dimensions you create
Spawning humans as a slave serving kings of astral thrones
