Moons of titans, dead black sphere
Lord of skies, silent altar
Esoteric floating tomb
Like a shroud of the heavens

In the shadows of its craters
On the mountains of its ruins
Solar rays carve its valleys
Endless graves reign in caves

Raise the Chalice!
Strong as lightning is the force
Gravitation... force of gods
Invocation of its mass
As a spirit floats and mourns

Raise the chalice!
