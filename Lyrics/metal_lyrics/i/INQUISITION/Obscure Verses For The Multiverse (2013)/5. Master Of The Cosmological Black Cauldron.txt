Demon of unholy mystic black force
Lord of the black holes open your gates
Majesty I worship dominate with fury
Master of cosmos, king of all kings

Valley of the shadows boil from fire
Rays from the black goat shine like a chalice
Leader of the reptiles, spirit of the cult
Rise to the glorious cauldron of stars

Satan, demon star... highest of the gods
Wisdom from your light, power from the dark

Fire in my open hands
Burning all the holy sons
Serpent of the crimson flame
Spitting venom from his throne

Chanting to the darkest force
Striking bells of cosmic doom
Energy of mystic songs
Music for the stars

Ancient wisdom from the moons
Reigning over feeble ones
Lucifer the Universe
Universe the eye

Matter of the darkest one
Skeletons of dust
Constellations are the sign
Reigning over holy ones

Satan, demon star... highest of the gods
Wisdom from your light, power from the dark
Journeys I shall seek through your portal soul
Forests in the skies gleaming towards the abyss
