Enclosed in moral circles
Creating your scathing relations
According to distorted equations
Describing the material life phases
We create another future
We create another tomorrows
No, we don't share your feelings
Of somatic philosophy in decline
What one's as helical steel shackles
Laying heavily on that cheerless world
We're the myriad of deathlike torches
What ones are enlightening the chosen way
To your filthy future
To your filthy tomorrows
You're the paving of dead end street
Identically plushy filthy
As filthy your motives are
But we're an inversion of normality
Of this paralysed world
We've snuffed the candles out in your darkness
We create another future only
We create another tomorrows only
Forever you'll be enclosed in moral circles
Creating you dubious relations
According to your deformed, distorted equations
Describing the final phases of your poor existence
We want another future only
Therefore we snuffed your candles out
