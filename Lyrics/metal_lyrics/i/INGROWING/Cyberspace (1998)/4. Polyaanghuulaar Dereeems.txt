Clouds wound up the disintegrating bodies of world ghloookh
Strangle my travelling imaginary mind of translucent being beehebh
I stay between blind mirrors of two transient world and see
Myself in never ending deformed line of guileful copies
My body looses own palpable shape,
When with cells I imbibe into two-dimensional space
I imbue the nucleus base of universe,
When strange beehebh floods my malleable mild mind
I amalgamate with pellucid turbid complex
Of fallen albumen crystals and turn to damaged key to existence
Through the gate of world ghloookh I penetrate
Into the new dimension of chaos, slowly ingrowing to flesh
I turn to stalk tossing in gusts of protoastral corona,
Disrupting my polyangular dreaming
Lost among the crystals of pure distilled planetary evil
I will never find the right way to myself
Clods is still wound up the disintegrated bodies of world ghloookh
Strangled my travelling imaginary mind of ethereal beehebh
I die between the mirrors of two transient worlds when I saw
Myself in never ending deformed line of guileful copies
