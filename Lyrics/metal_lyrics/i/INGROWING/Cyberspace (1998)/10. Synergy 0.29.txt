Soiling ... thee keopaa
And undying
Toiling ... my keopaa
And hating
Deflated slag of unnecessarity
Undimensional being
Fills the nebular dust
In defuncted multiverse
The sleeping micro worlds
Â´re spinning round each other
Dreaming about lysergide wisdom
Right as you did ...
I turned to link
Binding your paranormal keopaa up
Right as you did ...
Addicted to synergy 0.29
You live on the base of petrobiological joke
Right as I did ...
Really sick ineptitude
All what dehumanised is, will succumb too
Right as we did ...
Vanity, merely vanity
Unseen in synergic mirror
My face's hidden in the air
Obstructed with emptiness
So strange rigid specimen
A cono-cardium in your alter ego
Floating in lysergide elation
Right as you did ...
I turned to link
Binding your paranormal keopaa up
Right as you did ...
Addicted to synergy 0.29
You live on the base of petrobiologial joke
Right as I did ...
Really sick ineptitude
All what dehumanised is, will succumb too
Right as we did ...
Synergy 0.29 ... where is my keopaa?
Keopaa 0.29 ... where is, so where is it?
Keopaaean synergy ... here is point of 0.29
Black point of synergy ... that is untrue keopaa
