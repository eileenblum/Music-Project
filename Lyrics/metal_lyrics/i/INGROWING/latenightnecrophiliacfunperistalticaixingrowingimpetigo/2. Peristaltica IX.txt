Protoplasmic prolapse of sun beams
With emetic taste of celestial sickness
Hidden with obscene nebula of dehumanized corium
Repulsive, swollen and lasciviously phantasmic

In the livid shine of extinct stars

In atomized abdominal cavities of eviscerated worlds
Deceptively we seek for everything we can defile and rape
In the vortex of dead tissue and frenzy coital movements
So quiet and unsteady inside the putrescent harmony

Dumb of sensesÂ´ massacre dread...

Malice of our scalpels deep in wide open gashes
Maiming the quasilinear structure of ethereal life
Turns into the broken part of intergalactical vital fluids gore
Pulped by peristalsis of perforated solar innards

Dying in products of own decomposure

Final tokens of gutting orgasm of celestial mechanics
In hungry ecstasy transfer their disassembled, excreted torsos
To perfidiously gulping mouth of deflated human virtue
To complete the process of that bloody coprophagous recycling

In its insidious synoptic shape

Peristaltica... [Chorus:] IX
Be regurgitated and devoured again...
Peristaltica... [Chorus:] IX
Be alpha and omega to yourself...
Peristaltica... [Chorus:] Peristaltica
