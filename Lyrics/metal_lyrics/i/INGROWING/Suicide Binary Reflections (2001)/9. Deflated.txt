look into the emptiness among dimensions
is that a graceful spectacle, isn't it?
the time changes its shape here, weightless, flexible
deflated physical is not so onerous right now
deflated...
fading...
coloured...
iridescent...
look into the deflated polyangular time
into the innards of your own,
inflated fate
you are passing away
as all around us
welcome here in white light,
in the end of corridor
corporeality kiss goodbye...
