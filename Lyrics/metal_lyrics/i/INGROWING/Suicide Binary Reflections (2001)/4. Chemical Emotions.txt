maimed spectrum of human abilities
beaten, crushed, twisted...
succumbing to multifarious scale
of emotions that change their faces in lethal
pervaded with ice cold crystals of death
enticing, babing, humiliating...
you regurgitate all what human is
search for soft difference between
dream and hallucination
in glimmering haze of carbohydrate delight
floating, melting, dissolving...
your ideals, rejected forever, forgotten
desire of quiet unbeing now
controls your hesitating life
dark corridors of insidious chemical emotions
caressing, torturing, destroying...
where thoughts of love and beauty
... massacred... and never will awake
