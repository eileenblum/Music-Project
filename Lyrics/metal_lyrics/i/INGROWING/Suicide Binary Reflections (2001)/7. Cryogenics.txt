hibernaculum...
freezing...
cryogenics...
sonorous...
cooled down we sleep in dream of another worlds
whereas ice coldness caresses our soulless bodies
unwary strike to scatter us is quite enough
crystalically frozen consciousness
are filling surreality around
the long journey to place of our final rest
our cryo tray tossed with cosmic winds
frozen to the bone, unperceiving, sunken in ice dreams
only water vapours condensating on our eyelids
rigorous faces, so cold, motionless, with no life
derelicts who try to find their homeworld
we're laying peacefully in cold cryo capsules
