imprisoned in the time warp
lost among worlds far away
we are like derelict vessel
scattered to nebular nothingness
hyperspace souls
you meet them everyday
no despair...
some day you'll join them
yes you will...
hyperspace souls
light like inverse sun
don't hesitate...
and try
the bitter taste of their being
so try...
hyperspace souls
blind light of perpetual trouble
darkly shines on our keopaa 0.29
we can see the dreadful mission
objectives
there's no return,
there's no escape
