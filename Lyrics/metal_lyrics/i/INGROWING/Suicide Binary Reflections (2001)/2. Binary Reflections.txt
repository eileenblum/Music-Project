obsessed with death, sinking in depressions
cruising your face with shard edges
trapped in net of emetic taste
consciousness of reflectionsÂ´ infinity...between two mirrors
unseen in dying corporeality
your blood will be our
living tissue grows through the looking glass
to crush own reflection is enough
life flows through fissures of mirror
where image of your soul is missing
thousands of eyes scrutinize and wait
... between two mirrors
possessed with life, with cut throat through
broken mirrors accuse to infinity
bloody veins veil your mind
when in tangle of binary reflections
... you're directed at among us
binary reflections
imprisoned truth among mirrors
binary reflections
let distort the reality to postmortal surreality
binary... reflections
binary... reflections
