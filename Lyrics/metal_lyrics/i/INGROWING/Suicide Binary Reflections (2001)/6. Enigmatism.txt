snared with graceful shapes of your body
my mandala on wet skin i outline
you are so fascinating in ethereality
as an anatomised jigsaw puzzle
the last piece remains to place
you are my enigma
this is my strange sensesÂ´ declaration your body i reverence,
it's my religion
my mystic enigmatism...
in tangle of bodies
the figure we are
what is carved into sullen sand
say your prayer of mondenity
be my drop of mercury
where my real face i will see
youÂ´ re that enigma...of my answer...
you're my religion...
my enigmatism...
