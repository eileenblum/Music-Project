intersecting virtual lines
in looking glass polyedre
stealing a part of you
ethereality section of your mind
connecting senses in infinity
of malevolence richly i feed
grim recitals conduct the section edge
there's no place for biblical parable
celestial perversity celebrates its triumph
all mantras of world are completely useless
i carve and outline the enigmatic sigills
to plane of your ethereality section
desperate cry in celestial sphere
translucid through mirror polyedre
sounds like innuendo of ethereality section
ethereality section...
of polyangular dreams...
ethereality sections...
of cyberspace...
floating through me...
