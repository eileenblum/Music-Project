imbued with the hallucinations of existence vapours
we construct a melody of dehumanized despair's torso
and in breathless shapelessness of ethereal miasma
we sate the synthetic desire of multi-structural tissues
we are like dumb musical instruments
unearthly beef interwoven with shinning tubes
softly resonate
carnal flutes in time fragments
share quiet tones
fuga macabri
we resound the unreal earthflutes with our deceases
we are part of them
and steel's malevolence on our bodies is emollient now
we are the same as they are
voiceless, silent, faithful, but incoercible...
living aggregate with clear intentions behind the multiverse limits
digitalized binary emotions
snatched in flesh and blood
showing climactis emptiness in intruding waves of tones
we are just only beautiful,
unnecessary equivalent of biomechanized ethereal flutes
in symphony of universe
