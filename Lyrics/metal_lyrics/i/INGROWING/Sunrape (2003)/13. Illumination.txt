Silently levitating sphere
Full of life and energy
It is my sourcery
Of all I love
In that paralysed dimension
Of my homeworld

Illuminationâ¦ Emanation
Irradiationâ¦ Illumination

Tender light flows
Slightly illuminating the dark around
I have all what I want to take with me
On the way with no return
I am a light bringer
A Venus in black of funereality
I bring my own soul
Imprisoned in that sphere
I feel the Light
Floating among my fingers
My mind is an illumination
I am that illumination
