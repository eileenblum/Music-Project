Protoplasmatic miasma
Trembling with fury
In manifestation of life
Parasitical protein affix
Thatâs what I cultivate

Excellent killer, a superb parent,
A perfect conqueror of my new world
The greatest lover, the best carnivore
Servant to make this world abhorrent.

Annelid cultâ¦ to infest the world
Annelid cultâ¦ my mirror of gore

Annelid DNA
Cuts through the human tissue
Like blood through glass fissures
Life of my unnatural pets flows
Through your powerless torsos
As your valueless lives to live you try
Your vitality will fade, my own will last
You are the germs of my new race
Of my Annelid cult.

Excellent killer, a superb parent,
A perfect conqueror of my new world
The greatest lover, the best carnivore
Servant to make this world abhorrent.

Annelid cultâ¦ to infest the world
Annelid cultâ¦ my mirror of gore
Annelid cultâ¦ to create more
Annelid cultâ¦ my genetic war
