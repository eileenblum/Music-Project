Lurking in darkness
Waiting for occasion
We are these who rape the Sun
Hidden in inverted definition
Until our task is done â¦

The darkness invertedâ¦
Deadly possessed
Life is rejectedâ¦
Binary resected

Breed of cyberwar
Invading your Underworld
Blowing out your candles of life
We are the 3D inversion horde
Infesting germs, a caustic fireâ¦

Light is castratedâ¦
In darkness inverted
Till the Sun wonât be deadâ¦
And heavens bleed red
In our darkness invertedâ¦
