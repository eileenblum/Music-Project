Whipped out of grim reality
Sucked into the dreamy dimensions,
So dangerous
Straying in circles
Through that peaceful space
Banished from the Eden
Of fallen crippled angels

Feeling of condemnation,
You are bloody alone
Translucent hands invite you,
Come to us, come
Bloodless faces of surreality Auditors
Look straight in your head,
Under cranial bone

Whipped out of grim reality
Youâll be saved by your unseen guide
Secured, observed,
Attended âtill the end of way
This sorrow-paved path
Now I have to stride

Feeling of condemnation,
You are bloody alone
Erradicated of our lives
You for ever escape
Banished from that Eden
Of fallen crippled angels
Come, at last time, so donât be late

No. You arenât dead onlyâ¦
You are erradicated
No. You arenât dead onlyâ¦
You are abandoned
No. You arenât dead onlyâ¦
Itâs so easy to die
No. You arenât dead onlyâ¦
Whereâs the reason why?
