My weak, slackening bodyâ¦
Shadows, so malicious
My own flesh memoryâ¦
Iridescent miasma of insecurity
In that dazzling lightâ¦
Shaping my retina
I can see my own wayâ¦

To spectral passagesâ¦
My soundless steps lead
Free of corporealityâ¦
Eschatological nightmare no more
In shining tubular corridorsâ¦
By strange magnetism I am pulled
All earthly I leave behindâ¦
Right as you did before

My vanishing bodyâ¦
Shadows, so pleasant
My own soul memoryâ¦
Iridescent thread of wisdom
In soothing twilightâ¦
Of this afterlife labyrinth
I go my own wayâ¦

In spectral passagesâ¦
Here I find my resting place
Free of onerous corporealityâ¦
Free of pain, free of stress and fear
In shining tubular corridorsâ¦
I play with gentle magnetism
All earthly is so strange to meâ¦
Right as you do now
