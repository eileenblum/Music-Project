I have a mouth and I cannot speak
I have the eyes and I cannot see
I am dragged off to many places
At the same time
And nobody can find me there

Crushed to fragments
I speak to you
With language of the dead
Hidden in shards of mirrors
Hidden in lights reflections

I have the mouth and Iâd like to speak
I have the eyes and Iâd like to see
I want to escape
From these many places
Where I live forgotten, shattered
Lips in thousands places are scattered
I am a fragmented oracle of Keopaa
Imparting the messages of her
Try to find me
Everywhere and nowhere

Fragmented oracleâ¦
My mouth with no breath
Fragmented oracleâ¦
Of Keopaa polarised
Fragmented oracleâ¦
I am voice from beyond
Fragmented oracleâ¦
Of inverted ethereality
