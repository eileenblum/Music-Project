Nebularâ¦
Time webs tangled to each other
Nebularâ¦
Starsâ lives are as a second of eternity

Time webs tangled to each other
Hyperspace tissue goes high in depths
Of interstellar cycles with no end

Nebularâ¦ In collapsed cube
Of onerous physical
Nebularâ¦ Nebular phantasm floats
Quietly, you and me

In collapsed cube of onerous physical
We pass together day after day
In time warp
Vanity and sorrow is our idol,
Kneel down

Nebularâ¦ Digested by loneliness
Of dead starsâ graveyard
Nebularâ¦ We moan
For our Keopaa, now so sullen

Digested by loneliness
Of dead starsâ graveyard
We, misty hallucinations
Straying through deep space
We lament and cry
For our Keopaa the Nebular
