Exposed to the light
Dissolving in silent ethereality
Exposed to the light
Shine of menstrual sky
Is slowly fading out
Exposed to the light

With disintegration I am so excited
In pulsating waves I bleed

My homeworld collapsed
Nebular Keopaa turns off her face
I am not the Chosen One
Enslaved to eclipse

Exposed to the light
Exposed to the light

Tide forces of galactic apocalypse
Tear my body in inverted explosion
Devoured with inertia
Of stalking cataclysm
In array of self-defiling flagellants

Carving the lines of my mental veins
Into the hymen of celestial graveyard
After-death-veiled
With interstellar placenta
I am exposed to light

Exposed to the light
Buried with no funeral dirge
Exposed to the light
There's no lacrimation for me
Exposed to the light
My time-warp has come
Fear hearing my heart beating !

EXPOSED TO THE LIGHT !!!
