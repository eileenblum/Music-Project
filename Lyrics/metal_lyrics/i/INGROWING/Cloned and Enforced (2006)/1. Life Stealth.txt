Life!
Fragments and parts
All clues of your cheap life
Sampled, identified
Your world will end, weâre starting the strife

[Ref 2x:]
Stealing your life, thereâs none place we miss
Youâre our target to seizeâ¦
Stealing your soul, you are to disappear
Youâd worry or fearâ¦
Stealing your mind, itâs worse than infection
Copied resurrectionâ¦
Stealing your life, you canât face your fall
Thatâs sure for you allâ¦

Resurrectionâ¦
Or life stealth?
