A privileged section, a new among the clones
None of us is secure, they can steal who they want
Face of mine, face of you, faster than light reflection
Masters of espionage and annoying disinformation

Iâll kill you and youâll kill me, but thereâs no guarantee
If itâs lie or if itâs true, horrendous ability

Dâyou have a scratch? Well, Iâm gonna devitalize you
Trust is a relic and mistake should be fatal too..

CyClones assaultâ¦ perpetual imbroglio
A lethal chaosâ¦ hard times to undergoâ¦

Horrendous abilityâ¦ CyClones
Donât trust meâ¦ even I am not so sure
Fake and versatilityâ¦ CyClones
I canât trust youâ¦ Or are you sure?
