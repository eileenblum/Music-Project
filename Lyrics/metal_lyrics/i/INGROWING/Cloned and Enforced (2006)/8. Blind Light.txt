Perverted gleams of waning Moon
Cut mystic motives in bleeding clouds out
Beauty of laces is crushed into dust of phoenixes
Clinging to inspirating shapes of snow flakes

ThereÂ´s no sky ... Blind Light
ThereÂ´s no love ... Blind Light

Masquerade of dying starsÂ´sorrow
In chapped bark of winter trees in zenith
ItÂ´s mere play in the edge between worlds only
Worlds, which are diffused into stones of eternal megaliths

ThereÂ´s no love ... Blind Light
ThereÂ´s no rules ... Blind Light

Silent whispers of silver blind lightÂ´s beams
In our parched skulls awake sonic implosions
Of desperate soft hate of broken human race
Kneeling in ominous sands of ruinous Time
