Stop the feeble moaning, itâs time to raise our heads
Reluct against terror, nation of expelled deads

Fight might be right, right will be our fight
Freedom is our light, fight might be right.
Now it has to comeâ¦ fight might be right
Our past lives are goneâ¦ fight must be right

Living on the edge of poor âto be or notâ
If arenât you ready, shook your head else nod
Fight might be right, right will be our fight
We live out of sight, fight must be right.
