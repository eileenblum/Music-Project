Clone casualties? None of clones will count the dead.
Human casualties? Reaper has his hands strained, dreadâ¦

But who am I?
I didnât meet my copyâ¦ even kill
I doubt about my originality
I feel like foreignerâ¦ thoughts so ill

Epoch of clones now ends, tabooed, banned
New day dawn soon will come, trying to understand whyâ¦

Day of the victory, our mankind is safe
But I think I am one, a clone, my deathâs postponed

Final deletionâ¦
I survived my deletion.

But who am I?
I didnât meet my copy
I doubt about my originality
I feel like foreignerâ¦ thoughts so ill

A cyclic end, history to flush
Thereâs one left to decimate
A cyclic end, my future is unknown
To join normal life, I have to procreate
