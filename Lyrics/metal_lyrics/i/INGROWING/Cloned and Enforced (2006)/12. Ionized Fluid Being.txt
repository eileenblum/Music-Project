Strange deformity of life
In threads of unearthly elements
I am flickering being of emptiness
In gaseous extract of existence

Ionized ... so far
Stabilized ... so close

My misty body slowly drops off
As amorphous time elapses here
In that inert glasstubular world
From where I canÂ´t escape or disappear

Atomized ... impure
Vaporized ... exposed

Ionized ... so far
Stabilized ... so close
