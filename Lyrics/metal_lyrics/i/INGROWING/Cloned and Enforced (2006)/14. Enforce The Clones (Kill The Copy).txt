Kill your fucking copy, enforce your fucking clone
Itâs not his perfect flesh or his precise unique bones
Crush your hated mirror trying to steal your face
Eradicate them, that earthly lifeâs disgrace

Letâs enforce the clones
Their blood is not yours
Deriding the God, raped Nature base
Sodomized human raceâ¦

Kill your fucking copy now
Final slaughter started, youâre not alone
Scatter cloned bodies, go!

Show no fucking mercy, their blood will turn to waste
An artificial cancer, eliminate all these deadly cells
Keopaa will lead our steps through warped genetic hell

Surviveâ¦ or not survive
Originals must be safe
Victoryâ¦ or low life
Mastermind by your chafe

Kill your fucking copy, enforce your fucking clone
Itâs not his perfect flesh or his precise unique bones
Crush your hated mirror trying to steal your face
Eradicate them, that earthly lifeâs disgrace
