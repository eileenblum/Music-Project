Cut, slit, rip, slash, cell industryâs art
Nanopuncturing the ovum ânâ fluttering bioshards

Canning the life into the vials and sterilized flasks
Penetrating all vital germs, a human copy unmasked
Tissue matrix soilure, a non-orgasmic way
Constructing an aprosopus, next sixth day

Nanopunctures, yes!

Punctures, nanopuncture futureâ¦
Puncture, nanopuncturesâ¦
