Sexual liquidation of body problems
Wait for an orgasm in false time
You hate the look at stretched girl's thighs
All manifestations of love make you sick
You don't want to live with feelings subjugation
You don't want to sniff excited woman smell
Every excitement burns like tire iron
You find the place only among mattresses
Try to work out you own feelings trouble
Try to doom the instinct of self-preservation
Love is fuckin' stupid problem only
Which don't make you're thinking
Liquefied self-control...
Spermatic explosion...
Absolute self-grafitying
You idiot!!!
