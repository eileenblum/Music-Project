Brain - coldness passes over you
you can't control your own moves
as shadow on the wall you're missing
When the inner light burns your mind
Physical remains ... only soul survives
Bestial demency ... foulness of life
You're similar to the old gray statue
Every move pains like megabrutal whipping
Every word makes a noise like empty can
In your blocked head you try to find some sense
Physical remains ... only soul survives
Bestial demency ... foulness of life
Black wings of idiocy closed your eyes for ever
Violet reality insidiously attacks your mind
You try to hide back yard of your consciousness
All sings of reality make you stupid laugh
Physical remains ... only soul survives
Bestial demency ... foulness of life
