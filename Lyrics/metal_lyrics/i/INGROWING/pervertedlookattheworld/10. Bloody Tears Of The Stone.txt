Massacred human souls
Impassive lapidary
I lend my own perverted art
For heroic portrait of the human pain
I will cut the twisted lines
To describe the boundless suffer

It will be masterpiece among the statues
I get off a humanity of figures by chisel
Twisted faces feed my mad zest for creating
Hunger scum, despair I close into a stone

Derision for deads by gravel requiem
Barbarously I crush these vexed faces
You shed stone tears, ashes to ashes
My morbid art none will see again
But alas, my eyes're seeing the blood
I created and foil a living dread statue
