Shattered mental line
Yards of torn thoughts
Futile trying to unite them
When you want to word them to acts
You're destroying yourself
Needle in vein is your motor

Bitter waves are sinister flooding
Your mangled and crushed ego
You're sinking in own doubts
You wade through cadaverous haze
Like a vulture circles over carrion
The funeral of your own ideals
