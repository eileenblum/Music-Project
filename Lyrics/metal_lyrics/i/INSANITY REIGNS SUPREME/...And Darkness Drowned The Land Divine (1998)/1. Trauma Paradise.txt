Eternity is the remnant
Of a passion long gone by

I could die
In those timeless moments
Drowning my mind
With overflowing bitterness

For what?

If we would have slaked us
On the shores
Of each others soul

Would that lustful memory
Outreach the stigma
Of my bereavement

Must this be
The poisoned heritage
Embedded in my soul

Is she the divine
Or diabolic intruder
Of my darkened sanctuary
