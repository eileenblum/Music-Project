As I cloak myself with sadness
I sacrifice my desperation
Upon the altar of insanity

This veil of tears comforts me
Like a river washing
Through the wounds
Dazed and numb it leaves me behind

But soon these feelings of anguish
Enstrangle me anew
"Nothing lasts forever"

Mourning causes me to feel
The feepening sorrow
Spreading from within
Forcing me to succumb to the pain
That flows from the awful truth
Tarnishing my emotions

I feel the all embracing sore
Respite fills up my torn heart
Leaving me in the arms of solitude
