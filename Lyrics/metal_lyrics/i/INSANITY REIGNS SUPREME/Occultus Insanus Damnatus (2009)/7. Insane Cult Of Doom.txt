The old Gods are not dead
They live within us
We give them life, warm blood
And they keep us from death
That's our covenant, our promise

We don't worship the same gods, you and I
But we're more alike than you think

Together, we are keeping something alive
Something that has lived for thousands of years
Despite the wavering faith of mortal men

in an age long gone
Mortals dethroned the Gods
And seized the Heavens for their own

And for it
They were flung down
Into the world of clay
Their minds clouded by ignorance

Insane cult of doom

Only a bare few
Remember their birthright
If they cannot claim the Heavens
They will make their own kingdoms
Here on Earth

We possess the power to remake this world
