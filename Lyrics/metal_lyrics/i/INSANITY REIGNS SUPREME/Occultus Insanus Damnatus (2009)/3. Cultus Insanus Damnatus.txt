We stand before you as God regent
The formless cult and we are one

We have called thee
By thy name
Unspoken and ancient

In nomine magni dei nostri insanus
In nomine domini inferi

Fear not, we have redeemed thee
Thou art now ours

Ave
Tonight we are one
Ave
Tonight we go to war

See the Heavens open up
And behold our eyes of fire
Our robes dipped in blood
Our names, the words of God
Sathanas
