The soul of a beast within
The calling of a monster
All concealed within the skin of man
The serpent

incensum istud ascendat ad te
Domine inferus
Et descendat super nos beneficium tuum

How to live among the human herd
When instincts say
They are nothing but prey
A hunger like fire
Burn!

I am not some godless beast
Who stalks beneath
The dark grandeur of sanctity
I am the grandeur
I am sanctified

I am the son of the dragon blooded

The drinker of mankind
Arises from his sleep
He shall not rest but dream
