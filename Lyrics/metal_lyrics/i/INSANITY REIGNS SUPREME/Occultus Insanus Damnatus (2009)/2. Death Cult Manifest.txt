I am your new Satan
I am your God

I have lain in the Earth
I have walked the shadow
I herald the end of days
I am Satan cometh to flesh

I've looked upon the face of death that awaits
And have returned to life
Carry that knowledge with me

I take my rightful peace among them
And know fear no longer

I have ascended my own funeral pyre
I see death as the destroyer of life

There is no body, no flesh
No shell to comprehend
No boundary to live again
