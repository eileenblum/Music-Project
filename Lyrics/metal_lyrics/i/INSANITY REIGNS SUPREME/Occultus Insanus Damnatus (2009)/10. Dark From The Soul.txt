Lost beyond redemption
I stand alone
In this void
That swallows thee

Through the black
I hear the voices
Voices inside of you
Hungry for answers

The night seeps into my soul
And your eyes
They follow me
Unto the path
The path of darkness

Through the dark
My spirit
It wanders
Into the night

I embrace death
As she surrounds me
Ending this illusion
Finding the truth
