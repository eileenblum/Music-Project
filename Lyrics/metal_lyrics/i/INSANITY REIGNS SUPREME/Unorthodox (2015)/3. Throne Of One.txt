I am the only God that is
I am before all things
My life is all there is
I am before all days

I am
Chaos I am
Nothing under this moon
Could ever stop me

I am

For I am clothed about with flesh
Yet I am the eternal spirit
I am the Lord that riseth fresh

I am

I am the only god that is
Appear in unseen ways
I am before all things
I am before all days
