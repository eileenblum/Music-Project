Before the night is over
Before the day is through
The seals are sundered
They long for you

The earthbound stir after aeons of sleep
They have returned to claim what is theirs to keep

Behold the legions of doom

A prayer for the damned
A curse upon the faithful

They will take what they need from you
Before the night is over
Before the day is through
