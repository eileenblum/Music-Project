I call upon you
Undead Gods
Accept my offer
Hear me now!

By the blood of the beast

Through words unspoken
My soul to give
Grant me your presence
That I may live!

Drink of me, make me like you, drain me
So that I may die and be reborn anew

Through communion I will rise

I call the Gods through all 4 winds
The circuits of earth are now complete
Sealed is the bond of our kin
Accept my sacrifice

I call the Gods
Through all 4 winds
The circuits of earth
Are now complete
Sealed is the bond of our kind
Accept my sacrifice

In honour to those
Who have risen

Drink of me, feast
Drain me to death
To be reborn anew

By the blood of the beast

Hear my calling
Ancient ones
Grant me your guidance
Let death be gone

By the blood of the beast

I call upon you
Deathless ones
To ask this honour
And rise as one
