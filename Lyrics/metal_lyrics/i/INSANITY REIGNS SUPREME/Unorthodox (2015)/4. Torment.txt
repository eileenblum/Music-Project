To live amidst the masses
True horror it really is
It would mean to be tainted to be dead
Dead to myself

To be tainted, to be unlife
To b unlife, to be dead
Banished from myself

They shall not keep me from living
I renounce them and their wish for death
I shall free, free myself
And lay bare the spark of my glory
