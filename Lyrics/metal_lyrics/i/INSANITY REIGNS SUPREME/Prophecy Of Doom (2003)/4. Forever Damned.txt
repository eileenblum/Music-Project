I am alone in this darkness
Damned be thy name

The night shall be my path
Damned be thy being

Blinded by unjust fear
Damned be thy light

Seven by seven.... Hand and knee
In this moment... I curse thee

Contaminated by black
Damned is my life

Quieting my pain... Silencing my anguish
Abandoning my earthly bonds

The last essence of life has fled
Cursed by the heritage of blood

To be the desirous martyr
To scorching sore yet unseen

Seven by seven.... Hand and knee
In this moment... I curse thee

My curse is thine... Die, Die, I damn you all
Let me enter eternal bliss

Grant me escape from this refuge
End this horror, this suffering

Bound by darkness... I shall be.... never again
