To return my halo to the hands of traitors
The disgrace
Cast aside, betrayed, how I hate him

He who allies with my enemy
Shall burn in the flames of vengeance
Let this fire burn down the pearly gates

My brothers have come the meek... the cowards
Foolish once and all
How can they be so blind

If in the eternal fire I am cast
I will make it my throne to reign from
Their so called life will become
The inferno they think awaits them

Once more I wield the sword of retribution
No mere mortal shall be without sin
I condemn you all to certain death

If this soul is what he has given
It will be mine to corrupt
