Fear me for I am ripe with death
I am the last disease

The world returns to black
The final night is here

I have returned to guide the ones without a soul

Dark elohim, gather
We are the last dawn

Unleash the flood

There is no time to spare
No tomorrows to which your hopes may be delayed

Apocalypse

The undying are reborn once more
The heralds of the storm
Have risen to dominance

To sift through the bitter ashes

Finding nothing of worth
Hence we devote forever
To destroy the lands of faith
And bring the lands of the dead

We are hunger.... we are death
We are pestilence
We are war.... we are destroyers of life....
We are the apocalypse
