I walk in constant shadow
Blocking light and dark
Bow down before me
I recall your soul

I am the path
My traditions covenant

For I am the only god that is
Extinguish these mishappen abominations
Blasphemy

I will undo creation
Taste the fire in my eyes
My faith ignites your life
Blasphemy

Forsake your mortal ethics
Unchain the inner beast
Hierarchies of sin
Blasphemy

I will bend this earth to my will
Relinquish all power to me
To renounce me is to renounce all life... all hope

We are not akin
I stand above this mass of humanity

I am not drawn to darkness
It is drawn to me
