Invocation of the dead

Hear me ancients
Answer my call
Do my bidding
For now and all

Invocation of the damned

I speak to thee in lifeless tongues
By worse unspoken my will be done

By my will it is done

Through right or our bloodline
I call upon thee
To spite the name of our father
Awake from reverie

Invocation of the dead

At last, spirits of the fallen
Rise from your sleep
Eternal bonds are no longer
I set you free

Invocation of the damned

Return unto me the divine and defeated
From the abyss
