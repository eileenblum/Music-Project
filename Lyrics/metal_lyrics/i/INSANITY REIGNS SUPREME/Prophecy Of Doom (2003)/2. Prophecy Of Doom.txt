And the skies turned red with the foul blood
Of a thousand angels... Assail them all
Their essence freely flowing through the tired
Gates of heaven... no longer will they stand

Liberate tutemet ex infernis

Let the fires of rebellion burn down the sky asunder

Liberate tutemet ex infernis

They will drown in their own life

Hear the Pounding of the hooves
It is the sound of the dead dragging your hearse
Give way to the second war
And welcome this storm of chaos
That will tear at the very essence of your being

The bitter harvest of souls begun
The signs from the book of Enoch have come to pass

Stand or die

We are on the verge of an epic battle long foretold
Only one thing is certain.... this is death

Liberate tutemet ex infernis

Visions of doom, sights of eternity
Heed my words of gore
Hear the unholy prophecy of doom
