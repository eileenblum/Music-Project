Oh holy father
How thou hast fallen
From grace unto stagnation
Thy prayers are useless
Thy words are meaningless
Once revered
Praised was thy name
The masses no longer silent
Hypocrite-cast unto shame
Oh holy father
How thou hast sinned
From love unto molestation
Thy rituals of carnal desire
Destruction-spiritual funeral pyre
Once revered
Praised was thy name
The masses no longer silent
Hypocrisy-cast unto shame
If the omnipotent is so powerful
Then why does evil triumph over good?
If there is an all-mighty deity then
How could this go on for so long
Oh holy father
No baptism can scourge
The uncleansed
Truth built upon a fallacy
Verily thou hast sinned
