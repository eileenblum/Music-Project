Complacent disciple
Resting on thy laurels
Turning the other cheek
Reluctant pacifist
Gratification retrograde
Clutching your impaled idol
Of failure between your hands
Derided reticence
Fear overshadows your reality
Blind faith elusive trust
Reticent slave your
Cries are unheard [x2]
Sin of omission
Orthodox reservist
Blessing those who
Curse and spit on you
A deriding ode for
Such a cowardly dog
Ejaculation retrograd
Clutching your flaccid member
Of failure between your legs
Derided reticence
