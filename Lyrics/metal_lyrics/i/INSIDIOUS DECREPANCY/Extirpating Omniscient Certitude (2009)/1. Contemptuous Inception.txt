In the beginning there was nothingness
All was null and void
Entangled in abhorration-meaningless life
Burning contempt for the virus
Spawning across Terra's surface
A thousand years is nothing more
Than a blink of the eye
The eye that sees
The eye that knows
A thousind years is nothing more
Than a blink of the eye
Contemptuous inception
Insignificant life-forms litter
The wastelands across the barren earth
The spiritual fallacy, mass devastation
Burning contempt inseminated by the worm
Perpetual hatred, malevolent inception
Salvation's laceration
Rapture's abomination
Sons of iniquity
Who's failure
Is humanity
Scorched divinity
All is naught
Mankinds' lease upon this wretched ball of dirt
All is null and void
Entangled in abhorration-meaningful death
Spawning across Terra's surface
A thousand years is nothing more
Than dust to the infinite
The one who is
The one who was
And the one who shall be
Contemptuous inception
