A question of personal morality
Placid faces of the masses
Enshrined the remains of immortality
Docile sheep awaiting apocalypse
Trial by fire
Holy war ignites
Tribulation
Annihilation vendors
Awash in the divine splendor
Pain induced bliss
Awaits Mohammed's kiss
Trial by fire
Holy war ignites
Tribulation
Inquisition gentiles losing faith
Traditional jihadist views
History repeating itself
Another holocaust of the Jews
Trial by fire
Holy war ignites
Tribulation
