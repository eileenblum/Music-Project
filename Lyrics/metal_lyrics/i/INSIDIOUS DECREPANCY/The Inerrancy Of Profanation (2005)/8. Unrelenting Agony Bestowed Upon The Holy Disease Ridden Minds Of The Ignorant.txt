Celebrations of god
Evangelical deception

Pedophile priests
Spiritual molestation

Unbelievers, blasphemers
Religion devastates the land

Remains of the so-called messiah
Doomed and entombed
Disintegrates to sand...

Nothingness!
Death bringers, the plague lingers
Our time is at hand
Speaking with their tongues
Licking the cunt of the lamb

Thou shalt depart from this wretched world
Precious holy ghost be damned

Oath breakers, life takers
Synonymous with evil
The name of god
Cast into oblivion...

Thou shalt depart from this wretched world
Precious holy ghost be damned

Oath breakers, life takers
Synonymous with evil
The name of god
Cast into oblivion...

Forever!!!! [x4]
