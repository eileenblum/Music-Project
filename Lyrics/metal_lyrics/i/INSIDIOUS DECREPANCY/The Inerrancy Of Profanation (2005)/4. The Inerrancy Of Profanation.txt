Sanctimonious fraud
Uncovering sin
Sacrilegious actions
Blasphemous deeds
Christianity unmasked
See it for what it really is
Deceit and nauseam
The profanation of the faithful
The inerrancy of the wicked
There is no distinction
Between right and wrong
They're one and the same

Enslavement of the masses
The strong shall inherit the earth
The weak shall be torn asunder
With cloven hooves, ad infinitum

This is the covenant
Of a new Aeon [x2]
For the old one has passed away
This is the flesh, ye must eat
This is the blood, ye must also drink
For the blood is life
Drink! Drink! Drink!
This is the flesh, ye must eat
For the flesh is life
Feast! Feast! Feast!

I am my own god
For no redeemer cometh!
The inerrancy of profanation [x2]

This is the flesh, ye must eat
This is the blood, ye must also drink
For the blood is life
Drink! Drink! Drink!
This is the flesh, ye must eat
For the flesh is life
Feast! Feast! Feast!

I am my own god
For no redeemer cometh!
The inerrancy of profanation [x2]

Enslavement of the masses
The strong shall inherit the earth
The weak shall be torn asunder
With cloven hooves, ad infinitum
