Stripped - nailed to the cross
Crucified - to be at one with your god
Whipped - enter the kingdom of the lost
Asphyxiate
Martyred - our will shall be done
Raped by - demons unknown

Mortified - the scourging has begun
Dominate
Blaspheming, unbelieving
Man has defiled your ways
Sanctified - blessed by the high priest

Corpus Christi - stomped upon with wrath
Cannibalized - watching the Ancients feast

Immolate
Immortalized - banishing of the light
Emblazoned - holy scriptures burn

Defied - by darkest powers of the night
Transmutate
Blaspheming, unbelieving

Defied - by darkest powers of the night
Transmutate
Blaspheming, unbelieving
I have defiled your ways
Churning, burning
Yearning for the blaze
