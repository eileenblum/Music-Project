Mesmerized by anal suffering
Instruments of torture

Bowels ripped out
Nothing thrown away
Colon ripped with a corkscrew

Agonizing pain, life's nemesis
And greatest ally
To endure till the end

Suffering is a necessity
In this oh so cruel world
But I am here to save you
And cradle your flesh

To slowly dismember
You into tiny pieces
Pieces of serenity
Which fall into place

Intestines, prepared with a touch
Of garlic and oregano [x2]

Nothing is wasted
Oh and by the way, try some of this
With a touch of wine, to accent the flavor
Nothing is wasted
Oh and by the way, try some of this
It's your colon, doesn't it just taste divine?

Agonizing pain, life's nemesis
And greatest ally
To endure till the end
