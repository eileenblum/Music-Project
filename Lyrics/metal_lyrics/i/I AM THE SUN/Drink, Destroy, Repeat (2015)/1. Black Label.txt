Itâs time to drain the bottle again
Embrace a new damnation
Weâll burn it down so hide your kids
Drink, destroy, repeat

Thereâs no end, weâre the black labels
No one here is safe

The road ends so suddenly
No trace of salvation
Take a breath, chug it down
Drink, destroy, repeat

Thereâs no end, weâre the black labels
No one here is safe
Living on the edge, with a black label
Tattooed on our hands
