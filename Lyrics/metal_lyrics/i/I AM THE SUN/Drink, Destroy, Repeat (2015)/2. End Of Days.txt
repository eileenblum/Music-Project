Rain and thunder
Black clouds control the sky
Covered in darkness
People running for their lives
The Armageddon
Has come to claim its place
Human Race
We'll finally meet our end

It's the end of days
Last chance to disobey

Forget the rules

So raise 'em up high
And cheer to our demise
So raise 'em up high
One last time before we die
