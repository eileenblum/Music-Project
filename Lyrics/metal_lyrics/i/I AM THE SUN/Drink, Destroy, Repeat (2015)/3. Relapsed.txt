Listen up my boy
This is no kind of joke
I'll lead you to hell
Take my word for it, NO
Been up for seven days
Consuming what I see
I can barely stand
Push on until the end

Days go on and
Nights won't end
On and on
Again I relapsed

Been up for seven days
Consuming what I see
I can barely stand
Push on until I'm dead
