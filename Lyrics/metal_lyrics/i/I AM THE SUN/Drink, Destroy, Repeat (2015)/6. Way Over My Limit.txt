Gone over the bend
Face lies in the sand
Sun burns through the skin
Hello little devil, smiling at me

I've been longing for
Another taste of sin
I've been jonesin' for
Another hit of bliss

For a moment
I'll forget
For a moment
I don't exist

I Stare into the sun
Another night went by
Way over my limit
Time to die again
