All alone, by myself
I can feel my eyes turning dry
All alone, I don't care
The air that blows tonight mystifies
A burning light, up in the sky
Is what guides my mind for the time

Will she appear?
Like a dream
Dancing in smoke
My guiding light
Wraps me in her embrace

All alone, by myself
The clouds dance on the horizon
All alone, I don't care
I feel at home with the unknown

Will she appear?
Like a dream
Dancing in smoke
My guiding light
Wraps me in her embrace
