Strange memories of an ancient time passed through my head.
Visions of uncharted darkness, enchanted my restless soul
The dreams began. Great watery spaces of nameless deities Opened out before me.
I seemed to wander through their sunken cities built by higher race.
Then the other shapes began to appear of those who had lived since before man ever walked the earth, filling me with nameless honor.
From the dark stars they came, the masters of infinite knowledge
Behold the eternal dominion of the elder gods, in the land of darkness lores
Their shadows are roaming over this fool world and as I behold their crawling madness
I shed no tears.
