It is a quest, a need to conquer the unknown
a need to change, to fade into a strange yet original shape
to formalize another understanding under values of cosmic law
to become one with the true existence of the ancient mystical strength
to summon the force to sneak into the unfolded aeons
to let the original blood spill into my earthly veins
to restore the dark spirit into it's old cage
to open the path upon the reality beyond the sight
to see behind the ability of the primate mind
to step inside the level of another dimension
to be born again ...
