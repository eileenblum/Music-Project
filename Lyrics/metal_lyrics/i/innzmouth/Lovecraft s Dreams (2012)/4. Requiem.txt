What have become of those who had lived among the shadows of creation?
Their eyes lost their glow. They look but they're blind, longing for their past prosperity.
They are locked beneath the shadow of the darksome waters
But the souls of the ancient ones hike and seek the ultimate vengeance of those who trapped them among their sunken glory.
They sunk into the abyss of eternal watery sleep where they dwell in R'lyeh.
Thus, they struggle to find a path to enchant the minds of worthless humanity with dark wisdom
