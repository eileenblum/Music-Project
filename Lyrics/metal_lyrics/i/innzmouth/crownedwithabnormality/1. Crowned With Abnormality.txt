It was the beginning. A mere step inside the cosmic gateway.
The last chance to meet the essence behind the flesh.
To enter a world beyond the earthly comprehension.
To recognize the wisdom that lies inside an icy disguise.

The shadow that wrapped the origin was too deep.
Until the puzzle of existence was deciphered inside an icy structure.
Revealed the truth about the ones who ruled the existence.
We are merely nothing but slaves to an abomination.
To the ones who ruled the times before time.

Arise ancient masters from your frozen slumber.
Humanity shall once again be crowned with abnormality.
The mind weakens with dark visions of unspeakable horrors.
At the mountains of madness.
