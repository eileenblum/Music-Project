Within the rotting bottom of the deep lies the kings of abominations.
They wait behind the shadows of time, above the influence of the cosmos.
They transform their knowledge to the chosen ones through abhorred visions.
To those who have faith in the slimy wisdom which come from beyond the stars.
Let the sounds of anguish rise among the masses for it shall be the return of
the glorious ones, the keepers .. the guardians of darkness.
