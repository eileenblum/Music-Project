[Instrumental][Music: Schaffer, Shawver]

[Spoken words:]
Once again we have laid another loved one to rest
And as we fight the grief in our hearts
We must realize that the fate of death is inevitable
And thus in turn we find that through our trials and tribulations
Death may be the only real piece of mind
