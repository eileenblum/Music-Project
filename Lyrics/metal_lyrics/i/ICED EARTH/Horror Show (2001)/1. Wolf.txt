[Music: Jon Schaffer / Lyrics: Jon Schaffer]

Innocence tainted by pure lunacy
Cursed by the slash of a shape-shifting beast
Oh no, this can't be
Demonic infection, a doomed changeling
His future concealed as he begs to be told
A kiss from the gypsy, he'll never grow old
Oh no, this can't be
Demonic infection, a doomed changeling

[Chorus]
Even a man who's pure
And says his prayers by night
(He won't hear your prayers)
Man become a wolf
When the wolf bane blooms,
And the autumn moon is bright
(There's a full moon tonight)
Man may become a wolf.

He who is bitten by a wolf and lives
Possession soon follows, no use to resist
Oh no, this can't be
Cursed by the moonlight, a doomed changeling
The madness a turmoil that swells up inside
To truly find peace is to truly die
Oh no, this can't be
Cursed by the moonlight, a doomed changeling

Now comes the rampage, a killing spree
Hunting his loved ones comes instinctively
Oh no, it's maddening
A shape-shifting demon of pure lunacy
A shot from the darkness tears through its flesh
A bullet of silver lays it to rest

Oh no, it's maddening
An innocent victim finds his peace.
