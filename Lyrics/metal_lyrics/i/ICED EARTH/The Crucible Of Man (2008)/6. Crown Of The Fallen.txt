Many lifetimes have come and gone
In elation of this day
By the Order's hand
The minions forged his way
At age thirteen
Dawn the Days of Revealing
The human forms will rue the day
We crown the Astral Beast

Crowned is the king of the fallen
Rejoice in his light, they live again
Crowned is the king of the fallen
Celebrate the subjugation of all man

His countenance, the venom burns
The wraps conceal the pain
Don the shroud and the armour
Deeply stained
Now place crown upon his head
The scepter in his grasp
Kneel now! for before you stands
The wicked God of wrath

Crowned is the king of the fallen
Rejoice in his light, they live again
Crowned is the king of the fallen
Celebrate the subjugation of all man
