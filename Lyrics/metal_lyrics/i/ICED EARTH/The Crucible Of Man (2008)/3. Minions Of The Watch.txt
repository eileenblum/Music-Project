When he was born
The Elder gathered in the night
They gave him shelter
Clothed him, fed him with insight
They taught him of the course
Of human and the Setian ways
Curriculum just shy the telling
Of the end of days

[Chorus:]
Minions gather 'round
Round this child
Watch over as he grows
Little does he know
This child is the one
Salvation
Fulfill the prophecy,
Bring about our destiny

As he grows
His minions gather in his light
His future though not clear to him
He holds the second sight
He has seen most of this world
Yet does not know his way
They will place him on the path
To the end of days

[Chorus]
