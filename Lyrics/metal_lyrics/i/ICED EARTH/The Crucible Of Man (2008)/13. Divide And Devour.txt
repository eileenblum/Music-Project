Through the folds of time I forge the way
Messiah to my own and sent to slay
I am pure embodied rage
Made of a million souls that dearly paid

The icy pulse that's pumping' through my veins
Sanctifies the end of human ways
I am pure embodied rage
Born of a million souls unjustly slain

[Chorus:]
I am the weapon that strikes
In the hearts of man I thrive
Feeding their fear with lies
I will devour I will divide
I am the god of hellfire
Inside of every man there lives a liar
Before their gods they cower
I will divide I will devour

Antichrist or harbinger of fate
Prophet and priest born of the ancient rage
I will assassinate their way
Annihilation of the human race

[Chorus:]
I am the weapon that strikes
In the hearts of man I thrive
Feeding their fear with lies
I will devour I will divide
I am the god of hellfire
Inside of every man there lives a liar
Before their gods they cower
I will divide I will devour
