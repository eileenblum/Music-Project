I am your inner fear
Your kind refuse to hear
I am the light
I am the way
But the fallacies of man
Are easy to embrace

And I, in purest form
I always weather every storm
And though you fail to see
The truth is the path
That leads to me

Mankind's dishonesty
Lays them to waste
(I will divide)
I am the truth,
And I walk alone

Human hypocrisy
Exacting their fate
(I will devour)
I am the truth,
And I walk alone

The flaws in your design
Are breeding fear
Inside your mind
And lies lead to disgrace
A failure to reform
The failed human race

Mankind's dishonesty
Lays them to waste
(I will divide)
I am the truth,
And I walk alone

Human hypocrisy
Exacting their fate
(I will devour)
I am the truth,
And I walk alone

Mankind's dishonesty
Lays them to waste
(I will divide)
I am the truth,
And I walk alone

Human hypocrisy
Exacting their fate
(I will devour)
I am the truth,
And I walk alone
