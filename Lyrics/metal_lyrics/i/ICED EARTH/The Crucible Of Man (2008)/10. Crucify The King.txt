Look at you now
Exalted no more
Scourging's left your blood
Soaked into the floor
For having the sight
You will pay a heavy price
Martyr for mankind
Contrived sacrifice

[Chorus:]
Let all your children pray
You've washed their sins away
I'll bring the suffering
Let all your children pray
I don't come their way
I'll crucify their king

Look at you now
You pathetic little man
With spear I pierce your hide
Destiny in my hand
For all mine have lost
Your fate will intertwine
Your death will polarize
Resurrection will divide

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Like all false seers, you're formed to fit the plan
Unsuspecting pawns to the detriment of man
And as your worlds collide
War will bring the suffering
And to that end I'll crucify
I'll crucify the king

[Chorus]
