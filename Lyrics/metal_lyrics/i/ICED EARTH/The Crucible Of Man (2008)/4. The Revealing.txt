The Revealing comes, now that he's thirteen
Told of his coming trials, what is meant to be
Taught the arts of the ancients for the mother's sake
Time manipulation and of shifting shape

He is held up high, minions flock to him
Told of the birth in fires, this boy messiah
Taught the arts of the ancients, for the mother's sake
Time manipulation and of shifting shape
