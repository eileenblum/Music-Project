As I watch through the ages
And gaze upon this world
The troubled race of man
So impetuous and afraid
There's potential in this race
A man can spark hope
But in masse they do regress
A constant downward slope

How have they come so far
Yet have so far to go
It seems evolution stalled
On the nature of a man
From living in caves
To manned flights in space
And for all that is worth
Still the sad pathetic race

[Chorus:]
Can't you see what's plain as day
It's always been there inside of you
One saving grace that's hard to face
Embracing the truth will change your fate
It's up to you and the path you choose
To be led to the slaughter or lead the way
The quest for light, a worthwhile fight
Will you have what it takes?
Come what may

[Bridge:]
If you'd just look
Look inside yourselves
You'll find the answers to your pain
The hardest road
The hardest road to enlightenment
Presents a constant test
Of your resolve
Time for you
Time for you is running out
The human race must evolve
Must evolve

[Chorus:]
Can't you see what's plain as day
It's always been there inside of you
One saving grace that's hard to face
Embracing the truth will change your fate
It's up to you and the path you choose
To be led to the slaughter or lead the way
The quest for light, a worthwhile fight
Will you have what it takes?
Come what may

[back-vocals:]
As I watch through the ages
The troubled race of man
Seems evolution stalled
Still a sad pathetic race
Will you have what it takes?
Come what may
