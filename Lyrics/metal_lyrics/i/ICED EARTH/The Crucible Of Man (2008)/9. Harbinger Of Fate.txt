When I was young I was different
there was more inside of me
so alone yet a sense of purpose
the guiding light of the order nurtured me
daunted by the truth revealed
what am I? what's my destiny?
a million souls, the priest incarnate
I am the one, I am the astral beast

[Chorus:]
I am the wicked, the dealer of fate
Harbinger of sorrow
I'm the assassin, the dealer of fate
Framing man's tomorrow

I thrive as the lone traveler
Trough the folds of time and space
the chosen one to foreshadow
the hand of god will eradicate this race

I am the past, I'm cure for sorrow
I am the now, I'm the every age
I'm the future ending mans tomorrow
the hand of god, the harbinger of fate

[Chorus]

Kingdoms will fall, empires crumble
seizing on the politics of hate
I am the one, the devil in the details
the hand of god, the harbinger of fate

[Chorus]
