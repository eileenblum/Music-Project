It does not take much to destroy a man
Give him rope and he will hang
Same can be said for dynasty
So fat with itself, can no longer feed

Rome will burn when it's time has come
Ottoman tribes fate away
The social cults empower puppet men
Leaving me to pull the strings

[Chorus:]
Kingdoms fall to the ground
Crushed by their own greed
An unquenching need to destroy
Empires will fall by my design
Lust of power speeds
Time people need to destroy

Your future's clear if you can look back
Every culture's earned their fate
Your gluttony as my tool of choice
You've proved your worthless every day

[Chorus]
