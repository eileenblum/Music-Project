[Lyrics-Gene Adam]
[Music-Jon Schaffer/Bill Owen]

He's the creeper in the night 
He's the reaper with a knife 
He wears a mask to hide his face 
He's always ready for the chase 
Killing for the vengeance 
Of his mothers death 
He's got murder on his breath 
Run from the creeper 
Hide in the night 
His knife is plunging deeper 
He's got you wrapped up tight 

Creeper in the night 
Reaper With a knife 
Creeper take your life 
Reaper With a killing bite 

Down in the lake 
He's gaining his strength 
His vision is blurred 
His mind is obscured 
From behind a tree 
Or underneath your bed 
He's looking for you 
He'll cut off your head 
Behind his mask 
He lies in wait 
His mind is obsessed 
He's gone insane 
only to know the look in his eyes 
The pain and the fear 
And the tast of spite 

Creeper in the night 
Reaper With a knife 
Creeper take your life 
Reaper With a killing bite
