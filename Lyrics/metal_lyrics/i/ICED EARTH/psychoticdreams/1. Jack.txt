[Lyrics and music-Jon Schaffer]

Out in the streets 
Out in the night 
Slime oozes from her gutter 
Street walkin' bitch 
Makin' it rich 
Desperate man involved 
Take a knife 
Take her life 
Worthless debutante 

Jack is out there 
Jack is near 
Jack be nimble 
Jack brings fear 
Jack has blades and axes, too 
Jack had blades, I warned you 

One more block 
And you'll be safe 
If you get that lucky 
But you don't 
You poor thing 
His axe is swinging proudly 

Jack is out there 
Jack is near 
Jack be nimble 
Jack brings fear 
Jack has blades and axes, too 
Jack had blades, I warned you 

Swing his axe 
Twenty whacks 
And you're into bite-sized peices 

Take his knife 
Slice your life 
Shreaded prostitution 
Jack has won 
In Jacks mind 
Jack has the resolution
