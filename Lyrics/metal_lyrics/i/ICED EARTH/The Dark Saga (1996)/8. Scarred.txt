[lyrics - Schaffer]

Darkness calls down to me
Sweat pours from my body like rain
Growing wiser with each touch
A pawn in lucifers game, am I?

It attacks me in the black abyss
The entity formless yet full of rage
The mark of the beast my body
Scarring me for eternal life

[Chorus]
I brought this all upon myself
Sold my soul to change my life
It's up to me and no one else
The beast in me can't control my life

I brought this all upon myself
Sold my soul to change my life
It's up to me and no one else
The beast in me can't control me

[Bridge]
And so it's begun, this is the end of me
The seed was sewn now it's growing inside
My fate in control, not mine
He lied

[Chorus]
I brought this all upon myself
Sold my soul to change my life
It's up to me and no one else
The beast in me can't control my life

I brought this all upon myself
Sold my soul to change my life
It's up to me and no one else
The beast in me won't control me
