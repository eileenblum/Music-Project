[music - Schaffer\Shawver]
[lyrics - Barlow]

My personal quest is to make your life hell
Yes dear friend listen up well
The power I've given I can take as well
I am your father destroyer of the light
I've taken your soul and have given you life
You are the damned condemned by my hand
My son creature of the night
In your hour of darkness
You warm my soul
And deep in you as I make my hole
God won't save you
Your souls been sold
I am your father destroyer of the light
I've taken your soul and have given you life
You are the damned condemned by my hand
My son creature of the night
Extending, now you rise
Tormented, soul of fire
Deception, in my eyes
Your life, your life is mine
My new born son burn now with anger
I command and you must follow
Fly now and do battle
The heavens fall, mankinds disaster
In your hour of darkness
You warm my soul
God won't save you
Your souls been sold
I am your father destroyer of the light
I've taken your soul and have given you life
You are the damned condemned by my hand
My son creature of the night
Extending, now you rise
Tormented, soul of fire
Deception, in my eyes
Your life, your life is mine
