A storm is raging on the open sea
We are the outcasts
No friends of sophistry
Betrayed
Banishment
Embracing chaos, the only creed
Scourge of nations
The empires enemies
Betrayed
Banishment

With the stroke of a pen
A treaty is signed
Now deemed as outlaws
Once employed by the crown
With letters of marque
Giving us sanctioned plunder
No longer the fools
Or pawns in their game
Of economic warfare
Do they really believe
They control us?
Our greatest strength is independence

We live out our last days
With barrels of rum, black powder
And the clash of the blades

You will fire the guns
Upon my command
Unleash full broadside
Destroying the mast
The rigging, the sails
The shrapnel devastating
Boarding the sloop
Flintlock in hand, one shot
Grenades are flying
Running them through
With my cutlass
The blood and the steel
The slashing and screaming

We live out our last days
With barrels of rum, black powder
And the clash of the blades

Stories foretold
Of silver and gold
And the empires greed
Well god damn the queen
We'll string up the kings
We're rogues of the seas
The freest of men
Fly no colors at all
And our creed is our own
We spit on our hands
Hoist the black flag
And begin to slit throats

We live out our last days
With barrels of rum, black powder
And the clash of the blades

Stories foretold
Of silver and gold
And the empires greed
Well god damn the queen
We'll string up the kings
We're rogues of the seas
The freest of men
Fly no colors at all
And our creed is our own
We spit on our hands
Hoist the black flag
And begin to slit throats
