They came across the ocean
In search of liberty
Escaping persecution
Famine and poverty
Signed up for bloodshed
New home a battleground
Send in the Irish
So courageous and renowned

Sons of Erin
Marching gallantly
Into a storm of lead
Forward! Clear the way!
Sons of Erin
Charging valiantly
Across that bloody space
Forward! Clear the way!

The hills alive with murder
The sky so cold and grey
The general gives the order
Irish clear the way!
Bodies fall like leaves in autumn
From the wall at Marye's heights
Shot and shell ripping through them
A cold horrific sight

Sons of Erin
Marching gallantly
Into a storm of lead
Forward! Clear the way!
Sons of Erin
Charging valiantly
Across that bloody space
Forward! Clear the way!

Intrepid sons with heads held high
Go where glory awaits you
Your absolution under fire
If the lord above takes you
Fight, stand tall, prevail
Your brothers surround you
Fight, stand tall, prevail
Your courage defines you

Charge through the dead and dying
No surrender no retreat
Their brothers paid the price
They'll never smell defeat
Raise high the emerald colors
For all field to see
They charged into the slaughter
With faith and dignity

Sons of Erin
Marching gallantly
Into a storm of lead
Forward! Clear the way!
Sons of Erin
Charging valiantly
Across that bloody space
Forward! Clear the way!

Intrepid sons with heads held high
Go where glory awaits you
Your absolution under fire
If the lord above takes you
Fight, stand tall, prevail
Your brothers surround you
Fight, stand tall, prevail
Your courage defines you

Intrepid sons with heads held high
Go where glory awaits you
Your absolution under fire
If the lord above takes you
Fight, stand tall, prevail
Your brothers surround you
Fight, stand tall, prevail
Your courage defines all you are
