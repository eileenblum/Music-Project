Another long and restless night
The pain inside
You've fought it all these years
And now you're growing tired
You won't suffer very long
It's almost time
I've waited oh so long
To feel our souls unite

I know you feel me
I know you'll see me
When it's over
My one and only
You won't be lonely
When it's over

When I was taken from your side
That tragic night
I was peering through the veil
A respite from that life
You will love it on this side
It's paradise
Release the pain, just let it go
It's almost time

I know you feel me
I know you'll see me
When it's over
My one and only
You won't be lonely
When it's over

Come to me my love
I am waiting
Feel my pull
Through the veil

I know you feel me
I know you'll see me
When it's over
My one and only
You won't be lonely
When it's over
