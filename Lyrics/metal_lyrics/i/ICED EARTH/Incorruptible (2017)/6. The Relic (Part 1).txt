He was drawn into the shamans sacred place
Where the relic calls his name
Just a minion in the game
In a trance like state
A vessel for its needs
Oh on innocence it feeds
The relic whisked away

From the window he sees his father coming home
From his trips around the world
He feels its presence drawing near
Clenching tightly to this evil heinous thing
His father gives the gift to him
He feels the power from within

It awakens preying on this child
And its evil seeping in
A millennia begins
As the tears fall from the shamans eyes
The boy is filled with sin
And corruption swells within

The relics evil grows and twists within the boy
Entombed and bound within his soul
He sees his flesh begin to crawl
Ancient being spews and fills him with its hate
Oh and death will pave its way
Building kingdoms of dismay

It awakens preying on this child
And its evil seeping in
A millennia begins
As the tears fall from the shamans eyes
The boy is filled with sin
And corruption swells within

As he looks in his fathers eyes
Life drains from him
Blood spills, painting the earth
Beneath his feet
Anointed by death
His path engrained
The relic sleeps no more
