They will try to crush your spirit
Everyday just trying to bear it
Dire thoughts to escape this suffering
Tear this pain away
With the blade in your wrist
Something in you says you must resist
They are weak you are strong
Accept this
You must take control

You are rising
The strength inside you
With your defiance you will not be broken
This torment
Has its reasons
Your defiance takes your spirit higher

Parasites that try to hurt you
Manipulate and strip your virtue
You are the master of yourself
They will never take away
Smash through the wall of their hate
Just pawns to insecurities
They decay in sorrow and rage
Their malice fades away

You are rising
The strength inside you
With your defiance you will not be broken
This torment
Has its reasons
Your defiance takes your spirit higher

Never falter
Find your solace
Rise! Fight!
No more weakness!
Rise! Fight!
Exile torment!
Rise! Fight!

Wiping tears and blood from your face
Rise above the cowards of disgrace
Realize they're just as beaten
Overcome the fear
You must know they can't break your soul
You are strong, stronger than you know
Their power inside is fiction
Oppressor is defied

You are rising
The strength inside you
With your defiance you will not be broken
This torment
Has its reasons
Your defiance takes your spirit higher
