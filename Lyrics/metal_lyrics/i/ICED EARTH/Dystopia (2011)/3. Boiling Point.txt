I sit alone and watch hypocrisy
I will fight
My frustration ever building
Tensions rise
The air runs thick with hostility
My thought are boiling and I'm full rage

[Chorus]
I'm at the end
Patience run thin
I think I'll lose my mind
Taking no more
Your death I swore
They will not break my will

I'll make this your darkest hour
Hate will rise
My force will devastate your power
Hear them cry
I vowed to cure my aggravation
Your demise
I'm coming forth to bring a world of pain

[Chorus]
I'm at the end
Patience run thin
I think I'll lose my mind
Taking no more
Your death I swore
They will not break my will

Satisfied eradication
Deed is done
Your spirit's dead and finally mine
Now you're gone
My sanity a fixed condition
Not your pawn
Vindication written in your blood

[Chorus]
I'm at the end
Patience run thin
I think I'll lose my mind
Taking no more
Your death I swore
They will not break my will

Boiling Point
Boiling Point
Boiling Point
