His mind is worn and so tortured
Suffering was part of the plan
Blades flying swift with justice
Remember the idea not the man

Rising up from the fire
Unified to be free
Stoking our fears with their lies
You are the key

Sedated they kept us all dormant
Unknowing, our lives lived in vain
Like mindless drones we're devoted
Weâve welcomed our fate as their slaves

[Chorus]
Prepare for victory
Our minds have been awakened
Rid your life of tyranny
We are the resistance

No fear, stand tall
Resist
Tyranny falls
No lives, no war
Resist
Victory calls

Rising up from the fire
Unified to be free
Stoking our fears with their lies
You are the key

In the end we were coiled with the serpent
It took all we had to break free
Our victory, it came without violence
We vanquished, they fell to their knees

[Chorus]
Prepare for victory
Our minds have been awakened
Rid your life of tyranny
We are the resistance

No fear, stand tall
Resist
Tyranny falls
No lives, no war
Resist
Victory calls
