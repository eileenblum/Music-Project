They beat you black and blue
You're fleeced, your anger's seething
They turned their backs on you, betrayed!
Fight or die, kill or be killed
Society's collapsing
You watch your world die and decay

Days of rage
Days of rage
Days of rage

Unhinged and full of hate
A time bomb clearly ticking
No more, nothing left to lose
Your money can't be found
Anger, pain, starvation
Betrayed! Domesticated fool

Days of rage
Days of rage
Days of rage

Lies destroy life
Days of rage
Lies destroy life
Days of rage
Lies destroy life
Days of rage
Lies destroy life

Decadence and ignorance
Led you to this suffering
Prison camps created just for you
Will you survive' What will you do'
When the rug's pulled from under you
Hell is what you future's coming to

Days of rage
Days of rage
Days of rage
Days of rage
