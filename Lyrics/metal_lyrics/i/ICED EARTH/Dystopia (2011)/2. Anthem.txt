In your eyes I see you're desperate and in hunger
Reclaim your future, your past uncertain
See this child is raised in hate and in anger
His eyes wide open, his rage so focused

[Chorus]
Torn asunder, our destiny is in sight
This is the anthem to celebrate your life
Torn asunder, our destiny is in sight
This is the anthem to celebrate your life

A single mother she is strained and she suffers
She slaves away her life in turmoil
A homeless man had it all and now has nothing
His spirit broken, plagued from injustice

[Chorus]
Torn asunder, our destiny is in sight
This is the anthem to celebrate your life
Torn asunder, our destiny is in sight
This is the anthem to celebrate your life

[Bridge]
We have the power make our lives what they are to be
Reconnect with our humanity
Transcend to a higher place, accepting reality
You are the key to the life you seek

[Chorus]
Torn asunder, our destiny is in sight
This is the anthem to celebrate your life
Torn asunder, our destiny is in sight
This is the anthem to celebrate your life
