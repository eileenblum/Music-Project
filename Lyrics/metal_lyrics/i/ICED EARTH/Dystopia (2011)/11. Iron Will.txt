Aloneâ¦ Oh I know your lost and trying to find your way
You have been betrayedâ¦ led astray
Angerâ¦ Stirs inside and is tearing you apart
Beating from this cold and broken heart

You are stoned
You will stand and fight this emptiness and pain
Cast away your suffering, seize the day
Fireâ¦ Extinguish the flames that haunt your mind
Take control of your life

[Chorus:]
You are strong, in your soul
Overcome the trials and tribulations
Live your life, take control
You have broken through the threshold

[Guitar solo]

You have won, oh the battle deep within your soul is done
Troubles washed away, a brand new day
Focusedâ¦ you have overcome challenges of life
You are the life you will survive

[Chorus]
