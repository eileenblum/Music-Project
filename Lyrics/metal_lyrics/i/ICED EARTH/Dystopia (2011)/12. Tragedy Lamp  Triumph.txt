Here we stand,
I know it's always been our home
We're awakened from our prison
A new day, it's finally here,
We walk the streets without fear
Our humanity has risen
Digging out those microchips
That kept us dormant to resist
Singing sings of our triumph
To maintain our current state
We must try to innovate
Our minds and our future

[Bridge]
We lived through their lies
No we'll always keep
A conscious mind
And we hold our heads up high
We will never let our spirit die

The brave new world,
You know it's always been a lie
Pushed with their manipulation
Cast away the unseen chains
They shackle you a slave
Take control of your existence
Flushing out their poison ways
Live to fight another day
The time is now to start living
We've taken back our dignity
We are alive and we are free
A revolution of our spirit

[Bridge]
We lived through their lies
No we'll always keep
A conscious mind
And we hold our heads up high
We will never let our spirit die

[Chorus]
Time is on our side
We have prevailed
Humanity's ultimate struggle
Hearts and minds
Are joined in victory
We are triumphant end eternal
Time is on our side
We have prevailed
Humanity's ultimate struggle
Hearts and minds
Are joined in victory
We are triumphant end eternal

Here we stand
I know it's always been our home
We can build a brand new future
A new day, it's finally here
We live our lives without fear
Our humanity has risen
The task at hand to educate
So we don't make the same mistake
Never take the road to serfdom
We are aware, we are awake
Dystopia we did escape
Never to repeat the nightmare

[Bridge]
We lived through their lies
No we'll always keep
A conscious mind
And we hold our heads up high
We will never let our spirit die

[Chorus]
Time is on our side
We have prevailed
Humanity's ultimate struggle
Hearts and minds
Are joined in victory
We are triumphant end eternal
Time is on our side
We have prevailed
Humanity's ultimate struggle
Hearts and minds
Are joined in victory
We are triumphant end eternal
