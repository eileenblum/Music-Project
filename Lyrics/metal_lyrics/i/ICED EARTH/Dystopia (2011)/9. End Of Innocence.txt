Through the essence of your smile
Makes this fight all worth while
Oh' the perseverance of your life

There you were by my side
Giving me strength through your love and pride
She says carry on, carry on

Oh the stars they shine so bright
Are they there for you and I'
I know you'll see the light

[Chorus]
Carry on, be strong my son
This is the end of innocence
Carry on, when I'm gone
This is the end of innocence
This is the end my friend

Sacrifice is all we have
Finding solace in your laugh
The freedom will ease your pain

Washing tides and seasons change
Things will never be the same
Oh' she says carry on, carry on

[Chorus]
Carry on, be strong my son
This is the end of innocence
Carry on, when I'm gone
This is the end of innocence
This is the end
