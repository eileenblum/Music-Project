The earth has suffered over population
All our rations have been dominated
We look to them for answers to our hunger
Food made from you and i
Increasing their supply

The land is stripped and so barren
Our people must take a stand
Luxuries passed are now savored
We can't even live off the land

Corruption eating us alive
Our guts are filled with their lies

Humans controlled and in turmoil
Defy and you're taken away
The secret is kept from the people
Their lives are left to decay

In line, denied, they've had enough
No food, no work, they must rise up

Their greed has left us all for dead
We are so unaware
They encourage suicide
The truth we must unveil

One man will come to expose them
He'll be a thorn in their side
Danger around every corner
The order must defied

Descend upon their wickedrule
People need to know they're fooled

Nourishment made in a compound
Sustenance from you and i
Taken and processed tgo feed them
Death will increase their supply

Swallow their lies you satisfy
Accept your fate before you die

Their greed has left us all for dead
We are so unaware
They encourage suicide
The truth we must unveil

We need to stop them some way, somehow
The truth was hidden
From the people until know
Your final moments are so serene
It's humans that they're eating,
It's Soylent Green
