[Music : Jon Schaffer / Lyrics : Tim Owens]

Cause, this is the creed that brings effect
That of which of mankind's besieged
By our plans devised infect
Kings and empires rise and fall
By the Rose and our decree
Of the Elder's prophecy
That rids us of the human threat
And frees the hand of destiny

Fate by our dominion
In their sovereign states
Fall like dominos
Framing mankind's fate

Kill! Assassinate the ones that lead
By their example we deceive
With religions we create
Martyrs, saviors and their slaves
To a sad sadistic need
To crucify a puppet king
Of a selfish vile race
That is filled to the core by greed

Fate by our dominion
In their sovereign states
Fall like dominos
Framing mankind's fate

Divide!! Mankind!!
Destroy!! Their kind!!!
Fear will make us free
Cast doubt through history

DIVIDE!!!

Fate by our dominion
In their sovereign states
Fall like dominos
Framing mankind's fate
