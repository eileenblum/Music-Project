[Music / Lyrics : Jon Schaffer]

As I awake I have no memory of this
Who I am, where I'm from, why do I exist?
This strange beauty surrounds me
But where I am confounds me
I see others who appear the same as me
A look of loss in their eyes, adrift aimlessly
What's the point? What does it all mean?
Who am I? Show me a purpose please

Take this sense of wonder
Make it go away
Please tell me I am not alone and lost here
That there is something that's made me feel this way
Take this sense of sadness
Make it go away
Please give me something that's familiar
A friendly touch, a memorable embrace

I try to speak but empty eyes stare back at me
Twisted tongues segregate, factions are forming
I'll stay with those that resemble me
To survive this harsh reality
As the days pass most have gone their own way
Nomadic tribes discover life
On a world that feels so strange
But still I want answers
What's the point? What does all this mean?

Take this sense of wonder
Make it go away
Please tell me I am not alone and lost here
That there is something that's made me feel this way
Take this sense of sadness
Make it go away
Please give me something that's familiar
A friendly touch, a memorable embrace

Lies, the human core is lies
We wiped their minds, cleaned the slate
The Clouding did divide
Fate, we sealed human fate
Now they're ours throughout all time
To manipulate

Never trust in the motives of man
They failed to evolve in Mother Nature's plan
And though they seem safe
In this early clouded state
The nature of their heresy
Has proven quite innate

Pain, mankind will know pain
For their crimes on our kind
They'll never be the same
Death, they will know death
Suffering for centuries
At war with every breath

Never trust in the motives of man
They failed to evolve in Mother Nature's plan
And though they seem safe
In this early clouded state
The nature of their heresy
Has proven quite innate
