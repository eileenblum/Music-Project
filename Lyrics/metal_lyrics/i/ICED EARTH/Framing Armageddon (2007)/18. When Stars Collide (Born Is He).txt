[Music : Jon Schaffer]

Look unto the days of warning
A night that the sky is burning
When stars collide
Pure mathematical perfection
Ancient pain feeds resurrection
When stars collide

Forged in flames, sacred fire
Born in eastern sands of guile

Born is he, ten millennia
After the Clouding of man
Sincerest veneration
For he that vindicates the end of man
Sworn are we, ten millennia
After the Clouding of man
Unleash abomination
As we accelerate the end of man
