[Music and lyrics: Jon Schaffer]

We're gathering, summoned by the elder
The consequence of what's imminent
A prophecy dark and foreboding
Forces them to face human intent

The chosen seek refuge in the mountains
Reluctantly the loved ones recognize
The sacrifice they must adhere to
The only hope for future Setian life
Like a martyr sacrificed

Await the days of Clouding
Earth Mother's sharing in our pain
Erase the human memory
They know not of where they came
And though our hearts are broken
We have to wipe the tears away
In vain they did not suffer
Ten thousand strong will seize the day

What we possess, mankind is after
Direct descendants of the Architect
Children of God, seeds of creation
Stakes so high we must never relent

We lie in wait 'til the human minds are clouded
Initiation of the Master Plan
Assimilate, build new life among them
Centuries will pass, patience will win
We are the bane of man

Await the days of Clouding
Earth Mother's sharing in our pain
Erase the human memory
They know not of where they came
And though our hearts are broken
We have to wipe the tears away
In vain they did not suffer
Ten thousand strong will seize the day
