[Music / Lyrics : Jon Schaffer]

Time, thousands of years pass by
But with the ancient rites in tact
Man, mankind has multiplied
Spreading worldwide as planned
Kings and their armies preen
Draw lines in the sand
Fight for their so called rights
To God, gold and land

And through the ages we hand them their fate
Marionettes on a string
Phased retribution precise and exact
'Til the birth of The One sets us free

Blood, Earth Mother's soaked in blood
Spilled from the warring clans of man
Greed will serve to feed unrest
Antagonized within by our hand
Pain, death and pestilence
Will shake human faith
Creeds serving heresy
A crutch for Mans flawed way

And through the ages we hand them their fate
Marionettes on a string
Phased retribution precise and exact
'Til the birth of The One sets us free
