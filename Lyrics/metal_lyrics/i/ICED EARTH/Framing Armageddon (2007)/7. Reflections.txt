[Music : Jon Schaffer / Lyrics : Tim Mills]

As I reflect on the situation
A heavy heart for the task at hand
I witnessed savagery
Hands tied to destiny

The exodus of the chosen
As foreseen in the prophecy
Hiding until it's time
To cloud all the human minds

When they spoke of the invasion
We were chosen from ties that bind
Bloodlines through centuries
Destined to be the ones to lead

The twelve and I, a new high council
Absorb the power of the Watcher's eye
The high priest resides in me
The Elder lives on in all thirteen
