[Music : Jon Schaffer / Lyrics : Tim Mills]

We must be swift
Integrating with man
Instating the vision of the Master Plan
We'll placate the humans in need

Their form we have taken
Their tongue we can speak
Plotting and planing, total secrecy
We'll infiltrate and take the lead

Misery unfolding for the rest of time
A world that they created for their vicious crimes

This is the start of
What is meant to be
Infiltrate, Assimilate, fulfill our destiny

The ten thousand chosen
Charged with our creed
Ensuring division in societies
Instate the Domino Decree

Lead them to wander
New land, 'cross the seas
Creating new cultures, fascist or free
Division will bring them to their knees

Misery unfolding for the rest of time
A world that they created for their vicious crimes

This is the start of
What is meant to be
Infiltrate, Assimilate, fulfill our destiny
