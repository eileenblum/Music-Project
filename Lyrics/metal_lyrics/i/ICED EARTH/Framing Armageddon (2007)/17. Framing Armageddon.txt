[Music : Jon Schaffer]

Centuries pass step by step
Revelations coming threat
Sand of time dark intent
Divise creeds breeds discontent
Prophecy, stars collide
Born is he who turns the tide
Ancient rage, vehemence
Indignation and torment

Dark equation, astrology
Armageddon, the reckoning
Revelation, astral beast
Armageddon, the reckoning

Shallow views, intolerance
Jewish, Muslim, Protestant
The root of man's insolence
Lies in fear and arrogance
A valid threat if they unite
Moses, Muhammad, Jesus Christ
Born of man with second sight
Twist their words we will divide

Dark equation, astrology
Armageddon, the reckoning
Revelation, astral beast
Armageddon, the reckoning

If humans learn what's truly at stake
And of the birth of Set Abominae
Their primitive minds, a maddened state, no
Frame it as the Elder deemed
Frame it our way

Framing Armageddon!
Framing Armageddon!
Framing Armageddon!
Framing Armageddon!
