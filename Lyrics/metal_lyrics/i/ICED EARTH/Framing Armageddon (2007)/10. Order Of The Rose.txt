[Music / Lyrics : Jon Schaffer]

Passed down through centuries
The Order lives and feeds upon them
A global fraternity
Philanthropy, tactical deception
In plain sight throughout all time
Contriving human decline
Instilling those who lead
Seizing opportunities

Rise of Setian Evocation
And the Order thrives
So the day arrive of His birth
Rise of Setian Evocation
And the Order lives for the day
Of Man's Coming Curse

Create divisive creeds
Embrace the fact man needs religion
Prophets, Saviors and Priests
All convinced they have the answers
The truth is they'll never know
Behind faith they'll hide and hope
We'll build them a martyr son
Sacrificial lamb, the holy one

Rise of Setian Evocation
And the Order thrives
So the day arrive of His birth
Rise of Setian Evocation
And the Order lives for the day
Of Man's Coming Curse

The object of their divide
So convinced their way is right
The narrow view of all mankind
In the name of God they will divide
