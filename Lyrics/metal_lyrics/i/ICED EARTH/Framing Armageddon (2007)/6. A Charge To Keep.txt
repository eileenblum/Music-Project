[Music / Lyrics : Jon Schaffer]

I must believe that what's a memory now
Was the only way
To know that all of those you love
Were just stripped away
And now, if I'm the one to lead us
Into a brand new day
At peace I must be with the brutal truth
To truly lead the way

Please God give me the strength to lead
It's my charge to keep
Make the sorrow the fuel I need
It's my charge to keep

And now we must wipe the tears away
Gather up our inner strength
The loss of those we can't replace
Will bring about their fate
And though many lifetimes it will take
To bring justice on our way
We must never falter, we must never fail
This is our charge to keep

Please God give me the strength to lead
It's my charge to keep
Make the sorrow the fuel I need
It's my charge to keep
