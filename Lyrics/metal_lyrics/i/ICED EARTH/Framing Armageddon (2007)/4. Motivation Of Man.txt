[Music / Lyrics : Jon Schaffer]

...at last we will claim
What is rightfully ours
Absolute power, absolute knowledge
All the galaxies and the subjects therin
Will kneel before the human race
Unlimited power
Unlimited knowledge
Mankind will be one with the Architects of the Universe

At last within my grasp
We are one step closer to cleansing
We claim the universe
Causing galaxies to cower
Unlimited power
Unlimited knowledge for...
Man will no longer be seen
as primitive or inferior
Unlimited power
Unlimited knowledge for Man
