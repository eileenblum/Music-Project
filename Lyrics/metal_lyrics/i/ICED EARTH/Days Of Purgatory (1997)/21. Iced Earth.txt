[Music: Schaffer / Lyrics: Schaffer]

What do I see
On the icy plains
The desolate one
It's my terrain
The wind it blows cold
Howling my name
I am the king
The king of this waste
Can't you see this barren land
Lain to waste
Ravaged, scorched, yet frozen
From your neglect
I am the formless one
I came to save
You are the chosen ones
You'll be my slaves
I stand on the glacier
Above it all
Watching them crumble
Watching them crawl
Iced Earth has risen
Nature will fall
Death and destruction, mother of all

Can you feel the madness here
Drawing you all too near
Earth, fire, water and air
Save yourselves from despair
We are together now
Crush the cowards, do it now
End the light, end the one
We have come to save the young ones
So on an on
The story goes
Destroying yourselves
The pain it shows

"....In this collection you will hear songs that were written in a time
span from 1986 to 1994.  So for some of you this will be a stroll down
memory lane and for you newer fans you will hear some classic  I.E.
re-mixed, re-sung and on a few tunes, bass and drums re-done. All of these
older songs, in my opinion, are better than what was originally released...."

"...the idea to use the word purgatory in the title...works for two reasons.
1.) It was the original name of the band from 1984-1989. 2.) It also
symbolizes the many years of "suffering" and "paying dues" we have endured
to get where we are now.  And though we have a long road ahead of us things
are definitely on the upswing...."

"....In the eyes of this artist Iced Earth and metal music are a life long
commitment and we're not budging, we are metal and we're proud of it.  Yes,
Iced Earth will mature and we will grow, but you can count on us being ever
faithful to ourselves and our art, and for this I'm sure you will always be
satisfied as the listening audience.  Iced Earth will always play what we
believe in.  Fuck Trends and Fuck Posers!!!"
