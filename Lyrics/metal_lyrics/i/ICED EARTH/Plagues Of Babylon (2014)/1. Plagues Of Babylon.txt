We lie in wait
Time is drawing near
Earth crisis is all too clear
The human virus starting to awake
So we must manipulate

We can't accept this human threat
The power structure is intact
As gods on earth we will forsake
We must release the plague!

So if you're asking yourself, "Why?"
Your eyes are blind to the raging storm
Will they cleanse the earth of humanity?
Unleash the plagues of Babylon?

Compliance
Submission
Cowards
Led astray
Traitors
Liars
Deceivers
Have their way

"And this shall be the plague with which the gods will strike all the people that wage war against them.
Their flesh will rot while they are standing on their feet.
Their eyes will rot in their sockets.
And their tongues will rot in their mouths."

There's no escape
They feed from our hands
Our minions plot
As they make their stand
As gods on earth
We have foreseen
We'll make the peasants bleed!

So if you're asking yourself, "Why?"
Your eyes are blind to the raging storm
Will they cleanse the earth of humanity?
Unleash the plagues of Babylon?

So if you're asking yourself, "Why?"
Your eyes are blind to the raging storm
Will they cleanse the earth of humanity?
Unleash the plagues of Babylon?
