This blasphemy, why can't you see?
Their crimes are crystal clear
Deception reigns, you live in chains
You can no longer feel
In your eyes there is no life
Only flesh and blood
Fluoride heads, the walking dead, no fight to stay alive

[Pre-chorus:]
Our minds are numb, our body's overcome
They beat us down, bread and circus
This is our destiny, spawned from their master's creed
A vicious plot to cull the masses

They set the trap, you took the bait
Diseased, they vaccinate
Create the fear, create the pain
In chaos they will reign
Spewing lies, a thin disguise
To mask their true intent
Depopulate, with quiet rage
Patience will feed revenge

[Pre-chorus]
Our minds are numb, our body's overcome
They beat us down, bread and circus
This is our destiny, spawned from their master's creed
A vicious plot to cull the masses

[Chorus]
We reign within the shadows
Fomenting their treason
Soulless corrupted vessels
Don't question our motives

It's clear to see, in history
The harvester of death
The trusting herd will never learn
They just repeat the test
In your eyes there is no life
An empty shell inside
Fluoride heads, the living dead, victims of democide

[Pre-chorus]
Our minds are numb, our body's overcome
They beat us down, bread and circus
This is our destiny, spawned from their master's creed
A vicious plot to cull the masses

[Chorus]
We reign within the shadows
Fomenting their treason
Soulless corrupted vessels
Don't question our motives

We reign within the shadows
Fomenting their treason
Soulless corrupted vessels
Don't question our motives
