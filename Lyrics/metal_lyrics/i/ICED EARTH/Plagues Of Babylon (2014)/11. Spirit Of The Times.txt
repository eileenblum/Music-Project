[originally by Sons Of Liberty]And as I sit and ponder
Regrets I have no longer
But the questions still remain
A world filled with injustice
Division, pain and violence
Will we ever find our way?
I look deep in their eyes
The fear I see makes me cry
Itâs the truth we must embrace

You may take me
But youâll never break my will
My soul is not for sale
I fear nothing
Justice will prevail
My soul is not for sale

This is my commitment
And darkness, Iâll resist it
And if danger comes my way?
Well, Iâll stand firm in knowing
The truth just keeps on growing
Weâre getting stronger everyday
If they take my fleshly body
Then I truly am free
My spirit will remain

[2x]
You may take me
But youâll never break my will
My soul is not for sale
I fear nothing
Justice will prevail
My soul is not for sale
