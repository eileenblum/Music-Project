Where can I turn?
Youâve gone away
I grieve in silence
So much Iâve learned to life today
Still I need your guidance

You always found the words to say
To ease my troubled mind.
Now youâre gone.
I feel alone.
If I could see you one more time

If I could see you now
Youâd help me find my way
If I could see you now
Youâd help me find my way

Where can I turn?
Youâve gone away
I need your words of wisdom
Sometimes Iâm lost and in a rage
Taking things for granted

You were the one who did believe
When no one else could see
If I could share whatâs on my mind
If I could see you one last time

If I could see you now
Youâd help me find my way
If I could see you now
Youâd help me find my way

[2x]
If I could see you now
Youâd help me find my way
Iâll find the strength somehow
Iâll fight to seize the day
