We see the air is thick
Between the ocean and the forest mist
This blackened ocean calling for us

Our minds are drawn to hate's eternal storm
The being screams its name, it howls for more
This spawning creature rises to our shore

Dark soul of the elder gods
Spawning evil from the ocean's floor
Shape shifter fools all mankind
To manipulate this world

Mankind is hypnotized
We're standing paralyzed

We are minions in the master plan
Evil falls into unconscious minds
Building armies for the chosen one
To dominate this world

Our future will be drowned
The dark one will be crowned

We are grains in the sands of time
His power gained through the passing tides
Soon he'll rise draining life and air
Leaving man in despair

The scriptures on the wall
Hear the Cthulhu's call

[Chorus]
You will see the visions peel away
Shape shifting demon
Casting spells upon the human race
Death phoenix rising
Tainted by his vile heinous stare
Consciousness fading
We are misted by his salted air
Cursing our spirit

All behold as the Cthulhu rises
Taking its form from the ocean floor
His tentacles grasp embrace with power
We're tantalized transfixed by evil

Spewing anger on the land below
We submit to the creature's form
Demigod reigning with his power
We're twisted, broken and torn

The age has reached us now
The dark one has been crowned

[Chorus 2x]
You will see the visions peel away
Shape shifting demon
Casting spells upon the human race
Death phoenix rising
Tainted by his vile heinous stare
Consciousness fading
We are misted by his salted air
Cursing our spirit
