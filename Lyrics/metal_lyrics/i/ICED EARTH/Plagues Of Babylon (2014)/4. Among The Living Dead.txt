As was promised you
Pathogen's upon them
This creation out of control
They've come back to life
Their hunger is unrelenting
The flesh will ease their pain

They will never take us
Our numbers are too strong
They'll never see the light of day
Waves of the undead storm
Draining life from their path
Spreading death and vile decay

[Chorus]
When in the darkness, the groans are all we hear
The sunshine rises, they never disappear
When they come, the evil possession
Sweeps through us all and we fall
When we rise, a gruesome creation
Enslaving the dead as their pawns

[Bridge]
They've built themselves an army
Mindless, void and violent
Crushing all opposition
And those preaching resistance

Roaming armies of death
The plague sweeps across the land
Created by the hands of men
Body's ripped to shreds
The stench makes us sick
Among the living dead

[Chorus]
When in the darkness, the groans are all we hear
The sunshine rises, they never disappear
When they come, the evil possession
Sweeps through us all and we fall
When we rise, a gruesome creation
Enslaving the dead as their pawns
