As we gaze uncertain of the future
Breaking dawn reveals impending rapture
The darkest days seem to fall behind us
We stand tall with pure defiance

Stench of death is thick with carcass and decay
Destiny obscured, have we been led astray?
Forge ahead, we will scale the mountain
We are focused on the path of inner light

Salvation, we are chanting to the sun
Drawn closer, we're fearless to the end
Torch the dead, see the burning embers
Eradicate this disease, reclaim the earth

Bodies cleansed, our land purged of this nightmare
Standing tall with those who truly are aware
We survived, is it really over?
we are clinging to the thread human of life

[Chorus]
Are these illusions in our minds?
Or will the plagues come back in time?
Will we survive to find a new life?
Or will the rage reclaim us?
Feeding on our yearning for the end

[Bridge]
Everything seems perfect and surreal
Can't help but wonder if this is the end
Look around as paranoia swells
Are we safe? only time will tell

We feel uneasy
Vagabonds drifting all around
The aftermath of their global cleansing
We survived the attempt of mass genocide

Is this the end?

[Verse 3]
We are guided to the clean and promised land
Seek a life, live where darkness has an end
This horizon leads us to our freedom
Reminiscing, all the plagues and death behind

[Chorus 2x]
Are these illusions in our minds
Or will the plagues come back in time?
Will we survive to find a new life
Or will the rage reclaim us?
Feeding on our yearning for the end
