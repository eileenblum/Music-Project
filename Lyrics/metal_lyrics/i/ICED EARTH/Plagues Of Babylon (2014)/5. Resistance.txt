On your knees is where you'll be when we find you
Smoke you out, a den of thieves, we've succumbed to
You stand warned, your mindless horde
We will not falter
You think you're gods upon the Earth
We smash your altar

No more time to justify or look for reason
We will survive, we will defy this blatant treason
We are strong, we stand tall, we'll face the judgement
We are alive, we will survive this corruption

[Chorus]
Take a deep breath, winds of freedom
Spread like fire through the minds of brothers
Love the fallen, fight the tyrants
Face the challenge and you'll never falter

[Bridge]
They think it's over
That victory is imminent
They will fail
Safe in the illusion their treason goes unpunished
The vicious crimes against their fellow man
They suppress and enslave us
An endgame of total death

We shall rise and resist!

You think you've won, we're overcome
But we have risen
You can't deny, your cloak of lies no longer hidden
You're going down, you are exposed in your deception
We'll string you up, you all will die
We're reaping vengeance

[Chorus]
Take a deep breath, winds of freedom
Spread like fire through the minds of brothers
Love the fallen, fight the tyrants
Face the challenge and you'll never falter

Take a deep breath, winds of freedom
Spread like fire through the minds of brothers
Love the fallen, fight the tyrants
Face the challenge and you'll never falter

We shall rise and resist!
