Send them down to the pits of hell
we clipped the angel's wings and watched them as they fell
spiral into the silence

Blackened sun turns the ancient tides
mountains crumble and we watch the oceans rise
the dawn of the end approaching

Space and time cull the chosen damned
as demigods we will reign across the land
our shadow creates the darkness

Tempered skies shape the oracle of time
Shattered future makes them prisoners in their minds
Our power creates the darkness

[2x]
We will tear the weak from the strong
to enslave the masses
Our storm has come, see the times are ending
until the culling is over

Take their bodies
We will kill them all

This divide wicked factions shape our plan
Taint the sky, we disease the Earth and man.
Follow us to the endgame

[2x]
We will tear the weak from the strong
to enslave the masses
Our storm has come, see the times are ending
until the culling is over
