Destiny's called us
It's the reckoning
This time it's for blood
Don't tread on me
Revenge is not justice
It's the reckoning
This time it's for blood
Don't tread on me

You went too far this time
for this heinous crime
You will know defeat
Begging on your knees

One by one you'll fall
Your back against the wall
Nowhere to turn
You're sure to burn

Destiny's called us
It's the reckoning
This time it's for blood
Don't tread on me

The hours close at hand
We'll make our final stand
Justice shall be done
Nowhere to run

True evil broods in you
You're just a brainwashed fool
The coward close that hides
Spewing forth his lies

Revenge is not justice
It's the reckoning
This time it's for blood
Don't tread on me

Born of destruction, bred in agony
Is this my salvation?
From these ashes, i am your devastation

If it was up to me
Eye for an eye I'd seek
But the high road we will take
Lady Justice is at stake

The Judgement has been made
In blood it shall be paid
Death knows what to do
The horseman comes for you.

Destiny's called us
It's the reckoning
This time it's for blood
Don't tread on me
Revenge is not justice
It's the reckoning
This time it's for blood
Don't tread on me
