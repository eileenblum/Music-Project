Close your eyes and imagine
the soldier at Valley Forge
The suffering that he endured was real
starvation, total war.
Yet in has eyes the iron will to win
and for the cause, he won't relent

[Chorus]
Would he look upon us now
in anger and disgust?
His providence, our birthright and our creed
Will we let ignorance and laziness
bring our demise
Complacency, we're blinded by our greed

Standing barefoot, frozen bloody hands
his musket clutched, an iron grip
and for the cause, he has but one regret,
he's only got one life to give

[Chorus]
Would he look upon us now
in anger and disgust?
His providence, our birthright and our creed
Will we let ignorance and laziness
bring our demise
Complacency, we're blinded by our greed

It's time for us, to open up our eyes,
and cherish the lives we all can have
and to the ones who've kept our freedom free
words can't express all that you've done

[Chorus]
Would he look upon us now
in anger and disgust?
His providence, our birthright and our creed
Will we let ignorance and laziness
bring our demise
Complacency, we're blinded by our greed
