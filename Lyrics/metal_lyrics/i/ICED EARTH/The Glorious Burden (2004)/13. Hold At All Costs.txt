[July 2nd, 1863]

Just a mile or so away
Lives my dearest friend in this world.
He wears the Blue and I the Grey
And god it hurts me so
The last time we were together
I grabbed his hand and I pledged
If I ever draw my sword on you
May the good lord strike me dead.

The union flank's in trouble
To the round top on the double
A bad decision, insubordination
Exposed our line in a dangerous way

The burden lies upon us
Surrender is not an option
We are the flank and if we break
The union crumbles, We could lose the war!

Down below's the carnage
The rebel's charging onward
Push the slaughter forward the Peach Orchard.
Through the Wheat Field and Devil's Den

The valour of the Texans
And Alabama's best men
They're unrelenting and devastating
The last full measure of devotion's clear.

[Chorus:]
We know what we're made of.
When up against all odds we hold our line
For the cause that we so love
We must hold at all cost
We know what we're made of
when our nation needs us we'll stay the course
for the union we so love
We must hold at all costs!

Wave after wave they're coming
Their power must be waning!
We're out of ammo, we can't fall back, no!
One desperate measure, a means to end

On their next wave we charge them
There is no other option
Disconcert them, force submission
On my command, fix bayonets!

[Chorus:]
We know what we're made of.
When up against all odds we hold our line
For the cause that we so love
We must hold at all cost
We know what we're made of
when our nation needs us we'll stay the course
for the union we so love
We must hold at all costs!

[Chorus:]
We know what we're made of.
When up against all odds we hold our line
For the cause that we so love
We must hold at all cost
We know what we're made of
when our nation needs us we'll stay the course
for the union we so love
We must hold at all costs!
