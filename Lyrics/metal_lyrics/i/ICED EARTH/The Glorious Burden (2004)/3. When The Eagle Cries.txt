Another day, just like any other
out of the blue, it turned to horror
How could they?
Why would they?
The innocents suffered hell's inferno
An senseless act that goes unforgotten
How could they?
They will pay.

[Chorus:]
When the Eagle Cries
Blood will flow
When the Eagle Cries
For freedom's fight
When the Eagle Cries
We love her so
When the Eagle Cries
We will sacrifice

Out of the ashes came a tempted vengeance
but we are focused, we seek redemption
we are free
we'll stay free
All they've done is make us stronger
The sleeping giant is asleep no longer
If need be
we'll die free

[Chorus:]
When the Eagle Cries
Blood will flow
When the Eagle Cries
For freedom's fight
When the Eagle Cries
We love her so
When the Eagle Cries
We will sacrifice
