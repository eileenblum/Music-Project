He's ruled them for twenty years
And ravaged as their king
Conquest burns in his eyes
And ice shoots through his veins
Their leader's new ambitions lie
Further to the West
The Empire that he seeks
The Father to the Rest
Attila wants to take his place
Like the impetuous son
To make the entire world bow
To the kingdom of the Huns

Alliance has been made
With many other clans
Frank and Vandal forces
Held within his hand
And by Attila's hand it's said
His brother met with death
To make his rule his legacy
He did his awful best
Ethele and Etzell
By many names he's known
But "Scourge of God" is the one
That rings the darkest tone

[CHORUS]
Hell awaits behind Gaul's gates
The Roman's stand only to fall
They will die by his sword
The barbarian lord
Attila hear's victory call

[BRIDGE]
[Huns]
Path of Fire and Plunder
Cities burn and crumble
Atila's fate beckons
He will come to conquer

[Romans]
Archers stand at ready
Centurions all together
Keep to your lines
And the Mongol's sure to falter

[Huns]
We will surely break them
We will overtake them
Fight till our deaths
On the Christians devastation

[Romans]
They won't overthrow us
God will stand before us
Show us the path to the Huns destruction

Sing to the sky, the battle cry
To propagate their fears
As terror is the weapon drawn
When battle has drawn near
And so the conflict is at hand
The gauntlet has been thrown
Contempt for the Christian reign
The poison seed now sewn
And if by chance all is lost
Cut down by Roman steel
We'll suffer not as others have
Broken mind nor broken will

[REPEAT CHORUS]
