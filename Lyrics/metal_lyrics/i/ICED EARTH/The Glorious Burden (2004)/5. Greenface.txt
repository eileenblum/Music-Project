A warrior down to the depths of my soul
I terrorize evil thats out of control.
On land, in the air, at sea
On danger I feed
My warpaint, the last things my enemies see
Their teeth and their ears are trophies for me
On land, in the air, at sea
I'll be where the metal meets the meat
GREENFACE
GREENFACE
Lagoons deep in the jungles are home for me
The desert nor mountains, they can't hide from me
On land, in the air, at sea
I'll be where the metal meets the meat
GREENFACE
GREENFACE
