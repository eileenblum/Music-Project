Emptiness, consuming me
Head in hands, I can hardly speak
Looking for solitude
Lost in humanity
True knowledge leads to suffering
A constant quest an endless dream
Searching for inner peace
Hidden so deep in me

Don't wanna be a hollow man
Ain't gonna be the hollow man

Sadness comes knocking constantly
Filling up my eyes, for all to see
Peace will come someday
I pray that it finds a way
Darkness caressing my mind and soul
My spirits rejecting, I'm feeling whole
Emptiness goes away
Fills with the light of day

Don't wanna be a hollow man
Ain't gonna be the hollow man

I rise up like the phoenix
from the ashes of an older way
With wisdom gained, I turn away
I turned away
Hollow man find yourself some other Plan

Don't wanna be a hollow man
Ain't gonna be the hollow man
