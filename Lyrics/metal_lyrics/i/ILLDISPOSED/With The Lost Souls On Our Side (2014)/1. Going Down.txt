I'm going down, just needed to say
With the feeling over, all out of the way
And I can see you're hurting
Even more than me
When the system tatters, trying to break free
Let's go

You simplify, all of my lies
When you tell our friends, that I'm dead

Going down, sing again
When the price is in
As I feel the pressure
Pumping through the veins

Going down, sing again
And without a friend
You will have me crawling
Through the streets tonight

I'm going down, in every way
As a slave to your hand, let me pray
And I can see you're smiling
Laughing over me
Let's go undecided
