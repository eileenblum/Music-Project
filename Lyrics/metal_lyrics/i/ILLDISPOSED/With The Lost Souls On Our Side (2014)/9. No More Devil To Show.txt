This is how we rule purely
Riding again
And to fail we are sure
There is no end

[Chorus:]
No more devil to show
Knowing what we repent
In the light of our dark
Will be no giving in

Be the might of my sword
Killing again
To deliver the fight
And to win

Rising in your eyes, the fear I know
You are in the dark, acceptingly over

[Chorus]

I can see that you're waiting
Begging again
Taking over your heart
Freeing the pain
