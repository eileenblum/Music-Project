For nothing at all
I will join in your life
Put together the pieces
You have puzzling my mind

I drink to your soul
I live in the night
An essence of evil
Preparing to fight

[Chorus:]
So let go
Feel the way we move
Tugging at your heart
Like I always do

To be at my will
Not feeling so tall
Defining the way
Avoiding to fall

Sentence the dead
To stay in the dark
You need to accept
And carry the mark

[Chorus]

My final goal
Not to go back
The mind of a fool
Racing in my head

[Chorus]
