In every sad way
I still look at your name
Why won't you join us?
How could you leave?

When will you see, when will you find out
Stop asking where we should be
I lost my place in life
When will you find out, if I am the one
Just set me free
Be my light in the dark

You're such a mess now

At my grave, you will kneel
Come to rest, but feel no loss
You share no wish to be
Set me free and I'll leave
Pending, never look back
I need you to stay

You forget who I am

Invading in my way
And forgetting your name
Never to join us
How could you leave?
