This is not a game - I've already lost
I'm being followed in the dark

In my domain, will not return
And harmony, won't let me win
Your silent scream
Feed off my heart
The heating sun
I burn along

Don't come for me
I won't be here - anymore

I tried to discover
I went to another, soul taker

We will save, what will not die
In charity, my end completes
This lullaby, I sing for you
This heating sun
Will burn my love

Don't come for me, I won't be here
My victory, nobody cares

Giving time, for what it is
Doing less, my innocence
Lost love, lead the blind
Bury dreams, in your mind
