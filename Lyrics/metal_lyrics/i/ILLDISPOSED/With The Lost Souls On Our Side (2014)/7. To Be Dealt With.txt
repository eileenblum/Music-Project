Enjoying private time
Sent away to explore this hole
In which we're digging hard
Only finding evidence, that you're away

And so her brothers came
Suddenly, we could feel again

[Chorus:]
Posing not just as a threat
Also a way to regret now
Keeping us all within your reach
To be dealt with quickly

In god we trust
To come and save all of us
Will shine for you
Will tell the whole world what to do

[Chorus]

With the love I have for you
Will go insane
There is no difference
In the way, we feel the same

Stop running, turn around
Play the game - do it now
