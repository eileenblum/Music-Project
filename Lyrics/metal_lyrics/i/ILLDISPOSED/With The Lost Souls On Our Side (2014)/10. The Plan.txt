[Chorus:]
Uncertainty - belongs to me
The way it feels - confirming it
Inspired mist - enfolds the land
The devils plan - now unveiled

Fire, burning down our souls, we crumble
Evil, starting to take toll, on me
Mortal, will forever die, tonight
You show, a hellish force of might, seance

The poles have been reversed, you look alive

Liar, you deserve my worst, beating
Crying, empty out your heart, dripping
Make out, tell me how I feel, endless
Remain, stay here in the light, forever

Talking, spitting out my words, hurtful
Inner, visions left for god, anger
Army, fighting on my side, battle
Calling, cutting through my sight, simple

I have no feelings here at all, you feel alive
No one remembers my embrace, not at this time

Seeking words of wisdom, joining minds
Expiring system, hands of time

[Chorus]
