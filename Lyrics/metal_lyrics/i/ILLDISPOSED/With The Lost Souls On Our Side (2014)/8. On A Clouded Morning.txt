The thought of denying
Never crossed my mind
Of people crucifying
I feel you all the time

[Chorus:]
Because you are my hate
Refusing the ring
I can't even argue
On a clouded morning

A slowly acceptance
Now closer to god
The parting of angels
My kind has no blood

[Chorus]

You'll have me dead
It's not like, you'll fight
There's a sight, I'd love to see

I see you coming
Leaving me, violently
Dare to be, on your way

The faith of your hand
Controlling the game
And acting a man
Will have my revenge

[Chorus]
