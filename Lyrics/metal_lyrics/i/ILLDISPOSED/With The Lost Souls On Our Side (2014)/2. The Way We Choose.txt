With a hunger to see
To find out, what you heard about
We move, just you and me
We go to places out of reach
Finding what others left for weeks

[Chorus:]
And we will share within ourselves
Come let us join another fool
The evening wearing as we melt
Into mirrors of a ghoul

The darkness hanging all the time
Above our faces turned away
Existing only in our minds
Then again, that's where we hide

[Chorus]

And we will share within ourselves
Come let us join another fool
The evening wearing as we melt
Into the way we choose
