A silent dream
A memory forgotten
Just as weird as you and me
A ship well built, without a sea
In this phase I face you all
SUMMER - is my name
But no such thing as sun in my life

All things rotten
The hate in your eyes
A new thing fallen
Never compromise

No shame in starting over again
With a knife I carve my life
Sudden state of failure noticed
Same song, sing the process

And as they say:
You win or lose a game
You all will share my name
Only forward, break not for a soul
It's the life that we've been told
By people meaning well
