To see the final sail
We go into this alone
A misty morning will prevail
We come to take your land

Sword swinging, blood bringing
All winning
Out of Scandinavia
We do this alone

And in the early morning light
Vikings come to your town

Sword swinging, blood bringing
All winning
Gut ripping, blood dripping horde
Alone

Too slow to follow us
That would be as a slave
We awake your disgust
So what? We do this alone
