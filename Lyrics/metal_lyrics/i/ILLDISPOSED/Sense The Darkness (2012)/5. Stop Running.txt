Change the pace, move away
Breathing down your neck
My eyes are set on your defeat
No chance to escape

Stop running - turn around
Stop running - turn around
Stop running - better let me win
Return, best give in
Stop running - turn around

Now it's time, live in fear
Fatal as the end is near
The flashing of a life
Appears within your eyes
