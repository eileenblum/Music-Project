They find a pleasure in killing
The things we love
They torture
I sense the darkness
I sense the pain

And we are innocent - again
Our lust for life is at an end

Inside the church we're hiding
Seeking revenge but do not say
Blasphemous
No one will challenge the cross
Unless I make a stand

I am the SUMMER forgive me
Forget the lies that you've been told
Follow
The fields are open there is light
In this we satisfy
