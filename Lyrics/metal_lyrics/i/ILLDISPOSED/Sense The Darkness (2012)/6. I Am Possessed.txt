The sun will never rise again
And SATAN is my only friend
In freedom I will never trust
Humanity forever lost
The circle spins, around we go
Where it ends, I don't know
In evil you cannot rely
All my needs I'll satisfy

Possessed - I am possessed
In me we trust
I am possessed
Don't give a fuck

My anger shouldn't make you cry
You and I will never die
It's just you - at least for now
I need to stay, make others bow
This story, will it ever end?
Around we go and then again
The truth has found my energy
But lies are all the same to me
