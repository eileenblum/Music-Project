Slay them, retrieve their souls
Make them bleed, internally and out
Suffer slow, let nothing remain
Harvest the wrath, emphasize pain

Apply the pressure
Crank it up
Look at the eyes
Think they're popping out

And with a gentle hand
You will sweep them away
Don't let them take you

Keep the pressure
Keep it up
Dude, look at the eyes
They're coming out

Sometimes I feel like
Going just a little insane
Stay away - else I will bite
The skin on your neck

In control, mine in fact
Plant a seed, harvest the wrath
I am simple, I am black
Never deny violence
