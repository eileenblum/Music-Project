Let me bare witness to your end
To your defeat
It's time to dominate
No one can, no one will
Assist your every need

I am a devil dealing black
Knowing you're alone
And all of this I will attack
Memories will flow

It's time to dominate
Look who fell behind

Your kingdom falls
I'm awake
The second time, I will prevail
All your thoughts including us
Don't stand a chance
I'll rather die

And when I kiss her lips
It's time to dominate
A broken hope, a tired fling
A very very dead thing
