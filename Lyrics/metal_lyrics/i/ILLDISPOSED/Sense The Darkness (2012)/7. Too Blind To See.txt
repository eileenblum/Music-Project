Tell all you've learned
Pass it onto your friends
Demons, pleasure
Eyes shut, but still open
Too blind to see me

By calling out your name
I will make you hear or feel

It wasn't always so
We worked together
Breaking your trust
Broke also us

Too blind to see me
You're too blind to see me

Forget about the past
Focus on the future and me
