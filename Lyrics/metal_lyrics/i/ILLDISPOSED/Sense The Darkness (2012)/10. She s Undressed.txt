Move your ass, clear the way
I need to pass without delay
Remove my clothes as I run
I hope the act has not begun

I run along this open road
My goal is set: a rocking boat
In which she lives and has her way
With boys like me - except they pay

I try to pace my hungry soul
But demons take another toll
At thoughts I have of her undressed
I never saw it live in fact

I reach her place just in time
To see what's on my mind

She's - she's undressed
Cannot believe the way it feels
She's - she's undressed
Kick in the door, as we both scream
