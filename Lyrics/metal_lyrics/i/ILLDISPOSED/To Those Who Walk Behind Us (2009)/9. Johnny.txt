Just let me say this Johnny man, you hold my utter most respect.
And in my vision we are brothers.
It's you and us against the world.
Don't be scared now Johnny man, what said is said and I regret.
We need to hold this together now.
We need need to set this one straight.
Johnny, we're sorry.
Won't you come on home now?
We miss you.
Won't you come on?
What is wrong in my life, that I must get drunk every night?
