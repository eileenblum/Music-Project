So who look all my passions?
Spontaneity released.
I guess I never had this, in boredom we believe.
I he sun is never shining, and neither are you.
Captivity.
Willingly.
I long for everything.
They round you up for Christmas, then Easter takes its toll
You re running through the summer, and suddenly it's cold,
That's my year.
My year of sadness.
No time for joy.
This unscheduled moment.
Please find me, please use me.
Take it down.
I'm feeling down.
Slowly.
Never feeling joy.
Run.
