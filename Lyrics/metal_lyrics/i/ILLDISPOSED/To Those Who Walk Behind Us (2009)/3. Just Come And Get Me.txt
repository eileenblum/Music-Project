I see you coming from behind with you lack of morals, it was expected though.
So what if I've done the things you're telling the world?
I will not I will not change.
Just come and get me.
Intensifies the lullabies you're telling all your kids, about the man whose empathy does not exist.
The blackest heart is always that who beats without a will.
This summer never bends: this man is not for free.
No matter who you are,
It's not a shame to feel afraid.
Or did you ever feel that way?
When all is grey - then don't be late.
You know they'll close the gate.
In certainties we can believe, but believe me: we better not.
