So will you notice please, this statement made in anger.
I've traveled many years, just for you to turn your head away.
Cannot be any clearer: this time I end it all.
My mind has played the tricks.
And for you I will no longer crumble.
Take care and don't ever let me catch you here again.
Just for you to know.
I'm cutting all what's tied (down).
I can do this alone - should have done it right from the start.
And this is not revenge (no).
My brain is working again (no).
This is not an ode: it's just for the record.
I volunteer to never have to see you again. take care.
