I've live inside the wreckage long and care not for what others think.
The scene is set as I walk alone.
To all of you: this is what you get.
The time is right, as I scream upon what's mine.
No co-existing.
My triumph is tonight.
Tho those who walk behind me.
Faster now.
The pace is high as my blood pumps away.
Into shadows of grey I will walk, as I fear only me.
The feeling is mutual.
You eyes gave you away.
No fertile future.
Again I lead the flock.
Walk.
