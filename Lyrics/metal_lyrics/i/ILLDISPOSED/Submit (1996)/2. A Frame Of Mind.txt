As the man I am, I dislike
More purities and feelings send
Into the extacy I hate
Nobody controls me
Maybe it's because nobody wants to
Anyway

They watch the terror
In a maze full of gray we shall rest
Incomplete, fictive mirror
Enchanting the way, I do at my best

When a man disconnects, he will lie
A tale telling meyhem inquiries leading
The poor suckers brain
I'm one of those men
But hey then again: Who's to say

Grey is coming, a broken frame

On the cross, my mirror
Unattended my body decays
A future loss, aching nearer
Soon I'll meet the boss

[The band is talking:]
- Der var et eller andet, jeg syntes der var et eller andet med...
jeg spillede helt ved siden af, jeg tunkte kun pÃ¥ den dukke der
- tihi
- Jeg syn... lagde du ikke mÃ¦rke til hvor mange riffs jeg spillede forkert?
- Jojo

[which translates to something like:]

[- There was something, I thought there was something about... I was]
[playing all wrong... I was only thinking about that doll, you know]
[- (laughing) Teehee]
[- I thin... Didn't you notice how many riffs I played wrong?]
[- Yeah, sure]
