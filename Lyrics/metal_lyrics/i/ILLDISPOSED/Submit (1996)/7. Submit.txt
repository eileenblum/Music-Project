I've climbed your mountains
Sailed down your seas
I've seen the sunlight set in your eyes
I filled with lies

Now, can you help me?
Regain my sights
Fill me with what I need
To make my life complete

Strange follows
Strange follows me
Plain and hollow
The strange that you see

I'm pushing
Pushing harder, pushing

Nobody told me
Led my own life
Nobody said a word
as silence became my friend

No fertile future
You better submit
Stop praying, the infinite saying
That God is bigger than me
