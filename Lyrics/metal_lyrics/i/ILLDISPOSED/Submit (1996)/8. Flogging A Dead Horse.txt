Head thunder lights
My feelings distorted
I sense the pleasure, the goat in me

Fuck

Start flogging the fuckin' dead horse
You know you want to
Start fuckin' the flogged dead horse
You know you've got to

Stare, smile, beat the tradition up
Back to basics a time full of me
Still, smile, return to the wombs
A nineties' caveman to be

Back to basics, the heavy basics
