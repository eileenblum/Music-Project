Lost inside, false memories
Of feeling Hades
You'll feel in vain

Atrocities yet awake
Die kingdom
Die all that's fake

You all forget what they are here about
Justice
Long awaiting life that second time
You lie
Maybe wrong, but will never quit
Faker
Descend in time to enaqued
And mainly sentimental

1996 Pavement Records
