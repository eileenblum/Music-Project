Buying time too blind to see
My figure staring back at me
I wish my death would crack my shell
I wish to God, I wish to Hell

All this time I swore my faith
To what was bad, I contemplate
A session made, a circle hard
A ring of evil taking part

Too unlikely I will live
Another day nothing to get
I wish my death would crack my shell
I wish to God, I wish to Hell

Too unlikely I will live
But who gives a fuck anyway

The darkness: Mine
Forever: Time
The pain is: My game
The game is: My pain

Come with me I'll show you all the wonderful sights
Blessed are thee, who ask not about the blinding
White lights
Join and you will, all that you will, and you will
In the sentence I'll give you, you'll find me
