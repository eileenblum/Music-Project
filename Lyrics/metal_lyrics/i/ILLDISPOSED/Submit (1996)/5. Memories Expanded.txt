Grey sky over black town
The rain, has set me wondering from here
Through pain, slowly watching the decay

A timeless victim of inner strength
With memories expanded

Into the graves my friend
(they are meeting at the graves tonight)
Just decay

And new rising enters my eyes
Faded passions unlimited:
You're much to grim
But I'll slÃ¦ve you I seng

[Note from JP and OW: "SlÃ¦ve you I seng" means "drag you to bed" said (and]
[spelled) in the dreary dialect that is spoken in rhus (well, Stilling, a]
[village outside rhus) where the singer of IllDisposed is from. Grim (which]
[is spoken in Danish) means "ugly"]

Now that my love is gone
