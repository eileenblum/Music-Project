I sense the darkness
To me it's real
And so the purity of sadness
For me a better deal

When you think of the devil
You better think of me
Your own best companion
The only way to be

The gods pause
To contemplate your fate

Take a look at the horizon
Tell me what you see
The sun may never rise
Should have got a tan

A rush in your commitments
A tale to leave untold
My strength will only witness
Heartstrings turning cold

Fading light through your windows
And the passage far beyond
Be truly as your mind goes
Be truly when you're gone
