Nowadays I go blind
when they say there's more to our lives
then all the death and misery
in which I dwell and has my needs

Should say I believe in me
should make some sense in my life
But with a dark wind in my face
I admit I'd rather be dead

But in the darkness they search
for souls to help assisting the minds of the evil erupt
Hidden for mortals revealed
as you're dying in chambers of sonic disgust
Places devoted to serve the almighty
of whom I can say nothing good
In silence I learned to adjust to his temper
I followed my own path again

Introspection
I'm filled with perfection
my inner stream must by caressed
I know what to do with my mortal possessions
but restless
just wanna go back

Mellow entrapments
captures the life of only the weak
not from me
they see the hate in my eyes

She undresses I'm cold
in my eyes she can see where I've been
All of my dreams
reincarnated thoughts from behind
She whispers I'm still the only one
In my eyes she can see where I've been

I feel so heavenly
when the mist clears all of my mind
and I look back to the day
where I was guided into the light

God
as infamous you must obtain my light in your crystal
return it to whome it belongs
Keep out the questions involving my gestures
towards your domain the unknown
Handle my case as if I were your true son
neglecting my chance in this world
Help me provend any wrong turns when crossing
and soon you'll see me again
