Love ain't nothing but sex misspelled
every one must go around the tree of purity and sadness
raised by seed from higher ground
the germs decay and as she left
the promise of the rot as one who bore the pollen highest
wind will will dance as I meet my god

Memories dreams and reflections, passionless feelings of mine
peeling my sobriety, leaving me to die

Hereafter
can death be sleep?
when life is but a dream

Deathbed visions, glimpses of the beyond

The feeling of love caressed with fright
when the sonic vacuum leads you to
the circle of light

An endless wandering has stopped, I kiss the face of change

They say the ray of prophecy is send by someone high above
but when I found a trace of heaven, it send me back without a clue

You pray and pray, obedience to endlessness in confidence
sadly I'm the one who says the only ruler is the night
