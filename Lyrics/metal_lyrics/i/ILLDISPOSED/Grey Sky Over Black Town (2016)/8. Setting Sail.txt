I'm sorry honey
Our ships are about to leave
Not waiting for funny
Battle awaits sword in my hand
In my heart

We wait
Then land
Now screaming
Battle planned

Invited to see
Climb to the top
the taking of land
Never enough

It's never enough
The things we must gain
A plague from the north
We arrive

Too late
Don't pray
Your illusions
Has to and

On purest form I'll reinstate
Never again
Season to come
Help me convince
Victory mine

Your fate
In my hand
Take away
But my plan
