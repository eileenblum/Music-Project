Infected dream
Awake bur holding back at me
In twisted terms
From silence we must learn
A force of might
protecting the church
With all your tears
Will heal the winter
Created plans are yet to fall

Protect the children
Living on the edge
Am scared bur will not listen
Slipping in your blood now

The heavens will
The wasted night is at an end
I saw my life
Ending with the dust

A day vision
moving for the kill
For clouded tension
Gathering the dead

For all the public my flesh is sealed
We link our progress the unreal
The sky so grey this is the force
A fallen angel with no remorse
Not gonna save my crazy soul
A place of fear the world run cold
