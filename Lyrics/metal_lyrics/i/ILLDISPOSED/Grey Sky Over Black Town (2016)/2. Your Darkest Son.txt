Pushing my way to the end
Gain nothing less then a smile
All the depressive and sick
Completing your lies

Burning the face of your hate
Placing the coffin at hand
All you can do is to dig
Eating away

You turned the lights out?
Unholy ways to fall
Your darkest son i am

Ripping the evil inside
Those who will walk behind
Moving ahead to decline
Helpless &amp; Lost

Leading the way of the weak
Taking your will by my hand
Taker of innocent life
Spilling the blood

Who turned the lights out?
Unholy ways to fall
Your darkest son i am
