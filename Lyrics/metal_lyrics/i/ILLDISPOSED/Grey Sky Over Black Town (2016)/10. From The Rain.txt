We are the children
Can see to our might
With possible hate
We joint in the fight

And so the end
We align
Our innocent souls
Come let us go
In from the rain

Under a sky
We will survive
Born in the cold
Planning our fall

Swarming in heat
To consume

Still hear the dripping
Tired of you

Like the one she knows
Now ending my soul
