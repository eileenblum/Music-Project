Where have the searching led to
Can no one point my way?
The wind is blowing hard now
To admit would be too hard so we proceed

You're an angel of the light
For a moment you left my sight
No excuse will heal her back to life
Death is not the end we carry on

Move on
In line with what has been told
We strive to be on the top
And the motion will not stop
We drive ahead

You're the owner of our might
For a while my only guarding light
In the dark will never find a care
To begin is to withhold
Forever

On the second floor
Elevate my soul
Coming back for more
Seducted to
We are alive
Supposedly
Another time
Having it all
