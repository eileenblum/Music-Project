It starts so slowly
The hurting end
Given no way to escape
We face the nothingness
To unwind in our time
To see the the other place
In my prints you will walk
Take cover now

Please try to hide
No second life
All innocent
The summers and

Wake up
It's time to face the truth
No intention to talk
Just give your mind a rest
In with the new we are few
In our right to be
Having no choice but to lie
We dedicate

All we found
Worn and thrown away
In it for the win
Kneeling not to pray

Your blood is wine
Just close your eyes
We lead you in
The after all

Please try to hide
No second life
All innocent
The summers and

The after all
