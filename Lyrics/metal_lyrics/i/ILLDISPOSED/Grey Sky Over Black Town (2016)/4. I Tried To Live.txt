It's time to spill the wrath
Take care of ends that meet
In silence overcome
The fragile won't stay long
To stay will matter much
Alone I pray

Burn the right faith now

Silent time
Eating up
Face the grey
Tormenting
In the night
Coming down

Feel this antidote
Louder than all we know
Pulling away
Shifting me gear

Let's go

You see me pick up
The pace where you left off
The sirens screaming
My hands are steady rocks
The fire burns
They want what we all got
Into my crusade
Won't let you drown now

Like suicide
Black day
Heading down
Black hole
Slipping in
Tried to live
