This time she got me
This time I'm achin'
We're riding on the edge

Off all she bid me
The lies and faking
Worst seemed to be her love

And then she told me
Right in the making
You'll never see a child

The snow so white
Keeps blinding me
A year has gone
Let it all be
You let it all be

Faithful as promised
A rule to live by
The very deepest of my soul

Temptated, honest
And you hear my sigh
Look at your god, then look at me

I'm so dark, black
And slowly I die
But you'll join me on my ride
