Come on, I'll help you
I'll save you, regain you and feel you
Didn't mean to, wasn't intended
To make you wanna cry
Listen, yeah listen
You got to, you need to, I want you
I'll satisfy your every need
If you satisfy me

That's the way I am, I am he

Two hearts, colliding
It's frightening, exciting, the way we are hiding
Our feelings for each other
As if there were another
Hatefull, yeah hateful
It's so cool to hurt you, this way too
I'm pityful don't I know it
But do I give a fuck

The mirror, reflecting
The image neglecting
Though inward I'm searching
I cannot find a single clue
Hippies, you're hippies
You're not strong. You're weakies
Come closer. I hate you
You stink, we'll never be friends
