"You are my life", she said as I looked
"And there ain't no way in which I celebrate
That I live, only you the reason for me"

Fuck that you smelly slut cause, there ain't no
way
I'm going down that road with you bitch
I'm much better looking than that

A very thin line between lovers and haters
I scream, as I drag you nearer to the gates
A line defined by mr. Norman Bates
Your body ripped by my knife, we're at the
gates

Take a look around you
Great colors I smell
Amazing

"Go get a life", I say to her who's life is based
on pleasing me, Yeah I know it may be difficult
actually doing it yourself

But you'll see as you grow old, that there ain't
no way
I'll spend my time on your patheticness
I'm much better looking than that
