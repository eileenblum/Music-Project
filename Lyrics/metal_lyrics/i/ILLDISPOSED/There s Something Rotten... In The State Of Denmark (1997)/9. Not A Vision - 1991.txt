I'm cornered
It's great to believe
That someday, not just any day
I will play
Mainly hypothetic, and pathetic

She's undressed
My heart's in vein
Unfortunate

I've lost
Her fingers fickels me
My trust
She's not worthy

I cannot
Explain how it is
A sex drug
Which eases the pain, don't tell me
I know the addiction
Perfection

Take off your dress and show your breast
Can't wait to fire at all

Into a hole, into another
Down we fall, fails to suffer
