I sneak into the house
It's four in the morning
I had too much to drink
Said I was out with my boys

I can sense and I can feel
A thrilling lust creeping up upon me
No time for pleasure, no time for real
Is this the way I wanted to be

I hit for the bedroom
I slip into bed
I know if I wake her
I'll wake up dead

And I know all my friends
They live the lifes, that I repend
But am I better, am I cool
From where I'm standing, I look like a fool

When I wake up - This time I'm gonna tell her
I want to say - what bothers me
If she complains - and I bet she will
I'll throw her out - when I wake up: Dead

Will she find out
About the other
Other lover
Diane
