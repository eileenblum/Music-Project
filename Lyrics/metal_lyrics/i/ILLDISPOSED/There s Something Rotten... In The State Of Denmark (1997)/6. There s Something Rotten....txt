More power to the people from beyond
More to give to the rightful only one
You look at me then you look into the sky
I lie I lie I lie

I keep on searching for a better way to live
The hardest time is the hate I always give
I wanna hold you, but there ain't no other way
I pray I pray I pray

Can that be right, have I lost so many times
Is this the fight where I'm facing all my crimes
Or is there someone who's only left for me
You'll see you'll see you'll see

What you say, becomes me
All I am, don't you see

To the people from beyond
Living life isn't always all that fun
In your domain, you only hear my cry
I die I die I die
