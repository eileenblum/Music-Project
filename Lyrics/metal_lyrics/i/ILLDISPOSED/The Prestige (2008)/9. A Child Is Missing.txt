A child is missing
Let me be the first
I'll guide you to heaven
My little sister

Wont be long now
Have a little faith
I'll ease your passing
Her spirit whispers

Stupid mistake
Mama cries
That seventies game
Such a sin

A child is missing
Couldn't face life
All we believe
A shadow lifts Her

Carry my hope
Awoke now at last
All for the fact
We buried my sister
