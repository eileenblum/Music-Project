Like cancer
Spreading through the system
There's no life for us
No chance of our survival

All hope
Locked out
Destroyed
By something like

Like Cancer
Raped by the Devil
You need me

The Poison
Spreading in my hull
There's no life for me
No way I can survive

No hope
All gone
Chrushed
By something like

Like cancer
You'll fight me
