A song of myself
It would be a challenge
Could hold my fears and hopes
or mere destroy them

Evolve around my home
Grow into the spirit
Would face the different times
I've met with fate and lost

Lost without being found
My soul is still at search
In a song of myself

And I could sing it to a lune
Without a soul
To see if it would make me feel a Man

Or as darkness closes in
Save us all
From the Evil the destroy this very land

A note to myself
From the files of life
Should I start to Decompose?
While I'm ahead

My youth sends me back
To the state of love
All of which are lost
In a song of myself
