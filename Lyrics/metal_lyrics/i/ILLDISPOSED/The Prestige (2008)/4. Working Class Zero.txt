Working class zero
It happened to me
I thought of us - of what to be

You always were better
Not careless - not free
And then you end up like me

A lot of pain at the factory
And now it hurts when you wake up
Endless life - all hope is gone

End this life

A working class zero
Is something to be
If all is gone and death you see

The Poison inside Us
Is spread by our own needs
A future set to my defeat

And now they laugh at the factory
And lot of pain when you wake up
It's your life - there's just escape
You must try

Working class zero
Your mama still cries
She thinks of you
Of how you died

You always were better
Got careless - then free
And in the end you lost like me

Lucifer over London
There's a - Lucifer over London

[2x]
And six six six
it makes me sick
I'm sick sick sick
of 666

[continue while fading out]
Lucifer over London
There's a - Lucifer over London
