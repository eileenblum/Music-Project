She knows
And she's out to get me
The one - I did betray
She's now a foe

The Trust
Is but a memory apart
The way I spend my time
I lack control

She Knows
And she prepares to see me off
To a place where I lie no more
With a bitter thought I realise
I brought this on myself
...She knows

She knows
But she can still not look at Me
And think that I am more than dirt to her

This place
It's getting harder every day
I dream of you at night
