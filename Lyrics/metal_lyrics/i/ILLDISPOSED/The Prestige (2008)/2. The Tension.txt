The tension!
It fills me up with powers
This final step is tortured
I can't explain the feeling
I get from you this night

A nightmare show
Played on me
A new beginning
The More I See

The Poison
Is spread by words of hatred
We argue more than devils
I can't forgive this treason
You put into my life

I want to leave
But yet I stay
My Humble Spirit
Failed this day

I see you
Do you wanna live?
Cos you sure have me fooled
You're working late

A the child lost it's faith

How can I help?
Have you lost your desire
You're in league with Satan
As were I in the 80's.
