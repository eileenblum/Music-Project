The key to my salvation
Lies in
Where ever I'm able
To show my true self

The key is to let the Poison
Out now
That for so long
Has been eating my heart

Shine on you crazy diamond

The field of my preservation
Takes in
I slowly walk the pace
Suited for my soul

The picture shown by mirrors
Shines not
The way I see myself
Leave it all behind

That's the key to my salvation
