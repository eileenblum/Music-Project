Love is tasted bitter
Bitterness at play
Scorched baby fears the fire
Emotions come to stop

Fear not - I miss you always
Don't wanna change this fact
I shook the devils hand
When you stood by my side

Bitter

Life is tasted bitter
I see that you're a mess
Fighting to kick me out
Battle won't be won

Dread to meet another day
Can't seem to get along
No need - I've been in hell
With you to prove me wrong

Death is tasted bitter
When you are at worlds end
Left is the one desire
Never speak of you again

My spirit will rise
This time to dominate
Remember you're no angel
Love is tasted

Bitter!
