Let's go to hell

High powers stare at my still face
The devil rocks tonight, the devil's in his place

You know the way I feel about these things, when i go down and
Lose the power to command
An ancient force of might play at my feelings and dare me to see
What went wrong in my life

You see me walking still sane
But in the dark I feel

Hell
I see the demons dance in vein
They're quite used to that

High powers led me to this maze
Evil took the time to set me up with fate

And my emotions try to rest for a while but in a second I'll be gone
For evermore
In life I never got to see what it's really like to live without the guilt
I never satisfied
