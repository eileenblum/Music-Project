Hey - how are you holding up now?
Is it the same? I bet it is
Still haven't found your peace?
Still on the edge? I bet you are

Come on man - What can you tell me

I wish I had a god damn life
But to say that would be wrong
Wish my life had just turned out
Better - but my weak is strong

So - will you stay there forever?
All in your grief? I bet you will
Or will you pull it together?
Is it a lie? I bet you can

Come on your fool, lets do it

I wish i could just let it go
But to do that would be hard
My friends will never ever know
How much I try for my part

It's you against the world
Or you against yourself

Rock - please let me guide you
Think it will work? I know it does
I mean we do this as one
Just take my hand I know you can
