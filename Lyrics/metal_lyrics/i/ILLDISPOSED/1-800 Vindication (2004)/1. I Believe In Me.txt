Not an eye was dry
In that second I called my defeat
All the friends have lied
But at least I'm not strapped to my seat

Hey go away
Don't want you to stay
You'll find that inner hate
Hey go away
I Believe in me

[chorus]
You slept when I was awake
It's me who rule the morning
Don't that just make you pissed

When you moved away
Moved away with a head full of shame
That's the way to play
At least when you're part of my game
