In this land we are strong
Vikings - blue eyes
Through the times, prove us wrong

Dark sun, dark minds
grey cities, dark times

[chorus]
And when I look upon the sun
The sight I see is frightening
The end of time has just begun
My baby left

Horse

In this land I were strong
Vikings - blue eyes
Check my story, prove me wrong

Hateful - bad man
Two sons, one gang

My baby's gone
