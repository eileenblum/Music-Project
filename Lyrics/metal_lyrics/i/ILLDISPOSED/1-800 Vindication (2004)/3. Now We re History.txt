Back then she got me
My heart was aching
We lied and lied
We talked the nights away

Don't know whats wrong
My life or just me
Don't see a way out
Can't deal with the pain

[chorus]
But now we're history
Stories told in a playful kind of way
Too much too long and so it ends for us
I dread to think of what could have been

A year has gone
Just let it all be
This is the real me
It's what I've waited for

You were an angel
But you deceived me
This is where I get off
Here comes my stop now

Not for my eyes to see
For what I saw was another man
Embraced by your hand
