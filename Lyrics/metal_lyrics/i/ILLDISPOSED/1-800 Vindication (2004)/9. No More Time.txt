More power to the people from beyond.
What I used to say...
Won't leave the job half done

We'll take another round
Never saw it coming
The boys are back in town

Wake up
We're about to land
And we've tightened our act

No more time for that mellow crap
About time you called in the boys

We put our feet down - touch the ground
And we make it last
Don't want to fight this round

You'll see another core
In which you'll trust
The boys are on the floor

No more time for that mellow way
Regarless opinions
We guarantee we'll stay

There is no other game
We want to play
The boys are all the same
