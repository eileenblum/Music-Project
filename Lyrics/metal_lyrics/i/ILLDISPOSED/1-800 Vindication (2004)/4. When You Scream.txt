War, suffer, and later we will unite
Pearls, wanted, my back turned here is the fight
Hate, wine, yeah - yeah
Baby, here comes the pain

[chorus]
You scream at my wrongs
But yelling won't make it right
In time all you invoked
Was a game I played so right

Mind, hunger, now locked up every night
Try, feel - see things through my eyes
You - you made this hell, you really did
This is why I fell - when you

Screamed at my wrongs
Your yelling didn't succeed
In time all you gave
Was a game that tied my feet

They've stopped running now
And so have I

Count, shame - soon you'll feel me again
Endless, relentless - the word is revenge
Hurt, drugs, yeah - yeah
Honey - I owe you this much
