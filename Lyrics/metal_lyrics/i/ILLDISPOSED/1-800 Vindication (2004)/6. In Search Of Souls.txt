It's sick mama - but it's back down on your knees
You'll scream and I'll laugh, the sickest I can be
Come on baby you'll even learn my name
It's pain - it's your gain - just fucking go away
I'll introduce you honey

[chorus]
Inside
Where creatures come and go
In search of souls
Inside
Your heart is empty but who looks

It's time, just close your eyes
Search, obey - baby feel my needs
Know the pain, as it hurts your soul
Fall you cunt - fall into place

You will now taste my hand
