Just pain
Where I go
My way
I saw it all

Hiding from my enemies
This time the end was near
I'm fighting possibilities
I'll find at the end of my fear

Taking the final step tonight
Losing my breath just can't deny

Stood strong
Stand tall
I'm gone
Cooked up

Feeding on my own will
Having all the cards in hand
Saving for that final bill
Bless the soil I call my land
