Go

My footprints are bigger than yours
In all aspects of life
To follow, to feel, to be one
I need you to be more than this

I need your promise
That you will try
To see the world
Out of my eyes

This is my winter - I'm all depressed
Be a witness to my decay
Don't need to promise me anything
Just do this- you shouldn't think
No

Of evil destruction - you feed from my veins
I see that you soon are learning
The sentence is above your head
Just close your eyes - and fly away
