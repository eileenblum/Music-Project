And when we dream
Converted nightmare
Words are shallow
You never cared
And when we touch
I'm never frightened
I need the taste - the taste of you

When I submit
You are my master
This is no game
We never play
I'm so lost
Have you noticed?
All for the taste - the taste of you

There is no love
In your heart
Forceful emotions
I am betrayed
And I feel sick
There is a cure
Inject the taste - the taste of you

Let me home
Between your legs
Where I belong
Where I provide
No more rejection
Never alone
I miss the taste - the taste of you
