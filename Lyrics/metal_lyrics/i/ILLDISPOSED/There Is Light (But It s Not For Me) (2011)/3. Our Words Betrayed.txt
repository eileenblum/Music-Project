You call my name
It sounds like Summer
My feelings are uptight
But they'll survive

We speak again
Not with each other
Though I must admit
We shared good times

Good, times, Rome were built
Words, thrown, fall betrayed
Our, faith, just collided
We, feel, so alone

Our words betrayed
A constant nightmare
All feeling are exposed
We stay alive

I need your help
Confirm you're frightened
Bring down the barrier
Of broken dreams
