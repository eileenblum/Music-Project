Music never stopped knowing the way
If lies are planted we weed it out in the
Music all we had - all we feared
Cigarettes are burning, at night we look so pale

So pale as we inhale
We care not, better look away
This represents all that you hate

We - it won't be long
This is all we lust
The circle starts and ends with us
We - we sacrifice
All of your normal lives
In the need to be together - We

Hateful, control undeniable
We reap the fruit of what we saw, it's coming back
Hateful in silence spoken the words
Meant to hurt - and do nothing else

To plant the seed of disbelief
To implode
Where feelings rule - where we take over
