In control I never was
That would take another year - with you
But I don't have any more time
I'm on my way out your door - it'll never last

And I'm going down
Don't care at all
I see you burn in hell
Burn - I'll see you burn

It's like a fantasy outlived
Burn your way alone
Your own best companion
It's all you where

Take care
Take care and burn

To smart to notice anyone else
Involved in nothing but yourself
And yet again so short on knowledge
Guess your brain went away with apathy

Burn Burn Burn Burn

And I'm going down
Don't care at all
I see you burn in hell
Burn - I see you burn burn
