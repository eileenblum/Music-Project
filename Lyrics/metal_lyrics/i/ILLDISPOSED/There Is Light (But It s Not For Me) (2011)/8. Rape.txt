When a girl who never lies
Start spilling from her eyes
You better listen in respect
Could be the worst one yet
And this girl who've never done
Other people any wrong
Are led to her defeat
Revenge what he did

From what she said, and all you know,
don't turn the cheek
He can't escape - revenge, revenge
Is all you can bring, - is all you can

You need to take a life
When no means no
And the barrier broken
Your time to heal
All the pain - don't throw it away
And the pig will scream
Carry out the plan

You shouldn't go
Where has been denied
And the barrier broken
The time will tell
Do I let you live
Prepare to be - Castrated
