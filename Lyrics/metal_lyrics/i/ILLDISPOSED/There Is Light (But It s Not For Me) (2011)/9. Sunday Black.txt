15 years ago I saw it coming
The end of things that were - what are we coming to?
I saw the evil, lurking in the shadows
Protecting me so violently - killing on a Sunday

And in this place of mine, you're coming through
Laughing, teasing, spitting, biting - all for you
To sail away in darkness, is what we do
Never cared what others said - killing on a Sunday

And when we laugh - we laugh at you
Our minds are black - shining through
Always together
Now and forever

You'll never sail this boat of evil will
Twisting, turning, slave of me (I pay the bill)
And you depend on me - it's what you can
Of innocence and mockery

15 years ago I saw my love
The end of me, but hard to see - it wasn't all my fault
But here came evil - follow my path
Sleep with me endlessly
