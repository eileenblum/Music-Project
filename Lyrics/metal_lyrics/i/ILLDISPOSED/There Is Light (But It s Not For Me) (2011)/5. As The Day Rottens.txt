Feel me, flirting
Soulless, searching
In chaos, hatred
Drowning
Finding only God
And nothing remains
In my despicable life
As I reach for the cross
Carry my name

Satan, follow
Peaceful, hollow
Addiction, needy
Fortress
Housing only me

All my pitifulness

We are exposed
Another ingredient
Rotten my day

Heal me, structure
Shameful, burning
Instructions, whisper
Seamen
Tearing up my flesh
Pouring all my will
Into your will
Now cease to exist
Rot and decay
