Teach me, plant the flowers
Embed the dream of you and I
Shower me for hours
My mind has so many things I wanna see
I can't deny my feelings - but I will deny the cross
My path of solitude
Are spoken by the few
Who'll never come to terms
With what happened here tonight

Heaven Forbid
Denial is decay
Suffer loneliness
Suffer, Souls, closer - to God
Flesh, burn, control - by God
And his flock
They can all rot

Feel me - break the chain
Important feelings  are dead
Then again, Heaven Forbid
