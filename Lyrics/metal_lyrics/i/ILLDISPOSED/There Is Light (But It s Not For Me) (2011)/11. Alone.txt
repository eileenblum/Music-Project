[Bonus Track]

Soon the sick part is here
The part where I must feel
Awakened by my thoughts
Of the impending end
Alone - I face the cross
I have no friends - not here

Carry on - you die alone

My desperation grows - It's showing
Ill tempered, Ill disposed - of the forgotten
Temptation has no fear
Decisions all come near

Carry on - all by yourself
