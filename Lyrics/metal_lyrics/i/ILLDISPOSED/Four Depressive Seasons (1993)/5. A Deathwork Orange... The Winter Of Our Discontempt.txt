Unborn children, follow me
Empty graveyards you will see
Tonight the world will be my castle
Eternal power obeys the only master
Breaks the sun against black skies
Spills the darkness in synthetic man's eyes
You are blinded by my pernicious work
You are blinded and you will never live to see
Me

I'm the goat
Injected to your veins, make your blood decay
Forever decay

Born of frustration with a puzzle in your head
He's your pet aversion, he's the only one you dread

My fear is of the winter that waits at journey's end
Who will walk upon my grave
When I'm a faceless shadow?
South is sorrow, so says my intuition
But I welcome the world I'll meet beyond

On the verge of tears you'll find me
Searching for truth ans innocence
Led by the cold winds of a child
Who's been denied
But still born in the year of One
The evil himself who no one betrays
At least you don't if you're a friend of mine

The paranoid disillusion catch my eyes
But "treason" and "god deception"
That's all just lies - they all just lie
