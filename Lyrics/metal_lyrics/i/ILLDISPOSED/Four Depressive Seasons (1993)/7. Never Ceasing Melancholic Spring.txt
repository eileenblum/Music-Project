He will lead you to the end
Like you lead a horse to water
I myself was gluttonous man
Disembodied by the Lord
Spring my life is led astray
Forced by melancholy and hate
I've got my soul misplaced
But I know who seals my fate

He tells me poetry
And lets me spread the omen

I am blind but yet alive
Slowly I'm reborn, servant of an instant call
Serving only for the Lord

Some say I'm vicious, but they don't know him at all
It's just an issuance of those who envy me
Take my hand and I will show you
Relations to weakness make you wanna cry

My addiction to nothingness I aggravate
The persecution of innocence is now at stake
A simulation of consciousness believes in me
Other species of a dying race are kneeling to pray
