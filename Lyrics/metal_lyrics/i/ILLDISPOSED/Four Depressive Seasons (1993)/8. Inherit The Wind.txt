You're obsessed with this breeze of mine
You'll sell your soul to the other side
Without asking the price

To share his inheritance
You gotta remember man proposes (God disposes)
What shall it profit a man
If he should gain the whole world
And lose his own soul?

Mortify the flesh
Sitting on those among you
Earn my confidence next
Show me that you're true

I'll take you to a state of sublimity
He who is not with you is against me
When you talk of angels
You will hear the flutter of their wings

Place the matter in the hands of Death's solicitor
Seek the heartstone of the land you wanna rule
