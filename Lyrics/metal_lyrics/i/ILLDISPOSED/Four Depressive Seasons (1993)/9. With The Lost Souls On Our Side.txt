From the unknown we've arrived
With the lost souls on our side
Wanna tell you about your lives
That we've conquered from behind
Join us if you like - down under

Have you ever danced with the shadows
Of your past life in the moonlight?

Depart this life, dawn is breaking
You're witless inside, but you'll learn

Don't mind my cadaverous face
I'm truly unlike the human race
The only one who speaks veracious
Is me, your eternal friend

Like a sacred prophecy
Or a tale you've heard

You're leaving upper monstrosity
Reveal your soul for the dead
