The autumn intimidates your soul

My soul has a file in Hell's computer
Tapped by another twisted black creation
I know because I've seen the third dimension
I have seen what this autumn will bring us

Why, hear my scream as I fade away
The fertile race is so ashamed of me
Of course I know there is a morbid sorrow
Deep below
As if I could disencumber mortal man
From his own deeds

Man lives only for one thing:

DESIRE

Unwrapping carefully
A truth that no one greets
Faithful are the ones
Who are accepting their defeat

Noxious penetrations of my godforsaken body
The autumn of my life just never seems to end
Confiscated lustfulness, I'm living by my sins
God of mine, where are you now?
I want to step behind

I pray

Like predeterminated My autumn turns to discontempt
Often devastated is the life
I live in scorn
It's hard to feel anything at all
The possession of my haunted soul
Tugs at my heart strings
