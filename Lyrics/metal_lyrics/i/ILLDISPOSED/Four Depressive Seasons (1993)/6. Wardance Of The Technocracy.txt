In times of great depression
Leaders are chosen in panic
But why one without emotions?

Machine has taken over man
Technicians rule our land
Together we must stay against the wardance

Keep your faith within your mind
The safest place it can be
Betrayal in shape of your family
You see it every day
We must create democracy
Destroy the machines!
