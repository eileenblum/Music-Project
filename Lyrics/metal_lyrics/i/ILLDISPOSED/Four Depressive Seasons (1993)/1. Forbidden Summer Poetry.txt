A change of seasons is upon the lands
Though summer warmth is lingering
My heart is cold, my soul has died

In this psychotic maze dies my wishsong
And heaven's well has just dried out
Forbidden poetry

Led to depressions by winds
Blowing summer into fall
Those who whispered once tenderly
Now deceive me with their calls

Silence

The leaves of life begin to turn
Despite I'm young I want to leave the earth
Being nothing but a home
For the mentally defective
