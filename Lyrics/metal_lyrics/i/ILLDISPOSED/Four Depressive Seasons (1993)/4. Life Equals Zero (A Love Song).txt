Together now we celebrate
The nights when we're alone
We pray for the world to go away
That world which was grown into tormention and hate
Life equals power in shaking old hands
Patting their baby, the atomic power plant
As we stand by and watch this cretinism
I reach for my gun and scream at the system
"Come on, I can take you all tonight!"
And growl like an ancient hero
"Life equals zero!"

Their lies, the future, it's all an occasion to die
But when you look into my pale blue eyes
I'm looking at paradise

All my thoughts
Breath in me
Control my life
And set me free
