He drained the life of my haunted soul
Pretended to be my friend
Acted like my brother
Who currently lives in Hell

Sacrificed I am by the devil who I once believed
Hail Satan, praise the lord and be deceived

Strength in moral man lays in the part of denial
Feeds throughout the lands, misled by evil hands

"Lost sons, follow me on the final ride!"

What a rush, I feel like I'm a born again Christian
"So you are my friend with the Cross reversed...

...But so what, you look like a million laughs!"
