[originally by Paradise Lost]In agony we are now
Twisted unblessed we must strive...
Repulsed by the false harmony
Blinded by truth that eyes can't hope to see

Foolish man must die
For the sins that he creates
Forgive lord - we must be weak

Remove the weight of sin
Release harmony
Resist the throes of his embrace
Ignorant laws thrust in our face
