[originally by Venom]By the shores of the ageing sea
Fools scream out destiny
They speak of vengeance and your gods
into the fire - out of the flame
The beast awakes - thousands are slayen
The mystic reads - forgotten tales
All hallows hail - your falling waves

Nightmare - this is your prize eternal
Nightmare - make no disguise infernal
Nightmare - you'll realize you lost in
Nightmare - Nightmare

Inside explodes - the butcher strikes
You'd love to die - your baby cries
Lead candles burn - just a decoy
The giant child - your his new toy

In the eye of the lions teeth
Your flesh becomes his meat
You lie devoured still full of life
Temples of ice - white desert breeze
The golden sun - prepares to freeze
Dying of thirst - drowing in pain
You wake in sleep - it starts again
