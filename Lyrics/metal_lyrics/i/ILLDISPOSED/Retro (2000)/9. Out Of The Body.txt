[originally by Pestilence]In the darkness
They crawl on places
Where you can`t see or hear they come
Marching silently
When it`s dawn they will be gone

A swelling on my body
Makes me suffer, live in anxiety
No time to waste
Just open the abcess, will you please help me
The ignorance is dominating
Remedies you try
I can not live this life any longer
What is it and why?

While you`re asleep
They`ll enter your skin
The search for the new place they will dwell
They give their children
A place to be born
You won`t notice except for the smell

Mysteriousness, researches can`t explain
The sorrow of this eternal pain
It`s burning stronger day by day
Cure me, thre must be a way

Desperation, confused mind
Never heard of the disease of this kind
So tell me what can I do
To leave this HELL I`m going through

Human blood
The perfect place
Birth of descendants
Creatures living
In my veins the horror
Frightening, sickening
The pain that I am bearing
Begging, please get them
Out of my body
