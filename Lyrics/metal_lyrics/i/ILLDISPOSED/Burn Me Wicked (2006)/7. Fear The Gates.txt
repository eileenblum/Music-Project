I tortured
Another buck
I threw it in
The machine, but it won't pay me back

I laugh at you and what you feel
You knocked me over, kept it real
My love for you has more than died
I hate you now, I curse your eyes

And in our darkness
You still see some good in me
The way we went
Down
Doesn't work that well, you see??

I pity you and all your hopes
Just lift your eyes, see me go
Love does come in many shades
But ours are gone... I hate you

I'll wait till you will awake
I'll be your guide into hate
And as if dawns you will never see
Me or mine ever again
All my thoughts were of us
But now that's way back in hell

Take the bus
But make sure enough
That I'm not riding there
And by the way
Yeah my phone is dead
Do you think about why??

I'm so way over you
