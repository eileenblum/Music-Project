Always placed you on the side
I don't care what other people say
This gives me higher meaning
Better learn or just give in

Go on now, hold your head
Higher than any man
Feel the flow, get with it
Take what you never had
Feed the hole, never choke
Even I don't look back
Read the mind, don't get mad
Have no fear, don't despair

Always kept you in my mind
To let go I never really dared
I have to touch the ceiling
I have to say I'm there

Be one thing, never pass
Sure you'll see, all what's free
With this hand I thee wed
Tie the string without ring
Force me to, make me mad
Obey me, I'm your dad
Braver girl never seen
Cutest thing answer me

Your innocent eyes
Always looked tormented
Within my lies
I hope you also felt a little

Love, the servants rest
As we put on the final
No need for this test
I am sick - Honey, I know

Give me strength to face each day
Hand me laws I must follow
Throat drying, we sense the fear
Resting your hand upon my head
Razorblade on the wrist
Fade away, cease exist
Tell me words, that I'm missed
Painful day, goes away
Touch my face, feel with me
Think of me, we should be
My last thing, walk with me
Taste my blood, unity
