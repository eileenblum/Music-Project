Written in Como - Italy March 2005]

Hey

I felt I really touched you
And in ways also new to me

I sang a full house back then

You can tell your brothers

And you can say your daddy was a fool
But he never ever left your side
There's nothing I won't do for you
Just for you I'll stop - you have my blood

I need some time with my sons
You're all growing so tall
And when this touring is over
Daddy's coming home

And you can tell your brothers it's for good
As I am never ever going back
There's nothing worse than living in this shit
I really hate the aspects of being on tour
