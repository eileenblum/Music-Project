Lately I've been in the mind of all
Who fought a little battle
The pill I am of all drugs
I only wanna help and I say

Feel me easy
Life is hell
Teach you to see
There is no sin

Once you've popped you wont return
A few of us and life's all good
Split decisions are of old
And so are you, but I'm not counting

Hate me, easy
Life is hell
Learning to see
Can no longer feel

Feel

Electric frames are burning fast
But have no fear it's all joy
Dissecting like a laser tip
I only wanna see you in hell

You felt me, easy
Life is played
Lesson, deadly
Fear runs free
