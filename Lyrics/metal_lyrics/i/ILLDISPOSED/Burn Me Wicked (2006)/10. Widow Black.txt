Another child
Fell to earth from guilt and lies
Didn't have no sense in life
His time is wasted

In came the widow black
It was a foul attack
A letter written as goodbye
It's all a lie

Courtney
You killed Kurt
You will go down - be punished
I'm the drugs you're abusing

Courtney
You fuckin' cunt
Yeah you broke up the mentors
I'm the wrath of an army

You paid a man
Known as detective grant
Suspicions rose, but towards you
You're digging gold

The gear for horse was wrapped
3 times a deadly snap
The shotgun calling out a name
On who's to blame
