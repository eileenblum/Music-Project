Just once... never saw this clear before
You had your way with time and with a laughter for a smile
The things I could forgive, were passed by lightyears

You say there's no more love
And with a 666 I leave our home
Never promised never noticed
Never to be by myself... alone

Alone my heart is aching
Now it's worse + 7 more
Like sex without the lies
We're back and I am out the door

Just think... all that I would give to you
You filled my soul with rage, myself I will avenge
I came to destroy you... and I will

Do it - do it know
Play the game
You sure know how
