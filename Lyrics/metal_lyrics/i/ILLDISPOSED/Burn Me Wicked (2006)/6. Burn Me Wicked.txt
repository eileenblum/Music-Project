It's in your eyes
A painful scar is made
Even if we're over
One wish burn me wicked

And though I know we're better
I'm lost in the dream
The only girl - my friend
Smart, to visit my bed
If you die I'll never
It's funny how you believe

Burn me wicked
Help me see

And as the road slows down
Very deep in the night
To my room of darkness
This time - your might

Burn me wicked
Help me see

You turn your eyes
Cold as never seen
Now we are history
The dust in our souls

Your mind is my sanction
When you made it up
Beyond my own two needs
I can see you're smiling
My hand feeds myself
I cannot stand and watch

Burn me wicked
Help me see
