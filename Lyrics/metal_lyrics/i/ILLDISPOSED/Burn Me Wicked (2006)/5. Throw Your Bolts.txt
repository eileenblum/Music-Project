Nightmare, feeling the weight I'm a sinner - guilty
Power, power to stop me from trying - living

There is light but it's not for me
I am my own god

And I smell trouble
Twisting eternal I'm hurting - yearning
Evil, setting a pace for our future - certain

I came closer,
Touched with my fingers the madness - open
Flying, spreading my wings, let me go - simple
Forcing, enter the rest of my future - nothing
Anger, not to be caring for answers - ending

There is light but it's not for me
I am one with the dark

I'm no devil,
Inside my heart is obeying - beating
Playing, hitting the high of my body - helping
Talking, stripping the layer I'm nothing - pealing
Fever, enter the rest of my soul - over

Can't think of a way to stop
Please let me die
