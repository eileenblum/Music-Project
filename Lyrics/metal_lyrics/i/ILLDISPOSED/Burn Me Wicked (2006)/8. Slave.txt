Master and servant

We're cuffed and whipped
No stress or body armour
Anticipations high
This ain't a lie

The role as mortal slave
We see it every day
Could call it by name

There's a new game
We like to play you see
A game with added reality
You treat me like a dog
Get me down on my knees
We call it master and servant

Master and servant
Let's play

We hide in basements
We wonder why
As ever hidden
Painfulness

The talk of others
We never cared
Just get me started

It's a lot like life
This play between the sheets
With you on top and me underneath
Forget all about equality

Let's play master and servant

It's a lot like life
And that's what's appealing
If you despise that throwaway feeling
From disposable fun
Then this is the one

Domination's the name of the game
In bed or in life
They're both just the same
Except in one you're fulfilled
At the end of the day let's play

Let's play master and servant
Come on master and servant
