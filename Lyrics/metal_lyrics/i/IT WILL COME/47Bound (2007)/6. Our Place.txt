We'll go somewhere where I can breathe
We'll go somewhere to find our peace
You'll take me there and I will see
A place that is lost for you and me

A place in my head where we could go
A place in your dreams, that was my fear
Take me there, and let me sing
this song for you and for our dream

And let me leave, and leave me be
But come for me, take me away
This song is yours, if you will feel
This song is mine, a song for me

This is our song, for us tonight
Tears that are running down my cheeks
Proof of the love, I feel for you

Let me see, and let me feel
I'll let you in, inside of me
You'll know my thoughts and I'll know yours
We'll be as one, complete tonight
