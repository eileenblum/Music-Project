I am lost
I am lost within you
I can't breathe
I can't see you
Please, let me go now
Please let me know
The suffocation of your eyes
Kill me with your smile

I'm bound to you

Emptiness
Loneliness
Satisfaction
Feelings of aggression
Sadness taking hold of me,
breathing down my neck
Feeling in my gut
Left behind
Hate

I'm bound to you

Melt my heart
Let me wake up in you
Tearfilled eyes
Show me mercy tonight
To the woods,
to the trees I will go
Reclaim my love
Deserve my heart
It will come for me
