Darkpath walker shrouded in the mist
Red eyes burning, blazing the night
Hellborn, devilspawn, bringer of the hate
Representing Hell on Earth, collecting the souls

[Chorus:]
Burning, Raging, Killing
The Dark One is coming

Heavens are screaming, crying out in pain
Terror's coming, evil is its name
Land is schorched, cities dissapear
New order now is here, hail its name

[Chorus:]
Burning, Raging, Killing
The Dark One is coming

Chanting:
"Sing a song of death and fire, nothing to remain
Only a path of decay, mankind to face
A flame of his devours everything in path
To establish the kingdom of grief and hate".
