Alienated from this world
Disconnected from my mind
Comfort my decomposed soul
You almighty, mercyless God

Dehumanized in your highness
Projected into subreal
Embodyed through the weakness
Is this world what you call weal?

[Chorus:]
Structureless life's pieces
Tearing my inside
My blood burns your churches
Alienated from the fake God

Structureless life's pieces
I cannot remember the whole
My thoughts my only weapons
Alienated freedom calls
