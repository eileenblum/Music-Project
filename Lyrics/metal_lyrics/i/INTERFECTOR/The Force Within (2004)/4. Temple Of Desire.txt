Come to me, be my friend
Step into my world
Into my fears, world's misbelieves
I'll help you to understand
Inevitable nature of the place
Which passes before your eyes
Leads us to death, the only path
You'll never walk by

[Chorus:]
Sceneries from the past
Nights sang in blood
Pictures that will last
Only in the eyes of the dead

Let me be your guide
I will help you die
I lust for your eyes
Mirrors of past times
Now I see the sign
You are ready to die
Welcome to my
Temple of desire

And I die, and my soul is my cage
When I die my love will still rage
If I see your love on my way
I'll die happy and the smile will stay
ON MY FACE...
