Heaven it burns scattered are stars
And reign of lament in catharsis dies
Luminate the night for my fiend kind
Arcane worlds fall as I long for the dawn

Sadness and sorrow they grabbed my soul
In realms beyond I killed the love
The symphony of night, lurked me down
To doom of my kin, of divine light

Anger, hate, scorn and despair
Finally dark alliance is made
I raise the army, the kings are marching
I spit my wrath on the world of lies

Powers gather as I prepare for war
To purify the mankind, I'm macabre foe
Children of darkness, heed the black tide
The lands and stars, the dominion is mine

I've burned my wings
I despised the hope
Poisoned the essence
Of divinity that's gone
I brought the chaos
On this foged shores
Remember my sins
For I regret them not

[Chorus:]
The darkchoirs sing repention forbidden
The Lightbringer waves, I cross the diminished plains

There in the forest, there she stands and greets me
And there beneath her angelic wings white as snow
I've seen the path for cursed to walk
Forshadowed the events of nighttime to come

[Chorus:]
The darkchoirs sing repention forbidden
The Lightbringer waves, I cross the diminished plains...
