"Jedna kao srce sto u grudima bije
Jedna kao sunce sto sa istoka sija
Jedna kao krv sto u meni vrije
Jedna je sveta MAJKA SRBIJA! "

And as I walk this sacred ground
My heart it rings with joy inside
The dark mountains and ancient forests
And all the beauty that lies inside

Glorious land of blood and pain
We fought and died for your pride
Centuries of war, ashes, blood and steel
Forever your honour we'll defend

[Chorus:]
Oh Mother Serbia where are you now
Is this the faith of the empire so old?
Your western lands are beyond the reach
And the south is closing in

Oh Mother Serbia raise your head
Hear our cries is this the end?
For you we fight for you we die
Let two-headed eagle forever fly

Raise,
Raise,
Oh, MOTHER SERBIA!!!
