Been tricked too many times
to fall in the traps that have been laid down before my eyes
breaking out of the silence and this violence
which has been growing so strong for far too long, it will finally see the light

feel the temperature rising, a relenteless force of un-dismissible anger building up deep inside

been trapped too many times
to just lay flat down and die, what will be I won't go down without a fight
here and now, rest assured, that retribution is coming when the time is right

set the cleansing in motion. make them feel it in the purest form
make them suffer in truth and clear of sin
so ignite the fuse and lock on your targets
make them never forget
make them all suffer and let the killing spree begin

building up deep in soul and mind

they crossed the line and pushed their limits for the last time
I detest all the things they stand for. I swear I can't take it no more

I will not lay myself to rest until I had my vengeance
this hatred will die with you, buried in the same grave
I am not your slave and choose to go my own way

Your reign over me will finally come to a painful end

never, I will never, never again
I won't fall in the same trap ever again
never, not ever again
