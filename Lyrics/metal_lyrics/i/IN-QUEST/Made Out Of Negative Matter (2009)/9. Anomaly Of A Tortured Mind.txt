decline into the depths of my private hell
disembodied, from this empty shell

my private hell, I dwell in the darkness
into depths of insanity I fell
in this empty shell, there's no light

remove the patches casing my eyes because my hands are tied
wrapped in myself until I die. wondering through my mind
looking for points of recognition, but they all lead to the same gap
I am trapped

I dwell in the darkness, drifted away
I strayed too far from the path

stuck in a vicious circle, Can't seem to break these bounds
holding me back from moving forward, I won't reach the goals
inward frustration in a downward spiral of eternal failure

I 'm a failure

my mind is fractured, vague imagery faded away and I strayed
through polarized obscurity a fraction of chaos was captured

anomaly of a tortured mind

there's no return
I wil burn as I strayed too far from the beaten path

there is no escape, I've got nowhere to run
see the reflections of the flames in the mirror
as I watch myself burn

locked up in mental shackles, captivated in this tormented core
a body filled with emptiness, the hollow casing of my former self
locked up in my own mind, this negativity that grows over time
I'm suffocating on the bottom of my life, in chaos and in self-despise
