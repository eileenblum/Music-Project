comitting murders
imprinted on the memory in my divine insanity
committed murders
imprinted on the memory, lasting through infinity
asynchronous transmission has erupted

paint the picture carved upon the walls
it's the signature, a god's work of art
leave the message written in stains of blood
as I tried to clarify your death is my life

insanity reigns when this twisted mind, turns corrupted
asynchronous transmission has erupted

paint the picture carved into the flesh
in search for the next one, my victims in distress
sending signals, traces of evidence
as I bleach them out of my remembrance

my violence has amplified in the echoes in my mind
receiving flashbacks, of another life

it's not a perfect world out there, so many people corrupted, easy victims.
In my world there will be no more poverty, hunger greed or violence
I will create the perfect place for the human race

see the images fade away, into the shades of grey

paint the picture carved on their bones
their mutilated bodies covered up onder stones
left a message, my mark is hidden deep inside
what I left behind no one will ever find

insanity reigns when this twisted mind turns corrupted
asynchronous transmission has erupted
