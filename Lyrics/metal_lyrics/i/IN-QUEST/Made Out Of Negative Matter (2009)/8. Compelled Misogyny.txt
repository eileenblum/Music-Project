every day life of domestic disturbance
behind closed curtains a senseless violence
op en up the window of opportunities
and seize every chance you can to leave

just how many times have you wanted to die
in shame of the bruises and broken bones
you've tried to hide and swallow your pride
but you cannot mend this broken home

how many times are you going to try
before you're starting to realize
there's no hope and no escape
why do you forgive and forget
just to keep living a life of lies

the sickness is eating away, endlessly
compelled inot misogyny, no hope, no escape

you're not the one to take on the blame
covering your bruised face in shame
how much more are you willing to take
until you see you've put your life at stake
open up your blood shut eyes
will you finally come to realize

taught well by his father, showed lessons on the mother
on and on passed dow through the generations

can't you see? it's not too late to make your escape
how can you stand these mandatory nightly rapes?
imprisoned in this derogatory cell and a life of living hell
how much more can you endure, you're so insecure

the sickness driven to insanity, endlessly
the symptom is eating away. compelled into misogyny

it's not too late, you're not bound to this hateful fate
