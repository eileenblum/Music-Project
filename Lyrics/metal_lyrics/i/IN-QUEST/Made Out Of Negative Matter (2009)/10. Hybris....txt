I make my own castle
consider myself royalty
try to blow down my illusional fortress
but you will not succeed

they call me hybris
grand master in delusions of grandness
my beliefs are false but they suit me
in fact they border my territory
since the outside madness
I cannot understand, cannot take control

And I...

I hibernate in my own self
blowup my mind with my own identity
my walls are blank
and I write on them as I please

the hybris is just scared of what it will find
ath the end of the line
when the truth domes back and makes him small
it's his greatest fear of all
