I've been trying so hard to figure out
what do  I want to do
where do we need to go with this life?
it lies hidden within the rest of our given time

I hear the voice of reason breaking through the silence
fear the rational chimes of comprehension
As I'm starting to realize

I'm tearing down all the pre-assumptions
annalyzing all the facts of life
speculate in these misconceptions
of the predetermined abstracts of your mind

What will I find inside?

where will I find myself tomorrow
through all the death, decay and sorrow

breaking down all inner barriers
find a way through your mental cage
follow the path of self-improvement
end the slavery of this internal rage

there is nothing to fear, the nothing is here
will there be no more tomorrow?
If i could finally find myself

the whispering you hear says there's nothing to fear
then turn around to stare and the nothing is there

In a split second it could be all over 
we ask ourselves what will we be?
the schizophrenic secondary opinion within

no more tomorrow
through all the death, decay and sorrow
