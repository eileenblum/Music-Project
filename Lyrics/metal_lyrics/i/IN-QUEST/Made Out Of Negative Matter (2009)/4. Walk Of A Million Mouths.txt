they are spreading their infected words
all over this world and this sick distorted truth
has been following the walk of a million mouths

liars

tearing down the walls of frustrations
building up in soul and mind
I have to live through all the accusations and
I want what's real, for real, as I know it inside

I know it inside
I know you inside and out

tell the tale a fact or a fiction
won't matter for long, I will grow too strong
for this sick distorted truth
after following the walk of a million mouths

in know your outside
but I'll turn you inside and out

detecting the conspiracy
erase these intrigues and find a cure against your
contagious and deceptive disease

you are spreading your infected words all across my world
