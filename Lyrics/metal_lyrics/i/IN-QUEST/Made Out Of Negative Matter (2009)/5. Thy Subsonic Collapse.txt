I am the light, the beacon in darkness
your guidance in subsonic collapse

your world will crumble under my credence
bring down the fury upon the impious souls
to see the fear in your eyes before my presence
and cause that puny world to explode

I am the light, the beacon in darkness
your guidance through sub harmonic
I am the light, the beacon in darkness
your guidance in subsonic collapse

your faith will crumble under my pressure
break down the confidence in those who betray
can you give up all you've come to treasure
and see the ones you love pass away
along the way, they will pass away

I am divine, the perpetual light, through obscurity I will shine

no guilt, no remorse, I am the merciless
hiding, deep in a void of you sub consciousness
in the end you will face the consequences

I am the one and you take my name in vain for your gain

I will lead the way towardss the light
what you keep hidden inside, I will find
just open your mind as you die
I am divine
