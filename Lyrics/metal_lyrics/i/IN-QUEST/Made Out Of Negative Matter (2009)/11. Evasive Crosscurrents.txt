evasive, the currings collide, swept away in the tide
they drifted in apathy so far from the truth
they're pulled below the surface, sinking deeper, gasping for air
their lives are floating by, crushed by the waves of despair

here comes the flood that is drowning the shores deception

the tide is turning, relations have capsized
time to leave the leaking, sinking ships behind
floating back into their everlasting sea of lies and despise

I will rise as a tidal wave to erase all of your hopes
lost in the current of my furious path, you will feel my utter most wrath

irrotonal flows from all directions, navigate the seas of deceptions
the rumors are spreading wider and wider, who cast the first stone?
ripples keep spreading on the surface of truth

how many times in life will you get lost? with no bearings or no sense of direction
you will never be out of debt, never taken out of the sights, of my revengeful scope

washed away all of their filthy negativity 
caught in the crossing waves of the conspiracies
surrouned by divergency, set out on a deviant course from the start
the ripples that have torn us apart

drowning the banks of disarray, all of the trust I had has been betrayed
it's so hard to keep all the feelings at bay, going down the streams of destruction
and everything's swept away

erratic yet so systematic we are washed away by the floods
