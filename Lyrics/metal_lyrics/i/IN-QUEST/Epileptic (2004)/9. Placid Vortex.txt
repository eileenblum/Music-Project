To worlds colliding, transpiring exiting
No Words can fill the gap, that has been soiled
Your presence, omniferous, in its essence
No emotion can describe whats going on

I feel you, taste you, hate you
For what could be unlocked, a placid vortex
My beings numbed
I feel you, taste you, hate you... taste you...
My beings numbed

Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
I'm at the at the verge, of collapsing
I'm at the at the verge....

My Self destruction fading, My soul towards the end
a placid vortex, My beings numbed....

To worlds colliding, transpiring exiting
No Words can fill the gap, that has been soiled
Your presence, omniferous, in its essence
I can not have seen, whats going on

I feel you, taste you, hate you
For what could be unlocked, a placid vortex
My beings numbed...

Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
I'm at the at the verge, of collapsing
I'm at the at the verge

To worlds colliding, transpiring exiting
No Words can fill the gap, that has been soiled
Your presence, omniferous, in its essence
I can not have seen, what is going on

Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
I'm at the at the verge, of collapsing
I'm at the at the verge

I feel you, breath you, taste you
For what could not be unlocked, a placid vortex...
