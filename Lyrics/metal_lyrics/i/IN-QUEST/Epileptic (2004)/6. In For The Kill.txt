Ground troops are chasing the whites of your eyes
Close all the doors and take a word from the wise
Arm personnel and deploy in the sand
Drive like a knife through the heart of the land

The heart of the land
Where time stood still against our will
Won't get no rest until we're in for the kill
In for the kill

Bombs over head will make you fall to your knees
Warheads are launched with infectious disease
No place to run to and nowhere to hide
So why did you take us along for the ride?

Along for the ride
Where time stood still against our will
Won't get no rest until we're in for the kill
In for the kill
