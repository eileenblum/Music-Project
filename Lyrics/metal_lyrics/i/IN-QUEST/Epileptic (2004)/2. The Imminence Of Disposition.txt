Mental inflammation abbreviates my mind
Undergoing an aggressive synapsis,
Sensible apathic behaviour...
Starts to set in, tension is building inside...
A psychic paradox, a melting pot, of love and hate
Fuelled within

A misanthropic mind, altered - rearranged - programmed
Undefined is life and meaningless time goes by

Social barrier and morals slowly start to fade,
I'm now exploring new chasms and pathways
Leading to a blank canvas of emotions
Ready to be painted on my impure...
Soul is empty,
My vertebrae tribulates,
An irrational gaze, blanks, what wasn't meant to be
Wasn't meant to be...
Wasn't meant to be... me...

[Solo]

My soul is cleansing, filling up the blanks with hatred
My vertebrae tribulates, this gaze marks my stained destiny -

Social barrier and morals slowly start to fade,
I'm now exploring new chasms and pathways
Leading to a blank canvas of emotions
Ready to be painted on my impure soul

A misanthropic mind, altered - rearranged - programmed
Undefined is life and meaningless time goes by
