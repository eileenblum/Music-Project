The reign of fire, Earth scorched to bits
The sky bleeds napalm,
Mass graves, melted into this oven of bliss
A furnace of human garbage, as the Earth, your Earth, your Earth turns black...
The Earth turns black

Digging into the graves, survival of the sick
The Earth turns black

Enraged and encaged by this bio mechanical foe
The initial conflict seems so trivial, now
Out of hope, out of hand, population depletes
Enraged by numberous diseases
Is nuclear light the sun they see...

The extinction, the plague, of humanity...
The extinction, the plague, of humanity...
The extinction, the plague, is humanity

Another raid, again the Earth trembles,
The reign of fire has no end
Finding shelter beneath this crust of decay,
Forsaken by all hope
Infesting swarm of frail human beings,
Alternated, by their grief
Where is your God now,
As the sky, bleeds....

Reign of fire...
