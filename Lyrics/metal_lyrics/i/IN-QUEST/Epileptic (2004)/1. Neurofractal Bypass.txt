Impulsive feed, data rawly encrypted
On the neurological canvas of an altered man

Never have I doubted a second, nor will I ever
When I am close to pull the fucking trigger
New strength found in the indemnity I reap

Bypassing all, no encryption or infliction
Can cleanse my will to destroy all you stand for...

Always have they restrained, encaged, refrained
Productive minds from expanding horizons
Reshaping, the apathic world, you so desperately hold on to
Destroy the norm...

I cleanse my life and fill the desire...
Reprogram the globe, a social genocide
Neurotic views erased, making way for an euphoric demise..

re-program, bypassing all
Can cleanse my will to destroy all you stand for
Never have I doubted a second, nor will I ever
When I am close to pull the fucking trigger
New strength found in the indemnity I reap

Reprogram the globe, a social genocide
Neurotic views erased, making way for an euphoric demise

How does it feel, how does it read, onto your corrupted mainframe
To look to touch to hear to evolve, into a higher being
Bypass the norm, erase what you stand, for

Logic forsake me ... Replaced by ...
Reprogram the globe, a social genocide
Neurotic views erased, making way for an euphoric demise, demise

Neurofractal inpropagation
Global mental indoctrination
Crushing the potency of war
Take your drug your opium pill
And succumb to the true nature of man...
Will you come to me...

Neurofractal inpropagation
And succumb to the true nature of man...
Will you come to me

Never have I doubted a second, nor will I ever
When I am close to pull the fucking trigger
New strength found in the indemnity I reap
