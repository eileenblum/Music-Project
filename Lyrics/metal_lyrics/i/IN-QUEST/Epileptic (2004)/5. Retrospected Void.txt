My tribulation has passed and moved on
To a higher level of despair
Channel my hatred to overcome the depths
And destroy your way of life

Media abuses through excavated views,
Taking no lesson from what time has told them
There only seems to be a retrospective void

I'm a walking time bomb -

My tribulation has passed and moved on
To a higher level of despair
Channel my hatred to overcome the depths
And destroy your way of life

Media abuses through excavated views,
Taking no lesson from what time has told them
There only seems to be a retrospective void

Unparalleled equation of anger, manifested
Through the venom of my electric mind secretes
Unmatched furious psychologic endeavour
Forcing man to renew and explore the innerself

The more I see, through the eyes, of a dead, man
The more I hate, about what this, has become -
The more I see, through the eyes, of the living,
The less I care, about what this, will, be, come...
