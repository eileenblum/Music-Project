An artificial modified man, with only one thing in mind
The slaughter and total destruction of the human kind

Slaughtered by our own creation
Unstoppable chronic mutation
Inhuman lust for our flesh

Incorporation of external ideasâ¦
Forged, into their lifeless bodies. Our creation become our worst fears

[CHORUS]
Evil re-incarnatedâ¦ transformed, revived from human being
Evil re-incineratedâ¦ not being human anymore

Synthetic, zombiefied, with only one thing in mind
The slaughter and total destruction of the human kind

Failed creating of a new race, Resilient carnivore resistant to all
A Predator of our own decay, as they retaliate and bring us to humanityâs fall

Unstoppable chronic mutation
With inhuman lust for our flesh

Introjected malfunction, despite failure through injected thoughts

[CHORUS]
