Interact, never dared to turn our backs... 
To the face of the enemy, sucking up the energy.
The more you suffer, the more they bleed you dry....

Audio toxic disease

Conflicted binaries...
Unsolved quandaries...
What was good is slipping away
And this life will lead to total decay

In this industry of deception and deceit

I will not break, I will not break down
I will not bend, I will not bend down 
I will not stand, I will not stand down
I will not bend, I will not bend down to you...

Conflicted binaries...
Unsolved quandaries....

Venomous fork tongue
The serpents bite in your flesh...
Theyâre bleeding us dry...
Theyâre breeding us die...
