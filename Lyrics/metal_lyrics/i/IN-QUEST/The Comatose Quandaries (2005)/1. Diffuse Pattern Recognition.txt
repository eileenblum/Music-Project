First thereâs no one, then theyâre all selected. Without exception, no way to escape
Backstabbing, like two-faced bastards.

[PRE]
They will turn around and take another shape

[CHORUS]
Itâs a necessary evil so evil would not spread, itâs not humiliating, itâs not a threat
Itâs a necessary evil so evil would not spread, suffer the consequence and pay your debts
Pay your debtsâ¦

Only time, will tell, that life is a lesson to learn...
And, again thereâs no one, are they all infected? Without exception, no way to escape

[PRE]
[CHORUS]
Now youâre better off dead

Of course there are the necessary objections, coming from the usual side.
But there will always be those who want to oppose,
Because they have to and because they want to.
It lies within their genesâ¦

Donât exaggerate, let me choose my own way, just focus on their hate,
Donât manipulate, let me use my own pain, the fate is what you create.

Only time, will tell, that life is a lesson to learn and we learn from the pastâ¦

When your path is straight, donât matter, take them,
We donât care, itâs their choice, itâ their lair

[PRE]
[CHORUS]

When your path is straight, donât matter, take them,
We donât care, itâs their choice, itâ their lair.
