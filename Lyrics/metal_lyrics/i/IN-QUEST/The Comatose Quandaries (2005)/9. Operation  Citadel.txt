[Bonus Track]The cold December of 2043, war reformed on the eastern front
Rebuilding of the citadel, the citadel of steel and concrete, steel and concrete

1000 of androtrons, murdering conquerors
Came across the frozen steppe, didnât have no fear
Soldiers who did fight them werenât afraid no more
They didnât have no hope, they only tried to survive

[CHORUS]
Resilient they came with a power of a battering ram
Blindly driven against a wall of blistering snowstorms
Wondering if they did know what was going to happen
The surprise of the attack was all gone

Surrender impossible
The prestige of mankind

Watch them freezing

As they fought as heroes on those frozen fields
While the sky was rumbling the operation was doomed to fail

[CHORUS]

Surrender impossible
The prestige of mankind

Watch them dying

It was of no use, thereâs no escape
The battle was decided

Bomb pulse shatters all, turn the human race
Into biological waste
