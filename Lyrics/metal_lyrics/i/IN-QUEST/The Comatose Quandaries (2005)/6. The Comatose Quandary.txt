[feat. Michael Bogballe/Mnemic on guest vocals]Weâre Left behind
Wondering why, itâs all a tragedy
With this unbearable misery

The Comatose Quandaryâ¦

[CHORUS]
Unconsciousness in a profound state of mind
Through the emptiness in cold blank eyes
Deep asleep but still awake, without awareness
What was happening around you
Floating away to a better place
We could not see it in your face
Could you hear us when we spoke your name?
Before you faded awayâ¦

Weâre dead inside
Still wondering why, it was a tragedy
This unexplainable mystery

The Comatose Quandaryâ¦

No response
Can you see the light at the end of the tunnel?
Where are you now?
Passing though to the other side
No more pain

Persistent vegetative state of mind

[CHORUS]

The Comatose Quandaryâ¦

Traumatic subdural haemorrhage
Bleeding through, finally ending the pain.
(WHC) You will be missed!!
