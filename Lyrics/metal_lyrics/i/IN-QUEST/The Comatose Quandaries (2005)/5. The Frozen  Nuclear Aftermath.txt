[PRE]
The Blistering coldâ¦
The sky filled with darkness and darkness will forever endure

[CHORUS]
Everything is frozen in the nuclear aftermath
Eternal winter reigns this world, this world lies in coma
And the future is deadâ¦ Decimated, our future is deadâ¦

A landscape of blistering cold, where thereâll be no life anymore
The few survivors, hiding beneath the surface waiting
Taking shelter, close to the core where the earth is still warm

[PRE]
[CHORUS]

There is no hopeâ¦

The atomic holocaust has since long burnt to ashes
And crumbled to dust. The frozen soil of this earth is black as a tomb

Black as a tombâ¦

The Blistering cold
The sky filled with darkness, will this darkness forever endure?

Everything is frozen - in the nuclear aftermath
Eternal winter reigns, the world lies in coma
And the future is deadâ¦

Our future is dead...
