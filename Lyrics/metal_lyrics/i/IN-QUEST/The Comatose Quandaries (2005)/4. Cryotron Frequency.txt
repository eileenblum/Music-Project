Un-channeled anger, hiding within a sick and infected mind
Unpredictable, random acts of, senseless violence
Chaotic rage, taking revenge on the innocence

[PRE]
Shock in pulse, impact on the mind

[CHORUS]
A freQuency of hate
Hearing the voices scream inside our head
Giving us no rest until theyâre dead
A freQuency of hate
Transmitting signals of a self-destructive pattern

Virus spreading through the system, disconnected thoughts
Unpredictable random acts of senseless violence
Psychotic rage, taking revenge on the innocence

Kill the innocent
Now, kill the innocent

[PRE]
[CHORUS]
