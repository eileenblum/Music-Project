Manipulated genes, tampered from within
We wanted to create a stronger and better race, but we failed

Postsynaptic stress flash before my eyes
Purified, our bodies will not thrive

[PRE]
The structure of our mind astray
Realityâs a plague, just waiting to be wiped away

[CHORUS]
Coldâ¦
We will self-destruct and bring our own demise
Planting neural seeds of mass destruction. Genocide of our mind

Shaking uncontrollable, nerve damaged
Insanity starts to take hold, I Question what is real

[PRE]
[CHORUS]

A cancer, a genetic flaw, within the systemâ¦

The structure, of our mind astray
Humanityâs a plague, just waiting to be wiped away

Coldâ¦
We will self-destruct and bring our own demise
Planting neural seeds of mass destruction. Genocide of mankind
