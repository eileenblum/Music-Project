Honey honey, give me head and letâs and letâs waste some time
Letâs find out where we stand cause I love you so
Honey honey, youâre on the way to be wet
I want to play with you, you are so beautiful,
You have this sensual urge

Lustful, innocent

Erotic lust is what we need, fun and games seem to worn you out
I see you in my eyes, I see you lascivious
Letâs pretend we know each other for a while
I see you in my mind, I see you naked

Deep inside you
Pleasure-loving orgasm
Swirling in wet tornado

Fervent thighs
Every morning, real lewd trip, calling the reaper

Working our bodies swirling, sweat on your sheets,
Gushing my cream with a hot flash of animal lust

Youâre pristine, be my bride, I want you by my side
Stroking your flesh, love is immortal

Honey honey, give me head until my love is red
Just want to lay down and drive you here

Lustful, innocent

Something did happen which never happened
I fell in love, more than desire

Sexual obsession
Sexual obsession, mental agression

I take you from behind, licking your wet lips,
You eat my swollen balls, I massage your softly breasts,
Pulling the nipples, Iâm cumming on your back
Sexual obsession?

Sexual obsession, manic depression
Sexual obsession, mental agression

Every morning, I hear your gentle voice
Whisper sweet nothings, your flamingo pose

The smile on your face, speaks a profound inner peace
