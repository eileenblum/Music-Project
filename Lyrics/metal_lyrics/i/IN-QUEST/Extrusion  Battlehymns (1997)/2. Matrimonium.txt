Walking through this torment
My eyes look out for victims
I think about this independent truth
Horrifying members
With eyes who are so empty
I think about those everlasting days
Watching every movement
The enemy we conquer
I think about those empty nameless graves
Promises, of freedom
I think about this independent truth

Stone-cold reasons of innocent, please return them to me
Cuntdeliverer, a narrow mind, please remind him to stay

Walking through this torment,
My eyes look out for justice

I think about this independent truth
Taking wrong decisions,
Dumped down in rawness
I think about the horrors of the night

Matrimonium, keeping up the strength
Matrimonium, send it into darkness without light
Reaping the desires of life
Burning fire
Drowning in decisions
Keeper of the dreams

Watching every movement, the enemy we conquer
I think about this independent truth

Promises, of freedom, the darkness we deny

These nameless who canât die in the name of hope and justice

Is it right for us for this deny
The horrible company of death, his smile is filled with laughter
Letâs go hunting after...

..And walking through this torment
My eyes look out for victims
Canât think about this independent truth
Slaughtered the wounded
And kill their lovely honey
I think about those sunny happy days
Promises, of freedom
And finally go happily insane

Matrimonium, keeping up the strength
Matrimonium, send it into darkness without light
Reaping the desires of life
Burning fire
Drowning in decisions
Keeper of the dreams

Out of the intemperance washes the herb of error
And the harvest only exist of tears
And the story we tell is the one of pain and disaster
So impossible to believe in soon itâs over and then we laugh

Make my day, my bright cover sunshine,
Converse with all flowers every morning
Itâs impossible to love you, my darling
Searching for the truth and then we laugh

The arrival To breed Your doom

Cuntdeliverer, a narrow mind, please remind him to leave
Stone-cold reasons of innocent, please return them to me

Walking through this torment, my eyes look out for justice
I think about this independent truth

Taking wrong decisions,
Dumped down in rawness
I think about the horrors of the...
... Matrimonium, keeping up the strength
Matrimonium, send it into darkness without light
Reaping the desires of life
Burning fire
FIRE !
