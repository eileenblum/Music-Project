If your gods were like me
For reasons to fight this total war
Longing for a thousand years of perseverance
Drowning in madness

Fallacyâs with no sense at all
Burning it down

Raging torment
Surprised in their sleep
Loads of victims
Succumb to the superior forces
The usurper
A preponderance of virulency
Thereâs no purpose
Rising contempts for your own kind
Raging torment, is falling down on me
Loads of victims, maniac slaughtering

Infernal mights are coming for me
I see your eyes, infiltrate my sight
Feast on your running of the light, desires
Desires to me, reaching rising contempt

DIE

Taste your moments down, baby
To fear the light of the purpose in you
Too late to realize
The fools we are of your maniac system,
The light

Call it rejustice, the rising contempt of all your duty
To fear your justice, the running of me, to allow your system
Breathing your torture, my army fight until the end now
To meet your forces, my battle still rages

Behind the horizon, the other side of the sea
My planet rotates, a peaceful celestial body
Where peace depended on the uncertain balance of evil forces
Than the balance was disrupted by sheer force
When we count the dead
Itâs the end that we w ill fear
Clearing the path of evil,
Destroy and burn in paradise

Behind the horizon, the other side of the sea
My planet rotates, a peaceful celestial body

Call it rejustice, the rising contempt of all your duty
To fear your justice, the running of me, to allow your system
Breathing your torture, my army fight until the end now

I see your eyes, infiltrate my sight
To claim my knowledge, my self-confidence, my self-possession
I meet your mind, as it is uncertain
Feast on your running of the light, desires

Desires for me
Regain the mastery over oneself
