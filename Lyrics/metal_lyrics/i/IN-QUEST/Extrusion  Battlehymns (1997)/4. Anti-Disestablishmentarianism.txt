When we cross the border of madness
Then there shines a glimmer of truth

Thereâs that serpent with two faces
Shining through your shivering sported blood

We absorb the image of today
Of your glistering body-form

That is and will continue to be the life source
The morbid axis to our attention

Turning my back, future will come when we will die
Out of the body, an opinion never accepted
Burned in your flesh, even a fool can become disengaged

As the world turns in the wrong direction,
And weâre fighting against the stream
We sit at the gate and scratch the gaunt fruit
Of passion dies in the light

Turning my back
Haunted visions
Wandering of our believe
The entire spectre
Iâm proud to know your body, I hate the point of view
An ever floating move of the mind
Iâm paralysed
Rot away, you crusty clown

Welcome to this table, beloved unconscious
Raise the best of hair from the crooks
And struggling to summon on you one of the looks
Their arms look like snakes

Wipe-off all the bottles that weâve drunken
Like dark crystal-skittles about the cabin
And a morbid lump of love is a cleaver
And then we fly in his ideals

Turning my back, future will come when we will die
Out of the body, an opinion never accepted
Burned in your flesh, even a fool can become engaged

Get out of my mind, down on your knees

Flush my brain
Stripped of my wings, donât catch me
Empty my rein
Catch me

Drowning in clues, believe your lie
Canât look inside
Under the skin
Try, try to understand

Wipe-off all the bottles that weâve drunken
Like dark crystal-skittles about the cabin
The leaderâs free-hand is a cleaver
And a morbid lump of love in his ideals
And the mountains we will fly

Itâs just a fact of life,
Youâve got to accept the fact
That things going to stay the same
And youâre not the only one who will stay

Why canât your put as much power of your feelings
Into something useful to make an effort
To overcome and make a new life for yourself
Just because things arenât the same anymore

Turning my back, future will die
Out of the body, an opinion never accepted
Burned in your flesh, even a fool can become disengaged
Anti-disestablished
