Pride, my pride, Iâm your thought
Proud, pay debt in the name of sorrow

The light, it came, as itself

Blind, youâre blind,
Iâm your soul,
I soon will take your heart
Your heart

Sure Iâll take  your heart
Your heart

Christ denial, maturation
In my commune of the nowhere zone

Custody of your feelings,
Mesmerize your behaviour,
Here Iâll turn you into my hand
Without rejection,  REJECTION

You will become part of my hate yeah,
Crawl in the mud for my satisfaction,
Bunch of weak and lowly call my mighty name,
You ask me to send my unholy blessings

How do you measure the quality of your life in sin?
Place your trust in my feeling

Such sweet sadness

Our bouncing reborn nation,
You will give your life for
United by hatred
Another creature rules your life
The servants obedient
It is the force of hate


I want you to pray for me,
Get down on  your knees and pray for me,
Pray for the almighty, pray for me
Pray for the almighty

Your devotion, immortalize me

Christ denial,
Maturation in my commune

You will become part of my love yeah,
Crawl in the mud for my satisfaction

Mesmerize your behaviour,
Place your trust in my blessings

Our bouncing reborn nation,
Is this  your contribution?
New disciples will rise
I donât need you, bumbling moronic fools
