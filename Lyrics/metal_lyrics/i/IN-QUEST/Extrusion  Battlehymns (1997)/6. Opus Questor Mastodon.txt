Questor, and we all return
Physiologic inoffensive, thatâs when we all survive
And you can do whatever you want, youâre the master

I see your strength, to fulfil my life,
I see your mind, your never-ending power

I feel your power, I feel the strength
Without the very best to see like the beauty in you
I see your strength, your madness

Questor, you push me through the darkness
Precious rancidity, the secret that you keep,
The lies that you preach

Lies, which made you rising
Itâs freezing, freezing

Wandering of your power denying your own system
Drowning in restrictive chaos
I feel, I feel your never-ending power

And all the angels, they came down right
Down right on purpose
With fear in their eyes
And all the widows weep into their
Black dresses of everlasting hope
Floated away in the snow
And all the angels, they came down right
Down right on purpose
With fear in their eyes
And all the widows, weep into their
Black dresses of everlasting hope
Floated away in the dirt

And when we all return, terminal mendacity
Turn your back on me


Deep in my soul, my heart is bleeding
Itâs not the way itâs used to be
The power in me is floating away
My mind is tired and all I see
I see your strength and all your wisdom
I see your eyes

MASTODON

The rise and fall
Of your new empire,
A thousand years of eternal darkness
A thousand years to raise the world

Turn my life out and conceal it
Itâs the way to fix the might

Questor, and when we all return
Physiologic inoffensive, thatâs when we all survive

You can create whatever you want, itâs the best for you,
I see your strength to fulfil my life
I see your mind and my power soon will be rising

Itâs freezing, freezing

Wandering of your power, denying your own system
Drowning in restrictive chaos
I see, I see your never-ending power

At night, I see the end is coming near to fall away
From your hands, you did not see the...

...Questor, you push me through the darkness
I swear I will return one night, and youâll remember me
I put the beast in you again, and then they all return with me

Men from nowhere shall prevail
Hope and glory will rise
Done is the kissing, all that remains is...

... Your never-ending POWER !
