countless scattered thoughts
it is ordained, we suffer in vain
aligned throgh the unexplained
take drastic measures once you crossed that border
stay on track, contradiction, from chas to order
there's no turning back
it is a fact
there is no turning back
premeditated pulses, all connected through random points
constellations of calculated parallels
related polar rhytms delayed
a predermined paradox
associated in asymmetric faze
connect the dors
irrational strategy, undeviating gradual, definite radical
it is written in the stars, they are aligned tonight
binary angles defined, can you see the signs
predict the future and read between the lines
we shine - eternally
duality merged forever
prevail together as one
combined we will conquer all
I am enlightened, illumination lingers
undeviating gradual, a definite radical
accentuate pragatic schemes, an irrational strategy
because nothing is ever as good as it seems
equivalent duality
it is all out of your hands
leave it all up to chance
we are all just a part of the greater plan
learn to read between the lines
we are all just a part of the greater plan
stand apart from the greater plan
