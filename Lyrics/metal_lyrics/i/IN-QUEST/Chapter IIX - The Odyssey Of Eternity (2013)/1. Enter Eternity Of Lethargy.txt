enter eternal suffering
losing all hope and confidence
descending, is there no meaning?
what will the future bring?
the questions lingering and it makes no sense
in apathy, struggle endlessly
starting to lose control
exhaustion wearing down the soul
try to comprehend, the spirit needs healing
but when the wounds run deep
all these scars seem to be
down right impossible to mend
and these scars won't fade
forever lethargic
there's no end in sight once you started
forever lethargic
there's no turning back when you departed
incessantly empty inside
blunt carving cuts like a dull knife
endless excruciating pain
throbbing pulse
these headaches piercing through the brain
there's no point to carry on
we stand alone
another broken spirit crash to the ground
incessantly empty inside
blunt carving incision, cuts like a dull knife
