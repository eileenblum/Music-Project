tension rises, escalated conflict
reach critical mass of strain
cracks in the foundation, in vain
become one with none
perpare yourself for the donfaal
hypnotized in hollow hibernation
torpid dreas never ending
the shallow/fallen  fall into deep domatized sleep
forever descending
immense monotone frequency
resonates through the infinity
laid to rest, our thoughts laid to rest in hollow grounds
last time yuo broke the boundaries
it is over and done
patience gone, no more will you trample on our peaceful minds
draw the line
it is decided and defined
placed in decaying soil to rot
awake and smell what you shovel
pushed to the limits
enough of the constant insults
this is the drop, it has got to stop
finally it will come to an end
tension rises, escalated conflict
reach critical mass of strain
become one with none
in vain, prepare yourself for the downfall
so shut your eyes, forever be blind
never wake up from the hollow sunds
deny this souls existence in the universe
we're dispersed
lost in the spark, these eyes are the window to the soul
forgottenin oblivion
empty and lost in the dark
the light we blindly follow
infinite sleep for the hollow
placed in decaying soil to rot, awake and smell what you shovel
conflicting anomalies deteriorate
tranquilized, say your last goodbye
perpare yourself for the fall, when it all turns quiet
