I strive...
while my whole being is tired and torn with this existence
I am in the cornertrembling
taedium vitae, weariness and loathing of life
I am the one coping with all
no control over feelings
cascades of emotions overflow
stuck in the corner shivering
quivering in the corner, tired and torn
the wearing and loathing of life
now all these efforts are futile
anergia comes full circle, leave it hanging upon the outcome
worn out, worn down, burnt the candle from both ends
prepare yourself for the fall
stuck in a spiral down
repulsive enervation
idle bein in lassitude
it bears no significance
apathetic indolence
pushed to the limits of fatigue
blue skies turns into depressive blackened shades
it will everly rain upon the rest of our otherwise perfect days
it is haunting, forever daunting
asphyxiate this torment
eliminate all our hopes
continuous rigid coma
finally becomes us all
try to get by and succumb to failure
no matter how hard you try 
better let them sleeping dogs lie
I defy, I've become what I despise
enduring pain and suffer in vain
slowly burning up like a moth drawn into the flame
taedium viatae, accept you fate
