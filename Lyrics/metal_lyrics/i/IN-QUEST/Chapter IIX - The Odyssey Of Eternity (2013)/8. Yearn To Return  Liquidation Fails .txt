can never break our chosen path
ambiguous abstract and innovatively different
we are what we are and that is how it always will remain
it will stay that way until the end of our days
despite all the constant manipulation efforts
liquidation constantly fails, unchanged and strange in ways we will Always remain
elated we will stray
eccentric integrity sustained
no need for deviation, never turn away
exploration of a euphoric escapade
clear in sight lined up to the destinatin
no need to stray, the trail before you lies straight ahead
continuous frustrations
rise up to enless high expectations
elated we remain, eccentric integrity sustained
this odyssey has taught us
you don't Always get what's been earned
throughout these years, valuable lessons have been learned and
the prodigal sons return
rest assured wanted or not
the prodigal sons will return
the last verse is yet to come, it is not over, it has just begun
it will not be over until the fat lady sung
looking forward and the rest is yet to come
look forward and the best is yet to come
ong and dire road ahead
on an enless quest for integrity
we are Always ready
exploring newand unknown ground
bring it on, we are reay for more, we will return to even the score7
things will never culminate
persistence pays, as long as we are prepared to accept our coming fate
we sill reiterate
(continue forever)
