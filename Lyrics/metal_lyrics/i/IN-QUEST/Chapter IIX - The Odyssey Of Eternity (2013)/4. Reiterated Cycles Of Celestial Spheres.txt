clusters of translucent elements
build up massive complexity
epic random delay
emphasizing permanent verbosity
revered through sonar pulses
accentuated cosmic resonance
decipher cryptic pattering
looking for an answer
in this non-existing symmetry
the form is starting to take shape
a cericular body f enduring density
atmospheric repetition
equivocaing ringing sounds, elevated feedback mantra
sending radius echoes through time
add another piece to the puzzle
forced to fit in this intricate structure
mirrored visions reflecting the past
(repeated cycles of celestial spheres)
recycled present is how the future will last
loss of gravity
levitate into infinity
global opus obscure
our concepts are futile
ideas rejected and dispersed
uncompromising in our own limitless universe
eclipsed behind a supenova
