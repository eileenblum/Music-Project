a thousand questions strap a
leash around your neck
restricting your every move
assuring you no regrets

if I can't be me
release myself I would
choose not to be

im just dying to live
were all just dying to live
I see reason why

what do you think
dedication to the world that
they spoke wich took
all and never gave you
anything but

hope

you reject my hand think you
earned some pride
think you understand just
when time is right

passion supreme
as we collide the moment
you ever stop to ride
