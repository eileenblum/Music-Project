no time for taking shit
from anyone my day is now
tomorrows still to come

all I have all I trust
is right here right now

no matter how fucked up
things will ever get
there's always one fact
I shall not forget
this is my only chance

all that is real all that I
feel

right here right now
still can we share the gift
of life I won't resist
