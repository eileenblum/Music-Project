what you see is not me
see only what you
wanna see
what I like you despise just
like everything thats not
like you

king in a world of fools

I wonder whats behind that
shell you wear
not that I care it just
seems strange to
me that there's a
scared little fuck inside
the one who tries to
frighten me
you sicken me

and all this time you spent on
hurting me you've
only been killing yourself
for me thank you bitch

jokes on you nothing new
just you never noticed
did you

king in a world of fools
