in a one way make you're
running high blind never
stopped to reality wonder why
the key is yours in the palm of your
hand but where would you go
if you never understand

no one can tell
destiny forms itself with
or without your help
no one can know the pain in
your soul you choose to
live down that hole

weak in spirit waek in mind
in the maze you're running
scared forever blind
to all the things in life
you'd never find

I see myself in you frightened
by the view I can't save you
the demons got you

you choose to die down in that hole
