a parasite in my veins an
insect in a
storm your fall becomes my
gain

pathetic fuckin creep you
justify your own little
shattered self through
me

the way you play yourself
just like a fool the way
youd die for respect
when youre just a fool

your words are falling
like flies to shit man
and that is
why each mans hell
is in a different place
yours are
behind that ruined broken
face

I want to see you fall
apart your end shall be
my start
