rolling with the flow but I
don't know just where the fuck the heading to
no I seek no forgiveness the sins were on
my chest take all the blame myself

been led astray again
I thought I had a friend

alone I whisper the words
I never got to say
I know there's never
gonna be a way no things
aint always that they used to be
the tears of yesterday are filling me

life is a holiday cannot change
my ways this one way
trip to reality what I love
today I might hate the next
love those who deserve and
fuck the rest

no I wont ever let you keep me
down no longer
pushing me the fuck around
I wont let you lead
me all astray again
