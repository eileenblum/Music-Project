my existence the godless above
your twisted values I
breathe released from
the chains the indoctrine
of my brain

the seeds of man
misplaced its all inside
me spit forth this feeling
in me expelled from my
within the fields
you walk in you die in

weakened man cries out for god to help him
find his way, searching led astray
until his his dying day

living life on the esasy path
sucking air you never had
not meant to serve your
breed the wait for
heaven ill never need

the air we share has too many worlds
life hypnotized since birth

your existence the shackled
inside your hopeless world
you breathe never free from your
seliinflicted misery
