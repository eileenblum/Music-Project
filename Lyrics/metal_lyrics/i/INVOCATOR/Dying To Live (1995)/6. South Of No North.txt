know you would hate this if
you were here
told me about it while
you were here

all you had you gave while
you were here
id have a chance to repay
if you'd been here

just when you think
you're there the most you
find out then your
doors are closed

I could have been there I
could have been there I
could have died girl with you there

one thing that I learned
don't expect a thing so you
won't get burned
leaving something

loveed you in life
hate you in death the
south of no north you left
