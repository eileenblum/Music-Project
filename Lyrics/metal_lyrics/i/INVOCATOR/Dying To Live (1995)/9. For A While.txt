losing power hating
gaining power loving gaining
power loving
losing power hating

love is what makes us all
keep carrying on what
frees us from all our
sorrows later on it throws
everything back
to you and builds up your
hate for tomorrow

here today gone tomorrow

you heal the wounds I carrry
and make me feel alive
you help me find the spirit
for a while

you possess the power you
possess the power you possess

I find myself struggling for
confidence alone with
batterd feelings this
love was bound to turn to
hate seems our only defence

if you know how will you
show how to beeing you
would leave now if
you cared enough for me

lost your power lost it gave
it all away lost your power
lost it gave it all away

you can't balieve the words I
say somehow you heard it all
before you lost your faith
long time ago you don't
really care no more

I heal the wounds you carry
and make you feel alive I
help you find the spirit
for a while
