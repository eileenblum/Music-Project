manipulated history altered
values built
your tyranny nature waas
your biggest fear
not living ife while its
here

human instinct natures
guilt, 2000 years our
bloods been spilled

the resurrection ethernal life
pointless exsistence
your bible made life serve
the purpose
of living for no reason

I wonder how much. human
waste it took
and still will take before
you realize the deception
of the holy
book that love is real and
and god is telling lies

truth aint spoken
he went lost
the jews. themselves put
jesus on the cross

I give praise to life
itself and nothing else
all there is
