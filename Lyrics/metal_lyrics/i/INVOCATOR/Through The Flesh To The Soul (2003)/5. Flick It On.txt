The second before jumping
The final weight on the trigger
It's the imp of the perverse
The moment before leaving

I was on my way
All strings were gone
I saw you there... didn't speak
I saw you there

So come on
Flick it on, flick it off
The inner switch
The ill switch
The killswitch
Flick it on, flick it off

The rush in red
Pushing, deafening
Don't try to reach what you can't grab
Don't try to hold what you can't trap

Just before leaving you
A little before dying
I heard somebody silently laugh
Near the bed where I was lying

So come on...

Don't try to hold what you can't grab!

[solo]

So come on...
