So sad to be leaving
A bitter loss to stay
Your smile is so mysterious
As night at last eat this day

I heard it on the radio
And I heard it from your mouth
Through the walls you told me
That we were heading south

Getting nowhere fast
Escaping in high speed
Don't forget my love
Your demons to feed
I had it here
Until you came
The final structure
A broken frame

Though the flesh to the soul

Nobody else to blame
A cancer of the mind
If you promise to stay here
I'm happy to go blind
Cold - like silver pennies on the eyes

As I rise with the sun
I know I won't
Come home or down

Getting nowhere fast...
