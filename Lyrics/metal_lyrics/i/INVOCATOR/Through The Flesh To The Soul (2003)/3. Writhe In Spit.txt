Everywhere I see it
It's in every lost and dirty room
In every sparkling city
Beyond the lust and gloom

We all writhe in spit
To the sound of cracking whips
Like water to the thirsty
I lick the lies from your lips

I'll shine for you
I'll writhe for you
If you want me to
I'll die for you
As the sun sets
I know I'll be there somehow
Writhing in spit
Bleeding
Writhing in spit

Momentarily so delightful
With a scent of early fall
This self-induced slavery
Will mute your every call

We all writhe in spit
With the taste of sweet defeat
Like water to the thirsty
I lick the lies from your lips

I'll shine for you...

We all writhe in spit

[solo]

I'll shine for you...
