[solo]

I'm sorry for bringing you here
My voice just a futile sound
I'm the ceramic man
Who will love me when you're not around?
It's the fuel of the lonely hearts, and my stone cold hands

For days for hours, it's all right
It's under the skin, but it's all right
As long as I'm here
Who will love me when you're not around?
As long as I am here
Hard to come, hell to go

Under the skin it is - under the skin
It's under the sin - for you it's waiting

All made of clay, just try not to worry
Hollowed for the glory of today
If I don't make it back there...

Lift me up and take me home
Forgive me the things that I have done
I'm the ceramic man
Who will love me when you're not around?
Could not help it, I just want you

Under the skin it is - under the skin...

If I don't make it back there
I am sure you will understand

[solo]

Under the skin it is - under the skin...

All made of clay, just try not to worry
Hollowed for the glory of today
If I don't make it back there
I am sure you will understand
I did not mean to do it - you know its true!
