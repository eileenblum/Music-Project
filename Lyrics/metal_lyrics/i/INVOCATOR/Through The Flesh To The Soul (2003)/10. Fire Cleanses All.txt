Eyes wide open
Lost the smile that fits
Afraid to know the name
Of the emptiness behind the lids

With blood comes truth
I tell you fire cleanses all
How am I supposed to speak?
When I can't hear at all

Slippery
Are the rocks of perfection
And lonely the my hands
Shaking
Oh awake me from this trance

With blood comes truth...

I'm here
In panic
In pain
In command
Out inside in here

I'm here
Out of control
Out of body
Out of mind
Desperately in need for someone
Beyond the steel
Anxiously awaiting
Someone behind the wheel

With blood comes truth...
