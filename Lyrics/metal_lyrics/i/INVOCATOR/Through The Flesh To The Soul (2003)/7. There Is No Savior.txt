There is no saviour
Just the presence of your love
There is no saviour
Just a target for my grief

Miss you naked sleeping
Jesus be my man
I'll mirror in your eyes
Guess it's all I can

I'll cross deserts
To be with you
I'll climb mountains
To be with you

Wrote my name on the rocks
For you to see
What is your price?

There is no saviour
Just confinement within the words
There is no saviour
Just a target for my grief

I know you're out there somewhere
Want to be found
Can you see me out there?
Want to be found

I'll cross deserts...

[solo]

There is no saviour
Just the presence of your love
There is no saviour
Just a target for m y grief

Miss you naked sleeping...

I'll cross deserts...
