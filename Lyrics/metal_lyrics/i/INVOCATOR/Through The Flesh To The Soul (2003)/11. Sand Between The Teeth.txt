Turn out the lights, but slow
In ice-cold cars we're waiting still
Waiting for the flow
I do my best within the given time

Maybe I'll get there within the given time
Maybe I'll get there without the given time
I see you, king of dirty streets
I'll wait for you, king of dirty sheets
The first love that I ever met
You're the end
The gun to my head

Sticks like burning rubber
Smells like lust and fear
It's pure unspoiled power
A beloved but rusty spear

Maybe I'll get there within the given time...

Sunrise
I'll die in and outside here
Sunrise
Burn my skin my smile
I know you'll take me here

[solo]

Grinds like sand between the teeth
Like sand between the mind
You tried so hard, but got so slow
Long lost friend, you'll end up blind

Maybe I'll get there within the given time...
