...So short of hope...

falling through the mist,
my collision with the walls of eternity
in the mountain's hazy dephts, I slip onto thee

In the distance I wept, my presence discended
that night I lost something
inside I felt nothing

from my skull it rains in red
never knew what the signs said
burns into my hands and feet , the air
please God, let not my destiny be theirs

close my eyes again,
praying for this nightmare to end
only further I fall

this dormant suffering that could not be awakened
the pain they were to cause,
for they had been forsaken
and so their presence faded as I saw them fly away
somehow I wished that I was one of them

search my soul in distraction,
I can't help it I am drowning in myself
glide so easily between my eyes into my skull
I know now I shall be lost forever

...so short of hope and dying!
