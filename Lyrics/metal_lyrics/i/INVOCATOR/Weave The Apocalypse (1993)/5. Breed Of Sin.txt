The words you hear me speak,
in streams out from my eyes
the state of mind I seek,
in bitterness I reply

I've seen it all, the rotting face
of a world that once was
who am I to betray myself
when just to hope seems absurd

breed of sin, man's final creation
embrace the fact of the world's cremation

why pray for better days...
the peace they'll never raise

no wonder we've all gone insane
