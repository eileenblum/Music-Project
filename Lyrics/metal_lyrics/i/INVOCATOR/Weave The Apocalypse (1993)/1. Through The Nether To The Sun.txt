Inside these walls of sleep I rest
for ages now I must have failed my quest

perpetual roads I travelled
circulated in the sphere of evermore
too many sights I saw
the wasteland I inhaled of nevermore

in rain or fire I flew on through blackened skies
how could I stop this lonely journey now
it has only just begun
someday I know I'll meet, the company I seek
to join the last and only one
through the nether to the sun

something appears, my view is paralyzed
friend or foe I know I need them pacified
this obstacle before me I must pass
come too far now, I can't go back

the infirmity of it just make me laugh
so undisturbed I practiced my trespass

inside these walls of sleep
eternal isolation manifests
I fear the next trespass
and God my body screams for rest
