Soon the invocation calls,
The angels bring forth locust swarms
To a world in chaos, sent to terminate

Those who do not bear his sign
They will not be there
After apocalypse dai it's all too late

[Chorus]
Doomsday... I'll penetrate the war,
A penchant lurks in obscure
To save them from themselves
Will cause a greater fear
Yet known to the world,
They don't see their time is near
Spoken prophecy, repent; to the land beyond
We shall transhend
For the final gathering of the end

Yes take my hand, we'll all make it through
To the secret land
... To the desert...
