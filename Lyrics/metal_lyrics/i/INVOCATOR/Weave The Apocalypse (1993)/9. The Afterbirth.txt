Up from the ashes, nothing recognized
I stare at the remnants in this place
as I crawl the destined path in thick excrement
leave no possible trace

...but now it's my only way out of this....

soul drained of life, but with each step
a certain power is obtained within
not surprised I can't resist
the temptation of supremacy that lies in this

now I'm reaching my goal
my chance to leave this world

all set to leave this wasteland
that slowly seems so far away
lay my mind to rest inside these walls
that send me through eternal halls

...and i take a last look at my creation...
