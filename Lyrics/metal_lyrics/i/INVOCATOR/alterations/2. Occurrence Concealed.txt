Is poverty the plague of the new generation?
Economical corruption caused by leaders of oppression
Cheating you with words false and meaningless to them
Fascism and hate is the law they're living for!

Rottenness revealed in the higher men's places
Greed and corruption are shattering the weak
Giving all illusions to their own necessity
If you will survive you must fight on your own!

[Chorus:]
Putridity revealed - interminable destitution 
Occurrence concealed - solicitudes expiration
Putridity revealed - interminable destitution 
Occurrence concealed - solicitudes expiration

Ruling governments are taking every chance
To destroy, dispose and none will live it through
Shattered ideas, the population is betrayed
Deceived and displeased, criminal reinforcement!

Born to poverty, is this what you expect
From a government of brains to which we all pay?
All tyrannical leaders are chosen by their own
So you'll never live to see a life without greed!

[Chorus]

[Lead: Schultz, Hansen, Schultz, Hansen]

The conditions of life become difficult to see
Will this ever stop or is it just meant to be?
Raging and hating grow fast among the poor
Insurrection of hunger is now a waste of time

Unemployment rises 
in the lower social life
A scaring, dreadful subject 
which all are talking about
But who will have the strength 
and possess the guts it needs
To change this putrid plague 
and destroy it for lifetime

[Chorus]

Behind this painted surface the decay is clear to see
Destroying what they can, no nature left behind
Exploitation, greed, corruption, aren't them an end?
Defalcation, need, oppression, this will never change!

The militant development is wasting big amounts
And you know that your money has gone there too
Leave us in the dirt and take all our bucks
Buy more weapons, is this where it lacks?

[Chorus]
