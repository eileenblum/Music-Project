You've got this weird feeling of fear
That someone's watching you close
You must demean yourself to calm it
Down with some stuff of sickening chill

But an explicit, deceptive effect
Forces you to take more
It's the fictitious world you're dying in
So death is condign!

[Chorus:]
Please point out the way that's right
Please bring me a nice dream this night
One that can relief my questions
The one of life alterations!

It seems like I am the only one to care
But I'm not the one to blame
Are you just careless concerning your own health?
Or have you just lost your sense?

How can I hide that I'm so tired of
The carefree deaf humanity
When the punishment, decay and disease
Are beyond all your beliefs!

[Chorus]

[Lead: Schultz, Hansen, Schultz, Hansen]

Why do I have so many questions
And not one single answer to them?
I am so helpless alone here
And yet it's crowded up

Nobody to call my inner self
And make me wake up
I am dying slowly from deep within
Do you have a space for me?

[Chorus]

Why haven't anyone told me all
And everything about life?
Just about the womb from where I was born 
Is there anyone to blame?

Is heaven a place for those who prey
And not for some like me?
Why not entomb me in a hole
And I'll just rot in peace?

[Chorus]

[Lead: Schultz, Hansen]
