Oh theyâre coming for me
Theyâre trying to stop me
But I wonât give up
Oh these demons haunt me
Theyâre trying to stop me
But I will never give up
I was born with a positive mind to see
What the World had in store
The possibilities
But somewhere down the line
I lost my sense of pride
And negativity
Has taken over me
With every failure I face in my hopes and dreams
I try to stand up and fight
But every second I waste is another defeat
Itâs time to draw the line
I wonât lay down and die
Itâs time to come to life
I levitate to lift myself up off the ground
To find my higher purpose
But something always brings me down
(Donât give up, donât give in)
Never knowing where itâs from
These demons haunt me
But I will never give up
This isnât over yet
You always say it will be okay
Then why does it feel like the Worlds almost over?
Inside my chest
My hearts getting colder
Every time I start to feel
Myself slipping through the cracks
I somehow always find
Some hope
Maybe, maybe I can make it through this
My hearts still pounding in my chest
This is not your fault
Youâve been fed lies
At the end of the day you have to face the World and just dream
Go find your higher purpose
This isnât over yet
Your hearts still pounding in your chest
