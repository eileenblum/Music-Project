[feat. Jake Wolf]I am drowning
In the fear of existence
Detached from the surface
Of my whole being
Discomforting: The process of what I am thinking of
Again and again
I try new ways to find myself
But here I am
Iâm still lost in this empty darkness
Can you hear me as I scream for help?
Iâm sick and twisted and thereâs no way out
Step inside my memories and you will see why I am hurting
All these thoughts have me twisting and turning
As I learn what itâs like to breathe
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Suddenly I can see my whole life flash before my eyes
I can see my dreams coming true
I canât believe Iâve never felt this feeling before
When will these chains let me go?
Iâm tied down to the floor
In my dreams I can see an exit sign
Iâm never coming back again
This single thought has manifested into an obsession
I fall to the floor
This is my last confession
