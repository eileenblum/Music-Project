[feat. Blake Suddath]Oh shit this is an emergency
Is this happening?
I lost my grip, starting to slip
No
Oh shit the alarm is sounding off
Here we go again
Iâm about to self-destruct
Walking around with my head down lately
Because
Everybodyâs looking at me
Trying to keep my focus (itâs gone)
Why are they talking about me?
I need to run and get as far away from here as I can
Before I self-destruct
Anxiety
Has taken over me
How the Fuck does it feel just to breathe?
What the fuck does it mean to be free?
As long as I sit in the comfort of my own solitude
Away from everyone
Intrusive thoughts ruminating in my mind
Will fade away
When I close my eyes
Anxiety has taken over me
Itâs rising Iâm forgetting how to breathe
God help me Iâm going insane
(just breathe)
I lost my grip
I think Iâm losing it
Yesterday was dark
Today seems much worse
Brother my brother Iâve been there before
Iâm asking you this one thing
Just keep your head up
Yesterday was dark
And today seems much worse
Remember when the dawn breaks
Thereâs always tomorrow
Forget about the
Anxiety
Was taken over me
Now I know how it feels just to breathe
Now I know what it means to be free
