In the blink of an eye
As the stories told
I need to face the facts
That Iâm finding my faith in you
Another second chance
A time to save my self
Iâve been searching for too long
Iâm picking up the pieces
Take me North (i)
You canât stop us
Bring your armies
We wonât back down
Cause we will not stop fighting
Till we are dead
We are marching to the center
We will never surrender

(i - In Search Of Solace 2014; Northern Lights)
