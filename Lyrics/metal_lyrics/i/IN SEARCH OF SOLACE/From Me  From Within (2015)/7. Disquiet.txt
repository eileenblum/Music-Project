The World is so full
Of hurt and confusion
Have I made the right choices?
Are these thoughts just delusions?
In my heart I thought I knew
But every day I rethink things through
When will I know?
Am I supposed to be the man I am?
Or someone else according to a plan?
The hardest part is I will never know
This is the direction I chose to go
(There comes a time when one must look inward
And ask themselves who they truly are
Only then
Can you find solace)
I must make the most of all of this
Because I owe it to
The ones I love and miss
If I keep questioning my life
I will be a disappointment till the end of time
You said it would be okay (i)
Four years of living lost
Itâs so hard to believe
When everyday always feels the same (ii)
(Are these thoughts just delusions?)
In this dim lit place^ii
(I need to find the solution)
When will these chains let me go?
In my dreams I can see an exit sign
And Iâm never coming back again (iii)

(i - Humility
ii - Lost
iii - Fear)
