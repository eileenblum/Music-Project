This is the end of the beginning
An escape
From this misery
Itâs so hard trying to believe
When every day always feels so empty
I know there has to be a purpose to all of this
But without a sense of reality
Iâm questioning my own existence
Looking on the outside everything just seems so far away
Like the images scrolling on the paneled screen
I donât believe what my eyes see
This is my turning point
I decide my fate
I canât live in the comfort of something thatâs so full of regret
Four years of living lost
In this dim lit place
The center of my universe is this curse of my mind in space
I need to let go
This is the beginning of the end
