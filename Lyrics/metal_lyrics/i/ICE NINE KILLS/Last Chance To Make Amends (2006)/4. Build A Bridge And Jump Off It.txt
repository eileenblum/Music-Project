Lonely and restless on the coldest of nights
With these thoughts on my mind that keep pulling me down.
I'm only fooling everyone else
So that everyone else turns their back, turns their back on me.

So let go of these feelings that I'm keeping inside.
I'll hold on cause I'm feeling like I'm barely alive.
Lay back as this pain takes over me.
Broke down cause my head is spinning out of control.
Nineteen years and I got nothing to show.
We're only getting older now.

This pain seems forgotten
But inside I'm rotting, I'm rotting
Thinking of all this time 
left to waste, then die.
The only thing I know for sure
Is I don't care anymore.

And when I'm gone
Well, I hope you have the strength to move on.
Angry, but I'm told to not complain.
Reckless, but I'm better off this way.
This is not what I want, but I'll just bite my tongue.
Now I'm hungry (hungry) but I'm too tired to eat. 
Tired (tired) but I'm too hungry to sleep.
We're only getting older now.

This pain seems forgotten
But inside I'm rotting, I'm rotting
Thinking of all this time 
left to waste, then die.
The only thing I know for sure
Is I don't care anymore.

And it hurts
Save me cause I'm drowning
Give me more time like it
People keep on counting
It feels like I'm blinded now
As they shut me out
But I'm trying to see
Please make this stop

This pain seems forgotten
But inside I'm rotting, I'm rotting
Thinking of all this time 
left to waste, then die.
I'm not going to know what I'm doing here
So why can't you give me a sign?
So hold your breath now, swimming in an ocean of fear
My last regret is never knowing why I'm here.
