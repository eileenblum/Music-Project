Please take me back to the way things were before 
I swear to God were causing 
permanent damage or more 
as I try to fight these urges inside 
(we keep drinking until we can't recall) 
But I can't stop 
(your so sexy when you're out of control) 
Cause I want you 
(so give up and give in cause I know you want me 
to take your breath away) 
Lets get drunk and disguise 
our wasted miserable lives 
made better from lack of trust 
and excess lust combined 
when were together 
Cause I burn every bridge I cross 
and I'd feel better 
jumping off 
when you don't see the signs, that theres 
no chance that 
we can survive 
This was over before it began, I can't 
live like this when 
you don't understand 
that you're the queen of lust and 
I stormed the castle but 
it was empty and cold 
and its decaying like our insides 
I hope we fall asleep 
for the last time tonight 
I like you more when you're laid on the floor 
passed out when I'm not 
theres not a single good thought in my body 
Have you ever been lonely enough to 
think that this wasn't 
only just luck 
and won't we feel better when we 
soak our skulls with 
alcohol to forget about this night
