We started off by talking
About the tattoos on her back
And the bands that we both hate
And anything to make the moment last
Hoping you might spend a night
To watch our feelings collide
Seems like summer's just a state of mind

I'm gonna make sure we never fall apart
We're not trying hard enough
So this can last forever
Do you remember...

Crashing parties just to get our drinks for free
You would touch your skirt and tell me you had nothing on underneath
But all these memories
Are burning me alive
Knowing, you and I might never get this right
(but we're gonna have to try)
And if this promise was a fading dream
I'd suffocate myself to sleep
For one more night of silence next to... you

I'm gonna make sure we never fall apart
You're not trying hard enough
So this can't last forever
I'll give my best shot holding onto what we've got
I need to tell her that I'm ready
Whether she's ready or not
Are you ready or not 
(or not)
Well are you ready or not?
(Well are you ready or not, I'm ready, I'm ready)

We tried, so hard that all the walls we built up...
We're fake, 'cause your slipping away
Like a car on ice, we're spinning out of control
Like an open wound, we need some time to heal
Like a cigarette, her pleasure's worth the risk
Like a crowded room, my presence won't be missed
She don't care, and it's not fair
That I can't forget you
Just knowing I've met you
You're out of my life, but I'm moving on
Well, she's moving on
Soon I'll be gone, I'll be a million miles away
I need to see you, need to touch you
Like we used to misbehave
If your picture's worth a thousand words
I'll cut open my vocal chords
One more night of silence next to you
Just to spend another night with you

[Girl speaking]
We say all these words, we make all these promises
But I need to know, can we really make this last?... forever?

I'm gonna make sure we never fall apart
You're not trying hard enough
So this can't last forever
I'll give my best shot holding onto what we've got
I need to tell her that I'm ready
Whether she's ready or not
(Well are you ready or not?)
