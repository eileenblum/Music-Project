Please don't forget to fall asleep tonight. 
So I can make a tomb of your bed. 
I know I've run out of good intentions 
(THIS IS YOUR FAULT!) 
So I'll have to use the bad one's instead. 

I've got a motive, and an alibi. 
This isn't over, until you tell me why you didn't trust me. 
So show some respect. 
Cause breaking your promise is easy as breaking your neck. 

Next time we meet, I'm taking what you took from me. 
I'll take it because enough is enough. 
And your time is up. 

Please don't forget to fall asleep tonight. 
So I can make a tomb of your bed. 
I know I've run out of good intentions 
(THIS IS YOUR FAULT!) 
So I'll have to use the bad one's instead. 

Well at first glance, well you two look like perfect friends. 
I guess I didn't understand what friends do. 
But I do. 

So here's your last chance, for you and me to make amends. 
Why don't you come clean (COME CLEAN) And tell me the truth? 
(Tell me the truth. TELL ME THE TRUTH!) 
I'm coming for you... 

Please don't forget to fall asleep tonight. 
So I can make a tomb of your bed. 
I know I've run out of good intentions 
(THIS IS YOUR FAULT!) 
So I'll have to use the bad one's instead. 

(Alright. This is what you want. This is what you get. 
This is what you're getting now. You were mine) 

I hope he leaves you stranded on the side of the road. 
Feeling used and alone, and never knowing how much more you can take. 
So you sleep with the first guy you meet. 
Who agrees just to boost your esteem. 

But the condom breaks... 

And nine months later you're alone in your bed. 
With a kid of your own, and a gun to your head. 
Thinking I shouldn't have left him. I regret what I said. 
You can pretend that you're sorry, 
but you're better off pretending you're dead 

Please don't forget to fall asleep tonight. 
So I can make a tomb of your bed. 
I know I've run out of good intentions 
(THIS IS YOUR FAULT!) 
So I'll have to use the bad one's instead. 

You brought this on yourself. 
Last chance to make amends...
