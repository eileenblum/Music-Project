Waking up right next to you 
Is the last thing that I want to do 
Knowing you don't care 
Cause you're spineless and too much to take 
And my kindness was a big mistake 
It gets me nowhere 
And Ive been reading through your letters 
Hoping that you'd never make up your mind 
And I wish I was a boy again 
Where I could still pretend you were mine 

I'm drinking too much these days it never seems to help 
Cause you say Ill never change 
And that I'm the only one who I care about when you say 

That you're leaving and you're ready to go 
Cause you thought I was cheating 
But I don't think you want to know 
Well I think that things are better this way 
When it seems like you're breathing 
But you're already dead to me 

Making up my mind on you 
Is something I wish I could do 
But you're so damn thoughtless and I'm not going to lose 
To any of these games you play 
Cause no one likes you anyway 
You're just a faceless name 
So what will you say 
When I tell you that your life's like a book 
Its torn and tattered sitting on a shelf 
Where no one wants to look 

And it seems 
That this is what we want 
As your face begins to haunt my memories 
And seep into my future dreams 
Where no one can hear you scream
