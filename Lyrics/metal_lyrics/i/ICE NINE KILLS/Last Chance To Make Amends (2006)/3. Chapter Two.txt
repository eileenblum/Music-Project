Regret 
Every grateful word 
From every song you've heard for 
you misunderstood 
I never meant to make you feel this.. 
Good things never.. 
Last night you said 
We could spend the night in your bed room 
is all I want in my heads 
spinning like this song out of.. 
control is all you have in this relation- 
ship is sinking quick 
as your sick blood runs through your veins 
You pored my life down the drain 

You said 
You're a lush and I bet you want to touch me 
I regret every memory
