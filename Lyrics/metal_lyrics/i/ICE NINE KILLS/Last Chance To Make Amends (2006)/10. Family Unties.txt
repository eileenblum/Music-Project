Do you ever feel guilty when you lying there in bed 
Thinking about the perfect life we could have had 
Good from the start but we fell apart 
And now we're all alone instead 
I should seen the storm coming from a mile away 
I should have barred the doors just to make you stay 
I can't stand the raining tears 
Don't want to hear the anger every day 

You say you'll make it up to me somehow someday 
I shouldn't think about the passed 
But the passed won't go away 

I don't want the clouds to roll in 
When the sun's been out all day 
I never realized the things we had 
Until you took them all away 
I just wanted you to know that 
What you do affects us all 
I should have seen the ending and stopped pretending 
Cause the writing's on the wall 

Did you ever think about the consequences 
Leaving all of us so defenseless 
You can't deal with complications 
It's not fair no more vacations 
How can you just sit there tongue-tied 
With nothing to say 
Can you give back our fucking house you gave away 
I got no respect for you 
Did you think through the things you should't say 

So fuck off 
I'm not changing anything 
No words can describe my feeling 
I can't keep these thoughts up on the shelf 
Think twice before you sell our house 
And every memory we've had to share 
Go and share them with yourself
