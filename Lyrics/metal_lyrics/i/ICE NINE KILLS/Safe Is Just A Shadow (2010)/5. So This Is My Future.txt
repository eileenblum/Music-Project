If they mean nothing let them go
I can't remember what it feels like on my own
I say nothing to prove they have capacity to
Love anything but themselves

But I believe in dinosaurs because I've seen their bones
Keep digging for the skulls of good intentions and a selfless corpse
That reeks of honest efforts to make things work

Lost forever are our former selves
Can you show me proof they ever lived
Or are they tainted memories of a wishful mind
That's looking for a reason to forgive

If they mean nothing let them go
Are those hands around the shoulders or the throat
Or maybe a bit of both

Try not to cringe at the applause of the opposition
Your twice the fool and half the liar and they're on to you

I say nothing to prove they have capacity to
Love anything but themselves

And I keep digging a search for peace
It's just a shell with nothing underneath
But I believe in dinosaurs because I've seen their bones
So maybe buried evidence will tell me what I've always known

If they mean nothing let them go
Between the good and bad I'm stuck with what I know
