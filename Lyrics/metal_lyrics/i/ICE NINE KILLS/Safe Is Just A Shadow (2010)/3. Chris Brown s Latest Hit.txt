Misdirected with no one to follow 
my eyes are burning to believe
we'll raise the stakes and take the chance that there's no tomorrow
my eyes are burning to believe

but i don't need eyes to see you 
and through the flames this tastes like denial
all aboard the sinking ship now

I choose to jump though the shoreline is miles away
I'm not afraid

And Maybe I bought the stories
but there's something that screams
there's darkness beneath
and I've got my reason to believe

you can run but i've found you before
you want this life?
then i'll give you something to die for
you sacrificed our name to get fucked
god help you  
you gave us the dirt to bury you alive

And Maybe I bought the stories  
but there's something that screams
there's darkness beneath
and I've got my reason to believe 
that you know that i know 
that you're all for show
there's still something that screams to leave
my eyes are burning to believe 

you think you can take me?  
I'll give you one chance to bail out
or stand tall
let's redefine playing for keeps

take us?
have you learned nothing from this?
you can't take us 
our will is stronger than greed 
take us?
you can't take us
and this will is all we need

you brought yourself this misery
my eyes are burning to believe
you cant deny the feeling there's no loss of love just bleeding
