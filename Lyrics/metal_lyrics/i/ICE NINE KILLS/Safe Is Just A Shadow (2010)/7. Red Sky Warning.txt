Dark clouds tie down the sails
Brace yourself for the waves
It's all lost fight for yourselves
There's no one left to save

And I can't find the words to tell you that I failed
We could have beat the distance but the time prevailed
And our breaths the only thing to hold on to

The memories of shore
And the red sky that warned you
Of the lightning igniting the sky
This ship is going down
Nowhere to run
And the worst is yet to come

And I'm not through yet but I'm running out of plans
Not for nothing but you left this all in my hands
And where there are lies there are shadows of truth
And if I told you that we'd be alright
I know you'd see the 
Dark clouds tie down the sails
Brace yourself for the waves
It's all lost

Night can come at anytime but morning only once
When the stars are too far to follow you'll know to remember tomorrow's
Red sky morning
Red sky warning

Make up your min
Trust me and dive into the cold
I'll wait for rescue
On your own
While I try desperately to float

And as the water rises you can doubt your choices
There are voices in your head
Drowning the sense that drives you senseless
The end is coming

The memories of shore
And the red sky that warned you
Of the lightning igniting the sky
This ship is going down
Nowhere to run
And the worst is yet to come
