How could this happen?
Am I dreaming again?
Her bodyâs not moving, Iâm assuming sheâs dead.

This isnât a fucking game.
Thereâs somebodyâs life at stake.
Sheâs covered in bruises,
but the truth is that I never committed the crime
'cause I know I could never hurt a fly.
Then howâd she lose her life?
You're in denial.
What you've implied has burned and stripped
the whites of my eyes.
But what went on that night?

âListen closely as I tell you Iâm not who I seem.
Iâm gonna touch you 'cause I like it when you scream.
I want to watch you when youâre sleeping and thinking of me.â
And thatâs what he told her when he killed her.
That son of a bitch took away my girl.
Heâs gonna pay for it right now.

'Cause you might think you're in love,
and he might promise you the world.
Don't believe what he says.
He's not real.
It's murder and this is it.

My God, you better fear me 'cause I'm gonna find you.
'Cause I'll be out in six months
with his address and a shotgun
and a promise for justice that night.
And Iâll be standing at the crime
so they can throw me back in prison for my life.
If that could bring you back to me.

Last night I dreamed we had a future and you were alive.
It was springtime on our wedding day;
there were birds in the sky.
The sun was glowing; it was beautiful and everyone was there.
I still canât believe that you're gone.
Iâm so lost.
Iâm sorry, I'm sorry.
Donât go. Oh please God, no.

'Cause you might think you're in love,
and he might promise you the world.
Don't believe what he says.
He's not real.
He's just a murderer.

I think that I've had enough.
He says, âYou're too late.
Iâve got a hole to dig and you think that Iâve over-reacted?
She was just so cute.
I can't resist 'cause Iâm a sucker for promiscuous action."
So tell me. Just tell me.
Tell me the truth.

'Cause you might think you're in love,
and he might promise you the world.
Don't believe what he says.
He's not real. He's a murderer.

'Cause I've been lying awake
from this nightmare I feel betrayed.
I gave my life, but you took it away.

Am I dead? Or am I still breathing?

'Cause youâve stolen the love of my life,
so youâll be sleeping with the fishes tonight.

Now listen -
Iâm not religious, but Iâve learned to pray for her.
Iâm not a violent man, but people can change.
So while youâre sleeping,
Iâll slit your throat and drain your blood
and mail it to your mother.
Sheâll discover what a mess you become.
I think she might like that, 'cause I fucking do.

'Cause you might think you're in love,
and he might promise you the world.
Don't believe what he says.
He's not real. He's a murderer.

'Cause I've been lying awake
from this nightmare I feel betrayed.
I gave my life, but you took it away.

There's not a day that goes by...
