Taking everything as a sign of the divine
Or of a purpose that you're never going to find

In every second you can find a tragedy
Coincidence can be dismissed as meant to be.

And you'll have what's left
Anyone's guess is better than a quest for meaning or enlightenment
That never ends.

Making promises changes honest men into shadows chasing lies
When it's all just a game of faking love to hold your place
From side to side face to face
Not getting by without a taste

In every second you can find a tragedy
Coincidence can be dismissed as meant to be.

Something cold is grabbing for my chest [4x]

And it's not letting go
And I'll never know
If it's the doubt or the faith or the love 
Or the hate or the fear that it's all for show

Something cold is grabbing for my chest
