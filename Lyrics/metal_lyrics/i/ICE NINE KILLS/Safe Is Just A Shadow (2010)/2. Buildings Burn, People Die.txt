i've cried out the lies you spit back to me
i've been stabbed in the throat
there's no room to breathe
try to scream

ten years of bleeding out , and in seconds destroy me?
have you learned your lesson now
and was it worth what i paid for

I've lost it all -my dearest vision
i'll take what is left and become what was meant to be
i've lost it all
you ripped the past apart
i'll have to find a way

to rebuild history and what you took from me
but i'd die before i could give up on me
cuz i can't erase dreams so easily
i have tried

you've clawed your way out and the consequence is
you've learned to live with doubt
i hope it haunts you forever

again i'll find my will
and i'll take back what's mine
a new found strength will take the throne tonight

i've lost it all
(but i will find a way)
 watch as you fall
(to leave you behind me)
i've lost it all
i'll take this chance alone
I'll have to find a way
i'll find a way
to leave you behind me

you ripped the past apart
and i'll find my way
