Go walk away
As the sad drunk that you are now
Dismay- it comes in vein
It's a torture by design
One bloodline

If I had hands
Hands of a man
I'd carve out all of my convictions
In this path of stone

Wait and Fall?
(We Fall)
That is the legacy you've instilled in me

To be pushed and pulled
I swear never again never defend
What you are

I built a city on ashes
To rise above the flames
'cause when timing meant everything
You lit a match and walked away

The perfect breed
Is what lies beneath
An unspeakable seed that is growing inside me
Please!
Just rip it out of me
'cause I said never again never defend
What you are

I built a city on ashes
To rise above the flames
'cause when timing meant everything
You lit a match and walked away

A part of you is a monster, you're not just flesh and bone
Your humanity died when you broke this home
I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL

Time will tell us if we can be saved

I search within myself to find a way
To redirect the blame
But in the heart of my father its placed

I built a city on ashes
To rise above the flames
'cause when timing meant everything
You lit a match and walked away

Father you are the failure that I see
You are the monster inside me
