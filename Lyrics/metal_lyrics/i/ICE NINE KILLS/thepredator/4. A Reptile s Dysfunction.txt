You've played the part of a senseless victim
Long enough to bear the burden of hate
Now nothing but a martyr
A plague that leaves you frail and writhing

Oh God where is my trust now,
I'd take it back if I had the chance

Set your sights on annihilation
Screaming this will be the wrath that breaks you down
It all comes full circle now
Full circle now

Invested lavishly into an empty sentiment

You crept away so foolishly
Into the hands of the depraved
Hands that beat your pride away

Set your sights on annihilation
Screaming this will be the wrath that breaks you down
It all comes full circle now
So release me, or release all doubt
I've wasted all of my time on you till now

set your sights on annihilation

Oh God where is my trust now,
I'd take it back if I had the chance

Set your sights on annihilation
Screaming this will be the wrath that breaks you down
It all comes full circle now
So release me, or release all doubt
I've wasted all of my time on you till now

Oh God where is my trust now,
(You've played the part of (a) martyr long enough to lose yourself)
I'd take it back if I had the chance
(It comes full circle now)
(This will be the wrath)
