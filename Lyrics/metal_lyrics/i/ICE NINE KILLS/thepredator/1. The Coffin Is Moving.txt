We are the walking dead
I'm frozen in time never growing
I'm holding my life in my hands
And you're holding your views of the world
Around never knowing

Just make me whole again
Cause I'm a soldier for misfortune
But I believe that we can turn it around
This memory, the final enemy now

We are, we are the walking dead
A generation of negligence
Brought down upon our heads
We are, we are the walking dead

Holding all my cards on the table
I'm able but I lack the components to anchor this down
Cause I'm not over, our indifference
I'll save myself and I will fight for the glory of the crown

We are, we are the walking dead
A generation of negligence
Brought down upon our heads
We are, we are the walking dead

We are, we are the walking dead
A dedication to arrogance
With dreams we never had
We are, we are the walking dead

With dreams we never had!

We are all just children of vanity
We make fucking up into life long careers
We've fallen prey to our parent's fears
We see their faces when we look into broken mirrors

We are, we are the walking dead
A generation of negligence
Brought down upon our heads
We are, we are the walking dead

We are, we are the walking dead
A dedication to arrogance
With dreams we never had
We are, we are the walking dead

We are the walking dead
We are the walking dead
We are the walking dead
We are the walking dead
