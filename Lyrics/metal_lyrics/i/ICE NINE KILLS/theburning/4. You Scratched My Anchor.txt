Don't attempt to take the pain away
Let it go
You're dead to me now
I've learned enough to know that what
You do makes who you are
So here's a lesson in deception
Don't act like you don't know
How to build your own disaster
Out of something beautiful
She says I'm not a liar
Yeah if only that were true
You're like an angel when you sleep
But the devil's breaking through
I'd burn alive if that meant you would too
So stop fucking with me and fucking let me breath
Cause I can tell where you've been sleeping
And Don't act like you're impressed
You've got despicable bad habits
Of taking off your dress
She says I'm not a liar? Yeah if only that were true
You're like an angel when you sleep
But the devil's breaking through

So tell me baby, I'm waiting
But you never would confess
Would it make it easier with rope around your neck
So take a breath
(She says she's not a liar)? Cause I've got all the time it takes
(She's wrong cause I can see inside her)
I wish you could say the same

You're like an angel when you sleep
So go to sleep for good
So tell me if I'm too rough
Close your eyes it's not gonna hurt
Much
For every night that you led me on
Here's another bruise to remind you of
The pain I felt from you
So what's it gonna be
You've got three seconds to speak
Three.. Two.. One
