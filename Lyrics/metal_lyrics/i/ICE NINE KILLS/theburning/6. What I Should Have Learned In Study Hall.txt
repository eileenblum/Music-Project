Well I waited till you packed your bags,
Took a picture and hoped it would last,
With you all the way through,
All the nights you and I couldnât have.
Now I know that it shouldnât be this hard,
But youâve moved yourself so damn far.
And I wonât suffice,
When thereâs two thousand miles to drive.
Iâm thinking it over,
Iâm thinking of all the days and nights
We would spend laughing.
Are you happy...

In Colorado, with the mountains,
Did you like them?
Did you find what youâre looking for?
Because Iâm still searching for the life we were living before...

You seem so young and so full of life,
While Iâm getting older with each hopeless night.
Youâre still always on my mind,
Are we through this time?
Well angels should ask you,
What youâre doing with me.
Iâm an apple who slipped too far from the tree.
But Iâm learning to rot away silently,
As you grow into something more promising.
And now weâve got these god damn words,
That mean nothing when I canât see your face,
Or have your body for touching.
And everything I eat,
It tastes like you,
So what are you trying to prove,

In Colorado, with the mountains,
Did you like them?
Did you find what youâre looking for?
Because Iâm still searching for the life we were living before.
And if I dropped everything and booked a flight,
From Logan to Denver, that my plane would crash that night,
'Cause the odds are against us,
So all bets are off,
Just know you meant more than I ever could want.

Iâm giving up . . .
(Just give me one more time...)
If just for one more night,
Then Iâll be happy to walk away.
You could put on that dress you know I love,
Taking your time zipping it up,
You always knew what I liked.
They'd base movies off our lust, but somehow they wouldn't suffice.

(So just take your time)
Youâve got moves and abuse them,
(Live your life)
And Iâve got pictures to prove them,
(You're not that far away,
I'm sick of every word I wish you'd say)
I'm sure Youâre burning every note I ever sent,
So Iâll find you,

In Colorado, with the mountains,
Did you like them?
Did you find what youâre looking for?
Because Iâm still searching for the life we were living before.
And if I dropped everything and booked a flight,
From Logan to Denver, that my plane would crash that night,
Cause the odds are against us,
So all bets are off,
Just know you meant more than I ever could want.
