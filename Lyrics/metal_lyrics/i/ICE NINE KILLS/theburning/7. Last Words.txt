[EP Version]Here goes the story of a kid we thought we knew. (we thought we knew)
He hid a hate inside, and had a state of mind that put him in his grave!

It began with his friends.
They never noticed the despair in his eyes.
From the pressure.
He thought his life was etched in stone.
Before he made a choice of his own.

And he's dedicated for everyday that he made it on his own!
In his father's eyes he's a pair of dice.
He won't be number one.
(won't be number one)
He won't be number one.

So he tries to comply with everything they've ever asked.
And his life is stitched with one way tickets, to places he don't wanna visit.
He says "I'm never gonna be perfect.
Maybe I don't deserve this but,
I'm doing the best I can.
I've never dealt with the pressure.
Feels like my whole life's etched in stone.
Before I made a choice of my own!"

And he's dedicated for everyday that he made it on his own!
In his father's eyes he's a pair of dice.
He won't be number one.
(won't be number one)

SO!
Save your breath, cause you'll need it when you hang from the rope.
Cause of death: Obvious from your suicide note.
The last words, that filled the page:
"If no one will listen, then no one will miss when I'm gone."

Across town, his dad wakes up all alone.
Never knowing he was never going to come home.
The last thought that filled his head.
"I'll tell him I'm sorry, I'll say I regret what I said.
It's your life. I'll live my own life instead."

And he's dedicated for everyday that he made it on his own!
In his father's eyes he's a pair of dice.
He won't be number one.
He's never won!

He won't be number one.

His bedroom's filled with emptiness tonight.
As the silence cuts through, like a knife.
Knowing he's not there.

He was dedicated for everyday that he made it on his own.
In his father's eyes he's a pair of dice!
He won't be number one!

"I'm never gonna be perfect, maybe I don't deserve it."

He won't be number one.

Oh, and the story goes on and on and no one seems to care.
We will let him know we care. (We care!)
