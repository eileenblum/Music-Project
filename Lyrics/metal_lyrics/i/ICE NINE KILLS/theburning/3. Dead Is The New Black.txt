Brace yourself cause weâre all going down.
Watch us run out this race as we burn this place to the ground.
So tell me, is this what you expected?
Cause weâre so screwed.
But we're far from protected.
Or so they promised you.
Iâll say it slow to get it through;
Weâre wasting our days as we try to get a grip on our lives.
But theyâre slipping away.
And weâre all going to die here.
Unless we can learn to behave.

Cause we try so hard just to live, but just let go.
And watch it all come crumbling down.
Well it hurts to know you're still around.
Yeah itâs sad but true.
Weâre all miserable thinking of you.

So we try to be honest.
But itâs all lies, it's all lies.
And we think nothing can harm us.
But weâre all just sheep.
And the wolfâs at the window as youâre slowly falling asleep.
We try to believe.
That this is what we need.
But weâre all dieing slowly.

Cause we try so hard to live, but just let go.
And watch it all come crumbling down.
Well it hurts knowing you're still around.
Yea itâs sad but true.
Weâre all miserable thinking of you.

Cause you knocked down the walls.

The next time you fuck with me.
Pain will be brought on endlessly.
And Iâll make sure you burn.

Cause you knocked down the walls.

Cause we try so hard to live!

You can lock all your doors but itâs not going to save you tonight!

Cause we try so hard to live, but just let go.
And watch it all come crumbling down.
Well it hurts knowing you're still around.
Yea itâs sad but true.
Weâre all miserable thinking of you.
