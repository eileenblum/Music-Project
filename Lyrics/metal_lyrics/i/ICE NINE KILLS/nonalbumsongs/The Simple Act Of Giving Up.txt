Here I go again
Put me on the first train heading eastbound
And if by June I'm still alive
I promise not to tell my dad I'm miserable
But thanks for all his sacrifice
Cause I'm ashamed of the things that I did
I said whatever it took just to get her in bed
It's kind of fun when you're only a kid
But you grow up to learn that the scars you cut are permanent

But I haven't had one drink in three whole years
There's no need for drinking when you're not here
Do you find it amusing that I'm seeing clear
In this haze of hateful atmosphere
So come on
We're not fooling anybody tonight
We're the king and queen of social-suicide
And things aren't better now
Knowing that we've never found anyone else

So take me out
Cause I'm a mess when I'm alone
And if anyone can help
I think I'm losing it
I grab and hold on tightly but I start to slip
I've got a problem with my self-control
I fall in love when I'm with any girl
But they got it wrong saying 'love is blind' It's fine
It's just disguised as sex tonight

And it's too hard to deny

Now she's got that dress on
You know the one that shows off
The things that she could do to me
And I'm taking lessons
On how not to beg for sex
When it's just a side effect we're feeling from the ecstasy
So come on we're not getting any younger tonight
You're the gracious host and I'm the parasite
It's the simple act of growing old
Mix it with chemicals and we're the end result
Slow down cause I can tell when you're aroused
Like now

So take me out
Cause I'm a mess when I'm alone
And if anyone can help
I think I'm losing it
I grab and hold on tightly but I start to slip
I've got a problem with my self-control
I fall in love when I'm with any girl
But they got it wrong saying 'love is blind' It's fine
It's just disguised as sex tonight

And as long as I'm alive
I'll try to mend this broken future that we call life
And I'm doing better all the time
Just pretend you care for me tonight
I think it's safe to say that I'll be fine this time.

So take me out
Cause I'm a mess when I'm alone
And if anyone can help
I'm losing it
so this one goes out

To all you love struck fools
I've got news for you
I know a thing or two on giving up
To all you heartless souls
I think it's best you know
I play the leading role on giving up...
