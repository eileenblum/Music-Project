[feat. Chelsea Talmadge][Based on An American Werewolf In London]

I'm tearing London limb from limb
It's tearing me apart, but it's us or them
So howl at the moon, oh how can it be?
The softer the skin, the sharper the teeth

(Yeah!)

So call the nurse 'cause it's worse when I'm alone
I've fallen prey to a curse I can't disown
Is it all in my head?
When I'm at hands of a man who's filled with doubt
But this is love I just can't live without
(Despite the soul of the dead)

So howl at the moon, oh how can it be?
The softer the skin, the sharper the teeth
With nowhere to go, nothing to believe
I'm counting on beauty to kill off the beast

(Yeah!)

You bit off more than you can chew
But you taste too good to be true
Safe in my arms you will lay
Cause every dog has its day
(Dog has its day)

So howl at the moon
Oh how can it be?
The softer the skin, the sharper the teeth

With nowhere to go
Nothing to believe
I'm counting on beauty to kill off the beast (to kill off the beast)

So howl at the moon (howl at the moon)
Oh how can it be? (Oh how can it be?)
The softer the skin, the sharper the teeth
With nowhere to go
Nothing to believe (nothing to believe)
I'm counting on beauty to kill off the beast
(So just come put me down)
