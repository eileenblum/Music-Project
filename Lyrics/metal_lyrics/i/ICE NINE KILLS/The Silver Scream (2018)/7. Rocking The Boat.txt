Shark!

"Coast guard, this is the Orca, do you read me? Four and a half miles, two east of Amity Island. This is an official distress call, over."

We all know the place that appears so sublime
But if you dive a little deeper, you'll hit the real bottom line
The head of the town is out there flashing his teeth
A telltale sign about to surface that there's a monster lurking underneath

They're thrashing around but found they can't contain a leak
'Cause I've got a fish to fry that's feeding on the weak
So cast a line for every life they took
It's time to set the hook

We're all just floating in a shallow grave
(Buoyed by the blood of the masses)
That they'd rather sell out instead of save
We're all so starving that we've taken the bait
(You think we would've learned from the past)
That the predator will soon become the prey

We all know a place where the calm flees at night
And safe is just a shadow so we swim towards the light
If this voyage of valor put us on deck for death
We'll compare scars with each other until our very last breath
Yeah!

They're thrashing around but found they can't contain a leak
'Cause I've got a fish to fry that's feeding on the weak
So reel it in with every trick in the book
It's time to set the hook

We're all just floating in a shallow grave
(Buoyed by the blood of the masses)
That they'd rather sell out instead of save
We're all so starving that we've taken the bait
(You think we would've learned from the past)
That the predator will soon become the prey

"Yeah, coast guard, this is the Orca again, we need you out here now. The boat is under attack. It's a Great White, over."
"Roger that, ETA, fifteen minutes, over."
"In fifteen minutes we'll be fucking shark bait!"

Last chance to make amends so try to stay afloat
With sharks like you among us, we'll need a bigger boat
Sold us down the river so the rich could stay rich
But now you've been caught, so smile, you son of a bitch

Sinking with the burning embers
Should be any sign of doubt
That this tale will be remembered
And the tide will forever flush them out

We're all just floating in a shallow grave
(Buoyed by the blood of the masses)
That they'd rather sell out instead of save
We're all so starving that we've taken the bait
(You think we would've learned from the past)
That the predator will soon become the prey
