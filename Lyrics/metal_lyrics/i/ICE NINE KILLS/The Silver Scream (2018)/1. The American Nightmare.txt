[Based on A Nightmare On Elm Street]

"Getting ready for bed at a regular time is one of the most important habits you can learn. David has probably never stopped to think what a wonderful thing sleep is. Dreams are normal too. Going to bed at a regular time each night makes it easier to go right off to sleep."

Rest your head, here's a lullaby
A melody for heavy eyes
Early to bed, early to die
Welcome to your worst nightmare

Fast asleep, it's all in your head now
Past the street where they cursed my name
But I won't be forsaken
Craven my revenge from the shallow grave
Where I went down in flames
The beast has been awakened

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare with American dreams
Of counting the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare, yeah, I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream
Sweet dreams

Fell in love with hate 'cause evil fit like a glove
It's fate that I'm still here
And I won't be forsaken
Wicked when I was just a man
But sickening now and fed by fear
The beast has been awakened now

They all think it's just pretend
You'll never ever sleep again
All your friends are fucking dead
You can't turn down your own deathbed

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare with American dreams
Of counting the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare, yeah, I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream
I'm the American nightmare, I'm the man of the dreams
Where the glove is God so I'm sinking my claws in the silver scream

One, two
Dreams do come true
Three, four
See you at the morgue
Five, six
He'll get his fix
Seven, eight
Now shake the twisted hand of fate

No!
Shake the twisted hand of fate
No!
All your friends are fucking dead

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare with American dreams
Of counting the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare, yeah, I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream
I'm the American nightmare, I'm the man of the dreams
Where the glove is God so I'm sinking my claws in the silver scream
