[Based on The Devil's Rejects]

We thought to be like them
Thought to know a place
We've kept the pace but we're done pretending
We'll fall blind through the fairy tale endings

They tried to sell us the convenience and conformity
Those are the images of the man that I want to be
(Rise up if you agree)

And let your freak flags fly
We're all messed up inside
And forced to act like everything's alright
Wave those freak flags high
Rejected 'til we die
To hell with tomorrow
Just let your freak flags fly tonight

We're taught to fall in line
Taught to know the rules
We've played the fools and we're over the laughter
They can't keep us up in the happily ever afters (afters)

They can't sell us on convenience and conformity
Those are the properties of people that we want to be
(Rise up if you agree)

And let your freak flags fly
We're all messed up inside
And forced to act like everything's alright
Wave those freak flags high
Rejected 'til we die
To hell with tomorrow
Just let your freak flags fly tonight

We form a different mold
Stuck in a different skin
We will never back down
We will never fit in
A different breed
Stuck in a different skin
We will never back down
We will never fit in

So let your freak flags fly
We're all messed up inside
And forced to act like everything's alright
Wave those freak flags high
Rejected 'til we die
To hell with tomorrow

Let your freak flags fly
We're all messed up inside
And forced to act like everything's alright
Wave those freak flags high
Rejected 'til we die
To hell with tomorrow
Just let your freak flags fly tonight (tonight)
