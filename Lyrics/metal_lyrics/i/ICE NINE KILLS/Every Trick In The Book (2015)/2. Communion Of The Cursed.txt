So whereâs your savior tonight?
As angels fall from the sky
His idle hands let me inside
Where I cannot be crucified

Forgive me father, have I sinned?
Who gives a fuck how long itâs been
Just let this holy war begin
I am the darkness deep within
The devil in her daughterâs skin
And Iâll be there âtil the bitter end
Donât raise your claws to me
In the name of God I command you to flee
Relentlessly âcause we believe
By the power of Christ we will set her free

So whereâs your savior tonight?
As angels fall from the sky
His idle hands let me inside
Where I cannot be crucified
You spent your life in his light
Still faith canât save you tonight
Yet evil stands the test of time
I cannot be crucified

So round and round I spin my head
Circulate the blood that I have shed
Pass the cup and drink from me instead
Savor the taste and quench your thirst
With the communion of the cursed
Get on your knees and prove your worth
Donât raise your filth to me
I know youâre in there, Regan
Just continue to breathe
I will cast him out, his grip is weakening
Cast him out, this is his day of reckoning
Through the father, the son, and the Holy ghost
I will lure this parasite from its wholesome host
Eternally, my last decree
If a soul must be taken I demand you take me

So whereâs your savior tonight?
As angels fall from the sky
His idle hands let me inside
Where I cannot be crucified
You spent your life in his light
Still faith canât save you tonight
Yet evil stands the test of time
I cannot be crucified

Now I lay her down to sleep
Her soul is mine, and mine to keep
If she dies before she wakes, Iâll find another soul to take
If she dies before she wakes
Iâll find another soul to take

So whereâs your savior tonight?
As angels fall from the sky
His idle hands let me inside
Where I cannot be crucified
You spent your life in his light
Still faith canât save you tonight
Yet evil stands the test of time
I cannot be crucified

If she dies before she wakes
Iâll find another soul to take
