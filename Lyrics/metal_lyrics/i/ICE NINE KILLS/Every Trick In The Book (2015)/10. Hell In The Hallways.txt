Ostracized and terrorized
The outcast knows no way to survive
Plagued by fear, year after year
Her cries for help fell on deaf ears
Forever unknown and so alone
Where the hell in the hallways always feels like home

The girl that was lost
The girl no one saved, with blood on her face
Maybe now theyâll remember her name
The girl that they crossed
Theyâll never contain and no one is safe
Maybe now theyâll remember her name

Stepped on like shit and drowned in their spit
They tore her world apart for their own benefit
But they canât hold back the certain wrath of a pissed off prom queen psychopath

The girl that was lost
The girl no one saved, with blood on her face
Maybe now theyâll remember her name
The girl that they crossed
Theyâll never contain and no one is safe
Maybe now theyâll remember her name

When happily ever after came crashing from the rafters
She knew she wasnât meant to wear their crooked crown
But look whoâs laughing now

âAnd now the moment youâve all been waiting for
Your Bates High Prom queen for 1976 isâ¦Carrie White!â

Covered in blood, they called it good clean fun
But now her mind is a weapon that they canât outrun
When rivals attack a schoolâs spirit strikes back

The girl that was lost
The girl no one saved, with blood on her face
Maybe now theyâll remember her name
The girl that they crossed
Theyâll never contain and no one is safe
Maybe now theyâll remember her name
When happily ever after came crashing from the rafters
She knew she wasnât meant to wear their crooked crown
But look whoâs laughing now

Look who's laughing now
Well look who's laughing now
Well look who's laughing now
Look who's laughing now
Well look who's laughing now
