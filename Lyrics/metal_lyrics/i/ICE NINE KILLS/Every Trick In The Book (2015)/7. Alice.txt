Dear diary
This battleâs on the verge of emergency
Call in a chemical warfare attack

Tempting fate with the crisis that my vices will orchestrate
Cold sweats as my bold pupils dilate
I could die from the weight of it all
Or make it through another close call

Hereâs a note to myself, âBack to the wall
The higher you get, girl, the further you fallâ
Hereâs a note to myself, âAlone in my pain
How close can you come to the edge before you walk away?â

Through blackened veins the evil in the needle bleeds into my brain
And sells me on the sense of a foolâs escape
I could die from the weight of it all
Or make it through another close call

Hereâs a note to myself, âBack to the wall
The higher you get, girl, the further you fallâ
Hereâs a note to myself, âAlone in my pain
How close can you come to the edge before you walk away?â
Before you walk away

But I just need one more taste, one more taste
Scars earned from searching for solutions
So desperate just to feel
Sold on self-prescribed pollution, just distorting what was real
And so it goes in the throes of what I canât overcome
Painfully numb

Before you walk away
Before you walk away
