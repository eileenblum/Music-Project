A makeshift smile, a polished look
Some rehearsed lines was all it took
He had it down, man, he was good
A woman screams, her mother weeps
A life so changed irrevocably
What he stole from her is gone for good

I see sirens spinning around through my eyelids
As he begs and he pleads just like I did
Is this what my life is? Restless and silent
Where all I can do is survive

When the purest soul is stained by sin
To the public eye where can she begin?
She lost it all and itâs gone for good
And she may never beat the system
But she wonât rest until sheâs turned the villain to the victim

I see sirens spinning around through my eyelids
As he begs and he pleads just like I did
Is this what my life is? Restless and silent
Where all I can do is survive

So officer please thatâs the man whoâs destroyed my existence
Yeah he begged and he screamed just like I did
And for this I was willing to die
It was all I could do to survive
