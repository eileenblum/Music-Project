So come one and come all to the crumbling walls
Of our city now painted with red
As the stench of defeat emanates through the streets
Is the life we once dreamed of now dead?
But we wonât break, we will fight, we will storm through the night
Enslaved to their game nevermore
With the locks on our cage broken off by the rage
Now itâs time to settle the score

We are the frayed, we are the torn
We are the beaten and the scorned
And now youâve forced the beast to bare its teeth
Weâll come in droves like animals
Hungry to reclaim our control
As we fight to bite the bitter hand that feeds
We are the frayed
We are the frayed
We are the frayed

Beyond the barricade oh canât you hear that sound?
The march of tortured souls screaming
âBurn this place to the groundâ
The pack you played for fools, the herd you led astray
Now run the slaughterhouse, welcome to Judgment Day
Youâll pay in blood as your retribution
So letâs gather at the gallows for the execution

We are the frayed, we are the torn
We are the beaten and the scorned
And now youâve forced the beast to bare its teeth
Weâll come in droves like animals
Hungry to reclaim our control
As we fight to bite the bitter hand that feeds
We are the frayed

And when the new day dawns upon our master plan
Just hold your rifles still and then wait for my command
Weâll kill like savages âcause weâre unbreakable
But what did you expect? Weâre fucking animals

Though what good is it to find the same sad solution?
Another power hungry biased fucking institution
We took the fort, we stormed the gates
But what kind of crooked paradox did we create?
We took the fort, we stormed the gates
But became the very thing that we hate

We are the frayed, we are the torn
We are the beaten and the scorned
And now youâve forced the beast to bare its teeth
Weâll come in droves like animals
Hungry to reclaim our control
As we fight to bite the bitter hand that feeds
We are the frayed
We are the frayed
We are the frayed
We are the frayed

Where is the end? What have we done?
Weâre what we swore weâd not become
Despite intent a noble heart still bleeds
Time goes on and history repeats
