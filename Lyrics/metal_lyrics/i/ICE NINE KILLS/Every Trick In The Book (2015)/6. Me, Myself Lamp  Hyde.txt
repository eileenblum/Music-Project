I tear apart the pages of the story of my life
In black and white the wrong and right
Will struggle to survive

And I've been falling apart in the pouring rain
I'm waging war on myself
A captive casualty
Traded a merciful heart for a murdererâs brain
But now I curse what's in my head
Because I can't stop seeing red

Did you really think I would falter my friend?
I've destroyed you before I'll destroy you again

I'm the hell that is your future
I'll incinerate your past
I'm the devil on your shoulder
But I'll always be your better half

We might share one body
But this spine is fucking mine
By now you should know
You're just a spectator
I'm the show!
Is this the end of me?

Cause I've been falling apart in the pouring rain
I'm waging war on myself
A captive casualty
Traded a merciful heart for a murdererâs brain
But now I curse what's in my head
Because I can't stop seeing red

Did you really think you could hyde from me doctor?
Have you not seen the legacy I've carved into the flesh of this city?
Even Van Gogh would call it a bloody good impression
An artist of infection and your just another piece in my collection

A mirror image of perfection
Who's time has fucking come

Cause I've been falling apart in the pouring rain
I'm waging war on myself
A captive casualty
Traded a merciful heart for a murdererâs brain
But now I curse what's in my head
Because I can't stop seeing red

Friends and fellow countrymen lend me your ears
The following revelation's for you skeptics to hear
There exists no good
Only unrealized evil
I'll bring hope to the sinners
And death to the people

I tear apart the pages of the story of my life

Cause I've been falling apart in the pouring rain
I'm waging war on myself
A captive casualty
Traded a merciful heart for a murdererâs brain
But now I curse what's in my head
Because I can't stop seeing red
I'm seeing red
The doctor is dead
I bid thee farewell
Fuck my fate
Just save a seat for me in hell
