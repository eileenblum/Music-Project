Here, weâre just stuck in the spotlight
We should make like shadows and disappear
Silhouettes in the sunset, our final curtain call is drawing near

If parting is such sweet sorrow, to hell with waiting for tomorrow
Hand in hand like we planned, as the night takes us away
And I hope when they find me and you in this tomb built for two
They get the glory for the end of our story, and take their fucking bows

So remember us, the soon dearly departed
And how the war our fathers started
Sealed the fate of star-crossed enemies
You and I both know that death wonât matter
Bring on the poison and the dagger
They set the stage for tragedy

Donât scream cause the show must go on
Though our fairy tale is ripping at the seams
But love doesnât have to be something that we hide behind the scenes

If parting is such sweet sorrow, to hell with waiting for tomorrow
Side by side when we die, as the night takes us away
And I hope when they find me and you in this tomb built for two
They get the glory for the end of our story, and take their fucking bows

So remember us, the soon dearly departed
And how the war our fathers started
Sealed the fate of star-crossed enemies
You and I both know that death wonât matter
Bring on the poison and the dagger
They set the stage for tragedy

They set the stage for tragedy
They set the stage for tragedy, they set the stage for tragedy

So remember us, the soon dearly departed
And how the war our fathers started
Sealed the fate of star-crossed enemies
You and I both know that death wonât matter
Bring on the poison and the dagger
They set the stage for tragedy
