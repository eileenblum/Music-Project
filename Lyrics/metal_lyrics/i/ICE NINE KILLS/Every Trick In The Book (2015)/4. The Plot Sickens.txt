Weâll make it out alive

Lord hear our prayer across the air
The captainâs screaming, âMayday!â
Is Godâs intent final decent or just a test of our faith?
This oxygen is wearing thin, the ground is fast approaching
Our fears intact upon impact, so brothers hereâs to hoping

If we have to crawl out, in spite of this hell
Weâll find a way out, weâll find a way out
Left behind by God or the devil himself
To find a way, find a way, to make it out alive

The sight at hand, gruesome and grand, cannot be rectified
Searching for signs of life in wreckage we canât recognize
We cry out for those who canât be saved
One foot on sacred ground and one foot in the grave

If we have to crawl out, in spite of this hell
Weâll find a way out, weâll find a way out
Left behind by God or the devil himself
To find a way, find a way, to make it out alive

Steady we climb, ready to die
To look salvation in the eye
If we have to crawl out, in spite of this hell
Weâll find a way, find away, to make it out alive
Sixteen souls left in the cold, to be alive is a miracle
It all comes down to flesh and bone
Itâs hard to swallow the unthinkable

The final course we wonât concede
Desperate times call for desperate deeds
Forgiven in our time of need
Desperate times call for desperate deeds
The final course we wonât concede
Desperate times call for desperate deeds
Forgiven in our time of need
Desperate times call for desperate deeds

Crawl out, in spite of this hell
Weâll find a way out, weâll find a way out
Left behind by God or the devil himself
To find a way, find a way, to make it out

Steady we climb
Ready to die, to look salvation in the eye
If we have to crawl out, in spite of this hell
Weâll find a way, find away, to make it out alive

Weâll make it out alive
Weâll make it out alive
