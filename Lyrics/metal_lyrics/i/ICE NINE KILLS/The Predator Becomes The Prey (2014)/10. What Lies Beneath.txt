Well I've been drowning in defeat
But I have heard revenge is sweet
So this is the end
This is the end

Did you really think you'd force me to my knees?
Despite your confidence you'll never bury me
So give it hell, draw some blood
Cause after me comes the fucking flood

I promise I'm not slipping away
Just gotta hold my breath forever
And honestly I need no escape
I'm just caught in the wake of it all and the tide has turned

This is something worth fighting for, I know
But the storm is here
A calamity of hopes and fears
And when the sky starts to give way
The Predator Becomes The Prey
So let the flood gates open now

I promise I'm not slipping away
Just gotta hold my breath forever
And honestly I need no escape
I'm just caught in the wake of it all and the tide has turned

You cannot fight the undertow
The water churns, reaching for life
But I'll find a hand to lift me up


I promise I'm not slipping away
Just gotta hold my breath forever
And honestly I need no escape
I'm just caught in the wake of it all and the tide has turned

You cannot fight the undertow
The water churns, reaching for life
But I'll find a hand to lift me up
