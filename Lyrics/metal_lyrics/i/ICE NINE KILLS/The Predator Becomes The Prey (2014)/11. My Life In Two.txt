Am I just holding onto memories, the perfect pieces of my past?
I never thought I'd be the one to say that dreams don't always last

I've screamed my heart out, given everything
I split my life in two
And I don't regret anything

If I can see the damages by now
Can you hear the sound?
Is it time, or just the voice inside my mind that says
"Don't throw your life away reaching for yesterday"
I only promise I'm not giving up today

And when my mind starts pulling away
My heart will have the fight to make it
I'll turn my back on better days
I know my pride can take it

I've sacrificed half of my life
I hear it in every line I write
That a part of me I lost along the way
I'll never get back again

I've screamed my heart out, given everything
I split my life in two
And I don't regret anything

If I can see the damages by now
Can you hear the sound?
Is it time, or just the voice inside my mind that says
"Don't throw your life away reaching for yesterday"
I only promise I'm not giving up today

And when my hope stops leading the way
It might be too late to make it out
And when jealousy will be all I breathe
Who am I to play the martyr?

My head will bow in shame
When my heart stops leading the way
Who am I to play the martyr?
I'm the one to blame
When my heart stops leading the way
Who am I to play the martyr?

If I can see the damages by now
Can you hear the sound and walk away?
Don't throw your life away reaching for yesterday
I only promise I'm not giving up today
