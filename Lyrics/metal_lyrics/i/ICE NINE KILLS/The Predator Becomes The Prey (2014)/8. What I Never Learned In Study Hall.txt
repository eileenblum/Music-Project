[feat. Tyler Carter]I'm six feet below this burning wreckage
of the life we used to know
Now all the hope we had is dying

From the moment we started
Every single thing I promised you I followed through
And just like a pawn would, all the moves that I would make would be at your decree

But every second spent with you has meant nothing at all
And now the gloves are off let's tear apart all our poisoned memories
I know I'm better off alone

'Cause I'm six feet below this burning wreckage
of the life we used to know
Now all the hope we had is dying

From the moment we started,
Every word you said made me feel that this was real
But still I was guarded
Not the first time I had fallen prey to this cliche'

Every second spent with you has meant nothing at all
I'm left talking to myself where did I go wrong?
And now the gloves are off, let's disregard what I thought you meant to me
I know I'm better off alone

'Cause I'm six feet below this burning wreckage
of the life we used to know
Now all the hope we had is dying
'Cause I'm six feet below
I hope you hear this message
That to live is to let go
But still a part of me is dying

I'm more alive; I'm over being broken
Time has healed all wounds
I wish the scratches that you left on me
Were scars I left on you

I turned my back on the person you've become
And realized what it means to be forgotten
Be forgotten

I turned my back on the person you've become
Now Realize how it feels to be forgotten
So be forgotten

I'm six feet below this burning wreckage
Of the life we used to know

'Cause I'm six feet below
I hope you hear this message
That to live is to let go
But still a part of me is dying
