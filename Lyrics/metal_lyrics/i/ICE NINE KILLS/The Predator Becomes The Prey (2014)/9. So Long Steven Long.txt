You're the only one amused by your inconsequential views
You'd have to strike me so much harder to even leave a bruise

Silence all the bitter and the used
Their never-ending stream of abuse
Comes in the form of a critical exchange
When you say "How does it feel to be damned?"

We are defenders of the broken life we've chosen
And there's no one else to blame
We are defenders of loss, the only ones we cross
Dig down and find the strength today

You resent me like a bastard son
With some crooked aim to destroy
Transparent, as your hollow praise

We are defenders of the broken life we've chosen
And there's no one else to blame
We are defenders of loss, the only ones we cross
Dig down and find the strength today
[x2]

And the Strength to say
"We are defenders of the broken life"

You're the only one amused by your inconsequential views
You'd have to strike me so much harder to even leave a bruise

We are defenders of the broken life we've chosen
And there's no one else to blame
We are defenders of loss, the only ones we cross
Dig down and find the strength today
[x2]

Bury all of your envy away
Damned are the souls of those who shame what I have made
