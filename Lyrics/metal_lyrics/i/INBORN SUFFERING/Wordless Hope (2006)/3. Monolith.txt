Now I feel the sorrow that you once embraced
I see the forgotten lies
Left to rot as statues watch the mortals play
Their game

Night guides my fate as I cry
From her pain
The sea of regrets dies
For all that remains I was dying once again

I'm still bleeding while horizons die
Empty shadows walk away
Spellbound no delusions I'm tapped
In my maze of torment I drown
Sadness I cannot defy
Once again the time to weep...
The time to endure
They want me to die
They ask me to rot

Eradicate!

The time to weep
The time to endure
The bitter taste
Time is sorrow
She wrote on her grave
The eye fears
Betrayed by your gods
The monolith of pain prevails

Monuments in the misty horizon
A pale figure shows me the way
Where there is no return from the silent sea

I hear the final embrace for my departure
And now the act begins in vain
Now I feel
The shadow's eye on me
Can't you see
There is no return from the silent sea

All alone, I sigh
All of the guilty souls hear the fear in my cry
The monolith of the lovers dream
Feel the sorrow emptying my soul

I'm still bleeding while horizons die
Empty shadows walk away
Spellbound no delusions I'm trapped
In my maze of torment I drown
Final embrace
As the sun dies she whispers
We walk among the dead
The eye is a certain dream

They want me to die
They ask me to rot
Can't you see
There is no return from the silent sea

Monolith of the last resort
I'm still bleeding while horizons die
Empty shadows walk away
And I dream of you
