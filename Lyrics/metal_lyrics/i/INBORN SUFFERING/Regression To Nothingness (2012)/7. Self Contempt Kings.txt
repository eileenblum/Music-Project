A million paths to take
Sinking into the pits
Burning at the stake
Forgetting our own wits

Defaced humanity
Unlimited powers 
Unlimited vanity
Shame of ours

A million starving beasts
Longing for meaningless truths
Gorging in endless feasts
Betraying their youths

No strategy for survival
Unnatural ways of living
Our greed is out of control
Consuming our lives in suffering

A million paths to choose
Inorganic beings
Primordial ooze
Self contempt kings

Looking into the eyes of void 
To where the world stops to be

Losing a comfort long enjoyed 
Preparing the times to be
