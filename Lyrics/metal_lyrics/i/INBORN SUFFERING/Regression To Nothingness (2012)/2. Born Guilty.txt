Doesn't matter what I made
Doesn't matter what I said
Forever condemned to witness
A scarlet world you once forbade
Made of carmine, blood-red
And crimson walls of distress

Doesn't matter what I made
Doesn't matter what I thought
Your sweet words tangled my mind
Your angel gaze was masquerade

Born guilty, Forerver on cloud zerp
Born guilty, everyone can't be a hero

Only scorn for thuths long sought
And contempt for those left behind

Doesn't matter what you made
Doesn't matter what you do
I will hunt you down like a game
In this azure world that you jade
Made of cobalt, persian blue
And sapphire peaks of shame

Doesn't matter what you think
Doesn't matter what you thought
Now it's time for hatred and warfare
Time for your life to crumble and sink
With the memory of all that I fought
And the end of my recurring nightmare

Born guilty, forever on cloud nine
Born guilty, now I got this peace of mine
