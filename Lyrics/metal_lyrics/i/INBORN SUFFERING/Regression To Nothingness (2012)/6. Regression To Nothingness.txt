Storms
Like a thousand needles
Invading my head
Thoughts
Cannot reach
The barrier of my mouth
Mindless in motion
Ghost amongst ghosts
And so my reason...?

Long gone
In the consentual rush
To nowhere
To the night
Ad noctum

I don't want to see
I don't want to feel
Surging pain haunting me
Relentless chimeras
Biting my mind

And I awake
In sweat and howls
Wondering
Pondering
Lingering
What's happening
To my being

And I walk
To no place at all
Wondering
Pondering
Lingering

At the heart 
Of distress 
Fear
Withering
Sobbing
Are my companions

The interstellar void
Frightening
Horrifying
Takes hold of my very

Curling as a child on the concrete ground 
Denying the attraction to Nothingness
I regress to the point zero
What the religious book says
Is not ashes to ashes
It is eventually void to void... And stellar dust
Period

You shall fear the remembrance
Of your own remains
The Epitaph of your memory stone
Cause there's no afterlife
Just a cold hole

Cosmic blackhole of your stupidity
Never to get unveiled 
Foolish beliefs for foolish people 
A newer state of pain

You are all actors of your own demise 
The inscription in fetters of fire

Life is not a story of wealth 
It's only a Regression to Nothingness

Storms
Like a thousand needles
Invading my head
Images
Cannot reach
The barrier of my eyes
Eyeless in motion 
Wraith amongst wraiths
And so my reason...?
Lost

The process Is on the way 
Blind... Deaf... Quiet 
The loss of my senses

At last I feel what's coming 
As my feelings vanish 
In an Inexorable

Helpless 
Wingless 
Fall 
Nihil

Worms of death
Lead to the same 
Grand Finale

The commonness
Of the human condition
Regression
Regression

Little 
By little 
Step
After dtep 
The rot 
Stinks 
Anyway

Willy
Nilly
The end
Is the same
Onward
To Nothingness
