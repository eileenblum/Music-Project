This stain on the wall 
Is a picture of my soul 
So dirty and ashamed 
Neither free nor tamed

Carving my beliefs into stone
Burying my own existence
Never ascending to the throne
Forever far in the... Distance

Falling deeper and deeper
Into the realms of slumber
Abandoning this filthy abyss
Turning my dreams into glorious bliss

Sleep all night and day
Trying to dream the dream again
Another beast to keep at bay
Another move to rid the pain

Though reality makes its way 
My feet made of clay
My body so painful
I have been such a fool

Eyelids heavy like lead 
Mysterious consciousness 
Between the living and the dead 
Transcending my acuteness
