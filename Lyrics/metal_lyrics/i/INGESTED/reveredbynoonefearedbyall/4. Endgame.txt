The second coming of a creature redesigned to kill
Not for the fame or glory
Just because i love the thrill

Never stopping
Never stopping, till i reach my goal
Never ending
Never ending frenzy, lost control

And now the pattern's shifting
Motives becoming clear
Settling the score, now this is my retribution
Ice cold killer, systematic execution

Unleashed
Unchained
Released from all your shackles
Apex predator
Lions don't fear jackals

Kill!

This is the endgame
So prepare to kill

I usurper 
Born to hurt you, born to kill
A true berserker
Defeating, beating, never sleeping

One by one
You'll get a beasting

Bitch i told you
This is closure
Friends are close
My enemies closer

Domination through cremation
Fucked and twisted
I'm your creation

I'll bring this to a head
Now's our time to take the reigns
I'll take what's mine you're dead
Just know that you're to blame

This is the end of an era
Your deeds and actions couldn't be any clearer
Your story has no more words
They say the pen is mightier than the sword

How can you be a king when you are just a corpse
You can't be better, you're inherently worse
Applying force to the source
Your murder I'll endorse with no remorse

You're just a morsal bitch
And i'm the main course

The normal rules do not apply
You'll watch me rise, I'll see you die
This is your reckoning
This is my shot

How can you look down on me
If i'm at the top

This is your reckoning
This is my shot
How can you look down on me
If i'm at the top

Not one of you will be able to look us in the eyes.
The fear when you realize what
the children you left behind have become.
We're fucking murderers.

Kill!

This is the endgame
So prepare to kill
This is the endgame
Now it's time to kill

This is the endgame
So prepare to kill
This is the endgame
Now it's time to kill

Kill!
