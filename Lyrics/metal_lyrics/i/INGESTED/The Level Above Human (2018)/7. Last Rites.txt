Cast out of heaven and closer to hell
My eyes narrow as I'm blinded by the sunlight
Is this who I am and who I'm meant to be?
Forced out and exiled from my birthright?

As my circle grows smaller I feel more secure
As the faceless fall down by the wayside
Did I know you, or did you even ever know me?
This sea of doubt takes me under with its riptide

Your vain attempt to teach me a lesson
Kept me in the dark, and you kept me guessing
The illusion of something that kept me obsessing
What felt like a curse now I know was a blessing

Her words have become all the fuel that I need
For the fire to burn in the flames of my greed
And the seed that's been sewn will have grown and bear fruit
I'll just wait for the harvest, and she'll follow suit

The more that we struggle, the deeper we'll sink
Into lies that we've spun, but the truth is what stinks
I'll dose myself up, my teeth I will grit
While I slowly drown in my own bullshit

Falsified feelings, I've become what she needs
Now she only sees me as I wish to be seen
Loyalties shrinking thinner and thinner
She hopes I'm her saint, but she's knows I'm a sinner

Scared for a change, now she's stuck in a rut
She won't give me her heart, so I'll tear out her guts
Do I sound like I'm joking? Don't make me fucking laugh
And you'll see what I am when you feel my wrath

Now you return to the life that you know
Return to the shackles that stunted your growth
Two circles, full circle, we must break this cycle
Rehearsed it so perfect it's now a recital

As my circle grows smaller I feel more secure
As the faceless fall down by the wayside
Did I know you, or did you even ever know me?
This sea of doubt takes me under with its riptide

You had a choice to make but you chose wrong
So I channeled my rage, and I wrote you this song
And this song that I'll sing and the darkness it brings
Is what you deserve when you fuck with a king

When you fuck with a king
