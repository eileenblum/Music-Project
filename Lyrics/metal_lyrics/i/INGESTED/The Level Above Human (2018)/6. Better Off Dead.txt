You think your law is gospel, you think you know the rules
We've burnt down all your effigies, and fostered all the fools
We've snatched the life right out of you, we know you're not amused
This is the way it is. Murder our enemies
We are the shepherds, bitch. Kings, gods, and deities

We tell you to fight, you kill them instead
We tell you to maim, then you bring us the head
Display all the traitors, the rivers run red
Who wants to live when you're better off dead?

Violence is our weapon, prolonged torture
Break them, it's fear we hunger, make it clear we have no peers
No one, mock their weakness, all are cowards
Spineless, now crawl across the floor like the maggots you are

You're better off dead
I'm fucked in the head
Better off dead
I'll laugh as you beg
You're better off dead

Every single fucker holds a candle to our everlasting flame

Kings, gods, deities, all of the above
Wipe away your tears and buckle up
Domination endless as we fuck and we cut
If the sheep become the goats, we will slit their fucking throats

Violence is our weapon, prolonged torture
Break them, it's fear we hunger, make it clear we have no peers
No one, mock their weakness, all are cowards
Spineless, now crawl across the floor like the maggots you are

Every single fucker holds a candle to our everlasting flame
From Surreption to Surpasser, you we are the masters at the apex of our game

We are the chosen ones
We built the pedestal

Power most incredible

Dead, better off dead
Dead, you're better off dead

You're better off dead
I'm fucked in the head
Better off dead
I'll laugh as you beg
You're better off dead
