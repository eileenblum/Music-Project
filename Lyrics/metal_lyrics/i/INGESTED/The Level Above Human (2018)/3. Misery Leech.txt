Perception's not reality but it overshadows truth
From sheep to wolf you took my skin to bury all the proof
Starve

You will be forgotten with your ever-fading youth

I belong to no one
I'm a fucking champion

Starve, you'll die alone, you self-absorbed piece of shit
Starve, I hope you hate yourself. Malignant, fucking spoilt bitch
Starve, you've shown you're worth, you proved you're shit
Starve, I'll make your bed, lay down your head, now die in it

You think your cunt makes kings, but treason's more your thing
You fucking stole my dreams, can't wait to hear you scream
Obscene. You just knew exactly who'd listen
Everyone you meet conditioned, parasitic malnutrition

Starve, you'll die alone, you self-absorbed piece of shit
Starve, just shift your shape, to find a host that you fit

You think your cunt makes kings, but treason's more your thing
You fucking stole my dreams, can't wait to hear you scream
Obscene. You just knew exactly who'd listen
Everyone you meet conditioned, parasitic malnutrition

Bet you thought you'd bury me, you won't break my disposition
You deserve your hollow life, I survived through my perdition

Bask in it, your mask will slip
You'll show us all that you're counterfeit
Spineless shallow, hypocrite
I am no longer within your grip

I belong to no one
I'm a fucking champion

Starve, you've shown you're worth, you proved you're shit
Starve, I'll make your bed, lay down your head, now die in it
The privilege, the burden. The nightmare now lifted
Breaking the circle, the shapes have been shifted

I wanna see the fear in your eyes
You took away everything from me
No mistakes you're a misery leech
Fuck

Your histrionic, power trip
You drink away, you fill your slit
Left in the dirt but I'll never submit
I'll live in peace, you'll rest in shit

I belong to no one
I'm a fucking champion

Just wait I'll get my fucking revenge
