Wear the crown, I am the sovereign,
Imperator across this planet renowned
Bow down, bow down! The king has returned, get down on your knees now the tables have turned
They'll all run for cover for smiting a brother, I'll lie to the father and steal from the mother
I did my time and I've paid my dues, you need me more than I need you

Pushed aside and left in purgatory
Who knew that friendship could become a perfect murder story?
And now we try to hide the mess that we made
My words cut deeper than the sharpest of blades
The king is dead, long live the king!
Heed these words and the violence they bring
Bow down, bow down! The king has returned, get down on your knees now the tables have turned

I the usurper, anointed in pain, undefeated, defend and retain
One by one, put them in the ground
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
I wear the crown, I am the sovereign,
Imperator across this planet removed

The king is dead, long live the king! Heed these words and he violence they bring
Bow down, bow down! The king has returned, get down on your knees now the tables have turned

Look at you crawl, bend to my will you will suffer I reign over all. Never ending
Slave to my words, follow no question you march so blindly towards your damnation
I am colossal, leviathan amongst the gods, I am immortal, my legacy will have no equal
The king of kings atop my head now rests a crown of thorns
I am eternal, I'll light the torch and burn it all down
Burn

Feed my ego, with the flesh of the dissenters, drunk and euphoric on the power I am man's tormentor

I wear the crown, I am the sovereign,
Imperator across this planet renowned
Bow down, bow down! The king has returned, get down on your knees now the tables have turned
Bow down! Bow down, now the tables have turned
The king is dead, long live the king
Imperator across this planet renowned
