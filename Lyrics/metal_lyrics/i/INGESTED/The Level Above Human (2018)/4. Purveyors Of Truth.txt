The crowd looks up in awe
It was the smoke without the fire
All so quick to pass your judgement
Now we throw you on the pyre
Who said this and who did what?
It makes no difference when you're fucking burning
Maybe if you focused on your lives
Then the world could keep on turning

Call them out quick, fucking delete
Start the witch hunt, write out your speech
Rinse and repeat, drama loving culture of cowards
Dying to be the first to cast the stone

Oh shit, your porcelain mask has spilled
They're not the ones who's the fucking victim
Your whole morality upside down
Swimming in the sea of deceit, now fucking drown

We don't give a fuck about your status
White knights and call out queens
All I see is rooks, ravens and vultures
Peeking at the feet of the kings
Quick to point the righteous finger
Quicker to backtrack with the proof
No one asked your vapid opinions
Pawns, no t the purveyors of truth

Call them out quick, fucking delete
Start the witch hunt, write out your speech
Rinse and repeat, conceited

Innocence, insolvable
Guilty by generation
Social sadists
Sniveling subordinate
Unimpressed unbreakable
Debase, desist

The crowd looks up in awe
It was the smoke without the fire
All so quick to pass your judgement
Now we throw you on the pyre
Who said this and who did what?
It makes no difference when you're fucking burning
Maybe if you focused on your lives
Then the world could keep on turning

Egocentric and fragile
Are you only mad 'cause we've described you?
Moral indignation
Are you only mad 'cause we've described you?
Brainwashed bastards, condemn them
Are you only mad 'cause we've described you?
Good

Your whole morality upside down
Swimming in the sea of deceit, now fucking drown
Are you only mad 'cause we've described you?

Quick to point the righteous finger
Quicker to backtrack with the proof
No one asked your vapid opinions
Pawns, no t the purveyors of truth

All I see is rooks, ravens and vultures
Peeking at the feet of the kings
Now who's the fucking victim?
