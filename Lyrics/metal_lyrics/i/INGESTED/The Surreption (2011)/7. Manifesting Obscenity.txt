So sick and twisted searching for the perfect one to kill,
A fucking victim, prepare to meet my thrill,
You will know my shame.

Stroking my fingers down her sweat soaked skin will she,
Cry out? Or will she keep her mouth shut, knowing what will be of this slut?
Guiding her gently to the grave she's already claimed,
Dirty bitch on the street pulling tricks, filthy whore taking money for dicks.

My victim.

My twisted admiration for this fucking dirty mess,
This strange fixation,
With this slut that I will now possess.

Grabbing, stabbing.
Smashing, slashing.
Hacking, cracking.
Maiming, claiming.

Asphyxiate and this fucker will choke,
So she can be what I've always wanted her to be,
Dead meat, now I'll watch this bitch die,
I'll fucking see this whore bleeding where she lies.

Lies.

My twisted admiration for this fucking dirty mess,
This strange fixation,
With this slut that I will now possess.

I'll fuck the dead.
I'll fuck the dead.

Drag me to the Whore of Babylon so I can fuck, away my sins,
And be reborn, through her flesh.

Her flesh.

This fucking life is all over,
This new abomination of my flesh is far from closure,
I take my first breath,
Reborn through death.

Parturition.

My flesh is borne of a carcass,
I am a monster, I'm godless,
What the fucking hell am I?
You'll see you never can stop me.
