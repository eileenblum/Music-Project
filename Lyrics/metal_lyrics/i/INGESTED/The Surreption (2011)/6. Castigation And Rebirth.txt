Go!

Enter my grave of sorrow, your final resting place!
A world of pain and horror, witness your own fall from grace!
Your curiosity the price you'll pay!
You will regret this day now get down on your knees and fucking pray!

You've been searching for me.
Don't you like what you see?

I am the thing you could never deny!
You'll fucking reap what you've sown.

Morbid visions of a world you cannot understand, and yet you still want a taste.
Suffering. screaming. dying and bleeding, but you're still begging for more.
More, and when your flesh begins to fail, you will become like me.

You are, a servant of your creator.
A fucking tool of demise!
A destructive castigator!

Reconstruct, your flesh is my canvas.
Creating new forms of life.
Unrecognizable features,
Birthed from the blade of my knife I have severed your birthed from the blade of my knife I have severed your life.

To this creature that I'll create, I'll feed my loathing and my hate.
I am the spreader of disease, I'll bring this world down to it's knees.

Come on and roll the dice!
Come on and name your price.
Come on and take this test!
This is my game of death! 

An aberration, of the human form.
Abomination, merged into the swarm.

A new found body.

Give you're flesh to me.

Oh!
