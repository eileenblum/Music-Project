caught between the forces of two worlds
a tragic work of art
my soul is torn apart
the burning sand of time bleeding through me
my bones will snap and screech, my goal is out of reach
out of reach
dancing, before me
beyond my fingertips, my mind and soul eclipse
feeding me with lies
an invitation, becomes an accusation
this isn't darkness, this isn't light
this is the shade before the day becomes the night
this is the cause of all my rage and all my frustration
this is the core of my hatred, this filthy foul temptation
misogynistic thoughts are all designed to break my will
these filthy desires will only serve to bring me down
it will take hold of me
my fucking misanthropia
these things inside my head
won't stop until I'm dead
no one can ever see
what has become of me
alone I'll suffer
I'll be the father of my own crimes
an evil for all times
I have become much more than you could ever know
I'm reborn in darkness
you will pray, just to be saved, your last day
I will wipe the human race out
I'm the beginning and I'm the end
the world will burn when the skies open I will descend
repent, your life has reached its end
no way you can defend
you're gonna die so motherfucker repent
I will bathe in the souls of the fallen
and I will cleanse all of my fears
I will be known forever, my name is scorched into the years
it will take hold of me
my fucking misanthropia
these things inside my head
won't stop until I'm dead
this isn't darkness, this isn't light
this is the shade before the day becomes the night
this devastation of human lives
this reformation of which no one survives
no one will live through this
their flesh eaten by the abyss

I am omega
