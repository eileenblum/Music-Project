Die!

Wiping all life from the world!
Scorching flesh, conflagration!

This usurpation, my time is almost near.
No conscience burning, I'll reign and domineer.
...My determination!
I'll be the one that brings an end to all your lives.
Clearing, this fucking filth.

You know what!.. I am!
Crawling, you'll fucking beg to me!
You know who!.. I am!
Drawn to my dark divineation!
You know what!.. I am!
Burning! you'll fucking pray to me!
You know who!.. I am!
Bow down and give into me now.

Wiping all life from the world!
Scorching flesh, conflagration!

No one will see the dawn. I am the bringer of the storm!
No one will live through this, my power..
You cannot resist!

You know what!.. I am!
crawling, you'll fucking beg to me!
You know who!.. I am!
Drawn to my dark divineation!

Flesh! Burning! Melting! Peeling away!
Revealed, Returned.
Flesh! Burning! Melting! Peeling away!
Revealed, returned..
Un...to... me!!

My autocracy! Belies my dread theocracy!
The blood of thousands birthed my crown..
No one can ever take me down!
Down, down...
No one can take me down!

Wiping all life from the world.
Scorching flesh, Conflagration.
I'll bring forth your damnation.
