The will of man is broken, humanity's souls are now forsaken.
Tortured and murdered, their bodies torn, apart.
Reborn, disgusting, birthed from the essence of the weak.
Fulfill the blind prophecy and bring the end that's been foreseen.
We are salvation, we are damnation, annihilation.
This is the end, we are the stillborn.
Bodies piled up, and burnt to the ground, we are the stillborn.
Humanity's grave is waiting, it sees the flesh melt from their bones.
And more will follow, no one is safe, all die.
The new flesh will engulf the old.
New life will entomb the dead.
This reconstruction, through pain and suffering.
This is the end of all you have ever known.
Stillborn.
The new flesh will engulf the old.
New life will entomb the dead.
Achieving the ultimate goal.
Surpassing the boundaries of human suffering.
Humans, you think you're safe but you will not exist.
