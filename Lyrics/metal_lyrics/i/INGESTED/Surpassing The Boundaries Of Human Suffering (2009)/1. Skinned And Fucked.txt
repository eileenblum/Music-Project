Violent bursts of rape induced frenzy, another dies by these hands of mine.
I feel sick of these useless lumps of flesh that stain my eyes.
Faceless, they're watching me it seems, they know my every thought and sin.
My desire for the blood that stains my soul.
Tearing at her flesh to know what is behind her skin.
Her legs are open wide to ram my dick in.
Smash her down, this bitch has gotta go, I cannot bear to let her live.
Then she begs, so I break her fucking neck.
Conflicting personalities, they haunt me, but I cannot see.
Blinded, instinct forces me to kill.
Tied up, gagged and bound, ass is up, face is down.
Resist, sodomy, virgin ass bleeds for me.
Hacked up, slashed up, fucked up, smashed up.
Scrape the shit out of her ass and stuff it right up her cunt.
Down on her knees,
so I can kick out her teeth,
so she can't bite my rancid cock,
rape this bitch, cut her fucking throat, kill.
Body shaking, my hands are sweating as I grasp her scrawny neck.
Visions plague me, as I release this beast inside my head.
Savage wounds, her skull is caved in,
Vicious wounds, her ribs are smashed in.
Rape-induced wounds, her cunt is kicked in, frenzied attack.
Skinned and fucked.
Voices inside of my head, they make me kill, they'll overcome.
The faceless, I feel them, beneath my skin I will succumb.
I am the faceless.
