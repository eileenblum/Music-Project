I am the tree that bears the fruit
I am the snake that whispers truth
I am the siren you pursue
this rotted Eden, meant for you

this will mark the last time I will travel down this road
unpicking stitches from the flesh that lesser men have sown
this retribution for your lies
I see the deceit in you eyes

disillusion, father figure let cruelty be their mother tongue
sons and daughters, bred to slaughter, give no quarter
this family of disgust, built from trust, devoid of lust, their will has been crushed
I command them to turn you to dust

apostasy, an unthinkable sin I shall flay you of skin, left impale for all to see
should you not give your life to the sword, the knife, entrenched in theocracy
seize the death that was meant for me

this will mark the last time I will travel down this road

all the blood has drained and spilt and crimson lakes lie deathly still
I'll gaze at my reflection
with no second thought for those I've killed
a murderous sociopath, a narcissist
I'm born of wrath, pride, envy, gluttony, lust, sloth and greed

the sin, the sinner, and nothing precedes, kill the killer?
you live in a dream

this will mark the last time I will travel down this road
unpicking stitches from the flesh that lesser men have sown
this retribution for your lies
I see the deceit in you eyes
and in my wake I will create a thousand disciples borne of hate

disillusion, father figure let cruelty be their mother tongue
sons and daughters, bred to slaughter, give no quarter
this family of disgust, built from trust, devoid of lust, their will has been crushed
I command them to turn you to dust

I am the tree that bears the fruit
I am the snake that whispers truth
I am the siren you pursue
this rotted Eden, meant for you
