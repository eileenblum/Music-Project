[Feat. Julian Kersey (Aegaeon), Taylor Wientjes (The Kennedy Veil), James Schuster (Eighty Thousand Dead/Delusional Parasitosis) and Alex Teribble (Slaughter to Prevail)][Jason]
My destruction, immense and timeless,
And I am the nemesis of man,
Infinite is my power, this world I devour,
But I am where it all began.

[Julian]
I appall weakness,
This entire planet is mine.
As I continue my campaign against mankind,
Lifeforms cower, I sit at the throne ov fallen enemies.
Aegaeon, conqueror.
Bow before the elite, exalted one.
All shall witness the cosmic storm.

[Taylor]
Prophecies foretold of eternal flame consuming the entire planet.
Putrid stench, scorched flesh circulates throughout the air.
As you burn, your rapture realized in full,
Commence the ritual,
To bring the ending days of man.
The ending days.

[Jason]
The definition of depravity,
The heirs to mankind's atrocity.
This is my law, you will obey,
The words ever clear.

[Jason, Julian, Taylor, James and Alex]
Condemn this whole world to suffering,
One by one you shall bleed.
Present thyself as an offering, I'm the God you can see.

[James]
Punished for their insolence,
They are meek.
Their foolish naive nature,
Makes them weak.
Breaking down their spirits, destroying their fantasies.
I am who you should fear, I am the hateful all powerful.

[Alex]
Gods of dust and sand, they want to never hunger with those who have created and they worship in the shadows of truth,
Cowards and slaves of their desire, once freed,
Will never come back, here.
Killer of mankind is not war but fear.

[Jason]
Destruction of humanity,
The heirs to mankind's atrocities.
This is my reign, and you will pray,
The words ever clear.

[Jason, Julian, Taylor, James and Alex]
Condemn this whole world to suffering,
One by one you shall bleed.
Present thyself as an offering, I'm the God you can see.

[Jason]
I am the author I preach all that you need,
The words that others believe,
Designed for the weak and naÃ¯ve,
All deserve to bleed,
Serve to attach and deceive.
Persist, pursued and persevered,
And still by no-one I'm revered,
Here I am, the puppeteer,
The ropes they hang from made from fear.
I'm the God you can see.
