I am, the despoiler, 
I am, the abomination bow before me at the altar of carnage and pray for a quick death.
I held my hands out, father hear my pleas.
Ignored and left to die, I'll bite the hand that feeds my appetite,
Consumed with spite I'll claim my right to this earth.
Five crowns, but combined as one.
Mirror image, this bastard's bastard son,
You know I'll prevail the price of betrayal this vicious portrayal.
This is my heresy,
I, usurper, interloper.
This is my legacy,
A fear that echoes through the ages.
This is my heresy,
Is immortality worth it?
This is my legacy,
I'll save my malice for the ones that deserve it.
Cut slice divide and sever crushed any that resisted.
I'd rather be despised forever than to never have existed.
Cut slice divide and sever crushed any that resisted.
I'd rather be despised forever than to never have existed.
Dreams in liquid form this vile baptism I'm reborn through the cunt of a dying whore,
Ribs pulled back these wings that I've adorned.
I am the symbol of what is to come,
A taste of what can be done.
I am, the despoiler, 
I am, the abomination bow before me at the altar of carnage and pray for a quick death.
Triumph through treachery,
Weigh the remains you unearthed it.
Control through tyranny,
Don't throw the towel just burn it.
This is my heresy,
Is immortality worth it?
This is my legacy,
I'll save my malice for the ones that deserve it.
Cut slice divide and sever crushed any that resisted.
I'd rather be despised forever than to never have existed.
Cut slice divide and sever crushed any that resisted.
I'd rather be despised forever than to never have existed.
This is my heresy.
This is my legacy.
