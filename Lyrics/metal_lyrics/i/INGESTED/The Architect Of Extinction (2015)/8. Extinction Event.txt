putrid, weeping, limbless
their bodies piled around me
rip them, tear them, shred them
this world is now my altar
delusionless grandeur, my anger
translated, dictated, negated
here I stand triumphant
dominant, as I skin them and fuck them
contort them condemn them
cremate them and fill them from the stem
harvester of blood, conductor of chaos
there is nobody above
the noble often fall
yet villains shall ever enthrall
this is my call, I stand tall, kill them all

the only true way to cheat death is to perform an action so callous
so horrific that I'll never be forgotten
to die with grief, is to die with dignity, so let mankind live in perpetual nightmares
to die with honour defies my infamy
I'll show no mercy, regardless of prayer

these are the blueprints for my malice, I am the architect of extinction

my design close to fruition
in the centre of this bloodthirsty bedlam
my calm and balance
this is my prowess
my design close to fruition

these are the blueprints for my malice, I am the architect of extinction

my design close to fruition
no rivals, no competition
to die with grief, is to die with dignity, so let mankind live in perpetual nightmares
to die with honour defies my infamy
I'll show no mercy, regardless of prayer
I decorate the streets with meat and bone
and for your sins you shall atone
I created a masterpiece from your treason
you will submit, accept defeat
