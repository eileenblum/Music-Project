The wind in our banners
Thousand thrones roar
Signals to mortals
The outbreak of war
Now comes the time
To repay for blood
That shed our father
For their ruined homes
Desecrated by christian dogs
The wolf way i'll fight
Eagle sign meaning will give
To offering in battle fulfilled
Bloody glow upon the sky
Steel hooves beat the earth
Here come the chariots of gods
In this battle I am not alone
