Good morning Mrs
Sunshine
Have you heard the
Latest news
The moon your
Eternal husband
Died between your
Lies - And my dirty
Truth

Last night I've
Been outside
Waiting for his
Light...
The stars told me
The story
He has been
Sacrificed
The lord of
Rottenness
Lay down his mystic
Cards

Now the smell of
Fear
Hangs deep in the
Trees
And fields are
Deserts of tears
Darkness and
Death stands near
By my side - Couldn't
Exist
Without his holy
Light
