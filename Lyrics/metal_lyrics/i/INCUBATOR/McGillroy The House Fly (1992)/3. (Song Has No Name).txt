Look around in our little paradise
Taste the innocent fruit
I'll bomb your brain away
There's power of technology
Which'll guard your human way

God is dead - Jesus crucified
And the pope will burn
On his gallow tonight
I can't believe this shocking truth
Can't look around - Can't open eyes
So taste just the freedom of
An forbidden youth

Everyday I walked through the streets
Bones instead of trees
Blood instead of water
A land which keeps on smiling
In the end of the book

Nobody wants to speak your dirty
Language
Nobody wants to hear your sadistic
Message
Questions build up - Never answered
More than just your god can see

So let's creep in the graves of our
Brothers and sisters
To forget an evil culture
