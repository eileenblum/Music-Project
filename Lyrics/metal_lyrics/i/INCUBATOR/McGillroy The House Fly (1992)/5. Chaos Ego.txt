Hunger, thirst, pain my
Veins
The horizon keeps on
Burning
The wind blows strong
Melodies fall into dust
A fog of sadness checkled
To my lonely skin
All illusions standing still

Raped chaos calls for
Manipulated stress
Is this my judgement or
My rebirth in heavens
Womb...
These time has been lost
All green has just been
Killed
My flesh for all mistrust
Blood on the ground

I start to understand
These deal has been made
These voice promised
Unknown
Tears change into time
My brain keeps in turning, I
Sink to the ground
The cries of the unborn
Sold, lost, and found...

Nails in my eyes for a life
Without pain
controlled emotions from
Mc Gillroy
Are burning insane...
