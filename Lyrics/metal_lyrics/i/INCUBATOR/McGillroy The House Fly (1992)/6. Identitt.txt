Mindmelting sorrow - The eyes of the blind - See you
Everytime and everywhere you stay - A part of
Destructed illusions - Praying for your destiny
Your primitive tongue is torn in half - Wintergarden,
Summerdreams a cry without a sound - The murder
Of fatality tries to rip his life away - Corruption
And brutality for preachers without identity!!!
Trees lie in darkness - The truth sleeps in dust - The
Blind just can see - Greets to the master who's
Controlling me - Nails in y eyes for a life
Without pain - Pain controlled emotions from Mc
Gillroy are burning insane -
