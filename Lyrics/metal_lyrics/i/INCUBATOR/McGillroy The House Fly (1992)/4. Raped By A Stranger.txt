Confusion seems to be your way
My murdering is inconsequential
Close your lovely, lying eyes
Stay bride
I'll guard your last meal
Before your execution
Your treacherous
Dissatisfied face
Will rot by hunger for lust

Let's stop talking all about
That shit
Let's fuck show me your
Genitals
The hunger for perversion
Strikes back
I'll break your personality
You lie in a sheet of organic
Juices

The plague of myself buried
Among your bones
I've got a present for you
It's an overcrowded box
With corpses of the new-born
