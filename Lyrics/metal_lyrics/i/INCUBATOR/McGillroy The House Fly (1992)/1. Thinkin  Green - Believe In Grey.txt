Blind identity, trauma contains
Simple crime in brutal murders
Starring in a new existence
Await your obligation...

Horror surrounds a part of fantasy
Thinking green believe in grey
A chronic infection grows up
Toys rise up - Cannibalistic taste
Sickness
Believe - Escape - Programmed - Check

Follow my steps - Feeling black
Frightened blood in frightened veins
Altars of harmony await your sacrifice
Knowing what you see - Dreaming boundaries away
"Mc Gillroy is watching you!!!"
Go with the light, to explain sending hate
To another world - Exist!!!!

Thinking green - Believe in grey
Living pride - Dying hard
Swimming endless in a sea of helplessness
