Bloodred industries
Blue sky
Moving towards my suicide
This is my deathwish
Convicted to you
Deformity of blood
Melting psychopaths
In pieces of plastic
Emotions

Anger and love
For a life without sense
The mirror is moving
My eyes standing still
Children - Crying loud
And love disappears

Dictators and heroes fly
Away with the wind
My earth keeps on burning
Destruction means love
Sending my god in a prison
Of gore

Prisons of gore
My spiritual power means
Horror and war

Bloodred industries
Blue sky
Moving towards my suicide
This is my deathwish
Convicted to you
Deformity of blood
Melting psychopaths
In pieces of plastic
Emotions
