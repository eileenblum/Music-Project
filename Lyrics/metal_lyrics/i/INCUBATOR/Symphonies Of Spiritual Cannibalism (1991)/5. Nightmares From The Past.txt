Remember
Our chase after criminals has
Been successfull
Here's just another outcast
Which wants to pay
Icy winds blow through the
Streets an voyager
Without an aim
Years ago there was an event
Which seems to be forgotten soon
Strange emotions climbing up
Deep inside out
So many times you hoped so much
These history will be lost
Empty eyes are staring at
You there's no escape
Your sins are chackled to
Your mind never forget
You've lost your self control
You feel your fate
All these uncountable victims
Are bleed to death
The charge
Now it's your turn
To leave your life
We sacrifice your body for all your games
We spread your worthless blood
Between our trash
