Mistreated decay
Life is born in memories
Maids are buried by ashes
Headless preacher drinkin' their blood
Forget your disgrace
By selling souls to hell

Stop - the - madness

Murders ignored - pain fills my fear
Burning houses possessed by my curse
Sadistic creatures - torture my soul
An endless manipulation calls me god
