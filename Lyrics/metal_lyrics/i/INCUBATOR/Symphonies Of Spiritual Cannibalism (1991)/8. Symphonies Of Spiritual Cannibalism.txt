Dreaming, living in
A world of horror
Sickness in your brain
Mirrors of agony
Show your own personality
No control about
Your feelings
Listen to a voice
Coming from inside
Symphonies of
Spiritual cannibalism
Ice cold winters
Desserts of ice
No emotions from yourself
It seems to fade away
Empty eyes staring
In your mind
Fear in every part
Of your mind
The clock runs faster
Time stand still
Schizophrenia
From day to day
