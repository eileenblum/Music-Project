Look at the morning sun
A thirteenth month was born
Who wants to play these game?
Answer your mission now
Reflection of your mind
Leads me to your grave
Silently your question will
Be answered
Could a existence be born
Which made dreams to mystic lies
You're buried in a cage of reality
To sell your soul, for a trip
To yourself
To life in a world of
Forbidden doors
Run away, leave your camp
Love and hate melt fast together
Leave a body of fear
Brainwork to forget
Your existance!!!
Meet the hangman, at the backdoor
Of your lost paradies!
Create your harmony
In shadow of the lie
Be a part of the forgotten
Kingdom
Faster - time stand still
Schizophrenia from day to day
