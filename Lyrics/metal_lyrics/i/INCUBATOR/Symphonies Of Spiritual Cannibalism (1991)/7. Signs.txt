A lost illusion - hides my dreams
Lay down the curse - of brutality
Darkness shines on filthy thoughts
Programmed to obey - mystic fear
Fear will tear a world a part
Build up by human errors
Forgotten love in a room without
Doors will lead you to the end!
Bestial lust - to destroy
Genetic power from hell
Unborn dreams to rape a natural sign
Horroble nightmares to sick to
Dream, a puppet without leader
Flesh is lovely, love is guilty
Blood is art
Dreams for children
A light without a lamp...
