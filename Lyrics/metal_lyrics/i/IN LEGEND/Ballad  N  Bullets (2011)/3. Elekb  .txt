Hankering â is gripping way too tight
My body heat â 113 Fahrenheit
Infuckinsanity â
Tries to drag my mind in fight
Refuckinality â
On point of vanishing from sight

A raging thirst â
I cannot slake it in my plight
My blood disperses â
Iâm acidifying inside!

I disobey the call of receptivity â
My body punishes hard â my disloyalty!

I canât resist no more â free falling meâ¦

[Background choir:]
Ah â close to eternity â
Yeah â today Iâm alive!

Feeling eternity so close
Could be my last decisive dose
Hearing my curtain call
Today Iâm alive

Hate intends my will
To give in to temptation
To stop my fall â supply myself
With fleeting levitation!
