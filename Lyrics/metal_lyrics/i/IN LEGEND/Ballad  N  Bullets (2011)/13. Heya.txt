Take up the fight for your personal aim
Go get possession of the ball in your game
The peopleâs livingâs anyway not the same
So get yourself back in the ring!
Come bid defiance to your own common sense
Give up your habbit just to speak in defense
Your own potential is so fuckinâ immense
So get yourself back in the ring!
Come on â
Donât call it your dream,
But make it your life!
Say hey, 2, 3, 4:

Heya â
Youâre the lodestar
So donât you dare to lose your aim
Hold on to all what you are â
âcause you are godsend!

Itâs your decision what youâre living for
If youâre a doer or a peopleâs whore
If itâs a never- or forevermore
So get yourself back in the ring!
Hey!
You think itâs nonsense, no, I disagree!
The lord Himself gave you His warranty
That if you trust Him Heâs of certainty
So get yourself back in the ring!
Come on â
Donât call it your dream,
But make it your life!
Say hey, 2, 3, 4:

Heya â
Youâre the lodestar
So donât you dare to lose your aim
Hold on to all what you are â
âcause you are godsend!

Why donât you just come off your doubt?
Relieving all your mind -
Secure your confidence by choosing to be fine!
You can rely on Him to bail you out
His love is deep affined,
Why donât you overcome your fear and start to shine?
Donât call it your dream,
But make it your life!
Say hey, 2, 3, 4:

Heya â
Youâre the lodestar
So donât you dare to lose your aim
Hold on to all what you are â
âcause you are godsend!
