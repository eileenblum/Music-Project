The people anxious to avoid mistakes
Until the weakest is about to break
Then theyâre pretending being so amazed
At how some people never keep their face

They for sure feel that way:

Got a broken heart
Got a broken soul
Got to stand apart
In that deep black hole!

Human
Error
They for sure feel that way:

Got a broken heart
Got a broken soul
Got to stand apart
In that deep black hole!

And my heart â
Donât want to stand no more
Apart â noâ¦
No more away â
Donât wanna stand â no
No more
No longer more
Apart

No one stands apart!

Got a broken heart
Got a broken soul
Got to stand apart
In that deep black hole!
