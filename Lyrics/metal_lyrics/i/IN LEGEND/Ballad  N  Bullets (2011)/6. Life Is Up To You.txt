Feels like a bona-fide fool
Poisoned by their words
Life is what you doâ¦
No one taught my way!

Wonât you be free?
Free of otherâs will -
Life is what you doâ¦

Wonât you be forever free?

Oh â realize
Life is up to you!

I never wanted to be
I never wanted to be
The thing they wanted to make of me
I never wanted their damn mercy

I never ever obey
I never ever obey
I never ever will go astray
âcause Iâm aware of all I am!

I got a voice inside â
My own bijective guide
A lifelong leading line
Appealing to my heart not to resign
I got a voice inside â
My own protective light
Guiding me straight to the core!

Hold on â stay
Hold on to your way
Life is up to you!

I never wanted to be
I never wanted to be
The thing they wanted to make of me
I never wanted their damn mercy

I never ever obey
I never ever obey
I never ever will go astray
âcause Iâm aware of all I am!

The road you walk is your esprit
No matter where youâre going â
Stay the way you are!
Wonât you be free â
What are you waiting for?!
Come make your day!
Make yourself!
Make your life!
Right away!
I wanna fill your soul!

I never wanted to be
I never wanted to be
The thing they wanted to make of me
I never wanted their damn mercy

I never ever obey
I never ever obey
I never ever will go astray
âcause Iâm aware of all I am!
