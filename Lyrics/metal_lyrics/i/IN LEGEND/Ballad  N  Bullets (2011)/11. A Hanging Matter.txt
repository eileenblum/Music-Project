When the stranger came to town
He didnât mean to cause disconcertment
He never really had a chance since
Nonconformity
Was their reason to break down
His well-pleased independence
âcause it didnât quite comply
With their own life-understanding

Look, heâs sent to the gallows
He stands up straight and sings:

Yeah â
Bless yourself
Youâll never take
Nor will you make
My spirit break

(And) all the people looking blank
Not a single soul objecting
As the freethinkerâs head sank while
Re-established truth

Did stabilize their peace
Suppressing the distracting
But evil begets evil â
So they canât suppress his tune

He stands up straight and sings -

Yeah â
Bless yourself
Youâll never take
Nor will you make
My spirit break

People that we are â
They are the people that we are â
The fuckinâ people that we areâ¦

And so he sings:
Canât you â
Canât you see that my heartâs so pure?

Yeah â
Bless yourself
Youâll never take
Nor will you make
My spirit break
