(Your lies do hurt â sheâs crying!)
Letting her bleed away!
All rightâ¦
Get off that fuckinâ way!
You gotta send her a light
To be seen in the dawn
Of your pathetic way
Of acting lonely in distance
The language you told her
Once was that one from the heart -
Now itâs gone with your headâ¦
Your lies do hurt â sheâs crying!

Feeling her worries
You donât care!
Guiding her love with your liesâ¦
Feeling her leaving
Sudden caresâ¦
Losinâ your love, your disguise!

Letting her bleed awayâ¦
Get off that fuckinâ way!
You gotta send her a light
To be seen in the dawn
Of your pathetic way
Of acting lonely in distance
The language you told her
Once was that one from the heart -
Now itâs gone with your headâ¦
Your lies do hurt â sheâs crying!

Feeling her worries
You donât care!
Guiding her love with your liesâ¦
Feeling her leaving
Sudden caresâ¦
Losinâ your love, your disguise!

Hey!
Why do you waste your time?!
Why donât you love yourself?!
Why do you save your fucking pain?!
This life, is your way
And itâs offered by a power
Donât you dare to give it back before to try
Keep track!
Youâre a liar â
Why donât you face her the truth of your heart?
Youâre a coward -
Youâre such a coward -
You stupid coward -
You stupid coward -
You fuckinâ coward -
Your lies do hurt â sheâs crying!

Feeling her worries
You donât care!
Guiding her love with your liesâ¦
Feeling her leaving
Sudden caresâ¦
Losinâ your love, your disguise!
