[feat. Inga Scharf of Van Canto]What does it matter if I cry?
Itâs more than I can put into tears â
So whyâ¦
My hope is shattered â Iâm broken
Tomorrowâs just a place beyond my reach -
Why should I?
Iâm awayâ¦

From the mountains
Clear as sunlight
I come to rescue
Iâm the white knight
On my way to
Your salvation
To save a kingdomâs, a queenâs delight!

Down in a hole â abandoned
Itâs like your heart is going to cave in
High and dryâ¦
But in the end thereâs a spirit
Spirit away all your fears
Out of your heart â take my hand!

From the mountains
Clear as sunlight
I come to rescue
Iâm the white knight
On my way to
Your salvation
To save a kingdomâs, a queenâs delight!

Dark Lord

(Fight the) Dark Lord
(Once your) Heartâs gored
(With his) Dark sword

Valor

(Iâm your) Valor
(When youâre) Vapor
(Iâm your) Savior

Here she comesâ¦
Here I am!
Turn(s) night to day
Wonât you be my sanity
And end this shadow play?
Wonât you please release my mind
And I want you to
Aoothe by your singing
I will listen the praise of life!

From the mountains
Clear as sunlight
I come to rescue
Iâm the white knight
On my way to
Your salvation
To save a kingdomâs, a queenâs delight!
