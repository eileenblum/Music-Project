The life that we shared
Is the life that I know
Is the thing that I miss
Since you had to go

Colours are fading
As clouds rolling byâ¦
Did you know they call me a fool?

Universe is dying
And I want to fade with you away
Universe is dying
And I want to fade with you away

Gone with the wind
Your name left behind
I donât want to stay and remain colourblind
So come on, my love!
You gotta come back to life
For I no longer want to be a fool!

Universe is dying
And I want to fade with you away
Universe is dying
And I want to fade with you away

I will
Let go
Of you
Wonât sail
Behind
The wind
The wind carrying you

I will
Let go
Of you
And my
Heart
Wonât be in the way!

All of you gone with the wind!

Universe is dyingâ¦
And I want to fade â with you
Awayâ¦

Fade with you away!

Universe is dying
And I want to fade with you away
Universe is dying
And I want to fade with you away

I will
Let go
Of you
Wonât sail
Behind
The wind
The wind carrying you

I will
Let go
Of you
And my
Heart
Wonât be in your way!
