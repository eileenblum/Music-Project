Hey â disincentive mind
Stop your dashinâ kind!
Your spoken word put into effect!

It is hard to find
Supporting strength behind
An innocent filled with blame
Let me be!

Just tell meâ¦
Why-
Would I need to tie
My heart to your broken
Wings to touch the sky?
Try â
To reach me on high
Without a word spoken
Cowards just donât fly!

Hey â stop to sadden my heart
Stop to take it apart
Must identify all I am

I got heaven âside
Wonât be classified
By your fucked up and
Unfounded blame
Let me be!

Just tell meâ¦
Why-
Would I need to tie
My heart to your broken
Wings to touch the sky?
Try â
To reach me on high
Without a word spoken
Cowards just donât fly!

Youâre wearing down my heart
Youâre wearing down my heart
Let me go â to be
Let me go â set me free
Let me be â let me go!

The broken wings never fly!

Why -
Would I need to tie
My heart to your broken
Wings to touch the sky?
Try â
To reach me on high
Without a word spoken
Cowards just donât fly!
