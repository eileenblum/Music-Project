Wake up â dare to fly!
Shout out your battle cry!
This is your own reply
To all those suckers in you way!
Never fear â listen up!

I am not your eyes anymore -
I am not your heart to explore -
You got a life to realize
You got yourself to idealize
Youâre the deputy of all of your dreams!

So â too long trailed behind
Youâre sick of being kind!
To all those suckers in your way
Never fear â blowâem away!

I am not your eyes anymore -
I am not your heart to explore -
You got a life to realize
You got yourself to idealize
Youâre the deputy of all of your dreams!

Oh- with a wing downâ¦
Youâre way too weak!
With a wing downâ¦
Your heartâs too bleak
Never fear â be self-made!
You got all your reasons
To use all your wings and
To fly like a bat out of hell!

I am not your eyes anymore -
I am not your heart to explore -
You got a life to realize
You got yourself to idealize
Youâre the deputy of all of your dreams!
