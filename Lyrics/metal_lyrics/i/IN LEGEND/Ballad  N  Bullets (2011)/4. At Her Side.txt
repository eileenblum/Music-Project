She smells the rain before it touches my skin
She can hear single drops falling down
Shouts out my name into the hard blowing wind
Sheâs the sail, braves the storm, feels the ground

Come on
Singing an angel this sweet melody
Come on
Sing with me all along
Sheâs the rhythm â the groove underneath
Sing with me â sing along!

Of all the girls sheâs more than just one of them
Sheâs the bright side of life â wild at heart
How would I like to let her know I feel safe
At her side when it rains way too hard

So come on
Singing an angel this sweet melody
Come on, sing with me all along
Sheâs the rhythm â the groove underneath
Sing with me â sing along!
Sing with me â sing along!

And the priests keep praying lies
No matter what it takes â
Her faith is her self-created guide
Not the rain â not the blame
Nothing pulls her down
To me the more they pray â the more they say
Her shelter makes my day
Sheâs an independent natural
The bright side of my life â wild at heart!

She smells the rain before it touches my skin
She can hear single drops falling downâ¦

So come on
Singing an angel this sweet melody
Come on, sing with me all along
Sheâs the rhythm â the groove underneath
Sing with me â sing along!
Sing with me â sing along!
