You told me that it wasn't personal.
I traded everything for this and now it's gone.
Where is this coming from?
Once more you're recovering? from all the things you've... done.

I'm strong enough to breathe the air into my lungs.
I saw this coming, maybe this is... right.

All I want is for you to remember me.
Not sure I've done enough.
In the end this is only a melody.
I guess that I will just try my best to sleep and I'll wake up wondering,
If anyone knows what is wrong, with what I have become?

I'm strong enough to breathe the air into my lungs.
I saw this coming, maybe this is... RIGHT!

I'm? begging, I'm begging you.
I'm begging, I'm begging you.
If anyone knows what is wrong, with what I have become?
