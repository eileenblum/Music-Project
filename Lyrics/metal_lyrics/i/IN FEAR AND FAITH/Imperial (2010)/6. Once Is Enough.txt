Oh you want to know what happened to me?
I've made a few mistakes.
Something needs to change.
Oh you want to know what happened to me?
I'm better off this way.
Things are falling into place.

Yeah that's right,
I'm gonna be the one who takes you when you die.
Yeah right, I am satisfied without being born twice.

You know you're wasting time trading life for lies to discover.
(I mean this is eternity)
In this life there's only wrong and right, that's for you to decide.
(You better make up your mind)

Oh you want to know what happened to me?
I've made a few mistakes.
Something needs to change.
Oh you want to know what happened to me?
I'm better off this way.
Things are falling into place.

If you are only trying to make me plead.
Did you ever stop wondering?

If I can't change your mind I'll just disconnect mine.
Yeah, that's right I am his only son, the one who had to die.
Yeah right, the only way I'll go to heaven is in disguise.

You know you're wasting time trading life for lies to discover.
What's left of you won't matter in the end.
(I mean this is eternity)
In this life there's only wrong and right, that's for you to decide.
(So don't forget you have a choice)
