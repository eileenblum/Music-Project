So you think that I should I be a man free of sin
I've done enough to prove that I am not capable of this
I'm not claiming that I've only bad
But I'm not surprised I've created distance from my past

365 days to go!
I was a different man!
Watch my world caught on fire!
There has been a slight change of plans!
When I wake up .... the world is yours!
......
All of this is consequence this shall be my last!

Maybe I am crazy the evil way I'm, I'm ok I'm alive today
But it won't take away this pain

One day I'm expecting to pay for the things I've done in this life 
I've tried to take my time but it never turns out right 
I know it's just a matter of time

If only all of you could see into my mind 
then you would probably find a boy clinging to life

Maybe I am crazy the evil way (.....)
I'm, I'm ok I'm alive today (.....)
But it won't take away this pain
