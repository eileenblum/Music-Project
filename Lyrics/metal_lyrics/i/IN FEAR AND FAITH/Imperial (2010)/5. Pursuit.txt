The rage subsides between these two.
I see that you don't belong to me.
It seems to me the stage is falling through,
Onto you.

And if you let me go,
I'll be used, I'll be used.
And I won't let them ever become what you,
What you are.

It's happening again, only different now.
So much to say, so little time.
Whatever happens ..... is in your head.
The only thing left to do is stay alive and disapprove this ...

When it's over, it won't be the end.
If I see this through, we can stop and strand.
(GO BACK!)
You'll never be prepared, for this ...
We'll save this for later, just keep breathing.

All you have is a stage for everyone to know.
What's happened to you? What's happened to you?

You ...
...
... so you don't need to speak out loud.
I've got everything you need here, so shut your mouth!

When it's over, it won't be the end.
If I see this through, we can stop and strand.
(GO BACK!)
You'll never be prepared, for this ...
We'll save this for later, just keep breathing.

I can't, I really can't say much about you.
