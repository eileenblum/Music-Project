You're the only one who knows this.
Oh my god.
Lose control in spite of me
You've already lost your place
I won't follow until you tell me,
you'll be fine.

This is a disaster, who would have thought
we'd end up here.
All this time wasted on other things.
We were meant for something greater.
But now we are ready for what comes later.

Clear the air before you go
You can't even smile,
But at least we will know
our places within the limits of self control.

Feeling alive for the very first time
I could die right now.
This is a declaration.
Just remember nothing is ever so bad
that it could not be worse.
