Who am I to say what is right and what is wrong
Like I know that it's okay (It's okay!)
So hear what you want to hear
If it's my words then I guess I will stay (I will stay!)
If not then I'll be on my way.

Don't wait, just think and
I don't care where you were before, it doesn't matter
(It doesn't matter where you came from, or where you want to die!)
All this time you should be feeling stronger but your not
(speak your mind don't be afraid, 
they cannot tell you what to say. 
Don't let them keep ??? it's in your head, 
just tell them this is what I said).

Weigh down it's not over smiles
It's something dark, now let it out.

Hope has lost the battle
I'll bring your faith to life
I'm calling you out to show you everybody
Is laying their hearts on the line

I don't know why I've been dying to know if anyone feels the same inside
(Just let it out)
I don't care where you were before, it doesn't matter
(It doesn't matter where you came from, 
or where you want to die. Let it out! Let it out!)
All this time you should be feeling stronger but your not
(Just lets it out!)
(Just lets it out!)
