Itâs time to make your mark. 

Now listen up, Iâm not your counselor. 
Iâm not your father who held you back 
when you were ready to move on.  

My life is based on someone elseâs lie. 
I am no role model. 

I alone found a way inside.  
Leave it alone so you save your pride. 
I know what is hidden in your eyes.  
Itâs terrible knowing how to take your soul. 

I hope that when youâre dreaming 
you see me and youâre screaming. 

Now go tell everyone you know 
Iâm not quite finished yet. 

And you know youâre breathing the first sighs of a lonely life. 
How do you sleep at night? 
How do you sleep at night knowing that Iâm coming for you? 
This time Itâs only right to teach you a lesson. 
One day youâll wake up to find me waiting. 

I alone found a way inside.  
Leave it alone so you save your pride. 
I know what is hidden in your eyes.  
Itâs terrible knowing how to take your soul. 

I alone found a way inside. 
Leave it alone so you save your pride.
