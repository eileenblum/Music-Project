Watch me donât follow me 
Iâm failing my family 
becoming a tragedy 
you cant stop this by any means 
I wont give an apology 
so watch me build tolerance 
I donât need any deliverance 

As I recall it was unbearable 
itâs all in my head 
Weâve already lost a significant amount of time 
you know I couldnât fake this if I tried  
I realize that the single life is not the average alibi 
Weâve all been ready for the lonely life 

This is tearing me apart 
maybe its not for me maybe someone else should be 
tearing themselves apart 
then again maybe Iâm right where Iâm supposed to be...

They always say that the only way 
is to promise yourself to stay 
Thereâs so many of you that come to watch me die 
They always say that we have to be  
What theyâre waiting for 
But youâre letting it all go by 

Weâve already lost a significant amount of time 
you know I couldnât fake this if I tried  
I realize that the single life is not the average alibi 
Weâve all been ready for the lonely life 

Watch me donât follow me 
Our lives have been running out 
and weâre fine with where weâre heading now.
