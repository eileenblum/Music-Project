Let's get this straight
The moment that you met me was your biggest mistake.
One you'll never forget.

I can't imagine never meeting you and knowing you.
Life without consequence is no life at all.

The past few months I've done some terrible things.
But you were my worst, you are my biggest mistake.

You are the only one that's changing me,
from what is in my heart.

You had to know, you had to know.

I never want to see you again.
You want forgiveness then you'll find religion.
This is my finest hour.
Everybody's gone at last.

I can't stop.

You are the only one that's changing me,
from what is in my heart.

I can't fix everything.
You're leaving me no choice, at all
Today is lost, is lost, is lost

Taking back all the words that you've said,
all the things that you've done.
It will not change a thing.

We're all a part of this,
we can't make it alone.
And all the seas have been pulling what's left to the bottom,
creating a place for the lonely.
And all the seas are falling over my head,
washing me back to the beginning.

I shouldn't have failed to make a change within you.
There's a reason why the evil won't prevail.

I know you know!

It's been a long time coming.
You know you shouldn't be testing me, be testing me.
It's been a long time coming.
You know you shouldn't be testing me, be testing me.

You're honestly, you're honestly thought that I could change this time.
You shouldn't be testing me!)
You're honestly, you're honestly thought I could change this time.
(You shouldn't be testing me!)

It's been a long time coming.
(Taking back all the words that you've said!)
You know you shouldn't be testing me, be testing me.
(All the things that you've done! It will not change a thing!)

It's been a long time coming.
(Taking back all the words that you've said!)
You know you shouldn't be testing me, be testing me.
(All the things that you've done! It will not change a thing!)
