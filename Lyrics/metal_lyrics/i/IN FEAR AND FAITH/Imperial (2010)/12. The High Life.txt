Just so you know if it were up to me I would be living the high life
But for now I'm taking steps in the wrong direction just to get by
So take it or leave it

This ones for you, you know who you are
Please leave well enough alone
Just because I'm not smiling doesn't mean I'm about to go
Don't pick me up I'm fine right where I am

I'm going to leave this town tonight
And fall asleep til the sun rise
Cause I got to change my life
What did this to you?
I don't need to be told twice
I'd be willing to give my life just to say goodbye
What did this to you?

Please leave well enough alone
Just because I'm not smiling doesn't mean I'm about to go
Don't pick me up I'm fine right where I am

So many things could have made me this way I don't regret a single day 
This is what I was made for, was made for, was made for!

Just like you did before me I will follow sound
I plan on being everything you were to what are you
I know you didn't live long I cannot promise I will to
I'm saying everything I can as a tribute!

I'm going to leave this town tonight
And fall asleep til the sun rise
Cause I've got to change my life
What did this to you?
I don't need to be told twice
I'd be willing to give my life just to say goodbye
What did this to you?

...
You made me who I am today
I remember the first time I heard you it changed my life!
