Let it out!

It's the end of the world I wanna hear you scream those lungs out
On a pillar I stand, casting a shadow over poisonous gas
Put on your mask and let it out!
Tonight I see you all in a different light
I see the side of you that's begging to stand and fight
Hey! Hey! You're already dead men,
So give it to me like the anger manifest! Come on!
SCREAM! At the top of your fucking lungs!
SCREAM! At the top of your fucking lungs!

I can see every mind from this perspective
I can pen every blank page that your temples seem to hide
Can you hear me? Listen closely
It's all I ask of you tonight if you'd be so kind

Give me the strength to part this sea
Tear a hole through memory
(The anchors fall...)
Those tides come up as I'm awakened
As I'm awakened from my calm
I'm just a sliver of the system that feeds on broken men
It's all I live for, it's all I live for!

It's all I had
It's the end of the world, I wanna hear you scream!

Tell me, was it everything you thought it would be?
Did you meet your goals? Did you fulfill your dreams?
It was everything I knew it would be
Just a machine dictated by the hands of greed
Life of filth, brought to an end by the hand that fed us all
Fed us all the federal dream
Bit by the hand that feeds

I can see every mind from this perspective
I can pen every blank page that your temples seem to hide
Did you hear me? Did you listen closely?
Just let me fill your minds with my thoughts one last time

And give me the strength to part this sea
Tear a hole through memory
(The anchors fall...)
Those tides come up as I'm awakened.
As I'm awakened from my calm
I'm just a sliver of the system that feeds on broken men
It's all I live for, it's all I live for!

Every night when the moon is high
I close my eyes and wonder when they'll say goodbye
At which moment will I take a breath for the last time
When can I make peace with my demise?
Don't let us wonder anymore

Give me the strength to part this sea
Tear a hole through memory
(The anchors fall...)
Those tides come up as I'm awakened
As I'm awakened from my calm
I'm just a sliver of the system that feeds on broken men
It's all I live for, it's all I live for!

Give me the strength to part the sea
Tear a hole through memory
The anchors fall...
The tides are coming up as I'm awakened
It was everything I knew it would be
Just a machine dictated by the hands of greed
It's all I had!
