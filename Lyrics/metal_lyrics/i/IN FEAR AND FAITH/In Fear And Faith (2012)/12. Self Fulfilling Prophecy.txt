I see this world so clearly behind my mask
And everyone's guilty of striving for sovereignty,
Striving for victory over the rest
I won't play adversary anymore

I won't bare witness to coercion,
But I'll bear persistent arms
I'm scouring through these lessons burned into my mind
And closure is out of reach
What was the motive behind the end of time?
The end of reason
The act of treason

You've all eroded the fibers of morality
You bear no mind
For the existential ones you left behind

I see this world so clearly behind my mask
And everyone's guilty of striving for sovereignty
Striving for victory over the rest
I won't play adversary anymore

If what you had preached
Was what you believed,
I wouldn't live amongst this mass of debris
The places I've seen, the memories I keep
Claimed by your self-fulfilling prophecy

You've awaken a side of me
That will never succumb to sleep
I've built an immunity
YOU WON'T INFECT ME!

I see this world so clearly behind my mask
And everyone's guilty of striving for sovereignty
Striving for victory over the rest
I won't play adversary anymore
