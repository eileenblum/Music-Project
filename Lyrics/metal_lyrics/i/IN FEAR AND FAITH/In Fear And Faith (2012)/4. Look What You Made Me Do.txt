Instant fame, is the name of the game
The pieces were carefully put in place
And nothing's gonna stand in my way
But he who exhibits poise and grace
Is left to fend for himself in the worst of ways
So make them shiver, but don't cause a scene
Do everything you can, just to look 18
Never forget to convey what you mean
Or just dangle from the strings of the powers that be

The list goes on and on and on
And the only way to stay sane
Is just to bottle it up and wait
For the moment you take the stage
And see their hands keeping time
With the rhymes that you created
I'm finally worth something, I finally made it

So take it all, I don't wanna sell my soul today
Look what you made me do, it happened anyway
How can I find a way home?
Back to the honest days
So take it all, I don't wanna sell my soul today
Look what you made me do, it happened anyway
You chewed me up and spit me out like I knew you would
You owe me a childhood

Instant fame!

There was a time when I
used to dream of this life, imagine the limelight
Hindsight is 20/20 and I'm losing my mind
I'm fucking sick of this shit, will I be something more?
Will I ever exist? I will never submit
And take the side of the inferior
They all bestow their bodies to the earth
The soil, rich with self indulgence
I stand upon

So take it all, I don't wanna sell my soul today
Look what you made me do, it happened anyway
How can I find a way home?
Back to the honest days
So take it all, I don't wanna sell my soul today
Look what you made me do, it happened anyway
You chewed me up and spit me out like I knew you would
