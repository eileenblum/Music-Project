In another time
When the light didn't blind my eyes
I would've killed just to fall asleep
No god beyond these clouds
No feet upon this ground
The desolate king I'm crowned

Take me back to the life that left me
This time I guarantee
I'll have everything that escaped me
A new identity
Introduce you to the real me

This world of mine is pulling me under
This genocide has forgotten me
I can't last without the ones that left me
I regret the times I couldn't see

With your eyes locked dead on mine
And your heart open wide
You exhaled just one last time:
"Don't go, just take me with you"
I can't bare to see the blood on your dress
Don't leave me alone in this mess
So many things that I should've confessed
I'm lost inside

This world of mine is pulling me under
This genocide has forgotten me
I can't last without the ones that left me
I regret the times I couldn't see
(I'm lost inside)
This world of mine is pulling me under
This genocide has forgotten me
I can't last without the ones that left me
I regret the times I couldn't see

Introduce you to the real me
