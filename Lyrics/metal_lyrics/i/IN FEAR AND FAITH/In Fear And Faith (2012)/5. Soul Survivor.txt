I'm the only one, I'm the only one
To ever lay a hand upon this soil
I wander through what I once called home

When all the time you have abandons you,
You'll think about the past and wish that you could see straight through
All the bullshit that you dealt with along the way
And live your life like you wanted to.
Live your life, live your life like you wanted!

Ages away from, ages away from companion, I sit and stare
I sit and stare at pieces of my past (pieces of my past)
I've been wandering aimlessly
As the sun beats down on no one else but me
All alone on this earth
Trying to find a way to quench my thirst
My days are numbered and I can't begin
To count the ways I have sinned

When all the time you have abandons you
You'll think about the past and wish that you could see straight through
All the bullshit that you dealt with along the way
And live your life like you wanted to, oh like you wanted to

When all the time you have abandons you
You'll think about the past and wish that you could see straight through
All the bullshit that you had to deal with while you were on your way
While you were on your way

Why do I deserve a second chance?
Am I lucky or inhuman? Am I sane or am I mad?
I'm the only one who gets a chance
A chance to live on
âCause I can breathe without my mask

When all the time you have, abandons you
You'll think about the past, and wish that you could travel back
To the times when you should've realized
You were hiding behind apprehension

Why do I deserve a second chance?
And we can't breath without our masks
