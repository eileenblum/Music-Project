Please don't betray me I'm down on my knees.
You can't turn around and walk away.
Let me die another day.
I've come too far, to let this all end.
You needed to know, you need to know.
We'll never change.

And for a voice that never speaks, I hear you so well
This is a sign to lock your doors!
Fall through the cracks, you'll fall through the floor.
And maybe you'll start to regret this more.
And I'll never change, I swear!
And for a voice that never speaks, I hear you so well
This is a sign to lock your doors!
You fear the unknown.
I fear you're unknown.
Silence is screaming your name and you say, you say you're not at war!
You fear the unknown.
I fear you're alone
I fear you're alone!
And for a voice that never speaks, I hear you so well
This is a sign to lock your doors!
