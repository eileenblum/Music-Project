Fire the cannons to starboard side
We'll take their ship and we'll sink them fast
Take everything that your heart desires
We'll never die
All hands on deck men this is it. 
So bring the blood and shoot to kill,
cause it's a Pirates Life For Me!
So raise up the flag, no chance for surrender tonight.
Pirates Life For Me!

These seven sea's we've turned them black
with the blood from our hearts.
We've come to fight, we'll take your life!
Sail into the setting Sun, the chase is on.
We have her in our sights, in our sights!
We'll take everything, we'll kill everyone
Yo Ho, Pirates Life For Me
