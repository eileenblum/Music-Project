Now we're back with a bang.
With a new mate to add to the gang.
We took their ship and sunk them fast.
But that war is in the past.
And now the time has come.
To show them exactly what we've become.
Because we are the ones who stand strong.
And choose not to run.

Lets forge our names. We do this everyday.
We make our own way. And take what you can't give.
All that we've done before, is in the past.
This is what we've become so come now.

Well I'm three sheets to the wind, and my world is spinning. 
We take what we need and we get what we want.
What's yours is mine if you like it or not.
You better hide your daughters because we're on our way home.
So much to gain and nothing to lose.
This life is ours but we'll take yours too.
Map of the world, take us far from here.
We're coming home and no one can stop us.
Map of the world take me home.

Pirate's life for me.
Pirate's life for me.

Well I'm three sheets to the wind and my world is spinning.
We take what we need and we get what we want.
What's yours is mine if you like it or not.
You better hide your daughters .
Because we're on our way home.
So much to gain and nothing to lose.
This life is ours but we'll take yours too.
Yo ho pirates life for me.
I'll find wealth in the things I gain.
And you will find that you've lost your way.
Yo ho pirates life for me.
