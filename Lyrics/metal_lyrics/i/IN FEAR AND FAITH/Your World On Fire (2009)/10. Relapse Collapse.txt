Bring back hollow reputations.
It's giving me what I desire.
And I desire to find the words you need to hear.

Kill. Kill. Kill. Your demons.
Face. Face. Face. Your fears.
Fight. Fight. With no discretion. 
Die. Die. Die. Alone.

I am the messenger; I am the one you trust with your last breath.
And you're missing the point.
You're missing the point of these words.
You've caused the blood that's on your hands.

I hope you see your own life flash before your eyes.
And find that point, in your life when you realize.
That there's something that you've lost.
And something went terribly wrong.
With your last breath, until your lungs collapse.

I am the messenger; I am the one you trust with your last breath.
And I'm betting you'll find, I'm betting you'll find a way to.

Why aren't you trying to escape?
You say you need a great purpose
I say you need to see what's coming
