Stay close, the flames are closing in.
Breathe deep, the smoke is on its way.
Look west, the ocean is calling.
Follow. The air that still remains.
Oh, Can you feel it, the fire is burning.
Oh, can you taste it. the smoke in the air...
That fills up your lungs.

Our world is burning. We're all caught in the flames.
These walls are coming down. this is our time.
I feel the heat is rising. Do you feel the burn?
I watched your body turn to ashes, and get carried away.

I have seen the ashes of the undead. It pulls me in.
I will be the last to retreat.
And it will be consuming you.

I know it seems like forever.
Until you let the ashes overcome your spirit.
And I know about you.
The seasons will fade to grey, you won't be saved.

You don't need a knife to cut to my heart.
This is our last chance to fall apart.
You don't need a flame, to die from the burn
Because....
You already know you're a goner.

Stay close, the flames are coming in.
Breathe deep, the smoke is on its way.
Look west, the ocean is calling.
Follow the air. The air that still remains.
