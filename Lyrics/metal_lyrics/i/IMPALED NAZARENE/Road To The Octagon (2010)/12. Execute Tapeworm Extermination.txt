Up until now
You lot have been leaching around
This will change

You demand civil wage
You have no will to work at all
Death camp awaits

For you meat is murder
But we all are born carnivores
Accept the facts

Mommy wakes you up at night
So you can roll joints at certain time
Just fucking die

Execute tapeworm extermination

Up until now
We have kept our mouths shut
This will change

We shall shave off your dreads
And then we put you to death
Agonizingly

Execute tapeworm extermination

Save the planet, get rid of the scum
Public hangings, the Octagon approved

Save the planet, death to the scum
And we can live happily ever after
