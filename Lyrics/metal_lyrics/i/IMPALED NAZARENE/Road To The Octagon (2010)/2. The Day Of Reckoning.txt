I woke up this morning
Happily realized
The day of reckoning
Had finally arrived
Took out my sharpest knife
Went on a killing spree
Made sure I act according to
The Master's will

Under Lucifer's command we march
Under Lucifer's command we kill

Pitch black skies
Vomiting nuclear waste
On deserving humanity

Under Lucifer's command we march
Under Lucifer's command we kill
Satan is coming after you!
