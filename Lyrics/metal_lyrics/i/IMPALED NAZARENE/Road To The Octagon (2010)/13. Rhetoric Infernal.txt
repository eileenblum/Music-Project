Satan, hear the call of your humble servant
Satan, accept my blood-soaked offering
Satan, father, let me ride the black wings of doom

And all will be fine
That is what they told me
Everything will be fine

Satan, answer my abyssic warcry
Satan, see I skin myself to honour you
Satan, give me 1000 year reign of hell
Satan, to thee I bow, Lucifer

And all will be fine
That is what they told me
Everything will be fine

Seriously, just fine
Everything will be alright
They told me so

And I do believe
I believe the things they said
Because I do believe
I believe in Satan
