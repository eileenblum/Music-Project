Stop press it is killing time
Time to get juicy headlines
It gives you reason to moralize
It was God's will

They are sons of the North Star
Pushed too far
And they made their point
With hollow points
Now nation fears
Don't know what to do
Looking for scapegoats

Rational thinking, what the fuck
This is mass hysteria
While some of us just await
For the lynch-mob to arrive

They are sons of the North Star
Pushed too far
And they made their point
With hollow points
Now nation fears
Don't know what to do
Looking for scapegoats
Guess who

Murder â bloodlust

They are sons of the North Star
Pushed too far
And they made their point
With hollow points
Now nation fears
Don't know what to do
Looking for scapegoats
Frack you!!!!
