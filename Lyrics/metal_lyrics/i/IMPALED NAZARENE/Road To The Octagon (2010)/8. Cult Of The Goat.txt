Golden walls of heaven are burning down
The final cleansing has begun
We torch down everything holy
Torment those who chose the wrong faith

If you are a bastard servant of god
You deserve nothing but slow death
We shall drown you in goat vomit
Wrap your corpse in barbed wire

Regie satanas â cult of the goat
Ave Lucifer â cult of the goat

Faith changes into total disbelief
As you find your daughters corpses
Little girls hanged on street lights
The sign of the Octagon to come

And behold the King of Thieves enters
The one who shall rule the Earth
Comes forth a new satanic age
For the golden walls of heaven burnt down

Regie satanas â cult of the goat
Ave Lucifer â cult of the goat
