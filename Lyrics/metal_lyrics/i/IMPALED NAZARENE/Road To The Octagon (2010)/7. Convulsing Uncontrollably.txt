Tonight we are going to burn in hell
For there will be no limits
We will take everything you have got
We are totally unstoppable

Drinks are flying and bitches are crying
As all hell breaks loose
One more line and things will be fine
And then we will take over the world

Fuck the world and fuck you too
Convulsing uncontrollably
And you cunts don't fucking get it
That we are here to rule fucking forever

Tomorrow we are going to burn in hell
For all the things we have done
There are no fucking regrets
Cause we don't remember a single thing

We just lick our war wounds
And carry on pandemonium
Proceed to the next town
Moaning and groaning never stops

Fuck the world and fuck you too
Convulsing uncontrollably
And you cunts don't fucking get it
That we are here to rule fucking forever
