The road to the Octagon is paved with corpses
Nobody escapes the wrath of the Octagon

Eight sharp blades penetrate your brain
Eight tentacles suck out the brain juice
Eight silver strings cut you into pieces
Return to the kingdom that is the Octagon

Infernal â majestic
Perverse â corrupt

Eight deadly strikes of lightning
Eight burned and raped goat offerings
Eight fangs sucking blood out of every hole
Return to the kingdom that is the Octagon

Infernal â majestic
Perverse â corrupt

In the name of suffering
Bow down to the Octagon

In the name of His majesty
Bow down to the Octagon

In the name of the Octagon
We hail His majesty

Under the sign of the Octagon
We hail His majesty
