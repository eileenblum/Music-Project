I remember the time
When all golden turned to shit
And I started to doubt about existence
And I remember the blood when razor hit my wrist
I remember the time
When all golden turned to shit
And I started to question your existence
And I remember your screams as I took out my blade
To test my theory about your fucking existence
And to proof that most of you are better off dead
Indeed!
