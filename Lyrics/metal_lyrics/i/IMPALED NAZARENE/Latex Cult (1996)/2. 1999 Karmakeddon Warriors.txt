Faster than speed of light
We rise from the grave
To steal your souls
To exterminate
We are satan's soldiers
Invisible force
We will spread the plague
We are full of hate
Karmakeddon warriors
Possessed soldiers
We are back from the grave
It's a doomsday
Thousands of dead bodies
Lay slaughtered on the ground
Karmakeddon warriors deliver satan's wrath
Our master is laughing as angels start to die
Bodies are impaled
God keeps crying
Karmakeddon warriors
Possessed soldiers
We are back from the grave
It's a doomsday
This is the armageddon
The final judgement day
God's children slayed
Victory is satan's today
1999 will show the truth
Satan is the master
Satan is the lord
Karmakeddon warriors
Possessed soldiers
We are back from the grave
1999 will remain in the history the year
Whole mankind had to face satan's hate!
