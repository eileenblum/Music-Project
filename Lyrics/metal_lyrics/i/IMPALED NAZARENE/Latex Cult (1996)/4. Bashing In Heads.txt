Bashing in heads
Make it some survive
Burning mankind
On the purging of soul

Bashing in heads
Make us all as dead
Never die
Living like a god

Bashing in heads
Going own way
Never die
Burning like a Hell

In the name of rot does what torn

Washing your blood
From my hands
Turned to die
It's time to dead forever
