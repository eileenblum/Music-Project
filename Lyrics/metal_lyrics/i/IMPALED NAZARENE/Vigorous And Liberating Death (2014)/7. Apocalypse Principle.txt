Winds of war are blowing cold
The hour of judgement draws near
With diabolic spells and armed to the teeth
We kill everything on our way
Torching the lands where holy men walk
Nothing but ashes will be left
Souls are screaming in agony
In eternal hell they burn

Apocalypse principle

Lords of war unleash the wolves
Sharp claws maul your throats
Relentless attack by Satan's hounds
Sadistic rites till death
Possessed by burning hellfire
We spread our hate without mercy
Satan shall rule the world again
Just like it has been written

Apocalypse principle

Satan's cross points to Hell forever!!!

Apocalypse principle
