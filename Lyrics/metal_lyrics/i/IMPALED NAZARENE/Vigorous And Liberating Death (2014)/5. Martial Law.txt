The powers that be have failed totally
They refuse to take hard action
Existing laws full of loopholes
This country has sunk deep

We will declare martial law
Reinstate death penalty
Appointment with the gallows
At the Senate Square

Capital punishment for treason
End of their reign of terror
One by one you will be hanged
In televised spectacle

We will declare martial law
Reinstate death penalty
Appointment with the gallows
At the Senate Square

We have declared martial law
No crime goes unpunished
Appointment with the gallows
For green is the new red
You can run, you can hide
Death squads will find you
Appointment with the gallows
At the Senate Square
