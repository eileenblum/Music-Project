Fere libenter homines id quod volunt credunt

Sacred flame lights the temple
They gather to satisfy gods
Illusions and perversions
And thirst for human blood

Vestal virgins
Virgin sacrifice

Sacred blood flows in the temple
Mortal goddess must die
For gods are bloodthirsty
Her hymen must be intact

Vestal virgins
Virgin sacrifice

Purification through blood
Bloodshed rituals
Purified through blood
Cosmic catharses

Vestal virgins
Virgin sacrifice

Blood washes away their sins
Mors vincit omnia!!!
