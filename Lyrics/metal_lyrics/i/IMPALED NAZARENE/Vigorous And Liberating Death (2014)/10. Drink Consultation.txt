Things will be done my way
A single fuck will be given
Accomplishments and aftershocks
This is all about consumption

I raise my goat brews and bottles of Jack
To honour the living among the dead
To those who know how to party like hell

I Raise my glasses of vodka and gin
To those who know how to bath in sin
To all children of the underworld

Disasters and mental mudslides
Superhuman blazing mindfuck

Drink consultation gone wrong
What the fuck have I done
My feet are bleeding I am in pain
Walls are covered with red wine
Pates and glasses are all smashed
Broken glass is everywhere
Just to think what it takes
To clean this mess I'd rather drink again

I raise my goat brews and bottles of Jack
To forget my own stupidness
To sweep away this catastrophe

I raise my glasses of vodka and gin
I am back on the track once again
I am superhuman, now fuck off !
