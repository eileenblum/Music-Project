I need no reasons to let off steam
Yet I have my reasons for every kill
Blunt force trauma, multiple stab wounds
A bullet in the chest and four into the head

Concrete boots and electroshocks
I use zip ties and meat hooks
Coat hanger abortions, thou shalt not breed
Smashed skulls and carved skin

Pathological hunger for
Murder, pain and torture
Enter the realm of death

Pathological hunger for
Rape, hate and violence
Enter the realm of death
