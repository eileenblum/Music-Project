I am the dark shadow their fear
The terror in their innocent eyes
I am the reek of overpowering death
The nauseating stench of rotten
I am the chilling shriek they hear
The reason why they tear off ears
I am the mirror to your soul
I am why you blind your eyes

Vigorous
Vicious
Vile

I am the bringer of black plague
The horror in darkened skies
I am why vermins crawl
Why pitch black oceans storm
I am the reason behind rotten harvest
Why earth grows no more food
You are the reason why I am here
I am hate, revenge and death

Vigorous
Venomous
Violent

Vigorous
Liberating
Entertaining
Death
