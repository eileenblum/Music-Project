Castrate the man so he cannot breed
So he cannot spread his semen
Stone the man so he cannot stand
So he cannot defend his belongings

With sadistic pressure we crush and destroy
We burn everything to the ground

And the legacy of the weeping man
Engulfs in the sea of flames

Burning hatred and the flames of hate
Light the eternal darkness
Everybody and everything are ready
For the return of the king

Flood the lands of the nonbelievers
We watch their children drown
Bottomless sea swallow sanctuaries
False idols swept away

With sadistic pleasure we kill and rape
Perfecting the apocalypse

And the legacy of the dying man
Is wholly rewritten

Burning hatred and the flames of hate
Light the eternal darkness
Everybody and everything are ready
For the return of the king

At the seventh layer of hell
Thru the magick and human sacrifice
At the seventh layer of hell
Rebirth of the king

Burning hatred and the flames of hate
Light the eternal darkness
Everybody and everything are ready
For the return of the king

At the seventh layer of hell
We hail the goat king reborn
At the seventh layer of hell
We celebrate the goat king reborn

And so the world burns!
