Burning the brutal, brutal out of the game
Bleeding in fire that releases part of my brain
I akth a sakhn, i a sakth the flame
As you die for Satan, Necronomicon, the burning gates

[chorus:]
Sadogoat-masogoat [x3]

Burning the victims, victims of over-throne
Killing the fire, inside, outside of the door
Satan wants you, believe in fire &amp; flame
Killing the brutal, brutal inside my brain

[repeat chorus (x3)]

The goat is about to reign
As they will eat your brains
The victims of infernal war,
Burning witches...arrgh !

Burning the fire,
Inside, outside of my brain
Killing the goat,
That lives inside my brain
Goatic reign,
Will you confess at first sigh
Satan's whore, Lucifer be my guide

[repeat chorus (x3)]
