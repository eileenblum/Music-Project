[The Outlaws cover]

An old dark whore went on riding on a windy day
As she moved on there were bodies on her way
Satan's whore, then you die, then you are going to die
Have you seen the crucified, prepare to fucking die

[chorus:]
Jippijae, jee, jippijae joo...ghost riders in the sky

Will your fear grow as you are going to bleed ?
Burning hour at my souls as you are going to bleed
Thru the night of consciousness, beloved Satan's whore
As you keep rotting in hell, Lucifer my whore

[repeat chorus]

Burning victims of the vault, will you want to see ?
Burning victims of the vault, for fucking god you bleed
Witch bleed on the fire then you are going to die
Demigod at my side, praying for fucking fire

[repeat chorus (x2)]
