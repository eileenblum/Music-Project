Wrath!
Cannot understand what's going on
He tells me to kill, to slay them all
To make them suffer, to make them die
The mask now controls, my weak mind

[chorus:]
Now I know it is a bit too late
Morbid fate - die in pain
Nobody helps me, cannot escape
Morbid fate, die in... pain !

[verse I:]
I - I am your master
I - I am your king
I - I rule your
mind - you belong to me

Rape that bitch, make her bleed
Kill her child, suffocate him
Shoot that fucker, rip his flesh
Tear his genitals, kick his head

[repeat chorus]

[verse II]
He - he is my master
He - he is my king
He - he rules my
mind - I am him !!!

Pain !!!
I wear it now, feel my hate
I cut your throat, I exterminate
I am morbid, I am insane
I eat excrements, feel my fucking... blade

[repeat chorus]

[repeat verse I]

Face your morbid fate, hohohoo... arrgghhh !!!
