In the name of Satan I curse your rotten souls
Cursed are the feeble for they shall be blotted out

[chorus:]
In nomine dei nostri Satans (Luciferi) excelsi

In the name of Satan I curse your rotten souls
Cursed are the feeble for they shall be blotted out
Satan represents vengeance for S.P. is the highest law!

[repeat chorus]
