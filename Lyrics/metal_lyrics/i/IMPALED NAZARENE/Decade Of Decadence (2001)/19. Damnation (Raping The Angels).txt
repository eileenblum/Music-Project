When Jews return to Zion and fire burn the skies,
(Then) satanic majesty rises
And both you and I must die !

From the eternal sea he rises
Creating armies on either shore
Turning man against his brother
Till man exists no more !

Thirteen steps, the ritual
Black, candles, face the altar
Prince of hell, take my soul
Give me the wisdom, of the ancient ghouls

Sodomize the holy flesh, follow the left hand path
Torment the holy trinity, feeble christianity !

Invocation, to my lord
Shemhamforash, drink the blood
Hear the names, so infernal
Baphomet, I kneel before the altar

Righteous flesh, turns me on
Desecration, of bastard's mom
I will turn your holy womb
Into disgusting, unholy tomb

Sodomized is the holy flesh, so it done
The thirteen steps

There is no more Zion (yet) fire burning the skies
Satanic majesty has risen and we all are dead...die...
I was homosexual partner of Jesus Christ

[repeat]
