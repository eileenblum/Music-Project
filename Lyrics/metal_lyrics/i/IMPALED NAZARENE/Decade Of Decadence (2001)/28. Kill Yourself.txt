[Originally performed by S.O.D.]

Can't take it, never could
Time to end it, wish you would
Friends and family, their all gone
Life for you is just a con
Dig yourself a hole in the ground
Push up daisies six feet down
Take a dirt nap, buy the farm
Inject a bubble in your arm

KILL YOURSELF, KILL YOURSELF
Why dont you kill yourself
Don't rely on no one else,
End it all, just kill yourself
KILL YOURSELF, KILL YOURSELF
Why dont you kill yourself
Don't rely on no one else,
End it all, just kill yourself
Now

Life is just a one way ticket
Everyone must go around
Here's a bucket, go and kick it
Slit your wrists without a sound
When you go dont make a big deal
No dramatics, dont overplay
Cause don't you know that we'll all feel
Better once you've gone away

KILL YOURSELF, KILL YOURSELF
Why dont you kill yourself
Don't rely on no one else,
End it all, just kill yourself
KILL YOURSELF, KILL YOURSELF
Why dont you kill yourself
Don't rely on no one else,
End it all, just kill yourself
Now

You're a loser, at everything you do.
A worthless loser, there's nothing left for you

KILL YOURSELF NOW!
