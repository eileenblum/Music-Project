Bastard son didn't win
I summon to thee to come to me
To find the peace, harmony
Infernal, agony

Mayhemic devastation, unholy benediction
Controlled by his majesty
You'll suffer, eternally

Do you believe in agony ?
Only pain is...real!

"ÃÃ¤liÃ¶t, ylistÃ¤kÃ¤Ã¤ saatanaa,
sillÃ¤ ainoastaan saatana on todellista !!!"

Bestial majesty rules the universe
Burning flames, holocaust
Charred souls, no return!!!

Spiritual prophecies turned into total shit
Messiah now vomitting as I masturbate on him

Do you believe in agony ?
Only pain is real!

Damned to fucking hell!!!
