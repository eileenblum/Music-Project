Reaping the holy from their misery...forever
Harvest of hell believers weep

Total destruction of whore mankind...perish
Sign of the times hellbound unity

Strike of higher force of evil ... Satan
Dark dimension meltdown force

Invaded by pain no saving grace ... repent
Flame rapture burning flesh

It's the twilight of the cunts
Salvation by fire and brimstone

Blood of the holy will flow...weaklings
Heading for the infernal throne

Time has come for the attack...attack
Rape their holy souls

It's the highlight of their lives
Swallowed by lakes of burning fire

It's the twilight of the cunts
The weaklings awaited their saviour
But then the plague swept the lands
Their fate was sealed by an iron hand
Their prayers were left unanswered
Eternally their souls burn

All hail Satan!!!
