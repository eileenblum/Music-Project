See it with your own eyes if you don't believe me
Come on, just one cut and angel rectums do bleed
Taste it with your own tongue, now that's real blood
Slip your finger inside and hear the weep of God

[cho:] Thundering damnation
Hellfire salvation
Redeeming abomination
Masturbating till death

Feel it with your own finger if you don't believe me
Hard as stone, golden rectum yet red blood it bleeds
Slice it open, open wide and find about the reek of heaven
Throw away your inhibitions, smear the shit with devil's semen

[repeat chorus]

Rub it with your own penis if you don't believe me
Golden walls of angel rectum feel like pure goat skin
Now that you have been liberated, baptized in angel's blood
It's time to move on, next stop is God's cunt

[repeat chorus]
