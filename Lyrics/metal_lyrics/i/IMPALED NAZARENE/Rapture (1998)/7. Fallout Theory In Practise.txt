Silver lights burning eyes
Ultraviolent hellish cries
Deep red flashes blistering skies

Fallout theory in practise
The great mushroom never lies

Roaring thunder cracking earth
Delightful decay crawl in dirt

Mankind radiated
Finally annihilated
Darkness is what remains

Fallout theory in practise
The grand mushroom my rebirth

Obey the mushroom warlock of hell

Mankind annihilated
Finally radiated
Blackness is what prevails
