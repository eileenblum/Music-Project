We are Satan's generation and we don't give a fuck
Virtues, values and innocence all long dead and gone

[cho:] Infernal blood runs in our veins
Alcohol and drugs is what we need and take
We need no stupid fucking conscience
Go get fucked if you are not one of the bestial ones

We are Satan's generation and we don't give a fuck
We shit on you, on your stupid God and on his bastard son

[repeat chorus]

We are Satan's generation and you will give a fuck
For soon we will take over and kill all you scum

[repeat chorus]

[Music &amp; Lyrix: Luttinen]
