First degree, one simple step, just burn your skin with a cigarette
For the second degree, take a knife, slowly slice and let it bleed
And for the third degree, drink your urine, 
let the sour taste fill your stomach

[cho:] Screaming for the living
Screaming for the dead
Together we go thru
This acid trip from hell
Fucking with your body
Fucking with your mind
Total devastation
Time to fuck off and die

Fourth degree, eat your shit, keep it in, dare not to vomit
For the fifth degree, open up your mind, see those burning pentagrams now shine
And for the sixth degree, get your gun, let's go hunting the scumfucks

[repeat chorus]

This is what I want, this what I need
This is why I go thru all the six degrees
This is what I want, this is what I Need
I lost my soul ages ago, hell's my sanctuary
Mindfuck!!!
