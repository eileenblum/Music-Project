You fucking inbred shit, you make me so sick
I'll teach you a lesson you will never  forget

I'll hunt you down, you faggot fucking whore
Smash your fucking skull and laugh when I am done

Cursed be the day when you were born
You should have been aborted now that's for sure

And one more thing, this is what I think
Whatever you are involved in is nothing but pure shit

Say just one more word and here comes my fist
It rips that faggot face apart you fucking inbred shit

And I won't rest before you are dead
And maggots are consuming your oversized head

Die you fuck, drop fucking dead
I am glad to help you, you fucking piece of inbred shit

Even if I would be caught I couldn't care less
'cause long time ago I stopped caring

My hate is fuelling my inner burning fire
And to end your life, now that's my desire

I just hope you have guts to fight
For I am happy as hell to end your fucking shitty life
