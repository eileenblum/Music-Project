This is the action counter reaction
To all things dead, crawling dead
This is the counter action reaction
To all living things who should be dead

Burn their bodies, parasites
Fuck their minds, genocide

This is the tired old story of shit
About things, all of them braindead
This is renewal, perhaps a better end?
About shit that ended up digested

Burn their minds, parasites
Genocide of one of a kind
Now that we are spilling blood
Ignorants cry for God
Now that we are raping their souls
Innocents cry for more
Thus we finally came this far
Got what you prayed for
Useless fucking digested shit
Turn around and suck this:
Iron fist with an iron will

[Music &amp; Lyrix: Luttinen]
