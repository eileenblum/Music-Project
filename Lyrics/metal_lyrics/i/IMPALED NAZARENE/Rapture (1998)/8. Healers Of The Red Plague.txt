As the new millenium closes in
Take a look what's going on
Carriers of the plague on earth's every corner
The disease is spreading again
I remember the better times
Once the plague was destroyed
Now this disease is everywhere
Action is needed in order to survive
It is time to start fighting back
Or we all end up like them
Back in the days of Vietnam
The cure was called napalm

Che Guevara wept!

[cho:] Healers of the red plague
We are heading for the new world order
Where no plague stands a change
Forcefed disease for subhumans
All healed once we strike back
Back in the days of Vietnam
The cure was called napalm

Che Guevara dead!

[repeat chorus]
