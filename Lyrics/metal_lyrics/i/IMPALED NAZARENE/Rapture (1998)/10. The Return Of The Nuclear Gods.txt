Nuclear armageddon attack
Phallic deadly missiles
Warheads ready to strike
Bloodred nuclear skies

Burning horizons
Chaos all around
Skies open you realize
Time has come to fuck off and die

Burning horizons
Chaos all around
Skies open you realize
Time has finally come for:
It's the return of the nuclear Gods
A fist in your face in a megaton size
It's the wrath of the nuclear Gods
MUshroom clouds over bloodred skies

Nuclear killer fallout
Agony, misery and pain
Pay the price of idiocy
Nuclear the only way

Burning horizons
Chaos all around
Skies open you realize
Time has finally come for:
It's the return of the nuclear Gods
A fist in your face in a megaton size
It's the wrath of the nuclear Gods
Mushroom clouds over bloodred skies
Feel the hate of the nuclear Gods
You pieces of shit drop like flies
Feel the power of the nuclear Gods
Weeping fucks just fucking die
It's the return of the nuclear Gods
A fist in your face in a megaton size
It's the wrath of the nuclear Gods
Mushroom clouds over bloodred skies
