Your life sucks so much it is not even true
You have fucked up everything you had
Face the consequence of your mistakes

You have smoked yourself into a blackhole

Walls close in you see only darkness
Veins are bursting you cannot breath anymore
Reality strikes you know the solution

You have smoked yourself into a blackhole

So sing along to the suicide song
Blow up your brain do it today
So sing along to the suicide song
Hang yourself high be a man for once
Give up hope for there is no hope
All dead and gone just give it up
Your life is miserable cul-de-sac
There is a way out sing the suicide song

You have smoked yourself into a blackhole

So sing along to the suicide song
Blow up your brains O.D. today
So sing along to the suicide song
Goodbye cruel world smileys and razorblades
