You open your mouth and nothing comes out
You are the idealist loser
You wanna save the earth - you protest and riot
You are the pain in the ass
Your doctrine is old - your beliefs fundamental
You are the festering wound
You live in the past - you oppose progress
You have no right live

When violence commands the day

This is our warcry straight from hell
Now ultra-violence commands the day
Bonded by metal - we will never give in

You open your mouth and blood pours out
You die in the hail of bullets
Your sorry existence meets violent end
Because you are worth it

This is our warcry straight from hell
Now ultra-violence commands the day
Bonded by metal - we will never give in
