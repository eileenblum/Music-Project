Grey concrete swallow and destroys everything
That ever had any value for human beings
Slaves are paying the way for the new overlords
Them who have come to conquer the world
Decaying corpses and vultures in the sky
Hail the masters of the nuclear universe

Fear and loathing on planet Nazarene

Black blood flows and infects everything
Rotting from inside out as helpless die
Iron fist breaks the jaws of the rotten kind
Order must be kept at any price

Succulent little holes little wicked eyes
This treatment will mark you for life
Paranoia and self-hatred feels like reborn
Such are the facts under a concrete layer

Fear and loathing on planet Nazarene
