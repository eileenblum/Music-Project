Insanity
Reigns supreme
Among the children
Of hammer and sickle

Riddle the cattle
Get rid of the cattle
Swing of the axe
Pinko heads will roll

Goat justice will be done

Flower and flourheads
Chasing the ghosts
Did not learn anything
From their own past

Riddle the cattle
Get rid of the cattle
Swing of the axe
Pinko heads will roll
Punishment is due
Absolute punishment
Majestic goat justice
Crushes opponents

Like a bloodsucking fleas
You will be terminated

Iron justice is goat justice
