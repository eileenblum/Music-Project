Backbone of our scene
Kings of true morality
They know what is wrong
Tell you what you can listen to
Standing ovation
For our moral saviours
Pathos in its worst form
Isn't it time to quit
Must be hard to do your job
What bratwurst chokes you
Too tight lederhosen
Sauerkraut blues
Standing ovation
For our moral saviours
Pathos in its worst form
Isn't it time to quit
You don't fucking rock hard
Because you fucking are
You are so fucking happy it hurts
Suck hard
Debil and unstabil
Scheisse brains in control
Message here is loud and clear
You can fucking fuck off
You don't rock hard
You never did
