Nuclear waste lands - impending death
Dwell in agony - burnt to a crisp
Skin peels off - vomiting blood
1000 red suns - mushrooms clouds

Dead return to walk on earth
Dead return to haunt dreams

Nuclear winter - pure desolation
Cancer and muscarriage - feast on fetus
Last dark hours - of humanity
Once so strong - now defiled

Man turned into jackal - man became the beast
Man destroyed man - yet man believed
Man conjured something - man couldn't handle
Now man regrets - it is all too late

Dead return - dead return on earth
Dead return - dead return from hell
