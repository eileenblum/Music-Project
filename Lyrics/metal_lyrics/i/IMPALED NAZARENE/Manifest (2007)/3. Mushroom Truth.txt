Head weighs a ton and it grows
White clouds turn into scorpions
Wind power plants multiply
Their steel frames bending down
Ground splits up and spirals
Better stay on the safe side

At the edge of the universe
Red stars fly from the pit
At the edge of the universe
Spaceships and demons
Mushroom ruth

Universal fishing net
Protects from the lurking skull
Grass was once so green
Now it is growing dead chicken
Stones turn into dead rats
Better stay on the safe side

At the edge of the universe
Red stars fly from the pit
At the edge of the universe
Spaceships and demons
Mushroom truth

Sinister things come and go
Launching pad is so large
Ride like a wind oh sweet freedom
Please Satan don't let this end

At the edge of the universe
Red stars fly from the pit
At the edge of the universe
Spaceships and demons
Mushroom truth

Burn we burn let the motherfucker burn
We are burning in hell we burn
We are burning
Never felt so alive
Fuck off and die
