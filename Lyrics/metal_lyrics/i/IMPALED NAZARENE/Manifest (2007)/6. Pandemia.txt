Can you hear the sound of the death bells
This is the sad old reality
Forget your freedom - forget liberty
Can you feel the salty taste in your mouth
Deaf and blind and mute society
Catholic pandemia - porco dio
Holy semen stains the faces of altar boys
God has a sugartooth for young flesh
Forget your freedom - forgive existence
