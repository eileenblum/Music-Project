Punish me, for I have sinned
Punish me, for my existence

[chorus:]
Heart built of stone yet in need of love,
Built of stone in need of love

Punish me, for I have sinned
Punish me, for my existence

[repeat chorus]

Punish me, for I have sinned
Punish me, for my existence

[repeat chorus]

Haistakaa vittu, haistakaa vittu

Haistakaa vitun vittu, haistakaa se vittu,
Saatanan homot, haistakaa se vittu !
