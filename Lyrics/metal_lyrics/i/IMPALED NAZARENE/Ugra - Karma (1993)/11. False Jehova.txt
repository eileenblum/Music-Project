Urgh !

Centuries ago,
Born of whore,
Jesus Christ,
Filthy homo,
Crucified fuck,
Millions follow,
Blinded mind,
Minds !

[chorus:]

False Jehova, you will obey me,
I am your mighty lord, you will kneel before me !

I am Antichrist, poor bastard dies
As I take your life, see the burning skies
From hell I arise, by fire I rule,
Torment is the game, Antichrist my name, name !

[chorus:]
False Jehova, will you marry me ?
I am Antichrist, your new wife to be...

Urgh ! Urgh ! Urgh ! Urgh !
