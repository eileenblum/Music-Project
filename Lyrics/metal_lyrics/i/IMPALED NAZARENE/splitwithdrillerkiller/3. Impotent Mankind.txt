Humanity
What a failure it has been
Last two thousand years
Still climbing in trees
Nothing has changed
Nothing will

Weakling breeds weaklings
Never ending cycle
Pseudo generations
Half functioning
What a disgrace
Nine fingers and half the brain

Impotent mankind

Humanity
What a failure it has been
There is no evolution
Like a dog chasing its tail
Weakling degeneration
We are fucked

Weakling breeds weaklings
Never ending cycle
Pseudo generations
Half functioning
What a disgrace
Nine fingers and half the brain

Impotent mankind
