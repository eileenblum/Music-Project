Here comes torment and pain
Here comes death and decay
Even more pain
Here is the final solution
Here is the end of the rope
Even more pain

This is the deadend of my life
Oppressed by myself

Nothing to see, nothing to do
Nothing to hear, complete zero
Life is sickening, nothing but pain
Mental breakdown, even more pain

Here comes torment and pain
Here comes death and decay
Even more pain
Here is the final solution
Here is the end of the rope
Even more pain

I stare at walls, they are closing in
Nothing has changed nor it will
Fuck this shit, fuck you all
As a scok and fucklot, I fuck you all
