I am the fly on the wall
I know about you
Your secrets are mine
I am the thorn in your side

Hurting you will be so easy
I shall strike your weakest points

I am the utter darkness
That fills your soul
I am your worst nightmare
I am the bringer of doom

Either you have children or pets
These are the easiest targets
I shall mutilate your bastard children
Send their little toes to you as gifts
I shall poison your two dogs
And laugh as you drown in sorrow

This is for all the funerals to come
For there will be many
This is for all the graves you dig
For there will be many
This is for all the grief you go thru
For it will be endless
This last bullet is reserved for you
That's what makes this perfect

All that you fear - I am all that you fear!
All that you fear - I am all that you fear!
