Welcome to your Hell
Where all fears are reality
Paranoia strikes hard
Harder, beyond your wildest dreams

Halo of Flies Over my Head
I am decaying Satan's Wrath
The to walk planet earth alone
Spreading disease, death and war

Schizobound of total hell
Spitting forth hate of Satan's Reich
Alone on this infernal task
To plague this world with Satan's Sluts' blood

Halo of Flies Over My Head
I am decaying Satan's Wrath
The one to walk planet earth alone
Spreading disease, death and war

Halo of Death over your Heads
Total Doom Satan's Wrath
The Command of the Apocalypse
As Hell shall reign this earth
