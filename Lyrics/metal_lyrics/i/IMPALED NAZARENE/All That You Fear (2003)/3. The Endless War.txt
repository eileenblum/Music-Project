They are breeding like rats
Those disease ridden cockroaches
Two thousand years of parasites
This means total war, we will fight till death!

Behold! For this is the end
Of two thousand years of leeches!

We shall wipe them out for good
End the marriage of church and state
We shall use whatever it takes
Use tactics never seen before
We shall attack their weak points
We shall sneak from behind
We shall divide and cause chaos
And then we will blow the final strike

War! We are fighting, fighting the endless
Fight! We are fighting, fighting the endless
War! We are fighting, fighting the endless
Strike! We are fighting, fighting till death!!

Behold! For this is the end
of two thousand years of leeches!

When our country is purified
No more mind fucking parasites
By now the message should be clear
We are ready to die for our infernal cause

War! We are fighting, fighting the endless
Fight! We are fighting, fighting the endless
War! We are fighting, fighting the endless
Strike! We are fighting, fighting till death!!
