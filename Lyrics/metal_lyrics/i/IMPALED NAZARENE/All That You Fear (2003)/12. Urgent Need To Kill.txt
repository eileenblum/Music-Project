I am sickened by sub-humans
The twats i see everyday
Pathetic fucking lowlives
Living their meaningless lives
Hatred grows only stronger
As these years are passing by

I am the ticking timebomb
Ready to explode
I have the list of sub-humans
That i want to kill
Urgent Need to Kill

So far I have managed to control
My sadistic need to kill
I have reached the breaking point
Weakling blood must be shed

I am the fucking timebomb
Ready to explode
I have the list of sub-humans
That i want to kill

With An Iron Fist I Shall Rule this World
Thr world where only the strong survive
No more weakling sub-humans
No more sunshine or happy times
Only The Strong Law Of The Beast

I am the ticking timebomb
Ready to explode
I have the list of sub-humans
That i want to kill

And you are on my list
There is no escape
Feel the fear take over
Cold sweat that chokes
I shall destroy you
Time to meet your fate!
