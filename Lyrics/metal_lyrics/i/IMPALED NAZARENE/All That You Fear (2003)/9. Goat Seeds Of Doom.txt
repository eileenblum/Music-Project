Manna rains from hell as you revel in smut
Visions of the new world order
Finally coming true

We shall dominate, take over your lives
Going to make your life living hell
And you never saw it coming

Shit stained faces screaming in agony
Paralyzed by fear yet understanding

We shall dominate, none shall survive
Going to set the world in flames
And laugh all the way thru

Swallow the goat seeds of doom
Take my hand and watch this world burn
Rejoice for it is the end of everything
The end of the world as we know it

Sweet is the sound of horror
As harsh reality hits you
All of this has been in vain,
Swallow the facts you cunt

We shall dominate, we shall destroy
As Cries of help are fading away
We shall begin from the start

Swallow the goat seeds of doom
Take my hand and watch this world burn
Rejoice for it is the end of everything
The end of the world as we know it
