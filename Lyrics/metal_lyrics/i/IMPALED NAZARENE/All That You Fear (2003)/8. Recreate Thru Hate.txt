Like a phoenix from the ashes
We shall rise again
We shall recreate through hate
And make this world a better place

First we must crush and destroy
All those who oppose us
Then we can recreate through hate
United, all the strong ones

This is the final call to arms
We have to preserve what is ours
We must stand and win this fight
We owe it to our forefathers

Recreate thru hate
No mercy to our enemies
Recreate thru hate
Death to the weaklings

Glorious are the ones who fight
Side by side with our forces
City by city the cleansing is done
TIll nothing remains but Satan's hordes
