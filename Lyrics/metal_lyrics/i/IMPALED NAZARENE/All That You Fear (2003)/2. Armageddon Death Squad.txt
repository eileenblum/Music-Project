Can you hear the distant thunder
as the fear sets in
Deadbeat freak-out Armageddon
Obsessed with Death

Hammering down the Satan's Law
As all your fears now come true
this is the end of innocence
Satan's Reich of Hellfire Death
Armageddon Death Squad

You can try to pray for your god
But now it is too late
We have come to settle the score
Punishment is death

Hammering down the Satan's Law
As all your fears now come true
this is the end of innocence
Satan's Reich of Hellfire Death
Armageddon Death Squad

Darkness Descends - Death to Humanity
Hellfire &amp; Brimstone - Scream in Agony
Satan Laughs As You Eternally Rot

Hammering down the Satan's Law
As all your fears now come true
This is the end of innocence
Satan's Reich of Hellfire Death
Armageddon Death Squad
