It feels like eternity, it drives you insane
It tears your heart out, it blinds you totally
Everything is abnormal, everything is blurred
No matter how much you drink, you know it is true
When hangover kicks in, it is just fucking worse
And if you can sleep, your dreams are pure horror

You can make your choice,
You have the right to choose
It is nobody's business, what you decide to do
Fuck them and fuck the world, just fuck it all
If you decide to end it, then we have to accept it
(but we will be questioning your motives)

Then news are spreading, it is all over your face
Every fucking asshole, pretending to be his "friend"
"I bought his last beer, I did his last show"
If you cunts just knew, what he thought of you
This has been sickening, this hyped-up bullshit
I learnt a valuable lesson, I hate you all even more

You can make your choice,
You have the right to choose
It is nobody's business, what you decide to do
Fuck them and fuck the world, just fuck it all
If you decide to end it, then we have to accept it
(but we will be questioning your motives)

Life sucks and then you die
And it is not fair
Lucks sucks and then you die
And life goes on
Life sucks and then you die
I can list many assholes
Who should have died before you

See you somewhere brother!
