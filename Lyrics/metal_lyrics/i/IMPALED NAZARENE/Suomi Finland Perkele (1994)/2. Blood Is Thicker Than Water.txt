Lost in memories, of forgotten love
On hot summer night we were swimming naked under a moon
Lost in dreams, deep pain inside
The picture of deep love burning in my mind

[CHORUS 1:]
And heavens cried for my love
The night was still as I lifted her body on shore

Nothing to live for, I'm better off dead
I can't bear the pressure living without you my love

[CHORUS 2:]
And heavens opened for myself
The night was black as I pulled the trigger of my gun
