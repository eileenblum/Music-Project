Drunk in my room on my bed, empty bottle of Jack in my hands
I can see angels smiling... let's die!
I bought a pack of glue, sniffed it all at fullmoon
I can hear angels crying... let's die!

[CHORUS:]
Life is hell and then you die
So better speed it up with knife

In the darkest corner of the street, loading my veins with
speed
I can see angels falling... let's die, die, die, die...
SHOW'EM DAVE!

[bass solo]

I have driven myself too far, can't get enough gotta get more
I can smell angels burning... let's die!
