Firestorm - genocide
Kill them all before they kill you
Radiation - overkill
Apocalyptic truth of the year one (666)

[CHORUS 1:]
Ghettoblaster, megatron, kill!

Firepower - final war
Heading for the infernal reign
Raining blood - mushroom clouds
Rats, insects, vomit and agony

[CHORUS 2:]
Ghettoblaster, nervegas, kill!

[BRIDGE:]
Kill, fucking kill!
Make them fucking die
Kill, fucking kill
No mercy for scum

[BRIDGE]

Overrule - with terror and pain
As history turns the new page
666 - the year of hate
The year scum will be blown away

[CHORUS 3:]
Ghettoblaster, apocalypse, kill!
