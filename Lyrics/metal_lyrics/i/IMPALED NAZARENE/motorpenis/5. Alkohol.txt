[Cover from Tankard]

We're gonna die when the sun comes up
We'll drink until we drop

My blood is 100 proof

We're gonna stumble, twist and crawl
99 bottles of beer on the world
I'd rather drink than fuck

No doubt about it - I can't live without it
Alcohol, Alcohol

It is my destiny
You got the beer
We've got the time
You got the coke - gimme a line

No doubt about it - I can't live without it
Alcohol, Alcohol
