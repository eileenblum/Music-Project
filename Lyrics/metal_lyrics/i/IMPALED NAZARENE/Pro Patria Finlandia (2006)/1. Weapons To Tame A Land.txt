It is calm before the storm as time stands still
We are cornering your forces
Time is right to end this game
Your regime of terror
On your knees you pray for your god
Death you shall face
Armed with Desert
Eagles, we advance
Your fate was sealed ages ago
Bloodthirsty, no fear, will to kill
Devastate, annihilate, exterminate
Livestock runs away with fear
As your camps are burning
We have come to erase the crux
Were it all begin
On your knees you shall die
With 50mm piercings
Your filthy brothers are dying
Horrified, you watch this slaughter
Full of hate, no regrets, born to kill
Devastate, annihilate, exterminate
This is the final holocaust
End of your kind
No one survives
For we have the weapons
To tame your bastard lands
No one survives coming attacks
Your pristine sisters are molested
After raping all of them we shoot them dead
We shall walk on the ruins of your world
And we feel pride and honour
We have done the cleansing well
Like it was ordered
Not a single soul of your kin
Can carry on your work
Exquisite, refined, men of steel
Devastate, annihilate, exterminate
This is the final holocaust
End of your kind
No one survives
For we have the weapons
To tame your bastard lands
Nuclear mushrooms, the final solution
