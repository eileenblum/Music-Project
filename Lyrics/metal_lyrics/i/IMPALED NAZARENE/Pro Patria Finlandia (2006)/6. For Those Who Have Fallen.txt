Nation under attack, tanks rolling the streets
Fire eats everything as mother Europe weeps
Bravery, loyalty, stigmatized
For those you have fallen
Bravery, honesty, coffins
For those you have fallen
Under enemy fire brave men fell
Without questions went through hell
Families wept, husbands, fathers dead
Cities are burning as panic ensues
Why all the warning signs were ignored
Bravery, loyalty, stigmatized
For those you have fallen
Bravery, honesty, coffins
For those you have fallen
Under enemy fire brave men fell
Without questioning went through hell
Now you are reaping what they have sown
You turn your backs on the problems
When, in fact, you should be out killing
Under enemy fire brave men fell
Without questions went through hell
Now they turn on their graves
