About this so called life
Decaying, rotten to the core
Hateful. slimy degenerations
Pathetic no hope future
Life never gave you the right cards
Useless, exploited nobodies
Stuck with pits of shit
Might as well kill yourselves
Blind leading blind - Heading for doom
This castrated world
Blind leading blind - Heading for death
This castrated world
Blind leading blind - Crosseyed future for
This castrated world
Wake up before it is too late!
Sometimes you need to scare the lambs
Tell tales of evil bad wolves
Because if there is nothing to fear
They might think for themselves
Blind leading blind - Heading for doom
This castrated world
Blind leading blind - Heading for death
This castrated world
Blind leading blind - Crosseyed future for
This castrated world
Wake up before it is too late!
