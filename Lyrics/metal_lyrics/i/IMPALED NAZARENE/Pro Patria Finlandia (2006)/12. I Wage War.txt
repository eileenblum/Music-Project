Tree hugging hippies
Spoonfed scum
You worship Che Guevara
Your politics are sick
I wage war against your world
Will you life to see the end?
Pteromys volans crap
Blocks the way to progress
Two step forward
And three steps back
I wake war against your world
Will you live to see the end?
Downhill since '88
There is no future for green generation
How can this country ever to develop
When you are forcing your sickening ideology
I wage war against your country
You won't live to see the end!
