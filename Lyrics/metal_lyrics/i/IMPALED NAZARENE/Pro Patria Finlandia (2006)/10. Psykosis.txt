I need to defragment my head
I am going insane
Creepy fucking crawlers
Crawling under my skin
I can feel the pressure
Steaming from within
I need to wake up the dead
Lead them to salvation
Realize the futility of lite
Deeds, actions undone
By seismic scale
I score blank zero
Life equals conspitation
In our society
Life is conspitation
In our society
I want to defragment my head
Start from the beginning
Without creepy crawlers
Without killing pressure
I am puking myself dead
I am afraid of vomiting
What if I lost this came
And did not even get it
I am trapped in a dream
Yet I know I am awake
Can somebody help me
Give me more pills
So that I survive one more day
Without shitting myself
Life equals conspitation
In our society
Life is conspitation
In our society
