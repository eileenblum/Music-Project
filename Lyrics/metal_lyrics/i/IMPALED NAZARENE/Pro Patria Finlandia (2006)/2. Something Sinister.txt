Something sinister is on the air
Something sinister is lurking in the shadows
Something sinister is coming after you
You pay the price now for being a whore
It's a rape time and I can smell your pussy
It's a rape time and I can smell your fucking cunt
Tonight you are going to see the true face of evil
You pay the price for being an ignorant cunt
Something sinister is found to happen
Something sinister will rip you apart
Something sinister will be the law
You will beg for death to come fast
It's a rape time and I can smell your pussy
It's a rape time and I can smell your fucking cunt
Tonight you are going to feel the embodiment of evil
Your prayers for mercy shall be ignored
Something sinister is right here
Something sinister has the firm grip
Something sinister will make you swallow
You will be delighted but the taste of sin
It's a rape time and I can smell your pussy
It's a rape time and I can smell your fucking cunt
Tonight you can be proud once in your life
You got the attention you were craving for
Bruises, bleeding, pain come with the trade
Self-loathing won't get you far
Accept your fate and carry on living
Because you have chose to be something sinister
