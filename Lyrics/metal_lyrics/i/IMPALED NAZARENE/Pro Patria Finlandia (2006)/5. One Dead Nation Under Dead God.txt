Tactics never cease to amaze me
How to control the masses
Like a bunch of marionettes
They follow your every move
Feed the pigs much more lies
So they can pray for their dead god
One dead nation under dead god
And it is raining blood
Corpses are floating on the streets
Sun turns black, chaos all around
Install the marshall law
See how many of them cares
One dead nation under dead god
And it is raining blood
One dead nation under dead god
And it is raining manna
Now rejoice! This is the end
End of your world as the hood burns
Now rejoice! This is the end
This is the beginning
End of your world, end of their lies
The end as it is!
Truth shall set you free
That is what they say, truth prevails
Collect the corpses, funeral fees
Smile as they have set your soul free
One dead nation under dead god
And it is raining blood
One dead nation under dead god
And the world laughs
One dead nation - who controls who?
