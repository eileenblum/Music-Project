Action speaks louder than any words
Soon you'll find out what this really means
There are limits how much one can take
You have crossed the line too many times
I contemplate murder, torture, pain
When shit hits the fan, you will die
Blood pressure high, blinded by rage
Now I have had it, it's action time
I sneak into hallway, armed to the teeth
There are obstacles I need to remove
In order to live normal simple life
You must be silenced, dying time now
One winter night you shall meet your fate
I shall break in, I shall break your face
You are one worthless sub-human
I have had it, punishment is death
Fuck I will you!
That look in your face as you realise
what is to happen, your bowels give up
Nothing can stop me, before you are dead
Before every bone has been broken
Kicks, strikes, blood, agonizing pain
Last thing you will see, my priceless grin
One winter night you shall meet your fate
I shall break in, I shall break your face
You are one worthless sub-human
I have had it, punishment is death
Fuck I will you!
