Oh you will love the suffering
We will put you thru
Claiming to be the people's prophet
Deceiving mad carpenter

And now on the way to Golgotha
Whipped, spat at, humiliated
Born of whore

Vultures are circulating around
As you are dying
Boner-biting bastard christ
Cum-swallowing

And now dying at Golgotha
Beaten, laughed at, violated
Son of dog

[Cho:] The heat was like from 1000 suns
As you were nailed to the cross
Shit was running down on your legs
You were hating life and yourself

No magic tricks to save your ass
It is the day of reckoning
Questioning your existence
On the eve of death

And now dead at Golgotha
Raped, impaled, mutilated
False saviour

[Repeat chorus]
