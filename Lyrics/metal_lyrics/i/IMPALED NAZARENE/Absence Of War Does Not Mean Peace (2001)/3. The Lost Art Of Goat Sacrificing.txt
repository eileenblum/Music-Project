Master Belial, I summon thee from north
Bestow your power upon me
Fulfil my desires, make me invisible
So that my enemies cannot see
Lord Lucifer, plague this world with fire
Bring forth total destruction

For the glory of Satan, master Lucifer
Accept this goat, our offering
For the four crown princes of hell

My master Satan, hear my brave call
I pray for hell on earth
Let the locust attack, let it rain blood
Give me finally my Armageddon
Lord Leviathan, let loose the seas
So that weaklings will drown

For the glory of Satan, master Lucifer
Let there be darkness forever

And thus skies burst open
And terror was in their eyes
We could smell their fear of death
When they saw the shining blades

[Lead: Somnium]

In the name of Satan, we command the forces of hell
To head for the final battle
We slaughter the weak, destroy all the meek
Nothing can stop us now
As victory is ours, I raise my chalice of blood
To hail my lord Satanas

For the glory of Satan, master Lucifer
We are the servants that serve you well
Thy will be done, Thy kingdom come
Let there be darkness forever
All power to Satan, our true god

Finally we have reached the point
where we all are one with Satanas
