Silently we have been observing you
Watching closely your every move
Taking notes of your sickening motives
Gaining information of your forces
Preparing our men for the impending fight
As the ultimate plague is upon us

[Cho:] Absence of war does not mean peace
It is just a temporary phase
When all hell breaks loose
It is the war to end all wars

Silently all the killing will start
We will hunt you down one by one
We will destroy all your religious relics
We will burn down the places of worship
We will cut all your children's throats
And bury them under camel shit

[Repeat chorus]
