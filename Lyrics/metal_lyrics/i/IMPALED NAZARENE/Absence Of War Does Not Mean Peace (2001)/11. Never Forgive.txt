When you choose the path of vengeance
Be prepared to sacrifice everything on the way
Keep the flame of hate burning forever
Do not hold back at all for the cause
Keep in your mind that revenge is all that matters
Do whatever it takes to get it done

[Cho:] Never forgive, never forget
What they have done for you

Petrify the helpless before you strike
For they must suffer before they die
Kill the oxygen wasters for good
Do not let any of them escape alive
Keep in your mind that revenge is all that matters
Do whatever it takes to get it done

[Repeat chorus]
