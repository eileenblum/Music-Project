I fuck your girlfriends yet you worship me
I am a ruthless bastard, a total s.o.b.
I have broken up lots of families
It doesn't matter, I have no conscience
Only thing that counts is to conquer new nest
I have been successful on four continents

There is the burning madness right behind my eyes
I have chosen my own path and I can never die
Will never die, can never die

All those slammed doors, all those running tears
They mean absolutely nothing to me
I just turn my back and fuck off my way
With a diabolical smile on my face
Back in my kingdom I am thinking of you
As I masturbate in front of a mirror

There is the burning madness right behind my eyes
I have chosen my own path and I don't give a fuck
Don't give a fuck, won't give a fuck

I do know the power of the darkside,
As the dark descends, the hunt is again on
As my next victim, look into my eyes
Hear all the bullshit of love between us
Fuck everything else, it boils down to this
I am scared of nothing but afraid of myself

There is the burning madness right behind my eyes
I have chosen my own path and it leads to hell
Straight to hell, onward to hell
