Into the eye of the storm
It hits you like a train
And crawls under your skin
You are sure of death
Afraid of everything else

Into the eye of the storm
The pounding will never cease
The shaking will never die
The burning just won't stop
As you count your wounds

[Cho:] Yet I fall for it every time
I bow my head to king alcohol
I think it keeps me totally sane
Yet I know it drives me insane
So I keep on walking this thin line
This path to my own demise

Into the eye of the storm
You lay awake in the night
Afraid to close your eyes
When the sleep finally comes
Nightmares are endless

[Repeat chorus]

Most of the time I hate being alive
I am a caricature of a human being
It just gets worse the older you get
I swallow my pride which I never had
So at my lowest I know the solution
It kills all the problems, the balancing factor
Fuck this and fuck you too

Into the eye of the storm
It makes me feel like a king
I am an unstoppable warrior
On my way to the battle
You all can fuck off!
