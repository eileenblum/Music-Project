In these darkened times
Nothing fucking matters
Why fucking should it
Shouldn't you fuck off

In these fuck off times
All is said and done
Emotions dead and gone
Alone yet not lonely

In this shithole planet
Nothing comes for free
I am so fucking fed-up
Trying to cope with me

In my full of shit life
Shit keeps raining down
Shit keeps hanging around
Taste of shit in my mouth

This is the wrath of the goat
Leave a message and do fuck off
