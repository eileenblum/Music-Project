World gone to hell or so they claim
I don't give a fuck, I don't fucking care
I do as I please, I have my own rules
I carry my burn marks, scars really proud
Make me bleed!!!

Nothing is sacred in my world

I have no regrets for things I have done
There's nothing new for me under this sun

Nothing is sacred in my world

I am the usurper of mankind
Lurking in the shadows, lust in my eyes

I am my own master, my own god
Since you can't handle it you can fucking
Suck this by Wildchild

Time to worship me!!!
