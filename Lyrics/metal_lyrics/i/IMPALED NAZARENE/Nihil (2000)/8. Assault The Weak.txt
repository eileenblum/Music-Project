Blood sprays the landscapes again
As we lauch full-scale attack
This has been going on too long
Your existence is a joke

Assault and destroy all the weak
Crush them with an iron fist
My world doesn't need scum like you
Finally it's the payback time
The new dawn soon will rise
You will pay with your fucking life

Screams of pain fill the skies
As you watch your breed to die
Your prayers are said in vain
As Satan's generation leads the way

Shoot to kill Crush to destroy

What will be left of your world
Is just a hole in the ground
We will change the history
Set new standards for a human being

Shoot to kill Crush to destroy
