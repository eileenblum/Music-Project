My world view shattered when prophecies failed
I loathe this world, it makes me sick
I am tired of eating/vomiting out the lies
Confused, beaten, crippled by this life

Everything means nothing, so pervert it all
Time to stop caring, just fuck it all
Nothing means everything, just let it go
Because in the end it means nothing at all

Why should I laugh when shit blocks my jaw
How could I cry with my blinded eyes
Still crawling around, sweating like a pig
This makes no sense, my living hell

I taught myself, of hatred and scorn
Living hell, need to recharge
Reality strikes, I do understand
It's clear now that you can all just fuck off and die

Pretentious, back-stabbing, two-faced world
Post eclipse era thus dwell in joy
