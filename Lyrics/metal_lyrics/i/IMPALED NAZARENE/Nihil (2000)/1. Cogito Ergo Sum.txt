Painted my world black
Destroyed everything I had
Burnt all the bridges behind
I was prepared to die
Ready for Armageddon
Then nothing came

Cogito Ergo Sum

Waited for another date
For this shit planet to end
Why the fuck it didn't go
The way it was supposed

Not only I am bitter
I am filled with hate
All I ever was asking for
This shit to end!

Haistakaapa vittu jo by Wildchild

So I am trying to reason
Trying to carry on
Yet I am hoping for
Total mass destruction
