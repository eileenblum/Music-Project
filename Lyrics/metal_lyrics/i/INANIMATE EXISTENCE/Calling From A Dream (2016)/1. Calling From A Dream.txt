Close your eyes
Listen to my call
Our bond will bring us together again

I will wait for you
For our hearts still beat as one

Gloom overshadows 
The castle walls of stone 
With dark ambiance

The vile plume of rotting death
Filling the wind as he unlocks the entry
To the kings boundless chamber

All is silent 
As he discerns the unearthly dark shades 
That stand over the sultan lifeless

Vibrance in their eyes
No longer apparent
Like steam the spirits rise towards the ceiling

His eyes are met 
By the glowing gaze of the scorpioness
She descends the pillars to confront him face to face

Shrieking
"This land is now controlled
By the shadow king
Lord Tennebrus"

Her eyes burn red, piercing deep inside of his mind
Resonating, vibrating down his spine

Inside his head he sees the blackened armor of Lord Tennebrus
He is seated down on the throne

Seven spirits
Swarming around his head

In the midst of the trance
The arachnid beast slams her mighty claws
Crushing the stone flooring 
Into a chasm of webs he plummets

The comforting caress of darkness
Brings with it the memory of love lost long ago
Close your eyes and listen to my call
Our bond will bring us together again

I will wait for you
For our hearts still beat as one
Listen to my calling from a dream
