Azlahn guides me into the heart of the mountain

Azlahn guides me through the many wormholes Saraph created

[Lead: Joel]

Magma pulsating in his gaze lights the chamber
The guardian of the flame has awakened
Saraph the sanguine serpent of flame

The guardian of the flame awakens growing from the beating heart of the mountain

[Lead: Joel]

I am saraph of the seven who created this planet
we have existed since the beginning and together birthed the souls of man

Arise from the ashes, arise from the cavern where souls burn
Transcend the pain it is not your fate

Your eyes confess your past deeds in bias your minds blinded 
you are the cause of the devils rising and only you can destroy the dark one

Let the living flame take you into the sky like a feather in the wind 

Everything halts as suddenly iron footsteps approach from behind 
A knights blade grinds against the stone dragging it on his approach

[Lead: Joel]

The monks of flame watch without concern, praying to Saraph,
they conjure their souls into the air staring at the burning one

While humming the song of flame
Summoning burning rain 
from above the heavens weep 
Sulfur
Turning to ash as it touches their flesh
their skin petrifies

Everything halts as suddenly iron footsteps approach from behind 
a knights blade grinds against the stone dragging it as he approaches.

Heat emits from him his armor glows their eyes meet and now they both know that one has to die
