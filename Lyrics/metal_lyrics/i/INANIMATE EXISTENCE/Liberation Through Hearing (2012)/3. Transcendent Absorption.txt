Lost in darkness, so deep, all reality is forgotten
And I begin to see the void opening in front of me.
Showering the transcendent with healing spectral rays,
So powerful my physical self dissolves into the bardo.
As my mind, a single molecule of awareness, I travel forth
Surpassing time and space; in this new form I am flawless.
And without pain.
Perpetual flow of thought where I begin to take form
As the all powerful iguanid lord,
Governing all souls. whether living or dead,
They must pass my judgement,they must prove their worth,
Or they are lost in darkness
So deep, all reality is forgotten,
And they are trapped in the void
Suffering eternally
