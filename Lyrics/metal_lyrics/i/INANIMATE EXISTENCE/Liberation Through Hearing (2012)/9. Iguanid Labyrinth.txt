Laying dead, my body broken, my soul in a state of possession
Forms surround me watching over; I am lost beneath the mist
It projects these 3 dimensional images pertaining to the judgment of my soul
The gate has now opened directly in front of me; Pressure is building on my insides and suddenly
I blast of through galaxies, piercing through the space/time continuum
My shell is no more, melted away, a cosmic shell is all I remain, deeper and deeper I plummet to the wormhole
I begin to fear for my existence, itÃ­s gathering the souls of all life forms across the universe
I am one with them
Instinctively I struggle, I cannot break free
The darkness has ingested me
I enter the blackened dominium of the serpent headed god
A grim realization that this is hell and I have ceased to be
With the size of a titan, his scales like iron, and breathing fire
I kneel before the throne of the iguanid lord
He speaks without words but instead through holographic imagery
I am damned; my soul is doomed to spend all eternity wandering the hall of this labyrinth
Awaiting my time to be reanimated, I am a prisoner in this new world, a slave to the lizard king
Following command, Fulfill his bidding, I must complete the tasks
Weaving the weak minded from the earth realm, only the strong will be reborn
Eternity passes by me over and over again; Light pierces through the ceiling in a single beam
Surrounding my discarnate self and piecing my organs together like intricate fibers
Levitating through this massive structure and blasting off through galaxies, piercing through the space/time continuum
My shell is reborn, resurrection
I awaken unchanged through the eyes of my former self.
