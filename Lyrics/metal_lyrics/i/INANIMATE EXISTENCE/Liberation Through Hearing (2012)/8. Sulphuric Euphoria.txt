I am a contradictory existence,
Present within everything but existing in nothingness
From inside taunt thee with thoughts of lust and greed
I manifest my soul into the vessels of straying human consciousness,
Inflated with painful self inflictions
I seek to destroy this living body
In frenzied convulsions, an impulse
Clawing at my skin in a rapidly growing rage
Until pain subsides, it is not enough I begin to stab myself, eviscerating
All that I can grab, wearing the innards to mock thee
Desecration is the path of my rebirth, obtained by disassembling
Every atom of matter, these simplistic masochisms will not suffice
A vat of sulphuric acid is my means of escape
To fill my final resting place with this sacred liquid
I plunge this human into the porcelain casket
As skin begins to drip down my cheek
The overwhelming sense of comfort sets in
Deteriorate, disintegrate, reverting
Back to elemental purity, I return to the cosmos
Sulphuric euphoria
