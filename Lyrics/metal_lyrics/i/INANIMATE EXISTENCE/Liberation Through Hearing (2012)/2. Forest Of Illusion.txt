No longer am I driven by the senses of this physical reality
No longer bound by this earth
I am the sole creator of this alternate reality
This is the site of my rebirth
Creating a new realm formed within my own mind
Flowing like water. a stream of thought
Shaping this universe
The thoughts inside me become creations
Intertwined in a perfect symbiosis
The forest begins to grow
Manifestations of my evil past
The trees living and communicating their origin
Rooted in the flesh of rotted cadavers and watered by rivers of blood
Ripping apart those who have wandered from consciousness
Feeding the growth of my morbid dimension where i remain eternally
The souls of those lost from their own reality
Becoming rooted to my evil
Engraved hieroglyphs burning, shining through the woods
The leaves combusting. glowing with mystic embers,
The spirits seek the guiding light
Of the forest of illusion
Drawing in transcendent beings lost from their physical reality
Torn from their earth
And reborn into this alternate reality, where i am god
Metamorphosis, I begin to grow,
Erecting spikes from every vertebrae
My teeth' are pushed, falling, hammered out by serrated fangs
As green scales replace my skin
Forever shall my third eye face the cosmos of light
Forever I shall remain the iguanid lord
Intertwined in a perfect symbiosis
In the forest of illusion
