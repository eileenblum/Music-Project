Within the purest nothingness before the creation of matter.
Looking to a state of infinite density and temperature.
The first form of early energy begins to expand faster then the speed of light.
Pure energy converting to sub-atomic particles.
Colliding and creating energy capable of forming matter and anti matter
Creating gravity and elements. hydrogen gas clouds light the stars.
Birthing galaxies and planets, birthing multiple complex lifeforms, birthing life.
Creating single celled organisms. secreting natural adhesive and combining.
Multi-celled life begins to regulate steady growth.
Algae forms self organizing flagella controlling the direction it travels.
Migrating to land, it grows vegetation. once scorched, the land is now inhabitable
Combining multi-celled organisms capable of adapting to different climates,
Ever evolving, to the needs of the host, morphogenesis.
The earth, these galaxies, risen from nothingness, birthing life
