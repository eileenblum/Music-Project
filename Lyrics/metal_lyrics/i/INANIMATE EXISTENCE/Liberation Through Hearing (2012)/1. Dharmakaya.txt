We are composed of atomic matter.
Formed within the stars of our galaxies.
Splitting atoms causes a release of phenomenal energy.
Which can neither be created nor destroyed.
Therefore this energy has always been.
This energy is present within every cell and atom of your body.
This energy is conscious and intelligent, flowing from within.
This energy is the self organizing principle of nature.
Its laws are this power.
Encoded within is an evolutionary impulse to evolve lifeforms.
With an ever increasing ability for self knowing.
The ability of deep thought.
Leading to the truth of knowing your own existence. 
The ability to know it is the extent to which you are self realized through meditation.
You can see it with the minds eye,  as the purest light of your inner being.
You can hear it within as the sound of your atoms, the ohm, the music of the spheres.

Cosmic consciousness exists within every cell of your body.
"Samadhi" a timeless state where one can know oneself as pure intelligent awareness.
To exist in absolute bliss, within the realm of dharmakaya.
Eliminate the feelings of separation to merge with the source of life thats within you.
To align thyself with the energy within the atomic structure that creates thy being.
