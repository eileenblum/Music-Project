"Ayahasca" is the secret passed to me by the elder god
An archaic recipe that contains the key to opening my third eye
I've pierced the pineal barrier. within it lies the power to speak with the
Creators,
And see the past and future of earth. eons of existence lived in nano-seconds
Look to the spectrum of cosmic light. an infinite, symbiotic fusion of
Darkness
This reality has become my home
I drink the brew of mimosa hostilis, synthesized with the caapi vine
No sense now can block interpretation. the higher power infuses me
With its energy
I am no longer a fragment of the universe. I am electric current
I travel to survey far beyond these galaxies
Now I've reached enlightenment, a beauty unseen by human eyes, but in
Inanimate existence
I am no longer a fragment of the universe. I have become the universe
Thought is responsible for all anguish
From this other perspective I've become freeform myself
In suspended animation. into inanimate existence
