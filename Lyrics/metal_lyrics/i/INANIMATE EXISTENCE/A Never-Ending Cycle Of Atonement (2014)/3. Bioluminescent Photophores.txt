Hours pass like seconds as i stare into the heap of roasted flesh and blank stares
Expressions of agony embedded on their faces
The woman that i love is leering back at me, open eyes hypnotize
She bleeds profusely through her cracked skin

Her corpse begins to levitate, as all other bodies disintegrate
From above she drips blood, Collecting in puddles on the ground
and hardening in piles of human ash, forming an altar
Open eyes paralyze me in fear as she stares through my soul

Gusting winds blow away away the ashes that remain, creating a cryptic Mandala
I enter the ring of clotted blood, crossing the threshold
With both feet in the circle, a light beams into the air and an incredible energy begins covering my body, endless growing patterns that glow with power

Bioluminescent Photophores, siphoning energy from the cosmos, I gain an infinite knowledge
Lightning bolts arc from my fingertips and are conducted to her floating corpse
A final mist of guts is sprayed, she implodes into a beam of light

[Solo: Cameron Porras]

The light opens a portal 
Rabbit hole is open leading down into the reaches of hell
Step by step i creep down the staircase forming
With every step i take another one appears, continuing for miles until i reach the gate of iron

Burdened by hesitation, though i have accumulated this inhuman strength, i am still wary of where i am
I open the door and step into the energy chamber

[Solo: Cameron Porras]
[Solo: Joel Guernsey]

I cross through the magic passageway and appear submerged in murky water
Frantically i swim toward the moons illumination and upon breaking the surface i discover millions of dead bodies spanning hundreds of miles
Only one path is visible to me
It leads through the forest and to the gates

[Solo: Cameron Porras]

Darkness paralyzes me in fear, though i summon strength to continue
There will be no returning
The tyrant dwells, waiting for me
