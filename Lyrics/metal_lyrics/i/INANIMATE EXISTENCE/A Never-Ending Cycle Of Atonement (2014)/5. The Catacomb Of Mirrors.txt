The sky speaks to me in the night guiding with unending constellations
For centuries i traverse this planet that i have created for myself, 
still searching for the face of the ever growing evil deep inside of me
In my mind a demon is laughing at the futility of my intentions, 
and curses my mortality, a pain I've never felt

A pain spawned from resentment of evil I've yet to witness
Only as the night comes does it taunt my sleep
Centuries have passed since my encounter with the wise one
The distant event is unreal among the nightly terrors I've faced since
The frigid air or the blizzard is spraying ice shards cutting deep

I have no will to continue as I collapse
Falling from the thin walkway that held me from tumbling down the mountain side that I had spent weeks climbing, but i was unable to conquer
The jaws of the mountain open for me
Cracks of earth devour without mercy
I welcome the gift
I welcome death

I awaken face down in the snow
As I stumble to my feet I am struggling to breathe,
my arms are crippled beyond repair
The walls of the cavern are towering over me
Surrounded on all sides with ice, I am enclosed
I examine my reflection and study the countless wounds
I pound my fist in anger against the catacomb wall, 

The mirror cracks
The ice now reflects myself showing me images of the future
A crystal mosaic shining light upon my soul

[Solo: Cameron Porras]

Through the light I am whole, moving remotely without effort
I sit upright aligning cosmic energy with the earth
The tree of life grows from my mind
My flesh becomes the bark
It is within this shell I will spend eternity
