Seated beneath the tree of life
Vertical and in a trance
Spine is in alignment
And my eyes are closed

Focusing on my breathing
Imagining my pain as a torch
Under my breath i can see it flickering
Creating an intricate dance

Staring through fire

I begin to see the doorway open
Staring through the fire
I can see the doorway opening in my mind

The orange light dances
creating intricate design
Staring through fire
I begin to see the doorway open

Staring through the fire
I can see the doorway opening in my mind

I can see the waves crashing on the shore
I am as high as a cloud
I've risen high above

The wind's gust softly keeps me on track
I can hear a voice calling me back
I can feel her reach for me 
Unable to break my petrified stance

All organic tissue has been replaced by minerals
Frozen in time
She weeps at the sight of what I've become

No more shall I exist in agony
Never again to return 
My reality is gone
Transcending the earth
My soul now exists
Only within space

I am lost and there is no returning me

I'm a conscious being 
Who is perfectly neutral in every way
Existed in two parts
A body and a mind
Now i am one

Staring

[Solo]

Staring through fire
The unending flickering dances with my soul
Staring through fire
I let the light and warmth envelope me

Staring through
Through flame
This is what I was always meant to be
