The stars align shining light upon the path 
Through the infinite living forest 
And as a myriad of overlapping whispers cloud my head
The foliage wilts bowing to their ruler

Tree's guide me along the passage
Until I reach a stone wall that scrapes the sky
Light beams energy upon the obelisk
Pulsating images reveal hieroglyphs
In a language unknown to me
Though I am able to read the scripture
I see the coded word as a picture
I halt my physical sense and i see through the window
Fusing energy growing from the planet with cosmic creation
Fire surrounds me as I read from the epitaph
As I bellow out the prayer a shockwave tears
Apart the wall

Fire burns away the evil ones
Cleansing this broken dimension
And as the dust clears away
Taking with it swarms of the lost spirits
The realm is born again

Recreating this universe through my conscience
In the form of that which has been taken away
I recreate through my power
Form is given to organisms
Through my eyes a gift is given
A chance at life once again
