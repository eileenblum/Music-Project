[Solo: Cameron Porras]

The dream continues to live on long after I awake, 
my eyes burning in a fiery gloss
I am staring into nothingness, or so it seems

[Solo: Cameron Porras]

Mind projects memories as physical entities
I speak with my family once again
Walking through the village I had lost once before
I have made it home, where I always wanted to be
The physical realm is relative to whoever and however they perceive it to be
The universe rearranges itself to suit my own will

[Solo: Cameron Porras]

My third eye see's without influence of sense,
seeing only what I wish
Gazing into a world deemed unreal, what is real?
They begin to transform, their faces become veiled in dark masks
This is the evil I was sent to expunge
I know where I stand, I follow command and am led into night
I slay the spirits of the demonic

Into night
I will hack and slash without remorse
Into night, I kill everything without conviction
into night
I am hacking and dissecting hearts
I kill the ones inside me
My subconscious speaks to me altering my perception

Projections of evil that come from my mind are stemming from the catacombs from which I spend eternity
Into night
Through purging them I gain atonement

[Solo: Cameron Porras]

I heave the corpses into mass collection
I summon strength from the sky and lightning falls from the heavens
I sit beneath the burning bodies
Evil fades, but the faces of my family remain
It was me all along
What I'd been seeking was within me
