The uncanny churning in my stomach grows, as the storm beats upon me. My skin is saturated and I feel my flesh rot beneath my steps. Though I don't know where to go, I know I must continue down this route. I'm drawn to the glowing in the distance. One lonely light is flickering from a single source of luminance. I follow the fire. 

An encampment awaits me. There's a lonesome shelter and a man in dark robes is seated by the flame. As I approach he stands to face me...
"This was coming for some time now." The man utters quietly, "You are the only one who can defeat tyranny." 
"What do I have to do with this ordeal? Why must I be the one to slay the god?"
"You are born of divine energy containing concealed power, locked away." he reveals.
"How can I believe in what you say when I don't even know where I am? I must return home."
"The evil ones have overflowed into your utopia only you are kept safe in your dream state. You are the survivor of the apocalypse."
I have a realization of what he speaks, if what he says is true then I must continue. From the slumber I wake to a village aflame. The man's prophecy came to be.
"This was coming for some time now," the man's voice echoes in my brain. As I stare into the pile of the scorched inhabitants. What do I have to do with this ordeal? Why must I be the one to slay the god? Evil flame burning me, only fire I can see, so I sit upon the ground seeming like eternity. I let go from my soul, I let evil take control and I become the fire.

The uncanny churning in my stomach grows, as the storm puts out the flame. Lying before me in the charred pile in front of which I stand a familiar face. The face of my one and only love is staring back at me lifeless. Anger grows in me. I am left with no other choice, now I know this is my destiny.
