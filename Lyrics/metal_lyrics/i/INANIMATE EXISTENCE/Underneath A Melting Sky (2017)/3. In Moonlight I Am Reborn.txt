Spirits guide me from the darkness
Their faces reflected on moonlit waterways

Falling away (every passing moment)
From my sanity (I plunge even deeper)
Obscuring the way (I am lost in darkness)
My own reality (I am now ready to die)

In the sky, the moon, she seems to speak
calling to me

Falling away (every passing moment)
From my sanity (I plunge even deeper)
Obscuring the way (I am lost in darkness)
My own reality (I am now ready to die)

Floating upon my back as I gaze upon
the wondrous mosaic the sky has become
In the moonlight, I am reborn
