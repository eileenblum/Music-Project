"I relinquish thee of the spell I hath put upon your soul
Rise to your feet and accept the key to the universe"

At the center of this world
Beyond the frozen cavern walls you
will find the formula of spores
Combining shrooms that grow emerald
The formula of spores
Follow me to where the catalyst grows

I throw my cloak into the pit and birth a fire
I prepare the mixture, the formula of spores

This potion unhinges my soul
From this realm I am pulled

Passing through the cave I ascend into the sky
I feel pain no more as I have become one

Flying through infinity
Leaving behind all recognition

No remembrance of my past
My energy reverts into the galaxies
I feel pain no more
Leaving behind all recognition

I feel pain no more
Free of what I once was I travel forth
Into infinity
