Lonesome are the walls of the laboratory
that enclose the dreary living space that he calls his home
Hidden away from the urbanites
Skulking in shadows, they see his candle lit every night
Bolts upon the lightning rod, organizing his creation
Laughing in the face of god

They say he does not sleep
nor does he venture from the depths of his confined habitat
Few have seen him and less have communed
They say he has gone mad
They say he brings damnation upon us

Forever to burn in the name of god
Igniting the flame like a candle
Cleansing the earth of the demon
Forever to burn

Cursing your life, we send the flame upon thee
Torches ignite, burning all that we see
Cursing your life, we send the flame upon thee
Torches ignite, burning all that we see

Forever to burn in the name of God
Igniting the flame like a candle
Cleansing the earth of the demon
Forever to burn

May your god have more mercy than we
as we send you to eternity

Forever to burn in the name of God
Igniting the flame like a candle in the fog

May your god have more mercy than I
and your soul return into the sky

Forever to burn in the name of God
Igniting the flame like a candle in the fog
Forever to burn in the name of god
Send him to hell like a candle in the fog
