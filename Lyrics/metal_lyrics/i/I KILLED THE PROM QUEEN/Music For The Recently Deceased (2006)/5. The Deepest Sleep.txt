I'll take you down to the water's edge.
I'll show you exactly what its like, to feel alive.
As you gaze up at the sky, as your frail hands reach out for mine.
I have forced myself to look away..
As all hope is lost, as you gaze up at the sky.
I'll show you exactly what its like to feel alive.
We'll paint it black and blue, as a painful reminded of the black heart that's beating inside you, bleeding inside you.
Among the merciful, sin will reign.
Only guilt will crush us all..
And when we face the end we'll find the deepest sleep.
In graves we dug ourselves.
I'll make sure you never sleep again.
The air around us has become a threat to swallow.
These words are uttered in contempt and spat out like poison.
I hope you rot down to the core.
From many years of misery I'm torn in two.
We'll paint it black and blue, as a painful reminded of the black heart that's beating inside you, bleeding inside you.
Among the merciful, sin will reign.
Only guilt will crush us all..
And when we face the end we'll find the deepest sleep.
In graves we dug ourselves.
