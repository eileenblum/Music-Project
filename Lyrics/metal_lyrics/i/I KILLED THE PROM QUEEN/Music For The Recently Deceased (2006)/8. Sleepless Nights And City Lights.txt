While you've been dreaming of the dead and lost.
I have been awake kissing these clock faces.
The fear of sleep has left me tired and worn.
But in her dreams is where I will haunt her.
I've seen the shadows..
Of this burning angel.
These city lights will never be as beautiful as your eyes..
I'll pick up the pieces that you've failed, and fallen to the ground.
Let my words set and fall upon your unwilling ears.
It will be okay..
I took to the sky, did you mourn for me
Well who needs flowers when they're dead and buried.
For now my whisper is my dearest friend.
But even I know this won't last forever.
I've seen the shadows..
Of this burning angel.
These city lights will never be as beautiful as your eyes..
I'll pick up the pieces that you've failed, and fallen to the ground.
Let my words set and fall upon your unwilling ears.
It will be okay.
Smile when you think of me, the pain will go in time.
I may be alone with fear in my mind.
I leave these words in hope that.. that we'll meet again..
Again.. Now?
I know this won't last forever.
