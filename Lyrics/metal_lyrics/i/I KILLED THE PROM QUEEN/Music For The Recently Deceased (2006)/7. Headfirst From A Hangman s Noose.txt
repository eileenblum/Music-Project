I've never compared myself.
And I couldn't care anymore.
I've never had it to hold, so I've got nothing to lose.
Young love left you broken hearted.
"We could have never had us, because I never had you".
So let your eyes tell the tale.
What I was meant to say.
I thought of you for too long.
Now a frozen smile.. won't even bring you back.
Your kiss is no longer safe to me anymore.
Your lips have turned into something I don't know anymore.
They are the gates to a vicious tongue.
Your razor wrists won't make this change or go away.
I'd never trust those bloodshot eyes..
This love was living with its eyes sewn shut.
At times I'd love to bludgeon you and dance with your corpse.
Yesterday's memories left me weak.
I'm chasing shadows, wasting time, waiting for vegas to call my name.
Idle thoughts spill constantly, from open mouths, with their eyes sewn shut.
I hope this haunts you like it does me, b-sides and broken smiles won't dance with me.
Idle thoughts spill constantly, from open mouths, with their eyes sewn shut.
