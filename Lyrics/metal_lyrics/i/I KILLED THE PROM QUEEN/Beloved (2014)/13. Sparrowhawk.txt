[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Always waking up to...
This city is cold and I am drained
I know my heart will stay
...
Burning bright lighting the way (lighting the way)

Everytime...this is the end
But the gap between us grows...
I'll sink again

If I could find a way, we wouldn't stay (we wouldn't stay)
We would be right here by my side
Close my eyes, taking me in
Locked in the...of your heart

I cannot give into the fact, that you're miles away
You're the...
I wish I could say....again

...falling apart
...
Carry me into the night
It's hard to hear your heart beat through the phone tonight
I need you to keep me here in sight (keep me in sight)

If I could find a way, we wouldn't stay (we wouldn't stay)
We would be right here by my side
Close my eyes, taking me in
Locked in the...of your heart

Everytime I...this is the end
But the gap between us grows...
I'll sink again

Swept away by tide of lonliness
Under...regret [2x]

If I could find a way, we wouldn't stay (we wouldn't stay)
We would be right here by my side

Everytime I...this is the end (this is the end)
But the gap between us grows...

Fuck it...again
