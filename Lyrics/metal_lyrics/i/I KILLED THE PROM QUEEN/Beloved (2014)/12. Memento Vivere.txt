[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]These scars make me who I am
A weary heart just waiting for the end
We're all holding on to this lament
And embraced by arms of resentment
We'll make the most of the warmth they emit
Close my eyes, don't leave me here

This is for those who are so lost, they barely know themselves
For the ones buried beneath hopelessness

Guidance is given by your hands
You offered hope and raised me from the dead
Recreant, be brave and face your fears you said
Beloved I know you'll never let me fall again
I'll hold on, I've found safety here

This is for those who are so lost, they barely know themselves
For the ones buried beneath hopelessness
This is for those who are so frail, from bearing the weight of the world
For the ones plagued by lowliness and a heavy heart
Fuck

It's time we made our way back home
My hope remains unbroken
It's time we made our way back home

Never stop believing
Home is forever
A beating heart

This is for those who are so lost, they barely know themselves
For the ones buried beneath hopelessness
This is for those who are so frail, from bearing the weight of the world
Upon their shoulders
Breathe, you're home now, it's over
