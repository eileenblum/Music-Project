Please take me back to the start
Where we still hold this close to our hearts
I wonât let it tear us apart

Please take me back to the times
Where you can see the life in my eyes
And you knew that my love will never die

My love will never die

Please take me back to the times
Where you can see the life in my eyes
And you knew that my love will never die
