"A man we had never seen previously," said the amiable whore, "came to the house and proposed a rather unusual ceremony: he wished to be tied to one side of a stepladder. We secured his thighs and waist to the third rung and, raising his arms above his head, tied his wrists to the uppermost step. He was naked. Once firmly bound, he had to be exposed to the most ferocious beating, clubbed with a cat's handle, when the nocks and the gibs of the cords were worn out. He was naked, I repeat, there was no need to lay a finger upon him, nor did he even touch himself. But after having received a savage pounding, his monstrous instrument rose like a rocket. It was seen to sway and bounce between the ladder's rungs, hovering like a pendulum and, soon after, impetuously launch its fuck into the middle of the room! He was unbound. He paid, and that was all."
