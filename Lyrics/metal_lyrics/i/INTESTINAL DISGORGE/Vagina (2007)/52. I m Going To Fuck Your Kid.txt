I broke into their house around one a.m. armed with a cock and a shotgun / I blasted that bitchâs husband while he slept, his whole torso flew open / She woke up with blood and skin all over her sheets, scraps of tissue and bone / This song has nothing to do with fucking kids by the way / But I blasted jism all over that crying little bitch
