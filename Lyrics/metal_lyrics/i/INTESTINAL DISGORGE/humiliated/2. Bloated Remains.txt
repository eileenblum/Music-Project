Sitting in my bathrub with dead eyes bulging
Her body turns purple and black, bloating
Methane gas fills her corpse, making her expand
Good Thing I didn't marry her, I knew she'd get fat.
The stench of putrefaction wafts into my bedroom
Sweet dreams of bitches wearing methane perfume.
Insects are crawling through the cracks in the tile
Maggots consume the creamy rotten flesh.
