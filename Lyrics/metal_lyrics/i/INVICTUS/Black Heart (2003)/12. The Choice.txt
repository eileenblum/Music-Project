Alone in the waves of time
Looking for which way is mine
I'm down and Im totally poor
I am the slave of chance

Losing control of my brain
I feel I'm losing my mind
I see the shadows of rain
In the land of illusion

Tell me what you are
You play, you say
You lie about her
You play with my mind

Are these streets my only home
Degradation my family?
From where comes this wild horse?
What choice between these two doors?

[Chorus]
In this mirror I see my life
In her eyes... I see my double
She desires my soul and he craves my blood
The time of sacrifice

Your sins are a kingdom I've seen before
Was I at this time a fool or a king?

Light ! ... light of heaven
Flames ! ... flames of hell now
I can't decide where I'll end
End my life

Tell me what you are
You play, you say
You lie about her
You play with my mind

Now in the flames of this hell
I forget all of my pain
Ready to take this cold hand
His blood flowing through my veins
