Since the mournful day she died
I've committed no crime
I'm living with my black heart
Huddled up like a child

Gold dust underneath my feet
I'll reach Heaven's gates
I'm living by the black light
I sense the smell of blood

I remember her dress of blood
My face drowning in there
Just screaming in the black night
Praying not to be there

Heartache, pain - all that remain
It's raining in my heart
I can still hear their sad barks
Of the dogs of hell

[Chorus]
I can't turn around
Death's ghost is behind
I can't go away
I need to cast off my bonds
I can't live

I can play
By the Devil's rules
But I can't like a game
When the dice are loaded
By a sadistic cheater
I can play with madness
But I can't bring her back
Back to life...

My heart spills out all over the floor
I don't want to live anymore
I only stay in the dark
I cry every blessed day

I won't say that I'm innocent
But I've paid for my crimes
I have explored my dark side
I'm very close to death.
