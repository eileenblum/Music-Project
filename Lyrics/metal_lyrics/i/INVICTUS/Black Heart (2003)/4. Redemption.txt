Flames over the cell
Burned by the rising sun
It's always the same
Breaking chains it's time to run

You feel...how in my life was I wrong
You give...me what I could never have

Now that I'm falling
Is it infinity?
Or...is it a trap
A memory breakdown? You feel

You feel...how in my life I was wrong
You give...me what I could never have

[Chorus]
Fight...we don't live to find answers
We are here just to question this life
This human life - illusion?

Fight...we can't find, find a key
Can we reach reality are we
Are we ghosts, dust in the wind?

Flames over the cell
I'm burned by the rising sun
It's always the same
Breaking chains it's time to run

You feel...how in my life was I wrong
You give...me what I could never have

There is no easy life
When this silence surrounds us
It's raining in my eyes
To live is now too much for me

Fight!
Five hundred and fifty-five
We don't live to find answers
We are just to question this life
This human life illusion?
Can we reach reality?
Are we ghosts?
Are we ghosts?.... Dust in the wind?
It's time for redemption!

When you're flying away to the stars...
