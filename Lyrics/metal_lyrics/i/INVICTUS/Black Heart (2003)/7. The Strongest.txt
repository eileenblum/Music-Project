Since the day you made me die
The witch opened my eyes
And told me "Steal his power"
"You'll rise from your ashes"

I feel the earth beneath my feet
I will reach Heaven's gates
And I will face the dark one
And burn his dirty mind

[Chorus]
With the passing of time
I will reclaim
My life with her
With the passing of time
I'll be the strongest

I promise you I'll make you cry
And soon you will implore
You will be the king no more
Of your kingdom of pain

You'll end up six feet under
I will dispose of you
You can't re-enter my life
You'll be just a bad memory
