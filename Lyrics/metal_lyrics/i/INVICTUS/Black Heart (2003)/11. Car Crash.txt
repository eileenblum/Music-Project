When I jump into my car, I turn the volume up
I shake my head against the beat, then I can feel my pulse
The sign of living fast
Hear my motor purr
Get right, get right

The race is my religion, the steering wheel my heart
I know I am burning my life, I'm sitting near to Death
Screaming at the windscreen
It's more than I can bear
Get right, get right

[Chorus]
Hear the crushing steel, tears in my eyes
Where is my glory, I feel so sad

Start to make the wheels squeal, I love this sound of pain
Suddenly I felt the wind, blow into my head
Then I saw a man
And I heard his voice
"He's dying, he's dying"

It was on a Friday morning
And on a foggy street
On the road I could see
The lorry of Death seeming to rise from nowhere
