At first I open just one eye
I feel that I'm groggy and I...
Can hardly move

Death is sitting next to me
This red face of the woman that
I love more than anything

I can't manage to realize
I fall out of the car and I...
I throw up

[Chorus]
I gotta know
I gotta ride
If I am dead or still alive
Beyond the night, beyond the crash
I gotta know
I gotta ride
If I am dead or still alive
Beyond the night, beyond the crash
Beyond the other side

I feel a presence inside me
I can hear: "No, don't be afraid,
I am the Ancestor
At the crossroads of eternity
I'm here to protect you because
They have unfortunately died
But you will not be alone
Look for your guardian angel
Believe".
