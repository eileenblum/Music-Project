Born in 1900, born to be a man
My smile is my disguise, but inside angry and sore
I think I might go crazy, I am feeling kind a weak
I want to be alone, I am ready for death

I press the knife into my wrist
And I hear my blood pour out

[Chorus]
As the stars come out
Need to meet a god
I am lost in my own world
There is nowhere to hide
No hope in my life
I like to taste pain
My fear is your fear
There is nowhere......nowhere to hide!

Once again I'm praying, 'cause I'm looking for a god
I need someone to trust, I try to clear my mind
I need some time to think, my mind is going blank
Like a tear down on my face, I am on a road to death
