Questions burning in my mind.
Do you love me as I am?
With my sins and devotion.
Please give me absolution.

Yeahhhh....I gaze into your eyes.
Yeahhhh.....try to feel your mind.

[Chorus]
In the light of the day, I can see your face.
I listen to your voice, you whisper my name.
I...I need your help, your guiding hand.
Please...please give me strength to bear my scars.

There's a poison in my brain.
You kiss me on my head.
Underneath this pale gray sky.
Can you tell me your secret?
