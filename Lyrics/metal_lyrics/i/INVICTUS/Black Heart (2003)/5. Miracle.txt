I was wandering like a ghost
With no place to run
The net is closing in
Trapped in this dead end

Chorus
The solace, the end I...
Await
The solace, the end I...
Await
Take me oh...."With your soul I play"
Take me now..."She is made of clay"
Just a miracle..."You are nothing but a pawn now"

Life's a giant cemetery
The illusion's to believe
That we can't get out of this place
When we only leave the grave

Wait a minute my son
I'll make your dream come true
You' re nothing but a pawn
You' re in my hands now

Now I can't believe my eyes
Has he heard my voice
This so familiar shadow
Coming from the fog

Thanks my God, show me now
