Looking for a sign
Just can't remember
Walking the line
Between life &amp; death
Smelling the flesh
An incense of sacrifice

He talks of a time
That wasn't my life
He reads in my mind
Things I could deny
Is it a crime?
Am I really the chosen one?

Here in the dark
Sounds behind me like gun shots
There in the mark
I can read "The End"

She talks about lies
Of all those past days
She reads in my eyes
How fed up I was
For her it's a deal
No pain no more change in my life

Here in the dark
Sounds behind me like gun shots
There in the mark
I can read "The End"

[Chorus]
When I entered the darkness
I saw the merciless man
He said "Come on, take my hand..."
"Welcome to my wonderland"

When I feel into the darkness
This old man, that some call madness
Just said "Hey! Bring me some heads!"
"Welcome to my wonderland"

I'm looking for a sign
I just can't remember
It smells here like sacrifice
Welcome to my wonderland

Here in the dark
Sounds behind me like gun shots
There in the mark
I can read "The End"
