I will be more like a tiger
My instinct is my way to survive
The music of sex running into my head
So long ago... all those bodies
It was the taste of liberty
Freedom and justice for all

If you've got the power and money
You will be the king
Of their whole world
So you can crush parasites
Smile and you're really respected
This is your vision of pleasure
Slaves imploring their god

[Chorus:]
See you back in Hell
I promise you one thing now
See you back in Hell
I promise you one thing now
Now it's your time
Now in the flames
Now in your eyes, you don't now
In the flames
Fear's your worst enemy
In the flames
In my eyes you'll discover
Inside me, the Devil inside me
You cry and you scream
Face the Devil inside me
The Devil inside me
You cry and you scream
Face the Devil inside me

When you're buried six feet under
You wont have any more power
Me and you, just face to face
In that place
I'm the master of time and space
You will discover my secret
See all the monster can secrete

[Chorus]
