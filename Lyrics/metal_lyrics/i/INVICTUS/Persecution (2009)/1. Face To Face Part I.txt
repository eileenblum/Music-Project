Face to face, war in my eyes
Not for oil, to save my skin
Face to face, face the truth
One: you win, two: I lose
I can implore, implore your name
Poison's running in my veins

Face to face, absurd illusion
Scarcely born, your mind is lost
Fight the face of your terror
Fight the face of your nightmares
I can implore, implore your name
Poison's running in my veins

Fight, welcome to my Hell
And just one more face in the crowd
Look at you
With a bitter heart
I wonder: is life a fight?
Is death the final victory?
Victory, my victory...

Face to face, war in my eyes
Not for oil, to save my skin
I remember the pain in your eyes
Face to face. Face the truth
One: you win, two: I lose
Remember it's a fixed fight
I can implore, implore your name
In my veins

Face to face, absurd illusion
Scarcely born, already lost
Your destiny is gnawing your mind
Fight the face of your terror
Fight the face of your nightmares
Can't you see this is the answer
I can implore, implore your name
Poison's in my veins

Welcome to my Hell
Just one more face in the crowd
Look at you
With a bitter heart
I wonder: is life a fight?
Is death the final victory?
Victory
Just one more face
Face in the crowd
Welcome to my Hell
Just one more face in the crowd
Look at you look at me
With a bitter heart
It's bitter life to fight
And I don't wanna fight
The final victory
My victory.
