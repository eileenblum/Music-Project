It's a time of dark sadness
See the world is mad
How God could bless us now
So many are starving
The world came in the night
Entered the night of times
No more place for dreams
Killing for a dose
Men became worse than animals
Easier to win wars
Than to fight for peace

[Chorus:]
Open your eyes to the eclipse of the world
In the sea of lost reason
Can't you feel what we've already achieved
The point of no return?
The burning of the world
It's so real, it's so real

It's a time of dark sadness
See the world is mad
How God could bless us now
So many are starving
The world came in the night
Entered the night of times
No more place for dreams
Killing for a dose
Men became
Worse than animals
Easier to win wars
Than to fight for peace

[Chorus]
