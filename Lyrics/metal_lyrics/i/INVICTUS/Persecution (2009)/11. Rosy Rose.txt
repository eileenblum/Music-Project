The only dust of light
In this tunnel of my life
A tiny handful of love
In this river... of nightmares
Hands up to the sky
Screaming my bitterness
You don't hear me where you are, you are...
Life's not easy, it's not easy, without you
Life's not easy, it's not easy
Better for me to die

[Chorus:]
Save me [x3]
kill me [x2]

You were the only one who told me:
"Yes I know!"
I fell into your eyes, then I grew
I could only stand by you, &amp; my gun
Life's not easy, it's not easy, without you

[Chorus]

like a red rose growing in... the wilderness
The sun after the rain, my last hope
It's burned up with your soul
Oh my dear!
Life's not easy, it's not easy, without you
