Silence...
Do you know why?
They killed the dogs
They called them dogs
Killed the dogs
But they say I'm not human
Shame on them
I don't know why
They treat me like a dust
Dust of man
I remember
I can feel their batons beating in my head
Sometimes when I'm lonely
I can feel their blood in my veins *
Killed the dogs
But they say...
Killed the dogs
But they try...
They killed the dogs
Please tell me more
I wonder why
Please tell me why
I sometimes hear
Bombs exploding loudly... in my head
I can see
In your tired eyes
Like a leaf of fear, no more tears...

[* Harry S. Truman, 33rd president.
Truman issued this warning to Japan urging surrender in a radio address to the American people on August 9, 1945.]

"The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.
We won the race of discovery against the Germans.
We have used it in order to shorten the agony of war, in order to save the lives of thousands and thousands of young Americans.
We shall continue to use it until we completely destroy Japan's power to make war."
