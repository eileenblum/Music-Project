Engraving circles with my feet
These cuts display the way they treat me
Nothing can stop my running
Down into the concrete.... I flee
I can't feel their baton blows
The pain is in my head
(I'm the black ship of society)

I plunge my nails into the stone
I count the days with drops of blood
Nothing can stop my running
Only clutching clouds of smoke... I flee

I can't feel their baton blows
The pain is in my head
Can't feel the burning cold steel
Blood flowing in my veins

Killed the dogs
But they say I am not human
Shame on them
I don't know why
Why they treat me like a dust
I wonder why
They killed the dogs
But they say I am not human
They call them dogs
They treat me like a dust
They killed the dogs
I can feel their batons beating
In my head
They call them dogs
I can feel their blood
And poison in my veins

[Chorus:]
Killed the dogs, killed the dogs
But they say I am not human
Killed the dogs, killed the dogs
But they say they've done no crime

Engraving circles with my feet
These cuts display the way they treat me
Nothing can stop my running
Down into the concrete.... I flee
I can't feel their baton blows
The pain is in my...

[Chorus]
