Some bang their heads against the walls
I'm far away
Screws bang their batons on the bars
I try to turn my mind a blank

This presence already inside me
I reach a place they'll never find
I'm gripped inside with anger
Silence is my only friend

You are my only....

I see a distant skyline
Of a place I'll never be
The great escape I dream of
I'll find it in the chair

Danger, Anger,
Black and Devil

[Chorus:]
I can feel it inside me
I can feel a taste of death
I can feel it inside me
I can feel I'm going mad

My days will not be ended
By lowly suicide
They treat me like a monster
But I keep my secret pride

Anger, anger
Black and Devil

[Chorus]

I see a distant skyline
Of a place I'll never be
The great escape
I dream of
I'll find it in the chair [x4]

[Chorus]
