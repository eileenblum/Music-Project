Drug
The message
The last I wanna send into my blood
Into my arms
Through my veins
You are, I am yours
This sand, Angel dust
The waves of a haunted life
There's no way out for me
The sun, burning my heart
My head is made of black stone
And I just cannot feel you anymore

[Chorus:]
God, pain and me
Are so strange
God, pain and me
Like strangers

Your eyes, open your heart
Enjoy this tragedy
What would you give for me?
Oh... time, I give you my mind
I sell my soul to you now
My never ending hope to stay alive

[Chorus]
