I was born about forty years ago
Out of the blue under a red hot scorching sun
The labyrinth of an ordinary life
So dumb I am the guardian of the jail
Day after day, night after nightmare

All my friends know they are under my control
This cigarette is not the last one I will smoke
This chair is not the place where I will die
I will wake up with a beating heart

[Chorus:]
So many Demons
And they're living in my mind
Demons and they're preying on my brain
So many Demons
And they're ruining my life
Demons, they're driving me insane
Forever. You feel in my mind [x2]

Every body has a dark secret to hide
Once upon a crime
In the black heart of my past
Everybody wants to heal their scars of sorrow
I want a better world for my children
The demons from the depth of my soul
Burn my heart and my mind

[Chorus (x2):]
Demons, they're driving me insane
In the moonlight
where you are
they're living in my mind
You're eating me alive
You're killing me inside
Can I get away
