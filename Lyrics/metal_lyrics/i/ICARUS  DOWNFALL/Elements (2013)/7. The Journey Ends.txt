My bags are packed
No goodbye
No look back
I lead this ship into demise
This is where the journey ends

Now I am sailing into the clouds
Now I sail through the storm
So may the waves await me
To take me down
Shallows are calling for me

Now the tides are rising to the sky
And I am not afraid
Today I travel North
And leave the shore behind
Soon I will go down with my ship
And my soul has left for good

Now the tides are rising to the sky
And I will not look back
At least I find my peace
Let me sink
To the ground
Of the sea
My love

This is where the journey ends
The great wide ocean waits
Let the waves
Bring me down so that there will be no one who can find me
In the ice cold depths

Who finds me in the depths
And so I travel on
Today I'll find my peace
Today I will rest
Beneath the sharks
Water will will my lungs

I lead this ship into demise
This is where the journey ends
I lead this ship into demise
This is where the journey ends
I lead this ship into demise
This is where the journey ends
I lead this ship into demise
Have a nice day.
