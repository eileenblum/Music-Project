More death
No regrets
More lies
No one forgets
Life has no meaning
In this game that they play
We have no voices
But there's so much to say

Struggle for power
War
Personal gains
War
Political talk
War
For no reason at all
War

"Why can't all fighting and bloodshed stop?
Innocent people are suffering
My husband and two children have been killed in this war
And now I am all alone"

Blinded by heritage
War
Destined for nowhere
War
Blood for blood
War
For no reason at all
War
