Disorder
Chaos
This age shall perish
Blackened have the skies turned

Hollow screams
Echo with pain
Lessons this world
Never learned

Disorder
Chaos
This age shall perish

Praise to the world spoken in anger
Festive pagans chant forbidden
Reasons why I can't try their senseless lies
Why I've summoned to hear their cries

Is there hope amid the ruins?

Is there hope for the ruins?
Where this conflict dwells
Will these shadows disappear?
In the lands I once knew

Deprived of human spirit
Torn by confusion
Losing my mind to war
Will tears promise my vision?
