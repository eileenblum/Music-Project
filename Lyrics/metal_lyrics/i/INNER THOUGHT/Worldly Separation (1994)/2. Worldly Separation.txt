[Sadzak]

Temperamental state we're in
Daily fight for our life begins
No weekly income means starvation
Taken prisoner by our nation

Across the seas the war is still strong
Too many people feel they don't belong
A wordly separation of the heart
By countless leaders these things start

They will never feel your sorrows
They never feel your pain
They will rob you til you bleed
Then they'll throw you away

They will never see your children
They will never hear them cry
They will never have to answer
When your children ask why.
