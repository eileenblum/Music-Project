[Murray/Sadzak]

God is all you need they say
No money, lust or greed
But how can I believe
In something I've never seen

Roman Catholic priests we trust
Thank god for little boys
But they are being raped
Just to cure their erotic joy

Evangelists across the states
Are makeing elders poors
Hungry sick and penniless
Just to get through heaven's door

We are being taught
Religion is the only way
That may be true to you
Believe in yourself
what can you do

On your kness and pray
For he is watching your sins confess

The Arabs and Muslims
are fighting in Lebanon
They are gods people
Soon there will be none

It's time for all you people
to start thinking for yourselves
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
Put that book back on the shelf
