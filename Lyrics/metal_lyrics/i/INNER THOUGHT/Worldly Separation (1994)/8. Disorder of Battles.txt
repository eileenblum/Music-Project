[Baloq/Sadzak]

Disorder
Chaos
This age shall perish
Blackened have the skies turned

Hollow screams
Echo with pain
Lessons this world
Has never learned

Disorder
Chaos
this age shall perish
Praise to the world spoken in anger
Festive pagans chant forbidden
Reason why I can't try their senseless lies
Why I've summoned to hear their cries
Is there hope amid the ruins?

Is there hope for the ruins
where this conflict dwells
Will the shadows disappear
On the lands on this Earth

Deprived of human spirit
Torn by confusion
Losing my mind to war
Will the tears promise my vision
