[Baloq/Coucke]

Cursed by the sins of others
Shedding blood to the ground
Fed on the pains of martyrs
the sorrows of the old remain

Distorted envisionments as seen before
Viewed through the eyes of the dead
Atrocity of relentless toil, Rivers of blood once bled
Face the land I've once known
Murder rules this place of till
Humanities existence overthrown
Fisted in blood I have killed
