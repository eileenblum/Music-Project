[Sadzak]

Devastation of homes, dreams and lives
Caught in a terrified state of mind
This has been presence
of an evil soul

Only ruins stand before me
As I look at the pale grey
Can this be happening to me
As I stand frigid with fear

Storms
Let loose by natures wrath

Winds Set free from unearthly desires

Grounds
More with magnific force

These things will never end
These things we cannot avoid

Lost are all the things I worked for
All the time and precious sentiment
Most of all I miss my only one
Lost are all the things I worked for

Only ruins stand before me
As I look at the pale grey
Can this be happening to me
As I stand frigid with fear
