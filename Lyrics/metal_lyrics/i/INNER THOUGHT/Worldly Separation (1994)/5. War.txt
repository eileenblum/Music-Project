[Sadzak]

More death
No regrets
More lies
No one forgets
Life has no meaning
In this game that they play
We have no voices
But there is so much to say
Struggle for power
War
Personal gains
War
Political talk
War
For no reasons at all
War

[Female vocals:]
Why can't all fighting and bloodshed stop
Innocent people are suffering
My husband and two children have been
killed in this war and
Now I am all alone

Blinded by heritage
War
Destined for nowhere
War
Blood for blood
War
For no reasons at all
War
