[Baloq/Murray]

This hell on Earth now invides her home
Innocent victims become tortured souls
Their minds are wieded in constant fear
All are part of his master plan

The bottle brings his anger on
treads on toes or feel his wrath
He is hurting you the pain is real
this is not life its only death

Female vocals:
My life has been drowned in sorrow
History repeats itself
Innocent views now lost forever
this will never happen again

Looks at you and sees only red
The colour of hate personified
feeling hopelessness knowing of his trap
the dread you feel may never leave your soul

Nightmares have destroyed the American dream
Trapped inside but your body can't leave
Set me free
Set me free
