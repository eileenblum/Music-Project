[Murray]

A world full of hunger
Peace unknown
Is this what we want
Disease infected Earth

Hatred spawns violence
Sacrilegious traits
Bred among our children
Disease infected Earth

Mechanical resonance
Technical brilliance
Human discompassionance
Disease infected Earth

Mechanical resonance
Techinacal brilliance
Human discompassionance
Disease infected Earth

Twisted, Beyond, Human, Reality
A world full of hunger
Peace unknown
Is this what we want
Disease infected Earth

Man's own existence
Built upon destruction
Is this what we want
Disease infected Earth
Twisted, Beyond, Human, Reality
