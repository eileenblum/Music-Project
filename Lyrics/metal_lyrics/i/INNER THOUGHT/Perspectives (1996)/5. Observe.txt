Take away my eyes
Don't want to see
Shut away my ears
Can't stand to hear the screams

I've become desensitized
Can't sift the truth out of the lies
Don't understand what's happening to me
When will I finally realize

I've become desensitized
Scope of reality decays
I've seen enough
Please turn it off
Lost like an orange
Caught in the works of this clock

This is a disease, you want to dissect
I won't submit to you, full up of the test

My mind is cracking, a ten ton test
I must push upward, never let it rest

Push me ever further, shove, pobe, and prod.
I'm your humbloe servant, hold my life for me lord

Please, shut off the box
I'll hold my breath, 'til I turn blue
A suicide in venin
Blamed on you
