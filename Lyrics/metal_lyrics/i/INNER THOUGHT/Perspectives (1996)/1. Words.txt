Nailed to a facade
Deny it all
Projection producted
Intense flogging of the mind

I'm shiftless, never moving
Shiftless, no emotion
Shiftless, hoiw can I
Attempt to find your solution

It's not that I can't bear the pain
I just don't want to
I've got my own shit to solve
Why should I care about you too

I'm shiftless, never changing
Shiftless, no emotion left

You can't even begin to understand
Just how I feel
Don't bother to hold the facade of being real

Intimidation, force
My will, lies broken
