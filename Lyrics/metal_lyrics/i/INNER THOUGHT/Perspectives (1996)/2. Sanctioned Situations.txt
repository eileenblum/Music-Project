Open your minds, and listen
Open your eyes to see
Please put a stop to this madness
Os is this the end of society

Sanctioned situations
Bring suffering to humanity
Political powers, incompetence
Destroy's the life in us

Why - Do we live in death
Why - Are we crying in hunger
Why - is life so disposable
Why - does the end seem near
Natural disasters occur
Subconscious minds brought forth
Why must we die in vein
With the end of a million lives

Socialism, Despises enterprise
There's nothing left to gain
Cold war may be over
But the battle for earth begins

Reality, has now sunk in
Fear is what you fear
Day by day, we rot away
The end cometh near
