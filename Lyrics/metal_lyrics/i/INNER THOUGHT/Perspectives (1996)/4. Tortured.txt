My pain, your gain, pleasures your when I rot inside
This past, can't be, I've swallowed my foolish pride
Left me, so scarred, you saw things that could not be
Deep in, your mind, your eyes are blind to reality

You left me tortured...

Subliminal, so criminal, your anger cries behind closed doors
Contemp, despair, can't live like we did before
You have, no feelings, you can't accept the way I live
I lose, you win, forced to struggle with a bitch

You left me tortured...

Your dreams, your life
Your soul is mine
Those things I'll take
They have no meaning

Like a flame that slowly fades
Your time has gone
Your time has gone

We've been addicted to your waste
You're sending me to an early grave
You fucked my life beyond despair
Destroyed my soul, laughing all the time

Never has my passion been returned
I thought you loved me, but I was wrong
So alone I sit in a blood red room
Lights out, as I construct my doom

I came, you went, this world  around me has no place
I trust, you lie, uyou leave me full of disgrace
My dreams, my screams, my coil it breeds vitality
My body, and soul, are trapped here in imortality
You left me tortured, mentally tortured, you left me tortured
