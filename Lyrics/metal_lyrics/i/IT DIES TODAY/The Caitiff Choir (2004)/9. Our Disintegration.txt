This sense of cynicism will eat me alive,
Long before the waking dead will ever get their chance.
For I'd sooner litter the earth with our corpses,
Then allow them to dine upon this flesh.

[chorus:]
I must convey,
In this life nothing can last forever.

Will you fly with me tonight?
I promise you towards the heavens.
And as we gaze down from this midnight's sky,
I'd laugh and say they almost seem to be so lucid.

[chorus]

An amaranth shall mark our tombs,
For this love's eternal.
I beg of you my only saving grace.
Please take my life tonight, let's disintegrate.

[chorus]

This love, it is eternal.
Even in death it will not fade.
