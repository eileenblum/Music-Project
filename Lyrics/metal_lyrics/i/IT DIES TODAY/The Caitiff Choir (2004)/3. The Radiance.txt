This room is stark and this bed is unfamiliar.
My only company tonight is this tattered photograph,
Which simply serves as a reminder of everything that I have lost.

[chorus:]
The radiance of the stars in the sky seems meaningless.
Without your pictures in my mind to reflect their images it's meaningless.
Until you open up your eyes and turn away.

I long for sleep so that I may visit you in my dreams tonight.
It seems to be the closest that I come to catch their glow in your eyes.

[chorus]

I wish I could just stop missing you,
But you're all I have that gives all the meaning to the beauty in the sky.
The radiance, it's meaningless.

[chorus]

The radiance, it's meaningless.
Until you open up your eyes and turn away.
