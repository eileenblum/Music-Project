Surrender and know I've failed you.
Now let the darkness swallow you whole.
Nothing could ever compensate,
For what I've done to you.
Tell me, is there any recollection of a time,
Before the abhorrent smell of death,
Masked all the sugary scents of springtime...
And these apparitions led me astray,
Into the bowels of perdition?

[chorus:]
Together, we created a world of sunlight:
Darkness fell, as we walked away.

Before an individual so cavalier, yet so depraved,
Laid you down upon the shores of Acheron.
Before we became immersed in iniquity.

[chorus]

And as we walked away,
The sky, it seemed to turn to black.
We did create an environment that's oh so dolent,
But I'd give anything to change these memories
Back to reality and return us to the light.

[chorus]

Surrender, and know I've failed you.
Now let the darkness swallow you whole.
Nothing could ever compensate,
For what I've done to you.
Now walk away and end our days.
