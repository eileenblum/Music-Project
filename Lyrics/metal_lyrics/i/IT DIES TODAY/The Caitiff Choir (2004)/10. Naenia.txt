Ignite the funeral pyre,
And let's close the casket lid on everything.
On this institution and on every memory burn it all in effigy.
Let's watch it burn.

[chorus:]
Fell into the depths of a broken heart again,
And I'll die alone, but I get lost in your eyes,
And I can't help but feel like I'll never find love there again.

Dressed in white you mourned nothing,
As you led the precession with a smile.
There was no eulogy given,
For no kind words could be conjured up this time.
No not a single word of praise had escaped from your lips.
On that day, there was no more need
To conjure up things that made things seem OK.

[chorus]

As you walk on, ash falls like snow.
Can you express regret?  Or just let a smile show.
Please just walk on.
Don't respond, I already know.

[chorus]
