Aesthetic perfection has fooled me once again.
You'll always be the only one who feels like home.
And with your hollow words and your plastic smile,
You have the most beautiful name I've ever cursed.
Yet I wait for you to find your way into my arms.

[chorus:]
And I'd wait here till you find your way.
I would wait here all my life,
I'd spend the rest of my days praying
For an end to this mystery.

Through this dichotomy has brought me to my knees.
You'll always be the only one who feels like home.
And still the season's change and with it does your charm.
Summer's end has come and with it misery.
Yet I wait for you to find your way into my arms.

[chorus]

You must find a way back into my arms again,
I'd give anything just to feel that warmth again.

[chorus]
