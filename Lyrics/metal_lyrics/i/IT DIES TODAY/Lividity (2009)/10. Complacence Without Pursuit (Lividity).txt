Your stagnant truth, this buried youth
Wake up wrought with atrophy
Your scars will heal
Take my hand, I'll guide you through
Strip your thoughts of this treacherous road
I'll bring you home

Your heart beats with shallow depth
Lividity is certain
Still breathing with shallow breaths
Your failing wish dissolves

Carve your niche
You'll scream your name
You'll follow with no avail
Clawing through the sediment you'll be corrupt no more
Pressure unnerving, clutching you closer

[Chorus]

Your pulse weak this darkened day
This crushing calm to the back of your head

[Chorus]

Failing...
Your heart stopped beating
Tragedy...
Of life worth saving
Grasping...
I'll hold you closer
Gasping...
This one last breath
