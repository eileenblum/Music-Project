Take these shards of meaning
Extact all your precious lies
Buried deep inside

Empty cavity that conveys your nihility
Precocious smile and state
It's your vaccant stare and amorous gaze

Nothingness of your world consumes
Expressing the vile abandonment
All that is precious and good
Has it been lost or merely forgotten?

Take blackened hearts that you forsake
Press these words...
Understand that the pain you don't feel
Holds you back again

This harsh reality still must be addressed much too soon
With this copious disregard for this at all

Negligence as your personal best
Your foul palm and fingers, not delicate enough
For this pure body trusting of your touch

[Chorus]

Reflux and distress...
Not meaning an thing
But breaking you down...
Complete disdain

[Chorus]
