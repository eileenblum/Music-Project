This avenue, this home takes everything but gives back solitude
A proud departure from the rigors of a mundane breath
Expelled from the depths of a blackened sea
Expelled from the lungs of a gasping child

Strangled with a noose
Benign of provocative engagement
Coursing through these veins is the will to persue the unthinkable,
The diligence of so many before us

To achieve this reverie
The only way because we chose this...

Life of uncertainty
With this life of uncertain means
We can still believe and face change in a life of uncertainty
Life of uncertain means

A collapsed paradise, laid waste to the masses
The ample saturation almost
Choking the life out of us
But enough air to breathe through this permeated dream

We extort respect and honesty,
But guile and cunning require our defenses

Evoking our purpose and objectives
Forming this alliance that shapes and molds without discretion
Our intuition

[Pre-chorus &amp; chorus]

Calling out with steadfast senses
Possessing all the answers that are questioned
And revised until the end of time
Worth and want tested with an action of advocation
Describing our fate and delicate delivery...
Of this hate

[Pre-chorus &amp; chorus]
