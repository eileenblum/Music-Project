I'm calling last call
You're still intoxicating
Lies and deceit used like a fist (of cowardice)
Cornered and battered
You'll burn every bridge before too long
While your self respect is gone

Lay your head down
There's nothing left for you here
Lay your head down

Suspended in a revolving door of the blind
Of all these faceless acquaintances
Which will take the place of us
Only time will tell (only time)
This undeniable truth shall be known
The meek shall inherit the earth
And the weak shall...

Lay their heads down
There's nothing left for them here
Lay your head down

Absolve your veil of lies, dishonesty and pride
Reveal your rightful self
With the scourge of a thousand voices

With the scourge of a thousand voices
And the rapture of these legions ignite
We'll see you in hell
