I wanna breathe you in, senses realized
At first sight, this day imagined... waiting
Wanting for so long
Gaining this long lasting epiphany
A dream well within my grasp

Laid out for me to follow
But with every intention is fulfilled
I wanna breathe you, in senses realized
At first touch my veins are on fire
This can't be real, could not be absolute
Unfeigned feeling of compassion
Rises through the pores of my skin

Before us, for us
This collapse holds true
Before us, for trust
Faith in this renewed
