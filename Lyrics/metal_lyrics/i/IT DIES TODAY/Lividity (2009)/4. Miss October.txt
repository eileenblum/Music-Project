To all that's safe, our memories
Our justified angst
So consumed with no escape

Just time to wait
Bury our distress to console
Isolated, we let out self denial

A faint memory of a fall left black
Only three words left to say:
I fail you

I'll pay my respects with what I have left
We're so close to home, yet we're falling apart at the seams
And memories guiding us to sleep

Call your name
It's been so long
It falls on deaf ears
Tragic failed attempt at redemption

Photographs discarded, re-emerge
Only to throw me deeper still
Into remorse and regress, two years ago
And these familiar places are becoming foreign

[Pre-chorus &amp; chorus]

[Solo]

Nothing is safe, not memories or visions of you
So confused with no escape

Only three words left to say:
I fail you

[Chorus]

Guiding us to sleep...
