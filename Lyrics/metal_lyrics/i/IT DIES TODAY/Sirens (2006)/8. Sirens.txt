Pessimism aside, I'll search to the edge of the earth just to find the,
Enchantment of her voice in perfect rapture.
Steered by the sound of persuasive song, seeking absolution
With tears to match my plaintive woes, we'll create our own truths.
Through these timeless fables, for this I've waited so long.

The fates have spun a noose, it seems,
Please siren set me free,
And ravish me with seraphic song.

Seduction leaves the lips of the exquisite siren (exquisite siren).
Attired in white, leaving me in a asphyxiated reverie.
Can we re-write history, we'll create our own truths.
Develop an ending without you drowning in the black depths.

The fates have spun a noose, it seems,
Please siren set me free,
And ravish me with seraphic song.
With each note and word I fell victim to the sound of her,
Resplendence personified.

Set me free,
Siren, set me free, free, free.

The fates have spun a noose, it seems,
Please siren set me free,
And ravish me with seraphic song.
With each note and word I fell victim to the sound of her,
Resplendence personified.

Oh, siren, set me free,
Siren, set, siren, set me free.
Ravish my with seraphic song
