Been waiting for an end in a life filled with all those little stories.
(Say what you want, say what you need)
Our last encounter,
(Say what you want, say what you need)
Still stings like alcohol,
And all the stones and prison bars that stood in the way of my amends.
Forgive me.

I know you killed for me, you're sailing with the rock, Aileen.
Promise you'll come for me, the sixth of June will bring you home.
Say what you want, say what you need,
Cause tonight is your last chance to reach me.

Hope and love seem to,
(Say what you want, say what you need)
Be a waste in this mortal reality.
So we'll meet again on the sixth of June.
There won't be a heart to break this time.
And all the souls of fallen men won't stand in the way of our love again.
Forgive me.

I know you killed for me, you're sailing with the rock, Aileen.
Promise you'll come for me, the sixth of June will bring you home.
Say what you want, say what you need,
Cause tonight is your last chance to reach me.

I know you killed for me, you're sailing with the rock, Aileen.
Promise you'll be there on the sixth of June, our lord will guide you home.
Say what you want, say what you need,
Cause tonight is your last chance to reach me.
I know you killed for me, you're sailing with the rock, Aileen.
Promise you'll come for me, the sixth of June will bring you home.
Say what you want, say what you need,
(I know you killed for me, I know you killed for me)
Say what you want, say what you need,
(I know you killed for me, say what you need)
Cause tonight is the last chance to reach me
