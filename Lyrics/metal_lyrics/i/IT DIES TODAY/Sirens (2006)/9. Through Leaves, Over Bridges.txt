And so it erodes, from my septum to a numbed aorta,
Yet I longed to run as I watched you grow smaller,
And finally fade into the long perspective.

This time you won't be calling out,
So I'll keep on longing, keep on longing,
As you keep on walking.
I longed to run.

We'll never walk together through leaves and over bridges,
To the sound of bells ringing out from that lone tower.

Steps strive towards,
Yet broken limbs keep this child where he lies,
Awol and choking on the bitter taste of desperation,
The leaves still turn.

This time you won't be coming back.
A lifetime of longing, a lifetime of longing,
We all saw it coming.
I longed to run.

We'll never walk together through leaves and over bridges,
To the sound of bells ringing out from that lone tower.
We'll never walk together through leaves and over bridges,
To the sound of bells ringing out from that lone tower.

Remember me from time to time (from time to time)
And all I'd sacrifice in my life to share just one last walk with you.
Remember me, remember virtue (from time to time)
Remember me, remember me.

This time you won't be calling out,
So I'll keep on longing, as you keep on walking.

I won't fade away, I won't fade away.
I won't fade away, I long for another day.
I won't fade away, I long for another day.
I won't fade away, I long for another day.
I won't fade away, I long for another day
