How's the air up there with the faithless and aborted souls,
And when the worms carried it away,
Did you cry, did you feel, did you see me pray?
To gods and demons all alike, to those who would lend an ear that night,
Three thousand miles high, these wayward wanderers fly.
Halfway to heaven, yet a stones throw from hell.
Through infinite sorrow soars our exquisite belle.

Turn loose the doves and marvel at their flight with fractured wings.
Turn loose the doves and listen to the mourning chorus start to sing,
Anthems of loss, all for you, they are all for you,
My muse, I never wanted this to fall, this to fall apart.

Choke on the air up there, from the acid and reviled clouds,
And when we glance down upon our shrine,
There's no viol, violet, and no vine.
Nor rays from holy heaven bright,
Sweet muse, how far have we strayed from this guiding light?
We strayed from this light.
Halfway to heaven, yet a stones throw from hell,
Through infinite sorrow soars our exquisite belle.

Turn loose the doves and marvel at their flight with fractured wings.
Turn loose the doves and listen to the mourning chorus start to sing,
Anthems of loss, all for you, they are all for you,
My muse, I never wanted this to fall, this to fall apart.

Scarlet drenched and song less birds, deliver us from the underworld.
Scarlet drenched and song less birds, deliver us from the underworld.

Halfway to heaven, yet a stones throw from hell.
Through infinite sorrow soars our exquisite belle.

Turn loose the doves and marvel at their flight with fractured wings.
Turn loose the doves and listen to the mourning chorus start to sing,
Anthems of loss, all for you, they are all for you,
My muse, I never wanted....
Anthems of loss, all for you, they are all for you,
My muse, I never wanted this to fall, this to fall apart
