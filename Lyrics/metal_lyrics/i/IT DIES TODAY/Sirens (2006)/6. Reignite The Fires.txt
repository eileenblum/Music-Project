These bones are brittle and fragile to the touch.
Farewell, the dear departed.
Bury all vices and these tired metaphors,
Before our time is over.
The chest aches and swells though in eternal sleep, in eternal sleep.
Fret not, my dear, we'll meet again at Saint Peter's gates.
Reignite the fires in this frigid heart of mine,
Wake me from this slumber.

But it was circumstance that was flirting with disaster,
And destiny was sharing your bed.
Welcome the discontented and fix this sorry soul,
With tactfulness and grace.

The end starts a new cycle of pain, never-ending pain.
In time, you'll see the destroyer of all that's holy.
Reignite the fires in this frigid heart of mine,
Wake me from this slumber.

But it was circumstance that was flirting with disaster,
And destiny was sharing your bed.
Welcome the discontented and fix this sorry soul,
With tactfulness and grace.

I'll surrender to flames you started and use them to light my way.
I'll remember the thrill of romance, as long as you light my way.

But it was circumstance that was flirting with disaster,
And destiny was sharing your bed.
Welcome the discontented and fix this sorry soul,
With tactfulness and grace.

But it was consequence, just promise to light my way.
But it was consequence, come on, just promise to light my way.
But it was consequence, yeah, it was consequence
