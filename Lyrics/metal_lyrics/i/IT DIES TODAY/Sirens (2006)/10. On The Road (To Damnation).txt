Through the shadow of night, the lost and the sullen,
Pariahs ignite the skies, leaving our worlds behind,
Pillaging life beneath a western sky.

Not one soul to spare, falling to their knees,
Praying to idols who are no more than vagrants spreading disease.
But we're just feeding the frenzied, luring them in and quenching an insatiable,
Thirst for the grim and despairing, grim and despairing lay.

We're on the road to damnation, upon horses pale we ride,
Plaguing the earth everlasting, as the hounds of hell do bite.

Through the piles of flesh, the damned and putrid,
These mavericks will now descend, leaving our brides behind,
Demoralize beneath a western sky.

Not one soul to spare, falling to their knees,
Praying to idols who are no more than vagrants spreading disease.
But we're just feeding the frenzied, luring them in and quenching an insatiable,
Thirst for the grim and despairing, grim and despairing lay.

We're on the road to damnation, upon horses pale we ride,
Plaguing the earth everlasting, as the hounds of hell do bite.

We're on the road to damnation, upon horses pale we ride,
Plaguing the earth everlasting, as the hounds of hell do bite.
We're on the road to damnation, upon horses pale we ride,
Plaguing the earth everlasting, as the hounds of hell do bite.
We're on the road to damnation, upon horses pale we ride,
Plaguing the earth everlasting, forever we will ride
