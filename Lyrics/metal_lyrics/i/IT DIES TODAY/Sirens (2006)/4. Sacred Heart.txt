From the gutter
The diamond seemed far too bright to see,
The gleaming eyes always tend to turn away,
Just turn away,
And every innocent wish, has granted tragedy,
And our hands have since been soiled in the blackest of coal

Most days I'd sit and wish for,
This place to fall into the bay,
Its greatest offense being thievery

A nightmare awakened by the boundless waters,
Will see a broken vow thrust
Into the arms of hellbound cowards,
And I've found,
The perfect accessory,
To that beautiful gown,
The handsome ghost of me

Most days I'd sit and wish for,
This place to fall into the bay,
Its greatest offense being thievery
And I
Will wash away the sins of former lovers,
A trail of stillborn conquest in my wake Tonight

Take this four-fingered salute,
I gave the fifth for you my dear,
May it beckon you to the salts below

Most days I'd sit and wish for,
This place to fall into the bay,
Its greatest offense being thievery
And I
Will wash away the sins of former lovers,
A trail of stillborn conquest in my wake Tonight

TONIGHT!

TONIGHT!
