We awoke in the midst of a vicious cycle,
Becoming the satellites whose transmissions are static served.
As of late, it seems my audience has been lacking.
I can only pray that you're tuning in during a moment of clarity,
Just to hear me utter these spiteful words before the signal fades.

Here's hoping this becomes the soundtrack to your misery,
The hook that rips right through your chest.
Enjoy this constant reminder of your fickle nature,
And the hideous facade you wear so well.

The crowd gasps in awe as my head began to swell,
And the whites of my eyes slowly turned, slowly turned to red.
Just then did gravity created such a dramatic end.
I can only pray that you're tuning in during a moment of clarity,
Just to hear me utter these spiteful words before the signal fades.

Here's hoping this becomes the soundtrack to your misery,
The hook that rips right through your chest.
Enjoy this constant reminder, my double standards,
And the hideous facade I wear so well.

The twilight, projects this message,
To a populous who's turned their backs.
The twilight, screen my words across the sky,
Look up in wonder.

Here's hoping this becomes the soundtrack to your misery,
The hook that rips right through your chest.
Enjoy this constant reminder of your fickle nature,
And the hideous facade you wear so well.
Enjoy this constant reminder, fade as we burn.
Enjoy this constant reminder, fade as we burn.
Enjoy this constant reminder, and the hideous facade you wear so well
