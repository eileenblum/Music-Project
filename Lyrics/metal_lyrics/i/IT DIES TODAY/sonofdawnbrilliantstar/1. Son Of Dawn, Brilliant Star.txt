Arisen, Son of Dawn
Evanescent paradise
Arisen, Brilliant Star
Spew forth your filth, your foul
It's a battle for ascension
To crown a serpent king
Glory to the wretched
The rebel angels sing
I keep on trying but I'm, blind in this light
I keep on trying but I'm, blind in this light
I keep on trying but I've...

[Chorus]
Been falling for far too long
it feels like the sanctity is all gone
Been falling, for far too long

There is no salvation
no hope, just hell's reign
proud be the wretched
the fallen angels sing
I keep on trying but I'm, blind in this light
I keep on trying but I'm, blind in this light
I keep on trying but I've...

[Chorus]
Been falling for far too long
it feels like the sanctity is all gone
Been falling, for far too long
This infliction is earned

[4x]
Arise, arise, the dawn of a new morning
Arise, arise, the dawn of a new morning
Cast down forsaken, liberated, blinded in this light, this sweet surrender

[Chorus]
Been falling for far too long
it feels like the sanctity is all gone
Been falling, for far too long
