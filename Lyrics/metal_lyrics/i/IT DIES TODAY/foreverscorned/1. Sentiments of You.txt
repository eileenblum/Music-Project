I feel the blood rushing up, the words from you like a blow to the sternum, I can't hold back now, my mouth is watering two fold, with the flavor of myself in the meaning, I lost my head again, where did we go wrong? my concern, I lost my head again, but this time the apology is written across your face with unhealed lacerations, as I choke on the things I wish I had said blame me and go ahead with your life as you always did, and force my stomach to purge the words I might have eaten in a victorious feast of self-indulgence. I simply lost my head again, I lost it all when I heard your voice in a tone like the storm that never strays, from the sepulcher I call my mind. Sentiments of you, they will never stray.
