Though your presence is nonexistent, your vile stench still looms in my every memory, you have planted a seed, that has sprouted, into an undying enmity, that shall rear its putrid face and micturate upon your apologies that you have delivered far too late, and the heavens collapsed to hell, creating a mestophilean being, that possessed you with a sense of depraved indifference. I wish I could have absolved you of the succubus, the one with fiery skin, and the unbecoming nature in which it clenched your mind. Was it I who thrust that blade through your back? Rethink this question, for it you self-destructed and let your perceptions distort. The most perplexing of those circumstances was how the cold steel found its way engorged in my flesh. Why have bothered making fraudulent amends? Now, I'd like to rip your still beating heart from its blackened cavity. I hope her mournful tears singe your gaping flesh wound and your black heart will be pounded to dust and whisked away in the wind, however I will always hold a place in mine for you and all the detestation your name brings. You set your bridges ablaze, and left them burning.
