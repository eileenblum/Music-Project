Blood spills from unhealed wounds, baleful afflictions devolved from you, the ones I love (I love), ripped from this world so young, the ones I love, they are walking corpses. I will not shed one more tear for you, and these sutures have yet to bind my flesh, I'll burn this idol in effigy of you, my prayers bemoan this love untrue. Know this, I've lost all compassion, she's cursed by her brooding, I will mar you father, as to cut through your mask of benevolence, and reveal your vile burden, I'll make you live with it, you'll live with this. And I will not shed one more tear for you, these sutures have yet to bind my flesh, I'll burn this idol in effigy of you, my prayers bemoan a love untrue. You took from me the ones I live for, the ones I'd die for (condemned so young). You took from me the ones I live for, the ones I'd kill for (condemned so young). Dream not of me. Let my words haunt you, rot with your lack of remorse, dream not of me. Know that I've lost all compassion, know that she's cursed by her brooding, and may I mar you father? as to cut through your mask of benevolence, and reveal your vile burden...I will watch you burn.
