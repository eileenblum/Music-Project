Kiss the dream good-bye, separation leaves a taste so bitter sweet and for years you have clawed away at my flesh, yet I still long to hear your voice and set my eyes upon your face so I may bash it to pieces and laugh as the ravens pick away at the fragments, the shadows they still haunt me and your self-pity is sickening when you are to blame for the love lost, your self-pity is sickening, you're to blame, for all the love you've lost, and the contempt, that consumes your life, you're to blame, so now you may kiss this dream good-bye, for all my hopes and wishes are for this earth to be drenched in your blood as it pours from the sky, the clouds spraying like a lacerated artery, I will marvel at its sheer beauty, for years you have clawed away at my flesh, yet I still long to hear your voice, only now do I see, my hatred will never cease, and you will never claw away at my flesh. Never again.
