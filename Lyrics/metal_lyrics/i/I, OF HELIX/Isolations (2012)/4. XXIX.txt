[feat. Rody Rodriguez]I hope that one day you'll come to realize
That there is a thin line between placing blame and procrastination
You've crossed that line for the last time

So modestly the clouds swallow
An eternity's everlasting and unchanging
Disease while the rest of the sky
Grows heavier without ever saying a word
All the while I see it was never in the mind it was all in the heart
These chains were rooted in love and devotions

Distained from what you were when we met
I promise you. I swear to God
And the man you know will never fade away, fade away
Will never fade away

We came from separate sides of the ocean
In search of strength and solitude

And in the end you'll see me stand tall
You choose the outcome now live with your decisions
Now that the world has come alive
I can see what you mean when you say what you've seen
Open your eyes and see

I'm burning your memory
Nothing seems to stay the same

Now all I can do is hope you're not sitting there
Praying for a day
That has long come to pass
I keep my eyes to the sky hoping for a better day.
Praying that it won't fade away, fade away

We came from separate sides of the ocean in search of strength
We came from separate sides of the ocean in search of strength
Now that it's inside us, now we must fly away
From separate sides of the ocean

This won't be the end
This won't be the end
This won't be the end
This won't be the end
