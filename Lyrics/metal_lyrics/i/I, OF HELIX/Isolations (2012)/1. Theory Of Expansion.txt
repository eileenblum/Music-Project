Watch as I run with all that I've made. Seeping and sprouting my roots. The memory fades moving in every direction. Is this a dream or a nightmare? I can't escape this now.

Please come back. I'll do anything.

Forget the ones you loved, they're all gone now (they're all gone they're all). Everything you've ever loved is all gone now. (It's all gone, it's all)...

This is the theory of expansion. You'll never know what it took. THEORY OF EXPANSION. Wake them up. Wake them...

Can I leave this world I've known? Will you be here? Will you be...here?

Come on this way. I'll save you.

Forget the ones you loved, they're all gone now (they're all gone they're all). Everything you've ever loved is all gone now. (It's all gone, it's all)...

Everything that you've loved is all fucking gone now.

Get outside of your head!
