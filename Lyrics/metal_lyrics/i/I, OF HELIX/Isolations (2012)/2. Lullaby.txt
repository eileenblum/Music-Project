Sing your song out loud.
I sing myself to sleep tonight.
Be proud; sing your song out loud.
I sing myself.
This is not, this is not...my home.

Congratulations,
Your biggest fan is a mislead
Reject begging for the love of his father.
With each passing day,
Your son is slipping further away.

How was I supposed to survive
Without a father on my side?
You had, no hand, in who I would become.
A selfish man on a selfish path,
Well here is the outcome.
Oh father, my father,
Where are you, where are you now?

Time and time again
I am reminded of the fact that you were never there.
Now I realize it was all for the best.

I am not alone!

Sing your song out loud.
I sing myself to sleep tonight.
Be proud; sing your song out loud.
I sing myself.

I have found my, I have found my, home!

I sing myself to sleep tonight
I sing myself to sleep tonight
I sing myself to sleep tonight
I sing myself to sleep tonight...
