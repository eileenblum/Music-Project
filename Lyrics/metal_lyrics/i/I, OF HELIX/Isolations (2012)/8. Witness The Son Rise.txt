I've come here for this life and all that it holds in its arms for me

Torn up and shattered I am reformed and battered
You know
Broken I have come here to settle the score
Between two opposing forces
And the thing that makes us real inside
I want to go back home

I am lost within the confines of my own mind
Entering a tailspin of my own mind
I am the emperor of a desolate society 
Waiting to collapse

Open up all that you've seen here and I'll find my way back to you I will find my way

Back to you
Back to me
Back to you
Back to me

Now that you're all alone
Tell me how it feels
You're no longer a ghost inside my home you are no more
YOU ARE NO MORE

Torn up and shattered I am reformed and battered
I am rebuilt from the ashes of a burning home
You will never know what you have created
Now it's time to witness the son

I've become everything that I hate and all that it embodies.

I've become everything that I hate and all that it embodies.
Everything that it embodies.
