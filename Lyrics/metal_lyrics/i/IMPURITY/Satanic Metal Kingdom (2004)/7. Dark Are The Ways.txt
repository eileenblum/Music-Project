Dark are the ways
But in the dark ways there is light
In the dark and endless deep there is light
For the blind men there is never light
The path's color is ever black, for the blind men
There in the dark world there is light, and fire

Everything is away, words, darkness and light
I enter the darkness path
I see the light, I have the light, solid dark and hard

As hard as the nails of the cross
As solid as the lances
That splintered the body of the fright
Dark are the ways, dark are the ways!!!
Winds for dark and flaming paths
Winds that will conduct vehement beams
Winds that blind men will neither see nor blow
Winds that the wead won't see
Winds that willonly light and darkness
Winds for dark and flaming paths
Winds dark are the ways!
