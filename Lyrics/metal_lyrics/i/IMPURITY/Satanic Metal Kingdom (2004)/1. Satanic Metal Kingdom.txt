We're left hand followers
Because Satan rule the earth
On command of the messenger of darkness
We begin our eternal ride
The obscurity doors are opening
Until we reach the abyss
We have to triumph on many spheres
Climb mountains of thoughts
"...and kill worthless gods"

We're young with the goat of thousand youngs
To seize the nymphs in the cities or in the woods
We're serpents and have to whistle
To agitate satanic metal kingdom
Satanic Metal Kingdom

This is the path for everyone
Satanic metal kingdom
But not everything is for this path
Satanic Metal Kingdom
