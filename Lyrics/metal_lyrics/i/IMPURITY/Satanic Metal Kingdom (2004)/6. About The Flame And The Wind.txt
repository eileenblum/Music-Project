In the origin the south
The flames prevails
It's the of life
That walks for millenniums
And extends it self to infinite
The wind comes from there
And unclasps in my mind
The light thought

Wind that blows strongly
That leads wisdom
Deciphered only by magicians
Wind in the dark or flaming path
Is supreme and ineffable
And beloved only by magicians

My thought
Self contemplates
The flame and the wind
It's the manifestation of lord of the south
