The disseminator of blasphemes
Cruelly upon the miserable who follow Christ
Creatures invade the world
Preaching lust
The world is now of satanas

Satanas consecrate the star of five spikes
Always on the inverted position
The chalice contained blood
The host was black

Hail the sign of the black goat
Hail the favourite of the lord

Oh Satan
Oh disseminator we want to preach your true world
Get over the impostors of the Nazarene cruch
Invocation of the world of horrors

Hail the sign of the black goat
Hail the favourite of the lord
Hail!!!
