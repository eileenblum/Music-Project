They are the eternal
Night fellows
They are upon the trees
Inside the caves
And in dark cities
They listen, sing, howl

In splendid harmony
With the voices of thunder

Ah, they are our brothers
In the name of creation

It is the wolf
With its a abominable cry
It is the bat
With its endless thirst
It is the owl
With is scary angry
It is the crow
Messenger of darkness
It is nature's arise
Oh, it is the man
Who awakens at midnight
In the philosophy of darkness

Ah, they are our brothers
In the name of creation
