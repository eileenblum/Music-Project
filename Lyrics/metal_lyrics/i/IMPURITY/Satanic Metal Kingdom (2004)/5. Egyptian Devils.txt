- Typon
Oh, supreme master, you are production of my oasis
You are the temple of wisdom in the desert of myself
In analogy to the beasts
I am the dog and the lion
To destroy the enemies of the sun

Egyptian devils

Great demon serpent
Born in the mysterious darkness
Who makes in tebas deep speech
To the equilibrium of the world

- Apophis
I have broke rules to know you
Oh, familiar genius, lion skin
Out of you, my universe won't be
In the palace of the three numbers

- Bess
Eternally, profound myself
In front of the columns, vae and amulets
I did rivals with my stick immersed

Egyptian devils
Egyptian devils with you ruling the universe
Oh, my hearth will never be desert
