What I want around myself
Is my will and my transcendent writs
At first I take the name of Satan
As a part of myself
Then I rule narcissus
And rejoice myself
On my wisdom that comforts me

Ah! Is the invisible dead or alive?
In this point of my thoughts
Just the world and my flesh estimate me
In the delights of a libertine light
I am equal to wine and cocaine

I am avid for the Antichrist verses
Because
I wan the common-submissive aways from me
I am avid for the ego
Because
I favour the power in the center of the earth
