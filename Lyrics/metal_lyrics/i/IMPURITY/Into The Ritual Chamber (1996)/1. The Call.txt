Come...
Come from the night
Come from the sea
With all the nymphs and satyrs
It's on me, on me
Oh, precious God
Existence aesthetics
Oh, Pan
Come
Strong as a Lion
Slender as a Serpent
Give me the opened eye Sign
And the word of madness and mystery
Come
With flute and fife
Whirling and smiling
Diving into the universe
O eternal lust and dance
I'm a man in the force of Pan
Oh, Pan
