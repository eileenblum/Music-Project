I hope the key
Analogous to the suffering and Scorn
Will never capture you
I hope the piety hall way you will never visit
I hope for you will never exist weeping
As it happened to the mother of frights
I hope you will be Belted by Pleasure
As the pistil
Is exposed to the Zephir
You are Scarlet
And your essence wants to Burn for endless delights
I hope you will arise with unlimited desires
I hope you will feel no shame
Before men
I hope you will be superb
Your Ineffable beauty
