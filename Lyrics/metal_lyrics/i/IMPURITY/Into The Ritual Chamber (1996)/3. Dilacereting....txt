You boys and girls who call yourselves Christians
In order to make sure
You're being slaughtered
By the slavery theogony
Your Gods, evasive, mute
Have no devotion
Neither will give you salvation
You boys and girls
You've got the beauty of the life of wine
Despise priests and shepherds
Of evasive promises
Despise rules of cults and liturgies
Now scream with me :
Dilacerate the Gospel
You boys and girls, "we're active"
And we've got an idea for you
Christ eats the weak
Quite slaughters them
Which cause is his
To gain the world ?
I invite you to scream one more time
And even a million times :
Dilacerate the gospel
