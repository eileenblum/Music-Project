Everything sick and weak dissipates
Dies that god
Whose law is humble
Disappear of god
Finally dissipates slave's fathers, slave and slavery

A sweet law arises
The sweet ecstasy law
An eloquent age arises

Under the sign of ecstasy
An anthropomorphic deity arises
It is the triumph of the ecstasy law
