Oh...Sekhmet may the mighty voices of vengeance
Come with fiery winds
Live in my flesh
May the breathen of vengeance turn me
To a machine of annihilation
To crush the body of my hostile
Oh...Sekhmet, oh...Sekhmet
You, living in obscurity,
Commanding the order to stab
Knowing the path of the vengeance
Throw your venomous iron of three spikes
Throw your burning glance(in the name bast)
And the points of spurs
Let my victim nailed to the wall of my vengeance
Oh...Sekhmet
