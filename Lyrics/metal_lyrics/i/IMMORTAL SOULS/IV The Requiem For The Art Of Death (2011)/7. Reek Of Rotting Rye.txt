I've been searching for something good in mankind,
Seek for wisdom in dim lantern light,
But all I see is misery.
While we feed our inborn greed;

Reek of rotting rye
Greed of rotting kind
Bless and break and part the bread
Give me what I need
Reek of rotting rye
Freed from human kind
Invest in the stock of greed
Give me my d je croisaily bread

From two small fish and five loaves of bread,
We could feed and treat a great group of men.
Poverty and misery
While we feast upon our greed;

Reek of rotting rye
Greed of rotting kind
Bless and break and part the bread
Give me what I need
Reek of rotting rye
Freed from human kind
Invest in the stock of greed
Give me my daily bread

Take the flesh of mind, for it is the bread of life.
A new covenant - do this in remembrance of me.
Take the blood of mind, for it is the wine of life.
A new covenant - do this in remembrance of me.

Reek of rotting rye
Greed of rotting kind
Bless and break and part the bread
Give me what I need
Reek of rotting rye
Freed from human kind
Invest in the stock of greed
Give me my daily bread
