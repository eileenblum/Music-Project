I stare the tombstone, the one with my name.
That stands in the rain.
The cold face of death, shape formed in a stain,
A delusion of my brain?

As the dark is rising and deeper is this night.
More distant becomes the light.

I'm falling into deepest veil of solitude.
Where lays one last withering rose.
I stray from divinity, to be triumphant once again.
I'll return with one last goodbye.

All the others are gone now, I am here alone,
I lean against this stone.

I wait in silence to what is bound to be.
I see it all before me.

I'm falling into deepest veil of solitude.
Where lays one last withering rose.
I stray from divinity, to be triumphant once again.
I'll return with one last goodbye.

One last;
One last withering rose...
One last;
One last goodbye...

I'm falling into deepest veil of solitude.
Where lays one last withering rose.
I stray from divinity, to be triumphant once again.
I'll return with one last goodbye.

One last;
One last withering rose...
One last;
One last goodbye...
