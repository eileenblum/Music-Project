Mother-I reach out for you,
As I lay upon this wait of godliness
I sigh for a while and wonder your holiness.

Brother-the fires upon our hearts,
Are brighter now than ever before.
It is the sign of the end, I see, as it becomes fulfilled.

Wounds in my hands, wounds in my feet;
Wound in my side, wound inside deep;
Wounds in my hands, in my heart, in my soul...

Father-why have you forsaken me?
I can't believe weight of this loneliness.
Still I ask of thee, to forgive them for
They don't know what they do.

Wounds in my hands, wounds in my feet;
Wound in my side, wound inside deep;
Wounds in my hands, in my heart, in my soul...

Wounds in my hand, wounds in my feet;
Wound in my side, wound inside deep;
Wounds in my hand, wounds in my feet;
Wounds in my flesh, wound in my soul;
Wounds in my hands, in my heart, in my soul...
In my flesh...In my soul...
