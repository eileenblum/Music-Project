Cold wind of north, the killers breathe.
I hear the thunder from somewhere far.
I feel the wave and scent of a grave.
As I see darkness spread on the sky.

Oh - Madness imperial, grave-town, dark side of human mind.
Oh - Kingdom millennial, grave-town of the atomic age.

(In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.)

After the fall - where do you crawl, when lights are dim.
After the sin - nuclear winter, bleak is the day and the end is nigh
After the fall - A new winter dawn.

Black trees sway in the cold breeze.
Landscape of my fragmented mind.
After a while this Autumn is gone.
And shades of winter bury the land.

Oh - Madness imperial, grave-town, dark side of human mind.
Oh - Kingdom millennial, grave-town of the atomic age.

(In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.)

After the fall - where do you crawl, when lights are dim.
After the sin - nuclear winter, bleak is the day and the end is nigh.
After the fall - A new winter dawn.

After the fall - where do you crawl, when lights are dim.
After the sin - nuclear winter, bleak is the day and the end is nigh.
After the fall - new winter dawn, scour my soul, deep from within.
Nuclear winter, bleak was the day that turned to night.
After the fall - A new winter dawn.
