On the break of sanity, I meet my antagonist.
In the field of theology, cannot find but agony.
You â do you believe in me?
Do I believe in you?
Who do you think you are?
Who are you? Are you God?

Where to find some relief, religion is too weak.
I tear down my belief, foundations of it I seek.
Do you believe all you see?
What could I have seen?
Who do you think you are?
Who are you? Are you God?

Gather words in this heap, is this Christianity?
I proudly take this leap, to haven of insanity.
You â do you believe in me?
Don't question my belief!
Who do you think you are?
Who are you? Are you God?
