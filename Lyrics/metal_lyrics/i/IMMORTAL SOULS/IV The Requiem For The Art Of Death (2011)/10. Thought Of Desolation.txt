As thoughts fill my head,
Crawling into me,
I fall into something that should never be.

My tired eyes, at last open to see,
This inner night...

Feels like nowhere to hide,
From the violent sight,
I find new anger I thought was never there.

Find myself once again from the same feel of hate.
I feel the urge pulling me into thoughts of desolation.

I drown into this pool of thoughts,
And drain myself...

The scars that lie within,
Same feel awakening,
Is there something that can set me free?

Find myself once again from the same feel of hate.
I feel the urge pulling me into thoughts of desolation.

Dweller in the dark of my own heart,
From you I am falling.
Sleeper in the deep is awakening.
You I am calling...

Find myself once again from the same feel of hate.
I feel the urge pulling me into thoughts of desolation.

Dweller in the dark of my own heart,
From you I am falling.
Sleeper in the deep is awakening.
You I am calling...
From you I am falling.
Oh God, I am falling...
