Are you who you say you are?
Are you something else?
I want to know you, as I am one of you.

I built a wall around my head
And filled my urges til they where dead
Here I stand alone in this land of confusion.

Give me lever long enough and I shall move the world
Give me lever long enough and I shall turn the world upside down.

Am I who they say I am?
Am I who I thought I was?
Who are they to name me, do I even care?

They are so keen to label me,
Like it would set them free.
All I ever wanted to be was only me

Give me lever long enough and I shall move the world
Give me lever long enough and I shall turn the world upside down.

As the world keeps turning...

Evil believer-Am I the one to make you question your faith
Evil believer-who are you to question mine!

Outcast-unloved-hated-unappreciated
My life in veil of hatred, where do I belong?
Where should I stand if not with them and neither with my own kind?
I seem to balance on the edge of two worlds

Give me lever long enough and I shall move the world
Give me lever long enough and I shall turn the world upside down

As the world keeps burning...

Evil believer-Am I the one to make you question your faith
Evil believer-who are you to question mine!
Evil believer-Nothing you do will make me question mine!
