Cold - I stand alone in emptiness.
With pride I lie in shadows that I once left.
Oh - mistakes I've made I now repeat.
After all I've done how can I remember the light?
Light - remembrance of its glow.
I hold my burden and feel the weight of this world.
Oh - tried to be wise I became a fool.
Frozen is the key to get out of this cold.

I am frozen inside in the coldness of time.
I lack warmth of feeling in my state of mind.
Frozen inside my own head, where I now cry.
I am frozen inside - my state of mind.
Frozen inside - where I now cry.
