[Chapter II - Reflections Of Doom begins]

I walk in knee deep heavy snow and feel wind on my skin.
I'm on journey to the north where I was sent.
I heard the calling by the light and silent whispers in the wind.
And behind there trees I found the monument.
Cold as ice - Pure as light.
Icon of ice - witness of my demise.
The icon shines its cold blue light.
Icon of ice - reflection of life.
The icon opened the eyes of my mind.
Strait is the gate and narrow way which leads me unto life.
I feel like life has become an open field.
For a while there is no woe and all my fears are laid to rest.
Fallen is my heavy burden from which I'm freed.
Cold as Ice - Pure as ice.
Icon of ice - witness of my demise.
The icon shines its cold blue light.
Icon of ice - reflections of life.
The icon opened the eyes of my mind.
Icon of ice - monolith of Christ.
The icon shines its cold blue light.
Icon of ice - reflection in time.
The icon opened the eyes of my mind.
