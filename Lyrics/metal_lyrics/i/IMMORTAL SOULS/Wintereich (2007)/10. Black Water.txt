Black Water runs in the winter breeze.
Stream in motion, will never freeze.
Deep or shallow it will be as belief.
This waterside is where I leave my grief.
Black water feels cold against my skin.
I am breathless as I walk deeper in.
Black water runs, takes me away, deeper in its arms.
I fell in love with the sense of being alive.
And now it's so hard to let go.
Far in water, gone is the feel of cold.
I dream of the harbour where I float.
Black water drifts me out of time.
Last River is where I close my eyes.
Black water runs, takes me away, deeper in its arms.
I fell in love with the sense of being alive.
But now it's time to let go.
