Here I stand in coldness, crossroads in the frozen snow.
Many paths from which to choose, one of them is my own.
I stare in disbelief the promise that I hold, as I can feel it in my heart.
Frozen wall of despair, has locked me inside my own head.
And my soul chooses death, rather than this so called life.
I stare in disbelief the promise that I hold, as I can feel it in my heart of cold.
Right to choose my own way, even though I'm locked in time.
For what its worth I hold the key, that unlocks my despair.
I stare in disbelief at the promise I hold, as I can feel it in my heart of cold.
