[Chapter III - The Shadow Of The Valley Of Death begins]

Deep frozen snow scatters under my feet, as I walk downhill to valley below.
My heart beats faster in cold pale moonlight, behind the veil of darkness.
As I walk deeper the dark narrow path, I hear the echoing whispers again.
Running steps behind me but when I turn, there is no-one here with me.
Day pass away from the light into night.
In mourning idlestate of my brain.
I submit myself for thee.
I resist so it would flee.
My idlestate.
Though I walk the valley of the shadow of death, I will have no fear in me.
For thou art with me thy rod and thy staff, they bring comfort to my soul.
Day pass away from the light into the night.
In mourning idlestate of my brain.
I submit myself for thee.
I resist so it would flee.
My idlestate.
Day pass away from the light into night.
I submit myself for thee.
I resist so it would flee.
When light shined upon my head, I walked through the darkest night.
My idlestate.
