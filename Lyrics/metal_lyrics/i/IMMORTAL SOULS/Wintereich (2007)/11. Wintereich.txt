I stand at the end of time, on the shores of Wintereich.
Silence lay on the landscape frozen with snow.
Before me the mighty gates of pure glasslike ice.
I'm alone in heavy snow in white loneliness.
In distance thunder's raging and it's coming near.
I listen to the roar and hear a voice that's calling me.
"Come my child don't fear to enter into my domain."
White Frozen kingdom of ice - into blinding cold of light - I feel the frost of purity - Cold energy enters me - Wintereich.
I walk into the storm, in the heart of Wintereich.
I go through the gates and up the snowbound icy stairs.
Fierce wind blows but I keep walking into hall of ice. "Welcome home my child I have been expecting you".
White Frozen kingdom of ice - into blinding cold of light - I feel the frost of purity - Cold energy enters me - Wintereich.
White Frozen kingdom of ice - into blinding cold of light - I feel the frost of purity - Cold energy enters me - Allegory of my dream - cold as ice pure as light - I submit myself to thee - into eye of the storm - Wintereich.
