I see the red withdraw behind the green.
On the night sky stars fade into clouds.
Blacker than night - colder than blue.
I walk the streets in town of vanity.
The storm is rising; color my sky.
I wait for its rage; eyes open wide.
From the town of gray to forest of green.
Color my sky.
The storm is rising; color my sky.
I stare at its rage' eyes open wide.
From the soil of gray to snow of white.
From ashes of gray to sun of red.
Color of my sky.
