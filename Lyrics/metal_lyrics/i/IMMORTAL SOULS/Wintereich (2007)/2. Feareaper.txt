From light into dark I fall into fear into the unknown, the interlayer.
I set candle to burn, some light to my room in need of cleansing flame before I implode.
Oh - fear is all I reap.
Oh - is fear all I seek?
Gleam of subtle light in layers of my soul deep within the core, deeper than I know.
Lonely candle burns cast light to my room I stare it for a while before I implode.
Oh - fear is all I reap.
Oh - is fear all I seek?

Fear - the burden I hold in this slough of despond; will I descend?
Layer of man -  layer of Judas -  layer of Jesus.
Oh - fear is all I reap.
Oh - is fear all I seek?
Fear - the burden I hold in this slough of despond; will I ascend?
