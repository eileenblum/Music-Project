Welcome - I invite you to a journey of your life;
Snowstorm - On the frontier of dishearten mind.
Walk with me into these woods at this winter night;
Gaze upon the starlit sky to see the northern lights..

Frozen - Scenery gives a glimpse of hope;
Chosen - Trail that leads through the drifts of snow.
Upon your soul caress of winds purifying breeze;
Just beware don't breath too deep or your lungs may freeze..

Welcome to north - Land of raging frost;
Welcome to north - This is the haven of cold.

Threshold - As we stand before the gates of north;
Stronghold - The halls of ice breath precence of lord.
We walk further into blinding light that heals the scars;
Natures roaring silenced under my fast beating heart..

Welcome to North - Land of raging frost;
Welcome to North - This is the haven of cold.

Welcome to heaven of cold;
Welcome to north - The land of frost..

Welcome to north - Land of raging frost;
Welcome to north - This is the haven of cold.
