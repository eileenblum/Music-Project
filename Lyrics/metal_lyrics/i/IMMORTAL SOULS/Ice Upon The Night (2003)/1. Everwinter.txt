"I face the wall of a storm, that freezes my soul;
..with heart open wide I walk in.."

I close my eyes and let the wind embrace with it's flow;
As I sence warmth commece in within.
I walk alone in the snow beneath the starlit sky;
I am free from the load of sin..

Into the purifying light I walk without fear;
I feel the frost of holiness enter me..

Frozen from the world I'm in;
State of mind.. ..of divine!
Everwinter..
Frozen state of my mind;
Divine in the world I'm in;
Everwinter is nigh!

"Everwinter - Divine state of mind.."

In the heart of the north I have walked through the snow;
I look back at the trail that I came.
One set of footprints I see, but now I know I wasn't alone;
Because the trails are not mine..

Into the purifying light I walk without fear;
I feel the frost of holiness carry me..

Frozen from the world I'm in;
State of mind.. ..of divine!
Everwinter..
Frozen state of my mind;
Divine in the world I'm in;
Everwinter is nigh!
