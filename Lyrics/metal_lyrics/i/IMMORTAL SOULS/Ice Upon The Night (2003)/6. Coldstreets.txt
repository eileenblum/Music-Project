I feed the fire in the night and wish the memories away;
As with tears I watch the flames of departure.
I still think of you and it makes it even harder;
I can't remember but the good times we had..

It was the love that become hate and all the wrong words were said;
I never wanted this to be, but still it is.
Seems like these nights are getting each time longer;
Longer they are when I pass them all alone..

I walk alone the cold streets.
Love is gone, cold streets.
Love is playing it cruel game upon my broken heart;
Loneliness is my only game on these cold streets..

The freezing wind from the sea blows it cold over me;
The sea lies frozen in ice as do my soul.
Seems like these nights are getting each time colder;
Colder they are when I pass them all alone..

I walk alone the cold streets.
Love is gone, cold streets.
Love is playing it cruel game upon my broken heart;
Love is no game on these cold streets..

I walk alone the cold streets.
Love is gone, cold streets.
Love is playing it cruel game upon my broken heart;
Love from ubove is what I need on these cols streets..
