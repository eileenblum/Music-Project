"I wait alone in the dark, for the gates to unfold;
Far and distant You are, far and distant..
..and so cold."

You - Thee so weak in belief;
Everything you must see;
But I'm the breath of wind..

You - Science your own fate;
In your world you resonate;
While I'm the balance in within..

I'm a man of the ways of this world;
And when the night falls the wolf reappears..

You - Still it was You for me;
How can I believe;
Never knew like of You;
You for me..

You - All it is done for me;
How can this be real;
My refusal of You;
You for me..

You - Lie, steal and deceive;
And only time you come for me;
Is in your moments of pain..

You - Blessed are thou who have not seen;
And yet have believeth;
I'm beginning and the end..

I wear the white clothe through the day;
And when the night falls the wolf reappears..

You - Still it was You for me;
How can I believe;
Never knew like of You;
You for me..

You - All it is done for me;
How can this be;
My refusal of You;
You for me..

You are a man of the ways of this world;
But still I shine on the crimes you once did..

You - Still it was You for me;
Can I now believe;
Never knew like of You;
You for me..

You - All it is done for me;
How can this be;
My refusal of You;
You for me..
