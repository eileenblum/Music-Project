Eve of the cold I take a walk outside;
To escape the inner fight..
Wind blows the snow over my troubled soul;
Pain that won't leave me alone..

Under the burden that makes me insane;
I fade away..
They pull me into their lonely world of pain;
A horror parade..

Sorrow in my torn soul;
And a war within..
To whom can I turn?

Hollow in my thorn crown;
The load of grief..
The pain that I bear..

All the confessions poured upon my soul;
The turmoil inside..
To whom can I turn to on my own sorrow;
I pray for my soul..

Sorrow in my torn soul;
And a war within..
To whom can I turn?

Hollow in my thorn crown;
Can I turn to You?
The Painbearer
