All for the love..

I walk into moments darker than night;
Through the walls of apathy.
And all decay from which even the sun withdraws..

Oh - Light may fade, but the fire;
Fire's burning still..

Oh - Don't ask me to understand;
My need for your love.
And the sacrifice..

My soul in turmoil of emotion;
I try to focus and close my eyes.
As the reason tries to overcome what spirit has achieved..

Oh - Light may fade, but the fire;
Saturates the will..

Oh - Don't ask me to understand;
My need for your love.
And the sacrifice..

Sacrifice - All for the love..

Oh - Don't ask me to understand;
My need for your love.
And the sacrifice..

Sacrifice - All for the love..
