I watch the snow flowing down gently from the open sky;
It makes me feel more alive.
I've been lying here alone, isolated from the crowd;
After my suicide..

Feels like my all emotions die, in depression I lie;
And they ask the questions why.
I can't remember the scene, from the tragedy I see;
Just the red in the snow..

They try to hide the tears and look away;
But they just stare at my scars..

My broken heart pumped the blood;
Out of my broken veins.
Knife alone in the snow;
Red of life run to waste..

A new start I will seek, mind is strong but body weak;
I await my heart to heal.
Just like staring into light, I am blinded by this fire;
As long as life there's hope for me..

They try to hide the tears and look away;
But they just stare at my scars..

My broken heart pumped the blood;
Out of my broken veins.
I lie alone in the snow;
Red from life as He came..

Alive!
