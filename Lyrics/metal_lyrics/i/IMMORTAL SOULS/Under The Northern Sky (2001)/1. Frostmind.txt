Cold January morning at the northern land
White frost embraces the dawn
Cold nature awaking under the veil of snow
With the first beams of light
Cold air not warming despite the light
As my breath vapors

Frozen northenr air - Northern frozen nature

Ice is all that remains of the flowing streams
Of bright and pure water
Ice covers the hills like a monument
For honor of the frost

Frostbite - on my skin the feel of winter - Frostmind
Frostmind - deep inside the cold lovebite - Frostbite

Crystallike shine on these towers of ice
Too bright for my eyes...

Light has taken my sight made me snowblind
As the vision I saw at the north
Light formed into a shape and offered a hand
To guide my blind eyes

Frostbite - on my skin the feel of winter - Frostmind
Frostmind - deep inside the cold lovebite - Frostbite
