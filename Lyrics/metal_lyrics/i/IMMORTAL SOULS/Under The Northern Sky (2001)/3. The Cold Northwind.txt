As a stranger I wandered to this place
I was self-confident but afraid
Crimes shadowed my way

I flee from long arm of law
I used to run but now I crawl
My knife is still colored by blood

Cold breathing Northwind shattering
As I say a silent prayer for my soul
My soul in shadows that rise upon my crimes

Ice and snow whirl shredding my skin
By fierce blow of ice-cold Northwind

The Cold Northwind

Loneliness at the hills of north
While wind sweeps like God's wrath
Will I pay my crimes by death?

I have made so many sons to bleed
Still son of God bled for me
How could I ever believe?

Cold breathing Northwind avenging
As I scream a prayer for my soul
My soul in shadows that rise upon my crimes

Dark and cold visions shredding my mind
By fierce blow of ice-cold Northwind

The Cold Northwind
