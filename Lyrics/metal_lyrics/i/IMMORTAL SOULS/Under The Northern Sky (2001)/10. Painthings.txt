I'm painting my sorrow with these dark colors
I immortalize my painful ife into this work of art

Night after night
At the attic in dim candlelight
I return to my work
These dark lines and visions that hurt

And from the canvas I can look into my soul
The paint reflects my inner fears and my pain

Weak soul in my weaker flesh
Alone and so addicted
Lost of love made me insane
All I have is skill to paint

I'm painting my sorrow with these dark colors
I immortalize my painful life into this work of art

Pain after pain
Painted in valued works of art
The hate i have for this gift
Why can I paint the shape of suffering?

My respected art I create from my pain
Dark visions from my hollow soul

Weak soul in my weaker flesh
Alone and so addicted
Lost of love made me insane
All I have is skill to paint

Lost of love made me insane...
