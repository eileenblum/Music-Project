As I walk this sidewalk all alone, wet from rain and so cold
I press my head down and try to hide from their looks

Deep inside I cry in pain, so intense it drives insane
I walk away from love that became betrayal

In my heart I bear the scars
That remain there forever
Clawed by Love Demise

Once pertners now just apart
Left alone by betrayal
Clawed by Love Demise

"They were so young"; I heard them say, but that is not a reason
To rip my heart and leave it out to bleed

I lay my eyes up to the stars, and pray that I'll find her
The one I thought I found, but I am still looking for

In my heart I bear the scars
That will remain forever
Clawed by Love Demise

Once partners now just apart
Left alone by betrayal Clawed by Love Demise
