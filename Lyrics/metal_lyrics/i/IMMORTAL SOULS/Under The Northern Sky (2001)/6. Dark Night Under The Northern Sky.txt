At this frosty night under the starlit sky
Northern light caress my eyes
The white spruce forest swaying
By the rhythm of the wind

I stare with sweet melancholy
Its snowy pride and green beauty
Crust of snow reflect in blue
Pale light of the moon

Walking through this silent night
Close to my heart the cross I bare
Silhouettes of trees in silence
Reminds me of greatness above

Oh starlit sky
Withdraw behind the cloudiness on
Dark Night Under The Northern Sky

Neon lights color the night sky
I wish they all would die
The gray forest stands polluted
Filthy snow begins to melt

I see violence on these crowded streets
So full of hostility
I confront eyes that contempt
That've forgotten him

Walking through this pagan land
My cross gets heavier to bear
But I've seen the revelation
Through your eyes my beloved one

Your starlit eyes
Awoke me to see forgiveness on
Dark Night Under The Northern Sky
