I lay myself on the snowy ground and stare the open sky
The trees stand around me carrying their limbs heavy with snow
As my eyes wander at the stars and the moon retreats behind the clouds
I start to think about my life and the course I've given to it

The fire that burns keeps me warm
The fire that Christ set to burn

My mind survived the blue flamed fire
My hate survived the blue flamed fire

I can hear the church bells from a distance somewhere far
Voices of nocturnal nature raise the tempo of my heart
The Blue Flamed Fire's been burning in my soul for so long
Still I've always been myself; nothing less and nothing more

I lift myself up from the snow and start to walk in this darkness
Feeling so blind trying to find the path which I came from
As I raise my eyes to the sky the moon returns from behind the clouds
I look up to silhouettes of trees and know which path is mine

The fire that burns keeps me warm
The fire that Christ set to burn

My mind survived the Blue Flamed Fire
My hate survived the Blue Falmed Fire

I can hear the church bells from a distance somewhere far
Voices of nocturnal nature raise the tempo of my heart
The Blue Flamed Fire's been burning in my soul for so long
Still I've always been myself; nothing less and nothing more
