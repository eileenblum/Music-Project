I wake up to the sound of frost creaking in the walls
I crawl to the door to confront its cold breath

First morning after the long autumn
Exitement fills my heart
Before my eyes opens a scene so bright
Wintertime has begun

Oh, I hear the forest calling for me
Oh, the natures roaring so tempting secne for

My Winterheart cast in white frost
Cold dawn of winter, the love divine enters to
My Winterheart

Into the cold and snow surrounded
Forest now I stroll
The path I've chosen leads to prescece
Of the Creator

Oh, how I admire the beauty of these trees
Oh, how they stand in silence dressed in white they greet

My Winterheart cast in white frost
Cold dawn of winter, the love divine enters to
My Winterheart

Memories take me to dawn of his glory in my life
Grace pours like snowflakes on my wounded soul
