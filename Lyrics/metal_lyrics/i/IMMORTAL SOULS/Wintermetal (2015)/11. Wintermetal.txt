"Why deny reality, we live in immortality" [- Immortal 1991]
In the year 1991, is where this journey began
Wintermetal forever!
"Riding down the mountain of my own emotion, everything feels so unreal" [- Hate Sender 1994]
From a small town at Pohjanmaa, to capitals of the world

We heard the call of Wintermetal
We heard the call of forever
We heard the call of Wintermetal
We heard the call
And now we all
In the eyes of the world
Stand alone

"As I walk through the masses of snow at this frostbitten winter night" [- Snow Soul 1997]
Unite we stand and strong is our will,
nothing can bring us down
Wintermetal is forever!
"Cold (January) morning at the northern land, white frost embraces the dawn" [- Frostmind 1999]
Listen! Can you hear what I hear; it is the sound of salvation

We heard the call of Wintermetal
We heard the call of forever
We heard the call of Wintermetal
We heard the call
And now we all
Are standing strong
Forevermore
