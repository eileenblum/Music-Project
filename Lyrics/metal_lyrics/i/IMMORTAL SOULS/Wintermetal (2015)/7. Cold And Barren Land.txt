Nightfall - the stars shining bright
Light of the moon glow on the hills
All around the wilderness with its cold charm
I caress the feeling with open heart

Nightfall - gleam of northern lights
Snowfall - embrace the frozen night

I stare at the flames of the fuming fire
Casting its soothing warmth into the night

Cold and barren land
Of ice and snow
My heart filled with admiration
Cold and barren land
So beautiful
I look at awe of this creation

I lay myself on the frozen spruce twig bed
Soon I close my eyes to sleep at/on/in the snow

Nightfall - gleam of northern lights
Snowfall - embrace the frozen night

I stare at the flames of the fuming fire
Casting its soothing warmth into the night

I stare at the flames of the fuming fire
Mountains like guardians watching my sleep
