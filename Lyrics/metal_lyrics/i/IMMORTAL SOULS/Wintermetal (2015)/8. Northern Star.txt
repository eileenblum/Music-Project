Cold wind moves behind the row of tall pine trees
Makes them sigh, just like they could breathe
Northern lights - the green of sky
The feel of night - I stare in its eyes!

I look over the tree line in the night and see you there

Northern star - I've lost my way
And have myself to blame
Northern star - thou far you are
I see you - I see you there
See you there

Deeper in the northern landscape of snow
Eyes of night fade away in your glow
All this time I have felt the void deep inside
In my soul, waiting for your light

Northern star - I've lost my way
And have myself to blame
Northern star - thou far you are
I see you - I see you there

I look over the tree line in the night and see you there

Northern star - I've lost my way
And have myself to blame
Northern star - thou far you are
I see you - I see you there
See you there
