...the time has come for time to end
For this is the dawn of northern coldness...

Like the ice cold northern wind
Falling down on the frozen landscape
Over lakes, across the seas
Into hearts and souls
I look at the wall of snow
Showing me the way to go
Freezing all except my soul
At the dawn

Cold sun is rising - from the east
Light through the snowfall - color the mountains
The time has come - for time to end

Strengthening in our belief
On our way to the final frontier
Who has the will shall have the means
My brothers in arms
I walk into sanctuary
My brothers here with me
Start of a new century
At the dawn

Cold sun is rising - from the east
Light through the snowfall - color the mountains
The time has come - for time to end
Dawn of the northern coldness - the dawn of northern coldness

...the time has come for time to end
For this is the dawn of northern coldness...
