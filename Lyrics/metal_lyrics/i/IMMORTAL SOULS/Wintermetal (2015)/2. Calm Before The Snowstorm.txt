I - I am Alfa - I am Omega
I am the first and will be the last
I am beginning - I am the end
I seize the world in palm of my hand

Ice cold blood of immortal
In the silence we are waiting
In cold blood

You - you have the will - you have the means
We have the coldness of blue flamed fire
Together we fly through ice and snow
And seize the world in palm of our hands

Ice cold blood of immortal
In the silence we are waiting
In cold blood

Calm before the snowstorm - cold blood of immortal
Calm before the snowstorm - blue flamed fire can't be defined
Calm before the snowstorm - cold blood of immortal
Calm before the snowstorm

Time is upon us, we've been waiting for,
In the silence; in cold blood...

Calm before the snowstorm - cold blood of immortal
Calm before the snowstorm - blue flamed fire can't be defined
Calm before the snowstorm - cold blood of immortal
Calm before the snowstorm
