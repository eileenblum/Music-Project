Staring at the fire
Against the night
In my solitude

I withdraw into woods
Under the night
I alone with my thoughts
Keeping me warm

Feeding - the bonfire - in pale moon light
Close my eyes - to listen - the sound of night

In my solitude - staring at the fire
In my solitude - I alone
In my solitude - my thoughts become alive
In my solitude - I as one

Staring at the fire
Against the night
Watch the flames grow higher
Keeping me warm

Feeding - the bonfire - in pale moon light
Close my eyes - to listen - the sound of night

In my solitude - staring at the fire
In my solitude - I alone
In my solitude - my thoughts become alive
In my solitude - I as one

In my solitude
Staring at the fire
Against the night
I grow complete
In my solitude

Feeding - the bonfire - in pale moon light
Close my eyes - to listen - the sound of night

In my solitude - staring at the fire
In my solitude - I alone
In my solitude - my thoughts become alive
In my solitude - I as one
