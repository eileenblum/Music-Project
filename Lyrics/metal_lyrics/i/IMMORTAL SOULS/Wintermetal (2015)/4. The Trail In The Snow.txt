I walk into the unknown
Away from it all
Drifts and piles of snow
Frozen class like trees
Mountains of ice
Far lands of north
I see the features
Of depressed human mind
All of those creatures
That crawls in at the night
I feel like falling
To dark side of the moon
Struggle in within
Trying to escape my doom

The trail in the snow I walk in the shadow of the trees
Through the narrow path that leads to gate of existence
The trail in the snow that only few will ever find
This path I follow breathe the life in my worn out soul

I shall remember
The scars that will remain
Return to sender
Feel like I became insane
Prevailing apathy
I will resist the flow
Thin line of loyalty
That in my heart I know
I walk into the unknown
Away from it all
