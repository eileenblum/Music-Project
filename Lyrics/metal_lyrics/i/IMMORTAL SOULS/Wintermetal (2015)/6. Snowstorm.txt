...It all began with light snow...
Hear the wind under the door
On the roof, under the floor
I feel the fright before this sight
Starlit night has turned to white
From the distance I can hear
A roar that's coming - for me

I fly over moonlit woods
In the eye of thundering snowstorm

...those trees look small from a far...
Through the wind and thundering
I hear a vague sound of wings
Bricks and planks all around
The cabin fallen to the ground
I look the ruins of the wreck
And there I lie - dead!

I fly over moonlit woods
In the eye of thundering snowstorm
