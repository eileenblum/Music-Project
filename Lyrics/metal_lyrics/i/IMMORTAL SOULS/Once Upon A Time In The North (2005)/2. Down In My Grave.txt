Dark are the skies lit by the neon lights;
I walk on the street in embrace of the wind.
Fear, that gnaws me in its jaws;
I bury my head in my hands from the world,
And the voice in my head wonât leave me aloneâ¦

Black are the walls that imprison my soul;
Darkness surrounds me in the cloak of the night.
Down, deep inside I say a prayer for my soul;
My phobias ruling the life I once had.
And the voice in my head questions my faithâ¦

All that I need from thee to be freeâ¦

Lower me down in my grave;
And bid me farewell.
Lower me down in my grave;
With the flowers Iâll wither away.
Lower me down;
Down in my graveâ¦

Alone in the dark, in the silence of the night;
Long is the road to the lights of the day.
I close my eyes in the frozen ground;
I see my old self in the cold soothing soil
And the voice in my head silenced by faithâ¦

All that I need from thee to be freeâ¦

Lower me down in my grave;
And bid me farewell.
Lower me down in my grave;
With the flowers Iâll wither away.
Lower me down; down down.
Down in my graveâ¦
