I lean my head against the glass of the chilled, cold window.
Feel of cold pulls me back to memories of the past;
I fell down on the ground, colored stones with my bloodâ¦

I saw myself from a far my wounded head glowing red;
I wanted so to let go but something still held me downâ¦

I wait for the rain to wash away the pain;
Down by grace all the fears I face everydayâ¦

I walk alone my path in emptiness of the night;
Under the darkened and painweighted cloud of life.

I close my eyes from the world mourning in the hearts of wise;
Painweighted and sorrow filled; still I wait for the graveâ¦

I wait for the rain to wash away the pain;
Down by grace all the fears I face everydayâ¦

Painweightedâ¦

I walk alone my path in emptiness of the night;
Under the darkened and pain weighted cloud of life.
