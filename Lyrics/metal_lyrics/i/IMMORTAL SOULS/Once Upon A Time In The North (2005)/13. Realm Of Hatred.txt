I Invite you for a ride... journey into my mind...
The realm that you shall find...winter cold hatred inside...

Welcome to My Realm of Hatred.

Like icy bone fingers clawing my mind.
The vague darkness growing inside.
The madness I've been fighting is now taking over.
My life in vale of hatred become too obscure.

...No Escaping...Hate Within...Here to Stay...
...In My Realm of Hatred...

Anguish grows in me...Neverending sorrow I see...
My realm my chance to be free...Winter frost eases my grief...

Clouds filter moonlight reflection from snow.
Beauty of nature gives me new hope.
It's so much easier to hate than feel love.
And I've seen that love is the only way out of hate.

...Farewell...From My Hell...Farewell...
...From My Realm of Hatred...
