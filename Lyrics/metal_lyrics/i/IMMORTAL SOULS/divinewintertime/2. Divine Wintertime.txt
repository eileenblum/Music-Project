I spread my minds wings and arise towards the sky.
I fulfil all my dreams and to the essence of winter I fly...

To finest of weathers my wings are taking me.
Caress of moon at frozen fields.
Snowflakes floating down, forest of snowbound.
Stars give everything a shine.

Now it's time to rest my mind at this Divine Wintertime.
It's time to rest your mind at this Divine Wintertime.
Winter...
Into the nature's eyes I stare now and feel 'em staring back.
This unity sets me free.
My quest for divinity has lead me here and here I'll stay.
Loving embrace of God.

Now it's time to rest my mind at this Divine Wintertime.
It's time to rest your mind at this Divine Wintertime.

Winter.. Divine... Wintertime...
Divine... Wintertime...
