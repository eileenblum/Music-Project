afraid to open my eyes.
Horror of facing the day.

Mist of the morning is fading,
while cancer burn in my bones.
Horror of facing the pain.

Years ago I had plans,
what to do with my life.
But now it all is so futile.

Oh.. again my fears come true
and painkillers are out of effect.
To the pain I must reconcile.

The color of my desperation,
if I wouldn't be heading to Christ.
Would even be darker than now.

My dream is to wake one morning
without these tears of pain.
Oh.. why can't I just die?

The color of my desperation,
if I wouldn't be heading to Christ.
Would even be darker than now.

My dream is to wake one morning
without these tears of pain.
Oh.. why can't I just die?
