Through this silent night I've been watching the sky.
I've been following the brightest star with my eyes...
Saviour is born... Rejoice!

I thought this was another night ruled by penetrating darkness,
but the star I saw was a sign of something else.
The star had stopped above this place.
Following it here I found Him.

Holy night of the Saviour's birth, little child in manger.
We respect the spirit of Christmas as we celebrate the Christ Mass...

There He was; a little child, yet glowing with divinity,
I was allowed to kneel before and to worship Him.
With my mind and in my heart.
I could feel He is the Lord.

This was a night of joy but as well a night of grief.
Herod gave an order to kill 'cause his fear for this King..
Saviour is born.. Rejoice!

"For my eyes have seen Your salvation which You have prepared,
in the sight of all people, a light for revelation,
to the Gentiles and for Glory,
to Your people Israel." -Luke 2:30-32

Holy night of the Saviour's birth, little child in manger.
We respect the spirit of Christmas as we celebrate the Christ Mass...
Christ Mass...
