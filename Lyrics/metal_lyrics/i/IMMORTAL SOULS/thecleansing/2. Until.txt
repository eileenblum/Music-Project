Years have passed before me
Changing my view to things I see
See my inner world on collide
With another that I left outside
I lived for hate so many years
I tried to hide from pain and tears
Tears I wept all for vain
In world of grief I was until
Until I tasted blood of His vine
Until Until...

I lived for greed conscience seared
But all I possessed was only fear
Fear grew in a shapes of gray
In world of grief I was until

Until I tasted blood of His vine
Until Until...

Until I tasted blood of His vine
Until Until...
