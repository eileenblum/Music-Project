I open my eyes just to close 'em again
From the horrors that I see before me
On the edge of depth I stand and stare down below
At something never ment for a man to behold

I stand upon the mountainside of my mind
And stare the walls inside - I'm Icebound

Harsh cold walls of ice in my mind
Lock me deep inside - I'm Icebound

Falling from the edge of depth
Deep in to a tragedy
Thrown into obscurity

I opened my eyes again to look into the eyes of end
But there was nothing for my eyes to see
Deep inside I had a new belief and took another view into
My soul that used to be icebound

Falling from the edge of depth
Deep into a tragedy
Thrown in front of divinity
Thought I even heard the angels sing
With eyes open wide I now stare into depth
As all my demons are gone for a while
And I still can hear the echoes of the angels singing
What I thought a tragedy became essence of my life

I stand upon the mountainside of my mind
And witness the meltdown - of Icebound

Cold walls of ice fall down in my mind
Freeing me from inside - of Icebound

Standing on the edge of depth
Staring into divinity
I threw away my vanity
