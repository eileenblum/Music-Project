...Out from the darkened night,
Into the burning hot cleansing steam...

My weak endeavour to stay clean;
From all the filth that I've gladly taken in.
Failed escape from reality;
My soul lies unwanted with a stain of sin...

I feel myself impure;
I need the cleansing;
Craving for more of your love...

I feel myself unclean;
I need the cleansing;
Oh, wash me clean from these stains in me...

...Out from the hot burning steam,
Into the frozen cold granular snow...

The filth I've seen on my way;
Hasn't stain me like the evil from within.
Evil deeds and words I say;
I've soiled my soul with a stain of sin...

I feel myself impure;
I need the cleansing;
Craving for more of your love...

I feel myself unclean;
I need your blessing;
Only you can clean these stains in me...
