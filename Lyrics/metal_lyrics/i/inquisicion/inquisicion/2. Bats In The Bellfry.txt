A restless spirit, deprived too young of life?s sweet joys
The day they hang me I still curse 
No cemetery pyre will make me decompose 
Now at nightfall I start to roam 

A maiden's neck 
White and tender 
I long to find 

Fast wings, eager fangs 
Like a bat I hunt 

Garlic nor crosses will stop an undead villain 
As you may always have believed 
Only rays of sun can scare me into my old grave 
To sleep concealed in earth of home 

Nothing's hard cause 
Ladies do like 
Being sucked 

Fast wings, eager fangs 
Like a bat I hunt 

Blood, steal from innocent virgins 

Red, drops tickle in my tongue and throat

Screams, rebounce as I hasten away

Night, will eternally hide my sins
