Broomsticks hurry to Broken
Under the moon of Mayday's Eve 
Witches shriek and laugh in the sky 
Cause it's the night of Walpurgis 

Kiss the Devil under his tail 
Witch and demon celebrating 
Just greed and lust in bloodshot eyes 
Only evil is to be seen 

Sisters, join the feast till dawn comes

Magic spells have made them wicked 
And now malice runs through their blood 
Stolen babies they sacrifice 
To Beelzebub and Astaroth 

On this Sabbath all dark creatures 
Praise the master who rules their soul 
Just greed and lust in bloodshot eyes 
Only evil is to be seen 

Sisters, join the feast till dawn comes 

Frantic bodies are dancing naked 
Candles blow out 
As storms are raising 

The winds of heaven turn up the fire 
Ghoulish rituals they perform unseen
