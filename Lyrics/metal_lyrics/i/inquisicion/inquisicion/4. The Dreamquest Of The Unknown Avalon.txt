Eyes of doves have seen the enemy's face
Hawks prepare for the defense
Cause a new God is destroying the old isle of Avalon

Lord Guigomar's knights must slay Him now
Otherwise the Dragon dies
Without his breath the mists shall take the island into oblivion

[chorus]
Valiant and brave
On horses proud 
Fierce riders are eager to fight
Gleaming helmets
Shield and strong lance
No cavalier ever surrenders

Lands glide on under the palfrey's swift pace
Gray clouds are covering the sky 
All knights listen to catch the sound of horn or baying of hound

Anger grows as they near the place yonder 
Where villainy has no equal
Whence came red and black flames to lick at the sacred mother's earth 

[chorus]

Pledged an holy oath to Merlin and Priestess
Thou may be sure without fail
That we shall fight until defeat or victory
Fate give us an honorful death

[solo]

Lightning of silver, the black sky explodes
A roar rises from the fight
Cavaliers draw their swords
from the scabbards while the horses sweat and foam
No knight of Avalon scares from battle
Blood slakes the thirst of their swords 
The Dragon survives as long as they have 
the strength to rise after fall
