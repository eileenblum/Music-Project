On through the thin air She flies
-My eyes can see You...-
Dream of Sweet Angel, long-haired Evil.
Lust in Her eyes, My Soul I see it burn,
Black Night's girl, Runaway from daylight,
Daylight...

Full Moon shines, Oh, makes Her fly, 
On wings of Desire...Oh, No!

Devil in high heels, all dressed in lace,
Closing my eyes with Her sweet Kiss of Death. 
Her lips repeat "You'll be Mine forever...", 
I know You're not real; You're The Killer of the Night 

[Solo]

Chains, make me a Prisoner of Your Lust;
Evil Woman let me feel Your soft skin,
Take me to Your Wasted Lands; No one can save me,
The Echo of Your voice is calling, calling... 

Full Moon shines, Oh, makes You fly,
On wings of Desire...Oh, No!

Devil in high heels, all dressed in lace,
Closing my eyes with Your sweet Kiss of Death.
Your lips repeat "You'll be Mine forever",
I know You're not real; You're The Killer of the Night
