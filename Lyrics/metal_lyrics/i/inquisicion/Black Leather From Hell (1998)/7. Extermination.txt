Somewhere in the Future, From above 
Alien race has landed to conquer the World 
Savage Hordes are falling, From the sky 
Unknown Warriors carrying Death 
The Battle goes on...Storming the World,
Enslaving mankind in a Trail of Blood
Extermination, Atomic Guns, Seek and Destroy, Gaining Control
Destroying race after race they rejoice!
Extermination, Atomic Guns, Seek and Destroy, Gaining Control
Biomechanical Soldiers to rise!

[Solo]

Cultures crumble under Alien Fire 
Misery and Woe dominate the World. 
Then the Astral Breed with their cannons 
Spewing Death came to defend their lives 

'Till the Enemy was gone...Uniting the World,
Freeing mankind from this Nightmare

Extermination, Atomic Guns, Seek and Destroy, Gaining Control
Destroying race after race they rejoice
Extermination, Atomic Guns, Seek and Destroy, Gaining Control
Biomechanical Soldiers to rise!
