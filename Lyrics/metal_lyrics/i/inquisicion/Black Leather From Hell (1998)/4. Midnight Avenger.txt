He comes right from The buried Depths of Hell,
Destructor, Saviour of Mankind.
Half-man, Half-Demon, His Powers destroy,
He'll tear your heads and Souls apart 

The Midnight Avenger

Assassin...He rules it all,
He's calling You back
To pull the strings from the top of the World

Fast as light, His gun blasting in the Dark,
His Metal Armour, deadly shield 
Bombs devastating, Roaring with delight, 
The Gods of War Laugh on the hills 

The Midnight Avenger

Dark Angel, Stormbringer,
Giving the Final Sentence.
Laser shines, Monster Eyes,
Glow in Combat...Do as I command! 

Assassin...He rules it all,
He's calling You back
To pull the strings from the top of the World

[Solo]

Assassin...He rules it all,
He's calling You back
...To Rise!!!

I've seen the Cities crumbling down,
His Might will turn the clouds to Red.
Unleashed, unbound, He wins this round,
All life is rotten to the end...

[Solo]

The Midnight Avenger

Dark Angel, Stormbringer,
Giving the Final Sentence,
Laser shines, Monster Eyes,
Glow in Combat...Do as I command!
