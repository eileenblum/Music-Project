Inside the acrid mass of smoke, 
Incandescent Magic Leaves 
Contort like Forsaken Souls 
Dancing upon Hell's Abyss 

The Witch mumbles! The Witch stumbles!
Ecstasy in Her words

The Witch mumbles! The Witch stumbles!
In Ecstasy!

The flutter of a Raven's wings,
The Witch pokes the Fire
As the Sorceress appears in the Night

Before the ever-growing Fire
An Evil Shadow makes a twist,
Bloody Froth is coming out of Her mouth,
Magic Rites Lost in the Mist

The Fire is waning, The Shapes are changing,
Evil is here!

The Fire is waning, The Shapes are changing,
Evil is here! 

The flutter of a Raven's wings,
The Witch pokes the Fire
As the Sorceress appears in the Night

The Mistress broke the Ghastly Spell;
Let Evil Out and Good come in.
The Raven flies above Her head,
Its wings don't take away the Charm!
They won't take it away!!!

[Solo]

Witches head moves side to side,
There is no Evil to cast,
Shaking hands up in the air,
Incantations burn at last

The Witch mumbles! The Witch stumbles!
Ecstasy in Her words
The Fire is waning, The Shapes are changing,
Evil is here!

The flutter of a Raven's wings,
The Witch pokes the Fire
As the Sorceress appears in the Night

Witchcraft.. Witchcraft Night!!!
