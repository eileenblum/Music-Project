From Dusk 'till Dawn They come in Flames.
Hell in Their eyes, Bearers of Pain!

Oh, Army of Darkness Born to Kill,
Judgement Day's here No hope to see!

Pray to your gods For your Soul.
Raising your Swords, Crush your Foes,
Cast Them into the...

Fires of Hell...Evil Soldiers take my Soul
Born to Kill...Spread their wings to the wind
Storming through the air...Bloodshed on Battle Fields
Raise the Dead...Nailing losers to the ground I'll be Dead!!!

Born to be Loud, Heaven is turned down.
Somebody lives, Somebody dies

Army of Darkness Gripping me,
My body's dying, No hope to see
