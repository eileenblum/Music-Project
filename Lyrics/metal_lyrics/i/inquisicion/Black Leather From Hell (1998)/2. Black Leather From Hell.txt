Night by Night We scream at the World, 
Rockin' Hard and Playin' Loud, Heavy Metal in our Veins 
Living too fast To play the game, 
We've gone straight on the road, Burn this place to the ground...Come on Down! 

Metal is our Lord, Thunder is on our side;
Power and Glory, Together as One 
Searching for Pleasure, Raising Hell day by day; 
Our reason to stay here Is playing very Loud! 

SCREAM AND SHOUT!!! Just in every place,
Feel the Fire Of Black Leather from Hell

Killer right from the start,
Our Might breaks the Spel All night on stage
We don't fit in the real World, 
Our ways are restless and wild; We Rise while our Enemies Fall...
