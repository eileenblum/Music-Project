Now I`m going to play
with the strings of your pain
So don`t hide your tears from me
High pitch screams give me delight
Bring shine of lust into my eyes
I will tear your soul apart
while I cut out your flesh
Please stop begging for mercy
Knives draw down a pentagram
I`ll make you burn in my flames

Black candles call out for more blood
I know that you can resist more
Look at me with your eyes in my hand
Don't think it's any use to kiss your sacred cross now

Pain, Is all I ever wanted
Blood, lust, Is all I ever need
Pain, I am the torturer

Knowing good and evil
But just don't give a damn
Cause I do just what I please
Your bloody skin makes me laugh
please stop your pitiful screams

Suffering purifies your soul
I know that you can resist more
Don't wait for divine justice to come
Don't think it's any use to kiss your sacred cross now
