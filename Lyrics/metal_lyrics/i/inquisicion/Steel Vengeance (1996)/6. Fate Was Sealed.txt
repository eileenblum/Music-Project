Across the river lies the land of the dead
A royal burial place opened by mortals
As we neared the end of the world
I could hear the gods call
Amenofis' daughter

Fate was sealed
make my embalmed body be reborn
make my blind dead eyes shine
Fate was sealed
You will never leave again the cold
So Titanic is your tomb

Daughter of Amenofis
wake up and destroy
all who dares to disturb
your eternal sleep

And the gods are shouting
it was written on your tomb
long ago that you must destroy
There will be no heaven or no hell to them
all who dares to disturb the silence

Spit on their jewels, joy and earthly power
Tumble them in a flood of ice
Laugh at their faces drowning in the sea
Your sacred tomb no human hand can touch

Fate was sealed
The curse of the princess you will know
Power outlives her life
Fate was sealed
You will never leave again the cold
So Titanic is your tomb
