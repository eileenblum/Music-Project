Theseus wore arms worthy of a god
To kill the son of the queen and the beast
In oblivion locked up by Minos
A human body ruled by a white bull head

Seven youths and seven maidens gone away
Sail the ship to sacrifice
Seven youths and seven maidens dressed in gray
Won't escape from the labyrinth

His spirit gets lost inside the labyrinth
Behind every corner awaits another hell
His heart is brave but young
An easy prey to confusion

Seven youths and seven maidens gone away
Sail the ship to sacrifice
Seven youths and seven maidens all in pain
Won't escape from the labyrinth

Two sisters wait for you, Theseus
Choose Ariadne, she mirrors your soul
Don't fall for Phaedra's acid charms
Don't fight Minotaur with no sword

Force killed by force, not by fate
Fallen hero, hoist a black sail
Your name heavens won't glorify
Only mortals will praise your deeds

Seven youths and seven maidens gone away
Sail the ship to sacrifice
Seven youths and seven maidens dressed in pain
Won't escape from the labyrinth
