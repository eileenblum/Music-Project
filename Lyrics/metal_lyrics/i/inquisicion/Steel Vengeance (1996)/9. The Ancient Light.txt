Master of life and death
Forever the doors of your black magic will open
Shining stars beneath your cape
And your sacred presence hits the heavens

Babylon, glowing city of power
You`re the high priestess of Hell
Nothing can conquer you
Not even the sands of time

Enslaved to your light
Brother of the Dark
Page of power
Evil`s child
Enslaved by your light
Brother of the Dark
Mistress of indulgence
Your reign hails Satan... our lord

Black goat of the infinite woods
You gave birth to a thousand souls
Mist covering your might
That free our pagan fears forever

In your domain shines ancient light
Let me drink your blood
Hear Marduk's whisper in your ear
Hear my prayer Shubb-niggurath
Let me drink your blood
Hear Marduk's whisper in your ear

City of power you are the one
