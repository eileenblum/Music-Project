Under the sign of Christ we met
At the entrance of God's house
My eyes clasped hers, and she just gave in
Desire in my mind
I crave her body to posses
I crave her soul
See me now with lustful thoughts
Redemption come to me

She is leading me into temptation
Innocent sinner, victim of lust

Is this angel's or demon's work
Guiding me towards sin
What has she done to me, 
always feared God
I'd swear I saw her in black magic
Was it real or illusion?
No follower of Christ can be obsessed
with a dirty bitch like that

Wicked girl behold, stay away from me!
Innocent sinner, victim of lust

Ministers are willing to learn
about women that haunt honest men
"At night she comes won't leave me alone, 
she is wicked and must burn:"
I knew while her tears fell to fire
That this was the wish of God
Flames of hell will clean her soul
and bring her peace again
