Only the devil laughed in scorn of honor
In his envy he left
no work of God untouched

Then you cry out with a clear voice
This way lifting humanity
from this wicked fall

Since his wicked fall all the unhappy ones
blushed before their offspring
ashamed of their exile

Then you cry out with a clear voice
This way lifting humanity
from this wicked fall...everywhere

Sed diabolus istud irrisist in invidia sua
intactum dionsit qua nullum opus Dei

Don't believe in all the things you've seen
Gray sky is full of crimson crosses
falling everywhere, everywhere...

The stone of wisdom
gives me a clear mind
The pain of sin will be cured, and end...
