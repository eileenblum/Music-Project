Temple with no walls
Stone altar of sacrifice
I call the powers
From the Dragon's breath
The Earth forces are rising...
Let's fall in trance
In pleasure we'll face the death

Rebirth of Fire
Pagan Rites

Let's forget good and evil...
Now starts the reign
Of pleasures of the flesh
Ancient rituals of spring
No church ever killed
Our feast of blood
Shall cross the boundaries of will

Give yourself to the Gods
of days long past
They whisper in darkness
On the night of Beltaine
Give in to the pulsing flames of lust
As voices chant with devotion
All around, all around
I loose myself...

The Goddess welcomes the Horned One
Priest and priestess unite
Tonight, Light the flame of Tara
I will bathe in the blood of sacrifice
Feel the pounding inside
Tonight, Swallowed by the tides
