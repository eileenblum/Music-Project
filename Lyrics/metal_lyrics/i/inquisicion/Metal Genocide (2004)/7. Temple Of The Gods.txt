The night is falling, now is time to take a rest.
All day long we were walking to the sacred place.
Our foots are bleeding. We are starving, almost dead.
But we'll never give up, we'll reach de end.

Making rituals, fighting creatures, bearing the pain every single day
By the river side we are going all the way.

It's a mission for the bravest warriors.
We must hear the Holy Voice
For the sake of our groaning people.
In the Temple of the Gods.

The sun is rising, our journey must go on.
We'll take the road through the shady lands and the everglades.
Beware of monsters, show no mercy, kill 'em all!
Engrave the name of your family in your sword.

Burning fever, flying demons, dangerous maze.
Every single day
Across the forest we are going all the way.

It's a mission for the bravest warriors.
We must hear the Holy Voice
For the sake of our groaning people.
In the Temple of the Gods.
