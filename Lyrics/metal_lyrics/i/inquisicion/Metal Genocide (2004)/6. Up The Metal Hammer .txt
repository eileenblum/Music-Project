So long ago I choose to walk along the road of rock 'n' roll. I am a rebel.
I won't obey the laws, I'm never going to hear the warnings.

This is like I'm going to live. 
I don't care if I get killed.
Nobody will change my mind.
Heavy Metal is the master of my life.

Up the Metal Hammer!!
Rock and Roll shall not surrender
Up the Metal Hammer!!
Just let it shine
Up the Metal Hammer!!
Hit the ground and raze the frontiers
Up the Metal Hammer
And keep it high.

Running across the path of music I have seen 
A lot of friends going the same way.
Like me they refuse to
Sell themselves to this fucking order.
We break down every wall we see.

Up the Metal Hammer!!
Rock and Roll shall not surrender
Up the Metal Hammer!!
Just let it shine
Up the Metal Hammer!!
Hit the ground and raze the frontiers
Up the Metal Hammer
Forever high.

Nobody will change my mind.
Heavy Metal is my life.
