Fire and Violence rule this land.
Enemies with the same blood.
Disloyal soldiers dictate the laws.
A rage that we could never stop.

Danger is coming to cities and towns.

We got to run from the Caravan.

The sin is to not think as they do,
The penance to pay with your life.
We are defenseless, our fate is doom.
No mercy in the killer's eyes.

We are the preys of this human hunt.
We got to run!

Gather your children and your wives
Lead them as far as you can.
We got to run for our lives.
We are innocent criminals.

Out of our country we'll be safe.
Shadows take hold of our hearts
The living memory of our dead comrades
Is the only value we have.

Danger is coming to cities and towns.

We got to run from the Caravan.
