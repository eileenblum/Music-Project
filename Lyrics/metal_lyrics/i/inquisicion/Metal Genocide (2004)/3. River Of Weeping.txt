Sadness is freezing my accelerated heart
This cold room was warm when you were 'round 
Is this a dream? Is this a lie?
I can't believe that you have passed away tonight

I won't resist, I won't survive
Oh god I can't exist
Without the magic of her eyes.
Lost in the mist, I will give away my heart.

A river of weeping running underneath my bed
My feelings will never be the same.
If you can hear my lonely cry
Send me an angel to calm down this bitter mind.

I won't resist, I won't survive
Oh god I can't exist
Without the magic of her eyes.
Lost in the mist, I will give away my heart.
Oh I can not live without you baby.
