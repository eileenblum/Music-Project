His Father sent him for you, He's come to get you now.
You are outta time, you try to fool them, that is crazy man.
He'll carry out the mission, there's no way to hide. 
He's got your destiny, you are going straight to hell.

Walking around, he is in this town 
Searching for you. 
In the dark of a chilling night, a deadly creature roams. He is looking for the soul (you promised).

A living joke, a twisted stroke, 
That's what you were
So you dealt with the devil, and forgot the final date. 
But now is time to pay

No turning back. The fire will burn your eyes
No turning back. From this trip to damnation.
You are going to HELL!

We will sail through the bloody rivers to the giant gates of hell.
In the air the smell of sulfur.
You will face Satan and he will send ya to the torture chambers.
Locked forever inside the house of pain.

Walking around, he is in this town 
Searching for you. 
In the dark of a chilling night, a deadly creature roams. He is searching for your soul.

No turning back. The fire will burn your eyes
No turning back. From this trip to damnation
You are going to HELL!!
