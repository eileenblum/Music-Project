Deep from the abyss a mortal angel has come.
A faceless cruel monster praying terrible chants.

Evil is rising. Collective madness
Rotting mankind. Hell's rebellion is coming here to stay.

(METAL GENOCIDE) Master of Pain.
Haunting the world from the Dark.
(METAL GENOCIDE) King of the Damned.
Soon we'll be kneeling repeating his Black Name.

Anguish and Terror
In the innocent souls.
God is defeated 
We have lost our last hope.

Evil is rising. Collective madness
Crying widows, naked children and corpses in the ground

(METAL GENOCIDE) Master of Pain.
Haunting the world from the Dark.
(METAL GENOCIDE) King of the Damned.
Soon we'll be kneeling repeating his Black Name.

Men is walking to their final devastation.
The eyes of the Black King will control their minds.
Evil is rising, increasing power.
This is the Metal Genocide.

(METAL GENOCIDE) Master of Pain
Haunting the world from the Dark.
(METAL GENOCIDE) King of the Damned
Eclipsing the power of God.

(METAL GENOCIDE) Master of Pain
Haunting the world from the Dark
(METAL GENOCIDE) King of the Damned
Soon we'll be kneeling repeating his Black Name.
