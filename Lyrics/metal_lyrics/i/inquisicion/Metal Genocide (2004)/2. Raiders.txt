I can feel it in my bones
Their presence's energy's so strong
They want to know our deepest fears, 
and make them bigger, cold and real.

A horde of cavalry soldiers
Is ready to attack.
There is no way to holding back.
They crossed the border.
Their powerful force is unbeatable.

Raiders - they come to take our nation
Performing an invasion full of pain.

I can feel it in my veins,
My country's richness, they will drain.
Their gallop's sound is getting louder.
A roar is blasting like the thunder.

Assassinating and raping, 
they brought our power down
and took the control of this town.
The world is burning.
My race fall in the grave of oblivion.

The ashes of this land 
will fly along forgotten time
The crime is done, 
I have to read the final rime

Oh, I feel it in my veins
The raiders came here to stay.
Now that they now our deepest fears, 
We feel them bigger, cold and real.

Assassinating and raping, 
they brought our power down
and took the control of this town.
The world is burning.
My race fall in the grave of oblivion.

Raiders - they come to take our nation
Performing an invasion full of pain.
