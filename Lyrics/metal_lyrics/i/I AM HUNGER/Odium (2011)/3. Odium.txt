Still I screech.
How can I be so surprised?
So overwhelmed by life?
There's just no way to cure me,
I'm subdued by society.
Empty words, oh empty thoughts.
Sickness spreads, soon to reach my heart.
Always been told that I'm free,
I never was, I never gonna' be
Never ever gonna be free.
Still I screech.
My empty words, become empty thoughts.
Sickness spreads soon to reach my heart.
