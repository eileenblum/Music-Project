Can't keep up the pace, I can't keep up this pace.
Exhaustion hits me time after time, and I'm down again.
Don't claim that you're my savior,
You've done nothing to improve my way of life.
Cause I'm carrying the same weight.
Does it matter what I feel or think?
There's always been a missing link.
Try to find love, in a bleeding reality,
There's nothing left to gain for people like you and me.
From the dirt I open my eyes, a million tries to live my life
The way you said was the only way has led me to this day.
(Just stay away)
I don't really give a fuck about you, you never truly gave a damn about me.
You're reaching out with open arms..
(Remember who you are)
You made me this way.
Ain't never gonna look for true love,
Ain't never gonna chase my dreams,
Ain't never gonna hope for a change as long as I'm stuck in these chains.
Ain't never gonna find my way home,
Ain't never gonna yearn for hope,
Ain't never gonna go my way as long as I'm led astray.
I am what I am and this is the price to pay.
Ain't never gonna find my way as long as I'm led astray.
And who am I to think more of myself,
To think that I'm more than anybody else.
I'm lying, denying the everlasting presence of my fears.
Lost at sea, is this what it means to be erased from society?
Depression and rage to a new degree.
(I want to believe in love, I want to believe your intentions are true.)
I want to believe that you are the one to see what love is capable to do.
But I'm gone, no reason to stay.
No family.
