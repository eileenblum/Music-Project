I need somebody to lift me up,
I need somebody with hope to light me up.
Don't ever tell me about love.
You and I don't know a shit of what we're talking of.
We think we got it all right, just can't stop feeling spleen.
Cause all we know about love is illustrated through a fucking TV-screen.
So confused, so emotionally diffused.
Can't find a way to see, what love was meant to be.
Still I'm acing, I'm yearning for a way to fill
This empty space that's deep inside of me.
Why can't I see with my open eyes these obvious lies?
I need to save you, I need you to save me.
Cause we can't make it on our own.
I can't go on this way, I need to find my way back.
I need you to save me, need you to guide me.
I know I've always said that I can go without love,
But I can't, and I'm breaking down.
I need somebody to lift me up,
I need somebody with hope to light me up.
Cause all I see is death, a one way road, no turning back.
My history is told, still I'm looking back from the side of the road.
And in oceans of love I burn my sails and sink into the depths.
I've created my realm of odium.
