I'm building up speed and strength,
Gathering all my rage along the way.
Always on the run, running blind to keep my thoughts away.
How much longer will it take for me to finally break?
Forever by my side you said but,
Forever is a long long time, when you're heading down the wrong way.
The sun just never reach my eyes,
And the rain won't ever wash away,
Wash away this fucking pain.
Forever by my side you said, now you're gone.
You're out of reach, and I'm left alone.
I let it grow, all the hatred I'm carrying within.
Nothing to prove, nothing to chase.
No goals left for me.
If you want me to believe that you care,
And if you truly want to see
See me give love, trust and faith.
Don't hold me down.
If you truly want to see me
Give love, trust and faith.
Don't hold me down.
