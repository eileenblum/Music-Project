Wait for darkness, to fall in madness
And now be my slave of sins
And I catch you, I call you my whore
I overlap you, bitch
And I hurt you, die, die, I'm sick of your old face

[Chorus]
Wake up, you're on my war
Until you leave my home,
Avale, et ne laisse pas une miette

Die, Die
You lie,
Break you,
World of hate collides in our heads

On your wrinkled face, I see your distress
and now I can feel your hate,
And I crush you, a silence around
Your head against the ground

[Chorus]
Wake up, you're on my war
Until you leave my home,
Avale, et ne laisse pas une miette

You lie, lie, lie

[Chorus]
Wake up you're on my war
Until you leave my home,
Avale, et ne laisse pas une miette
Accept my world or die
Follow me on my ride
Suffering coming to an end
