Visions of discord, the sickness soars,
and grows unbound.
Vortex gaping hole, is sucking life,
until it's bland.
Pressure is surging and clutched in my hands.
Bad trip still unfolds, a steaming cold,
to drag me down.

[Chorus]
Wake in a world of waste,
Escape is through the mourning dose,
The needle is your only faith,
As soon as you're hooked on the dope.

Kick the habit out, set up the grounds,
of a new drift.
Bleakness colored now, these lifeless cells,
are being twitched.
Tempest clearing out,
I swear I'll never touch that shit.
Shadow of a doubt, cold turkey's throat,
is 'bout to slit.

[Chorus]
Wake in a world of waste,
Escape is through the mourning dose,
The needle is your only faith,
As soon as you're hooked on the dope.
