Long time, from now,
Our spirits knew no doubt;
To sprawl, unbound,
As far as Earth allowed.

The bond is broken
'tween human(s) and their own kin
And stood up from the simians
Here lies the scene for man's first dawn.

[Chorus]
Two sides, that still collide,
Inside our minds,
Chose one to let the other slide.
Prevail, the simian trail,
Will make you fail,
To seize the main details.

Strength of the mind, still undermined,
has driven blind
Levels the thoughts to breed, to eat,
consume, and buy
And as apes we group as herds,
a social mass of trash
Ready to obey blindly and
strangle the same wrath.

[Chorus]
Two sides, that still collide,
Inside our minds,
Chose one to let the other slide.
Prevail, the simian trail,
Will make you fail,
To seize the main details.
