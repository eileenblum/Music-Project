Cast out
The line of my hand indicates my fate
With no doubt
Blackout
The memories so loud are wrapped in a shroud
Mad house
Is carved on the cave, the cell in which I lay.

No one decides the way
Unless it sounds just as I say

[Chorus]
Peace of mind is not my kind
I'll treat the shit that isn't mine
And rule alone with my drones
To obey my tones
Ramblin' on just makes no sense
Like to hear mu own pretence
Know it all before it's made
Or am I just insane?

Behold
The present of my time on earth is
priceless to hold
Too bold
To bring me down to fold, to an idea of yours
Fallow
My orders as I scold "Do just what I have told".

Taught man to fly alone
So take back your scorn

[Chorus]
Peace of mind is not my kind
I'll treat the shit that isn't mine
And rule alone with my drones
To obey my tones
Ramblin' on just makes no sense
Like to hear mu own pretence
Know it all before it's made
Or am I just insane?
