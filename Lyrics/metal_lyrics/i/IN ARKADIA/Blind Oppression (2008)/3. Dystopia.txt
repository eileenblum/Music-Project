Built our future out of mould
Entertain our selfish souls
Blinding lights our brains are foul
Entering this vile slough

Portrayed hotshot of the hour
Yearning bastards hammering clouts
Idols sold, money flows
Glorify your dough

[Chorus]
Strive against Dystopia, the slough
Wrong turns evening out the crowd
Cleansing off your fraud and lies, riptide
Drown and sink the scum right off your hide

Crippled figures roam at night
Helpless creatures out of might
Features ripped unfold the core
Polluted by mental wars

Taught to buy but not to think
Left our high hopes crash down to sink
Bearing types on display
Bred us to be slaves

[Chorus]
Strive against Dystopia, the slough
Wrong turns evening out the crowd
Cleansing off your fraud and lies, riptide
Drown and sink the scum right off your hide
