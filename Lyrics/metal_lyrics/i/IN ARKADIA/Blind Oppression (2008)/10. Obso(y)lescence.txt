I've had my time,
The figure will fade inside,
And setting ablaze the shrine,
Will fuel the fire, of agony

These worlds are falling down, let it be
Holding on this stagnant sap all out of greed
Stolen from blinded eyes couldn't see
Stripped to the core, death and much more roaming free

[Chorus]
Fell down in a dismal land,
The feeling dead, overthrown,
Strayed on a trail to nowhere,
I see the end, the last milestone.

Ravenous appetite, won't fill me inside
Or quenching this thirst, futile
Same as all of the schemes, a chaff in the breeze
Were meant to redeem the pain

Nowhere left to go to.
Lost the north when I lost you.
Hazy mist I can't see through.
Fuck the struggle it's no use.

Stone lies cold, proof of time, nevermore for light
to shine. A withered cry, in the mist, burnt ash,
where I roamed. As for now on, I walk alone

Nothing can compensate the loss I feel.
Anger steams to bitterness, unlively fiend.
Shrunken chest, Anguish rush, cannot breathe.
Turn your back on the past and walk out alone.

[Chorus]
Fell down in a dismal land,
The feeling dead, overthrown,
Strayed on a trail to nowhere,
I see the end, the last milestone.
