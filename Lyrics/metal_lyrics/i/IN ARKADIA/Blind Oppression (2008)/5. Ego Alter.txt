Self inflict, harmless fix, mind adrift.
M.A, nineteen, senses, fading,
Far beyond insanity.
Centers burst exploding out,
Life in lust I've had enough.

Ha ha ha, human flaws
Bow down to your knees
and crawl.

[Chorus]
Spill, the remains of your will.
Sacrifice your Self. On the altar of Stealth.
Stigmatized but left,
In a conscience that's deaf.
To the pleas inside, Ego parasites.

Backing vocals
Blood-shot eyes
Stigmatized by time-proof scars
Sacrifice your selfish lies

Rising thin, from this skin, walls go dim.
Pulses, Speeding, Visions, Blurring,
Stripping off conformity.
Past illusions meant to hold,
Melt into a stream of mold.

Oozing blood, never mind;
Open up my both eyes blind.

[Chorus]
Spill, the remains of your will.
Sacrifice your Self. On the altar of Stealth.
Stigmatized but left,
In a conscience that's deaf.
To the pleas inside, Ego parasites.

Backing vocals
Blood-shot eyes
Stigmatized by time-proof scars
Sacrifice your selfish lies
