Evil wicked glow the screen is
spraying empty eyes
Blinded by the lies displayed
and airing on prime time
Brains are switching off
As one by one they stall
The clones are marching on as
flies would swarm on rot

[Chorus]
Sail on open sea
Cracked shell as you mean
A pail to keep the boat afloat
Born a useless tool
Bred preemptive bore
The crowd would rather choke than breathe

Dig the frozen land unearthing
with your own bare hands
Startled by the sound of silence
reigning underground
Dig until you fell
In the most dismal cell
The cries of yours are tamed
and dispel in the fray

[Chorus]
Sail on open sea
Cracked shell as you mean
A pail to keep the boat afloat
Born a useless tool
Bred preemptive bore
The crowd would rather choke than breathe
