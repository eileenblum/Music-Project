Storm marches on, troops on trail
Sand fills my eyes, a blind veil
Force fights, spread darkness
Target is locked, murderer's bliss

Puppets' lies are our fate
No will to think, we're just bait
Trying to tame, hostile calls
"Piss us off, we'll kill you all".

Can't see beyond right and wrong
Eyes cannot see, the hypocrisy
Ashes will blow, hoping to sow
Seeds of sorrow that are urging to grow

Can't ever subdue
Ignorance in you
Faithful ally roams
Every devout dome
Killing is god's will, bow 'till your own demise

Scarf on my head, bomb tied close
Eyes are empty, hollow core
Bred by the book that preaches Hate
Jihad calls, new crusade

Slaughter the west and their ideals
Burn the unbelievers' deals
Heathen heads, put on stakes
Justify in god's name.

Can't see beyond right and wrong
Eyes cannot see, the hypocrisy
Ashes will blow, hoping to sow
Seeds of sorrow that are urging to grow

Can't ever subdue
Ignorance in you
Faithful ally roams
Every devout dome
Killing is god's will, bow 'till your own demise

Threshold of my woe
Won't salvage my soul
Frustration as only weapon, kill some more
Truth is biting cold
Blinded eyes so soar
Battle of mine is such a useless cause
