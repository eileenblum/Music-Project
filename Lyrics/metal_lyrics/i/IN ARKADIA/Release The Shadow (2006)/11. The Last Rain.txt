Black rain burns the peeling skin so soar
Behold my wretched corpse
Been breathing life through holes
Drilled in my shrunken throat

Nothing in sight's alive
Has no one else survived?
The unleashing of hell
And captured by its spell

Collect my fallen limps
Pack up my intestines
A journey now awaits
To find life and its fate

The last rain is pouring down
Flooding creatures of the ground
Angry tempest bound to slay
Mankind, its evil ways
Last line has just been crossed
Humanity is lost
Get rid of greed's main man
Last rain, leads to the end

Countless bodies ripped and torn apart
The blinding light has caught
All that had sight and thought
And left me in the dark

Beyond the fallen walls
Where once the urban sprawl
Denaturing us all
Has forced us down to crawl

Shelter me from the rain
That storms inside my brain
Existence seems so bare
When in despair

The last rain is pouring down
Flooding creatures of the ground
Angry tempest bound to slay
Mankind, its evil ways
Last line has just been crossed
Humanity is lost
Get rid of greed's main man
Last rain, leads to the end

Shadows fade, turn to mist
Selfish souls are clean of guilt
Fallout fills, earth and air
Taking back under its care
You beget what you have sown
Harvesting the final storm
Nature thrives, on its own
Sitting back again on its throne
