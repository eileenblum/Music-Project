Jester tilts back his broken crown
Grinning and laughing just for a pound
Clever, wise and deft, inner fog
Shovelling sand into your nightly cogs

Born from the hag, relentless whore
Children of the wrong mouth-like hole
Cherish stink you inhale with love
Deceived you lie awake, nightmare solved

Shove your guilt aside
See the truth confined
Buried treasure lie
In your dozing mind

System brings might to the weak
Forcing the strong to linger deep
Fools are your heroes, their garb you crave
Take it out the closet for your next grave

Tired of living, it's time to lay
Breeding is suicide's sole delay
Trippin' times, figure it out yourself
Stand up to get a life and go to hell

Shove your guilt aside
See the truth confined
Buried treasure lie
In your dozing mind
