Warlords in command
Power in their hands
Puppets in decay
Dark Age here to stay
Holy is their text
Justify your death

Here the blind drive the weak
Reeking corpses, flock of sheep
Ignorance makes 'em free
Beaten down by society
Ignition heals the curse, don't refuse
I'll be the spark to light the fuse

Billboards fill my sight
Colors ghastly bright
Consumption and fear
Making your message clear
Cash flows in your wake
Set our heads on stakes

Here the blind drive the weak
Reeking corpses, flock of sheep
Ignorance makes 'em free
Beaten down by society
Ignition heals the curse, don't refuse
I'll be the spark to light the fuse

Here the blind drive the weak
Reeking corpses, flock of sheep
Ignorance makes 'em free
Beaten down by society
Ignition heals the curse, don't refuse
I'll be the spark to light the fuse
