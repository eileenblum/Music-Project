Survive
Revive
Thrive
Deprived
Collide
Demise
Decide

Darkness all around
Depression stays profound,
Your light remains unfound

Undergo the pain
That's wasted here in vain,
Things will never be the same

Soothing face I see
Fills the void in me,
Disappear to drain me some more.

Reverse, repeat again
Unlock the cage I'm in

Yearns for beyond control
Contempt in your eyes leaves me wanting more
Friend foe unveils from your soul
Die

Senses take control
Obscured forevermore
Revive the vision of it all

Recall the memory,
To flee anxiety,
Off the cliff of sanity,

Ruins of my past
Towered by the mist,
Shadows keep roaming in my soul

Living in the past
Temptation seems to last,
Deny your feelings, for the best

Memories I keep,
Conceal them in so deep,
Scarred for life I what you reap

Reverse, repeat again
Unlock the cage I'm in

Yearns for beyond control
Contempt in your eyes leaves me wanting more
Friend foe unveils from your soul
Die
