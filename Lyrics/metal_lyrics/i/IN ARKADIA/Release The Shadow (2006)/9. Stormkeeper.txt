Reeling in the shadows, insanity concealed,
Stepping out in moonlight, bestiality revealed,
Blood stains on the ground,
Recall the screaming sound.
The rush that floods my mind,
Is craving for more...
Feeding off the hatred, that lies in humankind,
Oppression of the masses, reject it with a crime,
Deep inside my lair, Existence seems so bare,
Drowning in despair, gasping for some air,

Who could ever know?
The emptiness I feel
This voice keeps me alive
Through the hell I live, and...

Feel...
Don't you think that it's time?
Hiding from nothing
Cast my guilt into the sea
Stormkeeper will always be me.

Seeking for a victim, to exercise my might,
Searching for a prey, that will not last the night,
Mist as my disguise,
Demons as my guides,
Always by my side,
Slaughter 'till she...
Dies, to meet a violent death, equal to my pain,
I give what I receive in life, justice has been made,
Life and death are nought,
But states that have been taught,
To never match, but me,
I dwell in both, you see.

Who could ever know?
The emptiness I feel,
Without this voice I'm doomed,
To fall into decay,

Feel...
Don't you think that it's time?
Hiding from nothing
Cast my guilt into the sea
Stormkeeper will always be me

Lying corpse in my hands, bleeding endlessly
Frustration now rising, takes a hold of me,
What creature am I?
To kill when I decide,
The voice that saved my life,
Will take it with a knife

Feel,
Don't you think that it's time?
Hiding for nothing,

Cast my gilt into the sea,
Stormkeeper will no longer...
Feel...
Don't you think that it's time?
Hiding from nothing
Cast my guilt into the sea
Stormkeeper will always be me.
