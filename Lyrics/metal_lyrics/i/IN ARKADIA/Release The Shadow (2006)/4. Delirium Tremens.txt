Agony within swells my eyes
Only but a corpse, where's my pride
Cast away the plague I've been left as dead
Stranger to the hand I once fed

Sniff beyond the dead line
Animosity
Inject it in my spine
Shakes right through me

WOW, madman's truth, gaining ground
Children of an idle brain become sound
Wisdom spoken sadly by the fool
Retribute the visions you abhor

Locked outside the sphere barred from life
Frail and gaunt my bones bear my strife
Whole world's pain is gathered in my disease
Bound by rules that still can't be seized

Sniff beyond the dead line
Animosity
Inject it in my spine
Shakes right through me

WOW, madman's truth, gaining ground
Children of an idle brain become sound
Wisdom spoken sadly by the fool
Retribute the visions you abhor

Shaking fear bereaves with a gasp
Breaking bones released from my grasp
Final breath unfolds, this end so bare
Sing a dirge for me in the reaper's glare

WOW, madman's truth, gaining ground
Children of an idle brain become sound
Wisdom spoken sadly by the fool
Retribute the visions you abhor
