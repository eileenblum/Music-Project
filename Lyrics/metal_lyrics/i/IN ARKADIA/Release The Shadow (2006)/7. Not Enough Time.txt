In due time I'll dirge this out,
But the words will stain and leave you blind,
Darkest of hours distorts my face,
And I scream out a whisper, fall from grace.

Drying off my depleting corpse,
Heart is drained but still keeps to pour.
Distance fading the humming voice,
And blurring my sight.

Hemal fluids stain on the wall,
Proven fast to beat you down and fall.
Echoes answer to my screamin' call,
Time is right for pain.

Now comes my trial,
Looking down on my sufficiency.
Forced to agree,
That loneliness, social apathy.

Force-fed ideas,
Turning stale within, 'till they spill.
Hurling them out before you choke,
Safe you are now, off of the hook.

Sentenced to live,
Among flooding hoards I drown.
Crushed by denial,
Lifeless cell, (yeah, yeah!!)

All that I dread
Brings down my Self
Plaguing my head
Burnt down and tread
Throw it away
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Away

Second voice:
Selfish for life
Carry my strife
Outburst of lies
Closed and confined
Cast 'em aside
Enemy's side
Not enough time
Flee with my crime

Wash off your eyes,
Blackened cloth clears your sins of betrayal.
Open the Dark again,
Diving back in where dreams are so real.

Couldn't care more,
But the trigger's pulled, now die.
Cursed by the horror,
No remorse, 'till later.

All that I dread
Brings down my Self
Plaguing my head
Burnt down and tread
Throw it away
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Away

Second voice:
Selfish for life
Carry my strife
Outburst of lies
Closed and confined
Cast 'em aside
Enemy's side
Not enough time
Flee with my crime
