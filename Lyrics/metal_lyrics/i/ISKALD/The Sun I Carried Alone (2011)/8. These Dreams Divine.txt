Dad, you spoke
I heard you so loud
It felt like the sun came fourth through the cloud
Your words sprang out from ancient beast
She wasnât a prophet and neither a priest
You filled my head with sorrow and doubt
Iâve yet to learn what itâs all about you called me a dirty, not worthy your blood, but for 24 years Iâve crawled in the mud
She spoke of the things I tend to forget my love she derided like a serious threat
Iâll tell you a thing which nobody knows
Over your grave fly carrion crows
What have I done to get such dreams filled with war and painful screams, I am but a child, but you donât see
My dreams are unlocked with your blood as the key
The traitor, she said, I befriended with joy
And mentioned that Iâm not an innocent boy
But in my bed I am waiting for death
Until he takes the last of my breath
My sword it swings and cuts through steel my dreams reflect what I steel fill
I pray through whispers from time to time the answers I get says Iâm the prime
I leave my sleep to get some rest
In living life I'm only a guest
With borrowed time Iâll leave you soon under the sign of the mighty black moon
However I turn my dreams around
It ends with me alone on the ground
Nothing in life shines of divine
Blackened thoughts flow through my mind
My dreams have thought me how to fight to love and hate and live at night
But now Iâm tired, I cease to be with wolfs and men I lived so free
