For what it's worth... no regrets
...When even dawn drew twilight!

Transcend into what's wrong nor right
A glorious struggle for all it's might
Sands of time about to drown
For all I craved, her shining crown

Set sail in sun, let pleasing winds entwine
Nevertheless riding dirty wings towards divine
A journey of bliss waiting to unfold
Now way in hell...!
An emotional void, where all seems so cold

Shaken and torn we couldn't foresee
So I relocate to that place I yearn to be
Life will not end up in ashes and pain
As you have no right for a life to drain

These words of venom I bring thee
Now let me stride on, be free
For I won't be choked down in flames
...As dawn draw twilight
