Beware!
A final bloodshed will declare
Behold!
As retribution will unfold
Regret!
For this will be your final breath

You're all of those things that I despise
I can't even glance, without hatred in eyes
Come cross my path and feel my pain
I promise you nothing, just for death to regain

Never been more than spreading your fears
So nobody cares, nor laughter or tears
Crawl forth in the night and out of my sight
A time for remorse, with glorious might

Then witness the slave of ungodly wrath
For you it's too late, this is your path
Long we've waited the crowning doom
A place of oblivion, now here's your tomb

No amen
No amen
Amen, as the reaping carries on?
