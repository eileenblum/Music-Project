Twelve chimes echo across the soil
Tied within terrors of freezing gust
A moon in might, this midnight we fright
As coffins slit open from within

Ancient souls haunts rotting dirt
To hail the birth of reborn death
What lies beneath, break out and breath
Ascension of reapers to enclave thy womb

Embrace this hour of demise
Invoke the souls of Belial
Embrace this hour of revelation
Summon the servants that reap

Blood spills into unholy ground
A sacrificial ritual for eternal doom
When newborns rise, then pay the prize
Light surrender to everlasting night

Fiery powers swept beyond reach
All chaos unchained for no mortal to see
An abysmal domain, gasp in the pain
The dead shall walk the earth

Embrace this hour of demise
Invoke the souls of Belial
Embrace this hour of revelation
Summon the servants that reap
