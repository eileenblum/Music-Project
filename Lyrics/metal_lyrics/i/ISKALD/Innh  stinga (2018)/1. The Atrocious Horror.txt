We breath, we live, yet there's no thrill
So horror strikes a blazing chill
Unleash those things we can not bear
As terror reigns and sparks the fear

When tides are turned and set ablaze
Now time for you to leave this place
Those ghastly nightmares will not flee
An end so dark is all you see

Atrocious horror
Draw the shortest straw
Entwine where death is law
Atrocious horror
...dreadful 'til the end

No way to hide, no time to weep
The assassin of souls is here to reap
All deads now done
In grief, death once more have won

Atrocious horror
Draw the shortest straw
Entwine where death is law
Atrocious horror
...dreadful 'til the end
