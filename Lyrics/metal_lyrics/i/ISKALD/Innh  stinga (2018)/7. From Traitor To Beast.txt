Black as the night
Most fearsome of all
Seized within Asgard
Doomed to be bound
Son of a traitor
No creature of joy
Brood forth in the dark
With bloodshed at hand

A beast within walls
Only fed by the brave
More vicious each moon
To the point of insane
Chains to be broken
Like no gods prevail
But forged is the Gleipnir
A last dying hope

Entangled from life
'Cause hatred to come
Tyr did the offering
Fenrir chew off his hand
No aid from the Serpent
Nor words from below
The wolf desolated
With sword in its mouth
