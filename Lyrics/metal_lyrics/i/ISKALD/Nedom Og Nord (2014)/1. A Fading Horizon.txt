Life as we know it are about to change
The death clocks are ticking towards the end
A foretold abyss is soon to unfold
Death will be glorious and wear its crown

Existence no longer deserve this realm
Mankind a failure destroying ourselves
Pathetic we crawl through darkest of days
A fading horizon now trembles the soil

A fading light is all we see
A light so shallow, bleak and cold
In a world so lifeless, dismal and grey
Let death come forth, embrace our souls

The dawn to never rise again
A desolated skyline gorged with wrath
Chills of death creeps down our spine
It aims for our doom, the final frontier

From flesh and nails a ship is spawned
The course is set for death, that's all
Apocalyptic tales to infest the domain
The Devil at helm brings no remorse

A fading light is all we see
A light so shallow, bleak and cold
In a world so lifeless, dismal and grey
Let death come forth, embrace our souls

The Ruin of Mankind is soon to unfold
The end days we feared, a future foretold
From that day there will be no one to tell
That all our souls were thrown into hell
