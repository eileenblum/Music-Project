How can it be that I feel this way
My senses devoted to the other side
Darkness is set never to end
The black light my guidance, my only friend

Drained from misery of so called life
No reason to last when life-lust is gone
An everlasting spiral of pain and despair
Existence brought forth the living hell

I find the living worth defying
And admire the art of dying
I am worthy to the ranks of the dead
Bring forth only fear and dread
My doom will conclude as deadly
For I shall become the Underworldly

My dark path will summon a portal so cruel
The entrance awaits so hateful and grim
A gruesome harvest, another prey
For I shall not live another day

Deaths hand brought forth to conquer my soul
Down there awaits my throne so cold
The living now gone, I fell from my tomb
The wrath from below unites my spirit

I find the living worth defying
And admire the art of dying
I am worthy to the ranks of the dead
Bring forth only fear and dread
My doom will conclude as deadly
For I shall become the Underworldly

Hellish! Wicked! Demonic! Infernal!
...I hear them scream
I am finally here to witness my dream
