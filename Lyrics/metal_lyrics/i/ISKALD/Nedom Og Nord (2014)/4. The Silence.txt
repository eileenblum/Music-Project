Withered from the places where I came from
Ravished by the things about to come
Replenished as I rest and await to rise
Humbled when I wake to pay my price

I am the fallen
I am the perpetual
I am the massacre
I am the Silence

The one that haunts the night

Perished are my long forgotten breed
Smothered my bloodline and my seed
Painted but the one you always know
Drained your life is ending now
Bruised from the fighting underneath
Armed with my blades and my teeth
Scorched the burning soil beneath me
Power from the fear that I see

I am the torment
I am the obsolete
I am the concrete
I am the Silence

The phantom in your dreams

Tainted from the pestilence I spit
Forged in hells rotten pit
Smother and the darkness that will follow
Silence - The harbinger of the sorrow

Massive as I rise in the night as dead
Coated in the blood that turns you red
Menace its time to receive my bride
Silence its time for you to hide

I bring the darkness
I bring the blades
I bring the massacre
I bring the Silence!

The mascerade in horror

Burned from the ashes I shall rise
Blinded by the blaze in my eyes
Carnage when I feast on your whelp
Silence when you call for help

Silence - watch me as I flay
Silence - the hunter and the prey
Silence - my blackened cloud unveil
Silence - from the death behind my trail

I bring the darkness
I bring the blades
I bring the massacre
I bring the Silence!

The silence that surrounds you
