The Gatekeepers are holding the obscured key
Watching and killing things we never thought to see
They keep order on faith and reality
Guarding the mystical demonic gate

As sand springs to dust she opens the gate
Dressend in her gloomy light she takes our heart in the night
Fearless as an ancient warrior she walks the path of the dead
On black bones of tombstone she lies in her bed

Beyond the seven gates she must travel
To overtake the mighty underworld domain
Ereshkigal's face gloomed up her rage
The throne on which she stands

Trained by the souls of the dead
Tortured by the sister and the beast
Feasted on her own sweat and blood
She rules the dark part of ....Eden!

Eden!

Trained by the souls of the dead
Tortured by the sister and the beast
Feasted on her own sweat and blood
She rules the dark part of ....Eden!
