Time stands still
The dim light in horizon has faded
The winds of the sea has gone
Coldness is left behind
The sun has found better places

Wolves howl in fear
Their castle is a throne of shadow
Their lust isn`t mentioned in words
Ancient wisdom reigns
Our fathers has awakened

Sorcery written in blood
A torch breaks the addicting silence
A shape of forgotten times is rising
Life is long gone
Even ice is freezing

[Ref:]
You have seen them in the eyes
You can smell their terror inside
With shapened blades they fight
The warriors of northern twilight

Sons of serpent chaos
They ride the wings of sorrow
They mourn to heed their dead
Driven by their lust
The dead rise in fear

Scholared by immortality
Rulers of black moonlight
Rulers of illuminative kingdoms
We shall never forget
They`ll make us forgive

Shadows of aurora
They attack where we can`t defend
In our dreams they take us in hand
With pride they kill
Demonized they are!

You have seen them in the eyes
You can smell their terror inside
With shapened blades they fight
The warriors of northern twilight

We feel cold
We are loosing our dreams
We have been vanquished
By the warriors of northern twilight!
