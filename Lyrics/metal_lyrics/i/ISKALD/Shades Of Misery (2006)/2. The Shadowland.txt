Welcome to the Shadowland
This place where evil seems to reign
The land has drowned in chaos
An unknown power is commanding this domain

Enter this mortal land
Inhale the smell of death
Watch the fallen victims
Crawl into this endless pain

Coldness is surrounding the landscape
Darkness is hunting the air
The ground trembles in thunder
Death is now serving everywhere
