An echo of demise is roaring wild
Days has turn into perpetual nights
The horns of anguish is blowing hellish
Our doom now sealed in utter darkness

Tormented and weak we rest in pain
Eternal affliction will confine us all
Bereavement shall sweep through every soul
Punishment from below has come to reap

Heed the call of Armageddon
This is the day for Revelation
Kneel before the gods of Devastation
Sense the wrath of unholy Redemption

The blackened sun glimmers in obscurity
Lasting and blazing our minds insane
A final harvest is soon to commence
The dead shall now wander the earth

Down on our knees we fall
This is Doomsday's call
Praying to be speared
No mercy will be shown

Heed the call of Armageddon
This is the day for Revelation
Kneel before the gods of Devastation
Sense the wrath of unholy Redemption

This is the Ruin of Mankind
The night humanity shall fall
Now inhale your final breath
Sense the apocalyptic aftermath.
