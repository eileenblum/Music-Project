As young I traveled alone
In places the sun is dark
A land even the dead fear
Immortals with axes and spear

Born in the shadow
A shade beneath a stone
Taught by the night
How to die in fight

Forged by hollow screams
Vengeance is my beast
Immortals tore my home
I shall walk alone

I venture back and fourth
I failed to sacrifice
The mighty gods i heed
Lost is now my bead

Black is now my mind
Devouring hatred fulfilled
The dead are leaping back
It's time for another attack

Steel shimmering in twilight
Voices of helfspeak arise
I spill my blood to the one
Realizing my inner con

The legion is thoroughly formed
The ranks are reset and waiting
Swords replaced my sarkened soul
A Warrior of Northern Twilight

In the past I dreamed a dream
Of coming home to light
I found my path of walking
A roar where no ones talking

The road to perdition I ride
Amongst skulls and bones
The dead I travel along
A rotten ghoul I've become

The chill is freezing lungs
Our journey leads north
To lands where I haven't been
Castles and thrones none has seen

Humans split the ranks
By the smell of warm flesh
I hear the scream of pain
The screams that made me insane

My corpus is written
Coven many steps ahead
A great battle is dwelling
More death than the story telling

The legion is thoroughly formed
The ranks are reset and waiting
Swords replaced my sarkened soul
A Warrior of Northern Twilight

They taught me none of joy
Their mouth was all so closed
They didn't tell me right from wrong
When I wrote my ending song

Craving for blood
I stand in the front
Legend has become never ending tales
As the legion set up their mighty sails

Savage and fast
We storm their fort
Rebelling with their human mind
Reaping and thrusting, every kind

What do they hold
Why do they speak
We've come here for glory
We've come here for pain

Swords sing the golden song
Survival of the sickest
Shield bash momentum
Battle-ages ultimatum

The legion is thoroughly formed
The ranks are reset and waiting
The clockwork frames pending
A Warrior's life ending.
