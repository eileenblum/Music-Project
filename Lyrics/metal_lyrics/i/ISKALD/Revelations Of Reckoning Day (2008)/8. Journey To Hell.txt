Come enter the dominion of Niflheim
A wasteland so gloomy and cold
Inhale the mist and steam of death
The Day of Judgment is soon to appear

The march along the Shore of Corpses
Suffer the serpent Nighogs fury
Fallen warriors will mark the way
As twilight encircle these lifeless fields

Pass through the town of Valgrind
A black forest linger in the haze
The storm of Hraesvelg raise hellish
Gjallarbru now waits in the north

Come forth to the domain of Helheim!
Come forth to the throne of Hel!

Cross the bridge of no return
Fear the skulls and bones from below
The flames of Munspelheim grow higher
Garm and Modgud bid you welcome to Hel

Sense the dark aura of Helheim's rage
Lifeless souls are lurking in the fog
Look upon the dim hall of Eljudnir
The paths of Helvegr is onto an end

Come forth to the domain of Helheim!
Come forth to the throne of Hel!

She rest there so silent and bleak
A gruesome creature of hatred it is
The night has come for you to be slain
Her abhorrence will fulfill your nightmares.
