The gate of Hell now open
Eternal suffering to come
No mercy to be shown
Tartarus awaits!

Into the abyss we descend
Diabolic afterlife awaits below
Purgatory unleash it's wrath
Tartarus awaits!

By the flames we are reborn
Slaves of the diabolical kingdom
Our souls teared apart, our minds insane
Tartarus we now heed!
Tartarus we now heed!
