Lethal injection in the skull
Tranquil fluid enters the brain
Incision made with surgical precision
Plastic tube inserted in the vain

Incurable chronic disorder
Total paralysation lurking ahead
Stiffening of limbs, blood runs cold
Psychic molestation

Serenade of the death-less
You will slowly transpire
Serenadium of the death-less
Painful submission to cancer

Your only perception is the pain
Of your body that slowly corrodes
The only thing left that is real to you
Is the menacing torment that is devouring you
