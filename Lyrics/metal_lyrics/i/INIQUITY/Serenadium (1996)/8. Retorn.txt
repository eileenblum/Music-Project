I am one of the flock
Like them, I lie dreaming
Clenching my rose of blackness.
Dwelling in sunken valoorni

Help me out of this war that keeps haunting me

Laugh at me, mock me, Confine your banished mind
Tempt his way nadve web of frustrations in you

It was the darkness of my youth
When I came upon the man who warp my mind astray
He taught me ways of seeing
Into other spheres of reality
Where no mind saves the insane
Can fathom what it beholds

The man in black
Teachers of the master's art
Messenger from the outer limits
Of indefinable time and space
