In the center of the universe
In the midst of oblivion
Is where the seat of power is found
Soaked by unspeakable madness

Deity beyond description
Abhorrence absolute
Intense madness it is
Of what I dare not speak

Older than the void
Son of the cosmos
He will still remain
Aeons after our time

A torturous seed implanted in me
Embedded in my strain of thoughts
Enlightened by my killing tendency

Violence, a dominating supremacy
