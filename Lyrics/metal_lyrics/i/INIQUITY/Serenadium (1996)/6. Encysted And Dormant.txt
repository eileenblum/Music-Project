Entering the blood flow
Convention invisible
Causing a rapid terminal infection
Atrocities deformation of the bodily system
Alien spores flowing unbound
Beneath the smoldering flesh

Growing immensely inside
Converting the living tissue
Into rubbery decomposium matter

Spreading the slender filaments
Through the circulary system
The transformation immediate
Limbs turn to fungus flesh

Once encysted and dormant
The spores survive for centuries

Cataclysmic hallucinations
Marks the beginning
Encysted and dormant
