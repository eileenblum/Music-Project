Injecting the drug
Awaiting it's effect
Sending back the mind
Into the abyss of ages

Not knowing of the peril
Await there souls beyond
There's a hideous price to pay
For knowing the beginning

Blush protoplasmic icon
Shows the presence of them
Called upon by curious mortals
Seeking knowledge of the ancient past

Standing on the shores
Beyond time and space
Escaping through the aeons
Seeking back to presence

Scented through timeless ages
Approaching through geometrical gates
Infiltrating healthy dimension
To feast on the life therein
