Celestial Journey,
Intercession of spheres
Interstellar release
The cosmic reappears
Drift among stars,
Flow vainly into black
Tranquil body seizured
But mentally relaxed

Shedding of worries
Mind quest no fear
With gravity behind me
In rapture I sear
Reaching out gently to touch and contrast
But deceived by this contour of images so vast

With gravity behind me
And destiny in hand

With gravity behind me
And destiny in hand
My body slithers paralyzed
Into emptiness
