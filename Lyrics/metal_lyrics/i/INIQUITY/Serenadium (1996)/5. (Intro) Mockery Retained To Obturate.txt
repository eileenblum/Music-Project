Facially scarred from the chronic sickness
Mockery retained to obturate

Lucid fairytale, envy the sane
Delicious wishes of escape
Conceived by a shackled reality
Sense of only pain
Approaching total tranquility
Ray of the sun drawn back once again

Signed approval contamination
Archaically involved within the strain
Septation of continuous growth
Redeemed by a poisonous fate

A lumid death unfolds
From every miscroscopical pore
Brain shuts of at heart's last toll
Convulse reduces emotional uproar
Not to mention or express
What rest, besides our soul
Stalking in despondent search
To reach the ivory throne

Septation of continuous growth
Redeemed by a poisonous fate
Signed approval contamination
Archaically involved within the strain

Whatever appears in the back of my mind
That will cause this contagious disease to erupt
And corrode on mankind

I solemnly search To prevent what is ahead
Retreat from innermost conflicts
For thou shall sharpen your face
