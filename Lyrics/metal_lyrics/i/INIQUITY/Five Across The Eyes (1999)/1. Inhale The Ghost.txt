Balance the ledge of life 
Perplexed existance causing strife 
The lines are written in your eyes 
Fantasize a night of sleep 
The vicious circle borrowing deep 
One on another, although you despise 

Flush down your memories 
Eject the past 
A virtual existance 
A peak of the flask 

Abused, abusing, accused of using 
Dealing, declining, fatally resigning 
Push the needle, inhale the ghost 
Crush the pill, increase the dose 

Despondent, fumbling through a blurry haze 
Trembling, cold sweat running from a pale face 
Repellent visions of the staggering truth 
Deny yourself and your shat upon death 

With life entwined in the veil of death 
And future sliding down the drain 
Contorted in societies of man 
And loss of will to try again 
Struggling lifeless amongst debris copulating unwillingly 
A fatal trust in what you repent 
A retorted reprisal with a twisted intent 

Flush down your memories 
Eject the past 
A virtual existance 
A peak of the flask
