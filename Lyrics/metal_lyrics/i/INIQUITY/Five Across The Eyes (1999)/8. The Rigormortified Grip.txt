Rotted carcass fast descending 
A hollow shell stabbed through the core 
Winds of hatred sweeps the room 
As another victim hits the floor 

Blood has no limit 
As I take your last breath 
Cast into disinfigurement 
Welcome death 

A twist of sanity, obscure defeat 
Obsessed with the inanimate 
Procedure forced upon the dead 
Deranged and erect I penetrate 

Hand that grasp the velvet rope 
In a rigor mortified grip 
Eyes that glister dead distress 
As semen meets the lip 

The grip of man upholds 
Skin tightened to the bone 
Buckled knees copllapse again 
Your narrow shadow fall in vain 

Flesh rubbed in certain death 
Senses start to boil 
Euphoric state of arousement peaks 
You and I wound up in a coil
