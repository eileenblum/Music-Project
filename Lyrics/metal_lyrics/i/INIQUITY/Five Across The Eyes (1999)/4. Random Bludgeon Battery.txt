Upside down upheld in wires' grip 
Vocal chords severed rasping sound emit 
Split your sphincter to set free 
Torrents of blood and shit 
Buzz saw screaming 
Leather straps sealing 
Ice pick strikes bloodied eye 
Severe torture is what is in store 
Sewer breath cretin yearns for more 

Eager squirts, turbo outburst 
Cumshots dangling, unleashed urge 
Mongoloid with a goggle-eyes stare 
Delivers his share of future in your hair 

Willingly beaten, fucked and hit 
By a twisted mind with no repentance 
Your bloated heart convulsing stops 
Join the dirt and feed the crop 

Suspended body trashed around 
Random bludgeon battery 
Beat you till you hit the ground 
Random bludgeon battery 

Turmoil of bloodspray covers face 
Random bludgeon battery 
As you clash into a rearranged disgrace 
Random bludgeon battery
