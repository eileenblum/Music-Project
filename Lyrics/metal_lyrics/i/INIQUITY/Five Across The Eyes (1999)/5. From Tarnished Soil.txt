Blissfully awaken from tarnished soil 
Resurrected, infected degenerate toil 
No longer restrained by corporeal chains 
Soul charged, but cold, numb and stained 

Sworn into a perilous quest 
Plundering the pure on request 
Entranced by primal sorcery 
An eventide of cruelty 

Submission into the nighted depths 
Grasping at the silvery string 
Life-force returned as rivers of ice 
Bestowed by the Monarch twice 

Blissfully awaken from tarnished soil 
Resurrected, infected degenerate toil 
No longer restrained by corporeal chains 
Soul charged, but cold, numb and stained 

Developing membranous wings 
Hovering above the usurper 
Inside a spherical wasteland 
Toll of time disconnected 

From vaults of spiritual condemnation 
Called aforth by astral contemplation
