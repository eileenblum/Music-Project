Impossible tortured shapes 
In uncanny theatric vigour 
Haunt the petrified forest 
Through which I trace the path 
To the bitumen grounds 
Where my bloodline linger 
Descend the marble steps 
Scintillating in the eerie light 
Of a mercurial moon 
Suspended in ageless journey 
Across infinite sidereal seas 

Beyond confines of constellations 
In wraithform forever to abide 

Transcend the ebony gates 
Guarded by the outcasts of fortune 
To colossal limestone vaults 
Where cognate roots tarnish 
Insonorous contemplation 
And August replete antiquity 

Beyond confines of constellations 
In wraithform forever to abide 

Merge with archaic intelligence 
Devoid of mortal embodiment 
Swept by empyrian tides 
Into the maelstroem of oblivion
