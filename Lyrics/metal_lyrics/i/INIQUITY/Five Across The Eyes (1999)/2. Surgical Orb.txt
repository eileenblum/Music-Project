Suction needle inserted through the eye 
Insidiously penetrating the frontal loap 
Lids react with spasmodic tension 
Matter extracted by tenacious mechanics 

Back arches in a perfect curve 
Laser scalpel begins to serve 

Skin peeled from the thighs and the back 
Purplish blots shower the neck 
Rubbery tubes appear from nostrils 
Rejected gush abandons tonsils 

Eager greyish fingers 
Tightening the straps 
Surgical orb lingers 
Genital tube extracts 

DNA sequence synthesized 
Fused with alien matter 
Cloned, designed to infiltrate 
Impossible to germinate 
Torn from domestic dormacies 
Forced into lightning pregnancy 
Vacuum bag ensures paralysis 
Infant in genetic analysis 

Anthropoid skeletal shell retained 
In incubation 
Oversized eyes of black stare empty 
An indication 

Suction needle inserted through the eye 
Insidiously penetrating the frontal loap 
Lids react with spasmodic tension 
Matter extracted by tenacious mechanics 

Back arches in a perfect curve 
Laser scalpel begins to serve
