Bleak roll the cosmic sea 
From dismal shores of a barren world 
Grim foreboding translates 
From far-flung nameless nebulas 

The sun shall set forever 
And dusk will choke the desolation 
Of this world shrouded in rapture of ruin 
Freed from misgivings of a feeble race 

This blasted plain, a focal point 
To immence apocalyptic tribulation 
Pinnacle of destruction towers 
The summoning of the elder void 

Under the pall darkness encroaching 
Humanity squierms in the pyres of atonement 
The overture of our terminal dirge 
Pleaded in vain to an empty sky 

Hearken the call 
Eaters of soil and dwellers in the depths 
Rise from your earthen wombs 
And smite the light 
Quicken from frigid rest 

Vortex of our ancestry 
Reclaims forgotten past 
Emptiness prevail in disincarnate splendour 
Free to roam at last 

Hearken the call 
Eaters of soil and dwellers in the depths 
Rise from your earthen wombs 
And smite the light 
Quicken from frigid rest 

Bleak roll the cosmic sea 
From dismal shores of a barren world 
Grim foreboding translates 
From far-flung nameless nebulas
