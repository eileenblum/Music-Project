Feverish rites submerged in decay
Conducted below the bleeding moon
Rebirth of the ones ruling before
Reigning supreme with nightmarish divinity

Tentacular entity pulpish appearance
Intellectually superior
Aberration to the human mind

One with the hidden lore
And the mystery of primal earth
And unforgettable aeons

Sensing the presence of an alien life form
Frantic fear of exposure
Slithered in shadows obscured

Teeming with fluid from afar
Bred by alien gods
Seething with the power of travel
Beyond cosmic barriers

Then I viewed the darkest glens
The decaying remains
Of infinite blackening:
