Silence lurks the streets of tomorrow
It shall be a glorious day
Despised is the way I may follow
Impatiens is pushing me to put you away

Maintaining the present law protecting myself causing fear,
Like a soldier hungry for war controlling you crushing your tears
Preparing myself for the battle to come
My weapons are loaded and ready to kill

I wield it in rage, taught to crush the minority

Tense in a special way, Erection uncontrolled
Awaits tournament, our fate is ominous
History won't forget, this fucked up government.
I love the democracy, so concrete and merciless

Chaos spreads around fulfilling most of my pleasures
Negligent as I roar, Bodies dropping dead to the ground

Aggression no remorse I'll never stop my disordering,
Until I see rivers of blood and victory will be mine:
