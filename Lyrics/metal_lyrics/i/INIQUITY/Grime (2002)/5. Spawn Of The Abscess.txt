[Lyrics: Meier/Haarlov]

Syringe injected into tender skin
Throat is flooded as the needle sets in
Tied down, brittle screams are choked
Vocal chord in corrosive liquids soaked

Naked scrotum stuck in a vice
Executioner snarling rolling the dice
Intestines churn at the sight of his tool
Bones merely pulverize, blood forms a pool

Canines sink into tender flesh
As buttocks give way violent thrash
In bludgeon he's slowly closing his mesh
Vivid eyes stares at the gash

Knife inserted releasing intestinal hold
Vacuum seals the steel probing bold
Twisting and turning the gleaming blade
Liver torn as the butcher unveils his hate

Bladder delivers the last cup of piss
As protruding steel waives it's tomb
Fetid gas emits with a hiss
Releasing the tension holding the womb

Blood and puss race through a soggy wound
Restless vessels exempt a rancid fume
Methane piped in a gastric tube
From which ingested faeces slowly exude

Trapped within this pointless act
Find yourself screaming, backbound and gagged
Gaffed and suspended in the grip of fear
Knowing your final hour is drawing near

Pallid skin yields to the blade
Watching your own bowels emancipate
Blood steams from the basement floor
As jigsaw buzzes rapidly to your core

Spawn of the abscess of society
Five across the eyes of sobriety
Inclined to dismemberment and heinous deeds
I prowl the comfort of your pristine streets
