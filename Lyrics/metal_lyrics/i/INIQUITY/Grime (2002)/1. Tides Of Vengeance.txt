[Lyrics: Fagerlind/Haarlov]

A lonely shape in a phantom court
Where wraith lights dance from dead braziers
Tortured to illuminate this immense abandon
With spectral shadows of immemorial past

Descent in plague-ridden dormancy
A lichen king of a distant cull
Stripped from grace in infamy
With a rusty crown pried from his skull

Immense upheaval as tides of vengeance flow
A charnel earth cloaked in death
The cup of fate has tipped again
Destiny carved by grim malign
Overruled through endless ages
At the bosom of the depth

Quest the calling
Through realms of hadean splendour
Emolliate the world
In a skeletal grip of betrayal

Cypress? cast last saturnine shadows
The moon will spew its final glow
Stars as corpselights snuffed on a grave
On a forgotten world dust will settle
Monarch of the apocalypse raises his chalice
To this, his ultimate sanction
Asphyxiate as darkness dances
Under bibleblack nighted domes
