[Lyrics: Fagerlind/Haarlov]

Morbid machinery, sustained monstrosity
Genetic abomination in hideous atrocity
Wrinkled body torn from formaldehyde
Placed gently on a silver bed for slowly to revive

Pipes and devices steaming, searing hot
Frost subsides undo rigor mortis knot
Raped in incubation by a bloody fingers poke
Science of damnation in sinful deeds soak

Crystallized blood regains obstructed flow
Joints crack `neath skin turned black
Pruned eyes gaze as fingers let go
Of the grip of suspension, resurrection bestowed

Torn from dormancy in the cryogenic vice
Ripe for bleeding, thawed for breeding
Bone piped thighs slowly pried apart
Scientist of no remorse revels in his art

Skin sloughed off in tatters
Probing the anaemic meat
Agonized and randomly incised
In his conceit

To his PHD of condemnation
He adds another page
As lobotomized pet mongoloids
Are cackling in their cage

Unzip into velvet revelation
Sliding up the aisle within
Ride the winds of rancid defecation
Coalesce with jellified skin

Catatonic and fertilized
Yet eyes fixed and dilated
The birthing of the undefined
Exit the perm frozen related
