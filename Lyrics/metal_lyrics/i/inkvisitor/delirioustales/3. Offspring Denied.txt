The festering little seeds of this thing known as life
All the ones you had in your possession
For these protected beings you don't have to fight
They are torn completely apart and don't breathe anymore

Finding yourself abruptly
Cut from below
Showering from the wound
Breaks apart reaching the bone
Nothing to lose anymore
No longer a man
Now witness the end of your line
The end of your real life

Missing between your legs
A certain feeling of emptiness is present
Seeking cure, not finding any
For it to work, you need to concieve
You've lost your breeding machine
No one will ever fancy you again
The will to live has gone
Let's see how long you'll hang around

You've lost everything
No longer a man
Rest in pieces
