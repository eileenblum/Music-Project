Never
Have I had the slightest bit of foolish and hopeless superstitions
Cutting my sanity only to fit
And to complete All of life's missions
Still under my feet
Deep in a solid concrete I find forgotten faces
With pairs of dead eyes
With a denying mind
I smash their faces in
Put an end
To those haunting smiles

The simple law of ancient cavemen
Pure rage against my mind
These horrifying images
Obledged again to smite

Haunted
By these paranormal beings I now have lost track
Of what's right
Tearing down
My own house
To hit the bastards Where they dwell

Dead Faces Forgotten tombs
Spirits and souls Soar in me
Restless ghosts Fear of the unknown
Damnation I am Forced to see
Pathetically afraid
I swing back and forth Trying not to let those
Eyes haunt my every step
I foresee them Burning in hell
Cursing with my Final testament
Before they lie
Rot in the ground
I will not rest
I'll put my soul to the test
With a self confident mind I take my own life
With revenge on my mind I start the final fight

The faces of BelmeÌz
Will haunt me until I die
Then I take them with me to see
What's on the other side
