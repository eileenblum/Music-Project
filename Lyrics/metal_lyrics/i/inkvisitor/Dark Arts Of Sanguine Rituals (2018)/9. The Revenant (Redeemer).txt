[Lyrics by Jesse KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen]

All is lost, my doom
I am fading away
Line's crossed, voice heard
Your time isn't yet

Drift to black, wake up home, all is well
You must tell, where is him, what the hell
I must know now!

I was dead but now I'm back
Resurrected from the dreamless void
It was a test and I prevailed
All revealed knowledge passed

The old withdraw so the young may rise
A new dominion without compromise
Covenant without god
The Revenant will arise

A trail gone cold, how will this unfold?
Left behind was a book of old
A letter inside, tells bindings my guide
Everything is passed
He fled earth as I proved my worth
Now I am the heir

I was dead but now I'm back
Resurrected from the dreamless void
It was a test and I prevailed
All revealed knowledge passed

The old withdraw so the young may rise
New dominion, no compromise
A covenant without god
The Revenant will arise

The victory defeated me; I became marooned in this reality
I felt the paradigm shift, but now you carry the torch
Dark arts of sanguine rituals, these are yours, use them well
But beware not to lose yourself
