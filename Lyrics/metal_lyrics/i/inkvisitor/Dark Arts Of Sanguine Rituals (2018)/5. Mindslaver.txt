[Lyrics by Jesse KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen]

Why I chose you, I'm overdue
I've seen enough, there's nothing on this earth anymore

The world lost it, the unity
The vanity took its place
Now I'm going to the other side

Man lost himself in the pages of history
For a sake of a man made god

Unanswered questions, I seek redemption
It can't be found here, leaving to the other side

Descent to darkness and may the bridges burning light the way
Ascend from madness to walk among gods
It is your destiny

Mankind has failed, brotherhood has been lost
The prison of the mind
And the cancer of your soul
Complete the ritual, sacrifice your family
Through death you'll be born again
Reclaim your throne

To have this power a sacrifice is needed
Blood of your family completes the ritual
Provide the lifeblood and I will guide you
Let go of yourself and be born anew
