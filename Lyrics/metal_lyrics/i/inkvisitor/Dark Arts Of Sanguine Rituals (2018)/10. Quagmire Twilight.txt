[Lyrics by Markus MartinmÃ¤ki and Jesse KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen]

I found myself wandering swamp as far as I can see
Legs heavy, cast to lead, should I trust my eyes blindly

In a distance mountains stories high time seems like a river passing by
But I'll stay for a while instead, a long long trip ahead

Do you understand?
Purple Mountain rises, reaches the skies to tell me lies
I'm knees deep in peatland, the land is glass now
My reflection left me alone

And over the twilight illuminating the endless nights
Beacon lit with wildfire, together insanity dies
These grounds so unholy, sun so scorching
High winds blowing

Am I trapped in here forever, last flower as my only leper
Finding my way out stumbling Penrose steps to a bottomless well

Forceful thunder cracks the sky
Air is flowing with electricity, pink acid rain falling
Implosion of the brain, path of the left hand
Green glowing barren wasteland

And over the twilight illuminating the endless nights
Beacon lit with wildfire, together insanity dies

Step by step to nowhere, never-ending nightmare
Finding my way out stumbling Penrose steps to a bottomless well

Sanity shipwrecked on shoals of psychedelia
Beacon of madness shining in the distance
Guiding me to ethereal desolation of loneliness

And over the twilight it is time for me to fly
Finding my way out stumbling Penrose steps to a bottomless well

So what if we are insane, we have walked through fields of pain
Finding our way out stumbling
At least we've got a good story to tell
