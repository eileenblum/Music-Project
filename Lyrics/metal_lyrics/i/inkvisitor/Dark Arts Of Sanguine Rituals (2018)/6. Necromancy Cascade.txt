[Lyrics by Markus MartinmÃ¤ki]

Through darkness of future past
The necromancer wants to see
One chance between two worlds
Never to be complete

They wouldn't understand
Amidst the mist echoed a squeal
Walk with me
The lack of empathy, obsession to necessity
My manifest destiny

The match is lit, mind has been set
Grab them from their beds and bring them to me
Can you smell the sulphur, scorched oil, feel your blood boil?
Don't try to avoid what you were made to be

Imprisoned in eternal cell
Firm grasp around their necks
Can you hear the toll of the bell
Accompanying our last dance

Cascade
Fall

Enough is enough it's time to start
Let us start

Knock 'em out cold and silence comes
Lights out

Cascade
Fall

Take them now lock in a trunk
It is done

Don't forget your shovel and shotgun
Load it up

Drive'em far to hang on a wall
Upside down

Now take this knife and begin the ritual

They didn't understand
Amidst the mist echoed a scream
Walk with me
The lack of empathy, obsession to necessity
My manifest destiny
They didn't understand
To diverging stream
Walk with me
Obsessions, necessities, my manifest destiny
Cascading necromancy
