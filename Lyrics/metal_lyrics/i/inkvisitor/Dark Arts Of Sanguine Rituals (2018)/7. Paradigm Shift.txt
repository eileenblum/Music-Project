[Lyrics by Markus MartinmÃ¤ki]

Well how did I come this far
Moments away from becoming immortal
A bloody overflow
Sanguine entity hits the floor

Hardened veins filled with black tar
Cannot be torn apart
Did I come this far?
Unfinished piece of art

And I feel his breath behind me
A lust for lives to end
A mission merciless
A sense of fear

A glance in their eyes, commencing to comprehend
My mind had been poisoned

What have I become, blackened heart
Soul full of tar wickedness took part
What have I become, brother in arms
So full of tar wickedness took part

Do it!
Little lives mean nothing
Do it!
Life eternal forthcoming
Do it!
Beginning of a new end
Do it!
And I won't be bent
Do it!
Amending

So rip your head right off for me
Sudden awakening
The end is near, this reign ends here
And the necromancer soon to be fucking dead
