[Lyrics by Markus MartinmÃ¤ki]

Isolated, not alone
My thoughts are not my own anymore

Strict mind dissolving walls
Fill'em with conjectures and symbols

Abandoned my kin, deserted wife and offspring
By drinking too much, loading veins with drugs

Years of evidence and material
Where's the answer, where can it be found

Seek existence in a mirror
But it's not my reflection

Come tomorrow again
Won't quit even if I go insane
Saw the sun before this begun
Unveil the shadow by blowing off some dust

I'm living in a head of a murderer
Solution hanging by a thread
Like being controlled by conjurer
Every night dreams blood red

Where's my mind, where has it gone
Am I a fool neglecting all?

There's a man in a mirror
But it's not my reflection

Searching through everything I have ever found
Diving in my mind to see what's it all about
Browsing papers, thousands of papers, portraits painted
Shadow lies in a picture it looks just like him

Avoiding death like this, impossibly bound
Two men are the same, when was he born?
Hundreds of years, it clears, answers awaken
The wise man I met, it must be him

Searching through everything I have ever found
Diving in my mind to see what's all about
Avoiding death like this impossibly bound
Two men are the same, where is he now?

Avoiding death like this impossibly bound
Diving in my mind to see what's all about
Searching through everything I have ever found
It's dead or alive, law abides, get out now
