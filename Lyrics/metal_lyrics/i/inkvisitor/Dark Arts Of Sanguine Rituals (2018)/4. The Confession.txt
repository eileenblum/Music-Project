[Lyrics by Jesse KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen and Markus MartinmÃ¤ki]

Driving like a maniac to make an arrest
Keep on accelerating, red lights won't keep me waiting
Same bar every night, I've got the suspect in my sight
As I start to read his rights, he says there's something you should know

Why do you think I sit here alone
I've been waiting for you all along
Now listen carefully because

I practise conjuring and necromancy
All the murders were done by me
So let me tell you the receipt for a sacrifice
You already know how long I've been alive

I am the one you've been looking for
And I've got a secret for you
If you want to survive the end of life
Then somebody has to die

And if you want to stand the test of time
An innocent one must die
You are to become my partner in crime
All my powers are to be yours

It all seems so fascinating
Immortality or morality
Is it something I can't justify

He practises conjuring and necromancy
All the murders were done by him
So better brace yourself but not for a fight
I already know how long I've been alive
