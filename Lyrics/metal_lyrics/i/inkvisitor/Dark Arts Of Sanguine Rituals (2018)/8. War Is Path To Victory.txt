[Lyrics by Markus MartinmÃ¤ki]

War! Iron curtain call!

Fist coils into an iron ball
Don't need a fucking gun
When I ram fist thousand miles an hour
To his sternum shattering bones to dust

Doesn't stagger at all, extending claw
Slits my wrist blood begins to pour

What do you think you know'bout war?
I've seen it all and a thousand more
Not giving up, surrender and crawl
Bow down, even legions fall

What do I think I know'bout war?
Spare a life hand over your own
Violence consists of certainty
That war is a path to victory

A chance to counterstrike
Cut them loose, run for your lives
An attack from behind, I'm running out of time
Unstoppable frenzy, smash his face with high efficiency,

War! War! War! War!

I'm still alive, but why won't he just die?
A shotgun shell, unload a barrelful to his head
I can still hear evil laughter in my ears
This is the end; swallow a barrel full of lead

What do I think I know'bout war?
I've seen it all and a thousand more
Not giving up, surrender and crawl
Bow down, even legions fall

What do you think you know'bout war?
Spare a life hand over your own
Annihilation of your enemy
War is a path to victory
