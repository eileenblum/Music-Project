[Lyrics by Jesse KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen]

As weeks
Turn to months
He keeps in hiding

He kills again
The ritual's the same
I'll end his reign

This ancient way
Again on lunar day
There's no running away

Searching diaries
Deep in libraries
The answer is there

Like chasing a shadow
I can't let it go

Dark books tell the tale
That set me on his trail

Chasing a shadow
A mighty foe

Dark books tell the tale
The mystery will unveil

A literate man
Came to me
Says he can guide me

Sheds light on the case
Almost grasping the answer
This world is a maze

An odd man
A polite man
Indeed a wise man

Ancient legends
Tell the truth
Necromancy is the key

Stillâ¦
â¦A piece missingâ¦
The answerâ¦
â¦keepsâ¦
â¦Eluding me

The mystery
Will
Un
Veil
