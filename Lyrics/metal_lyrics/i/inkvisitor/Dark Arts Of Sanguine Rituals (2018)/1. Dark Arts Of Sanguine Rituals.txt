[Lyrics by Jesse KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen]

Arriving to the scene, corpse on a plain sight
Murder, it cannot be unseen
A body to be found in an obscure manner
No blood on the ground, bloodletting by a master
The purity, he took his time
He had a vision, to perfect the crime
Clearly a ritual, has to be a clue
Seems sacrificial, an M.O truly new

Red rum
The dark ritual
Red rum
Body void of blood
Red rum
A madness perpetual
A lust for sanguine lifeblood

Wasn't the first, sure as hell won't be the last
He'll kill again, I'll have to move fast
There's no lead, he's too good
A mastermind indeed, those in Hollywood
A puzzle to be solved, I'll crack the case
The mystery unveiled, he'll leave a trace
The act was brutal, like a piece of art
Resistance futile, but I can tell them apart

Truly the art of murder

No blood
Lifeblood
