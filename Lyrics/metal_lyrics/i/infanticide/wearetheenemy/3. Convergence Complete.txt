A pathetic flock that follows blindly
With no fucking end in sight
All nails get hammered down
And you'll only do as you're told

Submit, surrender, suffer without knowing

Abandon your mind, let someone else think
Exchange your life, for retarded belief

Submit, surrender, suffer without understanding
