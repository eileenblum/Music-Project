War for profit or war for fun?
Makes no difference, the lunacy has begun
Killing spree initiated, apocalypse in progress
And who cares what gets wiped out in the process?

Wargames on a playground called earth
You're just a piece in this little game

A war on terrorism that will purify
Your part in it is simply to die
Just stay happy when you're torn apart
Remember that the bombs are falling for your sake

There are still empty unmarked graves, what can be done about this...?
