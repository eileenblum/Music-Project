Religion - a replacement for common sense
Devote your life to the grand illusion
Don't come here looking for unity
All you'll find is submission

Realize - the skies are empty
Realize - there's nothing there
Realize - it all has to end
Realize - your truth is a lie

Where will you turn when utopia crumbles?
When there's no bright light in the end?
What will you do when it all comes crashing?
And the illusion caves in from above
