Worn Out, Consumed, Exploited and used
Your purpose has been filled
Degraded, abused, patronized and done
You're no longer of any use to us

Now you're out of date
Completely obsolete
All this time expendable
Worthless, now disposable

No longer of any use
Indignity
No longer of any worth
Humiliation

Now you're out of date
Completely obsolete
All this time expendable
Worthless, now disposable
