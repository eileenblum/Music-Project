Thanks, but no fucking way
I canât endure it anymore
thanks for all the choices
the ticket away from it all

But I canât accept that future
if âfutureâ means becoming like you
yeah, youâve set up a great big plan
but i wonât be different when weâre trough

Day, after day, after day, after day
I canât endure it anymore
thanks for all youâve tried to give me
but Iâve got a desire in my life for more.
