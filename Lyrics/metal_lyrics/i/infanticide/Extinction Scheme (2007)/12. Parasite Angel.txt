Deceive, lie, steal and kill.
Spread your wings of corruption
Cheat, betray, hurt and mislead
Sing the gospel of oppression

Always keep them in the dark
To acheive all that you want
Deaf and blind to any reason
The perfect, willing host

Parasite
Spread your wings of corruption
Messenger of hypocrisy
Sing the gospel of oppression
