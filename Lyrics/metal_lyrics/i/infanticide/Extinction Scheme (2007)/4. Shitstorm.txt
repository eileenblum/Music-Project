ItÂ´s getting worse every day
Everywhere we go, we bring decay
WeÂ´re contaminated by a social disease
NothingÂ´s enough for us to be pleased

Shitstorm - It is coming our way
Shitstorm - We wonÂ´t see another day

War obsession and greed
Uncontrollable urge to overfeed
You said we had nothing to fear
But now the shitstorm is here
