Never thought it could be like this.
that my waken nights would seaze to exist
Now I'm one step ahead of myself.
Going stronger, and no regrets what so ever.

This aint me but it feels so right
I feel so good now that im one your side
This aint me but i've lost the fight.
I feel so strong, I feel alright.

Nevertheless iÂ´m real fucking impressed
That iÂ´m the one you say that you need
besides you and me thereÂ´s no one you see
Let me tell you how i feel

Thanks for everything
Thanks for what we became
Thanks for all the shit
YouÂ´ll endure being my best friend
