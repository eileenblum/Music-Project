Why do you waste your time,
searching for answers to the question why?
you slam your head to the wall
and no stone bricks will fall

why do you try to brake
the chains to your cage?
Thatâll do nothing at all
Youâll get crushed when it falls

Do not think! Do not act!
Thereâs nothing out there - hold your tack!
Do not think! Do not act!
Youâll survive if you stay on track!

why (do you) try to brake
the chains to your cage?
Thatâll do nothing at all
Youâll get crushed when it falls

Why fight back at all?
We wonât kick you if you crawl
Itâs esier to stay
tide down, locked up in your cage
