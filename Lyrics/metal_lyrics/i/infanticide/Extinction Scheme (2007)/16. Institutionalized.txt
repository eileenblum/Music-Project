A sheltered life, encaged but still secure
Molded into form, cut and shaped for this existance
Just a life within yourself, letting no one in
No other way of life known, this is what you'll be

But when all of this suddenly changes
Everything breaks apart, nothing to hold on to
The fear of freedom becomes too much
A meaningless existance, just a walking corpse
