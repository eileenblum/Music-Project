With Burning eyes
We enter this inferno
We create the chaos
We bring the plague

Total Hatred for your existance
You are facing your extinction

No life left, only death
Slit the throat of humanity
Free ourselves from you
Doing what we have to do

Total Hatred for your existance
You are facing your extinction
