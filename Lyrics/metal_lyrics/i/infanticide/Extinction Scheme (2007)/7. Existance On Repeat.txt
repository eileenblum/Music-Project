Live your lives on repeat. Certain that things will change.
An endless loop that never ends.Existance on repeat.

All that changes are the dates. The days are all the same.
An endless loop that never ends.Existance on repeat.

Doesn't all this seem very familiar? Isn't it time to wake up?
Just go on and on until everything falls apart.
