Falling leaves, lost in time 
Regret, confounds 
Spring ahead, fall behind 
We struggle to turn it around 

Cold horizon, concrete and steel 
This is where we lost our souls 
They tried to warn us, but greed appealed 
We lost sight of the common goal 

Poor of spirit, full of fortune 
They move to the front of the line 
Blind to all, but number one 
We pay, we slaves to the grind 

One by one, we come undone, We pray to the dollar sign 
Day by day, in cash we trust, We live in the killing time 

Too much power, too much wealth 
Hey brother, can you spare a dime 
Corporate think rules the day 
It's best for the bottom line 

Born to service, to serve them well 
The carrot dangles on the merry go round 
Manipulation, a way of life 
The wizard will see you now 

One by one, we come undone, We pray to the dollar sign 
Day by day, in cash we trust, We live in the killing time 

It's all too much, how can it last 
This crazy world, turns far too fast 
Anxiety gets in the way 
We hold on tight, for better days 

Cold horizon, concrete and steel 
This is where we lost our soul 
They tried to warn us, but greed appealed 
We lost sight of the common goal 

One by one, we come undone We pray to the dollar sign 
Day by day, in cash we trust, We live in the killing time 

Falling leaves, lost in time 
Regret, confounds 
Spring ahead, fall behind 
We struggle to turn it around
