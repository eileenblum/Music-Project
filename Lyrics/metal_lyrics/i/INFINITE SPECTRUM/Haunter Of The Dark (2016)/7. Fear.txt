The morning paper brings me dread
I can't believe the things I read
Power outage on Federal Hill
Strange things afoot, my heart is still

Fear, spreading, growing strong
Panic, thriving, corresponds

Seduced by the great unknown
Some things should be left alone
I'm paralyzed by this fear of the dark

Black magic brings my doom
Curiosity consumed
I'm powerless against this fear of the dark

Thunder struck, took out the lights
Left the city in cloak of night
Creature came down from the tower
Street lights shut down for an hour

Fear, spreading, growing strong
Panic, thriving, corresponds

Seduced by the great unknown
Some things should be left alone
I'm paralyzed by this fear of the dark

Black magic brings my doom
Curiosity consumed
I'm powerless against this fear of the dark

Set my fate when I set it free
It will never stop, now it comes for me
Face my fear, complete the task
One ray of light will send it back

In the dark hour, downpour of rain
Crowd with candles form a blockade
Around the church, together they pray
This guard of light keeps creature at bay

Shattering glass, back up to the tower
The Haunter retreats, lights return with the power
In darkness, the steeple again its domain
The Haunter it waits, to be free again

Still the worst was yet to come
details reported in The Bulletin
Intrigued by the rumors, they explored the church
But nothing suspicious in their long search

The reports the same as what I'd seen,
but proclaimed as hoax of charlatanry
Two things unwritten that cut to the bone
The body is missing, as is the stone

Something scratching at my brain,
the lurking horror in the spire
It shows me things insidious
from unknown realms of fire

Dire consequence, power lost
In a frantic state, I'm in too deep
Mounting tide of terrible dreams
Nervous apprehension, afraid to sleep

Fear, spreading, growing strong
Panic, thriving, corresponds

Seduced by the great unknown
Some things should be left alone
I'm paralyzed by this fear of the dark

Black magic brings my doom
Curiosity consumed
I'm powerless against this fear of the dark

Set my fate when I set it free
It will never stop, now it comes for me
Face my fear, complete the task
One ray of light will send it back
