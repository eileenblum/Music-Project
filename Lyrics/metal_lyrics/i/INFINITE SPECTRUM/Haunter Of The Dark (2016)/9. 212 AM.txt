Midnight, August eighth, rain on the roof
Harbinger of the great storm to come
I feel it, I know it
when I see the lightning strikes
I fear my time is short
This unholy connection growing stronger
I see what it sees, It knows where I am
The lights must not goâ¦

Thunder fills the sky tonight
City loses sleep
One AM a frantic call,
lines are down complete
Pitch black, outside my window
Lightning flashes city streets

2:12 AM the lights go out
Citywide is power lost
I see the things the Haunter sees
Townfolk below do counterplot
With candle, flashlights, crucifix
they hold the thing at bay
Rising wind blows out the flames
Sounds from the steeple stray

They say their prayers,
defy the wind as they relight the flames
They call the priest
to invoke the Almighty's name

Lights out, hope lost, the darkness is rising
Frenzy, despair, the darkness is rising
Fear paralyzing, the darkness rising

2:35 sound swells in the black tower
Foul smell of evil emanates from the church
A loud splinter of wood
and a crash in the church yard
High windows agape, it's attempting to escape

Lights out, hope lost, the darkness is rising
Frenzy, despair, fear paralyzing
Possessed, God help me, the darkness is rising
Free will the cost, no use in fighting
Fear paralyzing, the darkness rising

Half numb, with awe I watch
my mind is not my own
Through eyes of a monster
watching those below

Lights out, hope lost, the darkness is rising
Frenzy, despair, fear paralyzing
Possessed, God help me, the darkness is rising
Free will the cost, no use in fighting
Fear paralyzing, the darkness rising

Wind howls like the flapping of wings
Fire extinguished, all lost in blackest night
Chaos ensues, the crowd trembles in fright
Left in a world without the light

I sense it coming for me from the east
there is no escape from the beast
Like a formless cloud of smoke
the Haunter does approach

Trapped within dark worlds of wonder,
clouded in a haze
Entranced by blackest magic,
Haunter has me in its gaze

Connection of the darkest order,
controlled in every way
Stirring my subconscious,
struggling hard to look away

I write my final thoughts,
like some frantic eulogy
I lose train of thought,
I lose myself, like in a dream

Losing hold on reality
I slip into the fray
Must document the story's end
The Haunter makes its way

False memory,
I see things I never knew before
Other worlds, other dark galaxies,
visions seen nevermore

The long, winging flight through the void
Cannot cross into the white light
Caught in the Shining Crystal,
thoughts forever lost in time

I'm Robert Harrison Blake
I am on this planet
Sense of distance gone
Far is near, near is far

Roderick Usher, am I going mad?
I am it and it is I
Must get out, unify the forces
It knows where I am

Sense transfigured, I see the tower in the dark
I see it coming for me
Hell-wind, titan blur, black wings,
Yog-Sothoth, save me
from the three-lobed burning eye

Lights out, hope lost, the darkness is rising
Frenzy, despair, fear paralyzing
Possessed, God help me, the darkness is rising
Free will the cost, no use in fighting

A flash of lightning, all is lost,
the Haunter in mid-flight
Electric surges through its form
and surges through my mind
Light sends it back to its own world,
trapped in darkness, blind
Terror filled, insanity,
rigid body left behind
