I hear it whisper, feel it tugging at my will
This connection that's between us, getting stronger still
In bed I lie awake afraid to close my eyes
I tell myself it's alright to believe the lies
I know that it is waiting, waiting in my dreams

Through strange worlds walking in my sleep
Visions vague and incomplete
Nightmare phantoms and cold sweat screams
Is all that we see or seem but a dream?

I awake in fright, sleep walking through the night
It draws me closer still, yet I struggle and I fight
I bind my arms and legs to the bed in which I lay
to keep myself from wandering or being led astray

Through strange worlds walking in my sleep
Visions vague and incomplete
Nightmare phantoms and cold sweat screams
Is all that we see or seem but a dream?

Haunted by this thing, it takes me to the brink
of mental nervous break, how much can I take?
I make myself a prison of this attic room
I see the knighted moon outside my private tomb

Strange as any imagining,
as if my weird tales came to life
Strange feelings, eyes upon me,
a malignant presence I can't describe

Strange as any imagining,
as if my weird tales came to life
Strange feelings, eyes upon me,
a malignant presence I can't describe

My body not my own,
dangling like a puppet on a string
Control lost to a monster,
this wicked nightmare king
It brings me to the church
in hazy mist of slumber deep
Prodding at my mind
to find the secrets that I keep

I find the strength to run,
I scurry down the spiral stairs
Away from church and steeple
and away from its dark lair
I awake on my own floor
with the rising morning sun
Bruised and beaten,
my mind is numb

Pulling up memory, pushing back time
Remember my hopes before the decline
Live in the past, closing the door
Wish for bright days like they were before

Pulling up memory, pushing back time
Remember my hopes before the decline
Can't hide in the past, the wolfâs at the door
No more bright days like they were before
