Discovery of the darkest kind
Outside our world of space and time
Down the rabbit hole I go
Things human minds should never know

Eyes now wide open
to see things unseen
Hide in the shadows
Try not to scream

Reference to a monster
The Haunter of the Dark
Gaze in shining crystal
summons creature forth

The creature holds all knowledge
demands blood sacrifice
From black gulf of chaos
the crystal stone invites

Eyes now wide open
Dark things of dream
No place to hide
from this evil fiend

Summoned, I called it
by a twist of fate
There in the church
for me it lies in wait

It lives among the shadows
In the dark of night
The Haunter seeks its refuge
from the rays of light

I fear the evening twilight,
the sky awash in black
The Haunter stalks me like its prey,
ready to attack

From my attic window
in fear I count the hours,
I watch the orange sun set
on the church's spire

The street lights ablaze
around my building guard
May they give protection
from unholy fire

The Shining Trapezohedron,
a crystal window on all time and space
Created on dark Yuggoth
long before the Old Ones came

Brought to earth many aeons ago
Passed through the centuries
from tribe to tribe
Serpent men of Valusia
to the humans of Lemuria
Crossing strange lands and stranger seas

The Shining Trapezohedron,
a crystal window on all time and space
Created on dark Yuggoth
long before the Old Ones came

Lost with Atlantis,
then retrieved from the sea
Possessed by a Pharaoh, this evil seed
Asleep in the ruins,
its temple confined
then dug from the sand to again curse mankind

I read it in the papers,
fear grows on Federal Hill
The local superstitions
intensify in build

Rumor, ghostly sounds
from the church unseen
Banish the spirits
that haunt townfolk's dreams

They say something watches
at entry of church
It waits for night's cover
to venture forth

It lives among the shadows
In the dark of night
The Haunter seeks its refuge
from the rays of light

I fear the evening twilight,
the sky awash in black
The Haunter stalks me like its prey,
ready to attack

From my attic window,
in fear I count the hours
I watch the orange sun set
on the church's spire

The street lights ablaze
around my building guard
May they give protection
from unholy fire

I feel remorse
My actions set this thing free
Must capture the crystal
and hide, where no man can see

Can I find the courage
to banish the beast?
A morbid longing,
to the crystal stone's deceit
