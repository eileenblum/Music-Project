Strictly enforced, the law of the saw.
I am the judge and now it's your fate that lies in my hands.
Sold you down the river.
They ratted you out, hung you out to dry.
Kneel down, bow to, the law of the saw.
Even though I did the deed, they stuck it all on you.
And now they sentenced you to die for crimes you didn't do.
