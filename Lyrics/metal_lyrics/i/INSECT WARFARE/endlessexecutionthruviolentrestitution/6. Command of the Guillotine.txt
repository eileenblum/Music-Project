When I was a baby I still saw it clearly.
Designed a machine just to chop off your skull.
Urged to destroy things I enjoy.
Myself, those around me, the entire world.
Who can be right with no one left to fight.
Transformed to a monster that can't express anger.
Unless I lay waste to the world around me.
And viciously assaulting anyone, anything.
Can't help but demolish everything I see.
