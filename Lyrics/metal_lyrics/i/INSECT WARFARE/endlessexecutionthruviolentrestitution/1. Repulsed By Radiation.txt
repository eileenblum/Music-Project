Mushroom clouds blanket the sky.
Skin and flesh burn up and fry.
Radiation overload.
Eyes burst, brains explode, a nuclear war, who will survive.
Entire earth now destroyed.
New world order takes control.
This is the way they thought it would go.
Humans deformed into mutant hordes.
All of the victims have all died this way.
We are the ones we have to stay.
Family of mutants feed on your brain.
Humans hunted for food then soon slain.
If only the bomb hadn't dropped long ago.
In all this shit we're doomed to wallow.
