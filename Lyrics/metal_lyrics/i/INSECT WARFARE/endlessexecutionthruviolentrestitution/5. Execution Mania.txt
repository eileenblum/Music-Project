This is what it feels like.
To act on hate and take ones life.
All I know I learned this way.
Picking, choosing ones to waste.
Judging all their souls.
Services extolled.
This will be your end.
Slashed you with a saw.
When I feel it in me.
Then I get to kill.
Murderous bloody rampage.
They can't stop me still.
When the horrors over.
Slaughters just begun.
Some of them I murder.
Some I only maul.
Inhibit, I must restrain.
Hate infesting inside of me.
I brought a saw and an axe.
Your weakness is your fear itself.
Lost to them before.
Defeat's took it's toll.
Lost self control.
