Pay your dues.
You're overdraswn.
Don't you try to cross me son.
You owe me big.
I'm taking back.
Time that you got deal with jack.
Follow you to your home.
Wait inside til you're alone.
I won't make noise til we attack.
Tie you up so you can't bail.
Administering a brutal beating.
Laughing while I beat you down.
When you're conscious is regaining i'll be sawing spine from skull.
I know what's mine and you're in debt.
I know my chainsaw won't forget.
It tells me who I have to slay.
The ones who'll use their blood to pay.
Justice has been served.
