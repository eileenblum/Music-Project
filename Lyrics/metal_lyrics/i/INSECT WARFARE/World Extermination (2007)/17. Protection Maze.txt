ten-acre drug field secret base inside. 
by the time the cops come i'll be safe inside.
protection maze, set ablaze.
they try to burn it down, i don't give a fuck.
after they inhale the fumes they'll be sitting ducks.
they must have called for backup, i hear the chopper roar.
i'll shoot it down and then skip town escaping towards the shore.
searching in my fortress, but i'm safely on a boat.
the only thing i left behind's a bomb set to explode.
