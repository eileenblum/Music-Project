working for nothing, your new life awaits.
if you can pay, you'll get in.
sold into slavery, you were promised a better life.
your family waits at home, you struggle by yourself.
trapped in a foreign world, where do you get help? 
cant trust the government, they just want to kick you out.
living in fear that one day they'll find you.
freedom enslaved.
