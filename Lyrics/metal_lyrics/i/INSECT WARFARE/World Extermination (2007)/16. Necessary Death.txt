i never thought i'd kill myself, i'm doing it so the rest can survive.
mass murder through suicide. 
master of my own fate.
martyrdom derived from hate.
i died so you can live.
with a bomb tied to my chest, i approach the president.
chaos, as bombs explode burning flesh and skin.
now your country's leader's dead, and the war is ours to win.
