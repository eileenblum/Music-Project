i knew that something was wrong, but i'm unable to place it.
subdued me, bound me up with rope and then stabbed my brain with an ice pick.
i would never be the same with pieces cut off of my brain.
try to get help from the cops, but they used drugs to cloud my thoughts.
they knew i could identify them, locked me in insane asylums. 
futile psychosurgery, a failed attempts to silence me.
you should have killed me dead.
