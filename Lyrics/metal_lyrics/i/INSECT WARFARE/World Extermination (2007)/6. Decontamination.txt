my secret lab remains unseen.
where i cook up some tryptamines.
one day i left in unattended.
return to find it had exploded.
one ton of rare drugs, ten thousand times a normal does.
the chemicals i kept inside have released in the environment.
tainting the water supply.
a single drop will get you high.
mass hysteria affects the area the whole town trips out. decontamination is death.
