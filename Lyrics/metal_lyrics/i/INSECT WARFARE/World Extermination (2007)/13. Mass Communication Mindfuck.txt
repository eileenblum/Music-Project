you see something on cnn or the internet.
you think you're in tune with the world but you don't know jack shit.
your grasp on reality is abstract, believe all you hear as fact.
falling for their hype machine, worshipping your tv screen.
everybody's doing it but i don't fucking buy it. you and all your myspace friends should get flushed down the toilet.
