people steal money and people steal weed but there's spineless breed of little shit that only steals ideas.
just a fucking leech, you always were.
make you bite the fucking curb if you bite off me again.
feel the street pressed against your skin.
end your life before you can think who grabbed me and tied me up and killed me because i ripped them off.
