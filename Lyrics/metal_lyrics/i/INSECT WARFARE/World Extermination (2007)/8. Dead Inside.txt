go to church, accepting god.
absorbing their religious fraud.
shunning those who disagree, what will it take for you to see.
collection plates always full, with hard earned cash of pawns and tools. 
exposing them for who they are, the truth is even more bizarre.
men of god molesting kids embracing what their god forbids.
turned to christ, because you're weak. 
thinking you'd find inner-peace.
emptiness when you confide, leaves you feeling dead inside.
disgusted by your former priest, you rat him out to the police.
he cries in court and says a prayer before his sentence to the chair.
religion you once held so high, is not but a giant lie.
