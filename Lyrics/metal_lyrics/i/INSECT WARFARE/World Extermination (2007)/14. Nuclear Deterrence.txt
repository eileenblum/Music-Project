Earths population doesn't stand a chance. 
There's nothing in this world that can survives the blast.
a means once used to end a war adapted to destroy the world.
government maintains denial of their growing arms stockpile.
when they take preemptive action, killing us all in chain reaction. 
the massive retaliation, causing worldwide devastation.
the only way to win is mutually assured destruction.
