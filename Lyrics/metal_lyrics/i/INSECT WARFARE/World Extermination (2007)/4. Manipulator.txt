the ignorant believed your lies, you used them up to win your prize.
they got shafted, you got rich, falling for the bait and switch.
don't care who you fuck over, climbing up the ladder.
secret agents, fbi is protecting your web of lies.
you can only push a man so far, then he'll see you for what you are.
once our countries leader, politicians are all scum.
fucked them over to earn their votes, now they want to cut your throat.
the public won't be fooled again, you can't talk your way out this mess.
to pay the piece for what you've done, the blood of you and your first son.
two presidents sentenced to death, a dark conspiracy put to rest.
