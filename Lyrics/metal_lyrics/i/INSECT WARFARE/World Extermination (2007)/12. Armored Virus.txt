armored virus,defeating detection.
no ones safe, there is no protection.
how can you defend against what you can't see. 
infecting all things in contact with me.
unknown origin, no known cure.
infecting what was once secure.
technology so advanced it traveled through time. to infect all computers and kill all mankind.
