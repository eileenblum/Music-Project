[performed by Insect Warfare]Impulse to destroy, inside the eye
No one will escape, millions will die
Run for cover, try to flee
How long can you live this way?
Ruined buildings, flooded streets
People left to die
Surviving is impossible for me
Waters rose above your head
Deadly poisons, toxic waste
Trouble breathing, now you're dead
Storm sent, from the sea
Once a city, now debris
Impregnable thunderous force
Destruction of the world
