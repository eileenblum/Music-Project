[performed by Insect Warfare]I see, with my eyes
Human trash wasted lives
Gone the way of the weak
The massacres begun
I'll teach you humility
Don't fuck around with me
I'll only laugh while you implore
Either way you've lost the war
All your suffering, all your pain
Will your bullshit life remain?
I will make my enemies pay
I want you dead
