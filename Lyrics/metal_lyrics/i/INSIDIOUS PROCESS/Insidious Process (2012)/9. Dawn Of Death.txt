The ground births us in blood, pain and death
Lungs filled with earth
A gloom of silence

We are the indifferent children of the earth
Thereâs no cure for life
Whatâs dead shall never die

Night follows day
The black winds remain
We betray ourselves
In blood, pain and death

We are the indifferent children of the earth
Thereâs no cure for life
Whatâs dead shall never die

We try to scream
Yet no one listens
Our lungs
Full with earth
