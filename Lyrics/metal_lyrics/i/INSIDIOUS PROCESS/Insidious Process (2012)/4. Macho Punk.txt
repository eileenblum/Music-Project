Punk as a free zone outside society
Punks, not bound to static behavior
Or do we act the same to each other?
Or whatâs this thing with gender-hang-ups?

See people not genders
Punks to punks
People to people
Genders to genders

Who needs this identification
Kiss your shame and let it go
Break homophobia
With non macho attitude
Personal courage is political struggle

See people not genders
Punks to punks
People to people
Genders to genders
Act

Do you live like you want
Or to please others, to please a norm?

Se people not genders
Punks to punks
People to people
Genders to genders
