My mind is burned out
Memories are all I have
No light where I walk
I have the scars that no-one sees

Tearing apart â falling into another abyss
Empty words â delusions of better days
Choking life â the bottle is empty,
My anguish remains
Losing control â forever watching an acrid dusk

Wastelands envelop me
I see through the fucking lies
Existence is my war
Exit wounds will never heal

Tearing apart â falling into another abyss
Empty words â delusions of better days
Choking life â the bottle is empty,
My anguish remains
Loosing control â forever watching
An acrid dusk

I will leave no trace
Of myself behind
Memories lost
Forgotten in time

Tearing apart â falling into another abyss
Empty words â delusions of better days
Choking life â the bottle is empty,
My anguish remains
Loosing control â forever watching
An acrid dusk
