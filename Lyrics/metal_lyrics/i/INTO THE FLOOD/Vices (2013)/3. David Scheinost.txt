Spending countless hours burning the midnight oil. Chasing away the sun until our legs are weak Spinning a yarn to waitresses about the days of old, and to whoever else wanted to hear it. They wouldn't recognize us without a bottle in our hand. We'll sing along with songs until our voices grow hoarse and our tongues chafe. We would hold the moon and stars in the sky. When the sun slept we felt so alive.

I swear I'll never let these memories go.

Tell me now, did it hurt when the devil broke your body. Because I'm eagerly awaiting the answer and I have so many questions to ask you.

Tell me what it's like to see the face of God.
Speak to me of eternity.
Please don't worry,
You will live on through our stories.
We'll use the happiness you brought to mend the holes in our hearts.

Tell me now, did it hurt when the devil broke your body. Because I'm eagerly awaiting the answer and I have so many questions to ask you.

Please believe me when I say that family is forever.
Your body may be broken,
But your spirit lives forever.
Your body may be broken,
But family is forever.
