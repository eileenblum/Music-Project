Come forward wrath of winter and freeze the arteries
Hardening the hearts of man
Wretched piles of human filth, your sick will stand rooted in oppression
No
I will not stand idly by and watch you blacken the flesh of my children with your disdain
I am God
I am the destroyer
Bring forth your spirit of callousness
And I will teach them fearlessness
All my people are witnesses
By my hands I will finish this
My light will be your demise
The devil's hands have been busy so separate flesh from bone and peel the skin from his lungs so he can't breath hate in this world anymore
Hate breeds hate but love conquers all
Stand up strong for I am your god and you are my people
You can be everything I want you to be
But first you must die to yourself and say, it is no longer I that lives, but Christ that lives within me
