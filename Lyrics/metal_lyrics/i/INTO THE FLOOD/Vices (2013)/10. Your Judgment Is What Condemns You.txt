This bottle's a mask I use
To hide my face from the world
And if you ask why I'll shrug and laugh
Plummeting to the ground
Faster than my head is spinning
Faster than your judging fingers
Could extend towards me

It stains your lips from your fingertips
Like decaying cobwers
Don't judge lest ye be judged
This is the spear to pierce my skin

This crown of thorns you've placed upon me
Is so heavy
Compacting my spine as I stumble through sands
Reaching for hands to help me pull me back up
And guide me home
But you couldn't see me drifting by
Because you were blinded by your splintering eyes
Don't judge lest ye be judged

But you couldn't see me drifting by
Because you were blinded by your splittering eyes

Oh God I promise you
Oh God I promise you
Oh God I promise you
Oh God I won't give up on your world
Like it has given up on me
I promise you oh God
I won't give up on your world
Like it has given up on me
I promise you oh God
