Hails to the ancient gods of darkness
Spawned from the oldest creatures
Those who were before the creations of time
Awaiting the return of the Ancient Ones

The seven seals will be broken
The final destruction of man
The trembling forces of chaos will end all flesh
The filth wind shall blow to end it all

The cosmic boarders shall be destroyed
For once... and for all
The eternal dream of dead
Light shall never shine again

Rise oh fallen ones!
Open the gates and walk the earth once more
The end of humanity is here
Behold the march of the Luciferian Empire

Hails to the ancient gods of darkness
Spawned from the oldest creatures
The glory of the past will reflect
In the twilight of the coming empire
