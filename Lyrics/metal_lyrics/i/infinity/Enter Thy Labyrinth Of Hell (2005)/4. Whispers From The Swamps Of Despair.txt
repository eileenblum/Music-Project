The silent screams of madness
Echoes through the corners of my mind
A call... so dark and mysterious
Mesmerized by the freezing fire of the Black Flame

Whispers from the swamps of despair
Calling my name through the winds
Guiding me to walk through the misty gates
And descend to the depths of the underworld

The landscapes, so silent and timeless
The realm where day and night becomes as one
An eternal void of splendid darkness
Vanished... enlocked in perpetual silence

A cry from the coldest dungeons
Nothing remains... no future or past
The flame of life is faded
Like a candle in the wind

Entering the mirror of dreams, the black eye of Ahriman
Wandering through the spheres of sleep
And drink from the chalice of eternal wisdom
