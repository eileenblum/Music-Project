Azrael, angel of death, ruler beyond time and space
My soul is in total devotion for you
You're the echo of melancholy, bringer of eternal twilight
Forever standing in the shadows of sorrow

The shadow of everything that has been
Bringer of memories and forgetfulness
The necromantic kiss... the dark gift of immortality
Forever trapped in twilight
My soul frozen as a shadow out of time

From the western gate you emerge, the gate of transition
Take me higher into the night skies
Like a raven you emerge, leading the way
Dispelling fear through understanding
That goes beyond wisdom

Illumination through darkness
Letting all go... to be reborn in you

The beauty of sorrow
The reflection of frozen tears
In a spectrum of eternal shadows makes me immortal
With your dark gift... a kiss so deadly cold
The necromantic kiss
