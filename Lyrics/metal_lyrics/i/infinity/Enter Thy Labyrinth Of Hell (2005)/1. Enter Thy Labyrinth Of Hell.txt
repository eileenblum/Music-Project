Kneeling in front of the altar
Surrounded by candles and skulls
I cut thy temple of flesh
The blood streams upon the pentagram

As I summon the spirits of darkness
And whisper in ancient tongues
The portal opens to subterranean kingdoms

The quest for Luciferian gnosis
Lies in the endless depths forgotten
The seven stars burn in line 
As the Eye of the Serpent opens within

When all hope drifts away and dreams end in pain 
The northern lights are fading to grey
When the void opens wide and descent into oblivion 
Caressed by the cold hands of Death

Falling in eternal sleep with eyes open wide
A journey at the threshold of madness
To find enlightenment through the spheres of the unknown 
You must go through Thy Labyrinth of Hell
