From the darkest dungeons
He rises in furious hate
The great Ancient Dragon
Finally released from the chains

Revenge is sworn in blood
To those who serve the heavenly god
We spit upon your cross
And deny your holy book of lies

Under crimson wings of hate
We crush your feeble souls
The father, the son and the holy ghost
Destroyed by the pride of Satan

Under crimson wings of hate
United we stand side by side
The dark warriors of the Black Flame
We shall destroy the pearly gates of light

Blood shall cover the earth
And storms will be unleashed
The final retribution
Total destruction of mankind
