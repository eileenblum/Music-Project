Mesmerized I stare into the candle flame
Entering from within and sink into the sea of dreams
Astral images appear in shades of burning madness
The watcher guides me
To enter the realm of the dreaming dead

In the twilight of dreams I gazed and faced the mirror
As I walked through, reality and dream unite

A vision of three flames that become as one
The holy goddess weeps a tear that felt into the depths

In the endless sea of burning flames
I've risen from the ashes
The flame of Satan burns in splendid might

Transcendental fires, the illuminating darkness
The ancient secrets revealed for my eyes
A journey through the depths of the underworld
Behold the magic of the spectral shadow realms
