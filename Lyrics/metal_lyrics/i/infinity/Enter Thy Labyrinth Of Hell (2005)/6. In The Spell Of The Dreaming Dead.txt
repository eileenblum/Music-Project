Long ago, in forgotten times before the light
When the dark waters of chaos trembled
A kingdom so mighty and feared
The age of the Old Ones reflects in my dreams

The great stone city R'lyeh with its monoliths
And sepulchres, had sunk beneath the waves
And the deep waters full of primal mystery
Had cut off the spectral intercourse

But memory never died (and the high priests said that) 
The city would rise again
When the stars were at the right position
Unhallowed blasphemies...
From elder stars which dream beneath the sea

The cold ancient blood from our mighty ancestors
Runs through our veins
Forever dreaming in Death's eternal spell

Seven spirits of chaos
Lurking in the spaces between
They await the final dawn
When the portals shall be opened

They had come from the stars
And had brought their images with them
That is not dead which can eternal lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
