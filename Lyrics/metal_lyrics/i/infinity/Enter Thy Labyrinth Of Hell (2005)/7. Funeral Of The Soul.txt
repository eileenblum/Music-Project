Isolated within this coldness
The solitary paths of the night
I hear the howling of the wolves
The nocturnal chants of sorrow en mystery

The white naked light of the moon
Shines upon my face as I walk towards the graveyard
Black-winged shadows surrounded me
The frost penetrates through my skin

Everything passes away before my eyes
Frozen as a shadow out of time
The night of sacrifice has come
The funeral of the soul

Crossing the bridge of life and death
To embrace the velvet emptiness
The last teardrops froze in my heart
A last farewell to the light

Riding the winds onwards new horizons
In the halls of Amenti
So cold and empty inside, but free
Attached to nothing I dwell eternally
