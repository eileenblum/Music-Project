The galloping of the horses sounds closer
Silently on the mountains edge
We watch our enemies
Soon the battle will begin
To slay the mortal souls

With heart as stone and spirits of fire
We unleash the beast within
And attack in full glory

With swords in hands
We conquer the lands with might
With fury in our eyes we trap the human race
Crushing their lives and laws
'Til they exist no more
Soon the earth belongs to us in all eternity

With heart as stone and spirits of fire
We unleash the beast within
Born to slay humanity we attack in full glory
