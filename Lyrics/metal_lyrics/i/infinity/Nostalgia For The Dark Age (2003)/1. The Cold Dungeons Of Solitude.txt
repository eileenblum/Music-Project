Drifting further into Darkness
The northern Lights are all fading away
Entering the cold world of stone 
My heart ...it feels so cold

Forever wandering the fields alone
In the cold dungeons of solitude
No light shall ever reach this emptiness
The essence of immortality

The river of tears has turned
Into eternal lakes of ice
My soul has taken by the ravens
I'm carried in the arms of the winds of funeral

Like a leaf I fall from the tree (of life)
Down into the abysmal universe

Winds of sorrow blow in my face 
As I walk through the forest 
Of the dreaming dead
All dreams are gone...
Awakened in the sign of the moon
