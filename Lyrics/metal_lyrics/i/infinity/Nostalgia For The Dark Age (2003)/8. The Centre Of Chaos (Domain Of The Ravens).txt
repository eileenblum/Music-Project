The chiming bells of darkness
Are calling me
When I enter the realm of chaos
Like a black hole I became
Absorbing all the light
Breathing death's breath

Reborn in death's domain
Baptized in the unholy fire
Watching the world
Through the centre of chaos
Dwelling within the timeless winds
My destiny... to purify the soul

The sound of silence
Is the never-ending burning
Chaos...
