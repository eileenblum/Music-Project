Within the winds of death we rise
To dominate and conquer the earth
Warriors of the black flame we are
Destroyers of light

Beyond the darkened skies
Lies the path to a greater void
Far above humanity we reign in silent might

The sacrifice of my mortal live
Has opened the astral gate ...to infinity

Leaving all earthly emotions behind
To enter the twilight skies
At one with the ravens we dwell
Within the transcendental hell

Beyond the darkened skies
Lies the path to a greater void
Far above humanity we reign in silent might
