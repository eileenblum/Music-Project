When I enter the ancient woods
I can feel the echoes in the wind
The sound of clattering steel
And the war cry of the pagan warriors

The painful screams of Christians who yelled
When swords penetrate their flesh
The bloody swords where sparkling
Under the light of the moon

I still feel the echo of melancholy
Nostalgia for the ancient battlefields,
The sound of clattering steel
And the war cry of the pagan warriors
