The wind brought forth the sphere of Death,
Bitterness and sorrow
Every time of the year the storm shall reap the sky,
The leaves from the trees fall back to the earth
When the rain is falling down
...I can feel the call of the wind

As I stare at the horizon
I see the ravens dwell in circles
The storm shall reap the sky 
Follow the autumn storm

The mighty lighting strikes the earth
When the sky is turning black 
Like a black-winged raven I fly 
Towards the endless blackened sky

Finally I've reached the gate
The eternal frozen realm
The blood in my veins has turned
Into lakes of ice
Emotions are dead, only the flame
Of the purest hate is burning
Autumn storm, take my last breath away...
