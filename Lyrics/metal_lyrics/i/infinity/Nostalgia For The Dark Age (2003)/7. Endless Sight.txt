Breathing the coldest breeze
At the top of the mountain
My soul has frozen
And my heart became as ice

Like a raven I dwell
Through timeless spheres
The light that I see
Are burning shadows
That leads me to the
Kingdom of twilight

Colder and colder
The winds became
At this freezing landscape
There's an endless sight
