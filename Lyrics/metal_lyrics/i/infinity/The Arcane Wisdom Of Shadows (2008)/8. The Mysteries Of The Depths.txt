And the earth was without form, and void;
And darkness was upon the face of the deep...

Come into the depths
Released from thoughts and life
Join the darkness
Beyond the limited cosmos
Mysteries of realms and ages
Unveiled through the dragon's eye
As I abandon all hope
My soul drifts upon the Styx
Through the gates of the underworld

I can hear the whirling wings of demons
Who will bring terror and despair!
Guiding me into the darkest of nightmares
Into the wasteland of unending nothingness
With no regrets I transcend through the fires of terror, 
Making me forget my name 

In the frozen depths of despair
The empty spaces between the stars
The night creatures are lurking which never sleeps
They are ever watchful
Filling my mind with the arcane wisdom
The language of the shadows

In her endless seas of blackness...
Tiamat awaits dreaming
In the sleep of death She reveals...
The mysteries of the depths

Mighty Tiamat!
Let your roaring waves wash away the human race of this earth
