Centuries ago, in times of medieval darkness
In a great ancient forest
which is born at the end of the Ice Age
An enchanted swamp
sucking all energy deep into the ground
A domain where worlds are crossing each other

Once there stood a powerful monastery
with many towers, ruled by King Clovius
who converted his life to Christianity,
expecting that his people would follow in his steps
The monks lived like heathens
and sold their soul to the Devil

When darkness falls, the nocturnal creatures awaken
Gathering for the Black Mass.
to praise the One with Horns
In sinful lusts they feast upon the flesh,
Desecrating the laws of the holy trinity 

On a dark winter night, the sky turned red
and lightening struck (the earth)
A thundering storm crossed the forest
and the earth split open
The monastery was swallowed into the depths 
and closed
Silence reigned over the haunted fields

Hear the voice of the ancient winds
that blows over the cursed swamps
The chiming bells echoing through the night
The forlorn spirits come out of the dark,
walking slowly and staring in darkness
They walk three rounds, accompanied with prayers
from their somber litanies
And when the first lights of the sun reaches the woods 
they disappear into the dark abyss
