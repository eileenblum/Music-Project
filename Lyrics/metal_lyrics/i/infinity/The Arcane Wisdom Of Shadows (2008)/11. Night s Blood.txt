[originally by Dissection][Guitars by Draconis]

Night haunts and evil lurks in every corner
Like plague it's spreading â I behold
Loneliness, yet with you autumn night as guest
But can you hear my cries?
Permeate me, oh night, as with the forest you did
For heart is cold, cold as ice

I drown in the colour of your eye
For a black heart will only find beauty in darkness
I breathe it's eternity to absorb the sky
Where the shadows of death may lie

Feel the call â Nocturnal desire
Sorrow's breath â Enchanting cries
Night's blood â Taste damnation's wine
Feel the pain â Nocturnal desire
The devil's path of dark delight
Night's blood â Pure damnation's wine

Eyes are glowing, burn as hell's fire
Mark thy wisdom in my mind

Those who never was born
But whose darkness eternally
Devastated the goodness built up through millenniums
No time passed, our victory is eternal
Our scorn, our silence...
A heart dies drowning in the night's blood
Everlasting malice for the wicked soul
Can't resist the night's sweet blood

Loneliness in the embrace of you autumn night
The night that froze my cries
Deep into the woods glows a fading light
I sold my soul, cold as ice

I drown in the colour of your eye
For a black heart will only find beauty in darkness
I breathe it's eternity to absorb the sky
Where the shadows of death may lie

Feel the call â Nocturnal desire
Sorrow's breath â Enchanting cries
Night's blood â Taste damnation's wine
Feel the pain â Nocturnal desire
The devil's path of dark delight
Night's blood â Pure damnation's wine
