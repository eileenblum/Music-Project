Winds of sorrow and hate
Are blowing across the lands
Screams of torture and pain...
The cries of a thousand souls

Eternal
-My soul drifts through the darkened realms
Frozen
-Embraced by the winds of eternal frost
Timeless
-The realms of primordial chaos
Immortal
-The black splendid light of Lucifer

The shadows are closing in,
Black clouds cover the skies
Ravens welcome me,
As I transcend through the celestial gate
It's the realm where one falls asleep,
And awakens in death's eternal dream

A dimension revealed,
In the twilight between life and death
The gaping mouth of the abyss,
Awaiting to devour the cosmic creation
