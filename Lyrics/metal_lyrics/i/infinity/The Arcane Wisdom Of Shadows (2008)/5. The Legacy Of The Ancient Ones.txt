Across the eternal seas of infinity
And beyond the blackest oceans of times
The mighty Ancient Ones lie dead but dreaming
Awaiting silently beyond the gates

They were, They are, and They shall be
The Gods of the Abyss
Behold the crawling chaos
that calls beyond the stars

Upon the oldest desert are gateways 
in the form of whirling columns of iridescent dust
In the day they resemble dancing pillars,
and by night glowing spires
When the rays of the 7 venerated stars
shine in their position
The ancient curse will awake
from it's primordial slumber

At their return
mankind shall bow their heads
and serve them as lords
The prayers of the prophets
shall not prevail against them 
Neither crescent nor cross nor star
can forestall their approach
When once again the heavens align
and the gate is opened

They were, They are, and They shall be
The Gods of the Abyss
Behold the crawling chaos
that calls beyond the stars

The legacy of the Ancient Ones
Upon the oldest desert are gateways in the form
of whirling columns of iridescent dust
In the day they resemble dancing pillars,
and by night glowing spires
When the rays of the 7 venerated stars
shine in their position
The ancient curse will awake
from it's primordial slumber

From the dark stars they came before mankind existed
Unseen and loathsome
they descended to primal earth
Beneath the oceans they brooded while ages past,
'Til seas gave up the land whereupon the swarmed

They were, They are, and They shall be
The Gods of the Abyss
Behold the crawling chaos
that calls beyond the stars
