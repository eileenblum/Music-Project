A cold misty fog caresses me
through these dark paths of misery
The dark purple aura which surrounds
My darkened soul
leads me to the cold pits of isolation
Where I dwell in solitude

Deep down through subterranean gateways
The roots of the tree of life
Reaches the kliffotic realm of shades

A universe reversed
Serpents eyes full of fire
Staring from behind...
The black mirror of dreams

From the eternal sea He rises
in divine madness

I summon thee, Serpent Angel
- who comes as shadow but is revealed as light
From the darkest depths of the roaring Abyss
- visions rising from the hellish flames
Absorbing through the spectral eye of Set
Unlimited powers of chaotic divinity
- demons awaiting at the gates of Da'ath

From the eternal sea He rises
In divine madness

Salvation... Through self-destruction
Ignite my soul!
Bless me with Thy immortal fire
In darkness lies the eternal mysteries
The darkened paths to immortality
The Light of all Lights...
Revealed through the Darkest of Shadows
