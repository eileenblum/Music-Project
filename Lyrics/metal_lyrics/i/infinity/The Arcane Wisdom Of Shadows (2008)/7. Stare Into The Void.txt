I behold and see the waves roaring higher
Absu, let your waters cleanse my soul
The dark abysmal waters roar endlessly
A timeless universe without beginning or end
Through the hidden gates
Within the unconscious mind
The yawning mouth of the void
Will devour your dying soul

Dwelling through the oblivious sea of nothingness
Without the eye of god, shining upon my soul
I stare into the void of emptiness
Which is the nexion to the dragon's womb

I've opened my eyes
To see straight into the abyss
I've opened my heart
To receive His eternal fire
I've opened my mind
To absorb eternity
I've sacrificed the I
To grant the powers of the all seeing eye 

This is the void where all illusions
Will vanish into nothingness
Illuminated by the black flame of chaos

I've seen the blackest shadows of hell
I've felt the immense torture upon the cross of life
I've faced the deepest fears within
And embraced the infinite chaos

Forget everything you once knew
By staring deep into the void...
The void will stare back into you

Hidden caves that lead to the borders
Beyond imagination
Spirits of chaos, let me dwell
To dominions of non-existence
The dark which has taken my soul
And unchained me from the wheel of life
It has granted me the keys to immortality
