Azazel! - I summon thee
Fire-Djinn of the Southern Quarter
Be the torch
Which would ignited my soul in glorious might
Immolate me in Thy presence
Guide my steps on the path of shadows
Let me drink
From the chalice of Luciferian gnosis

Awaken now! Rise from the Mountain of Darkness
And resurrect the ancient cities of War and Sin
Initiate me by the power of the darkest dreams
Forbidden teachings of the Nephilimic Witchcraft
Horned Master of the Witches Sabbath
Light the fire between the horns
And open the inner gates to the eternal powers and forbidden wisdom

Azza Uzza Azziel
Nephilum-Qayin Azazel!

Ignite the flames of the black light upon the face of the earth
Your gift of knowledge
To forge the weapons of liberation
In blasphemy and fury we rebel against the cosmic order
Proud sons of Fire
Rise at war and erase the clayborn
