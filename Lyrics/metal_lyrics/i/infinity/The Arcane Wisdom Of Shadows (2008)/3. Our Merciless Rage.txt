â¦And the stars reveal the signs of horror
For times yet to come
The long awaited circle is complete and destroyed
Gaze into the horizons of endless night
We are not from this placeâ¦ not of this time
Through the black shivering astral lights we dwell
In a place unknown by mortals
Far beyond the stars

Longing to destroy this cosmic tyranny
Created by the demiurge
The black flame rises high within our souls
Which is the legacy of Lucifer's might

He who is the most enlightened of all
Will cast the darkest shadow

Crossing the gates to worlds beyond
Our ancestral bloodline awakens within us
Remembering the celestial war before existence
The glory of the ancient past
Will never be forgotten by us

His brilliant light will forever remain darkness
In the eyes of the blind

We've sworn the oath against our enemies
That we will open the gates once again
And break the borders between the worlds
So the Beast will be free again in eternity

Our worship last forever!
