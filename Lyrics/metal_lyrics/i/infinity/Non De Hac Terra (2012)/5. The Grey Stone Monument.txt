Like shades we walk through the cold mist of the night
Silently, holding our torches in hand
In black robes we walk to the sacred ancient place
We are gathered here before the grey stone monument

As the burning stars align high in the night sky
The swirling clouds uncover the rising comet
Candle flames enlighten the altar of blood
We call to the ancient gods of the abyss

Priests of the darkest horror
Necromancers of forbidden art
This is the ancient arcana
May the dead rise and smell the incense

Lighten the fires, the ritual begins
Invoke the forgotten names on the top of the mountains
We raise our daggers high to the sky
Glistening cold and sharp in the full moon light

We kneel before the throne of the serpent
We eat from the forbidden fruits (flesh of the gods)
We drink from the chalice with venomous wine
Mesmerised we grant the visions from the fires

Shadows dancing over the burning sigils on the stone
The incense awaken the spirits beyond this world
From beneath the floating rock the earth starts to tremble
The Serpent God arises from the depths
