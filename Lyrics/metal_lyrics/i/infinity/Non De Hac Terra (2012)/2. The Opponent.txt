Ancestors from the ancient past
Lie frozen in the halls of death
Within the winds from worlds beyond
Memories of blood and steel lives on

Lies! Corruption and depravity
For your poison will not harm our souls
We accuse you, oh god of spineless parasites
Who created the veils and chains of slavery

From the dawn of time, you try to break our spirits
We refuse to bow before your cross
The prison of time, a cosmic wheel of seven circles
Will be transcend with wings of fire

We walk the path of the adversary
We oppose the laws of the Jewish god
Inverting his values in rebellion and blasphemy
We are your opponent!

Give praise to the angel of intolerance
Who let the heavens tremble and the stars shatter
We'll free ourselves from this cosmic tyranny
We are your opponent!

Serpent of Old â Grant me the keys to Thy kingdom
Serpent of Wisdom â Reveal the arcane paths
Serpent of Light â Grant me the gnosis of the abyss
Serpent of Fire â Ignite my inner flame
