Isolation - Detached from the living world
Like a worm, crawling into the dirt of the masses
Misanthropic flames burns in my soul
So unhuman... so undivine

For my soul is ancient and not of this place
Cursed... to dwell among the living

I call upon the storms of destruction
To cleanse this world from human filth
Eleven demons will rise from the deep
And welcome the inevitable darkness

Oppression - Rebel against all order
Dwelling in endless circles, over and over again

I despise this world with every piece
of my goddamn soul!

Drink the wine of perdition

I call upon the storms of destruction
To cleanse this world from human filth 
Eleven demons will rise from the deep
And welcome the inevitable darkness
