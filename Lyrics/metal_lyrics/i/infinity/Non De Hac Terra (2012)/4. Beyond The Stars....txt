In time before time
In the age of eternal darkness
Before the heavens and earth
where put in their places
In the age when the mighty Ancient Ones
Were rules of all that existed and did not exist

There was no Moon, there was no Sun
No planets were there and no stars
No grain, no tree, no plant grew
Behold the masters of the spaces unknown...

Nowhere are they known
for they wait beyond the gate
Until the dawn when the stars align again

They slumber beneath the earth
They dwell beneath the seas
In the spaces between the stars
In dimensions unseen

Awaken the Ancient Serpent
The water will be as one
Break the cosmic borders
Rise up to the stars

From the void beyond the planes
Where formless chaos reigns
They shall rise up from the depths
To reclaim their sunken kingdom

Behold the Ancient Serpent
Reclaim what once was lost
Awaken your chosen children
Turn the earth to dust
