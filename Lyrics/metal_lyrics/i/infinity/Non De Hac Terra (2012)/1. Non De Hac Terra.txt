Tiamat! You who existed long before the gods light 
and who exist in the infinity beyond the divine light
We call to thee oh queen of the eternal sea
The cycle is complete, the aeon has reached it's end... 
The stars align once again!

For the seal is broken and the gate is open. 
Awake from your sleep of death and rise from the depths of Tehom
Reclaim your fallen kingdom, which sunk beneath the oceans
Bless us with your infernal poison, arise in us and set our souls aflame
Our war cry will echo through eternity... 

Born from the first seed of the serpent
Like an outsider, lost in a strange world
Fall into existence, being trapped inside out
Abandon the light of day, seeking wisdom in the shadows

Return to the Dragon's womb

In another time â In another place
With dragon wings of fire â Transcend the seven gates

The shells of the qlipoth are open
The seed of rebellion deflowering
Escape from the wheel of life
Oh cold winds of death! Permeate my heart and soul

Non De Hac Terra â We're not of this earth
Non De Hac Terra â Beyond the veil of illusion
Non De Hac Terra â Join the other side
Non De Hac Terra â Return to Sitra Ahra

I hear the voiceless calling
From the other side
Through the gate of silence
Into the endless night

The shells of the Qlipoth are open
The seed of rebellion deflowering
Escape from the wheel of life
Oh cold winds of death! Permeate my heart and soul
