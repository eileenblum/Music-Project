I scream from the mountains
The words of blasphemy
Burning in agony
I declare cosmic anarchy

Souls from the netherworld, rise through the gate
The blood-carved sigils awaken the flames to rise
The bloodline of Kingu reborn

Unholy sacrament

In dark delight I cut my flesh
In glorious pride I raise the chalice
With pride and devotion I seal my fate in blood
Forever bound to the black flame of Satan

On the parchment I write my name in blood
Onwards to the burning path of night
Listen to the voice of silence
Unholy sacrament!

In the dark delight I heat the steel in the fire
Mesmerized I chant the words of commitment
With pride and devotion I burn the pentagram (...in my chest)
Forever bound to the black flame of Satan

Gaze into the endless pits of eternities
I sink into its glorious depths
The womb of eternal darkness is calling
I will drown, be devoured and reborn in its eternal fire
