Fearsome in appearance
Staring eyes of fire
A protruding tongue
A bloody sword and a belt with decapitated heads

Goddess of destruction
Queen of dissolution
Guide my darkened steps
As I walk into the cold void beyond this world

Goddess of Death and Rebirth
Awaken my inner flame
Destroy the veil of illusion
Into the womb of eternal night

Embraced by fires eternal
Reborn... a life nocturnal
The ultimate reality
An endless sea of flames

Goddess of eternal wisdom
Mistress of the night
Into the womb of the dragon
She reveals the mysteries of the black light

Cremate the cosmic prison
Ignite my inner flame
With your unholy sword of fire
I will spill the streaming blood from my veins

Gaze into the flames - In the endless nowhere
Beyond the veil of time - Through the shadowed haze

Gaze into the flames - In the endless now and here
Into the dark unknown - Onwards the Funeral Pyre

Release my restless spirit
Beyond the cosmic laws
Baptise me in fire
Guide my darkened steps through this hellish maze

Beyond the walls of time
Within the heart of death
Upon cremation grounds
Beyond the horror your eternal grace shines
