Oh mighty goddess of the dark moon
Dark eternal queen of the night
Initiate me into your cave of shadows 
Into the nightside of existence
Let the flying screech owls lead my way
Through the forest of long forgotten dreams

Let me eat from your fruits of forbidden knowledge
And build the bridge to the astral realms
Reunite my inner flames with the outer fires
Rise and shine upon the Seven Headed Dragon

This is the night of Initiation
The borders between the worlds disappear
Through the haze of night I wander
and enter the Dragon's Womb
The gateway to the tunnels of Qliphoth

Oh mighty goddess of the dark moon
Shine your grace upon my soul
Baptized in the black waters of the abyss
Send forth your destructive storms and evil winds

Ama Lilith, Queen of the underworld
Who gives birth to death and through death rebirth
Lead me from the labyrinth to my destiny
Initiate me, let me become one of your Lilim

Come forth and spread your dragon wings
Fly from the garden of Eden
Into the dessert domain of Zemargad
Let me drink from your bloodstained chalice of gnosis
