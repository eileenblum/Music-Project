I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end 
For I am the first and the last. I am the honored one and the scorned one 

I am the bright morning star, descended from Heavenâs grace 
I came not to send peace on Earth, but a sword 

I will ascend into heaven 
and exalt my throne above the stars 
I will sit upon the mount of congregation 
in the uttermost parts of the north 
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds 
I will make myself like the Most High 

I bring the fruits of wisdom and the inner gnostic teachings 
But my brilliant light will remain darkness in the eyes of the blind 

For my sleeping seed lies deep within the soul of man 
Awaiting to be reawakened to rise up to the stars 

In Nomine - Dei Nostri Satanas - Luciferi Excelsi 
In Nomine - Dei Nostri Satanas - Luciferi Excelsi 

I am the light of the world 
He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness 

I was there on Mount Golgotha where the sacrifice took place 
The holy blood was spilled and flowed into the grave of Adam
