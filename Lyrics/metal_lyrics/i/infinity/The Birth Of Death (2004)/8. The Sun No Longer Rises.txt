[originally by Immortal]In the mist of the twilight 
You could see me come 
To walk the endless woods alone 
The earth is freezing 
As I walk it become colder. 

Forever descending in a place of the moon 
Where shadows move with grotesque eyes 
Where demons rise 

Surrounded by black and mourning moon fog 
And the eyes of the dark ones 
Sempiternal woods wait only for me 
A path opens clearly 
The sun no longer rises 
Over cold and forgotten valleys 
The sun no longer rises 
Where I walk and where I come 
I believe in tragedies 
I believe in desecration 
To the north and into eternal winters 
To the north in the grip of eternal frost
