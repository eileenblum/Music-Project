Drowning in vicious circles
Deep down in the pits of my soul
Crawling into the swamps of depression
The wings of hope are burnt by the sun
The destruction of the self
The destruction of the dream

All feelings of joy are replaced
By destructive suicidal fires
Seeing the past... tearing away
Through the mist of twilight
A gate opens before my eyes
A new future is born...
The birth of death

Down in the depths of the soul
Awaits the ocean of fire
To purify all that what once was
Back to the primal nature of the beast
