Far beyond the realms of life
Lies the cold darkness of the void
The spectral shadow realms of all that is formless
The messenger between life and death
Holds the eternal secrets
Once the ancient river is crossed
The journey has begun

Corvus Corax spread his wings

Dwelling within the winds of death
Through timeless dimensions
In the forest of twilight
The raven guides my way
The endless abyss where dream and reality are one
Mesmerized you'll sink into the depths

It will take your soul and tear it apart
Till you'll become one with darkness
One with darkness... one with eternity

Within the winds of death
Under the wings of Corvus Corax
