When the last sunlight
Fades over the horizon
I awake from my slumber
And behold the eternal night
The blood in my veins
Flows like a wild stormy sea
The wind leads my way
When I taste the smell of blood

Like a wolf I hunt
Through the dark nocturnal woods
A hunger awakes the flames
Of the ancient beast of Hell
Crystal starlight
And the bright shining moon
Shows the endless beauty
Of the black eternity 

Flames in hunger

The cold silence that embrace the forest 
Lead me through the dominions of death
Eyes that sparkle with pure desire
The reflection of my soul
That burns with hells fire
