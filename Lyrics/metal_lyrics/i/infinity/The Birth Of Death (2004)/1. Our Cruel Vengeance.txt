Like wolves among the sheep
We'll slay all false and weak
Marked with the sign of death
Our blood cold as ice
Finally the dawn has come
To show our merciless wrath 
Our black furious souls awakened
We'll dominate once again

Our hearts are full of pride
In our mind we don't know sin
Bounded by the power of Evil
We reign within the flames
With swords and axes we crush
The skulls of all that's weak
Our burning desire...
Kill, feed the fire

The barriers are broken
Our lord rises from the depths
All dimensions will return to chaos
In a war men must show his purest essence
The will to survive...

Behold our furious wrath!

Shadows will cover the earth
Angels will fall from the skies
Heaven buried in ashes
The return of the Horned One
