Awakened in a dream
Where time stands still and cold winds blow
The sun has shined its last rays 
The winter has possessed my soul

Reborn in black emptiness
Winds of solitude blow in my veins
Eyes are empty and staring cold
I enter the world of stone

Love turns to sorrow
Sorrow turns to hate
Hate turns to stone
Stone turns to dust

...And the dust will dwell with the winds

The life has ended
As the earthly gate is passed
Entering the cold astral demon worlds
Where all mortality dies
