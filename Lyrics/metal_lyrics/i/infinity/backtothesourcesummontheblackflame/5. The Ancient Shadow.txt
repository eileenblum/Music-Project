In the deepest of my black heart
There's a fire that will never fade
Burning full of pride
The neverending sun

Still carrying the shadow
That grows every night
All the pain I've taken
Makes my blood as steel

My body stars to shiver
When I enter the sphere of death
Awakened from the illusions
Of time and space

What once were dark thoughts
Have now come to life
Is it me or my shadow
Who's looking through these eyes

Anubis - God of the underworld
Guardian of the gates (of death)
Show me the ancient secrets
By bringing death's embrace
