The wind brought fourth the sphere of
death, bitterness and sorrow
Every time of the year, the storm shall
reap the sky
The leaves from the trees fall back to the
earth when the rain is fallin' down
I can feel the call of the wind
As I stare at the horizon
The ravens dwell in circles
The storm reap the sky
Follow the autumn storm

The mighty lightning strikes the earth
When the sky is turning black

Like a blackwinged raven I fly
Towards the endless blackened sky

Finally I've reached the gate, the eternal
frozen realm
The blood in my veins have turned to
lakes of ice
Emotions are dead, only the flame of the 
purest hate is burning
Autumn storm, take my last breath away
