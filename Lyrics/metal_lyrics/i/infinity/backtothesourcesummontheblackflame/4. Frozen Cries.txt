Blood runs cold through my veins
Frozen in a shadow
The memories that once where buried
They awoke from their crypt

From the darkest pits
The shadows crawling in the darkness
The suffering is endless
The pain I can't deny

The light slowly fades
Black fog surrounds me
The only cure for the pain
Is to throw myself into the flames

A star that once shone so bright
Has vanished into the night
Beneath the buried shadows
Lies the cries frozen in time

The light has slipped away
Life is replaced by death
Dreams darken reality
As the soul isburied in the shadows
