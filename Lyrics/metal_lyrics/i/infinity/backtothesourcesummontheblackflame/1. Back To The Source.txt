Lucifer, hear my dark call
I summon the black flame
That burns in the depths of my soul
Grant me the ancient powers and knowledge
To open the gates to eternal hell

Let the flame burn all borders of reality
So all dimensions will bleed into eachother
The rise of the ancient serpent
Who has slept for aeons
The time has come for our furious revenge

I will not tolerate celestial harmony
And (slavery) chains that lock the will
The eternal strive for total freedom
Enter the secret path across the abyss

Back to the source
Back to the primary chaos
Unleash the chains of unfaith
Come forth and destroy the mental prison
(Who's created by christian dogma)

Feel the freezing fire burning through your spine
Back to the source, the abyss of black divine
