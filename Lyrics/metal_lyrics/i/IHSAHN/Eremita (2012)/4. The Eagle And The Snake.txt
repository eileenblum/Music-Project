I crawl through mud and secrecy
To reach the edge of sanity
And fall... through cleansing air
Clashing down into the sea

We - between the eagle and the snake
Beyond what is real and what is fake
Between the eagle and the snake
The walls come down

Embrace the pain of this profound affliction
And yearn the sting, the serpent's tranquil kiss
Just sow and reap the gifts of liberation
To reach the shore and do it all again

It is night, now, do all leaping fountains speak louder
And my soul, too, is a leaping fountain
It is night: Only now do all songs of lovers awaken
And my soul too is the song of a lover

We - between the eagle and the snake
Beyond what is real and what is fake
Between the eagle and the snake
The walls come down
