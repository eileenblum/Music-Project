Time dissolves before my eyes
I know, the graves, they always try to hide

Then, what are graves to me?
Their sins are not infectious
I claim immunity to their disease
Oh, the serpent coils...
Again I will consume the fire
To purge the entrails of my soul.

Now let go, disperse the fear
Loose the grip on what is out there
What I see is deep inside
Paranoid will be my guide

Hollow eyes will lead the way
A quest for peace will burn in the end
Inhale, exhale, reach far into the deep
Descend to where the devil's crying, angels weep

Better forget what force wide open
Embrace the night where blood is
On the darkness, to return to black

Oh, I fall and know to bleed
The source from whence my demon sees
Time dissolves before my eyes
I know, the graves, they always try to hide

Breathe (...)

Breathe, reach far into the deep

On a quest for peace
On a quest for peace
In burning ruin
