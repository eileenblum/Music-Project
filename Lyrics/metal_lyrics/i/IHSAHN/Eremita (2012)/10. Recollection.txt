[Limited Edition Digibook Bonus Track]The playful years of spring
Killer's romantic dreams
Of misanthropy

The playful years of spring
Killer's romantic dreams
Of misanthropy
Of misanthropy

The playful memories
Killer's romantic dreams
Of the misanthrope

Yet deep down, the shame
Knowing they were only lies
Fabricated alibi

Though now it seems that all the shame and secrecy was all a waste, was all a waste
That those (that those, that those) longings of truth were just a premonition
That those lies are now the truth

Deep down, the shame
Knowing they were only lies
Deep down, the shame
Knowing they were only lies

Deep down, the shame
Knowing they were only lies
Deep down, the shame
Knowing they were only lies

Knowing they were only lies
Knowing they were only lies
