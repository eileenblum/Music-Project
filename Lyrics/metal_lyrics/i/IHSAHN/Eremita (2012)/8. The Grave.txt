He hammers the earth with a shovel
Anger thunders with every strike
Inside his skull
a funeral
a cold-blooded murder.

he hammers the earth with a shovel
yet, his grave was empty from the start
someone or something
to forget
A hole in the ground

He hammers...

he hammers the earth with a shovel
beating it all to dust and stone
beyond recognition
faceless
bloodstained soil

he wipes the sweat of his forehead
a strained laughter in the face of dawn
Marks the completion, the end
The last missing pages

Secretly he hammers the earth.
