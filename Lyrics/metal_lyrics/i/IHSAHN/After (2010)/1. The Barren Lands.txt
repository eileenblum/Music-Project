These are barren lands
Austere and cold
Desolate night
Of frozen time

Endless Fields of Cragged land
Has long since drank
The blood of war

Cold lair
Howling winds of sand,
Hunger, violence, solitary, godless

This scenery
So far so burned
So beautiful
It thirsts for more

These are barren lands
Austere and cold
Desolate night
Of frozen time

Unforgiving heart
Into the ways of Wolves

This is a Lion's lair
