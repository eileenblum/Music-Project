Frozen Lakes On Mars
Red fiery star, god of war
Blood stained archon in the sky
Far beyond the reach of those again

From the west, from the east
Burning red, terror completely
To watch the throne, cranial vent volcano
Upon this temple gave out of all who came
This impending cranium

Blue eyes like frozen lakes on mars, made fury
That there once was life inside
Blue eyes like frozen lakes on mars,
The cold remains the fires died
The mountain crown, has surpassed sanction
The ?hermie? final rapture, the ultimate descent
Into the deepest Vally of death

Drained in the all consuming sands of
Far beyond the reach of those again

Blue eyes like frozen lakes on mars, made fury
That there once was life inside
Blue eyes like frozen lakes on mars,
The cold remains the fire dies
