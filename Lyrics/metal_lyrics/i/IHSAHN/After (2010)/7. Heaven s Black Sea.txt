Emensity over
With sterling eyes
Above the still remains

In solid reflection
[Warrant?] the sculpture
Sinking into oblivion

And down below
The night finds a mirror
Reluctant eye
A fragment of will
Yearning to sink
Into this heavens black sea

[Oh no/all aboard?]
Nothing will
Aeons
Slow reprieve

[Repeat]

Emensity over
With sterling eyes
Above the still remains

In solid reflection
[Warrant?] the sculpture
Sinking into oblivion

And down below
The night finds a mirror
Reluctant eye
A fragment of will
Yearning to sink
Into this heavens black sea
