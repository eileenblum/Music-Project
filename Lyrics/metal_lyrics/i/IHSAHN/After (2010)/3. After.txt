Like clandestine
dreamsborn sheep

winter occupy the plains

and this is the after, the ending events

ghosts through deathclouds
swarm the heavens
like swarming vultures

and this is the after
the ending events

this is the after
where nothing transcends

white knows black and no one smears...
snowblind skies dissolve...
[right wing for inches?]
overexposed...reflects the intercourse

or so the real raindrops held...

temples collapse in a rumbling choir
do not deny
heaven meets earth we'll fight to the death
forever know why...

and this is the after
the ending events
this is the after
where nothing pretends
