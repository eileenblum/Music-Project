Black silhouette
Upon a dark and ash-hued scenery
Cold hands receive
This battered stone

This battered stone

Twilight
Caress the windswept features
Unyielding
Shadow blacker still

Its shadow blacker still

All the while
Dead gaze on the horizon
Into clouds
As if contemplating
A fire reborn 

A fire reborn 

Black silhouette
Its shadow blacker still
