As the sun returns
From the shades of night
So am I reborn from my own corruption

I invoke the consuming fire
And from the ashes mould
The renaissance of my decadent self

At the dawn of my rebirth
The heart is overflowing
I indulge and dissipate

And when the cup is empty
I drink from nothingness
The venom by which I disintegrate

This is not merely pride
Or lust for eminence
This is the reoccurring cycle of my existence

As the sun returns
From the shades of night
So am I reborn from my own corruption

Behold - the god returns
Solar balls upon his back
A sacrifice

I invoke the consuming fire
And from the ashes mould
The renaissance of my decadent self

My Sacrifice - My Corruption - My Death
