Sacrilege
Profanity
Rabid convulsion
Of blasphemy
Thus appear my venomous cries
To your ears
Were they truths or were they lies

Rejection
Eternal
Tyranny
Of denial
I would surely burn myself at the stake
Were my demons the spawn
Of your lusts and perversions

Parasite
Mundane creed
Dispassionate
Betrayal
In times of moral crisis
The darkest places in hell
Are reserved for the neutral

And so you earn
My contempt
My enmity
Malediction
Though my path be that of thorns
The way of my affliction
Is the way to myself

The devil will not let me go
Though I do not mind
Through fiery lakes to where cold rivers flow
I honour the contract I signed

Sacrilege
Profanity
Rabid convulsion
Of blasphemy
Thus appear my venomous cries
To your ears
Were they truths or were they lies

Rejection
Eternal
Tyranny
Of denial
I would surely burn myself at the stake
Were my demons the spawn
Of your lusts and perversions

No - the devil will not let me go
And I never did mind
Through fiery lakes to where cold rivers flow
With pleasure I honour the contract I signed
