Night comes with the smell of murder
And shadows fall long on my trail
Such are the hazards of my craft

All lights disperse
And the devil takes me down

There is panic in my fascination
Like soothing wine is my despair
Gracefully I fall to pieces

Then lights disperse
And the devil takes me down

The gears keep turning
And the ropes stretch far
In this world of hopelessness

I have come a long way now
The fatal riddles
Beckon me
I have come a long way now
A leap from faith
And gravity
I have come a long way now
To find the nest
Where treasures sleep
I have come a long way now
The fairest lies
Are hidden in the deep

In the deep

There is vanity in my destruction
There is mockery in my ordeal
Indefinite is the course of my decent

When lights disperse
And the devil takes me
