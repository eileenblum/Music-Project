Of all rejected creatures unloved
Of all who defy the predestination
That divides mankind
Into the saved and damned
He was the first.

The lurking punishment
With blood he did reveal
Death
And trough the ages run
A river deep and red
The ever present heirs
For whom there is no rest.

And he shall walk in empty places
With a claim on destiny and self at hand
An endless journey towards the rising sun.

Towards the rising sun.

"Remember this, you others;
The fire and the fury,
The strength and defiance,
This you admire, this you desire,
I had to win them for myself".

In remembrance of the adversary
I conjure up the lion will:
Hungered Violent Solitary Godless.
