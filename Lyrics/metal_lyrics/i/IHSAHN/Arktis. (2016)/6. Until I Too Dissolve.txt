The early hours
Of this late autumn dawn
All ready taste of winter

Cold mist rise
From blinding waters
Gracefully into the light

And I can choose to watch
Absorb this careless beauty
Without restrictions make it part of me

Until I too dissolve
A fragment of it all

These fleeting moments
Between ashes and dust
May well taste of winter
And yet I choose to dream
To form this life like clay
Universal insignificance will guide my way

Until I too dissolve
Like mist in autumn dawn
A fleeting moment to behold
A fragment of it all

Cold mist rising
Until I too dissolve
