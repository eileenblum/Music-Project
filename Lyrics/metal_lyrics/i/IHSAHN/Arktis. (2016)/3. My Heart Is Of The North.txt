I have felt the hunger
The restless howling call,
To lift my gaze across the seas
And seek out foreign shores

Yet, for all riches
They may bring forth,
The undeniable remains;
My heart is of the North

Beyond horizons
There is kinship to be found
The challenger of summits
Is by no direction bound

Still, untouchable
Are those who hold my soul
For them the fire burns
And our enemy shall truly know the cold

And should my spirit soften
Like snow in early spring
Or waver in the sultry haze
That soothing summers bring
Engage the compass of my heart
All arrows drawn to N
When night falls on my journey
And my path comes to an end

Take me north again
