A shattered soul presented
Like a disassembled gun
Assassins rushing up the stairs
All allies on the run

Grasping for the pieces
With hands of swarming flies
A sleeper agent set to face
A death where no one dies

Cold sweat dripping
Like hammers to the floor
Panic eyes fixated
On the light beneath the door

Shadows move like fire
Hysteric seconds tick
Until the zeros of the clockwork
Applaud the final click

Finger on the trigger
Back against the wall
Counting rounds and voices
Not enough to kill them all

So, you thought you could escape without a fight
That we would lose the scent of your despair
Like rabid hounds we'll hunt you through the night
Along a crooked trail of blood and fear

A shattered soul presented
Like a disassembled gun
Assassins rushing up the stairs
All allies on the run

Engage the code to self destruct
It cannot be undone
The last of the resistance
Outnumbered one to one
