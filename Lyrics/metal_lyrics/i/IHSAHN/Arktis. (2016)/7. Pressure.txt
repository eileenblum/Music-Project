I know I put this pressure on you
To deal with and accept my being
And the darkness that sometimes leak
Through the cracks of my skull
That slow grimy shadow
Like oil spill from a sinking ship

Still breathing and conscious
Stare through a stranger's eyes
Devoured and sedated
Slow motion muted cries

Now I need to put some pressure on myself
Put some flesh on these bones in my mouth
Rearrange these fragments in my head
Ignite those dreams with a few bolts of lightning

The spirit seeks to be a hammer
That forge the future as it glows
The mind curls like an anvil
To take the fiery blows

The heart will sing of danger
The brave and reckless call
Set sail towards a distant shore
Misgiving memories lurk
In the darkest pitfalls of the soul
Like an anchor hauler across the ocean floor

I put this pressure on you
To deal with and accept my being
Now I need to put some pressure on myself
Burn the oil, ignite the dream
