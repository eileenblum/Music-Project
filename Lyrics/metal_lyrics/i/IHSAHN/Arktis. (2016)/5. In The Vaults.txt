Screaming
Into a void of disbelief
Bleeding slowly
The victim of a narcissistic blow

Life can be so unforgiving
Yet, what is there really to forgive?
All you really have to do isâ¦

Longing for the hopeless
Losing all to own the end
Maybe you will find the courage
To trust yourself again

Why wrestle all this guilt
When you can pick a fight with death?
Why nurture weaknesses and flaws?
You chose a life at war

Now choose a worthy enemy
If not to conquer, then to taste the blood

Screaming
Into the void of disbelief
A conjurer of sorrow
A parasite of grief

Life can be so unforgiving
Yet, what is there really to forgive?
All you really have to do is live

Why wrestle all this guilt
When you can pick a fight with death?
Why nurture weaknesses and flaws?
You chose a life at war
Now choose a worthy enemy
You know, it doesnât always have to be yourself
