Lend me the eyes of millennia
Align the rapid glimpse of lives in frames
Like fading photographs in ashes
In desperate seconds, closed in by the flames

Let me walk into their cities
When dust and sand has covered every trace
If love, of pain and liberty
A veil of ash and night across its face

I would cast a shadows over beacons
To see disoriented swarms disperse
Like rays of hope into the night
The rise of civilizations in reverse

And as ghosts among the living
Like echoes of a fading song
We could run across the battlefields
On blood-stained road to freedom

Lend me the eyes of millennia
Align the rapid glimpse of lives in frames
Like fading photographs in ashes
In desperate seconds, closed in by the flames

Let me walk into their cities
When dust and sand has covered every trace
If love, of pain and liberty
