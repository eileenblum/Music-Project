A tranquil silence echoes through the blackness
Stumbling away each step a fall
Into another void the ever endless
Fluctuating centre of it all

I've seen you here before I couldn't reach you
We spoke the truth with bleeding, cut out tongues
And turned our backs to all the roads we ever knew
In this maze where you are lost
And I belong

A gallery of aeons lie in pieces
Spread like ashes over Babylon
Where the quest of orphan martyrs ceases
When they find the gods they loved are gone

I've seen you here before I couldn't reach you
We spoke the truth with bleeding, cut out tongues
And turned our backs to all we ever knew
In this maze where you are lost
And I belong
