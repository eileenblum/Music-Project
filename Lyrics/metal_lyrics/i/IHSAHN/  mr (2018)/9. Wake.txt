Inside a dreamer's palace
So desolate and vast
Amidst the solemn pinacles
And shadows of a past

You lie awake to find
The somber evening hours fade
Away like childhood memories
Your mind withdrawn to shade

The night on the horizon
Has whispered in your ear
You came for consolation
You won't find it here

The night on the horizon
Has whispered in your ear
You came for consolation
You won't find it here

Hope and disillusion
Have sunk in mires of doubt
Along with scraps of triumph
You could have left without

A fool for loss and tragedy
The muses senseless kiss
For which you blindly sought out
All the pearls of the abyss

Senseless quest for dignity
Has blurry your weary eyes
The sum of your ideals
Comprises a formless lump of price and vice

The night on the horizon
Has whispered in your ear
You came for consolation
You won't find it here

And yet a subtle smile
Like thieves upon your face
With scars and worn delusions
You still enter night with grace
