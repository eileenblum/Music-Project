This is a night of a thousand stars
And I'm wondering where you are
I should be with you,
And you used to see this too

We got lost along the way
We were never meant to break
Is this fate or have we failed to make it?

Once again we're not united as one
We broke ourselves before the damage is done
The void you left when you took our love and ran
Left me here hanging undone

You said a heart is such a strange thing
Mine did break when you were gone
What if our hearts were already broken
Long before the damage done

This is a night of a thousand stars
And I wonder how you are
I'm alone tonight, wishing I could be with you

I got lost along the way
I was never meant to break
Is this fate or have we failed to make it?

Once again we're not united as one
We broke ourselves before the damage is done
The void you left when you took our love and ran
Left me here hanging undone

You said a heart is such a strange thing
Mine did break when you were gone
What if our hearts were already broken
Long before the damage done

No one knows if they will beat again
Love is such a strange thing

You said a heart is such a strange thing
Mine did break when you were gone
What if our hearts were already broken
Long before the damage done

Damage done [repeat]

I hope it will beat again
