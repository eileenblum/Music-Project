I count the the days, the time, the hours 
Since you are gone 
This game is cruel, I did know the rules 
Was I really aware 
I seize your charms, didn't need more time 
To fall for you 
In your distant gaze I don't find my place 
You will forget 

I may be another soul that you'll leave here in decay 
I'll be alright despite being a mistake that you made 

In this world being left undone 
Is not so wrong 
Will I make it through doesn't bother you 
As long as you feel alright 
If thereâs a place for the broken hearts, mine will belong 
In despair Iâll find an old friend of mine 
Iâm not new to this world 

I may be another soul that you'll leave here in decay 
I'll be alright despite being a mistake that you made 

Nothing last forever 
In your silence thereâs no together
