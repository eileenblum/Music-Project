Shadows surrounding 
Threatening voices 
Was this all just a dream 
My reality fades away 

As I lose my sanity 
I follow the trace you carved in me 
The path once clear has faded 
For we were cursed to begin with 

Oh, the storm in my soul 
The calm in your eyes 
Pure morning light 
We mourned, you lied 

And while I grieve, drawing from darkness 
Drum-like memories from left alone melodies 
It cries nocturnes of this summer night 
Puts me slowly to sleep, melancholy 

Once touched, turned, doomed 
Swallow my pride, my head held high 
Numbing my pain, my heart, a tomb 
Hollow 
Fighting to breath beneath thick waters 
I slowly drown as I scream for you 
The ocean waves, my new tethers 
Oh, did he ever know my name? 

Alone, I fight 
scorching remaining fantasies 
Have we ever existed 
How can I numb my heart
