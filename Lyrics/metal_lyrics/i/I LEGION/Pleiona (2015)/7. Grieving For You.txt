I must ask why a reason for my melancholy 
I mute the cries the longing for your resurgence 
And Iâd do anything to hold your hand for one last time. 
There was a knowing in your eyes the day you walked away. 
Canât help but feel there is a truth youâd rather hide from me 

To know you canât disclose to me 
leaves me wading through inadequacy 
I would have been by your side for eternity. 

Iâll make the most of all that iâm given 
&amp; hope that iâll change the world again. 
I wish you a safe journey to heaven, 
and a chance you rest in my arms again. 

I canât proceed with the knowledge that you felt 
you couldnât come to me for every discrepancy 
Iâm replaying the whole scenario to find some peace. 
You need to know thereâs not a thing I wouldnât do for you. 
And now i know you were protecting me from the cold truth. 

But why think I canât hold this weight, 
but in lieu of, push me towards hate? 
I wanna be by your side and subdue this pain. 

Iâll make the most of all that iâm given 
&amp; hope that iâll change the world again. 
I wish you a safe journey to heaven, 
and a chance you rest in my arms again. 

And Iâm dwelling, grieving for you again.
