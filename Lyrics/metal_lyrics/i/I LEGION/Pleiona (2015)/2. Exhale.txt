I could never tell you all the things that have been heavy on my mind 
These memories confined 
Oh please donât tell me that Iâve lost my way when itâs all about my life 
A life I want survive 

Donât tell me now 
Does my world stop spinning 

What you gonna do when it all seems far away 
You're reaching out for something to save you 
What would you say if it all just slipped away 
You're holding on for something to save you now 

Can't breathe, can't feel 
Some things were never real 
I'll bleed for you, I'll heal you 
We'll see this through 
Until the end 

How can I reach you, with distance growing all the time 
When weâre living in a lie 
This is our last kiss and I wont be ever turning back 
Wont give it a try
