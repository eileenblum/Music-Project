[feat. BjÃ¶rn Strid (Soilwork), Jon Howard (Threat Signal)]Another night evading
A fever I need to kill
Drowning the sorrow
Waiting for the thrill
Feel like I'm the only one inside
(Inside)
Burying my past
For a moment by your side

If only that flame was here for me
Leeching the air until I can't breathe
Moments of bliss passed in silence
Locked in that place until
They ring the sirens

Tell me you will stay
That you won't go away
Say you'll haunt me down
And remember my name

[Chorus:]
My heart is lost, broken
And ripped apart
I will
Yes, I will
Cover my eyes
Making just compromises
I will, I surely will

All hope is gone

I'm here pretending
I'll feel anything
But if you read my lips
The words tell the opposite
I'm not the only one inside
(Inside)
I'll stand here and stare
Too broke to fly
Too weak to dare

I reach to you hand
Trying to break the distance
Feeding the void to cover my ignorance
All my ideals have always
Been the same
Here in that place
I just battle in vain

Tell me you will stay
That you won't go away
Say you'll haunt me down
And remember my name

[Chorus:]
My heart is lost, broken
And ripped apart
I will
Yes, I will
Cover my eyes
Making just compromises
I will, I surely will

All hope is gone

[Solo]

Tell me you will stay
That you won't go away
Say you'll haunt me down
And remember my name

[Chorus:]
My heart is lost, broken
And ripped apart
I will
Yes, I will
Cover my eyes
Making just compromises
I will, I surely will

All hope is gone

All hope is gone
