When the hope was over 
suddenly I saw two golden eyes 


flooded with magic light 

And then the world stopped turning 
there was no gravity 
the time didnÂ´t go by 

The obstacles we left behind 
made me strong 
And now IÂ´ve learnt to ease my mind 
to take control 

Even in my best dreams 
I could have built 
such an absolute being 

Cause you are the only thing thatÂ´s real 
a true exception 
my only and sole mainstay 

you are a true exception, my only and sole mainstay 

Together weÂ´ll design a perfect paradise that binds us 
forever till the end of times 
donÂ´t worry if thereÂ´s no light cause weÂ´ll be eternally incandescent
