The cold hard truth I'm learning 
Walk into a closed door once more 
I'm trapped inside nowhere to hide 
I know I'm just another guy A page to burn, I just waste away 

Burning. Choking. All these lives you're taking 
Swallowed by the storm 
Watching. Feeling. All these hopes you're draining 
I'm not yours anymore 

I will watch, I will learn that once touched you're burnt 

And now I see your heart Black Scarlet 
I will leave this lair where your monsters hide 
All you feel inside is hatred 
You're controlled by fear of being left behind 

Black Scarlet 

An internal damnation 
Where no emotions are allowed to be shown 
No shadow's cast when your radiance hides in the darkness of your eyes 
A mirage of the darkest times 

Bleeding. Healing. All these thoughts are fading 
Take me back time 
Fighting. Breaking. on these words I'm writing 
From these wounds I should rise 

Disappearing time 
I'll bury deep in my mind 
A silence inside my chest 
Moments Iâll never witness 

A lost soul searching for redemption 
Reveals my inner obsessions 
I embraced the darkness of her soul
