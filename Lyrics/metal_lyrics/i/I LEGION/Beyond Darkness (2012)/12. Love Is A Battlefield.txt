[Chorus:]
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowning
Love is a battlefield

You're begging me to go
You're making me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way
Or am I the best thing you've had?

Belive me, believe me
I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love
And I'm chained to your side

[Chorus:]
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowning
We are young
Heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands
(Both of us knowing)
Love is a battlefield

We're losing control
Will you turn me away
Or touche me deep inside?
And before this gets old
Will it still feel the same?
There's no way this will die

But if we get much closer
I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders
You'll need me to hold

[Chorus:]
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowning
We are young
Heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands
(Both of us knowing)
Love is a battlefield

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowning
We are young
Heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands
(Both of us knowing)
Love is a battlefield

(We are young)
(Heartache to heartache we stand)
(No promises, no demands)
(Both of us knowing)
(Love is a battlefield)
