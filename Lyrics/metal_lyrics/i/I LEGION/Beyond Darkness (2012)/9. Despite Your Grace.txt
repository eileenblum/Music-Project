[feat. Chris Clancy, Mutiny Within]Like a constant source of endless energy
I walk the trail of thoughts
Making my way through endless poverty
And awaiting your return

Cause I can never make a move
Without the pain
Each time
Each time I breathe I feel itâs all in vain

[Chorus:]
I am the one who keeps on learning
I am the one who turns the page
I feel a part of me is burning
Despite your grace
Despite your grace

The lack of character inside of me
Caused the bounds of endless love
Chasing my dreams to find a remedy
The haunt is still so blind

Cause I can never make a move
Without the pain
Each time
Each time I breathe I feel itâs all in vain

[Chorus:]
I am the one who keeps on learning
I am the one who turns the page
I feel a part of me is burning
Despite your grace
Despite your grace

[Solo]

Like a constant source of endless energy
I walk the trail of thoughts
Making my way through endless poverty
And awaiting your return
Destroy

[Chorus:]
I am the one who keeps on learning
I am the one who turns the page
I feel a part of me is burning
Despite your grace
Despite your grace

(I am the one who keeps on learning)
(I am the one who turns the page)
Despite your grace

[Solo/Outro]
