If I could only fight this addiction
Find a way to get out of this affliction
Behind my mask Iâm deeply struggling
Wishing every time it will end
Every night wakes the demon inside
The Devil and a rope by my side

Beyond darkness there is a light
And youâre by my side

For these sins Iâm the one to blame
If only I could bury them away
I tried to remove clouds from the skies
Beyond the darkness there is light
Every day itâs harder to breathe
Every hour is a spreading disease

[Chorus:]
When all light dies
And that my eyes
Are bleeding tears
Beneath your light
Iâm tearing us and what we used to be
Only for a moment with no memories

Iâm aching
When you bring back those memories

[Solo]

Iâm aching
When you bring back those memories
Iâm bleeding
Please drain the blood from my veins
With no memories

Beyond darkness there is a light
And youâre by my side
Beyond darkness

[Chorus:]
When all light dies
And that my eyes
Are bleeding tears
Beneath your light
Iâm tearing us and what we used to be
Only for a moment with no memories

[Chorus:]
When all light dies
And that my eyes
Are bleeding tears
Beneath your light
Iâm tearing us and what we used to be
Only for a moment with no memories
(With no memories)
