[feat. Chris Clancy, Mutiny Within]You said we'd last forever
(We'd last forever)
A broken promise
All shattered into heartache
These years of anguish
(Years of anguish)
We fall apart as the cycle starts again

Suffocate
Forever I will fail
I can't find a way to you

[Chorus:]
So take my life for I can't lie
This endless hurt
I'm dead inside

Never an answer
(Never an answer)
Just endless hope in a void so lifeless
So break the hatred
(Break the hatred)
I'm torn apart by the voice inside my soul

Suffocate
Forever I will fail
I can't find a way to you

[Chorus:]
So take my life for I can't lie
This endless hurt
I'm dead inside

Wake me up
I close my eyes
If I can just remember you
Trapped inside
I canât breathe

[Solo]

[Chorus - Spoken:]
So take my life for I can't lie
This endless hurt
I'm dead inside

[Chorus:]
So take my life for I can't lie
This endless hurt
I'm dead inside

[Chorus:]
Take my life for I can't lie
This endless hurt
I'm dead inside
