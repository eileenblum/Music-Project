I hear your voice again
Whispers through the walls
Just some distant memories
Nothing I can say
Secrets I donât keep
Still Iâm holding on

Hope is fading faster than I can replace it
Ever-changing
Chasing this distant feeling once again

[Chorus:]
It died in me, died in me
The promise not to harm
Youâre haunting me constantly
In a world so black, so jaded
Youâre tied to me, tied to me
Iâm so mistaken
And I start to see everything
In this world so black, so jaded

Itâs so clear to me
Iâm my own enemy
I am so forsaken
Helpless lay me down
Taking all that I am
Cut my heart from my empty soul

Hope is fading faster than I can replace it
Ever-changing
Chasing this distant feeling once again

[Chorus:]
It died in me, died in me
The promise not to harm
Youâre haunting me constantly
In a world so black, so jaded
Youâre tied to me, tied to me
Iâm so mistaken
And I start to see everything
In this world so black, so jaded

[Solo]

Hope is fading faster than I can replace it
Ever-changing
Chasing this distant feeling once again

[Chorus:]
It died in me, died in me
The promise not to harm
Youâre haunting me constantly
In a world so black, so jaded
Youâre tied to me, tied to me
Iâm so mistaken
And I start to see everything
In this world so black, so jaded

In a world so black
Hope dies first
In a world so black
All hope dies first
