[feat. Jon Howard, General Ghost]I needed you by my side
But now that world just died
You're a ghost to all I know

I used to say I don't mind
To leave this life behind
I've ended where I started long ago

Itâs real, not fiction
My whole life sent into oblivion
Trapped between Hell and Heaven
When youâre here
How can I imagine
A lighter shade of green
Itâs my perception
And I ain't never going back

[Chorus:]
Here we stand
We persist without an end
I fell away from the world I know
Itâs not easy to let go

I vanished without a trace
Only bodies lying in my wake
I killed everything that I loved
Youâre a curse to our names
I wonât ever be the same
I will bury us and our memories far away

Itâs real, not fiction
My whole life sent into oblivion
Trapped between Hell and Heaven
When youâre here
How can I imagine
A lighter shade of green
Itâs my perception
And I ain't never going back

[Chorus:]
Here we stand
We persist without an end
I fell away from the world I know
Itâs not easy to let go

[Solo 1/2]

There are no excuses
No one to blame
Maybe time will ease the pain
I'm undone
In all these darkness moments
Escape as deliverance
I had to leave you once again

There are no excuses
No one to blame
Maybe time will ease the pain
Wo-oh, I'm undone
In all these darkness moments
Escape as deliverance
Wo-oh-oh

[Solo 2/2]

Itâs real, not fiction
My whole life sent into oblivion
Trapped between Hell and Heaven
When youâre here
How can I imagine
A lighter shade of green
Itâs my perception
And I ain't never going back

[Chorus:]
Here we stand
We persist without an end
I fell away from the world I know
Itâs not easy to let go
