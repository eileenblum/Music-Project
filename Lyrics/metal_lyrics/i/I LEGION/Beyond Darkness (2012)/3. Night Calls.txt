[feat. Chris Clancy, Mutiny Within]All the hope it grows tonight
Let it flow donât stop the fight
Let it in and just go answer the night call

So cast me out, we're crashing out
Sometimes I feel that itâs always me
Whoâs bleeding out as you're walking out
Iâd like to give this curse away

Iâd like to think that I am changing
We all know Iâm still the same

[Chorus:]
Tonight is filled with high hopes
But it fades away
And I canât change what youâre thinking
Just say youâll stay

As the dusk hides the sun
Thereâs nowhere left to hide
All the lights go on
Iâm hiding from no one

So cast me out, we're crashing out
Sometimes I feel that itâs always me
Whoâs bleeding out as you're walking out
Iâd like to give this curse away

Iâd like to think that I am changing
We all know Iâm still the same

[Chorus:]
Tonight is filled with high hopes
But it fades away
And I canât change what youâre thinking

Twilight comes
Itâs not enough to beat this addiction
Darkness calls a part of me
I canât just help this affliction

[Solo]

(Iâd like to think that I am changing)
We all know Iâm still the same

[Chorus:]
Tonight is filled with high hopes
But it fades away
And I canât change what youâre thinking
Just say youâll stay

[Chorus:]
Tonight is filled with high hopes
But it fades away
And I canât change what youâre thinking
