[feat. Chris Clancy, Mutiny Within]I wonât lie
The duality is a part of me
This double identity wonât let me be
You never tried
To understand whereâs the sunlight
When the night covers up your eyes

Believe me
Thereâs nothing going wrong
But your eyes can't see
Inside me
A life is growing
But your eyes can't see

Unconscious minds
Donât realize the truth
In the dark there are mysteries
We donât see
And weâd rather believe
We are alone to live in a dream

Believe me
Thereâs nothing going wrong
But your eyes can't see
Inside me
A life is growing
But your eyes can't see

[Chorus:]
These lies once ignored
But I canât deceive the light
And I canât hide
For the truth in the dark will come

[Solo]

All these lies
They sound like lullabies
I see them shining through my skin
One last time
Letâs give this a try
But it seems like a never-ending story

Believe me
Thereâs nothing going wrong
But your eyes can't see

[Chorus:]
These lies once ignored
But I canât deceive the light
And I canât hide
For the truth in the dark will come
I canât deceive the light
Buried inside my mind
But still I run
I never wanted this
