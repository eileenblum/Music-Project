We have been running
We have been running for too long
All our existence
Canât be futile and wrong
Futile and wrong

[Chorus:]
We will fight
Wonât surrender tonight
Crushing everything
That left us bruised and torn
We will fight
The Devil lives inside
And prepare ourselves for
The eye of the storm


We must be missing
Missing the signals in the waves
Beneath the surface
I know we remain
(I know we remain)
The same

[Chorus:]
We will fight
Wonât surrender tonight
Crushing everything
That left us bruised and torn
We will fight
The Devil lives inside
And prepare ourselves for
The eye of the storm

Weâll never be the same as before
How can we learn to trust again?

[Solo 1/2]

We will fight
(Fight, fight, fight...)
We will fight
(Fight, fight, fight...)

[Chorus:]
We will fight
Wonât surrender tonight
Crushing everything
That left us bruised and torn
We will fight
The Devil lives inside
And prepare ourselves for
The eye of the storm

Fight

[Solo 2/2]
