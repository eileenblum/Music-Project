[feat. BjÃ¶rn Strid, Soilwork]I drown again
I am sinking
My bodyâs aching
Iâm tired and lonely
So rise against
All these feelings
Nothingâs easy
When your heart is not my home

[Chorus:]
I am dreaming to die in your arms
Tonight Iâm gone
I'm gone
I am hoping
Waiting for a sign to shine above
(Shine above)

Cure the pain
Iâm infected
Intoxicated but my heartâs still beating
Carve your name
So let embrace it
Iâll expiate it
And let those letters burn

[Chorus:]
I am dreaming to die in your arms
Tonight Iâm gone
I'm gone
I am hoping
Waiting for a sign to shine above
(Shine above)
(Shine above)

I refuse to write you off this life
I refuse and still dream that youâre mine
That you're mine

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
I am dreaming to die in your arms
Tonight Iâm gone
I'm gone
I am hoping
Waiting for a sign to shine above

[Chorus:]
I am dreaming to die in your arms
Tonight Iâm gone
I'm gone
I am hoping
Waiting for a sign to shine above
(Shine above)
(Shine above, Shine above)

I refuse to write you off this life
(I refuse to write you off this life)
I refuse and still dream that youâre mine
That you're mine
