Faithless when nothing else remains
When everything is gone
And ashes in the sands of time

Motionless I fall
Left me to my end
From this grave I rise again

[Chorus:]
Oh, I am breathless
Every time I speak your name
Oh, Iâm so faithless
Can we stay until the end

All I want in this world is gone
(Iâm losing faith)
Am I bleeding out
Or falling to my fate again
(Again)

[Chorus:]
Oh, I am breathless
Every time I speak your name
Oh, Iâm so faithless
Can we stay until the end

Everything I gave
Not for love and fame
All that I have left
Is all that I have hated
Now that you are gone
This canât be undone
Forever I await the chance for absolution

Are you awake
I'm so faithless
Are you awake
So faithless

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Oh, I am breathless
Every time I speak your name
Oh, Iâm so faithless
Can we stay until the end

Until the end
