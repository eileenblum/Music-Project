I created my own divisions
Drawing lines in the sand
Donât know whoâs looking back at me
I've become somebody else
Your word's like a bullet
Not giving more chances
I have no reasons
And I just watch my world collapse

[Chorus:]
I swear I tried to search for the one inside
That I failed to find for so long
How could I fall from a place so high
Why can no one hear my cries

Do you feel hands on your throat
When Iâm not close?
How can you trust me again
When anytime I cross the line
My world now a legion conquer
With no resistance
I hurt without reasons
And I just watch this world collapse
I swear I tried

[Chorus:]
I swear I tried to search for the one inside
That I failed to find for so long
How could I fall from a place so high
Why can no one hear my cries

How could I fall from a place so high
Why can no one hear my cries

[Solo]

I swear I tried
I created my own divisions
Drawing lines in the sand
Donât know whoâs looking back at me
I've become somebody else
Your word's like a bullet
Not giving more chances
I have no reasons
I swaear I tried
