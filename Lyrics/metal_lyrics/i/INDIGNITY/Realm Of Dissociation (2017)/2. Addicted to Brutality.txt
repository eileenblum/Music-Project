Stupid sun wakes me up
Gloomy dreams fades away
Smell the stench of decay
Death is in the air
Sends shivers down my spine
I'm so excited
Can't hold it anymore
Let the fun begin
Born on this earth
Unexpected, uninvited
Focus on that
What burns within
Let it explode
Like a dead whale
Weapon of choice, weapon of voice
To cut your limbs off
And you will be still smiling
Enjoy the pain
I cause to you
I don't care if you understand
What
I do and what
I say
I will make you swallow razor blades
To make you feel
What's inside of you
A manifest
Of a twisted mind
If it offends you
Choke on dick and die
It's meant to be
Guilty pleasure
You want to complain?
Nobody really cares
You cannot help me
I cannot be healed
Another dimension
Created for myself
Realm of dissociation
Addictive attraction
To everything what's
Unwanted and rejected
People doesn't matter anymore
They're just raw material for gore
Component for one of my best meals
Your suffering is so fucking tasty
No feelings, no attachment
To this sick society
Do not know is my conscience is still good
But
I see you as walking meat
Grotesque scenes of violence
Flashing through my mind
I'm out of touch with reality now
Tearing out the best pieces
Stitching it together
Feeding it with leftovers
Horrible monstrosity
Created to make you think
Only splattered blood
Satisfies me
