The new world order
Coming with bright future
The new world order
Don't let it blind you
The new world order
Set by devils black hand
The new world order
Beginning of end
Illusion of choice have been given to
Strict conditions you must fulfill
No need to have any doubts
Answers are ready before you ask
People are born and dies with debt
Tangible goods as a bait
Ideal crowd control system
You're just next unit in its place

The new world order...
No life does matter
You must believe what they say
I'd rather stay useless
Idle resistance
Revolt became an icon only
In this luscious image of reality
