Human mind is such powerful tool
It can create most perfect things
Or it can only seek havoc and doom
Why do you refuse to control it
Look at this crowd in rush
It lost the ability to reason
Own thoughts chopped their heads off
They live choking with own blood

We are your worst indignity
Because we are showing, what we really are
Stop running away in fear
You have a lot to answer for
Don't be ashamed of yourself
Why you grieve only when alone
Not everything you see is real
Dismiss the illusion that surrounds you
Forsake attachment to this world
Let me open your head
