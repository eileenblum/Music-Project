Left alone in mists
Of own dreadful thoughts
Slowly sinking into endless void
To the point of no return
Tempted by black speech
Coming from depths of earth
Stuck in a place where life
Is only sickness of minerals
In this sleepless state
Deprivation of dreams
Made life so empty and senseless
Suicide seems to be only salvation
From this possession
Blinded by fear
Marked by death
I reopened my scars
Left alone in mists
Of own dreadful thoughts
Slowly sinking into endless void
To the point of no return
Tempted by black speech
Coming from depths of earth
Stuck in a place where life
Is only sickness of minerals
Meaning of being
Detached from anything
Taken far beyond
Mortal reason
Harvested from fields of sorrow
It's only causes and effects
Infinite states
Of consciousness
