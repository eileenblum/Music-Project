In a dark cramped apartment
An ignored horror continue
Unheard screams full of pain
Nightmare without end
Their short lives filled with struggle
They are wading in blood
Suffering became habit only
Just behind your wall
And you say â life is fight
Never truly experiencing it
The only conflict
I can see
Is between ignorance an reality
A proper life in this morbid world
For some people is unreachable goal
How dare you snivel about your fate
When you're living in a fucking dream
What do you expect
Compassion for nothing
Gain some self respect
Appreciate what you have
Generation of ungrateful
You don't deserve anything
You will be worth nothing
Until you acquire some humility
You fell into idle apathy
Wondering, what's your purpose
Being used as unconsciousness tool
Still obeying what they say
In this time there's no hope
With conception of profit over man
Money comes in paid with power
While innocents still suffer
