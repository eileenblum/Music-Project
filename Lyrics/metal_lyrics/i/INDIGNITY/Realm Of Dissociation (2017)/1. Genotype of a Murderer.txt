I'm asking myself
Where is the limit
When madness begins
What makes me
Human being
Why only call
Of pure insanity
Makes me fell so alive
Masked man
Armed to the teeth
Reloads weapon
Another killing spree
I'm dying to find out
What he feels
Belief that only
Afterlife matters
See it fucking
Blind them
Swallow your
Holy seed
No deity
Will stop me
Mutilated body
Of young woman
Lying with open
Ventral cavity
After all what's inside
That really counts

I want to slit your fucking throat
I want to rip your fucking guts out
I want to look deep into your eyes
And calmly watch how life fades away
In this quiet moment
Clearly you will see
What makes you free
Self conscious creatures
Randomly born
In universe
Not able to
Understand complexity
Of itself
Reproduce and spread
Drugs in bloodstream
Just kicked in
Empty distant look
In drugged eyes
Murder and ingest
Why beauty
Is so sad

I want to slit your fucking throat
I want to rip your fucking guts out
I want to look deep into your eyes
And calmly watch how life fades away
