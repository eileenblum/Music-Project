Minds blurred by hatred
Hearts fulfilled by anguish
Eyes of wandering blind man
Facing wrong direction
Strike for strike
Vendetta vicious circle
World slowly falling apart
Without cry for mercy
Weak falls upon it
Raise their hands to heaven
Asking for help and guidance
Angry god can't hear them
Used by self-confident tyrants
Only want to gain
Climb up pile of bodies
Burn all bridges behind

Violence escalation
Unstoppable process
Let it drag you down
Instead of progress
Old graves of defeated
Spread across the lands
Buried with swords and honor
Forgotten and left to past
Rules made by rulers
To use someone hands
Guidance for only death
Can you hear the chains
Blood floods the street
Shells hits the ground
Hands holding rocks and sticks
Self-reinforcing machine of doom
Strike for strike
Vendetta vicious circle
World slowly falling apart
Destroying itself
