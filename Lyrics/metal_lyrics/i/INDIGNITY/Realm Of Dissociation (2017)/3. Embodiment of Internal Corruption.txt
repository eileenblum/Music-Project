How much pain you can cause
In the name of being right
You want to be above
Perfect, ruthless cruelness
Supposed to make you superior
Completely devoted to the cause
Yet you still only care
About satisfying your own cravings
Justify your deeds
Forgive yourself
Without concert
Let your hypocrisy devour you
Can you feel the itch
Just beneath the surface
Something is coming alive
To haunt you like nightmare
The messiah has come
Godsend that you prayed for
Suffering and sacrifice you idolize
Is here, in real form
Every blood that soaked intro the ground
Is pumped by my dark heart
Flesh and bones of innocent victims
This is my body, take and eat
Righteous cleanse will come
With no goodness and forgiveness
We need to be reborn
From the dust and ashes
The apparent safety will be gone
As soon you will realize
What have you done
What have you become
