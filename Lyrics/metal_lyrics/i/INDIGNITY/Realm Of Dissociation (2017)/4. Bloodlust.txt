Proper development
Stopped by mental sickness
Promises and duties
Pleasure paid in blood
Mouth full of words
Don't you dare to return
With empty hands
Arise and quit your whining
No time to regret
It's a path of fearless
Awareness of power
That lies within us
Be your own commander
Or die as cannon fodder
Ravens feast on fallen
Free your will
From mind of the flesh cage
Or slowly decay in it
Mouth full of words
Don't you dare to return
With empty hands
What's the matter?
Can't you stand the sigh
Of your own blood?
Arise and quit your whining
No time to regret
It's a path of fearless
Paradise lost is here
You, the one who casts shadow
Every-body end up in ground
