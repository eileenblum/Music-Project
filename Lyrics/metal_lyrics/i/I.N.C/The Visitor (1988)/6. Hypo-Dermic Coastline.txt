The tide is high
The sun is blazing red
But we can't go to swin
Because we'll end up dead.
Human waste.
Floating in the waves
Algae is our master
And we are all its slaves
The sea will die in do time
Swallowed up, by the slime
Bacteria will enter in our veins
Creating unknown havoc
The world will go insane.

Disease will spread throughout the land
from sea to shining sea
The fish will all be belly up,
till none are left to eat.
Our feet will be pin coushins
when we walk along the beach

WATCH YOUR STEP!

Infections will all take their toll
on young and old as well
Growths of unknown origin will
spread and slowly swell
We must act now and clean the mess or all will go to hell

SAY A PRAYER!

Contaminate
Every living cell
The flies are getting thicker
The coast begins to smell
Vials of blood.

Corroded with disease
The stench of rotted fish,.
Nature makes, we destroy
like a child with a toy
Seagulls fall.
From the grayened sky
We ask ourselves who did this
The guilty all deny

Disease will spread throughout the land
from sea to shining sea
The fish will all be belly up,
till none are left to eat.
Our feet will be pin coushins
when we walk along the beach

WATCH YOUR STEP!

Infections will all take their toll
on young and old as well
Growths of unknown origin will
spread and slowly swell
We must act now and clean the mess or all will go to hell

SAY A PRAYER!

The tides will cease the dumping goes on still
The law protects the guilty
The ones I'd like to kill
Syringes perce
more and more each day
No use to try and stop it
Disease is here to stay

Guilty hide, behind walls
None confess. None have balls
Altered genes.
Along with altered minds.
Insanity takes over the state of all mankind.
