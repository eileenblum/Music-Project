[originally by The Cars][Just What i Need:]

I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time
'cause when you're standin' oh so near
I kinda lose my mind
It's not the perfume that you wear
It's not the ribbons in your hair
I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time

I don't mind you hangin' out
And talkin' in your sleep
It doesn't matter where you've been
As long as it was deep, yeah
You always knew to wear it well and
You look so fancy I can tell
I don't mind you hangin' out
And talkin' in your sleep

I guess youre just what I needed
(just what I needed)
I needed someone to feed
I guess youre just what I needed
(just what I needed)
I needed someone to bleed

I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time
'cause when you're standin' oh so near
I kinda lose my mind
It's not the perfume that you wear
It's not the ribbons in your hair
I don't mind you comin' here
And wastin' all my time

I guess you're just what I needed
(just what I needed)
I needed someone to feed
I guess youre just what I needed
(just what I needed)
I needed someone to bleed

I guess you're just what I needed
(just what I needed)
I needed someone to feed
I guess youre just what I needed
(just what I needed)
I needed someone to bleed
Yeah, yeah, so bleed me

You're just what I needed
You're just what I needed
Yeah, you're just what I needed
Yeah, yeah yeah

[Candy-O:]

Candy-o, I need you
Sunday dress, ruby ring
Candy-o, I need you so
Could you help me in?

Purple hum, assorted cards
Razor lights youll bring
And all to prove you're on the move
And vanishing

Candy-o, I need you so
Candy-o, I need you so

Edge of night, distract yourself
Obstacles dont work
Homogenize
Decentralize
Its just a quirk

Different ways to see you through
All the same in the end
Peculiar star, a-thats who you are
Do you have to win?

Candy-o, I need you so
Candy-o, I need you so

Candy-o, I need you so
(candy-o)
Candy-o, I need you so
(candy-o)
