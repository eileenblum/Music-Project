Being descend from the sky
In clouds of deadly gases that
will burn straight through your eyes

Are they friend of foe?

Leveling what once was home
My family and friends are dead,
so now I hide alone

The governments's overthrown

The world we know is enslaved.
Mutants rules domain.
The minds of all mankind have been erased
Say goodbye to the hu-man race.

I hide and run to stay alive
A band of rebels takes me in,
they teach me to survive.

We plan to spill their blood

Preparing for the battle ahead
I have no fear cause in my mind
I'm already dead

I hunger for the kill

The world we know is enslaved.
Mutants rule the domain.
The minds of all mankind have been erased
Say goodbye to the hu-man race.

The world unites to fight the plague,
that came for outer space
Killing for humanity, destroy the mutant race.

Terminate their existence.

Regaining once again our home,
the Earth is strooned with dead.

I am now free but memories
still haunt my head

Deranged I've now become.

The world we know have been saved.
Humans rule the domain.
The minds of all mankind have been retraced
Say FUCK YOU! To the Mu-tant race.
