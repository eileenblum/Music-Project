I've lived by one way in my life
To fight all fulfill my dreams
Don't bless me with your empty speech
I only hear the crowds that scream

My mind is open for advice
From someone who has seen the hell
If you would open the small mind
Enceased within you hollow head
You'd learn the world reality
And choke on all the words you've said

But locked will always be your skull
And from your mouth advice will flow
But in the end, you will die slow

DRY HEAVE!
Your words are empty
DRY HEAVE! 
Just like you head

Your words and thoughts are equal to a fuckin' drunken Dry Heave

DRY HEAVE!
Clear the path
DRY HEAVE! 
Just like i said...

We've gone this far on what we know
Not from the things you say and do
We battle with discouragement
And aim our hatred right as you

You live inside you own small world
Where you are king and always right
It's time to step down from your throne

It's all been said, we've said at all
It's up to you to choose the way
Forget the things you've taught yourself
Or here is where you'll always stay

But locked will always be your skull
And from your mouth advice will flow
But in the end, you will die slow.
