Look,
Look at the freak
Must be deprived
To look like I do
Your eyes are froze
Froze to my face
You think i'm insane
Cause i don't like you
Your mind is locked
Locked from the world
Sheltered from the strange
Your high above me
You're just too damn good
Perfect in your mind
But slowly you drown
In your insanity.

What are you looking at?
Don't look at me.
What are you looking at?
What do you see?
What are you looking at?
You're driving me crazy.
What are you looking at?
We're not on drugs
What are you looking at?
Or die hard thugs
What are you looking at?
Don't look at me.
Please.

Think
Think what you want
But deep in your mind
Your bent on burnt rends
You'll stand there and point
Your finger at me
Then turn around and laught
As you whisper to your friends
But i'm aware
And I'll be laughing real soon
Beneath your burnt brains
You have no damn class
So you will see
How we'll grow in this world
And you'll spend the rest
of your life pumping gas
"Fill it up with regular"

What are you looking at?
Don't look at me.
What are you looking at?
What do you see?
What are you looking at?
You're driving me crazy.
What are you looking at?
We're not on drugs
What are you looking at?
Or die hard thugs
What are you looking at?
Don't look at me.

Wait
I'm not done yet
You can't pull out now
You're in way too deep
I will take you down
Down deep within
Now look at yourself
You too are a creep
Don't judge.
Judge from our looks
You should look inside
Deep under my skin
It's up to you
Open up your eyes
If not, you will lose
And I'll always win.

What are you looking at?
Don't look at me.
What are you looking at?
What do you see?
What are you looking at?
You're driving me crazy.
What are you looking at?
We're not on drugs
What are you looking at?
Or die hard thugs
What are you looking at?
Don't look at me.
Please.
