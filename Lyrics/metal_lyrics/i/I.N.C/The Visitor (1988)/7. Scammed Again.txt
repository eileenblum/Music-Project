A ring around noon time
I pick up the phone
A harsh voice screams "YOU'RE THE BEST!"
I wish I could see all the bullshit to come.
What a mess
"I'll set up a tour"
The voice says to me, 
as he takes another suck on his dope.
But deep in his mind he plans to shatter all hope

It seems where getting nowhere
We can't trust anyone
We've been scammed again

Don't call me buddy.
Cause you're a crook,
and not my friend.
We're gonna get you.
Break your legs and stuff you in a box
I hope for your sake
You're in Jamaica
Mr. Cox

So we wait and we wait
and we twiddle our thumbs
But still we can't find our break.
A little voice inside says "IT'S A MISTAKE!"
Then came the day
That blew us away
We said "WE'RE ALL FED UP WITH THIS!"
I dial up the number but the voice says, 
"no longer in service"

It seems where getting nowhere
We can't trust anyone
We've been scammed again

Don't call me buddy.
Cause you're a crook,
and not my friend.
We're gonna get you.
Break your legs and stuff you in a box
I hope for your sake
You're in Jamaica
Mr. Cox

So take my advice, and listen to me.
Don't bite at the very first bait.
Sign your name and you could seal your fate.
Do not expect fame to come without pain.
Don't trust anyone that you meet
This business is war,
and you can never retreat

It seems where getting nowhere
We can't trust anyone
We've been scammed again

Don't call me buddy.
Cause you're a crook,
and not my friend.
We're gonna get you.
Break your legs and stuff you in a box
I hope for your sake
You're in Jamaica
Mr. Cox
