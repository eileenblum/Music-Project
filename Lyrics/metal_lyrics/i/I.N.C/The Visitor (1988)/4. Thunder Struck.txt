Intensity at highest point
Too late to turn back now.
The growing feeling in my veins is to see al others bow
Traveling at the speed of sound
Hear my engine roar
When lightning strikes, I'll proceed to get the final score

NIGHT FALL!
DARKNESS!
Darkness falls, I've come to make my mark
RUMBLING!
ABOVE!
I'll drive you to insanity till the end of dark
TOO LATE!
NO PRAYING!
Attaching electrodes to your freeble grame
WON'T SEE!
THE DAWN!
My satisfaction thrives on seeing you in pain

The dawn you will not see
It's your life, I hold the key
Another victim THUN-DER! Struck

Impossible to stop the pain once i have begun
Break your legs in seven places
Than I'll let you run
Traveling at the speed of sound
Hear my engine roar
When you think it's over I'll be coming
back for more.

NIGHT FALL!
DARKNESS!
Darkness falls, I've come to make my mark
RUMBLING!
ABOVE!
I'll drive you to insanity till the end of dark
TOO LATE!
NO PRAYING!
Attaching electrodes to your freeble grame
WON'T SEE!
THE DAWN!
My satisfaction thrives on seeing you in pain

The dawn you will not see
It's your life, I hold the key
Another victim THUN-DER! Struck

The dawn you will not see
It's your life, I hold the key
Another victim THUN-DER! Struck
