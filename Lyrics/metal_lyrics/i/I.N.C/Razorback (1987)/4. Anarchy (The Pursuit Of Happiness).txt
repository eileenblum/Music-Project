Another Day is dawning
Another day of despair 
A darkened cloud looms low and wide 
Cause no one is awake of all the risks 
That they are taking 
Stepping out that door 
A world full of terror cause nothing is 
Sacred anymore 
There is no justice
To the law they do not exist 
No need to do what you do 
They will screw you too 
No need to resist 

Let's go some shopping 
Let's go out tonight 
We better wear our asbestos suits 
Cause you don't know when you'll ignite
The reign of terror 
The fuse is at its end 
I hope that im getting through 
Cause life's a stage and here's your cue 
Bite back with a vengeance and grab them 
By the groin 
No need to take no crap cause after all 
There are no Shiites on my coin
