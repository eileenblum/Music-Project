Enclosed in this cell, like a corpse in a tomb
Death wreaks around you, awaiting your
doom
Punishment of pain, merciless death
Pray for redemption, draw your last breath

[Chorus]

Your sentence is drawing near, your fate is
closing hard
The plague of death infests you, your
nerves are being scared
Your brain is filled with evil, your heart a
hollow shell
The death card has been signed, committed
into hell
All thoughts of being saved you can't allow
The icy grip of death's upon you now
Scared from whips by guards who've said
Kiss the ground it will soon be your bed
Your body is starved, your ribs have come
through
Feed on the rats before they feed on you

[Chorus]

[Solo - Barath]

The guards have come to get you, don't try
to punch or kick
Say good-bye to life it's over pretty quick
The priest, he has arrived to read the final
rite
Now all is said and done it's time to say
good night

[Chorus]
