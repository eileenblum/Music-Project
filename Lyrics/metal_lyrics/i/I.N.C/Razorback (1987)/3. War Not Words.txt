Discouragement rushes through my brain,
Thoughts of giving in,
Hope my nerves are being slain,
Collapsing from within,
I have dreams you cannot crush,
Bombarded with your lies,
War goes on inside of me,
I hear the battle cries,

[Chorus:]
This means war
This means war
This means war
War not words
This means war
This means war
This means war
War not words

Contamination of my mind,
Plague me with your threats,
Gambling with my sanity,
Begin to place your bets,
I am sheltered from your bribes,
With hate-filled burning force,
Comprising ways to torture you,
Show fucking no remorse,

[Chorus]

[Solo - Barath]

Pleading,
To live your way
Hatred,
Growling day by day
Solutions,
Never to be found
Break the chains,
That keep me bound
Executing my beliefs
Future on death row,
One last chance to save myself,
Live the way I know,
Striking back, split in two,
No time for you to think,
Crushed your soul, sent to hell,
Below you slowly sink,

[Chorus]
