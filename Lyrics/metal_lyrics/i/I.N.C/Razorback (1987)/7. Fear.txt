Step outside a world of fear,
With killing germs in the atmosphere
Polluted waters for us to drink
Which slowly rot our brains
The acid rain will burn your skin
Falling apart, your mind caves in
Find salvation, 
Inject it in your veins
Where is God?
He's been enslaved 
Cause it seems that we are too late to be saved

Blinding your eyes
Fear in your mind is my disguise

Suicide rates at their high 
Suffocated pheasents fall from the sky
No one has fear of war today
The only crime is happiness
Cause none of us has none of this
The sun and moon are both the color gray
Death is something i can't resist
I sign myself to the suicide list
Now there is nothing to fear anymore
I have the key to unlock the door

Blinding your eyes
Fear in your mind is my disguise
