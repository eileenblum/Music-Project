I'm living on the edge of insanity
in your darkest nightmares is where you'll
find me
Crack your skull open I'll feast on your inner
fear
Your heart beats getting louder, the train to
hell is there

INDESTRUCTIBLE - NOISE COMMAND
INDESTRUCTIBLE - NOISE COMMAND

To die here in no pretty sight for one to see
But I will spare your life if you give your soul
to me
Join us as we burn the lives of those who
kill our dreams
I get a thrill of madness when I make the
fuckers scream

INDESTRUCTIBLE NOISE COMMAND
INDESTRUCTIBLE NOISE COMMAND

[Solo - Barath]

I'm living on the edge of insanity in your
darkest nightmares is where you'll find me
Crack your skull open I'll feast on your inner
fear
Your heart beats getting louder, the train to
hell is here

INDESTRUCTIBLE NOISE COMMAND
INDESTRUCTIBLE NOISE COMMAND
