I've seen so many faces caught in my mind,
Eternity is passing i must leave them all behind
Traveling through a tunnel at high intensity,
Where time and space collide the thunder cries for me
Visions of my past life flash before my eyes
Through the walls of darkness no one hears my cries
I know now where i am, my death bed has been laid,
Visions of my past life now begin to fade

The walls they breathe around me
The mist it fills the air
He lures me to his lair
The heat is getting stronger as i join them in their feast
I drink the wine of evil and a toast to the beast
Laughter, breaks the silence, ceremonies may proceed
The wings of death are spread to its words i heed
I know now where i am, my death bed has been laid,
Visions of my past life now begin to fade

[Solo]

The flames are now upon me,
My skin is black as coal
It seems to me my destiny is to burn inside this hole
The sinful thoughts of twisted minds tear through my spine
Can't break the chains that bind me,
It's time to draw the line
As i am falling under, the reaper grabs my hand
Pulls me out the burning hole, shows me the promise land
The flames are still upon me, the holy gates revealed
But the gates are not unlocked, and the keys to open concealed

I know now where i am, my death bed has been laid,
Visions of my past life now begin to fade
Now begins to fade...
