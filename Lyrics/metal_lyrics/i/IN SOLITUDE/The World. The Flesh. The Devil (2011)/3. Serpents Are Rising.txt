Ablaze! Beyond we light a fire
I am pregnant now, with serpent power
My child crawls beyond my veins
I break the chains
We're here again

Where rivers once bled
Where life once thred
And where we were chained

The amber knife is held in rightful hand
Left is the altar maimed and struck
By lightning force trust &amp; beckoning nightsky
We are born again and stars die

Where rivers once bled
Where life once thred
And where we were chained

Serpents are rising
Her coiling tongues among the dead
With prayers on fire
That shakes the cause to its foundation

Serpents are rising
Her coiling tongues among the dead
With prayers on fire
That shakes the cause to its foundation

Daggers within us 
And eyes within the burial earth
Shackles are broken
Our hands are open to her cause
