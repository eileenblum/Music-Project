Beauty crooked the mouth of death
and death conjoined in our mirror
the time has come to break and go through
were invincible invisible

See our smiles drenched blood and night
black thorn crowned and at one with the dusk
solemnly baptized in ash and flameswe 
where never here 

At the border fires we dane to death
noble are our wounds

Sleeping deep on burning fields
we hold the keys
our hungry souls have come to thee
to plant the seed

Follow the footprints thatÂ´s filled with blood
and the burn injured  trees in the dark
we let our shadows show you the way
to the final outpost

Gods sinking in oil
as our daggers exceed
every angel of truth

Sleeping deep of burning fields
we are the keys
our bleeding hearts have come to feed
the shadowseed 

We come with burning
meditating  in serpents pits
we have no names

Phosphorus !

Wither shinsto ruins and black again
to rebuild each vision with you my friend

Brother ours os the graveyard dust
ours is the vision that sunders it all
brother ours is the oath to death
to plant a war , in every star

Sleeping deep on burning fields
we are the keys
we shall become the mystery
now come with me
