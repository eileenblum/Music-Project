Inhale the fury of the darkness
In anaemic vertigo
Across the threshold, I am burning
Between to owl wings I go
I go!

Dance of apostasy
Dance of the adversary

The stench of of death becomes my gateway
Wilder and wilder grows the night

Backwards I dance into the crossroads
Worlds trickle through my hands like sand
I blood and tears I hold the chalice
Libation from the devils

Dance of apostasy
Dance of the adversary

Caress the flame, caress the steep fog
Caress the labyrinth of knives
The bleeding moon cry out for murder
And incense burning, serpentine

Dance of apostasy
Dance of the adversary
Mad art the flame in mind
Bloodline of insanity

One hand that ruptures all foundation
Whiter sins! My world on fire

Another hand that shapes a world
Another passage that unfurls
And in the bowels of the earth
