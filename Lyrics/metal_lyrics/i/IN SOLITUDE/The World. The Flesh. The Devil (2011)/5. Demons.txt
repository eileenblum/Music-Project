And then there was silence, born and bound in me
Amidst the hungry darkness, our eyes learned to see
They are in my blood, their howl is my name
No storm can calm this fire!

The mirror in me
Corrupt with serpents
Their scales cut me free
I kiss the demon
Forbidden, yet opened
We praise the living truth
That crushes the mountains
And swallows the sea

Our roots reaching deeper, like daggers into flesh
Our wounds sing of freedom, bleeding with each breath
These eyes are not blind, I drink the insane flow
My naked heart forgives me!

The mirror in me
Reflects a black rain
That waters my dream
I die with demons
Forbidden, yet opened
We are the living truth
That crushes the mountains
And murders the child

Through cobwebs of time, our winding blades will wing
Tears falling from the dagger, we gather souls to sing
Out temple awaits here, with altars aflame
Come shades, come all, with thunder!

Demons! Demons!

Inside the living temple
My origins and fate
I sacrifice to demons
To demons! To demons!
