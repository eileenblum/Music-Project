I hear them call again
I'm leaving for their realm

I kneel into the storm!
Come cut the throats of the unborn!

I pierce each eye to see the other world behind
I touch the threshold flames in which the blessing lies
Blindfolded flesh of life now wither to their might
I will be gone forever

I see their feathered masks
They're smiling at my scars

I kneel into the storm
Where lifelong shadows ever fall

Into a storm of broken glass I find the way
So few to know the shadowland in which I pray
I am their phoenix son, blessed to become the one
To walk the night forever

To your world
There are no words
To break the burning silence here

Poisoned, blessed and burned for faceless gods
I am legion!
For we are many
Poisoned, blessed and burned for faceless gods within us
I am legion!
For we are many

There's no time to question now
These words are left for you to burn
