A broken chalice calls with a voice that seeks the heart
Like the poison of the snake rising in the dark

Say the words!
I choose to live
I choose to die
On burning paths to the end of the world
To never return!

A truth that outgrows adn sets the path alight
Shadow sail for the land of Nod and the hungry night

Say the words!
I choose to live
I choose to die
On burning paths to the end of the world
On burning path
Unravelling it all!

In the bowels of a broken star and in the deep graves
That echoes with the beating heart of my yearning
To the gods that ignite the path
And the temple within us

To ever wander - forever burning
Against all other - unveil it all

The lips are seeking the sacrifice
Between two worlds I hold the child

A steaming skull entwined with horns
Left hand blessing to the lips of night
My father stares through smokeless flames
Eyes that mirror all eternity

To all beginning
To all end
To death!
Ever faithfull in blood!

The devil's eye in me drew blood to make me see
That these fragments are the keys, I kneel to kiss the beast

Say the words!
I choose to live
I choose to die
On burning paths to the end of the world
To never ruturn!
