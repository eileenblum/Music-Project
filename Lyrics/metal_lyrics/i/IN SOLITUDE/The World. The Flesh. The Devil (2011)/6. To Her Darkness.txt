In the wounds of creation
In the fractures of it all
My hands caress, her bloody veil
That is the night

I am ready
I am hers now

Her temple!
It calls in death and in dream
And to her darkness I go

From her touch to eternity
To the pregnant darkness
I am her child, closer I reach
The circle's heart beneath

Don't look back now
It's forever

Her temple!
It calls in death and in dream
And to her darkness I go

Her hunger!
My bleeding soul that is hers
And to her mutiny I bow

Children born dead
In her satin robes
Of love and misrule
She carries the night

Hold my hand now
It is burning
Don't look back now
It's forever

Her temple!
It calls in death and in dream
And to her darkness I go
One mother!
One thousand facts sealed in silence
I go!
