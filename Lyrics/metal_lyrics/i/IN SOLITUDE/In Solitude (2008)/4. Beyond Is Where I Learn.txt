I set the candles alight
For I have chosen the night
The powers of the unknown
That sparks and shines
All emotions set free
The shadows can see
The forces of darkness
Dwells in me

[Pre Chorus:]
Meditation! Nightsky! Above and below

[Chorus:]
Oh can't you see
The creatures of the unknown speaks to me
Oh can't you fell
The unknown, the red eyes and the beast

I touch the formless night
As it devours all light
It sweaps across the darkness
With blazing might
The astral plane
It's powers shall reign
As the forces of darkness
Is unchained

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]

I see faces
Forming in the night
They give me knowledge
They take me to hell
Beyond!

[Chorus]
