As I stared into the darkness
Red eyes stared back on me
Burning circles through fumes and fire
Mystic symbols and ancient runes

Risen high through the fog
A statue green from age
Spirits howling incantation

[Chorus:]
All Hail Satan
Your envoy is at hand
The monolith
Eyes red as fire
A body build of souls
Of those who seek him

At the edge of time and space
Descent to meet my fate
I saw the faces of thousand demons
As I passed on through the gate

Risen high through the fog
A statue green from age
Spirits howling incantation

[Chorus:]
All Hail Satan
Your envoy is at hand
The monolith
Eyes red as fire
A body build of souls
Of those who seek him
