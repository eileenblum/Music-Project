Still the rain kept falling
The mass passed on through the mist
A procession of dark coats
Held high the crucifix

The darkness grew formless
With secret mysteries
The vast night revealed it's face
Over the long dead trees

[Pre Chorus:]
The darkness thrived relentless
The black mass they were all nameless
They spoke the words of elder kings

[Chorus:]
In the darkness
At the hill
In shapes of demons
With urge to kill

Dark bells were tolling
The conjunction had begun
The procession moved on slowly
Into the beyond!

[Pre Chorus:]
The darkness thrived relentless
The black mass they were all nameless
Ancient demons unfold their wings

[Chorus]

Still the rain kept falling
The mass passed on through the mist
A procession of dark coats
Held high the crucifix

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
