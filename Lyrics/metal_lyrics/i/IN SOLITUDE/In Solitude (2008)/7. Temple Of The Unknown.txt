Dark souls are breathing within these halls
Black arts and sorcery
Shadows reflecting upon the walls
Evoken from infinity

Thunder your hoves and join uor rites
The ceremony has begun
The sorcerer unlocks the pentagram
And all worlds bleed into me

[Chorus:]
Across the path of doom
Into the temple of old
The shrines of the unknown
Black magick!
Dark forces!

[Chorus:]
Across the path of doom
Into the temple of old
The shrines of the unknown
Black magick!
Dark forces!
