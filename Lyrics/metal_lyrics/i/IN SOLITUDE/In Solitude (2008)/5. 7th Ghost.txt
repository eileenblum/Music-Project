In the dark halls of my temple
Where the white cross stands tall
The seventh ghost have entered
Awaiting my call

Spirits of the unknown
Dancing with the flames
Passing through the black halls
Playing wicked games

There is a spirit!
I can feel it's presence here
Dancing round the graves
Feasting upon fear

I wake up the dead!

The evil eye in his spell
Watching my every step
His very name I can not tell
Spawned in the mouth of hell

With the backbone of the night
The seventh ghost stood tall
The devourer of light
And the white cross fall

[Chorus:]
I wake up the dead!
I play in their heads
I wake up the dead!
Tonight their not dead

[Repeat First Verse]
[Chorus]

I wake up the ghost!
