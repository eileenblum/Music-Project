At the center of the graveyard
In the middle of the night
A woman dressed in white
Is closing up in sight
Demon eyes and sharpened nails
Speeding through the night
With deadlike eyes
And the speed of light

[Chorus:]
Nothing but death can stop them tonight
In vicious delight
Nothing but blood can still their thirst
Killing in the night

Twisted beauty without face
Through the ancient maze
I could see her face
Beyond the, human race
In the sign of the pentagram
Now the lot was cast
I could see my past
In damnation vast

[Chorus]

With fire and death in eyes
See strikes out high
Into the dark and flickering sky
Sha has all forces
That hides in the night
Devours the bringer
of eternal light

[Chorus]
