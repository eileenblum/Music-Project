Followers heading against
The fog over the cemetary
Drifting through the silent night

And from the light of their candles
Dark shadows arise

Cemetary
The kathedral

Six disciples guiding the shadows
With the magical hand of doom
And with the claws of darkness
Spirits are torn from the graves

Cemetary
The kathedral
The candle
Burning curse

Now the candle must burn
And the dead will return
The unholy gathering
Under the ancient night sky

Cemetary
The kathedral
The candles
Burning curse
