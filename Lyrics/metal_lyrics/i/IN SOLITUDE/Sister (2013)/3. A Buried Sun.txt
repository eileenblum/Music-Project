Straining all, in longing
through continents of dust
All is forgotten, and helpless
as a sun goes up
in the night

A buried son for
your desolated heart
Weâre reaching backwards
You took a cloven bow
to slit your tender veins
Oh how we laughed

Clambering up, like a drowning child
and you drink me, in the furrows of pain
Once the seed is cast
on the field of night
and Iâm yours beyond recall

A buried son for
your desolated heart
Weâre reaching backwards
You took a cloven bow
to slit your tender veins
Oh how we laughed

Pour through your mouth, love
and stars go out
like little eyes
well up with tears
I am serene
as Satan comes
in yearning rifts
where I may die
The brink persuades
She holds a horses head
the cunt of coal
is my loving grave
I shall be there
when the light is swallowed
and the trumpets of heaven
are open sewers
You are the naked youth
at the ladder of hell
You are the corpse
that comes in grass and gold
deep through the gardens
to lend a key

Free your pale steed within me
and immerse your clouds of stone
All this is killed and made perfect
as the sun goes out
in my eyes

A buried son for
your desolated heart
Weâre reaching backwards
You took a cloven bow
to slit your tender veins
Oh how we laughed
