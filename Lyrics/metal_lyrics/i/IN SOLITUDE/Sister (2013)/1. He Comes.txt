Like flowers in the tracks of loss
He comes, he comes
Like treading water
He comes

Like ailment in the veins of love
He comes, he comes
Like the death of a child
He comes

Amidst the brooding trail to dust
He comes, he comes
A promise bred to exceed trust
He comes

Within the vale of our escape
He comes, he comes
Beyond these walls, a winding way
He comes
