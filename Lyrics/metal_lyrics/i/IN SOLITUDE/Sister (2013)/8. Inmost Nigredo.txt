It wonât be long when morning comes
weâll pattern our adamantine waste
A stranger waits along this road
to take me home

There is something when you draw near
I destroy all things I hold dear
Drink the light from a gibbetâs hand
on an ailing shore, where it strands

In every language Iâve confessed
Its haunted name
Where death opens her thighs
Our paramour of broken tides
You saw us die

Iâve gathered myself

There is something when you draw near
I destroy all things I hold dear
Drink the light from a gibbetâs hand
on an ailing shore, where it strands

For a vestige of closure
in the pool of an eye
that gained sight in a darkness
that was long before night

I come to say my name, I said
I know he wants it where he goes
I know it takes my lot to live
I know it takes this world to die

In mirrors digged up from the earth
I see myself
lambent upon my childhood fields
in wounds

There is something when you draw near
I destroy all things I hold dear
Drink the light from a gibbetâs hand
on an ailing shore, where it strands
