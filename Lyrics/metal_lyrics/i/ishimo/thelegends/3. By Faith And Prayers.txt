When you slept
They didn't torment you
And people claimed for the proof

Gathering...who would trust themselves
So, they've made - a secret

And hits of lash
Covered your skin
The hope was dying within

Always you said, someone betrayed, was only a shadow 
For a new day, you forgave them, without struggle 

At last 
You told the truth, and guided us
We saw you trace
By faith and prayers 

Did not leave any hopeless 
Tried to help understand your signs
And for all, who were faithless
The humanity was crucified

Your preaching like an instrument 
To control the minds
Destruction and indifference
Can be justified

For those, 
Who we call priests 
You'll become a victim
Get down on your knees 

Live by faith and prayers
Live by faith and prayers 

And him, you will follow 
For him, you will get down on your knees
