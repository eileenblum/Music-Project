Do I belive in your pathetic words?
They make me laugh, and oaths are nothing for my heart
Find the explanation for your fault
I'm feel abomination of your own 
I know
You were not alone

Pictures of the victims on the walls
Morals and religion nothing stands
For now
We will wait for dawn

Who is to blame for lie
That brings so much pain?
Answer right now!!

Burnt in the flame innocent heart will remember
Sorrow and pain, terrible scars in december
Way to the graves always be traced
By the memories of all broken fates

Stand and look at me!!!
You may pray

Don't count on me, that I forget your crime
I saw them burning, they ran searching for the light 

What is the cost of their lives?

They were begging for salvation
One mistake has ruined everything

I won't forgive your celebration of greed
This world will see how your laches can kill us all 

Waiting for the dawn, lying in the flame
No one help you now, now you feel the same
