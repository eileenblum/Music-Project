Always when you try to forget those days
You look in the mirror
All you see is the hall of fame

The brave are awaiting their graves

Burn in the eternal fire and take your place

Heartbeating of your own is the 
Sound of the battle cry

Bodies were carved from stone, 
There is no place to run and hidÐµ

No one is standing aside
Smile to the death
And die with pride

They are warmed by the heavenly light
Of the glory
No games - only fight
With the fury

And everyone who survived that day, 
Every night will hear 
The sound of the battle cry

There is no regret, when you contend for existence
And on flesh and bones empire shall arise 
The picture of that day will bring you back

You fell in darkness and voices are whispering your name
So insane !!!
Youâll join the brothers, and they will be screaming your name
