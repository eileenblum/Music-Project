You bleat like a goat !!!

When you see my bloody apron
And my knife, is waiting like a hound
Do you like to be in my home?
I won't let you go

We'll see, how you run and hide
Bell rings, now it is time to die

Now you're in a trap, you are hardly breathing
And crawling in the dark
Try to find a gap, and don't disappoint me
I want to wish you luck

You'll never leave me, It's time for Ð° hunt

My house full of madness
Ugly dummies lie on the floor
You've chosen such a wrong place
To find out what's going on

You see, how painful my imagination is
These things, were made of uninvited guests like you

Now, I can hear your breath
Just let me know, when you are tired of my contest
And you will pay for disturbing my calmness
Today, curiosity gets you to the grave
