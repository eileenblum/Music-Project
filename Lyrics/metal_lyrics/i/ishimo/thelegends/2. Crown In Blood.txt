What have you done ? 
What can you be proud of in your life?
Don't worry
And tell me your lie

It's all your fault
You've created selfish and perfect world 
Drowned in glory 
Your eyes were so blind

Now, It's the time

I know for how many days you will live
Heart in my chest, so cold
There's no chance to forgive you

For all spoken words
You'll take all the response 
Who prays for your life?
Who cares when you die?

Breathe, begging me to free you 
From unavailing life with this night
Feel, what can be so real 
It makes you scream

Glory does not make you proud when your crown in blood

Glory does not make you proud

Looking at your treasure
You awake in greed
It is time to make decision
Before you fall asleep

Now you know that memories are alive
They are haunting you every fucking night
And youâll be affraid till the end of life 
That you could not wash cruel hands of blood
