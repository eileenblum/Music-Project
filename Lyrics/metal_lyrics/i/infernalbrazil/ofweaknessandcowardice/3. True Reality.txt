Millions of lives being threatened
Earth in flames, people crushed
This is the future we learned to fear
But in which we're already living

People are using their minds for their
Own destruction, exchanging it for
The cursed paper that rules men
Who never knew what's like to see
Three families being devastated
By ignorance and corruption

High society living in the greatest abundance
Spending money in absurd mediocrities

While entire populations die in confusion
Without at least knowing why

Pain - people are crushed
Hate - families crying

Death - lost souls
Torture - irrecognizable corpses

True reality
