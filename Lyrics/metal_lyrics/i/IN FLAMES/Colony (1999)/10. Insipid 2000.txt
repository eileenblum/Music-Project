Should I defend you for who you are?
The laws are changed and useless!

On their way to a deserted town
Where empty windows wave goodbye
A helpless excuse, a falling reality
I'm changed by the shock
And the weight of the punch
A helpless excuse, a falling reality

Fragments of a futile being
A puzzle to the noble ones
Ignorant and pitiless they stride

The world around me -
Spartanic, minimalistic
A helpless excuse, a falling reality
The large scale plan that once where
You've now drained from life
A helpless excuse, a falling reality

Who knows the proper reasons
Why it all begins and ends?
Ignorant and pitiless they stride

"You are but a form",
The clean, harsh silence passes
"Genuine" visions by the noble
Ones for the noble ones
