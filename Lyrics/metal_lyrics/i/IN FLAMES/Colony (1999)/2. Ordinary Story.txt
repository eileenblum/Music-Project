Egoism dictates human relations
A world where fashion outshines morality
Here success is written in blood-red colours
Designed by the thirst for power

Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference

An all to ordinary story
With aftertaste so bitter
Forced to be someone I don't want to be
I'm losing myself, sinking deeper down
I'm caught in the world wound web

A time represented by the void
An excuse without content
Stuck in the abyss of existence
With a content void of excuse

An all to ordinary story
This is my story
With an aftertaste so bitter

Sinking deeper down
I'm caught - I'm cage
I'm gone
