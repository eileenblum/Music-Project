I perish and nobody will know
As my mouth remains still
My heart awaits me, filled with gravel
As the pain grows with each touch

Since I marked her out from my tower
Reality focused through forbidden lenses
She owns enough of preciousness
A penalty given by the source

But I still have no choice through
The hinderens frighten
A labyrinth closing at the edge of space

But they never allow
She's shut... for all beings but one
I give, I scorn, I threat
