Truth serves them embrace
And defend her case
Part flattery, part threats
"For those who cling to this
Dominion will partake in its fall"

With his silence, he passes the
Judgement over them
"With your feverish signs of force
You'll make them and yourself to
Believe that he still retains his full power"

As a platform for divine foundations,
You want to make them suck

Shallowness and beauty
Was all that concerned her body
But the soul, her divine guest
Were thrust to the bottom

Surrendered to the sect
That has risen from its womb
"For those who cling to this
Dominion will partake in its fall"
