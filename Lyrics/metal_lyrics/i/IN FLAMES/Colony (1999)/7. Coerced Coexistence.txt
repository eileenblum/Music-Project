I'll take you on a ride
As a part-owner to my pain
Our ideals they collide
Coerced coexistence

I fought the world today - postpone my birth again
We stumble on and on - but bound to die alone

Pine - I'm selling my soul today
Pine - I need some sympathy

This infiltrates my brain
"In the sunshine the sun is mine"
Pitiless wanderer
Close your eyes and bow your head
Grotesque thoughts in a line
Threw my wings into the blazing sun
Smile stretched on old trees
Eternal grinning jester masque

Don't hurt a fly they all sing
We're just ants in a great big play
Commercialize-infect-annihilate-progress
Visualize-inhale-pretend-betray
