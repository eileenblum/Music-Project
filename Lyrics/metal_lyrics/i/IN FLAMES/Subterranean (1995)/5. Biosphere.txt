Slowly the winter wind tears my skin
Blood freezes in my veins
I wish you were here beside me
To release me from my pain
Last night you promised me
You were still in love with me
Please come set me free
From my misery

I love you
Truth be told
I'm completely numb
It got this way
I don't know how
I just can't figure it out

Please talk to me
What do you want me to be?

Last night you promised me
You were still in love with me
Please come set me free
From my misery

I love you
Truth be told
I'm completely numb
It got this way
I don't know how
I just can't figure it out

Please talk to me
What do you want me to be?

Slowly twists my pride
Freezing as I die
Coldly I fade away
My life cannot be saved
Slowly the winter wind tears my skin
Blood freezes in my veins
I wish you were here beside me
To release me from my pain

Please try to remember me
Lord please send help for me
Trying, can't you see?
Why must this be?

Please talk to me
What do you want me to be?
