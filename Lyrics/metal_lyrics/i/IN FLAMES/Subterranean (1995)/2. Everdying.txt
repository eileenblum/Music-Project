Die
Tragedy, cursing me
Bloodlust, crying, never dying
Bloodlust, crying, never dying

From the cold, shadowed waste
Evil grasped my soul and took my hand

Left alone and filled with desire
A spawn of evil and eternal fire

Timeless, immortal, everlasting hate
Timeless, immortal, everlasting hate
Hate...

Drinking the wine
An act out of love
Consumer of lives
You'll join us tonight...

Behold immortality
A dark eternity
Eternity, eternity...

Drinking the wine
An act out of love
Consumer of lives
You'll join us tonight
