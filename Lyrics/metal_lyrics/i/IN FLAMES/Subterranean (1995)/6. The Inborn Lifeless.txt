Close your eyes and pray the wind will take me far away
Life is like a stone behind my back of a second degree
Start
Life is a feather of fall between the monument tear
Like a powder fragile the one that blows behind the
Faithful dead
All the doors of eternal gray
This weakness take beyond the dream
With a silent void you're left while you can hardly breathe
Vastly they destroy the tears of my lies
Fears are fading away, robbed to face the bitterness
In search for my dear
Castle burries the bite of a queen
Wherever the sorrow rises from distance like a rainbow
I'll be there again, to weep behind with my tears
Heyargh!
Wake me
The second lifeless to be

Thanks to the_deepest_grey for sending track #6 lyrics
