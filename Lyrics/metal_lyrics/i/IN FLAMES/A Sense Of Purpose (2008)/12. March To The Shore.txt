I used to adore you
The lies made sense somehow
Gave myself away without a fight
But the betrayal claims its price

At first I was scared
Not used to a murder's mind
But there was something beautiful
So powerful, so definite, so divine

Pushing the faith
Build out of rage

[Chorus:]
Falling ideals
Broken seals
March to the shore
You are a killer!

Is it something that's always been there?
Was it always destined to leave its cage?
I'm glad we met though
I love to release the rage

But everything has its end
And I've done my deed
The final bullet - always meant for me

Pushing the faith
Build out of rage

[Chorus]

But everything has its end
And I've done my deed
The final bullet - always meant for me

[Chorus x2]
