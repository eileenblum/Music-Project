So restless,
These walls drain my thoughts
Room 307
Can't find my way out

It used to be my home
This cage, far from my comfort zone
Alive but without control...
Fear is taking hold

I should cross the line
Confront like the blind

[Chorus:]
Hear a distant cry...
Would you tell me how
To break the cycle that I'm in
And discover the living?

I don't recognize my soul
Condemned to live in this black hole?
Dig within time... and crave what is mine.

[Chorus]

I should cross the line...
Confront like the blind

Hear a distant cry...
Would you tell me how
To break the cycle that I'm in

It's a hill to climb
Would be a dream if I,
Design a future and
Not the end of time
