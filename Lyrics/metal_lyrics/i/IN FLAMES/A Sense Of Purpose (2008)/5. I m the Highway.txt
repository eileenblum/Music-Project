I am my deepest shadow,
Something I can't ever neglect,
Rise above these ashes,
Or fall and fade away

In dark moments, I know better,
Within destruction, I see clearly

[Chorus:]
From here to new grounds,
Suppose I will be doing it alone,
With a smile through black design
Fearless of your conviction

Staring into truth, I am the highway,
Existence, care for me in all
Your everlasting complications

In dark moments, I know better
Within destruction, I see clearly

[Chorus]

Forget the promised land,
There was never an invitation,
Today I create my own,
Before there was sorrow
And lack of attention

[Chorus]
