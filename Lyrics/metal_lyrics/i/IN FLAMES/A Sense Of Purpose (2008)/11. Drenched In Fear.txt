You won't
Find a friendly face in the crowd,
It's quite amusing to see how you suffer

I refuse, to let you steal my daylight,
Barely awake - but it strengthens my night rage
I've seen you kill many dreams,
But I got brand new armour,
And your weapons are way out of reach

How does it feel to be demolished,
Vaporized into thin air?
Strange new feeling to be nothing.

[Chorus]
All the words I hear... they don't mean a thing [x2]
All drenched in fear,
And the hate you bring

Make me bother, I dare you,
I've got the strength I need,
But I'll await my darkest moment,
When the guilt doesn't get to me.

[Chorus x2]
