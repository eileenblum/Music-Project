Used to be original,
But now I tremble in fear
I am like everyone else
And that buries me

Is this how it feels
To reach rock bottom
Want to know how it feels to be forgotten?

[Chorus:]
I've become the distance,
I am the sober and irrelevant,
I don't feel part in this,
What is there to believe?

I'm not asking for much, just a moment
A chance to pick up the pieces
Happiness, please, come home

What if it ends right here
How do I change it?
Hoping to find a saviour
I've lost my way

[Chorus]

Is this how it feels
To reach rock bottom
Want to know how it feels to be forgotten?
Hoping to find a saviour
I've lost my way

[Chorus]
