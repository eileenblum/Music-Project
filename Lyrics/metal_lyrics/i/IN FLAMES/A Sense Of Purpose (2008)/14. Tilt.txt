[Japanese Bonus Track]

We all find ourselves,
In honour of the good cause.
How empty we've become,
With our sight to be the true force.

Does every instinct say you're right?
I think sometimes there is doubt.

You're waiting for a re-run,
But yesterday won't come.
Want to relive the moment,
But yesterday is done.

Lies and desperation lead us through as we're trying to be heroic,
I swept the world (?) to watch you manage.
Take a step back,
I'll tie you to it.

You're waiting for a re-run,
But yesterday won't come.
Want to relive the moment,
But yesterday is done.

Hopes and prayers in pursuit of salvation,
Take a short cut, it only bends our cause.
But as far as I remember,
There is nothing that will get back the days you lost.

Does every instinct say you're right?
I think sometimes there is doubt.

You're waiting for a re-run,
But yesterday won't come.
Want to relive the moment,
But yesterday is done.
