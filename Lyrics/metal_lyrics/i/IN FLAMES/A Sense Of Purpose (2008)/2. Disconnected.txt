Look at the dead outside my window
Wonder what's on their mind?
Why do they run?
They all seem to have a mission
But then they cry themselves to sleep

[Chorus:]
You receive what you give
And this is like nothing
I feel like shit
But at least I feel something

Is this all you meant to be?

Their marks in the pavement
You've walked this route too many times
What if I changed the signs?
Would you even take notice?

[Chorus]

Is this all you have to give?
So... March... Straight jacket union...
So... March...
In chains - surrender

[Chorus x2]
