[Gelotte, StrÃ¶mblad]

April, night-tyme
And we run like muscles through the stagnant nodes of man
Blood-bridges lean towards the gaping synapses
to disarm the stars within us.

Hornet. Hive-dark
Severed wings in vainless beating
buzz out from an inferno of fangs
to disarm the stars within us.

We should have been
so much more by now
Too dead inside
to even know the guilt.

Waning. Ring-deep
a halo of thorns
Sips now down in sheets of sharp silver
to disarm the stars within us.
