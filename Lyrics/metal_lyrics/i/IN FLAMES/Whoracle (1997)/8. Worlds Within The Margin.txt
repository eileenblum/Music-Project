[LjungstrÃ¶m, StrÃ¶mblad]

Raindrop hits the leaf, changing its position slightly on the street,
next to polls of monotonous water. He walks. Slipping feet from
steps at random. He falls.

In the space between his body and the ground
comets cast off their names, stellar neurones misfire.

Witnesses x13
inhale the seed
and spit out a million branches

Buds abloom in all directions,
from which events occur
relations and virused meetings
catch fire and explode
In the margin of butterfly wings
entire cycles of evolution
outplayed and faded,
sparked and leaned back into
vacuum-filled nirvana.

Between the two of my eyes
feverish fractals soar,
dance like they were on drugs
peyote labyrinths, re-mapped exits
A hasty blink
and a million life-to-comes
will never be the same
as they never were.

In the kinetic energy of a moving fist
lies a birth-machine for a parallel universe

With the first movement in the organic soap
came a bouquet of alternative answers
all different, multiplied and re-divided

Coded in the spinal cord of a trilobite,
written between the legs on the Meganeura
suburban city maps and dormant dictator semen
marked their way through time.
