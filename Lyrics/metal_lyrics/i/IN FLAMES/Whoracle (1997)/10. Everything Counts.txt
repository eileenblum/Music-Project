[originally by Depeche Mode][Martin Lee Gore]

The handshake
Seals a contract
From the contract
There's no turning back
The turning point
Of a career
In Korea being insincere

The holiday
Was fun packed
The contract:
Still intact

The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
All for themselves
After all

It's a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts

The graph
On the wall
Tells the story
Of it all
Picture it now
See just how
The lies and deceit gained a little more power

Confidence taken in
By a sun tan
And a grin

The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
All for themselves
After all

It's a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts

The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
