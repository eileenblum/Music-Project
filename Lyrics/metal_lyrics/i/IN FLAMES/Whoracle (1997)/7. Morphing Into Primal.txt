[Gelotte, LjungstrÃ¶m, FridÃ©n, StrÃ¶mblad]

Detonation
Fireworks and alchemy
Genes spliced and triggered
into the future
and her organic cave

Seismorgasmic omnipotence
scenes of magma in my eyes
Eruption stones my system

I owe this to the animal inside
and the stiffness that blocks out the daylight
Morphing into primal

I'll cover every particle
from there to Andromeda
not forgetting a single location
from the throat of the Ibis
to the co-ordinates of Matterhorn

My shot is genesis and catharsis
Penetratonaut in a cosmology of lusts

Suck this subterranean creature out
and show it proudly to the house of heaven
With one slight wave of my hand
stars dissolve

Dissolve my brain
Block my lungs
I'll die from fever tomorrow
when locked in such a perfected "now".
