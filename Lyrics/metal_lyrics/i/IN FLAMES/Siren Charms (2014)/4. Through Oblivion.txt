False affection took the best of me
Deep inside, the absent mind
Denial and hypocrisy
All in the same
To do this right we part our ways

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
Suddenly I know, I have to let it go

All has been lost
All has been won
Now I see it all right before me
Intentions are pure, I'm out of reach

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe

And I have wings
I have nothing and everything at the same time
Oh, a brighter sun
No more rain

Save me from my fears
The darkest thought I bare
Carry me through times
Through oblivion

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe,
'Cause now I know!
