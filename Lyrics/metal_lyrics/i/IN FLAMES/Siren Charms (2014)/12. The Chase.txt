[Bonus Track]The chase
A wild one
Has to become
Figuring out where you need to be
Find the pulse
Into with all you see
It's infront of you
Every other way
Leads to the same old great wall

Hit first with the speed of light
I won't be showing songs of me

In vain
Sometime
I'll find right where I belong
A life that was meant to be
Have faith in me

Sometimes it's hard to believe
The stories remain
I should just force right through
I guess it's for a reason
we waiting in line at the station

Hit first with the speed of light
I won't be showing songs of me

In vain
Sometime
I'll find right where I belong
A life that was meant to be
Have faith in me
Have faith in me

Hit first with the speed of light
I won't be showing songs of me

In vain
Sometime
I'll find right where I belong
A life that was meant to be
Have faith in me
