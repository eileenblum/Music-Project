[Bonus Track]I can see it all
against in my way
Before I end time
I close my eyes

It feels like a could find
a place in this mess
And I dream that I'm blind

And I'm weightless
when I become the sky

The earth, the moon,
the sun beneath me
This is letting go
I'm all over
I reach far and wide

I want to be the one
That believes
I feel like I'm
Part of this mess and I wish

That I'm weightless
when I become the sky

The earth, the moon,
the sun beneath me
This is letting go
I'm all over
I reach far and wide

The earth, the moon,
the sun beneath me
This is letting go
This is on my mind
When the world be mine
