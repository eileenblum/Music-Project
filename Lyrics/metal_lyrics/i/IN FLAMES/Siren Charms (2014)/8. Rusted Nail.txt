You want someone to blame
The one who drives the rusted nail
But whoâs left will never care
Pretending becomes a chore
All you search for, a little piece of mind
Too far, too deep, the two faced smile
So lost, you feel, I know

Wide awake but still asleep
Always a stranger in a crowd (sleep, sleep, sleep)
Wide awake, always a stranger in a crowd (wake, wake, wake)

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will
Iâm there until the end of time

Leave the doomed behind
Search with different light
You were trying to remember
But itâs all make believe

You are, you are, you are

Wide awake but still asleep (wide awake but still asleep)
Always a stranger in a crowd

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will
Iâm there until the end of time

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want, Iâm there

Just this once
Listen to the words I say
If you want I will
Iâm there until the end of time
