I say goodbye to you all at once -

Don't dare to face you all alone.

I went from wreckage to world class with a box of t-shirts and some more records to sell

but times have changed - I have to defend my actions.

The foundation crumbles and I have to leave.

Thanks for everything - I couldn't ask for more...

I say I love you all... as I vanish through the Jester's Door.
