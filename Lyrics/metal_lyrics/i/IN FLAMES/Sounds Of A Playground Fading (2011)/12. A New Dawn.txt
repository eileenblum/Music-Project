I dreamed that you had died
I'm forever alone
I'm weakened, I'm frightened
This place's about to change
Things you said to me
Believe and the things you might find
Will turn into a march

I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again
(Its moments like this)
I am what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

Feel the sudden aches
Time to get moving
Getting somewhere with no directions
I swear to you it will never be the same
Its astray, but the road lies open
Leaving all tears behind

I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again
(Its moments like this)
I am what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again
(Its moments like this)
I am what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me

Erase darkness from my mind
Last remaining night
From here to everywhere

I stand alone and breathe again
I won't stop until this is through

And I can't wait to see the sunrise again
(Its moments like this)
I am what you'll never be
To better what I am
You won't hear lies from me
