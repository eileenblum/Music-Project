I know what it takes to break you

You know I never sleep
Just because you made them think
Doesn't mean the world will fall into place

Took some time but now you know
Tomorrow is too late

Close your eyes, walk with me, I'll set you free
And everything you ask for

I found a way
And I'm returning soon
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And will be, I will be with you
Tonight

If today was your last day
Would that change a thing?
You probably believe what you told them
Live each moment like your last

Well, close your eyes, walk with me, I'll set you free
And everything you ask for

I found a way
And I'm returning soon
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And will be, I will be with you
Tonight

I found a way
And I'm returning soon
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
I will be with you

I found a way
And I'm returning soon
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
I will be, I will be with you
Tonight
