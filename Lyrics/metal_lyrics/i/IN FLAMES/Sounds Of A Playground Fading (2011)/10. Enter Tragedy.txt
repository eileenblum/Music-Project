Twisting tongue

Fallen off the edge again
Need some space

Need disgrace

I'm confused I'm a maze

I need for you to pick me up, when I fall down
There's so much more

We can go far

But I can't control my selfish ways

Enter tragedy, slash my soul
Why is it a part of the plan?
Do you question me?

I question you

Who's the man in front of me?
I'm blindfolded, I can't see

Need a reason, I'm left empty
There's so much more, we can go far,

But I can't control my selfish ways

This inner apathy, brings me to life
I know it's strange and it's draining me
I'm tired, I'm fed up, Iâm a Slave
