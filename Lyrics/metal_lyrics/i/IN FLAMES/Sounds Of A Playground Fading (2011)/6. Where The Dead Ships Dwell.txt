the pictures slowly fades,
the walls are closing in,
and there I was, cursing the ground,
unable to understand

I wonât let the world break me
so I need to change direction
nothing special I'm far from perfect
light the way for me

I wonât say Iâm sorry, I got what I deserve

feel I was running an endless mile,
last candle it burns
and I'm dying inside
all of this will turn to ash
a change for a piece of mind

walking where the dead ships dwell
these are shores I left behind
streets were getting smaller
and I have to leave

feel I was running an endless mile,
last candle it burns
and I'm dying inside
all of this will turn to ash
a change for a piece of mind

All I hear is noise
heart so false
so guess, I took it for granted
I know I went too far
I wont say I'm sorry
I got what I deserved
I got what I deserved

feel I was running an endless mile,
last candle it burns
and I'm dying inside
all of this will turn to ash
a change for a piece of mind

feel I was running an endless mile,
last candle it burns
and I'm dying inside
all of this will turn to ash
a change for a piece of mind
