Remind me I'm golden...
The fortress above the sun
Why don't you spend nowhere with me?
Follow the river and the path of the ones I name...
On the shore

[Pre-Chorus:]
Forever I can't find
Struggling in a world undefined...
Or destroyed
I don't want it to be
I'm not in to live

[Chorus:]
Fly into the distance
Disappear for a while
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today feeling alive

It starts to fall apart
Let me take control
Reminisce

This is nothing more
Something I will find again, deliver us
Deliver us

Can't hear the words you say

[Pre-Chorus:]
Does it really matter?
I'd give the world to you if you just

[Chorus:]
Fly into the distance
Disappear for a while
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today alive!

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Fly into the distance
Disappear for a while
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today alive!
