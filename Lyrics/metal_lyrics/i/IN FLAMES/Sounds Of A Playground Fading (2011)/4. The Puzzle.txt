And I tried to think
Tried to paint the picture
I lived it all
Wouldnât have to feel this way

Looking for something to believe in
I think Iâve done my time
One by one the pieces fall
Tell me what it is to believe

You can tell days by their faces
There is always signs
Answers to the puzzle
Grab a piece of the light

Keep pretending
I can handle everything
Youâll never understand me
And I donât care what you think
Or maybe I do
