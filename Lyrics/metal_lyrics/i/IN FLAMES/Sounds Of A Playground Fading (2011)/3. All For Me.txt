Until the world ceases to move!
A burning feeling, let me call, "This is real!"
I wish one more thing!
I flinch my hands and bang my head!

Take whatever comes to you,
All the while - I don't need another friend.

I burn when I do the things I do for you.
Forever the night, it's all for me now,
I'm sure that one day I can get you...
All that you lost.

I'm never told, "Bad I stay, so sick in me."
I'm dying alone.
We stand to fight for nothing!
Without a thought of reason!
We will never be OK!

I burn when I do the things I do for you.
Forever the night, and it's all for me now,
I'm sure that one day I can get you...
All you lost.

A growing pain, it is hard to say what brought the darkest burden.
For some of us there is no answer.

Chains are breaking, I regret this built up inside of me.
There's a storm coming.
I will serve no more, 'til my heavy last breath!

I burn when I do the things I do for you.
Forever, the night, it's all for me now,
I'm sure that one day I can get you...
All that you lost.
