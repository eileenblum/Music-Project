[Bonus Track]I told you once,
I told you twice,
And still you're backing out.

I hear you once,
I hear you twice,
And it still doesn't count.

[Chorus:]
So here we are,
What's left of us will come to an end.
So here we are,
Why don't you walk away?

My head's a mess.
My broken bones feel like a victim.
But you're not in control,
You're filled with rage,
One last mistake!
You are no victim,
Just one without a soul!

The same old sound,
1, 2, 3 times,
The greatest greed,
Is just an empty room dream...
