How far to go?
I'll never know.
I pushed to hard,
So you ran away.

I know 
You bleed for me,
And you know
I'd die for you!

A journey yearning with open eyes
From darkness to light...

[Chorus:]
The cold is real -
That I know.
The scars I feel,
But I wont let go.

I know that I can find
The meaning of it all,
Put my fears behind
Before I fall...

My will to be
Something more,
Say the right words
And be what I've promised.

I know you bleed for me,
I know I will die for you...
