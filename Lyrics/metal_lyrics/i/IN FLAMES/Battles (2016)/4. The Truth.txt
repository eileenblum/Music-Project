We are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are

The time has come to bring you down
Take the power back and show you how
I hear the sound of a plane passing by
Someone have the same thoughts as I
But as I get to the end of mine
You deny and think everything's fine

We are, we are, we are
We are the truth that hurts the most cause
We are, we are, we are
It hurts when your denial is exposed
It hurts when your denial is exposed

Why can't we see eye to eye?
Think of all the things we leave behind
I hear the sound of a car driving by
You can go on for miles
But you will run out, this is not your day
Are you just gonna turn around and walk away?

We are, we are, we are
We are the truth that hurts the most cause
We are, we are, we are
It hurts when your denial is exposed
It hurts when your denial is exposed

But as I get to the end of mine
You deny and think everything's fine

We are, we are, we are
We are the truth that hurts the most cause
We are, we are, we are
It hurts when your denial is exposed
We are, we are, we are
It hurts when your denial is exposed
It hurts when your denial is exposed
