(pain!)
You're not my friend and I despise you!
(friend!)
You are my pain and I adore you...

What are you waiting for?
I'm here!
Let's consume it all.
(let's consume it all)

[Chorus:]
Before they take it all away...

I hear them from the other side,
As I sit and let the day go by,
I'm trying to see
If the world is still alive.

(insane!)
To be caged when you're to blame...
(blame!)
Brake free from insanity to praise you.

[Chorus]
