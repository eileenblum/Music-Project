I can't wait to hear your voice again.
I am far from lonely, 
But without you I'm a mess.
I close my eyes and drift away,
I'm wondering what you're doing now...

[Chorus:]
When I look at you
I see me.
We will always be part of history.

When I look at you
I see me!
Here until forever I will always be...

Mind and soul we are the same.
A hand on your heart,
You know I'm there.
You are my lighthouse in the dark,
I can see you from a thousand miles.

I hope you feel that nothing dies,
I am alive in all you touch.

[Chorus]
