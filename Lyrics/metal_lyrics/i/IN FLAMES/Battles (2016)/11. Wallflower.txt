I like to look at you from a distance
I like when you scream in my face
Afraid to say the right words in right order
So they make sense to a person with such grace

What if my dreams don't become reality?
Is my life just a big mistake?
Will I be happy for the times I had
Or would I reconsider and recalculate?

I wanna be heard but leave no trace
I wanna be seen but take no space
I wanna be, I wanna be, leave no trace
I wanna be, I wanna be, take no space

The older I get, the younger I feel
The younger I feel, the older I seem
The more I feel, my age seems real
I Like to pretend I'm as young as I feel
