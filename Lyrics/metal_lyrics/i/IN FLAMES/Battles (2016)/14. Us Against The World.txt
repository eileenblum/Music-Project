[Bonus Track]I wish you would've listened
Can you hear me now?
You're in control
The thin red line.
A change in life,
The pride, the cries
The lesson we should learn
From lies.

Dance across the sky,
Conqueror of pain.
The abandoned reign,
You should be lord among the flies.

I wish you would've listened
Can you hear me now?
Tell me what to do,
I'm right beside you,
(It's) us against the world.

This can only end one way,
Let's seize the day.
It's us against the world.

Through the cracks a new voice appears,
Dividing the clouds,
The horizon,
The hope,
From the most lonesome nights...
