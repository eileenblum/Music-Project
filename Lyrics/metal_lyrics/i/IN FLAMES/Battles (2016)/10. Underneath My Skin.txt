Waiting for miracles to appear,
All the heights I did aspire
Seems forever gone.

A torn and shredded grin
To fit the blackened day,
Shovelling the ashes 
From the times of selfish ways.

[Chorus:]
I'm taking more than I can give.
Is this the life I wanna live?
There's nothing underneath my skin!
Is this the life I wanna live?

Falling like stars from the sky,
Burned out before the trial
And are forever gone...

Kneel and pray to find the right way back inside,
Been to hell and back but still feel I'm blind...

[Chorus]
