You did me wrong and I applauded you!
I became the blade and I pierced through!
Now hiding from the world outside,
Trying to create magic for the pacified!

You never felt the answers
Were aimed at you, my friend.
Did you find yourself lost
In the world we swore to protect?

[Chorus:]
If you could see it,
If you could see it though my eyes...
Why are we so different?

Want you to feel it,
Want you to know what it was like...
Then maybe you'll understand.

You always did prefer to keep me on distance
So no wonder it served as your riddance

You never felt the answers
Were aimed at you, my friend
Did you find yourself lost
In the world we swore to protect?

[Chorus]
