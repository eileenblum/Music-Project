I believe
That the whole wide world is against me.
I believe 
That the whole wide world 
Is afraid of me.

How did I end up here?
Half alive 
And so full of tears fears...
If I'm honest I think you'll see,
I'm scared to shit, what's coming for me.

You say: make the most of your time,
(But) how does that work when it's not on your side.
What can't kill you
Makes you stronger,
So I heard
But I'm going under!

I will try!

[Chorus:]
I want the whole world, 
The whole world
The whole world
In my hands (in my hands)
but it keeps slipping through like sand.

I try hard to be like you.
You're my queen, but i break in two.
I think I can overcome
All the mistakes that I've done.

You say: make the most of your time
(But) how does that work when it's not on your side.
What can't kill you
Makes you stronger.
So you say
But I'm going under!
