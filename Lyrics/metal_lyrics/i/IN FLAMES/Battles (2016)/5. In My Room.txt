Here in my room,
I'm behind the wall.
I'm out of reach,
I don't sympathize.

Adjusting the level of delusion...
Feel like you're one of the sane?
Encoding the white noise,
Loose my way and fall again...

[Chorus:]
Creating drams from a broken past!
It tears a hole and sucks you dry!
If you know secrets
Tell me now!

Creating dreams, let the worlds collide!
Escape the void and feel alive!
Don't have the answers
But I'll survive!

Here in my room,
I'm behind the wall...
Away from the flock,
Closure will come...

Adjusting the high of expectation,
Feel like you're one of the brave.
Dig deeper,
Find a new path and climb again!
