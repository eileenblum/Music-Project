So save me

[Verse 1]
Here's a hammer
Build a ladder
It's a long way up to heaven
If I dig it might take as long
But maybe in hell that's where I belong
Seven days and seven nights
Funny he found the fires
And I have walked this path before

[Pre-chorus]
I'm afraid I'd lose it all

[Chorus]
Somebody save me
Somebody save me
I've been trying so hard
But I can't see that far
So save me

[Verse 2]
Just let it rain
I rather stay away
From laughs' overcoming
And the company of crows
Memories, they fade
But I'm far too awake
Welcome to my dream

[Pre-chorus]
I'm afraid I'd lose it all

[Chorus]
Somebody save me
Somebody save me
I've been trying so hard
But I can't see that far
So save me [2x]

[Guitar Solo]

So save me
(Save me)

[Verse 3]
Just let it rain
I rather stay away
From laughs' overcoming
And the company of crows
Memories, they fade
But I'm far too awake
Welcome to my dream

[Pre-chorus]
I'm afraid I'd lose it all

[Chorus]
Somebody save me
Somebody save me
I've been trying so hard
But I can't see that far
So save me

[Outro]
Save me
Save me
I've been trying so hard
But I can't see that far
So save me
Save me [4x]
