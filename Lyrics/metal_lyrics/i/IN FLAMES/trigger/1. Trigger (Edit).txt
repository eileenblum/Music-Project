Is it dark or is it bright
What's the latest on the screen
Please tell me my name
I haven't checked it today

I am running from something that I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone

Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today cause there's only a few
A sign of times my friend

Avoid infinity
Are you for real

Just scratch the surface
And you will find
Something to blame for a long lost time

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone

Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today cause there's only a few
A sign of times my friend

Just scratch the surface
And you will find
Something to blame for a long lost time

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone

Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today cause there's only a few

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why

Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today cause there's only a few
