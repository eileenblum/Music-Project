I lost my visual
Cause all you fucks are in my way
So drop her off this route
Take em to some far place
Watch them feed

Seal the signs of the borders 
We are here to bend
Penetrate the outlines 
Lightness of color 

They say the world is struggling
But we are stuck upside down 

Imaginary reality
Suffer from make believe
I'll chance the fate 
Take em to some far place
Watch them feed 

They say the world is struggling 
But we are stuck upside down 

No purpose, no scorn
No sorrow will be wasted on you
No purpose, no scorn
No sorrow will be wasted on you

They say the world is struggling 
But we are stuck upside down

No purpose, no scorn
No sorrow will be wasted on you
No purpose, no scorn
No sorrow will be wasted on you
