People like you
You live in a dream world
You despise the outside 
And you fear you're the next one

It's in your dream
There's just one question
Should I kill
Or should I be left behind

Sick and tired
Of all your complaints
This is the hour
We bring it down

I've come to realize
Every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected, cloud connected

You seem to be
So introverted
How come we fail

You crossed the line
You remember my name
Time runs backwards
As we're heading that way

I've come to realize
Every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected, cloud connected

Cloud connected

I've come to realize
Every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected, cloud connected

I've come to realize
Cloud connected
I was told that I could fly
Cloud connected
