When all is said and done
We'll know what's right, what's wrong
But does it matter then
When all is said and done

When all is dead and gone
We'll know who lost, who won
But does it matter then
When all is dead and gone

See everything go
End of all things
The life that we know
Shift your point of view
You've been warned
This one way ticket is for you

When all the lights go out
We know what life's about
But does it matter then
When all the lights go out

When all that's left is lies
We'll see nothingness and realize.
But does it matter then
When all that's left is lies?
