Vanishing light
The end of a compromise
In fury, in rage
A dream will diminish

Behind enemy lines
Learn to survive
Find a way to clone
Make friends and a place to call home

Take a picture and jump before we crash [x2]

Slide away
Learn your ways and fire when ready
This is a race
To no mans land
But who knows the direction?

You're on the easy route
Money up front?
There's no doubt

Take a picture and jump before we crash [x2]

Slide away
Learn your ways and fire when ready
This is a race
To no mans land
But who knows the direction?

It's so sad
But pay no mind!

Take a picture and jump before we crash [x2]

Slide away
Learn your ways and fire when ready
This is a race
To no mans land
But who knows the direction?
