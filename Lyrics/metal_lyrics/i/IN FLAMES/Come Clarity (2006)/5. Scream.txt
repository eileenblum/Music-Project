We are ordinary people,
We all live different lives
In the end we're pretty much the same
We're just living in different lies
We just live in different lies! [x2]

They scream, You scream, I scream
We scream but no one listens

Abuse to feel superior,
Is it working for you?

They scream, You scream, I scream
We scream but no one listens

Abuse to feel superior,
Is it working for you?

We are ordinary people,
In a world build on stress
When we build walls around us
We end up in a mess
