In a disaster story
A central conflict of primal rage
Usual sort of desperation
Characters remain the same

Never cut you out,
I cut you in

Feeding on life leftovers
I am writing to you
You should realize
It hurts in me, too

Walk on broken glass
Is the pain safe at the end?
All the elements in life's complexity
Make our struggle infinite

Never cut you out,
I cut you in

Feeding on life leftovers
I am writing to you
You should realize
It hurts in me, too

All the elements in life's complexity
Make our struggle infinite

Never cut you out,
I cut you in

Feeding on life leftovers
I am writing to you
You should realize
It hurts in me, too

(I cut you in)

Feeding on life leftovers
I am writing to you
You should realize
It hurts as I cut you in
