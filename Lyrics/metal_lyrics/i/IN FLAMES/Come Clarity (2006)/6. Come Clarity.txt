Rushing through thirty
Getting older every day... by two
Drawing pictures of innocent times
Can you add color... inside these lines?

[Chorus x2:]
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don't want to live
In a dream... one more day

Sure it would change my perspective
I'm certain I would change today
I'm certain it would change our ways
Would things fall into place?

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Just don't want to live
In a dream one more day [x2]
