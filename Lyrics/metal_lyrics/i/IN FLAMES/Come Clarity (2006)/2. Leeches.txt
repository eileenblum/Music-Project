Leeches.
Like leeches
"In ignorance we trust"
If you say this way, I'll take that way
Fuel for the fire on which I thrive

Spit me out
I'm glad I don't belong
Save me the speech (I know)
You'll be forgotten and gone

It burns, it rips, it hurts

Leeches, they preach to us
Words of wisdom from blocked minds

Spit me out
I'm glad I don't belong
Save me the speech (I know)
You'll be forgotten and gone

It burns, it rips, it hurts

They make you believe your turn
The chance of a lifetime,
How does it feel to be alive?

A tear for the poet that can't be heard
(And) praise the artist that steals
