Shot for shot
Many bullets penetrate me
Embrace me
Tell me stories of golden gods
The precision in your voice
Pierce the walls that I've built
Your eyes reach deep in me

Take a chance
They don't come much bigger than this
Dark star spend another day with me
A dead surface that doesn't reflect
The storm underneath
Take the chance
Bring me the calm

...And it leaves nothing

Expose the dark side,
Aching and emotional,
Expose the dark side,
Impossible to tame

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

Throw yourself into the eye of chaos
Infiltrate me,
Sneak out before I awake
Take out the trash and burn it
Try and find a beautiful place to lay
These fragile bones of mine

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really...

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

... And it leaves nothing

Expose the dark side, aching and emotional
Expose the dark side, impossible to tame

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really...

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really...

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me
