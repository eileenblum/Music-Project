egoism dictates human relations
a world where fashion outshines morality
here success is written in blood-red colours
designed by the thirst for power

gather the faithful and propose a toast
to the epoch of indifference

an all to ordinary story
with aftertaste so bitter
forced to be someone I don't want to be
I'm losing myself. sinking deeper down
I'm caught in the world wound web

a time represented by the void
an excuse without content
stuck in the abyss of existence
with a content void of excuse

an all to ordinary story
this is my story
with an aftertaste so bitter

sinking deeper down
I'm caught - I'm cage
I'm gone
