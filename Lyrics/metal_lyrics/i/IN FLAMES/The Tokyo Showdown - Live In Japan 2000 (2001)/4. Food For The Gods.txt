Shame marries the guilt
introduces itself to the
concept of total loneliness
Sensations repressed
make friends with
Suicidia and
here the leeches begin to
suck away the lust for life

Thus
Escape takes lead
into a world unknown uncontrolled by all
where border are erased and potential infinite
Chosen cells glands and transmitters
blast the body with joy
Astral feet running
up to dimension covered with gold
stairs of glowing ectoplasma
safir onyx and buzzing vibrations
A dead man banquet
food for the gods

There's only 1 real world
our earth is but a shadow
Created from a child's heart a living jewel
from now on abode for a soul in its setting

Now
sutting the bloodline
re-tie the bleeding roots
to a heavenly ship of glass
and let it drift in passive arrogance
in a one-word dialogue with the stars
