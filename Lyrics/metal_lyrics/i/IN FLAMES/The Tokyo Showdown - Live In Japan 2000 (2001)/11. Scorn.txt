I parish and nobody will know
as my mouth remains still
my heart awaits me. filled with gravel
as the pain grows with each touch

since I marked her out from my tower
reality focused through forbidden lenses
she owns enough of preciousness
a penalty given by the source

but I still have no choice through
the hinderens frighten
a labyrinth closing at the edge of space

but they never allow
she's shut... for all beings but one
I give, I scorn, I threat
