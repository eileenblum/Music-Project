in your world, the day is no threat
in my world, there is an absence of light
"genetic superior cell" controlled
by the fathomless and unbearable

a radical new Form of plastic and rage
biologically optimized
but with a strangling pulse

in your world, you find me worthy
in my world, I "parashoot" my life
a virtual drugstore populated
by the fathomless and unbearable

machine, meat and blood
in an intimate relationship
the new - superior -
more effective than all the preceding

when we can no longer
cry and reality is torn
then it's easy to forget
that the responsibility lies on us all

in your world, the night is no threat
in my world, the darkness
transforms to a vision of hell
populated by fathomless and unbearable
