I can't tolerate your sadness
cause it's me you're drowning
I won't allow any happiness
cause everytime you laugh, I feel so guilty

"I blame the needs that you feed
cause selfish eyes would not see"

Am I forced to have any regret?
I've become the lie, beautiful and free
In my righteous own mind
I adore and preach the insanity you gave

Sell me the infection, it's only for the weak
No need for sympathy, the misery that is me
No need for sympathy, it's only for the weak)
On bleeding knees I accept my fate

I've lost the ability to paint the clouds
cause it's me you're draining
I'm stuck in this slow-motion dark day
cause everytime you run, I fall behind

"Far away is a place where I hide
the truth that have to be locked away"

And so I hear my voice again
The tale of the bitter man, here I am
Shake the silence and hear what it says
The tranquil pride that become the lie
