Tried of dull ages, I walk the same ground,
Collecting the tragedies still
Hollow ambitions in a hollow mind
Carried my cross to the hill

And how I lust for the dance and the fire
Ceep of the nectarine sunset to drink
Spill me the wind and its fire
To steal of the colors

Shattered hope became my guide
And grief and pain my friends
A brother pact in a blood-ink penned
Declare my silent end

Naked an dying under worlds of silent stone
Reaching for the moonshield that once upon us shone

Naked and dying under worlds of silent stone
reaching for the moonshield that once upon us shone

And how I lust for the dance and the fire
deep of the nectarine sunset to drink
spill me the wind and its fire
to steal of the colors

I am... I am...
I'm the moonshield
