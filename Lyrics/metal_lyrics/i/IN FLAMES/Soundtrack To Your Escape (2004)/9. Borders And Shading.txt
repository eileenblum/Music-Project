You take a knife and carve it in
Want to see your faults
As a part of your pretty skin
Everyone has a tragedy
I want you to wear yours in pain

Oblivion can no longer shade you
Reminded by the tattered tissue

Bleak silence
Errors stigmatized in you
A weak worn out friend
There's nothing left for me

Again and again
Your face reminds me of a bleak future
Despite the absence of hope
I give you this sacrifice

You're so far, behind
Be my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
'Cause I look the other way

I will crawl into your vault
Pass snakes and old rotten thoughts
Leaving a hotbed of virulence
Your world inside slowly redesigned

Again and again
Your face reminds me of a bleak future
Despite the absence of hope
I give you this sacrifice

You're so far, behind
Be my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
'Cause I look the other way

Again and again
Your face reminds me of a bleak future
Despite the absence of hope
I give you this sacrifice

You're so far, behind
Be my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
'Cause I look the other way

You're so far, behind
Be my hero
Drift away
Save yourself
Don't end up zero
'Cause I look the other way
Save yourself
