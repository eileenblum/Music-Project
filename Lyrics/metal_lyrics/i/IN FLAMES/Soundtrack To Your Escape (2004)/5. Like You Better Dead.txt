I can be as angry as I want to be
Just watch me burn
I think you're way too cold
Just watch and learn

I'll never sleep here anymore
My house is not my home
I like you better dead
And I'm better off alone

Destiny, will you cure me?
Trust, will you age with me?
Hear me scream
Destiny, will you cure me?
Hear me scream as I face tomorrow

Your vision may be in colour, but you look all pale
In these times we should be learning, but with you I'll always fail

Destiny, will you cure me?
Trust, will you age with me?
Hear me scream
Destiny, will you cure me?
Hear me scream as I face tomorrow

I need to save myself before I drown
It took so long to see
The world your mind creates
It pushes me under

Destiny, will you cure me?
Trust, will you age with me?
Hear me scream
Destiny, will you cure me?
Hear me scream as I face tomorrow
