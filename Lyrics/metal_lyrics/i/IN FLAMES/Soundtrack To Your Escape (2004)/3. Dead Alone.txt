I'll always belong to the shadow
Don't show me new results
I will never enter your heaven
Make the most of my dirty cell

Creeps infected by control
That's what put me in here
Dig deep don't think you ever get to the place where they buried me
The last glimpse that I had
Fragments, pieces of some things valuable
Even though it doesn't make sense anymore
I release my last fear

[Chorus:]
The cold worms and me
We're alone and free
The dead light inside
Fuel to new seed
We're alone and free

When there are only my bones
Please put them in use
Want to be part of a new dawn
The darkness disappears
Don't release these chains
Never been closer to myself
All your mistakes run though
As I realize what we become
The end is here to bid farewell
I'll turn to ash and hear them sing
Songs about my emotions dead and alone
Don't make an effort you don't know me anyway

My frustration, my conversation, why are we even here?
The abuse that we use I do not longer care

[Chorus]
