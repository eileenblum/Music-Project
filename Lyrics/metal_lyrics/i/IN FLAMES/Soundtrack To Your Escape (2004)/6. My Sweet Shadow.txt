I'm selling heavenly sketches
A world out of my mind
Ready to explode in purity to fill the holes inside

An ever moving stream with glowing rays of light
Emotions tied to pass lies and I know I should let go

Tamed with confidence of a brighter future

I found a flame in the burnt out ashes... burn out, burn out!

Fueled, these new shores burn, dark past lies cold
Shadow, my sweet shadow, to you I look no more

Another dawn collapses
Do I need to be reminded
A glimpse of my safe home
A path to hide all anger

I found a flame in the burnt out ashes... burn out, burn out!

Fueled, these new shores burn, dark past lies cold
Shadow, my sweet shadow, to you I look no more

In circles I catch
A torch carried by the immortal
From depths that I created
In vain echoes fade

Burn out!

Fueled, these new shores burn, dark past lies cold
Shadow, my sweet shadow, to you I look no more

Fueled, these new shores burn, dark past lies cold
Shadow, my sweet shadow, to you I look no more

Fueled, Dark past lies cold
For you I look no more
