Could it be a new day?
Fear in me so deep
You push me out, I feel far
The absence, close to me
The other side I crawl
You push me out, I fall

Heal my wounds, take everything away,
You convocate me
Sick of cycles, drop to zero
A while just like last times
My least favorite re-run
Sick of cycles, I bounce in gray

Escape familiar home
Memories remains alone
Reality trapped inside
The wicked descend

Testing higher mentality
I conquer myself through this
A furious path to walk
New space exists beyond
In silence I dwell displeased
Remain with the seed of unfulfilment

Heal my wounds, take everything away,
You convocate me
Sick of cycles, drop to zero
A while just like last times
My least favorite re-run
Sick of cycles, I bounce in gray

Escape familiar home
Memories remains alone
Reality trapped inside
The wicked descend - I hide

Heal my wounds, take everything away,
You convocate me
Sick of cycles, drop to zero
A while just like last times
My least favorite re-run
Sick of cycles, I bounce in gray

Escape familiar home
Memories remains alone
Reality trapped inside
The wicked descend - I hide

Escape familiar home
Memories remains alone
Reality trapped inside
The wicked descend - I hide
