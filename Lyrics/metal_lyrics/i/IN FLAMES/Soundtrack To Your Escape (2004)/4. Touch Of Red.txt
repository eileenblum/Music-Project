Reaching depth of clarity
I'm not supposed to be like this
I should be on the top of the world
Is anybody out there like me?

I followed something's missing
Self control Forcing me down
Whispers consume the air
Above her I'm endless

When the rain comes falling
I'll freeze I'm so afraid
When things start to flood me
I will drown in seconds

Fear - There's no way out
Touch of red
Break away
Nothing has it all
Bury the place I've been
I fear there's no way out

As If I ever had a choice
All in the hands of the energy
Once again feel the quicksand swallow me
Tonight = I won't struggle

Fear - There's no way out
Touch of red
Break away
Nothing has it all
Bury the place I've been
I fear there's no way out

The weak in me should know I'm as sober as I could be

Fear - There's no way out
Touch of red
Break away
Nothing has it all
Bury the place I've been
I fear there's no way out
