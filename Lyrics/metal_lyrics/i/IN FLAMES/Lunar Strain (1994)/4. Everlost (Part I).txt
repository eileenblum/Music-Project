Lights are dim
My tearful windows
Through wich no emotions pass
Starvation of senses claws my soul

Answer me
Are these walls my only shelter
From the bleeding atmosphere
Take me from this land

"I deliver thee from this agony
A storm to cleanse thee"

Mine is the right to be
Maelstrom of the everlost
This is the curse of ...

All is dark
All but one aspect of life
To be shaceled
In a shell, so misleading

"These are the shells bestowed upon me"
Pass into the darkened of the midnight
Sounds, faceless lights

Hands tear apart
Disolve possess
You alone can take my soul
Take flight
