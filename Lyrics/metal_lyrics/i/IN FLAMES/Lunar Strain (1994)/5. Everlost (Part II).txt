Through seven songs of rejoice
His name relives his solar voice

Falling into the unknown
Yet he shall feel no harm

Lights shine upon his face
Night exists no longer

In unknown colours they confront him
In soundless tounge they speak is name
Moonred - reaching for life through eternity
Starblack - the brooding silence is frightening me

One elderly custom in timeless guise
In ceremonies of old one, dove now flies
Fly through time
