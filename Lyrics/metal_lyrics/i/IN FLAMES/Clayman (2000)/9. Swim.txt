As we build a brand new planet
Let's reconstruct and get it straight

Unlock forgotten skills
Travel to a new dimension
Solace from the dark seduction
(Take heed) we are the new invention

We're the settlers of year zero
Let's reconstruct and take it back

Leaders of our time
Heading for a downfall
The threshold of revolution
(Take heed) the last freedom call

Blanked out fire etched on the crystal display
The sees are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb
Collect the word, add some gold and give it back
The sees are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb

From a thousand branches
Spreading the new voice

As we're heading for the throne
Connect, evolution will begin
