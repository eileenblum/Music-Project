[NO FUN AT ALL cover song]

One lie was all it took everything ended right there
You didn't seem to care One lie
I walked away weight on my shoulders was heavy
Barrel to my head

Will you give me a good excuse
Will you let me die right here and now ?
I can't think of another way
But I'm open to any good advice
Everything is falling apart
Trying hard to be strong and smart

One day was all it took
Start to get back on my feet heart begin to beat
One week I'm feeling great dancing around in the street
Feeling young and free

Will you give me a good excuse
Will you let me die right here and now ?
I can't think of another way
But I'm open to any good advice
Everything is falling apart
Trying hard to be strong and smart
