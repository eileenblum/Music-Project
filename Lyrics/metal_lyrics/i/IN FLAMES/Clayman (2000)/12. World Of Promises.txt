[TREAT COVER SONG]

They come from a land were the sun don't shine
running away from the cold
They travel so far in the name of love
hoping the dreams will come true

Walking the way through endless fields
trying to make it together
Troubled within ever sinking kiss
Just like the full to fall in love
And they will give anything
just to be free from the pain
and they won't surrender

Living in a world of promises
Living in a world of dreams and hopes
Living in a world of promises

Lost in the city wondering why
no one will open the door
It's more to the truth than meets the eye
something they all felt before
And they will give anything
just to stand tall once again
and they won't surrender

Living in a world of promises
Living in a world of dreams and hopes
Living in a world of promises

In the tan of the nigh can hear them crying
out for a life to hol on to
Somebody knows were the answers lying
wait for your trails and don't let go

Living in a world of promises
Living in a world of dreams and hopes
Living in a world of promises
