[Verse:]

You stole my pure intention
You are the sickness in between
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You taught me to be sad at you
You almost made me take it all
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You bend me and you shake me
You beg me then you break me
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

You made me feel like a sinner
Now you fear you'll die alone
Let me in, I'll bury the pain

[Chorus:]

The sickness that you are
The plague that made me starve
You think you can show me how I've come this far

I feel it's taking over
Everything falls dark
Break me open
The desperate cry
