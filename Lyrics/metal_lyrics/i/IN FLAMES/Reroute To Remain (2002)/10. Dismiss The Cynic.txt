[Verse:]

Will we find a solution
When we add all the numbers?
Like they are supposed to be?
But no is close... Start all over!

If we fail our expectations
We will fall into the deepest void
Is there a limit to how many times
We will dust ourselves off?

[Chorus:]

The mystery of time
Listen to me, carefully
The mystery of time
It's you and me
That's all we need

[Verse:]

Would you choose supremacy
If it led to isolation?
Could you handle the solitude?
Would you still prefer the throne?
