[Verse:]

The thoughts of yesterday forgotten
I like the way this new skin feels
Bring me splinters of tomorrow
Collect the parts where I win

[Chorus:]

Against the grain
Against the odds
I'll rise and I won't trip again
The dawn of a new day never looked
As good as this

[Verse:]

Concrete breath and dust filled tears
A one way ride to inner peace
I never thought I'd join the others
Those who use the dice to solve
