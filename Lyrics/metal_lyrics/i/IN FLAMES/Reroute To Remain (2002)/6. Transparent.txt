Consume all the obscene
Persuade the most hideous and ugly
Under every pile and stone
A rebirth, for you to find

Freedom is to be able
To go in any direction
So take the uncertain path

[Pre-Chorus:]

One foot in the open
Ten feet ahead
Build your own ladder
And don't lie to yourself

[Chorus:]

Secrets left above the grave (It's not for one to keep)
You're all so self destructive
Spend more time with the broken (see what became of their mistake)
You know you're lost when you feel transparent

[Verse:]

Be at one with the wind
Even if it's a struggle
Make this your priority

Open all your senses
To new impressions
Act like all that was has vanished
