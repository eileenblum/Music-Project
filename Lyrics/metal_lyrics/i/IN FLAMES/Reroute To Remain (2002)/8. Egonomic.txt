[Verse:]

A mass illusion
Blind men in a line
They smother their fires with gasoline

A stranger's contribution
Everybody's on the run
No clue where they are heading

A spineless attempt
Have we lost it completely?
It always ends up in a mess

[Chorus:]

A liar's ambition
Praised like a king
Every day in every way
We are getting weaker

You won't go far
With the life that you're living
Every day in every way
We are getting weaker

[Verse:]

Slow and calculated
Afraid of the sleeping
We'll never ever reach the goal
