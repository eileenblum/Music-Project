[Verse:]

Drug me, infiltrate my never land
Like the floodtide drowning the shore

Drug me, you're all over me
Watch my blood begin to boil

I love that lullaby
Start me up again
Electric spine
Open mind

[Pre Chorus:]

I leave you, negative behind
Watch me all in flames, on a butterfly I ride

[Chorus:]

Inhale the light
Relax for some time
The world outside stays numb tonight
Free your mind express the forgotten
The world inside is yours tonight

[Verse:]

Please me, deliver the insane
In the chaos I find peace

Please me, remind the gods of my name
I believe there is one seat left for me
