[Verse:]
People like you
You live in a dream world
You despise the outside
And you fear the next one

It's in your dream
There's just one question
Should I kill?
Or should I be left behind?

Sick and tired
Of all your complaints
This is the hour
We bring it down

[Chorus:]
I've come to realize
Every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected, cloud connected

[Verse:]
You seem to be
So introverted
How come we fail?
With all that is given?

You crossed the line
You remembered my name
Time runs backwards
As we're heading that way
