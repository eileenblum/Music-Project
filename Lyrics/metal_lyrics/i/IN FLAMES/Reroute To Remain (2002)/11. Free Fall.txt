[Verse:]

Mirror Mirror
How far will I go?
Despite the foundation I am falling
Sweet reflection
Will you save a place for me?

Where am I heading?
Could you grant me a haven?
For what?
I am punished could I ever repent?

Mother Nature, I'm wide open
Waiting for you to move me

Don't keep it from me
This is a free fall

[Chorus:]

I never seem to understand
The time, the place and who I am
Define a way to stay alive
It's like I'm living a lie

[Verse:]

Father time every time I stop and feel
You're there to tell me I'm already late
