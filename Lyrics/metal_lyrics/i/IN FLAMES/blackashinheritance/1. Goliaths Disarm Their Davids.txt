Bible arm on social hell
Spins its downward spiral
With each year of unprogression
A fine of failure is added
Closer than ever to the edge
A feat in resident martyrs
Strong objects track my body, 
My body down

Eyes, disappearing rebirth of light...
Between a labrynth of errors
And the key to the suicide era
Digging through the graves of giants
Words fly to me
A lonely road, like a promise
Failing miserably
Running through like an alphabet of hate
To shake the entire organism closer than ever,
Ever to the edge

Eyes, disappearing rebirth of light...
Between a labrynth of errors
And the key to the suicide era

I kill for the code to disarm this mess
Of psychotic chaos that once I mixed up myself

Disarm
