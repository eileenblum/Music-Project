Once dead his father
He closed family business
Cooking tacos and burritos
Was not his way of life

He took from an old chest
His six-shoot deathbringer
And wearing his poncho
had a fate to find.

He joined a band of raiders
Which were going to the north.
Through forests, across valleys
Plundering and forth.

Cruel and showing no mercy,
soon He became known.
The man who came from southlands
was striking on and on.

One day while He was sleeping
a poor fool tried to rob him
And before he'd even cried
His hands lay on the floor

So in retaliation
He went one by one
to the members of the band
cutting off their hands

[CHORUS]

Heâs a stranger where he goes.
He's been wandering alone.
Now his time's about to come.
Death and glory shall be known.

Finally He came up
to a little town in forest.
And in secret with the Dark Gods
He made his twisted deal.

So falling into madness,
thirsty of death and pain,
He slayed all the peasants
and ate their bloody entrails.

No one will ever know
What happened that day.
The deal that he had done
He carried with him to his grave.
