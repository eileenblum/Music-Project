The night weaves the land
A thunder tears the loom of life
A ripper scream lights up the dark
The serpent has born, born from wrath.

Surrounding Midgard, the world of man
the snake bites its tail with venomous fangs
awaiting the moment when Gjallarhorn sounds
JÃ¶rmungandr prepares for RagnarÃ¶k time

Thrown to the sea by Oden (JÃ¶rmungandr)
It will poison the skies
Awaiting the day (JÃ¶rmungandr)
To take itâs revenge
(JÃ¶rmungandr)

Wake up, oh mighty snake!
A dark age of death has just arrived.
Thor awaits 'cause this fight
will make both reach your fate.

Poisonous skies, fire and hail.
Blood poured in the sea as Thor,
Thunder God, kills the snake
and dies after just nine steps.
