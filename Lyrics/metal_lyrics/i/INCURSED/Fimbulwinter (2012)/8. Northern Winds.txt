Fimbulwinter yet to come
A dark age has just begun
Northern winds starting to blow
there's no chance to avoid the cold

Pine trees bend as golden straw
Mountains freeze with falling snow
Hail and ice will follow soon
dictated march by pale blue moon

You feel your heart becoming older
Look outside, it's getting colder
Stay at home near by your fire
Trying to impede the gods' desire

But there's no escape, no looking back
When Loki's son growls in the dark
Mighty winter has arrived
Northern winds of darkened, freezing hands...

Our land is scorched by the impressive cold
Rotting carcass of the dreams we once rode
Remains we left from defeated foes
Are now the future of our condemned souls.

An age of axes, an age of swords,
of shields destroyed and fratricidal wars.
An era of winds, an era of wolves,
It's the prelude for the RagnarÃ¶k
