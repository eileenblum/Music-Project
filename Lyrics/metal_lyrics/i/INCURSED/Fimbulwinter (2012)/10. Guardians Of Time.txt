Obscure times, continual war,
Destroyed towns, greed and pride.
Gods destined for oblivion,
Asking for help to the guardians of time.

Superior beings looking down on mankind,
Counting your days, judging your life.
No way to escape to the look of their eyes,
No sword can stop the edge of their scythes.

Superior beings looking down on mankind,
Witnesses of a sinister past.
When mortals, lost, looked for a guide,
They had to take the guardians on trust.

Guardians of time!

Faithful times, lands of hope,
Guardians' promise, a better world.
Gods destined for oblivion,
Asking for help to the guardians of time.

The guardians of time!
Judging your life!

Crossing the night,
As a forest guided by thunderlight.
Lightning can't wait,
So ride through the stars.

And the rivers of time,
Dyed by blood
Of the ones who once tried
To beat us in war.
We're guardians of Time
