Dark is everything
Cold and fire surrounding it all
Flames melting ice
A battle that has to finish at all

Frozen emptiness
Ginnungagap is just a deep, black hole
Burning darkness
Life takes form when the hot meets the cold

There is Niflheim
Valleys and mountains are made of no stone
There is Muspelheim
Rivers of magma destroying the whole

Frost giving him life
He was born from
Heat, filling the air
Now he has taken form

Ymer the giant
First living creature, born from the snow
Horrible fate
Betrayed and beheaded by (the) children of Bor

That's the beginning
Fighting for life, absence of love
Violence and nonsense
From dark to light, from nothing to all

That's our story
Ginnungagap hole is our hole
Snow and fire
Creators of our own

Of our own

That's our story
Ginnungagap hole is our hole
Snow and fire
Creators of our own
