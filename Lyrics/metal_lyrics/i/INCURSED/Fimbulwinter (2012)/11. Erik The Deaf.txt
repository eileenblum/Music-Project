There's an old man, here in town
Maybe you have seen him
But don't you try, even too loud
He'll not answer the yelling

He shows up he's bored with a huge snore
He's paying no attention!
Who could be this old man
that has just fallen asleep?

Grandma says that he was brave
strong, kind and sexy.
Won a fight with only bare hands,
enemies were at least sixty!

Calm the storm, tame the seas,
take the dog for a walk.
He could do anything.
Anything he wanted

Uncork a bottle in his name, hooray! Hooray!
Uncork a bottle in his name, hooray! Hooray!
Uncork a bottle in his name, rum, whiskey, it's all the same!
'Cause tonight we're drinking and drinking and drinking and drinking and drinking again!

Remember what we're drinking for, hooray! Hooray!
Remember what we're drinking for, hooray! Hooray!
Remember what we're drinking for, so drink and drink and drink some more!
Til we lie on the ground, drunken and proud of what we have become.

He discovered Vinland,
well, he and some of his friends.
A place with great resources:
Hops, malt and also wine grapes.

They brewed a lot, A LOT of drinks
-Alcoholic type-
And when they finished drank them
To see what tasted like.

So next day when he got up
He had hangover so great
that burped as loud and fiercely
That became completely deaf

Now that you know the story
and why he cannot hear,
You must hail Erik the Deaf
The viking with no ears!
