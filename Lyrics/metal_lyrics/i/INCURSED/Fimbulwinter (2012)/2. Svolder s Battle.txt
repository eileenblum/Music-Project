Would you like to hear my song?
Would you believe my words?
About king Olaf Tryggvason,
the subject of this song.

[Refrain:]
Dance resounds in the halls,
Dance! â Form a ring.
Brave Norwegians ride
to Hildurâs thing.

The king had a vessel built
on the level sand.
The Serpent was the largest ship
built on Norwegian lands.

[Refrain]

Eric left the sandy beach,
ran down to the pier:
âBe prepared to leave the beach
the Serpent is now here!â

[Refrain]

They all saw the Serpent come
sailing proud and bold.
The rigging was a sail of silk,
the bows were made of gold.

[Refrain]

Wolf the Red stood in the bows,
he never got it wrong:
âDonât shoot the ship to much ahead,
the Serpent is too longâ.

[Refrain]

King Olaf stood up in the stern
staring back and forth:
âWho owns all these mighty ships
steering at our port?â

[Refrain]

Herning looks out on the ships,
answers to his call:
âThey belong to Eric the Earl,
the bravest of them allâ

[Refrain]

The king of Denmark stormed ahead
convinced that he could win.
Norwegians, they fought so hard!
the Danish lines were thin.

[Refrain]

Smoke raised from fighting men,
blood poured in the sea.
It turned out that all the Danes
had to back and flee.

[Refrain]

Eric jumped onboard the Serpent
with his sword in hand.
Herning rushed down from the stern,
med him with his brand.

[Refrain]

The king shouted from the stern,
through the noise and rattle:
âJump into the sea, my men!
We have lost this battleâ

[Refrain]

Then the king and all his men,
-although brave and bold-
jumped into the salty sea,
they did as they were told.

[Refrain]
