Here I stand again
I am back to my yearned land
Memories embrace me, I realize
I should never have left

Morning comes at last
All these years have gone by so fast
And it scares me
But Iâll stand here âtil the day I die

Sun is rising now
itâs given birth by the mountains
wind blows cold as ice
but I can feel the fire in my heart

I was eager to run,
along these vast northern lands,
but Iâm not longer young,
itâs not long before my time has come

From time to time, from land to land
it was told (that) this place was paradise
now (that) I stand at this ground so dank
Iâm so proud to call this âmy homelandâ

There was a time when I was strong and brave
but my fate now takes me to the grave

From time to time, from land to land
it was told (that) this place was paradise
now (that) I stand at this ground so dank
Iâm so proud to call this âmy homelandâ
