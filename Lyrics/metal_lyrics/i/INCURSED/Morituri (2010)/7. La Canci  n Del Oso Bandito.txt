The tavern was full of whores 
In the holy harvest festival 
But I was so drunk that 
I could not think about fucking. 

I went into the woods 
To have fresh air and clear my mind 
And suddenly it was there, 
A bear hidden in a bush 

Fight against a bear 
Thereâs no sword or spear 
To bring away your fear 

Fight against the beast 
Itâs a real risk 
Claw versus fist 

Fight against a bear 
Fight against a big bear 
Fight against a beast 

Fight against a bear 
Fight against a big bear 
Fight against a beast 

Uuh! Said the bear 
Aah! I screamed in despair 
Uuh! Said the bear 
Aah! 

Instead of run or fight 
I just give the bear my vodka 
And instead of kill or growl 
It happily starts to drink 

And then the bear got drunk 
And we started to dance 
Villagers think Iâve gone mad 
But now I have a new friend 

Drinking with the bear 
Dancing with the bear 
Speaking with the bear 

Playing with the bear 
Driving with the bear 
Eating with the bear 

Hunting with the bear 
Shopping with the bear Bear 
Partying with the bear 

Disco with the bear 
Going out for girls girls 
With my friend the bear 

Graor!
