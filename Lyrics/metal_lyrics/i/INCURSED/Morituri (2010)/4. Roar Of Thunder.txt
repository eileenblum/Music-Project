We arrive to the coast, leave the boats on the sand, 
We unsheathe our swords and go into the land 
With Odenâs guidance, we find a town, 
Night marches with us, weâre ready to attack 

Roar of thunder sounds my sword 
Bolts of lightning flash my blade 
Death strikes you as a storm 
Blood splashes as rain 

We find the secret place, 
Where women and children are hiding away 
We rape and kill, and then we rape again 
Smoke covers the moon, but our guide lights are the flames 
We take the children with us, theyâll be our new slaves 

God of thunder makes me strong 
Lines of lightning guide my blade 
Death strikes you as a storm 
Gods have fear when we approach 

Roar of thunder sounds my sword 
Bolts of lightning flash my blade 
Death strikes you as a storm 
Blood splashes as rain 

God of thunder makes me strong 
Lines of lightning guide my blade 
Death strikes you as a storm 
Gods have fear when we approach
