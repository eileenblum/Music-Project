If you give a gold coin, 
Or your girl gives me a kiss... 
Barman: bring me a beer! 
I will play my violin! 

You all know my song, 
I want you to sing. 
With some beers, 
I will get drunk 
And play my violin! 

I jump on the table, 
I want you to dance 
And sing, and fight, 
And drink, and yell, 
I'll play my violin! 

If you give a gold coin, 
Or your girl gives me a kiss... 
I will jump on the table 
And I'll play my violin!
