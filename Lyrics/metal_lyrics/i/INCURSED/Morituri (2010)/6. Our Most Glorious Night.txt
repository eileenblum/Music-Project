Fury of the gods 
Becoming a storm 
They think our end approaches 
But they are wrong 

In a massive way 
The enemies come 
But we all are strong 
Our arms are like stone 

The sun goes down and the moon is hidden 
Behind the dust made by our soldiers 
Walls are stained because of blood spatters 
We shout in rage but pain makes them cry louder 

This is our most glorious night! 
Enemy hordes have fallen! 
All of those who have arrived 
Will be decimated by our axes! 

And tonight we will feast and drink blood 
In handmade cups carved out in your skulls 
Your corpses will feed the fire to cook our food 
And then we will dance around you! 

And tonight we will feast, and drink blood 
In handmade cups carved out in your skulls 
Your corpses will feed the fire to cook our food 
And then we will dance around you! 

This is our most glorious night! 
Enemy hordes have fallen! 
All of those who have arrived 
Will be decimated by our axes!
