We head up to their castle 
We see their houses burn 
The time has come to raise our swords 
The siege has just begun 

The countless corpses we leave 
Feed our blind desire 
On wings of rage weâll take their lives 
Theyâll fail against this trial 

Might reigns in this battle 
Their futureâs bound to death 
We will not rest until we see 
Theyâre taking their last breath 

The nightâs about to fall 
Blood dyes the sky in red 
We approach our aim, our final goal 
The struggleâs soon to end 

Ours is victory 
But friends have fallen down 
Theyâll rest in peace forever 
Our tears now hit the ground
