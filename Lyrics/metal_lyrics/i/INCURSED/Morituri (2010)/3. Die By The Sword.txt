We have readen in the Runes 
Which Oden gave to us 
After nine days hanging from the Tree 
Our fate is written 
And we cannot avoid 
Dying in the battle and be free 

So let the march of time begin 
Facing to the end 
Fight with pride and honour, raise your fist 
Free your rage, 
Let it fill your heart 
And tonight in Valhall we will feast. 

We will die by the sword, 
Thatâs an honour to the warriors from the north 
We profess the religion 
Of the glory by our own 
Thereâs no oblivion 
For those who are brave 
There will be no remembrance 
On the cowardâs graves 

Sea is roaring, wind is blowing 
Storm is bursting now 
God of seas is calling for our death 

Sea is roaring, wind is blowing 
Storm is bursting now 
God of seas is calling for our death 

So let the march of time begin 
Facing to the end 
Fight with pride and honour, raise your fist 
Free your rage, 
Let it fill your heart 
And tonight in Valhall we will feast. 

We will die by the sea 
Thatâs a proof that all the seamen have to pass 
If we want to defy the gods, 
Discover a new land 
All the brave will be swallowed by the storm 
And the cowards will be starving at their home 

We will die by the sword, 
Thatâs an honour to the warriors from the north 
We profess the religion 
Of the glory by our own 
Thereâs no oblivion 
For those who are brave 
There will be no remembrance 
On the cowardâs graves
