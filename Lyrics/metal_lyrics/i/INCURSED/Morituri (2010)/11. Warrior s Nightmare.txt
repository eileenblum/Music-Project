Blood is boiling 
In my veins tonight, 
In this battle Iâll die. 
Blinded by blood, 
Which covers my eyes, 
Tormented by savagery. 

Death Is breathing 
In my face, 
But this is not the end. 
Poisoned arrows 
In my chest, 
Do not weaken me yet. 

I run into battle, 
I look at their eyes and yell 
But my voice gone hoarsed 
Overcome with fear 
I strike, 
Trying for survive. 

Donât know why Iâm fighting for, 
Just for keeping my life. 
And all around my fallen friends, 
It looks like... 

...My worst nightmare 
Iâd never thought, but now isnât a dream. 
My worst nightmare, 
Iâd never thought could be something like this. 

Finally poison attacks my heart, 
I see my soul, 
Scaping through my mouth. 
I stagger along 
The battlefield, 
Trying not to fall. 

Steel impedes my walk, 
My leg has gone, 
I fall down, 
Crying, I bleed till I die, die, die!
