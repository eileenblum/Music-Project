Wild galloping horses, 
On green 
Vast sunny meadows. 
Lakes in harmony 
With the skies: pale blue 

Forest, peaceful and proud 
Trees, ancient 
And hundred metres tall 

Wild galloping horses, 
On green 
Vast sunny meadows. 
Lakes in harmony 
With the skies: pale blue 

Forest, peaceful and proud 
Trees, ancient 
And thousand years old
