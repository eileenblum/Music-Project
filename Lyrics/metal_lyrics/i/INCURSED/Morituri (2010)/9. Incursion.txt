Bow, arrow, narrow spear, 
Sword and shield, have no fear, 
Into battle kill with rage, 
They won't see another day. 

We are vikings, we are strong, 
We, the vikings, kill your sons. 
"Guide us Oden!", we all pray, 
Blood is flowing on our blades. 

Sailing in our longships, 
Sailing over raging seas, 
Landing in the morning, 
Your peaceful village 
Is the battlefield. 

Bow, arrow, narrow spear, 
Sword and shield, have no fear, 
"Guide us Oden!", we all pray, 
Blood is flowing on our blades.
