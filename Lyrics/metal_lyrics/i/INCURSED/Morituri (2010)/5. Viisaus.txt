Among the forest of my forefathers 
I teach the runes to my descendants 
The circle has finally closed 
Our aternal knowledge has passed 
From time to time, from land to land 
By generations who did understand itâs power 
They never got lost 
They were guided by the gods 

As we grew in number we had to fight 
Against the ire of Mother Earth 
But wisdom kept us alive 
Thatâs the reason why I 
Tell you the secrets to control 
The forces of nature all 
The secrets to sail the seas 
The secrets to set your soul free 

Set it free! 

Tuli, tuuli, vesi 
Maa, sota, veri 
Viisaus... 

Fire! Wind! Water! 
Earth! War! Blood! 
Viisaus! 

As you hear this words keep them well 
Deep into your mind 
Theyâll be helpful in your way, 
Follow them till the end 
Of your life, and be remembered 
Because of who you are 
No tears were spilled to the ones 
Who left their men behind...
