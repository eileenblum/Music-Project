Can you hear the whispers of the night?
The witch master has pronounced the words
Winds blow black, the walls have cracked
Might and magic reclaim command

"Climb the mountain and light the fire,
lunacy will conquer your minds tonight!"

The trees are laughing with naughty smiles
Strangers are welcome, common sense is not
No place for judgment, no place for wrath
If you are squeamish, please stay at home

"Fear not, my friends, join us now,
take off your rags, we will rape your souls!"

We will find our fate in the nights of Anboto
Dancing mad around the flames
Fly through the stars, show your shames tonight
And the gods will sing our names

AKELARRE!!!

We will find our fate in the nights of Anboto...
