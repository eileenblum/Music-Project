A cage as high as a mountain imprisons our will to fly
These tyrants who claim to be our gods have ruled our world
Shelters raised in hell, lives stirred in blood
We signed the pact, yet we're the ones to pay for all

Deep in the sewers of your mind
Rotten indolence is in command
The purge is now

Oppression makes the spark that ignites the flames
Reprisal is set to take place, all in due time
Anchored we lived but made up our minds
Rather than to kneel, we're determined to die

Far from our roots we raised up these walls
Baptized in pride, we fight side by side
In unity we stand to defend our homeland
We're brothers in arms, don't dare to face us

"Take this place, and burn them all!"
Don't spare their lives, they killed your sons
"Pity is not an option, recall their deceits!"
We're feeling this, we're living this

Far from our roots we raised up these walls...
