Hungry vultures fly above the landscape
The scent of fresh blood imbues the fields
Forests and lakes replaced by flesh and bones
The price of war has placed its expensive bill

Wrath oppresses within my elder veins
While flames scorch the house I once built
The deafening cries of the ones who passed away
Shall not stop the storm I swear to unleash

This endless maze I chose to walk
is blurred, in black and white
A myriad of childish dreams
lost in the sands of time
The harvest of a lifetime is always reaped in full

I shed my blood to save these lands
You will not take them from me
Once I could die to soothe your grief
But now it's time to set it free

Plagues never cease to fall upon our home
The flags we hold have digged our graves
Treason is carved deep in the skin of men
Only their sins remain left to embrace
