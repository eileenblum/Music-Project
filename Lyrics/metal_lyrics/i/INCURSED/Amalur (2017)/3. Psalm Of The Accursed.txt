Imperishable, unconquerable
chained forever to be unborn
we exist beyond your hopes
soon we will rise to claim your world

Rise! Reign! Fall!
Bloom! Live! Rot!
Rise! Reign! Fall!
Beat! Rule! Fade!

The unfathomable greed became complete
the sons of our forefathers atoned their sins
we wrongly judged them by old beliefs
despite of your oppression
untamed we will remain

An epitaph made of flesh
bearing with the misery of the past
hiding the horror from its depth
behind a faÃ§ade of fragile glass
of fragile glass

This is the song of anguish
taught by the demons from below
once forlorn by justice
cursed to be the bearers of your oath

A path through oneiric woods of dreams
to drift from life that's plagued with pain
for those who trust their joy to hate
shall only find relief in death

This is the song of anguish...
