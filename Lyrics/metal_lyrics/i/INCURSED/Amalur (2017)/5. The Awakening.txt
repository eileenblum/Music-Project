Like diving into a starless night
rises the march of hollow hearts
We foresaw the evil in their acts
although their words deceived them all

Behold my scars, I've been betrayed
these seeds I once bred are dead for me
this inner pit was filled with deceit
those I cared for won't see the light of day

Swallowed and wrecked by my own hell
I shall return, so wait for me

Feeble pulses pump this expiring heart
Life unleashed from a useless shell
The gates were sealed to feelings to reveal
but now our eyes are open wide

The grand design that we were told
Has been replaced by empty words
The firework show will turn to void
Our greed becomes the chasm of loss

Within the storm, I found my place
Where I could stand, through all the blaze

After the winter's sleep comes out the sun
The night was harsh and long while we were enshrined
Here comes the awakening, so brace yourselves
The fire is burning out, but our light will shine

Swallowed and wrecked by my own hell
I shall return, so wait for me
Within the storm, I found my place
Where I could stand, through all the blaze
