The king in a foreign land
had built his children's nest
throughout the years and wars
we shared the scars and swords

Slaughtered was our home
though blood bonds still were strong
we'd become the light beyond the veil of stars

I stared at her gaze
and saw my children's face
that night I swore in joy
my thoughts would be for her

A fortnight in your bed
was heaven brought to earth
the wounds that paint our skin
had quelled our hopes within

Look beyond your eyes
what else is to be done?
Will you save the world?
Or will you save yourself?

Refrain from living blind
and jump into the unknown
the times that pass you by
are not meant to return

I looked at my queen
and saw my children's dreams
with no time for relief
I stood and left my realm

I grabbed my handmade pouch
with memories once forlorn
their cries made me look back
like stabwounds through my spine

Look beyond your eyes...

I woke up old and stale
and saw my children's grave
by now my eyes are dry
so I must say goodbye

I will not cry for you
'cause that would hurt us both
you'll always be with me
after this one last breath
