One night I found two folks in a bar
Three chances to drink four beers in a streak
Five swords for the winner, six horses as well
Seven days gone, eight men failed before

I asked to take part in the contest
But nobody survived to this joke
I did not even care, to be honest
Four beers in a row... what a show!

Dead bodies are dancing alive
Beer is the fuel, forget all the rules
Still sober? You're doing it wrong
Swallow that ale, then do it again!

A wench came to me
With a tray full of jars
There's a smile in her face
and mad gaze in her eyes

Hesitations came first
But I'm stubborn to death
I will prove to these fools
That I was baptized in booze

Today has been hell
So now it's time to drink
To the bottom of this glass
I shall find some relief

I am losing control
Of my mind, flesh and bones
"Drink till you faint!
This round goes on the house"

Dead bodies are dancing alive...
