"Attention, passengers! The flight to the Carpathians is ready for take-off. Please, fasten your seatbelts, and enjoy the flight."

Europe goes quite wide from east to west
From the land of wine to the rivers of vodka
Today's time to party and set forth on a quest
Dancing in a trance to the sound of a polka

There is an only word to drive these Slavics mad!
ÐÐ°ÑÐ±Ð¸ÑÑ!
Metal and alcohol will feel as silk tonight!
ÐÐ°ÑÐ±Ð¸ÑÑ!

The time of truth is here tonight
You can fall back or join us now
Tomorrow might not come!

This mosh-pit has now become a battlefield
Remember to share your beer as if it was your shield
Our brothers shall rise again after they fall
There is no winners or losers, there's only laughs and fun!

There is an only word to drive these Slavics madâ¦

âAttention, passengers! Weâve now reached our destination. We hope you enjoyed the flight, and have a nice stay.â
