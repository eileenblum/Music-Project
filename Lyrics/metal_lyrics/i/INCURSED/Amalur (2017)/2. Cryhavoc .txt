We've come this far from distant lands
they say the plagues are spreading fast

These screen-faced dummies are so damn dumb
It's like a sect, a domino effect
Their mindless message will drive you mad
Beware of them, or you'll get trapped

We're the saviors when your friends run
You dream of us but call us thugs
Now move your ass, then grab your axe
and smash those parasites! Cryhavoc!

Rewards are not what we live for
But keep your pockets safe
For the sake of our fellows' paunch
You leave this place or die! Cryhavoc!

Moles tried to divide us from inside
But our secret code is sacrosanct

The luckiest one bled dry to death
We used his limbs to hang his friends
Some know us as the dogs of war
expect us soon, 'cause we will come

We're the saviors when your friends run...
