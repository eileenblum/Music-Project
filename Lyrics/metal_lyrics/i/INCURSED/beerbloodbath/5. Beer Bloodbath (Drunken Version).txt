Please let us give you a welcome
you are at the Beerbath Bar
we drench your throat and fill your belly
while the lasses get you warm

Inside the feast is getting heated
get close and choose your spot
ales are flowing, meat is roasting
fellows, this night will be everlasting

A giant barrel full of beer lies upon our heads
hours go by and golden jars feed our entrails
the gates knock down and foes are storming in
they have signed a contract for our butchery

Drunkenness is our weapon for this siege
our brothers have gone berserk
someone cut the ropes of the barrel in the ceiling
and all the hall is swimming in beer

We throw the tables off then grab our swords
flesh comes apart like sand
we're witnesses of bloody glory
and will rejoice on gods' delight

[Chorus]
Now they call it the Beer Bloodbath
that night was called the Beer Bloodbath
now they call it the Beer Bloodbath
that night was called the Beer Bloodbath
