We have readen in the Runes
which Oden gave to us
after nine days hanging from the Tree

Our fate is written
and we cannot avoid
dying in the battle and be free

So let the march of time begin facing to the end
fight with pride and honour, raise your fist
free your rage, let it fill your heart
and tonight in Valhall we will feast

We will die by the sword
thatâs an honour to the warriors from the north
we profess the religion of the glory by our own
thereâs no oblivion for those who are brave
there will be no remembrance on the cowardâs graves

Sea is roaring, wind is blowing
Storm is bursting now
God of seas is calling for our death

Sea is roaring, wind is blowing
Storm is bursting now
God of seas is calling for our death

So let the march of time begin facing to the end
fight with pride and honour, raise your fist
free your rage, let it fill your heart
and tonight in Valhall we will feast

We will die by the sea
thatâs a proof that all the seamen have to pass
if we want to defy the gods, discover a new land
all the brave will be swallowed by the storm
and the cowards will be starving at their home

We will die by the sword
thatâs an honour to the warriors from the north
we profess the religion of the glory by our own
thereâs no oblivion for those who are brave
there will be no remembrance on the cowardâs graves
