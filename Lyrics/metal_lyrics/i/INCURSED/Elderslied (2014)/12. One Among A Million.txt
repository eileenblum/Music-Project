THE DAWNING
Deep into the darkest streams of rage
a child was raised under the sign of hate
no one heard the whispers of his faith
his soul was slaughtered, he had to face the death

But proud he stood on what he was,
as he sat down next to a myth,
heir of the light, bringer of darkness,
he followed a path leading to madness

One among a million he was born
one drop in an ocean full of groans
great, and nonetheless, so miserable
over and over again to be torn down

One among a million I was born
the last standing man I will become
the awaited renewal for my soul
the blackest finale for them all

THE CROSSROADS
One more drop in the ocean makes no difference at all
I will decide my fate, that's the only way
everyone shall know my name

THE BLEAKNESS
My shell was always my guidance and protection
thus, I could not look outside, at this rotten realm
harsh winds of filth feed the lungs of men
and no one's safe at their own home

If you can see the end coming,
then you do not look beyond enough
at last the night is here
and all the whispers become sincere

I will ignite the flame on the ones that lost their light
betrayed origins are the depiction in the canvas of human life
earthly is the will of man against the iniquity in their minds
the whole divide of oneness will bring salvation at your last gasp

The realm of the mortals is burning, into the fire
all the bodies have begun to perish
in the name of death I cast the spell
so you may suffer as I bid you farewell

THE CLEANSING
Wake up from your sleep
all the torments have been set free
choose the path that you believe in
because the future can't be foreseen

Follow me to embrace the gift of life
inside the grief you'll find a place for calm
let the rain cleanse all of your sorrow
to face the day while past is gone
