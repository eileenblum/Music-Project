For aeons linking the nine worlds
the roots gave guidance to the lost souls
under the witness of the eternal guard
protecting the tree until the end, from the start

A legion of branches surrounding the skies
cage for all mortals, playground for gods
the waters of life flow frozen to a spring
colliding against fire from the flying wyrm

Within the souls of valiant men
there is a forge of prideful strength
when the sky turns red upon the battlefield
our cries break through beyond the steel

With fear scattered in the hearts of the foe
the barriers will fall like the autumn leaves
the gods shall behold us with heavenly wonder
as the bones of our enemies are torn asunder

[Chorus]

And beneath the tree of life we fight
beyond the sky we put our sight
we'll cut the flesh and share the mead
all for the heart of Yggdrasil

[Chorus 2x]
