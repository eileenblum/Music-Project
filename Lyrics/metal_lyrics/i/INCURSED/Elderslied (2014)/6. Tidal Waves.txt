Look outside, the light awakes
spring arrived and winter's gone
bring your longboards to the waves
the sea claims for blood with a mighty roar

For the time has come to raise our swords
and fight like brothers in the shield wall
we'll strike down upon thee
with great vengeance and furious anger

Mighty Njord, guide our boards
give us great waves so we'll surf like pros
the sun arrived and the ice is gone
surfer vikings over christian shores

Lindisfarne, the city of York,
Dublin, Wexford and the longport of Cork
nobody escapes from our deadly swords
surfer vikings, babe, sons of Thor

We fight for glory, we fight for riches
we claim your land and we claim your beaches
we're travelling east to the Pacific Ocean
we'll ride the waves at sunny California

And when summer's gone and fun is over
we'll surf back home and praise the mighty Oden
and Christians, frightened, will say: âOh Dear,
the surfer vikings will be here next year!â

[Chorus]

And we are proud, we are delighted
of who we are and how we're acting
you can blame us, send us to hell
but we enjoy to be surfer vikings
