In times of primeval chaos
the first of the giants burst forth
a junction of ice and fire (and fire)
unveiling an atrocious eyesore

When doze fell over the land of giants
its limbs laid coalesced in a lace
forged in rime, heads counting six (counting six)
Hrimthursar linked the chains of a race

[Chorus]
The nine worlds were portrayed with his flesh
and life dawned twinkling from her seed
the summer, the winter, the sun and the moon
the incipience of all life paid with greed

Rejected from the hearth of Ãsir
wind and water rose from their might

Submission as a role for existence
while enmity ingrains strained
sustaining the clockwork of nature
the JÃ¶tnar forsaken remain

[Chorus]
