Crossing the skies, riding the clouds
unstoppable, mighty, with skin pitch black
when the storm is nigh and the winds calm down
a glare shows up lighting the dark

Under the falling rain,
thirsty for blood, bringing the pain,
the wyverns are raging, the fire is free,
build your shelters and make your prays

"Faster than light, thy faith crumbles down,
the doom of the beasts thou shalt not avoid,
no one could ever stop the relentless,
before the death bringers thou shalt stand hopeless"

There was a story once told
where a warrior faced a wyvern
fury in its eyes he had seen
but he had the will of a leader

The beast was not blind, and saw through his soul
that he was the last one of a pure-blood descent
wisely he made the choice not to fight,
but to join him to follow the path of the strength

Fly higher and higher,
let every mortal witness our glory
rage, thunders and fire
will be our symbol, the seal of our story

The wyverns didn't forgive the traitor
so they put end to his life,
the warrior yelled, and he swore revenge
...to the end!

Raging wyverns, you shall die by my hands
raging wyverns, your greed you shall regret
raging wyverns, you shall die by my hands
raging wyverns, may your rot mean your end

Raging wyverns, you shall die by my hands
raging wyverns, your greed you shall regret
raging wyverns, you shall die by my hands
raging wyverns, your greed you shall regret
