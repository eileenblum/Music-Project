Freezing winds are summoning raging gales
as a traveler timelessly wanders
lost in the storm he meets the end
an ancient curse for every mortal

A desperate cry resounds on the hills
as the trees sway furiously
blindly seeking meets her gaze
impaling him right through the heart

[Chorus]
And there she stands,
dressed in ice and shadows,
the lady of frost is waiting
to embrace the eternal night... of cold!

At the fall of dusk no light remains
and all hope is forgotten
no creed nor faith shall now reject
the only and dismal fate

Her aura feeds the frozen souls
and withers life away
within the eternal flames of hell
shall lie relieving death

[Chorus 2x]
