Skies of a fatal winter night,
the winds are conjuring awakening spells,
seas of storm, a tough, dark time,
and waves are whispering words of decay

Corpses are leaving their pulverulent graves
ancient huntsmen are rising again
rotten souls in the need of flesh
the fallen, forgotten, are claiming revenge

[Chorus:]
Hear their words, proclaiming the end
a newborn plague that will raze the land
feel the grief and embrace the dread,
the incoming war will see us dead

No time for mercy,
they gave a choice and we took the wrong path
end of the journey,
there is no option for us but to die
now itâs their moment,
it is the time for the dead and the wicked to inherit our future and past

No way to fight them,
our gods have betrayed us and given their backs
no need of praying,
because my sword is the only thing I can trust
mankind is doomed,
after a painful life I'll be back as a servant of this macabre dance

So dance, dance, sing with lust
rejoice of the corpses surrounding us
dance, dance, the fallen arise
rejoice of the martyrs who mourn and cry
dance, dance, the tune of the dead
its melody comes from fiery hell
dance, dance, join the wild hunt
fed by the souls of the children of man

[Chorus 2x]
