Blizzards and ice, the power of north
silent and lethal, a death-payed toll
we strive for a shelter, in the eye of the storm
but hardly we find the strength to go on

Weeks have gone by since we last saw the sun
our struggle is painful, with blood in our hands
but fire lies deep into our hearts
nothing can't stop the wish of a god

Dive into the dreadful night
shattered by the piercing ice
will we find our way through the snow?
May the Norns guide us home

The howls of the wild are calling for bait
while we are running a race against death
night-wandering shadows painted by the bright moon
can only be a path to follow by fools

The ravens and wolves bring shivers to the flesh
painting the loneliness deep into ourselves
recalling the deepest pain a man can feel
but the harder the journey, the stronger the will

[Chorus 2x]
Light from the stars, please lead on our way
as we carry the torch of the undying flame
cleanse our souls, let the winter calm down
grant us your bless so we can see a new day

A long way to go remains to be seen
and after the storm shall come the relief
the light of the flame uncovers the dark
while the ill and the weak have stopped to breathe

Until the end... we'll keep it safe
until the end... the undying flame

Life is brief and blood sheds with ease
and the wicked will poison the veins of a man
in the end there's no hope for the light to remain
as the roots of the evil win the war every time

But while we stay alive and well
we'll keep on defending our future and past
our swords will prevail against the misdeed
our sons will stand proud in the ages to come

Until the end... we'll keep it safe
until the endâ¦the undying flame
