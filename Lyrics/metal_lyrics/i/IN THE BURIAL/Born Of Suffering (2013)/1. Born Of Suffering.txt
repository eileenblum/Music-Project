From poisoned womb grows soulless life
An existence born of suffering
Agony too great to endure
The bearer of your life
Breathes now her last breath
Her time of agony finally over now
A vein tapped and a line drawn in the sand
From her tragedy comes a new hope
The sound of innocence yet to be corrupted
These precious moments are so very fleeting
A motherâs embrace is so cruelly lost
What light now guides your way?
What path lay ahead for you?
Taken under abusive wing
Lessons learnt from filth and decay
This upward journey embarked
This erosion of virtue
