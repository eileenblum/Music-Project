Beauty that was so seldom held
So pure in her fucking way
Crimson lips on porcelain white
Glowing aura follows her moves
How could one be so perfect?
Urgency to make you mine
An inception born of darkness
A will consumed to destroy
I call out to you, a moment frozen in fear
My dear your innocence will be your downfall
I stare at you through the veil of leaves
Excitement builds in anticipation
The blood pumps as heart rate quickens
Time approaches when you will be mine
The darkness is upon you now
The devil lay behind these eyes
Sick intentions hidden in shadows
This wolf let loose on the lambs
My first, my perfect one
Please donât struggle my love
I claim your life and take as my own
No protector to keep you from harm
A sacrifice worth dying for
Fulfill these darkest desires
Now weâre all alone and all is quiet
We have all the time in the world
Enjoy the beauty of your suffering
Your death as pure as your life
