Even now when I listen closely I hear
The first of many, my beautiful one
My innocent Amaranthine
The way she pleaded to be spared
The look of betrayal in her eyes
Trust In Me, Iâll set you free
If there is a hell, itâs truly where I belong
I ask for no forgiveness, just truth
The weight of this secret, it crushes me
Not through the burden of guilt
But from the restraint needed to conceal the
clandestine
Were there tears of insult shed at my loss?
Did they gather and mourn?
Did they say I sleep in a better place?
How the fuck would they know?
At least when Iâm gone
There will be no deception
No clichÃ©d words of condolence
No mourning for me
In death... You gave me life
In death... This truth revealed
In death... We are all free
In death... Absolution
