Welcome to this infernal nightmare
A place where death feeds off the living
Caged and trapped you struggle to be free
Lambs to the slaughter
In this eerie place where dreams turn to nightmares
All that is sacred and pure is lost
Cold black of the earth waits to greet with open arms
What seems so right on the surface, is merely a facade
The true darkness dwells underneath
Writhing, twisted deformity
Watch on in terror the show is about to begin
This futile dance you are forced to watch
You can run, you can pray, for your life
But the ending is always the same
How quickly the eyes of the innocent
Turn black with greed
Empty smiles disguise the intent
Knives hidden, waiting for backs to turn
