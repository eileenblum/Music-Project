There is no end to my wickedness
My thirst for victims is unquenchable
I yearn for the trickle of their blood
The slicing of their flesh
The lifeless stare that follows
This ritual I must repeat
Before Iâm done the whole world will cower
I will write my name in red
I exist in the fear of many
Thrive on the terror of the few
Mercy will not be given
The voices wonât let me stop
The process begins again
I stalk my prey, I am the taker of your life
All honour taken, feel my sickening embrace
As I consume your soul, become one with me
Cower in the shadows, your life meaningless
Buried in a shallow grave
Forgotten in time
