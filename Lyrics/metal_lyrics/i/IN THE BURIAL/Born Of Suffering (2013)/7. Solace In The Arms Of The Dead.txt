This is your own personal Armageddon
Ruins of a broken world
Blood soaked and scattered all around
I revel in such naked honesty
I own your existence
Control your every breath
Suffer for me now
Taken into me
Consume all your flesh
Be as one soul now
Taken from the confusion of this world
What we have is pure now
As blood soaked as it may be
There are no false pretenses
These visions linger in me
Comfort on sleepless nights
Your screams like a symphony
Know Iâll be there at the end
Itâs only in this act I find peace, quiet from the noise
Solace can be found in the arms of the dead
