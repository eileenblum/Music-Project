Donât cower from me
Thereâs nowhere to run, your screams echo
But soon will be silent, death circles my innocent one
Let me guide you from this world
I have played this out in my dreams
So many times before
The way the light leaves your lifeless corpse
There is no forgiveness in my torturous ways
Such beauty in this world that I must destroy
My entire existence has been leading to this
And now it is done I feel no relief
Anticipation has left me wanting
I must relive this ritual
The floodgates open now
In destruction I will reign
Feeding off the terror in their faces
New search for the next victim
On and on the search now begins for the next in line
In these eyes lay no mercy
In this heart no truth
Skin tears and with it resolve of the helpless
Mercy not given here, even in betrayal
Bleed for me my precious one
