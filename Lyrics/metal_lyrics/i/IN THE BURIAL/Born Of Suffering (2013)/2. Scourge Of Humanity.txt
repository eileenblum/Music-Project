Spit on the ones that kneel at your feet
Nothing but disgust for them
Take them away and silence their cries
Defile them with torture, a madman
May their suffering be a warning
To all those who challenge this
Old man there will be a time
When I will rise up against you
Judgement day approaches
Let your guard down and I will have my revenge
Now I stand above you
Donât worry I will make you pay for this
With shovel in hand I will strike you down
I will leave you in a bloody mess
Exhilaration floods in waves of blood
You will cause no more harm
In your face they see the crimes
Unspeakable acts of cruelty
No remorse behind those eyes
Prepare to receive your judgment
