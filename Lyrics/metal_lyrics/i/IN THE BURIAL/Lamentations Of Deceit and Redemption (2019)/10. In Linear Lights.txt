Are you so smug to proclaim that you embody only of light
One who never would step foot in a lepers lair
How can you claim to hear only the voice of god, without first facing the devil?

I am a being of both the light and dark
I travel along the outskirts, along the path of separateness &amp; free will
I hear the ones that whisper in solitude, in the tongue of the ancient familiar.
My cells recognize your voice, summoning distant memories. You are another me. I am another you. The temporary vessel fails to show, the magnitude of what lies within.
That which you seek, seeks you

If ever there was an impostor, an opponent, a villain, a segregator, it's name would be ego. Know thy ego, know thyself. Because I give in, I am defeated by you. A hardening of the heart. A wall barricading my authenticity. My truth hidden beneath layers. Greater truths revealed. The bitterness of alienation oozes a poisonous venom

Do you remember the mother breath on the wind?
Overshadowed by the things that had died while you lived
semantics to heavy a burden to bare
Return to absence of duality

Emerging from stagnant waters, putrid and vile beneath halo smiles
Shrouding the repressed, and suffering in denial
Do not so easily dismiss your demons
