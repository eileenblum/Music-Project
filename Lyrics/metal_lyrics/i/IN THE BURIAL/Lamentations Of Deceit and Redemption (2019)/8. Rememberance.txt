Upon my last breath,
I inhale new life
I am exulted
Dancing across night skies
I am free
Mourn not, remember me
I am not here, I do not sleep

And then there was no-thing
No form, just infinite void
Silence stretched as vast a lifetime
Yet as short as the pause of a breath

Beyond flesh I embark
Toward the grand ancestral hall
The divine summons me
Beckoning me across endless
Celestial fields
Unto immortal

I see you
Ghost in the water
The skin that imitates life
I see you, just as you were
A quiet equilibrium
Omnipresence

I recall many names
Many faces and places
Motionless yet limitless
this mortal coil
from bones to dust
In reverence I bow as I
meet my maker
From bones to dust
Be not grieved
Just Rememberâ¦
