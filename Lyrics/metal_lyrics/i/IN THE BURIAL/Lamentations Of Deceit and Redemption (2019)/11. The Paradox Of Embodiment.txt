We are.....yet we are not
Life is a dream, yet a tangible phenomenon
Speaking the same language, in different tongues
Not one word memorised, yet familiarly comprehended

Unique fragments in the boundless ocean
Moving simultaneously though the timeless matrix
A multitude of ways of being
Footsteps that ripple monumentally

And the end is just another beginning
Each devastation, a transformation
Each death a rebirth in disguise
The order amongst the chaos
The calm amidst the storm

held in the core
words have no meaning
the subtleties of silent speech
The more the things change
the more they stay the same
The universe shaping itself to our vision

And when we cease to breath, consciousness remains
An endless cycle
In perpetual motion
