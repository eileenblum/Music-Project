Amrit
Niracara
Urgjasvala
anekarvaNa
Evolved cadavers
Mara
Vinasana
I am become death destroyer of worlds
To demolish the earth and dance in the wreckage

The first sparks fly
in the mist of atonement
Exorcize the phantom of
...Apathy
Insouciance

Night falls
Thus illuminates
The shadows fracture
Morning Lights strike disarray
Blood spills from the chasm
Elation....despair
peace and dread, stir all at once
Chaos....rapture
A gift, so much as a curse

Yaddha
SubhayAnaka
Akulita
A-Shaanthi
Death engulfed
Brahman
Zuddhabhava
As vultures they prey on the disarmed
Yet they emerge, seen standing in embers

The first sparks fly
In the mist of atonement
Each ending made anew

Karmic discordance within and without
Imbrued in dust of the old
a communion of lifeblood
Clamour....furore
Engulfs every cell
Bedlam....uproar
Internal hurricanes

A ruthlessly powerful force
On the brink of the greatest
Metamorphosis

Tearing holes in dimensions
potential turned disaster
tainted by the hearts of men

locusts swarming from within
crawling on your knees
The blinded curse
had you clenched
in the throes of suffocation
the twisting blade
in your temporal lobe
