Can you sense the storm coming?
The rise of the morning star
A baptism of flame
Burning in transformation
Your Apollyon

The serpent of light quenches the thirst for knowledge
A blazing radiance beyond macabre
wager of war, bringer of doom
Polymorphic....as gentle as dreadful
Behold Kali
Her pestilent storms
Purifier....
Bring down the sun into eclipse
Jar the phlegmatic into dismay

Inner temples will be defiled
Reverberating throughout the one
Striking down the inner tyrant
The unbeknownst passed
chant in disharmonious tune
An overture finale

Eyes shrouded in grey, visions distort by mere interpretation
Euphoric karmic flame
Evil certainly lives here
Itâs encoded in the trees
every branch and every leaf

Cast your eyes to the wondrous curiosities
Walk with ghosts
And dreamers
