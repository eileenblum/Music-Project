She was like fire
Burning through anything crossing her path
Drowning in tidal waves
he was like water
Devouring the blaze
The kiss of sorrow

A brick fortress built around her heart
Woe cloaks her vision
The perfection of his innocence
Left her in suspense
Of unnerving terror

Scatter thee, on welkin soil
The brightest fall hardest
For they fly so high

Dragging through the mud
Their children siphon her spirit
Her light was dimmed
by those who ravage her flesh, the earth
Like a hunter, Strikes at night
The spear had been broken,
Yet protruding from his heart
The earth groans and trembles
All creation, bowed to the dead
A sombre hymn of severance
All under the moon shifted
A tomb of discord
eternally dim, aglow is he

The great divide,
Mother Earth
father Sky.
