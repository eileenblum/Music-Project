This dark night of the soul
All to familiar
Those halls I dread to wander
In cold solitude

Impermeable material fortresses

All I could scream
could not move these walls
A life spent in its entirety
Possessed by its call

Holographic are the webs we weave
Hidden from common sight
The dead end realms I create
Only ends in ruins

No one could convince me otherwise
Such tangible evidence
testament to the deceit of sight
Truly I miss knowing what I once remembered
Truly I miss seeing what sight fails to see

You were given the gift of illusion, unknowingly
Just so you could find peace
In the silence, the truth always whispered
You are alone, yet....you are never alone

I am stranded
So swallow me up into your void.....Your lie
Unravelling webs, endless circles
Are taunting me, emptying me
In this barren wasteland
I am
Divided to pieces
