I am endless
Pure potential, the author &amp; architect
Both the master and the apprentice
Free from the confines of the mind
Broken the constraints of matter &amp; time
Beyond self righteousness, transcending the I

A crucifixion of fear
The Phoenix rises from ashes
Prevailing, out of the flames
As always I sovereign

Your dominion is futile
For want of power, your ruin
Prevailing out of flames
As always I sovereign

I am presence, I am consciousness
One with all that is
Alone I prevail, the alpha and omega.
In order to soar over mountains
One must tread lone though the wilderness
Get up off your knees
Get down from your throne

A crucifixion of fear
The Phoenix rises from ashes
Prevailing from the flame
As always I Sovereign
My virtue limitless
Omnipotent, relentless
Prevailing out of flames
As always I Sovereign

Crowning the kings of the wretched
As they sacrifice our kin, on alters of gold
Filling their cup with of the blood of meek
And we watch.....
We watch as we cry bloody murder
We protest as the cup spills further
drunk on woe &amp; sorrows, siphoning crimson red
Yet our oppressors will perish
by the strike of their own hand
The earth would swallow them into its depth
Binding the sword of their tongue
Banishing the imprint of their presence
Their empyreal nightmare
Yet beyond the grave, our elysian Fields

A crucifixion of fear
Rises from ashes
Out of flames
In faceless violation
Your arrows ricochet
As always, I sovereign

Buried beneath the avalanche of your own disarray
The accusers, the tricksters
Dead and alone
You tyrants, you traitors, forsakers of life
