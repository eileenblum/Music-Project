Footprints imprinted on lurid terrain
Gasping on the air, the thick stench of decay
Frost bitten Hands
My blood curdles, amidst sinister voices
Tapping thoughts that plague a fragile mind
Sending waves of anguish
Why am I here? What do you want?
The dead realm won't let me go
The gatekeeper holds a sign that
Makes no sense at all

My inner voice had betrayed me
Luring me straight to my enemies
This oppressive deceiver distorting my visions
The buzzing of soulless boneless creatures
Hatred builds in my weary heart
So this is how the malevolent reign?
For indeed my detestation and malice
â¦are the same
Quod est infernum
Crawling in circles
I can no longer stand
Deception, insulting my soul
I thought I'd found the light
Then I remembered that lake in the desert
Alas, my own words came back to haunt me
Darkness pierced my very soul
As kingdoms crumbled around me
I lost my life, and you gave me another
I beg to be pardoned
Encase me in your cocoon
Hidden away from this foul voice in the air

Some long to remember, some sleep to forget
