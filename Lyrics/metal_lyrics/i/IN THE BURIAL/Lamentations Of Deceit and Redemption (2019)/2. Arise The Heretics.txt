Long before there was the word, there was the truth
The veil of amnesia fell
Dual archetypes spawned of separation
Out of fear emerges a saviour outside ourselves
A sacrificial lamb for the darkness that resides in the psyche of man

Stirring fear and chaos
False torch bearers, death dwellers
in cloaks of ashen white
Cult of deceit, masked in light
As remembrance spreads like fire
The heretics arise
Born of flames so bright
There was another, formed of the aether
The old paradigm falls as the elders step foot on the soil.

Wolves in sheep skins bow, baring fruits so foul
War, War, War!
Myths and distorted half truths, ammunition to confuse and control
In war do they trust, the children of the new doctrine
Pledging allegiance to the false idol of their cognitive construct
Arms raised to the skies, awaiting triumphant arrival
Only to see their own face

Stirring fear and chaos
False torch bearers, death dwellers
in cloaks of ashen white
Cult of deceit, masked in light
As remembrance spreads like fire
The heretics arise

Enslaved by a delusion
Stripped of virtue, left desolate....forsaken by I
When the 'I' is found, I find you
