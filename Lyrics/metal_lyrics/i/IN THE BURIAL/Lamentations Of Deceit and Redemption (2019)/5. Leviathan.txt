It covers them in its bleakness, sinking beneath greying skin
Curdled violent words....cursing with their breath as they speak
rampantly anchoring its disease, a la mort
They Dance on graves as
Deranged martyrs march to the slaughter

In one hand you offer the sun
In the other clasp your choke-hold round my neck
Just like the hydra
cut off one head and another takes its place

A hostage race
The cult of inertia, stretched over eternities just like a plague
Behold your culprit is the one staring back in the mirror
token offerings that grip you to your enslavement

speak not above your breath in condemnation
the hand that feeds, also draws the blood of the servant

In one hand they offer the sun
In the other clasp a choke-hold round my neck
Just like the hydra
cut off one head and another takes its place

Indoctrination, a ruthless form of oppression
In secret
A burial ground
One for long forgotten dreams
