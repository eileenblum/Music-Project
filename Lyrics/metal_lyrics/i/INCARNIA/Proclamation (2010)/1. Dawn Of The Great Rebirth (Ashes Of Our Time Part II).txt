Fearful winds of burning fire
As we clean the scars of time
Rising from the ashes
Of a world destroyed

The light of dawn approaches
No longer shall we subvert
Eons spent in slavery
To the empty sky
As men, as brothers
We shall break free
I will lead thee: a phoenix race

Fearful were these men
Terror in the face of Zeus
From a lifetime beneath the ruins
But, I sought to bring light

With this banner high above our heads
Proclaiming a brand new day
For we have brought forth to thee
The dawn of the great rebirth

Fearful winds of burning fire
As we clean the scars of time
Rising from the ashes
Of a world destroyed

The light of dawn approaches
With this banner high above our heads
Proclaiming a brand new day
For we have brought forth to thee
The dawn of the great rebirth

Fearful were these men
Terror in the face of Zeus
From a lifetime beneath the ruins
But, I sought to bring light

With this banner high above our heads
Proclaiming a brand new day
For we have brought forth to thee
The dawn of the great rebirth
I, Prometheus, vow this unto thee
