Dear God,
Take my soul tonight
Spare me... this wretched pain
Torturous. Ravenous.

From the shadows
It will rise. Evolve. Take form. Overcome.

Across the dust
Through the fields
Lurking eyes of fire

Pestilence; swept clean the earth
Every last one will fall
Insatiable thirst for human life
Everyone will suffer

Inject the sickness
Deteriorate the human genome
Strand by strand

Bow down,
Before the bringers of infection
Blind and merciless
Close your eyes
And accept your judgement

Pestilence; swept clean the earth
Every last one will fall
Insatiable thirst for human life
Everyone will suffer

Incurable, incomparable
Devouring without remorse
Relentless. Reckless.
Yersinia Pestis

Inject the sickness
Deteriorate the human genome
Strand by strand

Foolish and meek
The powerless hands of a man
Cannot cease the axe of karma

From the shadows
It will rise. Evolve. Take Form. Overcome.

Pestilence; swept clean the earth
Every last one will fall
Insatiable thirst for human life
Everyone will suffer

Looking towards the stars
Your last words are a prayer
Blessed is he
Who takes this pain away
Blessed is he...
