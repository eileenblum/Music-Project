Where will you be?
When the sky
Piece by piece
Falls from the pedestal
You placed it on
Where will you be...?

Will you pray to the sun?
Pray to the stars?
Seek forgiveness?
Will you repent your ''sins''?

Where will you be
When the sky
Falls from the pedestal
You placed it on?
Where will you be...?

In these final hours
Among carrion you will lay
In repentance and contrition
Among carrion you belong

Like a flock of headless pheasants
Searching without eyes to see
You sought truth
In the grandest of lies

In these final hours
Among carrion you will lay
In repentance and contrition
Among carrion you belong

Will you pray to the sun?
Pray to the stars?
Seek forgiveness?
Will you repent your ''sins''?

Where will you be
When the sky
Falls from the pedestal
You placed it on?
Where will you be...?

Like a flock of headless pheasants
Searching without eyes to see
You sought truth
In the grandest of lies

In these final hours
Among carrion you will lay
In repentance and contrition
Among carrion you belong

In these final hours
Will we be judged upon
How we have given our life to the suns in the sky
...Or is there something more?
