As the wind bellows softly in the night
Next to you I will walk until the morning light
Hand in hand, soul in flesh
Let my words gently guide your steps
Now that chaos ensues

I promise to stand by your side
To embrace forevermore

As you walk solemnly
Down this endless path of flames
Let no flames burn thy skin
I will hold your hand

Soon approaches the calm after the storm
Still you are in my arms...
And I will lay you
By the shoreline of the sea
Where I am eternally to embrace
...forevermore

I promise to stand by your side
To embrace forevermore

As you walk solemnly
Down this endless path of flames
Let no flames burn thy skin
I will hold your hand
Through this storm
Through the the raging waters
May my tears be your guide

I promise to stand by your side
To embrace forevermore

As you walk solemnly
Down this endless path of flames
Let no flames burn thy skin
I will hold your hand
Through this storm
Through the raging waters
May my tears be your guide
