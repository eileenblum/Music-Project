Mother night
Cruel mistress
Huntress
Darkness moving
Upon the face of the deep

I know the darkness which consumes you
Ancient hatreds festering
I have watched the demons you hold at bay
Predatory wolves circling the fire

The light around you grows fainter
Soon you shall be freed
Shackled by your humanity
Cast aside the stench of purity
And receive my gift with open arms

In a sacred glade, a shrine forgotten
An ancient curse of ancient spirits
She beckons to me and whispers...
Free me and you shall have the world

Golden altar standing alone
Buried in a field of ash
Her scars entombment
Remnants of the fall
She remains imprisoned
Waiting to be freed

In a sacred glade, a shrine forgotten
An ancient curse of ancient spirits
She beckons to me and whispers...
Free me and you shall have the world
Where fallen apostles assemble

Your fears and nightmares
These are the seeds of evil
Which I have implanted in you
They have driven away everything you cherished
The power to banish them is mine
And mine alone

The light around you grows fainter
Cast aside staunch purity
And receive my gift with open arms

In a sacred glade, a shrine forgotten
An ancient curse of ancient spirits
She beckons to me and whispers...
Free me and you shall have the world
Where fallen apostles assemble
