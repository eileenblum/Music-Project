[Fight Your Darkness]

From the depths of mind
Born the fear and pain
A shadow upon your thoughts
Becoming flesh unbounded

Black liquour flying through my veins
Burning ecstasy growing from inside
The human being I was, has changed
Now the fearless one guides my life

My mind's going down
Adversus pugna tenebras
Afraid of suffering
Darkness (it) wants me

A dark mist
Came to me
Now I'm unchained
No black shade around my heart

The monster to which I changed
Is the one that we all have inside
This process of purification
Is the salvation for our rotten souls
Redemption of fate

Black liquour flying through my veins
Burning ecstasy growing from inside
The human being I was, has changed
Now the fearless one guides my life

My mind's going down
Adversus pugna tenebras
Afraid of suffering
Darkness (it) wants me

A dark mist
Came to me
Now I'm unchained
No black shade around my heart
