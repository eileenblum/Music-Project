Slaves, worship me
I'm your God, I'm the Light
Wicked winds transport the pain
And the sand will bury your blood

â¦.I just kill
Cult of golden dreams
Embalmed in holy blood
Forever and ever

Underfed, (but) you must obey meâ¦
"Live to serve" is a command
My glory must be preservedâ¦
So the fear will sculpt my throne

â¦.I just kill
Cult of golden dreams
Embalmed in holy blood
Forever and ever

Dominating the land of serpentsâ¦
slaves will cryâ¦will cry
Buried alive with meâ¦
Or sacrificedâ¦.sacrificed

Bleed, die for me
As my life fades out
Surrounded by harsh silk
Even a God can die

Even a God can dieâ¦.
Even your God can cry â¦
