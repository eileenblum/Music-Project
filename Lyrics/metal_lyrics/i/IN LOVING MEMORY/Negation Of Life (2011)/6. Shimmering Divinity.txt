My lies pull me under your sweet and pale skin
(I'm) so sick and perverse as God
Hypocrisy is not only my sin
But is the curse that seals my words

Come with me, I swear
Infernal heaven, the Promised Land
Anyone who embraces me
Will receive my eternal forgiveness.
My head wears two crowns
One made of thorns and one made of lies
As my spirit darkness the faith
My legend is infecting your minds.

I'm a liar crowned by faith
Pride of being replacement for Light
Darkness start to tap
While meanness extends my lands
And my dominion comes to fall

Come with me, I swear
Infernal heaven, the Promised Land
Anyone who embraces me
Will receive my eternal forgiveness
My head wears two crowns
One made of thorns and one made of lies
As my spirit darkness the faith
My legend is infecting your minds.

Your laments are nothing but fairy acts
And while you're crying for me I'll hold on you

Your faith is nothing but dump of thoughts
In which you pour all your black umbrage

The lie is again my tool
With which I'll change the face of the world
In my right hand I hold and point
The sceptre that will enthrone me as God

Holy scars make up my face
Highlighting me as your new Lord
Thorns stuck in the flesh as "punishment"
But the halo redeems me and opens my soul
To shimmering divinity.

Shimmering divinity.
