I'm standing in silence
Alone with my sorrow
With sand in my hands
And the cry of November all around
But the sun is not shining for me today

The wind caresses my face
Carrying tears and sighs

My body is shaking wounded
My mind is now severely disturbed

You both were my life
My light and (the) only guide
No reason to live
No pity. I'll dieâ¦(for you)

Now I've got no son, no wife with me
And (the) coldness of November covers me
(covers me)
I can find no cry, religion or sense
That comforts me in the pain of this existence
(False existence)

I miss you as much as it hurts.
My life, my heart, my bloodâ¦had gone with you, my love.

Slowly in my fall down
I see the void's claw.

Swinging in Thy arms
Please, take me where they are.

Please, take, take, take, take me where they are.
Please, take, take, take, take me where they are.

Please, take me where they are.
Please, let me go
