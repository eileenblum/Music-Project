Since human beings arose from the mud
We've been fighting against ourselves
Using the guns God gave to use
From Heaven to Earth, and from there to the Hell

No matter how much lives left on the ground
The war must be won, at any price
Just awaiting to my oath, I stand in front of them
Upset flames of furious rage, there's no scape for guilty men

I pray for no God
Skilled nihilism
Caress me, love me
I'm your guardian, beloved God
Of your heart

Humanity changed the face of the Earth
Sink it with the blood of thousands
Angry Thy soul with immense pain
Archangels of God collecting their souls

Beating their wings raze the fields of nephilims
Adored by the ones that only pray
Just awaiting to my oath, I stand in front of you
Upset flames of furious rage, there's no scape for guilty men

I pray for no God
Skilled nihilism
Caress me, love me
I'm your guardian, beloved God
Of your heart

And I watched the Master Fall, God's crying
Third of Heaven's legion banished, Devil's troops
The First War stained the sky, dripping red
Now the Second coming rage is starting

I pray for no God
I pray for no God
Skilled nihilism
