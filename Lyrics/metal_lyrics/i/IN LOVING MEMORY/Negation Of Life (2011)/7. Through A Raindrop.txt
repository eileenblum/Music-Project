I've lost the train of my life
Due observation of others grief
And by the time my environment ruins
I will feel nothing but impotence

A sigh condenses my laments
Falling down to Earth through dirty rain
Sliced into thousand of new drops
And spreading my hopes with'em all

All my remembrance
Reflected as in a kaleidoscope
Over the vast sphericity
Of its shaved surface

Fake illusion
Detached exile
All my life has been so empty
Now that I know my time has gone

No more liquid flows inside me
All was dried with the heat of my wrath
Rot my entrails and scorched my sighs
Until the hole of wasted years was full

A breath of sick air escapes from me
Exhaled by a deep black lounge
Envenoms mankind with its sadness
A mental poison that cannot be cured

I've spent dead hours
Admiring the pass of time
Through an opaque raindrop
Across my window glasses

Fake illusion
Detached exile
All my life has been so empty
Now that I know my time has gone

And as I watch its march
Seconds don't stop at my steps
Life slips by the hands
Of seasons I've mislayed.
