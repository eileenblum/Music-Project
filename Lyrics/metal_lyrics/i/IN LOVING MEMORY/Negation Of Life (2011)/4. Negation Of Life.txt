Closed doors to reality
Forced life of agony
Inside myself there's only cold
Hammering soul with its sound

If I've got no heart, no face and no love
What's the meaning of existence?
If I have no soul, no flesh, no life
Where should I go when I die?

Where should I go when I die?

I reached the limits, the edge of my world
Negation of Life is the end that must come.

I belong to nowhere of this land
No one talks to me
I'm invisible for you all
My skin has signs of no life

If I've got no heart, no face and no love
What's the meaning of existence?
If I've got no soul, no flesh, no life
Where should I go when I die?

Where should I go when I die?

I reached the limits, the edge of my world
Negation of Life is the end that must come.

And in the end, I think it must be about faith,
and if faith is a choice, then it can be lost â
for a man, an angel, or the devil himself.
And if faith means never completely understanding God's plan, then maybe understanding just a part of it â
our part â is what it is to have a soul.
And maybe in the end, that's what being human is, after all.

I don't want to live
This life is my own Hell
The pain must be stopped
And it will when I die.

My dormant body walks street by street
The path of my destiny was revealed
So I can only follow my shadow
As my tears can wet no face
