Sensual movements
Illuminate her pride
Dancing like sirens
I can't resist my thirst

Her curves are now my jail
She's an apple envenomed

Smouldering angel
Filthy looks and words
Inviting evil
Trapped until she blooms

Walking side by side
She holds my hand
While red fluid's running
Across my lips

Her flesh is temptable
And my desire grows
(But) she belongs to Heaven
Far from Hell

I can't resist my thirst
Her curves are godless lust for me

Perfume of evil sex
Bloody scent in every breath of air
She belongs to Heaven
As I reign in Hell

She belongs to Heaven
As I reign in Hell
She belongs to Heaven
As I reign in Hell
