[No Faith, Only Truth]

Two religions face to face
Stomping the same Promised Land

Fighting and killing, our blood will sink this ground
But never will stop this eternal Holy War

We worship different gods
And we both feel our devotion

Killing and dying, our flesh will feed this ground
But never will forget this eternal Holy Pain

Nulla religio, solum veritas
Die My Enemy, Die My Friend

Peace will reign all under the sky
But this land will ever cry

Die and reborn, our souls will clean this ground
But never will achieve the eternal Holy Grace

Nulla religio, solum veritas
Die My Enemy, Die My Friend
Nulla religio, solum veritas
Kill My Son...Feed Your Hate

We always said "never kill"
But when our Faith is on the target of weapons
We can hide our ideas
And do what we need to survive this fight

Nulla religio, solum veritas
Die My Enemy, Die My Friend
Nulla religio, solum veritas
Kill My Son...Feed Your Hate
