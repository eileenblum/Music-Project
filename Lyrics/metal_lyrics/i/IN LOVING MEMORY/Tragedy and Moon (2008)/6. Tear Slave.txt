Fear every time I see you
Horror every time I feel you

Trapped in a black hole
Prisoner of a scared soul

Thinking of ways to finish
Craving for an end to this

Forced to be slave
Tears made me brave
Fear slave
Tears from the grave

Desire's born from this doom
False hope that now grows

Once again wounded inside
My being consumed as I die

My last wish
Is to rest in peace
