The Devil's waiting for you to break
When the mist surrounds your heart
He subdues the souls to dark
You cannot hide to the fog that purifies.

In the mist of your thoughts
You fight against your soul
In the mist of your mind
Face your fears, lose and fall

Locus ubis abdi non est
Nebula pervenit timor prodet
Tuam mentem protegis
Tamen corpus tuus pabulum erit aeternitatis

You dive into midnight mist
Brave and bold of yourself
But its coldness breaks all your shields
Plunges you into obscurity

In the mist of your thoughts
You fight against your soul
In the mist of your mind
Face your fears, lose and fall

Nowhere to run or escape to
The mist is here, the fear appears
Lock down your mind
To this coming terror world
