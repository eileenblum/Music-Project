Cold days ahead
Faithful moments to forget
Under a veil of nihilism
Nobody acts and help.

My entrails shuffle in pain
My tears soak my skin
Efforts done in vain
Here, awaiting for an end.

Please, stop this suffering
Put (an) end to this killing
Because my death brings us to the dark
And my life is all the light you'll ever see

Ego, Terra, Mater tua sum.
Tu, filius meus dilectus es, quaem tantum amo
Sed etiam, actus tui improbi sunt,
Et oculos meos secant
