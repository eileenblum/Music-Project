Extremus illae spiritus.
A woman dying in love
Her bride looks satisfied
Ecstasy arises and explodes

She knows the truth
Her real nature
(She) can't down it for longer
Her love consumes her body

Extremus illae spiritus.
A woman dying in love
Her bride looks satisfied
Ecstasy arises and explodes

Her lips in silence
Are acts of love
But (the) pain she carries
Hurts like evil in heaven

When the first drops of red
Dye the (immaculate) white dress
The black ones becomes blood

With the sound of screams
Playing like bells in her ears
Passion and lust are unchained

This is the better way
They will stand forever
United, loved and in peace
Mors principium est.
