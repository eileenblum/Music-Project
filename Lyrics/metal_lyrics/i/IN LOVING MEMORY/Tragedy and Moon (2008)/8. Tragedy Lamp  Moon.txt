Thousand winters ago
The Moon needed love
She undressed her silhouette
Lust was unchained.

Tragedy and Moon.
Shadows and light.

Phobos cried for her love
And she was pleased,
But (the) Sun wanted her heart,
Disaster came to planetary.

Tragedy and Moon.
Shadows and light.

And the war started
Suffering the Light's revenge
All the planets and moons
Were submitted into (the) depths of Hell.

Horror and fear, shadows comes.
Black Hole, the one that will prevail. Pray loud.
Phobos, destroyed by his rage .
Snow will cover all the Earth. Ice age.

Tragaedia lunaque
Una incorruptorum amantiorum fabula
Mundi res gestale
Amoris perpetui monumentum
