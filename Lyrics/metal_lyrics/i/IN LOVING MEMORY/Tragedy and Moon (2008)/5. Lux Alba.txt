Life denies me a breath of air
I'm alone in this immense sea

I have no age, but I'm old
My entire life has been so, so short

Since I was born I died
Every day, in silence

Mankind rejected me
All my life in the shadows

I think I was born
To die this day

Why should I wait?
Why should I live?

My existence runs to the white light
Now I'm craving for your mercy
I want anything from you except one act
So, please do not resuscitate me

The white light on the sky
Grips my soul, my mind
I'm flying through the ether
I'm reaching to Thy side

My trip is ending
The (white) light becomes red
The devil is at my side
Where the Hell am I?
