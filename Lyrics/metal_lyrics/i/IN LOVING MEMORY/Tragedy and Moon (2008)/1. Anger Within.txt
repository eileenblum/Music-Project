The world under my feet spins around my bed
As I rest in this jail my mind seeks for death

I can't move, I can't talk
I can't see, I can't love.

I can't feel, I can't die
I can't breathe, I can't cry.

Anger Within.
Sorrow is me.

Unplug me from life ...just let me die.
Switch me off. It's time to lay

I can't move, I can't talk
I can't see, I can't love.

I can't feel, I can't die
I can't breathe, I can't cry.

Anger Within.

Inside this lifeless coil
Nothing more I feel
Only waiting for death
I can live again.

Wrath is burning me
Rage explodes inside
Faith is not my crime
Pain not Jesus is my guide
