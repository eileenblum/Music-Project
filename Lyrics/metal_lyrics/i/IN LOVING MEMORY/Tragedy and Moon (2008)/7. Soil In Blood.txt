Life's enslaved by egoism
Jewels engraved in death
People's sweat is blood
And soil soaks on it.

Bitter reward discovery
Brings suffering and blood
Miracles don't exist

Only scape is death.
A bullet will end
This shame.
With the new day
Crimson skies fall down
And the greed renews its crime

History remains the same...

A gem filled up with pain
Shines like a black star

How much bodies will break
For a desire without end

Red drops everywhere
Black tears out of there
