Leaving the world of mortals
I belong to Thee
My corruptible body is lifeless
But I feel the same pain inside of me

Heaven is not white
Hell is not fire full
But in the shadows I am
Seems like been caught in the middle
Heaven is not white
Hell is not fire full

As in pain as in shadows
As in pain as in shadows

Heaven is not white
Hell is not fire full
But Â´cause the pain that I have
Cannot be pulled down again
Heaven is not white
Hell is not fire full

As in pain as in shadows
As in pain as in shadows

No where to cry
No God to pray for

Now IÂ´m beside you
And there'sÂ´s no God to pray for
