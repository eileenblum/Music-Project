She wears black
She will get married
But look sad
Seems like a funeral

She knows the true
Her real nature
She canÂ´t down it for longer
Needs to satisfy her passion

Her bride is terrified
When the white dress
Gets the first drip of red
And the black one becomes blood

This is the better way
They will stand forever
United, loved and in peace
Death is just the beginning
