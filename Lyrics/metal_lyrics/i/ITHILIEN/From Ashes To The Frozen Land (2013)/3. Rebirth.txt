I don't understand 
I'm the one to stand 
Through this heavy steam 
Alone I scream

Now it's time to ï¬ght 
Our honor is stained 
Flowing from the ï¬ames 
My sword stands right

The hunt has begun 
Every step I take 
Following her trace 
She will rest in peace

I ride through the night 
I leave the past behind 
I cry through the night 
I left my life behind
[2x]
