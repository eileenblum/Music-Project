Over this sea we wait 
The next step is our grave 
Under us he lays down 
Silent and relentless

His look upon our hopes 
Freezing us to the bones 
As our past is behind 
We're no more running blind

Stare to the deepest 
I sail to my death 
Neverending fall 
I sink in the depths 
Embracing the end 
I sail to my death 
Stare into the deep

All I see is inï¬nity 
Inï¬nity and a lonely me
Where's that time 
The time when I was free

Behind this sea 
I know there's no ï¬nality 
I will ï¬nd a way 
To kill this monstrosity

Stare to the deepest 
I sail to my death 
Neverending fall 
I sink in the depths 
Embracing the end 
I sail to my death 
Stare into the deep
