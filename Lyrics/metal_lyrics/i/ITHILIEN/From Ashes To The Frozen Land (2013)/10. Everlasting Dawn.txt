I came to win 
It's everlasting 
My soul's no more 
Just a piece of ruin 
But still in me 
It's them I see 
Enlightening me 
Strengthen me

Everlasting dawn 
Fallen from beyond 
Hear our voice inside 
Battle at our side

Everlasting dawn 
Trapped in her womb 
I will set you free
Kill them with me

Everlasting dawn 
Escape from your tomb 
Hear our voice inside 
Battle at our side

Everlasting dawn 
Come back from beyond 
Hear our battle cry 
Unleash all your might
