Believe me when I say I'm drunk as shit 
I'm in this strange place again 
Everyone's yelling and'll never admit 
They're Drunk and not to blame

In this tavern we all came 
To drink and forget our shame

Drink with me 
Drink with him 
Drink with her 
Drink with us

All those battle 
Always alone 
I feel the guilt 
My strength is gone 
Hearing those groans 
From where I come 
Where I belong

With those drinks 
I don't feel things 
Neither my wounds 
That used to burn 
Burn to my bones
Burning my soul 
The love in me 
Is gone

Believe me when I say I'm drunk as shit 
I'm in this strange place again 
Everyone's yelling and'll never admit 
They're drunk and not to blame

In this tavern we all came 
To drink and forget our shame

Drink with me 
Drink with him 
Drink with her 
Drink with us
