It's the mother of the night hear her calls 
It brings undead to life again 
It's the monster of twilight , born to stalk 
The beast's safe as she remains

The old man told us 
Under her power 
She's invincible 
The beast is struck 
She took an oath 
With the mother
Mother of the night

Under her command
She kills to live 
For eternity 
To own her freedom 
She took an oath 
With the mother 
Mother of the night

Walking on the ground, 
She whispers my name
Forgive my mistakes

At moonlight they howls 
Far behind, behold 
Do you... 
Do you hear their calls?

The old man told us 
Under her power 
She's invincible 
The beast is struck 
She took an oath 
With the mother 
Mother of the night

Under her command 
She kills to live 
For eternity 
To own her freedom 
She took an oath 
With the mother 
Mother of the night

It's the mother of the night hear her calls 
It brings undead to life again 
It's the monster of twilight , born to stalk 
The beast's safe as she remains

We are the night slayers 
Stop her might forever
We are the night slayers 
Kill the night forever
