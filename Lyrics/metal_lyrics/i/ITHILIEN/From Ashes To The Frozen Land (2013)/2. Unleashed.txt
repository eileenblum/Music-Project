Far across the land 
Cities are burning 
Lets reach our hands 
And pray for mercy

Don't forget your weapons
The ï¬ght won't be easy
But we'll carry on 
We'll end up the ï¬ght

Far across the see 
The beast is in sight 
Treading down the earth 
Big enough to touch the sky

We shall succeed 
No doubt about that 
We shall be free 
We take our strength from light

Far across the land 
Cities are burning 
Lets reach our hands 
And pray for mercy
Far across the see 
The beast is in sight 
Treading down the earth 
Big enough to touch the sky
[2x]
