On his mind he once believed 
Of a place where no one lived 
He waits for his destiny 
Reckless of his legacy

This man is me 
Child of the land 
Our elders won 
What have I done

Our past glory 
Faded with me 
As one we'll die 
No tears no cries

In the end the plague came to my own land
And alone I knew I had no more chance 
I stood up and took my sword in my hand 
Everyone looked at me with fear and despair

On my throne I once believed 
Of a place where someone lived 
I wasted my destiny 
Tearing down my legacy

As my soul is ï¬lled by wrath 
My kingdom has fell apart 
Facing our punishment 
I rehash my memories

I said to those alive

Be proud to ï¬ght 
On this dark ï¬eld
For your beloved 
Blessed by your swords

We are proud to ï¬ght 
As our faith is not sealed 
Keep this in mind 
We'll chase the beast

This man is me 
Child of the land 
Our elders won 
Growling this song

Our past glory 
Faded with me
As one we'll die 
With tears with cries
