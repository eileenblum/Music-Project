Time killed my inner beliefs 
This path is the right for me 
Wasted dreams I can't achieve 
Walking alone for eternity

My burden is becoming more 
And more a load my hopes 
Can't hold can't hold this weight on me
Will you carry, carry it with me

I was really blind to believe 
The path I chose was right for me 
My inner hopes I've deceived 
Following dreams of eternity

I was blind to believe 
I could carry this curse on me 
The weight of this world oï¬ered to me's
Too heavy to carry

The weight of this world cursed on me
