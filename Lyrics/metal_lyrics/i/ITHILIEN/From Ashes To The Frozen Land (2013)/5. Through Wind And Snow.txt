Light the path 
It's burning prints 
All over 
A freezing mist 
Feel so cold
It's time to face 
The consequence 
Of my disease

In my soul 
I feel the ice
And my shadow 
Still hides

In my heart 
I seal the pain 
And my sorrow 
Inside

My weakness 
And my fears 
They won't stop 
My ï¬ght tonight 
Raise your swords 
It's time to face 
The consequence 
Of her release 
In my soul 
I feel the ice 
And my shadow 
Still hides

In my heart 
I seal the pain 
And my sorrow 
Inside
