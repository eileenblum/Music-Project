Nothing left untoldâ¨
All my pain unfoldsâ¨
Suffer has come to an endâ¨
Don't wanna be part of this again 

A life full of secretsâ¨
Kept inside a bewitching head
Forgiving was my weakness 
When caught in your nasty web 

It's all gone nowâ¨
We're all done anyhowâ¨
Wished for your attention then 
It's all gone now 

Lies after lies
I saw the devil in disguise
Lies after liesâ¨
You made us slowly dieâ¨
This has been too much to handle 
You blew all the candlesâ¨
I will never realiseâ¨
Why you've done those sacrifices 

I was mesmerisedâ¨
Like light to fliesâ¨
Now I see clear, all my oldest fears 
Came back to life
Such a shame 

You loved to play this gameâ¨
And you're all aloneâ¨
Now that your true face has been shown 

It's all gone nowâ¨
We're all done anyhowâ¨
Wished for your attention then 
It's all gone now 

Lies after lies
I saw the devil in disguise
Lies after liesâ¨
You made us slowly dieâ¨
This has been too much to handle 
You blew all the candlesâ¨
I will never realiseâ¨
Why you've done those sacrifices
