If only, if only I could seeâ¨
What would you ask of me 
If only, if only I was freeâ¨
To rewrite our apogeeâ¨
If only, if only I could standâ¨
Out of this quicksandâ¨
If only, if only I could feelâ¨
The touch of your skin 

What would you ask of me 
To rewrite our apogee 
Drowning into quicksands 
The touch of your skin 
What would you ask of me
Would it be as easy 
What's left to saveâ¨
I would've put you safe 

If you've ever been next to meâ¨
It's time to listen carefullyâ¨
I'm falling please catch meâ¨
Where are you now that I need you 

Is this reality playing tricks on me 
It was my faith, our destiny 
Taken away from me 
To madness 
I'll obey 

If only, if only I could seeâ¨
What would you ask of me 
If only, if only it was meâ¨
Would it be as easyâ¨
If only, if only I could take 
What's left to saveâ¨
If only, if only you told me 
Would've put you safe

If you've ever been next to meâ¨
It's time to listen carefullyâ¨
I'm falling please catch meâ¨
Where are you now that I need you 

Is this reality playing tricks on me 
It was my faith, our destiny 
Taken away from me 
To madness 
I'll obey 
[3x]
