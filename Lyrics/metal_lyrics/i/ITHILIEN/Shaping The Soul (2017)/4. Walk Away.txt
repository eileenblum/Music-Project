Far down the lineâ¨
You've crossed too many facesâ¨
Knowing the pain left you out to dry 
Empty of all your tears you cannot hide 
All alone you walk away 

Hesitation, to forget or to forgive 
What in this world is leftâ¨for you to liveâ¨
Holding on to the past 
Such as it once wasâ¨
Let time fly without you 

Sadness dwelling gently into you 
A breach over a perfect line
When everything seemed so fine 
Holding on to the past 
Such as it once was
