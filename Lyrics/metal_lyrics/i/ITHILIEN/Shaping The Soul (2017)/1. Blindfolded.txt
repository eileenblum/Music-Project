I am standing by your side 
Destroying my mind 
While I let this time flyâ¨
In denial 

I do not trust a word they say 
Believing this was meant to stay 
Stuck in my head, it's all okay 
Please wake me up to yesterday 

Blindfolded I ran 
Towards peace of mind 
Searching for an answer
I wont rememberâ¨
Ending this far down
Just to turn around 
Leaving it all behind 
Wish I could rewind 
[2x]

I am lurking into fright 
Memories going wild 
Nothing will make this right 
In denial 

I do not trust a word they say 
Believing this was meant to stay 
Stuck in my head, all's gone away 
Don't wake me up to this day 

Blindfolded I ran 
Towards peace of mind 
Searching for an answer
I wont rememberâ¨
Ending this far down
Just to turn around 
Leaving it all behind 
Wish I could rewind 
[2x]

Leaving it all behind 
Wish I could rewind
