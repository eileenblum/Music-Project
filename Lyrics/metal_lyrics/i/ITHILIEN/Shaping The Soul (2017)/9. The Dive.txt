I swallowed my pride,
In remembrance of a timeâ¨
Where we both used to touch the sky 
Together forever,â¨
It was just a bunch of liesâ¨
Now you're off my life 

I can't remember why
Why did I even tryâ¨
I can't remember why
Why did I make the dive 

I can forgive, but I can't forget 
All these years, torn apart 
Pleasure and miseryâ¨
Scrambled into you, blind 
Clarity inside a hopeless mind 

I can't remember why
Why did I even tryâ¨
I can't remember why
Why did I make the dive 

Diving, into chaosâ¨
Dazzled by hope that make me stand 
Drowning, in a sea of liesâ¨
Playing seek and hideâ¨
And taking me downâ¨
Diving, into my mindâ¨
Compassion drowned in these eyes 
Taking advantage of faithâ¨
How could you play me this way 
Why drag me alongâ¨
When you knew you were wrongâ¨
All I can say I wish I had knownâ¨
You knew you were wrong 

I've lived so muchâ¨
I ran through timeâ¨
Still sometimes I seeâ¨
The spell you cursed on me 
How couldn't you realise
This wasn't supposed to last 
Clarity inside a hopeless mind 

I can't remember why
Why did I even tryâ¨
I can't remember why
Why did I make the dive 

Wrong 

I can forgive, but I can't forget 
All these years, torn apart 

I can't remember why
Why did I even tryâ¨
I can't remember why
Why did I make the dive
