Deep and intricate revelations 
Within my inner griefâ¨
The pain is blurring my sight
In search of a new start 
I worship the unrealâ¨

Learn to fight your endless fears 
Until nightmares disappearâ¨
Into daylightâ¨
Acting like nothing's wrongâ¨
I like the places I don't belong 

Secrets will be kept untold
While I'm trying to stay whole 
But sometimes I realiseâ¨
The countless times I fallâ¨
The filling of an endless voidâ¨
Of all that couldn't be forgot 
Can't control and will not hold 
The shaping of my soul 

Reality and dreams intertwined 
Everything's fading awayâ¨
My hearth stands at bay 
Emptiness drives my will 

Can those wounds even heal 
Suffered too much to go down 
Learn to never hit the ground 
When pain comes around 

Can't control 
The shaping of my soul 

Secrets will be kept untold
While I'm trying to stay whole 
But sometimes I realiseâ¨
The countless times I fallâ¨
The filling of an endless voidâ¨
Of all that couldn't be forgot 
Can't control and will not hold 
The shaping of my soul 

Secrets kept untoldâ¨
Trying to stay wholeâ¨
Sometimes I realiseâ¨
The countless times I fallâ¨
Can't control
The shaping of my soul
