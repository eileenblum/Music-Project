I stand on the edge with myselfâ¨
When did I found out I got lostâ¨
Every move I make brings me a little closer 
I just hope this will soon be over 

As a shadow I'm facing a wall 
Endless frights, hopeless nights 
Staring at those empty frames 
Of the one I once became 
Only steps away from being free 
Why did it happened to meâ¨
Gone too far to stand a chance 
Tell me how this will end 

I stand on the edge with myselfâ¨
When did it all take this turn 
Everything I build slowly falls apartâ¨
Is there hope, or nothing but illusions 

I stand on the edge with myself 
When did I walk away from my dreams 
I crushed my hopes from their seeds 
An empty soul wanders around 
Emptied from all its wounds 

As a shadow I'm facing a wall 
Endless frights, hopeless nights 
Staring at those empty frames 
Of the one I once became 
Only steps away from being free 
Why did it happened to meâ¨
Gone too far to stand a chance 
Tell me how this will end 
[2x]

Staring at empty framesâ¨
Of the one I becameâ¨
Gone too far to stand a chancer 
Tell me how this will end 
[2x]
