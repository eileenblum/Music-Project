Lost but never forgotten 

I'm frighten nowâ¨
I don't know howâ¨
I'm standing aloneâ¨
I lost my homeâ¨
Seeking something rare 
Forgotten to be wise 
You're my edelweiss 

I'm standing alone
I lost my home 

Gone 

It's all but a farewellâ¨
If only I could not blame myself 
I will not back downâ¨
To where my hopes have dwelled 
The moon shines red tonight 
Nothing will bring you back 
Hoping for a new tomorrow 

I'm frighten nowâ¨
I don't know howâ¨
I'm standing aloneâ¨
I lost my homeâ¨
Seeking something rare 
Forgotten to be wise 
You're my edelweiss 

Endless nightmares 
My shadow stares 
At the man I am notâ¨
At least I thought 
Since you're gone
My inside dies 
You were my edelweiss 

It's all but a farewellâ¨
If only I could not blame myself 
I will not back downâ¨
To where my hopes have dwelled 
The moon shines red tonight 
Nothing will bring you back 
Hoping for a new tomorrow 

I'm frighten nowâ¨
I don't know howâ¨
I'm standing aloneâ¨
I lost my homeâ¨
Seeking something rare 
Forgotten to be wise 
You're my edelweiss 

Endless nightmares 
My shadow stares 
At the man I am notâ¨
At least I thought 
Since you're gone
My inside dies 
You were my edelweiss 

Edelweiss
