[Bonus Track]When I died just seconds ago, I then reawoke. I fight the burning inside.
Nothing seems the same. The night is brighter, the sky is vibrant. I need to
feed, my cruel intentions haunting me. I lust for one thing: the source of all
life that flows through our veins. It bleeds from our hearts, it pumps through
our brain. Fight with all your might. You have been left to die. I call upon my
inner strength to fight away the pain. My weakening body fights against my
brain. Fight with all your might. The lust has become too much. Let the hunt
commence, for tonight is a feast I won't forget. For tonight and forevermore I
dine on blood.
