Eradicate the greed and lust for power. We are in a race against time to keep our throats from being slit just for wanting to speak our minds. Persecute those whom which do not abide. Full on Marshall Law. Putrification of the population. We are our own worst enemy. The existence of man has hit its peak. We are upon the downfall. Follow orders to someone who considers you expendable. Lives are worth less than a dollar. Striving to create a perfect world. So end this fucking world.
