I feel buried
Suffocating on the dust
Falling through the cracks into my mouth

Cough out the sick
It will never work this way
Gutted by the emptiness I have inside me
Knowing, seeing all this beauty around me

Nothing will ever change that
The light inside me is dim
The wick has hit the floor
Snuffing itself out
This world's a motherfucker
You're just stuck in it
Pull the chair
Gasp for air
Snuffing yourself out
The looks I get
These bags under my eyes
It doesn't eat at me anymore
It's a part of me
No working through this sickness
No searching for a cure

Cough out the sick
It will never work this way
Gutted by the emptiness I have inside me
Knowing, seeing all this beauty around me
