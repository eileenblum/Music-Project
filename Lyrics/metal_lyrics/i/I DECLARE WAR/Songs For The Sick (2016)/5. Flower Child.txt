I wasn't a flower child, I was a mistake
A one night stand with a faceless man
I'm the excrement of a poor decision

Never to give the guidance in the right direction
I'm the floater, the faceless, the excrement
Search the lands, try to find just one man
How deep does one hunt
'Till the search is deemed worthless
The head sitting on my shoulders is filled with sick
I wish that I could vomit out my discontent
A dime, a dozen, throw another one overboard

Pull the chord
Nothing's going to change
Make amends, understand you are never going to find him

Bury the thoughts
No remorse, someday you'll learn
He is gone
This faceless man to never return
Cut the chord, time will blur your discontent
Soon enough you will learn to live life without them
Depths of disgust, some for the better, some for worse
No one will know your pain without a father

Pull the chord
Nothings going to change
Make amends, understand you are never going to find him

Let it go
A life filled with horrid thoughts
This depression left you out in the cold
Life goes on, for the better, for the worse
You can let it stew or bury it in the past
