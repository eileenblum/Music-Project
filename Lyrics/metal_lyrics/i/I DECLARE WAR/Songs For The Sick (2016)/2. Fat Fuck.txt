You consume
It makes me fucking sick
You're like a cancer I feel I can never kick

A dark cloud raining on our parade
We will remove you
I wish we could bury you
Suck on your vapor dick one more time
Skin, dope, sick, a fucking waste of life
Inhail some more disgusting shit
Wash it down consume some more you fucking dick
Restless legs of a wasted fucking space
Tired eyes you fiend for anything
Outburst won't get you what you want
Grown ass man baby you fat fuck
We've seen it all before and still you seem to blow my mind
You're a coward you piece of shit
You hide behind your child as if you give a shit
Fend for yourself, grow the fuck up
Suck on your vapor dick you fat fuck
