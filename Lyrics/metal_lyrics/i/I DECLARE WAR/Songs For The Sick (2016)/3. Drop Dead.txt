If I drop dead tonight
I am going down in flames
You best believe I am taking a few of you with me
I can't explain the angst in my mind

It's something that I can't quite get away from
It makes me itch it makes me sick
Lock me in a room
Don't ever let me leave
I don't care about anyone or anything
Get the fuck away from me
Tired eyes I barely sleep
There is something rotting in my head
It's killing me
Where did I go wrong
I played my cards right
I stayed the course
I allowed you to walk all over me
It's making me sick
Now I'm sitting in a ditch

If I drop dead tonight
I am going down in flames
You best believe I am taking a few of you with me
I can't explain the angst in my mind

Lock and load
You don't want to be anywhere near me
I got a blood thirst I can't seem to explain

If I drop dead tonight
I am going down in flames
You best believe I am taking a few of you with me
I can't explain the angst in my mind
