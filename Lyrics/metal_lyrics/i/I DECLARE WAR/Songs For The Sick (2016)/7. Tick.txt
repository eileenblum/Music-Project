It started out years ago
Long before he ever fucking knew
The mind slows brought on with age
It breaks you down, it rips you to shreds
Tired eyes, a broken man
Thoughts blur with a fucked up head

Dead tired he feels like a slave
Constantly battling with his own head
Loss of words you can't stand straight
The sickness is spreading to his brain
This hard working man
A father, bread winner
Stricken with his pain
No cure for his disease

It's digging it's way in
It burrows like a tick
Everyone around him sees it
He think he's doing fine

Mood swings control him now
He screams, wishing he could die 

Mood swings control him now
He screams, wishing he could die 

Violent outburst, he can barely stand
This once strong man, is now a boy again

He now screams all day
Every fucking night
Kicking and screaming
No cure in sight

He lays and waits to die
