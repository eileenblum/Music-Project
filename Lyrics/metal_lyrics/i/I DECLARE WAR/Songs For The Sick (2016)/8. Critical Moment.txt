Create a void within yourself
Locking everyone out
Shut yourself out to the world
Becoming numb from within
Slow your thinking down
Don't let your mind race
It only makes things worse

Your long life has led up to this critical moment
Think fucking hard
This could be the last time you could try to turn it all around
Breathe in
Bask in your surroundings
You can almost feel the Earth spinning
All washed up
Worn to the bone
Filled with all these fears and insecurities

Leave me alone

Insecurities are filling in my head
I feel like they are dragging me down
It's a sickness rotting in my gut
For fuck's sake leave me alone
Your long life has led up to this critical moment
