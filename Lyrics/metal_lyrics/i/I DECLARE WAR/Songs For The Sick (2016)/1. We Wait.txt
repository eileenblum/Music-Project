We wait to die
I'm sick on the inside
My head is fucked
No motive left
I couldn't give a fuck
I don't like what I am anymore
What've I become
I am broken
Throw me down
Leave me behind
This whole place has burnt me
Mindless bodies
Soulless eyes
Never sleeping fear sits inside of me
Rattling around constantly making me sick
No one cares
Rotting on the inside
No one cares anymore
So why the fuck should I

I am the sickness
I am the cure
I control the light inside my heart [2x]

No control over my body
My head is fucked
At times I wonder why I should take it anymore

I can't stand it [2x]

Shadows haunt me they live inside my mind
Sometimes they speak to me
Sometimes they cry
Bury me allow me to sleep
My heads fucked I cant breathe
Alone in this world
Sickness lives inside of me
Throw it all out 
Nothing matters anymore
Don't hold me down when I try to find peace
Alone I sit
Waiting for my head to finish me
Walk into the light
Never fear for eternal peace
