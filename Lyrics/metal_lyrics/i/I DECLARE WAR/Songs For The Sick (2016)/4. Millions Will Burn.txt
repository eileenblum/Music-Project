It rips into the flesh
Cutting straight through the bone with a heat so intense
The sun pales in comparison

Leaving not even bone but dust
Shadows burnt into cement from the flash
No human should experience this
This flash of heat on the flesh
Dropped from a faceless man travelling supersonic

Millions will burn
Flesh turned to bone
Bone turns to dust

Radiation sits on these grounds
Making all exposed sick
Mass suicide relieves all this pain
Circulating through their bodies
Leaving not even bone but dust
Shadows burnt into cement from the flash

Millions will burn
Flesh turned to bone
Bone turns to dust
