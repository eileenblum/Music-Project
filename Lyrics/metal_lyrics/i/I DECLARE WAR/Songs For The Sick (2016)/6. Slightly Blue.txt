He was just hanging there
Stretched out and slightly blue
The look on his face will never leave my mind
It was in his eyes
A cold yet a comfort we strive for
You could see he planned this for quite some time
Clean shaven his hair slicked back
Thought was taken in his final desperate times
Sick man thoughts sink in
Desperate to cling onto his miserable life
Sick man thoughts sink in
Desperate to cling onto it

Walk out to the woods desperate and tired
Walk out to the woods sick and tired

Silent and alone he tries to drink his way out
Nothing left but this pain
His mind spins into fits of rage
Black jacket with mud on his shoes
He wears his story four feet high
Nothing left no soul in sight, no cold miserable life
Sick man thoughts sink in
Desperate to cling onto his miserable life
Sick man thoughts sink in
Desperate to cling onto it

Walk out to the woods desperate and tired
Walk out to the woods sick and tired
