As I wash. The blood from my hands. I wash all of. What you were away. You tried to fuck me. But I fucked you first. I'll dismember your body. Like a puzzle. As I tie your hands behind your back. You scream and beg me for my forgiveness. And I'll paint the walls with your fucking blood. Scarred. Watch the. Flesh rot. A stagnant corpse. For all to see. No tears will be shed. Six feet under. So rest your head. So fuck all your shit. And I'll bury you deep. This will be the point. Of all your deceit. Grab the knife. Cut it slow. Eat the flesh. To quench my thirst. Grab the knife. Cut the flesh. Devour your entrails. To quench my undying thirst.
