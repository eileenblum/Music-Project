It's a lovely night for something to go wrong. Can't you see those clouds? They are spelling disaster. This will be your last night on earth. This night will not be forgotten. Until everyone lies dead. As the angels lay broken beneath the ashes. MASSACRE. Watch the people as they burn alive for freedom. Watch the people as they burn alive for fucking freedom.
