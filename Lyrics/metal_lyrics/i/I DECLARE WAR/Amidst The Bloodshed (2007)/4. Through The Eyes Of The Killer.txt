On a cold and silent night, something strange grasped the air, reeking of the smell of death. Stalking his victims. Hoping. Preying on the weak. Surrender yourself, it's over. You won't feel a thing. Death is upon you. It's far too late to save her now. He strikes again. Made into a killer. No one else understands. Fighting his urges for the taste of the fresh blood. Why can no one else see? Let all of them bleed. Through the eyes. Through the eyes of a killer. No one's safe, he must kill. As she dies, he won't cry.
