On a cold and silent night
Something strange grasping air
Stalking his victims
Hoping
Preying on the weak
Surrender
Yourself it's over
You won't feel a thing
Death is upon you

It's far too late
To save her now
He strikes again
Made into a killer
No one else understands
Fighting his urges for
The taste of the fresh blood
Why can no one else see

Let all of them bleed

Through the eyes
Through the eyes of a killer
No one's safe
He must kill

As she dies
He won't cry
