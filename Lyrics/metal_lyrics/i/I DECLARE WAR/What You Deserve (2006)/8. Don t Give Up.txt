You were the best
Now you're gone
You were so blessed
Missing you so much
Substances were your crutch
Death came so fast
Life flew right past

I miss those times
Seems so long ago
You said this was forever
We were so close

I did my best
To save you
No one can help you now

Save yourself
Just for once
Don't get left behind
I would die for you

Forever means never
Take this all back
Don't give up
You were so close
