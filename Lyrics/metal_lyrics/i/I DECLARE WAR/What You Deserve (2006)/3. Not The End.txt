Don't let go of these memories
Thinking back tears me apart
I would destroy you if I could
You are a waste of air
People need to see how you really are
You are a waste of time
Your time will soon be running out
You will fucking die

You spineless bitch
Turn your back and run
From all your problems
But this won't end here
I will kill all in my way
Nothing's left but a trace
And what you've become
Your time is near
This you must fear

Reap what you sow
Now is your time
Slit your wrists
Give into this
End it all now

As I sit and laugh
I won't feel sorrow
Moving on with my with my life
You tried to win this old fight
But it's all over now
And so is your life

You will die
It's your time
