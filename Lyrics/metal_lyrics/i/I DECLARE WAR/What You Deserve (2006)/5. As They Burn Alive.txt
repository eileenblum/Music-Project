It's a lovely night
For something to go wrong
Can't you see those clouds?
They are spelling disaster
This will be your last night on earth
This night will not be forgotten
Until everyone lies dead

As the angels lay broken beneath the ashes

MASSACRE

Watch the people
As they burn alive
For freedom
Watch the people
As they burn alive
For fucking freedom
