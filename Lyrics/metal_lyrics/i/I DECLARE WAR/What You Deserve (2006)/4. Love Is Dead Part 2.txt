Two people fall for every one with a shotgun
You are my beautiful
You are my everything
This shotgun knows no mercy
You were my beautiful
You were my everything
Watching you die slowly
I show no compassion
This life you destroyed
I hope you're happy now

There will be no mercy

There will be no mercy for you

And if I could kill
You would be the first
Tear out your heart
See the fake emotions
Hidden by your lies
Of a false reality
Bitch

Tear out your heart
See the fake emotions
Hidden by your lies
Of a false reality
You fucking bitch
