Uuuuaaaaaahhhhhh
Close your eyes
And simply fall into eternal, accept it, relax your mind

We were not all built for this world, a violent species we have become.
Misery in life breeds torture for everyone.
You bring out the misery in everyone.

The noose awaits you

Not everyone is built for this world. Don't fight the pain any longer.
The noose awaits you. Close your eyes. The noose awaits you
We all die! The noose awaits you. Don't try to fight the pain any longer
The noose awaits you

Uuuuaaaaaahhhhhh
Close your eyes
And simply fall into eternal, accept it, relax your mind

Dead to the world. Lifeless in the air.
Sleep becomes the eternal. The noose awaits you
