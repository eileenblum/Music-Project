Dead on the ground
You're going to fucking rot
No reason you should be alive
It's fucking disgusting
Human filth stewing in your own piss and shit
A violent hatred
No conflict of nature
As a whole it makes me fucking sick

Close your eyes
It's human fucking nature
To stab those you love in the back
Wallow in your own self pity
You disastrous human pile of shit

Kill, kill, kill yourself
Disgusting human vile piece of shit
Our putrid stench, it wafts in the air
The devil has a hold of your soul
There is nothing that's going to get it back

My hope is gone. For now I sit and watch.

Close your eyes
It's human fucking nature
To stab those you love in the back
Wallow in your own self pity
You disastrous human pile of shit

Your lifeless limp body
Buried halfway in the ground
Your lifeless limp body
Buried halfway in the ground
