We butcher the weak, destroying the next generation.
Killing everything in our god damned path.
What a violent species we've become.
It's our nature to kill everything we love.

We are violent people by nature...
Killing everything in our god damned path.
Breeding human filth. It's a sickness [x2]
Breeding human filth. It's a sickness (sickness)
BLEGH!

Shit on this world we've been given.
Murder, rape, and kill.
All hope is lost and we refuse to admit it.
We are no more than the doomsday children.

Mass extensions must happen to start over.
We must see the pledge of human nature.

Wipe the fucking slate clean!
We are destroying everything!

We are violent people by nature...
Killing everything in our god damned path. [x2]

Breeding human filth. It's a sickness [x4]
