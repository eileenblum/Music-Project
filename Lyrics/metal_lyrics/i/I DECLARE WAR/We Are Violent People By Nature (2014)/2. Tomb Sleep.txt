These Dreams, They are so dark and vivid.
They seem as if they could be true.

Kicking and Screaming, heavy breathing.
Gasping for air as I awake.

Sleeping but I'm not dreaming. It feels like I am suffocating.

Cry Out Nothing, dying to awake. All hope is fading.
Oh god let me awake! Trapped inside this nightmare. I can't breathe.
These dreams, they are so dark and vivid. They seem as if they
could be true. Trapped in my own mind.

Crying out with no one to help.
Once again re awake from this nightmare. Nothings changed.
Still trapped inside your head. Suffocate! Dying every night.
Back to sleep. Eventually we all die.
