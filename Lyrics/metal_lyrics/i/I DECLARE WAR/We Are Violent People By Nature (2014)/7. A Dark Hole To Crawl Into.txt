[feat. Landon Tewers of The Plot in You]This distance I find myself living with. This consciousness is nothing that could be imagined.
I often feel as if I have died, depriving myself of a real life.

Crawl into a hole. Curl up in a ball
All faith is dead. Crawling out of my skin!
Deprived of a real life. I think I would rather die

This distance I find myself living with. This consciousness is nothing that could be imagined.
I often feel as if I have died, depriving myself of a real life.

I must let go. Crawl into a dark hole
Give up all hope. Let go!

I've lost all hope. Let go! Deprive myself. Let go! Trapped inside this hole

I'm falling apart
Deprived of my senses. Tearing myself apart.
Poison my brain. Driving me insane

This distance I find myself living with. This consciousness is nothing that could be imagined.
I often feel as if I have died, depriving myself of a real life.

Give up all hope. Let go! I've lost all hope. Let go! Deprive myself. Let go! Trapped inside this hole
