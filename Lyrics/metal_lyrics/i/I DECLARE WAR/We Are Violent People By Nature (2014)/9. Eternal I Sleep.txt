This, this dark cloud, this uninspiring place
I have been damned to spend my days
Eternity filled with pain

It's stricken my insides, filled me with pus and tar
Gag on the phlegm that angers. It engulfs my life
Don't try and fight it. It controls my life

I do not close my eyes

This, this dark cloud, this uninspiring place
Rip out my lungs take me away from this place

I am alone destined to drive myself insane
My mind races faster, suicide ends this pain

Tear myself down. Rip myself apart!

Deprived of my senses. Tearing myself apart
The end is drawing nearer. I can feel it in my skin

I dig deeper. Digging my own grave
Darkness comes for me. I go out my own way

This, this dark cloud, this uninspiring place
Rip out my lungs take me away from this place

Gasp my final words. Take me from this fucking place
Forever I sleep. I find eternal peace

This dark cloud, this uninspiring place.
