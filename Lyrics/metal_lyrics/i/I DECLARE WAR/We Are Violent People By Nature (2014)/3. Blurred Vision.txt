I have this hatred building up inside of me. It's like nothing
I have ever felt. It overwhelms me to the point I can't stand.

This aggression is digging it's way in deeper.
It's a pain I have been forced to live with. Blurred Visions.
Force this state of depression. I counter act it with aggression.

End yourself. Turn your back to the world.
Lose all hope. Forget everyone. Life's a joke. We were born to die.
End yourself. Just close your fucking eyes.

This aggression burrows itself in deeper.
Close your eyes and let it all fade to black.
Nothing is going to change. We are no more.
Than disgusting human waste.

End yourself. Turn your back to the world.
Lose all hope. Forget everyone. Life's a joke.
We were born to die. End yourself.
Just close your fucking eyes.

We the sick, we were born to do no more than die.
Walk out to the woods and take your own life.
