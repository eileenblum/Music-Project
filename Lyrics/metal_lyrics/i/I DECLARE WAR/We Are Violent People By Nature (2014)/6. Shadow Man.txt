I shot the devil in the back
He follows me follows me everywhere I run

A dark cloud over my heavy head
You can hear his footsteps in the silence of the night

His dark and vile presence
I can feel him as he creeps through the shadows

His putrid stench can only be smelled by those haunted
He sometimes whispers in my ear

I feel him picking at my brain
He's always picking at my brain!
I shot the devil in the back
He follows me follows me everywhere I run

A dark cloud over my heavy head
It's such a dark cloud

He will not leave without you
You live your life out in torture
