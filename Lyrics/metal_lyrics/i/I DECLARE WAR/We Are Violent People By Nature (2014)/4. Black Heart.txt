Puke a black hole into the earth. Rip everything that you
love to shreds. Take this anger and contempt and
bury it til it erupts courtesy of life.

I wish I had the guys to break my own neck. Dig in deep
and tear out my own fucking heart. No grasp left on life.
Days spent rotting from the inside. Disgust is the last emotion
I have left. My sickness now rules my whole life.

Vomit and pus fills inside me. All I ever feel is discontent.

It's a sickness we are born with

Puke a black hole into the earth. Rip everything that you
love to shreds. It's a sickness we were born with! I would
rip out my own heart if I had the guts. Coward! Coward! Coward!
