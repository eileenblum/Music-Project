Bunch of flowers fade falling into a grave
Losing light, losing weight, they go to meet their fate

Inside lying me, just half I perceive
Losing light, losing weight, now endlessly free

Something happens up and down
My fantasy works at full speed under ground
Earth's shielding my body like black snow
My thoughts miss any rational basis, my organs glow

Inside lying me, just half I perceive
Losing light, losing weight, now endlessly free

With a raging face God lies the next place
I hear him turn in his grave like all other days

Something happens up and down
My fantasy works at full speed under ground
Earth's shielding my body like black snow
My thoughts miss any rational basis, my organs glow

Sign of New Dark leaves you far from the mark
Where I see you run through the solitary land
Night falls down
Deep cold waters flow
Under earth on which you're dying slow
Where I see you lie on the solitary ground
Waiting,... good bye.

Bunch of flowers fade falling into a grave
Losing light, losing weight, going to their fate

My elder sister goes to burn my things and clothes
Fire flares against the Moon
Feel my time coming slow

Something happens up and down
My fantasy works at full speed under ground
Earth's shielding my body like black snow
My thoughts miss any rational basis, my organs glow

[M.I., B. II, Ps. V, 92-122]
