Clouds are heavy, clouds feel to be strong
Clouds creep slowly towards the Sun
And the sea in decay will overflow its shore
And light will be extinguished for thousands of years

Clouds are mighty, clouds rule space
Clouds laugh at my frightened face
And the sea in decay will overflow its shore
And light will be extinguished for thousands of years

Clouds bury light, revive shades
Clouds serve to our desperate fate
And the sea in decay will overflow its shore
And light will be extinguished for thousands of years

Clouds silently take their way
Clouds presage our Judgement Day
And the sea in decay will overflow its shore
And light will be extinguished for thousands of years

Evil minds cover all the sky
Evil souls challenge my blind eyes
I would never believe the Sun is too weak to defy
All evil ever seen has been incarnated into clouds
