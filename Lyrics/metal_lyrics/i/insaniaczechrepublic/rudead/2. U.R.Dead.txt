When you close your eyes and see just fragments of your past
When you start to speak to yourself, when you start to lie
When your brain, when your hands don't need to be occupied
When trees and hills all of a sudden start to talk to you
When you start to see time
When you look to the ground
When you like solitude
When you feel shades around... U.R.DEAD

When your night seems too long to you and your day too short
When your fancy stops wondering about the sense of life
When your sleep is disturbed by no schizophrenic dreams
When the river everyday is calling you to come
When you start to see time
When you look to the ground
When you like solitude
When you feel shades around... U.R.DEAD

When eyes of yours are not afraid of dark any more
When you begin every evening to hail setting sun
When flying buzzard does not evoke envy in you
When you start to doubt the existence of evil
When you start to see time
When you look to the ground
When you like solitude
When you feel shades around... U.R.DEAD

[Myth Insania, Book II, Psalm VII, Verse 153-176]
