Lying in dreams, I rip through iron dreams
Waiting for falling star of sanity
Beating prophet's heart
Blind machines' black screams
Breaking out of the narrow space of sanity, saying:
Psychic sore never more
Upside down ballistic floor
Endless water, endless shore
That leads you close to death

Moving down this way people go and pray
Rounding all the time they circle everyday
Shrieking melancholy sonorating among hills
Forests, woods, trees, rivers, sky
Vibrating with mountains' shrill, saying:
Psychic sore never more
Upside down ballistic floor
Endless water, endless shore
That leads you close to death

Swarms of waned stars breach eternity
Fade into black, lose identity
Negation of vanity, anti-logic quality

Looking at the sky you're watching your mind fly
Floating untouched by sane truth
Therefore will never die
Coming stellar light, evil dark flying free
Running speeding time that brings you close to end, saying:
Psychic sore never more
Upside down ballistic floor
Endless water, endless shore
That leads you close to death

[M.I., B. II, Ps. II, 9-38]
