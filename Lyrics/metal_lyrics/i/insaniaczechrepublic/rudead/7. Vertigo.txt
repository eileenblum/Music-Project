Flames burn, sneak to my eyes
I stand on the brim of a crater and cry
My eyes drip to lava, what life says is lie
I look down at hot streams
Suddenly my head swims 
I don't feel my body, I don't feel my mind
To fly away and forget all these lies
I long to fly away with you, just let me close my eyes
I long to be, long to flee, with you I long to fly
From this world I long to fade away, from this world I long to die

Like a shade, lame, I climb the slope
I bleed, flow, wade through stones
My eyes drip to lava, what life says is lie
I look down at hot streams
Suddenly my head swims 
I don't feel my body, I don't feel my mind
To fly away and forget all these lies
I long to fly away with you, just let me close my eyes
I long to be, long to flee, with you I long to fly
From this world long to fade away, from this world long to die

In my sense, in my core, in my voice, in my roar
Something's whirling, extinguished fire spouts choking smoke
My soul's burning in fire, I am fading like snow

In my blood, in my ego I can feel vertigo
Something's whirling, extinguished fire spouts choking smoke
My soul's burning in fire, I am fading like snow

In my hand snow burns
I break through ice and defy the glare
My eyes drip to lava, what life says is lie
I look down at hot streams
Suddenly my head swims 
I don't feel my body, I don't feel my mind

[M.I., B. II, Ps. III, 39-70]
