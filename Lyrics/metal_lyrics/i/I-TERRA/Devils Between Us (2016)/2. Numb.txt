For I am the worst of my kind
Don't let me get in your head
Once I fester inside
There will be no sign of you left

You will not survive
Its already far too late
A mutilated mess
A mirrored maniacal grin
I want you suffering
Til the bitter end

For I am relentless
I want what beats inside your chest
A disease incurable
You will beg me for every breath

Ripping, shredding, tearing
You the fuck a part
It wants the body and the soul
Let's see which falters first

When hope dies within you
Will you resist or betray your convictions?
These thoughts enslave me
Oh how they enslaves me

Clouded in misery
And without cause

Your veins fill with defeat
Eyes lifeless as you struggle to breathe
You struggle to breathe [2x]

Will it prevail and conquer?
Will you rot and decay?
Will you fight for your fucking life?
Or give way to the grave
With only yourself to blame
