Life is infinite if you just
Allow yourself to see
We are all ominous 
And stand far too lightly
But I'll push and follow through
I'll find my sanity in the rabbit hole
While you discover you
While you discover you

But this is all a lesson
And its all at my discretion
The ceiling is my only perception

I never thought that I would be
Hidden beneath the floor
In such a panic
And begging for more

I know there's truth to all of this
I wonder if its relevant
I wrote the answers along the wall
But you never read them

We play with the thoughts
But never push the boundaries
Strength is earned and hard to keep
I always dream outside of sleep

It makes my head spin
My lungs so heavy
My heart sinks lower and lower
Lower, lower, lower, and lower again [2x]

The only corner of the universe
You can be sure of improving
Is that of your own self
