I hear the crashing of waves
I feel their desire and doubt
Of ebb and flow yet so much more
The salt burns open wounds
Calming the fear

Where had I gone?
Where was I headed?
A sky of cowardice
A universe of... [2x]

Now a downward spiral
How will we ever survive
Here we go again
Aesthetics fuel beliefs
Trading souls for comfortability
Let the end begin

How inventive of you
Blueprints buried deep
I'll forget this 'til I sleep
Let the end begin

Where had they been?
Where were they going?
A grave of nostalgia
A glimpse of purity [2x]

Where did they go?
Where were headed?
Don't rely on forever 
Where had they been?
Where were they going?
Don't rely on forever [2x]

Where had they been?
Where were they going?
Don't rely on forever
