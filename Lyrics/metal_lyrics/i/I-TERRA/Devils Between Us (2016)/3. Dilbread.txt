This is debauchery of the mind
Letting the filth out from the inside
Animalistic by design
I wanna fucking tear you a part
Make you scream right from the start
We lose ourselves in the dark

Give in to me, as I give into you [2x]
This is where we lose ourselves

I love our little games
We resist but it always ends the same
We're lifeless inside

With hands around our throats
Clawing at the skin
There never was innocence
Only the taste of blood and sin
We crave the taste of blood and sin

Hate fuck
I'll show you what it means

And those shakes that you feel at the end
Oh those shakes that you feel at the end

Up against the wall
When life has no meaning
When we're dead inside
Debauchery of the mind
