You warm the hearts of the world 
Yet sink them all the same
You'll blame everyone else 
Before you ever put yourself down
What's your pathetic excuse now
You're pathetic

Your sickness is sickening
Your sickness sickens me

You're a fallacy
A hollow trend
You won't last
Never be heard from again

Never write another worthless song

You could add depth to the sound
But your notes hold no weight [2x]

You disgraceful waste
You disgrace me 
You disgrace us all

Your ego betrays you
Your ego will bury you

Ego
