[feat. Lucy Lenoir of Apothica]Never in my life would I have thought I'd be surrounded
By so many fiends trying their best to eat me alive
Maybe I should give in and become the monster you named
But I will not succumb to this catastrophe

[Lucy:]
How have I been so blind
Wasted life in wasted time
Carrying this emptiness forever inside
I won't forget-I won't forgive
I never saw it coming
I got so good at running
Uncover my blind eyes to the truth
The worst deceiver I know is you

You've called me worthless
Going nowhere fast-I'll never change
You've filled my head with lies
You broke me down and kept me low
I won't die in these mistakes I've made

No never in my life would I have thought it would come to this
But if you want a war
You'll get your fucking war
This is the time and the perfect place
Here's your fucking war
Now

I've dreamt of the day I leave you
Bleeding on the floor
Come and face me you fucking cowards
No remorse-no regrets
This is ends here and now

[Lucy:]
More power than you have ever seen
Maybe some day you'll find your own identity
Drowning faster in a life
You've created and despised

You'll eat every blasphemous word
You're branded a traitor
What you saw in my eyes wasn't close to hurt
Just remember your branded forever

This has been a long time coming
When I finally call you out [2x]

Did you really think I'd just lie down
Let you push me back in the grave
But you see I am not a ghost
And I won't just fade
Did you really think I'd never make a sound
Let you defile my name
I can't believe I let it go
For so long you got away
Did you really think I'd just lie down
Let you push me back in the grave

[Lucy:]
Twisting and turning
These thoughts and memories
Repeating and echoing inside broken dreams

You'll eat every fucking word you've said
I won't ever forgive-I won't ever forget
I won't ever forgive-I won't ever forget

I get what's mine
(I get what's mine)
Cutting flesh from swine
(Cutting flesh from swine)
This time you pay deceiver
