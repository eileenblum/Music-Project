[music: Stavian, lyrics: Boeru]

In deep tombs of gold sleep
Bodies of great men and women.
While their bones rot in the ground,
Their spirits fly, transcending time.

I shall die,
But that's all that I'll do for death.
I shall live
Beyond my grave, beyond my death.
I am looking for the face I had
Before my previous end!

In deep tombs of gold sleep
Bodies of holy men and women.
Behind them an empty cross
Haunted by oblivion.

In deep lassitude I sink
And by my side are many people.
The life is but a darkened sea,
I sleep my life, I live my death.
