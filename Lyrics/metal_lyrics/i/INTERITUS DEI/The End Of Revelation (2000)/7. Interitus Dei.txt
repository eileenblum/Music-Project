[music and lyrics: Boeru]

How easy is to throw up venom
And to drag our name in mud?
Have you forgotten the taste of shit?
Have you forgotten your name?

We're not like you!
We have our path.
You're the snake who bites
The hand that saves its life!
"Donec eris felix, multos numerabis amicos
Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris!"
[-Ovidius]

You cannot erase our memory
With your empty words!
We're INTERITUS DEI!
We're beyond your words,
We're beyond your strength,
We are what we are!
We're INTERITUS DEI!

Do you remember when you needed our help?
We were always there for you.
So quick you turned your back on us!..
Have you forgotten your name?
