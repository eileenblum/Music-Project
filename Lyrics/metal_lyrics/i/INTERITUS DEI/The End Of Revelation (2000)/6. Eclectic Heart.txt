[music and lyrics: Costea]

I touch your soul in silence,
I feel your sins in my arms.
My wings are heavy,
I can't fly.
Your eyes are turned to darkness,
Your heart is full of  sadness
So let me heal
Your broken mind.

I came from heaven for you,
Now I can see right through,
Your pagan heart
Is way too sad.
I know your world is lost,
There is no holy ghost,
There is no chance to raise the dead.

Show me the way,
Teach me what's right,
Show me the truth,
We'll never set apart.
Show me a sign,
Guide me to light,
And guard the path
Of my eclectic heart!
