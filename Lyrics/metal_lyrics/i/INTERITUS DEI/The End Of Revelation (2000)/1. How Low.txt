[music: Costea, lyrics: Boeru]

You're lost between darkness and light,
Spiting empty words of hate.
Now you know I am your fear
Lying in wait for your mistakes.
Forever prisoner of shadow,
You're doomed to live your life in pain.
I always lived behind your eyes
To control your life, to be my toy.

How low can you go?
You are crawling down below.
Take a blow  'cause you know
I'm looking down on you!

I am the Sodom of your thoughts,
The voice who screams to blow your brain,
I'm the whip, I am the snake,
I'm your apple and your Eve.
"Obey me, slave!" I slap your face
Until your blood mixes with  tears
And the sound of your knees hitting the sand,
Speaks for itself, old fuckin' friend!

I'm the Sodom of your thoughts,
The voice who screams to blow your brain.
Now you know I am your fear
Lying in wait for your mistakes.
How low can you go?
And the sound of your knees hitting the sand,
Speaks for itself, old fuckin' friend!
