[music and lyrics: Boeru]

Inside me live together
Angels and demons.
Inside me lay together
Earth, heaven and hell.

Through my veins flows a Styx of emotions,
While in my head lays the Moon.
In my eyes lives, in a cyclic motion,
The ancient icon of the Universe.

Inside me grows together
Fire and ice.
Inside me run together
Suns and planets.

In my heart lays a poisoned weed
Which ceaselessly grows and grows
And which hides, which hides the seed
From where the man will blow up.

I am the Universe, I am the only source,
I am the Alpha, I am the Omega.
I'm the future and the past,
'Cause my ego will last
Forever!
