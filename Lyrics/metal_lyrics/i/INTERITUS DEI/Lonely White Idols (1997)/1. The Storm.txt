[music: Tentu/Boeru, lyrics: Boeru]

In my dreams, I dream that I died,
I'm landed on a rocky shore
Haunted by waves and winds,
Where as the sand I lay.

And U hear the storm!
Oh, I hear the storm!

Cold hands as winter winds
Untie my being. They set me free.
And cold storms from outside
Grasp my shell, becoming me.

I feel the moonlight dead as I am
And withered leaves in the wind
Floating through the land of nowhere
As my life is lost in time.

And my life is gone
And I hear the storm!

Frozen winds cut my breath,
So I can taste the death.
