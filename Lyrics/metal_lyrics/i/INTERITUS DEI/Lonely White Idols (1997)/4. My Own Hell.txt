[music: Tentu, lyrics: Boeru]

Incandescent blood
Flows through my veins
As a mad volcano blows
Its entrails.

I accept that blasphemy
Called "my life"
While I close deep inside me
My own hell.

My betrayed heart
Is doomed to feel
All my emotions and my life.

When I look inside my heart,
I discover my own hell.

My own hell will rise,
My own hell will last,
My own hell will burn.
I'm my own hell.

I am used to burn
Inside my own hell
And the fire is fed
By my life.
