[music: Tentu, lyrics: Boeru]

Standing still
Through the ages,
Throwing shadows
To the lowlands,
Standing tall
When the winds blow,
Lonely white idols
Rust on pedestals.

The solitude kills
Even the immortal ones.
When will they regain their powers?
When will they be strong again?

Heroic times which past
Worshiped them.
Why should gods of sadness
Undermine their strength?
Lonely white idols!
Lonely white idols!
Too fair to doubt the fate,
Too proud to face the hate!
