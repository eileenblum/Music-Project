[music and lyrics: Boeru]

Heroes of the darkened past,
Listen the tales of the wind
'Cause he has seen the history dying.

Times of glory and of swords,
Times of honor,
Living idols, blood and steel,
All these are gone.

Heroic times, just heroic times,
Lost through the ages.

Riding wild horses on the fields,
Tongues if flames
Kissing swords and shields
And burn the days of the ones who die.

Why is so heroic
To die for an aim?
Maybe because we have no faith.
Why it seems heroic
To worship a bone idol?
Maybe because our god died.
