[music and lyrics: Costea]

The flapping of my wings,
Alone in bed she sings.
Like the king of the night
I fly off reality
And I know
Our souls will stay together
This feeling lives forever
Just like a curse

Flying so low around me
One hundred eyes glow inside me
Draining my blood
Like the bats in my attic.
Like darkness they show around me
One hundred eyes glow inside me!
Bats in the attic

I pierce her tender skin
I'm dragging her in sin.
She's still alive
But she is now in my control
And I know or souls will stay together,
This feeling lives forever
Just like a curse
