[music and lyrics: Boeru]

Centuries ago we were placed on a marble pedestal
By those who searched for us in heaven,
Not thinking that we lived behind their eyes.

We used to die and be reborn,
We spent eternity in ivory thrones,
We always came with the spring
And we tasted the nectar of kings.
But mortals turned the altars into dust,
The old gods were suddenly left to rust
For the promise of the afterlife,
The fear of the afterlife.

Watch them quietly disappear
When all gods asked for volunteers!
Watch them disobey
And the holy rains will have to pay
For their fear!

The rain doesn't fall now as it used to fall once,
At the dawn of times.
Mortals fly hand in hand with angels in their dreams,
They forgot to touch the ground.
