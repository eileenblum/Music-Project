[music and lyrics: Costea]

The rain is falling down on me
Like the tears of an unborn child
Who knows the universe to come,
But aeons turned to ashes
As you first opened your eyes.
I've searched all the universe for you.

I am the eye of magic,
I am the thought flying too fast.
I am a corner to nowhere,
I am the ocean turned into moondust.

You look inside my heart
And you don't understand the sight.
An endless graveyard marks my soul.
You hide behind the lie
And try to ask me who I am.
But the stars whisper that...
