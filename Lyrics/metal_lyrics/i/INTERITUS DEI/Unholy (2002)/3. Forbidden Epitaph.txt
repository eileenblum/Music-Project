[music and lyrics: Boeru]

I am the undead, in vain you try to stop me.
In vain you've kill my flash
I hate you cause you hate me
I am the sum of your fears, unholy and always awake
I can smell your thoughts
I can hear your mind. I make no mistakes

Forbidden epitaph, whritten with upside down words!
Forbidden epitaph above an empty tomb
You're soulless and worthless
Nothing can stop you to die
Evil! Godless! Your own life makes you cry

Death and life are twins
So why do you love your life?
While worms will dig your corpse,
Your spirit will arise

I'll died but I'll come
As ghost to trouble your mind
Anger! Fury!
Against what I used to be

Above an empty tomb
The evil takes a look
I read the forbidden words
I call the unholy lords
I've carved the ancient curse on stone.
