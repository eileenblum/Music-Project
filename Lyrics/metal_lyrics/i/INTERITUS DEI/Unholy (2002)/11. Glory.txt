[music and lyrics: Boeru]

The night was long and the battle hard.
We faced death with courage and pride
We left the best of us behind
But the victory was on our side.

They called themselves crusaders.
The army of some new born god.
They tried to change our tradition
But we drowned their fate in flight.

In to the fire we roam
Straight in to hell and in to the storm.
Just like a curse, just like a sin.
Dragging their souls behind their skin.

For our fate
For our land
For our king,
We're ready to die.
Glory to the blood stained flag.
