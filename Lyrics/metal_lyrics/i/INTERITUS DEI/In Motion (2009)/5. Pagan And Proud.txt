[Music &amp; lyrics: Boeru]

On my knees,
I kiss the ground and pray
To defeat my enemies today.
For this, I spill a drop of blood,
A small gift for all my pagan gods.

Help me crush
The ramparts down and be
The last thing that my enemies will see.
For this, I spill a drop of blood,
A small gift for all my pagan gods.

I'm pagan and proud!
Let me shout it loud!
I'm pagan and proud!
Let me shout it loud!

And if I die,
Let it be on the battlefield,
Let the others carry me back on my shield,
Then, let me burn and help me fly,
Give me a star up in the sky.
