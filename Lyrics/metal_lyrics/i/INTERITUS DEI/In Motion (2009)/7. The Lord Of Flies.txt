[Music: Tentu, lyrics: Boeru]

The hell was full, so I came back.
I fought my way until I found a crack
Through your mind and through your soul.
I am the name that you are afraid to call.

A shadow coiled deep in your mind,
I am still one of a kind...
The fear made them hate my name,
So, this is how I became
The lord of flies!

I can't forget what I used to be,
How the people worshiped the soil fertility...
Even if a new religion threw me straight to hell,
I know that I'll always be the Zebul Beel.
