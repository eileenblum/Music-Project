[Music &amp; lyrics: Boeru]

Take two coins and put them
Upon your eyes,
Then be ready for the final journey
Far away from the promised sky.

You suffered hard, you suffered well...
Behind a happy mask, your tears can tell
That I'm right when I say:
"The life is hard and after that you pass away..."

Do you think that dying
Is ending the strife?
Hm! Then you must prepare yourself
For another slice of life...

'Cause everything is on its way to something.
In the afterlife this is what you'll see.
You wait for your death with an infinite emotion,
But even dead, you'll never cease to be
In motion!
