[Music &amp; lyrics: Boeru]

Fear is the weapon
Against all those
Who bow their heads!
What about your own choice?
What if you'll raise your voice?
What do you have to loose?
The silence is no excuse...

The blind follow the blind
And no one expects there is something to find.
A thief in the country of fools
Is a powerful king who makes his own rules.

Deny denial!
