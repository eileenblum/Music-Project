[Music: Tentu, lyrics: Boeru]

...And before you die,
Just remember this, my friend:
There's no noisy end.
Silently you'll say: "Good Bye!"
Still, between you lips,
I know there is a silent shout...
There are words about
Your personal apocalypse.

Rain of fire, baby!
Rain of fire,
Falling down deep into your head!
Rain of fire, baby!
Rain of fire,
A silent candle to watch your final end...

For the longest sleep,
The fire will be your only shroud.
Tears won't be allowed!
There's no point for you to weep.
In the final scene
Of this drama puppets show,
You won't even know
Why you burn and what's your sin.
