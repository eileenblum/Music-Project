[Music: Terente, lyrics: Boeru]

Strained, you hear the silent roar
Right before the storm!
Your ears are deaf,
But the sound is jabbed
Deep into your mind!

Deep into your mind!

Wait for something to come,
But you can't see a soul.
Like a prey, you feel
The raptors' breath.

You can feel that your end is near,
Strained, you wait to meet your doom.
You have no time to shed a tear.
On your skin, the blood in bloom...

Fear, coiled in your heart,
Like a starving worm...
You can't see the Death
Coming in your way.
