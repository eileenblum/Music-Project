[Music: Tentu, lyrics: Boeru]

A fallen soul, doomed to fail,
A broken wing, a shining scale...
The guardian, the keeper
Of the secret signs.
A crawling been, hiding into a hole,
The serpent of brass, put upon a pole...
Immortal... The symbol
Of the underworld.

The memories of the Snake,
An endless battle it never forsakes!
The beast coiled around the Sun
Is the weapon of the Pharaoh's crown.

Biting its tail, shedding its skin,
The heart is cold, but it burns within...
The cycle... The symbol
Of eternity.
