Funny how every time you push me away, you turn around and you beg me to stay
Cut down by the things you say, it's the beating of a broken drum
One of these days you'll push me away, turn around it'll be too late

Your love is addictive, trying hard just to quit it
But you're drowning yourself you won't catch a breath until you admit it
Is anybody out there, I'm dying in a nightmare
You got third degree burns and now it's your turn to feel what I feel
And if it don't hurt then you know what we got ain't real

Funny how every time you push me away, you turn around and you beg me to stay
Cut down by the things you say
One of these days you'll push me away, turn around it'll be too late

Your love is a monster, it's eating me alive
Let go of my hand you don't give a damn and it's killing me inside
You show me no mercy, did God make a mistake?
Put a hole in your heart and then you can start to feel what I feel
And if it don't hurt then you know what we got ain't real

Funny how every time you push me away, you turn around and you beg me to stay

One of these days you'll push me away, turn around it'll be too late
