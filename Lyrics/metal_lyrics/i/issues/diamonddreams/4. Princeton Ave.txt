What is a man, who lays a hand on his lover, and calls it tough love
What is a man, who can't take a stand for his daughter, and calls it tough love
Man enough to see man enough to see, there ain't a goddamn man in me

Take me back to a date, before I was hostile and learned to hate you

And I swear that it's just like fate would have it
That I would be different but I'm just like you
You swore you'd never become

What is a man, who lays a hand on his lover, and calls it tough love
What is a man, who can't take a stand for his daughter, and calls it tough love
Man enough to see man enough to see, there ain't a goddamn man in me

Hotel rooms, bourbon, and broads, a drifter thinking about living a life without God
You've done it now, you planted a seed, it's like the devil in me
now the storm inside you, it swallows her

And to think you said you would never become

And I know life can be so strange but I know I can make a change I'm gonna wipe away the clouds for ya

I'm gonna be around for ya, I'm gonna paint the town for ya, I'm gonna make a promise to give you everything you want and need, but she fucked up now, cause she's bearing another mouth you can't feed

You promised yourself you would never become, a storm a blackout replicating the one
The thunder inside him became your life and you called him your best friend till the day you were nine

Hotel rooms, bourbon, and broads, a drifter living life, without God
You've done it now, you planted a seed, now the storm inside you, it swallows her

And I know life can be so strange but I know I can make a change I'm gonna wipe away the clouds for ya

I'm gonna be around for ya, I'm gonna paint the town for ya, I'm gonna make a promise to give you everything you want and need, but she fucked up now, cause she's bearing another mouth you can't feed

What is a man, who lays a hand on his lover, and calls it tough love
What is a man, who can't take a stand for his daughter, and calls it tough love
Man enough to see man enough to see, there ain't a goddamn man in me
