It just seems like another fake scene
With no real message and a ton of fake things
And I feel it inside that I live for my team
My team is my fans and I got a purpose to serve them
With songs about having fun and getting real
But I also write about being real, so they feel
Like somebody's listening and somebody cares
So listen when I say

And I can't wait to say whatever, and I can't wait to shed some light
On every little thing you've broken, and get on with my life
And I can't wait to be whoever, and I can't wait to speak my mind
On every little thing you've broken, and get on with my life

And I had a vision so livid
Dipped into a coma after selfish incisions
Cutting into my ego
Deep into my dreams, oh
Forgot the struggle, thought we were too hot
To work for something, change a couple lives
Stop thinking about the pace,
Try to focus on the climb
Re-written to open your eyes and shed some light
On us, not anyone else
So get the drama out your mind

And I can't wait to say whatever, and I can't wait to shed some light
On every little thing you've broken, and get on with my life
And I can't wait to be whoever, and I can't wait to speak my mind
On every little thing you've broken, and get on with my life

If they let you into heaven then I'd rather go to hell
You think you're buying your way to the top with all that bullshit that you sell
God's not naive like the fans you deceive. Even the devil was an angel what the fuck did he achieve?

How about you listen to your soul and forget fame
You could still have a fucking name
I took it too far
I know the truth hurts, but if you're scared
Bitch, go to church

And I can't wait to say whatever, and I can't wait to shed some light
On every little thing you've broken, and get on with my life
And I can't wait to be whoever, and I can't wait to speak my mind
On every little thing you've broken, and get on with my life
