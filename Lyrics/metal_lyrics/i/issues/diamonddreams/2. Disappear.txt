Remember when I didn't need you
Well I need you now
To hold my head up high say...

Some days I feel like a saint, I'm so alive
Some days I can't make any moves
It's like I have no spine
Can't do anything right
And when midnight comes I've run out of time to
Make some kind of difference
I constantly overlook the impact I've made
Maybe I'm longing to change my own face
To make you proud, I wanna make you proud
When you're looking down on me

My mind's wide open like starry skies
I ask God questions and wonder why
The hell that you're not here
I wanna disappear with you now

But I'm a selfish broken heart and how I got this far
Coping with the thought of holding you a minute longer in my arms is beyond me
I set you free

A product of a free world
Take wing over the coast of a better day
I'm stuck in my dark days
But I can be stronger than you remember
We're coming up on December, but I'm not cold

My mind's wide open like starry skies
I ask God questions and wonder why
The hell that you're not here
I wanna disappear with you now

Remember when I didn't need you
Well I need you now
To hold my head up high say it's all better child
Remember when I was alone and crying out
You will be missed
I'm gonna miss you
But I know you're all better now
