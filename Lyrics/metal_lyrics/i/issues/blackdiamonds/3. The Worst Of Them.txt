Funny how everytime you push me away
You turn around and you beg me to stay
Cut down by the things you say
It's the beating of, a broken drum

Na, na, nana
Hey, hey
Na, na, nana
Hey, hey, hey

One of these days
You'll push me away
Turn around
It'll be too late

Your love is addictive
I'm trying hard, just to quit it
But you're drowning yourself
You won't catch your breathe
Until you admit it

Is anybody out there?
I'm dying in a nightmare
You've got third degree burns
And now it's your turn
To feel what I, feel, yeah

And if it don't hurt
Then you know what we got
Ain't real

Funny how everytime you push me away
You turn around and you beg me to stay
Cut down by the things you say
It's the beating of, a broken drum

Na, na, nana
Hey, hey
Na, na, nana
Hey, hey, hey

One of these days
You'll push me away
Turn around
It'll be too late

This love is a monster
It's eating me alive
Let go of my hand, you don't give a damn
And it's killing me, inside

You show me no mercy
Did God make a mistake?
Put a hole in your heart
And then you can start
To feel what I, feel

AIf it don't hurt
Then you know what we got
Ain't real, yeah

Funny how everytime you push me away
You turn around and you beg me to stay
Cut down by the things you say
It's the beating of, a broken drum

Na, na, nana
Hey, hey
Na, na, nana
Hey, hey, hey

One of these days
You'll push me away
Turn around
It'll be too late

Where will you go
When you refuse
My benevolence

It's funny how everytime you push me away
You turn around and you beg me to stay
Everytime you push me away
You turn around and you beg me to stay
Cut down by the things you say
I've had enough

Where will you go
When you refuse
My benevolence

Funny how everytime you push me away
You turn around and you beg me to stay
Cut down by the things you say
It's the beating of, a broken drum

Na, na, nana
Hey, hey
Na, na, nana
Hey, hey, hey

One of these days
You'll push me away
Turn around
It'll be too late
