[Chorus:]
What is a man
Who lays a hand on his lover
And calls it tough love 
Tough love
What is a man
Who can't take a stand for his daughter
And calls it tough love
Tough love

Your roots grow in the crack of the alleys
College park made you
Man enough to see, man enough to see
There ain't a goddamn man in me

Take me back to a date
Before I was hostile and learned to hate

You promised you would never become
You promised you would never become
A storm a blackout replicating the one
The thunder inside him became your life
And you called him your best friend
Till the day you were nine

[Chorus:]
What is a man
Who lays a hand on his lover
And calls it tough love 
Tough love
What is a man
Who can't take a stand for his daughter
And calls it tough love
Tough love

Hotel rooms, bourbon, and broads
A drifter living life without God
You've done it now
You planted a seed
Now the storm inside you
It swallows her

And I know life can be so strange
But I know I can make a change
I'ma wipe away the clouds for ya 

I'm gonna be around for ya
I'm gonna paint the town for ya
I'm gonna make a promise
To give you everything you want and need
But she fucked up now
Cause she's bearing another mouth
You can't feed 

Cease production of a destructive breed
Seek help
Cause your pride only makes you weak

[Chorus:]
What is a man
Who lays a hand on his lover
And calls it tough love 
Tough love
What is a man
Who can't take a stand for his daughter
(Can't take a stand)
And calls it tough love
Tough love

Your roots grow in the crack of the alleys
College park made you
Man enough to see, man enough to see
(Man enough to see)
There ain't a goddamn man in me

(There ain't a goddamn man in me)
