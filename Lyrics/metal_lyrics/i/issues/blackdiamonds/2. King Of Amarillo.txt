Wrath of the industry!

Get over yourself
They can see right through you
We are the future, like no one ever knew you
Got the swag of a coward, and the heart of a nemesis
If you don't like these lyrics, then go listen to Genesi[s]!
Sega, we ain't playin' games
Since you took demise, we'll take the fame.

And I can't wait to say whatever
And I can't wait to shed some light
On every little thing you've broken
And get on with my life
And I can't wait to be whoever
And I can't wait to speak my mind
On every little thing you've broken
And get on with my life

I heard from your friends, that you've been stricken with fear
Desperate for press, in your pathetic carrer
Can't get out of debt, since your sales took a dive
You can find out the hard way
Cowards never thrive

If you'd cut records like cocaine, you could still have a fucking name
Yeah I took it too far, and I know the truth hurts
But if you're scared, bitch, go to church!

And I can't wait to say whatever
And I can't wait to shed some light
On every little thing you've broken
And get on with my life
And I can't wait to be whoever
And I can't wait to speak my mind
On every little thing you've broken
And get on with my life

If they let you into heaven then I'd rather go to hell
You think you're buying your way to the top with that bullshit that you sell
God's not naive like the fans you deceive
Even the devil was an angel, what the fuck did he achieve?

WRATH, to the industry, and everything it used to be

And I can't wait to say whatever
And I can't wait to shed some light
On every little thing you've broken
And get on with my life
And I can't wait to be whoever
And I can't wait to speak my mind
On every little thing you've broken
And get on with my life

Ohhhh yeah, on with my life
Oooo my life
On with my life
