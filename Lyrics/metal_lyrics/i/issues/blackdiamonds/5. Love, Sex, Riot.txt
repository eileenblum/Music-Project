[feat. Chris Fronzack, Attila]Swerve

Put ya hands up! 

I don't mind getting violent
But leave your pride at the door
Cause shame is all we've been hiding
So take me down to the floor
Throw me into the drywall
You got that bullet I'll bite it
Now pop it off like you own me
And scratch my back when you ride it 

[Chorus:]
Nobody wants a couple of rights
Without a couple of wrongs
And the fire that you're building up
Is coming off so strong
It's like I'm burning inside
When you spit my name
The rock the roll the pride the shame
Let's skip the foreplay
And become the teenage waste
That's what we call
Love, sex, riot, so excited
Love, sex, riot

Alright, let's do this

[Fronzack]

[Chorus:]
Nobody wants a couple of rights
Without a couple of wrongs
And the fire that you're building up
Is coming off so strong
It's like I'm burning inside
When you spit my name
The rock the roll the pride the shame
Let's skip the foreplay
And become the teenage waste
That's what we call
Love, sex, riot, so excited
Love, sex, riot

Fuck you

It's riot
Imma' work it over till you're tired
Love it when you're screaming like a siren
Ready aim, ready aim, fire, fire 
Riot
Imma' set it off
Imma' light it
Heart beat beating like it's dynamited
Ready aim, ready aim, fire, fire

I don't mind getting violent
But leave your pride at the door
Cause shame is all we've been hiding
So take me... down

[Fronzack]

It's riot
Imma' work it over till you're tired
Love it when you're screaming like a siren
Ready aim, ready aim, fire, fire 
Riot
Imma' set it off
Imma' light it
Heart beat beating like it's dynamited
Ready aim, ready aim, fire, fire
(Fire, fire)
