[feat. Scout, Snow And Tha Product]Being alone
Are you scared of being alone
Worried you'll be a shadow
Terrified of getting old

Insomnia tapers your eyelids
And the aderol taught you how I lived
So flip a coin for every shade of gray
I bet you pick a needle to bargain with

Heads I bet you fall asleep
Get tangled in the sheets
Suffocate as you choke
At the though of your own dreams
You never fail to feel hollow
Now hush and let the dark swallow

Move a little closer
What are you afraid of
Set the night on fire
And baby, burn it up

[Chorus:]
Tattooed on your chest
I.S.S.U.E.S
Move a little closer
What are you afraid of
What are you afraid of

Zanies and panties on the floor
To numb the pain
Another one night stand at the door
You go insane

I can see you sleep
Through your bedroom window
You're killing yourself with lucid dreaming 

I am manic depressive
Flipping coins for my fate
Now ain't that impressive
Tails you never fail to feel hollow
Now hush and let the dark swallow

Move a little closer
What are you afraid of
Set the night on fire
And baby, burn it up

[Chorus:]
Tattooed on your chest
I.S.S.U.E.S
Move a little closer
What are you afraid of
What are you afraid of

[?]
Move a little closer
Let it go

I am manic depressive
Flipping coins for my fate
Now ain't that impressive
