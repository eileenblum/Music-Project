Your broken throat is swollen
Street walking nonchalant
Fresh wounds all scars you've chosen
Thirsting for a taste of you
She's a mother fucking five living the life of a nine
And thinking that she's a bad bitch
Trick is so selfish
Eating the bullshit of every player that's grabbing her
I guess if you're in love with the streets then you'll die in the sheets with a coke on your chest and his lips on your chin
Live it up for me
Cause no one here can see all of your schemes so it's more like
A dream
Whoa, oh la la la
If you can't be all that you see well then you've lied to your mirror
It's not the way to do it
Can you hear the sounds of your heart beat pumping so loud
And it's gone when you're hitting the town getting around
Sounds so empty
But you pop another pill so you won't feel guilty
You know the routine
Cause when you get laid every guy is the man of your dreams
It's so surreal
With the opinions on her knees
She's a mother fucking five, living the life of a nine
And caught up in the traffic of midnight madness
If only there was a way to let go of the passion for a few little conflicts and a trap house fashion
Want get in the game, what is your name? Wanna have fame? But In retrospect your just like your mother you'll never win
You never change
Live it up for me
Cause no one here can see all of your schemes so it's more like
A dream
Whoa, oh la la la
You can't be all that you see well then you've lied to your mirror
Pretend that you live for this moment
Be sure how you live
That it's worth every breath
Pretend that you live for this moment (For this moment)
Be sure how you live that it is worth every breath
