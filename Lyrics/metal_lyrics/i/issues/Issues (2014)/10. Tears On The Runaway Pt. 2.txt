[feat. Nylo]What if I was wrong and jumped to conclusions
Cause the chance of losing you was all too dangerous
So I just assume that you're doing things before you get the chance
So I can leave and feel like I've got the upper hand
Guilty and maybe I'm just scared of crumbling
Never wasn't much for that life of gambling
But you can't win if you don't play if don't you play there's no shame in this
That's caused me to spade

I said I wouldn't let you down
But it's like we've both have changed some how
You've made a disease of this town
And you act like you don't care
But you left
Your tears on the runway
You think you're running away
You're leaving all your troubles behind
But I'm not going with you this time
I don't wanna try to pretend I'm somebody else
Take me as I am or be left alone
Tears on the runway (run away)
You know that you love the chase
With your tears on the runway
This hate with us is flying south if you know what I mean
But I'm trying my best to keep you right here in my city
A wise women said I wish people weren't afraid of love
Then she packed her shit and she ran like a coward
When the thunder struck
Things aren't always picture perfect
But picture us on top cause we're worth it
So go and get your ticket and grab your sweater
I used to live for the chase
But now I know better
Your tears on the runway
You think you're running away
You're leaving all your troubles behind
But I'm not going with you this time
I don't wanna try to pretend I'm somebody else
Take me as I am or be left alone
Tears on the runway (run away)
You know that you love the chase
I love the chase
You know that I love the chase
