Yeah I would wake up next to you if I could
And I would stare straight past them all to you
I could never say it like I sang it
Drunk tally, cause we're fading
But I'll be, I'll be, But I'll be the first to say
You could be my mistake
I know I want it but I can't stay
I can't stop thinking it , thinking it
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
You could be my mistake
I know I want it but I can't stay
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
That it's a little too late
A little too late
A little too late
And when the sun comes up again
And we're gone| We'll remember every beautiful thing that went wrong
I could never say it I scream it
Drunk tally, cause we're fading
But I'll be, I'll be, I'll be the first to say
You could be my mistake
I know I want it but I can't stay
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
You could be my mistake
I know I want it but I can't stay
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
That it's a little too late
A little too late
A little too late
(Cut up vocals)
You could be my mistake
I know I want it but I can't stay
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
You could be my mistake
I know I want it but I can't stay
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
I can't stop thinking it, thinking it
You could be my mistake
