Riddle me this, I gotta figure it out
Are they laughing at me because I'm prone to fear and doubt

Am I messed up?
Am I loud?
Well eat my dust that's all I am a speck out in the crowd

I'm trying to clean up the mess I made
But the towel I used to soak up my worry it just went up in flames

You say I've got a conscience like gasoline
I could syphon shit out, fuck it and leave
But I fuel the fire with everything they said, it's stuck in my mind
You're better off dead

If you've got the keys then start the car and drive (GO) as far as you can
If you've got the blood then you've got the heart to (WIN)
Give yourself a chance

Seem like we've been so scarred
Some people call it art
I hope you make peace with your pain
And never lose your flames

You call yourself a doctor you swear you got the cure
Prescribe yourself with medication when you're feeling insecure

I know the world is dark but you've got the light
Even sitting in the closet chilling with the skeletons you fight

I guess you found the meaning of giving up on me I'm not the person that you thought I was
I broke the ice I revealed the scandal but the water's deeper than you're able to handle

Oh that's probably why you hit me twice
Said no son of mine get out of my life
It's my fault it's what I deserve I needed a blessing but I got a curse

If you've got the keys then start the car and (GO) drive as far as you can
If you've got the blood then you've got the heart to (WIN)
Give yourself a chance

Seem like we've been so scarred
Some people call it art
I hope you make peace with your pain
And never lose your flames

Misunderstood, I'm misunderstood
I will live to my fullest because I owned my name the best I could
Misunderstood, we are all misunderstood
Everybody own your name I wish you would, wish you would

If you've got the keys then start the car and drive as far as you can
If you've got the blood then you've got the heart to (WIN)
Give yourself a chance

Seem like we've been so scarred
Some people call it art
I hope you make peace with your pain
And never lose your flames

Seem like we've been so scarred
Some people call it art
I hope you make peace with your pain
And never lose your flames
