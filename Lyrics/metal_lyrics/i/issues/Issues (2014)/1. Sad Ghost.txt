Standing in front of this bed with some matches, watch it burn
I'll pray my body burns too
Why do, I do the things I do
Things I do
And did it blind you, blind you
That you are the only one who can see what I've done
Eight years just to feel the same
I need to get up and make a change
Get up and get over this
My voice it echoes
My thoughts collide
You said I'm dead to you I prayed for you
Now you're dreams can come true
There's a place in my bed where you rested your head
Now I'm resting alone in this bed and it's cold
I Feel like a ghost
These memories go up in smoke
You didn't want to hear it
Did it make me delirious
Two, forty AM my room was
Why do, I do the things I do
Things I do
And did it blind you, blind you
That you are the only one who can see what I've done
Guess I'll never know what I meant to you
These years been lonely
But at least it's through
I'll write a letter to my former self
Dear Sad Ghost, why'd you put your heart on a shelf?
You took the boy out of them
Is when you took the life out of me
Take a look into the mirror
But you don't see yourself inside
Why don't you grab a hold
You'll be locked up here with me
Like it did with you
I know you're drunk again
And I'm thinking clear
But when you write this down
At least try and sound a bit more sincere
Guess I'll never know
What I meant to you
These years been lonely but at least it's through
I'll write a ere's a place in my bed where you rested your head
Now I'm resting alone in this bed and letter to my former self
Dear Sad Ghost, why'd you put your heart on a shelf?
