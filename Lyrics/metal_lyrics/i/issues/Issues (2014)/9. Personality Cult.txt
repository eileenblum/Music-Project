Fuck the voice of a generation
I just want to be who I am
No one can change your gunman?
I'm content with where I stand
So fuck the voice of a generation
You can stand on your own two feet
No one cares from across the nation
Sing my songs when you own the streets

This is who we are, we are
A product of..
This is who we are, we are
A product of war

And the grain of her skin
We think this is it
Pretend bias stand up that won't let us out
But choice is a sin
With not enough to stand
When life is your friend when your life cuts you thin

Smooth talker and a heart breaker
But you were nothing but a cheap thinker
I am almost lower than you are

This is who we are [3x]
A product of war

I just wish that this itching I have, to be different somehow, would escape me.
Console these obstacles
Make it difficult
When you're just trying to change me

At least when we stayed together I'm not the only soul trapped here
Limbo by these pre-madonnas

Smooth talker and a heart breaker
You're nothing but a cheap thinker
I am almost lower than you are

This is who we are [3x]
A product of war

Way to think way to make us conform
Worship your words
I'll admit that I'm sold, but
The fact that you consider yourself a God
Is the very reason
You should grow the fuck up

Smooth talker and a heart breaker
You're nothing but a cheap thinker
I am almost lower than you are

This is who we are [3x]
A product of war
