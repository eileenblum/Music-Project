Coming out of my shell again
No one's there, let's pretend to
See a girl and a boy standing next to me
And at this party I'll pretend
For a moment I just might have friends
The times of them dancing to break free
I've got to cut the chains all loose so I can fit in
They said be silent
No one can hear you
You feel like i did when no one comes near you
Cause they think that you're weird and you're stained like a carpet the carpet your mom ruined, making you pay
What did I do to deserve this?
I forget that it's all apart of my imagination
I could actually pick and choose my loose ends
And tie a knot but all I do is
Run and hide
It'll get you boy
Run and hide
I was born unaware
That, my whole life would be a war
So I battle myself and until I Run and hide
It'll get you boy
Stupid is what stupid does
We're like an offspring of stupidest and always will be mad in luck
But I just don't have it in my blood
Blood runs deep
When we're growing up there'll be blood dripping from your ugly mug
Cause papa don't like it like momma does
So give it up
For the guardian angel just sip it up
Rub a little dirt in it boy and bear with me just take a little ? of my kidney
Well it's not your problem when people come near you
Well it seems I'm right that most people fear you
What a shame that you feel so insane
But the truth of the matter is your shadow is cold and afraid
Did I fail to mention
It's all part of my imagination
I could actually could pick and choose my loose ends
And tie a knot but all I do is run and hide
It'll get you boy
Run and hide
All I need is a friend
My whole life has been a war
So I battle my self until I run and hide
One after one they'll all spin around
And one after one they'll all fall down from love
No body ever gave them enough
One after one and they'll all come around
And one after one they'll all fall down from love
Somebody's gonna give you it all
Somebody better give you enough
