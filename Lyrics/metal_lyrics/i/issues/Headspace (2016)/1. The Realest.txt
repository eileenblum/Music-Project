Another waste of headspace got dumb on the tracks never knew the facts 'til I wised up
For years I been toe to toe with the heavy weights, never thought I'd size up
It's got me thinking 'bout the rise up, you said no strings attached and now you got me tied up
You talking that shit, and you're blowing that smoke, but your card got declined at the night club

Every single pointless conversation, is breaking down the walls that kept the demons out
I try to find the signs that might reveal the secret to what we're missing,
but maybe time is all that we need now

A blessing in disguise, or just broke and pitiful,
I don't fuck with these mind games babe,
but if one thing's right I saw with my own eyes

I know your tricks, don't act so proud, I'm moving up while you're slowing down

I own it now, you want it now, and you can put it down, but you're nothing but a waste of headspace

Every single pointless conversation, is breaking down the walls that kept the demons out
I try to find the signs that might reveal the secret to what we're missing,
but maybe time is all that we need now

A blessing in disguise, or just broke and pitiful,
I don't fuck with these mind games babe,
but if one thing's right I saw with my own eyes

You're a waste of space in my head...
You're a waste of space in my head...

A blessing in disguise, or just broke and pitiful,
I don't fuck with these mind games babe,
but if one thing's right I saw with my own eyes
A blessing in disguise, or just broke and pitiful,
I don't fuck with these mind games babe,
but if one thing's right I saw with my own eyes

You're a waste of space in my head...
You're a waste of space in my head...

I try to find the signs...
Another waste of headspace

You're a waste of space in my head
