Everybody needs lovinâ sometimes
Physical emotion, alright babe
To see your face light up
Would give me nothing but bliss
And when I start showing off
I never know how to quit

Say something Iâm not giving up on you
Iâll stay as long as I need to

I wanna be all you think about
Anything and everything you dream about
As if I had it all figured out
I wanna be the one you canât breathe without

It might be hard to play it cool
Cause I know thatâs not what gentlemen do, yeah yeah
When Iâm hurting just to know youâre fighting
Listen to me reminiscing and let love guide you

Say something Iâve got a lot to lose
Odds say that youâre not gonna pull through

I wanna be all you think about
Anything and everything you dream about
As if I had it all figured out
I wanna be the one you canât breathe without
If you could open your eyes

I donât know where you are
In your mind but listen to your soul
Trying to find its way back to your heart
From the car to the ER
Just think of me and pull yourself back to creation

I wanna be all you think about
Anything and everything you dream about
As if I had it all figured out
I wanna be the one you canât breathe without
If you could open your eyes
