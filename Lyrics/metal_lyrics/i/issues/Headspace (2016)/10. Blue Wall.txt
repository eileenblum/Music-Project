[Verse 1: Tyler Carter]
Easily temperamental
Dangerously equipped
Impossibly avoidable
By proving their contempt
Bastardizing the justice
And living above the law
Black and blue donât get along
Blue just want em dead and gone

[Hook: Michael Bohn]
Empty your clips on the victim
And then you look the other way
Your nation will crumble
And youâll just look the other way

[Verse 2: Tyler Carter]
Got a hood rat and the alley cat heard
The city got a kid hesitating to leave work
At the right time in the wrong place got served
An extendo not a miranda head first

[Bridge 1: Michael Bohn]
Get down, already knocked out face on the ground
Weâre at war with the ones who protect and serve

[Hook 2: Michael Bohn and Tyler Carter]
Empty your clips on the victim
And then you look the other way
Minorities parish
And even tho he got his hands up

[Bridge 2: Michael Bohn]
Caged like animals
Wound up and released with their badges
Brutalize our streets, savages
How many have to die
To put an end to crooked swine

[Hook 3: AJ Rebollo]
And you just look the other way
Empty your clips on the victim
And then you look the other way
Your nation will crumble
And you just look the other way

[Outro: Michael Bohn]
They will not fear the system anymore
They will not cower like they did before
This cannot be ignored
The machine will not hold us down
