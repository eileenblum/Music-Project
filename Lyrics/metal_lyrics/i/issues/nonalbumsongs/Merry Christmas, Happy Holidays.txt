[from "Punk Goes Christmas" compilation]Ho, ho, ho
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays

Oh, yeah!

We've been waiting all year for this night
And the snow is glistening on the trees outside
All the stockings are hung by the fire side
(Waiting for Santa to arrive)
And all my love will show
'Cause we're about to show them, baby
It's Christmas time
It's you and me, yeah
Sitting by the fire
It's the best time of the year to ignite, yeah

It's a wonderful feeling
Feel the love in the room
From the floor to the ceiling
It's that time of year
Christmas time is here
And the hooligan in me
Rockin' 'round the Christmas tree
Everything's okay
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Happy Holidays

Bells are ringing
It's time to scream and shout
Let's start until this stress gets locked out
Celebrating this special time of year
Happiness 'cause love is in the air

And all the love will show
'Cause everybody knows
It's Christmas time
It's you and me, yeah
Sitting by the fire
It's the best time of year to ignite, yeah

I wanna spread a little cheer
Whisper in your ear
What I'll do with you
Baby, when we grindin'
I get so excited
I guess it's safe to say
Happy Holidays

Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays

Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho (Merry Christmas)
Ho, ho, ho (Merry Christmas)
Ho, ho, ho
Merry Christmas

Happy Holidays

It's a wonderful feeling
Feel the love in the room
From the floor to the ceiling
It's that time of year
Christmas time is here
And the hooligan in me
Rockin' 'round the Christmas Tree
Everything's okay
Happy Holidays, oh ya yeah
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas

Happy Holidays
