Catch me running around the town if you can my heart on my sleeve and the world in my hands where do we go where do we stand you dream but you never move so don't be mad when I do

Patiently waiting to give up everything I got start thinking about my future at the number one spot my friends think they lost me but I'm still the same me

Hooligans got big hearts but they're just some kids Cali made flashy sins need nobody cause we know where we fit in

I'm so close to the edge of the life that I sacrificed and strived for but you've buried everything we used to fight for set it off

Patiently waiting to give up everything I got start thinking about my future at the number one spot my friends think they lost me but I would never change and I would sell out my pride when everybody wanna say you never gave a damn bout your boys in the first place old Dena (Pasadena) raised me and the road will never change me

To everyone who stuck around this one's for you they may say we're a lost cause but they don't see what I do
