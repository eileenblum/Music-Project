3, 2, 1, go!

I'm always failing myself
I'm always failing myself and everybody else
I've spent my days at the bottom
I've gotta gather the strength
So I can make the climb

I carry the worry underneath my skin
I bury the feeling far too deep to reach
I carry the worry underneath my skin
And I blame myself

I'm always fighting myself
I'm always fighting myself and everyone else
I am the cause of my own demise

I carry the worry underneath my skin
I bury the feeling far too deep to reach
I carry the worry underneath my skin
And I blame myself

And I blame myself
Myself
And I blame myself
I bury the feeling far too deep to reach

Too many nights spent at the mirror
Eyes staring back at me
Revealing all of my fears
These nights will be the death of me

I carry the worry underneath my skin
I bury the feeling far too deep to reach
I carry the worry underneath my skin
And I blame myself

And I blame myself
Myself
And I blame myself
I bury the feeling far too deep to reach
