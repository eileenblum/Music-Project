The lies from your mouth flows like poison,
The seasons fade to grey and whither away.
The Knife in my back turns like clockwork, like seconds in to hours devouring me.

The moments you gave were digging my grave the sickening sadness why can't I get past this, does self loathing ring true, or is it all for you, I hear the words, or is it all for you, I know their meaning.

If you're playing with fire you're bound to get burned.
I've been there before and I know it hurts.
you're playing with fire and you're gonna get burned.
and now you've been warned will you ever learn. Your playing with fire.

Betrayer Deceiver.
You always had a habit of crawling back and I never could face it.
Some people never change and not all stories have a happy ending.

The knife in my back turns like clockwork, like seconds into hours devouring me.

If you're playing with fire you're bound to get burned.
I've been there before and I know it hurts.
you're playing with fire and you're gonna get burned.
and now you've been warned will you ever learn.
You're playing with fire.

So many years I gave to you, I would have given them all if I could.
Dishonest from the start, all these lies.
The sickness in my heart, I'm not alive.
All the these lies, I'm not alive.

If you're playing with fire you're bound to get burned, I've been there before and I know it hurts.
If you're playing with fire your bound to get burned.
I've been there before and I know it hurts.
you're playing with fire and you're gonna get burned.
and now you've been warned will you ever learn.
You're playing with fire.

The lies from your mouth flows like poison,
The seasons fade to grey and whither away.
You're playing with fire.
The Knife in my back turns like clockwork, like seconds in to hours devouring me.
