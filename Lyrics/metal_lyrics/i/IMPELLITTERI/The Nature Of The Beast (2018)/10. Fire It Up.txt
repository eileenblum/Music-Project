In your eyes a fire is burning
A crucible inside
You been down this road before now
You won't be denied

Standing up to fight the battle
Itâs always on your mind
Mental vision makes it happen
You've got to hold the line

Fire it up!
You been striving so long, living for the dream
Fire it up
You been pushing so far, to drive you past the pain
Fire it up
Relentless heart will guide you, to a further place
Fire it up
Now's your time for glory, your power wins the race

You've been fighting now for so long
You've been grinding hard
You've been stepping up for your self
Reaching for the crown

Fire it up!
You been striving so long, living for the dream
Fire it up
You been pushing so far, to drive you past the pain
Fire it up
Relentless heart will guide you, to a further place
Fire it up
Now's your time for glory, your power wins the race
