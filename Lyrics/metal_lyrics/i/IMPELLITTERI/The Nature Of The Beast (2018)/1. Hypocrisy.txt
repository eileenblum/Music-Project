Welcome to the new world, where I am god and king
Master of the humans, my puppets on a string
Lead with my deceptions, my lies and fantasy
Wicked is my nature, the evil you can't see

The thrill of your life, is it not enough for you?
Sell me your soul, I'll see what I can do
Blind lead the blind, as far as I can see
Obey my words, but itâs all hypocrisy

Beautiful the angel, who likes to have it all
Cast down from the heavens, the rising of the dawn
Bringer of deception, the bright and morning star
Lucifer they call me, the prince of all that's dark

The thrill of your life, is it not enough for you?
Sell me your soul, I'll see what I can do
Blind lead the blind, as far as I can see
Obey my words, but itâs all hypocrisy

Welcome to the New World, Iâll give you everything
Flourish in a prison, that you will never see
Keeping you distracted, I feed on apathy
Running with the devil, Iâll give you what you need

The thrill of your life, is it not enough for you?
Sell me your soul, I'll see what I can do
Blind lead the blind, as far as I can see
Obey my words, but itâs all hypocrisy
