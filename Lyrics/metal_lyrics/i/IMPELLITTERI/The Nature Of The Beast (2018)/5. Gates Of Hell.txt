Falling from the sky the warhead burns
Destruction on the way
Triggering the last seduction
When there's nothing left to save

Enter into the Gates of Hell
As the leaders plot their mission
Itâs the war that will end all wars
When the eagle starts to fly
Gazing into the crystal ball
You can see the clock is ticking
And the end of the world will come
As you open up the Gates of Hell

Chaos and despair are hovering
In clouds above your head
Revelation times are manifest
When evilâs all you're fed

Enter into the Gates of Hell
As the leaders plot their mission
Itâs the war that will end all wars
When the eagle starts to fly
Gazing into the crystal ball
You can see the clock is ticking
And the end of the world will come
As you open up the Gates of Hell
