I been standing tall out in Hollywood
With my star on the boulevard
I can do no wrong, I'm irresistible
This face is gonna take me far

But you don't know me
Cuz Iâm your superstar
You canât see me, not the real me

My persona living on the silver screen
Got my Oscar and my Golden Globe
But there's a dark side creeping deep inside of me
And I'm never gonna let it show

Masquerade, cuz you can never know the real me
Masquerade, and you will never see the real me
Masquerade, masquerade

You don't know me
I'm your superstar
You can't see me, not the real me

Yea, I'm your superstar
I been standing tall out in Hollywood
Just like Kevin, Bill and Harvey do
I can do no wrong, I'm irresistible
Got the power to keep it quiet too

Masquerade, cuz you can never really know me
Masquerade, and you will never see the real me
Masquerade, cuz you can never know the real me
Masquerade, and you will never see the real me
