The finger's on the trigger
The talks are breaking down
Verbal threats and tension
And no one's standing down

Run for your life, can't you see the sky is falling?
Are you ready to fight?

Nuclear ambitions
Call it war or peace
Everyoneâs addicted
To the power of the beast

Run for your life, breaking down negotiations
Leading to the confrontation
Ooh, it's the nature of the Beast

Nation against nation
The cycle of insane
Hysteria and chaos
Thereâs no one left to blame

Run for your life,
Canât you see the sky is falling?
Donât you know the night is coming?
Breaking down negotiations
Leading to the confrontation
