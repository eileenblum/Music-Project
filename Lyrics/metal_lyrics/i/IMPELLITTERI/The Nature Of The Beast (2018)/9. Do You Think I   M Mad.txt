I hear voices in my mind
Telling me I'm Frankenstein
Thereâs two natures deep inside of me!

I am Jekyll, I am Hyde
Evil must be satisfied
But the world must never see the monster!

I am Doctor I am good
Thought the creature understood
But the devil lurks inside the mind

Now the slayer's in the streets
Killing everything it sees
Can this demon really be me?

Do you think I'm mad?

In my lab the seed was sown
Can inner self be left alone
Or will a stronger urge prevail in me?

My evil potion turns it on
The savage beast that comes along
Taking over what is good inside

Do you think I'm mad?

âAs the metamorphosis transpires, the good Dr. Jekyll transforms into Mr. Hyde
And as the potion begins its feast, Dr. Jekyll is lost to the nature of the beastâ

I canât hide it anymore
The monsters waiting at the door
I must stop the killing spree, but how?

Now is time to intercede
I am tortured by misdeeds
Mr. Hyde must be destroyed, please!

Do you think Iâm mad?

A man cannot destroy the savage in him by denying its impulses
Think what it would mean to yield to every evil impulse, yet leave the soul untouchedâ¦
