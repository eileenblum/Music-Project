[originally by Andrew Lloyd Webber]In sleep he sang to me in dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again? For now I find
The phantom of the opera is there, inside my mind

Sing once again with me, our strange duet
Your power over me, grows stronger yet
And though I turn from you, to glance behind
The phantom of the opera is there, inside my mind

Those who have seen your face, draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear, itâs me they hear
Your spirit and my voice in one combined
The phantom of the opera is there, in my mind

In all your fantasies, you always knew
That man and mystery were both in you
And in this labyrinth, where night is blind
The phantom of the opera is there, inside my mind

There the phantom of the opera
Sing for me, sing forever!
