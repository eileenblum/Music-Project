I see the world hanging on the edge
Slipping closer to the endless void
Every day they draw you in
Those dark spirits from the netherworld
The moon is rising in the midnight hour
Thatâs when evil strikes with all its power

Come to me and I'll set your spirit free
When the darkness surrounds you
Close at hand, when the demons call your name
Face your fear - kill the beast!

You start to shiver and you can't resist
You're just a mortal and you want to live
Imaginations got you terrorized
The hounds of hell have got you paralyzed

Come to me and I'll set your spirit free
When the darkness surrounds you
Close at hand, when the demons call your name
Face your fear - kill the beast!

In the end it is you, follow shadows that lead the way
In the dark it is you, step away from the ghoulish grave
I can hear that youâre crying, and I know you're afraid
But a new day is dawning, and the sun will soon rise again

Face your fear, kill the beast!
