Children of the brave, military grade, raised up to become a warrior
Father flew the flag, courage is the badge, living for the glory and honor

I'm alive, when I'm keeping the faith
I'm alive, when I'm serving my brothers
I'll keep fighting the fight, and lay down my life

Man of War
Fight for your country, fight for your people
Soldier of conscience, your life for the nation

Lion heart and soul, spirit of the bold, courage is your middle name
Fearless on the front, valor when it counts, hero of the modern age

I'm alive, when I'm keeping the faith
I'm alive, when I'm serving my brothers
Iâll keep fighting the fight, and lay down my life

Man of War
Fight for your country, fight for your people
Soldier of conscience, you are the man of war
Youâll die for your people
Fight for the nation, fight for your country
When Iâm heavy under fire, you're the fearless one
I want you by my side

I'm alive, when I'm keeping the faith
Iâm alive, when Iâm serving my brothers
I'll keep fighting the fight, and lay down my life

Man of War
Fight for your country, fight for your people
Soldier of conscience, your life for the nation
Fight for your country, fight for your people
Soldier of conscience, you lay down your life
Man of War
