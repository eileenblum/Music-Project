Don't you fear what's coming, don't be running away
Stand and face your rival, it's time for you to be brave

Shine On
Don't you know that you can never he defeated
Shine On
Don't you know that you should never be afraid

Every day's a battle, sometimes you want to give up
But the world just keeps on turning, and now you're rising above

Shine On
Donât you know that you can never be defeated
Shine On
Donât you know that you should never be afraid
Shine On
Can't you see there's power in the heart of freedom
Shine On
Can't you see there's justice in the hand of fate

Shine On
Don't you know that you can never be defeated
Shine On
Donât you know that you should never be afraid
Shine On
Canât you see thereâs power in the heart of freedom
Shine On
Can't you see there's justice in the hand of fate
