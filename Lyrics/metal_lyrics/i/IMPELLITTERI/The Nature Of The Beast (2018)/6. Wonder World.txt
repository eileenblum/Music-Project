There's a new world order coming
Thereâs nothing you can do
Everything about you
Is monitored and viewed

Bio metric scan
Through the brain, on the hand
Scanning through your eyes, tracking you down

Come on! There's a new world coming!

Society now cashless
Control what you buy and sell
Commerce on your cell phone
The code will serve you well

Bio metric scan
Through the brain, on the hand
Scanning through your eyes, tracking you down

Wonderworld, computers taking over for you
Wonderworld, intelligence controller
Wonderworld, artificial mindset patrol
Wonderworld, dependence on the virtual machine
