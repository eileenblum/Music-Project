On a mission, another setting sun
There is no time to waste
One obsession, keeping me on the run
The vision won't fade away

Can't you see, nothing else matters to me
Can't you see, you're all that I need

All day and into the night
I'll be searching for you
No way I'll give up the fight
And I've got to come through

Through the heartache, another dead end street
With my back to the wall
One survivor, getting back on my feet
And let the cards begin to fall

Can't you see, nothing else matters to me
Don't you know, you're all that I need

All day and into the night
I'll be searching for you
No way I'll give up the fight
And I've got to come through

All day and into the night
There is no time to waste
No way I'll give up the fight
The vision won't fade away

All day and into the night
I'll be searching for you
No way I'll give up the fight
And I've got to come through

All day and into the night
