Lying on the floor from a shot in the heart
Spinning from the lies and a life in the dark
Messing with my mind, I could barely see
Just another lesson that I did not need

Then the sky just opened up and she was standing there
All my fears just turned to hope again

[Chorus:]
She's got the eyes of an angel (eyes)
Lifting me higher than I ever dreamed
Eyes of an angel (angel)
Taking ma places that I never knew
She's got the eyes of an angel (eyes)
Lost in your heaven, can this be true?
Eyes of an angel (angel )
Finding the reason to believe again

Now my world can open up because she is standing there
All my fears just turned to hope again

[Chorus]
