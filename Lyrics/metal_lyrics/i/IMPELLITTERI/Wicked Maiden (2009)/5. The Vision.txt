I see the lightning strike as it shoots across the sky
I hear the thunder roll as it shakes the earth inside
Bringing down the wrath of God for the sins of Babylon
All eyes on the Son of Man as he steps down from the clouds

Send us to oblivion, shake the hand of wrath

Now I'm ready to die - for my conviction
Fight - my opposition
Cry - in my affliction tonight
You know I'm ready to die - it's my decision
Fight - the inquisition
Cry - for my submission tonight
Now I'm ready to die - in my confession
Fight - it's my obsession
Cry - for my transgression tonight
You know I'm ready to die - in this condition
Fight - for my position
Cry - I see the vision tonight

Built upon the sacrifice of the ones who came before
Laying down the cornerstone of the Word forevermore
Our days are numbered as we spin out of control
Compromise and little white lies can't purify the soul

Send us to oblivion, shake the hand of wrath

Now I'm ready to die - for my conviction
Fight - my opposition
Cry - in my affliction tonight
You know I'm ready to die - it's my decision
Fight - the inquisition
Cry - for my submission tonight
Now I'm ready to die - in my confession
Fight - it's my obsession
Cry - for my transgression tonight
You know I'm ready to die - in this condition
Fight - for my position
Cry - I see the vision tonight
