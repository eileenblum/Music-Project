Carry the burden and conquer the grave
Walking through darkness on the road that was paved
Breaking the power and the shackles of death
Rising to life on the words that you said

Out in the desert you faced it alone, temptation that comes from the foe
Blessing the weak and then healing the poor,
There's no place that you can call home
Warning the masses, the kingdom is at hand
Coming in power, the end of the age,
The one that they call "Son of Man"

He walks among the dead, the Holy Man
He sits upon the throne, the Holy Man

You can't deny the Christ anymore
He rose so high above the law
The Holy Man will come again
The wrath of God ,the end of the age

Born of a virgin foretold in the past
Fulfilling the words that the sages forecast
Cursing the devil and the demons of night
Bringing salvation to the children of light

Miracle man on a mission of love
Showing the signs from above
Political rivals and skeptical eyes
Spreading their lies to corrupt

He walks among the dead, The Holy Man
He sits upon the throne, The Holy man

You can't deny the Christ anymore
He rose so high above the law
The Holy Man will come again
The wrath of God, the end of the age

Holy Man
