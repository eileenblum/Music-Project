I am the one
You can see the fear inside their eyes

Break into the morning show, crime is rising
Bringing you the video, people dying
No one knows what's going on, children hiding
Streets are like a battle zone, widow's crying

I must face all my enemies
Protect and defend what is mine
I will fight until victory
For I am the one, the last of a dying breed

Life and death is on the edge, hope is fading
People jumping from the ledge, suffocating
Keep alert and watch your back, retribution
Under siege under attack, no solution

Eyes of fear, a dying nation
Chaos rules, you feel the frustration
No one's safe, a broken system
Stand my ground, I won't be a victim

I must face all my enemies
Protect and defend what is mine
I will fight until victory
For I am the one, the last of a dying breed
I won't live in fear

I must face all my enemies
Protect and defend what is mine
I will fight until victory
For I am the one, I'm under the gun
I must face all my enemies
Protect and defend what is mine
I will fight until victory
For I am the one, the last of a dying breed
