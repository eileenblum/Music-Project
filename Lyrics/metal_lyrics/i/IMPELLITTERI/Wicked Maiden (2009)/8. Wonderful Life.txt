Here I stand watching you, thinking you got it all
Super job, Cadillacs, a mansion for a house
Diamond rings, fancy clothes, expensive restaurants
Living high on credit cards and you love to show it off

I see your wonderful life, it sure looks better than mine
You rent the American dream and now you're a slave to the lie

Little man, dressed to kill, pretend you got the life
Mercedes Benz, three years lease, but you can't pay the price
Look at you, big rock star, living above the crowd
But fantasy is all it is when you're walking tall and proud
Time will come to pay your debt and taste reality
But no one's there to stop and stare, you're living in a dream

I see your wonderful life, is it really better than mine?
You rent the American dream and now you're a slave to the lie
I see your beautiful life, it looks like you've got it all
Seems like it's a wonderful life but you're headed for a fall

Such a wonderful life
Such a beautiful life
It's a wonderful life

I see your wonderful life, is it really better than mine?
You rent the American dream and now you're a slave to the lie
I see your beautiful life, it looks like you've got it all
Seems like it's a wonderful life but you're headed for a fall
I see your wonderful life, it ain't no better than mine
Slave to the American dream, someday you will pay the price
I see your wonderful life
