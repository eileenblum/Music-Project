Cursed and over-rated, and you will burn in hell
So stay away from the reaper and run from his ringing bell
Don't you play with his fire and light yourself ablaze
Climb up to salvation and ride out of the grave

I see the world and it's empty
Paradise lost from the sin of a man

In the garden of Eden - There's the devil in disguise
Garden of Eden - Standing right before your eyes
In the garden of Eden - There's a snake inside the grass
Garden of Eden - And you're gonna taste the wrath

Burning in the seduction, lying to yourself
Think your doing justice, feed your money well
Judgment Day is coming, lightning hailing down
Flee from the rage of heaven cause time is running out

I see the world, it's so empty
Paradise lost from the sin of a man

In the garden of Eden - There's the devil in disguise
Garden of Eden - Staring right into your eyes
In the garden of Eden - There's a snake inside the grass
Garden of Eden - And you're gonna face the wrath

In the garden of Eden, in the Garden of Eden

In the garden of Eden - There's the devil in disguise
Garden of Eden - Standing right before your eyes
In the garden of Eden - There's a snake inside the grass
Garden of Eden - And you're gonna taste the wrath
