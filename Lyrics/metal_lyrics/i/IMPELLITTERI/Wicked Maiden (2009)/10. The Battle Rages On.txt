You never see it coming, but you can read the writing on the wall
Purity to corruption, a thought begins but soon the flesh will fall
Jealousy and anger, an evil heart no one can ever know
In the winds of deception, you hold the line against the flow

On an on since the dawn of all creation
An endless game, it's the conflict of the ages

In the war between good and evil
The battle rages on
In the fight between light and darkness
The armor must be strong

In this world of confusion, the hand is always quicker than the eye
A spirit of delusion, you justify your conscience with your mind
Just like Cain and Abel, or like Mother Theresa, Genghis Khan
One extreme to another, the pendulum is swinging hard

On and on since the dawn of all creation
An endless game, it's the conflict of the ages

In the war between good and evil
The battle rages on
In the fight between light and darkness
The armor must be strong
In the war between good and evil
The battle rages on
There's a line between light and darkness
That crosses every realm
