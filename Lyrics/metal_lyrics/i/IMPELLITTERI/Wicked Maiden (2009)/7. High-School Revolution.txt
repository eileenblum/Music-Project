Eight O'clock sharp and the bell has rung
School doors open and my mind goes numb
Too many teachers, too many rules
Too many texts on my cell phone too
Books and papers, pencils and pens,
Math and science just ain't my friend
I need a life, it's a waste of my day
To hear you babble for my stinkin' grade

Got my eyes full of coming attractions
Don't you know it's a major distraction
Can't learn nothing in this place
I think I know just what I need

Hi-School Revolution, ring the bell I got nothing to lose
No more thought pollution, I don't care about your stupid rules
Don't lecture me about your history,
Cause when I leave you know I can't even read

Standing in the check in for security
Pass the little wand from my head to my feet
I get inside - got an attitude
Dealing with the crazies and the bangers too
Teacher looking with seductive eyes
Someone's got a gun - cut em' down to size
I need a nap to take my FCAT score
Pop another quiz and now I'm really bored

Got my eyes full of coming attractions
Don't you know it's a major distraction
Can't learn nothing in this place
I think I know just what I need

Hi-School Revolution, fire drill get me out of here
No more thought pollution, juvenile delinquent atmosphere
Hi-School Revolution, learning nothing cause I'm A.D.D.
No more mind delusion, Don't fill my head with your apologies
Tell me! How do you spell that?

Hi-School Revolution, ring the bell I got nothing to lose
No more thought pollution, I don't care about your stupid rules
Don't lecture me about your history,
Cause when I leave you know I can't even read

Hi-School Revolution, fire drill get me out of here
No more thought pollution, juvenile delinquent atmosphere
Hi-School Revolution, learning nothing cause I'm A.D.D.
No more mind delusion, don't fill my head with your apologies
