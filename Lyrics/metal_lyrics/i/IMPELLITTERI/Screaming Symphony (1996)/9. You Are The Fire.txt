I used to fight, I used to hide, I used to lie
Lost in the shadows of the night
I realize the sacrifice and now you're mine
I'll always have you by my side

All through the mud and the mire I know
You are the fire burning in my soul

The tables turn and now I learn I will survive
I see the answer in your eyes
You hold me tight all through the night, there's no disguise
And now I know your love's alive

All through the mud and the mire I know
You are the fire burning in my soul

Burning in my soul

You are the fire burning in my soul
You are the fire everywhere I go
You are the fire, burning in my soul
Fire, burning in my soul
