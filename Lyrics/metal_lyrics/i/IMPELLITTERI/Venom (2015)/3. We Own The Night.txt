It's time to rock, let's tear it up!

The night is falling and the moon is full
And the boys are out running the street
All you hear is the call of the wild
And the gangsters are feeling the heat

You'll never know until you realize
We're taking back the streets

We own the night, we own the night

We slay the stage at the hour of dark 
When the creatures are coming forth 
We cast a spell on the shadows edge 
In a trance they'll be wanting more

You'll never know until you realize
We're children of the light

We own the night, when the band is playing hard
We own the night, everybody's in the line of fire
We own the night, we're gonna tear up this whole town
We own the night, when the band is rocking
You know its right, we own the night

You never know until you see the light
It's all happening here

We own the night, when the band is playing hard
We own the night. everybody's in the line of fire
We own the night, we're gonna tear up this whole town
We own the night, when the band is rocking
You know it's right, we own the night
We own it, we own the night
