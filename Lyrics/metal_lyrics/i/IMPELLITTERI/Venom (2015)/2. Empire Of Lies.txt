All hail to Caesar, the ruler of the world
So full of delusion. his arrogance unfurled

I see the writing on the wall in neon lights - Welcome to all 
Empire of lies!

Streets are full of violence, emptiness and greed 
In a downward spiral, that everyone can see

I see the writing on the wall in neon lights - Welcome to all

Empire of lies, I can see you falling down
Empire of lies, you're a king without a crown

Here comes the fire of justice
(to punish all evil and hum it down)
It's raining down on your kingdom
(now the world will turn and Rome will burn)
Empire!

Empire of lies, I can seeyou falling down 
Empire of lies, you're a king without a crown
Empire of lies, now you'll reap what you have sown 
Empire of lies
