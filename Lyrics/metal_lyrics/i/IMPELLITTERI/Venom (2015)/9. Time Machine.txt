Every moment makes a memory 
A song playing in your hisiory
We are the soundtrack of your life

You love the music so it never dies
You feed the flames so you stay alive
Your passion burns for another day

You found the way to transcend time 
With the music in your mind

You need a spark, so you recall the tune 
Lifting you higher, gonna change your mood 
The melody takes you for a ride

Like a needle running through your veins
You need the sound so you don't feel the pain 
The music soothes your very soul

You found the way to transcend time 
With the music in your mind

Ride the time machine
Ride the time machine
Flying through the history of your world
Ride the time machine
Ride the time machine
Sailing through the memories of your life

Ride the time machine
Ride the time machine 
Flying through the history of your world
Ride the time machine
Ride the time machine 
Sailing through the memories of your life
