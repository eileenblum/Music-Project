There once was a time, when I knew you were mine 
There was never a doubt or fear
Now I wonder inside if you're living a lie
What I'm seeing is not too clear
Looking at signs that are plaguing my mind
When are you gonna see?
I'm climbing the walls, I give you my all
You mean everything to me

I keep holding on to you, I'll keep holding on forever
Holding on to you

Maybe I'm blind or you're just being kind
It's killing me can't you see?
There's a storm inside and you're drawing the line
You're pushing away from me
Let the lightning strike, I'm not gonna fight
Is this how it's gonna be?

I keep holding on to you, I'll keep holding on

If I crash into the ocean, I will sail across the sea
I would climb the highest mountain, if it brings you back to me
I will tear down every stone wall, I will set your mind at ease
I will conquer every burden, just to set your spirit free

I know your searching, but I'm holding on to you

I keep holding on, I'll keep holding on

If I crash into the ocean, I will sail across the sea
I would climb the highest mountain, if it brings you back to me
I will tear down every stone wall, I will set your mind at ease
I will conquer every burden, just to set your spirit free
