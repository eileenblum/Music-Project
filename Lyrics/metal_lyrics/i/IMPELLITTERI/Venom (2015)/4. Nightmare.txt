Welcome to my nightmare people
Fear all, all the madness that you see
Welcome to nay nightmare people
Save me, from my own reality
In my head the games begin, round and round they spin again
Thoughts deranged come back again, once insane it never ends

It's eternal agony in this nightmare, it's my nightmare

You, you never want to be, you never want to see 
You never want to crawl inside of me 
You never want to know, you never want to go
You never want to find insanity
You never want to do, you haven't got a clue
You never want to meet that side of me

All alone to see, my own absurdity
Don't you know it never ends
Please comfort me, until the world can see
Please, please, end this nightmare, it's a nightmare

Round and round I go, will I ever know?
When will it end!

You, you never want to be, you never want to see 
You never want to crawl inside of me 
You never want to know, you never want to go
You never want to find insanity
You never want to do, you haven't got a clue
You never want to meet that side of me

All alone to see, my own absurdity
Don't you know it never ends
Please comfort me, until the world can see
Please, please, end this nightmare, it's a nightmare

In this nightmare, it's a nightmare
