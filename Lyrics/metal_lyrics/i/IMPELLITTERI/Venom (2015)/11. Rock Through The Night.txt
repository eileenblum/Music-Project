We strike with a vengeance - fighting for the name
Taking no prisoners - blood is what we crave
Destroying the wicked - like a tidal wave
Push back the evil - that feeds us to the grave

We took, rock through the night
With our fist held high in the air
We fight, fight through the fire
As we stand in the rocket's red glare

We seek retribution - defenders of the faith
Call of the kingdom - battle of the brave
Fall of the martyrs - rising to the stage
Legends and heroes - never fade away

We rock, rock through the night
With our fist held high in the air
We fight, fight through the fire
On a mission that no one can dare
We rock, rock through the night
With the courage to conquer the grave
We fight, fight through the fire
And nothing will stand in our way

We rock, rock through the night
