Terrorists are moving in, trying to heal the world 
Falling angels in disguise trying to win the pearl

There's blood on their filthy hands
There's dirt on their knees
There's sand in their foolish eyes
This doctrine of death

The enemy is sneaking in, revolutionary war 
Nothing left but anarchy and dying by the sword

Where do they find the will?
Why do they lie?
What kind of lave is this
When mercy's denied?

Dominoes, falling like dominoes
Dominoes, they'll be falling like dominoes
When the righteous rise

Tonight, yet another terrorist attack on a government building 
The embassy there is under seige, and under fire
When will this madness cease? When will it end?

Dominoes, falling like dominoes
Dominoes, they'll be falling like dominoes
Dominoes, falling like dominoes
Dominoes, they'll be falling like dominoes
When the righteous rise
