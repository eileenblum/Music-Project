Jehovah, you've got to show me the way

Rising from ashes, tire and faith
Giving me power power to run the race
Out of the shadows, mercy and grace
Lift up the scriptures to show the way

If ever this world was my life
I'm watching it fade away
Searching a soul on fire
Now it's time to run away
Jehovah, now show me the way

Victims and visions, excess and fame
Deceiving the masses, a mystical game
Wait for salvation, selling your soul
Lies and corruption, surrender control

There comes a brand new day
When you wake up front this crime
There's nothing leti to save
But the soul you left behind
Jehovah

Wasted days, wasted nights, enticing words keep you in the fight
Seducing minds and lusting eyes, I know the time has come for me to go

There comes a brand new day
When you wake up front this crime
There's nothing leti to save
But the soul you left behind
Jehovah
