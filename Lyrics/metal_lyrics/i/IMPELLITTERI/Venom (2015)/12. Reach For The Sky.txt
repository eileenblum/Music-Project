You're beaten down, chained and bound
You don't know What to do
You're hating life, so full of strife
Thorns nothing you can prove

When you find you're down so low you can't get up
Lift up your eyes
Reach for the sky, reach for the sky

Hear the cries in the dead of night
The shadows cover you
All alone, a desperate fight
The walls caving in on you

When you find you're down so low you can't get up
Lift up your eyes

Reach for the sky (Reach for the sky)
Open up the light (Reach for the sky)
Reach for the sky (Reach for the sky)
Dominate the night (Reach for the sky)
Let's burn it bright
