Out on the streets its freezing cold
Without a shelter, nothing to hold
There's never a reason, never a rhyme
Find your hanging on the edge of life
Tell me your secrets, tell me no lies
The flood is coming, tears in your eyes
There's never a feeling, never a time
To carry the burden alone in the night

In this world you're falling, one day at a time
Until you reach for the light

Down on your luck you never know
There's never enough and nothing to show
Day alter day, and night after night
You're ready and willing to give up the fight

In this world you're falling, one day at a time
And when the wolves are calling, it's the end of the line
We made it, we played it, we face it now

Run away into the heat of the night
The grand illusion, the trail of lies
Over and over your hiding away 
Face the enemy (the Enemy)
The demons hide in the light of the day
Your self delusion, the price you pay
Over and over your slipping away 
Face the enemy (the Enemy)

Oh, take a look in the eyes of the Enemy

Run away into the heat of the night
The grand illusion, the trail of lies
Over and over your hiding away 
Face the enemy (the Enemy)
The demons hide in the light of the day
Your self delusion, the price you pay
Over and over your slipping away 
Face the enemy (the Enemy)
