I was a young boy when I heard the music call
staring at the concert stage my spirit craved it all
blinded by the spotlight, seduction rules the game
sold my soul to rock and roll,
there's no one else to blame

I still feel the power
I still feel it knocking at my door

hungry days
I remember hungry days

now I'm a young man I see a different light
shining down upon me, there's no fear, no end in sight
music is the magic and money is the slave
standing on the solid rock now
nothing seems the same

I still feel the power
I still hear it knocking at my door

hungry days!
I still remember hungry days
searching for my only fantasy
hungry days, oh, remember hungry days
time forever slips away
