every morning on the evening news
I hear the same ol' story someone singing the blues
disaster striking out and you're not ready
California quakes and the Midwest floods
see the hurricanes and the Malibu mud
ice and snow, you know it drives you crazy

I hear the prophet of the modern day
shouting out from the side of the stage

the kind is rising
will you be ready to stand up and fight

there's feeling all across the land
times are tough--getting way out of hand
crime is on the run and there's no safety
war in the streets, the economy
nothing stays the same and there's nothing for me
everybody's frantic for the sure thing

I see the prophet of the modern day
stepping out from society's cage

the king is rising
will you be ready to stand up and fight
the king is rising
will you be ready to lay down your life

I don't think he'll take any longer, no,
I don't think he'll take any more

[solo]

the king is rising
will you be ready to stand up and fight
the king is rising
will you be ready to lay down your life
