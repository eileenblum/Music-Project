Can't you hear the message
From deep beyond the grave
The cost of war is bloody insane
Dying soldier wounded
Gunshot to the head
Just an innocent man
And now he is dead

God will come again some day
And the wicked man will hang
On judgement day

Don't fear the devil
Cause pharoahs go to hell
You live your life under a spell
Blind men see your evil
Rich men love the gore
The judgement day evens the score

God will come again some day
And the wicked man will hang
On judgement day

[Solo]

The dying soldiers
And wounded men
Loss of innocence
Spreads the land
White house president
And all his men
Couldn't stop the end

Don't fear the devil
Cause presidents go to hell
Sold your soul to Satan
And with him you'll dwell
Blind men saw your evil
And rich men loved the gore
Judgement day is coming
And presidents
You're going straight to hell
