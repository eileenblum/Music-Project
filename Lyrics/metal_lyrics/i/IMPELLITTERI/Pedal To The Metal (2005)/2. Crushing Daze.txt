The world is closing up again
My mind can't break until it bends
Distorted thoughts to fuel my rage
Paralyzed by crushing fear
A host of voices in my ear
Let's me back inside my cage
Lock him up

Here take this pill and change the world
A new prescription you can't buy it in the store
So take this pill and feel no strife
It makes the stars align brings meaning to your life

BREAK

All this nonsense is killing me
All this nonsense is killing me
All this nonsense is killing me
In these crushing days

Inflammation in my brain
Enough to drive a man insane
A gulf of eyes to stare at me
My cage unlocked but I'm not free
A cast of demons haunting me
They say a new drug's all I need

Here take this pill and change the world
A new prescription you can't buy it in the store
So take this pill and feel no strife
It makes the stars align brings meaning to your life

MOVE

Crush... Anxiety
Crush... Anxiety
Crushing Daze

STOP
