I could never be a slave
To this hypocrisy
I would never stand in line
To bow at your feet
I will always fight your system
To my dieing end
I would tread through melted glass
Just to watch you pay for your sins

We all run in circles
But no one finds their way
We wander through darkness
Living in shame
Too busy staring
To notice the writings on the wall
Now I am certain
You've set yourself up for the fall

Tell me of your darkest fear
And set your mind at ease
When your world comes crashing down
It drops you to your knees
Can you live through life alone
With no one by your side
Would you feel as though your safe
If you had no place to hide

We all run in circles
But no one finds their way
We wander through darkness
Living in shame
Too busy staring
To notice the writings on the wall
Now I am certain
You've set yourself up for the fall

We all run in circles
But no one finds their way
We wander through darkness
Living in shame
Too busy staring
To notice the writings on the wall
Now I am certain
You've set yourself up for the fall
We all run in circles
And no one sees the writings on the wall
Now I am certain
You've set yourself up
