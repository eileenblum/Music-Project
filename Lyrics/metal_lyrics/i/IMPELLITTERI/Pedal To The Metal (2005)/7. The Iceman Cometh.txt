Run for your lives
Run

How do you like it when they say
You're nothing but a punk
Make fun of the clothes you wear
Treat you like your scum
Beat you down and crushed your pride
Laughing at your pain
Called you fat and pulled your hair
But they're all gonna pay

Parents don't know teachers don't care
When they're laughing in your face
Scars that won't heal memories won't die
Until they're all in their place
The Iceman cometh
Run for your lives
The Iceman cometh
Run for your lives

Morbid thoughts to fill my brain
Dark anxiety
Voices whisper am I sane
And red is all I see
Planning out your darkest fate
Faces in the mud
Time has come there'll be no wait
Makes them pay with blood

Knock knock remember me
The kid you cornered, punched and teased
Blackened eyes, broken nose
Now's your turn
Here's a fucking black rose

[Solo]

Parents don't know teachers don't care
When they're laughing in your face
Scars that won't heal memories won't die
Until they're all in their place
Nobody knows nobody cares
When they're spitting in your face

Scars that won't heal memories won't die
Till you put them in their place
The Iceman cometh
Run for your lives
The Iceman cometh
Run for your lives
The Iceman cometh
You better run for your lives
The Iceman cometh
Run for your lives
