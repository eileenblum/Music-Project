Ruled by wrath and cries of pain
Beware the words I speak
A name not uttered for 10,000 years
Titus' great city walls
Built by stone and chains
Enslaved the world with agony and fear

The Kingdom of Titus
Will crumble to the ground
The beast descends
We'll leave the past behind us
No time to make amends

Malachi the highest priest
With sand inside his vial
To offer to their gods of brazen iron
Blood of martyrs mingled
With screams of the oppressed
The offering brings a vengeance forged with fire

The Kingdom of Titus
Will crumble to the ground
The beast descends
We'll leave the past behind us
No time to make amends

Time no more for he is calling

As I stood upon the sea and beheld
Titus the mighty has fallen!!!

[Solo]

The Kingdom of Titus
Will crumble to the ground
Evil descends
Blasphemy has fallen
No mercy for their sins
Go make your mends
The Kingdom of Titus
Has fallen to the ground

Titus the Great no more
