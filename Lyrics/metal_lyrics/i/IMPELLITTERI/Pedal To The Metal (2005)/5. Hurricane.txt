Your sit with your eyes shut
On the edge of your seat
Nervously waiting
So pathetic and weak
Adrenaline runs through your veins
Fear slowly sets in
The bell in the black tower rings
The showdown's about to begin

They call me the freight train
Cause I'm the master of pain, pain, pain
With a fist full of lightning
I'm gonna put you in your grave
Run a way
I am the path of destruction
And yes the master of pain... Hurricane
With a fist full of lightning
I am the hurricane... let's dance

So you wanna take your chance with me
Skin that smoke stack
And let the whole world see
Ain't got time for your despair
Cross that line
You've got guts boy I'll give you that

[Solo]

I am the freight train
And I'm the master of pain, pain, pain
With a fist full of lightning
I'm gonna put you in you grave
Run a way
I am the path of destruction
And yes the master of pain... Hurricane
With a fist full of lightning
I am the hurricane... Hurricane
I am the I am the freight train
And I'm the master of pain
With a fist full of lightning
I am the hurricane... Hurricane
I am the hurricane
I am the hurricane
