Feels like we're losing ground
With every step we take
Why must we live in so much horror
There's not much time left
Before we slip away
And we don't have the time to borrow

A new day arrives
Another page in history slips away
But no one seems the wiser
Haven't we learned
War is not the way to save mankind
It only breeds destruction
Destruction... no one sees
Destruction

I can't make out that image
Lurking in the shadows
Looks like someone has lost their way
Billions spent on the bomb
While children end up starving
Could this be the only way

A new day arrives
Another page in history slips away
But no one seems the wiser
Haven't we learned
War is not the way to save mankind
It only breeds

[Solo]

A new day arrives
Another page in history slips away
But no one sees
Destruction... no one sees
Destruction... no one sees
Destruction... no one sees
Destruction... no one sees
