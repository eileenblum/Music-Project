Ladies and gentlemen
Please welcome from Los Angeles California... PUNK

RIGHT

Come on come on
What's your name
P.U.N.K... PUNK

Heavy metal punk
Right

Uh oh uh oh
Hey Curtis check this out

La la la la la
Listen up

Once upon a time
Eminem was the king
Until this California rocker
Dropped in on his scene
Now the critics and the cynics
And the suits all fear
Another rap metal whore
By the name of Punk with a P
A lot like me
A heavy metal kid on MTV
Girls, guitars and no rap jive
Heavy metal's back
It's about damn time

Come on get up
P.U.N.K... PUNK

Heavy metal.. Punk
Right

Un oh uh oh
You want some more

La la la la la
Listen up

Bubble gum pop and American Idol
Eminem's crime... Ha
He's in denial
Read his words and watched 8 Mile
White man thinks he's a black man's child
So listen up you can fuck Jay-Z and Snoop
And Dre and yes Fred Durst
Heavy metal's back and it's here to stay
Cause rock n roll is American way

So join the punk and sing our song
A new generation will be born
Rock n roll will never die
It's anger and it's vile
Join the punk and represent
The voice of America proud to defend
Heavy metal punks until the end
It's fashion and it's style
I am the punk
Heavy metal punk... Right
You can't stop this
Heavy metal punk

Un oh uh oh

[Solo]

Join this punk and sing our song
A new generation will be born
Rock n roll will never die
It's anger and it's vile
If you join the punk and represent
The voice of America proud to defend
Heavy metal punks until the end
It's fashion and it's style

Join this punk and sing our song
A new generation will be born
Rock n roll will never die
It's anger and it's vile
If you join the punk and represent
The voice of America proud to defend
Heavy metal punks until the end
It's fashion and it's style

I am the punk
Heavy metal punk... Huh

Uh oh uh oh

Heavy metal punk... Right
