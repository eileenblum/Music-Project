Welcome
Welcome to the gates of hell
Tell me did you dance with the devil
Or did you just sell your soul
Come children
Come to the darkside
And welcome to hell

I hear that Satan's calling
For this world to end
He marches on with his masquerade
Taking God's good men
All the kings, the presidents
Sold their soul for greed
Now the world burns
For all of eternity
In his hell

If you dance with the devil
Hell is the price you must pay
If you dance with the devil

On the streets of Paris France
London and L.A.
The devils men are tempting you
With money and his fame
With the money and the fame
Superstars, the money and cars
Girls and sex machines
Made the world turn
For all of eternity
In his hell

If you dance with the devil
Hell is the price you must pay
Burns your face to the concrete
You'll become obsolete
Demons come without warning
And you're just a moth to the flame
There's no chance for redemption

[Solo]

The world has fallen into a trance
Do we even stand a chance

If you dance with the devil
Hell is the price you must pay
Burns your face to the concrete
You'll become obsolete
Demons come without warning
And you're just a moth to the flame
There's no chance for redemption
Here lies the obsolete
If you dance with the devil
The image you slay is yourself
Burns your fist to the concrete
