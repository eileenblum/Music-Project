I know we're leading separate lives
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye
What's the point of being lonely
We just might make it if we try

So stay tonight
You won't regret it
I don't wanna wait until tomorrow
And let love pass us by
So stay tonight
If you can feel it
Because if we wait until the morning
Then love might pass us by

If you just give yourself a chance
You just might find life's sweet romance
What's the point in being lonely
There is no reason we shouldn't try

So stay tonight
You won't regret it
I don't wanna wait until tomorrow
And let love pass us by
So stay tonight
If you can feel it
Because if we wait until the morning
Then love might pass us by

Don't let love pass you by
We could make it if we try

[Solo]

So stay tonight
You won't regret it
I don't wanna wait until tomorrow
And let love pass us by
So stay tonight
If you can feel it
Because if we wait until the morning
Then love might pass us by

So stay tonight
Stay tonight
