Born in the Age of Technology in the year of our Lord 2033,
The earth has been poisoned and we had to leave
Now we're all afloat in the stars of the galaxy

Two thousand light years away from the sun
I'm trapped in a room in this space station
Tell me the stories, the legends, and tales
Of generation earth and how we prevailed

Generation, generation earth will prevail

There once was a time when our planet earth was the only place to live
But we destroyed it all by taking all she had to give 
And as we ride through the black horizon, I long for the days of old
'Cause I may never set foot on the wasted earth no more
(Wasted earth)

There once was a time when our planet earth was the only place to live
But we destroyed it all by taking all she had to give 
And as we ride through the black horizon, I long for the days of old
'Cause I may never set foot on the wasted earth no more 
(Wasted earth)
We took from the land all the fuel and power to fly to the other side
We got to find a way to cross the universe again 
(Wasted earth)
