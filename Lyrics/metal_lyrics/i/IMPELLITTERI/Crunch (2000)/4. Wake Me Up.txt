Thinking about the way you say you love me
Thinking about the way you say you care
Hoping that you could somehow spare a moment for me
But you never have a minute to share

Trying so hard to fight against the pressure
Looking' to find the way to make the grade
Banging' my head against my own frustration
There's no one but myself here to blame

I don't know what this life is for
What does it mean?
Does anybody really even care?
It's only a dream

Wake me up, wake me up from this nightmare, (wake me up)
Wake me up, wake me up before I scream

Talking to me like I was just a number
Putting' me down to make me stay in line
I'm trying' to tell you, but you never listen to me
My patience is running out of time

Sick and I'm tired of your manipulation
Waiting for you to tell me what to do
You're slaving away to buy up those possessions you crave
That's why I'm so invisible to you

I don't know what this life is for
What does it mean?
Does anybody really even care?
It's only a dream

Wake me up, wake me up from this nightmare, (wake me up)
Wake me up, wake me up before I scream
