Rich man looking down his nose at you
He's got the good life and you get abused
The Lazarus syndrome is in your face
Sores on your back begging' at the gate

Rich man dies and he goes to hell
Wish he had a dime for the wishing well
Send down Lazarus to cool my tongue
Agony and torment ain't no fun

Hell, yeah! The fire burns, and it's waiting there for you
Hell, yeah! You better learn 'cause there's nothing you can do

I will fear no evil, I will conquer all the demons
I will hear no evil, I will conquer all the beasts

Rich man begging' for another chance
Go tell my brothers avoid this dance
Can't cross the river the gulf is fixed
Misery, suffering, eternal bliss

Hell, yeah! The fire burns and its waiting there for you
Hell, yeah! You better turn 'cause there's nothing you can do

I will fear no evil, I will conquer all the demons
I will hear no evil, I will conquer all the beasts
I will speak no evil, I will conquer all the demons
I will see no evil, I will conquer all the beasts

Fear no evil

I will fear no evil
