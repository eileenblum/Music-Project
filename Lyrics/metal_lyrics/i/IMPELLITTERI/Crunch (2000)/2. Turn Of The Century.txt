11:59 and it's all going well, the next second could be our last
This is the moment we've all waited for, to see if the world's gonna' pass
The seer and the psychic, the prophets of the doom, are saying the world is at end
It's all coming down to the next breath of life, the fearmongers fate is at hand

Something we've never faced before
Nothing we've ever seen before
Will we all make it through the door that leads to the next century?

Y2K was a heartbeat away, still everyone sounds the alarm
Where did you hide when the digits all turned, did computers and power go down?
The party's alive in California, in Times Square the clocks ticking on
All over the world, spinning out of control, celebration 2000 lives on

Something we've never faced before
Nothing we've ever seen before
But we all made it through the door that leads to the next century

Fear of the unknown causes doubt
Millennium madness runs about
The Turn of the Century rolls on

The end of the world has come and gone
Believe what you will but life goes on
The Turn of the Century lives on
