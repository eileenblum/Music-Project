In the California streets at night
You can feel the thunder rising
You can hear the screams of tires in the air
All the racers in their street machines
Gonna' push it to the limit
Let the engine fly, let the power take you there

I need the speed, to touch the sky, it's my religion
I burn the nitro in my veins
I only live so I can fly, it's my addiction
I'm dangerous, I'm not insane

If I live to see another day
I'll be racing for tomorrow
Acceleration keeps me riding on the edge
I can breathe beyond the dangerzone
Where my freedom likes to hide
Gonna' ride the wind 'til I reach the other side

I need the speed, to touch the sky, it's my religion
I burn the nitro in my veins
I only live so I can fly, it's my addiction
I'm dangerous, I'm not insane

I'm a speed demon
I feel the rush, I feel alive
I'm a speed demon
Adrenaline in overdrive

I'm a speed demon
I feel the rush, I feel alive
I'm a speed demon
I'll never drive your 55
I'm a speed demon
