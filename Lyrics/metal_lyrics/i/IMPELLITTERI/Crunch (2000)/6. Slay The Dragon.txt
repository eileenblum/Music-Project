You've got ashes on the tip of your finger
You've got secrets in the back of your mind
You've been searching for the meaning of evil
'Cause you're attracted to the darkness of life
You've been playing with the words of a liar
And you're tired of the war that you rage
You've been hanging on the edge of the fire
And your pride has got you locked in a cage

You, you got to find the peace of mind that you've been looking' for
You, you got to fight to have the life that you've been searching' for

(You gotta' slay the dragon, You gotta' kill the beast)
(You gotta' slay the dragon, You gotta' kill the beast)

Running' through the night trying' to feel alright and it's time you want to burn
Carry all the weight of your love and hate, will the tables ever turn?
Running' down the road with a heavy load, trying' to leave the world behind
Listen to the voice 'cause you have a choice and it's time to draw the line

When you've reached the end of the road
And you find a hole in your soul
I believe it's time to slay the beast

You're still counting on the change of the seasons
You've been waiting for the passage of time
While your loneliness has taken you hostage
You've been hiding in a circle of lies

You, you got to find the peace of mind that you've been looking' for
You, you got to fight to have the life that you've been searching' for

(You gotta' slay the dragon, You gotta' kill the beast)
(You gotta' slay the dragon, You gotta' kill the beast)

Running' through the night trying' to feel alright and this time you want to burn
Carry all the weight of your love and hate, will the tables ever turn?
Running' down the road with a heavy load, trying' to leave the world behind
Listen to the voice 'cause you have a choice and it's time to draw the line

When you've reached the end of the road
And you find a hole in your soul
I believe it's time to slay the beast

You've got ashes on the tips of your fingers
You've got secrets in the back of your mind
You've been searching for the meaning of evil
'Cause you're attracted to the darkness of life
You've been playing with the words of a liar
And you're tired of the war that you rage
You've been hanging on the edge of desire
And your pride has got you locked in a cage

You gotta' slay the dragon
You gotta' kill the beast
You gotta' slay the dragon
You gotta' kill the beast
