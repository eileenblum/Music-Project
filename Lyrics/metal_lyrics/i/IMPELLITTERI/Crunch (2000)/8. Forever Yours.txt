Take a look at the world today, a lot of love seems to slip away
When the feelings start to fade, they start to run
It's not the way it's supposed to be, the flames of love only set you free
To make the choice that you want to be my only one
Life, they say, it can take it's toll, I'm holding on, I won't let you go
It's only you that can touch my soul, my love

I'm forever yours, I love you now for eternity
I'm forever yours, in time my love you'll see
I'm forever yours, I love you more than I ever did
I'm forever yours, it's always you and me
Forever yours

I remember when I began to see, the love we share it was meant to be
If only you would stand by me we'll beat the odds
Trust in me as I trust in you, you've got my heart and you know it's true
Together we can make it through, no matter what
The promises and the life we share, together we can go anywhere
It's only you that I give my soul, my love

I'm forever yours, I love you now for eternity
I'm forever yours, in time my love you'll see
I'm forever yours, I love you more than I ever did
I'm forever yours, it's always you and me
I'm forever yours, I love you now for eternity
I'm forever yours, together, you and me
Forever yours
