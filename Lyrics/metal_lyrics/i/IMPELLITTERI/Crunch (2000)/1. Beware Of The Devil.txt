Beware of the Devil
The devil looked into my eyes when I was seventeen
He said, "I'll give you all the world if you will follow me."
He dealt the cards, I drew the king
With this he was not pleased
And then he raised the stakes when he said to me: (I am the devil)

"I am the dealer I've come for your soul
Lay down your cards and I'll take control
I will bet your life if you dare to try, my friend,
The luck of the draw tonight"

The dealer tried to conquer me
But I would not concede
Now everything he offered me was tempting to believe
I took a look inside my hand I saw the royalty
And then I called his bluff when he said to me: (I am the devil)

"I am the dealer I've come for your soul
Lay down your cards and I'll take control
I will bet your life if you dare to try, my friend,
The luck of the draw"

"I am the dealer I tell you no lies
Show me your cards and fate will decide
I will bet your life for eternity my friend
The winner takes all tonight"
