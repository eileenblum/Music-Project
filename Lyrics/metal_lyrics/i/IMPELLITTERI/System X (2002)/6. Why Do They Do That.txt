Someone broke down my door 
Smashed the glass in the windows broken 
Then one more twist of the blade 
They just keyed the car 
No one here knows me for I just moved in here 
But now I keep looking behind me 
Seems pretty clear that I'm not wanted here 
Oh, why did they do that 
Tell me why 
Oh, why would they do that 
Tell me why 
In my new neighborhood 
Thought that I'd add more color 
They'd take me in 
And I'd be the adopted child 
But I think some shit would hit me with a ball bat 
If by chance I wasn't looking 
Fusion of conscience confusion to me 
Oh, why did they do that 
Tell me why 
Oh, why would they do that 
I gotta know why 
[solo] 
Oh, why did they do that 
Tell me why 
Oh, why would they do that 
Please tell me why 
Oh, why did they do that 
WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY 
Oh, why would they do that 
TELL ME WHY
