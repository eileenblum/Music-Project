First time I saw you 
I walked into the wall and felt no pain 
Could this be love 
Or was it just infatuation 
You wore those high heels and see thru dress 
You drove me crazy, now I'm a mess 
I wanna hold you all night long I confess 
Come to me and be my baby 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
I think I'm falling 
Falling in love with a stranger 
I think I'm falling 
Falling in love with a danger 
No complications, no kind of stress 
That girl is physical when I'm in her bed 
No masturbation, no fantasy 
She's hot and dirty and aiming at me 
My momma told me (to) look to the sea 
There's plenty of fish waiting for me 
So I went fishing and planted the seed 
Now she's wearing my ring 
Come to me and be my baby 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
I think I'm falling 
Falling in love with a stranger 
I think I'm falling 
Falling in love with a danger 
I think I'm falling 
Falling in love with a stranger 
I think I'm falling 
Falling in love with a danger 
[solo] 
I think I'm falling 
Falling in love with a stranger 
I think I'm falling 
Falling in love with a danger 
I think I'm falling 
Falling in love with a stranger 
I think I'm falling 
Falling in love with a danger 
[repeat till fade]
