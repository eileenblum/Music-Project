There's blood on the boards where passionate words 
Bleed down from the stage to arena 
The pilgrims are back with money they stashed 
A gift to the gods of the hour 
Never too loud drummer kicks the band right in the ass 
No one shot gun, they're all drivers - this is the master class 
Rock &amp; Roll heroes 
Forever immortal 
The masters of music 
Idols and legends 
The man with the voice has opened his throat 
Spits out the words of the story 
His fingers are speeding, shredding the strings 
Stripping them down to the wire 
Photographs on cotton T-shirts - 30 bucks a pop 
Ball hats, sweatshirts, come and get your pictures autographed 
Rock &amp; Roll heroes 
Forever immortal 
The masters of music 
Idols and legends 
Rock &amp; Roll heroes 
Forever immortal 
The masters of music 
Idols and legends 
[solo] 
I want my Rock &amp; Roll heroes 
I want my Rock &amp; Roll heroes 
I want my Rock &amp; Roll heroes 
I want my Rock &amp; Roll heroes 
Rock &amp; Roll heroes 
Forever immortal 
The masters of music 
Idols and legends 
Rock &amp; Roll heroes 
Forever immortal 
The masters of music 
Idols and legends
