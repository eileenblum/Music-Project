I'm sucking on a 40 with friends who just adore me 
Oh how they love that old English accent 
They of the black persuasion, missed out of being African 
Hard to hold back that bottled up tension 
Hide in the color of the white man's skin 
We'll do the evil deed, he'll fall for our sin 
Shoot to kill, can't blame that white 
His mom and dad will make it right 
Hide in the color of the white man's skin 
Do the evil deed, he'll fall for our sin 
No judge or jury would convict a white 
Your deceptions are black and white 
Broke out that golden carriage 
To ride to Greenwich Village 
Your turn to drive somebody said to me 
Because you're of that white persuasion 
You will never draw attention 
Who we take down and who is left bleeding 
Hide in the color of the white man's skin 
We'll do the evil deed, he'll fall for our sin 
Shoot to kill, can't blame that white 
His mom and dad will make it right 
Hide in the color of the white man's skin 
Do the evil deed, he'll fall for our sin 
No judge or jury would convict a white 
Cause the color is black and white 
[solo] 
Hide in the color of the white man's skin 
We'll do the evil deed, he'll fall for our sin 
No judge or jury would convict his kind 
The money and the power would make them all blind 
Hide in the color of the white man's skin 
Do the evil deed, he'll fall for our sin 
Shoot to kill, can't blame that white 
Mom and Dad will make it right 
Hide in the color of the white man's skin 
Do the evil deed, he'll fall for our sin 
Shoot to kill, can't blame that white 
Mom and Dad will make it right 
No judge or jury would convict his kind 
The money and the power would make them all blind 
Hide in the color of the white man's skin 
The deception - It's the perfect crime
