You sold your soul for a moment of passion 
And now your life is pure addiction, oh oh oh 
Burn the needle, inject your vein 
Leave behind your reality 
What kind of sanity 
Would throw their lives away 
They're way too young to be 
Part of the tragedy 
Ready to die for the grand illusion 
Risk your life with no hesitation, oh oh oh 
Burn the needle, inject your vein 
Leave behind your reality 
What kind of sanity 
Would throw their lives away 
They're way too young to be 
Part of the tragedy 
What kind of sanity 
Will take their pain away 
They're way too young to be 
Part of the tragedy 
[solo] 
What kind of sanity 
Would throw their lives away 
They're way too young to be 
Part of the tragedy 
What kind of sanity 
Will take their pain away 
They're way too young to be 
Part of the tragedy 
[repeat till fade]
