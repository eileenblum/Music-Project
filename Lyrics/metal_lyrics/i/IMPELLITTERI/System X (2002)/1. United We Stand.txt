It was 8:45 New York time when disaster filled the sky 
Death struck and the towers rocked, then we began to die 
All the steel came crashing down and rose in a cloud of smoke 
The world watched on CNN and stood in a state of shock 
You fool, I say to the eastern man, your evil ain't heaven sent 
You better run and you better hide cause you pissed off America 
We ain't gonna live in fear 
We're men of God and American 
United we stand hand in hand 
And when I touch the stars 
I feel alive in the land of pride 
I pledge allegiance to the flag of America 
This prick on a power trip unleashed the dogs of war 
You say you're a man of God but you're just the devil's whore 
You fool, I say to the eastern man, your evil ain't gonna win 
You better run and you better hide cause you pissed off America 
We ain't gonna live in fear 
We're men of God and American 
United we stand hand in hand 
And when I touch the stars 
I feel alive in the land of pride 
I pledge allegiance to the flag of America 
United we stand America 
United we stand America 
United we stand America 
United we stand America
