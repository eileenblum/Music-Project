There was anger and violence, fear and pain 
The world was in battle with Mr. Insane 
The psychotic leader felt no shame 
Killing his people for monetary gain 
The act of a madman Hitler before 
Lights the sky with nuclear war 
Chaotic confusion, hysterical fear 
An evil was rising, the end was near 
Lighting struck and the world shook like a hurricane 
For all to see 
The rise and fall of the land we called our paradise 
For all to see 
Heaven and hell 
It's the end of the world 
Heaven and hell 
It's the end of the world 
The president crying "What have we done" 
Hold your fire! No use for that gun 
The eyes of a nation scream in pain 
A burning sensation, it's nuclear rain 
People dying, what do we do 
Call the savior - the red, white and blue 
Lighting struck and the world shook like a hurricane 
For all to see 
The rise and fall of the land we called our paradise 
For all to see 
Heaven and hell 
The fate of the nation 
Heaven and hell 
The fate of the nation

Lighting struck and the world shook like a hurricane 
For all to see 
The rise and fall of the land we called our paradise 
For all to see 
Lighting struck and the world shook like a hurricane 
For all to see 
The rise and fall of the land we called our paradise 
For all to see 
Heaven and hell 
It's the end of the world 
Heaven and hell 
The fate of the nation 
Heaven and hell 
The fate of the nation 
Heaven and hell 
The fate of the nation 
Heaven and hell 
It's the end of the world 
The fate of the nation 
Heaven and hell 
It's the end of the world
