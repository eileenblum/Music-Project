That's right 
Love for money 
Walk the streets in Hollywood, spread your legs tonight 
Give your body to any man to pay the bills on time 
Oh don't you feel the shame 
You're just a player in the game 
Nighttime lover 
And though your makeup runs from standing in the rain 
The cars keep pulling over and you drive away 
She's a nighttime lover 
Oooh nighttime lover 
She'll never meet your mother 
Never meet your mother 
She's a nighttime lover 
Oooh nighttime lover 
But you'll never ever know her 
Oooh nighttime lover 
That's right 
In the heat of angel town the cops all know your name 
But they will never take you down, they've known you way too long 
So you'll never have to hide 
What you're selling on the side 
Nighttime lover 
I wonder if you do your crying in the rain 
So no one knows what you are feeling 
She's a nighttime lover 
Oooh nighttime lover 
She'll never meet your mother 
Never meet your mother 
She's a nighttime lover 
Oooh nighttime lover 
But you'll never ever know her 
Oooh nighttime lover 
[solo] 
She's a nighttime lover 
Oooh nighttime lover 
She'll never meet your mother 
Never meet your mother 
She's a nighttime lover 
Oooh nighttime lover 
And you will never get to know her 
Oooh nighttime lover 
She's a nighttime lover 
Oooh nighttime lover 
She'll never meet your mother 
Never meet your mother 
She's a nighttime lover 
Oooh nighttime lover 
But you'll never know her 
That's right
