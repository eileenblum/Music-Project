I got a camera round my neck 
No money in my pocket 
Here comes the "Tea a Wana" police 
I'm running, guess I lost it 
Then I heard "STOP" and I turned around 
And saw that gun aiming at me 
I gotta get home 
Gotta get home 
I gotta get home 
Gotta get home 
I never wanted to go there 
But I was told "You got to see it" 
If you can take all the verbal abuse 
And the smell of the streets, it's worth it 
Pharmacies like supermarkets 
Photographs on painted donkeys 
Real cheap booze to hold you prisoner 
I gotta get home 
Gotta get home 
I gotta get home 
Gotta get home 
I gotta get home 
[solo] 
I gotta get home 
Gotta get home 
I gotta get home 
Gotta get home 
I gotta get home 
Gotta get home 
I gotta get home 
Gotta get home
