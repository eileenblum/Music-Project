In the papers I read how they found her 
On her face was the look of death 
In this house from hell 
In the papers I read how they had found her 
On her face was the look of death, a forgotten prisoner 
In a small space under the stairs 
Hidden away for so many years 
No one would miss her 
In this house from hell 
Was an evil pill 
For this mother's baby 
Such a sweet slow kill 
Slow kill 
As they took them away, still said they loved her 
But they both had abused their child, it was a murder 
Dear Mom and Dad slightly insane 
Their little girl locked up in chains 
To be theirs forever 
In this house from hell 
Was an evil pill 
For this mother's baby 
Such a sweet slow kill 
Slow kill 
[solo] 
In this house from hell 
Was an evil pill 
For this mother's baby 
Such a sweet slow kill 
In this house from 
In this house from hell 
Was an evil pill 
For this mother's baby 
Such a sweet slow kill 
Slow kill 
In this house from 
In this house from 
In this house from 
In this house from hell
