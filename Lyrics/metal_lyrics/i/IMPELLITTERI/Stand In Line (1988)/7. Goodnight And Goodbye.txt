This is our weekend, just me and my car
Suited up for Saturday, to cruise the boulevard
I'm riding out on a street full of strangers
Looking at them look at me

We're lovers of the night 
Say goodnight and goodbye

I'm taking out some time to light this Cuban-cut cigar
I'm choking as I'm smoking it and holding up the bar
Keeping me cool in a room full of strangers
Hiding behind burning leaves

We're lovers of the night
When we turn out the light 
All we're really saying 
Is goodnight and goodbye

When we turn out the light 
Say goodnight and goodbye
When we turn out the light
We're lost in Hollywood
