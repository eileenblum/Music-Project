[Judas Priest cover]

Up here in space I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace everything you do

You think you're private lives think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape I'm watching all the time
I'm made of metal, my circuits gleam
I am perpetual, I keep the country clean

I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye

Always in focus you can't feel my stare
I zoom into you, you don't know I'm there

I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove
I'm made of metal, my circuits gleam
I am perpetual, I keep the country clean

I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye

Electric eye in the sky
Feel my stare, always there

There's nothing you can do about it, develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought and so my power grows

I'm made of metal, my circuits gleam
I am perpetual, I keep the country clean

I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye

I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected, detective, electric eye
