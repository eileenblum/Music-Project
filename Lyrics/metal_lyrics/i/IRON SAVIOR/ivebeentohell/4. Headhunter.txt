[Krokus cover]

I am the animal, my god, I am the beast
I love to see you bleed, so welcome to my feast
We're serving human flesh to keep you satisfied
With every bloody bite you eat, another's going to die

Don't give me politics, don't give me public schools
Just keep the cops and t.v. police, from breaking all the rules
I am the raging bull, no fear, no Sympathy
Sex and drugs and rock and roll, that's my cup of tea

Feel the heat, throw your bodies into the fire
Time to feed, Headhunter, Headhunter
Headhunter, Headhunter

My axe is clean and soft and blade is shining bright
She's hungry for her midnight snack
And heads will roll tonight, I am the hunter
Not easy to please, stand in line, she cures their lust
Victims on their knees aahh

Headhunter, Headhunter
Headhunter, Headhunter
Headhunter, Headhunter
