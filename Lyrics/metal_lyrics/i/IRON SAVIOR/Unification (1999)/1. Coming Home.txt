[(Music and lyrics by P. Sielck) All vocals by Piet]

Lost in the dark milleniums ago
Where is the place where's the place called home

On fire they rode to flee from the fall
Their future was doomed they've foreseen it all

Mythical world of the ancient empire
secret and hidden
but some day we shall return

Ancient calls from anywhere in time
we have to follow the sign
Distant voices - sources unknown
Where to they lead us
Where will we go
On the scent for the lost Coming home

[Riff Solo: Piet]

Chasing a shadow in stardust and haze
Where will we find traces of our race

The engines are roaring
we're leaving ground once more
is it for real - will we fail
like so often before

Ancient calls from somewhere in time
we have to follow the sign
Distant voices - sources unknown
Where to they lead us
Where will we go
On the scent for the lost
Coming home

[Main Solo: Piet/Kai/Piet/Kai/both]

Mythical world of the ancient empire
is it for real - will we fail
like so often before

Ancient calls from somewhere

Star of the old
guide us - give us hope
Star ...
