[Music and lyrics by P. Sielck]
[All vocals by Piet]

Am I alive, do I exist
Am I the goddess of justice
A body of metal, a mind made of circuits
Although I think and I'm conscious
What is my species, where is my soul
or am I dead as a rock

Is this my spirit or just a program
written on memory blocks

What is my aim
I am what can't be
A mind in a digital brain

It is the mind - mind over matter
The power has brought me to live
In lakes of doubts and oceans of my questions
I had to dive
Give me guidance - in torrents of time
Give me answers - creators of mine from the past
Mind over matter at last

So much to learn, so much to see
So many things to explore
Too little I know, am I a being
or just a failure at all

Please heal my pain
The silence of ungiven answers
will drive me insane

It is the mind - mind over matter

Conscious or dead - beginning or end
Mind of circuits - heal the pain
Going insane - lakes of doubts
Torrents of time - oceans of questions
Creators of mine
Answers I need guidance I want
Conscious or dead - beginning or end

[Solo: Piet]

It is the mind - mind over matter
