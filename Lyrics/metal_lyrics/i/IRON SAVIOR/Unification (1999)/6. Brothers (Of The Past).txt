[(Music and lyrics by P. Sielck) All vocals by Piet]

Devastation - radiation - paralyzing fear
Terrorizing demons rising - termination's here
Stratospheric - energetic- drifting on the stream
Agonizing isolation inside the machine

Reborn in chaos and war
What has it all been good for
Reach out and take my hand
The children must life, the killing must end

Brother - you must awake
Brother - before it's too late
Here we stand
Like shadows of great things in the past
Hear my call, oh brother
Let's right the wrongs at last

Lifeless bloodhound - executor of our fatal law
Blinded by your wrong conclusion truth you see no more

Now the defender attacks
The land he was supposed to protect
This is our legacy
Together we're facing our destiny

Brother - you must awake

[Solo: Piet / Kai / Piet / Kai / both]

Reach out and take my hand
The children must life, the killing must end
This is our legacy
Together we're facing our destiny

Brother - you must awake

We are brothers of the past
Uhh, let's right the wrongs at last
