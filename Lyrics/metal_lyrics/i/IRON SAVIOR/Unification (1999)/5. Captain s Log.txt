[Narrator's voice by Jason Breitwege]

It is the year 2110.
The world is threatened by war once again.
The unknown vessel sent out armed forces appearing to be machines to invade ear
th.
The air and almost the entire surface is now under their control.
Research on the origin of the ship indicates
that it might be related to the
lost continent of Atlantis.
So the answers are given in the past,
somewhere in the infinity of space and time.
