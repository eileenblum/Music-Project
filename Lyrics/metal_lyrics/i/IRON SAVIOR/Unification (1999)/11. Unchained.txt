[Jan:] A new day is born
In peace and in silence
Rays of the sun
Rip through the clouds
[Piet:] A new age is to come

[Jan:] The darkness decays
The heavens are shining
golden and blue enlightening the dawn
[Piet:] A New World will move on

So many lives
Out in the fields oh so many have died
Now we will rise
The chains that have held us are broken
and now we are

Free - from the tyrant
The conqueror's been banished
Free - and united
The throne in the sky now is
Free - free from the tyrant
Relentless we fought to be
Free - free and united
We have outlasted the war
The shadows of war

[Jan:] They came from the stars
to search a forgotten land
Rescue they brought
With thunder they fought
[Piet:] The tide has turned as the appeared

So many tears
Ohh, we will always remember the years
Earth has been burned
but then they returned
to save us and now we are

Free - from the tyrant

[Solo 1: Piet]

[Jan:] No more we'll fight
[Piet:] Return to the light
[Jan:] The conqueror's been banished
[Piet:] The savior has vanished
[Jan:] The mighty machine
[Piet:] a million life's dream
[Both:] outlasted the past
[Both:] out in the vast

[Solo 2: Piet / Solo 3: Kai]

Free - from the tyrant

After the war
The world is unchained
Freedom we've gained
The Savior's been banished
The fortress has vanished
In peace and in silence
The world will move on
Darkness and war
No more we'll fight
We have returned - returned to the light
