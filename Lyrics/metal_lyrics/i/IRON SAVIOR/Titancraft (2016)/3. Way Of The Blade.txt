Armies of monsters are marching
Bloodthirsty inhuman hordes
Straight out of hell they came to destroy
To kill in the name of gods

The king has been calling
The heroes to arms
Grim and defeat theyâll ride
Glorious they shall return to the hall
Fighters for honor and pride

They donât believe in the devil
They donât believe in heaven or hell
The only believe is the battle
The only fate
Is the way of the blade
Thunder is striking the darkness
The heavens are painted in black
Warlords have gathered
To follow his call
The king leads the attack

Axes are wielding and steel versus steel
The bold and the brave have returned
Back to the kingdom protecting the crown
And now the tables have turned

They donât believe in the devil
They donât believe in heaven or hell
The only believe is the battle
Their very fate
Is the way of the blade

The reaper was harvesting
Soul after soul
But showing no mercy this night
But those who will never return to the hall
Weâre dying for honor and pride

They donât believe in the devil
They donât believe in heaven or hell
The only believe is the battle
The only fate
Is the way of the blade
