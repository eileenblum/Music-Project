Endless damnation
Lost in the dark
Bearing the pain
From the needle in my heart
Memories are fading
Turning into grey
Buried in the sand of time
So much left to say

Longing for you
In sadness and tears
Lost in this nightmare
Of torture and fears
But now a rising star
Is shining down on me
I see the future
Youâre my destiny

Wait for me
Keep your believe
Pray for me
Iâm on my way

Far out beyond the horizon
I have been fighting for you
And from far out beyond the horizon
Iâm on my way back to you
Back to the light

To destroy the nameless evil
I have once embarked
Forevermore the agony
Echoes in my heart
Throughout the year on the killing grounds
Atrocity and death
You kept me alive
With every single breath

Fire and brimstone
Wonât hold me back
Iâm on my journey
Out of the back

Onto the rising star
Shining down on me
Onto the future
Youâre my destiny

Far out beyond the horizon
I have been fighting for you
And from far out beyond the horizon
Iâm on my way back to you
Back to the light

Look up to the gleaming stars
And think of me and you
And from the blackest night
Iâll hurry home to you

Far out beyond the horizon
I have been fighting for you
And from far out beyond the horizon
Iâm on my way back to you
Back to the light
