Resurrected
As the long ago foreseen
Brought back into the universe
In the heart of machine

Made of circuits
And memory banks
In ancient times
By mortal hands I must not fall again
For the sake of Atlantis
And man

And in fury Iâm riding the Titancraft
Into the storm
No remorse - no turning back
Star wings engage for attack

Raise the banners high
For the final stand
Ride out to fight and defeat
Raise the banners
Raise them high
For the freedom and sake of mankind
Iâll fight until the end

Memories
From a different life and time
Strange and so familiar
But never will be mine
Here I am now
Leading the bold
Into the battle

As foretold
Iâm taking the burden once again
For the sake of Atlantis and man
Atlantis and man

And in fury Iâm riding the Titancraft
Into the storm
Death or glory
Time will tell
Any which way
Weâll give them hell

Raise the banners high
For the final stand
Ride out to fight and defeat
Raise the banners
Raise them high
For the freedom and sake of mankind
Iâll fight until the end

Silence
Just for a moment
Just a blink in the sands of time
Darkness and light
Are living side by side
Goddess of the sea
Send me a sign
And in fury Iâm riding the Titancraft
Into the storm
No remorse - no turning back
Star wings engage for attack

Raise the banners high
For the final stand
Ride out to fight and defeat
Raise the banners
Raise them high
For the freedom and sake of mankind
Iâll fight until the end
