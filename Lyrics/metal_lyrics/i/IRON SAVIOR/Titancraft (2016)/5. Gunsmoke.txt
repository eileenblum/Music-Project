Way out west
On barren ground
Evil has a name
When gunslinging pistoleros
Are bringing on pain
They take it all and burn the land
Leaving widows on bloody sand
Holding their children
Mourning the dead

And when all hope was gone
Judgement came to town
Seven guns
To shoot the outlaws down
Shoot âem down

Gunsmoke in the valley
Justice to the land
Gunsmoke in the valley
Vengeance for the damned
Gunsmoke in the valley
Let the bullets fly
Gunsmoke in the valley
Say your prayers and die

And the shootout is beginning
Like a thunderstorm in the sky
Blazing gung are spreading fire
And the bullets fly

And when they stood their ground
Death rode into town
Seven guns
To shoot the villains down
Shoot âem down

Gunsmoke in the valley
Justice to the land
Gunsmoke in the valley
Vengeance for the damned
Gunsmoke in the valley
Let the bullets fly
Gunsmoke in the valley
Say your prayers and die

No more the children
Shall mourn for the dead
Glory to the saviors
Who came to deliver us all
Who came to deliver us all

Gunsmoke in the valley
