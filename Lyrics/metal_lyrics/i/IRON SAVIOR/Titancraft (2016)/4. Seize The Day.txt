Sometimes there are the days
When good is getting better
The sun is shining brighter
The world is at ease
When everything is possible
And nothing holds you back
The weight is getting lighter
Your mind is at ease

And when the clouds
Are on the verge of moving in
Donât be afraid
Cause the coast will clear again
Donât be late and ride the wave
Time is standing still

Donât be afraid of tomorrow
Right here and now weâll seize the day
Forget the worries and your sorrows
Hold on to the moment
And seize the day

Into the open range
You ride the wheels of fire
Nothing is forbidden
Reason overruled
Take down the roof
And make sure youâre wearing shades
Reason is for fools

And when the darknessâs
On the verge of moving in
Donât be afraid
Cause the sun will rise again
Donât be late and ride that wave
Time is standing still

Donât be afraid of tomorrow
Right here and now weâll seize the day
Forget the worries and your sorrows
Hold on to the moment
And seize the day

And when the clouds
Are on the verge of moving in
Trust your believe
The coast will clear again
Donât be late and ride the wave
Time is standing still

Donât be afraid of tomorrow
