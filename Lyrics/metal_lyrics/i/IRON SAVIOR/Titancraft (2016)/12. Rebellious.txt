Some call us losers
Some call us freaks
They donât have a clue
Whatâs driving me and you

The power of the music
The one and only force
Shining in our hearts
Like a beacon in the dark

Stand up for your right
To be yourself
Stand up for your right
To be unlike

Born to be rebellious
Born to be rebellious
Rebellious
Born to be unique
One of a kind

And when the world
Seems to be run
By nothing but fools
Time to make a change
Time to break the rules

Born to be rebellious
Born to be rebellious
Rebellious
Born to be unique
One of a kind

Listen to the words
Wise men had spoken
Sometimes the rule
Needs to be broken
Listen to the law
Wise men had spoken
Sometimes the law
Needs to be broken

Born to be rebellious
Born to be rebellious
Rebellious
Born to be unique
One of a kind

Break the rules
