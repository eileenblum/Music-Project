Helpless
Like a drowning on the sea
Broken hearted
Not half the man
I used to be
You stepped into my life
Like sun after the rain
To ease the pain

I surrender
Iâm giving in this fight
I surrender
Iâm giving in to love
Rescue me tonight

Uhh please forgive me
For the hurt and for the tears
I wasnât read
Still lost in all my fears
But in the end
The craving of my heart
Led me to you
Out of the dark

I surrender
Iâm giving in this fight
I surrender
Rescue me tonight
To the craving of my heart
You are the sun
That lights up the dark
You are the one
Forever I will love you
With all my heat
