Hey do-gooders listen up
Here's some news for you
You ain't telling us no more
What to think or do
Sick and perverted
Well, that's OK with me
You call us wicked
We call it destiny

Give me a break
Uh we heard it all before
"Seriously infected to the core"
They say we need a doctor
To get ourselves a treat
Well, this is how the diagnosis reads:

Rock 'n roll addiction
All therapies declined
Treatment and remedies denied
Rock 'n roll addiction
All therapies declined
Warning overruled
No who wants to get cured?
Don't wanna be cured

Driven by an overload
Charged up to the max
Feel like I could battle
A Tyrannosaurus Rex

Pushed to the limits
Never wanna stop
We're running with the devil
We're born to rock

Oh no I ain't taking it no more
Get lost we won't obey no more
It's them who needs the treatment
A lesson in free will
Meanwhile I keep staying ill, yeah

Rock 'n roll addiction
All therapies declined
Treatment and remedies denied
Rock 'n roll addiction
All therapies declined
Warning overruled
No who wants to get cured?
Don't wanna be cured

And like the sisters said
Back in eighty four
We're not gonna take it
We're taking it no more
We shout it out
And play it loud
It makes the whole damn'
World go round
No pill will ever cure this ill

Rock 'n roll addiction
