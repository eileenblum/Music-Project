Darkness is falling
The king is dead
Murdered by lies and intrigues
The throne abandoned
The crown is lost
In a maze of deceit

Hiding in the underground
Tonight rebellion will rise
Time has come
To right and wrong
This is the night of demise

Strike down the tyranny
Bring down these walls
Ride out for victory
Show no remorse
Blood will be shed tonight
For the sake of the crown
And by the morning sun
The walls come tumbling down

Ruling with fear and oppression
The land under the chain
Exploiting the country
Deceiving the least
Suffering under his reign

But tonight - just like a thunderstorm
The people are raising to strike
In the dawn of deliverance
The masses are gathering to fight

Strike down the tyranny
Bring down these walls
Ride out for victory
Show no remorse
Blood will be shed tonight
For the sake of the crown
And by the morning sun
The walls come tumbling down

Mortal fear creeps in his mind
For heâs facing defeat
Under siege - nowhere to run
Your time has come
Walls are breaking and the gates are bursting
The mob is seeking revenge
In the light of rising sun
Your time has come
