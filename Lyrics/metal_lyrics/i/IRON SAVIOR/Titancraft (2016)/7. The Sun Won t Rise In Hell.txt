Down below in darkness
Eyes are open wide
The beast is arising
For the night
He suffered in this prison cell
Punished by this living hell
Dead but yet alive
He must survive

And on his wings of darkness
He rides up to the sky
And when the pale moonâs rising
No one hears him cry

Lost in the darkness
Lost in the night
Banished from the world above
Banished from the light
Immortal creature
Bound by a spell
The sun will never rise on you again
âcause the sun wonât rise in hell
The sun wonât rise in hell

Night by night
He has to rise
To please the hunger
Heâs taking lifes
Driven by the curse
To stay alive
And when the devil smiled at him
Offering him mortal sin
He signed the deal
To get released

So he lived in fame and fortune
And finally closed his eyes
But the long forgotten contract
Brought him back to life

Lost in the darkness
Lost in the night
Banished from the world above
Banished from the light
Immortal creature
Bound by a spell
The sun will never rise on you again
âcause the sun wonât rise in hell
The sun wonât rise in hell

Inside the crypt
In his lone and solemn grave
He realized he turned into a slave
Locked up in eternity
He must fulfill his fate
He tried to fool the devil
And finally got betrayed

And on his wings of darkness
He rides up to the sky
And when the pale moonâs rising
No one hears him cry

Lost in the darkness
Lost in the night
Banished from the world above
Banished from the light
Immortal creature
Bound by a spell
The sun will never rise on you again
âcause the sun wonât rise in hell
The sun wonât rise in hell

Then came the day
Of mercy for the beast
Purified by fire
He finally got released
In peace and silence
He took his final breath
To finally embark
Towards the realm of death
