Far away
Beyond the abyss
In the kingdom made of machines
Brothers in spirit
Allied in arms
I must depart as foreseen
World after world
Dies in the fire
The killing must come to an end
Darkness falls
On the Galaxy
Proclaiming the final stand

Journey into the darkness
Throughout the endless unknown
Once again Iâm leaving the ground
Facing the mission alone

Brother
Brother in arms
I am the Savior
Follow the call
Brother
Brother in spirit
Bring down the hammer
And follow the call
Mighty one under the sand
Come and lend me your hand
Lend me your fist
And come with me
To ride out the victory

On cosmic torrents
Iâm rising ahead
Speeding at faster than light
Fulfilling the prophecy
And banish the upcoming night

Alone on the journey
Like so often before
My circuits are gleaming
In overload
And now Iâm coming ashore

Brother
Brother in arms
I am the Savior
Follow the call
Brother
Brother in spirit
Bring down the hammer
And follow the call
Mighty one under the sand
Come and lend me your hand
Lend me your fist
And come with me
To ride out the victory

Time is running out
On all man and all machine
We must fulfill the prophecy
This is our destiny

Brother in spirit
Come with me
To ride out the glorious victory
