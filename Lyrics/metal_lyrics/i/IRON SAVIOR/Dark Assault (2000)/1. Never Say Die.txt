[Words &amp; Music by Sielck]

[Like the Jaws of Hell the burning gate glows in unholy light. What horror lies beyond this rip in the continuum? The crewmen know that it is not likely to return, but never say die...]

I am your leader
I'm in command
The fate of all my followers
Lies in my hand

The burdon of what is right or wrong
Decisions have to be made
I have to take you all
Inside this burning gate

Will we ever come back
Follow me now
We will attack

Never say die
On wings of hope we'll fly
Never surrender
No never - never say die
Dragons of light
We're leaving tonight
The wings of hope bring us high
Never say die

Fighters are launching up into the sky
On fire they ride
Goddess of fate
Guide and protect us tonight

Into darkness and shadow
So far beyond
Oh, I don't know
If there will be tomorrow

Never say die...

Warriors hear my call
The Evil has to fall

[SOLO Piet - Kai - Piet - Kai - both]

Will we ever come back
We're going beyond
Follow me now
We will attack
Never say die...

Never say - never say - never say die!
