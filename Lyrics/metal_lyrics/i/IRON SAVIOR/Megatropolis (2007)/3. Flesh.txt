Evil is hiding in the shadows
Of the big, big city lights
A man-eating monster
Is crawling up your back
Getting ready to attack
Sick and perverted
A psycho's been unleashed
With a mind of delusion
He turned into the beast

And when the night is falling down
He's hunting in the streets

Flesh
He's a virtue with the knife
Flesh
He's eating you alive

Bloodstained he dwells on mortal sin
With a sick and morbid grin
He is the demon lurking in the dark
Enslaved by his obsession
He's ripping out your heart

And in the shelter of the dawn
He's pleasing his appetite

Flesh
He's a virtue with the knife
Flesh
He's eating you alive

Flesh
Flesh

And when the night is falling down
And in the shelter of the dawn
He's pleasing his appetite

Flesh
He's a virtue with the knife
Flesh
He's eating you alive

Flesh
Flesh
He's eating you alive
Flesh
Flesh
He's eating you alive

He's cutting you
He's slicing you
He's eating you alive
