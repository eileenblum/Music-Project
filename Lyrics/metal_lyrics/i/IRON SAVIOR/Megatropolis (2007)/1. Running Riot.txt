I'm burning up
There's a fire in me
The creature is rising
It wants to break free
The city is waiting
It's calling my name
I'm ready to be in the game

Mr. Hyde
Rules the night
While poor little Jekyll
Stays home alone
The Devil is smiling
The Angel will loose
And all hell is about
To break loose

Like a volcano
I need to explode
I'm diving in
To lust and sin
To be a fool
To break the rules

I'm running riot (riot)
No one will stop me tonight
Riot (riot)
Until the morning light
Sworn to fun
Loyal to none
Except the devil
And my favorite gun

All my senses
In anticipation
Of a perfect performed
Devastation
Fever is rising
There's no compromising
The Beast is unleashed
There's no turning back

Duties and routine
Keep tying me down
Unlock the cage
To leave the maze
To be a fool
To break the rules

I'm running riot (riot)
No one will stop me tonight
Riot (riot)
Until the morning light
Sworn to fun
Loyal to none
Except the devil
And my favorite gun

I can't resist
My temptations no more
The overload
Must explode
I'll be a fool
Breaking the rules

I'm running riot (riot)
No one will stop me tonight
Riot (riot)
Until the morning light
Sworn to fun
Loyal to none
Except the devil
And my favorite gun
