The sun is up
A lonely man
Roams an empty city
Omnipresent death is all around

Riding on deserted streets
In bitter solitude
Silence all around
Without a human sound

The days passing by
In dullness and pain
His fatal creation
Is all that remains

He is the last man alive
The last man alive
Sentenced to survive
The last of his kind
He's seen Armageddon
Destroyer and redeemer
Beginning and end
He's the Omega Man

A new breed of insanity
Is lurking in the shadows
They are the rulers of the dark

Altered into something else
Not human anymore
Children of the plague
With bleeding marks

What bitter irony
Lies in his sin
He holds the key
To salvation within

He is the last man alive
The last man alive
Sentenced to survive
The last of his kind
He's seen Armageddon
Destroyer and redeemer
Beginning and end
He's the Omega Man

The last man alive
He's seen Armageddon
The last man alive
Sentenced to survive
Then came the day
When he had found the others
To pass on his salvation
To bring back life again
He has been destroyer
Now he is redeemer
He is the beginning and the end

He is the Omega Man
