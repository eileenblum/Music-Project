Am I surrounded by madness?
Or is it just me
Who cannot see
The greatness of man
Fighting and killing ourselves as best
As we can

Seems as we're breaking
For nothing at all
People must wake up
This is the final call

But still I believe
That tomorrow
Be a brighter day
We are dancing on the edge
Though we're still in time
For that train we need to catch

There's a hole in the skies
The land is bleeding
Doomed to die
Selfproclaimed saviors
Are slinging the gun
Give me a break
I cannot go on

But still I believe
That tomorrow
Be a brighter day
We are dancing on the edge
Though we're still in time
For that train we need to catch

But still I believe
That tomorrow
Be a brighter day
We are dancing on the edge
Though we're still in time
For that train we need to catch
