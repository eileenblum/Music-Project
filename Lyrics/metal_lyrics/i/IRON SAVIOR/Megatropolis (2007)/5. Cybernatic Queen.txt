When the light of the day is fading
And dusk is drawing near
Seductively unsearchable
She appears
Her deep blue eyes of a cyborg
Scanning potential punters
A smile makes them believe
That they are the hunters
With perfect looks
She sells her goods

For money they will get
Her fantasies
Her lust and dreams
She'll bring them down
Down on their knees

Cybernetic queen of passion
A guarantee of satisfaction
And while she burns in fire
Melting down in sweet desire
Her heart is cold, so cold

So many men did fall
So little she cares
And even though
They've been burnt before
They're coming back for more
With perfect skills
She lulls their wills

And then she gives them
All their fantasies
Their lust and dreams
She brings them down
Down to their knees

Cybernetic queen of passion
Is guaranteeing satisfaction
And while she burns in fire
Melting down in sweet desire
Her heart stays cold

????

Cybernetic queen of passion
Is guaranteeing satisfaction
And while she burns in fire
Melting down in sweet desire
Cybernetic queen of passion
A guarantee in satisfaction
Her heart is cold
