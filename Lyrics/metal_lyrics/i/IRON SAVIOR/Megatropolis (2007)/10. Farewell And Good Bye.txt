I am immortal
I am perpetual
I am unbreakable
I'm bringing fire
That swallow up worlds

I'm annihilation
I'm a protector
I am a savior
A keeper of wisdom and knowledge
I can bring deliverance
I am salvation

Traveled the stars and even beyond
But all the places that I saw
Weren't holding what I'm searching for
Just some peace of mind

And how I wish to be
What I can never be
Forever I will be enchained
Chained to the entity
Of the machinery
Oh, have mercy on me
Set me free

Older than old
Never to age
A relict of ancient times
Deracinated - diluted
On the edge of insanity
I'm dominator
I am damnation

Existence is twisting my soul
I am ready to meet my fate
Give me salvation

None of my powers
Is holding the cure
'Cause after all I'm just a man
With a broken dream
Not man and not machine

And how I wish to be
What I can never be
Forever I will be enchained
Chained to the entity
Of the machinery
Oh, have mercy on me
Set me free

And how I wish to be
What I can never be
Forever I will be enchained
Chained to the entity
Of the machinery
Oh, have mercy on me
Set me free

I have to leave behind
The tortures in my mind
Farewell my children, goodbye
Forever I gonna fly
Like a star I'm in the sky
I'll be looking down on you

Farewell and goodbye
Farewell and goodbye
Farewell and goodbye
Farewell and goodbye
