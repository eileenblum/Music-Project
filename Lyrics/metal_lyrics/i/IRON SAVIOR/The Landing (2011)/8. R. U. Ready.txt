[Music and Lyrics: P.Sielck]

Ninteensixtyseven
A thunder in the night
A blazing star played his guitar
And metal did ignite
A Zeppelin was leaving ground
Heading for the top
Turned the world upside down
In a sonic shock
R U ready to rock

A whole generation
Born to be wild
Breaking the rules
Touching the sky
Never to die

Rockin' on
Until the night is gone
Rockin' hard
Until the morning sun
Rockin' on
For you and me and everyone
It ain't no matter of the blood
Just say you're ready to rock

Tell me you're reday to rock 'n roll

Smoke on the water
A rainbow rising up
And the gods of metal spoke
Take that to the top
And make it heavy metal
Breaking the law
On the highway to hell
Heavy metal thunder
Putting the world
Under a spell

Rockin' on
Until the night is gone
Rockin' hard
Until the morning sun
Rockin' on
For you and me and everyone
It ain't no matter of the blood
Just say you're ready to rock

[Solo]

Rockin' on
Until the night is gone
Rockin' hard
Until the morning sun
Rockin' on
For you and me and everyone
It ain't no matter of the blood
Just say you're ready to rock

Just keep rockin' on
Until the night is gone
Born to be be wild
And believe me
It ain't no matter of the blood
Just say you're ready to rock
Tell me you're ready to rock
