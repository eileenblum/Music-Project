[Music and Lyrics: P.Sielck]

If you wanna know
What lies behind the horizon
Go there
You gotta go there
Don't just sit around
Guessing what it will be like
You gotta be there
You gotta be there

You don't know
What might be waiting there for you
Don't hesitate
Before it might be too late

One billion roads to take
One billion lifes to live
The choices are on you
One billion ways to win
One billion ways to loose
Make up your mind
Which way to go

Play it save or dive into
Adventurous unknown
Hey, no guts
No glory
Don't be afraid to loose
Cause if you do you will survive
But don't miss
Your chances

Don't let the routine
Paralyze your soul
Cause in the end
It is still you who's in control

One billion roads to take
One billion lifes to live
The choices are on you
One billion ways to win
One billion ways to loose
Make up your mind
Which way to go

[Solo]

One billion roads to take
One billion lifes to live
The choices are on you
One billion ways to win
One billion ways to loose
Make up your mind
Which way to go

No guts, no glory
One billion ways to live
One billion ways to live
No guts, no glory
One billion ways to win
The choice is up to you!
