[Music and Lyrics: P.Sielck]

Darkness has coming down
On the planet of mankind
The hammer blow of an angry god
Left a bleeding world behind
Then came the fire
Burning on for a thousand years
Damned to life on
I'm holding back the tears

Heaven, send me a miracle
Make me strong
Give me a reason
To look straight ahead
To go on
Send me a miracle
And the world is laying down to die

Angel of doom
Your name is humanity
Playing with fire
In madness and blasphemy
Mankind take a look
Take a look what you have done

Arrogance and the blind believe
To be in control of it all
Made the dancer on the edge
Finally fall

May our children
Forgive us our sins
May the gods
Finally give them the power
To right our wrongs
Send them a miracle
And the world is laying down to die

Angel of doom
Your name is humanity
Playing with fire
In madness and blasphemy
Mankind take a look
Take a look what you have done

[Solo]

Heaven, send us a miracle
Make us strong
Give us a chance to repent
And to righten our wrongs
We need a miracle
May the world come back to life one day

Angel of doom
Your name is humanity
Playing with fire
In madness and blasphemy
Mankind take a look
Take a look what you have done
What you have done
What you have done to the world
Mankind take a look
What you have done to the world
