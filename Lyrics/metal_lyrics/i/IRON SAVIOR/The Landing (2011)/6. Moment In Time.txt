[Music and Lyrics: P.Sielck]

Down in the black hole
Where time's standing still
Something is lurking
And longing to kill
At the edge of the universe
A forgotten beast
Got released

Ten thousand demons
Arising from hell
Walking the earth
To the sound of the knell
Ancient evil is marching on
And the end of days is to come

Unthinkable - invincible
A power beyond believe
No escape and nowhere to run
The reaper is calling for everyone

And nothing but silence will remain
Will I ever see you again

Take my hand
For a moment in time
And for all eternity
I'll remember it by
Give me a final kiss
Time to say goodbye - time for goodbye
I'm ready to go
The evil must die

Tenthousand heroes
Embarking to hell
Holding the ground
Defending the realm
At the edge of the universe
They'll boldly stand til the end

Unthinkable - invincible
A creature beyond believe
I will fight for our love to survive
The reaper must wait til another life

And from the ashes of the storm
Our love will be reborn

Take my hand
For a moment in time
And for all eternity
I'll remember it by
Give me a final kiss
Time to say goodbye - time for goodbye
I'm ready to go
The evil must die

[Solo]

I will return
From the other end of the universe
To save and protect you
To keep you from harm
To hold you
Hold you tight in my arms

Take my hand
For a moment in time
And for all eternity
I'll remember it by
Give me a final kiss
Time to say goodbye - time for goodbye
Wait for me
For my return from the sky
