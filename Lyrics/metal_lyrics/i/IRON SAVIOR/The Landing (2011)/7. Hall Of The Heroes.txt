[Music and Lyrics: P.Sielck]

Once upon a time
In a long forgotten land
Warriors are gathering
To ride out and defend
Mighty steeds are galloping
Across the baron plains
Right into the storm
Bringing thunder and rain
Protectors of the realm
Defenders of the faith
Heroes of all times
Living for the blade
Keepers of the kingdom
Preservers of the crown
Thundering ahead
To bring the evil down

Never forgotten
Their deeds will be told
Until the end of time
Their legends will live on
Told by the fire
In the tales of the bold

In the hall of the heroes
In the temple of glory and fame
The fires are burning - the fires are burning
Forevermore - forevermore

Far beyond the oceans
In the land of the dark
Dreadful hordes of the evil one
Have gathered and embarked
Skies are turning black
As they come ashore
Setting foot to the sacred ground
In unholy roar

In grim defiance
The heroes appear
Standing the ground
With steel in their hands
Time for the battle
Is drawing hear

In the hall of the heroes
In the temple of glory and fame
The fires are burning - the fires are burning
Forevermore

[Solo]

In crimson sand
The heroes still stand
In glorios victory
They took the blood of the enemy
Another story to be told
In the tales of the bold

In the hall of the heroes
In the temple of glory and fame
The fires are burning - the fires are burning
Forevermore
[Repeat]
