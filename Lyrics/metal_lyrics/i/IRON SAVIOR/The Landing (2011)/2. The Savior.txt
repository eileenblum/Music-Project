[Music and lyrics: P. Sielck]

Out in the vast
Where time is standing still
I have been looking for sanctuary
Left the world behind
To find some peace of mind
Now I am one with eternity

Millenniums are passing
In the blink of an eye
While I was searching my very soul
Longing for the answer
To the question of it all
Is it man or machine in control?

Far beyond on cosmic winds
I have been meeting my fate
Now I see
That the answer's been in me

I am the Savior
The chosen one
I am the ultimate dream
I am man and machine
I am the Savior
The only one
And from eternity
I will return
Time has come
Time has come

Used to be a traveler
On a never-ending ride
Touching the end of the Universe
Never to rest
Always on the quest
For release from the eternal curse

Far beyond on cosmic winds
I saw the truth to it all
Now I see
What the future holds for me

I am the Savior
The chosen one
I am the ultimate dream
I am man and machine
I am the Savior
The only one
And from eternity
I will return
Time has come
Time has come

[Solo]

Far beyond on cosmic winds
I have been meeting my fate
Blessing me
Finally set me free

I am the Savior
The chosen one
I am the ultimate dream
I am man and machine
I am the Savior
The only one
And from eternity
I will return
Time has come
Time has come
