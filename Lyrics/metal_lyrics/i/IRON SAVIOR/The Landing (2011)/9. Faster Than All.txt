[Music and Lyrics: P.Sielck]

I remember the day he came
A stranger without a name
Through dust and sand
From no mans land
Faster - faster than all
He draw the guns
Never to fall
Furious and wild
He rides

In golden light of the dying day
Deliverance came from far away
A silent avenger paying the bad
One by one with flying lead

Pale Rider - faster than all
He shot them down
To bring justice to town
Pale Rider - faster than all
When the time had come
To draw the gun
He's taking an eye for an eye
Draw or die

In the fire and smoke
Of his roaring gun
He stood alone
For everyone
Furious and wild
He fights

He shoots to kill
Taking no prisoners
Just taking lifes
And by the morning sun
The stranger was gone

Pale Rider - faster than all
He shot them down
To bring justice to town
Pale Rider - faster than all
When the time had come
To draw the gun
He's taking an eye for an eye
Draw or die

[Solo]

In the light of the dying day
He's trying somewhere far away
Raining deliverance taking revenge
Paying the bad with flying lead

Pale Rider - faster than all
He shot them down
To bring justice to town
Pale Rider - faster than all
Time has come
To draw the gun
Pale Rider - faster than all
He shot them down
To bring justice to town
Pale Rider - faster than all
When the time had come
To draw the gun
He's taking an eye for an eye
Draw or die
