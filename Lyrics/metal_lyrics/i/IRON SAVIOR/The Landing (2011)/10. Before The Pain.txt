[Music and Lyrics: P.Sielck]

Sometimes I close my eyes
Thinking back of the day
Of this cold and rainy
November night
When you passed away

No more will I hear your laughter
No more I'll see you again
What remains is your memory
The tears and the pain

Far away
In the land beyond the stars
Somewhere in eternity
I know you're waiting for me

When the night
Is coming down
Sometimes it feels
As if you're still around
But I know
It's just a memory
Of how it used to be
Before the pain

The world ain't the same anymore
For those you've left behind
But we'll treasure the memory
Inside our very minds

Time heals the wounds
Slowly, day by day
But the scars will remain
They will never go away

When the night
Is coming down
Sometimes it feels
As if you're still around
But I know
It's just a memory
Of how it used to be
Before the pain

[Solo]

When the night
Is coming down
Sometimes it feels
As if you're still around
But I know
It's just a memory
Of how it used to be

When the night
Is coming down
Sometimes it feels
As if you're still around
But I know
It's just a memory
Of how it used to be

Before the pain
(Before the pain)
[Repeat]
