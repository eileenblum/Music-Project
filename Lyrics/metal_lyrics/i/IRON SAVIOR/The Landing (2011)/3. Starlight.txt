[Music and Lyrics: P.Sielck]

Here I stand
At the crossroads of destiny
Which way to go, which road to take
The choice is on me
Lost inside my very mind
A prisoner in eternity
Time has come to be free
Again

Oh how I wish
That my journey would end
To touch ground again
To descent

Starlight
Shine on me ever bright
Show me the way
Take me back
Take me home
Starlight
Mythical and ever bright
Shine on, enlighten me
Guide and release me
Starlight, take me home
From the unknown

Riding high on wings of fire
Purified and released
Alive again I broke the chains
I killed the beast
Possesing me - deluting me
Tainting my soul
But once for all and forever more
I am back in control

And so the journey
Will come to an end
I'll touch ground again
I'll descent

Starlight
Shine on me ever bright
Show me the way
Take me back
Take me home
Starlight
Mythical and ever bright
Shine on, enlighten me
Guide and release me
Starlight, take me home
From the unknown
Take me home
Send me a light in the dark

[Solo]

Leaving the boundaries
Of neverland
I am the savior until the end
Of Time
Now I am here to descent

Starlight
Shine on me ever bright
Show me the way
Take me back
Take me home
Starlight
Mythical and ever bright
Shine on, enlighten me
Guide and release me
Starlight, take me home
From the unknown
