[Japanese Bonus Track]Unknown unseen
We live underneath the radar
No sign on screen
We dance underneath the radar

Between the walls well hey
WeÂ´re just too small to make a fuss about it
Did somethinÂ´ fall well hey
Where is the point in losinÂ´ sleep about it

See you later see you later
Hip uh no no no no uh hip uh no no no no
I see you later call me

We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
ThereÂ´s no way that youÂ´re ever gonna get far
Huh huh huh so get hip

We speak unheard
Like ants we dance between the towers
We sleep they move
Come sailinÂ´ over the horizon

Between the walls well hey
WeÂ´re just too small to make a fuss about it
Did somethinÂ´ fall well hey
Where is the point in losinÂ´ sleep about it

See you later see you later
Hip uh no no no no uh hip uh no no no no
I see you later call me

We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
ThereÂ´s no way that youÂ´re ever gonna get far
We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
ThereÂ´s no way that youÂ´re ever gonna get far
Huh huh huh so get hip

He says I am the doctor in a B 52
I come across the horizon drop my love on you
IÂ´m gonna double you oh oh oh oh all watch out uh

See you later see you later
Hip uh no no no no uh hip uh no no no no
I see you later call me

We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
ThereÂ´s no way that youÂ´re ever gonna get far
We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
ThereÂ´s no way that youÂ´re ever gonna get far
Huh huh huh so get hip
