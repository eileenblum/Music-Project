Right out of nowhere you came
ghostlike appeared in the sky
But all our welcomes were shot down in flames
Superior power - invincible arms
a faulty assessment, a fatal misjudgement
but why you won't percieve
you won't percieve

Obedience you claim devotion you ask
oppression is all that you give
preserving the law the law of the lost
defining the way that we live

Assailant - lash of the world
ruling a throne - of ashes and dirt
We will arise like a Phoenix
again and again - forever we'll be
Enslave us and chain us
but then you will see
in the end the spirit is free

We never did you no harm
in peace we have lived united and free
you have turned our world into debris
a heep of debris

It seems we're defenceless in anguish we suffer
the raider that came from the stars
But we won't surrender with fury we'll strike
'cause this is the war of the wars

Assailant - lash of the world...
