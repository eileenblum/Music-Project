Dream the dream of a distant place
sheltered and hidden from the human race
Long ago leaving everything behind
out in the coldness to find peace of mind

Leaving ground destination is unknown
into the darkness and far away from home
Will your dream come true and what will you find
when fate is your guide

Riding on fire - touching the sky
Riding on fire - take you up so high
Riding on fire - with tears in your eyes
Riding on fire - and your heart it dies

Holy wars and tyrannies
Death and destruction but no one can see
Sanctuary in a ship made out of steel
This deadly wounded world will not heal

Up to the stars to escape this living hell
Pain and oppression you're wishing all farewell
Will the tyrant survive 'til the day that you'll return
let him burn

Riding on fire -...
Dreams where did they go 
reflections of thousand lightyears ago
Sadness and fear
seems the end is near

Up to the stars destination is unknown
into the darkness and far away from home
The tyrant will die on the day that I'll return he will burn
He will burn

Riding on fire-...
Riding on fire-... Riding
Riding on fire-... Fire
