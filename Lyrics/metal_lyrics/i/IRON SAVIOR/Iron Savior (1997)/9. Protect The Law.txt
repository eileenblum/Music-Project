From an ancient past I will bring you the law
To protect and to serve I was made for
My creators have vanished lost in space and in time
I'm the savior device now their battle is mine

When I'm looking down on you I see a wasted land
and the reason is humanity I must gain control

I protect the law - now and evermore
justice I'll defend - Guardian of the land
Crime has to end

My directives are simple peace and justice for all
your resistance is futile if you fight me you'll fall

My systems are in focus, locked on you
you cannot hide, I trace everything you do
surrender and repent

I protect the law...
When I'm looking down on you I see...
I protect the law...
