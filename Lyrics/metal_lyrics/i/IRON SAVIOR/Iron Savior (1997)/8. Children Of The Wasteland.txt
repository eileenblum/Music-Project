The war is over our life is not the same
Atomic fallout and clouds of acid rains
Above the world in a fortress made of splendid steel
you are the artificial knight
you don't care about what we think or feel

Be the guardian to guide us
Be the savior to save...
We're the

Children of the Wasteland
Sadness in our eyes
Children of the Wasteland
Frustrated hearts cold as ice

We cannot live we cannot die
in the land of the dammned
holy keeper of law and order
let us live or let us end

Be the leader to lead us
Be the savior to save...
We're the

Children of the Wasteland...
Be the leader to lead us
Be the savior to save...
Children of the Wasteland...
