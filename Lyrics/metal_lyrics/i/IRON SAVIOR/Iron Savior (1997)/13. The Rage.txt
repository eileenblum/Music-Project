[Originally performed by Judas Priest]

From a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all to make our own
Let us be left alone

Laid the tasks and paid the price
Everything survives
Crushed and bolted all the grain
After every wind what a stake we're in
It's paying better than the grain

When we talk without amend
We see better men
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
Will begin to shake with rage
