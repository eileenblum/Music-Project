A flash of destruction
like a blaze cut through the night
The heavens on fire
they were glowing in unholy light
Your sudden assault
broke all the dreams of unification
The hunger for power
it's the lash of civilisation

despaired and in pain - all seems so in vain

Fires in the sky
defenceless we stand tonight we will die
Shadows of the end
the Kingdom will fall life it will finally descend
percieve what you've done and repent

Careless we thought
all you do is to bark at the moon
But in the grip of fury
you have conjured
the dawning of doom
is this our fate - wiped out by your hate

Fires in the sky
defenceless we stand tonight we will die
Shadows of the end
the Empire will fall life it will finally descend
Goddess of the seas let us rest in peace
In her cold embrace we will find our graves

Silence will set in - will existance begin - again
Fires in the sky
helpless we stand
defenceless we'll die
Shadows of the end
the Kingdom will fall life will descend
Fires in the sky
helpless we stand defenceless we'll die
Shadows of the end
Atlantis will fall life it will finally descend
descend... for evermore
