[originally by Mando Diao]Break your happy home
Learn to sing alone
To the music, to the music
Clap your hands and shake
On a summer's day
To the music, to the music

I'm falling in love with your favorite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody
Dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance

Falling in love with your favorite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody
Dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance

I'm gonna dance with somebody

When you're all alone
We become your home
We're the music, we're the music
When your love's away
And you feel betrayed
We're the music, sweet music

Falling in love with your favorite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody
Dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance

Falling in love with your favorite song
I'm gonna sing it all night long
I'm gonna dance with somebody
Dance with somebody
Dance, dance, dance

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
