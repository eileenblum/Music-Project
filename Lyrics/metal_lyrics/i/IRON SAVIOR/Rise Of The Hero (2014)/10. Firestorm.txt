Contemplating
Investigating the mind
Strange dimensions
To which I've been blind
Shifting realities
Time has no meaning
A seeker of knowledge
The source of all things

Visions of darkness
Stroke me like a flash in the night
I have to leave the temple and fight

Into the eye - into the eye of the firestorm
Into the darkness, into unknown
Under attack - under siege
And when the day is born
I'm diving into the storm
Firestorm

On my journey through space and time
I saw the evil before
It came from far beyond the abyss
And now it's coming ashore

Civilizations of the galaxy
You must alliege in unity

Into the eye - into the eye of the firestorm
Into the darkness, into unknown
Under attack - under siege
And when the day is born
I'm diving into the firestorm

[Solo Piet]

Burning worlds and fire from the skies
But our hope is the last - the last thing to die

Into the eye - into the eye of the firestorm
Into the darkness, into unknown
Under attack - under siege
And when the day is born
I'm diving into the firestorm
Firestorm
