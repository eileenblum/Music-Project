Born in the golden age
Chosen by the gods to be the one
Hero of the heroes
Guardian and protector of man
Man and the universe

But in the tales of the bold it has been said
He will demise to the realm of the dead
And on that very day the kingdom will fall
Lost in the seas forevermore

And when the last - last hero will die
Tears of the gods will be falling from the skies
Forevermore he shall rest in peace
Until the day he will return
Like it's been said
Fulfilling the prophecy
He'll rise up from the dead

Sheer invincible
Superior but yet of flesh and blood
Altered and enhanced
He stood the test of time
To safeguard the world
Man and the universe

But in the prophecy of yore it's been foretold
Treason shall kill the last one of the bold
Lost and forgotten, his fire will burn
Until the day he shall return

And when the last - last hero will die
Tears of the gods will be falling from the skies
Forevermore he shall rest in peace
Until the day he will return
Like it's been said
Fulfilling the prophecy
He'll rise up from the dead

[Solo Piesel / Piet]

But in the tales of the bold it has been said
He will return from the realm of the dead
Until that very day the fire will burn
Until the day of his return

And when the last - last hero will die
Tears of the gods will be falling from the skies
Forevermore he shall rest in peace
Until the day he will return
Like it's been said
Fulfilling the prophecy
He'll rise up from the dead
