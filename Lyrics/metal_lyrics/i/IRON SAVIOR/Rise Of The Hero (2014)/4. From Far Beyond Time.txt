Thunderous
Like a fire drake in the night
I am returning, ready to fight
Furious
I'll be riding again on the wind
To bring deliverance and repent

Lost in oblivion
I stood the test of time
I am the prophecy
This is my destiny
Vengeance will be mine

From far beyond - far beyond
Beyond the universe
I will rise again
From far beyond the time
I'll bring deliverance
Fate is calling again
For the good of man

Thunderbolt - battle star
Titan of steel
Come with me
Let's ride again in unity

Man and machine
Together as one
We are the prophecy
This is our destiny
And our time has come

From far beyond - far beyond
Beyond the universe
I will rise again
From far beyond the time
I'll bring deliverance
Fate is calling again

Lost in infinity
Buried in steel
Dead and yet alive
Able to feel
But in my very mind
The spark of life has survived

[Solo Piet]

Out in the everlasting fires of creation
I saw the future - I saw the past
And from the dust and the ashes of demise
I saw the new world dawning
I saw the rise

Savior machine, time has come
Future and past will be one
And for the glory of the golden days
I'll carry on and do what must be done
And though my heart is bleeding in pain
I'll taken the burdens once again

Hero arise
To save the universe
Sworn to protect and to serve
And for the freedom
And for the world
Savior machine, ride with me
Fate is calling us again
For the good of man
