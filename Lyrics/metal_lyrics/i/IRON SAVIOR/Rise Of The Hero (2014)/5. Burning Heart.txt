Who do you think you are
To tell us what to do
What makes us minor to you
We don't need advice
We don't need no smartass talking
Look at yourself and keep on walking

Leave me alone
With all your words of wisdom
For once and all
For once and all time
This is the bottom line

Take your life
Live it your way
Forge it in the amber
Of a burning heart
Living
For tomorrow
Taking on the future
With a burning heart

Blinded by conformity
Obedience and rules
Now who are you to call us fools
We won't adapt
We are different, we're unique
And your egomania
Makes me goddamn sick

Leave me alone
I'm gonna make it on my own
For once and all
For once and all time
Here is my bottom line

Take your life
Live it your way
Forge it in the amber
Of a burning heart
Living
For tomorrow
Taking on the future
With a burning heart

[Solo Piet]

We don't need your guiding star
No need to tell us who we are
Leave us alone
For once and for all time
And once again
Here comes the bottom line

Take your life
Live it your way
Forge it in the amber
Of a burning heart
Living
For tomorrow
Taking on the future
With a burning heart

Live - for tomorrow
Live it your way
A burning heart
Live - for tomorrow
Taking on the future
With a burning heart and soul
A burning heart and soul
