Iron fists are pumping
The beat is driving hard
Cutting like a razor
They're riffing down the chords
Sweat is dripping on the floor
In the gleaming light
The beast is breathing fire
Thunder strikes the night

Living for the moment
Living for the day
Don't care for tomorrow
Don't care what they say
Raise your glasses high

And keep that fire burning
Keep the amber hot
Never lose the thunder
Never stop to rock
Raise your fist
And set your spirit free
Heavy metal
Is our chosen way to be

Furious, going wild
Rocking to the beat
Soaking up the energy
The power and the heat

This is the medicine
The one and only cure
No flavours added
It's sheer and pure
So if you're feeling ill
Just take the pill

And keep that fire burning
Keep the amber hot
Never lose the thunder
Never stop to rock
Raise your fist
And set your spirit free
Heavy metal is our deal

[Solo Piesel / Piet]

Out there is a shadow
Lurking in the dark
Creeping up unseen
Straight in your heart
Take heed - when indifference
Is trying to take your soul
Turn on the music
And get back in control

This is the drug
The one and only cure
No flavours added
Sheer and pure
Raise your glasses high

And keep that fire burning - OH OH OH
And keep the amber hot - OH OH OH
No, never lose your thunder - OH OH OH
Come on and raise your fist
Bang your head

And keep that fire burning
Keep the amber hot
Never lose your thunder
Never stop to rock
Raise your fist
And set your spirit free
Shout it out
Loud and proud
Heavy metal
Is our chosen way to be

13. I've Been to Hell 2014 (Limited Edition Bonus)

[Remake from 'Dark Assault', 2000]

I saw my children from up in the sky
Bleeding and sentenced to die
Devastation and termination
I've been your angel of death
Watching unmoved
I've been awaiting your final breath

Children forgive me
For I've been so wrong
Fate took revenge
Oh, on all I have done

I've been to Hell
I've seen the fires burning
Oh, I saw Hell
Demons I heard you calling

So many years I've been out there alone
Broken and scared to the bone
Out in the dark
Sorrow and grief possessed my heart

Out of control
In this deadly machine
Innocent victims
Are haunting my dreams

I've been to Hell
I've seen the fires burning
Oh, I saw Hell
Demons I heard you calling

Rage
Agony
Endless pain
I'll never be the same

[Solo Piet]

Cast away
Today
Light years away from home
Blood on my hands
I will redeem
I will repent

No more repugnance between the machine
And my tortured mind
Together we're strong - now we are one
One of a kind

I've been to Hell
I've seen the fires burning
Oh, I saw Hell
Demons I heard you calling
To Hell

To Hell I have been to pay for my sin
But no more I'll burn - I shall return
Demons of darkness
You've been calling me
But I'm clear in my mind now
And I'm on my way and I am free

14. Mind Over Matter 2014 (Japanese Bonus)

[Remake from 'Unification', 1999]

Hwauuh!

[Piet:] Am I alive
[Jan:] Do I exist
[Piet:] Am I the goddess of justice

[Piet:] A body of metal
[Jan:] A mind made of circuits
[Piet:]Although I think and I'm conscious

[Piet:] What is my species
[Jan:] where is my soul
[Piet:] or am I dead as a rock

[Piet:] Is this my spirit
[Jan:] Or just a program
[Piet:] Written on memory blocks

What is my aim
I am what can't be
A mind in a digital brain

Mind over matter
The power has brought me to life
In lakes of doubts and oceans of my questions
I had to dive
Give me guidance - in torrents of time
Give me answers - creators of mine from the past
Mind over matter at last

[Piet:] So much to learn
[Jan:] So much to see
[Piet:] So many things to explore

[Piet:] Too little I know
[Jan:] Am I a being
[Piet:] Or just a failure at all

Please heal my pain
The silence of ungiven answers
will drive me insane

Mind over matter
The power has brought me to life
In lakes of doubts and oceans of my questions
I had to dive
Give me guidance - in torrents of time
Give me answers - creators of mine from the past
Mind over matter at last

A mind made of circuits
Lakes of doubts
Creators of mine
Conscious or dead
Beginning or end

[Solo Piet]

Mind over matter
The power has brought me to life
In lakes of doubts and oceans of my questions
I had to dive
Give me guidance - in torrents of time
Give me answers - creators of mine from the past

Mind over matter
Something has happened
This is the mind ruling the matter
The power has brought me to life
Give my guidance
In torrents of time
Give me answers
Creators of mine
Mind over matter at last

At last
