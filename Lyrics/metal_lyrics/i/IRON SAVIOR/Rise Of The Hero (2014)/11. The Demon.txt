Silence
Just the wind and a grave
Sanctuary
Where he can be safe

Safe from the shadow
Devouring his soul
The haunting delusions
When the demon was taking control

Lost inside the realm of darkness
Lost inside the nightmare and the fears
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
When the demon takes the mind

Memories
And a stone with his name
No more tears anymore
But the grief remains

I saw him laughing
I heard him cry
I saw him suffering
Tortured by the pain
I saw him die

Lost inside the realm of darkness
Lost inside the nightmare and the fears
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
When the demon takes...

They say thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
The praise your never-ending love for everyone
God, then tell me - what has been his devilment
To curse him with your punishment
I don't believe in you - how could I...

[Solo Piet]

And though the world has been turning
For those he left behind
The candles are burning forever
He'll stay on our mind

Lost inside the realm of darkness
Lost inside the nightmare and the fears
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
When the demon takes the mind

Lost inside the nightmare and the fears
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
When the demon takes the mind

Lost inside the realm of darkness
Lost inside the nightmare and the fears
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
When the demon takes the mind
