I'm drifting away my systems are failing
I will not return back to my home
to ones I love

I'm fading away
my hopes and my dreams
they will never come true
silent the stars
are gleaming above

I'm feeling cold
stonecold
out in the vast
I will not outlast
stonecold
lost without trace
I'm loosing the race
I want to be near you
I just want to feel you
My heart turns cold
cold as a stone

So many years
thinking of you I can't hold back the tears
I'm all alone with a million of fears

Uhh, I want you so bad and it hurts
I can't stand the pain anymore
please, godess of fate
I'm down on my knees

I'm feeling cold
stonecold

This is the end
and I will close my eyes forever
I won't return to you my love

I will see you again
somewhere in space and in time
there's a place
I wrote my farewell
in the stars above

I'm feeling cold
stonecold
