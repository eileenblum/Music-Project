I'm watching the mountains
I'm watching the sea
observing the creatures
I am lost - set me free!

Across the heavens I made my way
I' ve seen empires rise and blown away
I have arrived my destiny
but after all there's just emptiness in me

Out in the darkness - I am going mad
Where are the others - there's silence in my head

'Cause I'm a watcher in the sky
I've seen universes die
Out in the cold my systems overload
I'm here and lost in time
Watcher in the sky - sky

I am trapped in this nightmare
endless tortures and pain
milleniums have gone by
Uhhh, it drives me insane!

Who am I now?
I'm not a man - I'm not machine
I gave my life for it for the Iron Savior dream
'Cause I'm a watcher in the sky...

Hooked - hooked to the circuts
of a lifeless, cold machine
Lost in a world of artificial means
Ripped - ripped out of my body
I'll stand the test of time
Am I perpetual - Am I devine?

I'm the watcher in the sky
My soul has drowned
in the tears I cannot cry
I'm the watcher the chosen one
but I am lost in time
I'm the watcher in the sky
I've seen the years gone by
I am the choosen one
out in the cold my systems overload
I'm here and lost in time
Watcher in the sky - sky
watching the mountains
watching the sea
watching the creatures
You'll never be free
Watcher in the sky - sky
