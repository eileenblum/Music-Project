Nowhere to run
you're out of control
The darkness came over you
it has blackened your soul
your eyes're burning red
as bright as the rising sun
seems there is nothing
no way to overcome
your grief!

Lost in a world
of misery and despair
try to deny it
but the pain is always there

Inside your walls of sorrow
you cannot see tomorrow

Touching the rainbow
fly up and away
Escape from the shadow
the night's always followed by day
Nothing's forever - forever in life
Raise your head - look up to the sky
Your wings have been burned
but still you can learn how to fly
fly again

You say you can't stand it
you can't take it anymore
Do not surrender
it's yourself you're fighting for
Broken and wounded
in the grip of agony
Stand up - and make a change
or is this what you wanna be

Break through your walls of sorrow
and you will see tomorrow

Touching the rainbow

Within the walls
the walls of sorrow
you cannot see tomorrow
Tear down the walls
the walls of sorrow
and you will see tomorrow

Touching the rainbow
fly up and away
Escape from the shadow
the night's always followed by day
Come with me
and you will see
spread your wings and fly

Touching the rainbow
fly up and away
Escape from the shadow
the night's always followed by day
There's a land up in the sky
take my hand and fly
Fly again
