A species of violence
has landed ashore our hemisphere
They're crossing the borders
their mercyless killers are everywhere

But we're not defenseless
our ancient brothers will stand
to head off the slaughter
from our common land

The alien assailants
are pounding the world
The war will begin
Throughout the years
of the savior we've learned
We'll never give in

This is the hatchet of war
and we have used it before
You may try to break us
you may try to take us
fear the hatchet of war
die or withdraw

Starbirds are launching
the thrust of their engines
roars into thunder and rain
They break through the clouds
Oh, will they come back again

Fingers of light in unholy gleam
a blast of energy
The battle is on
alien or man
we shall all meet our destiny

The alien assailants
are pounding the world
The war will begin
Throughout the years
of the savior we've learned
We'll never give in

This is the hatchet of war

United we will stand
together we'll fight 'til the end
We raise our banners high
defiant we'll break through the sky

This is the hatched of war
and we have used it before

This is the hatched of war
Fear our hatched of war
