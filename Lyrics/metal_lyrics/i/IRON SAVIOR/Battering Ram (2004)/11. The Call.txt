[Bonus track]

Ancient is the hunger
Ancient is the vow
Driven by the power
To live it here and now
Follow the unwritten law
Taking no command
Bow your head to no one
With a mind that won't bend

Rule or be ruled
We'll leave that up to you
To turn around or stand your ground
Faithful and true furious
Ride with us
Go against the grain

Hey - to Metal we are sworn
Hey - one finger to the scorn
Hey - it's power unites us all
It's in the blood
Can you hear the call

Freedom needs no justification
Follow your heart to your destination

Take a look to the left
Take a look to the right
It ain't just always straight
Ahead it ain't just black and white
To bang against the wall
Might be a waste of time
An open mind will find a way
And that's my bottom line

Raise the force
Come with us
Go against the grain

Hey - to Metal we are sworn
Hey - one finger to the scorn
Hey - it's power unites us all
It's in the blood
Can you hear the call

[Solo: Piet]

Hey - to Metal we are sworn
Hey - one finger to the scorn
Hey - it's power unites us all
It's in the blood
Can you hear the call
