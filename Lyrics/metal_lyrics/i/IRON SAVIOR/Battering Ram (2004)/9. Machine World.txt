[Music and Lyrics by Sielck]

Projected images
of what the world is like
trying to find the answer
in every single byte
what is reality
and is my spirit real
is it made of true emotions
or artificial feel
what is existence
and what defines to be
can there be life
in a programmed virtuality
I am a god
I am life - I am creation
I am a demon
I am death - I'm termination
I am perpetual, I'm everlasting
till the end of time
for all my wisdom cannot answer
all the questioning of mine

machine world
one million years of pain
down below under the desert
machine world
damnation to remain
in a cybernetic land
deep down below the desert sand
machine world
countless eyes are questing
for the mystery of life
gathering information
to be processed in my drive
I need to find the essence
reason why I'm here
therefore I'm not paying heed
I'm a killer spreading fear

Oh I'm love and I'm hate
I am a sinner
I'm a devil - I'm a saint
I am perpetual, I'm damned
for all eternity to be
and all the knowledge
and the wisdom
it cannot make me see
the meaning of reality

machine world
one million years of pain
...

[solo]
[Piet - Piesel - Piet - Piesel]

projected images...
what is reality...

I am a god
I am life - I am creation
I am a demon
I am death - I'm termination
I am perpetual, I'm damned
for all eternity to be
forever I'll be
and all the knowledge and the wisdom
it cannot make me see
the meaning of reality

machine world
one million years of pain
down below under the desert
machine world
damnation to remain
in a cybernetic land

machine world
heart of the machine
machine world
machine world
I'm in a cybernetic dream
machine world
damned forever
