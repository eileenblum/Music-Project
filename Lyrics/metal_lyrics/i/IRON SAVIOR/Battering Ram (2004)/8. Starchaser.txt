[Music by Kustner/Sielck, Lyrics by Sielck]

Up in the skies
the stars are shining bright
on what is called the human kind
in silent majesty
they're watching from up there
this overbearing planet's vanity fair
voices in the distance
keep on whispering to me
now I have to follow
to set my spirit free

starchaser - skies are open wide
starchaser - calling me from deep inside
starchaser - I have crossed the line
starchaser - I'm diving into space and time
to be free

for all so long
I've been in search to find
my destiny, some peace of mind
it seems like everything
I did just wasn't right
life seemed to be a futile fight

it's almost been too late
to understand, to turn around
but here I am
I have been leaving ground

starchaser - skies are open wide
...

[solo Piesel]

till the end of time
the universe is mine
my fate lies in my hand
and if even though
the world will never now
my fate lies in my very hand
for now and for all times

starchaser - skies are open wide
starchaser - calling me from deep inside
starchaser - the universe is mine
starchaser - I'm diving into space and time
to be free
