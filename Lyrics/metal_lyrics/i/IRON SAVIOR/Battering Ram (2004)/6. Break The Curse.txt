[Music and Lyrics by Sielck]

Another wasted night ahead
another wasted day
stuck in a dead end
with a monster in your head
feeding on your energy
taking over control
makes you obey
spilling poison to the soul
in dull submission
you won't track down its hide
it's the indifference
that made you blind

break the curse
time is running short
shorter than you think
break the curse

from very deep inside your mind
a voice is calling you
saying:
there's gotta be more to life than you know

shake off the routine from your mind
and leave the treadmill far behind

break the curse
...
break it up

[solo Piesel - Piet]

don't let the demon of conformity
destroy it all
what's still there waiting to be free

go kill the monster in your head
you gotta gotta gotta
burn down the treadmill
and move straight ahead

break the curse
...

stand up and raise your fist up high
and make two fingers pointing to the sky
