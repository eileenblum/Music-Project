[Music and Lyrics by Sielck]

Wind is howling through dusty canyons
a burning sun in a dying land
scorching heat in the plains of death
where blazing fire was taking a breath
here I stand in the desert sand
looking at what once has been
but all I see is wasted world
nothing's outlasted our sins
once we've been ruling
in valleys of green
now we are chained
in a realm of the machines

time - only time will tell
if there'll be heaven or hell
time - only time will tell
if there'll be heaven or hell
trails of destruction are marking the truth
testify to insanity
we challenged creation
the arrogance died
atomic thunder was burning the sky

seems as we're lost in the twilight of decay
unbent we'll break the chains
to rise again some day

time - only time will tell
if there'll be heaven or hell

the machinery is marching
as their powers are enlarging
built with precision and perfection
to serve a perfect world, to give protection
command turned into slavery
this is the bitter irony of history
but we will fight

[solo Piet]

time - only time will tell
if there'll be heaven or hell
...
