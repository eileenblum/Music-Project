[Music and Lyrics by Sielck]

Sometimes I dream
of a place to forget
where I would find some peace of mind
but the world just ain't like that
holy wars - armies are marching
terror is lashing the land
an eye for an eye - blood for blood
death in the name of god
sometimes I wish myself just far away
to spread out my wings and fly away
here in my mind
I can leave it all behind

to ride on the wind
like an eagle in the skies
high above the land and sea
I'm riding free
higher and higher
ascending to the skies
where no one takes my liberty
I'm riding free - I'm riding free

Memories
forever they?re gonna last
shook my heart to the very ground
as the walls came tumbling down
almighty towers are grinded to dust
a graveyard of rubble remains
I saw them crying - I saw them dying
as they've been burned in the flames

sometimes I wish myself just far away
to spread out my wings and fly away
onto a land
where my fate is in my hand

I'm riding the wind
like an eagle in the skies
...

escalating violence
in circles of brutality
suicide assassins
but there ain't no victory
fanatic believers - religious deceivers
the holy land is soiled with blood
attack - revenge - hi-tech war
in the name of god

[solo Piet]

open up your eyes
and look up to the skies
spread your wings and fly away
just for a while
forget about your sorrow
there'll always be tomorrow
let the wind take you far away

ride on the wind
like an eagle in the skies
...

riding free
