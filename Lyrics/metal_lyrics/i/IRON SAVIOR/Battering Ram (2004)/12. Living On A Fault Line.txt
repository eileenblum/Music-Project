[Japanese edition bonus track]

Too many restless nights and all the ragin' fights
No one's there who can rescue me
Oh enough of all our talkin'
Oh tryin' to keep your heart from walkin'
All these years passed by like a pain without a cry
No one's there who can help me out
Oh enough of all our talkin'
Oh let me save your heart from walkin'

I kill the mornin' damn the nightfall rubles of the past
I kill the dawning damn the risin' how will I outlast

Slowdown breakdown I can't face the day
Without your love and hate it's all too late
Slowdown turn around I can't face the night
If only I could turn back time been livin' on a fault line

Lost in a nowhere land I need your hand
We played a useless game but who's the one to blame
All these years passed by like a pain without a cry but
Still it's worth to stay still it's worth to fight
Oh enough of all our talkin'
Oh let me save your heart from walkin'

I kill the mornin' damn the nightfall rubles of the past
I kill the dawning damn the risin' how will I outlast

Slowdown breakdown I can't face the day
Without your love and hate it's all too late
Slowdown turn around I can't face the night
If only I could turn back time been livin' on a fault line

We'll keep on fightin' for those better days to come
No more restless nights alone and no more endless fights
Take my hand and turn around I can see them in a lie

Slowdown breakdown I can't face the day
Without your love and hate it's all too late
Slowdown turn around I can't face the night
If only I could turn back time been livin' on a fault line

Slowdown breakdown I can't face the day
If only I could turn back time been livin' on a fault line
