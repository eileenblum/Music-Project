[Music by Kustner/Sielck, Lyrics by Sielck]

Far beyond our boundary
a danger has emerged
far out in the black
it's getting ready to attack
cold and tearless retinas
are staring at the world
raiders from an ancient land
where life came to an end
worlds are colliding
but onwards we're riding
to get to the core
the center of all
the iron fist will make the tyrants fall

to strike them down...

mighty savior - giant made of steel
let your hammer pound
on the evil we'll reveal
robot raiders - tyranny of steel
let your hammer pound
defending our very ground

power shielded, cybernetic,
circuits driven force
unrelenting war machines
showing no remorse
forged by insanity
in ancient history
creations of hate
made to terminate
no way of hiding
so therefore we're riding
to get to the core
...
to strike them down
to smash their crown

mighty savior - giant made of steel
...
defending our ground

[lead Piesel and Piet]

titans colliding
but onwards we're riding
beyond the abyss
the center of all
the iron fist will make the tyrants fall

to strike them down
to smash them down

mighty savior - giant made of steel
...

under the banner
of freedom we're riding
worlds are colliding
beyond the abyss
