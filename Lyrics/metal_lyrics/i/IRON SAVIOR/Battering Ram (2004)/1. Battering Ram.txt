[Music and Lyrics by Sielck]

Riding on a tidal wave
of energy and sound
crashing through the barrier
the sonic bang will pound
and as the wind is blowing in
the mighty storm is setting in
rise - and lift me up to
where the thunder rolls

static in the air
charging everywhere
ready to ignite
to take a thunderride
we are hunting the eye of the storm
by a power deep within it we are drawn
taking a ride on the storm
let it push you to the limits to bang
like a battering ram

muscles all contorted
as the blood begins to boil
taken by titanic force
brought to native soil
and as the wind begins to howl
the storm is taking on control

rise - and lift you up to
where the thunder rules

with the wind in the rear
onto the stratosphere
the engine did ignite
to take a thunderride

we are hunting the eye of the storm

[solo by Piet]

rise - and lift me up to
where the thunder rolls

with the wind in the rear

we are hunting the eye of the storm

bang like a battering ram
to bang like a battering ram
unleashing the force of the storm
to bang like a battering ram
