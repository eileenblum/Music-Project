[Music and Lyrics by Sielck]

Far beyond the horizon
far beyond the setting sun
I am carving a way
through barren land
holding on to my memories
they are keeping me alive
making me strong
they're making me stand
hot, dusty canyons
I have been through
My heart is burning for ya
Oh it's bleeding for you

wings of deliverance
bring me home
wings of deliverance
carry me home

and whenever I'm closing my eyes
it is you that I have on my mind
echoes of what I had to leave behind

10.000 miles of torture
10.000 miles of pain
but nothing, nothing is keeping me from ya
I'm coming back to you again

wings of deliverance
...

held in captivity
in a cold, damp prison cell
locked up in a cage
I have been given hell
but never to be broken
I always did resist
and then I took my chances
to vanish in the mist

[solo]
[Martin - Piet - Martin - Piesel - Piet]

wings of deliverance
bring me home
wings of deliverance
carry me home
