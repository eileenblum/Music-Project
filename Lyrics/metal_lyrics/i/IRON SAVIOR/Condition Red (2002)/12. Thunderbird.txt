Cruising the stars
riding on cosmic winds
into the open
to challenge the great unknown
Excitement electrifies
willing to pay the price
to seek and explore
intergalactical miracles and more

Final frontier
how many secrets do you hide
so let the journey begin
in dignity and pride

Riding the windon a thunderbird
travelling the road
that no one has travelled before
Riding the wind on a thunderbird 
A universe so magical
miracles and mythical
Thunderbird
take us there

The quest has begun
and we are the chosen ones
chosen to be
the pioneers of humanity
Thunderbird, take us away
take us ashore
and let us stray
among the wounders
of time and space
to gain the knowledge
of all our race

Destination
unknown
The memory of all we've been leaving behind
stays on our mind

Riding the wind on a thunderbird
....
Thunderbird 
take us out

Cruising the stars
on cosmic winds
let us explore
the miracles and more
Thunderbird
take us away, show us the realm
show us the wonders
we're holding the helm

Final frontier
how many secrets do you hide
cosmic creation
we're bowing to you
in dignity and pride

Riding the wind on a thuderrbird

Riding the wind on a thunderbird
to boldly go
where no one has gone before
....
