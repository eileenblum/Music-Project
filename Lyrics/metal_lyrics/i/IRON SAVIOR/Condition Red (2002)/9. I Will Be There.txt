[Ltd. Edition bonus track]

I'm roaming free
I found my way
this is my center
I've been searching for
peace of mind
I've left behind
the days of confusion

The future is bright
I have come back
I have returned
to the kingdom of life
back to the light
defeated the night
the realm of delusion

Been drifting throught time
capture inside
this unholy body of mine
But now I am here
My senses are clear

Whenever you're calling my name
I will be there
Oh, I will be there

The quest for myself
came to an end
I have been reaching my promised land
Watching the mountains

watching the sea
for all eternity

Mislead and derranged
Lost in my sorrow
I couldn't see no tomorrow
But now I am here
my senses are clear

Whenever you're calling my name
I will be there
Oh, I will be there

The ages of madness
sin after sin
burning like fire
they're burning within

[Solo: Piet]

Been drifting throught time
capture inside
this unholy body of mine
But now I am here
My senses are clear

Whenever you're calling my name
I will be there
Oh, I will be there
...
I will be there, the savior is here for you!
