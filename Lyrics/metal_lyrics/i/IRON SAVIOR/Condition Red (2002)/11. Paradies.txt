A pale moon is rising
in silverless grey
it shines on the world
enlightining the decay
A dead eye that stares at the night
tainting the skies in unholy light
The towers of strength
the heart of it all
broke into debris
Atlantis will fall
And I wonder why
but the world will die in fire and ice
A million lifes
murdered by treason and lies
Ooh take me away

far beyond the stars
far beyond the skies
there must be a land
we're calling paradise
Far, far away
far beyond the skies

we shall be questing out
the land we're calling paradise
it's calling you, it's calling me
oh, let it shine
until the end of all time

Damned to survive
bearing the pain
to keep man alive
preserving the remains
And I wonder why
but the world will die
nothing will remain
I'm a bleeding heart
in the falling dark
I will never be the same
ooh take me away

far beyond the stars
....
until the end of all time

oh, let it shine
until the end of all time

And by the ancient gods
I'm swearing my revenge
and from beyond the grave
we shall avenge
your head will roll - you gonna bleed
for killing us - betraying us
traitor beware
we gonna get you anywhere

far beyond the stars
....
until the end of all time

take me far beyond the skies
take me away
take me far beyond the skies
take me to Paradise
