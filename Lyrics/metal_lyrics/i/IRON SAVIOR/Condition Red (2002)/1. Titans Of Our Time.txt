I hold the key to ultimate dream
the perfect construction
a perfect machine
I've designed
stronger than strong
an invincible force
I'm the creator, I am the source
I'm the mind

I shall be one
one with the world
one with the sun
Up in the skies
I'll be encountering paradies

Savior machine
creation of mine
we shall be unified, we'll be
Titans of our time
We shall observe
protect and preserve
we shall be unified, we'll be 
Titans of our time
you'll be mine

Devoted to science a seeker I am
now I will bring freedom and justice
to man
Up in the sky
I will be free
my spirit will fly
and by my hand
war shall be brought to an end

Savior machine
....

I'm leaving the body
I'm crossing the line
to be an immortal
I will be devine

Savior machine
creation of mine
we shall be unified, we'll be
Titans of our time
We shall observe
protect and preserve
we shall be unified, we'll be 
Titans of our time
you'll be mine

Forged by the fire
that's burning in my heart
Savior, my destiny
I'm ready to depart
Make me the one
and set my spirit free
make me fulfill the dream
in eternity

set me free
