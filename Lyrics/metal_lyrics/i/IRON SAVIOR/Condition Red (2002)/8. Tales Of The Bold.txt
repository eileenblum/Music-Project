Rays of the sun
painting the heavens in gold
the killing is over
the knights are heading back
from the cold
A tribute to all those courages men
standing until the end
fighting for freedom
giving their lives for the land

They fought, they killed, they died
defending our liberty
and now they have returned
in glorious victory

Tears for the damned
freedom for the land
a thousand years
they will be told
Tales of the bold
the beast died in fire
justice to the liar
a prayer for those who gave their lives
they will be memorized

They fought so hard they fought so well
saving us all from the spell
a thousand years
their deeds will be told
these are the tales of the bold

A moment in silence
a moment for the brave
for those who never made it back
for those who found their graves
Never forgotten they stay on our mind
keeping the memory alive
their final rest
may it be blessed
by the gods

Until the end of time
for all eternity
they're riding with the gods
in unity

Tears for the damned
....
these are the tales of the bold

Tales of the bold
riding with the gods
in eternity
in unity
for liberty
for victory

Tears for the damned
....
these are the tales of the bold
a thousand years
their deeds will be told
these are the tales of the bold!
