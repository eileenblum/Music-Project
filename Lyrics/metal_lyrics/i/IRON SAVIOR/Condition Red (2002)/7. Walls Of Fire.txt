You're looking battered
oh, you shure ain't looking well
we managed to survive
to escape this living hell
I must agree our situation
ain't too cool
but anyway, we'll make it back
that is the rule

burning amber, blazing heat
this ain't the time to die
so get up on your feet
we stood the firestorm
we stood the attack
I'm gonna take you home
I swear I'll bring you back

carry on
don't loose the energy
don't let it fade away
listen to me

This is a bad
bad day for dying
it's a bad
bad day for dying
we'll break through
the walls of fire

So let's get on with it
let's play their little game
They are the hunters
we are the pray
They're seeking - we're hiding
they're tracking down our trace
but in the end we gonna win
this deadly race

stay alive
don't drown in mortal fear
together we will make it
don't leave me now
I need you here

This is a bad day for dying
[repeat]
