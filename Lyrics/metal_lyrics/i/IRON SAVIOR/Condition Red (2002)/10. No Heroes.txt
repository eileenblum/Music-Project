Hear the stories - of the old
of right and wrong - of bad and good
of bravery - courageous knights
and victory
Men of honor - in brotherhood
true and loyal - sworn in blood
ancient tales - of truth and lies
and sacrifice

Keep up the spirit
let it shine inside the heart
and may their glory deeds
enlight us in the dark
We ain't the heroes
we're just true and simple men
men of honor and pride
We ain't the heroes
oh, we ain't no splendid knights
but for their sake we will ride

Their memory - throughout the ages
makes us strong - when the battle rages
sentinal - this legacy
make it perpetual

some people say
these are just the tales from days of yore
But we know better
let'em life forevermore

We ain't the heroes
....
but for their sake we will ride

We ain't the heroes
....
but for their sake we will ride

No heroes
we ain't no heroes
we're true and simple men
No heroes
we ain't no splendid knights
but for liberty we'll ride
