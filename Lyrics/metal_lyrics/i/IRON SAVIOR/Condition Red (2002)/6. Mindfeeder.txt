He used to walk among your midst
a law-obeiding scientist
It came alive in the blackest night
took him away to the dark side
He is a shadow, a creepy ghost
He crawls inside your innermost
It's been the gift that made him see
made him a god of depravity
He doesn't care about right or wrong
it is the talent that makes him strong
He is superior, he's supernatural
and now he's here to get you
And then the night is falling
sepulchral the demon is calling
he's calling on you

Under my control
I am the Mindfeeder
under my control
this is the Mindfeeder

Your spirit's chained in the deepest pit
he is the master - you're the puppet
And like a tool you'll be utilized
be abused or sacrificed
he's telepathic, ruling your will

on his command you'll die and kill
you cannot run, you cannot hide
'cause he's inside of your mind

Under the reign of terror
you will be chained forever
forevermore

Under my control
....
this is the Mindfeeder

And then the night is falling
....

Under my control
....
this is the Mindfeeder

Under my control
