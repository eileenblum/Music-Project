I came from far beyond the time
this is my manor
I'm reaching for the crown
and now it shall be mine
this is my realm
from far beyond the time

Out in the vast
I've been waiting for revenge
try to defeat me
I will break through your defense

Protector
will get inside your mind
I will enlight you
free you from the blind
Protector
will terminate the pain
I will enlight your
sick and wicked brains

I am your Protector

This is my requiem of revenge
This is my rancour
I creep inside your mind
into your very soul
I have the power
I am in control

Outcast in the void
now I'm stronger than before
landed to retake the crown
your conquerer comes ashore

Protector
....

I creep inside
your very mind
into your soul I'm in control

Protector
....

I will get inside your mind
I will free you from the blind
I will teminate the pain
enlight your wicked brains
