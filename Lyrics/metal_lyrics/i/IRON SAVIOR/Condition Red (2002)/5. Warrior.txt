In ancient times
tomorrow and today
there always be the men
who choose the battle's way
Masters of the sword
living for the fight
until the end of time
for liberty they'll ride
It's in the blood
it's in the heart
deep inside everyone of us
from the very start

Look at yourself
and feel the energy
close your eyes
and you will see
the lion who's inside of you

Warrior sworn to the blade
this is your to live
this is your fate
Warrior faithful and true
the battle roars
it's calling on you

It's not the sword
that makes a warrior true
if you think your muscles do
you don't have a clou
It's a matter of integrity
trust and loyalty
It's to know about wrong or right
that makes you a knight

You may become
one with the energy
open your eyes
and you will see
the dragon who's inside of you

Warrior sworn to the blade
....

There may be times
when fear is in your heart
there may be sadness
ripping you apart
Don't give the hatred
entrance to the soul
don't let the darkness
get in control

It's in the blood
it's in the heart
deep inside everyone of us
from the very start

You have become 
one with the energy
and now your eyes
ooh, they can see
how much there is inside of you

Warrior sworn to the blade
....

Warrior sworn to the blade
this is your to live
this is your fate

Warrior sworn to the blade!
