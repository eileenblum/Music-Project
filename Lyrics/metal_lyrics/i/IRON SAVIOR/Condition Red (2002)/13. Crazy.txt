[Ltd. Edition Bonus Track]
[originally from Seal]

A man decides after seventy years
That what he goes there for is to unlock the door
While those around him criticize and sleep 
And through a fractal on a breaking wall
I see you my friend and touch your face again
Miracles will happen as we trip ooh oh oh
But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive unless we are a little crazy
Yellow people walking through my head
One of them's got a gun to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school oh get it get it no
If all were there when we first took the pill
Then maybe then maybe then maybe then 
Miracles will happen as we speak
But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive unless we are a little crazy
In a sky full of people only some want to fly isn't that crazy
In a world full of people only some want to fly isn't that crazy
In a heaven full of people there's only some want to fly ain't that crazy
In a world full of people there's only some want to fly 
Ain't that crazy ain't that crazy
But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive unless we are a little 
But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive unless we are a little just a little crazy
And then you see things the size of which you've never known before
They'll break it someday only child know 
Them things the size of which you've never known before 
Someday someway someday someway


Thanks to heavymetalcreature for sending track #13 lyrics.
