I may be wrong
But the miracle
That I prayed for
Is here
Could be illusion
Maybe some trickery
I don't know why
I'm scoring the angels
Counting all the thousand days
There were so many tears
So many times
Wasting away
So what about the thousand days

We miss the reason
Because of what we are
I fall silent
With you
The gash I know
Is getting obvious
The blood of ages
From scoring the angels
Guaranteed for all we know
There were so many tears
So many times
Wasting away
So what about the thousand days?

I swerve the engine
The balance disappears
While I'm sleeping
I'm scoring the angels
Counting all the thousand days
There were so many tears
So many times
Wasting away
So what about the thousand days?
The thousand days
Thousand days
