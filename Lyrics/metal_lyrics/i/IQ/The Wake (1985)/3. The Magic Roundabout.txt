Stop your tears from hiding
See them mesmerise your skin
It's all that I can do
To keep away from going in
I fed the ghost of plenty
As the perfume turned to grey
If life is still worth living
How come I feel afraid?

One day, some day
I will take from the air
The only way out
I can't deny the honesty
I want to stay
But it's more than me

I'm losing all the reason
Keep forgetting what I've said
Oh I try to bring it closer
But there's nothing in my head
I don't believe in ever
And I don't believe in now
If life is still worth living
How come I feel alone?

Suddenly, if it comes then I'm gone
Why don't you talk to me
See I'm not
Your enemy? I am right by your side
I want to stay
But it's more than me

Each time you go down
Don't forget to remember
Everything is easy
Most of all believing
It will take you over
It will bring you down
It's hidden in the language
It's in the words I say
(I say so)
