Break out the waters
Waiting for anything to come
Hold on forever
Hell below and Heaven dead ahead
Don't ever change your way

Burn down the prison
Stay in the balance of the wire
Hold on forever
Only you can turn that lethal level
I'll keep you safer than sound

Even the rain won't fall in a straight line
Take it from me, you'll find that the pulses shine

I take the strain
Let go the millions of us
The whole divide
It wasn't easy, I want to stay

"You're not alone
So don't look back
You better see
It's getting black
You're not alone
Surrender now
You're going to fall in line
You better learn this time"

I'm trying to get there
I'm falling from nowhere
