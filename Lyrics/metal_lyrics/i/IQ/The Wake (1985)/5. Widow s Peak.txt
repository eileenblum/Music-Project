Garden over me, the secret I love most
God and Man agree to giving up the ghost
High above the moon, the sun has left the sky
I would love to know if you're the reason why

Garden under me, the naked and the dead
I can still remember everything we said
Higher, higher now than I have ever been
More than meets the eye than mine have ever seen

Garden over me, you never know the grief
Hide this side away to satisfy belief
I can't stand the agony of nothing new
When the soft white belly enters into you

I go down

The ribbon wrapped a gun, I blinded everyone
Collected underground, now I'm up I'm down
It isn't how you lie, it's in the way you're mine
How was I to know the nerves would overflow?

I want to see you, I want to touch you
I want to feel the breathing changing
I want to be you, to be inside you
To pull you under, get you fighting
Unsodden even the water leaking
Don't want to hear the widow speaking
And just to know if there could be something
You couldn't get that, yeah...

Ah, you fools, don't you see?
He's darker than he's going to be
State I'm in, hollow bone
Diamond hard heart of stone

Lost in love, senses flown
Diamond hard heart of stone
