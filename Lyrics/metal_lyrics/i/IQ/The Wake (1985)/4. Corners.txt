Darker than the starlight gold
Bearing down again to bury me
In the air
Suffer like a stained glass wire
When the waves are gone, your eyes and fears
I'll be there

And if we can still believe in tomorrow
Yesterday will disappear soon enough
When it seems impossible to remember
How the world could be so proud of itself

Into lives of violent ends
She hides away, relies on night
All the time
Holding out a hand to take
Still awash in seas of ivory
We steal away

And it's such a lonely ride to tomorrow
Through the corners where the light never shows
When it seems impossible to imagine
How the world could be so cold to itself

And if we can still believe in tomorrow
Yesterday will disappear soon enough
When it seems impossible to remember
How the world could be so proud of itself
