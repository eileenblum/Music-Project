Yesterday is up for auction 
Souvenirs are in demand 
In the rooms where rocking horses 
Carried us on moonlit strands 
Thunder crash and flash of lightning 
Storms of metal raining down 
Little hands that cradle ashes 
Little eyelids heavy, head run aground 

Will the cross and all its stations 
Lead you where you want to go? 
You say you want a revelation 
Well, tell me something I don't know 

Zero hour, times are changing 
Count the seconds one by one 
Found a girl whose laughter turned me round 
To face a brighter sun 

Was it just hallucination 
Sent the artist off the rails? 
Searching for communication 
In the knife when all else failed 

Zero hour, tide is turning 
Calmer waters from now on 
Found a girl whose laughter turned me round 
To face a brighter sun
