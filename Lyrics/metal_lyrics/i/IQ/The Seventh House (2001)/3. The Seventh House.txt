On a bleak and solitary road
They return
To be where once they met
One who comes to lay the past to rest
Inside
One who can't forget

Yesterday the heroes of the hour
Who survived
Those who fought and lost
Standing at the moment of release
They pause
To count the dreadful cost

My life is out of condition
I've held it together myself the best I can
I'll never feel this way again

After all this time we've been apart
Still now
I wonder where you are
No one understands how close you came
To us
No one knows how far

This time it's harder than ever
I've weathered the storm
And I've kept you safe and warm
I'll never feel this way again

Oh my angel
In black water
All your heartache
Will soon be over

Oh my baby
Rest you well

Cathedral that man created
You're weighted down by a jealous sound
Bewildered and dislocated
Your soul deflated and gone to ground

Nobody, no final direction
No way to connect in this heavier state
The lives that we never remember
Are heading us out to another mistake

It's with me, it's waiting for me
As Heaven is calling us to our knees
And there in the seventh house
Lie the seventy-five figures such as these

I'm all out of random
Sentenced by madmen
Who have abandoned me
What chance of survival?
I've had an eyeful
More than I cared to see

And if I forget you
Or if I let you
Fall under someone's spell
Nobody can blame you
Put out the flame
You kept it alive so well

What web are we weaving
Nothing achieving?
Are you receiving me?
So far out in the ocean
Stuck in emotion
On an unending sea

And if you forget me
Don't ever let me
Under your broken wing
Nobody can know
You kept it below you
I never felt a thing
What a way to go

How did all the dreaming in my life
Arrive at such a bitter end?
On the rooftops draped in black
Denial stopped me in my tracks
By the fearful light of dusk
This position I defend
All around the sky is cracked
Won't somebody send me back?

Fourteen hundred hours
Won't forget that day
Coal-black sky, the earth
A hundred shades of grey
In the aftermath
As silent as the grave
I alone remained
No other soul was saved

Faces turning over
Limbs that shake without
A conscious kind of movement now
For all their tomorrows
We gave our last day today

In a future all their own
Documents reveal patriotic zeal
Singing to remember
Drinking to forget the lie
All the names beyond recall
Empty politics in houses one to six
Locked and barred against the memory

My life is out of condition
I've held it together myself the best I can
I'll never feel this way again
Again

These are the lives we are measured by
Heaven help us to answer why
Every minute of every day they die
Waiting and wondering all alone
Silent voices across the land
Speak in tongues they could never understand
Nameless and wandering far from home
Always held in the seventh house
Everything we inherit now's the same
