Came from the west
Only to fly again
The eyes that see
The lips that tell no tales
Nobody's guest
Dressed like a mannequin
Put out to sea
Before the ship had sails

I have always dreamed that somewhere in your heart
There's a guiding light still shines
For our lives and times we should have spent together
But we passed each other by
Like seasons out of time

Easter you left
Changed more than anyone
I asked you why
You told me "Just because"
Nobody guessed
Under your influence
The man I am
Is not the man I was

We have lived our lives across this great divide
I couldn't make you change your mind
And we almost glimpsed a promise of forever
But we passed along the way
Like seasons out of time

Sometimes everything is hard to bear
Let go, following without a care
Still now, though it's hard to understand
We built on shifting sand

Somehow memories are more than this
Set free only with a deathly kiss
And now, when the restless hour is high
A million stars go by

We never can remember
All the lives we've lived before
The days decline in number
Slip the ropes away from shore
Whenever Heaven calls us
There's regret and compromise
And in another distance
Lies a past unrealised

Where are you now?
Who are you now?
Is anyone really gone?

In all the world
In all this space
The race is run

I have always dreamed that somewhere in your heart
There's a guiding light still shines
For our lives and times we should have spent together
But we passed each other by
Like seasons out of time
