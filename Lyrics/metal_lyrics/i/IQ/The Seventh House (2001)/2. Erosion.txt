Where do I start? 
This thing's tearing us apart
Nothing is clear
Where do we go from here?
No wonder in sight
Not even the blackest night
So where do I start?
It only remains to empty this heart
Everything that I came to trust slipped away
I resisted the call to arms, feet of clay

Now when I sleep,
I reach for the book I keep
In my hour of need
I turn to the pages no-one will read
Everything that I came to trust slipped away
I live through this a thousand times every day

All the time that I'm held in suspension
And unable to make myself heard
I can't hold back the tide of erosion
And the vision that haunts me is blurred

Been as cold as I can
Since who knows when
Would that I could feel now
As I did then
Get in out of the light
Avoid the glare
Lost and out on a limb
Miles from anywhere

All the time that I'm held in suspension
And unable to make myself heard
I can't hold back the tide of erosion
And the vision that haunts me is blurred

Everything that I came to trust slipped away
I resisted the call to arms, feet of clay
Everything that I came to trust slipped away
