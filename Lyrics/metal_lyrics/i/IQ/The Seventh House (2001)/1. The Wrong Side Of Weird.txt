A sudden unpredictable sky contains the dawn
Seconds in an hour
Counting down before the day is born
Long enough in the grave to be sustained
Science or belief
Reminders of a time we can't regain

Have all the idle dreamers awoken from their dreams
To find they're not alone?
Nothing now is really as it seems
This would always arrive somehow
Problem left unsolved
Radiating in the here and now

And in my memory
Only just begun to understand the reasons why
A one in ten degree
Alternate between the faithful and the fearless

If all the riches and ransoms coalesced
As one were intertwined
You would be the brightest I possess
If all the gold and the silver came combined
You would still define
The colours I imagine in my mind

And in my memory
Under the same moon, lighted on a lunar sea
A one in ten degree
Alternate between the faithful and the fearless

I can't remember
Can't even be him
And chances are slim
That I'm found
No finer substance
No final demand
I'm tired and know
No bounds

Thought that I was pulling through
Though I never had a chance of winning at all
Caught between the heard and the seen
Something out of quarantine beginning to call

In silence I'm drowning
I'm spinning around and round

Oblivion lies unrevealed
More than flesh and bone can bear together to feel
In silence I'm sinking
I don't think I'll make it down

Riding the meltdown, right in the fallout
And I turn to the fire when I'm spurned
Send out the thing that is driving me crazy
I can douse it and leave it to burn

Daylight dissolving, crawling miasma
On a spellbound and desolate prayer
Somebody somewhere stop me before
I rip away all the soul they've repaired

Time already grows heavy, gravity won't hold steady
Pole people cry for their lives passing by darkly
This belongs to you for he would have loved you as I do
Life as we feared on the wrong side of weird
binds us two

And in my memory
Only just begun to understand the reasons why
A one in ten degree
Alternate between the faithful and the fearless
Where are you now? Who are you now?
I can't go there

Thought that I was pulling through
Though I never had a chance of winning at all
Caught between the heard and the seen
Something out of quarantine beginning to call
Riding the meltdown, right in the fallout
And I turn to the fire when I'm spurned
Send out the thing that is driving me crazy
I can douse it and leave it to burn
Once every lifetime shadows are lifted
And the daylight disperses the dark
Want to be sure that all I've endured is put away
But where do I start?
