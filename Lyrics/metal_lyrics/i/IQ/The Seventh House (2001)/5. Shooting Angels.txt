Something's up on the northern skyline
Angels descending from their gallery on high
Rally around me slowly
Angels with dirty faces
Leaving their lipstick trace across the human race
Heavenly host unholy

Walking the wire, I jump the gun
Some of us fly too close to the sun
Gone are the days when Heaven could wait
Thought there was time but now it's too late
So when you hear the angels sing
Get ready to spread your wings

How the hell am I going to do this?
Heavenly bodies multiplying through the mist
Steadily swell their numbers
Under celestial orders
Ascending the clouds right up into the stratosphere
Marching us down to Slumbertown

Walking the wire, I'm taking aim
Keeping my tail ahead of the game
Gone are the days of Heaven's Lament
Satellite plays the whole event
So when you want to take them higher
Get ready to open fire

In Arcadia
All they've made of light is shade
A halcyon retreat, now frayed
Stay together
In a Hell-for-leather world
Torn apart by angels and their battlecries

Walking the wire, I jump the gun
Some of us fly too close to the sun
Gone are the days when Heaven could wait
Thought there was time but now it's too late
So when you hear the angels sing
Get ready to spread their wings
