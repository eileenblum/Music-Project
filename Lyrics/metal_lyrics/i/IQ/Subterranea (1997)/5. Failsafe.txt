"Do you seek enlightenment
Are you to frightened to speak?
Short of experience
Here where the flesh is so weak?
Trust in these hands
Let them attend to you
We understand
We all intend for you
To stand among friends"

"Are you remembering
Do I revive your neglect
My one?
A price must be paid for your sin
And I'm here to collect
All that you are
Is all that you'll ever be
Unless on your hands and knees
You put all your faith in me"

Leave me alone
I don't belong here
I'm not your candidate
Guaranteed failsafe
I'm on my own

I don't know
I don't know

Bible-bashing fashion victim
Should have kicked him when he couldn't
Get arrested; uncontested
Will to carry on is gone
Inside his head, he's dead, he said
"I never was alive--I died with
Knives and nails and nightingales
This is all the anger I can hold"

Kennedy, remember me, I
Cannot bury you until I
Stare into the mouth of hell
Time alone will tell me how to
Spend the time alone without you
Listen to the songs about you
Run for cover, gunners unrevealed
Will aim to please another son

I can't go on
Help me make
That Golden Dawn, because
For all we know
We're done and dusted
Must it end like this
Here and now
Here and now?

I don't belong here
There's nothing now my eyes can recognize
I'm all wrong here
Let me go, I'm not for changing
I don't belong here
I'm not your victim and I don't believe
I'm not strong here
No religion, nothing more
I'm telling you know
I'm not your candidate
Guaranteed failsafe
I'm caught in a headrush
And I'm out of control
