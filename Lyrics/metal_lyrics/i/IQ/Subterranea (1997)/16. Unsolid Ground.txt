All my life I'm governed and controlled
At someone's beck and call
Made to walk a balanced line
Before I've even crawled

All the time I hungered for release
On independence day
Without a contact or a name
I waited anyway

Torn apart and written in the starts
More I cannot see
Blind enough to follow through
Unsupervised devotion

Forever I was losing sight, sound escaping
And all the world was tuning upside down
For every move I tried to make when I was stranded
At least I'm standing on unsolid ground

All my live I'm governed and controlled
At someone's beck and call
Maybe there's no genius
In having lived at all

All my life I'm taken by surprise
I'm someone's waste of time
Now I walk a balanced line
And step into tomorrow

Forever I was losing sight, sound escaping
And all the world was tuning upside down
For every move I tried to make when I was stranded
At least I'm standing on unsolid ground
