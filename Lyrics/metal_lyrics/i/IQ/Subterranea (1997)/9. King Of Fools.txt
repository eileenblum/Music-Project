King of fools, you'll never bring him back
He's got them where they want him
Hanging high, is this the way it endsÂ ?
On bended knee, not with a bang
But with a fatal kiss, I won't twist again
For you can bend me, shape me
Won't escape me
Now I've got the reason for the rhyme

Skintight stupid substitute
You don't come close, no sense pretending
Dr Suess's golden goose is
Too seductive, too demanding
Idle handsome fascist with his
Love-me-love-my-velvet-fist attention
never meant to leave me
Now I'm unintentionally fine
