Are you inside, provider, or am I?
Immersed in all the darkness and decay
Denied the sleep to dream myself away
Said I was bright, too sensitive to fly

Can't tell you why you don't already know
He reins the horse for those I cannot see
Will I like him a gallant rider be?
The skin is pale, the sunken eyes are slow
