Hard on my heels I feel him
from dusk till dawn he stands
Astride the elevation, avoiding confrontation
In this infernal chorus
He follows where I lead him under the ground
Who watches he who watchesÂ ?
Non-one above suspicion

I want an explanation, one final word of wisdom
"Said you were bright-eyed wonder
Set you up right, you're finally where you belong"

I am your murdering Angel of Death
I will despise you until your last breath
When I cut into you, will you not bleedÂ ?
Decidedly you will provide what I need
Give me a focus now, give me a name
Who is responsible, who do I blameÂ ?
Back to your maker, return to his side
Unressurected, unrecognized
Mockenrue...
