Wakes up forgotten, makes up his mind
Sets out to question if he's one of a kind
On and on, want to feel somehow
Somewhere in time
You'll see it all the way that I do now

Gives in to impulse, reaches in between
Gets back a notion, still remembers a dream
Gone again and I don't know how
Some other time
You're going to look like I do now

Sprawls across the walkways, recalls another place
Finds the faces hidden, no names upon a stone
Raises up a fever, he rails against the skies
Careless what he wishes for
And what he's always known
On and on, want to feel somehow
Somewhere in time
You'll see it all the way that I do now

In and out of daylight, hung on for dearest life
Stumbles on misguided, is rousing from a sleep
On the street civilians display a common band
Roaring like a cry from Heaven seven thunders deep
Gone again and I don't know how
Some other time
You're going to look like I do now

So many held in firm array, each one anonymously files
In every kind of every way and every mother's only child
And all the time identified, it's hard to take it in at all
There must be many more besides
Those to watch us while we're sleeping

So many here, so many held
Aligned and catalogues for good
And punching in and punching out
The empty voices keep repeating
"I don't live on the outside
I'm provided for in here now
Love us where we stand, lead us through this land
We all know the score, that's what living's for"
