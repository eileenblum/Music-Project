Don't want to lead a revolution
Let another go ahead
Don't have no need for elocution
No desire to raise the dead
You can't avoid the circulation
Amend the circumstance
Don't want to lose the combination
Still want to hold it in my hands

Can't see around this tunnel vision
From inside of what I've found
When I was wracked with indecision
When my hide was hunted down
Under a moon of innovation
A many-splendoured thing
I need the company I'm keeping
And I feel the hunger

Something happened inside and I can't explain it
I'm in a critical way
When I didn't believe it I couldn't see
Now I live a life in a day

All at once she is gone again when I turn back
Cracking up, more than I can take
Make it come right

And I'm dead on my feet, hesitating and down
In a dangerous mood where I shouldn't remain
Straighter than an arrow never-ending emotional ride
(Raining from the harder sky)
Waiting for survival, are there no words left to right?
Don't want them anymore

And now something I couldn't hide has happened inside
And taken the meaning away
When I didn't give in I couldn't begin
Now I live a life in a day
Something happened inside and I can't explain it
I'm in a critical way
When I didn't believe it I couldn't see
Now I live a primitive life in a day
