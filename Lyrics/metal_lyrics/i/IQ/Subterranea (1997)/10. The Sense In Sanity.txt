Ignited by the realizing eyes
Unwrapped around the solitary sound
A failing voice is railing under walls
Collapsing on the unfamiliar ground
O, empty heart, am I the only oneÂ ?
On pins alone or are we many bornÂ ?
Well, either way, you are what you've begun
And by the way, I never did you wrong

Nothing here is guaranteed, nothing's understood
Now that I am far beyond beginning to belong
Maybe I don't understand the sequence as I should
Can't tell left from right from wrong
God from bad from good

For all you know, for all you made of me
It's hard to keep the skin from tender bone
No earthly ties to hang me from on high
I wait beneath your overcrowded skies

Nothing here makes any grade
There's nothing I can do
Fed and watered though I was barely half alive
Time enough to tire me out but now I'm sleeping
I've lost the sense in sanity
Got the bad in good
