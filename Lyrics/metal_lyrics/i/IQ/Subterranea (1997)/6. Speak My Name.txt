Whenever I was silenced
Ahen I was on my own
A brutal cold existence
I believed I was gone
Now I stand, no longer nameless
Though I've lost more than I'll find
A simple moment set aside
And I feel like I'm mine

There are times when I remember
But in my heart I'm not the same
And I feel myself connected
Every time you speak my name
You speak my name

Without the darkness in my soul
With arms to call my own
I face a future unafraid
And I won't be alone

There's a place where all my dreaming
Will free me from what I became
And I know no-one can reach me
Every time you speak my name
You speak my name

There are times when I remember
But in my heart I'm not the same
And I feel myself protected
Every time you speak my name
You speak my name
