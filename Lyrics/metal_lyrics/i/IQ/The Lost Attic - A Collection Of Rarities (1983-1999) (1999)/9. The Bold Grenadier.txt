As I was a walking one morning in May
I spied a young couple a makin' of hay.
O one was a fair maid and her beauty showed clear
and the other was a soldier, a bold grenadier.

Good morning, good morning, good morning said he
O where are you going my pretty lady?
I'm a going a walking by the clear crystal stream
to see cool water glide and hear nightingales sing.

O soldier, o soldier, will you marry me?
O no, my sweet lady that never can be.
For I've got a wife at home in my own country,
Two wives and the army's too many for me.
