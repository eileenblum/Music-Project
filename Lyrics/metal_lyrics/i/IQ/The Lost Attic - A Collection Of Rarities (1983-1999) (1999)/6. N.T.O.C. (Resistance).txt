[Cook-Holmes-Jowitt-Nicholls-Orford]

It's over, I'm older, the fire is burning cold
And I will any day now release this heart and soul
There is no reason now nor rhyme
Within the heavy head of mine

Unbroken emotion, this is the hurting time
I hang on every word
There's nothing wrong but it's not right
It feels like I will always stay
If only moving over now
The eyeless and unhearing retreat into their circles
When everything is shifting, I'm breaking direction

Imagine, remember the rattle of the day
Be here and let it not be that I feel you slip away
There is no reason now nor rhyme
Within the heavy head of mine

The silence I've been hearing
Enough to steal my thunder
Illusions I've been under are breaking direction

Far from nowhere, somehow here
I know that blue heart's in those skies
And no resistance, no more pain now
I have seen the fading in your eyes

It feels like I will always stay
If only moving over now
The eyeless and unhearing retreat into their circles
When everything is shifting, I'm breaking direction
The silence I've been hearing
Enough to steal my thunder
Illusions I've been under are breaking direction
