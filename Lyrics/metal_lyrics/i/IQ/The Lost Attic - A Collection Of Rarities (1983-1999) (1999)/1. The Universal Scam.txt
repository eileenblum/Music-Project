[Cook-Holmes-Jowitt-Nicholls-Orford]

Either talk or listen
Don't entertain nobody else
Now that the lines are positive
Someone save me from myself

Unthinkable, unbelievable
There's no way out

Unconvincing hypocrites
Are you putting sense aside?
All you sarcastic sycophants
You pussyfoot in, santified

As he's cornering individuals
He contrives a role reversal
A universal scam saved in ignorance
Surely taking you down
I must confess I feel second blessed

A voice I can't forget reverberates inside my head:
"You're all you'll ever be
Your soul is stained, give in to me
By these almighty hands
The purifying flames are fanned
The hours left to us fade so fast
The first shall be the last to know"

Unthinkable, unbelievable
