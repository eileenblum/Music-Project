[Nicholls-Orford-Holmes]

Once I was down, nowhere to climb
What lay ahead unclearly defined
I could have done more than I did
I was so young, easily led
When I was a boy out of time

Give me a place where I can hide
None can erase one who has died
I want to belong, I long to believe
Words that were sent, never received
With eyes of the blind, we collide
