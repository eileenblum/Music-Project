[Orford-Nicholls]

One mistake and all the hopes are dashed
Before the chance is given
I want to hide in driven snow
Until the chill is deep inside me
On this hollow afternoon
It can't be long if I'm immune
To falling without the warmth of surrender

Feel the memories fade away
And I'm here where I was yesterday
And I need to search my mind
But I'm scared of things that I might find

A fear too strong to tame
One day is much the same as another
Lonely dreams I've smothered in silence
I'm positive they've been before
Winding down, I'm finding different ways
To keep what's still ahead
Behind me where they come back together

Feel the memories fade away
And I'm here where I was yesterday
And I can't escape the sensation
That it's bound to end this way

Feel the memories fade away
And I'm here where I was yesterday
And I need to search my mind
But I'm scared of things that I might find
