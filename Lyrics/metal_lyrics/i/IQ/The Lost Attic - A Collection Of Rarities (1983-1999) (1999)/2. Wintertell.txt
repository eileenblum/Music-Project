[Nicholls-Holmes]

The eyes that watch her weeping
As she turns to leave
Surrender to another tear
Uncertain of this new decision we have made
Too empty, though, to say for sure
And she and I no longer know the reason
It's all I can do to bury my fear
I wanted so much to always be here

Wherever she goes, whatever she does
How can I let go?
When all that I know, in all that I see
I know in my heart reminders will come

Both out of words and out of hope
Another day exactly like I've come to know
So nervously I close my eyes
In hoping, when I open them, that she'll be gone
For well she knows I can't give in to sorrow
I wait for a chance to be letting her know
I love her enough to be letting her go

I know it's everything we said
But I must not trust
It's too late, too late to trust
And I must not trust
It's too late, too late to trust
