[Mann, additional material Holmes]

Apathetic and here, I...
Watch myself glide from the sky, losing height
And end up as something gone bump in the light
Which doesn't desire to be dragged from the night
But change is the heartbeat of life into life
Which, trembling, approaches the knife

Redemption is costly, there's blood on the land
And all of us till it, it sticks to our hands
It seems to be bound up in our very glands
It sucks all our wagon wheels into its slush
And falsifies our every blush

The heart's a thermometer, readings are odd
We're from lukewarmer regions where Cain gives the nod
And we tread upon roads where our fathers have trod
We are mapless and hapless and blown by the breeze
And we chatter of being at ease
Dreary me, we chatter of being at ease
