Is it me that you're speaking to?
Can you really put me down?
Do you know the things to say?
What will happen in the meantime?

Are you telling me the truth?
Can you really put me down?
Would you bother if you could?
What will happen if you do?

What will happen to my friends?
Will they be the same as you?
Can you tell me if I'm wrong?
When will I be right again?
