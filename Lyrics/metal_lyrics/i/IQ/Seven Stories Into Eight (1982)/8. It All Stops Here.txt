I can feel the movement
Growing all around me everywhere
I can hear the language of the revolution every day

If you pledge to join me
We can fight for reason everywhere
All the things we wished for
Are ours for the asking anyway

Many years ago we lived here
All too soon our hopes were drowned
Now as if I never knew you
Life goes on in different towns
and I can walk round you, past you, through you
Because you're only ghosts now
Yes, I can walk round you, past you, through you
Because you're only ghosts now

Somehow in this silent city
A little of us still remains
Mingled with the distant laughter
Fused with dust in future rains
And I can walk round you, past you, through you
Because you're only ghosts now
Yes, I can walk round you, past you, through you
Because you're only ghosts now
