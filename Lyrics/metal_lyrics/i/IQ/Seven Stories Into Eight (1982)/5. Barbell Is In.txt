One of these days you'll find
So much rhythm in your head
Can serve to clean your mind
and the voices you can hear
Can't relate to what you see
and the monotone inflection
Infiltrates internally

Barbell is in, Barbell is in
Barbell is in, Barbell is in

One of these days you'll find
So much rhythm in your head
Can serve to clean your mind
and the voices you can hear
Can't relate to what you see
and the monotone inflection
Infiltrates internally

Barbell is in, Barbell is in
Barbell is in, Barbell is in
