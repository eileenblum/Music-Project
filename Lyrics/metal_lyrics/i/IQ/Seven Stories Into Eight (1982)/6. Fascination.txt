I was waiting for the change
To come from underneath the ground
Caught in half-light, there she stood
But I had given all I could
Upside down the shape looked normal
In its magic uniform
I can't remember getting older
I can't get it off my mind            

It's only fascination diving
Keeps my spirits half-alive
My infatuation driving my incentive to survive            

Does it suffocate the daughters
Or does torture sink a thrill?
Still obsessed with time will time
It's now and never, watch it swell            

It's only fascination diving
Keeps my spirits half-alive
My infatuation driving my incentive to survive            

It may be far away but it's here to stay
New reminders sway into yesterday
She walks towards me now
She lives, I don't know how
I can hardly move, I can hardly breathe            

Roses, I am chrome
No, she's not at home
Shot down to the bone
Sitting here alone
She walks towards me now
She lives, I don't know how
I can hardly move
I can hardly believe in even nothing
I hide you in bullets, I had it all
Still dragged from shock to shock
One drink to let me sink
If I never see you again
If I'm jaded, stretched or cleaned
Don't tell me, I guessed
While you bled for me less
I love what you used to be
