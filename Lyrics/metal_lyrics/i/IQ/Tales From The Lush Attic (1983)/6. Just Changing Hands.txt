[Bonus Track]She blacks and blues
She wear new bruise
'Cause he beat her senseless
He hit the booze

Whenever she's
Prey to his disease
As she take some beating
Fall to her knees

It's only love, he told me so
He's coming home to my bed
I wouldn't bleed if only he'd
leave me along now and then

When did it start?
I can't recollect
I'm still alive,
if a little wrecked

He makes it so i'm
so old before my time
He comes from behind
it helps him to unwind

It's all right, love, he told me so
He's promised me no more pain
I wouldn't bleed if only he'd
leave me alone now and then
