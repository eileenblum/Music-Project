When the feeling takes me over, what else can I do but run?
Through the corridors I follow, I shoot into oblivion;
If you close your eyes and listen, you can hear the children play,
I love it when their eyes are watching, I'll have it when they disobey.

It's a different kind of loving, such a dirty rigmarole,
But just in case there's no tomorrow, I'll dring fire from their souls;
If you close your eyes and listen, you can hear the children shout,
I hate it but I win't be happy till I've turned them inside out.

All day long, here I go!
All day long, all day!
