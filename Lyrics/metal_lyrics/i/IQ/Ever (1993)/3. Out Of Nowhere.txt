Out of a time from way back when
Disregarding discipline
Should have never given in
And I really should have known

Some are born into their lives
With a need to be destroyed
It's the wrong thing on my mind
The only thing we can't survive

Standing in the line of fire
Innocently dumb
They're in my head and still they come
Out of nowhere

Is there something
Something more than this?
Inner tension
Settled with a kiss

What a time to bump and grind
What a daydream, looking back
Never a worry in the world
For the cutter in the pack

I don't understand this pain
And I never will
The scene is gone and here they are
Out of nowhere

Is there something
Something that I've missed?
It's going to happen
And I can't resist

If I believed a single word
I would hesitate as well
Making Heaven out of Hell--
All it takes is everything
I want to raise you up and see
There's something in your eyes
But every time I try, they come
Out of nowhere

Is there something
Something more than this?
Inner tension
Settled with a kiss
Is there something
Something that I've missed?
It's going to happen
And I can't resist
