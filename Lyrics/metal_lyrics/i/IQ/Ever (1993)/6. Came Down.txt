All the memories that lead to isolation
All the time we didn't share
When we set adrift half-forgotten lies
Will the madness still be there?

Who of all you now will ride the lows and highs?
Whose hands are these that come to pray?
When you turn away, the distance in your eyes
Speaks the words that you won't say

Far away, we say goodbye
Too many unremembered arms that won't let go
How can I be on your side
If the line divides
And if anyone should listen?
Though starry-eyed, I know
This is still the garden where I came down

Holding faster than before, for what it's worth now
Those days that none will see replaced
What became of us, mysterious and ageless?
We left without a trace

Far away, we wave goodbye
Too many unremembered arms that won't let go
How can I be on your side
If the line divides
And if anyone should listen?
Though starry-eyed, I know
This is still the garden where I came down
