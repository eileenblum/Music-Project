[I. After All]

Following everything I've known
I was wandering all alone
Waiting for a time that might have been
My own way down

Suddenly everything is wrong
Have I really been gone so long?
Hanging by the nails across my
Idle eyes so wide

And after all the days of fading senses
This has taken more
Than I had to give
If we face the one we've been avoiding
And I'm out of all control again
Let me go

Gathering comforting remains
I was unprepared, running scared
Faltering, and why do I hold on?
It's gone, I know

And after all the days of fading senses
I don't feel the same
And I want to live
The insecurity of never knowing
Has the race been run, and is
The long day done?
