Time takes my time
I, here to myself, hold the silence in
Torn from my hand
So heavy now you're a world away
Though they rage
These little lies
I've grown so cold
And will I see you
When I turn around?

Here I'll remain
Bound, ever bound, I am left to drown
In this space
I raise myself
And move somehow
To rearrange the brittle bones of you

Now it's done
And I resolve to make no sound
So they're come
Are they the ones
Who'll take me down?
Don't you cry precious tears for me

Passion killers and stocking fillers abound
When someone takes a dive
Surface breakers and undertakers surround
All but the fairest faces alive

Tension seekers and public speakers defend
These they have come to judge
Seasoned liars and false messiahs descend
To lay on the feeling touch

And I've seen too much
Day by day and I don't know why
After all, don't we matter the same?

Reach for the sky, don't break my heart
Are there no angels, only us?
Look how they've changed me, see what they've done
It has begun

Now as I lay me down to sleep
If I should die before I wake
Don't let me fail
Don't ever break

Roll me out where I am
Let me in 'cause I've seen too much
Day by day and I don't know why
After all
Maybe no-one's to blame

And it's not the same
I get this feeling from no-one else
Show me now
Are you out of my head?

Breaking the borders, the chaos of lies
Caught in the terrible rain from the skies
Shaken as I am, her faith is as thin
She can remember the moment of madness so well
How many died right where they fell?

I was the first in that sinister bed
Closing the shutters and cutting the thread
Shackled and fettered, I know who you are
Bleeding the heart and the mind as the rivers run red
Somebody said, "Here is Hell"

Go wherever you can be
And live for the day
It's only wear and tear
Doesn't matter anymore
If I'm losing you
You're always everywhere

It's no wonder I'm afraid
Of making amends
And shattering the fear
Now it's happening I know
It's going to come
So dark inside of here

What have they done?
Stay with me
Can you say where you are?
I'll be there, I'll do it,
Just tell me I'll never let go
Never let go
