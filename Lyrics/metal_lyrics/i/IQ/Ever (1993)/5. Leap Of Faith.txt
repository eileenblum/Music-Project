Though you may be now
A long way from home
All your hand-me-downs
Live on in their dreams

I can see something in that smile
In the way they play
They're passing down the line
Opening the tears and the emptiness
No danger signs
Features unrecognised
Until now

So soon winter brings
The first fall of snow
There are secret things
In all the whitest worlds

I can see something in that smile
In the way they play
They're passing down the line
Opening the tears and the emptiness
No danger signs
Features unrecognised
Until now

Time enough when old sensations
Won't remind anymore
Unaware of all the children
Running rings without a care
Joining in their games
When I hear pale horses riding
See them fly as they go
Then I know to free the reins
Of unquiet thoughts
