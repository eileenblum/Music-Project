Through the stinging of the system
Wandering lonely as a cloud
Talking only in the open
Congregation is even now disallowed
Growing anger in the city
Banner headlines around the world
What has to be done is called reformation
To heal the rift of living apart together
Forgive them, they know not what they do
There's no love lost at all
Save them they rue the day when
They ever got involved
Even so I have a dream
Turning circles in my head
That they're closing down all the no-go areas
Opening one for them both instead
Forgive them, they know not what they do
There's no love lost at all
Save them God are you waiting open-armed?
All of the problems over the years
I'm sure can be sorted with peaceful solutions
My warm shoulder dries your tears
I want no more heartache
Oh for crying out loud
No point asking if you're leaving
Didn't I make that clear
If we agree to differ
The closer, I'm certain, we'll always feel
Forgive them they know not what they do
There's no love lost at all
Save them they rue the day when
They ever got involved
