Sooner or later
Ready or not
We find ourselves dissolved in soil
The big sleep state
I don't worry
When you got to go you got to go
But wouldn't it be nice to have a say
In our final day
When I take my dying breath
You'd better bet your life I'm going out
Screaming
Like I came in
Screaming
Love and emotion
We're told will keep us sheltered
From the threat of the bear
But danger is everywhere
So take my hand now
As they adopt their fighting stance
Parade our derision
And assume the position, configuration
When I take my dying breath
You'd better bet your life I'm going out
Screaming
Like I came in
Screaming
I want to be the first to go, to test the water
I miss those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer
In our younger phase
All the things I took for granted but most of all
You
When I take my dying breath
You'd better bet your life I'm going out
Screaming
Like I came in now
Screaming
