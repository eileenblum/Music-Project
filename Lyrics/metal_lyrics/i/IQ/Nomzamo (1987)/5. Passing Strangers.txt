I wish I had a penny
For every time I told her I loved her
But that sincerity I know won't raise the fare
She was born with a wanderlust
And against the odds she made the grade
Now out of sight is out of mind to her
I'm scared...
It's a big bad big bad dead end world
If I close my eyes I can't forget you, stranger
In my sleep I see you dancing into danger
Mister don't shoot her
You can't see the whites for the reds of her eyes
Maybe she's been crying over me
While you're lying over her
Talk of us is words in perfect tenses
It seems that action men have broke down your defences
We're passing strangers
But your leaving left me wondering why
These times have changed us
Caught in the middle of a big bad dead end world
Caught in the middle of a big bad dead end world
Friends rally round but it's not just a question of sympathy
Others come and go why won't you come and go with me?
We're passing strangers
But your leaving left me wondering why
These times have changed us
Caught in the middle of a big bad dead end world
Caught in the middle of a big bad dead end world
