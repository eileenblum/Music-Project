Weird scenes are coming through the airwaves
From a flickering tube
An old film with an older theme
And those actors could be us
But the ending is good so I'm thinking
"There's the rub"

Later when we meet
It's emotion going through the motions
A kick to break up or a kiss to make up
But then there'll be another scene
Like the one yesterday

When we say hello, we mean goodbye
Feigning paradise, wanting to cry
Love, all our passion I'm sorry to say
Is part of the game we play

So we're into action on cue
And go spinning like a reel
Summing up this relationship
And the way I feel

I think maybe we should go on out
Into the moonlight, out of the spotlight
And examine where we are and where we've been to
Where we're going is down without a happy ending

When we say hello we mean goodbye
Feigning paradise, wanting to cry
Love, all our passion I'm sorry to say
Is part of the game we play
