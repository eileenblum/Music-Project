Free as the wind
Tall as a tree
Wide as a mind
Deep as a sea
You crawled on my land
Now I grow in your hand
Always like the first time
Unlike the others
They're so-so
So called lovers
Theirs is the push that comes to shove
But not in our evolution
It's natural
From great to grand
True love is never really planned
And wipes the memory of those who came
Before our evolution
It's natural
And with you see me walk on air
I know that I can do it
When you're holding tightly to my sleeve
The one with my heart upon it
Hard as a mountain range
Bright as a harvest moon
The set gets rearranged
But there's still time to join our show
Every dog must have its day
Everyone's a winner
And every time the lights go down on us
I'm the bginner (sic)
How lady luck has changed
"So long Salem"
The set gets rearranged
But there's still time to join the show
Free as the wind
Tall as a tree
Wide as a mind
Deep as a sea
An interlude
With haunting melodies of nursery rhymes
Singing the changes, singing the changes, singing...
I hear talk of classroom drama
Maybe it's a kind of psychodrama
Children, the mirrors of our yesterdays
On the land out of the sea
Blowing in the breeze
Mind over metaphor
Fall in love with innocence
Don't dally long with diligence
Stand up choose me
Don't refuse me
They pawned our world of peace
A flock of sheep to fleece
Our flood of love won't cease
No harm can come our way
And it's easy to see what sets us apart
From the creatures still on the ocean bed
Our evolution it's natural
It goes from great to grand
Falls into place like something that we planned
When you curl your arms around my frame
Or curl your lips around my name
And do just what comes natural
The first thing on your mind
Do just what comes natural
I prefer your kind of human nature
