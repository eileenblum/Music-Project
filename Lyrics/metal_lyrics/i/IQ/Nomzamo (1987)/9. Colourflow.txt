With all the tears and rain
In every pleasure and every pain
and despair, delight, disdain
I hurt you, didn't i?
The summer was almost gone
I won't forget the first time
Swimming in pools of your innocence
Leave your mark and the colourflow of you

Hey don't you feel sensation?
Hey don't you feel the yearn?
Just lying there for the taking
Don't give, make me earn all your love
Promise me all your soul
Give to me all your heart
You'll never be on your own
For all your life

You know you made me shine
Through orange lights and wet streets
But that's outside our undercover
You concerned me when you showed me

The colourflow of you

Hey don't you feel emotion?
Hey don't you feel spellbound?
Just lying there for the taking
What you lost I found all your love
Promise me all your soul
Give to me all your heart
You'll never be on your own
For all your life

Some people make it look so easy
Some you think they'd never heard of compromise
But we can speak oceans by motions
We simplify all your love
Promise me all your soul
Give to me all your heart
You'll never be on your own
For all your life

The colourflow of, colourflow of, colourflow of you
