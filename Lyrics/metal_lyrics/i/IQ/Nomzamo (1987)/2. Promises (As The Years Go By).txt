(Don't make any false promises)

Stay awhile, when I'm not alone
I forget all the anger in me
Kiss a tear when the hammer falls
They're holding me here in never ending circles
I can still remember summer madness
I can taste the perfume on your cheek
The heat is overcome by coldness, How
Consoling words are insignificant
Say you'll pray

Justify the actions
These are days of the mob-rule, sharp tongue, curfew
When the mind is in solitary confinement
Makes the mood that breaks you
There's a spirit seeking liberation
Here's a fire with a hungry heart
If I listen maybe, time will tell me
The reasons why we're torn apart

Uh, Uh, Uh, As the years go by
Don't make any false promises
As the years go by
Say you'll pray

Here the silence is too loud
In a steel barred jail on the other side
We invented the differences
That weaved the web with which we lied
Caught in the middle of a cold war zone
I left my lover in a far-off place
She'll kiss a tear when the hammer's falling
And wipe the darkness from my face

Uh, Uh, Uh, As the years go by
Don't make any false promises
As the years go by
Just say you'll pray

Uh, Uh, Uh, As the years go by
Don't make any false promises
As the years go by
Just say you'll pray, Oh

Just say you'll pray...
