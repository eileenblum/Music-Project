Mel and me, the railway children,
Played the disused line
Run through fields we'd kicked our shoes off
Drunk in air like sweet red wine
Together like suede and leather
No more easy come easy go
I remember the coalmine closing
Her father's face was a sight
Bringing up kids on a pittance. Wages?
Nothing's left by Saturday night
Those days will scar forever
No more easy come easy go
Melanie won't run-run-runaway
Melanie can't come she's got to stay
Worth her weight in gold ooh baby
I'm sold on sold on sold on you
Think of all tomorrow's parties
And giving it all away
There's nothing left here but muck-stack-Charlies
Let's make a run for it, what do you say?
You've got to make it happen
No more easy come easy go
Melanie won't run-run-runaway...
You're one in a million
You'll always come first
All the zeroes follow you
Melanie you've got to save yourself
This time take them for granted
No more easy come easy go
Melanie won't run-run-runaway...
