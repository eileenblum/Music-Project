So baby, you don't have the time
Too busy, you can't see the crime
In keeping yourself to yourself
Well, girl
You don't look that good anyway
Persistence paid off in the end
She insisted we'd only be friends
That was then this is now one year later
It's not right, no not quite
All the lights are on but no-one's home tonight
Girl with a summer tan
Slips through my fingers like sand
All I wanted to see was you
Coming home to me
Smiled so wide I'm tearing my face
When she moved her stuff into my place
But all I see now are notes on a table
Yeah, I love you too
But what good does that do?
We gotta get together baby
Me'n'you
Girl with a summer tan...
I go crazy pacing the floor
Learn my lines
Then you walk through the door
When I see you it fires something in me
Your loving shows
I wanna burn these clothes
Take your right there where you're standing
Lace and all.
Girl with a summer tan...
