I am just a small town boy
But don't hold that against me
Mum's a lawyer, Dad's got a bank
But really I'm OK
Should I stop or should I go
I'm full of indecision
I'd throw it away for a dollar a day
If I could be like...
You made me promise not to mention
You can call round any time of day and see
Me and my family
These things are sent to try us
Or to land us in hot water
Turning grey as my Tube record plays
When I call you, come as you are
You don't need fancy cars or finery
You don't need a credit card to buy me
They'll never understand I bite the hand that's feeding me
Saying I must be mad--that's a matter of opinion
You, I'll give you all of my affection
You and I can celebrate defection
Get up and go tonight, I've seen the light that's leading me
Saying that I'll be back well that's a matter of opinion
We'll work we don't care how long it takes us
We'll save we'll buy that house on the hill some day
Never thought I'd be the black sheep of the family
Never thought I'd be the black sheep of the family
Control me, console me, conceive me, consume me
We all need some space
Just a little room to breathe
My girl friend sees me
I know that I couldn't do it alone
We will shine for you
Come and share the atmosphere up here, now that we're
Over, over the moon
It feels like we're in Heaven, Heaven
Over, over the moon
It feels like we're in Heaven now
Over, over the moon
It feels like we're in Heaven, Heaven
Over, over the moon
It feels like we're in Heaven now
Never thought I'd be the black sheep of the family
