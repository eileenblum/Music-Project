The colour of the evening
With the sunset that bleeds
The fallen on the stony ground
Like so many seeds
We're taking the country
From border to shore
Like people used to tell me
All's fair in love and war

For we are soldiers
King for a day
Mountains to molehills
Peasants for pay
People would cry
If they'd seen what we've done
But we'll be war heroes
When we get home.

We came across the borderline
To another part of town
Her streets were deserted
As we tore the wire down
The women were screaming
As we came through the door
Like people used to tell me
All's fair in love and war

King for a day
Mountains to molehills
Peasants for pay
People would cry
If they'd seen what we've done
But we'll be war heroes
When we get home.
