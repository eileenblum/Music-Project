Wish you were here with me in my head and looking through
Same window but seeing a different view
Dr Winsley he told me I'm unbalanced but that's outrageous
Take a jacket to hold me; what did I ever do wrong?
I'd better stay home it's not good in my stars today
Can't sleep am I falling apart at the seams?
Really out of my head now; is it me or the room that's spinning?
Only water and bread now they're throwing me out of my home
(Here it comes again!)
Suspended animation making the colours all run into one
In my imagination everything's right where it used to be wrong
Facing the music we can't hear the words of the song
Haven't you heard it's illegal to smoke in a restaurant
But it's OK (it's OK!) if you carry a gun
Terrorific news on four from the Lebanon
All those stupid little bastards where in hell did they come from?
(Here it comes again)
Suspended animation making the colours all run into one
In my imagination everything's right where it used to be wrong
Facing the music we can't hear the words of the song
Les, Les the Landlord's here to throw me out
I gave him everything yes everything, everything
But he still wants more
Les, Les the Landlord sends his brothers 'round
I'll take on anything yes everything, everything
But don't bleed on my floor
