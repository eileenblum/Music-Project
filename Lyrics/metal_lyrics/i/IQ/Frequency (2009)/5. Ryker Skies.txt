I'm reeling, fighting for breath
Running on empty
A fortress carved out of steel
Black and surrounding
No other survivors, the walls without end,
So where have I come to?

Welcome, hero, to Ryker Skies
Where all your hopes are stored
You can leave responsibilities in ruins at the door

Get it knocked into your thick skull
It's really not that hard
It's a cast iron binding covenant
And this is just the start
There are insults and injuries
You've heaped upon yourself
But you play the victim
While you pile the blame on someone else

So before I state my intention
To live or die
I command your total attention
In Ryker Skies

They're unspoken, these accidents,
They leave a bitter twist
It's a no-win situation
But I know you can't resist
In walks Trouble without a sound
A deal across his face
He's a won't-stop, screw-top work of art
Mechanical disgrace

So be sure you cast not a shadow
As you walk by
No, you won't be chasing no rainbows
In Ryker Skies
You'll never fly
There was a time
It flashed on by

Nothing to break the iron crown
Tearing imagination down
Strung out and overwhelmed
I've had more than enough
The wings of butterflies
Are made of sterner stuff
With all those years to kill
I'm yours until...

So before I state my intention
To live or die
I command your total attention
In Ryker Skies
You'll never fly
There was a time, it flashed on by
In Ryker Skies
