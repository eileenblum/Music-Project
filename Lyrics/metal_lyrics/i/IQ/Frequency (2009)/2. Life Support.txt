When I think of it now that it's done
How it might've gone without a place to belong
I can see we played into their hands
And they picked our bones until we proved them wrong

It's only a moment
The minutes and hours, they fly from me now as then
It's all in the detail
I've been here before but still don't remember when

As we stared in the face of the storm
And the change began to gather over the bend
There was always a chance it would come
But if you can't make it happen nobody can

It's all but forgotten
The minutes and hours, they're nothing that can't be bought
It's all in the detail
Hold onto your head, you're living without your thoughts
