There's nowhere I'd rather be
'Cause no-one can mean more to me
In tenements racked against the wind
Our desperation reined us in

You drifted so far out of range
I held on but everything changed
How can you be everywhere at once
But nowhere to be found?

Imagine all you could have been
Eventually you would have seen
The wanderlust and all you dared to dream of
If ever you make
One fatal mistake

You broke me, you have no idea
In darkness I see more than hear
Impossible, even I can say
Many would have walked away

A lifetime of living a lie
Like daylight shot out of the sky
So did the truth ever set you free?
Got nothing but that hold on me

Remember all the promises you planned on
The only one whose arms you ever ran from?
The best of you was locked away for so long
Don't wait another day

Imagine all the mysteries you're made of
The great adventures you would love
The wanderlust and all you dared to dream of
Don't say it's too late
One fatal mistake
