Before the veil was lifted and brought to light the facts
The whole deception was complete
The sons of fathers buried their unconnecting tracks
Beneath the layers of deceit

Another place and time we'd have known
We would have seen the last of the lonely

A beast of burden heard in the tangle of the wire
It's gone like it was never there
The great colossus rises and crackles under fire
The static charge is in the air

In other realms of reality
My imitation heart will defend me
To make secure
What you believe

And surely as the day ends the night
It becomes a feast set for parasites

Another place and time we'd have known
We would have seen the lost and alone
In others realms of reality
My unrepentant heart will defend me
Again somehow
Not here, not now

Safer on the waves
Too dark upon the shore
Pressure builds again
More ragged than before
When the will dissolves
It changes everyone

Something worse than us
Is waiting in the wings
Can't prepare for this
Can't think of everything
Is it obvious
What is and isn't done?

The province of the king
The wilderness of stolen things
The untold legacy
Inertia keeps it out of reach
Till I bring bad tidings
The phone rings
There's no-one there

You always said it's the one you needed
You should try to not be defeated
It's what you wanted, a supernova
But now it's landed--don't think it over
It's no invasion at all

You understand this: it's no solution
Still under sentence of execution
No-one like you can create confusion
Embrace the negative, with absolution
Your final positive reward

And I will follow you down
To where the silence is lost and found
Beyond the light that shines only inside
The province of the king

It comes to all of us
Until at last there's no-one else
And if that's what it always does
Then saviour, save yourself
How am I amazed?
How is it still concealed?
I cannot count the many ways
Because there's nothing real

What ransom do you bring
Before the wireless king?
