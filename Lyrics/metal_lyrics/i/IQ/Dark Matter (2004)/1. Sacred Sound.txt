Even after all the days are gone
Even though the writer knows he's wrong
Still the words are written and recalled
In the empty isolated halls
Held in high regard, he comes again
Surface gone from under me, no more security
The future lies erased
These are the last remaining days

If in doubt about the meaning meant
Make this one decision your defense
Stay alive to calculate the dead
Lines of color radiate ahead
Silence now descends upon the earth
Can't deny the evidence
Not now, not even once
The future lies erased
These are the last remaining days

Surface gone from under me, no more security
The future lies erased
These are the last remaining days

The only thing I'll take
While I'm alive and half awake
Is what I've made, no surrender set to fade
The only thing I want is taken out and rained upon
Heart beaten down
No surrender to the sacred sound

When the vision cuts across the sky
There is no reflection in my eye
All the undertakes talk the same
Saving pressure and appointing blame
States of independence form anew
Can't deny the evidence, not now, not even once
The future lies erased
These are the last remaining days

The only thing I'll take
While I'm alive and half awake
Is what I've made, no surrender set to fade
The only thing I want is taken out and rained upon
Heart beaten down
No surrender to the sacred sound

Light shatters the skeleton circus
And the carnival's deadly host
No memory, nothing remembered
From the pages of the Book of Ghosts
Though the system stays in place
What if I'm no longer safe?
Night falling gathers at my heels
Lines the contours of the cold parade
Search everywhere, nothing is revealed
Fear creeps along the cavalcade
Through the fields of evergreen
Passing by as if unseen
Though the system stays the same
What if I'm no longer sane?

The only thing I'll take
While I'm alive and half awake
Is what I've made, no surrender set to fade
The only thing I want 
Is taken out and rained upon
Heart beaten down
No surrender to the sacred sound
