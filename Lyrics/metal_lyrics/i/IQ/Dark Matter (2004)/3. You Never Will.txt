In moods of don't disturb, I'm on edge and then
Afraid, I call for answers again and again
I keep on hoping that you'll do something real
Accept the consequence but you never will
I may have squandered it but what do I know?
There's one good God above us, bad God below
I keep on hoping you'll remember me still
Admit I wasn't wrong but you never will

And there's no way
In a place of illusion pale as glass
One day one thing is sure - this too shall pass
I'll stay, waiting the longest time
Until you come but you never will

Now as the shadows fall on Allhallows Eve
We spin our tangled web, learn to deceive
I keep on hoping that you'll do something real
Give in to influence but you never will

And there's no way
Any time any place we'll meet again
One day with eternal evasion this will end
I'll stay, waiting the longest time
Until you come but you never will

This kind of living death is made in the mind
I find with these restrictions
I'm more deaf than blind
No matter where I look, I'm under attack
Whichever road I took, I always came back

And there's no way
In a place of illusion pale as glass
One day one thing is sure - this too shall pass
I'll stay, waiting the longest time
Until you come but you never will
