Lights are out on Neon Drive
Unprotected in my bed
Behind the walls it comes alive
Shoots again into my head
I see the red dust shadow
In the corner of my eye
Another child is calling
"No, no, where did my Daddy go?
He's flown, I'm alone
When I'm grown up I'll fly too"
Take these things, fold your wings
Words can't bring you back

It's been this way forever
Everything I thought was mine
Been haunted by reminders since 1969
I keep the shadow walled in
In the deepest part of me
And still the child is calling
"No, no, why did my Daddy go away?
None will say, when I wake up I'll know"

Tears I've tried so hard to hide always break inside
Take these things and fold your wings
Words can't bring you back
