Twilight washes over me
I close my eyes, and see her turn away
the darkness comes, with her memory
and as she falls, I have to look away

She called to me within a dream
the night before she died
My life theyâll take away
My light will never fade

Dark eyes hide ancient memories
they call to me with distant melodies
this curtain call that is her destiny
is nothing but a means to set her free

She called to me within a dream
the night before she died
My life theyâll take away
My light will never fade

Donât cry when we leave this place
your eyes have seen too much pain
the fires will burn it all away

She called to me within a dream
the night before she died
My life theyâll take away
My light will never fade
Oh my Serenity
Stolen Serenity
where has she gone?
Where has she...
