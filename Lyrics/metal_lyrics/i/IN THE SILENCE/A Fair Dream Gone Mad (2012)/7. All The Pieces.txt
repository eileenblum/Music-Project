When all of your pieces fall
will you still recall
where this began?
In your broken thoughts, 
can you find any reason now?

Watch all the pieces, fall beneath us now

We leave no trace, of our past
lies are told to cover the facts
A trail of blood, and broken lives
when will we learn, these things can't be justifed?

Watch all the pieces, fall beneath us now
Watch all the pieces, fall beneath us now

And all you know, is all you've known
And all we know, is all we've known
