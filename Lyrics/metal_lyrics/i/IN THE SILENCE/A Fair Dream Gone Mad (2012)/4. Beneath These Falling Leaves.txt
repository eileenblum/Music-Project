Another leaf is falling
and your words disappear
within the empty silence
itâs all becoming clear

And as we finally reach the end
donât know if Iâll be here again, with you
beneath these falling leaves

Another leaf has fallen
thereâs smoke left in your wake
between the empty spaces
all light fades away

And as we finally reach the end
donât know if Iâll be here again, with you
beneath these falling leaves

And now we see our mother
raped, broken, and abused
but will she bury us?
Or will we choose to carry on in light
if we are in time, to heal this broken dream
for lives weâll never see

We all waded through these lies
and see through their disguise
so read between the lines
or leave it all behind
