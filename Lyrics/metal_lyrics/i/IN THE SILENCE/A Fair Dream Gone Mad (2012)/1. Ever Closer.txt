You lie with me, and I feel your energy

And you come to me in this haunted night
and your soul is free, and your heart is mine

the day is warm, light gently falls upon our skin
as we hold eachother
breathe with me and I feel your essence
climb with me, through this doorway in our minds

the night is cold
your arms pull me closer
intertwined we are one together
hold me near, and I feel your heartbeat
all we fear fades into this tranquil night

And you come to me in this haunted night
and your soul is free, and your heart is mine
