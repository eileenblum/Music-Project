Still inside
itâs over now
close your eyes, and breathe deeply
release is waiting for your word
everything they told you is a lie

Itâs all been kept from you
life built upon lies
and your still trying to find
the truth you buried inside

seventeen shades of darkness find you
imagining all the ways they hurt you
all your fears keep you in line
your blind
but their ways are always vain

Itâs all been kept from you
life built upon lies
and your still trying to find
the truth you buried inside

When all the world brings you down
and your feeling no control
itâs an illusion now
but in the end, love is waiting for you

Return
Return
Return
Return

Itâs all been kept from you
thereâs light beyond these lies
and your still trying to find
the truth you buried inside
