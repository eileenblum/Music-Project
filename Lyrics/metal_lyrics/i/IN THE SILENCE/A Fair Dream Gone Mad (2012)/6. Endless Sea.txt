Let it be, weâre free
weâre floating on an endless sea
in the dark, weâll see the endless worlds within
and weâll fall into them together
and see the world beyond these scars
and the pain weâve know

And all along we knew this world was ours
and if we die tonight, weâll see weâve always known

Let it be, youâre here with me
weâre floating on an endless sea
and in our hearts, weâll feel an endless love
and weâll melt into eachother
and see the world beyond these scars
and the pain weâve known

And all along we knew this world was ours
and if we die tonight, weâll see weâve always known
