Your lies fill the darkness
your eyes lead me on
the sky reveals the truth now
no time to linger on, my love

You dreamed with me in silence
it seemed we were in love
if so I see no reason
to hide from me this weight that pulled you down

And it seems that we are stung with emotion
pain we recognize
and all that we were, has fallen apart with your implosion
this is your reward

Goodbye, my love, goodbye

A pain, every day
since I sent you away
Looking back, I guess I should have realized
youâd chase your dragon to your grave

And it seems that we are stung with emotion
pain we recognize
and all that we were, has fallen apart with your implosion
this is your reward
