Cryonic, frostbitten, cold and dead
No trace of human life, not one shred
Across the open sky... ravï¿½skeith flew
Crystalline, destructive, hateful and true!

Desolate despair covers the earth
Cascades of white, have swallowed there mirth
Fallen heroes' submerged in bloody steam
Life's dead, cold exit..... across the beautiful arctic gleam!

The apocalyptic end in white
Least expected, attack in the night
The justifiable final end of all
Frozen hearted spirits have made this world
Finally... Fall!

Behold thy frozen arctic kingdom is here
I leave this vast, desolation with my final tear
I burrow myself in the snow and withdraw my knife
As my final sacrifice of praise, I take my
Life!
