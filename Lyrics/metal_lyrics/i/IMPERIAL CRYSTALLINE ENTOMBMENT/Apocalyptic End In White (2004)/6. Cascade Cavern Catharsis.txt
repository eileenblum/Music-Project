Alas! We gather in northern blackness
Preparing the frozen soul mass
Ritual tablets in place
Let this dark coven make Haste!
Bring forth the first child unbound
Slice him them pass it Around!
Staining the crystals of snow
Shards of ice making blood Flow!
Make the blood flow!

Destiny! Led here by powers unknown
Wisdom through astral nights Roamed!
Echoing moans in our heads
No rest till everyones Dead!
Soon all the oceans shall freeze
Every soul brought to it's Knees!
Once all this life is sucked dry
Completion: it's our turn to DIE!!!
Our turn to die!

But first, Rï¿½vaskeith thirsts,
For blood to be dispersed,
To set the stars align,
And await the sign!
EAH!

Mammoth rise in winter guise,
Take this child to the frozen side,
Empty human born of flesh,
Throw him, To the cold white death!

WWWWAAAAHHHHH!!!!!

Spirit thunder, blizzard hunger,
Murdering, to make us stronger.
Flash of light, aurora bright,
Demon! Enter my sight!

AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

Alas! We gather in northern blackness
Preparing the frozen soul mass
Ritual tablets in place
Let this dark coven make Haste!
Bring forth the THIRD child unbound
Slice him them pass it Around!
Staining the crystals of snow
Shards of ice making blood Flow!
Make the blood flow!
