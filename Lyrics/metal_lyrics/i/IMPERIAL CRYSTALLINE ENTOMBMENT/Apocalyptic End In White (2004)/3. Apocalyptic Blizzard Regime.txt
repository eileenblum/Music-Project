Lord, lord of winter death.... Attack!
Leave, leave no human soul... Intact!
Rape this world and spew thy evil seed
Blanket of white and blizzard stampeed!!!

Azure Aura, transform to white
Winter storm cloud spirits.... gather in the night
Pierce through heaven, Pierce through hell
The resonant sound, the doomsday bell

Despair and hunger.... to eat they need
On themselves and family... they will feed

Fear and pain and tears they cry
Freeze there lungs and make them... Die!

No hope for civilization, Frozen global annihilation
Encase there souls, children, wives...
Shatter there warmth, homes... and lives!

Mummification... entombment under snow
Genocidal screams, through wind doth blow!
Blow!
Blow!
