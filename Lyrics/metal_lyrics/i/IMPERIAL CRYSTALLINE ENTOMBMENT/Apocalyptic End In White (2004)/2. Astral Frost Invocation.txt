We are fucking ice

Frozen spirits of ancient ancestry
Arise in union incestuously
Brother ocean, sister air
Chaotic upheaval I declare!

RÃ¥vaskieth - offspring of winter death
Show thy fury with arctic breath
I cast my blood upon the snow
I unleash thy hate to flow! Flow!

With tears of ice, blind their eyes
With hypothermia, everything dies
Blanket the earth and blacken their sun
Entomb their cities and let it be done!

I call on the crystalline pain
Shiver through the astral plane
Astral... Frost! Astral... Frost!
Invocation... Invocation...
