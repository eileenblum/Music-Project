Down, in the snow, watch the wind formation go
Turn, all around, twisting, morph, into the hound
Rise, demon lord, GÃ¥mork, bring forth, rabid horde
See, RÃ¥vaskieth, unleashing the wolven teeth!

Charge! In their eyes you see your death
Growling, wolf pack, steaming breath
Hundred claw prints in the snow
Fangs of ice, your blood will flow
Northern wolf pack overthrow
Attack!
Yet another demon force
Charging in, they stampede forth!

DIE!

Charge! in there eyes you see your death
Growling, wolf pack, steaming breath
Hundred claw prints in the snow
Fangs of ice, your blood will flow

Unleashed, to, fight!
Chaos, spirits, in flight!
Ancients of white
Kill, destroy with might!

Down, in the snow, watch the wind formation go
Turn, all around, twisting, morph, into the hound
Rise, demon lord, GÃ¥mork, bring forth, rabid horde
See, RÃ¥vaskieth, unleashing the wolven teeth!

YYYEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!

Rise, GÃ¥mork, bring forth, rabid horde!
Rise, GÃ¥mork, bring forth, rabid horde!
Rise, GÃ¥mork, bring forth, rabid horde!
Rise, GÃ¥mork, bring forth, rabid horde!
