Uncoil, uncloak, remove, expose
Through mind, through heart, through flesh he rose
Naked, human, no more, I'm dead
Pure white, pure hate, a god instead
Power and might
Command this light
To surge though me
And set them free
Throw my hand low
Beneath the snow
The powers glow
Upheave, unearth, the ancient thirst
For blood

RISE!
My will, I command
FLY!
Over, arctic land
RISE! Rise! Rise
IN THE SKY!

Serpent, finally
Demon, Ice regime
Flow, past, the open sea
Kill, rape, your word redeem

Uncoil, uncloak, remove, expose
Through mind, through heart, through flesh he rose
Naked, human, no more, I'm dead
Pure white, pure hate, a god instead
Power and might
Command this light
To surge though me
And set them free
Throw my hand low
Beneath the snow
The powers glow
Upheave, unearth, the ancient thirst
For blood

RISE!
My will, I command
FLY!
Over, arctic land
RISE! Rise! Rise
IN THE SKY!
