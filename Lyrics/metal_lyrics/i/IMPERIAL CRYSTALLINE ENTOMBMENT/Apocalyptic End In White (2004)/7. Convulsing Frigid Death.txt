It'll come at night, while you sleep
When you wake it'll be too late
Sirens, foreboding, emergency
Winds will roar like never before
Panic, screaming, chaos, family disown
Every man for his own
Buried, in snow, frozen
Demons advance, you have no chance!

Tunnel, dig and search for meaning
Fingers black and cracked and bleeding
Near the top you can hear the screaming
Hordes of creatures, dead and steaming

Ice bound cities surrounded by snow
Storm cloud spirit apparitions grow
Wincing eyes, through hail, you see a face
Too late now, the serpent tongue you taste

Steal the breath from you
Collapse and turn blue
Gasping your last breath
Convulsing fri-gid death!

It'll come at night, while you sleep
When you wake it'll be too late
Sirens, foreboding, emergency
Winds will roar like never before
Panic, screaming, chaos, family disown
Every man for his own
Buried, in snow, frozen
Demons advance, you have no chance!!

Tunnel, dig and search for meaning
Fingers black and cracked and bleeding
Near the top you can hear the screaming
Hordes of creatures, dead and steaming

Uuuuuaaaaah, Uuuaaaahhhhh, Uuuaaaahhhhh
Gasping your last breath!
Uuuuuaaaaah, Uuuaaaahhhhh, Uuuaaaahhhhh
Convulsing frigid death!
