At usual evening
I sat in my room
I close my eyes
I thought about you
You was better one
Of all my girls
I trusted you
But I made mistake
Once upon a time
I haven't been with you
We were walking on
With all my friends
We stopped at bar
I've seen you
You gently played another guy.
My mind was out
Then I screamed "No"
You noticed me
You started laughing
I was shocked
That's too much for me
I ran somewhere
I thought how could it be
She talked to me "I love you"
I believed her, I trusted her
But now I decided that
SHE MUST DIE!
