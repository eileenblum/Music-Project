Not in magnificient temples
Shining of gods
Beat up the ghost
Carrier of wealth
Not in lightnes arch
The beautiful altars
Not in smoke of soul
Candle of fire.

No that who ones there
in poor cribs
For his son make the cosiness
That and for ghost want the intermost
Hartly cribs norrowness in asylam.

Where ghost consoler arise the temple
For his son shall rescue peoples
Where he want live so as calm
So as truth peace cladness to bring.
