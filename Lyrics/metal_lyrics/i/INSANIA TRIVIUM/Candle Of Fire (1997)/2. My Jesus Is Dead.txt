I stand near by caves enter
I was full of fear
But after first step
My fear disappeared
Inside of the cave
There dark and cold
In front of me
There light alot
I walked into it
When I was near
It absorbed me
I closed my eyes
And I was brought
Away into future
I opened eyes and
I saw all around me
I saw forbidden world
There was only fire
Death and povetry...
Then I am back in A. D.
I decided - there is
No god and
My Jesus is dead.
Word to word
Was born belief
Belief of proud
Untruth belief
