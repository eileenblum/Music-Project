All is lost I do no longer care, All is lost I cry out in despair
The betrayal in her eyes were far too obvious to hide
I felt a pain in my heart, A pain which may never part
My love strong as ever, Yet I know it Was lost
The joy will all be gone after this day has been done
All is lost I do no longer care
All is lost I cry out in despair
Deep inside I will die

In my eyes you
will see the tears I've cried
Now when this madness is mine
Alone, abandoned I stand
With her withered rose in my hand

My God! What have I done?
Why am I left so alone?
Caught by a web made by fear
My fate lies sealed within tears
