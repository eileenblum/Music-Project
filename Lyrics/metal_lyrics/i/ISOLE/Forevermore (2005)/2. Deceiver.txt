I can feel the poison in my veins, Rushing blood governs my time
Freedom expires willing to resist, I'm the deceiver Judas in my world
I look into your eyes, Backstabbing still not aware

Try to occupy all hours not asleep
Lying! preferring to leave
Just a few seconds satisfying weeks
She sucks all that's right out of me
I look into your eyes, Backstabbing still not aware

Soon my conscience has fallen
I despise and I deny ...
My actions serves none but myself
My urge to hold her beyond time
She whispers sweets into my ear
And I am lost in my world of lies
This tempting goddess playing me
Like the master sweeps his strings

I woke up from my illusions with regret, She cast her final spell
All that this sickness has caused, Is revealed just in front of my eyes
I look into your eyes, Prepared to repeat the sin
