Sunlight fades away
Black lightning from the sky
Souls cry out in pain
Darkened gods in reign

Eternal night unleashed, Corpses rot away
No flowers no trees no life, Swallowed in darkness
Myriads of flies Dying gathered on piles
A cold tide of tears Now dried leaving scars
A tranquil planet left behind
Mankind was born to destroy
Creation of all our needs
Calculated fate ...

Evolutions sighs among screaming faces
Countdown is set in reverse
The passed has fallen to oblivion
Next cycle has already begun
