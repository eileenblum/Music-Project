[2007 Re-Release Bonus Track]My wisdom is sacrified
Through years of agony and loss
Immeasurable the hopelessness
Eyes filled, the tears of loss

Instinct of survival, my crime
The intolerance of mankind
The pain, so foolish, so real
My heart bleeds black, you will see

I am my own god
An illusion so real
Love? Hate? How foolish
In the end, who would care?

The night, what pleasure
See the darkness beyond, the nothing
The day, what pain
As the walls they spread, waiting prepared for the day
The end is here, savior
Liberation of our world, pouring our life on the ground
The blood, of our stupidity, feeding us with life

Dreaming threats of life deterrence

Yes! The freedom is mine
Yes! At last I feel fine


Thanks to p_lopezvelarde for sending track #8 lyrics.
