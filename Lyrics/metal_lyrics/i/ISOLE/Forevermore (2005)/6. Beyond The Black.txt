The tears fall still, Silence drowns my will
Ulcerous I've become
By this Emptiness, This damned nothingness consuming me from within

Black hole soul...

Suffocation from inside
Filled with void, The flame of life grows cold
A new days dawn, Seems so distant now
Far above this starlit sky will be my last
The pain i feel is far too real
My yearning grows so strong ...
For my release and for the pain to cease
I can not take this anymore ...

Tired mind, Longing for repose
Weakened still exhausted by delusion
The black horizon seems not too distant now
Far above the sky shall witness my demise.
Beyond the Black there is a light
Please greet me with its solitude

The blood is cold as I watch death unfold.. Cries from silent lips
The tears fall still but this is my will.. The twilight of my life

Devoid of hope when the dusk arrives
I shall greet its coming deep eternal sleep
My awaited end seems not so distant now
Far above the starlit sky bid me farewell
Beyond the Black there is a light
But its warmth I shall never reach ...
Beyond the Black there is a light
But its solitude is not for me ...
