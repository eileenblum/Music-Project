Dark are the walls surrounding me, My journey brings me deep inside
The secrets hidden inside this tomb, The ancient air in this castle doom

In search of the moonstone
This hidden and forgotten power of God
Endless are my thoughts
 Endless this ancient maze from beyond
The chosen one I am, The chosen one I am
The end is closing in on me, My task is yet to be done
In the shadowlands.. The Edge of death
The shadowstone.. The bringer of pain

Deep inside Locked in
Underneath the surface
Moonstone Power of God
Chosen I am
In search for the moonstone
This hidden and forgotten power of God
Endless are my thoughts
Endless this ancient maze from beyond
The chosen one I am
