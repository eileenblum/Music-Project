In the sky above the clouds
A view of what once was
Eons pass before my eyes
Still together with myself I sit
I have witnessed their lives, I have witnessed their failure
I have witnessed their suffering, I have witnessed their death

Their pain is my pain It is my destiny
I will bear my mistakes I shall suffer forevermore

Black clouds of destruction, Tornadoes of devastation
So is their destiny So is mine
Enlightened by death Knowledge is theirs
I have witnessed their lives I have witnessed their failure
I have witnessed their suffering I have witnessed their death
Alone... so alone...
