You have always been in my world (A tragedy I sigh)
I have always been in yours (All I did I deny)
You were searching for tomorrow (Oh, your presence I despise)
I was searching for eternity

Futile are your deeds forevermore...
Fragile are my dreams forevermore...
Futile are your deeds forevermore...
Fragile are my dreams forevermore...

I have always been on my own (All time has been a lie)
I was blinded by your thoughts (All illusions were yours)
We have always been in our world (An illusion we believe)
We are one in eternity

Futile are your deeds forevermore...
Fragile are my dreams forevermore...
Futile are your deeds forevermore...
Fragile are my dreams forevermore...
