Fields shimmering of yellow and red
The sky so dark and grey
The wind touches my face so gently
Rain falls to a wondrous soil

Remembering the light
Remembering the warm
Facing the dark
Facing the cold

The leaves falling from the trees
Sometimes yellow, sometimes red
Yet another sign of what's to come
Naked trees everywhere on the fields

Autumn leaves
In the mild autumn breeze
Autumn leaves
In a landscape of peace

The days are getting shorter
The nights are getting longer
The temperature is falling
The winter is coming closer

Autumn leaves
In the mild autumn breeze
Autumn leaves
In a landscape of peace
