You invite me to dance
Spinning world in front of my eyes
Then the time seems to stop
Now I'm feeling complete, I worship you

When you're gone, I'm in pain
I am down on my knees, begging for more
When you are here, smiling at me
We fly to places unseen, silently

You're my friend and I'm in control
My denial is my fall you see
I'm deceived by the demon in green
I have blood in my eyes yet peace in mind
Peace in mind

Cold pearls of sweat, starving will
See my rotting portrait, dying will
Drowning in vain, gasping for air
Seduced by your sweet taste, the demon in green

You're my friend and I'm in control
My denial is my fall you see
I'm deceived by the demon in green
I have blood in my eyes yet peace in mind
