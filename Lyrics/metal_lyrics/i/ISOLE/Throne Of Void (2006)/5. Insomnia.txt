Sleep, sleep no more
The spell was cast, distant words
Dark, a dark room
But I see far too much

Clear, clear my head
My thoughts they haunt me still
Feel, feeling cold
Escape is not my path

Darkness when the curtain falls, evasive falling down
But something is holding me back from my sweet dreams

Insomnia

Walk, walk with me
Towards a place without time
Hear, hear me beg
Please lay my soul to rest

Darkness when the curtain falls, evasive falling down
But something is holding me back from my sweet dreams

Insomnia
