Relentless ground under my bare feet
Quicksand to sharp rocks
Fierce yet soft as I wish to be
That's what this world demands

The mirror uncovers my soul
Naked and left out
The world devour me instantly
There is no escape from this world

My dreams are worn, fading away
New dreams of reason a child's dreams are lost

Leaning towards my gathered mountain I've built by my truths
But you're there stealing pieces from me replacing with yours
I will be a half-made puzzle if I, if I would lose you

My dreams are worn, fading away
New dreams of reason a child's dreams are lost
