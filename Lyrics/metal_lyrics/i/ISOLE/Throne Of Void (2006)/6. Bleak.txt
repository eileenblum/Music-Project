I'm listening to my heart
The beats you rarely hear
The drum is slowing in
My nightmare's sinking in

I'm opening my eyes
This night is new to me
Everything seems so clear
Embracing dark cold air

I am so old, my skin is cold
The night is mine, forever mine
Feeling they fade, guided by needs
Humanity is drawn from me

Still searching, forever is this curse
Trapped by these four dark walls
Unable to feel love
Eternally alone

I have seen all there is
So tired of this place
Feel my disgust of man
My oh, so deadly kiss

Time is my friend, aging has ceased
Forever young, lost is the sun
Time is my curse, everything fades
My tears are dry, death is my life
