Lying here again
Questions eating my mind
No answers to find
To why I am here
What have I done?
Is this my punishment?
Will I spend my time on earth alone?
The wind starts to blow
I wrap my cloths tighter
Around my tired body
Weary from this pain
Please let me out
From this awaken nightmare
With dread I gaze into the setting sun
Now the Dark will take my soul again
And my heart longs for the end
The end of this pain, of loss, of the loneliness
And life!
The day comes to an end
Coldness sets its talons
Deep into my flesh
And chills my weakened soul
I am at unrest
I cannot find peace
Nor any answers to this uncertainty
Now the Dark will take my soul again
And my heart longs for the end
The end of this pain, of loss, of the loneliness
And life!
Oh, father
Kreator of all
Hear my plea
Please forgive my soul
Now the Dark will take my soul again
And my heart longs for the end
The end of this pain, of loss, of the loneliness
And life!
