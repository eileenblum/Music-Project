No More!
I have fallen into the depths of my soul's shame
All humanity have witnessed my failure and pain
No More!
Dark clouds fill my sky and mind
Clouds of fear
There is no light at the horizon
Nor hope for a new dawn
No more!
An existence of perpetual sorrow and anguish
My end I will greet
The release from this loathsome coil
Set my spirit free
By dawn, I lie cold
Drained of life
Drained of sin
But still not dead
Why?
