All lies in ruins
The world is silent
Under an awakening sun
With dread I wander
Across the wasteland,
through dust and empty streets
No signs of life
In this barren landscape
All lies withered before my eyes
No sounds, nor scents
Not even laughter
In this desolate, cold Hell
I cry without tears, forlorn
I have become
What is this place?
What has happened?
I cannot believe my eyes
Where are the ones
I used to honour?
All my past forever gone
I cry without tears, forlorn
I have become
I cry without tears, alone
I shall remain
Fear inside, cannot hide
From its grasp, ripping me
Loneliness, tears my soul
To a shell, (of) void and pain
The night will come
With chilling darkness
And haunting dreams in restless sleep
I glance into
The distant sunset
And try to calm my anguished mind
I cry without tears, forlorn
I have become
I cry without tears, alone
I shall remain
