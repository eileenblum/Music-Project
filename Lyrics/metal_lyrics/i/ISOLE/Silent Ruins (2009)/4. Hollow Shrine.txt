In the nights embrace, sadness cloaks my eyes
I stare into the cold empty space up above
From deep within I hear a cry
Forming with my voice, a wish to die
Lost is my past,
Shrouded in haze
No future I have
In this hollow shrine
Have my deeds
Caused our downfall
From Gods grace
Into this Gehenna
My birth,
Worlds demise?
All I've lost
Everything is gone now
Damned I stand
Alone until the end
My God
Forgive me!
Blinded by my tears I retire into a shell
Close my eyes to the truth,
I curse the day I was born
Lost is my past,
Shrouded in haze
No future I have
In this hollow shrine
