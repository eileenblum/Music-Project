A rose dark as coal
Born in the wrong shape in a world so fierce
Exposed with no voice
Innocence is lost
Her will tears her down
She will not crawl down in shame

One way adultery will be her misery
Corruption steals her hope within the court of men
Treated like an under aged with no escape from fate
Waiting for Gof's call from the court of men

The verdict black and cold
The stones will kill her soul
And heal the shame she brought upon her flesh and blood
Half buried in the sand with her shackled arms
The mindless horde of men are screaming out God's name

The black rose chained down
Asking why she was betrayed
Her own blood took her soul
Tears disappear in the sand of death

Religious abuse
No expressions
Waiting for the sign
The sign of innocence
The audience is blind
Before the black rose
Dressed in while
Betrayal of blood

Blood loses its meaning
Fear of helplessness
The bloodstone is worst
Gives pain to the heart
Please end this suffering
The face goes numb
Embracing stones at last
Welcoming her demise

She whispers like a mantra
How could you do this to me ?

The black rose chained down
Asking why she was betrayed
Her own blood took her soul
Tears disappear in the sand of death
She whispers like a mantra
How could you do this to me ?
