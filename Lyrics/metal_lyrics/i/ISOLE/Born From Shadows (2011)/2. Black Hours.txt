Endless plains of grey
Coldness sweeps my soul
All lies in
Silence
Far below
The starry sky

A forlorn journey
On a path to nowhere
From where
Have I come ?
Is this all
There will be ?

My memories
Are leaving scars
Please lift this pain
Off from my heart

Desperate hours of black
With this pain devouring
All my strength
To go on
All my will
To exist

My memories
Are leaving scars
Please lift this pain
Off from my heart
