Strengthened by my rest my uninvited guest
Just like an insect which is feasting on my spine

Somewhere inside my plague decides to hide
Twisting all my bones until they turn to stone

My angel, please give me strength
I dream of you, I'll wait for you
All my secrets that I have kept inside
Will come to the surface when you arrive

Turning around to see my fires burn
One fragile glance to see my past
Soon my bones lie pale and white

Hidding in my deepest corner
Where all my secrets dwell

Now I look at you
It makes me feel so fine
You're healing me in vain
There is no cure for me

My angel you gave me strength
An exploding star embraces my soul
All my secrets that I have kept inside
Seems so futile now when you are here

Turning around to see my fires burn
One fragile glance to see my past
Soon my bones lie pale and white
