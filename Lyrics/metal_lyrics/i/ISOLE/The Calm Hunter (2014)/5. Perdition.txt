Decay of grey in a world of dust
Breathe in taste the ancient air
Softly, touch the memories
Thousands of small fragments

In my ancient eyes you can see me dream
Endlessly, dreams is all I have

Breathe out inside my coffin
Lonely, still remembering
My unattended funeral
I was the last of my kind

I was born a believer
Never to follow a leader
I was born to bleed
Never allowed to be healed

All of you mindless fools
Watching from beneath the surface
Distorted visions from underneath
How come, why couldn't you see
All I ever wanted is for you to see clear

I was born a believer
Never to follow a leader
I was born to bleed
Never allowed to be healed

In my ancient eyes you can see me dream
Endlessly, dreams is all I have

Deep breaths fills your lungs
Liquid will finally open your minds
And clear your thoughts
It's too late, lost forevermore
I was the last of my kind
