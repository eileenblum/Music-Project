Quick before the night will turn to day
Guide me on my way
I can feel your scent
In solitude you stand
I am following the signs

The eye of light heal me
When all else will wither you will rise
In the dark you will shine
The eye of light

The world that surrounds me has grown dim
The world has become a lonely dark place

Deep in the forest so dark and wild
My Salvation is at hand
If I will find my dear
I will see again the precious light of day

The eye of light heal me
When all else will wither you will rise
In the dark you will shine
The eye of light

Searching in the dark
Where are you my love
When I'm one with the black
Slowly I can feel your scent
A glimpse of light
In the dark I can see your shine

The eye of light heal me
When all else will wither you will rise
In the dark you will shine
The eye of light
