If I am allowed to tell you lies
Only then I will give you my word
If I am allowed to destroy
Only then I will give you my love

An urge for the dark within my shadowland
You are blinding me with all your light
You cannot erase the flaws I have
I can feel the fear you're trying to hide

All my choices, they are mine alone
Towards the end I will stand alone

I was born a destroyer

And the waves of heat
Play my role
Time for repent is gone
You're dead to me

You are dead to me
