I'm hiding away from all, in a coat of dark
With a darkness so thick and dense, only sorrow reach through
The surrounding world seems so distant for me
So close but yet so far away

In silence alone - my tears flow free
Alone in silence - my scars are deep

Feel a chill run down my neck
Feel the fear from within
Screams from silence in the dark
As it swallows me from inside

I can't see the bright white light, at the tunnel's dark end
Through the dark I will go tonight, until the end of time
I take off my oh, so heavy coat, I want to feel free
Please set me free from eternity

In silence alone - my tears flow free
Alone in silence - my scars are deep

I hear a cry, a distant cry
Closing in, from the dark
I can feel, yes I can feel
A lonely cry, from the inside
