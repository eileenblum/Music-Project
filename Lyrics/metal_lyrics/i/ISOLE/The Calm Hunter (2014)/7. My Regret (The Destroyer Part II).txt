The power within words
Is hard to comprehend
Wiped all beauty away
All we use to have

Only words
Till the end of time
Only words
I wish to erase

Only words
For eternity
Only words
One single night
Only words
I wish to erase
Only words
My regret

The words that killed
All the memories
We once shared
Now they are dead

Only words
For eternity
One single night
I wish to erase
My regret
