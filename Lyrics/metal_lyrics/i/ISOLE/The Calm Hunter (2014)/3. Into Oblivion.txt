My soul is black, as black as the night
Dark demons tear the life out of me
I can't keep fighting, searching the path of life
I'll leave you here with a broken heart

Hopes and dreams will fade away
Desperate cries, but nothing to say
A thousand reasons to end my stay
Eyes filled with tears, falling down, no more fears

Sink into oblivion
Depression will guide my path
Obsession brought by the pain
Give me the strength I need
Am I insane

Please let me leave for eternity
Let out my soul, please set it free
The essence of me will fade away
The memory as well, I certainly can say

Sank into oblivion
Depression guided my paths
Obsession brought by the pain
Gave me the strength I needed
I'm insane
