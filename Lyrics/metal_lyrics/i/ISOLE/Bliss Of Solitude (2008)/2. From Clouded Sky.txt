The morning sun has vanquished
The pale blue light of the night
As the new day now arrives
We clear the ashes in our search

A thousand fires burning
With unforgiving rage and fury
Consuming, devastating
The past that we have built

Black rain falls heavy
Ash and water from the sky
A poisonous redeemer
From clouded sky

Soothing our wounds
Quenching our thirst
Bringing us hope
For a day after this
This day of utter wrath

Bewildered, roaming
Through the mist
How could it come
To end like this ?
Lord, if you hear, save our souls

The night comes crawling too fast
The ruins won't give us shelter
From the cold haunting darkness
And all our anger and despair

Black rain falls...
