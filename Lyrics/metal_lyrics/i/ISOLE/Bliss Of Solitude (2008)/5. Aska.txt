Time moves slowly
Silence spreads
Like rings on water
Reaching everywhere

A new nightfall comes
Will this be the last ?
All around me is gone
A vast nothingness
Spreads over the world
From shore to shore

Under a crimson sky, the soil bleeds black
The mourning sun, forever gone
And all that was, will be no more, never again
In times of Woe, in times of Death

The end of a life
Another begins
Till the end of time
In circles it moves
The pain will last
Throughout all time

The illusion now falls
The drapery
That has covered
My eyes all my life
Now I can see
The emptiness around

Under a crimson sky, the soil bleeds black
The mourning sun, forever gone
And all that was, will be no more, never again
In times of Woe, in times of Death

Langsamt forsvinner smartan
Ett sorglost slut
Pa ett liv av leda
Deneld som gav liv
Har nuslock nat
Allt som aterstar
Aska
