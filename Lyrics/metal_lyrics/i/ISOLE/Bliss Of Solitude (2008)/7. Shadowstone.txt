Forevermore dark the world shall be
Upon the breaking of the seal
The birth of sin and Evil unleashed
In every man's heart and soul

Never again will tears be shed
Upon the Loss of a Life
When it's wielded the world will be
Cast into the deepest despair

Below... Deep down... It lies... Waiting
Slowly... Glowing... Crimson... Inside

(The orb has awakened from its ancient slumber...)

The shadows grow
The Shadowstone
The shadows grow

Spreading across the world... The Shadows grow
Growing darker and stronger... The Shadowstone
Will bring the end as the shadows grow

Cold and Dark
Fear in hearts

Now the night of souls and death
No, no more (life)

Once released from its ancient slumber
And brought forth from its Halls
The Shadowstone will bring destruction
To the son of Eve
