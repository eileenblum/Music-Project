The origin of sin
Lies hidden deep within
The paths to carnal hell
And damnation of the soul

Its mysteries unbound
For the seeker to find
He who holds the key
Shall be set free

From this prison of flesh

By blood, by fire
The pain will set it free
By steel, by death
The pain will set me free
By blood, by fire
The pain will cleanse the soul
By steel, by death
The pain will cleanse my soul
By blood, by fire
The pain will heal the soul
By steel, by death
The pain will heal my soul
By blood, by fire
The pain will set it free
By steel, by death
The pain will set me free

By blood
By fire
By death
