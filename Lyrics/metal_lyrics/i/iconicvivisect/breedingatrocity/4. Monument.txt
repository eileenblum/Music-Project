By choice or force she surrenders herself yielding to their will
Fucking to be acknowledged soiled canvas for the fist and cock
She remains expendable cheap thrill for the random pathetic
Adored like a slab of meat forgotten like the last drop of cum
Empowered by shame, smothered in regret
Every act of abuse a conquest compliant to mask the lament
The pleasure she gains never kills the loneliness

A token of sadness she wears tragedy as a badge of honour
Those she serves will never mourn her loss
Every wound on her body tells another lie
Her memory a monument to self loathing
Her grave is the only thing that speaks her name.
