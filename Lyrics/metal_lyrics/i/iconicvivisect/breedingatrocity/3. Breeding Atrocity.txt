Breeding atrocity rancid is the fruit of their womb
Advocates of perversion engineering the provisions of grief
Distributing misery prophets of affliction
Killed by their own spawn stolen futures, deprived of innocence
Spirits broken at birth no respite from the torture
They know not what they do murderers or victims in the eyes of god
Nurtured by fear progeny of the sick their fate is sealed in blood
They sever the hand that feeds sharing the gift of violence bestowed on them
