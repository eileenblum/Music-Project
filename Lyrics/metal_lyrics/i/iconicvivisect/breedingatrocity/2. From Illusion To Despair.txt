The cruelty of desire, the blindness of need
Defined by nature and an absence of reason
Compromised dignity and squandered affection
From illusion to despair
Spent and discarded like a cancerous organ
Clinging to fools and cowards, pliancy of the weak
Contentment always out of reach
Liars and pestilential whores

Those who sought attention instead of wisdom
The shallow placate the insecure with the grace wounded dogs
Held close enough to push away
Held dear enough to take for granted
The measure of one's worth perishes as if never conceived
A smiled carved in dead eyes
