Insipid, void of all hope abound with emptiness
Integrity in absentia bland and faceless, laced with tedium
Desultory, forged in weakness flesh puppets and parasites
Lower than a serpent's cunt thriving in disgrace

The scum stand proud languishing in their own filth
Pinnacle of the false sycophantic waste of existence
Karma expired in the season of the leech
May they die by our own hands.
