Behold the rise of the monument of superior possession
Grinding the flesh of man, devastating the holy trinity

Apotheosis of genocide, sacramental praise of the will to kill
Bloodsprayed deed of devotion tears apart the shroud of sanity
Fucking divine amok, prey's destiny fulfilled
Servant of terror rapes and kills the bitch of liberty

Death's evangelist -- like a wolf among the sheep
Death's evangelist -- like a blade upon the throats of all the weak

I open the Pandora's box
In the hall of human joy
Raping the world
I enter the necrosphere
I become the scythe of death
In glorious alteration
My tongue and sword
Become the flames of annihilation

I raise the scepter of atrocity
The truth is no longer in disguise
The great shining of nonexistence
Announces the glorious rise
Behold the bestial outbreak
Of sadistic oppression
Breaking the neck of man
Suffocating untrue divinity

Apotheosis of genocide, sacramental praise of the will to kill
Blood-sprayed deed of devotion tears apart the shroud of sanity
Fucking divine amok, prey's destiny fulfilled
Servant of terror fucks and slays the bitch of liberty

Death's evangelist -- like a prophet of your fall
I am death's evangelist -- the devil's sword of infernal war
