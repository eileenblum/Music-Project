Hear the words of the gospel of hatered,
Obey my demand, for I am the messenger of disillusion and contempt,
Hate machines on its way, stronger then before.
The beast is here again to kill the peace in the heart of man,
Raping all the holiness.

I resurrect the angelless wrath,
Bearing the eternal flame,
I resurrect the creed of the purest blood, brethren!

Our will shall become the spear,
In the ribs of those led by false light of hope,
Remember - war is never senseless,
We are the true reapers of death,

Redesekration - superior terror strikes again
Redesekration - infernal gospel of everlasting hate
God has mercy but I have none, you all deserve the same
Death in a gas chamber or a bullet in your fucking head,
Raping all the holiness,

I resurrect the angelless wrath,
Bearing the eternal flame,
I resurrect the creed of the purest blood!
