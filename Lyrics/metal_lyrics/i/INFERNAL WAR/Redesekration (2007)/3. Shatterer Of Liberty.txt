Look through the fire, smoke and dust
And see the eyes of the beast
Revenge burns, behold the swarm of crows
Feasting upon the piles of soiled, nameless corpses

Persecution -- no place is safe
Execution -- no human rights upheld
Purification -- no peace at all
Onward! Into the storm of war!

The only wind of change is the breath of war
Cruelty transgresses, raping human dignity
Conscience is replaced by the abyssic hatred
Caressed by death I slit the throats, one by one

Persecution -- no place is safe
Execution -- no human rights upheld
Purification -- no peace at all
Onward! Into the storm of war!

Into the storm of war!

The weak -- now nothing but prey
Thrown into the maze of torment and fear
The beast of superior genocide unleashed
Condensed hateful lusts ejaculate

Bloodbathed abolishment of liberty
Work of destruction bringing salvation
Your moral standart sinking into oblivion
Your world's collapse, greet your annihilation
