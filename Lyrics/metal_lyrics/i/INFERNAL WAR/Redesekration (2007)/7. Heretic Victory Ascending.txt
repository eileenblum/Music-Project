There is no doubt
Soon the time will tell
What is true and right
When millions have to die

Through fires of hell
The fundamental laws
Of the ancient world
Shall be reborn
...under the black sun

Under the black sun, we shall be reborn
Through war and sodomy!

Genocide sokes everything, mass murder's like a cure
Lead the sheep into the firestorm of fear!

Black sun is rising - merciless cleansing, total death
Apocalyptic climax - our generation's miasmic breath
Infernal conquest supreme - salvation lies in the hands of war
Heretic victory - structures of human freedom burn

Soon the time will tell
What is true and right
When millions have to die
Through fires of hell

Revelation!
Coronation!
Annihilation!
Victory!
