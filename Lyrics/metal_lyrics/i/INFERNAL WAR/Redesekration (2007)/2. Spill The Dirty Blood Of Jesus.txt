Proud and hateful - iron youths, harvesters of death
Seeders of detestation, abhorers of wretchedness
We are the plague decimating the floods of god
We are the spear in the Nazarene bastard's ribs

Agitators of abomination, inquisitors of hate
Rapacious percestors of Satan, aristocrats of nature's creation
We're crown of thorns on the head of the Jewish king
We are the nails in your redeemer's limbs

Spill the dirty blood of Jesus!
Execute the pig in one thousand ways
Spill the dirty blood of Jesus!
Crucify... stone, decapitate!

Behold the holy disciples
Fucking lambs masturbating
Upon the corpse of the Jewish whore
Thoking with holy excrements

We are the blade to cut his throat
Destroy his cult! Execute the trinity!
Crucified messiah, thy kingdom fall!
We'll burn the place where he was born
Deny him, mortify him, spit in his face!
Deny him, crucify him, erase his fucking race!

Die! Die! Die son of god!

Abuse you christian fuckers
I'll piss upon your graves
You're idol's dead and rotting
His temples shall end in flames
