I open myself! Dwell in the maze of my veins
Stain me from inside with holiest disease
Each bone shall be a pillar, each scar a monument
Each word a glare of a million burning stars

A holy nail to stab my eyes, a holy blade to cut my ears
O corruptor, I submit my senses to thy eternal hunger.
Speak the word that was and is to come unto me:
For it is the void, and it is decay

Substance is nil, devotion is all
Ultimate, conscious possession!
Dwell in me as I dwelt in you
I am the grail, and I am the blood!

"and behold, it cometh to ever hunger and ever thirst
To devour existence and eat the blood of man.

Each curse that is spoken shall obliterate a day
When man walked the earth.

And their number shall be higher
Than sand in the desert, and salt in the sea."

I am as a carrion that heareth nor seeth not
The words of my kin are my words no more.
My name shall be forgotten, my deeds erased
Whilst the tissues will infect, and wounds bleed praise

(swiety, swiety, swiety, ktory pluje w swiatynie zycia)

I reject tomorrow, I reject the day before
My blood shall set the borders of space time now complete.

For I have received that which also I delivered unto you
This is my flesh, branded with sacred flames of Gehinnom
This is my blood, boiling within chalice of salvation
You will feast on them in your quest for completion...
