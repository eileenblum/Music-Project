Worthless vulgar masses,
Disgusting stinking parasites
All we need is a new state religion -
Direct, rude and vice
Through constitution of hateful domination,
We'll regain the legitimate might
Executing the one and only right,
A total and complete genocide

When we establish our regime of terror
You will die under our reign of fear
We shall fix this loathsome human error
But you can't see that your end is so near
When we establish our regime of terror
The crown of tyranny we shall wear
We shall fix this filthy human error
Humanity's last breath we can hear

We don't want to ensure your children's future
We want for them to live in dread and fear
Totalitarian evil order we bring
Realize, this nightmare is real

Transgress! Oppress! Depopulate!
Restrain! Suppress! Exterminate!

Hail the regime of terror!
Your painful demise we adore

Hail the regime of terror!
Hateful progress until you're no more
