[Music: Triumphator, Lyrics: Warcrimer]

Built to forever win, built to destroy
Inexorable, built to crush and burn
Fueled by superior blood, by (your) pain and fear
Unholy mass murderer - genocide machine
We'll conquer the enslavers, we'll crush the weak
To eradicate the tribe of the jewish king
Merciless and hateful, we are satan's sword
This is terrorfront, this is infernal war

Terrorfront
Terrorfront
Terrorfront

We can't be stopped on our deathmarch
Towards the invincible triumph of antichrist
We are deathcrusaders, born of hate and scorn
Against your false religion we are at war
We are deathcrusaders, born of hate and scorn
Against christianity we are at war
Your world has to die, you fucking worm
Against your false religion, we are at war

This is the end of your useless existence, you pathetic scum
Die with your jewish lies, die with your god! the time has come
At last!

Built to forever win, built to destroy
Inexorable, built to crush and burn
Merciless and hateful, we are satan's sword
This is terrorfront, this is infernal war
