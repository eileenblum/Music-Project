[Music: Zyklon, Lyrics: Warcrimer]

I want to see you suffer
I want to see your crimson tears
I want to see you agonize
I want to see you bleed to death

I am the terrorwielder
The executioner
Your family's painful death
The messenger of hell itself
I am the terrorwielder
I am your antichrist
Your family's painful death
The messenger of hell itself

Murder  - every fucking lamb of god
Humilate - kill their pride and mock their lives
Torture - for the centuries of lies
Vengeance - raging triumphant genocide

I'm channeling the quintessence of suffering and pain
I'll lead you to your end with para bellum in my hand
Nameless mass grave is your final resting place
Now your god is dead forever, he will never live again!

Dechristianized by para bellum
For the sake of purity
Dechristianized by para bellum
For the sake of evolution
