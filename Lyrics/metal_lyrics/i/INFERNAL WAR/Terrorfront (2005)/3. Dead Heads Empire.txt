[Music: Zyklon, Lyrics: Warcrimer]

Your savior i am not, i'm here to cut your throat
There is no place to hide, you are all destined to die
Where is your god now? your torment has just began
Behold your kingdom's fall, inhumanity enthroned

Your savior i am not, i'm here to cut your throat
There is no place to hide, you are all destined to die
Blood's flowing down the blade of genocidal hatred
Behold the vast mass graves, i'm here to take revenge

Inhumanity rules the earth
Purification's time has come
That is the true face of apocalypse
Dead head's empire is rising

Dead head's emire!

Creation through destruction
Order through diabolical chaos
The ancient laws returning
Dead head's empire is rising

Welcome to the new age of tyranny
Welcome to the nwe age of mass murder

We are the antichrist reborn
The re-conquer the great throne of splendor
Infernal terror camp, we're so fucking proud to be
And victory shall be ours
