[Music: Triumphator, Lyrics: Warcrimer]

Artificial equality - a crime against evolution
Illusion of freedom - a fodder for the blind and weak
Human ignorance is what doesn't let them fall
Those who can see the (true) light know that their life is war

This is the grand intolerance manifestation
Against the corrupted system of their modern world
This is the grand intolerance manifestation
Against everything that tries to make us fall

The archetype of a noble man is still alive
No eternal wanderer shall kill our pride

The spirit of our glorious past lives on in our hearts
We are born of pride that never ceases
No helping hand for the weak, no indulgence for fools
This is the grand intolerance manifestation
