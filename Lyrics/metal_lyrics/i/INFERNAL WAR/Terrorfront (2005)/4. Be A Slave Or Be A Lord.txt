[Music: Triumphator, Lyrics: Warcrimer]

We scorn the weak and praise the ancient light
Driven by the solar will, by the spirit of the noble past
Superior blood - the axis of evolution
No decadence! the future's in our hands

Follow the voice of blood, the eternal source of triumph
All gods are dead and gone so bde a slave or be a lord
Walk the path of strength, the path of immortal pride
All gods are dead and gone so bde a slave or be a lord

The will to power is the key to supremacy
Therefore, spit at the god's prophets faces
Mock untrue dignity
And abominate all wretchedness

Be a slave or be a lord
Be a slave or be a lord
Be a slave or be a lord
Be a slave or be a lord
