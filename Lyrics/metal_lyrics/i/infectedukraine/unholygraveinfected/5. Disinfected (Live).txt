[performed by Infected]You change your mind
Don't care all that press you
You chose your life
It's your demise

Disinfect your head
From empty values
Until you not dead
From human infinities

Masks off
No more doubts
You can't be stopped
No way out

Forward - life don't wait
You can really change it
Spit on love and friends
And you really take it

Disinfected mind

Money - sense of life
It only makes you happy
But when you die
No one ever remember your

Hollow life

Tricked by yourself
And lost all life
Forever dead
You close your eyes
Eternal frost
Not even feel
You life is lost
And it's so real

Disinfected mind

Hollow life
