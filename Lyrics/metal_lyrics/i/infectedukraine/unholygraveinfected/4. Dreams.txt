[performed by Infected]In my dreams I can fly far away
From the fucking reality of life
it's the idol of my own faith
I believe in gun and knife
I walk around the cemetery
Looking for a victim of my obsession
And cold lustre in my brutal eyes
At once betrays
My maniacal passion

Your fire
Burns me but
I'm not even dying
I justify
Your screams and now
i feel like flying
now, at last
I see young lonely girl
She looks really great
I think
Lonnnnnng legs
Big eyes are very green
And she has too sexy tits
Bitchy ass
And all her body quick
Done their job
And now I'm excited
I am longing
To feel her tender skin
My old friend dick is erected

Your importance
So pleasant to me
You feel inside
My obstinate dick
Now we're laying
In dirty tomb
And I defile
Your virginal womb
Your cunt
Becomes so big hole
And I see
You're real whore
i don't know what I hear
Your screams of enjoyment
Or shouts of fear
You lying under me
So tempting and sinful
You want much more pleasures
But you can't be satisfied
Cause you dirty whore
And you tell me
That you venereal infected
And laughing
Oh God!!!
Week later dick
Swelled up, my Jesus
And now I treat
Three venereal diseases
i wake
At the morning in sweat
That's all
Just nightmare, but I'm wet!
