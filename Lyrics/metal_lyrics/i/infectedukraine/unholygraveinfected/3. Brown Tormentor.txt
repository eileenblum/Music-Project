[performed by Infected]Cucumbers, milk
Garlic, honey, tomatoes
Cream, chocolate
Vodka, melon, potatoes
Eat it my friend
You'll enjoy future feelings
Cork up your asshole
And gaze at the ceiling

Diarrhoea
Private affair
W.C.
That's all you can see

Liquid shit
Never eat
All this food
In any mood

Eat just fried potatoes with meat
And you'll never have liquid shit
Understand it don't be so fool
Diarrhoea isn't so cool

Brown death
Inside your ass
Spoiled day
Who will pay?

Don't you think somebody is in
Toilet's busy that's what I mean
"Don't push!"
So come on defecate in that bush

Brown death
Inside your ass
Spoiled day
Who will pay?

Clouds of people
Are walking the street
There is no place where
You can put your shit
Brown tormentor
Is pressing your ass
Shit hits your pants
It is your brown death

Unhappy and
