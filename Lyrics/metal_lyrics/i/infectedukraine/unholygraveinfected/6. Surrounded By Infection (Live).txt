[performed by Infected]Everything clear
And nothing is near
But something is wrong now
You live in tomorrow
You can't see the sorrow
You pulling it through-out
Day after morning
Your time's surely coming
And knocking in your door
Pollution, reaction
That harm from infection
Forever and no more

Surrounded by infection

World devastation
You feel suffocation
Air's taking your last breath
X-rays from the dark sky
Are biting in your cries
Atrocity and death
You never have children
Your wife full-time virgin
You always in sorrow
Black trees and the ground
Of erosion's around
You waking in horror

Now
Pestilence taking your life
Ripping your skin without knife
Putting erosion in brain
But you don't know any pain

Tomorrow
Will never
Begin
Your future
Will live
just in dreams
Infection
You're dying
With Earth
And death
How it seems
Isn't worst

Surrounded by infection
