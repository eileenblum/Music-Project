On the shores of lindisfarne
we storm the holy gates
frozen winds carry ravens
who guide us through the wakes
upon the breasts of the abbess
I carve the crest of Thor
crucified and wet inside
the virgin begs for more
Odhin praise the merciless
we butcher clerics and men
helmets lined with such divine
stained vaginal skin
tearing down the convent tower
to force out our prey
eating out her molten lips
weâll burn this bitch all day
They shall seek peace
and there shall be none
They pray to god
but god is dead
Christian holocaust
Now the isle is enslaved
a victory in store
bastardized fucking genocide
of god fearing whores
with glory come slavery
of ample breasted lambs
worshiping and servicing
their czars of pagan lands
