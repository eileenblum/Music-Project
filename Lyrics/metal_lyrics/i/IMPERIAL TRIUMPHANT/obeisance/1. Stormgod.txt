[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]

I am Thor
I am the God of War
I am the Thunderer
Here in my Northland
My fastness and my fortress
Reign I forever
MiÃ¶lner the mighty
This is my hammer
The wheels of my chariot
Roll in the thunder
The blows of my hammer
Ring in the earthquake
Blown by the night-wind
Mine eyes are lightning
Meekness is weakness
Strength is triumphant
Summa pia gratia
nostra conservando
corpora et custodita
de gente fera Normannica
nos libera quÃ¦ nostra
vastat Deus regna

[Transcription of the antiphonal]

Meekness is weakness
Strength is triumphant
Meekness is weakness
Strength is triumphant
Giants and sorcerers
Cannot withstand it
Force rules the world still
Has ruled it, shall rule it
And thus singled-handed
Unto the combat
Gospel or Gauntlet
Here I defy thee
