[Ilya]

Raise the levies the time has come
For battle the day shall be won
In the name of the frozen gods
we ride
To stand at Odhinâs side
Upon the plains of battle
where arrows fly
Our men are frenzied
but they stand with shields align
Glory goes to those who fall
But war is immortal
and we shall conquer all
Summons to war almighty Thor
Spears and swords
We march to war
Die, or beith enslaved
come the nord riders
as the crimson flags wave
dragon ships line along the coast
my blade is my bible as flesh is my host
Summons to war almighty Thor
Spears and swords
We hunger for more
Summons to war almighty Thor
Spears and swords
We march to war
