[Ilya]

The star of the czar has arrived
his people are trapped inside
torture and kill the friar
Their corpses pile higher and higher
Horrors of war Terror and pain
can you not see that the czar is insane
Star of the czar oppressively vain
show no mercy show no feign
Let the blade of your sword
Set us free
ÐÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÐ¹ ÑÐ¸ÑÐ°Ð½ ÑÐ±ÑÐµÑ Ð²ÑÑ
Kill or be conquered

I am the blade that cuts through the wind
The lion that stalks the lamb
I am the storm that cracks the sky
the spear in the ribs of your god
