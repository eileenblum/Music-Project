[Ilya]

Pray
The gods cannot hear you
They pity you not
So frayed and weak
my fleshbiter sings
through the hearts of these
worthless sheep
who blindly bow
before a Jew or golden cow
the convent cunts quiver from
our Skaldic Nocturne
Hail the ancients
Northern Pantheon
a suit of mail and
Immortal Iron Glory
Figures of the sun
crushed into dust
stain the ascetic halls
with holy menstrual blood
Raid, raid
Apocalyptic tales tell of our
arrival fortify your faith
for it shall be tested
The eight legged steeds
thunder forth
born among gods
we trample ye worms
