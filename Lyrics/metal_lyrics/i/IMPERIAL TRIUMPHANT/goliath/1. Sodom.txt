A shrine to the trident throne 
Upon the altars of whores 
That which is the breath of lunacy. 
What tongues doth they speak? 

Condemnation! Ye sodomites. 
Decadence: gluttons of wine 
and hallucinogens. 

Cleansing vitriol! Rain down from heaven. 
Woe to us! 

Perpetration! of the sticky hive. 
So Shameless: gluttons of life 
Without the Lord they live. 

Searing hellfire! Purging all. 
Purify! 

Clandestine Rites! 
Welcome to Sodom! 

Hail degradation!
