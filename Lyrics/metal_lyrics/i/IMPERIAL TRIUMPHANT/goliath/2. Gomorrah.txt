I am the opponent 
The three faced god 
Whom cries forth crocodile tears 

A megalith of whores 
Caress my yellow skin 
Mine is the voice of nothingness 

The heir of true desecration 
O' sacred bread of shame 
Take us down the path to hedon 
Doth we begin the ceremony? 

I light the ritual pyre 
I lead the whimpering lamb 
into the holy orgy 
I am Gomorrah!
