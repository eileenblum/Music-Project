Join us,
And drink from the darkness
Embrace,
This will of abandon.

Face thee,
With the eyes of vermillion.
And burn these,
roots of sefirot

You dare. Walketh beside me.
A patron of hypocrisy and gall
Parasitic whores grovel at the plaster saint.
Fervent and ready to receive the blessing of the seed

Enter the city of woes
Conjure this malediction
Oâ heaven is ours
Cleansing godless conflagration

Crushing the idol!

In chains your were born.
In chains you will die.

From whips you were born
From whips you will die.
