Born above heaven 
In a kingdom of opulence 
I create GOD! 

Lo! Behold my offspring. 
Tamed and tortured so Nothing is flawed. 
We without faith see Grotesqueries divine. 
Praised, exalted Antigod. 

Drink your blood! 

Empire. 
Sculpt my vision. 
Build it higher! 
Nothing is ever enough. 

Breathing in the cold 
Winds of hel. 
A new Rome 
For us to burn 

Pitiful worms 
Your flesh with breed 
Glorious spears 
My serpents breathe 

Onward, my chariots 
Bring me the eyes of Cerberus 
Hideous creation, 
Bring me ruin.
