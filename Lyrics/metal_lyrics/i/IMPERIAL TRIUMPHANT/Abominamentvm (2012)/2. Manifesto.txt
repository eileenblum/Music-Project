More glorious than the victory of samothrace 
The roar of steel horses, a gesture of destruction 
There is no masterpiece, not birthed of violence 
We trample over the past with spurts of creation 

TO LIVE IN THE ABSOLUTE: REVOLTING PLEASURES 

Blessed is the beauty of speed 
All alone with black spirits inside 
Death, finally tamed, has freed us 
To unfathomable reservoirs of the absurd 

Our art is cruelty and nothing else 
Come my cavalries of crucified dreams 

Crushing onward, like iron lions 
Dance the winged cadence of their first songs 
and why rot? to waste in futile worship 
Standing on the world's summit 
We launch once again, our insolent challenge to the stars! 

Look at us! Drunk with ambition 
Our hearts nourished by fire, hatred and speed 
Behold the great splendor of the red sword 
as it strikes for the first time in our millennial darkness 

THE ONLY CURE FOR THE WORLD: WAR
