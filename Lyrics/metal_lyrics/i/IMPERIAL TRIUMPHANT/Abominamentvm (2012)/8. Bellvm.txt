Landscapes in the sky 
Transfigured grey 
Within this shroud of death 
Boils their flesh, 

Given morbid, unremitting sentience 
There is no beauty in these hills 
Totality of ruin 
And fateless winds from 
The porous earth 
Disperse the herald's mist 

Fused in apokalypsis 
To live here is to die 
To die a gift
