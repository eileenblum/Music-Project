The godmachine spurts blood 
A life: a gear, a cog 
grinding minds to sow its lies 
And feed them to its flock 

Cyclic regurgitations 
of the inbred absolute 
Construct a rigid gearwork 
And mechanize indoctrination 

DEVS - EST - MACHINA 
Rusting behemoth 
Souls writhe in torture 
Singing hymns of ecstasy 

DEVS - EST - MACHINA 
Slave to its own rhythm 
Mastered its creator 
Society of helotry 

The cross, bathed in blood, begins to rust 
Through the hearts of zealots 
Lust for a truth transcendent 
Rots in its creator 

Gears, caked with scum, shall collapse 
Under will to the truth 
Cognizant cogs grind to halt 
of the Dooming mechanism
