Behold
The vast and formless black
Below
Surges the human maelstrom

Swarming, worthless breaths
Asphyxiate in themselves

Churches drown beneath our skyscrapers
Quelled by a vicious elite
A glorious caste of true industry
No gods, no time, no life
Zenith of the universe
And yet, nadir of hell
Mesmorize, entrancing metropolis

Black psychedelia
