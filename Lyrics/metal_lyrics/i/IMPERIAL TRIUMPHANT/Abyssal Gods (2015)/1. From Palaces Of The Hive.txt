Spiraling abyss of the underground
Swirling tunnels screaming failure
Constructing around the dead heart

These maggots breed
In the corpse of our city
Weaker than once was
We are still the fist of the universe

We were born with
We will die without

Unknowing
Uncaring
Just larva in the hive
Unbaptised
Unholy
Flawless useless existence

Unbelievable mass isolation
And intolerable subjugation
Corroded by festering worms
Molting strength, without cognizance
After all, we're just larva in the hive
