All the times we have shared and all the memories I have, 
brought me back to square one. 
Now I'm running on empty. 
Only you could pick me up, 
without thinking twice, 
you wrapped your arms around me. 

When we find truth inside ourselves, 
it's hard not to run away. 
But we must capture and embrace. 
It's how we truly live our lives. 

We will be everything we have been dreaming of. 

When I look in the mirror what I see, 
is the only thing that I can be. 
I come to you now, defenses down. 
Defenseless now. 
When you look at me I want to be, 
everything you want to see. 
I come to you now defenses down. 
Defenseless now.
