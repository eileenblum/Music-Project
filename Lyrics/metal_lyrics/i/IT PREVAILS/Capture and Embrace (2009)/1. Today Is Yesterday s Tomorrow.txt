Though hard times seem to be pressed against us,
I see a light ahead now,
And the time has come for each of us to go,
And learn,
And become what we have been dreaming of.
Just get me out.

Today is yesterday's tomorrow,
And we might not be here tomorrow.
We have to make the best of every second we have.
This could be the last time I breathe in.

That I breathe in.
That I breathe in.
That I breathe in.

Because there are things upon this earth
we as human beings are not meant to endure,
like being subject to an overall judgmental society.
It makes me sick to know that my life will be 
represented by the world we are in now.

Get me out. Just get me out of this world.
This is something that I fear time cannot heal for me.
Everyday it's getting harder to find the energy.
Get me out. Just get me out of this world.
This is something that I fear time cannot heal for me.
Everyday it's getting harder to find the energy.

Today is yesterday's tomorrow,
And we might not be here tomorrow.
We have to make the best of every second we have.
This could be the last time I(we) breathe in.

It makes us sick to know that our lives will be 
represented by this world that we are existing in now.
(Get me out, get me out, get me out.)
It makes us sick to know that our lives will be 
represented by this world that we are existing in now.
(Get me out, get me out, get me out.)
