Become one with yourself.
The faster we do this, the clearer our outlook will become.
The world that you take in every waking hour,
Might be the only one that you have.
Because the task in life is to push yourself,
To be the only person that you could die happy as,
And finding the feeling that takes you somewhere new.
To experience is our goal.
To be close minded is like taking a gift and throwing it away.

Our decisions they will stay.
Actions will become answers, and people they will change.

Because I had the most beautiful feeling inside,
And I pushed everything else in my life aside.
I had it, I felt it, embraced the warmth of it;
And now that it's gone I won't stop until I find it,
Even if it takes a lifetime.
