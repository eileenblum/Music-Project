I will never see the outside again,
From this hole that I fell into back then.
So many people with closed minds,
Who need to see things from the outside,
At least one time.
I feel alive, but there's something missing always.
Change is something I need to see constanly within myself;
My friends and the world.

We are lifetimes away from this and I'm just starting to see it.
Searching further into all my dreams.
I'm trying to figure out where this lifetime can take me.

Pushing myself to always be the person that is living for their dreams.
Not enough time to waste it, not enough promised days ahead.
Pushing one's self is the hardest thing anybody in this world can find themselves doing.
I'm always trying to see it, I'm only starting to see it.
