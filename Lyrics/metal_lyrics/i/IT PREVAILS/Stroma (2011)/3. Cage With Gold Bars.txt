Knowing this life is up to you 
is something you have to hold onto.

There's no textbook for this life. 
No saying what's right for me. 
I'm not settling. 
I'm still listening. 
Just not buying in.

Your wealth and possessions don't impress me. 
Or your life. 
You can call it what you will but your paradise 
is still a cage with gold bars.

I want to know what it feels like 
to hold it in my hands and heart. 
And let the warmth bask over me. 
The feeling of being alive; hold it. 
You never know when its leaving. 
Let the course that's supposed to be, happen.
