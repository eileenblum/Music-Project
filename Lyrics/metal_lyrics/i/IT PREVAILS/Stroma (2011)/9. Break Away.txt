Living in a world of tradition, I'll break myself away.
We all need to go our own way and chase all the horizons.
You need to feel for yourself and break paths with those that will blind you.
A man that tells you how to feel is a man that will tear you down.
They're only depriving from themselves the experience that could define who they are.

But we will find ours, we will find it.
We will accept from the world all that is has to offer.
We're not blinded, we carry the fire inside ourselves,
And we will burn the tryant beside us.

Line up the world's traditions.
They will be broken down, they will be set on fire.
By the will to change for the better.
This is our chance to break way.

With tradition gone, what feels right for me will stay.

It baffles me how many people live their lives,
With eyes cloaked over and only see one dimensionally.
They push their beliefs on you and me.
But trust me, their fruitless efforts will go unseen.
