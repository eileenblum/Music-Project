Always know that the time you have right now might be your only time at all.
This is the only thing you need, everything else is a luxury.
Don't let the weight of the world be pushed down on you.
Let your altruistic mindset fight for you.

You're not a slave to past generations.
You have a mind of your own and a heart to feel anything you desire.
If it feels right for you, fuck anyone that tries to put you down or say otherwise.

I don't live for you, I live for me.
I won't let the world's obsolete traditions be pushed upon me.
I will throw gasoline on the bigot in front of me.
I'll take your set of beliefs to tired and set it all on fire.
I'll lead the direction for the will to change.
We'll leave the ashes of false idols in our wake.

Reliving this again, this time making everything last.
The course is set on target, it's a fight we know too well.
We'll make the same mistakes, fall victim to ourselves.

Always know that the time you have right now might be your only time at all.
This is the only thing you need, everything else is a luxury.
You're not a slave to past generations.
You have a mind of your own and a heart to feel anything you desire.
If it feels right for you, fuck anyone that tries to put you down or say otherwise.
