Face to face with the world by day, and it's idiocrasies.
A decent sense of direction is the only thing that's keeping me on my feet,
And my head to the ground.
If I don't see I can't believe.
I am free and I'm not convinced that easily.

Listen, open your eyes.
Everything that you've been searching for is right here, waiting.

I don't claim that I know everything,
But I know a presumptuous desire for a second life is not me.
To live in vain, it's not me.

I've been told there is a reason for us being here.
Our lives are gold, but they will be lost,
Like meteors burning in the atmosphere.
I'm not sold that easily,
But I'll give hope to those scared to die like me.
