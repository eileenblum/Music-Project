It's funny how the time runs out,
And the window of opportunity,
That you've been waiting for all your life,
Just seems to slip right by.
It's our chance to take it, where most will break it.
We will hold onto the feeling of living for ourselves.

It starts in this moment right now.
It's something you can't let pass you by.
It will be haunting you for the rest of your life.
I've seen it in my elders,
Bitterness towards the fact we're living for our dreams.
That's something that they never could quite complete,
Or even have the heart to try it.
How will we ever know if you can't even put yourself out there?
