Watching, waiting for a question worth asking to come to mind.
It's nothing under here the world it hears us

It's the words you're saying but the way you open and close your mouth
It's not like last June
It doesn't have the magic of the words and the lights go out,
When our eyes were all open at the same time,
Open wide.

Why don't you sit down for a moment to let me say,
Something that might change your whole mind.

It's the words you're saying but the way you open and close your mouth
It's not like last June
It doesn't have the magic of the words and the lights go out,
When our eyes were all open at the same time,
Open wide,
