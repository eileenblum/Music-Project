Letting go is the hardest thing I ever had to do. 

The light of the road ahead, illuminates my,
Imminent time that finally came to me.
So I can walk in the wake of my ideals
To be casted into the burning flames.
Never. More reason to go further and beyond.
Beyond my wildest dreams.
It came from my mouth,
My heart served as the words,
I'm compelling, to move higher. 

And in my life, I saw that things were left incomplete.
Another day is another chance, to prove myself.
I will remain stronger. Than ever before. 

To be grounded or lifted off my feet,
It was the choices of life or despair.
I was left to fend for myself from the hurt that brought me here. 

The wind will forever be at my back.
