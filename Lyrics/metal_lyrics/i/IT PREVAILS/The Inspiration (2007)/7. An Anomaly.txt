I am the chosen one.
And with this voice I can compose, a new sound, an anomaly. 

I want to see words fall from this pen onto these lines.
I want to see me and my friends rise above in these crucial times.
Hear me now; as I find myself, my feelings hold me down. 

Without words, communication and the passion
In our brother's lives, are never heard.
Without love the capabilities of our hearts are never reached. 

We have to open our minds, open our hearts.
I've never felt so empty; my words have never fallen so short.

I try to fight these changes but I lack confidence.

Everyday I wake, time wears me down, I am falling apart... 

I want to see words fall from this pen onto these lines.
I want to see me and my friends rise above in these crucial times.
Hear me now; as I find myself, my feelings hold me down.
And as I rise up I always fall to the ground... 

Even though I shall fall, I will always stand up,
Dress the wounds, breathe in the air,
This is who I am, I am an anomaly...
