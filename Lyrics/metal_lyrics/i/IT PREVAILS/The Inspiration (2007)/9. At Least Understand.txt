I only hope you understand the invigoration
That has filled me within these past coming years
I have felt more than any other living being on this earth,
I was born with a resentment only few can understand
But to capture everything I'm yearning for within this moment,
Is a feat most men can't comprehend within their lifetime
I have fallen from grace in your eyes
Only to ache, from the will to return to the place in your heart
I know I've captivated something in you, after all these years
If you can't see, at least understand
I don't believe that I have ever seen your eyes look so tired
In my mind,
It's better if we both take time apart and fix ourselves
If I decide to reunite with an old friend, or make amends,
Or just pretend to be alright with who you are, well I'm not
