I cannot walk alone, and as I walk,
I must make the pledge that I will march ahead,
And not look back with anger
But with a resolution
Extend your hand what's there to lose?
What I stand for won't be abused by your words this time
Embrace what we have
This is a moment that we'll never forget
This is for me, and for you, and for us
Step inside a world of difference,
You love to hate so much it fuels my thirst for a better end
Instead of a knife in my back,
I'll pull it through with my own hands
