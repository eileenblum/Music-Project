Today is the day that I face the fact
That the world is what I make of it
And if I change today,
Then I'll have a chance to show
Real true love for one thing in my life without failing
From here on out, I vow to push myself another step above
From here on out I vow to do my best for the ones I love
Today is the day that I take the past mistakes
That I have made and I throw them out the window
Along with the people that have fucked me in the past,
To show them that the best revenge is success
And who I am is everything they wish they were
We've taken nothing
We're giving everything back
Today is the day we realize we need to change
And reflect the light of the gods that we were born to be
I'll bury my mistakes as I bury you
