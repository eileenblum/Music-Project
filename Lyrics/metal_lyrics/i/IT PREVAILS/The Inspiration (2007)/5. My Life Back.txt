Living in this world I have learned what it means to be,
Forever in a place where times stands still
I hold this key, and I'm content with no set ties.
Forever in a place, I'll take this day, as a new beginning
I have grown and branched from what I was,
And what I used to be
I took the fall of my life and I got back up
Thanks to you, and no thanks to me
No blood, no fears
Only eyes are filled with tears
