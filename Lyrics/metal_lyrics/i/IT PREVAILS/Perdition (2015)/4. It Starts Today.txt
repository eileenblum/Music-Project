Reaching, dreaming and searching are all ideas that seem to be fleeting..

Please don't pass judgement on what I have to say. I can't help but hold onto thoughts from yesterday.

The world has shown me who I don't want to be. They push their beliefs onto me. It's always happening. I'm choosing not to change but I know I can. Time and time again.

It's never changing. These demons I fight day to day. It's time I said it.

Wasting time again. Covering the mistakes I've made. I'll take the steps I need to make a change. It starts today.
