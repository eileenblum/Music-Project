We go searching for that road again. That we found so long ago with our friends. It felt like gold in our hands. But it's worth was less than half, in the eyes of a common man.

I saw the open door on the plane that we created. It was pulling you down by the weight of the world, it was getting closer every second. You chose to fall all the way down. You made your choice and you took my gift of a parachute and burned it.

I swear I'm never coming home. I know that I will end up alone. Never coming home.

I am overjoyed by the way I used to love. You break me down just to pick me back up.
