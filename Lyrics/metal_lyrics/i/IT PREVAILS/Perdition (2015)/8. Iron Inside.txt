I have lost the person that I knew. The person that I was when life was full. When this life had fucking meaning. My vigor and will was strong. Like the bones inside my back that hold me up against the weight of this world.

Where's the will at? (Where's your will at?) I just kept on falling way down.(all the way down) Until my hands were out of reach.

Deep within these molds, I am cast from hours of pain. My darkest of days. I am Iron Inside.

I tried to beg you for forgiveness. Silence answered my prayers. You said that you would bare witness. You were never there.
