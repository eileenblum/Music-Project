[music - Sean McGrath]
[lyrics - Ross Sewage]

The surface teeming with the most noxious infestation of all
Through touring endeavours we will ensure humanity's fall

A strain of Yersinia Pestis we've created
To our whims bacterial genomes we've mutated
A virulent plague coming of age
A petri dish culture carefully bred
Until all tests subjects were certainly dead
Pathogenic properties increased exponentially
Unicellular organisms bent on destruction
With like motivation were in total conjuction
Birth the disease so mankind can cease (to be)
Attenuate endospores for the vaccine
Self-innoculized and resistance is gleaned
With an immune barrier, we're contagious carriers

Four vectors parading as an act
Amongst congregations who are apt to contract
Our sickness to all who witness
Epileptogenic sounds on instruments are made
While from the pulpit the illness is parlayed
Crossing through nations, a patho-migration
Airborne infection giving you fever
Cephalalgia splits your head like a cleaver
The pain crippling as your vomiting
Unwarranted paroxysm results from delirium
Dipsomania an unforeseen symptom
Your actions obscene, once you've seen green

Epidermal eruptions of pus filled cysts
Relentless molesting causing pyosis
Taking on a green pallour from swelling so deep
Aching boils mellifluously seep
As you are left to weep

Septicemic pyemia, there's poison in your veins
Saprophytic vibrio ingesting dead membranes
Spirillum minus inflaming sodoku
Steatorrhic psilosis, you've really got to go

[solo: "Ashes To Ashes, You All Fall Down" by A.S. LaBarre]

Replete with bubos, cankers, and sores
Attendees succumb to the coccus in scores
Our pestilence shall end existence
Agonizing cries give way to chorditis
Hushed death rattles, thanks to bacillus inside us
No sound passing cancrum from expiring scum
Integumental ulcers evidence disintegration
To your demise, we raise our libations
A festive soirÃ©e as lives pass away
No anti-biotic can stop our pandemic
Our disease and debauchery campaign is systemic
Take to the pit and your life is forfeit

The surface teeming with the most noxious infestation of all
Through touring endeavours we will ensure humanity's fall
