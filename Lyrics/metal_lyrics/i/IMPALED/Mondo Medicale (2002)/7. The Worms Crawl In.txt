[music - Sean McGrath]
[lyrics - Ross Sewage]

My temple subjected to third world rigors
Mites, lice, and chiggers
FÃ¦cal particulates undermining hygeine
Larvae gestating
Nematodes penetrate through bare cutis
Budding hydatid cysts
To legions of parasites I will cater
A human incubator

Bowels transmuted into stygian pits
DiarrhÅic fits
Omentum impacted by a septic infusion
Intestinal occlusion

Invasion precipitated by a vermes wermacht
Treatments are for naught
Burrowing through my sebacious glands
Muscles serrated into strands
Domestic quarters for all manner of vermin
Inside of me squirmin'
Linear lesions across my forearms and hands
Larva migrans

Plerocercoids gorge and migrate
Tunneling will not abate
Uretal fibrosis from the rubble
Now, urine trouble

The worms crawl in

The Wohlfartia fly is making a nest
My epidermis, a home for the pests
Gasterophilial infants are binging
As the creeping eruption is inching

Viscera gnawed away
By parasitic larvae
This life, I have rued
Reduced to worm food

Sparganosis generates fundal ulcerations
Adiposal liquidation
A mass of scolices clotting the cecum
Impacted scybalum
Quenching parched mouths on my succus entricus
Ingesting the viscus
Through the shinc-door, the pupa are lured
The early worm catches the turd

Hyperemesis induced for tÃ¦niacide
Useless tonics imbibed
Atheroma results in gangrene
A voracious maggots dream

The worms crawl in
The worms crawl out
