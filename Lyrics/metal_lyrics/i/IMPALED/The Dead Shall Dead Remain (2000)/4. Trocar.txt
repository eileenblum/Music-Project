[music - Leon del Muerte]
[lyrics - Sean McGrath]

Impacted tissue is riddled with clots 
Morbidly studying your gross anatomy 
Perinium is sullied with moldering pus
A mass of gelatinized forensick liquidity 
Locating my trocar, the tool of my trade 
Emaciated fingers nimbly find what I need 
Desiring the gavage, I hastily optate 
Into your chest intercalated as your innards I bleed 

Muscle tissue rips, my needle drips 
Proceeding with my work, I'm an insensitive jerk 
Acid from your stomach is disgorged with a splat 
Liquid offal gargles in your throat 
Embalming tubes occluded with clumps of rotting fat 
Decaying larval brine is force fed until you choke 

Impaled on a spike, internal organs are sucked 
Mellifluent gore by the buckets is drained 
Pernicious bilge is pumped from your gut
Acidic bacteria now mangle your brain 

Lactating pus
Eructating guts
Decorticated stiff
I take another sniff 

Macerated veins are with a trocar dislodged 
Playing host to my probe, your pelvis now sprays 
Abdominal saliva is splattered from your anus 
Lathering my needle, your ignominious remains 
Easing the point into delicate flesh 
Declension with steel is sublimely enmeshed 
Irrigated fluids cake the porcelain slab 
Methodically in-vaginated with bromidic scabs 

Pus, from your veins, is tapped 
A bloody awful mess, your corpse is bloodless 
Lancinated gore is sapped 
Exenterated sot, your withered cadaver will rot 

Decaying on the slab 
I take another stab 

[solo: "The Mortician's Sword" by L.d. Muerte]
[solo: "Lachrimose Germentation" by S.C. McGrath]

Muscles are imbued with a gelatinous mix 
Prepatent secretions from your bowel make me sick 
A redolent mephitis maturates in the guts 
Laughing at your humor as it seeps from the cuts 
Ensmultified with larvae, your carcass is replete 
Drawn and quarted in a morgue as innards I delete 
Ichor is liquesced and from veins gladly pumped 
My nocturnal vocation has my colleagues quite stumped 

Packed in a coffin full of salt 
An acrid scent seeps from the box 
Lye is applied as the earth is fed 
Ensconced in a tomb, for you are quite 
Dead
