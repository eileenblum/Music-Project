[music - Ross Sewage]
[lyrics - Ross Sewage]

Exhumed, debauched and consumed 
My torpid flesh has been sullied by your spunk 
And I have played privy to your necrotic whimsy
You so enjoyed inhaling my decrepit funk 
My organs and entrails you delightfully assailed
Thrashing mound of thoracic de-activity 
A lover you have found, six feet down 
Licking from my skin the moist lividity 

Torn from the tomb for your lustful desire 
My fouled viscera are what you admire 
An unholy union on a funeral pyre 
A caseated carcass really lights your fire 

A sickening treat under the sheets 
The rigor mortis of love can be hard 
And the love that we have made, from the grave I was laid 
Rubbing your genitals in my congealing lard
A glistening liver and ensanguined gut 
The erotic intestines of this grumous mound 
Embalming fluid and morticians Y-cut 
Turn you on as my omentum you pound 

Humiliated corpse, insults are compiled 
Penetrated rectum, no guilt reconciled 
Laid in a repose with a grisly smile 
Used and abused, my existence defiled I'm a lover of the dead, as a corpse 
you'll share my bed, but your usefulness is bled 
Back to the grave 
I've had my sick fun, but now I am done, it's time for you to cum 
Back to the grave
Our affair is through, I've no more use for you, you've paid your deathly dues 
Back to the grave 
We've shared death throes, but my love has decomposed, and now you will go 
Back to the grave 

Once you needed me 
But now you'll go solo 

[solo: "Death's Sweet Embrace" by S.C. McGrath]

Callously flaying your skin, no cum-passion, I confess 
Revealing muscles and tendons to lasciviously caress 
The object of my dissection, a foetid mate at best 

Relentlessly tugging at heart strings through a hole I tore in the chest 

[solo: "Rending a Broken Heart" by L.d. Muerte]

Employing a probing tool to penetrate the dry orifice 
Grinding pus and masticating grume, I ram the ass with my fist 
Be not distraught as your cadaver I drop, the remains of your lips I kiss 
Thoroughly infested with maggots, your body has brought me such bliss 

Sanguine amour 
Dead meat to crave 
Putrid carcass 
Cannot be saved 
Back to the grave 

Supple white flesh, bleached with death 
Masturbate on my maggot eaten face 
The cold touch of the dead (it has been said) 
Can inspire a necromantic craze 
You partook in love and human remains 
With my disinterred body you were chuffed 
But as I fall to pieces near the end 
My rottenness will force a break-up 

Sever my skull and I'll give you head 
About your boudoir my limbs are spread 
But with your hunger for death now fed 
This relationship is dead 

I'm a lover of the dead, as a corpse you'll share my bed, but your usefulness 
is bled 
Back to the grave 
I've had my sick fun, but now I am done, it's time for you to cum 
Back to the grave 
Our affair is through, I've no more use for you, you've paid your deathly dues 
Back to the grave 
We've shared death throes, but my love has decomposed, and now you will go
