[solo: "De-Incarnated Mass of Fungal Strains " by S.C. McGrath]

Pulling the morbid stiffs 
From the damp, sepulchral tomb 
Harvesting the rotten 
My vocation, to exhume
Methanous tissues removed 
With procedures so emetic 
A sordid conflagration 
Your corpse is quite pathetic 

Dissecting body parts, disinhumed 
As my head starts to reel from the fumes 

Consuming the cadaverous chyme 
Sopped up from the crypt 
I morbidly dissect 
As jellified muscles are ripped 
Oozing thoracic pulp 
Is thoroughly molested 
Engorged with cankerous phlegm 
I've left you quite congested 

Grinding the dead into slaw 
As formaldehyde drips from my maw 
Committing your remains to the mud 
Eternally, you'll rot 
You're only flesh and blood 

Your remnants are boxed 

[solo: "One Foot in the Grave" by S.C. McGrath]

Bones have been picked 

[solo: "Distressed Fallopian Discharge Bottled and Sold" by L.d. Muerte]

Your carnage interred 

[solo: "Uglinous Erosion of Necrocellular Proteins" by S.C. McGrath]

A botched, necrotic wreck 

[solo: "Blood Bank Robbery and Singular Enjoyment of Booty" by L.d. Muerte]
