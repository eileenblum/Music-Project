[lyrics - Leon del Muerte and Sean McGrath]

The colon explodes with diarrheal sepsis 
Anal leakage ecstactically shed 
A stenching mass of post-bolal rot 
Corn laced reeking ano-gastric snot 
Your skivvies besmirched with foetid mung 
Liquid viscous, peanut dotted dung 
Your rectum protrudes from its now swollen rim 
Your diapers are filled to the brim 

Virgophrenic ass 
Through which the sludge is passed 
Colypeptic chyme 
It always hurts the first time 

Defecate, remove the dregs 

Terminal colorrhagia 
With an afterbirth of chyle 
Saponaceous foam 
To you lips, bring a smile 

[solo: "Manual Deinstallation of Ordure from Partially Decrepit Bungs" by L.d. Muerte]

Table manners lacking in grace 
Your fingers used to stuff your face 
Your breech still emitting rancorous poo 
Pour another bowl of butthole stew 

Your anus wiped clean with antiseptic pads 
Depuration of faegalical clots 
Powdered with talc, your bilge takes on a pallor 
Decrepitation, a sickening false alarm 
Digested pablum disposed of with haste 
Bursting at the seams, a bag full of waste 
Decontaminated, to try and make amends 
You're bound to fill your trousers again
