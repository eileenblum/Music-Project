[music - Sean McGrath and Leon del Muerte]
[lyrics - Sean McGrath]

Your ribcage is avulsed 
Mangled, chopped, and hewn 
Organ meats have been sundered 
And about your coffin strewn 
Latent germs deliquesce your guts 
Fermenting your simmering brine 
Upon this loathsome, steaming mass 
I'm predisposed to dine 

Dehydrated liver is quenched with grog 
In a gurgulating froth, dissolved 
In purulence ruptured, your bowel has turned septic 
Your innards are now devolved 

Intestines turn to slush 
Vitriolic mush 

Inebriating fumes, mind altering effluvium 
An intoxicating funeral binge on post-digestive chum 
Carbonated gastric stew 
Excreted, distilled, and imbibed 
A nidorous concoction fermented to proof 
The dead I tap, siphon, and grind

[solo: "The Siphoning of Liquescent Dead Tissue for Use in the Fermentation]
[of Grain Alchohol, and the Consumption Thereof" by S.C. McGrath]
[solo: "A Porcelain Visitation" by L.d. Muerte]

Spirits of the dead 
Sip the rotting head 
Repulsively imbued
With necro-holic brew
