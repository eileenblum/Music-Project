Latent images in solutions submerged 
A gallery of gore for posterity preserved 
Your visage shall endure long after you've been laid to rest 
Immortalized in celluloid as record of your death 

A recremental work of art 
Artuated straight from the heart 
Your destiny is black and white 
A grisly study in still life 
A kalopsic collage is your patchwork grave 
The cutting room floor is where you spend your last days 
Anonymous atrocities, my subjects are the dead 
An amateur gorenographer cutting off heads 

Glistening gralloch, a zoetrope of rot 
Exenterated torsos coacervate and clot 
Veristic works of art are developed and displayed 
Decomposed and posed as I prepare another plate 

On my nefandous noctuary I diligently toil 
For a carcass exfodiated from hallowed soil 
An axunge prepared to grease the gears 
Lacking my wit, kin may shed tears 
Cohesive structure is what you lack 
A poultice of plaster will fill in the cracks 
Sculptures in flesh are my medium du jour 
Your puniceous effigy I faithfully restore 

Abdomen is spliced and the lighting is set 
I'll develop your roll as my ensanguined subject 
Holes drilled in your skull form a camera obscura 
This document of death will be rather thorough 
My scrapbook of horror is your final epitaph 
Pictures from the after world, a corpse photographed 
Your countenance embossed in silver gelatin 
A gruesome reminder of your untimely end 

A test sheet is used for the final cut 
Through trial and error I make my decision 
The template enlarged to a grainy print 
This excoriated exhibit, my final revision

Artistic license I must take 
Depleted bones I'm apt to break I strike the set, this shoot is a wrap 
Your casket occluded with residual scraps 
The harvest I find in a moldering crate 
A cadaverous curio with which I create
