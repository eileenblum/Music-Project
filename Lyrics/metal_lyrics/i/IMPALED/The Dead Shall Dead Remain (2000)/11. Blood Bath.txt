Necrotic ooze poured from a carafe 
Acquired for a blood bath 

In the morgue lies a treasure trove of lividous compounds decaying
A trocar suctions out the blood while a sphincter suffers my raking 
With reams of ichor and surplus of fÃ¦ces, the dead are so giving 
A boundless supply of foetid excretions compels me to lavage the stench of 
the living 

My skin sullied with the filth of life 
Vomit of my pores with which I am rife 
In my crepitated pits bacteria thrive 
Momentarily subdued by this morbid dive 

Cadaverous fats boiled into soap for a rotten lather 
Ensanguine mix of excreta and chyme, the cleanser I have gathered 
Putrescent spilth and human chum squab over the lip of my tub 
Soaking in the dead, skeletal remains exfoliate and scrub 

A cauldron teeming with wasted corse 
This mortal soiled with pus and remorse 

Out, out damned spot, caught red-handed, blood stains so hard to clean 
Arteries pumping crimson kelter, veins to expunge and ream 
A babe from the womb untimely ripped, bereft of life, it's squeezed and 
drained 
Placenta sponging at this corporeal form of which I am ashamed 

Basted organs 
Sebacious glands 
Cooked in a vat 
For a blood bath 

Scour away integument to reveal the fleshy tendons that I'll 
Abrase with cholic acid and with a solvent composed of bile 
Scrub out my gullet with a pro-septic wash that will 
Erase this mired being to be drained with the rest of the swill 

Post-mortem spew and excrement garnish the mort bouillon 
Meliorated with moldered viscera in my dead body lotion 
The necro-emetic concoction, effervescing with unctuous suds 
Desoils me of my besmirched existence, submerged in a basin of blood 

Blood bath
