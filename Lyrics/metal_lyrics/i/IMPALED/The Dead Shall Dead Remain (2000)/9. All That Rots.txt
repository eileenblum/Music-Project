Wholly rotten, your body decayed 
Your husk a decomposing organic sewer 
Ichor boiled, congealed, and reduced 
Into a fustular mass of fertile manure 

Liquid waste expelled 
With a nauseating smell 
Your innards have started to turn 
The stink makes my sinuses burn 

With intestinal fortitude I'm forced to digest 
This purulent victual with which I'm obsessed 
Greedily binging on glistening turds 
As gristle and fat form globular curds 

Pulsating liver is violently excised 
Pureed, brewed, and mulled
A gustatory treat for the mentally ill 
With which my senses are dulled 
Your kidneys are stewed and with offal imbued
Infused with simmering gore 
Of carbonized entrails and all that is rotten 
I'm quite a connoisseur 

A foetid tapioca is prepared in your colon 
Nauseating pudding, thickened with pus 
A genital soufflÃ© is concocted on the fly 
Post-mortem nutrimentof decomposing guts
Putrescine elixir is quaffed to kill the taste 
A most refreshing aperitif
The noxious beverage is tapped from your skull 
You're repulsively rotten beyond belief
