I'm still registering a flatline on the EKG - no pulse, no BP.
Is this defibrulator even plugged in?
Affirmative, the monitor shows full power.
Clear!
Increase the drip.
Forget the drip, give me 100 CC's directly into the jugular.
Christ!  The infectant's spilling out of his ass.
Abdominal adema -- lower the valve pressure.
Still flatlining, negative brain function.
Ahhh!  Remove the ventral sucures and spread the ribs - I'm going directly for the heart.
It's not working.
500 CC's of atrepine now in the right ventricle.
But that's enough to kill him!
Which really isn't a problem, considering he's still dead.
