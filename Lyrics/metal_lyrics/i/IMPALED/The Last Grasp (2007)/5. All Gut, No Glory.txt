[music - Ross Sewage, lyrics - Ross Sewage]

Blubbering gelatinous mass of lipids and pendulant flesh
An ovoidal organism cursed with cognizance
Bereft of bones, nerves and veins, osmotically gorged
An abhorrent creation, by medical science forged
Corpulent meat, a shambling mess
Birthed in a test tube
Slathered on top with green jelly
For passing as food

[solo: "The Obesity Epidemic" - S.C. McGrath]

Suckling agar in a petri dish
G.M.O. fÂtus
Oils are polyunsaturated
Man-made to nourish
Genetic recombination
The meal is now us
Guts excised, limbs paralyzed
Gamma knife neurectomy: all gut, no glory
Sickly obese, brain wave ceased
Excoriating autonomy: all gut, no glory
Once a part of mankind
By doctors, redefined
The spine removed from the back
Now a craven haversack

[solo: "Eat Fast, Die Young, and Leave a Bloated Corpse" - J. Kocol]

Guts excised, limbs paralyzed
Gamma knife neurectomy: all gut, no glory
Sickly obese, brain wave ceased
Excoriating autonomy: all gut, no glory
Gross protuberance
No time for foods masticated
Bio-tech fed with fluids
Frankenfood we have created
Eat! Barf!
Oleaginous being mired in diaphoresis
Left to linger, adipose, suffering in weakness
With genes from yourself and with a few from the zoo
The dish best served cold is you
