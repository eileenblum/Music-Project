[music - Jason Kocol, lyrics - Ross Sewage]

From an abortive intifada
Combatants are persona non grata
Locked into dank isolation
Sequestered from the population
Made to repose in fÃ¦ces
Excised from the human species
Walloped and left with hematomata
Disfiguring dermal substrata
Ministry of Love
Asylum of beauty
Fulfilling orders
A torture of duty
Your pain, my medical expertise
Fractured ribs make you wheeze
Calcitrating your abdomen
Beneath my boot, forever pinned
Smashing a sole into your wounds
With micturition, your head is festooned
Genital burns from phosphoric acid
Sizzling glans is permanently flaccid
A metal baton, you will now find
Securely fastened where the sun doesn't shine
Attached to the nipples, electric clamps
Two hundred volts make you crap your pants
In Camp X-Ray
A depraved deputy
Two years hate
A torture of duty
Elbow torquing
Water boarding
Positions stressed
Lago confess
Sanctioned pain from the state will persist
For enemy combatants who don't exist
Your pain, my medical expertise
Fractured ribs make you wheeze
Calcitrating your abdomen
Beneath my boot, forever pinned
