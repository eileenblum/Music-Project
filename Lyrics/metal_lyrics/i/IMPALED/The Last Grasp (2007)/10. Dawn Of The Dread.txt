[music - Jason Kocol, lyrics - Ross Sewage]

Mucous dripping from your rectum
Tears roll down your cheeks
Deviating your septum
Halitosis reeks
Organs will ensmultify
Out the maw will flow your sick
As rectal pain intensifies
"A sweeping viral pandemic!"
Tapping your spines, weak and resigned
Dawn of the dread
Imagineering a plague for fearing
Dawn of the dread
Hematomata dot your skin
Anal fissures crack and peel
Blood congealing from within
Parasites attack with zeal
Leaking pox and gruesome boils
Burning fever rips your brain
With excrement, pants are soiled
"Dementia drives you insane!"

[solo: "Universal Health Scare" - S.C. McGrath]

A neurosis from parti pris
Dawn of the dread
Misrepresent maladies present
Dawn of the dread

[solo: "The Sickness Assurance Industry" - J. Kocol]

Weeping pus from every pore
Pearly pyodermal clots
Unnamed sickness to abhor
"Hope is all for naught!"
Marshall power making you cower
Dawn of the dread
Prevaricate disease to create
Dawn of the dread
