[music - Sean McGrath, lyrics - Ross Sewage]

Gore
Offal issued forth is our
Repast
Effluvial froth causes a
Gasp
On this pitch, your roll is
Recast
Ending life as reeking gore
Gore
Orange agents make conflagrant
Rapture
Ensanguined steaming heaps, what
Grandeur
Osseal gas from comburent
Rongeur
Ensmulting piles of turgid gore
G.O.R.E.
Is a force that gives us meaning
G.O.R.E.
Is a force that leaves you screaming
Gunned down at the waist
Out comes human waste
Reaping a battery
Exploding batteries
Gristle for the cannon
Offered for our canon
Relinquish your arms
Employing our arms

[solo: "Debris All That You Can Be" - S.C. McGrath]

G.O.R.E.
G.O.R.E.
Is a force that gives us meaning
G.O.R.E.
Is a force that leaves you screaming
