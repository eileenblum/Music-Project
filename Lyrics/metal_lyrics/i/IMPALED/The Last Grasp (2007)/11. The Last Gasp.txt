[music - Sean McGrath, lyrics - Ross Sewage]

You are the chosen ones
Dubious honor to endure
Castigate your beggared homes
As filthy and unpure
Gorged on dihydrogen-oxide
To depollute
Your domiciles are sanctified
No longer dissolute
Awash in discharged fluids
Their lungs are now imbued
Succumbing to the big drink
A poly-chemical stew
Tongues are soaked in oil
Bowels evacuating gore
The future of this ghetto ward
On Davy Jones's floor
Gale waves unleashed
From the levee that we blew
We did it all years before
Back four-score minus two
Drown the poor like rats
With our tÃ¦niafuge
This is the final gasp
Give heed to the great deluge

[solo: "Unchained Malady" - S.C. McGrath]
[solo: "Killing You Swiftly" - Jason Kocol]

Corpses swell to burst
Drenched down to the bone
Survivors left to rot
On rooftops all alone
Atrophying in the sun
They'll expire and putrefy
Then destiny is manifest
Our spoils are purified
