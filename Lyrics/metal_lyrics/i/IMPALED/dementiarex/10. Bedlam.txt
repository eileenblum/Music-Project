[music - Ross Sewage and Sean McGrath, lyrics - Ross Sewage]

Vested in dementopia, government by lunatic
Vestiges of hysteria in a legal system so sick
A sovereign sanatorium, the policy of rule is insane
Where moral restraints are overrun, Dementia Rex is to blame
An ataxic coup is growing nascent
Amok motivations are ingravescent
Doctors deposed and jugulated in our white house of padded cages
Our politico self-mandated, but psychosis will increase in stages
Lacking the nourishment of maternity, we deemed ourselves brothers
But found no solace in fraternity as the mad drew blood from each other
Mansuete masses, the first to expire
In a congerie of faeces, a visage is mired
De-calcified ossuaries to break
Waifen, flesh bags left cold and prostrate
Dominance asserted with fisticuffs
With shattered dentine, a countenance is stuffed
Indoctrinated to pugilist acts
A riot of two thousand maniacs
The guts strewn from patulous torsos
Our corpus juris in its final death throes
Stewardship, icarian
From unrestrained sadism
A society undone
It's a bloody bedlam
Our hamartia's spun
When scum is killing scum
Thirsting for carrion
It's a fucking bedlam

[solo: "The Road to Hellville" by S. C. McGrath]

No hope for mad minds, no hope for mankind
Decerebration will clear their heads
Total diaschisis will leave them for dead
A masochistic population makes an abbatoir of the asylum
No control over desquamation, Dementia Rex a panjandrum
Suffering echopraxia as our late doctors' butchery is imitated
Internecine bouts prove dour as my kingdom is extirpated
A charnel house where bloodlust doth reign
Extremities snapped and craniums brained
A gallimaufry of prone brethren
Organs excised and ordure placed therein
From a praetorian psyches devolution
An arterial spray, the fruits of revolution
With grumous gore, the halls are replete
As cardial pulses surcease their beats
Stewardship, icarian
From unrestrained sadism
A society undone
It's a bloody bedlam
Our hamartia's spun
When scum is killing scum
Thirsting for carrion
It's a fucking bedlam
