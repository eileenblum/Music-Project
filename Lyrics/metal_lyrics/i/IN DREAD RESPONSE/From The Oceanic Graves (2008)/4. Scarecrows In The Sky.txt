Scarecrows in the sky!
Spluttering decay through the firmament
Broken winged swans melt to meet painful horizons
As they cry

Wildly leaping down the bleeding mountain
Tormented by the grey ghost of explosions
Becoming one with the furnace of war...

...firing fatal rounds into the buildings
Black angels swooping in and around the city
And dancing with the war

Constructing a bleak kingdom of corpses
Perching to drink from the skull of innocence
Dim lights stray

And cast creeping light around the shadows

The scythes of justice have been crippled
From scraping at the walls of a bombshell waiting
To be ignited

Embers shimmer through th'infernal chasm
Tormented by the grey ghost of explosions
And dancing with the war

Firing fatal rounds into the buildings
Black angels swooping in and around the city
And dancing with the war

...and with the flesh's eyes I saw the divine
Beyond mysterious worlds, witnessing all atrocity
With no terror in its inward glancing eyes
Clotted blood from a spilt cup of bitterness
Has been ignored

Growing, until they reach the sky
Billows of smoke clawing at the stars
I saw the moon as a tyrant
Peering down with mocking distant light
A fearful glowing, from the limbs of victims

Seizuring pyres of troops in ashes
Quivering human refuse in the wind
Still they ride
Upon mechanical murder machines
Sailing over skeletal seas
Only to fight fire...
With blood!
