Vehicles soar on the horizon
The light of a thousand lamps on motorways

Colossal empty storehouses, echoing the sound of engines
Past twilight we see the transformation
Shadows becoming serenity, with dim neon lights flaring
Signals for mechanical empires to arise

Cold grey walls moan and resonate in steel strongholds
Unheard voices shriek through the eeriness
In a distorted mist of confusion

Residents hear in their sleep,
The silent approach of decay
Responding in nightmares and blackest visions
The darkness of our future days

I caught sight of my reflection,
In a gutter filled with oil
Dilated eyes and pallid flesh

When the fruit of the earth is soured
And the land has spat its venom back at us
And the veins of the world have collapsed

You'll find me attached by cables
Hissing and spitting to an audience of crude
Orbiting in life unknown
Circling in unanimated paleness
As moths to a flickering lantern
Like failed broken satellites

Unheard voices shriek through the eeriness
In a distorted mist of confusion

A dismal sound between every building erupts
Through a hollow concrete sanctuary
Playing disorderly tunes, to clockwork hearts
Failed satellites, trapped in wires, waves,
Towering street signs

And we will never take the exit.

Clones climb the walls
Of an abandoned factory
In search of nothing...

And we will never take the exit.

Orbiting in life unknown
Circling in unanimated paleness
As moths to a flickering lantern
Like failed broken satellites

And we will never take the exit
