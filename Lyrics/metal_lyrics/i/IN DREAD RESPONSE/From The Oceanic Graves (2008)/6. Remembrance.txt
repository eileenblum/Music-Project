Haunted shores beckon me
To an unknown destiny
Force guilt with no sympathy
Though some have carried mountains

Mute these words, in this venomous world
Golden tongues - diamonds ground to dust
Fading lights glowing.. in murky waters, drowning

Hesitant warning signs
Sickening cold at sunrise
Heart became mechanism
Life's grip has lost adhesion, still we-

Mute these words, in this venomous world
Golden tongues - diamonds ground to dust
Fading lights glowing.. in murky waters, drowning
Momentary vow of silence, this hidden monologue
I'll take beyond the grave

So many who play hero, never notice the martyr
The sun sets with so many left behind

Through devastated eyes (broken mirrors)
Trapdoors to emptiness sealed shut (we hope)
Sixteen candles burning so pale
And now we're all breathing with you

Mute these words, in this venomous world
Golden tongues - diamonds ground to dust

However freedom has been lost
The void has spared one more captive...
(a fleet of souls in the thickening fog)

Momentary vow of silence...
This hidden monologue...
I'll take beyond the grave...

Silent explosions in dark serenity
Passing through corridors of dead kids
Hopeless scenes that stain remembrance
Hopeless scenes that stain remembrance
And now...
We're all breathing with you.
