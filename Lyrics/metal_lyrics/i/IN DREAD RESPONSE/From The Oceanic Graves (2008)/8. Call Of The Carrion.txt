Fatigue embraces me
Amidst these mighty oaks
Visions of escaping my flesh
And soaring to another realm comforts

All fear begins to take its leave
A raven choir in boughs above
Shriek dirges and deathlike hymns
In a broken discordant chant

Deciduous trees shed their leaves
On the forest floor beside me
Golden autumn in the shade of broken canopies
'neath the pale sunlight
Crows flock and gather
Ignored, obscured and surreal
To hunt among the brambles

Falling twilight and the dusk sets in
Eyes closing never to wake
At the call of the carrion crow
In howls of pleasant whispers

To leave this wretched body
And its marred flesh
To soar beyond the mountainous plains
Surrendering to the glow of the amber skies
Though I drown in Charon's wake

The beckoning winds unfold their invitation
As twilight draws its deep curtain
I disappear into the dusk of mine
To join with the choirs of Asphodel
And become bewitched by the sylph
Drunk on the nectar of Ambrosia
At the edge of the light

I can taste the dew
Of Heavenshores
Shimmering in the air
Of the Elysian Sanctum

Yet the vines of deliverance
Wrapped around my limbs
Drag me to colourless waters
In the silent courts
Of moths...
Of dust...
