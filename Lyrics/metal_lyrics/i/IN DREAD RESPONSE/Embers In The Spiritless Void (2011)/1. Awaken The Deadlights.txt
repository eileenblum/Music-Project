Set the captives free
let them walk along the brightest highway
without fear of being ensnared
keep the rivers of light flowing

Screams from beneath the arid plains
a desert of souls in decay
dwelling below this parched landscape
you'll find me;

Armed with a flaming sword
awakening the Deadlights
rising with the Morning Star
for I have become the War

The ghosts beneath our feet retract
a release from the darkness cometh!
Like an all consuming fire
hunting its elusive prey

Arm the flaming swords;
Awaken the Deadlights

Rise, Morning Star!
For We have become the War

Arm the flaming swords;
Awaken the Deadlights
