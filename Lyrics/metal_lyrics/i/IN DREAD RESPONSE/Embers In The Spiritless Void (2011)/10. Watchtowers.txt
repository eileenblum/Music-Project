Mis-shapen forms malign the horizon
congregate; the hapless orphans of the soul
crippled by silence yet woven together
parading in the shadow of fear

Standing in the halls of degeneration
walls and marbled arches recapturing
artifacts of our decrepit civilisation
antiquated barracks in a funeral world

The Watchtowers are documenting our downfall
making sure every move is archived
there's no motive to interrupt the power struggle
apathetic ones who wait the course of time

Chased around the streets
caught in the crossfire
targeted by hostiles
waiting behind the stones...

On the ground evading the helicopters
flying through the fog of our burning skin
arterial blood in the mortar
human suffering linked to the monarchs throne

Broken transmissions glitch
through tumultuous wet-wired abyss
failed broadcasts of voiceless breath
trailing after distant flares
pilot lights are the radar eyes
hovering above the junkyard automatons
raging through the dismal emptiness
cavorting in a state of disrepair

We've been chased around the streets
caught in the crossfire
targeted by hostiles
waiting behind the stones...

In a stronghold of iron and steel
leering atop the cliffs
industrial angels with ashen halos
peer into a void of life's emptied orifice

Dreams into dust
surrounded by cold towers
firelight in window eyes
pierce into my body

Breaching the borders of abandoned cities
occupying deadzones and expanding ground zero
poised to create our own imprisonment
though fires still burn in the window's eye...

Futile is the fight of a forgotten ideal

A feast upon static beneath the commotion
deafened by revolving white noise loquacity
reported to an empire of erratic execution
discarded in chambers beyond clandestine gates

Chased around the streets
caught in the crossfire
targeted by hostiles
waiting behind the stones...

In a stronghold of iron and steel
leering atop the cliffs
industrial angels with ashen halos
peer into a void of life's emptied orifice
