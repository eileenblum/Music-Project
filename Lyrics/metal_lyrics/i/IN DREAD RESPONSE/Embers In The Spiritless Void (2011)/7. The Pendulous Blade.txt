The charcoal haze at 3 a.m
and the humming of cities in sleep
distant sirens as violins
cavort with the harps of the sea

Figures drift past broken windows
framed pictures stare in painless disfigurement
freedom's breeze howling past in mockery
here, reaching beyond reflections,
into eroded essence; this reticent departure!

The cruelest waves of white noise
obstruct what is out of reach
bells in the fog, the fog of static
lament in disharmony...

I am the phantom of this cold tower
trafficking sentience through black hallways
speaking to angels caressing the forgotten
forever evading the pendulous blade
