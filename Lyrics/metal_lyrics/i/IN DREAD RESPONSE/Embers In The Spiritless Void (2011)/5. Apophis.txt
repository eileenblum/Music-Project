Skydragons 'neath mooncrescent trails through thermosphere
Sanguine threads of the universe, presents auroral blaze
striking blades of piercing light
through dismal greys of ash and fog
distant Andromeda retracts on star and wave
burst into aether lumeniferous decline
Iapetus blinks a pending extinction
as light and dark sides oscillate
Fomalhaut, our guiding star
flickering upon its wand'ring lead...

[APOPHIS:]
Fires storm the moon...
as Luna leaves her orbit
and slips into the grey...
the great dead distance

For the light that now reaches us has long been extinguished
as the universe is gasping, and fading
the cold, emptied, shelled frameworks of the nebulous orbs
gliding like smoldering embers in the spiritless void
all that is left is the ghostly echoing dirges
of failed stars
carried in the dust from cosmic winds
to our deaf sphere hanging in the heavens; effaced
flickering upon its wand'ring lead...

[APOPHIS:]
Fires storm the moon...
as Luna leaves her orbit
and slips into the grey...
the great dead distance

[TOUTATIS:]
I Have Come From The Stars,
and to the Stars I Shall Return
