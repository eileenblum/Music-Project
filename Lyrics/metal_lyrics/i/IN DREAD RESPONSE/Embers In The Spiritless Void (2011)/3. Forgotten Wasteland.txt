Re-igniting the flames of the past, as my eyesight is darkening
such a beautiful life, is it not? A burden I never chose to bear...
hear the echoing drone of the dull, as my eyesight is darkening,
winter birds throw themselves from the sky,
autumn leaves stacked like graves just unearthed,
waiting for a new life to be birthed, such a beautiful world, is it not?
Vines hanging from forest canopies, descending like nooses from the trees..
like nooses from the trees, an adoration
only one escape is not to breathe,

only one way trains leave from this station,
and the dead they may sing
sing with elation,

...gaining such little warmth from the sun,
as it dimly reflects from the moon,
in the fear of complete solitude,
in the fear of a life isolated,
someone's sweet caress never to come
gaining such little warmth from the sun...

With every friendship, there's another foe
With every tombstone, there's another birth
In every dewfall, there's another cold
In every daybreak, I'm getting so old,

so old and the night descends like another nail
into the casket, waiting in a forgotten wasteland.

Never to be found.
