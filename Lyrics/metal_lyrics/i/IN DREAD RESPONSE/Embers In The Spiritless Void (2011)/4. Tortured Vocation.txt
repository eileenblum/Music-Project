The dark and restless mills procreate
Cauldrons manufacture latent chemiclouds, in the doldrums
To create a noxious membrane, for the leaden athmosphere to swell
A veil of ashen wings obscures the ghost of the sun

At the hand of malediction
Forged by hosts, intent on extinction...

The battledrum of oiltanks resounds through armouries
In secluded depths of a stagnating sea

A tortured vacation
Through corroded framework
Staring through spiderwebs of napalm aflame
Scarab munitions in felled pylon forests
Clambering beneath the rootwork of bane,

Venomous hosts parade, in conflagration
Below the septic stratosphere,
That chokes the dead starless sky...

Mercurion termites erupt from chromesoil
Ravaging a land in plague
From the infertile dungeons to the wasteland above
scavenging the wold endlessly
Acerbic aphids rain upon the scorched city
(We are the) mis-shapen miscreants collapsed
At the Great Altar Of Decay...

A cavernous haunt, dried up as the lakes
As ionization towers stir the clouds
With fervent wings of corrosive fate

A hail of digital sparks, racing through blinding passageways
Upon the winds of incendiarism, rideth a carriage of abrasive pains
