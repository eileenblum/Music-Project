Sword aflame!

In the caves I'll be dwelling, dreading the light
the ravens will feed me, the river will bring me might

In the Kerith Ravine that lies to the east
when the well becomes dust and a dry fallen leaf

A diet of sticks brought from dying widows
as an insect army writhing in its death throes
To the house that fell ill but revived its Son:
may the clouds radiant bring their rain...

Beneath the caverns of phosphorescence
in the streams of black inferno
lurk the disfigured cadaverous ones
in the fathomless depths of the bleak

Sharing love and lament
flaunting gifts on death row

I'll commune with those bored of existence
assigned and commissioned to the Highest Order of Black Holes
The Order of Black Holes

When chaos comes to claim its offspring
I'll arm the flaming swords!

So chaos, come forth and claim your children...

CHAOS COME AND CLAIM YOUR CHILDREN
