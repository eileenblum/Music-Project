In the night I spoke your name in a whisper
you replied with a thundering animosity
it was so intense I couldn't hear...
will you please come again

Ears rupturing at the message
such a heavy blessing, it almost cursed

My blood expelled from my weakening veins
will you accept my hollow shell,
attacked by the inane.

Never wanted to match your splendor
a thought so unfathomable,
laughter and tears in the same motion
this jester has left your courts
for a short while, proved to be far too long
Will you accept my hollow shell
attacked by the inane
rotten scowls of impiety
virtue taken as hoax
cackling beneath the shelter of disguise
so deadly....

Trickery through false emotion,
witchcraft by flattery
lights are dimmed, and candles they burn...

This spark will fade in the end..
This spark is fading...

Haze...wax like tears
pools of paraffin reflecting a dying light

teasing the darkness to conquer.
