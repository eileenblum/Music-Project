See us stand mesmerised? No!
Orange limbs on parade soaked in red light
In the court of Cain's disciples
backs adorned with golden knives

I see them dancing with the dead,
forcing smiles and covering flesh with paint

Yes! They rot!
Yes, they are decomposing!

Let the sewers open
the gaping mouth of great seduction

Sorry, I ain't that victim!
You nameless slaves to hedonism;
You're cowering in your dreams
as you drown in your own liquids

Feather boas on dressed up snakes
piercing hearts with a poisoned stake
glitters fly into the nightsky
brown noses lined with white
narrated by ten thousand lights...
and endless shrieks through the night

Toxaemia inbuilt
to erroneous bloodlines.

The energies in my mind are frothing chemicals, septic slime!
Sketching out amidst the invisible torturers that fly
upon the fossilised air
constructed in the terminal lairs...

The Sewersaints are preaching virulent destinies
in Refuse Cloisters echoing venereal prophecy

Dystopian terrains,
masked with decadent sounds
lurking in silence are
the nanotech feeding grounds!

Sorry, I ain't that victim!
You nameless slaves to hedonism;
You're cowering in your dreams
as you drown in your own liquids

Reports through tormented wires
to the terrible squadrons
motorized to terminate
an expendable mass with
no spirit left to fight

Surplus denizens, exceeding capacity
spiritless disciples of maniacal machinery

Through our weaknesses the conscience is seared
to a world unfolding lunatic nightmares
