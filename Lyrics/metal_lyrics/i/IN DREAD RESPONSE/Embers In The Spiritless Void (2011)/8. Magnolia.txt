I held the keys, I saw the lock,
Had every chance to throw open the gates
You'd let me in,
You'd let us in
the hopes and visions in the mist
and youthful dreams were inbetween
the slipping grip of a shaken angels hands

The temple of disaster held
a grievance never aired

We thought you saw the full moon,
but all you saw was the crescent,
every precious plan and mission
cast to sacred ascent

Behind the veil of opalescence
was a setting sun
Below the gleam of morning gold
the pools of ebony grew

How I sought oracle of the heavy dews
to return you with every Arch Of Rain...
only to grasp the light again

Until our colours fade
may the sky be stained and the wind scream out your name
in your comet's trail

the clarity of memory
ghostdancing in the fields of fall
Lights; blinding radiant
a silhouette in graceful glow

Resonating rays of summer gold
yell from mountains to ravines
above the frozen heights to lakes in wait
now maybe we'll see, beyond...
Mortality, in a kingdom,
More vast than the cosmos

How I sought oracle of the heavy dews
to return you with every Arch Of Rain...
only to grasp the light again

Even faded sparks
can light a thousand hearts

Until our colours fade
may the sky be stained and the wind scream out your name
in your comet's trail
(to grasp the light again)

When you crashed to emptiness
all the starry eyes you left in the eclipse
for one who burned so pale

Reaching the arch of rain
grasping the light again
