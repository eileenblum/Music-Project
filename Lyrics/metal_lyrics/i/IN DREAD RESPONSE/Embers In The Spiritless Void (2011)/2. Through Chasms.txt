As armoured serpents prowl
leeching from the vulnerable ones
through subterrannean paths
in the kingdom of sewers

The venomous hosts parade
displaying a smorgasbord of illnesses
skeletons beneath dust piles rejuvenate

On their breath: the waste of moths
blood spiralling in retrograde,
into collapsed veins
what have I awoken, what have I invoked?

GLEAMT THE MANIC MONSTER
SHINING THROUGH BLOODSTONE FISSURES
HEAR THE JACKALS GATHER
HOWLING THEIR BLOODSOAKED VISIONS

Pernicious thoughts ravage my mind,
how soon before it takes action?
While murderous waves flood my sight...
the velvet shroud descends...

Less than refuse
addicted, I can't stop breathing in your sweet suffering
smearing bitterness across your skin
the embodiment of refusal

Dancing backwards in the waiting room
embrace the reversal of joyfulness
clambering through chasms of distended despair
the velvet shroud descends...

I can't control what reigns me,
I am the snake inside me!

Obscene as cancer, upon innocent tongues.

A phantom presence is always on haunt
to get its claws upon my flesh and bone

Monstrous and merciless the vulture may strike
When the dusk of the soul pulls me deeper in the night

I can't control what reigns me,
I am the snake inside me!

Convicted, or condemned?
the velvet shroud descends...
