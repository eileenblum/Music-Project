True empyreal terror
On jagged precipice, bearer of truths befouled
Do with me as thou will

With bloodied feet and breaking spirit, I plunge
Segregation and separation
Boundless, shapeless and fluid
Truths split beneath the gnashing of billions

Bleeding through six chambers of realisation
Swallowed by esophageal legion
Digested, inch by putrid inch
The reddened iris blends and molds
Acidic rebirth in the horror eternal
Enlightened and defleshed, sickness takes hold

Madness claws throughout the descent
The depths of dread, the foulest scent
These ragged lungs collapse
Temporal weight
Masticated and ablated, exposed

Rabid yet mesmerized, drowning inside
Gentle heart erodes, raw nerve exposed

Passed but forever grieved
Refuse of a world unleashed
Wisdom of violence ingrained, dead inside
Cancerous, but alive
