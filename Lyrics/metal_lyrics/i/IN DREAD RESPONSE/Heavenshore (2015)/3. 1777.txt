Buried in tattered cloth and sodden wool
Normalise the dulling ache and anxious pull
With muzzle flash, we killed the iron lung
We severed all, through stillest tongue

Falling further, ever further
In deepest recess, you reside
Greying memories red and butchered
Annulled within my mind
Nostalgic poison washes through
Tsumani buries all we held inside
Iâve lost so much and said so little
The puzzle pieces lost beneath the tide

In a flash of fire, the red did kiss the green
The deadened limbs still heavy, from a fading dream
A ghostly shadow in the periphery, the void that once depressed
That once repressed

A pound of flesh upon the scales
Noxious, rotten, undone
But its you who now bares the scars
Eclipsed by the man that I have become

Your loss, immeasurable
Immemorial
