And when the last fruit has spoilt
I will lay with naked grief and sober flame
Alone among the stars, Iâll hang and burn
Under godless moon, I will immolate

A flaming effigy to self destruction
A monument to fuck you too

The wretched roots take hold in pure defeat
As filthy noose pulls taut and true
Branches creak and the flesh does scream
Of every wrong Iâve been put through
Through bone and ash, Iâll come true

A flaming effigy to self destruction
A monument to fuck you too
An apologetic gesture of unweighted sorrow
A futile prayer I canât undo

Affirmations smoulder in the light
Embers of indecision glow inside
Through collapsing hopes, internalised
Feeling every motion, dead inside

Unwritten words Iâve yet to pen
From aching hands that long for an end
These earthen bonds were bound to break
By setting light to moulding chapters of pure love and hate
I lost myself some time ago
Unsure Iâll ever make it home
