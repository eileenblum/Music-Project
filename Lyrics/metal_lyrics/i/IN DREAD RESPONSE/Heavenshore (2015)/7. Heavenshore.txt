As my heart does break
Upon the heavenshore
The wretched twine that binds these wrists
To leave their mark upon the flesh
Nevermore

Solace, imprinted by my bones
Sorrow, forever coming home

The sun will rise upon the frozen heart
Coagulated ice floes begin to drift apart
Cut away the septic flesh
The malignancy of the soul bereft

Lungs that burn with winter fire
Shedding scars of self inflicted wound
First breath upon the broken surface
As rippled truths do bend the moon
