Shat into existence, cursed seed beneath the sun
Placed upon a sinking path, grieved and set upon
And as we grow together, I begin to carve my rites
Of solitary inching through cyclopean might

A world unbridled in it's horror
In this doomed nativity

Roots take hold in soil steeped in darkest disappointment
Pushing, ever pushing 'neath decaying green and innocence
Stunted growth by broken promise
Friendship grieved by judas kiss
A blade in twisted hand
To cut through gordian heart

A world unbridled in it's horror
In this doomed nativity
Sacrificial son so fragile
Of melancholic proclivity

Beneath the rising sun, the blossoms fade to brown
Brute forced down choiceless path, the dreams are hammered down
Face first to gravelled soil, scars nailed into the ground

Tainted memory, the proof creeping beneath the earth
The seed of sorrow imprint, internalise what has been learnt
Lessons immemorial, of hollow virtue and the hurt
The powder keg is planted, the fuse now set to burn
