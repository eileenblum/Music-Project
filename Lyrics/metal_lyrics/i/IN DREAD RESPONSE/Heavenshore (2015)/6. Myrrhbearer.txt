In languages never spoken, we speak
Acrimonic fire breathed upon the world
To burn the bastion of abhorrence
Coiled indignation begins to unfurl

In death of purpose and loss of sight
In life, aimless, borne of blight
Beneath the earth we writhe, in wait
Bound by worthless vision and illest fate
With granite wall and pitch of black
Fragments of purest love held back
Pupils wide in darkest hour
Amid foul air, rotting and sour

The dormant nerves begin to feel
The terror and torment once concealed
Synapses fire and spark the birth
Latent regard slowly unearthed
Crossroaded virtues blur and bend
Begotten chance to make amends
Worn hearts by savagery, beset
To forgive but to never forget

Set ablaze
I am reborn anew
I am reborn
