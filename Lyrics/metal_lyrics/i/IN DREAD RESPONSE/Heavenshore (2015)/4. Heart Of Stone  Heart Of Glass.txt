The abyssal void between the lungs remembers all

Lash by lash, skin starts to separate
The forked tongue sneers begin to chip away
Collapsing walls constructed by clenching fists
Scar tissue tells corrosive tales like bloodied hieroglyphs

The Judas whispers echo each and every night
The bones that fuse and break beneath the hallowed light
A whipping boy malformed, both wretched and alone
The heart of glass that breaks reveals a heart of stone

The leather cracks and pens another tome
Another chapter of sordid suffering and gloom
Formations skew the etchings, the shaking hands of scribes
Who pray for inked quills to turn to bloodied knives

The day has dawned when tables turned are set ablaze
A nail through every wrist that struck upon the trembling brave
Upon the cross of impenitence, the fallen lords shall bleed
A monument to the burning shame, writhing in the meek
