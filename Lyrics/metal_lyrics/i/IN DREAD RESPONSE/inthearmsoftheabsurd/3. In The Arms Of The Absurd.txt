there were vultures preying on the dead nameless
calling from beyond the fathomless depths
a sea engulfing tranquility, unquiet
serpents glow through benighted murkiness
and we're plowing through pillars of submerging forests
beneath a rotting cloak of perished mosses
like an embryo birthed to a pale lifeless form
the vessels are wrecked by a noxious anthem
tunnels and lights concealed in gloom
a somber sunrise drowns in apathy
the passage opens to serene termination

Where are the days of rainbows?
Hand me this wine of communion to forget
Times of happiness? Oh the hours of emptiness

...so cunning are the waves of comfort
only to be thrown onto a shallow bay
this vessel is wrecked.

and we fell through a nonchalant haze of grey
the dying sun no longer sends its rays
below the canopy of the ancients
beneath the tiers of a thousand years
where the light has been absent for centuries
from under the soil
giant caverns extend for miles
in the beautiful abyss
walled in by black roots
of decaying shipwrecks
a subterranean lake glistens
and when will it ask for my breath?

Where are the days of rainbows?
Hand me this wine of communion to forget
Times of happiness? Oh the hours of emptiness

(in the arms of the absurd)
so cunning are the waves of comfort
only to be thrown onto a shallow bay
this vessel is wrecked.
