The fading light is burying the portrait I dreamt of you
as the dusk sets in my vision fails
the dreaded wings of night descend and everything is paled
by the beauty of your passing
moonlight spatters across the horizon so carelessly
the rusted chain of daylight snaps
and it plummets into an endless oblivion...

Giant clocks throw themselves off the towers
since when was time a great healer?
Memories resurface in dying moments
reflecting a frozen stare (so dull... your vision)
tranquility in anguish
the mirror blackens my face

voices are wearing thin
and thoughts are glazing over

...Afraid to conquer these passions
a grey well of sodden wishes...

...Afraid to conquer these passions
a grey well of sodden wishes...

Descend, Fire
My vision's failed...

(...seared...)
