New life's awakened
Where thousands were lost,
Hoping to last for long.

We run through places
Where legends are born.
Our quest wasn't foretold.

Now the power of metal
Brings us to eternity.

Forever shining, brighter than lightning
And striking like thunder and rain.
Unveiling knowings and sacred drawings,
United by metal, we're reaching eternity.

All ancient doors shall now remain closed.
Fires will fill the dome.

We are enthralled as we step in the halls.
These flames enlight the world.

Now the power of metal
Brings us to eternity.

Forever shining, brighter than lightning
And striking like thunder and rain.
Unveiling knowings and sacred drawings,
United by metal, we're reaching eternity.

[Solo]

[Chorus 2x]
