Forces are scattering the stars,
Reflecting flashes of new realities;
And tracing whirlpools in the sand,
As symbols for the world to see.

The day when all mankind
Will believe in a new horizon;
If they listen to the voice,
The prophecies will unfold.

[Solo]

What if the world falls apart
And nothing looks like it always has?
Then, there's still a chance;
The voice leaves echoes in the wind.

The day when all mankind
Will believe in a new horizon;
If they listen to the voice,
The prophecies will unfold.

The day when all mankind
Will believe in a new horizon;
If they listen to the voice,
The prophecies will unfold.
