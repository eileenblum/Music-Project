Visions and dreams
Where shadows and creeds
Vanish in presence of marvelous powers.
What if these dreams turned into reality?

Forever standing strong,
Till the day I leave this world.

In this journey
Through land and sea,
Tonight I feel at home,
'Cause there is magic the eyes can't see
Spreading through my soul.

[Solo]

Legends are told
About cruel destinies
For those who are lost, who surrender and won't be free
In this land where blood with leach.

Forever standing strong,
Till the day I leave this world.

In this journey
Through land and sea,
Tonight I feel at home,
'Cause there is magic the eyes can't see
Spreading through my soul.

[Solo]

In this journey
Through land and sea,
Tonight I feel at home,
'Cause there is magic the eyes can't see
Spreading through my soul.

In this journey
Through land and sea,
Tonight I feel at home,
'Cause there is magic the eyes can't see
Resonating through my body and my soul.

In this journey
Through land and sea,
Tonight I feel at home,
'Cause there is magic the eyes can't see
Resonating through my body and my soul.
