One step ahead and you will see
What lies beyond your destiny:
The only life we chose to live.

And in the end, you'll all sleep,
Your souls fading in the mist.
You have one chance, then disappear.

We stand, we rise.
All our fears are gone.
Our passion will lead our way home.

Who'll join the list?
Who'll burn the bridge?
Who'll see them laying at our feet?
Tonight, vermin in the dark will feast.

And from the pit,
You'll hear screams.
The voices threatened us to leave,
But here we are and we will be.

We stand, we rise.
All our fears are gone.
Our passion will lead our way home.

[Solo]

We stand, we rise.
All our fears are gone.
Our passion will lead our way home.

We stand, we rise.
All our fears are gone.
Our passion will lead our way home.
