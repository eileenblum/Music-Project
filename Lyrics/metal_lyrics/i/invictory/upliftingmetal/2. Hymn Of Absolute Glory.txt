Every time
I chase my dreams,
I keep in mind
That metal is what makes me live.

Today, I find the power
To conquer all I've dreamed and more.
With attitude and courage,
I'll be a champion.

Metal made me brave.
I face enemies in my way.
But no crown, no sword
Will make me bow down again.

When I'm on a mission.
Failure's not envisioned.
I'll raise my voice charged with glory and might.
Free from all restrictions.
Seeing no opposition.
Today, metal enlightens my mind.

Even in the hardest times,
I will never lose the faith
In myself, and I will keep living
Like it's my last day.

Metal made me brave.
I face enemies in my way.
But no crown, no sword
Will make me bow down again.

When I'm on a mission.
Failure's not envisioned.
I'll raise my voice charged with glory and might.
Free from all restrictions.
Seeing no opposition.
Today, metal enlightens my mind.
