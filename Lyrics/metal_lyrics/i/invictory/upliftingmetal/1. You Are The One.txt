Going past that precious time
You see it all behind
Going further than the will of your mind.

The times have changed
But your sign remained.
It was carved in your soul that day.

You will learn
That the power contained
Is stronger than the faith.

You are the one,
The warrior in this ancient war,
The lightning in the sky.
You are the one,
The one that heads up high.

They can feel the smell
Of the fear under your skin
But face them now and show them you're the king.

Even if you're feeling low,
The might is in your soul.
Just reflect it into this world.

You will learn
That the power contained
Is stronger than the faith.

You are the one,
The warrior in this ancient war,
The lightning in the sky.
You are the one,
The one that heads up high.

[Solo]

You are the one,
The warrior in this ancient war,
The lightning in the sky.
You are the one,
The one that heads up high.

You are the one,
The warrior in this ancient war,
The lightning in the sky.
You are the one,
The one that heads up high.
