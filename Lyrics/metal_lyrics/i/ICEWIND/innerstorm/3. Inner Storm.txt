Winter's raging for evermore
Bitter wind blows at the end of time
Clear blue skies becoming gray
You pray

As the sun turns black at night
Angel's feathers fading away
Lightning crushes down your way
Afraid of what might come today

Aren't you sick of snow covered land?
And fiery wind that blows up your mind
Leave this place or you'll be left behind

You may die now or live forever
The decision is yours to take
The only thing you need is faith

Take my hand
Follow me into this land
Look into the ice
And meet your face again
Stop the screaming and start believing
Sky is shining, forever gleaming
Strength within you
Inner Storm leaving

As you look into the glass again
You see the stranger that you've become
The tears in your eyes show what you feel
You pray

Will the sun turn bright once more?
Will the fire burn inside?
Like in the old times before
When you were playing in the open door

The future's ahead, the past forgotten
Your image erased as you stand in the night
Do something now to recover your might

You may die now or live forever
The decision is yours to take
The only thing you need is faith

Take my hand
Follow me into this land
Look into the ice
And meet your face again
Stop the screaming and start believing
Sky is shining, forever gleaming
Strength within you
Inner Storm leaving

[Solo (acoustic) - Jay]
[Solo - Jay]

Take my hand
Follow me into this land
Look into the ice
And meet your face again
Stop the screaming and start believing
Sky is shining, forever gleaming
Strength within you
Inner Storm leaving
