Heaven is crying
Hell is now rising
Wait for my choice
It might be surprising
I'm still yearning
Can you hear my voice?

I shall wake up once again
I ride on to flame
Wishing you well or causing more pain
I am confused, there's no one to blame

Look slave is this your grave?
Try to run and you'll burn in a blaze
I lived too long
Remember where I belong?

My thoughts are escaping my mind
Pieces by pieces I'm becoming blind
Reason or treason, which will I follow
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

The beast is rising
I'm agonizing
I'm not gonna lose
No god will help me chose
I hear the whispers in my ears
My sanity disappears

I shall wake up once again
For Pride is my name
Raising hell or wishing for rain
I am confused, there's no one to blame

To no grave I will be no slave
What you see in my eyes is my gaze
I lived too long
Remember where I belong?

My thoughts are escaping my mind
Pieces by pieces I'm becoming blind
Reason or treason, which will I follow
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

[Solos : Jay - Vinni - Jay]

My thoughts are now there, clear to find
Pieces by pieces inside my mind
Reason or treason, which will I follow
Now I know, now I know, now I know

I shall wake up once again
For Pride is my name
Raising hell or wishing for rain
I am confused, there's no one to blame

To no grave I will be no slave
What you see in my eyes is my gaze
I lived too long
I now know where I belong!
