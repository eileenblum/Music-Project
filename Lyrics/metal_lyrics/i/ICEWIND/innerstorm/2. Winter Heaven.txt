At the misty gates of heaven
I stand forever wondering
What's beyond?
The legend tells of a long passage
But I imagine a snowy plain
What's beyond?

As I will cross the glimmering line
On the other side there might be
A white angel in the golden light
With opened arms in the field of light
Waiting for me! Waiting for me!

Glorious whispers of angels
I hear you calling me
Through thy Eternal Gate

The truth opens in front of me
As I step into the unknown
What's to find?
The mystic path revealed in my eyes
I sadly know what's not to ask
What's to find?

[Solos : Vinni - Jay - Vinni]

As I cross the glimmering line
On the other side there is
A white angel in the golden light
With opened arms in the field of life
Guiding me! Guiding me!

Glorious whispers of angels
I hear you calling me
Through thy Eternal Gate

As I have cross the glimmering line
On the other side there is
A white angel in the golden light
With opened arms in the field of light
Waiting for me! Waiting for me!

Glorious whispers of angels
I hear you calling me
Through thy Eternal Gate
