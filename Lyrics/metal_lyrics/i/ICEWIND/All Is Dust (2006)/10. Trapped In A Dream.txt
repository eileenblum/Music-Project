Blinded by fear
I advance through the night
Like a ghost in the fog,
Try to find my way
Never looking back
But forever seeking the day

Help me get out
It's always hunting me
Trapped in a dream
There has to be a way for me
For me to see
How I can achieve reality

I can no longer sleep
I could no longer rise
I am trapped in a dream
Even awake
No one hears my scream

Is this my last destination?
Is this my dreamland nation?
How can I live a dream
If I am not asleep?
Enlighten me I have to see
What is beyond this vision

[Chorus]

Will I forever sleep?
Will I no longer rise?
I am trapped in a dream
Even awake
No one hears my scream

[Solo: Jay / Vincent / Jay]

I can no longer sleep
I could no longer rise
I've been trapped in a dream
Even awake
No one hears my scream

[Chorus]
