At the misty gates of heaven
I stand forever wondering
What's beyond?
The legends tell of a long passage
But I imagine a snowy plain
What's beyond?

As I will cross the glimmering line
On the other side there might be
A white angel in the golden light
With opened arms in the field of life
Waiting for me! Waiting for me!

Glorious whispers of angels
I hear you calling me
Through the Eternal Gate

The truth opens in front of me
As I step in the unknown
What's to find?
The mystic path revealed in my eyes
I sadly know what's not to ask
What's to find?

[Solo: Vincent / Jay / Vincent]

As I cross the glimmering line
On the other side there is
A white angel in the golden light
With opened arms in the field of life
Guiding me! Guiding me!

[Chorus]

Glorious whispers of angels
You will be guiding me
Through the Eternal Gate
