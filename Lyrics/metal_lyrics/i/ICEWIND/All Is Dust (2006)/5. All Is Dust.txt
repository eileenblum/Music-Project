Many people die
The only thing real is pain
Wonders of the world no longer there
To take the blame, no one dare...
War is in vain!

Walking the path follow your way
From this wasteland remains decay
Roaring thunder, burning water
Fear inside and dust resides

Temple exploding while you pray
To make the war stop you will obey
Iron monster, falling feather
No one is waiting for that day

Fly away from this land
And you'll be free
Escape at last from death and misery
No more cries and no more lies
'Cause I will set you free
From all this dust!!!

Hearing gunshot, who's the prey
How can I know?
I'm dressed in grey
Dying father, crying mother
They are at war so this is the way

[Chorus]

[Solo: Vincent / Jay]

Gone away from the sand
And you will see
No more death nor even misery
No more cries and please don't die
'Cause I have set you free
But all is dust!!!
