The world is not what it used to be
There is no more time for us to see
What was destroyed was for us to keep
The trouble we're in now
Is way too deep
I can't imagine
What will be left for us

(Run) Run till the night
Outlast the light
As our world still lies in fear
(Hear) Hearing the call
Never wait for a fall
Because there is no other way

Every night and every day
You realize it feels the same
Whatever you do you feel the blame
And the burning of the flame
Religion, Blood and war
Is what you see
The hero of the day is yours to be

[Chorus]

[Solo: Vincent / Jay]

Falling higher than the sky itself
No way to be back on the shelf
But where ever you are
You feel stronger
As the candles burn
You know the wind will turn
It's not the end only a new beginning

[Chorus]
