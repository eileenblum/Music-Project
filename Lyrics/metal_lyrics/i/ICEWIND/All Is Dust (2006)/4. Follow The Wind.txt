Here we are a day like no other
The time has come for us to rise
Now it's time to show you the power
There's nothing in life
To make us forget our ways

Here comes the wing, prepare to see
We'll show them what we want to be
There's nowhere to run
And nowhere to hide
We'll ride for all eternity

Forget everything you heard before
Metal, the music we adore
Now it's the wind that leads the night
The weak in life won't live to fight

The walls on the path
Are crushed aside
Many tried to stop the tide
The sole result is a bigger storm
No one can change our ways

[Chorus]

[Solo: Vincent / Steve / Alex / Jay]

Follow the wind and you'll see
We're aiming for a better place to be
Forget all your fears
Erase all your tears
We'll ride for all eternity

We are the wind forever free
Free to be what we wanna be
Forget your fears
Erase your tears
The show goes on eternally
