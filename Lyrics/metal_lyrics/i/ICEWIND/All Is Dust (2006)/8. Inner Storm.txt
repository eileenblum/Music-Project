Winter's raging forevermore
Bitter wind blows at the end of time
Clear blue skies becoming gray
You pray
As the sun turns black at night
Angel's feathers fading away
Lightning crushes down your way
Afraid of what might come today
Aren't you sick of snow covered land?
And fiery wind
That blows your mind
Leave this place or
You'll be left behind
You may die now or live forever
The decision is yours to take
The only thing you need is faith

Take my hand
Follow me into this land
Look into the ice
And meet your face again
Stop the screaming and start believing
Sky is shining, forever gleaming
Strength within you
Inner Storm leaving

As you look into the glass again
You see the stranger
That you've become
The tears in your eyes
Show what you feel, you pray
Will the sun turn bright once more?
Will the fire burn inside?
Like in the old times before
When you were playing
In the open door
The future's ahead, the past forgotten
Your image erased
As you stand in the night
Do something now
To recover your might
You may die now or live forever
The decision is yours to take
The only thing you need is faith

[Chorus]
