[In Memory of those who were taken away]

The winter was cold and grey,
When you passed out that day
I remember as if it was today
But please don't you fear
Because soon we will be near
Close to me in here

Memories so long forgotten
But the soreness still resides
Inside my head, inside my heart
Like a river of blood in my vein
Flowing and driving me insane
I am feeling all the pain
All the pain pounding in my brain

Closer and closer from the light
I am!
But farther from you!
What's the matter? Why even bother?
Soon let's hope that we'll be together
Forever!

Don't know
Don't care
So long forgotten
But the soreness still resides
Inside my head, inside my heart
Like a river of blood in my vein
Flowing and driving me insane
I am feeling all the pain
All the pain pounding in my brain

Memories so long forgotten
But the soreness still resides
Inside my head, inside my heart
Like a river of blood in my vein
Flowing and driving me insane
I am feeling all the pain
All the pain pounding in my brain
