As a ray of light she appeared
Shining in my life, it was unreal
Impossible this love was,
From another world, she came to me

[Pre-Chorus:]
Our  eyes were filled with mystery
Living in a land of fantasy
The spell was on, I couldn't resist
Without her, can I exist?

[Chorus:]
Illusions of love decide my destiny
For passion blinds my senses
I am a slave to her grace
My heart in flames
This ain't the end of the story
This is my own tragedy

The dream was going on and on
Reality was left aside
The beauty to which I was drawn
Is now tearing my life apart

[Pre-Chorus:]
Our  eyes were filled with mystery
Living in a land of fantasy
The spell was on, I couldn't resist
Without her, can I exist?

The tempest in my mind
Shadowed my fate
I was forlorn
I cannot see the brilliance of the Sun

Free from the treacherous demons
Our love is stronger now
Than ever before
Than ever before

[Pre-Chorus:]
Our  eyes were filled with mystery
Living in a land of fantasy
The spell was on, I couldn't resist
Without her, can I exist?

[Chorus:]
Illusions of love decide my destiny
For passion blinds my senses
I am a slave to her grace
My heart in flames
This ain't the end of the story
This is my own tragedy

[Pre-Chorus x2,5:]
Our  eyes were filled with mystery
Living in a land of fantasy
The spell was on, I couldn't resist
Without her, can I exist?
