Life has been a burden to me through loss and defeat
And I had to wonder Â«Â Why should I go on?Â Â»
A strange desire came to me, enhanced my abilities
I thought I was human and now I'm a legend

[Chorus:]
Meet the spectre of the night
Born of the growing fright
Stronger than flesh and bone
Almighty avenger of the weak and torn
In the eyes of the fair, a new legend is born

Driven by a nemesis
I cannot take more of this senseless reality
My eternal rivalry
I can fight it, I can stop it
I must accept it for the rest of my days

[Chorus:]
Meet the spectre of the night
Born of the growing fright
Stronger than flesh and bone
Almighty avenger of the weak and torn
In the eyes of the fair, a new legend is born

(The) battle rages of this bloody night
The encounter, I have won again

Standing alone
Hidden from this world
Restless my eyes
So be it
I am the bearer, I am the guardian
They all rely on me

[Chorus:]
Meet the spectre of the night
Born of the growing fright
Stronger than flesh and bone
Almighty avenger of the weak and torn
In the eyes of the fair, a new legend is born again
