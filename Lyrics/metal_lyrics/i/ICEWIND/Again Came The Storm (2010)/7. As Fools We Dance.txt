A strange illness appeared today
Caught like fools like us along the way
Preachers chanted "Nothing to fear!"
Poor masses wanted to believe
A few of us would spread disease
So slowly crawling around with ease
Before no one could ever blink

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't believe my dear old friends
Those who want to free yourself
They want you to be their slave
And they shall send you to the grave

[Chorus]
Let the world change
Don't you see how' it's great
Worries of yesterday will finally vanish away

A foul cancer is taking ground
Bringing down and bound
Those infected just isolate
As relationships degenerate
(The) mind distorts reality
And they all lose their sanity
Before no one could ever blink

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't believe my dear old friends
Those who want to free yourself
They want you to be the slave
And they shall send you to the grave

[Chorus]
Let the world change
Don't you see how' it's great
Worries of yesterday will finally vanish away

As fools we dance!
