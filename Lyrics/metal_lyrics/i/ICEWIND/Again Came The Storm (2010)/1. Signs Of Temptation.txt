Enter my realm as I crawled into yours
You can never be free as long as I live
Joy and madness entwined by sorrow
Eternal pleasure until tomorrow.

Once I am in, there's no coming back,
In your blood, in your head, can you fell the attack?
Show me no mercy and shoot me the pain
Consume me to death as I'm going insane

[Chorus:]
It took your life
Forever own your soul
Now, free your mind
Leave this pain behind

I'll forgive me the deeds
I'll forgive you the fate
You gave me what you said
You would then took everything from me
Fake happiness and endless darkness
Day after day, I regret that we met
You may seek what you please
Torment me you will cease
When there are no more signs of temptation

[Chorus x2:]
It took your life
Forever own your soul
Now, free your mind
Leave this pain behind
