I watch the day sets, from the room I never leave
Chains and bullets around my sleeve
My hands are stained, I know
Each time I close my eyes,
Time is twisting, spinning in my head
I see the hammer knocking down

For I am sentenced to death

Here's the story, I murdered my wife
Misleadingly she was all my life
She plead me to do it now
With my hands around her neck
Our tears filled our eyes
But at last she was free

[Chorus]
Free from the pain
The soul flies forever strong
Our earthly grief matters no more
And we will be together, our love will prevail

Dispose of me as you will
My only concern now lies on the other side
Far from my heart
I stand and march for one last time
Forlorn and weak
Wait for me, I won't be long
Oh no I won't be long

Oh my love,
Ill fated from Nature's draw

Who could have believed
Such a brilliant girl could ever sink?
Her eyes empty, her smile long gone
Each day she's fade away to a livid stranger
Deep in my heart, I feel I've done the right thing
I could not bear seeing her living like this
What fair finale have we left today?
It seemed like the only way to leave

I plead them to do it now
With the rope around my neck
They had no tears in their eyes
But at last i am free

[Chorus]
Free from the pain
The soul flies forever strong
Our earthly grief matters no more
And we will be together, our love will prevail

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Free from the pain
The soul flies forever strong
Our earthly grief matters no more
And we will be together, our love will prevail
