Welcome to my surprise party
Sorry, I didn't send any notice
Oh but you should have had an hint
Soul is a dark and sinuous meander
(I'm) like a hidden monster that bites
Whoever dares to cross my path

I am god and I'm fed up with this world
And now it's time to put an end

[Chorus:]
So wrong this day which madness swept away
Though the stain won't go off
Your fallen angels will never be mourned enough

Wait, I didn't say I was done
(I'm) just reloading my gun
Must put my blood print in history before I leave
For a moment our eyes met
For a moment we shared pain
Taste my wrath and drink some of my hate

The reign of chaos starts and fear filling us all
Oh misery it's time to take our smiles away
The legacy itself has stopped before the Sun
One man's hatred will scar mankind today

I am lost and I am fed up with this world
I have kept one for me
(and now) it's time to put an end

[Chorus:]
So wrong this day which madness swept away
Though the stain won't go off
Your fallen angels will never be mourned enough
