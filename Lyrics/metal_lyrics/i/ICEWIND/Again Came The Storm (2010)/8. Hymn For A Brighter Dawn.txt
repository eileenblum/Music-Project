A fiery sky slowly fading
Fearful of what is coming
It drew its darkest curtain
To make us blind forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Turbulent skies wrecked us all
The gap created made us strong
Believe us, daylight will come
And we will fight until dawn

As we were gathered in darkness
Not knowing what to expect
Our wrath enabled us to break free
From this cage

[Chorus]
Bring down the walls of shame
And let the towers crumble in a righteous fall
"Future" is not a world alone, only useful in unity
Cross the ruins and sing
And sing along

As the empty Sun arises
We don't want no more
Of the dense shadows lurking
Severing us for too long
People gathered at dawn
To the edge of the cliff
Light overthrew the wall
Shining on the other shore
A Brighter Dawn is coming

The one that we fought for
A world for our philosophy
Freedom at last for all
New ruins have emerged
On which our clan will forge
Eternal daylight, we hope
Will last forevermore

Dust settling down on this land
The genesis has now begun
Grievous people take my hand
And we will walk forever on

[Pre-Chorus]
Turbulent skies wrecked us all
The gap created made us strong
Believe us, daylight will come
And we will fight until dawn

[Chorus]
Bring down the walls of shame
And let the towers crumble in a righteous fall
"Future" is not a world alone, only useful in unity
Cross the ruins and sing
And sing along
