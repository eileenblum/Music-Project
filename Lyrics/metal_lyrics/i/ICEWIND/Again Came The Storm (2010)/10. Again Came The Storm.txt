Dark clouds paid a visit to the sky today
Couldn't escape what is surely called "Nature"
Torn apart, crawling to reach our forgotten home
Shutting to the world, from the past
To the last haven

[Chorus]
What about faith? What about pride?
Is it all forgotten inside?
A blizzard came freezing, facing the storm again
What about fear? What about rain?
The only things encountered in life
A brilliant Sun glowing, warming the heart again

Where is now the time when world was an open land
When we could play and run in the fields of old
Forever ours were those days, so bright, so new
Only breathing for our hopes, for our dreams
Remember...

[Chorus]
What about faith? What about pride?
Is it all forgotten inside?
A blizzard came freezing, facing the storm again
What about fear? What about rain?
The only things encountered in life
A brilliant Sun glowing, warming the heart again

Meanwhile, we struggle to stand and make a move
Paralyzed by the cold fearsome crowd of the world
Rain trickled down on the windows of our souls
Life's weight may just be too heavy to bear all alone

[Chorus]
What about faith? What about pride?
Is it all forgotten inside?
A blizzard came freezing, facing the storm again
What about fear? What about rain?
The only things encountered in life
A brilliant Sun glowing, warming the heart again

Now, sadness covers our heat once more
The ray of light went away, way too soon
Seeking strength to rebuild ourselves for good
Digging deep to fell the truest value inside of our own

[Chorus]
What about faith? What about pride?
Is it all forgotten inside?
A blizzard came freezing, facing the storm again
What about fear? What about rain?
The only things encountered in life
A billion Suns glowing, warming the heart again

(Only breathing for our hopes)
(Only breathing for our dreams)
(I can feel the truest value)
(Deep inside of my soul)

(Again came the storm)
(But still we are strong)
(Our eyes are shining)
(Our minds are gleaming)

(All together we'll survive the storm)
