How it seems like yesterday
Here comes my own refrain
The one I know my heart
"Why can't I celebrate any gain?"
(Dark curtains spreads) on my dreams nigh foreign
After all the sweat and pain
My goal is out of range and I'm giving up
(No, no, no!)

[Chorus]
Carry on my friend for you will see
Grief, sorrow and agony will no more be in your eyes
For the winds blow the clouds in the sky

Now, dawn, I'm all awake
Ready to face the day
So I'm back again to this place I have been before
Where my hopes and frustration collide
(This time over) making stronger
The beast so silent is now much alive and I shall go on
(to the end!)

[Chorus]
Carry on my friend for you will see
Grief, sorrow and agony will no more be in your eyes
For the winds blow the clouds in the sky

(And so suddenly, I came to see)
(what was for now a mystery)
(And now I'm back from the abyss)
(I spit vengeance for wasted years)

[Chorus]
Carry on my friend for you will see
Grief, sorrow and agony will no more be in your eyes
For the winds blow the clouds in the sky
