I hear the stars sing,
be the shadows reaching lonelines within the world,
within the void.

Eyes of knowledge,
eyes of the blind.

I see the ocean roar.

Pulling itself away,
off from the shores.

Shores of sorrow,
shores of darkness.

I smell the decayed leafs,
landing down from their wombs.

From the old gallow trees.

I feel the wind,
as it rises the dawn and whirls the sun.
