The stars sing the sorrow,
air laid down as so depraved.

A lost chord echoes again with the rain.

Thoughts fill the breath,
to be carried by the stars to the once so sad world.

A lost chord echoes again.

Creating a new path,
to be brought by those waves.

Longing silently,
for something that cannot be reached.

In the dreams, remembrance,
something that drift away.

To the once so sad world,
from the night that holds thoughts for Catharsis.
