[Lead: M. Low] 

Attention my followers from deep below 
You must climb to the heavens and extinguish their souls 
Gather, scavenge stone and steel 
Assemble this structure and our enemies will kneel 
Their fates must now be sealed 
Gather my legions of servants and demons 
A ziggurat you shall now erect 
Starting from the earth and end in the heavens 
Our plan of attack, the ultimate deception 
We are outnumbered, attack while they slumber 
Ascending to the sky our pyramid will rise 
Our path from the ground to their home 
We are the chosen, they are the treacherous 
Gifts of knowledge I will now bestow 

[Lead: M. Pugh] 

Their lair lies buried in the clouds 
Infiltrate their kingdom and cast them to the ground 
Their souls forever bound 
Always pressing forward with a mindset of deathward 
A loathing and hatred for man 
This obelisk, it is our catalyst, here we make our final stand 
Follow me I am your blackened king 
I shall regain what has been stolen by our enemies 
Crush them, abolish them 
Achieve through pure mayhem 
Bloodshed and punishment ensued 
Unlimited, our power shall not falter or cower 
My omnipotence they cannot elude 
Rivaled by none, we are the chosen ones 
Slaughter them and receive riches untold 
Force the gates open wide 
They will scatter, they will hide 
Their kingdom has been overthrown 

[Lead: M. Pugh] 

Ignite the walls, trap them in their halls 
Disembowel them all 
Kingdoms rise and they fall this is our fate, our cabal 
Our destination has been reached, a final fight in the clouds 
Enemies demolished, laid to rest, their bodies wrapped in their shrouds 
Our plans cannot be thwarted, a new age has been started 
Blood will spill from the wounds, our enemies departed 
Survivors are few, they only live if my will allows 
The gates of the dark lord will open 
From the void the destroyer will rise 
With supremacy we slay with no compassion 
To challenge us would not be wise 
Now I gather my legions of servants and demons 
A ziggurat they shall now erect 
Starting from the earth and end in the heavens 
Our plan of attack, the ultimate deception 
Our redemption
