A void tears the sky in two
Unveiling hellish beings from the depths to annihilate you
An anomalous aperture
The gateway to enemies awaiting your obliteration

The serpent regime is ruthless
Fearless, evil and infinite
As the chariots arrive
Demons feast on the bloodshed

The venom of hatred shines bright and pours through
Seeping its poison into the atmosphere
Preying on the weak and spreading constant fear

With their armor of scales, and weapons made of bone
Armed with Hell's fury and never ending scorn
Children of the master
The serpent-born

Cowardice and impotent swine will drown
In the blood that will flow from evisceration
A crimson storm will quench the sky
But never cure the thirst in me

Open the gate to the spoils of Hell
And unleashed is the power of a lost dimension
Chariots of fire in the sky gather souls from the dead
Smitten with torture are the living
As darkness unravels the fate of the enlightened ones

Seeking vengeance with his minions
To repay the full debt of his banishment
To the source with no remorse
The gates of wrath release a punishment of God

Shackled yet loyal to his hatred
He feeds on lust
The lust of purity

Vessels from beyond the reach of time
Will smite this vagrant filth of life

I am the one they call Destroyer
Blissful were their cries
Begging for mercy on their lives
With pleas stained in sorrow

Ego Sum Vastatoris Aiunt (I am the Destroyer they say)
Fero Donum Exitiale (I bring the deadly gift)

Summoned from the void
Emerged an infantry of agony
The unholy army of darkness

Commands the battlefield
With an overwhelming symphony of death
Instruments of war

I will disavow expulsion from my throne
And realign thy golden kingdom
Punishment for your disobedience
Must befall at once
