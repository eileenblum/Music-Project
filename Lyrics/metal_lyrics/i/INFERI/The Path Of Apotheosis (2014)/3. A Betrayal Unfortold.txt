Planted are the seeds that will carry out the deeds 
For the deity's plot bestows knowledge to the slaves 
And a path to be paved for his majesty to burn like coal 
There is no escaping this horror 
Drunken with a rage of his infidelity 
A deity of black is set 
The darkness has spawned, this cannot be undone 
This blackened, wretched heart 
Seeks nothing more than to devour 
The pestilence of man resides in its final hour 
Setting out to destroy the king 
Forging creations with apostasy 
The cloak of his vile malicious intent relies 
On abundant gifts of wealth, prosperity and lies 
Willingly deceived by the luxury received 
And the taste of fleshly impure acts with filthy fallacies 
There is no innocence to behold 
Blinded by debauchery thoughtlessly extolled 
Consumed by the fruits of wickedness 
And deliverance of the soul 
Entwined with a plot of treachery 
A betrayal unforetold 
Blasphemy, through the eyes of the one true architect 
And the shepherd let them wander into exile 
Penance and regret 
The blackened, wretched one 
Seeks nothing more than to devour 
The pestilence of man resides in its final hour 
A web of lies will be the gate for all the tragedy 
To resonate inside the hearts of man and build an infantry 
To rectify and over throw the king 

[Lead: M. Low] 
[Lead: M. Pugh] 

Slaves to his plot and cravings will be 
The foundation for his masterpiece 
A gateway to time and space is his desire 
To breach Heaven's gates with unholy fire 

[Lead: R. Santolla] 

Sinister acts severed them from their salvation 
And the paradise from which they came 
For their inept existence has cursed them all as his slaves 
Mere pawns of the agenda allow the nemesis to convey 
Whispers in the ears of man, pure lies to seal their fate 
This blackened, wretched heart 
Seeks nothing more than to devour 
The pestilence of man resides in its final hour
