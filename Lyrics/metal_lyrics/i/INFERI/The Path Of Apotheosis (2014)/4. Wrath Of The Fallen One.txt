The fruit has been eaten, the only forbidden law 
Their eyes have been opened 
Minds no longer in our control 
They plan to build a star gate 
With the help of the pale ones 
Banished from paradise, forced into exile 
And unveil the wrath of the fallen one 
The fallen one 

[Lead: M. Pugh] 

We must shower them with darkness and plagues 
Scorch the Earth's surface until nothing remains 
Pray for benevolence while hidden in their caves 
Heads hung in submission, punishment 
Eternal slaves 
Throw away your life of harmony 
Trade it all for eternal slavery 
Judgement made for your sins 
Now the torment will begin 
Who will you pray to now 
Death is the only way out 
These mortals have been given a choice 
And they choose betrayal 
Life in the garden free of disease 
Or an evil wretched world of horrors 
The upheaval will rejoice 
In the constant plagues that will storm the land 
When evil weaves its filthy wings into the souls of man 
Unveil the wrath of the fallen one
