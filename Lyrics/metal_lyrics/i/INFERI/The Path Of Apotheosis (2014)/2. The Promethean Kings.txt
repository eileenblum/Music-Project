My mind fills with torment and suffering 
Watching my world corrode 
I shall create a race of slaves to harvest 
Fusing our blood with this simian and a soul 
To serve our every wish and request 
They stand forth and call me God 
Know your master, worship and obey 
I shall protect you from the fallen one whose wish is to enslave 
What a horrible mistake to leave them all alone 
They dwell in the garden seeking the knowledge of our throne 
Devising a plan to devour the fruit in its whole 
This blasphemy must be punished, Demolish their souls 
Strike them down with lightning 
Quakes will crumble their homes 
Soak them with flames ever burning 
This atrocity will drown in a cascade of death 
Nothing is left, Just remains of their flesh 
This is a time of great agony 
This is a time of misfortune and pain 
Affliction is now upon us 
But my creation will serve and obey 
Worshipers of the shining serpent 
Will reap the fruits of my dismay 
Praise must given, exalt unto me 
No harm will be done to thee, as long as I breathe 
I am the creator from a golden throne I lead 
I am the chosen Promethean King 

[Solo M. Pugh] 
[Solo M. Low] 
[Solo M. Pugh] 

I am everlasting, never question my rule 
It is my will to sustain their lives 
You have the heart of a fool 
You have grown weak and forgiving 
Crush them all with no sign of regret 
Enemies of our heavenly alliance 
Must pay for their sins with death 

[Solo M. Low] 

Enemies of the golden throne must pay with their death 
I am the king of all kings 
You are blinded by rage and ignorance 
These mortals must not be our enemies
