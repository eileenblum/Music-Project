Banished from Elysium, a deity has been dethroned 
Cast into the unknown 
Scouring the wasteland, forced to fend for his own 
Stripped from his sovereignty 
Now an outcast, an enemy in exile for eternity 
As he leads the pariahs further into the abyss of heresy 
Vile acts of betrayal brands a stigma on his soul 
To wallow in filth, never 
His pride to great for sickness and woe 
His enemy's extinction is undeniable 
In solitude his fury grows with a vengeance 
His constriction on hate seeps from his veins 
Like venom embraced by coils of contempt 
The enraged mastermind will now stop at nothing 
To breach the gates of Elysium 

[Lead: M. Pugh] 

Deception is his contrivance 
He takes on the ophidian form 
To manipulate and regulate his children 
From the viper born 
His army of anathema, bound by his will 
His ethos begets them to kill 

[Lead: M. Low] 

Benighted with shame his destiny 
To roam the earth he is bound 
To lead the abominations astray 
On his quest to reclaim the crown 
The horde of minions fulfill his intent 
Of total annihilation and help him invent 
The means to travel through space and time 
Conquer and vanquish his nemesis the pure and divine 
Fueled by the strength of his effigy 
Reflections of his treachery combined 
Festers like carrion inside of his mind 
Reprisal by indoctrination 
Augmented with animus
