Eons before the age of man 
Entities of omnipotence, yet mortal inhabitants 
Dwell on Nibiru's once flourishing soil 
Stricken by a catastrophic anomaly 
Unseen by their prophecies 
This anomaly was war 
This anomaly was blood thirst and greed 
The skies were scorched by their war machines 
Their dominion collapsed from the sins of their deeds 
Their land was a battlefield 
Shards of destruction black out the sky 
Longing for annihilation, no chance for preservation 
Inevitable destruction, a planets demise 
Treading in the wake on the shores of tragedy 
Factions subsided to build a dynasty 
Born from dismay Galactic covenant 

[Solo M.Low] 
[Solo M.Pugh] 

The fate of their world has been sealed, left in ruination 
Nibiru was demolished, now gone for eternity 
Like locusts they spread further than the light of their sun 
Conquering, planting plagues in the roots of the galaxy 
It was said 
Those who were from the Heavens came down to the Earth 
and rose from the ashes gave life to a new rebirth 
But serpents fed on slaughtered souls 
In ruins lie empty thrones 
Remnants of past civilizations 
Lay the foundation for a culture renewed 
Refurbished creations emerge from extinction 
Grotesque abominations now improved 
The quest for perfection has failed 
Start from anew 
They disposed of the animals, Incinerate 
Coalesced their omniscience 
With the insignificant lesser mortal beings
