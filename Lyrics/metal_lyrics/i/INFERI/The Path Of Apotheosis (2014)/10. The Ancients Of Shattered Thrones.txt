War subsides
Destruction of the humans and the demise of the divine
Behold the flames
The aftermath of battle mounds of bodies lie in charred remains
I will erase remnants of the past destroyed
I will remain
Plant the seed inside my bloodline sustained 
Burn all the scriptures of their putrid lies
It was not my will to have these peons deny
This creation was intended to save our lives
Drenched in the flames, the surface of the earth
Crumbled structures, idols in our image will now be burned
Now the demise, all life is now extinct
Cleansing fire will annihilate the souls
of those who love or deny me
The all consuming blaze will obliterate
Scorching embers char the earth and will devastate
Fragments of life now ash
shadows of existence is all that remains
Withered and weak 
The chosen ones will be filled with the seed 
And planted deep below 
Inside the womb the demon spawn will grow
His enemies will never know
Cultivation and preservation of the human soul
Their stories forever told
The Ancients of Shattered thrones

[Lead: M. Pugh]

Writings on the walls, the explanation for the fall
The beginning of time and the slaughter of their mortal thralls
Unrepentant blasphemous slaves
Encroaching into darkness, their lives will now be saved
Spitting in the face of their martyr, their paths have been paved
Forging generations of filth as black seeds beget
Victory by corruption in a deity's silhouette
Burned and forgotten 
The sacred dialect, scripture and chronicles shall be
Abandoned by divinity
Fabrications of life now lost for eternity

[Lead: M. Low]

The ancients of shattered thrones
Left the burdens of withered remains
And the stains of their blood flow 
Through the sewers of humanoid veins
Monarchs of the dynasty have sown forbidden seed
Lucid was the path to yield their souls into oblivion

[Lead: M. Low]
