The architect of lies and magnificent deceit 
has nourished himself with endeavors of supremacy 
There is no peace for an engineer of war 
Therefore no tranquility for the bastards he scorns 
The ophidian warlord is reaping the life blood 
Sown into the flesh, with a relentless campaign on the kingdom 
A river of blood will flow and locusts will feast on the dead 
As boils, famine and darkness unveils 
The reverence of unholy plans 
With a gaze of exuberance, He gathers 
His slaves into the heart of his lair 
Before a ghastly haze coated the stones 
Of the walls in his court yards with a mist of vermillion 
He slaughtered them all, all of them were ravaged 
A vicious display of his power immersed in revenge 
A river of blood will flow and locusts will feast on the dead 
As boils, famine and darkness unveils 
The reverence of unholy plans 
The ground trembles from the thunderous march 
An endless sea of soldiers at his side 
Their will at his command 

[Solo: M. Pugh] 

The reflection of felicity in his eyes 
As he peers upon a paradise to set ablaze 

[Lead: M. Low] 

Bombarded with attacks, the end is near 
Hope has been forced to be lost 
Destruction is imminent 
Onslaught of the covenant 
The darkness of the night sky 
Glistens with luminous weapon emissions 
Wave after wave of menacing demonic legions 
Ripping their flesh apart
