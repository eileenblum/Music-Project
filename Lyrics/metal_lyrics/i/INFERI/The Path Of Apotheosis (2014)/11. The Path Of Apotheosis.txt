[Lead: M.Pugh] 

Enlightened by the aftermath of war 
A twisted perversion seared the hearts of slaves 
Branded in the image of their masters 
In the wake of The Great Deluge 
The kingdom lies in vast desolation 
Permeation of sickness and sorrow 
A travesty of man has now ensued 
To rid them of the burdens of their past 
The tribes were divided, scattered and thrown into disarray 
Then the Deities ascended the sky 
Leaving behind lost creations to sift through the lies 
With folly the wicked will inherit the earth 
Enslaving their brothers with ideals of rebirth 
No longer bound to the foot of the throne 
As demigods they conquer with their master's conviction 
Mere machines of desperate emulation 
With false depictions and purposeless sacrifice 
They are lost forever 
Bow down to the phantoms 
Bow down to the ghosts in the sky 

[Lead: M.Pugh] 

Worshiping mortals as gods 
Seeking false truth to no end 
For the path of apotheosis 
Has slipped through the grips of man 
Illuminated by no obstruction of power 
And twisted delusions of lavish grandeur 

[Lead: M.Low] 

They are now gods of man seeking out the weak 
And frail diluted bloodlines 
Cursed is the flesh fabricated by the eternal resonance 
of vile endeavors of man 
With false depictions and purposeless sacrifice 
They are lost forever 
The frailty of existence will be their demise 
Egotistical commandments hold sway to their lies 
Rely on the peasants who serve while programmed to be blind 
Making them gods of the masquerade 
Their screams for mercy will fall upon deaf ears 
Servants to the cause of The Great Deceiver 
Bow down to the phantoms 
Bow down to the ghosts in the sky 
Deception was their device to crush the weak 
Lost and bewildered, the verminous cretins 
Will glorify nothing on their knees
