The skies have grown black 
With infidelities that cannot be undone 
Those who hide in darkness feel the solace of execution 
Adversity has stormed the walls and gates that we adore 
Descending fast upon us 
Mere flesh to feed the steel of our swords 
And our swords will remain unsheathed 
Quenching our thirst with their blood 
Do not let them retreat 
Marching through the flames of tyranny 
Severing their black wings of deception 
No compassion for those too blind to see 
Their perfidious reign must come to an end 

[Lead: M. Pugh] 

Bow before me, beg for your life and taste my blade's desire 
The flames of a thousand suns 
Cannot withstand the wrath of a God 
I am the Guardian of thy creation 
I shall rid them of the vermin and swine thou hast released 

[Lead: M. Pugh] 

With impenetrable will and lust for absolution by death 
We shall not falter, we sooth their lungs with dying breath 
Marching through the flames of tyranny 
Severing black wings of deceit 
My legions have assembled to give their lives for me 
And the flames in which you have summoned 
Will be smothered by the ashes of your regime 
There will be no victory to be marveled by your progenies 
As the stains of your existence will be swept clean from history 
No shackles nor torture for thee 
Death will be the penalty which you shall receive 
Destroy and devour with unrivaled power 
The aftermath will end in death 
Smoldering is the ash that once was life 
My decree will be reawakened 

[Lead: M. Low] 
[Lead: M. Hawkins] 

Destroy and devour with unrivaled power 
The aftermath will end in death 
Smoldering is the ash that once was life 
Defiance must be obliterated
