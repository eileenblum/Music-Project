[Lyrics by Josh Harrell / Music by Malcolm Pugh]

Inside the belly of a beast made of flesh and steel
My flesh and blood no longer seem so real
Inside this war machine that has blurred my sight
Distorting my vision of what's wrong or right

Blistering speed with a barrage of no mercy
Is the only thing fueling me to breathe
I am the future breed created through pure insanity
Simply shut off it I decide to think

I am the war machine
Forced to lead, bleed the weak
Lead by wicked hearts full of deceit
The war machine

Blistering speed with a barrage of no mercy
Is the only thing fueling me to breathe

I am the war machine
Forced to lead, bleed the weak
Lead by wicked hearts full of deceit
The war machine

All guns are locked and loaded
I am the weapon of mass destruction
This is the Armageddon of man
The time has come to unleash the master plan

Devastation and the ruins of man
Barren lands and blood soaked hands
Seek and destroy all survivors, nothing left but sand

I am the future breed created through pure insanity
Simply shut off it I decide to think

I am the war machine
Forced to lead, bleed the weak
Lead by wicked hearts full of deceit
The war machine
