[Lyrics by Josh Harrell, Malcolm Pugh / Music by Malcolm Pugh and Chris Brocius]

I've fought in many battles since the dawn of time
Crushing skulls beneath boots leaving no compromise
This is dreadful fate that thousands have met
Living this dreadful life with only one regret

This is my sentence of eternity
My sentence of eternal life
A living hell that has come over me
I fear I'll never see the light

You must now behold
This hell that is my life a story never told
An endless a circle of regret, I've paid my debt
Forever searching for my end
I fear a challenge never met

My lust for power was my downfall, my demise
I betrayed my brothers while staring them right in their eyes
A punishment so cruel one I could never dream of
I close my eyes beg for mercy and dream of the heavens

This is my sentence of eternity
My sentence of eternal life
A living hell that has come over me
I fear I'll never see the light

You must now behold
This hell that is my life a story never told
An endless a circle of regret, I've paid my debt
Forever searching for my end
I fear a challenge never met

Dying inside someone please hear my cries
Every since the dawn of time I've walked alone traveling the world
Searching for the end my only fear is that this is my
Sentence of eternal life
Someone end it tonight
Sentence of eternal life

Its about to end
No use for me to pretend
Endless hate with no chance of peace
Only prayers for my life to cease

Suffer unto me know
I'll never see the light
I am god amongst mankind
