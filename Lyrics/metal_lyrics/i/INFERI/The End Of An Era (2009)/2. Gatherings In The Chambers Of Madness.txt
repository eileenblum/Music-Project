[Lyrics by Josh Harrell, Chris Brocius and Malcolm Pugh / Music by Malcolm Pugh]

Golden rooms where fantasies come true flowing wine
And women stand in line waiting for you to make up your mind
The succubus will bleed you dry this is the ending of your feeble life

Within those chamber walls yield fantasies and lust
Cravings beset on those enchanted
Expose your weakness and they will grind your bones to dust
Witness the gatherings in the chambers of madness

With intoxicating beauty, they hunt at night to find their prey
They prowl like wolves in the pale moonlight

A scent of seduction makes them so divine
Drawing you closer with blinded sight
And your instincts overcome
Nothing is left but for you to succumb

One by one they lead them into darkness where a chamber waits inside
Tempting you with fantasies and filling them with lies
Just one taste and then you will begin to close your eyes

Within those chamber walls yield fantasies and lust
Cravings beset on those enchanted
Expose your weakness and they will grind you bones to dust
Witness the gatherings in the chambers of madness
At first glance this seems to be a dream come true
Pleasures of the flesh that mere man cannot fathom
Unveiling tragedy now torture will ensue
Behold the gatherings in the chambers of madness

In an instant your pleasure turns into your worst nightmare
Darkness, torture, and despair
Your stomach turns filling you with fear
You can close your eyes but you'll still feel the pain
You break your wrists trying to escape from your restraints
Witness the removal of your limbs
This must be the punishment for all your sins

There is no escape from this wretched place
You've surrendered your fate to the lust of the flesh
They will eat until nothing is left
Still alive to see the meat on the bone
Ripped and torn for a feast by the throne
Of the god who lives for immorality

Now is the time for the king to consume all of your remains
The sight of someone eating you will drive you insane
One final snap will be the end of all your pain

Within those chamber walls yield fantasies and lust
Cravings beset on those enchanted
Expose your weakness and they will grind you bones to dust
Witness the gatherings in the chambers of madness

This brutal end should come as no surprise
Vision fading into your own demise

If you find yourself within these chamber walls
Prepare for the worst, the madness will befall
Hidden by their pleasure, the kind shall have you all
