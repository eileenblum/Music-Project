[Lyrics by Josh Harrell, Malcolm Pugh and Chris Brocius / Music by Malcolm Pugh and Chris Brocius]

From the ashes rose a demonic blade
Crafted by hatred and sent to enslave
Cast away in the deepest cell
Guarded by angels from demons of hell

Rise from the flames below
The blade provides supreme control with powers unknown
Hidden from evil to preserve its flame
Now is the time to carry out its fate

And on that fated day
The demons, they came
Slaying the angels and stealing the blade
Given to a king with a heart of black
He gathers his soldiers and prepares to attack

Rise from the flames below
The blade provides supreme control with powers unknown
Hidden from evil to preserve its flame
Now is the time to carry out its fate

As the fallen ones return to their master
They fester in evil and bellow with laughter
The angels knew hell shall befall

Inside this kingdom of rage
His mind becomes deranged
With plans of domination
To create a demonic nation

A land of redemption
A land to renew
A loss of all kinds
Both, wicked and true

A storm of darkness fills the sky with destiny
The burning gates of the depths of hell will bring
A thousand demons rise as one
This war has begun the charring of flesh, pure devastation

This ancient evil has pleasured my mind
Bestowing me power to control all of time
Lest I die, all existence is mine

Surrender forever
With my might, eternal night
Enslaved by rage
This sword beacons me

I foresee fallen kings
Release me from my sheath

Die by my hand
This ancient evil is at my command

This blade placed inside my hand
Fueling my hatred this will be the end
No use so give in
And now just bow your head to your king
The flames of this blade will kill everything
