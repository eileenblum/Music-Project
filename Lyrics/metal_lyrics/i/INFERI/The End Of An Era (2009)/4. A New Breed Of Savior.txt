[Lyrics by Josh Harrell and Malcolm Pugh / Music by Malcolm Pugh]

Crucified on his day birth, taken to his new master's confines
Raised to feed on the souls of the divine
But in time he will find the truth is in the back of his mind
Raise the veil from his eyes

A new breed of savior for all of mankind
No one to stand by his side
Fed only lies, an evil disguise
Now is the time for this hero to rise
Callused hearts and tortured souls
Trained him to never turn on his own
Cast from the gates, deny eternal hate

Armed with the flames of hell, he slays the wicked and does it well
Without a weakness in sight we saves hundreds of humans lives
Made a slave, cast away, they betrayed,
But he saved those who they have enslaved

A new breed of savior for all of mankind
No one to stand by his side
Fed only lies, an evil disguise
Now is the time for this hero to rise
Callused hearts and tortured souls
Trained him to never turn on his own
Cast from the gates, deny eternal hate

Such a cruel fate for an innocent new born soul to bare
The burdens of a wretched world
Fighting the wicked to redeem his name
He seeks no fame only his rightful place
In a peaceful world, free of hate

No longer flesh and bone
There is nothing that can stop him now
His enemies will bow

Endowed with the powers of both sides
Not by choice, but forced through strife
He sheds his mortal life and bares the burden for mankind
And cries for all of those who've died
It's not his choice to take their lives

Crucified on his day birth, taken to his new master's confines
Raised to feed on the souls of the divine
But in time he will find the truth is in the back of his mind
Raise the veil from his eyes

A new breed of savior for all of mankind
No one to stand by his side
Fed only lies, an evil disguise
Now is the time for this hero to rise
Callused hearts and tortured souls
Trained him to never turn on his own
Cast from the gates, deny eternal hate
