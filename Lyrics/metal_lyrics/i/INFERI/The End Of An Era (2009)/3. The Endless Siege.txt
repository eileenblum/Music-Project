[Lyrics by Josh Harrell, Malcolm Pugh / Music by Malcolm Pugh]

Fueled by the fury of a thousand men
For the lies we have come here to slay thee
Justice and revenge set on the wasted blood
That flows through the veins of my enemies

Break down the doors
To the hall of the whores
Who've been sent to kill and enslave the
Heroes gone home from battle they're torn
Looking for peace from the enemy

Fueled by the agony of a thousand men
To save their lives we have come here to slay thee
Justice and revenge set on the wasted blood
That flows through the veins of my enemies

My axe will dine on flesh
Whilst my sword is thirsting for blood
The slaying, the slaughter, the butchery
An endless siege of iniquity

Wave after wave we slaughter to save
Our brothers restrained through hostility
Victims of evil we've come to release
Take up your arms and vanquish thee

Vanquish thee!!!

My axe will dine on flesh
Whilst my sword is thirsting for blood
The slaying, the slaughter, the butchery
An endless siege of iniquity

Moving from room to room we banish demon souls
Taking this den out of their hands place it in our control.
Resistance is useless no need to fight
We gain the upper hand on this fateful night

The cowards run and they hide
Defenseless to our blades they kneel and cry
Slit the last throat and see the life fade from there eyes

There will be no epitaph, there will be no eulogy for you
There will be no remains, only bones and ash

We march through a veil of crimson mist

This is the slaughter of a dying race
In the eyes of the gods such a pitiful disgrace
Extermination of the filth,let the cleansing begin

Fueled by the wrath of a thousand men
For their souls we have come here to save thee
Justice and revenge set on the wasted blood
That flows through the veins of my enemies

My axe will dine on flesh
Whilst my sword is thirsting for blood
The slaying, the slaughter, the butchery
An endless siege of iniquity
Let the cleansing begin
