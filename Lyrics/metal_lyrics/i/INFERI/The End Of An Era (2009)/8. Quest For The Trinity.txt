[Lyrics by Josh Harrell, Malcolm Pugh and Chris Brocius / Music by Malcolm Pugh]

Faced against many foes
I brandish my steel soaked with the blood of perished souls
Engulfed with the flames of both light and dark
Redemption is my goal
I must now embark

Onward to the highest peak to slay the winged frozen beast
He unleashes fury through the heavens wind and blistering cold
A carousel of winds blinding my surroundings
I mount this animal and sever his wings
I pierce my blade deep in the heart of this soulless wretched beast
This is his defeat

Air, land and sea
Man versus beast
These epic battles that man cannot perceive

On this voyage of the dead
Retrieving all their heads
Is the only way to seek out my revenge
This quest is not my choice
The gods must hear my voice
I must slay all these beast to bring forth my rejoice

In pursuit of the submerged fiend set sail to the deepest sea
A beast of proportions that are hard to believe
Leviathan, I call forth to summon thee
The ocean transforms into a maelstrom
The foe reveals himself with a vortex from beneath
Striking my vessel with an onslaught of attacks
At the point of no return it would be fatal to turn back

Deep below now we shall go
To finish this battle in the blackest abyss
He opens wide and swallows me whole
This is not the end, NO, I must persist
Now in the innards of this beast
I refuse to become his feast
Stabbing the heart continuously
A slain god by the hands of a human being

Looking back at my past which is not my own
On this quest sent from the highest throne
To slay the unholy trinity
That has stolen my true identity

Now I travel to a far and distant land
Which have never seen the prophecies of man
To find the entrance held deep beneath the earth
And fight the guardian where the demons lurk

Inside this lair lies a beast that awaits me
Told to have three heads the defender of Hades
Heeding his howls, his warnings will follow
Refusing this threat my sword he shall swallow
Breathing his flames, there burning and scorching
Melting my armor and dropping my sword
I resort to brute force and break off his horns
My end is approaching facing hell's scorn

Venturing past the gate to reveal a fiery lake
The resting place for a sword used for evil, nevermore

Air, land and sea
Man versus beast
These epic battles that man cannot perceive

On this voyage of the dead
Retrieving all their heads
Is the only way to seek out my revenge
This quest is not my choice
The gods must hear my voice
I must slay all these beast to bring forth my rejoice

With Hades blade in hand I make my final stand
Cutting at the throat of all three heads
Ascend the blade for the heavens to keep
I sleep forever as the journey is complete
