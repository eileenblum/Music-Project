[Solo Mike Low]

At last glistening light rains upon me
From a crevice in the cavern shines through the debris
On this day this odyssey concludes setting me free

[Solo Malcolm Pugh]

The vast chasm holds the remains of a frozen lake
A usurper's dominion
Bound waist down by frosted chains
The fallen angel's bane
Through the eyes of the demon, I see myself
My bloodthirsty sword pointed forward
Thunder it seems
Ripples atop the ice as Lucifer speaks

"Come forth, my child
You hold the key to release me from this misery
Strike me down and steal my crown
Taste my power's true majesty"

Son of the dawn
The morning star
Beelzebub, the wicked one
Abaddon

[Solo Mike Low]

Indulged by a madness, betrothed to his death
With only himself to blame
As he approaches, their powers coalesce
Awaken an ancient flame

"A congregation your presence bestowed
The blade thou hath unsheathed is part of me
As are you, my son, my seed, I profess"

With the sword forged from the heart in his chest
Violently restored by the flesh born from his soul
The revenant rebirth

On contact, he saw himself lose his own life
Through the eyes of the dark lord's sight
He could see the convergence
Absorbed betwixt the union of the fight
Now one and the same, bringers of the light

[Solo Malcolm Pugh]

Rejuvenation by freedom from my chains
A declaration I shall proclaim
Storm all life on the earth
At will, reform the heavens

Light bearer, the heavens mourn
Light bearer, I am reborn
Light bearer, I am reborn
Light bearer, the heavens mourn
