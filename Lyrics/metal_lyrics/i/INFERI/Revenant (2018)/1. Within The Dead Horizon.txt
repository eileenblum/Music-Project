Arise
my servants, my slaves
exclaimed by the lord of atrocities
bodies the soul left unclaimed
rotting away
empty and ripe for the taking
to exercise thou blackened will
thine corpses unearth
rise forth from the summoning
an army of undead cretins pour from the earth

Beyond the dead horizon
feeding the river of woe
a cantus of coins to pay the toll
upon the ferrymenâs vessel
Within the dead horizon
the abduction
of wandering souls
left to atone as revenants
in their bodies enslaved forever

pestilent armies will coalesce
feasting on the blood of mortal flesh
minions of the underworld unveil
the embrace of Armageddon
pestilent armies will coalesce
feasting on the blood of mortal flesh
minions of the underworld create
boundless devastation

Awakened from the clutches of infinity
his mission, not yet complete
the slayer of Cerberus himself must come forth
to purify the aftermath
of the hellhoundâs defeat

[M. Pugh Solo]

Behold the dead horizon
feeding the river of woe
the excrement of the netherworld
overflow in a vast formation
Within the dead horizon
the abduction
of wandering souls
left to atone as revenants
in their bodies enslaved forever

deprived of judgment
wandering souls
succumb to calls of the
incantation of
the resurrection

[M. Low Solo]

deprived of judgment
the wandering souls
succumb to calls
of the flesh
