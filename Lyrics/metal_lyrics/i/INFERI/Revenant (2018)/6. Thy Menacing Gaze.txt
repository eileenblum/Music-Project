As if this all was for not
The journey, the knowledge, the objective sought
Seeking the power transforming by force
I've given myself to this savage onslaught

Words cast aside as the violence emerges
Weapons drawn from sheaths as vitality surges
A crown of serpents forces conflict
Accompanied by minions striking forth mortally quick
As black as night, my will to fight
All before me shall perish

A trio of beasts whose grisly heads I shall claim
The wicked must learn its place amongst the lame
Decapitate to castrate, thy weapons removed
Mortal flesh of mine, beasts wish to consume

Ice like stares penetrates the air
Beckoning gestures of rage
Surrounded am I, long lost my fear
Enemies drawn close as death strides near
Keeping thyne resolve sharp as thy blade
Not worn by my path I've not journeyed in vain

As the relics of disaster ward off the assault
Sculpted are the fallen, statues of stone
Allow me this asylum as I strike through the bone

The venom of hate that flows
Violently coursing through the veins
Deadly grasp of claws unrelenting in pain
Strengthened by courage, minions be slain
Venomous vipers you shall know my name

Thy menacing gaze shall be shattered by my blade
Thy menacing gaze of lifeless remains

[Solo M. Low]

As if this all was for not
The journey, the knowledge, the objective sought
Seeking the power transforming by force
I've given myself to this savage onslaught

Tearing eyes from shallow sockets
Spewing guts of crimson, flowing like faucets
Sword shines shimmering red
Each gash I take removing thy head

Pulse of stone
Beheaded and cast down from thy throne
Sterilized, discarded your tomb now my throne
Pathways unguarded
I am the victor as you grow cold

[Solo M. Pugh]

Pulse of stone
Beheaded and cast down from thy throne
Sterilized discarded your tomb now my throne
Pathways unguarded
I am the victor as you've grown cold
