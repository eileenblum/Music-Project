Drawn into the labyrinth
Of those damned by lust of the flesh
Naked, tattered and tormented bodies
Ripped apart
By the howling shriek of a whirlwind
Ensnaring a deviant kind
Threshing about forevermore

Minos, then whispered to him,
"You are now prisoner here!
Condemned to the boiling of blood
For the souls you've bestowed upon us
In the wickedest ways
From war-ridden days on the earth
Sentenced in the past to a lifetime eternally.
This assailant now ours for eternity"

Banished to the underworld
But the judge could not foresee
He was an enemy and he's come to slay his king
From beyond the gates I have come for victory
I am the enemy and I've come to slay your king

[Solo M. Pugh]

The judge kneeled to submit
And present an offering
Hold back to watch him plea
As he grovels on his knees
"In exchange for all your mercy
I will grant you amnesty"
But the lies between his teeth
Hold a stench of fantasy

[Solo M. Low]
[Solo M. Pugh]
[Solo M. Low]
[Solo J. Schwallier]

Engulfed by a maelstrom of lustful dead
He snatched out the tongue from the judge's head
Putting his limp serpent body to use
He strangled Minos with his tail like a noose

Eyes grown darker appearing shallow and thin
Life is seeping forth from the dead vessel within
I have freed them all from this Cretan
I have freed them all

Condemned assailant
Will release the weight off of the crown
Nothing will sway him on his path to Cocytus
He is bound

With blood drying fast on his fingertips
His vigorous yearning to massacre wickedness
Nothing can stand in his way
On this journey to slay the beast
Not even the hand of god
