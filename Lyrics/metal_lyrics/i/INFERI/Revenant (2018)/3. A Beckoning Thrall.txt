A voice from the past cries out to him,
"Drink the blood and taste the flesh"
With no one to fight and nothing in sight
He reluctantly heeds the call

[Solo M. Pugh]

"The guardian of this realm
Vanquished and slain
By my blade which i wish to regain
'Twas not my will to take his life
Nor my lust for blood"

It beckons from the lake of phlegathon
Once obtained by the hands this demigod

The blade's hunger, whispers in his ear
"Together we'll eradicate all of your fears
Your enemies will drench in the shadow of your reign
Supreme you'll be as they bow to their king"

It calls him from the lake of phlegathon
Once obtained by the hands this demigod
Reunite they must
It's their destiny to rule both hell and the heavens

A voice from the past cries out to him
"To drink the blood and taste the flesh"
With no one to fight and nothing in sight
He knows his mind is lost

A beckoning thrall
Leads him deeper through the chasm
Pressing forth willingly to gain true power
To gain true power

Beneath his feet in a slush of putrefaction
Lie the gluttonous souls of dead sinners
Reaching out for him to save them
But their souls are lost
Their cries are useless to them
Frothing like dogs

[Solo M. Low]

A void of darkness swells inside of his chest
As his hunger grows for the power he once possessed

The last flicker of his soul resides
Still pure and deep within
Immersed in blood lust
And buried by the blade's deception
Twisted in its lie
Deeper through the hollows he must return
His fate now aligned
