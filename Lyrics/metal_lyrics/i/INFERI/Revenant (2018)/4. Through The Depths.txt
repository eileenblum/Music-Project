[Solo M. Pugh]

He travels deeper into the cursed nether
His eyes endowed with disbelief
A sea of lost souls gather here
In the quartus ring of endless avarice
Victors of misfortune
Suffering all but rapturous

He travels deeper into this cursed realm
As he proceeds through the atrocity
Smitten by the blight of the damned

Only to gain the powers that be
A hand must be dealt to seal a prominent fate
A sea of lost souls gather here
In the quartus ring of endless avarice

[Solo J. Malone]

Dignitaries clash with no anger or rage
Dispirited grunts echo
Blank faces struggle under the weight
Without notice without care
To our warriorâs entrance
This cavern of endless exhaustion

Movement catches the eye
Shrouded tendrils begin to oscillate
Toward the end of the cirrus
Sits a man with a crown
Intrigued by his guest in his palace
In the world of dead champions
As the deity announces his presence
Plutus thirsts for dominance and remains
Unbound by the partitions of this realm
The measure of power by the weight
Of ones earthly claims

[Solo M. Pugh]

An offer was stated
Bringing balance to the tides
The beast of greed is taken aback
Whilst evil is dancing it must still be slain
Only to gain the powers that be
A hand is dealt to seal a prominent fate

[Solo M. Pugh]

Fulfilling the decrees of the prophecies
That dwell in the clutches of time
With hoarding and plunder lest ye benign curse by design
A divine comedy to indulge in this never-ending agony

Verbal agreements pass through their teeth
Drenching thine ethics with corrosive filth

Greed cannot fill this bottomless pit
His efforts are endless as all life will wilt
Breathless endeavors gasping for air
These lies become snakes that coil your throat
The ending is further than others have dared
The waves that have come to engulf in despair

To the depths I will guide you
For a debt you will pay
Through the depths I will guide you
To the one you must slay
