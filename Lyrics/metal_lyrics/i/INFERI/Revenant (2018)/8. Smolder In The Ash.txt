Softened bodies lashed to the bone
Bludgeoned blue and black
And the nine-tails, as they walk endlessly
Snatch the flesh off their back

Sycophant fawners bathe, tirelessly astray
Stewing forever in excrement and soils of man

Simonist, corrupt false men of the cloth
Cast down face first into the rock below
Lower extremities bursting ablaze
Venomous and fraudulent malcontents
Strode across this wasteland

Against their god they commit their crimes
Through the thickets of sorrow
Past the sands of time
Punishment must be dealt
For their sorcery, treachery and lies

For the riches and limitless wealth
Built on the backs of swine
Servants of the land in boiling tar
To be scorched at his command

Heavy are the cloaks of gold
Each thread sewn of lead
Affliction for duplicitous words misled
No redemption for hypocrites
Forever march bound to their shrine
The pharisee's crucifix

Striving to be human once more
Taste of the flesh and assimilate their form

[Solo M. Pugh]

Deceivers of the world will serenade
Their pillars of ash wail tongues of the flame
One with the fire, molten cage
Smolder in the ash of eternity
Shrilling screams befriend their agony
Suffer for deceit never to receive empathy

[Solo J. Schwallier]
[Solo M. Low]

Gaping wounds
Softened tissue receive lacerations
By a demon's sword
Sowers of discord
Laid waste by a demon's scorn

Falsifiers draped in disease
Reside, plagued by the sins of their deeds
Decaying with leprosy and boils on their flesh
To decompose and fester at their behest
