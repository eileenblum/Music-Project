Terra tribus annulos,
Primus, the river, a nile of coagulated encrusted shores
Blisters boil from flesh to blood
Beyond sight stretched the streams of gore
Hideous spawn, nessus the damned, deemed to guide
Head of an ox and body of man
Punishment for the most heinous of crimes
Reveal the path upon which we shall bride
Through the forest of mors voluntaria

To live like gods with a tyrannous reign
To walk the earth enraged whilst delivering pain
Murder finds justice in the fire of the brook
Smolder in the blood of every life that you took

Murderous executions, decimators of life
Perpetually captive to blood spilling innocents with spite
Sodomized in the Phlegathonâs malevolent sanction
Forever the lungs of the butcher internally filled with flame
For great is the pain
Searing of flesh with the smoldering breath
And the scorching of futile remains

Apotheosize their extinction, glorifying their eternal death

Secundum circulum, blackened and withering husks
Protruding toxic thistles seeping of obsidian sap
As hisses turn to wails, destruction and suicide entails
Soak in their sinful death

Pass the final judgement they will remain
No carnal resurrection here
Their festering corpses on limbs of thorn will hang
Damnation beyond eternity they fear
Roots sprout misfortune, nourish affliction, stretch thy skin
Disfiguration at the crust thickets grow within
Growing ever stronger, self-hatred shall bloom
Vines of self-loathing and bitterness resume

[Solo M. Pugh]

In the heart a heretic regret gives birth to cries
Cynics of the holiest temples scorched on the sand supine
Viscous flow the fires smelting sluggish in the sky
Like branches choked by honey as itâs seeping from the hive
Consuming the flesh all but skeletons are left

Regeneration of their bodies will fill the belly of
Carnivorous embers

Sodomites sink in this barren earth
Flakes of ash in a gust like a blizzard
Suffocate the lungs of the usurer
Storms of fire rage in oblivion

[Solo M. Pugh]

Decem regna malum, ten realms of the Malebolge we face
Beware less thee be devoured
Vivid is the scythe brought by death to this place

To live like gods with a tyrannous reign
To walk the earth enraged whilst delivering pain
The bell tolls immensely in the fire by the brook
Through the gates he must wander again
