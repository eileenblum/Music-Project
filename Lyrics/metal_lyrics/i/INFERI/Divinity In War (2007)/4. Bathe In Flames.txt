[music by M. Pugh, C. Brocius / lyrics by J. Harrell, M. Pugh]

Take up your arms warriors of the land
To fight the evil and their plans and scorch them to the bones
Defend your home, whatever it may take
Call upon the aid of the mighty creature of the sky

Mount your beast and take the battle to the sky
Bathe them with flames, no one left alive

Take up your arms, those that make a stand
Charge to the battle field, a fury they won't understand
Dragon flames will rain from above
Deal a crushing blow and watch the heavens rain with their blood

Fire, the enemy must die
Honor, the good will win and must survive
Triumph, over evil and their plans
Victory, is now in our hands

We must defend the land and people
Against this brand new evil

Mount your beast and take the battle to the sky
Bathe them with flames, no one left alive

Raise up your flag victorious display
We fought with courage to see our enemies enslaved
All those who have died tonight were cast away with flames
Spend eternity in hell as we watch you bathe in...

Fire, the enemy must die
Honor, the good will win and must survive
Triumph, over evil and their plans
Victory, is now in our hands
