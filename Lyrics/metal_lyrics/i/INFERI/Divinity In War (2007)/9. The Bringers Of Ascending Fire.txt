[music by M. Pugh, J. Harrell / lyrics by M. Pugh]

We are tyrants of power and war
The time to engage is upon us
We must devour this world with unstoppable force
Conquering all who oppose

Resistance of reverence
Will cost you unbearable pain
Exalt in our presence or fall by our wrath
The front lines are the first to be slain

Kneel before us for there is no hope
Benighted by immortal power
Decline our wishes and all will be lost
Bound with the others who cower

Say what you will and bow to your master
Swallow your pride for it may save you from this disaster

We are violent, vile, disgraceful fiends
Awakened by greed and tragedy
Crawl away and know that we are fear
And judgement for the weak

We are creations of what you adore
Reveling in your self destruction
We must devour this world with unstoppable force
Conquering all who oppose

Kneel before us for there is no hope
Benighted by immortal power
Decline our wishes and all will be lost
Bound with the others who cower
Kneel before us for there is no hope
Benighted by immortal power
We are the wretched, the fallen ones
We are the bringers of ascending fire

Attack, vanquish the weak
Eradicate, but embrace their demise
This is forever
No more prayers

As the cowards prepare to defend
We overwhelm in a raging cascade of sin
Behold the threshold of never ending death
Beg for mercy with your last dying breath
This is forever
No more prayers
