[music by M. Pugh / lyrics by J. Harrell]

In armor we fight
Swords in hand
Ready to kill
No lives will be spared

The stench of betrayal
Our oath to the dead
Our honor to strong to break
Tonight they will pay

In armor we wait
Ready to fight
By blade they will fall
They will die by night

In armor they wait
Ready to die
I thirst for their blood
Vengeance is mine

Driving my blade though hearts of the weak
Knowing thats what I am
Ready to fight
Ready to kill
Knowing thats what I am
And the blood tastes sweet
Driving my blade through the hearts of the weak

The stench of betrayal
Our oath to the dead
Our honor to strong to break
Tonight they will pay

With no fear of heaven hell or who might die
We are dressed to kill for battle in the armor of the night

The stench of betrayal
Our oath to the dead
Our honor to strong to break
Tonight they will pay

No lives to be spared
