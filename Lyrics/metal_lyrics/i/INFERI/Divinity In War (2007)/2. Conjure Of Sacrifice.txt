[music by M. Pugh / lyrics by J. Harrell]

Take this life in place of those whose lives thats been forsaken
Don't repent for what you think you've done
Live life for yourself and not what they wish for you to become

Rise from your knees
Stare to the sky
Do not believe
Open your eyes

Take this life in place of those who have no choice
Embrace this honesty
Take this life in place of those who live life through impurity

A living sacrifice paid in blood
On display for the whole world to see

Slaughtered in my innocence
I'll rise to the occasion
Now take me into your embrace
Of wickedness and fear

A living sacrifice paid in blood
On display for the whole world to see

I'll give myself willingly
To be the sacrifice
Helping the world to see

Take this life in place of those who have no choice
Embrace this honesty
Take this life in place of those who live life through impurity
