[music by M. Pugh / lyrics by J. Harrell, M. Pugh]

I love the looks they make
Upon their faces, cringing and crawling away
Into the night I feast upon the flesh of man
Gripping ripping and gnawing away
Feeling my sanity decay

The moon pierces the sky
Transforming my flesh to this beast
My thirst grows
Gathering for this gruesome feast

The moonlight calls to me, evolves inside of me
As I transform into this creature deep within
This curse that passed to me shall plague you all
This midnight massacre will kill you all

I love the looks they make
Upon their faces, cringing and crawling away
Decay

And through the night and darkness
I consume everything in sight
Sinking my teeth into the weak and lesser man

The blood that runs through me
Will now run through you
I am the one that will put an end to you

The fear is running through you
Right down your spine
You'll feel it right before you die
I control you
I am the one and only that controls your soul
I am the god of gods inside
And you'll die when I die...

And through the night and darkness
I consume everything in sight
Sinking my teeth into the weak and lesser man

I love the looks they make
Upon their faces, cringing and crawling away
Into the night I feast upon the flesh of man
Gripping ripping and gnawing away
Feeling my sanity decay

The moonlight calls to me, evolves inside of me
As I transform into this creature deep within
This curse that passed to me shall plague you all
This midnight massacre will kill you all
