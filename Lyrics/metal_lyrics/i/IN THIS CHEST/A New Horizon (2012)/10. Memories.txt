Iâm angry dissatisfied
The feelings I try to hide
Haunt me - Every single night

Iâm lonely â time goes by
Iâm sorry - but cannot cry
What is - wrong with me?

Memories, memories
Memories of better days

Memories, memories
Memories of better days

Iâm dreaming - endless nights
Denying - that youâre right
Recalling â who I used to be

Iâm screaming furiously
Iâm begging - on my knees
For something â I will never reach

Times have changed
A burning wound
That always bleeds
That never heals
