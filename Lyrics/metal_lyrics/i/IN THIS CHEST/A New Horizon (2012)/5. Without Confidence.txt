You are afraid - of being yourself
Your spiritual abyss â is covered with leaves
Leaves from braches â that once were alive
Leaves full of life â dancing in the wind

Embracing the windâ¦

Every single emotion â means nothing to you
Times and moments â you went through

Never satisfied - with the things at hand
You sail your ships â to no-manâs-land

You are driven by - unquenchable thirst
To catch up with life â while youâre hunting ghosts

You carry your heart â underneath a coat
A heart full of doubts â full of remorse
A heart full of sorrow - that grows cold
A massive grindstone â that aches in your chest

That aches in your chest
