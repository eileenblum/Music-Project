Come on letâs goâ¦

You have a hard row to hoe
Youâre not alone â we care for you

Donât surrender without a fight
Your mum is there - all through the night

Donât give up â and never say die
Itâs still too early â to wave goodbye

You take the rough with the smooth
Weâre damn - proud of you

Donât let down your lads
Because they stick to you - like wax

You've got all your life
In front of you.

All your friends
Are waiting for you

We keep our fingers crossed
We wish you were hereâ¦with us.

We know you have big shoes to fill
Donât give up - and try to stem the tide

Aim for the good things in your life
Donât lose heart â donât lose your faith

Donât give up â and never say die
Itâs still too early â to wave goodbye

Come and spent some time with usâ¦
Cause we are missing you every dayâ¦
