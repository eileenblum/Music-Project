No need to disguise
We know our lies
We know our truth that hurts

No need to pretend
Weâre facing the end
Of the love â that we shared

How these stories carry on
Now that our past is gone
Every day I turn away
From a love thatâs in decay

Everything I could have done
Everything we lost and won
We are going separate ways
Forgetting all the dreadful days

All the dreadful daysâ¦

No need to complain
We know itâs in vein
We know our truth â that hurts

No need to be sad
Cause all we had
Are memories we share
