I`m waking up on the floor
With a burning headache like never before
Narcotized by alcohol
Iâm lying there - I canât move no more
Value memories on my mind
Iâm try to think of better times
Iâm alone and youâre not here
Youâre gone and Iâm left in fear

If I remembered yesterday
If I remembered where you stay
If I remembered what went wrong
Iâd try to change myself for you
I see your face before my eyes
I see you sad and I see you cry
I see everything â I did to you
I cannot belive - what I do
Alcohol has dimned my mind
You had enough of this sacrifice
Iâm alone and youâre not here
Youâre gone and Iâm left in fear
