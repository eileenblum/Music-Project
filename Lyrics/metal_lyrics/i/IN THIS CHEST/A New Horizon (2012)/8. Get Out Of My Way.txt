You live for the day
You never cared about
Anyone else than yourself

You cosy me along
You drop the veil
And stab me right in the back

Iâm fed up with you
On that you can be sure
I wipe the smirk of your faceâ¦you fucking moron

I clear the air
Mind my words

Get out of my way
Get out of my sight
I have a mind on my own

I have a lot to say â to say
I have my own way â own way

Cause I have a goal in my life
I know what I stand for
I donât give a shit about you
And what you think about me

Fuck off!
Fuck you!

From time to time
I ask myself
Why I turn my back on you

Your selfishness
Your carelessness
You are making me sick

Iâm feed up with you
On that you can be sure
I wipe the smirk of your faceâ¦you fucking moron

I clear the air
Mind my words

Get out of my way
Get out of my sight
I have a mind on my own

I have a lot to say â to say
I have my own way â own way

Cause I have a goal in my life
I know what I stand for
I donât give a shit about you
And what you think about me

Fuck off!
Fuck you!
