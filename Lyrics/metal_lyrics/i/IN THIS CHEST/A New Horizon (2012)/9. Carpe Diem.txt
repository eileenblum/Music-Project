You reflect â you think about your life
You donât know â if itâs worth to fight

You feel trapped â within a desperate world
You are scared â of all the things that hurt

Donât you see â that there is joy in life
All I see â are your desperate eyes

You bury your face â in your hands

Embrace the day - before itâs gone
Because tomorrow â might never come
Believe in your dreams â and make them come true

Use your time
Begin to turn
Carry on
Donât leave your life undone

You regret â your past and bygone times
Canât you see â that there is more in life

Donât give in â donât miss the light of day
Trust in you â and you will make your way

Canât you see â that there is joy in life
All I see â are your desperate eyes
