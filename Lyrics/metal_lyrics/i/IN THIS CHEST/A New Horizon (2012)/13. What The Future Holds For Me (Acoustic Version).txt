Are â you coming my way
Do you believe
In the things that is say?
In the things that I do?
Do you hear what Iâm trying to say?

What the future holds for me
All the things awaiting me
I am open for whatâs to come
Cause all my life has just begun

Now â I live
Now â I breathe
Now â I feel
Now I feel that Iâm alive

Now â I live
Now â I breathe
Now â I feel
Now I feel that Iâm alive

Are â you sharing my dream
Do you believe
That we will move on?
That we will be free
Do you hear what Iâm trying to say?
