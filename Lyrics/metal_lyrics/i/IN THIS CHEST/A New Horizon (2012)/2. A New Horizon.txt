This road has taken me
So Far from where I was before â before.

Moments of solitude
How many miles have passed â under my feet?
Under my feet

Moments of clarity
Without the shadow of a doubt
Beyond any doubt

You shelter me in your arms

Iâm heading for the horizon
I know â I can rely on you
Weâre walking â together â on this road â forever

Forever, forever
Forever and a day

You know whatâs on my mind
You know what I disguise
Youâve always been â my closet friend

All the time â you are near
You take away my fear
Everything that drags me down

When Iâm in desperate straits
You are the one who waits
Who welcomes me â with open arms

Mosh:

I want to reach â a new horizon
I want to find â my destiny
I want to reach â a new horizon
