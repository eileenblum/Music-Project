It was time - for change
I needed a break
From my life

I needed some time
On my own
To break away from my past

I went away I lost myself
I let go
Before I became absorbed in thoughts

All these miles of solitude
All these miles so far from home

In the endlessness of time
In the middle of nowhere

I found rest and inner peace
I found the one I was looking for

The one I was looking for

I got rid â of my thoughts
Of everything - that pulled me down

I needed some time
On my own
To break away from my past
