You left me alone - when I was in need
You let me down - when I was on my knees

You made me beg - you made me creep
You made me loose - and I canât stand the defeat

You made me feel â and I felt alive
You made me run â until we ran out of time

I canât say goodbye â without regret
Cause I still believe
In the love that we had

I remember the time
And all the moments we had
I remember your voice
And the words you said

I remember the touch
When I caressed your skin
Your sweet embrace
That took me in

I slipped into a state of neglect
I wasted my time with worthless affairs

I donât feel - Iâve no more feelings to give
I deluded myself that I donât need you no more

For hours I cried - no more tears to shed
I still feel alone when Iâm going to bed
