Letâs goâ¦
I have a hard - furrow to plough
I am past â my sell-by date
Time hangs heavy â on my hands

I deconstruct
Bygone days
Fragments of my past
Fragments of my pastâ¦

Save me
And take me away
Save me
Before I go astray

Save me
Iâm waiting the for the wind
To carry me
To carry me back home

My thoughts are floating
Like leaves in the air

All these thoughts
That burdened my soul

Are swept aside
While the pain steals away

I try to let go
And time will tell

The struggle comes - to an end
Iâm at the end â the end of my rope
The struggle comes - to an end

I behold
Distorted pictures
That made up my past
That made up my past
