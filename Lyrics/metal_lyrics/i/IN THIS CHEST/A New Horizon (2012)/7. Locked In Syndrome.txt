Motionless â I cannot move
I only recall â how it felt before

Confined to my bed â I cannot escape
I want to move on â all in vain

The passing days â are all the same
I want to move on â but I canât (shout)

Trapped in inactivity
My bodyâs locked my mind is free
My mind is free - Iâm paralyzed (shout)

All my thoughts are passing by
I want to leave but cannot die
I cannot die - Iâm paralyzed (shout)

Iâm counting hours
Iâm counting days

Locked in my body
I dream away

A glance to the left
A glance to the right
The world seems out of reach

Iâm feeling trapped
Inside of my head
But thereâ no way out

The passing days â are all the same
I want to move on â but I canât (shout)
