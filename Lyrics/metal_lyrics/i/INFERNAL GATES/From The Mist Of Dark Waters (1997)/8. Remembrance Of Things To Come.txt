With burning wings I fall, through the tranquil sky.
My sympathy is lost, beneath your throne.
"I Have walked a silent path of mournful dreams."
I... I sigh, is this all that will be?

Storm of evil at the gates of heaven.
Dark now rising, this will be forever.
Dreaming I see, I see your icon fall.
I have seen what will be.
Dreaming...... I see a land divine.
I have seen what will be.

A season-ending wind...

We shall be found, the lies will cease forever.
With darkened eyes I fail to see your Eden.
Life is fading, time shall release me.

I drink the blood-red wine of empty souls.
I walk through misty halls, I await the dawn.
"I have seen the deepest void where the wind is old."
I... I sigh, is this all that will be?

Storm of evil at the gates of heaven.
Dark now rising, this will be forever.
Dreaming I see, I see your icon fall.
I have seen what will be.
Dreaming...... I see a land divine.
I have seen what will be...
