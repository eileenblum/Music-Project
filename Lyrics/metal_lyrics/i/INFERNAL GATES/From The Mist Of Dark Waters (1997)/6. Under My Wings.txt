- A void unsealed - (Stefan Sundholm)

Horizon...
On the shore of the sea of illusion I stand.
Alone I stand.
Lost ages ride the waves of the dark cold waters.
Eternally...

Incessant echoes of choirs proclaiming what will be.
Monuments faded and forgotten.
Landscapes of a coming epoch, a frozen and dark existence.
The distant dying sun now extincts forever!!!

Black storms, dark nights, black eyes in the darkened sky.
Dancing under a shimmering moon, I discern the starlit horizon.

Now near dawn, with silence the mist dispersing.
The last leaves has fallen, the whispers of the forest is dead forever.
A tranquil shadow of frost confines me.
Darkness entices, I'm entering a night without end.

Black storms, dark nights, black eyes in the darkened sky.
Dancing under a shimmering moon, I discern the starlit horizon.

The bells of the past has rusted.
Awakened by a holy and twisted moaning.

Unbound in the valley of tomorrow.
Sanctuary found in another time.
Like a silver tear my soul shines on the starlit sky.
Nevermore alone...

Black storms...
Black storms, dark nights, black eyes in the darkened sky.
Dancing under a shimmering moon, I discern the starlit horizon.
