I remember falling rain as the black birds spread their wings.
My soul was mourning by the lake and the angel fled the wolf.
I could hear the forest sing from my December grave.
Saw my bride forlorn in tears then daylight left my eyes...

Night... Godly death... Beautiful landscapes unseen.
Stars, glowing... Dark are the hours I breathe.
I am........ the son of ancient gloom.

I walk to see the sun, in the kingdom of my father.
I find myself at ease, in the shadow of the dragon.
Black candles at my funeral feast, feeding all the flames of death.
In this castle loneliness will breed, again...

Reach the sea of tragedy where all the rivers run.
Enchanting songs from ghastly shapes. The moonlit water is still.
The crying sculpture on my throne holds everlasting grief.
Silence of the nightingale will always grasp my heart.

Night... Godly death... Beautiful landscapes unseen.
Stars, glowing... Dark are the hours I breathe.
I am........ the son of ancient gloom.

I walk to see the sun, in the kingdom of my father.
I find myself at ease, in the shadow of the dragon.
Black candles at my funeral feast, feeding all the flames of death.
In this castle loneliness will breed, again...

The ocean of pure sadness is my burden...
Now the time of my last farewell, I have no regrets.
