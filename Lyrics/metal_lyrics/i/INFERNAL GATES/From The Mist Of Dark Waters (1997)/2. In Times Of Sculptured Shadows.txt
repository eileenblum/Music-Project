- In times of sculptured shadows - (Stefan Sundholm)

On the mountains shadows lay heavy.
On it's walls symbols of frost.
A voice of knowledge filled the sky.
Tales of gateways so dark, (gateways so dark).

The moon reigns this land once bright.
The veil of goodness is broken.
Unnamed empires of silver light.
Beneath a welcoming winter night.

Reflections of a sweeping wind
throwing shades on this crystal creation.
A hymn to the stillness of night.
I wish this world were thine.

Oh, how sad a grieving heart.
A sorrowing shadow stood.
Weeping yielded spirit.
Enraptured by compassion.

Now the myth of eternal light has vanished
with the last rays of the sun.
Embraced were the shadows growing still.
By the mist of our heart, not tempted by light...

Reflections of a sweeping wind
throwing shades on this crystal creation.
A hymn to the stillness of night.
I wish this world were thine.
