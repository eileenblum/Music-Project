- Ember of illusions - (Jonas Gustafson)

"Within these walls... I decipher
the ember of illusions."

Yearn, for the dream that will prevail.
Oh, all the tears and all the thorns.

Where chanting angels dance...
with feathers so darkly grey.
When daylight brings it's glare...
they swiftly move away.

Yearn, for the dream that will prevail,
for all the tears and all these thorns.
