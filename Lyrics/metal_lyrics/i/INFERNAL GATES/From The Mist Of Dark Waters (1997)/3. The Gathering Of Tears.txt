Winds, I'm forever lost.
Tears what is left to be seen?
My god, my god, what will I become?
I see no light...

Like a dying flower, in the season of grey.
Like the northern wind, in the land of dreams.
Like a solemn figure, in falling snow.
Like a bleeding statue... I lose my faith!!!

I hear a serenade...
But why this bitter end?
Why...?

"With mourning eyes I gather tears."
Through this veil of thorns I fail to see...
what I believe!!!
A calling to a darker time.

"I stand in the gloominess in this stream of pain.
Dark tears leave my eyes as I watch the sunset."

Who will guide my shadow, to the burning sky?
Who will be my voice, when I speak no more?
Who will ease this burden, when all grief is gone?
Who will watch the night, where I belong...?

I hear a serenade...
But why this bitter end?
Why...?
Winds, I'm forever lost.
Tears what is left to be seen?
