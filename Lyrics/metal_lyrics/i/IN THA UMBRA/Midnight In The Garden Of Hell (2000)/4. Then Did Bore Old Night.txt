Of giant pasturage lying at ease
Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray
And did lights father forever cease
Play the lyre Oh Pan play!
Of sunken suns at eve, at noon of Night
While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light
Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile
And armed flanks to war worthwhile
Nursled the young mountain in it's lair
Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall
A dome, by linked light in purple air
Adorning with the dwellings o' fall
For beauty' s grave
And every sculptur'd cherub thereabout
Shall not be save
In the burning Erebus' lakes shall sprout
Witness the murmur of the grey twilight in Eyraco
Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim
There in the cold, in the shadow
Sees the darkness coming as a cloud's whim
'tis the rush of wings
Ho maiden in the twilight sky adorn'd
Thus gather'd dusk sings
Litanies of nightfall perform'd
Night
...Then Did Bore Old Night
Up rose the scythed maiden in the Night
The single mooned eve!-on Earth to plight
And one moon adore
Up rose the maiden from her shrine o' flowers once more
And bent o'er sheeny mountains and dim plain
But left not yet Therasaen reign
And it did rain forever...
Huldras and Gorgonas and headless Medusa reborn
Thundering chords in damnation's symphonie
Burnt through the oracle of twilight forlorn
Of old Night as lightning... six... times three
Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang
In many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell;
Glance thro' the shade and thunder sprang
Encumber'd with dew, hath drawn and thus fell
The dew of the Night
Capriciously still, harmony in delight
Incumbent on light
The sound of the rain
Which leaps down benight
The music of things that spring pain
Clad in storms, alas!
Night
...Then Did Bore Old Night
Midnight on the draperied wall
How drowsily it weigh'd into Night !
But O that light!-slumber'd at the hall
Agoniz'd clung around in fright
Imparts the myth
Even the glowing bosom beats withal,
Amid a Night of mirth
And when old Night did disenthral
A red Daedalion on the timid Earth
Cronos unfurl'd as light waned and waned
Enchanted halls presented lady Death
And so thy star trembl'd...
...Then Did Bore Old Night
