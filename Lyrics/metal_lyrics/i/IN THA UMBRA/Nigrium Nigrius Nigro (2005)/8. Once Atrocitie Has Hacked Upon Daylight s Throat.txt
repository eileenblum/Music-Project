Torn, hacked and slashed
Painted from within as brushes to detune
Hordes of the firmament cumming nails as heavy rain
Bright sun extinguish'd as the stars did wander darkling
Rayless, pathless and disfigured
Thus swung blind and blackening in the moonless air
Morn came, with no day to forget it's passions in the dread
Of heavenly desolation dwelling beneath the throne of atrocity
Consumed, detached within the eye
Set on fire with malice clad, so hacked fell and faded
Torn, hacked and deeply sliced
The feeble ashes and breath both remnants of the rayless ra
Atrocity with open wings
And all was black upon the hacked throat of daylight
Unearthly darkned flashes ruin the despairing sun
And both gods and angels hid their eyes and therefore wept
"funeral piles with fuels with mad disquietude on the dull sky
Malice gnash'd it's teeth and howled as daylight terrified did shriek
Flutter'd on the ground and flapped it's useless wings..."
Once atrocitie has hacked upon daylight's throat
Tame and tremulous, hissing stingless
Crawled and twined to be slain by blackned atrocity
And war did glut the sun to gorge in gloom
Atrocity famine fed upon daylight's entrails
And it's meagre rays were gloriously devoured
Raped, torn and grimly hacked
Void and seasonless, and that was death
A chaos of hard clay once atrocity whets the scythe
"...The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,
The moon their mistress had expired before;
The winds were withered in the stagnant air,
And the clouds perish'd; darkness had no need
Of aid from them - she was the universe"
