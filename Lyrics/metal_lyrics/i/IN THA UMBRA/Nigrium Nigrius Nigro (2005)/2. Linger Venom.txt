And I will bring thee where no light stays
Inequality, narcissus
Ominously innocent vanity
And thence be summoned
Like consort to thyself cans?t nowhere find
Auspicious, prune to th'expanse of heav'n
Thiter went
Under a shade of flowers multitudes like oneself poisoned
Against the eastern gate of paradise levell'd his evening rays
"of alabaster, pil'd up to the clouds,
Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent
Acessible from earth, one entrance high:"
And shed sumissive flowers
Juno smiles no longer and impregnates the sickness
Jupiter charms
Sight hateful. sight tormenting
Imparadis't to one another's arms
And bliss to hell be thrust
"betwixt th'unarmed guards awayting the night
Celestial armoury, shields, helms and spears,
Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold,
Thiter came uriel, gliding through the even
On a sunbeam, swift as a shooting star"
Fierce desire, with pain of longing pines
Forbidden to taste
The paladar of the bane that shadowed light
Linger the venom sombre
Corrupt harmonie, tenebrae
Linger venom
Senses of ruin flaming the destructive act
Thwarts the night, when vapours fir'd
Impress the air, in compass to beware
Yon flow'ry arbours manuring ungrowth
"silence accompanied, for beast and bird,
They to their grassy couch, these to their nests
Were slunk, all but the watchful nightingale:"
And I will bring thee destruction
Descant, narcissistic
Ominously melodious disaster
And invoke thence the beast
The consort th'hour declaring manifestation
Slumb'rous, prune to th'elimination of light
Eyelids in closure
In utmost disgraceful sights
Where heav'n and hell meet through
Earth and ocean, corrupt by the venom that lingers
Weight inclines poisoned
Envenomed body of light - nigrium nigrius nigro
Disharmonic diapason dissonant
Sombre and corrupt - tenebrae, linger venom
