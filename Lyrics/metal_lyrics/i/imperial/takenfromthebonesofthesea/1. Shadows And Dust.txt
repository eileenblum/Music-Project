I' am heir to a throne of power
Man of a thousand lies
Son to a murdered father
Who died under my own knife

I have lust in my eyes for power
Seeking the face of the gods
Breaking the will of many
Using my sharpened tongue
I betray the men around me
Not by my own sword
I' am a man in need of power
And I always crave for more

Smile for me my brother won't you share my smile

I feel your corpse stop breathing
We are but shadows and dust

I' am heir to a throne of power
Man of a thousand lies
Son to a murdered father
Who died under my own knife

I have lust in my eyes for power
Seeking the face of the gods
Breaking the will of many
Using my sharpened tongue
I betray the men around me
Not by my own sword
I' am a man in need of power
And I always crave for more

Smile for me my brother won't you share my smile

I am the fire in your soul
the serpent calling your name
Ready yourself for my embrace
