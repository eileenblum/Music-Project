we are all washing away, onto a shore that has no name
i was told not to kill
but i will
if you step up to me 
rain blood on me
for i cannot see
in fear, i'm not leaving, i left, goodbye
this second chance was my last
i was told not to kill
but i will
if you step up to me
we are washing away onto a shore that has no name
without hope
i took my weapon
without love
i spelled your name in blood
desire
for nothing more
but to destory what's in me
and rest my head
desire
to leave you nothing
and wash my feet
i don't wanna die
in fear, i'm not leaving, i left, goodbye
trapped here without a hope
treading across the sand
resting against the rocks
feeding on the skin you shed
