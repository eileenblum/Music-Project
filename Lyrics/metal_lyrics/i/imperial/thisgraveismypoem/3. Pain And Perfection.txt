bring us down
you try and try
never giving up
bring us down
you are relentless
just another machine
bring us down
clap on clap off
just another machine
with your armored suit
and that pretty face
your life's a waste of time
you will be shut out
keep thinking its alright
you brought this on yourself
your joy was hating us
we will steal your smile
no more lies
sail away
with all your crooked smiles
sail away
go hide behind your friends
bring us down
you try and try
never giving up
bring us down
you are relentless
just another machine
bring us down
