day in, day out
a burden on me
a gasp for breath is all i need
your beautiful words were not enough
in ashes i leave to find my peace
breathe you in
one last time
hold you in
you were mine
die
pull this rope tighter
hang here covered in hame
in ashes
leave to find my peace
you
take me
without love
take my hand
carry me
take my life kill me
