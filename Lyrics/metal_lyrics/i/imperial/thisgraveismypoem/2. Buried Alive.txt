buried alive
we found you drowning
in your own tears
we must have lost touch
we found you drowning in your tears
lost without a place to go
we found you drowning in your tears
(in your tears, we found you)
run away
from all of this hate
buried alive
we found you drowning
in your own tears
we must have lost touch
in faith
we are standing
covered in his blood
covered in our loves blood
broken therefore
covering our sins
the pain lasts, long
remove this sterile blade
and stand by me
bury, the simple things
(your beauty)
and ask these questions
(it breaks me, breaks me softly)
are you alright
(your beauty)
can you take this
(it breaks me, breaks me softly)
will you, step up and prove yourself
