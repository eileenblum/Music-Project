I march into battle with the front lines
In this war of faceless souls I am ready to die
With fire in my step
No fear of man
We will not be overthrown
We will cast the final stone

I wage my life (for my cause)
I'm willing to die (for my cause)

We will cast the first stone in defiance
Lying breathless in defeat we will leave you
Our candles burn till light
We are the fearless ones

We set sail at dawn
This is a call to arms

We drown out our fears
Not bound by you, this war is now
We come with swords drawn

We sail at dawn

We set sail on seas of blood
With cannons armed as darkness falls
