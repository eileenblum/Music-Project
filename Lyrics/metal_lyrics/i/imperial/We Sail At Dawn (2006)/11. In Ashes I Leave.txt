Day in day out
A burden on me
A gasp for breath is all I need

Your words were not enough
In ashes I leave to find my peace
Your words beautiful were not enough
In ashes I leave to find my peace

Breathe you in one last time
Hold you in
You were mine [x2]

Pull this rope tighter
I hang here covered in shame [x5]

In ashes I leave to find my peace [x4]

Take me without love
Take my hand
Bury me
Take my life
Kill me
