The air is stale tasteless night
No god dwells here only those who survive
We found you here with no meaning
Your body broke, lifeless
No easy bargain would be made in that place

The misery of a father that has seen his son's corpse
(swing from the gallows) waiting where he hangs
Remember hell

Rest your head you have not deserved
The images of hell

Pulling iron from his chest
(his life flashes before his eyes)

The first light they strike
Bodies pile so high
The fire burns bright

Heaven swallows the smoke [x2]
