We can change
There is nothing good to say about a massacre
Grant me serenity to accept what was

Courage to change the things I can
Wisdom to always tell the difference

All races
All colors
One future

Please be advised against the blood that resides within
Baby make a way for our color blind generation
(everything was beautiful and nothing hurt)
(no more salt poured on this gaping wound)

We cannot change the past so we make way for our future

Take a trip into the cellar of a slaughterhouse
The children still, the women in line
The smell of blood haunts this room
