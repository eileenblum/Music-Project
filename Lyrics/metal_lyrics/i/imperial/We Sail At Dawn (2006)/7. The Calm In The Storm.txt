These petals falling
Your eyes are all I see
As we plan out our lives
You're why I survived

I claim my prize
I take my own [x2]

As the rain pours down I will stand and smile
As my sorrows are gone when I gaze into your eyes
As the rain pours down you don't stop holding me
You keep me dry through the storm
You are my peace [x3]

All my demons released
The have no gold on me
Rain turns to snow
You still stand by me
