Blood and supreme virtues burn in this long and intense night in which good and evil fight for the
Absolute Truth
Now has been fulfilled the fate of an ephemeral past (that will return)
Ghosts and shadows dwell in this immense walls
...and to them they dedicate all their ardour
Pride and courage flow in this prime and ancient battle
To it they grant eternal life
An old and ancestral rite has been celebrated in this grandiose, fatal place
Is the end and the beginning of a great dream that none has accepted
Or is it an ancient story?
And there!
Grow power and energy
Destiny is now born...with it...all of us...generated in an instant in the immense and Abolute Bulwark
To be granted of eternal life
