...Sad roundabout...as life passes by
Lost thoughts melted with my memories
...and my passions...and my aspirations...
...all gone...
as the roundabout turns around
Like a child laughing and crying in the shadows of a life spent in ignorance
A great void surrounds me while she entangles and absorbs my mind
Unaware of our condition...silent...we stroll in the garden of sadness and desperation
Now...a passing life will lead to another
...And our futile tears are balm drops lost in the stream of life
...And our painful thoughts are dead leaves brought away by the wind
But now I must go away, far from this perenial wheel...
that will turn eternally...driven be each of our stories
