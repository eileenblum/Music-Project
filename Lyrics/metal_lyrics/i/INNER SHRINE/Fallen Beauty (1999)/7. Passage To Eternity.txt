Dark and tearing...the sound of a world that irradiate my dimension
Melancholy and sadness...behind the veil of this old Earth without hope
This entity approaches me and grazes my life
Destiny attracts it to a new birth
Obscurity and anguish dissolve and with them the distance between the two bodies
A wake of wisdom and purity envelopes the celestial encounter to seal an ancient and arcane joining

The passage is open...with it the hope of all grief's end
My life spent in a moment and my wishes all broken

My false hopes are crumbled in the dust...this presence is finally gone
It will proceed with the comet and lets me alone with its thick wake of tears and passions
