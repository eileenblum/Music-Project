In every time and shadow
In every time of our lives
I'm on the road to nowhere
I'm far away so I
I'm living to pray
Every day goes to the line
In the same circle of time

Every time a light
Every time in our lives
The wind brings to me the scent of a moment eternal
I'm far away so I
I'm living to pray
In the memory of a man who walks alone

In every time and body
In every time of our lives
I see the sand all over, all over my way
I'm far away so I
I'm living to pray
In the memory of a veil I can't send no more away

"We are such stuff as dreams are made on"
[W. Shakespeare]
