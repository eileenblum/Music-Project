Garden of loneliness and silence,
Embrace the last days of the woman
Who most of all loved beauty.

Green Room, in the House of Silence
Let her sleep in a cradle of flowers
She will be the last of her breed...

After her only few will open their eyes
And see the veil of light

Today the blind lead the blind
And together they'll fall in the abyss.
Today the deaf speak for the truth they think to hear
And the ones who believe in them will fall in the abyss.

May the lights of Art show the inner path of knowledge.

Green Room, in the House of Silence
Let her sleep in a cradle of dreams.
