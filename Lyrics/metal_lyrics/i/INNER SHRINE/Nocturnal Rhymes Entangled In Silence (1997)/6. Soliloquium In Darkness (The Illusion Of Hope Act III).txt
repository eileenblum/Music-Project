Light... no more.
I'll feel... the embrace.
I crawl inside where nonsense reigns.
Where lies the self?
Where lies the end? A crippled mind in a pale shell.

Night... how deep it seems to me.
How long's my death! How long's my agony!
I wait... I crave for something
that can set me free...
that will make me feel... make me be.

Emotionless... only asleep.
I sense strange beings that graze my skin.

Crawl... inside.
Torture... my self.
Hurt... my hands.
Lick... my flesh.
