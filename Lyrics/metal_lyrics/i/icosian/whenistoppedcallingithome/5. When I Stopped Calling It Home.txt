The humans have grown too proud
They will be the death of themselves
Only another solar system
Will save them now

It's time to leave your home
Abandon all you've known
This will be our last goodbye

We have fought to survive for so long
We forgot what it means to belong
And this reignâs lasted far too long

We are but satellites
Lost betwixt space and time
We are but satellites
Drifting with no end in sight

We've only scratched the surface
Of what progress can find
But have we manufactured
Our own demise?

We can start again
Somewhere new
Is my child to blame
For all I've done?

We have fought to survive for so long
We forgot what it means to belong
And this reignâs lasted far too long

Our time has come
Our time has come

Waiting to turn the tide
Waiting to turn back time
Awaken collective mind
Waiting with open arms
