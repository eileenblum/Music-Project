They remain hiding in the shadows
Thatâs where they've always shone the brightest

Fallen from grace, angels with blackened wings
Plant sinister intention in the weak of heart
Ideas multiply and infect those minds
Perverse desires detached from society
Detached from society

Devoid of humanity
The world it burns beneath their feet
Pathetic crippled souls, who let darkness envelop
Their unfathomably empty hearts

Are we meant to know, have we lost our way?
Have we been failed by those
Prophets who swore theyâd lead the way?
Can we truly defeat
Those committed to hate?
Their words paint portraits of decay

Destroyed without a trace
Annihilate, defeat of the human race

Conscious without conscience we fall

We will fall as one

Devoid of humanity
The world it burns beneath their feet
Pathetic crippled souls, who let darkness envelop
Their unfathomably empty hearts
