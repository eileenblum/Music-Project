Iâm drowning myself
Behind empty fucking smiles
And false alibis
Crush my throat
Break my spine
There is no escape from what is yours
It's almost time

I am not a prophet but look me in the eyes
And donât think for a second I won't end your life

We donât need our revenge
Weâre keeping you our fucking secret
