Weâre all divorced from reality
Mental deficiencies have made us blind

We've come too far
To let the wheels of progress come
Grinding down to a halt

Will you stand?
Or be trampled under
The crushing weight of their demands

Path to perdition
Did we lose ourselves along the way?

So let us bathe in the blood of deceit
And let us drink from the spring of hate

We cannot lose hope
And when we call out our fallen brothers' names
We will be the hope
For those who have lost the will to carry on

Blood will fill the streets
Of innocent and guilty alike
We will drown their regime

Hope is never lost
Don't you ever lose sight
Lose sight

We cannot lose hope
And when we call out our fallen brothers' names
We will be the hope
For those who have lost the will to carry on

We cannot lose hope
We will not lose hope
