Death embrace me
Dispossess this pain
Plagued; eternally abandoned
Tortured by an overwhelming silence
Madness
Madness
Suffering forever
The cold touch of death
Beckons me; I gripe for the end beneath my breath
I'm choking. I'm unable to speak
I can't swallow my words
Incoherent thoughts
My vision is blurred
Why won't this stop
The lesson is learned
Help me
Kill me
This mental crucifixion
Has left me completely hollow
I can't find my way out, and even if I did
I'd have no path to follow
My dismembered thoughts are only getting worse
Death embrace me
Dispossess this pain
End my life and lift this curse
I whither within my hollow tomb
Scorned by pain. My sanity consumed
Pain
