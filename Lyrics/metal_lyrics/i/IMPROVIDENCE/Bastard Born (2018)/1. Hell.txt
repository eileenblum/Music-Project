What the fuck is there to miss
A land of sorrow and worthless shit
Veins that flood from the needle
Or the daggers hiding in the back of love
Twisted tongues hiding behind crooked teeth
Or the fucked and broken dreams
I, the bastard child
Now the dead man
I, the bastard child
Now the dead man
My innocence has broken free
Vacant, entombed in agony
I can not foresee the future
For I am already dead
Disappointment overwhelms me
Floating face down without a sea
No one to love; no tears
There is nothing here.
Hell
This world is hell
Seduced; forever scorned
Born in ruins
Born in ruins
I can't fucking take this
I can't fucking take this
Rooted in the void, I begin to grow numb
Stripping my right, my right to happiness
Knowing nothing of what I once was
Just let me fucking die
