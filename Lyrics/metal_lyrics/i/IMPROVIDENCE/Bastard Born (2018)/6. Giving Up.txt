Life hasn't found a way to kill me yet
Consumed in a way of constant dread
I give up
I can't find purpose
I remain alive with nothing to stand beside
Most find this as paradise
I don't see the twisted image that's in their eyes
I can't see the light
Hidden in a world of darkened clouds
I've grown tired of the torment
Pushing me to my limits
Pushing me
I can't see the light
Grey trees on rotting hills
Restless I falter
Pushed my limits
Unable to stand
On my own
Constantly losing sleep
No touch of sanity
I can't fucking think straight
I don't get it
I don't understand
I don't know why I even fucking try
I'm just fucked, I'm just waiting to die
No will to live
I'm giving, I've given up
No will to live
I've given up
I am the darkness
I am the negligence
Bound to my knees I've accepted my defeat
Chisle my name and inscribe the dates
Collect the rubble and build a monument of my life
Abolish me from this forsaken plane
My veins swell with anger
My focus fades, blood-lust and rage
My veins swell with anger
Sowing the seeds of violence
Sealing my coffin with my own tainted blood.
Once the bastard child, forever the dead man
Never rendering the emptiness
But slowly becoming the shadows
A man without salvation
Forever convicting myself
I stumble towards nothingness
I'm falling
I'm giving in
Witness my collapse
Watch my shadow disappear
I've grown tired
I'm tired of getting back up
