Desolated to a realm of destitute.
It's pathetic how this is all because of you
Gave up on sanity and peace of mind
Fantasies of suffering and violence is what's left behind
More baggage than I can carry at this point
So my thoughts spiral into this hateful void
Years of agonizing compromise
Wasted words giving way to dead eyes
Barren fields of memory; nothing will grow
Broken shards of empathy; your legacy bestowed
The tips of the daggers driven into my spine
It's the same as last and the time before that
Not enough of me left in tact
Disconnected from this shit world
Wasted words
Emptiness
Wasted breath
Nothing left
Gave up on sanity
Gave up on peace of mind
Making my fingers bleed
Digging up the strength to do what's right
Dirt under my nails
Adding more skeletons to my closet tonight
You wanted to find love hidden away
My heart is nothing but decay
My memories are dead
Shards broken further
When I exist in your head
Bite your fucking tongue
Shackled no longer,
I now live free.
Ties severed in two,
Free of memory.
Don't expect me to recognize you
