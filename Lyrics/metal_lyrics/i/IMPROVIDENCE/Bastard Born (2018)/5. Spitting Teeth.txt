Revoking your abuse
Your defeat is absolute
Submerge yourself in what you deny
Self ruin blackens your eyes
Guilt shrouds your face
Knowing nothing but a bitter taste.
Compelled to an ever luring sickness
Adopting a new sight of weakness
You've lost yourself
Fantasizing empty aspirations
You've lost yourself
Penetrating your skin to fill the void
You've lost yourself
The queen of salt pawned her crown
Traded away her throne
For poison that buries within
The marrow of her bones
Corrupted mind, decaying flesh
Exhaling the chemicals you manifest
Corrupted mind, decaying flesh
Exhaling the chemicals you manifest
Feast until you bleed
Fulfill your selfish needs
Scar your body with the mark of salt
Captivated by substance
Lost in a sea of temptation
Your cries have peaked through the mountains
The scars are persistent
Why the fuck won't you listen
Denial of affliction
Torn by addiction
We will not salvage what we have lost
I have no patience for the your words
Your cries have been well heard
Just another plea to take
The damage is done
You hold your own fucking fate
Salt queen, you're just spitting teeth
Royalty exposed
Exposed.
Sickening; a junkies grin
Salt queen, you're rotting within
The echo of your deafening scream
Eternally haunts my dreams
