No worth, no hope
Raise your voice; choke
Submission of your free will, there are no equals
Unadulterated hatred of all people
Timeless hate; divided race
One sided debates, one two headed snake
Bullshit rhetoric, always changing face
A racist fucking liar
A fucking disgrace
Dragged through the street lifeless
Paraded for all the world to see
Nothing more than a spectacle
The media will make examples of us all
Our voices have no value
Step out of line and pay with your life
Black, red, white, and blue
Nothing but pawns forced to pick a side
If you protest someone will turn it into a riot
If you organize a movement someone will divide it
Speak your mind your peers will denounce it
Vote noone cares and noone will count it
Paralyzed
Terrorized by the power they wield
Leveling the playing field
Paralyzed
Crippled by excessive force
Terrorized
Skewed morality taking its deadly course
Blinded nation preaching eye for an eye
Social justice at a steady decline
Dragged through the street lifeless
Paraded for all the world to see
Nothing more than a spectacle
The media will make examples of us all
Castration of the common man
Systematically bastardized
Each and everyone of us fucked from very the beginning
Bodied
Beaten to death in the name of the law
