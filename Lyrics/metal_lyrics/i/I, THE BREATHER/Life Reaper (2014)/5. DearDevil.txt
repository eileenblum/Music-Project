With these thoughts on my mind, I'll never sleep
With this pain so deep, I'll be dead before they find me
Devil, devil, devil
I'll be dead before they find me

You held the thoughts in the back of your spine
Feeding me hope for something I would never find
You know they say "the strong survive"? (The strong survive)
I won't stop at anything, for you to have a painful ending
I'm "pathetic" (pathetic)
You're the "heartless" (the heartless)
I'm a "trainwreck" (a trainwreck)
You're the "heartless"

When you look into the eyes
Does the rain fall through the deep blue skies?
Are you too blind to see, you're just a devil?

With these thoughts on my mind, I'll never sleep
With this pain so deep, I'll be dead before they find me
Devil, devil, devil
I'll be dead before they find me

I'll never sleep, with this pain so deep
There is no place to shake this agony
No way to break these chains
It's in my heart you see
There is no way to save my life
When I'm sleeping next to the devil at night

I'm "pathetic" (pathetic)
You're the "heartless" (the heartless)
I'm a "trainwreck" (a trainwreck)
You're the "heartless"

When you look into your eyes
Does the rain fall through the deep blue skies?
Are you too blind to see, you're just a devil?

With these thoughts on my mind, I'll never sleep
With this pain so deep, I'll be dead before they find me
Devil, I'm sleeping next to the devil at night
Devil, I'm sleeping next to the devil at night
Devil, I'm sleeping next to the devil at night
Devil, I'm sleeping next to the devil at night
