Don't you go and leave me here
All alone in this sick dark world
I've got these demons to fight
They make we weak and I can't do this all alone

I've fallen oh so far
But if you leave me right now
I won't, I won't, I won't make it out

This isn't all about you
This isn't, this isn't all about you
Despite what you think or what you've been through
This isn't all about you

Don't you go and leave me here
Don't you, don't you go!

You blame yourself, you get depressed
You pull yourself down till no one's around
But you stay right here, you cling to the past
You could sit and wait forever but we need you back

And in a moment time stood still
In one single moment time stands still

You take the edge, hold it against your veins
Time stands still
Think about your actions, everyone's reactions
There's so many others that love you
If you were gone
Would time stand still?
If this were me and you were in my place
Would time stand still for you?

I know this world is such a dark, dark place
(Dark, dark place)
But if you leave right now, you'll never find your peace
I know this world is such a dark, dark place
(Dark, dark place)
But if you leave right now, you'll never find your peace

You blame yourself, you get depressed
You pull yourself down till no one's around
But you stay right here, you cling to the past
You could sit and wait forever but we need you back
You blame yourself, you get depressed
You pull yourself down till no one's around
But you stay right here, you cling to the past
You could sit and wait forever but we need you back

We need you back!

Don't you go
You're tearing us apart when you blame yourself
Don't you go
You stay right here, we need you here
Don't you go
You're tearing us apart when you blame yourself
Don't you go
You will stay right here, we need you here
We need you!
