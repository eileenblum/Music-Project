We are the light
We are the fire
We are the setting sun

So sick, so sick of living with no purpose
So sick of greed, of pigs, of everyone's complacency

You built these walls to hold us down
Why don't you come down from your throne?
Watch them fall to the ground

[2x]
We will claim victory
You can't defeat us

You can't defeat us

Brick by brick, piece by piece
We'll arm ourselves with the walls that you've made
Brick by brick, piece by piece
We will claim victory

[2x]
We are the light
We are the fire
We are the setting sun

You built these walls to hold us down
Why don't you come down from your throne?
Watch them fall to the ground

We will rise
Take the throne
You will fall to your knees
You will fall to your knees

Born in the land of the heartless
Bound by the chains of the soulless
Our years as slaves, behind us victorious

Brick by brick, piece by piece
We will claim victory

[2x]
We are the light
We are the fire
We are the setting sun

[2x]
We will claim victory
You can't defeat us

You can't defeat us
