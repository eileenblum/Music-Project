I'm here to put you in your place
I will bury you
I will bury you

Forgive? Forget?
I laugh at the thought of that
Yeah, you better run
You will regret the day you betrayed me and your "family"

If the world could see who you are
Would you run, would you run?
You've lost your heart, you've gone too far
Look what you've become, you've become

I saw the glimpse in your eyes (a killer in disguise)
I saw the smirk on your face (you love the pain you create)
I saw the aftermath (aftermath) of your "blood bath"

Six feet underneath, a bloody history
Six feet underneath, destroy your legacy

If the world could see who you are
Would you run, would you run?
You've lost your heart, you've gone too far
Look what you've become, you've become
I could turn this all around
'Cause I don't want to be like you (be like you)
But I know this is something I have to do

I will take you and all the things that you've done
Make you wish you never saw another "setting sun"
With your neck under my knee
And my arm raised high
Someone's gonna die

Forgive? Forget?
I laugh at the thought of that
Yeah, you better run
You will regret the day you betrayed me and your "family"

Six feet underneath, a bloody history
Six feet underneath, you never cared for forgiveness
