This is not right
Thinking everything's OK when it's not
This has got to end
We fell so many times
How much longer can we fake it?
This has got to end
This has got to end

We're rotting in filth
With no one to blame
We're not machines
This is such a shame
(Such a shame)

We can't fake what we never had
Follow the road and never look back
"Search for a better life," they said
We're all searching for a better life, a better life
Will it be alright? We wanna know
When will it end? When will it end?
Constantly on the run, what have we become?
Will it be alright?
We wanna know:
When will it end? When will it end?

I will find hope, I will kill pain
I will kill the thought of loneliness
We will find a home, we will kill the hate
We will kill the heartless
Will we get it right?

Thinking everything's OK when it's not
This has got to end
We fell so many times
How much longer can we fake it?
This has got to end

We can't fake what we never had
Follow the road and never look back
"Search for a better life," they said
We're all searching for a better life, a better life
Will it be alright? We wanna know
When will it end? When will it end?
Constantly on the run, what have we become?
Will it be alright? We wanna know
When will it end? When will it end?

I will fight for you, if you will fight for me
I will die for you, if you will die for me
This blood is true you see
The only thing we have left is our family
We will rise, overcome
Now is our time
We will rise and conquer
Everything this world ever stood for

I will fight for you, if you will fight for me (fight for me)
This blood is true you see
I will die for you, if you will die for me (die for me)
We will rise, overcome
Now is our time
We will rise and conquer
Everything this world ever stood for
