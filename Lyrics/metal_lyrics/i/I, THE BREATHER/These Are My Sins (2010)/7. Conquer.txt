Wake Up
We have run this place like animals for 200 thousand years
When will we fight for the right and not for greed!?
Lord I want to see
"A world full of love and full of peace"
But I cant even open my eyes
When will we fight for the right and not for greed!?
When will we conquer the hate that comes from our teeth!?
I will live my life accordingly
To the ones I'm willed to please
We don't even know our names
These fields with crosses
They're filled with wine
Is it me or is this picture not clear?
They have graced with their presence of naivety
You people fly like birds across the sky
In every direction not knowing why
Lord I want to see
"A world full of love and full of peace"
But I cant even open my eyes
But I still breathe, But I can still breathe
