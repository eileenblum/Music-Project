All my life I've searched for the right, but followed the wrong.
My faithful, please forgive me.
This is real, please forgive me.
All my life I've loved, searched for the right, but followed the wrong.
My life is a perfect example, of dreams that failed.
Oh, I'm perfectly, unperfect!
But is this what I live for?
"To be judged and marked for dead"
I can't even stop and think about how many times I've failed..
I got a feeling every time I get up I'm just pulled back down.
I need to find a solution,
How many times will I fail before fate eludes me?
But is this what I love for?
"To be judged"
These are my sins...
