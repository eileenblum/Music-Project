Years and years I've spent,
Shedding my heart, Shedding my tears!
But was it worth it?
Preacher tell me was it worth it?
You came and took it all away!
My god bring love through these skies!
Whipe the hate from these eyes!
They came and took it all away!
My faith, my love, my family.
My followers, my creator, I am not a monster.
I just want this to end!
With the stunning words they spew,
Of things followed they don't even follow.
"No one leaves this battle without a fight"
If that's so, preacher tell me why!?
Tell me why?
No one can tell me why!
They came and took it all away!
My faith, my love, my family.
