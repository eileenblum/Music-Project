Destroy the swarms of the killers that live to be slain,
Im calling to my faithful who fear their lives.
Mark my words! I will teach you the way to go!
Look to me like a spring that waters never fail,
So be it, That hope prevails.

I am the messenger, I am just a messenger

Keep your head stayed upon me,
When the sun sets to the east look to me.
The black clouds will rise from the west...
Taking the weak, Taking the ones who fear them most.

My God I refuse to let us fall,
We've got to be strong in this world so dark and cold.

Though the mountains may be swaying,
And the the hills be overgrown,
My love for you will not be shaken.

Im calling to my faithful who fear their lives
Just mark my words, Were marching forward,
To the prize of the highest calling, Under the shadows of his wings

We will take the ones who condemned us of our feelings
We will make them suffer, Under the shadows of his wings
We will make them suffer
Keep your head stayed upon me!!

Give us their hearts!!!
