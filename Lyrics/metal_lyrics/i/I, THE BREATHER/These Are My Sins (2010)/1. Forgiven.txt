Oh God
These demons won't last a minute
No these demons won't last another minute in this war
They won't last in this war
This is a battle fought by the lord
Resurrected from the dead
"I the Breather"
I leave it too myself too put you in place
How could it be we were so lost in ourselves
Hold on to me, Why were we so deceived?
This could be what sets you free
I believed in you put your trust in me
Fooled to think I'd gone for eternity
Your theories can't provide what I can for you
You forgave me, so forgive the free
Oh God
How could it be we were so lost in ourselves
Hold on to me, why were we so deceived?
