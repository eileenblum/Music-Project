My Maker is calling me
No sacrifice, no victory
What are we fighting for?
A primitive and violent race
Were we once so different?
There is much to learn
Smile when your heart is breaking
Smile when your heart is aching
So turn your heads and feel my burn

There is much to learn
Necessary actions bring us peace

They cannot pay for our mistakes!
Everyone is something
Sometimes something is better than nothing
Everything is greater than nothing

It's just you and me at the end
One shall stand and one shall fall
I will fight for the weak
Ignite, ignite if all else fails
In death there is no command but mine!
Is that the best you got!
Is that the best you got!

Is the fate of our race?
Not worth fighting for
Ill take you all on!

They cannot pay for our mistakes!

They cannot pay for our mistakes!
Everyone is something
Sometimes something is better than nothing
Everything is greater than nothing

Fate rarely calls upon us at a moment of our choosing
My Maker is calling!

Ill take you all on!

Fate rarely calls upon us at a moment of our choosing
My Maker is calling!

Ill take you all on!
