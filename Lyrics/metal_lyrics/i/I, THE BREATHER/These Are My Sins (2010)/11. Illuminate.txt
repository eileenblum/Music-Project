Take a stand, Maybe even a care
Nuisance, make your way from my head

Causing all the Trial and Tribulation

Reach out to me, and let me show you my savior
Illuminate the stars
I've prepared a place beyond what you can imagine

We can't ever fill space with time we don't have
It only gets better from here
Take a stand, Maybe even a care
Nuisance make your way from my head

Take a stand, Maybe even a care
Let's go! Guide me in the paths
Forefathers took before me

Try so hard to impress everyone in the future
Nobody really cares about our past
Oh, Brother open your eyes

I know its hard but you have to fight
The world is a scary place
But knowing you makes me feel so safe

Be my way, My Truth and My Light
