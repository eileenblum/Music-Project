Another dark new day
Our race has fallen, their to blame
They will suffer bracing for a bright new day
Oh my faithful they will weep
Bracing for a bright new day
The words they preach
Wrap around my neck like a vine that wont decay
Everything that we create they destroy in the end
We will not fall silent our presence will be known
We are the principle!! A touching word!!
My faithful cant you see we are special!?
"We are foes who serve for common good"
"and try to live our lives to a positive evolution"
Oh, Everything we create they destroy!
My faithful we will not leave this war
Until they crawl with white flags raised!
They will feel our march as it crumbles the mountain tops
Everything that we create they destroy in the end
We will not fall silent our presence will be known
