You were Born Dead
Brought down, Beaten to the ground
Oh, What a cunning thing we saw this day
You were born dead brought down beaten to the ground
I will force this bone unto the chest and
Wrip the hearts from the guilty ones.
Manipulators!
Oh, And how they spit in your face and claimed to be "the holy ones
"We claim to be the holy ones"
"We are not special, We serve for a common good."
"We are foes who serve our lives to live in a positive evolution"
I gave you sight to see us
I gave you sight to see this filthy world
You were born dead
Yeah, And how they spit in your face and claimed to be "the holy ones"
"He who lives by the soul, Shall perish by the soul"
I will live in a life that lives by your calling
