I am not a king, you're not a prophet
You're not a prophet

I hear all these words you speak
Why don't you steal their soul?
My body's breaking
From the hearts you've choked
You've choked

Now I'm left contemplating
All the things you said when you inspired me
Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?

Place your face on the edge of the throne
You'll never speak again
Place my hands beneath your soul
You'll never speak again
I was just like them
You'll never speak again

I am not a king
I am not a king
You are not a prophet
I believe that there's a king
There's a king, a throne out there
And we will see his face one of these days
I believe that there's a king
There's a king, a throne out there
And we will see his face one of these days

Do you see what you're doing?
You're taking hopes and dreams
You're taking hopes and dreams from these kids
You'll never speak again
I was just like them
You'll never speak again
Cause I am not taking this anymore

I believe that there's a king
There's a king, a throne out there
And we will see his face one of these days
I believe that there's a king
There's a king, a throne out there
And we will see his face one of these days

Your time will come if you don't wake up
When everyone and everything is gone
Where will you be?
Where will you be?
Where will you be?
Where will you be?

Your time will come
If you don't wake up
Your time will come
If you don't wake up
