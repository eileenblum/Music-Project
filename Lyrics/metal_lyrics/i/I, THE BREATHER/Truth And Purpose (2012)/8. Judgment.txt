You got what you wanted
A heart full of pride and a soul full of pain

My actions speak louder than my words
I'm so fed up
I'm so sick and tired
I am not like them
I am not the same

I am not the one who gave you your beliefs
I am not the one who stripped you of your dreams
So who's to blame?

I am the same as you
We're raised in a world
That's black and blue
I've got a heart and a soul
So who's to blame?

We are the same
I've got a heart and a soul that guide my way

That does not make me any less than you
That does not make me any less than you

I am the same as you
I am not the one who gave you your beliefs
I am not the one who stripped you of your dreams
I am not the one who gave you your beliefs
I am not the one who stripped you of your dreams

Why Must I be Pushed Off for What I Believe?
What I believe

This is not right
This is not the right time or the right place
This is not right
This is not the right time or the right place

We saw God
I know you don't believe
This life I lead
I know you don't believe
This life I lead

I am the same as you
We're raised in a world
That's black and blue
I've got a heart and a soul
I am the same as you
We're raised in a world
That's black and blue
I've got a heart and a soul...
