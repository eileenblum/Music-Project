This table used to hold a âdinnerâ
This house used to home a âfamilyâ
Not anymore
Those days have come and gone
Those days have come and gone

Looking back now I don't remember much
I spent my whole life trying to prove my worth (I had no place)
I was sheltered from this world
I lost all hope, there was no God

Fight for what you're longing for
Hold tight, life has its funny ways
Follow your heart when you can't think straight
Life has its funny ways

I can only "Thank you"
You made me who I am today

Looking back now
I don't remember much

I've faced my fears
I've become a better man
I've faced my fears
But my heart's still bitter
I can only "Thank you"
You made me who I am

Fight for what you're longing for
Hold tight, life has its funny ways
Follow your heart when you can't think straight
Life has its funny ways
Fight for what you're longing for
Hold tight, life has its funny ways
Follow your heart when you can't think straight
Life has its funny ways

This table used to hold a dinner
This house used to home a family
Not anymore
Those days have come and gone
Those Days Have Come and Gone...
