We all found love in the wrong places

We're all living lies in our heads
Living in silence has taught me everything I know
We're all knights and pawns forced to fit the mold
This is such a sad, sad world

Our hands are calloused and we've got nothing to show
Our hands are calloused and we've got nothing to show

We're living in a perfect world
That we made into a sad, sad world
We're all living lies in our heads
We're all stuck
We're stuck in misery
We're fabricated
We're fabricated
We're living lies in our heads
We're living lies in our heads

I must admit that I feel a sense of rejuvenation
To know there's no relation
Between my irrational fears
And what's in store for us

We're all sinners
Bathing in our own self-pity
We're all sinners
Bathing in our own self-pity
Bathing in our own self-pity

This is such a perfect world
That we made into a sad, sad world
