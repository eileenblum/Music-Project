[feat. Micah Kinard of Oh, Sleeper]Can we take on the weight of the world?
This corrupt world
Can we take on the weight of the world?
This corrupt world

I know we fell short many times before
We can't do this all on our own
Our generation takes the task
Wake up we've gotta pick up the slack

Our generation takes the task
We will rise up
We will rise up
Put on the armor of God
We will rise up
We will rise up

If we shy away
How can we create change?
Fight for the one we believe in
Our generation takes the task

I'm not fighting with myself anymore
No longer wrestling with flesh and blood

Never stray from our faith
This is our call to duty
It's our destiny
The strong will triumph
We'll make strong the weak

Take me to the grave
You've gotta fight the dead that walks
Deep in your skin, for your veins they haunt
Crush their bones, blow the chaff out of your lungs
You'll set ablaze when the deed's been done
The deed's been done

I'm not fighting with myself anymore
If we shy away, how can we create change?
Fight for the one we believe in
Our generation takes the task

We will rise up!
We will rise up
We will rise up
Put on the armor of God

If we shy away
How can we create change?
Fight for the one we believe in
Our generation takes the task
