Bracing open my eyes with a heart full of fear
This life fades with every blood, sweat and tear
When will we fall?
When will our existence crumble?
When will we crumble?

You spend your whole life looking for
The basic meaning of this world and so much more
Searching for a home full of love
And a life (and a life)
That many dying dreamed of

I'm screaming to you with a soul full of grief
Father they are preaching with a snake at their teeth
A snake at their teeth
And it repeats, it repeats

Oh this is me, I know this is me
You say I'm not worthy of this life we speak?
Oh this is me, I know this is me
I just can't follow all these lies you preach

You call yourself a man of god?
You can wear it
But can you defend it?

I'm trying to get closer
But the waves keeps smashing my fate
Now how I am supposed to follow this life
With the world crumbling down at the edge of my feet

I'm screaming to you with a soul full of grief
Father they are preaching with a snake at their teeth
A snake at their teeth
And it repeats, it repeats

You spend your whole life looking for
The basic meaning of this world and so much more
Searching for a home full of love
And a life (and a life)
That many dying dreamed of
You spend your whole life looking for
The basic meaning of this world and so much more
Searching for a home full of love
And a life (and a life)
That many dying dreamed of
