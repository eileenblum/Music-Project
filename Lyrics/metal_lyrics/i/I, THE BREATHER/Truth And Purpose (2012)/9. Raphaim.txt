We stand here
Like we're all alone and there's no one else out there
We have come to believe
We are the one land
So selfish to think
We are the only ones

No one knows
We are not God
No one knows
We are not God

We are scared to find the truth
So we shy away
We dismiss the things that are different than our beliefs
We dismiss the things that are different
Than our beliefs
Than our beliefs

I want to be free
And not judged for what I believe
I want to stand up tall
I want to help who falls
I want to help who falls
I want to stand up tall
There's no right
There's no right in fighting our own

We are scared to find the truth
So we shy away
We dismiss the things that are different than our beliefs
We are trying to be something we are not
We are not God
We are trying to be something we are not
We are not God

Stop judging and open your eyes
Our souls have the same beauty inside
No two minds will ever think alike
So who's wrong if we don't know who's right?
We don't know who's right
Because we are not God
We don't know who's right
But we fight with fire inside

I want to be free
And not judged for what I believe
I want to stand up tall
I want to help who falls
I want to help who falls
I want to stand up tall
There's no right
There's no right in fighting our own
