I built these roads
To find a new hope
A real home
I've been choked
I've felt the weight of a thousand thorns
To hit this stage when I want nothing more

I built these walls
To home the family of the broke and burned
We fell with the things we couldn't see
He picked us back up with his hands that bleed
I know it's hard
I know this pain...
When the ones you love kick you to the streets

We are the bruised and broken
And we refuse to be like you
We are the bruised and broken
And we refuse to be like you
We are the ones who are bruised and broken
We all refuse to be like you
Just open your eyes
There is not much to see
This world is full of hate
And it's the love we need
We won't run
This is our destiny
This is our destiny

God!
Won't you please help them?
Why won't you please help them?
Why won't you please fix this?
Please help them!
Why won't you please help them?
Why won't you please fix this?

We are the bruised and broken
And we refuse to be like you
We are the bruised and broken
And we refuse to be like you
We are the ones who are bruised and broken
We all refuse to be like you

Oh I can't seem to shake this sight (shake this sight)
The sky it burned
And it rained of ashes
We are the bruised and broken
We are the bruised and broken
We are the bruised and broken
And we refuse to be like you
