at the moment a huge infortune star was placed there
the gate to another world opened 
the unknown world was widespread out there
a holy light of hope is eroded
the black sun is materializing an evil shadow
our guardian angel
the advent of the dark satan glows

oh, lord, give devastating pains and fears 
to the satans!!
give despair to blind lambs wander for the
god and looking for grace
holy moments of us, the creatures who live
in the darkness embracing pains
lead by the golden rule of the grand evil space

the massacre is gonna happen by the disciples
avalanching from the gate
although the insane shout of the saints is bursting
the god never helps them
the earth is dyed black with the blood of the dead
it emits resentment
death tide billows, it engulfs souls

this grand moment leads us to the evil era of darkness
to our dynasty of lust where evil exceeds saints
