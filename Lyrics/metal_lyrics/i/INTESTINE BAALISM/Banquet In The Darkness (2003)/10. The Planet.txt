on the planet filled with creatures
people lament over death
the don't recognize all the creatures on the earth are evil
no one can live without eating others

the planet itself is abnormal
abandon the stupid lesson
to kill creatures is to contribute to the planet
the number of lives should be reduced

fools say life is important or god blesses us
having eaten so many lives by themselves
fools won't hesitate to kill and eat animals
that plead for their lives
they do so just for their survival

the euphorie a killing creatures
it is the joy of contributing to the planet
provide death and feel the joy
that will tell you the true form of life
