Though I see nothing without eyes
It is surely in my sight
Like a far way mirage
A vision that will bring me peace

Stare at it drifting with dark red shine
A feeling as if it is me
Symbol of my agony and spirit
My guardian star, the black sun

As if swallowing my perpetual agonies
The black sun grows
Feeling splendor as of creation
The black sun I will bring forth

The sense of my true self
Myself in the other world has gone
I am about to recall my past
I need more pain

I feel another spirit in me
I recall what I am
Locked away during the ancient war
My true spirit will be awakened soon
