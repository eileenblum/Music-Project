Battle between virtue and vice now ends
Golden order is faced toward one direction
Orbit of stars has changed drastically
Another galaxy is born

The black sun is a mirror that reflects this star
This star is the black sun

Decaying light, does not return
Reasoning of mortal world has been changed
Species who respect love are fed to evil species
No one doubts such a situation

Brutality hidden in the past is not false
False reason has repeated hypocrisy
Abuse by hypocrisy has ended
Anything can be allowed
Era of desire is now coming
It will be remembered through the universe
