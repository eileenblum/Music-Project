Rebirth of the internal power
Awakening of the ancient memory and thoughts
Feelings of ecstasy as if floating
I cannot recall the dreams that I had seen up until the day before

Frozen heart, brutality
Nothing can control me
Fears enter me
No feelings of sorrow within me

Boiling amnio turns black
Effuse sickening stench
When the boiling amnio reaching the critical point
It suddenly hardens and time stops

Hardened amnio becomes transparent
My children who wake me
You have served a great role in this chain of events
Surely our evil brethren shall prosper

Time begins to move again
Inorganic vapors solidify around me
No one can be like him, the black angel
Finally he descends upon the world
