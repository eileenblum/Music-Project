My darkened nightmare.... the visions of forgotten paradise
Ancient gods are buried under the frozen tombs
Cruel reign of fear.... the ultimate inhumanity
Martyrdom from within.... as the anatomists are masked black

The darkland I rule.... I am the almighty new king
I need new sacrifices to fulfill my lust
No shelter from your doom.... you all shall die by my judgement
I set fire to the forest of eternity
....but my mission is far from complete
I must receive....
