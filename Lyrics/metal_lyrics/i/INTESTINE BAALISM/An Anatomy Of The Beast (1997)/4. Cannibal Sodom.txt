Obsessed by an unholy sickness
The cries of christians echoed
Satan looking down from Pandemonium
The whole creation is blasphemied and disgraced
Offer the fresh human meat
Infernal cannibalism is chaos

Baphomet smiled after vomiting his intestines

They squirm like grotesque tentacles
They rape all sacrifices
Insult... violate

Baptism in blood, a violate end
There's no exist for the bound and sacrificed
Bared entrails, dangled intestines
Intoxicated by their beauty
Mangled fleshless torsos are spat from their mouths to cunt
They are exposed as the monuments
Blasphemy to the grace of God

Lucifer struggled to devour the fresh entrails
Fresh human meat, blood dripping from the fresh feast
In the cursed Sodom, a cannibal land
....an untrodden lost paradise

Baphomet smiled after vomisting his intestines
They squirm like grotesque tentacles
They rape all sacrifices
Rapture... sacrifice
....behind the mirror I saw.... End
