[Part 1: Captured by Hatred]

The congregation has betrayed against the empire captured.
I cannot resist my Doom impregnated,
The cursed son of Nazarene profanation,
Holocaust by the fire of hatred
...I'm intoxicated with the cross impiled on my belly

Corporal celebration, the beginning of the end captured,
I am made to confess all my deadly sins coproral celebration,
The fall of the empire the first bell tolls,
The beasts start to devour my flesh

Master of the damned, damned at his birth
Let the children know their fates
....master

[Part 2: Bleeding for the Lord]

Torturer strangled, my neck twisted
Bringer of incineration, please burn my body parts
My body parts still moving to beg of my lord a blessing
Incriminations.... I bleed for my lord
....by your spell I die, your spell is my wish

Incrimination, I bleed for my lord
....by your spell I die, your spell is my wish

I'm the lamb of my lord, my lord is Satan
I'm walking the path to the guillotine
The beast arises in my with wicked sickness
The last bell tolls.... Colloseum is in ecstasy
