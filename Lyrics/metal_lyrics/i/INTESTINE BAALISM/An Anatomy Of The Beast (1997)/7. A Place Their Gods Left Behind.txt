Out from the eternal darkness
Entering the core of his aureole
Born into the kingdom of the damned
I know I must curse those blessed
I am the new unholy king
The unblessed child of my father, Baal
I am reincarnated as a symbol of hatred

I rule where their Gods cry
All holy spirits are gone
No Gods shall live, no life shall rise

Immorated, obsessed.... a relic of the ancient faith
Diabolic spells... they intoxicated
Raped, submissive witch... conceive the animus
Mutilated womb... a creation of incest

Sodomite... insult serpents in his anus and mouth
Nymphomaniac.... hang her upside down and gut her

Drowned in the sea of blood
The sea known as lament
The eternal life they have is an everlasting atonement
The survivors are suffocated by the reek of spoilage
I cannot handle my madness, no souls can seize me
I rule the kingdom, I am the child of Baal
I am reincarnated as a symbol of despair

Blazing mighty stars dyed red
The witch spawned the child of doom
She writhed around the altar in pain from her mangled belly
I thrusted my scythe and pulled her child out
The carnal rite climaxed
I ate his raw flesh

The world is full of shit
Gamygyn, let him know
Hear their Gods crying
They die, and are reborn to die
A place their Gods left behind

Bleeding crosses are burned
They are wiped by my vomited intestine
The dark moon is alight, but no light appears
A place their Gods left behind
