A cry for fire
A fury, quelled by ice
Eternal bearers of time
And mortally bound
This union in rime
Shall form worlds arcane
A sentence, baneful and cold
Slain by sons pure in heart

Tides of blood
Form the seas
The great corpse fell
The earth was born

What once was flesh
Now turn to mountains of stone
The forests deep, of mighty locks
Archaic knowledge was strewn
To veil as white cloud and mist
A final crown aglow with the flame of stars

Realms upon their blood
Mortal
Realms upon their blood
Mortal and great

Great orbs of muspel's flame glare
To sunder the paths of night and day
The ways fend the land
Pursued athwart
By darkness and cold
Four empty eyes peer
And long for the night
Forever more
The passage to eventide fades
Their journey beyond shall presage
The end

The whispers of frost and flame
Shall echo for ages
In time, with changing winds
The great ash will fade

Upon the land
The light and shadows both converge
To sway the hidden will
The wind-swept dreams of men
Cloaked with boughs of time
Shall one day be forgotten no more

A world ruled by flame
Flame
A world ruled by frost
Frost
A world turns to endure

Realms upon their blood
Mortal
Realms upon their blood
Mortal and great
