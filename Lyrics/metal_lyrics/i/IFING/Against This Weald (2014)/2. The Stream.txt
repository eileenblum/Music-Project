Runes cast and blades heaved
Shadows fall one by one
Against this weald we shall stand
No more

Mortal, proud and braved
Frost veils the earth cold
The quiet and still of death calls
Who will now journey forth
Through the realms of ice and fire?

As light wanes over
This crimson field
Chosen not are we
Honor beyond only
The blackest of tides
Chosen not are we
In death

Ifing's deep and darkened wave
Parts the ancient sons of earth
From the dwelling of the gods:
Open flows the mighty flood
Nor shall ice arrest its course
While the wheel of ages rolls

There lies sorrow
As lightning fills the night
Beyond
There lies hope
To fight forever more
Beyond

The silence of battle now fades
Leaving me grasping the earth
Invoking my line
Invoking my love

There lies rapture
Before the flames consume
Beyond

The cry of wolves resound
Through the trees
They hunger for all that lie fair
A race against time, or the shade of despair?

The shore, ancient and vast
Beckons us forth
Enchanted by love
And driven by fear
The earth no longer
Holds them back

A final vision before my mind
Immersed am I; in cold, in dread
A beauty and fairness
So distant, so pure
My thoughts are now lost to the fury spilled forth by hope

This cold night falls forever over
This weeping land
Their eyes fixed on their prey
I am forever hunted by solitude
My laugh cries
Through the night
