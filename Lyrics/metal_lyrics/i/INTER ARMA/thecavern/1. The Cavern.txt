The sun stings my faded eyes 
on this burning morn. 
No refuge in sight. 
No breath to cull a cry. 

Dragging my broken bones 
in a trail of dust behind me. 
Under the dispiriting watch 
of the soulless, blinding eye. 

Rising from the desert 
an exiled peak stands forlorn. 
A vast fortress whose facade 
defies the will of all men. 
Crawling from the desert 
an exiled man weeps forlorn. 
A frail vessel whose will 
has been defied by all men. 

In the shadow of a gnarled tree 
at the foot of the peak, I collapse. 
And with one last remaining thought 
I yearn for a grave in which to lie. 

Rising from the desert 
an exiled peak stands forlorn. 
A vast fortress whose facade 
defies the will of all men. 
Crawling from the desert 
an exiled man weeps forlorn. 
A frail vessel whose will 
has been defied by all men. 

Can be this be the end? 
Is this all I have left? 
To die at the foot of this towering peak? 

As night's hold creeps forward 
a brilliant light appears from a concealed hollow. 
I gather my strength and rise from the dust 
for this strange light lures me forward. 

It calls my name 
It draws me near 
It calls me name 
It draws me near 

I cross the threshold into this new realm 
and with every step the light becomes brighter. 
As exhaustion's clutch takes hold, I fall to the bank 
of a shimmering pool as clear as glass. 

Millions of brilliant lights dance and flicker from it's depths 
and with a sigh I cup my hands and drink. 
As my body falls numb and the light begins to fade 
I know that in this cavern I'll die. 

bird of prey 
what is your place 
down in the fields 
trespasser divine 
no hunger atones 
and still you must weep 
over the bones 
and burn like the sun 
bearing the load 
there's no peace 
not in the sky 
not in the sea 
down in the dirt 
is where it must be 
down in the earth 
is where it must be 
down in the dirt 
is where it must be 
down in the dirt 
bird of prey 
trespasser divine 
how do you sleep 
or measure the time 
your hunger alone 
must burn like the sun 
and still you must weep 
for everyone 
for everyone 

I awake to the howling of wind. 
My breath like acrid smoke in this thin glacial air. 

Where have I gone? 
I try to shake off the confusion 
and when I rise to my feet 
I look out... 
How am I standing at the summit of this lonesome peak? 

Where have I gone? 

The night sky splits and from it's wound 
bleeds a spiraling aurora. 
As this spectacle draws closer 
a figure appears. 
An ethereal woman whose long hair veils her face. 
She offers me her hand and tells me to not be afraid. 
I take it and she pulls me to her breast. 
"Don't be afraid, don't be afraid" she says 
as everything turns black.
