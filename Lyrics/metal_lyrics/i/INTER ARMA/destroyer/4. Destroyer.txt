STAND AMONG STARS
AWAIT THE NEW SUN
A TRIUMPHANT SIGHT
TRINITY FORMS 

OH, WHAT A STUNNING GLEAM

ROBED IN THE COSMOS
AWAIT THE NEW AGE
PROLIFERATE DISORDER
TRINITY BLOOMS

IS THIS A SAVIOR
CULLED FROM CHAOS?
OR A PARIAH
BORN FROM DISGUST?

OH, WHAT A HIDEOUS DIN

TIME IS REBORN
FROM PERILOUS SKIES
TIME IS CONTROLLED
THROUGH IMPERILED EYES

COMFORT US OâDESTROYER
LIGHT UP THE SKY
COMFORT ME OâDESTROYER
LIGHT UP MY EYES

COMFORT US OâDESTROYER
LIGHT UP THE WORLD
COMFORT ME OâDESTROYER
LIGHT UP MY SOUL
