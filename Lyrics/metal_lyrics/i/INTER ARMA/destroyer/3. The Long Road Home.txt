LIFE
IS A FLEETING SHADOW
THAT DANCES ACROSS FORGOTTEN FIELDS
ONLY TO BE LOST AT TWILIGHT.

WICKED
IS THE GREAT NIGHT THAT FOLLOWS.
IT IS THE SIRE OF ABHORRENCE.
ITS CRUELTY KNOWS NO BOUNDARY, NO END.

WISDOM
LET IT GUIDE YOUR WEARY FORM
THROUGH THE GLOOM OF NIGHT SO YOU MAY
SING YOUR DEATH SONG
AND DIE LIKE A HERO GOING HOME.
