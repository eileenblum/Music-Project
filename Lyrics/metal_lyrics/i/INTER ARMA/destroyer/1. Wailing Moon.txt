THE PATH THAT I ROAM 
ENDS IN A MAZE OF STARS
WHERE IâLL OFFER MYSELF
TO THE VASTNESS OF SPACE AND TIME

ITâS WHERE IâLL SEARCH FOR THE WAILING MOON
WHO GUARDS THE KEY TO MY SOUL
WHOâS VOICE ECHOES THROUGH ALL ETERNITY

OH MY SOLEMN BEACON
WHERE DO YOU HIDE?
I SEEK YOUR STEADFAST GUIDE
I SEEK YOUR TRUTH

IF I SURRENDER TO THE UNIVERSE
IN YOUR EYES
WILL YOU TELL ME WHO YOU MOURN?
MY WAILING MOON

AS SHE DRAWS ME TOWARDS
HER GHOSTLY ORB
THE WORLD I ONCE KNEW
BECOMES AN ARCANE VISION

OH MY SOLEMN BEACON
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
YOUR LIGHT IS MY PARAMOUNT DESIRE
YOUR LIGHT IS TRUTH

I WILL RAISE MY HANDS
TO THE COSMIC NIGHT

I WILL DELIVER MYSELF 
TO HER RADIANT AURA

IF I SURRENDER TO THE UNIVERSE
IN YOUR EYES
WILL YOU TELL ME WHO YOU MOURN?
MY WAILING MOON

I CAN ONCE AGAIN BREATHE
I CAN ONCE AGAIN FEEL
THE SPECTRES OF THE VAST COSMOS
HAVE DELIVERED ME TO HER SPLENDOR

I HAVE SURRENDERED TO THE UNIVERSE
IN YOUR EYES
WILL YOU TELL ME WHO YOU MOURN?
MY WAILING MOON
