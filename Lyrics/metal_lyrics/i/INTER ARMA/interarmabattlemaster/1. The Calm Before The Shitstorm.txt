[performed by Inter Arma]Horizons 
Blur 
Them all with dust and smoke
From the wreckage 
Of failed conquest 
Fill in every valley 
With the rubble of longstanding regret 
From this crest I can see 
The great facade in front of me

The greatest liar 
I've ever known
Shares my blood
Tissue and bone

In this position
Every movement you make 
Is carefully guarded
To ensure that we stay deceived

Rising 
Above 
The peaks where clouds begin to weep 
The only place 
I can find solace here 
A stranger in a strange land 
Through no fault of my own 
I look to the west and search for my home 
But there is nothing but endless sky

The greatest liar 
I've ever known
Shares my blood
Tissue and bone

In this position
Every movement you make 
Is carefully guarded
To ensure that we stay deceived

Someday 
When 
Your lies have worn through
Every person 
Who is important to you 
Solitude
Is all that you'll have left 
It's what you deserve forever

Remember the calm before the shitstorm

The greatest liar 
I've ever known
Shares my blood
Tissue and bone

In this position
Every movement you make 
Is carefully guarded
To ensure that we stay deceived
