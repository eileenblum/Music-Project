Life
Is a fleeting shadow
That dances across forgotten fields
Only to be lost at twilight

Wicked
Is the great night that follows
It is the sire of abhorrence
Its cruelty knows no boundary, no end

Wisdom
Let it guide your weary form
Through the gloom of night so you may
Sing your death song,
And die like a hero going home
