At long last I have scaled
The spire to the sky
A stone's throw
To the heavens above

Far past the skylines of cities
Fading into ruination
Far pat the threadbare flags of nations
Spiraling into entropy

At this summit I'll feign death
To call forth the scavenger's clan

At long last I have scaled
The spire to the sky
A stone's throw
To the heavens above

Far past the crumbling monuments
To long forgotten triumph
Far past the stench of governments
Basking in irrevocable failure

At this summit I'll feign death
To call forth the scavenger's clan

I call to you oh foul beasts
Please descend upon me
For I am ready to cross the great divide
Into the hidden void
Black out the sky and I will close my eyes,
I will close my eyes

I fear not this somber fate

I call to you oh foul beasts
I call to you oh foul beasts
Black out the sky, Black out the sky
And I will close my eyes

As the scavenger's clan descends from the sky
I take one last glimpse
A legion of stygian wings coalesce to disavow the sun
I close my eyes, I close my eyes
