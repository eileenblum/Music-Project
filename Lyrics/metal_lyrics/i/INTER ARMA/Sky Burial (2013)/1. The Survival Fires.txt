Dust settles on a ravaged land
Cloaking the ruins beget by man
In this obscurity we rise to carve our way

Instinct is our only guide on these bondless paths
For we do not fear death, as it is all around
We must keep one step ahead of its voracious grasp

In these most perilous of times it is better
To have less thunder in the mouth and more lightning in the hands

Our minds consumed with a narrow vision
To descry the shrouded ways that will lead us to our asylum Where the fires of hope still burn

In these most perilous of times it is better
To have less thunder in the mouth and more lightning in the hands

We seek survival
We seek survival

All paths lead to the survival fires

With might in our hearts and lightning in our hands
We'll bow to none, we'll discern our way

All paths lead to the survival fires
All paths lead to the survival fires

Survival
Survival
