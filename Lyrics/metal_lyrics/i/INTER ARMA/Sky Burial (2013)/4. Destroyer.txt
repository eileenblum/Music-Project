Stand among stars
Await the new sun
A triumphant sight
Trinity forms

Oh, what a stunning gleam

Robed in the cosmos
Await the new age
Proliferate disorder
Trinity blooms

Is this a savior
Culled from chaos?
Or a pariah
Born from disgust?

Oh, what a hideous din

Time is reborn
From perilous skies
Time is controlled
Through imperiled eyes

Comfort us o'destroyer
Light up the sky
Comfort me o'destroyer
Light up my eyes

Comfort us o'destroyer
Light up the world
Comfort me o'destroyer
Light up my soul
