The lungs of this great Earth have filled with humanity's ashes.
A rebellious flame has scorched the body clean.
A ravaged land, free from the teeth of the human machine machine has given up all secrets.
The reclamation can now begin.

Rise...from the Earth. Once again claim what is yours.
This new dawn is now the first dawn.
This new day is now the first day.
The scent of human history has all but been erased, forever.
A smoldering memory that only the Earth will remember.

The storm clears.
The light returns.
Illuminating
A charred wasteland.

Silence.
A world free from
The clutches
Of scathing human furor.

The wretched curse
Has been lifted
Allowing
a return to times long passed.

The final
Resting place
Of civilization
Lies under
Unfathomable
Depths of ash.
