Mountains shield me
For I possess the arsonist's flame.
The thrill of watching this valley burn 
Would be the greatest escape.

Mountains shield me
For I am one cruelly inclined
To set sky and earth ablaze
With no remorse and no regrets.

The flames will rise to great heights.
The flames will rise to dethrone the light.
I will be safe at sundown.
I will be safe at sundown.
