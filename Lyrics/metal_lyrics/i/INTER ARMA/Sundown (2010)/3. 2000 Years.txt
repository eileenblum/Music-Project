Lies, lies, lies, lies.
Cast down from the disgusting tongues
of men obsessed with the fiction 
printed on the pages of an archaic book; 
one prescribed to many as the answer, the cure.

Wake from the fog of 2000 years
Rise above the tide of submission
Wake from the fog of puritan ideals
Rise above the gutless herd mentality
that plagues, that corrupts, that perverts,
that demoralizes all.

The driving force behind all evangelism
is the lurid pursuit of a monetary gain.
Instilling a fear of god 
secures wealth for the men of god.

Wake from the fog of 2000 years
Rise above the tide of submission
Wake from the fog of puritan ideals
Rise above the gutless herd mentality
that plagues, that corrupts, that perverts,
that demoralizes all.

I will always be the wolf.
The free-thinker.
The tormentor of the herd.

I WILL NEVER PRAY FOR ANYTHING.
NOT FOR LIFE, NOT FOR DEATH.
NOT FOR GOD, NOT FOR COUNTRY.
NOT FOR PEACE, NOT FOR WAR.
I WILL NEVER PRAY.
