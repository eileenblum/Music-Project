Skyward we follow
To paths unseen.
Spirit to guide us,
Continue to be.

Lighting our way nowâ¦
Journey back home;
Finish this suffering.
Never left aloneâ¦

She has been set free.
She will not die;
She will now rest
Where the earth meets the sky.

The light in her eyes
Burn through the night.
Circles that hang,
That fall and riseâ¦

Lighting our way nowâ¦
Journey back home;
Finish this suffering.
Never left aloneâ¦

She has been set free.
She will not die;
She will now rest
Where the earth meets the sky
