âHere, where the sun blooms with no respite, crooked men and vagabonds seek the holiness of silence.â

Weâve spent a spell drifting on paths bygone,
Where our voices wane against the breath of Gods.

The summer dronesâ¦

âHere, where the spirit is purged of all earthly trespass, crooked men and vagabonds desire a most desolate peace.â

But weâll tread on, through a season unchanged,
Across barren expanse to the high desert plain
Where weâll accept our fate and take our rightful place
Among the devils and thieves nailed to the Joshua trees. 

The summer drones on.
