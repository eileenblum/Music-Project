I was born under a summer nightâs sky,
Wrapped in the gossamer of heavenâs vault.
I was raised in the fields of a kingdom untamed,
Versed in the lore of the cosmosâ might.

Oh, how I long
For a solitude so pure,
Free from the uproar
Of manâs loathsome song.
Oh, how I long
For a slumber so true,
Beyond the ceaseless din
Of manâs loathsome song.

As a young man Iâve ventured far from youthful realm,
Spellbound by the allure of a city never at peace.
Here, in this obdurate heart, Iâve learned of suffering
And vowed to forsake it all; to roam the stars evermore. 

Oh, how I long
For a solitude so pure,
Free from the uproar
Of manâs loathsome song.
Oh, how I long
For a slumber so true,
Beyond the ceaseless din
Of manâs loathsome song.

Lead me to the archerâs hold
Where the curses reach no ear.

Iâd tether my dreams to the crescent of his bow,
And hang my anathemas from the point of his arrow.

Oh, how I long to breathe the same breath as the archer in the emptiness.
