Those men who wish to exalt themselves
As Gods believe they will
Dwell amid the heavens forever.
Those men who wish to exalt themselves
As Gods will meet an ardent demise
As cruel as any end theyâve overseen.

âWe violent ones, we last longer.â - R.M. Rilke

Our barbarism knows no bounds, 
Our blades know not of remorse.

We will tear them from their strongholds
And baptize them with our savagery.
We will tear them from their strongholds
And judge them with eyes enlightened by death.

âWe violent ones, we last longer.â
âWe violent ones, we last longer.â

Our barbarism knows no bounds;
Our blades know not of remorse.

Those men who wish to exalt themselves
As Gods will beg for a taste of mercy;
Our ears will fall deaf to their cries.
Those men who wish to exalt themselves
As Gods will cede to our rage;
Their constellations clouded with the dust of their decay.

A fist for the visage
Of tyranny
A blade for the throats
Of tyrants

And as their bloodless vessels fall from their violent constellationsâ¦
âDonât they look just like rebel angels falling down from the heavens?â
[â W. Jennings]
