When I was young, I inflicted a heartless sin.
I mocked my fate and ran wild until chance led me here,
Where I grew drunk on the trace of a fermenting sun,
And buried my failures beneath the ebb and flow of the tides.

Time, have you forgotten my sullied name?
Time, have you forgotten the shameful wounds?
Time, have you forgotten the boundless grief,
I so callously wrought?

As the sands of time gnaw at my weathered face,
I ponder more and more on the error of my ways.

Time, when will you recall my prowess with a blade?
Time, when will judgment finally summon me,
To the gallows from which Iâll hang?

And from these gallows paradise will scowl upon me.
And from these gallows Iâll leer out âcross the sea,
Laughing all the way to my grave.

Laughing all the way to my grave
Laughing all the way to my grave
To my grave
