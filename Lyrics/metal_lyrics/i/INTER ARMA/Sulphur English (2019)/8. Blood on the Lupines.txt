As the sun bids farewell
To this dusty wash,
Its last thin rays

Kindle tiny stars
That dance
In no particular time
Specks of stray glass
That collect the last hints
Of the fleeting light.

As darkness grips
This wayward land,
Scant flickers of transient light
Frolic in the distance
A sure sign of some dreary town.

So I wander through the night
'Til I reach its shadowy edge,

Where gravestones lay between
Shuttered homes and rusting hulks,

Where I see her figure,
Faceless in the gloom,
And she says:

'Turn away! These people are held by a cursed star.
There's blood on the lupines and a fever in this town.'

An atavist you've always been.
