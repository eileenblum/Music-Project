At dusk
We'll coax the old brook to sing
A hymn
To quell the will of the night.
Restless,
We'll sway to its primeval song,
Enchanted
By the fires burning within.

Restless

At dawn
We'll sing the old brook to sleep.
A hymn
To quiet the roar of the day.
In stillness,
We'll lay on its primeval banks,
Weary
From the fires burning within.

Stillness
