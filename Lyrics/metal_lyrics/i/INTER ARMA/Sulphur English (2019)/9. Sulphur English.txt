Beware the charlatan
Slinking amongst
The pallid colonnades.

Beware his garb
Of threads woven
In gilded opulence.
Beware his forked tongue:
Its diction foul and impenitent,
Delivered on the winds of sulphur's breath;
Its noxious arguments
Crudely spun into a mesh of bedlam and fallacy.

The charlatan sets his eyes towards the throne,
Tongue adrip in revolting ecstasy.
And the lackeys gnash their pearly teeth,
Pining for his next decree,
Erect and euphoric with unquenched delusion,
Thirsting for a power absolute.

Their intentions reek of an impure faith
Born from the promise of a glutton's lust.
Their minds too dull and weak-willed to break,
Servants to the charlatan's every desire.

Sever the corrupt tongue
Of the imperious fool.
Silence the gangrenous root
Of his abhorrent voice.

Beware the charlatan
Slinking amongst
The pallid colonnades.

Sever the corrupt tongue
Of the imperious fool.
Silence the gangrenous root
Of his abhorrent voice.
