As the seasons turn and spoil
A crooked axis guides my way
Down unsung paths that burn out
The most hardened of drifters.
Still I wander endlessly
Through houses turned to graves.
A stone in the eye of humankind,
Forever at bay.

Held captive by untold wounds
Of corporeal and psychic root,
Aloft in a storm of unseen anguish
Where joy and sorrow entwine.

Can I shake free the detritus of these countless, vagrant years?
Can I harness the wild flame that lays dormant deep within?

Still I wander endlessly
Through houses turned to graves.
A stone in the eye of humankind,
Forever at bay.

Held captive by untold wounds
Of corporeal and psychic root,
Aloft in a storm of unseen anguish
Where joy and sorrow entwine.

A fire burns deep in the citadel of my heart.

I will break free from captivity.
I will weather the storm.
I will shake free from detritus.
I will harness the wild flame.
