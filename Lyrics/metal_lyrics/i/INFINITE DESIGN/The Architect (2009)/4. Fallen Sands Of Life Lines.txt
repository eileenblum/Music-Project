Government issued hour glass, life time is to much to ask 
Progress definition found, in a book i haven't yet read 
In the gallows of the time the rope, burning stings more everyday 
Boy becomes a man a step closer, to thee understanding 

Try to take advantage 
Live for the moment never forget 
Its gone before we know it 

One more minute spent like a dollar / A debt we owe 

Try take advantage / never forget 

Perseverance and the death closer race 
For some another idle falls, another sunset never seem to cherish 
What we want instead of what we need 

One more minute spent like a dollar 
A debt we owe and can never repay 
The thing you never get back 
FALLEN SANDS
