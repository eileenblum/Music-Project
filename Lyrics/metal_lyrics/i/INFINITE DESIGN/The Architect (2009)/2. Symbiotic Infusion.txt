The answer is there 
Within all of us 
All of us within 
The beginning started 
So far away 

A travel of origins- 
Through space and time 
A make up of atoms taking form 
Atoms taking form 

The end of species is the beginning of ours 
Iraduim lies with in the crust 
An interpretation now reads like a book 
How many questions without answers 

Without each other we have nothing 
Together as one- all happening for a reason 
So here we meet- nice to know you- 
we are more alike then will ever know 
When the comets fell and the dust settled 
The birth of a star symbiotic infusion 

symbiotic infusion
