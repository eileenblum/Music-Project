Blood boils chain react, adrenaline has now kicked in. Anger builds, peace gives in, visions of acts of sin. Judgment upon me, thoughts cast of deceit. Voice of deception, vocal chords ripped out when. 
You spill of ill words, these extremes I've not preferred. Feel the steel upon the, neck saw cut try for a. Clean decapitation, vertebrae is broken, no more you have spoken. Cause I have no patience, trophy is the head that's, full of ragged thoughts and an example to them. To the ones who spout off, none will speak absurdly. Apathy will kill them. Bring you to your slaughter, nothing you will mutter. Judgment taken on me, this is challenge given. Turn the page. Your cold heart your cold grave, you will meet your demise. Your foul breath, your dead mind. My cover is broken, leather torn and ripped up. Binding a strong back bone, knowledge in these pages. Intelligence within, infinite proportions, others doped by drama, infectious affliction. Which you have spoke of.
