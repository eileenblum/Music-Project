I am my worst enemy, if i let them my thoughts betray me. Never letting go of dreams, failures are my lessons learned. Giving in, temptation, to tired to, to achieve. No time for, no beliefs, confidence, will it be, worth it in, in the end. Working blind, for nothing, this wasted, energy, many task, no ideas. I am my best ali, I can control my thoughts. When positive guides me, destiny i control. Focusing on what matters, never falling astray. Concentrate on new heights, little teachings, huge lessons, more knowledge. I am my worst enemy, if i let them my thoughts betray me. Never letting go of dreams, failures are my lessons learned, I am my worst enemy. Giving in is never, an option for me. My spirit can't be broken, and now i weigh my options, and now you hear my voice. Quitting is not a choice, building blocks are just failures. Testament to, my struggle, my empire. Depression, eats the heart, kills the mind. Suicide, betting down, fuck it all, fuck you too, fuck the world. Time stands still, luck is blind, affliction. Stomach hurts, want to sleep, but can't stop thinking of, what is next. NEXT!
