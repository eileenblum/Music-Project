Summer loving, had me a blast
Summer loving, happened so fast
I met a girl crazy for me
I met a boy, cute as can be
Summer days drifting away to, oh the summer nights
Tell me more, tell more, did you get very far
Tell me more, tell more, like does he have a car
I took her bowling in the arcade
We went strolling, drank lemon-aid
We made out under the dock
We stayed out till ten o clock
Tell me more, tell me more, but you donât gotta brag
Tell me more, tell me more, cause he sounds like a drag
