Would you shut your whorish mouth
And every time you talk, I wish youâd fucking stop
You would fucking stop
No point wasting this night on useless conversation
I donât know whatâs left to say
Iâm nothing more than a pig
So Iâll get quick to the point
I never want to see your ugly heart again
Itâs not worth shit in the end
Itâs a simple idea that you canât understand
We fuck first then I leave with my band
Donât bother getting ideas that this will last
Youâre just another girl that will stay in the past
So if you want to fuck, no one will ever have to know
This is the point in which I say something real negative
Tell you all to kill each other, come on pussies
Letâs see what you got
Letâs see some blood on the floor
What are you doing out there
Youâre playing like a girl
