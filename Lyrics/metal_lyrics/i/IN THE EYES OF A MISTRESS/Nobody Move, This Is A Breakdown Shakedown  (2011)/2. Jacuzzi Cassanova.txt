Come on, come on, letâs go, get up, get out the door
This is the one night of the week you have to get out on the floor
And show me what the fuck you got, yeah show me what the fuck you got
If youâve got something to prove, then hereâs your fucking shot
Letâs see you move from side to side
Letâs see your knuckles turning white
Turning white, dance with us tonight
Come on, this is a celebration
A champagne jam, a rise to the occasion
We donât give a fuck that you think about us
You live your life loving your dreams
We live our dreams, loving our lives
So if you wanna live like we do
Meet us a t the party and weâll fucking teach you
Weâre going to the after party
The only way to end the night
So meet us at the after party
And help us fucking do it right
Letâs go, grab a thirty rack and follow me
A stack of red cups and a couple balls so we can play b.p.
Youâre goin down, youâre goin down
Weâre the baddest mothers âround, on this side of town tonight
Oh shit, nice shot
I canât believe that went in
Weâre gonna win, weâre gonna win, and now youâre through
If you have a problem with me
Thatâs my friends, my band, my family
Oh man, here we go again, a bounce shot for the win
Weâve been dominating this table all night
Tomorrow letâs do it again
If you want a rematch, you know where weâll be
Next time, think again before you try to beat me
