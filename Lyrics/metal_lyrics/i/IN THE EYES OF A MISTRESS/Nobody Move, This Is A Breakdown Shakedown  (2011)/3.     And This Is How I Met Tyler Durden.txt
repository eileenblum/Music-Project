All you ever do is lie
And every day, itâs all the same and
Nothing ever seems to change
The only thing I can thank you for is
All the dome you gave me
You worthless fucking bitch
Everything you ever did was fake
You werenât even that cute in the first place
How could you think I wouldnât
Catch on to your lies
You think youâre sly
Come on, letâs keep this professional
Not let our feelings grab a hold
Look at us, breaking all the rules
We have everyone fooled
Too bad the only fool is you
If only we had done what we wanted to
Throw you both out in the cold
Leave your body for the wolves
Youâre such a dirty girl
So Full of dirty little holes
Weâll leave your lifeless body
For the wolves
All you did was lie, all you did was lie
All you are is a fucking liar
And everyday itâs all the same
Nothing ever seems to change
But now youâre gone and weâve moved on
You sent this friendship up in flames
