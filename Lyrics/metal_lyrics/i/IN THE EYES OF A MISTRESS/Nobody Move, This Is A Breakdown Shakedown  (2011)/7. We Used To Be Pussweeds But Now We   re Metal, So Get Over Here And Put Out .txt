This would burns
We have nothing left to prove
And every time we fail
We take two steps towards the right direction
We just want to see the kids move their fucking feet
The music that we make is for you and me
If I ask for one thing, introduce some swing
Add some style to your step
Someday you could be king
We have everything that we could want and more
Weâre taking this world by storm
This isnât just my dreams. This is the life I lead
And if you get in my way, Youâll be the one I reap
Iâll find out where you live
Iâll find out where you sleep
The moral of the story is
Donât ever fuck with me
Our hearts are in the right place
You canât take our lives from us
We will not stray away
