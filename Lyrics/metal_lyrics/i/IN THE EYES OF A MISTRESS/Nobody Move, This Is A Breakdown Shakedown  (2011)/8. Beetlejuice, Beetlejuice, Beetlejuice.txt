One, two, three, four, go
So let this fucking party begin
Weâre bringing all our friends
Too bad this night is gonna end
The way it always ends
A fight between one, two or three
Letâs hope itâs not between you and me
So letâs keep these red cups filled up
To the brim
Fuck, I canât believe that I have done this again
Oh shit
Drank way too much and fucked up someone elseâs friend
Iâm way too fucking drunk
Banged this dudeâs girlfriend
So go and bring your girl back âround again
Iâll show her what itâs like to be with a man
Oh damn girl, youâre so fucking fine
Letâs do this again and again
If we had the chance to fuck all night, I would
And if we had a few more beers, I know I could
Oh man, thereâs gonna be a brawl
Some guy nailed someone elseâs girl
Hey guys this broâs been talking shit
So letâs bring this fight into the streets
To introduce his teeth to the concrete
First I nailed your girl
Now your headâs beneath my feet
How does it feel to get fucked up by the guy who fucked your girl
But at least we brought the beer
So you canât complain
Get the fuck out of my face
Everyone letâs chug a beer
