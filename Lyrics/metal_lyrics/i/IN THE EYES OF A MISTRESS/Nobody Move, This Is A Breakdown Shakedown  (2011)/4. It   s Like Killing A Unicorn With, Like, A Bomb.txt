Weâre all here, letâs drink until the beer is gone
Come on letâs have some fun
Yeah, this partyâs number one
Iâm looking for a girl toâ¦
Weâll drink beers and smoke until the cops come
Iâm looking for two girls
MÃ©nage Ã  trois whatâs on my mind
Donât go thinking that youâre special
Youâre just like the rest
This band will eat you all alive
We got game like theyâve never seen
And we will do whatever it takes
To get exactly what we want
Has anybody ever told you
That you have really beautiful eyes
Thatâs right, December 31st 1999
Y2K could be any day
So fuck it all, letâs burn the whole world down tonight
Itâs Friday night and Iâm all like
Welcome to the party, itâs time to have some fun
So grab a couple drinks
Come inside and try to fuck someone
The girls are all single and the guys are all hung
Itâs the making of a orgy, all thatâs left to do is come
Iâm done
If this is all Iâm living for, I hope I live forever
This would be heaven for Hugh Hefner but better
Better, better, oh!
So wonât you come inside
Itâs been an awfully exhausting week
I think Iâll have a few drinks
To take the edge off the night
And get me feeling just right
Welcome to the party, weâre here to have some fun
Come inside, weâll show you how itâs done
Excitement is high, the girls are all down
