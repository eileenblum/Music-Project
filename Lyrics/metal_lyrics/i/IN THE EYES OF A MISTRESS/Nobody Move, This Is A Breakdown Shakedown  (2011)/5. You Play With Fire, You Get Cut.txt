Watch as we stomp your dome into the concrete
How will you talk shit with your mouth sewn shut
I donât think that you can say you know me
Based on all the little things
Youâve seen, you donât know shit
If your band has something to Say
Come and say it to our face
But be ready to back it up
I think we should take this outside
And finally finish this once and for all
Iâm so fucking sick and tired
Of all these assholes wanna slander our name
And think it goes unheard
Youâre all as good as fucking dead to me
Sometimes I want to carve my fucking eyes out
Instead Iâll take my rage out on you
And when everythingâs dead
You will know I am through
Fuck you, fucking trick
All I wanna do is slit your throat
And rip out your eyes
Someday you will day, for everything youâve done
This will be the end of you
