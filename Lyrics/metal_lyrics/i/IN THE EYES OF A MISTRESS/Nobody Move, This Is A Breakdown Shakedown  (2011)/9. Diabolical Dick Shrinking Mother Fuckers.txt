Call it karma, call it what you will
It never meant the same to me
And every time I drink like this
I canât remember anything
Come on, come on, black out with me
And I have been here before
Too many times to count
Drinking to the point of where I fucking black out
Got drunk, Blacked out, passed out
Letâs do it all again tonight
The clouds in the sky, suck my dick
This bitch ainât worth my fucking time
Can you understand the works coming out of my mouth
Hey girl! Hi, how are ya
Letâs hop into my car and
Iâll take you out for a drink, then home with me
What do you think
Get fucked up
Bang your mother fucking heads
And letâs have some fucking fun
Show me what the fuck youâre fighting for tonight
And stomp this god damned dance floor
Bang your heads and dance
Like you canât stop, letâs move
Girl, I have to tell you tomorrow
Tomorrow I wonât remember your name
I swear itâs not you. Itâs me
I canât help but take advantage of these situations
If you wanna have some fucking fun
Then throw those fists and stomp the ground
