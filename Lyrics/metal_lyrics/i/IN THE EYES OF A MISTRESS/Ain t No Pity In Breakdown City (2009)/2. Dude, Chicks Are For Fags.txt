Right Now
This is what weâre living for
Here is your chance
Take off your pants
Climb into bed with me
Or take that chance
And fucking dance
Until your soul's set free
Do you think
That you are free
When you wake up
And go to school
Or go to work
Or get fucked up
The only freedom that we have
Is the freedom to choose it for ourselves
Do we live like this
Do we die like this
