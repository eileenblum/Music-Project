This time I reach for the sky
And fucking leave you all behind
From here on out I'm moving forward
Cause I'm the only one that holds me back
It's time to make my own decisions
Regardless of the consequences
That's all for now
Stay tuned to see what happens next
Why aren't you listening to me
I said I'm fucking leaving
And I'm fucking leaving one more time
I tell you
I don't know if I'm ready to go
If Iâm ready to move on
But I don't want to ask myself what if
What if I should have gone
So long for now
Goodbye, fare well and bon voyage
I'm goin on a trip
gonna leave this world so far behind
That I never touch ground again
