How many people have said
I'm awaking the dead
And a new kind of sound
And a new way to dance
Finally present themselves
Present themselves to me
Well here is your chance
Today is that day
It's about that time
So get your ass on the fucking dance floor
And show us what you fucking live for
Is that all you got
I know you can do much better then that
Come on
Take your best shot
Unless you're not a man
Man, am I gonna be in trouble
When they've found out what I've done
I mean no disrespect
But I gotta go, I'm on the run
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
For a very important date
Oh my god I can't believe that this is happening to me
I'm gonna be on TV and I've got to get ready
Imma be so pretty, so pretty, so pretty
Come on down
You are the center of attention
Oh by the way, I forgot to mention
You're all so fucking dead
