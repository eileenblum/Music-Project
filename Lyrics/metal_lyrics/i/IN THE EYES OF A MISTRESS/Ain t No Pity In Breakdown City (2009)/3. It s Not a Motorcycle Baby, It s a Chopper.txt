Come on
Get ready to go
Look to your left
Look to your right
We are all friends
We do not fight
We're all here for one fucking reason
To dance all night
So make a fist
And through your arm
And kick back
Kick back again
This is the moment you've been waiting for
And we are pleased to present it to you
So letâs take a minute to remember this moment
And never forget it
Get it on
This is the moment we've been waiting for
And soon it will be gone
So take it in, so take it in
As much as you can
And live your fucking life for a minute
And jump right in
Yeah live your fucking life for a second
I promise you'll never regret it
D-A-N-C-E
Letâs dance all night
We're here to represent all of those who never quit
And if you live for music like we do
This fucking song goes out to you
If you live for music like we do
Let's see you bring the whole place to the ground
Bring it all down
