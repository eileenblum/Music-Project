This is the price of progress
No discovery with no risk

So load them up and take the sky,
It's for the greater good, those left behind
These consequences will be overlooked
When I am written in the annals of history

You look at my creation with condemnation and damnation for this world is mine
Forces beneath the surface are collapsing the inner space and time
Matter is manifesting light through a portal that's underlying this state of energy
Now it's this disastrous anomaly defining our reality

All of you gathered around:
We are the few. We are the privileged.
We will recreate what had to be destroyed.
We are the future; the contingency.
So look at what I've done

The greatest tragedy is holding hands at the apex of discovery
So look and tremble

All of you gathered around:
We are the few. We are the privileged.
We will recreate what had to be destroyed.
We are the future; the contingency.
