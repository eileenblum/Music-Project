Atoms are stripped from being
Total destruction of all that we know
Our end times are now

I've found existential meaning
In this hypothetical region of space and time
The system is perfect, calculations are flawless
This stunning creation - I've brought life to this light

Throw the switch!

The grid is aligned
Dimensions and time will be stripped away
My name shining bright
Warped matter and light

Oh god, what have I done?

Atoms are stripped from being
Total destruction of all that we know
Our end times are now
(I've brought life ending light)
Atoms are stripped from being
Total destruction of all that we know
(Oh god, what have I done?)
Our end times are now

The culmination of my life-long work
Justification for who I've become
I've brought life-ending light

I've brought life-ending light
