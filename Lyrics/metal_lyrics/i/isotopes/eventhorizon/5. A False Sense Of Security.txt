The craft breaches atmosphere
We patiently wait as the safety point nears
Forgive but don't forget
Survivors look past what my creation has done.
Humanity starts anew now.

Light penetrates the eyes of the passengers
The core begins expanding
The earth is now expelling
The force is growing, its poles shine far
There will be no escape

The hull of the ship is cracking
An overwhelming fear consumes us all
The desperation of escaping the light
Is not enough to save us

The walls are closing in
"We are all gonna die"
The engine power fails
"It's pulling us in"
It will consume the fleet
"We don't want to die"

Viewing my creation in its eye
I no longer fear for my life
A sense of beauty finds its way in my heart
Man sees prophesied light

I see you child, the center of our universal past
Upon our fate, I know that I should not have brought your wrath
My vision's seen among the stars, but as a god, I know I've still done wrong
The fate of man:
Death at my hand
