And he'll become the gloom of your graves
Reviling all sanctity Black Angel
And he'll become a pale that will pierce you
And your carcass create desserts of rot

He will drink your torment
Fed with fears when you're lost in dread
You're lost in the abyss
And it will engorge you

He'll be infinity which rules all the spheres
Absolute evil under one flag
The great army under his command
Will bring the end of the holy land

Among combat gases vapors
And fire from death factories
Over pyres of corpses
Here marches the Black Emperor

Fed with children tears
And impaled cunt's blood
With cadavers' cum and carcass' rot
Here marches The Black Emperor

Devourer of light
With his horns proudly raised
Looking hateful at the sky
Here marches The Black Emperor

Fed with children tears
And impaled cunt's blood
With cadavers' cum and carcass' rot
Here marches The Black Emperor
