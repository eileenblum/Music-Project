Can you hear the coming storm of roaring hellfire?
Come! ... and see your pathetic world
Dying in fire of purification.
Bloodshed, genocide

Blackned end of humankind!
Opression, tyrrany
Life be gone, the truth revealed.

Flesh of lambs begins to rot.
Transgression of inhumanity
Perversion coronated
Bloodrenched worship of sodomy.

Blackned end of humankind!
Opression, tyrrany
Life be gone, the truth revealed.

Only the obdurate hearts
Are destined to conquer and rule 
From the throne of abomination
I scatter the ashes of dying generations.
Manifestation of rapacious will 
The madness of yesterday becomes the logic of tomorrow 
World collpase unleashes the vengeful ones 
Fall from grace, the predators are no longer chained.

This the dawn of obscurity
This the dawn of a new aeon
The revelation of annihilation
Devourment of pitiful life.

Flesh of lambs begins to rot.
Transgression of inhumanity
Perversion coronated
Bloodrenched worship of sodomy.
Can you hear the coming storm of roaring hellfire?
Come and see your pathetic world
Dying in fire of purification.
