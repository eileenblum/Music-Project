So you can call me evil
Because I am dangerous
So you can call me sick
Because I've thrown away my shackles

The Devil's law of rebeilion 
I'm spreading it among you,
The Devil's law of enslavement
I command you to follow.
So we are the new breed
The ones that can't be broken.

So you can call me evil
Because I am dangerous
So you can call me sick
But you are just too fucking blind to see!

I am pain, I am hate,
Superior breed, The Devils's seed.
I am war, I am the call
Conqueror breed, the evil seed.
Nihilistic hatred and conquering will.
Carnal lust and infernal bloodthirst!

"Christianity has taken the part of all the weak, the low, the botched; it has made an ideal out of antagonism to all the self-preservative instincts of sound life; it has corrupted even the faculties of those natures that are intellectually most vigorous, by representing the highest intellectual values as sinful, as misleading, as full of temptation"
[Nietsche]

Hellspawn - unbridled desires materialized
Warlust - world peace denied
Outbreak - idols smashed with the hammer of fate
Victory - defamatory subjection failed (with life)

The Devil's law of rebeilion 
I'm spreading it among you,
The Devil's law of enslavement
I command you to follow.
So we are the new breed
The ones that can't be broken.
So you can call me sick
But you are just too fucking blind to see!
