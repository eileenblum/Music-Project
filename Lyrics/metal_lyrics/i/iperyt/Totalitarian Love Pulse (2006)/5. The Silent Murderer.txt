Infect yourself, you dirty human insect
Smell the stench of death,
fall on your knees, taking your last breath!
There's no god, no christ or virgin mary,
just worthless icons of christian misery.
We are the silent murderer,
the great messiah for human toxic slavery!

We don't need symbols and false saints
We are the toxin and are here to poison your life
We bring pestilence to redeem with vengeance
We crush all the holiness and faith
We are born from hellfire
To plague into you one fucking thousand knives

No compromises or empty promises
but machine gun bullet in the middle of your whorehead.

Extreme war machinery
Mass murder mastery
Genocide and sodomy
Rise the flag for victory

here's no god, no christ or virgin mary,
just worthless icons of christian misery.
We are the silent murderer,
the great messiah for human toxic slavery!

The silent murderer
against the life you love
The silent murderer
against your modern world
The silent murderer
against the brainless mass
The silent murderer
against your worthless gods
