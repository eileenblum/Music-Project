Welcome to my dreamworld where human life equals shit.
Welcome to your nightmare, worse than anything you've ever dreamt of.
No freedom of speech, no freedom of choice.
Ubiquitous terror crushing human contagion.
Heavy with lust, iron on the face of man with ancient power.
Totalitarian beauty decorated with the blood of so-called innocent.
When there is no human rights, the true nature of man is revealed and unleashed.
The answer of everything what's covered by illusion, lies beyond the knowledge of life.
Now, when peace is dead and all the holiness is desecrated, can you see unquestionable presence of what dwells within?
Look at those piles of nameless grotesque bodies.
No words of truth shall be spoken anymore, taste the end of yours...
