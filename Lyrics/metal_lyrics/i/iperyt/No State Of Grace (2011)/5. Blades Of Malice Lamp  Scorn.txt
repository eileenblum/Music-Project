We pervert your truths and tighten your chains
Adoring the decay of miserable order
We rape the bodies of the daughters of man
From the shattered cunt of Gaia we are born again

This is the entrance to spiritual barbarism
The perverse gospel of morbidity
The touch of the darkness infinite
A rotten hand that rocks the cradle of shit

We dance in the ashes of masters and slaves
We mock your lives and spit on your graves
We rape the bodies of the daughters of man
From the shattered cunt of Gaia we are born again

We shroud your pieties with urine and shit
We vomit upon your nightmares and dreams
We drink the blood of the sinners and saints
As the servants of the god of terror and hate

1000 Blades of malice
To slit the throat of any saviour
1000 blades of scorn
To cut the flesh of every creator

Eternal malignant goal
Forever-burning flame

We shroud your pieties with urine and shit
We vomit upon your nightmares and dreams
We drink the blood of the sinners and saints
As the servants of the God of terror and hate
