Nothing is illusion, everything is true
And it is in the nature of man to be good
Maybe there's no good, but he still loves us all
And I can promise you the world will never fall

Everyone is equal, everyone deserves to live
Every live is sacred, even if spent on your knees
Maybe we're like rats, but who really cares?
And I can promise you I don't play any game 

Keep your eyes closed
Keep your eyes closed
Keep your eyes closed
Keep your eyes closed

I just love watching you rot
Falling into the void of shit
I don't want to open your eyes
I just love watching you bleed

Ignorance is a blessing
So please stay blind
We're just a small rusty nail
In the coffin of your kind

So keep your eyes closed...
