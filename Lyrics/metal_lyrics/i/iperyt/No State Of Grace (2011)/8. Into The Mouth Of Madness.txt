Let's fuck the life from behind
The madness calls for an answer
The injection of insanity

Let's fuck the perverse tango star
In every hole possible
A brutal rape of normality

We dance on the edge
Crossing the boundaries, rejecting fucking control
Spitting at the face of the world, total abuse
Vomiting with disgust, ready to kill
Revelation of rabid ferocious will

S.I.C.K.

We find the real beauty
Among the ruins of existence
We transgress and evolve
Through self-induced possession

Let's fuck the life from behind
The madness calls for an answer
The injection of morbidity

Let's fuck the perverse tango star
In every hole possible
A brutal rape of sanity

Upon the nihilistic wings of perdition we fly
Across the starless sky of negativity
Wreaking havoc upon the miserable existence
We look into the abyss knowing well
The abyss also looks into us

Into the mouth of madness
Adoration of negativity
Into the mouth of madness
Fuck the life and sanity
