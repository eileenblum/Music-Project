No fucking feelings
No remorse
The factory of terror
Takes its repugnant course

Total violation
Of all that's human and pure
Dehumanisation
Set as a general rule

Cold-blooded dominator
Antihuman hate generator

Some aspirations can't be measured or destroyed
Like a sacred voice that awakens what lies dormant
Still I can see the future of your kind
Great as a view from six feet underground

The preacher of sedition
The enemy of man
The hater of fucking universe
To crush your castle of sand

The longing for oblivion
The erasure of sin
Eternally enshrouded
By the sardonic grin

Total violation
Of all that's human and pure
Dehumanisation
Set as a general rule

Some thoughts and desires cannot be killed
And like cancer I will be eating through your world
I can clearly see the future of your kind
Black as a view from six feet underground
