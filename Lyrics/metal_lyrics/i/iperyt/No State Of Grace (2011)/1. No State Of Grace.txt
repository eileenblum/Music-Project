The blade of terror shines again
The pounding sickness is back
The flag of hatred is raised even higher
The third antihuman attack

We wield the banners of nihilism
Fistfucking God's creation
Emissaries of the fall
The aristocratic abomination

No state of grace
No step back
Semper fi
In cold fucking blood

Nothing to prove
Just a poisonous joy

Can you see the beauty of demise?
A world of shit through the dead eyes?
Another step over the line
To extol the social decline

Oh, ascend, ascend the Star of Perdition
Enlighten the universe with your purifying glitter

The soldiers of terror advance
The silent murderer is back
The vulture of terror flies again
The third antihuman attack

We wield the banners of nihilism
Fistfucking God's creation
Emissaries of the fall
The aristocratic abomination

No state of grace
No step back
Semper fi
In cold fucking blood

Can you see the beauty of demise?
A world of shit through the dead eyes?
Another step over the line
To extol the social decline
