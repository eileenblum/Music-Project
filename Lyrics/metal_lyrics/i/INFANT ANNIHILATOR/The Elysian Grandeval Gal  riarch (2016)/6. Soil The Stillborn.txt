Lifeless little creatures, 
Prepared for the priest,
Torn from the womb then seduced and consumed,
Soil the stillborn,
Harvested for pleasure and greed,
Puncture the lungs of every being under three years of age,
Twisted experiments to separate souls from flesh,
In an effort to dine upon what the Lord has blessed,
I will find a way to rape your spirit and implant my seed,
Deep in the ether I shall forge a paradise of death and despair,
Gigantic monuments that touch the clouds deliciously depict the pedophilic necrophilic lust to force myself inside fallen children,
I am a divine child defiler,
Incestuous preaching liar,
I,
I will define,
Fear and all that is unholy,
The nursery is dimly lit as I now lurk among the cribs,
Medical charts like paper tombstones,
The cradle calls me in,
As I mount the bassinet my cock erupts insanity,
My visions impure their infantile features beckon to me,
As I thrust I feel the immature soul leave through me,
I remove myself, 
Her dead flesh is still sweating as I dig out her infantile intestines,
Pedophiles draped in holy robes,
Stillborn child limp and broken,
Men of Christ believing prophecies from a book of lies,
Rape,
Rape,
Unjustified mistreating,
Relentless bleeding and anal seeping,
Rape,
I feel the soul leave through me,
Her dead flesh is still sweating as I dig out her infantile intestines,
Soil the stillborn,
Soil the stillborn,
Soil the stillborn,
Fucked in the name of God,
The cradle rocks as the wood begins to splinter,
I shove my cock into this newborn infant's sphincter,
