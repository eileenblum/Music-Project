Come one, come all

I present my whore-spawn halls
A stadium of savagery
Hear the cries of the talent
Witness my beauties on display
Behold my vision of rampant lust
I begin by picking away at the chest cavity
Slowly sliding myself through the bellyâ lathered in sputum
Elbow deepâ like a puppetâ a sadist ventriloquist
Deep in the anus of the supple subjects

Come one, come all
I am the harvester of used newborns
Cum in one, cum in them all
Fucked to death before they crawl

My glorious waltz of deathâ a seductive surgical Hell
They come from all around the world to see my spectacle of filth
Etch my name in history
Majestic, sadistic, insidious
Neuroticâ demonic, insidious

An exhibit, quite exquisite
A vulgar display of ecstasy
An exhibit, most exquisite
A sinful display, perverse ecstasy
Fisting the fractured fetus
Squeezing the life out of the baby
Prepubescent perfection
Flawless specimen, fondle the foreskin raw

My glorious waltz of death, a seductive surgical Hell
They come from all around the world to see my spectacle of filth
Majestic, sadistic, insidious

Incision, insertion, I fondle the foreskin
Serrated, sedated, labia fixated
Carving, craving, lost in misbehaving
Engaging, enslaving, erotic gaping
The crowd roars in glee at the mounds of mangled flesh debris

Come one, come all
I am the harvester of used newborns
Cum in one, cum in them all
Fucked to death before they crawl
