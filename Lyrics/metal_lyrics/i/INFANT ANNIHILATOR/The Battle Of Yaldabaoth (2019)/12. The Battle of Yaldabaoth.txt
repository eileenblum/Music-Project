[feat. Alex Teyen]The battle had barely begun before bodies like mountains piled up towards the sun.
Blood flows, like a flood crimson mud washes over the land where civilization once stood.
All the while the war wages on, the weak fall quickly to the mighty and strong.
And they wail as they fail to withstand the cataclysmic defeat that has been brought upon.
Fantasised genocide, imperial subdivide, humanoid pesticide, indiscriminate, fratricide.
A war of filth and harrowed souls, with none left living once the battle unfolds.
The trees only allow a peek of light, a glimmer of hope.
Rip them limb, from limb, from limb. Burn their bodies and char the skin.
Crush their bones into dust and feed the wind. Eat their hearts with a threatening grin.
All the while the war wages on.
Many have fled and now all hope has gone.
The wounded cry and try to escape the never ending slaughter that has just begun.
As the warriors erase the fiends unclean, the King sits in his dwindling throne.
His mind is filled with only loathing and woe, and with open eyes hes paralysed.
His gaze fixed upon the legions of heretics; demoralized.
Rivers of atrocities, miles of monstrosities, a grim stream of desolation and misery.
May the hopeless sing through their journey to the damned.
And deep underneath the flourishing life lies death.
The roots entwined in the rotting; the warriors of primal supremacy.
Prostitutes of war decaying in the dirt for all eternity.
Feeding the pines, the valley of swine slaughtered for their faith.
The horns sound once more in the deep, drums in the deep.
Hell upon hell, death beyond reach. All howling voids and torment beneath, swallow me please and let me sleep. Though I know the dark is swarming with teeth.
