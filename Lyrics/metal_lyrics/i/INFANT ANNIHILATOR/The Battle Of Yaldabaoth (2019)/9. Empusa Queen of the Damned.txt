I tiptoe, through the tulips drenched in anal fluid.
Through the flowers splattered in cum and vomit.
Smothered in petals and mucus.
Admiring my Eden of filth.
Limp little sluts, lay upon the lilies.
Leeched virgin waste flushed of their purity.
Stroking the slain supple specimen draped over me as I bathe.
In the fountain of placenta.
Submerged and staring in the sky, with a glimmer of lust in my eye.
And the woods hanging overhead adorned with suffocating mothers.
I reach below, and smite my hole.
Gasps and screams, gurgles and moans, ravish my ears in delight.
Children surround me; dead decaying beauties aid me to scratch the itch inside.
Join me in my garden of gorging.
I am The Maiden of Molestation.
Queen of quivering infants, masturbating in violent glee.
Thriving on defenceless beings, while their mothers hang from trees.
Stuff myself to ecstasy
Cradling the fetus I deflower and abuse.
Their purity gives me everlasting youth.
Caress their puny bodies, feeding on their suffering.
See the discontent and fear my name.
I am the Maiden, Queen of the Damned.
I am the Maiden, Queen of the Damned.
The wind carries the entrancing stench of rotting fleshlings.
Their scrumptious suffering preserves my eternal beauty.
Through me they bore in sorrow, bore in want, and woe, and strife.
This same weight of human weakness, the same weary human life.
Stuff myself to ecstasy!
Gallons of pungent lubricants and mangled munchkins leak.
Oozing from my loins down to my knees.
Bathing in puss, washing in a flood of placenta.
Draining the blood, nourishing the mud of the garden.
Limp little sluts lay upon the roots, tombless infant graves.
Limp little sluts lay upon the roots, tombless infant graves.
Sorrowing one who weepest sore, know they past cannot be restored.
All thine youth consumed and lost, by the Maidens hand, you've paid thy cost.
I am the Maiden, Queen of the Damned.
I am the Maiden, Queen of the Damned.
