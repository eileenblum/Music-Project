Littered with carnage, continents crumbled by the crusades of rape.
The catastrophe of cock and divine desires, a deviant plague.
Humanity reduced to rotting fetish fiends, between the sun and the moon, the earth now bleeds.
A world dismantled and doomed, defiled and decimated.
The rebellion dwindled as the weak reaped corpses as prey, humanity reduced to rotting fetish fiends.
Between the sun and the moon, the earth now bleeds.
The gods that gifted them a necrophiliac, paedophilic paradise applaud the nobility and sacrifice.
Beneath the dead all soil and slay, forever in fire the price they pay.
Trumpets bellow in the deep, as the victors call Where is your King?
The soulless kneel down at their feet and weep, repenting to the gods they now fear.
Forever in fire, forever in fire
Devastated, desecrated, lubricated, penetrated, decimated, defecating, trembling in fear; so commences their fate.
Manifested, uncontested, consecrated, venerated, motivated; ready to reclaim their rightful place, as the bringers of heresy.
Dead in the soil, forever in fire.
Humanity reduced to rotting fetish fiends, beneath the sun and the moon, the earth now bleeds.
Eternity in the dwelling place of misery, beneath the sun and the moon, the earth now bleeds.
