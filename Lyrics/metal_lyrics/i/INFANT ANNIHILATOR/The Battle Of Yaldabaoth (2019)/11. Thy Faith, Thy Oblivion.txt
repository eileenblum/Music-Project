From the podium to the pit, the Royal gown stripped, in a filthy robe I sit.
Gaze cast toward my broken sons birthed, I smirk as I stare at the worst of the cursed.
Descendant of rage struck with fear and disease, the children are cattle to use as I please.
Long live the King, of violent rape and savagery.
Long live the King, a masquerade of nobility.
I lay on the floor with half dead whores, humming the ballad of their fallen mothers.
Erotic evisceration, organ asphyxiation, each stroke stokes the flames of completion.
I am the King, malevolent master of sodomy.
A misanthropic tyrant dwelling beneath your glorious majesty.
Broken screams emphasize the beauty of their melody, resonating in my chamber of chastity.
The rhythm of shackles falls in sync with my thrusting
A fairy tale of feral fornication.
The guillotine raised, I bound the gag the soiled and bleeding, the enslaved now weak from hours of mistreating.
My passion finally meets its end.
I pull the chain the blade descends upon those prostrated, my fetish is freed.
I fill the beheaded with my heinous seed.
I am the King, malevolent master of sodomy
Succumb to the saint of soiled sin.
I am the King, I am the King
Praise to the Pastor, the Peerless Prince.
I am the King, I am the King
A vulture of gutted cunts, masturbator of skinned cocks
Addicted to the aroma of death and cum, sweet sweat scented skin, erupting excrement, smothered in menstrual fluid, rancid sticky sensation, rubbing rectal leakage on my shaft in sequence.
I am the King, malevolent master of sodomy.
Long live the King, of violent rape and savagery.
