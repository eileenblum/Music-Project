[feat. Storm Strope]Footsteps seep through the dead air as he creeps closer to the chair
Rocking back and forth
A succubus and his heir
"Six years since your birth, time to seal your destiny on this Earth"

The ceremonial ritual of Our Father
The mother fucked and consumed at the altar
The thirteenth son
The demon spawn
Devoured and defiled
Flayed and torn

Statues of iron stare as he thrusts
Rectum exposed as the tormented souls watch
Mammoth-like tusk
Throbbing deep
Mangling his mother with serrated teeth
His legacy fulfilled, like father like son
For the child, born dead, a new life has begun

But this is the spark that triggered his end
The child, now man, declares his intent

[Storm Strope]
The ceremonial ritual of Our Father
The mother fucked and consumed at the altar
The thirteenth son
The demon spawn
Devoured and defiled
Flayed and torn

I am the Bringer
I am the Taker
I am hate's purest form
And when I'm done with this Kingdom
You will know fear once more

Scum, heed my words
There shall be no hope
There will be no end to your suffering
For the Devil himself fears my name
Scum, heed my words
There will be no hope

What you call fear is but a shadow of its truest form
For I am God
And there is no other God beside me

Statues of iron stared as I thrust
Rectum exposed as the demented souls watched
Mammoth-like tusk
Throbbing deep
I mangled my mother with serrated teeth

"Meet your maker for I am God
And there is no other God beside me"
