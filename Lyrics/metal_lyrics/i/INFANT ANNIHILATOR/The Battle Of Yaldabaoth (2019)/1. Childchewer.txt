The cattle of the shepherd shall mourn
There is no death for me to fear for Christ my Lord hath died.
There is no curse in this my pain, for his beliefs were crucified.

The sun sets, the blood delivered, the earth will drown in a crimson river.

The world, the flesh, the lust, the devil, in league intend thy ruin.
And every breath leads onto death and works thy souls undoing.
Down in the lake of Hell, await the endless condemnation.
To sleep is sure destruction and a fiery indignation.

The sun sets, the blood delivered, the earth will drown in a crimson river.

I am of Death that dieth never; I am the gulf that burns forever.
O come to Christ for pardon from sin and Satan. Sever and sink into the
flames to dwell amidst the lost forever. Forever.
