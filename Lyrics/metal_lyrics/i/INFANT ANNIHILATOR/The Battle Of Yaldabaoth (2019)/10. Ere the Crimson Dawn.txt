All over the world, their banners unfurled.
O mighty war lords, GalÃ©ria restored!
They've watched that darkest hour of night,
Whose gloom precedes the dawn of light.
That solemn hour when silence, deep, seals not the eyes of those that weep.
The light will die at the end of days, like shadows have the mighty passed away.
Around the world, their banners unfurl, soon to hear the shouts of war.
Like the waves of the tumultuous sea, that break upon the shattered earth, and quake the ground eternally.
Tides; a swarm of the helpless enthralled will falter, then die and litter the soil.
Tides; a swarm of the helpless enthralled will falter, then die and litter the soil.
They've watched that darkest hour of night, whose gloom precedes the light.
The ill-fated souls lie down in the crepuscular dusk, and with none to make afraid.
Leaning calmly towards the river, dimly gleaming through the shade.
Death shall seem but summer darkness, for they underestimate the void; unknown.
There they shall merge into the fire that is breaking from below.
Mountains eclipse the sky, the kingdom is lost to the night.
