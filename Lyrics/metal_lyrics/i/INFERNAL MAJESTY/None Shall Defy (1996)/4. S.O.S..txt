[Music:Terror]
[Lyrics:Psychopath]

Consume the flesh the heart still beats let the feast begin
Tonight the rules unholy king we worship him with sin
to feel his touch to know his love to look into his eyes
Don't try to run there's no escape prepare yourself to die!

Satan our saviour one evil favour is all we ask of you
Satan our saviour do us this honour destroy the righteous few
Satan our saviour there is none greater we crave they blackest love
Satan our saviour wicked creator baptize them in their blood...

Let fires burn and swords drink blood annihilate the pure
Wage war against the innocent worship the crimson whore
Fall to your knees and bow your head pay homage to the beast
And as your faith begins to fail his power shall increase!

Satan our saviour one evil favour is all we ask of you
Satan our saviour do us this honour destroy the righteous few
Satan our saviour there is none greater we crave they blackest love
Satan our saviour wicked creator baptize them in their blood...

[LEAD-Terror]

Satan our saviour - Lord of hell!
Satan our saviour - Demon god!
Satan our saviour - Evil king!
Satan our saviour...

[LEAD-Terror]

Satan our saviour one evil favour is all we ask of you
Satan our saviour do us this honour destroy the righteous few
Satan our saviour there is none greater we crave they blackest love
Satan our saviour wicked creator baptize them in their blood...
