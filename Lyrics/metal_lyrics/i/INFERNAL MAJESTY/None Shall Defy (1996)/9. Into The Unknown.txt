[Music:Terror]
[Lyrics:Psychopath &amp; Bailey]

Darkness descends,I see you lying below
You're feeling my power coursing through your soul
I am the creator of the unknown
I am your nightmare with you all alone

Unleashing my power,you're in my control
Retaining possession I will lever let go
My visions are present I'll make them seem true
Nothing can stop me nothing you can do
Come here,in here with me...with me

Fearful of the silent evil that I put into your mind
I'll never let you wake,never let you wake
You are screaming but unheard they are only soundless cries
I maintain authority I'll take your life at any time
I'll never let you wake,never let you wake
Can you feel the dark destruction emanating from my eyes
In time,you'll be mine, and I'll lead you in
into the unknown...follow me...

Confront the flight the fear within it will never leave
Tonight's the night,the endless night as I conduct the scene
Embark with me,hands embraced to cross the final path
Resent me,flee my wish I'll keep my deadly grasp

[LEAD-Hallman]

Darkness Descends,I see you lying below
Your feeling my power coursing through your your soul
I'm the creator of the unknown
Leaving this nightmare with you all alone
In here with me
