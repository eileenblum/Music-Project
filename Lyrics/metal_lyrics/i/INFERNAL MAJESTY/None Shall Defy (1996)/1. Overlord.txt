[LEAD-Terror]

Battle Of the ages,good and evil waging war for mankind's soul
Centuries,Milleniums,spent in futile struggle for the prize and
the reward already given to the demon the oppressor
Vanguish the resustant,subjugate.Victimize the meek and the mild
Unholy power reign supreme.Ruling all,fist of fear,a mighty weapon to be 
wielded
Sparing none,who dare oppose,redemption is the trademark of a goodamn fool

Overlord - Still you fight though the cause is lost,hail the victor master 
of this earth
Overlord - The weak of mind owe no debt,fables of salvation are stories of 
the past

Electronic prophets,so called righteous virtue's their disguise
Intentions,camouflaged,they weave their clever tales of myth and swear by
all that's holy that they speak the gospel truth they're lying bastards
Dominate the destitute,circumvent.Persecute the conscience of the masses
Helplessly the feeble follow
Call it right,it's really wrong,answer to the dark one in the end
Secretly,blasphemy ,testimony proving good will not always prevail

Overlord - Betrayed by those you called your own,gleam of silver negates 
loyalty
Overlord - Blackness spreading across the land,countless graves cry out and 
curse your name

[LEAD-Terror]
[LEAD-Hallman]

Death advances shouting kill destroy,slaves surrender fearing blood shall 
flow
Faith disappears from the bravest of heroes when death's icy grip holds 
their life in it's grasp
Marching defiant the legions bear witness to stand against evil means you 
stand alone!
