[Music:Hallman]
[Lyrics:Psychopath &amp; Bailey]

Elongated twisted human form suffocating in the darkness sweat streaming
down his skin distorted thoughts of torment you
haven't been to hell until you've reached the perils of a schizophrenic mind

Skeletons in the closet beckoning come and join us evil corpses from a 
distant past...

Delusions of prosecution invade reaching out I'm in their grasp
there is no escape from this apparition warped and twisted out of state
submitted commited to this hellish fate knuckles gripping white muscles
locked writihing mass of bones thriving on this psychic energy

Skeletons in the closet beckoning come and join us evil corpses from a 
distant past...

[LEAD-Hallman]

Crushed beneath their frozen stare your dead remains will soon be their's
screaming through the fires of hell your soul escapes from mindless 
torment...

[LEAD-Hallman]

Crushed beneath their frozen stare your dead remains will soon be their's
screaming through the fires of hell your soul escapes from mindless 
torment...

[LEAD-Hallman]

Revel in the bloodshed gloating in the anguish laughing as the axe falls 
leaving him
fucked!  playing havoc with his mind tripping into death's euphoria their 
rotting minds

Skeletons in the closet beckoning come and join us evil corpses from a 
distant past...
