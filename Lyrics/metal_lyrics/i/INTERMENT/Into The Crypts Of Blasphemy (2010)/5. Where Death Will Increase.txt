The dead will arise 
Like an angel sent from hell 
Blasphemy of life 
Crawling out from it''s shell 

Suffocation - Torment will appear 

Awakening of the dawn 
Upon the altars of damnation 
A morbid chapel far beyond 
Sea of graves in devastation 

Blasphemy - Hear my fucking cries 

There will be a place 
Where death will increase 
There will be a fucking place 
Where death will increase 

Come to me, lords of death 
Bring me to your empire 
Beyond the evil darkness 
Awaits, the flames of fire 

Immolation - Your life has dissappear 

There will be a place 
Where death will increase 
There will be a fucking place 
Where death will increase 

Cremation, with a sarcastic greed 
Crawling worms in consumed feed
