It works its way inside
It freaks me out, it hurts me so much
That I can stand the way I was, I am and I will be

Please give me something to deride my curiosity
Just give me something to pretend that I'm InsideaD

Come and get meâ¦

Don't treat me with disdain
No more.. No more..
Give me something to die for
Pure. More.. 2x4

I'm gonna break your wall
I'm gonna hurt you more
I told you not to mess with me again..motherfucker

I'm sent here not alone
Against your own, against your law
I raise my fist, I raise my strength
Detect your lies within your eyes

People eat your lies..
I will refuse you, I will reduce you to obedience..
Set my anger free..
I'll give you rage for free..

Come and get me..

Don't treat me with disdain
No more.. No more..
Give me something to die for
Pure. More.. 2x4

I'm gonna break your wall
I'm gonna hurt you more
I told you not to mess with me again

I'm dreaming a world without you
Waiting for the next days' truth alone
Praying, 'cause I see no future
Waiting 'cause the New Dawn fades away
