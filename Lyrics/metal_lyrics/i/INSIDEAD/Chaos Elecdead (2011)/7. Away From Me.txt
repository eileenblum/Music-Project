Look in the mirror remind me how is freedom
These scars are as old as myself
Accept the fact that I've denied
My thoughts are ingrained stains in my brain

In madness i belong, when I am the truth for myself
Remind me the impurity inside me makes me
Feel alone, no more slave of consequences

Never be away from me
The moments that have left for me
The times that I have spent for me
Never be away from me

I'm gathering you today
To uncover a plot against myself
From here to there I think I roam
Maybe onlyâ¦

In madness I belong,when I am the truth for myself
Remind me that I'm drown in lies and I can't trust me
The enemy who betrays me in every step I do

Never be away from me
The moments that have left for me
The times that i have spent for me
Never be away from me

To be just free is hard enough for me
To breathe, to live is hard enough for me
