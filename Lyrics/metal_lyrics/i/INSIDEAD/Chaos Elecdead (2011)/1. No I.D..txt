Dead mind against the rules
Another day, another pray in vain again
See meâ¦ hear me.
Just tell me what I need to heal me

No name, no I.D.
A big nothing just left to be
Nailed into my head..
Nailed into my chest.

Tell me what I am
Come on and tell me what I am
I need to tell me what I am.
Just tell me what' da fuck I am.

I count the sand under the sun
I count the stars please give me one
I lick my wounds I make them bleed
Tell me what I needâ¦

No faith, no belief
In human race I lead
Sadness, sorrow
In every breath I think they follow

Sometimes I feel respect
Somehow I feel the pain
Nailed into my chest..
Nailed into my eyes..

I count the sand under the sun
I count the stars please give me one
I lick my wounds I make them bleed
Tell me what I needâ¦
