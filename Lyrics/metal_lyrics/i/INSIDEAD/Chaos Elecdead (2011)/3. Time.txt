I wish I could forget the past
Without it I will feel alone
I hope that it won't be too late
From now and then I'm on my own

I feel so tired to live alone
To walk away in a lonely road
I hope that it won't be too late
From now and then I'm on my own

Time.. Just thinking my crime
I'm searching for a sign
To keep my eyes open the next time

Fine.. I'm feeling so fine
Even though reach the end of the line
I'm thinking just my life

I wish I could perceive myself
That I can sail in seas of my dreams
Being always afraid
Of whatever I wanted and wished for
So many times I was in despair
'Cause I've got nowhere to go
There are so many wounds which are made of myself
When I wanted and wished for

Time.. Just thinking my crime
I'm searching for a sign
To keep my eyes open the next time

Fine.. I'm feeling so fine
Even though reach the end of the line
I'm thinking just my life
