I don't know where I am, is this a fucking prison?
I feel so cold, my body aches..
I can't explain, keep searching for a reason
Neurotic reactions take over my head

Is my blood running on my hands?
Is your blood running on my hands?

I'll be the nails inside your brain
It's time to fall into disgrace
I'll be the poison in your veins
It's time for me to take revenge

I feel infected by your will
Destroy my thoughts and the way I have decided to live
I will stand and I live to see you dead
Just to make you hear my laughter
As you cry and pray for revenge

GO!

Is my blood running on my hands?
Is your blood running on my hands?

I'll be the nails inside your brain
It's time to fall into disgrace
I'll be the poison in your veins
It's time for me to take revenge

My revenge is faithless..
