Build your world on the sand
Count the days that are left to you
See your future like a product
Sell yourself and be the next in line

Beg me..
You were deceived into believing that..
You will be free
Have no fear

Live in chaos
Learn to use your eyes
Live in order to feel free
Live in chaos
Live for nothing more than peace

Kiss the healing hand
Ask forgiveness, don't be late
Sell yourself in special price
Have a sit and buy me

Save me..
I'm not to be compared to how I was
Before..
Outlive the fear

Kiss the healing hand
Ask forgiveness, don't be late
Sell yourself in special price
Have a sit and buy me

I empty my mind
Close my eyes before I die
I have to keep the faith
My heart empties after dusk

See right through meâ¦

I empty my mind
Close my eyes before I die
I have to keep the faith
My heart empties after dusk
