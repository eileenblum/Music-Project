Travelling through time
Searching every different race
Learning strange human tales

Water the tree of hate
With fake promises
Shading apocalypse

Found out the second face
Of truth and happiness
Profane the sacred name of your god
What's his real name
Green paper, greedy taker

When I count my scars
Just take a look at me
And just forgive me
Second face of truth

When I want to crash your head
To wipe the human virus out of your brain
Second face of truth

Just being eyeless
Just being helpless

Please touch my leper skin
Maybe something good will happen to me
Will happen to me

When I count my scars
Just take a look at me
And just forgive me
Second face of truth

When I want to crash your head
To wipe the human virus out of your brain
Second face of truth

You did it once, you do it once again
Come on..come on
Come on..come on
Beat me, bite me
Spit on me, come on
Dream on, cry for me
Do it for me, do it for me
Yeah..
