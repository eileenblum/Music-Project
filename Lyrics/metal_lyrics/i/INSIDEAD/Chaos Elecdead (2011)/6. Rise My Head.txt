Hear my words, they're made of pain
Hear my words, they speak of disdain
Leave no choice just hear my voice
We're not your slaves, we're no more toys

I am the one that makes you bleed
I know you well, that makes me sick
Reign of error, reign of terror
Bite the chains and live forever

Please help me god, give me strength
Leave me be that innocent
Please help me god to raise my head
Leave me be that innocent

Try to blind me..
So come on, so come on, so come
Let's try to blind me..
So come on, so come on, so come on
Let's try to blind me..

All turned away your face
All turned away your race
Nothing else left to do
Nothing else is left to say

Blood for blood
Eye for an eye
My open sores I leave behind
Your hate is over, all too soon
I grieve for youâ¦

Please help me god, give me strength
Leave me be that innocent
Please help me god to raise my head
Leave me be that innocent
