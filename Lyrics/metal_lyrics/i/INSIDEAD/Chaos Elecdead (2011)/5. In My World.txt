Blessed with pure sins of silence
The only known cure for fear is fate
Never prey but always sentenced
Inside my own skin, I'm feeling hunger
In my soulâ¦

But never shines in my world
Always rains in my world
I cannot find what key is the word
Always rainsâ¦in my world

Mind's solitary, soul's humility
The walls are closing in
I have to get away

Seeds of god who I never knew
Never felt before
Berate me and hate me and hurt
My soulâ¦

But never shines in my world
Always rains in my world
I cannot find what key is the word
Always rains

But never shines in my world
Always rains in my world
I cannot find what key is the word
Always rains

Release me
Forgive me
