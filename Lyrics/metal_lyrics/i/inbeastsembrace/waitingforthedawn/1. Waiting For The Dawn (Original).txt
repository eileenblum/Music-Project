An ancient city is embraced
By the plague of the beast.
Doors and windows are boarded up,
And no one glad to meet a stranger.
The most citizens already lost
Their humanity and mind.
The night of the hunt has begun,
Run away as fast as you can.

Every lane is fraught with danger,
Every step can be the last.
Distraught creature is prowling around
In anticipation of sweet blood.
Maybe there is some place,
Which is still safely from the beasts.
Maybe there is still a chance
Not to be torn to pieces.

I pray to outlast this night.
I wish to see the morning light.
It's so hard to take a breath,
'Cause air smells of blood and death.
The blood-red moon hangs in the sky.
I hear creatures's howl and victim's cry.
Don't wanna feel the beast's embrace,
Don't wanna follow bloody trace.

Don't wanna follow bloody trace.

I hope that chapel is safe place.
The quiet angle where is no chase.
Dim light of candles disperse the gloom,
I feel the scent of incense in the fume.
Under the arches of the nave
I hope that God will save his slave.
And I will meet tomorrow's dawn,
And all this nightmare will be gone.
