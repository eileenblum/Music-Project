Chaos in the streets of ancient town.
Transformed creatures roaming around.
They've lost humanity of blood possession.
They've lost their minds...

The blood of Great Ones in my veins,
I see that others never seen.
But it's not faculty, it's my damnation,
Even in death there is no salvation.

Fear the old blood
Fear the old blood

Few people who resist blood lust
Locked their doors and never trust.
But blood-red moon will drive them mad
It's the singular end...

The blood of Great Ones in my veins,
I see that others never seen.
But it's not faculty, it's my damnation,
Even in death there is no salvation.

Fear the old blood
Fear the old blood

Nightmare and reality will soon amalgamate.
Frontier of worlds is broken.
Nightmare and reality will soon amalgamate.
And all this lands will fall in horror.

The blood of Great Ones in my veins,
I see that others never seen.
But it's not faculty, it's my damnation,
Even in death there is no salvation.

Fear the old blood
Fear the old blood
