Feel the fire
The light under the darkness
The grey
Of the last days

The final steps
Of a condemned nation
The right fate
Of the human race

This is the sign of black sun
Bringing the end of all days
This is the sign of black sun

Hear the ravenâs cry
Watching the destruction
Blood, pain, death
The earth receives the hell

The wrong way
That cursed all the men
The last days
Of the humanity

The sign of black sun

No one will survive
No one will survive
No one will survive
No one will survive

The sign of black sun

No hope
No christ
No salvation
No one will survive

The sign of black sun
The sign of black sun
The sign of black sun
The sign of black sun
