Live for all your prays
They live to trade your cross
Ask for mercilles
They ask for your grant

Get down to your god
That they invent for you
Get down for your saints
That they sell to you

6 ways
To be a slave
9 ways
To be the king
6 ways
To be a weak
9 ways
To have a reign

Before your lord
They do right using your gods

Get down to your god

Get down for your saints
That they sell to you
