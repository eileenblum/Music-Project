Falling with you nazarene
Hopeful for a new begin
Leaving all that you made
Dying in the name of faith

Searching your own truth
Giving your life your doom
Divine blood that you feel
Divine blood that killsâ¦

Weâre against you all
Weâre against you all
Masters of the truth
Weâre against you all
The blind servants of all gods

Crucifing you and them
Everybody that your god hates
Nations unable to see
More than a fake reality
