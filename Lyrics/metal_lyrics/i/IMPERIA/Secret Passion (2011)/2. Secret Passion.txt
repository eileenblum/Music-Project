Dream of fragrent flowered nightsOf passionate love and sweet delightsSuch wishful momentsIn my life to say I lie within my mindEach day and every nightCould search my whole life throughAnd never find another you I got secret passion for youAnd it's burning out my heart and soul Days are passing by eventuallyMaybe my chance of a lifetimeReduced to nothing But the more I thought ofWhat I might have had,But still I knowI will never find another you I got secret passion for youAnd it's burning out my heart and soul Could you stay in my dreamsIf you can't be realWhile I sleep foreverIn your arms Hold me, hold me,Don't let go I got secret passion for youAnd it's burning out my heart and soul
