All the pictures in my headMake me fall in the dark tunnelLike a carroussel, carroussel When someone is laying coldIn the grave while everyone elseThey are smiling around me It drives me crazySo fucking crazy SuicideIt must be heaven to meSuicideLet me fall into your relief I'm not good for any at allBroke the mirror on the wallCut myself to feel alright I smear my own blood in the faceWatch the big disgraceCovered with my own pain It drives me crazySo fucking crazy SuicideIt must be heaven to meSuicideLet me fall into your relief My wings embrace the skyDemons are the only thingLeft behind with a grin Demon takes the angel's breathTo an end in silenceThe angel cries tears in bloodAs they disappear into the sky It drives me crazySo fucking crazy SuicideIt must be heaven to meSuicideLet me fall into your relief
