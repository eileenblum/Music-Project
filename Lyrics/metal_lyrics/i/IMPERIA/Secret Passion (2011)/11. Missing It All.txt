I have been waiting in the distanceMaybe the right one had been knocking at my doorIn the meantime I've been missing it allPassion, caress and love I fly like the butterfly I amTo find my place where I will survive Need someone to lift meTo say everything is gonna be alrightSomeone stronger than myselfTo guide me along the way I fly like the butterfly I amTo find my place where I will survive I better turn around, can't stayHave to find back to my own wayTo find the things I've been missing for so longWhile you have been gone I know it's betterIf I would be one my ownBecause you constantly hurt meBy your words and what you've done I better turn around, can't stayHave to find back to my own wayTo find the things I've been missing for so longWhile you have been gone
