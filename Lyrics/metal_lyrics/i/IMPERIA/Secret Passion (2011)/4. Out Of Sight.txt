Can you tell meWho I amCould you touch meJust so I know I'm still here Could you walk with me on my roadCould you cry my tears along with meI beg you Alone, don't want to be alone My heart was openBut you closed it once againMy hopes were clearBut it all went out of sight When you see I'm hurtWould you take the pain for meWhen you see I want to give upWould you carry me through the heardache When you see I'm lostWould you leave it allTo find me back to youI beg you Alone, don't want to be alone My heart was openBut you closed it once againMy hopes were clearBut it all went out of sight My heart was openBut you closed it once againMy hopes were clearBut it all went out of sight
