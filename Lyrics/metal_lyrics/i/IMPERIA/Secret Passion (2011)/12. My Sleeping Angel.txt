She looks like a gift from GodWith her big blue eyesDeeper than the oceanWith the colour of the skies Her face is just as peacefulAs a summerbreeze at nightAnd I hope you dream of happinessAs you sleep deep and tight I love you more than lifeLittle Angelchild of mineI will always be by your sideTo make sure your eyes still shine I'll give comfort when you cryI would give my life for yoursYou should know that everything I doI'm doing just for you My little AngelWho lay hereIn my arms My little AngelI hope you willDream in the light of your halo She looks like a gift from GodWith her tiny handsThat reach out of the worldSo full of joy and innocence She takes life as it comesShe's full of trust and knows no fearAnd a bit of that comes back to meWhen I can hold her near So if I only couldI'd freeze this moment as it isAnd I'd make it yours so you could liveIn there in endless bliss Where life would never find youWith all the trouble and the painThis secret place would always giveShelter from the rain My little AngelWho lay hereIn my arms My little AngelI hope you willDream in the light of your halo
