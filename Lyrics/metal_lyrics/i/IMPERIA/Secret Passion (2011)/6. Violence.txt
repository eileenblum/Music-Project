Imagine a voiceTo say it will be okayFold my hands and pray to God Nothing changedSo I decidedm not to believeI don't believe in GodThe last hope was gone I reach out my handsImagine someone thereTo guide me to a safer place ViolenceYou are not in my life anymoreViolenceYou have been thereFrom childhood til now Feeling so smallTowards the world in front of meFeel I'm nobody at allWhile everything is changing around me I just want to hideFeel strangled inside, just want to hideIf guardian angels really existThen where are they I reach out my handsImagine someone thereTo guide me to a safer place ViolenceYou are not in my life anymoreViolenceYou have been thereFrom childhood til now
