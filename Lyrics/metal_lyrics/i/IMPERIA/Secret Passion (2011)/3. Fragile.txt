My sking fracturedCause of all I kept insideFor so long got out in the openLike a snake changing skin I'm fragileI'm so fragile within What was beforeIs everything nowHere I amWithout my skin in flesh in blood Crawling along the highway of lifeWas filled with painIt left scars, that fractured my skinI'm so fragile within I'm fragileI'm so fragile within What was beforeIs everything nowHere I amWithout my skin in flesh in blood
