I know you're going through a rought timeDon't be afraid, I've been there tooI can't tell you what to do, but after allI will be right behind you to catch you if you fall Hold on, hold onLife is a gift, don't you dare to throw it away If you could see yourself from my eyesThat would a smile upon your faceYou would feel strong enough to make it throughAnd you would walk on with your head held high Hold on, hold onLife is a gift, don't you dare to throw it away
