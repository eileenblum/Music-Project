Into the dark I seeInto the lightI want but I can't find myself Hiding away from the real worldScared I amWhile the forest hides me She wanders, she wanders aroundWhit her hear held high Let down, let downBy the people all around meAnd I reached out for heaven's warm embrace Let down, let downAnd I wipe my own tears awayLittle girl cries to heavenEnclose me in your grace For the safety, she needsThe warmth she wishes to feel Face to the wallI don't want to seeWhat's behindI turn my back to it all She wanders, she wanders aroundWith her head held high Let down, let downBy the people all around meAnd I reached out for heaven's warm embrace Let down, let downAnd I wipe my own tears awayLittle girl cries to heavenEnclose me in your grace
