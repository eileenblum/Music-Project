Can't seem to findWhat makes me happyNo matter how hard I tryIt all comes back to me Like rain,Today you comfort meYou cry more than I doSilence you are my only friend I just can't stop my tears from fallingI just can't stop my tears from falling down Like rain, rainFeeling lonelyLike rain, rainWonder where you are I'm looking leftThen looking rightBut it's all emptinessEven inside Like rain,Today you comfort meI see the light of the starsDo you see the same I just can't stop my tears from fallingI just can't stop my tears from falling down Like rain, rainFeeling lonelyLike rain, rainWonder where you are I just can't stop my tears from fallingI just can't stop my tears from falling down Like rain, rainFeeling lonelyLike rain, rainWonder where you are
