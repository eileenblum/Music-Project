Thoughts of you in the airNow that summer is hereLaying on a field of flowersLooking forwards the cloudsThey picturize you and I There's no hope for usThere's no love left for youMy heart is telling meThere's no love left for you Greed, only greed with everythingSacrifice at lastHeart brokenCan't be whole again Summerbreeze, touch my cheekWith shiny eyes and smiling faceKissing a flower Hold it to my chestAnd close my eyesAnd fall peacefully asleep There's no hope for usThere's no love left for youMy heart is telling meThere's no love left for you And so it all goes onLike a movie without an endTil it's all over stayingan forever romanticer,knowing it will alwaysSlip out of my hands
