Learning hot to smile againTo free my heartKnowing I can face the thingsThat used to seem so hard Learning how to breathe againI realizeThere is so much more to learnThat leads me back to life There is so much more to feelThe long forgotten part of meI hear it calling now The touch of your handCarries me awayTo a place where only you can enter Learning hot to smile againTo free my heartKnowing I can face the thingsThat used to seem so hard Learning how to shine againTo feel I flyKnowing after all the rainThere comes a clear blue sky There is so much more to feelThe long forgotten part of meI hear it calling now The touch of your handCarries me awayTo a place where only you can enter To feel I flyInto the clear blue sky...
