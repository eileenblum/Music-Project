Join in the dream
Feel the magic
Wise man's words find the sunstone
Make the night to day
Along the way a sword with a spell

Through the forest filled with danger
Dragons with their evil intentions
Sent by their master from the dark castle
To get the stone in his possession
To live forever life, forever life

Let the bird of loudest lay
On the sole Arabian tree
Save the eagle feathers king
Through the velvet leaves
