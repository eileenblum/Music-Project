How can you see when your eyes are closed?
I'm damned to fail
To cry a river of tears
Living in a world far beyond
Wolves mourning at night in my dreams
My bleeding heart will never heal
One more tear of blood will make it die

How can I feel when my heart got lost?
How can I have faith when I cannot trust?
I'm scared for love

You faded the sparkled eyes
Where is happiness?
In my dreams I'm free
Dancing in the sun
Let my dying soul be

How can I feel when my heart got lost?
How can I have faith when I cannot trust?
I'm scared for love

Empty room, empty hope, is this my destiny?
The stars will shine forevermore
I'm just one falling
Will I find the peace?
That light to the dark clouds

How can I feel when my heart got lost?
How can I have faith when I cannot trust?
I'm scared for love
