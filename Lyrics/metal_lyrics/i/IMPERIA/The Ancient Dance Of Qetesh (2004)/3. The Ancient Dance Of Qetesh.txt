Wish there were another world to choose
Wish all hatred could just disappear
Wish the shade that covers my hopes
Would not be there

The dance of Qetesh
Moves like a snake
The dance of Qetesh

Wish the stars showed me the way
Wish my destiny's gateway were lighter
So I could see more clear
I'm dancing the dance of Qetesh

The dance of Qetesh
Moves like a snake
The dance of Qetesh
