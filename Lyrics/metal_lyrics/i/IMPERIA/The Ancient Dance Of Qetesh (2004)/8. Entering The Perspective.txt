The day has come and the world is waiting in the open
A timeless stream of violence is written on the walls
The endlessness has reached out its final destiny
And the hope of man has gone into a dreamers mind

Can you see those eyes of falling faith?
Can you sense the smell of non belief?
Will you realise when it's time to die?
Can you feel the need to stay awake?

Into the point of no return
The day is new and the world appears in a new delight
How can that be?
From where I stand is hard to see faces of reality
The insanity of the prophecy

Can you see those eyes of falling faith?
Can you sense the smell of non belief?
Will you realise when it's time to die?
Can you feel the need to stay awake?

Enter the field where silence sleeps
Where the demons on your way is all you see
Enter the flames of love and of hate
To receive the voices of dismay
Enter the gates of demarcation
The calling of desperate
Enter the centre of deception
A new dimension has been born

Can you see those eyes of falling faith?
Can you sense the smell of non belief?
Will you realise when it's time to die?
Can you feel the need to stay awake?

Enter the field where silence sleeps
Where the demons on your way is all you see
Enter the flames of love and of hate
To receive the voices of dismay
Enter the gates of demarcation
The calling of desperate
Enter the centre of deception
A new dimension has been born
