Lost in the eyes filled with greed
Heart is bleeding
All help needing
Wind is blowing
The sun is burning
Their way is a lie
Wake up from your dream

As it tell upon a day
Beasts did leap and birds did sing
Everything did banish
Two loves I have
Of comfort and despair

My evil tempted my better angel from my side
And corrupt my saint to be a devil
Suspect I may yet not tell
