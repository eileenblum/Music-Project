Everyday ends and the time surrenders
Last dreams forgotten
Feelings got faded
Try to sail peaceful through the night

Who am I to decide
If you should live or die?
Growing inside of me
Breathing my air

Made out of love, taken by hate
Wonder where you are
Flying among the angels

Who am I to decide
If you should live or die?
Growing inside of me
Breathing my air
Who am I to decide
If you should live or die?
My angel child
