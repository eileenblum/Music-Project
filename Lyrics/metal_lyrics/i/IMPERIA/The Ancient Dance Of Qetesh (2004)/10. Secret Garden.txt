There is a secret garden in the morning mist
Filled with red roses
Hope the sun will clear the shades
So the secret garden of love can show its beauty

Wind through the trees you sang
In a field of roses
They danced the night away

There is a secret garden in the morning mist
Filled with red roses
Hope the sun will clear the shades
So the secret garden of love can show its beauty

Wind through the trees you sang
In a field of roses
They danced the night away
