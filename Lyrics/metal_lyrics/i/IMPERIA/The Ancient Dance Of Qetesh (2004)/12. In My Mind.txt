In your mind where I live
In your thoughts where I breathe
In your fantasy world where I stay
In your mind I live

In your mind where I live
In your thoughts where I breathe
In your fantasy world where I stay
In your mind I live

Without you there is no night, because you are my star
Never again will I trust
My only love took the last of me
Stole my soul that were glowing
Faded those sparkled eyes
Where is happiness?
In my dreams I'm free

In your mind where I live
In your thoughts where I breathe
In your fantasy world where I stay
In your mind I live

In your thoughts I stay
In your mind, I live, I stay
In your thoughts, I stay, I stay
