Take me to paradise, let me be free
Lead me through fire
Sailing on the open sea

In the rising sun a promise had been done to be kept
With the wings of an angel they flew to be the shadow for the sun

So the world would be in total darkness
No one could then see the soul
On their way to heaven

Waves coming in with the tide
Clear water flushes over the shoreline
We still ignore the screams of the tide
Of the tide

So the world would be in total darkness
No one could then see the soul
On their way to heaven
On their way to heaven
