So cold, so cold
So lonely inside of me
But a fire is burning to set me free
Where is the shelter that will warm my soul
Who can save me before I am lost?
Who can save me before I am lost?

Mysted by desire, we chase the wind
A pearl in the oyster of the night
Our soul rides the wave of light
And shines, glittering in the pale of night

So cold, so cold, so lonely
So cold, so cold, so lonely

Escaped into myself
Cause I got afraid to open my heart
To cry my tears
To cry my tears
