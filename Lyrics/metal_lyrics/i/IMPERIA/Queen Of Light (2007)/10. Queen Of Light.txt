Another life into another world
All innnocent in child's eyes
As pure as water from the riversides
Is the love for an unborn angel

And she's the Queen of Light, with her might
The Queen of Light

Dancing with flames in the dark
A red sky, heaven is bleeding
Taken a life, given an angel
The Queen of Light

And she's the Queen of Light, with her might
The Queen of Light

My child I will not let you down
Know that you are safe with me
No tears of sadness my dearest, only of joy
I will protect you with my life
Till I'm surrounded by darkness
Until then, I'll be watching you

My unborn angel, Queen of Light
My unborn angel, Queen of Light

Hei lille venn
GrÃ¥t ikke jeg skal trÃ¸ste deg for alltid.
FOR ALLTID
