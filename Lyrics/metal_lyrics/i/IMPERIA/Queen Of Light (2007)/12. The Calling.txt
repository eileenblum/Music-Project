It drives me to madness

Stop screaming and shouting to me, to me
I go mad, I go mad
Don't call me names anymore
I'll never forget them
Don't be cold, don't be cold anymore
Cause I can't take it...

The calling that fills me
Have to find my way
The calling that tells me
Go away go away

It drives me to madness

I am Cinderella locked up by Evil
The good birds got scared away
By black ravens
Kra kra kra
Let me out, let me out
Only for my illusion...

The calling that fills me
Have to find my way
The calling that tells me
Go away go away

It drives me to madness

For a kiss from life it was an illusion
I'm stupid, I'm ugly
I can't do nothing, nothing
That's what you tell me for so long it's all I know

The calling that fills me
Have to find my way
The calling that tells me
Go away go away...
