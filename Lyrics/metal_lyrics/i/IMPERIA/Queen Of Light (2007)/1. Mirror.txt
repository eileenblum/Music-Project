Mirror, mirror, where is the beauty in the world?
Mirror, mirror, do I see me or just a shade?
Mirror, mirror, will you please answer me?
Mirror, mirror, where is the beauty in the world?

The birds in the open sky
So free out there
Outside the window

My prince on a black horse, coming to save me
A daydream so real

Mirror, mirror, another painting than yesterday
Mirror, mirror, why did the colours fade away?

The birds in the open sky
So free out there
Outside the window

My prince on a black horse, coming to save me
A daydream so real

I'm scared to look in the mirror
Cause my eyes are dead on a pale face
That can't be me!!
Please don't let that be what have become of me

Mirror, mirror, walls coming close and closer
Mirror, mirror, cannot breathe, cannot see
Mirror, mirror, cannot breathe, cannot see

My prince on a black horse, coming to save me
A daydream so real
In the silence my heart beat fills the room
Makes the sadness speak..!

Mirror, mirror
