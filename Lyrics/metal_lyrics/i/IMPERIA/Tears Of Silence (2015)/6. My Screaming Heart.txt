Magic, it must be magic
Speak to me, I beg you
Magic, it must be magic

Your voice, like music to my ears
And I still love you
(I still love you)
And I still love you

There was a time I was closed
But that's not anymore
My heart is wide open
And I can scream it out loud

The desire between us
It's there so clear
The tension, is not going away
When our voices meet

And I still love you
(I still love you)
And I still love you

There was a time I was closed
But that's not anymore
My heart is wide open
And I can scream it out loud

I feel like making love to you
Endless and feel good
Put your hands around my throat

(I feel, like
I feel, like)

There was a time I was closed
But that's not anymore
My heart is wide open
And I can scream it out loud

There was a time I was closed
But that's not anymore
My heart is wide open
And I can scream it out loud
