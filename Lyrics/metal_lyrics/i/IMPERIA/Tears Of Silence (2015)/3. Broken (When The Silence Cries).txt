There is beauty
Even in the heart of the beast
Behind the facade
And behind the mask

There is the real heart
And the friendly face
(A friendly face)
Behind the facade
And behind the mask

Save me, I'm falling
Catch Me, I'm falling
Hold me, I'm falling
My soul is dying

Broken, I'm broken
And when the silence cries
Looking through the window
And every night the stars
Light up the darkest sky tonight
I know you see the same

The thorns of a rose
Made the blood drops
From my heart bleed
When, tell me, when
When will it heal

Save me, I'm falling
Catch Me, I'm falling
Hold me, I'm falling
My soul is dying

Broken, I'm broken
And when the silence cries
Looking through the window
And every night the stars
Light up the darkest sky tonight
I know you see the same

Save me, catch me, I'm falling
Hold me, my soul is dying

Broken, I'm broken
And when the silence cries
Looking through the window
And every night the stars
Light up the darkest sky tonight
I know you see the same

I'm broken
And when the silence cries
Looking through the window
And every night the stars
Light up the darkest sky tonight
I know you see the same, you see the same

And when the silence cries
You see the same

And every night the stars
Light up the darkest sky tonight
I know you see the same
