The days are not of any value anymore,
Without you all I can think about
Is the beauty in your heart
And the flower you gave out of love
I imagine your eyes and feel your breath
While I embrace you

But all I'm trying to bloom is fading away
Because your hand is not in mine

But all I'm trying to bloom is fading away
Because your hand is not in mine

Someday we don't have to run
Into nothingness their laughter has gone
Footprints in the sand will mark our ways
And wings of hope shall be our embrace

Try to carry on without you by my side
But it's all in vain
You are everything to me
But their lies took it all away
And then my heart started bleeding

But all I'm trying to bloom is fading away
Because your hand is not in mine

Someday we don't have to run
Into nothingness their laughter has gone
Footprints in the sand will mark our ways
And wings of hope shall be our embrace

(And the flower you gave out of love
I imagine your eyes and feel your breath)

My soul has withered from all emptiness
Without you, your smile drowns
All the sorrow that fills me
Your voice has been silenced

Someday we don't have to run
Into nothingness their laughter has gone
Footprints in the sand will mark our ways
And wings of hope shall be our embrace

Someday we don't have to run
Into nothingness their laughter has gone
Footprints in the sand will mark our ways
And wings of hope shall be our embrace
