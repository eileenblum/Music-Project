(Angel
Se pa filmen min ihvertfall, alle sammen er
Snille di som ser pa, og jeg er den snilleste
Jenta som finnes...)

Her voice has been silenced
She is out of sight
Imprisoned in the crime
On a desert place
And her freedom got lost
Hands reaching out
And both of us, you and I
Have a new hope instead

Why?, Tell me why?, life is so unfair
To an innocent child
With a bleeding heart
And tears are flowing

(If I had wings, I would have flown to you
If I had wings I would, had flown to you)

The tears keep running
On a innocent child's face
Why force to smile
So the damages would seem less

Why?, Tell me why?, life is so unfair
To an innocent child
Defenceless with a bleeding heart

(Angel
Nar ballongene, nar ballongene gar, sett deg
Oppi koya og la ballongene ga til vesj
vesj, vesj)
