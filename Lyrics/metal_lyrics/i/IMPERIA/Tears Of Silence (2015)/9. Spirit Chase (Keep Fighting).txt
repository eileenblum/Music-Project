How could they do this to you
They break you down
The abuse have gone too far
The violent crimes happened
Alredy to often and has gone too far

Keep fighting for your rights
I keep fighting for your freedom
Keep fighting for your rights
The battle is not over
Before you are free

Keep fighting, keep fighting
Against your tears
Keep fighting, Keep fighting
Until you are free

These humans rights have been broken
For already many many years

Keep fighting for your rights
I keep fighting for your freedom
Keep fighting for your rights
The battle is not over
Before you are free

Keep fighting, keep fighting
Against your tears
Keep fighting, keep fighting
Until you are free

(I feel you every night
I feel you are scared
And I feel your pain
I'm crying with you every of your tears
I feel your tears)

Keep fighting for your rights
I keep fighting for your freedom
Keep fighting for your rights
The battle is not over
Before you are free

Keep fighting, keep fighting
Against your tears
Keep fighting, keep fighting
Until you are free

Keep fighting, keep fighting
Against your tears
Keep fighting, keep fighting
Until you are free
