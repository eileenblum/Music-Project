Silence my friend
Closed mouth, open eyes
Can you read them?
Silence my friend

The only one who was there (who was there)

When my tears
Were falling down like rain
The silence were my only friend

(Silence)

I don't believe in god
Cause he never told me
What is wrong or right
Wrong or right

The only one who was there (who was there)

When my tears
Were falling down like rain
The silence were my only friend

When my tears
Were falling down like rain

When my tears
Were falling down like rain

(And I'll give my heart)

When my tears
Were falling down like rain
The silence were my only friend

When my tears
Were falling down like rain
When my tears
Were falling down like rain

Silence is my friend
Silence is my friend
Silence
