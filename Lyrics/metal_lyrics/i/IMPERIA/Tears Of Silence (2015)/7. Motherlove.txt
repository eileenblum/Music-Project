They can't take it away
No no no, the mother love is too strong
They can't take it away
It's coming closer
Closer and closer day by day
Freezing down my spine
As the truth fills my body and soul

They can't take it away
The mother love is too strong
They can't take it away
The mother love is too strong

The justice will win
The truth will be revealed
The justice will win
The truth will be revealed

The things we did
Will not be forgotten, no no no
Who you are will not be hidden
Your name is written in the stars

The justice will win
The truth will be revealed
The justice will win
The truth will be revealed

The justice will win
The truth will be revealed
The justice will win
The truth will be revealed

The dark shadows under the sun
Will shine through very soon
And then we will united again
The clouds will than not shade
And you will be safe in my arms
Forever, forever

The justice will win
The truth will be revealed
The justice will win
The truth will be revealed

The justice will win
The truth will be revealed
The justice will win
The truth will be revealed
