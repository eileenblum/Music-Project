Look at the world
How it is changing, how it is changing

Against the world, that is changing
It feels so strange all alone
And you on your own

Like the rivers
And lighted beauty
Like a flower on the moon

Now it's all away
You are away but feel so near
Wish you could feel what I feel

You brought the light into the darkest nights
My everyday sunlight beam
I keep close to my heart
We have to believe of what is left in our souls

Like the rivers
And lighted beauty
Like a flower on the moon

Now it's all away
You are away but feel so near
Wish you could feel what I feel
I will never give up on our dream
Still have piece of your drawings
And written wishes and poems
Gentle kiss on your cheek

Away, away, you are away

In my thoughts
You are always with me
I touch your hair but you are away

I look around
I end this song with this words
Love is to mighty for any words

You are away
You are away
You are away
You are away
You are away

Now it's all away
You are away but feel so near
Wish you could feel what I feel

Now it's all away
You are so away but feel so near
Wish you could feel what I feel
