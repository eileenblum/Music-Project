Breathing into the coldness
Of this void
Where only silence
Reflects my memory sight

Closed eye, nothing to feel
On this meadows of pain
Where the beauty of a rose
Blooms in vain

Crossroads
I lay my virtues to dust
Crossroads
A cold fire of mistrust

Starring inside the madness
On this way
Where only bitterness
Leads my mind astray

Shivering hands
Nothing to hold on this fields of sorrow
Where the smile
Of a moment senses no tomorrow

Crossroads
I lay my virtues to dust
Crossroads
A cold fire of mistrust

Drowning
Into the stillness
Of this time
Where only sadness
Fills my grail

Drowning
Into the stillness
Of this time
Where only sadness
Fills my grail

Crossroads
I lay my virtues to dust
Crossroads
A cold fire of mistrust

(Drowning
Into the stillness
Where only sadness
Fills my grail)

Drown
Into the stillness
Of this time
Where only sadness
Fills my grail

Drowning
Into the stillness
Of this time
Where only sadness
Fills my grail

(Fills my grail)
