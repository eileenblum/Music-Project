On the battlefield
They fought for their land
And the swords of the vikings
Were shining true the night

The fire is burning
And they celebrate their victory
And they all where singing

(Their viking song)

This is the viking song
Echoes within the mountain tops
Rowing over the lake
Towards the enemy's side

(Their viking song)

The fire is burning
And they celebrate their victory
And they all where singing

(Their viking song)

This is the viking song
Echoes within the mountain tops
Rowing over the lake
Towards the enemy's side
Horses on the field
And they're running faster
As the stormy wind
In full gallop and shining swords

(Viking songs, viking songs, viking songs)

To conquer them all
To conquer them all

To conquer them all
To conquer them all

The fire is burning
And they celebrate their victory
And they all where singing

(Their viking song)

This is the viking song
Echoes within the mountain tops
Rowing over the lake
Towards the enemy's side
Horses on the field
And they're running faster
As the stormy wind
In full gallop and shining swords

(Their viking song)
