we're shattered, our particles scattered

stand and stare down here on the ground
looking at the skies above
to try to understand what we are here for
and to figure out the meaning of it all

like skew reflections our images in a mirro glass
distorted from the cracks of the past
the stars casting shadows, a darkened veil covering all
fading memories of our formes selves, they just won't last

in the distance we what matters, dissolve into nothing
and the nothing dispersed into nothing but black emptiness

into the darkness

we see what matters, dissolve into nothing
no control of mind over matter, shattered
we're made out of negative matter

travelling through the darkness
of our inner thoughts
searching for recognition points
what lies within our soul and hearts

our particles scattered
