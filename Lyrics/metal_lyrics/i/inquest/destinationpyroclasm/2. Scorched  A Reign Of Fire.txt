The reign of fire, Earth scorched to bits 
The sky bleeds napalm, 
Mass graves, melted into this oven of bliss 
A furnace of human garbage, as the Earth, your Earth, your Earth turns blackâ¦ 
The Earth turns black 

Digging into the graves, survival of the sick 
The Earth turns black 

Enraged and encaged by this bio mechanical foe 
The initial conflict seems so trivial, now 
Out of hope, out of hand, population depletes 
Enraged by numberous diseases 
Is nuclear light the sun they see... 

The extinction, the plague, of humanity... 
The extinction, the plague, of humanity... 
The extinction, the plague, is humanity 

Another raid, again the Earth trembles, 
The reign of fire has no end 
Finding shelter beneath this crust of decay, 
Forsaken by all hope 
Infesting swarm of frail human beings, 
Alternated, by their grief 
Where is your God now, 
As the sky, bleedsâ¦. 

Reign of fire...
