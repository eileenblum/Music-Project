Out of the silence, rose a new kind of madness
Of which no one, no one could locate the source
A smothered moan as a chanted hymn
Unearthly, terrible and hard to bear

Crushed, tramped, pulverized
Killed, raped, crucified
Out-numbered, out-gunned 
Genocide has begun

A world left lifeless, souls tramped and crushed
Everything ends, conquered and burnt
Crushed by the panzers, life unfolds
Incinerated masses, destruction unboundâ¦

Mass destruction
Blood-soaked landscapes, where bodies remain
Silence prevails, as the napalm stroke the day before, swift

Conquered by -
The Stahlmacht, an automized tool of, extinction
Programmed for one end result, extermination
Created by the race of men, mass inflicted suicide
Thoughts of man have depraved their own being
There is no future...

Self-inflicted, your social disorder, the eradication

Incinerated masses, destruction unboundâ¦

The end of man...
