A cursed hand, waves across, a guilty face, unwritten command 
Malignant, it signs, an ancient tongue, calling forth, and awakens the mind 

Filling his lungs with the wrath of the sun 
Destroying their will as a vessel of death 
Feasting on ash as their world is undone 
A purge to cleanse with every searing breath 

Living 
Breathing 
Thinking 
Weapon 

Igniting his surroundings 
Consuming the embers of enemies 
Fueled by the fallen, driven to incinerate 
Conscious thought demands only to annihilate 

Living volcano 
Hateful inferno 

Igniting his surroundings 
Consuming the embers of enemies 
Fueled by the fallen, driven to incinerate 
Conscious thought demands only to annihilate 

Behind the blaze, spiteful eyes, unfaltering, molten demise 
Deep inside, a nuclear heart, beats like a bomb, tearing apart 

Incarnation of hell 
Watched as everything fell 
Summoned to combust 
And left us all as dust 

Igniting, living to cleanse 
Devoured, his purpose ends 
Blinding light from a wrath he expelled 
In his wake a blaze that cannot be quelled
