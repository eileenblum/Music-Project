Keeping in time with degrading minds 
Forming a line and becoming benign 
Demonize ideals with outcries 
Criminalized opinions and lies 

We are decaying at an alarming rate 
Finding that language is something to abrogate 
We're approaching the point of no return 
There's no functioning conclusion to discern 

Staying true to rules self imposed 
Safety in silence with ethics disposed 
Stowing away morality undisclosed 
Lying and hiding for fear of the truth exposed 

Steep in a language so injurious 
I find myself furious 

Superficial outrage at communication 
Overreactions hide deadly motivation 
Kicking and screaming for parity 
Calling for punishment with no sincerity 

It'll be a sad day when we come to see 
That mankind is its own worst enemy
