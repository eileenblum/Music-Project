No peace... 

I am the darkness 
Slithering obsidian 
Adorned in knives 
Assassin of peace 

I live to purge 
I am Ultor 
Nothing will last 
I am Ultor 

Awakened in shadows 
I seek to decimate 
Deception, betrayal 
No one stands in my wake 

Learn to fear me as you've learned to fear the night 
Begin to regret your lives in the face of my might 
I take no pity on your wretched worthless lives 
Reflect on your disgusting history as nothing survives 

No... peace... 

There will be nothing again 
The error of your ways 
Brought to light inside 
The inferno by my hand 

I live to purge 
Nothing will last 
Prepare to die for 
I am Ultor
