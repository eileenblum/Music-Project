A wilting garden in the mind 
Starves itself to feel alive 

With ceasing so close, the line begins to blur 
Though we tread so near we still find ourselves unsure 
A cleanliness that transcends all words, all thoughts, all will 
Submerged in sacred aether and kindly immolated in the tranquil 

Under starlight 
Together we share 
Congruent lines 
Yet we're unaware 

Amid mortal 
Shackles it's by right 
That we pass 
Into the uncharted night 

Into stone we carve great praise of the peace of which we sing 
Unparalleled in the purity; the silence death can bring 

Trying to die again 
Dying to live again 

Drawing near to darkened frontiers 
We will not remain 
Still our paths stand unclear 
We will not remain 

Bestowed to us upon our extinction 
A stillness uttered in the tongue of oblivion 

Trying to die again 
Dying to live again 

With ceasing so close, the line begins to blur 
Though we tread so near we still find ourselves unsure 
A cleanliness that transcends all words, all thoughts, all will 
Submerged in sacred aether and kindly immolated in the tranquil 

Drawing near to darkened frontiers 
We will not remain 
Still our paths stand unclear 
We will not remain
