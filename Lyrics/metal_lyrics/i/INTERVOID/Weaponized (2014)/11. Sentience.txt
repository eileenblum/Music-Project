There was a day when man gazed skyward 
He peered to the skies which ignited his spirit 
Fragments of light pierced the night and inspired 
Him to overcome the dark, to no longer fear it 

So sets the crusade 
So begins his quest 
Becoming more than man 
Evolving to gods 

Approaching the stars, we would learn to unite 
Whether we're alone or drowning in life 

Crawling from the sea, 
Clawing to the desolation 
Imagine what we would be 
If faced with no limitation 

An intuition tells us that something is there 
A simple equation says that there's life everywhere 

We have harnessed the atom and the heart 
We have died to become strong and smart 
Entrenched in darkness our entire lives 
Conquering all so our kind may thrive 

Approaching the stars, we would learn to unite 
Whether we're alone or drowning in life 

Our intuition tells us that something is there 
A simple equation says that there's life everywhere 

Our path has led us through pain and grief 
Our trials by fire have hardened our belief 
No matter what we might find, we venture beyond 
Maybe someday, a voice will respond you are not alone 

Billions and billions 
Eons ahead and eons ago 
Bathing in the cosmic brilliance 
Waiting for us to know 

Crawling from the sea, 
Clawing to the desolation 
Imagine what we would be 
If faced with no limitation 

Emerging from the source 
Pondering our origins 
Metamorphosis into a force 
A tale of conquest begins 

Given enough time, 
Hydrogen begins to wonder 
Where it came from 
And where it is going 

Emerging from the source 
Pondering our origins 
Metamorphosis into a force 
A tale of conquest begins
