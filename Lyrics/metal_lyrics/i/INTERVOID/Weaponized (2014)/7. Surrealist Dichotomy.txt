I have found a way 
To surge through the threshold 
I am the curse 
A wanderer uncontrolled 

Born of inexplicable periphery 
The natural order of mutation 
Unspeaking voice of flesh and misery 
The epitome of pervasion 

My passage between 
Such veracities 
Such infinities 
Wears upon me 

I find my self (falling) 
I see my self (dying) 
I know my self (fading) 
I dread my self (conscious) 

My passage between 
Such veracities 
Such infinities 
Wears upon me 

I find my self (falling) 
I see my self (dying) 
I know my self (fading) 
I dread my self (conscious) 

Towering giant of pulsing teeth and claws 
Gnashing and shrieking at the skyline 
Anomalous, insipid organic ascendant's jaws 
Demigod of carnage and blight, venomous paradigm 

Voyager of nightmares 
I've witnessed such atrocity 

Born of inexplicable periphery 
The natural order of mutation 
Unspeaking voice of flesh and misery 
The epitome of pervasion 

Virulent universe 
Swarming gasoline 
Misplaced limbs adorn cursed 
Cathedrals of a skeletal machine 

Every instance of space 
Inundated with warnings 
Speaking to my very core 
By living I am trespassing 

Smoldering halos 
Adorning masses of bone 
Churning ashen sky 
This is fucking hell 

I find my self (falling) 
I see my self (dying) 
I know my self (fading) 
I dread my self (conscious) 

Granted sustenance from the suffering 
Drawn lifeforce from the firmament 
Swollen mound of organic matter pulses 
To the rhythm of strange damnation 

Strange damnation 
Strange damnation
