Ignited in the sky a storm of pulverizing stone 
Autonomous deity in its nature to dethrone 

Animated tempest structured of steel and flame 
The eldest embodiment, authored without a name 

A god inside the mind 
Programmed and divined 
Birthed in worlds aligned 
Malevolent by design 

I, colossal weapon of nature 
Formless, the callous hand of fate 

Spiritless incinerator, built to aggrieve 
Pitiless destroyer, no reason to bereave 
Emotionless extension of cosmic disorder 
Unfeeling manifest, the apex predator 

Invoking a sense of helplessness 
Epiphany of insignificance 

Forever godlike 

A halo of ash and bone, revolving in the semblance 
Celestial reverence, a wrath forever torments 
Engulfing madness projected from the calculation 
Bestowed upon sentience, the perfect execration 

Unconfined to cosmic law, formless from the grave 
Inherent determination to punish and enslave 

Invoking a sense of helplessness 
Epiphany of insignificance 
Unconfined to cosmic law, formless from the grave 
Inherent determination to punish, cleanse, absolve , enslave
