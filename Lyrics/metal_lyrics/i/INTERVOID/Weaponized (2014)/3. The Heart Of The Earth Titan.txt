Heaving earth, wretching soil 
King of natural turmoil 
Awakened, furious conviction 
Organic malediction 
Suspended mountains spite 
Downward a furious plight 
Enraged beyond the millenium's rest 
Reclaimation of planetary conquest 

Arise myth of stone 
Scar the earth and frighten 
Let your power be known 
The heart of the earth titan 

Creation of stone 
Smash the earth and smite them 
Let your power be known 
The heart of the earth titan 

Terrestrial archetype 
Protector 
Odious guardian 
Earth Titan 

Heart forged from the churning mantle 
Instinct is to scour the land 

Terrestrial archetype 
Protector 
Odious guardian 
Earth Titan 

Scraping sky, vehement eyes 
Seeing to our demise 
Abhorred, relentless destruction 
Wandering chaotic eruption 
Defender of nature's purity 
Goliath from obscurity 
Enraged beyond the millenium's rest 
Reclaimation of planetary conquest 

Arise myth of stone 
Scar the earth and frighten 
Let your power be known 
The heart of the earth titan 

Creation of stone 
Smash the earth and smite them 
Let your power be known 
The heart of the earth titan
