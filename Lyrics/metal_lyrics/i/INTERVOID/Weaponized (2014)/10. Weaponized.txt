Far below the shroud of consciousness, a spark ominously awakes 
Igniting all systems with a roar; the surface quakes 

The world he sees, the commands he hears, the power he bears, the sum Of our fears 

Resurface 
With weapons drawn 
Determined to 
Take aim upon 
Enemies 
Allies alike 
Succumb to it's 
Colossal might 

Deep below the light, machinery stirs 
Rising into the sky, spear-like, the automation begins 
Armaments set to destroy everything in sight 

Engines roar 
Signals for 
All weapons 
To engage 

Through the ash and rubble 
Everything will end 
We are purified 
Everything will end 
Built to retake control 
Everything will end 
By way of genocide 
Everything will end 

No sense of - compassion - or sympathy 
It's only purpose - is to destroy 

The world he sees, the commands he hears, the power he bears, the sum Of our fears 

Nothing escapes it's eyes 
Nothing escapes it's will 

Through the ash and rubble 
Everything will end 
We are purified 
Everything will end 
Built to retake control 
Everything will end 
Our nightmare has now 
Become weaponized 

Eclipsing the sun, the clouds now divide 
Readied to kill, sights now aligned 
With a flash of light and a deafening blast 
Combined as one, hear the end arrive 

Final moments realized as the machine fires
