Skull quaking, sensual immersion 
Imbalance in the brain, perpetual occlusion 
Neurotic assault, cortex reprogrammed 
Cognisant, hyper aware 

All waking thoughts spent shivering 
Self inflicted contusions, 

Spiralling 
Deafening 

Uncontrolled, godly force, smashed to dust, with no remorse 
Obliterated axons quiver charged at its source 

Psychopathic shifts in reality quell a thirst 
A signalling of cosmic perception, yet unaware 
Evaporation of emotions, a collection of sights 
Cerebral functions reduced to visceral awe of its might 

Sanity be damned 
Steep in the color 
Engulfed in the hallucination 
Succumb to the mental annihilation 

Searing cold, chilling hot 
Perspective of truth and fiction 
Reduced to a smear of color and rage 
Freefalling deeper into chemical rampage 

Trembling eyes, uncountable words 
Deliberate confusion and paranoia 
Impotent commands from scarce sobriety 
Return to the mire of inverted society 

Spiralling 
Deafening 
Approaching 
Infinity 

Unresolved, the withering has sighed 
Varying forms of psychosis coexist inside 

Malformed 
Maligned 
Destroyed 
My mind 

Re-injected, re-dissected entirety of thought reflected 
I'll surface now liberated with senses invigorated 

Entanglement of neural lines reconnect and redefine 
Surrealist abberation mortifies the retrospection
