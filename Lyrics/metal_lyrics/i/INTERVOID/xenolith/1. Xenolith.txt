Ageless, a monument to history 
Deathless solitary fragments 

Unscathed by time 
Enduring testament 

Landmark of history 
Forecasting destiny 

Calculating, repeating, indefinite perception 
Consistently observing, dispiriting conception 

Beacon alight 
Calling for us 
To learn the truth 
We're not alone 

Landmark of history 
Forecasting destiny 

Author, of our creation 
Architects, signaled extermination 

Epochs of silence have ended 
Terminal decision, extinction sentence 

Calculating, repeating, approaching self knowing 
Consistently observing, sinister power flowing 

Xenolith 

Beacon alight 
Calling for us 
To learn the truth 
We're not alone
