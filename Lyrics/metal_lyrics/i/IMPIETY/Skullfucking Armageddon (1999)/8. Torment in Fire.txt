Call of the witchingmoon
Black massacre, destructive hellforce
I voice out from thy grave
Ripping evil, sodom's tales
Tears from the mother of white
Ritual, we've slaughtered her
Screams from ancient blasphemy
Bringing you torment!

Violent force
Witching hell
Tyranny reigns as the warriors attack
Blessed by sin
Torment in fire!

Fire! Fire!
Desire! Desire!

Vengeance burns across the sky
Funerals... I consecrate
Demon's sacred blade
Unholy praises... sadistic nightmare

Watching souls dance in fire
Blessed evil reigns in fire!

Torment...in...fire
Torment.. in.. fire, desire!
