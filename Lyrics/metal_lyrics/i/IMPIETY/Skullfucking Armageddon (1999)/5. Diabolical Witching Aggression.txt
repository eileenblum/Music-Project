Blackened nights... filled with grim and sorrow
Signs of apocalypse, as seen in the eyes of death
Hatred!
Horrors consumed by pain
Christian slaughter!
Blasphemy, for I am one 
One with darkness...

Destroying the gods above
Impaling the christian kind
Sweet bloody revenge
For the reaper..

Aggression!

Blazing wrath of victory
Summons me
Into the fire...
Fucking hard the lambs of christ
No mercy...

Falling prey to the hammer of the masters

Twisted force from the evil of shadows
Imperial fate of their christian kingdoms
Lie in fuckin ruins!

Destroying the gods above
Impaling christian minds
Sweet bloody revenge for the reaper!

Aggression!
