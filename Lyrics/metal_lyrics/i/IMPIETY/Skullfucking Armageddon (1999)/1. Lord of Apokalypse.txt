Horns of genocide, holocaust and hate
From the claws of death we rise
Walk the path to the blessed lands
Enslaved in blackness...

The soulraped many that became the damned
Legions from the end of time
Fly through battleskies
Bathe horizons with blood!

Hellhordes so glorious
Uphold our banner proud
Storm with us through death, doom, destruction!
Hellhordes victorious
Rulers of the battlesky
For lords are we, beasts from the east
Pandemonium!

Lords....

Dawn has come, unveil the dying
Bleeding souls impaled on cold steel
Cursed to burn in blasphemy
Crushing the nazarene...
Enthroned high on hellthrones
War-commanders sound battlestrikes
Black deathdemons reign
Predatory force of apokalypse

Lords of apokalypse
Storm with us through death, doom, destruction!
Lords of apokalypse
For lords we are, beasts from the east
Pandemonium!

Demons on the rise
Eyes of vengeance burns so bright
On wings of death they ride
Crimson blades greets thy flesh...

Visions of darkness
Halls of unchaste dimensions
Sworn to battlement
Mayhemic march of horned warriors
Nocturnal hunger, holocaustic nights of sorrow
Floating deadlights
Nassacres grim under the funeralsky

Eternal praise, infernal masters
With bloodfilled cups held high
Mianthropic tyants crave for more
War, pain, hell, everlasting blasphemies

Enthroned high on hellthrones
War-commanders sound battlestrikes
Black deathdemons reign, Lords...
