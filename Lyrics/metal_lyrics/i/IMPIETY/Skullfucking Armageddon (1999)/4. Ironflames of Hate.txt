Born to battle for eternity
Infernal hate...
Call on darkness, kill the light
My hordes now rise

Infernal armageddon
Hellish realms plagued with sin
Vile enflamed lands
Hellish realms now our plains
Endless barbaric onslaughts
Tyrannous hordes, we crave for blood
Crush...

Ironflames!

Heathenic moonthrone of gold
Sits our lord so fuckin grim
Sanctified are our souls
By the blood from his sword
Immortality, fiercely blessed with
Ironflames of fuckin hate!

Victory, demons' dance, amongst funeralflames
Pagan hails, all in praise for the blade
Warlust, we crave the blood, fuel of our hate
Shield and sword in hand, all in praise for the blade

Mighty slayings - all in command
Ascend, my hordes shall rise
Supreme diamonic helltorment

Now it's time to ride
Cryptic battles endless
Sign that the moon craves for blood.. die!
Storming through darkness
Clad in venomous armour
Born to die are we, tonight... fight!
