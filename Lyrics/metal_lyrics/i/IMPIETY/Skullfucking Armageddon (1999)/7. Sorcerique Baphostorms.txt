Legions of hate divine
DeiMoonseth
Entralled by battle divine
I am Sin!

We ride to Witcheron
(Across) firey realms
Enchantment of our blackswords
Blind this night...

Embraced by the nocturmoon
Hordes of grim
We ride with pride!

Flames of Onyx-faith lead the way
The plains of Samieth bless darkness by day
Leperchants - called over time
Sorcerique arrival - desecration sublime!

Flames of Onyx-faith lead the way
The plains of Samieth bless darkness by day

On high hellflames they claim the nocturnal silence
Commanding battalions into war
Bleeding me...
Remembering the beasts that moulded fate!

Witcheronic hellcursed hymns
Night processions rage within
Hallowed winds of damnation
Imperia sublime!

Embraced by the nocturmoon
Hordes of grim
We ride with pride!
