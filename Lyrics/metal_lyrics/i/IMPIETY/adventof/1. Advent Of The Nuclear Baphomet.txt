[Music &amp; Lyrics: Shyaithan, Solos: Eskathon]

Appease the Master for the time has come
Coronation - black ritual
Ignited skies - dreaded pyres
Abundant deaths, extinguished lives
Majestic Beast of eternal terror
Lord of hordes, barbarian Emperor
Imminent arrival, reclaim the throne
Glorification of Master Lucifer
Ascend He shall, boldly once again
Almighty gas - masked Beast, all fear His name!

Abominations, spells of terror
Profane wisdom, fiery temper
Merciless and vulgar
Demons' chant in Devil's shrines
Upon arrival He takes the throne
Upon arrival He reaps more souls
Demonic celebration
Exalted Master Lucifer!!

Hooven claws of wrath and fury
Horns that enshadow all below
Grand entrance from smouldering fumes of vengeance
Blood ceremonial oath

Advent of the nuclear Baphomet!!
