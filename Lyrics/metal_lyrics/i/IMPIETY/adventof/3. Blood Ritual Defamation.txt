[Music &amp; Lyrics: Shyaithan, Solos: Eskathon]

Open wide the gates in praise of evil
Open wide the gates; conjuration
Altars of death, hunger for flesh
Altars of blood ritual defamation!

Congregate in halls of sacrificial demise
Black mass - we invoke the ancient Ones
Present them prey, bastard flock of the night
Sabbatic rites, Satan's hunger, the time is now
Hour of defamation

Raped and ravaged, fornication of the dead
Piss their faces first then violently crush their souls
Blood orgy with guts, limbs and flesh
Savage order of mockery, the time is now
Ceremonial defamation

Shrines of skull, gleam in blood; consecrated necrophilia
Antichristian blasphemy, swines dead and disgraced

Defamation
Blood Ritual Defamation...
