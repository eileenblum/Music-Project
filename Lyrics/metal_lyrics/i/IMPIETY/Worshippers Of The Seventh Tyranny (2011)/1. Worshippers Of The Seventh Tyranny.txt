Deprivation, desolation, doom and demise,
revelation of irreverence, command to destroy
wings of pandemonium, deliver titan maelstrom
eruption wrath of troops totalitarian chaos tribes
eruption wrath of troops from mouth of Beelzebub
eruption wrath of troops by command of Ammon

Riders with armaments, bring weapons: guns and bombs
anthem of devastation, cults of exterminate,
anthem of devastation, lord Antichrist has arrived,
anthem of devastation, lethal bolt to annihilate mankind,
atomic breath execrated, toxic flames - heaven ablaze
Worshippers of the Seventh Tyranny

[Guitar solo]

Desecration, decimation, devilry arise,
sentinels of terror, fierce in massacre,
deliverance of plague and sorrow, reapers swing their scythe
spread dread to the masses, slaying Shepard of flock,
spread dread to the masses, impalement on goat horns,
spread dread to the masses, altar of the worm awaits

Arrival of war demons, descend in chariots
Azarath maiestas aeterna est
Luciferi maiestas aeterna est
Iblis maiestas aeterna est
praise obliteration, invert dead and broken gods
Worshippers of the Seventh Tyranny

[Guitar Solo]

The lord has arrived,
lethal bolt annihilate mankind,
atomic breath execrated,
chaos enthroned, altar of worm awaits...

[Guitar Solo]

As I stand Defiant in Desolation...
loathe, abhor and curse
civilization deconstructed
immersed in plague and virus
sacred sight of disaster...

Radiation clouds
horizons draped in dust
dripping flesh from bone
nuclear holocaust

Chemicals and fumes
flood this forsaken Earth
eradicating creation
foulest stench of death

The lord has arrived,
lethal bolt annihilate mankind,
atomic breath execrated,
revelation if irreverence,
command to destroy......

Deterioration
worms bore through pious flesh

[Guitar Solos]

Art of decomposition
divine gods lie in waste

Days of darkness and gloom
mournful isolation

Carved by retardation and doom
rays of incineration

Seraphic Abolition
heavenly father termination

Into maze of failure
matrix of grief

Calamity and Devastation, sounds of chaos,
defending mourn, hollow crosses, perishing light,
stabbed by vengeance, decorated horror

Deprivation, desolation, doom and demise,
Revelation of irreverence, command to destroy
wings of pandemonium, deliver titan maelstrom

[Guitar Solo]

Eruption wrath of troops from mouth of Beelzebub
