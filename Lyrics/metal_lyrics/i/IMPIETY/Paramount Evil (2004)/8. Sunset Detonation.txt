Heavens weeping, illuminationThe Sun fades west, grave departureSanguine clouds over horizon,Tranquility deceives this eveningWith stealth and precision they roll,Targets in range, hearts so coldStrapped with explosives, with one cause...(To unleash their tremendous wrath in a blast!) For revenge it seems so endless,Nourishing their hate, to die for God,Foolish suicidal muslims,Detonating themselves for nothing...An eye for eye, is what will cause,Only much more devastation,Blasphemous Terror so glorious,(Deliver fierce, more unholy destruction and demise!) Launch another...Heinous attack...Annihilate masses!Proudly detonating - yourself! Launch Another...Ferocious Onslaught...Slaughter the sheep!In the Sign of - Paramount Evil!
