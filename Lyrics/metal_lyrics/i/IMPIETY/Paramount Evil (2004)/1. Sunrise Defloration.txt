The Bestial Hatred of the Rising Sun,Is cast upon this Dawn,Of Infernal '37,Samurais Proudly Triumph,The Land of Nanjing fell,Into the beastly claws of Imperialists. Swords of the samurai rise high,Beheading the Mortal precise,Babies thrown up to the sky,Rusty bayonets, silencing their cries Raping their daughters, raping their sons,Fathers and mothers were forced to,or face a merciless execution.But all of them shall only die,Because their lives are meaningless,Worthless in every Sense! Deflorate,Violent orgasmic pleasures...Annihilate,Corpses pile up in masses... Decimate! 300.000Violated and butcheredIn just 6 weeks,of Brutal Invasion...A Land soaked in blood,Destined for no hope,over an orgy or rape and murder! And so it seem their fucking gods of stone,Can do absolutely nothing... Violate! Hellish be the Rays of the Rising Sun,Perishing lives, incinerating souls... Coldly satiating their lust and hatred,dedicated to the art of Annihilation... And the defloration...Sunrise defloration...
