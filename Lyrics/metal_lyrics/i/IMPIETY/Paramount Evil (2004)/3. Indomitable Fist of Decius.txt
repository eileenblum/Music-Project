Ascend the throne o' mighty master,Preserve the oath of ancient souls,The gods have spoken so reign in terror,Eradicate those who scorn your throne...Lies of Christ will never serve, the bleeding cross they so deserve,The time has come to overturn, demolish and crush those Religious... Known to all,christianity, is set to bring about your fall,Aimed at, demolishing,The sacred elders of your ancient cult.Let there be honor,Let there be absolute control,Over your empire, in your name,as their savage deaths unfold Thrown to the lions to be feasted upon,Eradicate the flock who preachThe cross, we spit upon... Sacrifices in Pagan temples,Oblations made to please the gods,Forcing christians to purge their faith, descend into apostasy,Lies of christ will never serve, the bleeding cross they so deserve,The time has come to overturn, demolish and crush those religious... They shall obey or face your wrath,Just cast them to the arena,Crucify and behead them,Burn all at the stake...Flagellate and mutilate,Send thousands to their grave,And so you shall forever remainThe Indomitable Fist! Be hailed almighty Trajan Decius,For the triumphant annihilation,Destruction, demise and desecration,For the benefit of this earth... Be hailed almighty Trajan Decius,For the bloodiest decimations,Contempt, hate and Abomination,For the benefit of this world
