I invoke the Master, Overlord of Vengeance, Arise!
Into another sacrilegious maelstorm, We ride,
Deafeaning roars of deception
Contemptous might of aggression
Lightning forces, triumphant annihilation...

DEATH!

Formidable sigil of chaos
Rapid obliteration, acceleration of world demise

Doom arrives from all side, Regiments devastate,
Sounds of armour piercing armour, War ritual
Precise executin of combat, Divine legacy

I summon the General of Undead Legions, Arise!
Into another Blasphemous battle, We Fight,
Dreadful display of revulsion
Barbarous rule of oppression,
Superior forces, strategic annihilaton...

Bringers of Wrath, Serve to abominate,
Descending torment, they reap and shred,
Saddled horseback, hoofs drenched in blood,
Jagged blades they assail with speed
With lightning speed! Rape and Shred!
