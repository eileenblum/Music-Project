[originally by Sorcery]Fight the sorceress on the mountain of hades.
Execute her and go through eternal flames.
Enter the fire-licked fields where flowers have faded
Pass the sixth gate when one still remains.
Go on, with the sacred sign of the blessed child.
You march against the Lucifer legions of the wild.

Your body will die your soul will survive.
In the search of the tomb for the sword of the blessed - light.
Nowhere to be found hear the march of the dead
Unnamed and alone in the crypts of hell.
Hear yourself scream you know him, the master of pain.
You're caught by Lucifer legions of the wild.

The dead will rise.
To make us join them.
The Lucifer legions of the wild.

No one is there who could ease your pain.
When you hang in your nails over eternal flames
The legion will teach you to do the right.
To not start riots against the master of might.
Satan our father gives you to the legions
You're dead, killed by Lucifer legions of the wild.

The dead will rise.
To make us join them.
The Lucifer legions of the wild.

Fight the sorceress on the mountain of hades.
Execute her and go through eternal flames.
Enter the fire-licked fields where flowers have faded
Go on with the sacred sign of the blessed child.
You march against the Lucifer legions of the wild.

Go on with the sacred sign of the blessed child.
You march against the Lucifer legions of the wild.

The dead will rise.
To make us join them.
