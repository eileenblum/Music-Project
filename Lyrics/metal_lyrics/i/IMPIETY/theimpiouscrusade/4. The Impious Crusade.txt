Befoul the sacred land,
Into grand upheaval,
Irreverent cavalry, 
Brutalizing raid

Striking swarm of terror and bigotry

Revenge rising, God's Kingdom must end,
Infernal redemption embrace our foes

Break them!

Burn alltheir holy scriptures,
Troops shatter ugly idols,
Impale high preaching dogs,
Curse, demolish temples, Carnage,
Open wide, Tarnished gates, God's promised land,
Ablazed in flames!

Heretical Death,
Aggressive siege

Maim &amp; decapitate messiahs,
Implode all their holy scriptures,
Reduce their lavish altars, to rubble,
Dogmas, all mocked and erased,
I consecrate thier crusade,
In the name of Satan,
Conqueror, Father, Master...

Sacrificial rites,
Power &amp; might,

The Impious Crusade...
Extinguish adversaries from existence,
The Impious Crusade...
A celebration of heinous exterminations

FUCK THEM!

Irreligious persecution, in full control,
Violent retribution,
Swords carcve, axes hack and disfigure,
Behold the devastator

Demonic soldiers in full controlm
Malevolent devastation
Swords carcve, axes hack and disfigure,
I uncreate your Creator...
