We storm through whirlwinds of hate
Vengeance arise
Gladiators of nuklear warfare
Volcanic wrath
Exterminating mankind at will
Chaste blood flows
Sadistic, ferocious and grim
We shred all souls

Beasts so infernal
Beasts we're so proud to be
Beasts of eternal (battle)
Beasts of Impiety!

Nefariously in reign
Turning all we touch to dust
Blasphemous assault on god's flock
Barbarously in reign
Kommanding nocturnal warlust
Blessed be our enemies
All but die!
Exterminating mankind at will
Chaste blood flows
Sadistic, ferocious and grim
We'll fuck your soul

Raise, your bloodfilled cups to an eternal of imperial abyssic hate
Fight, our legions envenom, krush and exterminate tormented souls
Black visions and cruelty, satanic terror we bring now destroying this forsaken world
Battlebeasts
Battlebeasts
Empowered by the forces of blasphemy
We cease to step down from our thrones
Purging endless victories
Sadistik lords of battle rise!
