Saviour unmighty Saviour
Embodiment of fallen grace
Bastard birth of your existence
Deceit, dishonor, lies proclaimed
Doctrines of pure deception
Prophecies of shallow hope
Shackled tight to false salvation
Redemption in blood &amp; flames

Chosen I am,fist of extermination
Ordered to demolish &amp; erase
Mocking, whilst dismantling all existence
Flock of God - I (shall) eradicate
Scriptures warned impending carnage
Imminent arrival of armageddon
Face no trial - only tribulation
Unholy forces shall devastate

Revelation Decimation
Prime command to annihilate
Revelation Decimation
With scornful wrath, I decimate

Revelation Decimation
Prime command to annihilate
Revelation Decimation
With scornful wrath, I decimate

Under sign of violence, embrace deliverance of chaos
Executing the pious &amp; devout
Proclamation of death, all horrors unbound
I worship nothing else but war, pain &amp; genocide

Under sign of blasphemy, thus I seal your fate
Perilous warnings came to you before
World of God inverted, engulfed in flames
Reigning pandemonium, vengeance unmerciful

Decendeth now this infernal punishment upon you
For it was preordained that terror is absolute....

Apocalyptic armageddon
For it was preordained - into storm of annihilation
And nothing shall stop &amp; stand in its way
