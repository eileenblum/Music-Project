Finalise the breath, of the useless, retarded &amp; weak - millions that surround
Open fire mass execution, delete &amp; erase them, once for all
Weapons unforgiving, devastating capabilities, sizes &amp; shapes
Relentless they rip, shred &amp; tear, disintegrate the frail sacred shell, of humankind

Weaponized
Obsessed by exterminations
Demonized, possessed to kill am I
Weaponized
Oath of sadistic warfare
Agonized, all stand for God shall die

Armaments of devastation, flamethrowers, howitzers, machetes &amp; shotguns
From crossbows, swords to bazookas, I let them all take control - and direct command
Easy it is, to be in power, gods contend me not for I will not fail
Take your aim to maim thus enabling, the bloody genocide - to ensue with ease

Face to face, I'm ready, locked &amp; loaded
Behind the barrel, I lay all to waste
Scores of corpses, fragmented in disgrace
Quest for blood, I hunger for death
Truly a beast - I fire without mercy
Triggering kills igniting misery
Smell of sulphur &amp; depravation
Allow my weapon I shall to terminate your fate

Face to face, I'm ready with sharpened blades
Clenched tight handle, I slay all to waste
Beheading masses, hacking limb after limb
Quest for blood, I hunger for death
Truly a beast - I live to see them bleed
Slaying kills igniting misery
Smell of blood &amp; rotting body parts
Allow my weapon I shall, to seal your fate
