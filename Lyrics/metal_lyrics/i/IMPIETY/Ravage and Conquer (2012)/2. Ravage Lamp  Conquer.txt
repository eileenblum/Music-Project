Arise - Demonic legions, Flagellators
Horned sentinels, Goat gladiators...
Purge strength &amp; power, Domination
Loyal tyrants, Will to conquer

Intolerance with vengeful vision
Allegiance sworn, subjugation
Contemptuous motive, Raid &amp; pillage
Profane transgressions
Siege of irreverence

Suffer grave consequences, vanquish all hopes

Awaken - Troops of the Unlight, Persecutors
Barbarian Hordes, Fierce ravagers
Purge disease &amp; demise, Despotism
Regal armies, Iron will to devour
Insolence, With horrendous action
Putrefaction, Foul stench of carrion
Rabid Deathstrike, Plague &amp; suffering
Deceptive strategy
Siege of IMPIETY

Lightning fast, descending death
Razor talons penetrate
Bombarding without mercy
Victorious raid overthrow

It's the dawn of the conquering
Crush &amp; ravage, trample all by force
Authorize the hammering
Smouldering rubble, of flesh &amp; ash

It's the dawn of Conquering
Despoil all aggressors humiliate
Sanctify the bludgeoning
Plunder all, seize the throne

Ravage &amp; Conquer
Raid &amp; Trample
Ravage &amp; Conquer
Usurp &amp; Reign

Suffer grave consequences, vanquish all hopes
Onwards with the conquering, callous ravaging prevails
