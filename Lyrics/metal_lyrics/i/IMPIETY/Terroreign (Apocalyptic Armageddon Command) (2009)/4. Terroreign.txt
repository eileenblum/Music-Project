As I raise the Master
Emperor of empires in black
Command of barbaric attacks
Casting pestilence and death
Intolerant devastation prevails
Regiments of superior force
Proud to destroy and obey
Abominate and Annihilate
Under golden regal banners of Hell

Knights sworn to stab and shred
10.000 blasphemic crusaders
Slain sheep bloodied in defeat
Decorated altars of hate
Proud to wage Armageddon
Proud to govern infernos
Rein in disgust eternal
Celebrating Azazel's Domination

Praise victory, to the sounds of chaos
Praise victory, to exterminate of gods
Fisting atomic death, into the face of humanity
Fisting atomic death, to all life created

Terroreign, Terroreign, Reign of Terror
Heathen Might, Power and Chaos
In my name.
Terroreign, Terroreign, Crown of Terror
Heathen Might, with my Septre of War
I do reign!
