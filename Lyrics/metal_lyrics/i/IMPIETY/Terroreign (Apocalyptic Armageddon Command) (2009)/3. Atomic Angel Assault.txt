Bloody and broken in flight
Blades seal their fate
Winged corpses in impure distress
Death illuminates

Crematorium skies
A war without end
Angels spiral downward
In glare of doom
Curse!

Demonic squadron in flight
Champions of maim and behead
Aggressors of horns and claws
Serve to exterminate
Brutal call to assemble
They launch their raids
Reeking carnage from above
Chaotic overture
Assault!

Bludgeoning God's devout, sentinels
Imminent savagery, imminent, genocide
Maelstrom of slaughter, and bestial wrath
My call for war is one
Atomic Angel Assault

Demons strike from above, and beyond...
