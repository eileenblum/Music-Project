Shalom... we greet upon our descent
To impurify the land where War had pit stands
Exterminate the flock of abrahamir pride
Birthplace of Adam, Swines of a kind

Shema Yisrael

Rabbis hung, prophets profaned
Altars of death await, Star now derays
Torahs scorched, Tanakhs eased
Birthplace of Adam, now a shitload of graves

Synagogues turn to dust
Zion uncreate
Brimstone und holocaust
Jerusalem's ugly fate

Shema Yisrael... We decimate
Shema Yisrael... Adonai is dead
Shema Yisrael... Realm of Ash
Shema Yisrael... I celebrate
As Judea Burns!
