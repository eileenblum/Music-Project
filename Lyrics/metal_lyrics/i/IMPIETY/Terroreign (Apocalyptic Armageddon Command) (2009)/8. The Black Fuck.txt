My Dark Subconscious
Beyond of death, of darkness
A land beyond for sure
Dark it's sky... dark as my hatred
Several times saw it
Because of death that brings them near
Memories from my past time...
And now I'll see the sorcerer
He must find the cure to my dark subconscious
To my dark memories about all hatred upon the dead

The world's gone
In my mind the horror lives
Death from the past time

He must find the cure to my dark subconscious
To my dark memories about all hatred upon the dead
