At One with Satan!
Fleeting though Infernos, weapons in hand
In scorching radiation, defiant I stand
Consecrating ancient Black Gods
Enter: dark Age of pestilence
Fisting, weak sheep of religion
Perforate their hearts &amp; souls!
Searing, chaste and mortal flesh
Urinate upon heavenly abode
Sacrificial violence
Endless chaos and bloodied hope

Bestial to the Bone!

Profanating icons of salvation
Vulgar end in swift demolishment
Armed and armoured with contempt
Vengeance regal and uncontrolled
Thunderous decimation
All living torn and rotten
Flagellation, intense destruction
Horizons dark in Carbon
I obey the call of slaughter
Inflict eternal pain
Devilish veil of torture
Barbarism in blackest flames
Command to slay

Bestial to the Bone...
I am!
