Saviour...Lying Broken on the Cross..Bleeding...This pain that brought you fame...Tearing at your flesh,Ripping off, Dismantling your ugly crown...Throw you to the dogs, I let them feastIn heathen mockery... VOMIT...JEHOVAH...VOMIT.... In ultimate unholiness... Let us cleanse your wounds with Blasphemy, Seraphs weep to their dismay,Dirty Shepard in cold blood ritual... Blessed be O' Annointed One...You still are King of Jews,Urine flows upon your throne..... We shall...Obliterate your flock,Exterminate your Light,A Revelation...of Excruciation! Bulldoze your church,Butcher your priests,Our Gospel...of first class Heresy! Staring at the burning heavens,I salute my hordes, knowing we have, Triumphantly won...
