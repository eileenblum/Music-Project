I welcome you to Hades,Underworld flaming red,To Hail, Praise my Master,The Abominator undead... Horrid King,Vile and Foul,Majestic General of Filth,Rabid tusks of Ivory, Morbid breath of death! Protector of Sodom - Aeons fade,CastingHeinous spells,Imperial Command on a golden throneSultan of Blasphemy... Reign in Chaos,Reign with Wrath,Infernal power so greatVictory unto darkness,Glory unto Hell... Send forth all horned Legions,Send forth all your Troops,Unto you, we've sworn AllegianceMaster Azazel... Beast....Of Abominable, Regiments! Heathen Lord of Desolate Empires,Spreading Darkness, Contempt and Violence...We combat hard, We combat proud,Under your evil Command... Strike, Destroy - fearlessly...Strike, Destroy - unceasingly... Abominable Regiments,In Unholy Praise of Armageddon!
