[Vulcano Cover]

You can not wonder what's up to begin
Seein' in the streets the missiles appear
Beside your house, they put an airbase
Nuclear guns, ready to explode

You're just watching, don't know what to do
The ones who have the power, are above you
And briefly they'll get, your life to lose
See the human race, wasted from the earth
