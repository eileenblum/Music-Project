Armoured in Black,Sentinels descend upon thy flockArmed with Death, Unprepared are the souls they'd rapeCrimson Wings,Silhouettes fear over grim horizonsReign of Steel,Tridents and blades shall seal your fate.. Lamentation...Pray all you want but your end is here..Profanation...Scoff and defile all structures of God,Desecration...Decimation... Embracing the terror that unfolds, Fucking messiahs, Fucking lies...King of Nazareth your Jesus Christ,Was never crowned, was never God... Judiasm and Christianity,Islam, Hindu and Buddhism..Are feeble created rubbish,Accept the truth, Respect the Pain... Terror, Death...WORSHIP! Sworn to Black,Sentinels descend upon thy flockCrowned with Death, Unprepared are the souls they'd rapeRadiant Wings,Silhouettes fear over grim horizonsMaelstrom of Steel,Tridents and blades shall seal their fate!
