Endorse all Plague, Cancers wake, Your Nightmare...Viral Infestation, Death's call... Whoa...Deteriorations from within,Rotten like the Trinity,Death made easy, Life made hard,I breathe out contagious disease... Devouring the flesh of Reverence,It has been told...Malignant parasites invade...Far beyond control...Tarnished and ridden with Impurity,Disfigurement,Adding more spice and beauty...Benign Art, of Death! Outbreak of complex and lethal virus strains,Vaccines deemed useless, betraying immunity, Escalate....the Pestilence...Escalate....the Pestilence... At one, with the earth, Decomposing fast,They eat you inside out...The World, Decomposing fast...Morbid Pests, On the rise!
