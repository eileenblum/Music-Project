Stranger in this town
Always on the lookout on the run
You almost couldnât care
Yea the loneliness is there

Drowning in the seas of madness
Broken heart to weigh you down
You desperately try but you cannot deny
Say goodbye it will bury you under

Stay â stay a while as you cross your
Heart and you hope to die
Stay â stay and watch it all fade away

A moment of truth
Thereâs a moment to behold
Creation come undone
As you watch the past unfold

Now here and forever
Donât let it in your way
Itâs one the same they preach their
Gospel in vain
No time to waste time waits for no one

Stay â stay a while as you cross your
Heart and you hope to die
Stay â stay and watch it all fade away

Stay â stay a while as you cross your
Heart and you hope to die
Stay â stay and watch it all fade away

Stay â stay a while as you cross your
Heart and you hope to die
Stay â stay and watch it all fade away
