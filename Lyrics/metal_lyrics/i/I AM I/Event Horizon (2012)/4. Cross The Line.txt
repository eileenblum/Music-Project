No communication
You donât know the steps you take
Itâs a violation
Every single move you make
Itâs a strange sensation
You can feel it in the air

You tell me that I crossed the line
The thought that never crossed my mind
You tell me that I crossed the line
You leave it all behind

Cover my eyes tell all your lies
Make me believe
Thereâs a light tonight it will be alright

No association
I donât know the steps you take
Itâs no consolation
Every single rule you break
Itâs a strange sensation
I can feel it in the air

You tell me that I crossed the line
The thought that never crossed my mind
You tell me that I crossed the line
You leave it all behind

Cover my eyes tell all your lies
Make me believe
Thereâs a light tonight it will be alright
Cover my eyes tell all your lies
Make me believe
Thereâs a light tonight it will be alright
