Close your eyes on the pillow soft at night
Lock the door hoping everythingâs alright
Say your prayers knowing nothing is forever!
Whatâs life if you cannot be alive?
What are dreams if you struggle to survive?
Is it real or is it my imagination?
They never stop to think what caused it all
They say you can leave the past where it belongs now

Hey, careful with what you say
Watch the tide rise and fall
Seize the day and take control
Hey, stop the games you play, take it as you think you may
Whatâs the price you have to pay?
Silent genocide

Eye for an eye makes the world go blind
Turn your back on the ones you left behind
Common sense be the answer to this madness
Watch the truth with the promise to be kind
While the king leaves no legacy behind
Knowledge comes but the wisdom lingers on
And after everything is said and done
Your laughter turns to tears another day, so

Hey, careful with what you say
Watch the tide rise and fall
Seize the day and take control
Hey, stop the games you play, take it as you think you may
Whatâs the price you have to pay?
Silent genocide

Still after everything is said and done
Youâre laughter turns to tears another day, so

Hey, careful with what you say
Watch the tide rise and fall
Seize the day and take control
Hey, stop the games you play, take it as you think you may
Whatâs the price you have to pay?
Silent genocide
