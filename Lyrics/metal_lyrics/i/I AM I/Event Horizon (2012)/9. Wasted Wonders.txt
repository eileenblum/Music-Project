I raise the bar canât set my sights too high
Why canât you see itâs futile not to try

All those moments lost in time
Will you search for all your
Wasted wonders
Gone are those days forever
Straight from hell down below
I come to take you soul

I witness persecution all the time
Why pray for absolution when you die

Through the past of all mankind
Still we search for all those

 Wasted wonders
Gone are those days forever
Straight from hell down below
I come to take you

Wasted wonders
Gone are those days forever
Straight from hell down below
I come to take you soul

Through the past of all mankind
Still we search for all those

Wasted wonders
Gone are those days forever
Straight from hell down below
I come to take you

Wasted wonders
Gone are those days forever
Straight from hell down below
I come to take you soul
