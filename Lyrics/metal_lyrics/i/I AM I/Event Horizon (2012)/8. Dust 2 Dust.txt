Now itâs the best youâve ever had
Oh how times have changed
Here is something to remember me
You live you donât ever care

All this time I can still recall
Here and now as you watch angels fall

Hit the lights donât wait forever
Destiny is all but a friend to me
Lonely nights wonât last forever
Once again hit the lights

I can recall the memories
They all slowly fade away
You get consumed by all the things
I am still living day by day

Once again from the dust I came
Twice remain from dust all the same

Hit the lights donât wait forever
Destiny is all but a friend to me
Lonely nights wonât last forever
Once again hit the lights
