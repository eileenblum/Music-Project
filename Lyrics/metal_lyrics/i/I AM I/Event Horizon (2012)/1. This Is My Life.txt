Here I stand, I'm ready for another day.
When everything you know may never be the same.
Now's the time, to say what's really on my mind!
Reality is looking through the eyes of mine

Now! with this world in full disguise,
And the truth's so hard to find!
Spend your life walking the line,
While they crucify mankind!

THIS IS MY LIFE!
(There's no fear in my soul)
THIS IS MY LIFE!
(Only I have control)

All this time, you were there, right by my side...
To help me up and give me hope to be alive,
Days gone by and still you resurrect my pride
Simply could not find my way against this tide

NOW! Let them pay for all their crimes,
They'll have nothing left to hide,
No redemption will you find,
Just a broken man inside!

THIS IS MY LIFE!
(There's no fear in my soul)
THIS IS MY LIFE!
(Only I have control!)
THIS IS MY LIFE!
(Taking back what you stole!)
THIS IS MY LIFE! Oh yeah-eah-yeah!
WOAH-OH-OH-WOAH-OH-OOOH

[Solos]

OOOOOOOH
THIS IS MY LIFE!
(There's no fear in my soul)
THIS IS MY LIFE!
(Only I have control)
THIS IS MY LIFE!
(taking back what they stole!)
THIS IS MY LIFE!, Oh yeaaaah-ee-yeah!
WoooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!
