Close together
Miles apart inside
Differences we cannot seem to hide

Fear and anger
Overcome your pride
Messed up way of life you need to get by

You know forever
Itâs such a long long time
To live your heart must beat to stay alive

Why the heartache
Why the mindless crimes
Stand outside the box and open your eyes

Still the blood run through my veins
Thereâs a place that I belong
Roots in foreign soil
Still my heart beats on
Reach inside your soul
Fight the anger you control
Itâs time itâs time leave the world behind

Not a place that we ainât been
Conquered all the world
What a scene

The past will haunt us
The future wonât be kind
Donât say what you will
Donât say that we cannot survive

Still the blood run through my veins
Thereâs a place that I belong
Roots in foreign soil
Still my heart beats on
Reach inside your soul
Fight the anger you control
Itâs time itâs time to leave it all

Whatâs the price
When will you realize
Youâre a king in ruins
Why canât you see
That there is not one thing left for me

Still the blood run through my veins
Thereâs a place that I belong
Roots in foreign soil
Still my heart beats on
Reach inside your soul
Fight the anger you control
Itâs time itâs time leave the world behind
