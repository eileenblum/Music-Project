They say never in a thousand years
Do we shed the tears
Do we know the price of war
Forever and a single day
Will it end this way
I never ask you for more

Didnât have the words to say
Like a child at play
You are the one I adore
Spread your wings into the sky
As you say goodbye
You make me come back for more

Iâll see you again, Iâll see you again
Gone are these days together
The seasons remain, a lifetime the same
Who wants to live forever

Tears will get you sympathy
Only you and me
I can feel it more and more
Nothing to replace our shame
But a burning flame
It melts you to the core

Never will you feel my pain
Will it be the same
One day Iâll be back for more
Standing in the pouring rain
Only me to blame
Let my ship sail from the shore

Iâll see you again, Iâll see you again
Gone are these days together
The seasons remain, a lifetime the same
Who wants to live forever

Donât let it pass you by
I want to see you try
Thereâs no escaping this
Iâll hold my head up high

Never will I feel the pain
Will it be the same
One day Iâll be back for more
Crying in the pouring rain
Only me to blame
Let my ship sail from the shore

Iâll see you again, Iâll see you again
Gone are these days together
The seasons remain, a lifetime the same
Who wants to live forever
