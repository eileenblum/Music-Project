Woe to you, blind guides
I swore by it all!
Â 
The selfish void that filled my heart
Carried out to questioning

I wondered what it could mean
To break down and what itâd mean to give in
I wondered what it could mean
To stand here, lonely
Â 
If I had only one chance to find out
Would even I care enough?
Is it worth the World?
Would it be worth the endless night spent in the cold
Yearning for a place Iâve already given up?
But Iâm helpless and searching
For the way out of this ever-dimming cave
Â 
Iâve been led to the water poisoned with blood
I know it too well and I wonât be brought to the drought again
With dried tongues and withered lungs, I gasp for something pure
But this Iâve said and let it stand; I wonât be led astray
Â 
Bring me closer to the sky
Bring me closer to the heart youâve mined
Bring me closer to the sky
Bring me closer so I might not be lost inside
Bring me closer
Â 
The Earth that buries these lies
Has already done all it can to sway the monuments
Towering the tribes that spread the movement
Of all our callous wants and beliefs
Â 
Iâve been led to the water poisoned with blood
But this Iâve said and let it stand; I wonât be led astray
