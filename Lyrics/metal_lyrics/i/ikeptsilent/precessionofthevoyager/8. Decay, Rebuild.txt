I, I am not afraid of what's to come
But this silence is deafening
I know you hear my words
But - I can't feel your presence
I'm freezing in the snow
Waiting for you to come to my rescue
My heart is growing numb
God, wake me up!

My body aches and I'm sore from believing
In anything and everything that is the center-point
Of all that I'm perceivingÂ 
As rigid love, as whole-hearted reform
All that I knew, all that I sought
I buried it with dead intentions
Trying to find a way to hear you respond
Trying to find a way to reap the cost

I need you
I know I can't survive this on my own
I'm scared and I'm trembling
I need youÂ 
I know I'll never fly until you mend my broken wings

Oh God, I need to feel you inside
I'm losing my grip on the truth
I'm gonna run agroundÂ 
My heart is hardened by this bitter world
I need you to break me from the inside out

I need you
I know I can't survive this on my own
I'm scared and I'm trembling
I need youÂ 
I know I'll never fly until you mend my broken wings

I've come here with empty hands
There's nothing I can give
Your love has never failed me
But I'm here standing still

Breathe into me
Make me whole again

I need you
I know I can't survive this on my own
I'm scared and I'm trembling
I need youÂ 
I know I'll never fly until you mend my broken wings

Oh God, I need to feel you inside
I'm losing my grip on the truth
I'm gonna run agroundÂ
