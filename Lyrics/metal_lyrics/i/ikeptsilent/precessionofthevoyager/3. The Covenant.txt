I've seen the broken before me;
I've seen the scarred and the damned;
But I will fear no evil,
For my Father is with me!

Are we the chosen or are we the broken?
And as I call to my Savior
I know we've elected the fallen:
A leader of the damned
To cast out God and bury the lamb
We are not the fallen!
A fortress of God, forever calling
Chosen are we to repent the serpent
Chosen to be of The Holy Kingdom
Broken are we, but I've seen the truth
Broken is he and we'll cast him to the ground

I've seen the broken,
The scarred, and the damned
But I will fear no evil

Help me God, I've been away for too long
Not my will but, Father, Yours be done!
Help me God, they know no wrong
Save me God, I've been away far too long

Forgive me Father for I have sinned!
But I know my Savior;
Evil will never win

As my body breaks and my soul begins to turn
You move mountains for me and show me what I truly deserve
You show me what I deserve!
I know I'm not alone anymore

Pick me up!

Where will we go from here
If failure is not an option?
And no one will see
The light through broken mirrors
When all reflections have faded away
I know that we are strong and the weak will become the prey
This is my aspiration
I'll be with Him one day!

We will not falter from His grace!
We will learn our rightful place!
