Stay away from me; your "truths" bring no solace anymore
I find resolution in your famished words
Bludgeoning but I will stand in my conviction
Corpses line the streets you claim as your own
Step away from this hatred inside all of us
I am not a part of this; extinguish the menacing speech
Â 
This is where we stand!
Iâve seen the lies you breed, your words corrupted with filth
I cannot believe you have a say in this world
Who are we to allow this to happen?
Â 
We canât be the ones to say where we are left dead
Weâre stranded to justify everything we've doneÂ 
But I know He will see me through,
I know He will hear me through
This maelstrom (of my transgressions)

He is everything!
Take me through the ground
I know the sincerity will bring forth the remedy
Â 
Tell me all the things that you want me to hear
The news has been revealed
Tell me all the things that you want me to hear
The news has been revealed so lie to me now,
Great Abandoner!
Â 
I have all the time I the world to collect my own miserable thoughts
I know that the pieces you left me are filled with the hearts of the lost
