No quality of life at home
As a child everything seemed so fairytale
But the world you fell into would quickly shape who you are
Take control and break the chains!
Your family never cared about you
They only wanted to hold you under the tide
Â 
You still showed them grace
After they stripped it out
They tried to beat you down.
You have a light they tried to hide,
Who knows why?
Who knows?
Â 
Mother who went insane, took a hammer to the brain
Showed her daughter the wrong way
The pages are burning!
Â 
Through struggle we elope the flame
Finding ourselves in the light once again
And if you hold onÂ I will show you,
I will show you what all of this means for you and I
Â 
Release the resentment that's gripping your mindÂ 
Shine through the dirt we bury ourselves in constantly
Â 
You're falling; you've fallen into the well,
The water will wash you away
I know that you'll never; you'll never escape on your own
Â 
Therefore know that our nature is putrid
We succumb to the slightest temptations
There is something outside of us that allows us to stray
Â 
Left with the weight of your life and haunting memories
You stand, convicted for the outcomes you canât control,
In front of that table,
You pick it up and spin,
Barrel to the mouth and a quivering stance
You made the one decision you canât take back.
