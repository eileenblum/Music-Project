[Pretext:
It feels like the air is getting thicker by the minute.
This room suffocates me, abstruse and strange but nothing less then reality?
Recognition. Another temple, another lie... another non-being.
Once here, now gone. You're consumed, but you linger on. The vision feels so real.
Engaged in thoughts of murder. Stabbing you in the face.
All the pain I took I saved. It's in retaliation that the visions lives, and so... slowly it has begun.
A serenade and bestowal, the act of the last remembrance.]

Let the bile sip out
Your mucus be gone
My mares be your mares
Ride your flesh forever on
All pain removed
Thrown back on you

All given is now taken
As I took is given back
Seven knots in all
It has been done
This rope around your neck
You're dead, forgotten and hung
My mind extend
Animus expelled
My will, be your faith
You're dead and forever gone
Mark sealed in blood
So here is my gift
Another emptiness...

Devour - consumed
Gutted and split wide open
Dissect your soul
Sterile flesh and a frigid future
As a last remembrance... I will transform
Descend into the house of him
Inside your flesh
Your soul to halt, mind in dim
I bestow you a fruitless womb
This soul expand - Animus sterilized
My will, be your faith
You're dead, forgotten and hung
Everything abstract
Your frigid ways
Another emptiness
Depleting the non-fucking-being again!
And I will ride on your misery
Etch my will into your deity
Devoured - consumed
I'll eat your heart and all your memories
Depart from all
Depleted debris - gone - You'll be ... gone!
My will, be your faith
You're dead and forever gone
Mark sealed in blood

So here is my gift
Another emptiness

Devour - consumed
Gutted and split wide open
Dissect your soul
Sterile flesh and a frigid future
As a last remembrance... I will transform
Descend into the house of him
Inside your flesh
Your soul to halt, mind in dim
I bestow you a fruitless womb
This soul expand
Animus sterilized
My will, be your faith
You're dead, forgotten and hung
Everything abstract
Your frigid ways
Another emptiness
Depleting the non-fucking-being again!
And I will ride on your misery
Etch my will in to your deity
Devoured - Consumed
I'll eat your heart and all your memories
Depart from all
Depleted debris... gone - You'll be ... gone!
