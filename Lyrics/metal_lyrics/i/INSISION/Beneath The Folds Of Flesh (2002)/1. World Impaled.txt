As it unfolds we all be dead
Like an empty thought in someone else's head
Through the mud it's calling me
Global death immediately

Worlds collide, astral beast gleams
Demons attack, this world, Impaled

World impaled, human race, is erased, we are the waste
World impaled, as you crawl, in your blood, Satan wins

Blind deliverance of pain, as we understand our fate.
We are the waste!

Nearer it comes nearer. Nearer it crawls nearer

He's the face of the atom bomb.
The fifth rider, of the four, to come
He's Kingdom will come.
Prophesy his kingdom will come

WORLD IMPALED 

World impaled, human race, is erased, we are the waste
World impaled, as you crawl, in your blood, Satan wins.

Nearer it comes nearer. Nearer it crawls nearer.

As it unfolds we all be dead
like an empty thought in someone else's head.
Through the mud it's calling me
Global death immediately
