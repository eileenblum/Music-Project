Fire demon, I call on you
Earth demon, nocturnal god.
Ineo templi, temple of flesh
I submerge into your womb
oh serpi demon I envy

in a sphere of transparent goo
a foetus of unearthly laws
Ripping through the embryo walls
I want out!

Air demon, I call your name
Water demon, snake of the sea
I know your disguise, I see the truth.
I submerge into your womb
Oh serpi demon I envy

When I am the thirsty one
You will be my water
When I am the frozen one
You will be my fire
When I am the soaked one
You will be my wind
When I am the lost one
You will be my Earth

I bind you with my thoughts
I can feel your energy
Canalising my will. 
Your will
One will

Deus, Deabolus, I felt your strength
Rex mundi, Lord of the earth
Animus Exitus, I'm drifting back
I emerge from your womb
Oh serpi daemon I know thee.

From a world of dominance.
A creature created complete

I stepped aside, I'm here again.
In a world of decadence

[Lyric by: Birath]
