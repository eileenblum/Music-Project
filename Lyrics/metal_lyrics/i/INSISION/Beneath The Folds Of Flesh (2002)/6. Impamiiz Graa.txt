I'll go between as if to sever me
to carve a bit of my personality
Rejected, confused it divides
it lingers on, a Satan's device
In disgust a grinning smile, a shifting gaze as he returns
Eyes, they stare. Throats, they laugh,
but I'm still here, in Satans paws
Impamiiz Gaa, tongue of silver mind of gold
Impamiiz Graa hell-demanding prince
Impamiiz Graa tongue of silver mind of gold
I'm doing what I'm told
Embraced once again underneath his teeth filld face.
Insane spinning in circles, 
like a top in Satan's paw
In disgust a grinning smile a, shifting gaze as he returns
Eyes they stare, Throats, they laugh, 
but I'm still here, in Satan's paws

Strangulation of my soul
Impamiiz Graa in total control
re-born in this cosmic hell
tossed between a suspended mind:
You rejoice.
For he is here...
Rejoice!
