Rex - Spiritus - Dominus.

Through the garden of knives he travels, Graa the spirit
Through the garden of bones he travels, Impamiiz the demon king
Through the house of flesh he travels, Impamiiz Graa the subconscious one
Through the temple of dreams he travel, the never setting moon

I am him, the one without sense
I am him, Impamiiz Graa
I am him the one without sense
Subconscious demon, lurking

I am him, bound to my core
I am him, Impamiiz graa
I am him, bound to may core
And so I will travel to lands far beyond

He is my flight, carrier of life
The key to a door, yet not seen

He is the knife who cleaves the night
He is the one who breathes my breath
He is the one trapped in my head
And so I will travel to the land of the dead

He is my fever - My fever...

Your carnage is welcomed to me
Inside your world I am free
There are no bounders. No boundaries

I can feel you tear inside
Tear away my fleshy walls
through my soul you tumble down
I AM YOURS!

Impamiiz
Graa
Impamiiz
Impamiiz Graa
