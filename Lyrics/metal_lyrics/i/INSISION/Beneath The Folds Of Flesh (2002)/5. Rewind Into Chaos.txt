Rewind this cosmic sphere
into its origin, Chaos.

Demons where masters there
and we shall be like them..

Like them - OVERWHELMING!
Like them - INTELLIGENT!

Ab ovo!
Begin again
-For this world is a failure!
Ab ovo!
Begin again
-For this world is inferior!

Rewind this cosmic sphere
into its origin, Chaos.
TIAMAT, CHUTU, SATAN
ABSU, ERIM, LEVITHAN
Divine!

Chaos was all in what is
still corrupted by the stupid
Jehovah, Jesus, god of what?
This world? INFERIOR!

Rewind yourself, crush the glass
Go on through, go forth and "be" again

Go back, Ab ovo, from Ur
There are no winners here
Look back and accept your fault
Or you'll be stuck here forever

Rewind your broken mind
Into controlled chaos
Try to see from the other side
Just spew your magic

-Reflect your status now!
What do you want to keep
what is it that you like
Have no restrictions here

-Satan I am divine!
I choose my way to go
I can see from the other side
And so I use my magic:

Their tools are yours.
Their names are many.
Their shapes are fierce,
and you are the start of it all

REWIND ALL!

Ab ovo! 
Begin again
for this world is a failure!

Ab ovo! 
Begin again
for this world is a failure!
