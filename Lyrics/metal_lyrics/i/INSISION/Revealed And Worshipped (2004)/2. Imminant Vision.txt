Splendour, from darkness thick as blood
Tentacles unfold, and I endure (the pain)
Is this real?!
Tries to grasp the sight by hand
In a pending state of consciousness
I am splendour,
I am the highest form
The spear of flesh, penetrating, consuming this world
I am the conqueror,
I am all
Sublime though
Darkness in a different colour
I am the creator
I built this world
I am your saviour
I plan the path of which to walk
In this world of satan,
The god with a thousand names
In the opposite of our world
I transcend into the mind
I wear the mask of death
Oblivious to life itself
In this world of power
Direct and undisputed dominance
Imminent vision!!
I hear
I see
And therefore unfold!
As I plunge into the depths.
All life ends
A catatonic state of mind,
As the host of my body descends
There is nothing
There is everything
There is splendors
There is
