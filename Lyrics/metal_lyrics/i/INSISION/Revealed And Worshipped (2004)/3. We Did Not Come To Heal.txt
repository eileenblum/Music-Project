Bound by the flesh
Restricted by the mortals
Merged in my heart
This fate is sealed
We did not come to heal
Your endless self deceit
Misery and your companion
Misguided,
Emotional distress
I am not reflecting in the mirror
I'm not the answer to your lie
I am, but me
My belief is who I am
My eyes do not move
My breath does not breathe
My words do not reach
I did not come to heal
In evil rewind
Received through the sign
When rejected on earth
As in heaven
The outcast/exile
We do not come to heal
The scar made by god
Open soul dissection
Last incision -
Is all your own blood
We did not come to heal
Your nail-driven soul
Your self-pity, embodied
When incised, it's all rotten
I breathe on
This is unavoidable
I breathe on
Well go on
It is perpetual
This won't stop
