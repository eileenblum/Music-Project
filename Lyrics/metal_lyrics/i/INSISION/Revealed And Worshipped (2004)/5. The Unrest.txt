It's gaping graves, endless death
The war has come, hold the flames
Is gaping graves, endless death
The harvest reaped, and nothing left
Exalted one, now revealed
Uplifted one, non concealed
Exalted one, endless death
We are the gods complete on the earth
Embodied in the flesh
It's the unrest
We thrive upon your vision
We endure the faults of them
I am you in law of obedience!
It's time has come, war be won
The angels fall, burnt to the ground
Erected high upon the stakes
I am free for the law is me!
The dawn of them, who see again
Those up high, all cast down
Overrun by the unrest
Where man can be god over god!
Upon the mountains of dread you've appeared
In it's twilight and it's daze
Entwined in thoughts, rewind
Come here from your death
Dimensions parallel
Open the way to the second world
Enchant, focus, control
Reawaken to achieve the goal
And through chaos reborn
It's coming of our lord
Enchant, focus, control
Reawaken to achieve the goal
And through chaos reborn
Through chaos reborn
Receive us satan!!
