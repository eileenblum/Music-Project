Walking through the shapes of dread
Bound to pledge this human shape
Once straight, now lay crooked and still
A hateful plan to end this pain
I find the strength in the darkest realms
Underneath the horns I seek
Where the path is always lit
Lit by the morning star himself
The way of my loathing
Is lined with your thorns of
Christ Never will forgive
The veil of oppression will fall
My hatred, rage and fury (Bestow!)
Underneath the wings of satan
We fly free, bestial dominance
The arrival of the legions
The cleansing has begun!
Monoliths have fallen
His throne has been overrun
Blessed are you to witness
When we wash them all away
Your adversary (Once fallen)
Now alive to slay the dog
Well wait for your arrival
And well east them down
Mucus of earth suffocate us
We wash it all away!
The fifth of Christ restrain us
We wash it all away!
Dog and the holy hoax
We wash it all away!
The blessed and trinity
We wash it all away!
The brooding has come to it's end
Time has action in it's hands
Gods chosen one has failed
All washed down the drain
