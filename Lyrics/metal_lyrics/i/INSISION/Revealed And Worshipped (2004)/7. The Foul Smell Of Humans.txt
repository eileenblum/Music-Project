I choke on words
I can't express this nothingness
The one from within carves
My soul eaten from inside
My speech is numb
They seem to hear me
Still words are lost
Robber of thoughts
They all are deaf
I see through flesh
Every inch every fucking particle
Just empty shells, human waste
Their meaningless exposed
There's something wrong inside
Faces go pale and the feelings subside
I cannot see you here
The doors wide open but still I'm blind
Burnt up inside
Breathing through a hole in my prison cell
You smell so foul
Within your picture perfect world
You speak so loud
Still your meaning rot away
You are so weak
In your picture perfect world
Aggravated existence
Your life is meaningless
Just pick up that shotgun
Do what you know is best
You can see your reflection beyond the mirror wall
Through all your pain and anguish
You can hear it call you!
It's still so foul... the smell of humans...
The foul smells of humans
