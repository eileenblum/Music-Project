Plague mass!
Over the horizon is spreads
From the threshold of darkness
A mass of crawling chaos
Awaiting to engulf this realm
Cosmic tentacles of pure hate
Reducing population to zero
To begin a new reign
From the black abyss
Malicious plague mass
Spoken of in tales of horror
Feared by the oppressing mass
Called by a thousand names
The saga becomes reality
In dreams of lost worlds
A gateway has been evoked
Life is twisted dreams
Inside the burning mass
Forms of unreality
Transformed into solid structures
A face of entrails
A sea of blood
Heaven is taken
Gods demise
It calls it's name to the masses!
In front of the one and only plague
Grotesque plague mass
It calls it's name unto the world
It calls it's name to the masses!
In front of the one and only plague
Grotesque and feeble
The sheep are gathered
Plague mass!
Cosmic tentacles of pure hate
Reducing population to zero
To begin a new reign
From the black abyss
Malicious plague mass
Spoken of in tales of horror
Feared by the oppressing mass
Called by a thousand names
