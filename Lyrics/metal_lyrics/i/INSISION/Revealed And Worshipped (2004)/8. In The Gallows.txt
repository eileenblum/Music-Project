I want to be what their eyes can't see
I sweep their minds just to recollect
Abandon souls in a rotten tree
In the gallows hangs their god
I am the demon made in flesh
Just as vulnerable as them
A thousand screams but just one soul
Assimilate us all.
Enlighten us in our path
Show us your guidance
Bestow us in our exposure
Be here with us angels of the devil
Bastard saints, legion
Uncloaked, naked against (your) destiny
Cast your robe, I've lit the flame
The meaning of the words, I summon thee
Turn your back on Yahweh
Oppressing you, eternally
Free that thought, I've lit the flame
In the gallows Hangs your god...
I call you all to witness this
Upon this altar, fresh in mind
Abominate the human shape
Behold transformation
I have robbed you of your time
Infixed my words, sublime
I'm in control of your mind
In here, my world, right now!
