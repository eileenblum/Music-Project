Thorns pierce your eyes
Clinging to the lie
Every second of your agony - he died for you?
Whores of the illusion
Forced on built in just fresh from the factory
Your guilt is none of ours
The cross is yours to bear
Your preachers preach (with) your kin in their knees
Close your eyes shut your ears
His salvation is all that you hear
Your fathers preach throughout their screams
Still fail to see gods glory is out of your reach
Give our bread and so be blessed
Thorns pulled out, your guilt relieved
Confess your sins and wash your hands
Then all is well in the promised lands
Is turmoil - in the land of the free
Havoc - in the land of the righteous
The holy father inside your son
Close your eyes and let it be done
All in the name of salvation
Justify the (holy) penetration
Self inflicted, swarm the land
Your fate is dying and so is your kind
Wed be killing you off at a raging speed
Well chew you up and spit you out
Fail to see the rot
The contradicting faith
Turn your check the other way
Say you prayers and hope for god?
Fail to see the rot
The unrelenting truth
Confess your sins and pray
Then all is well another day?
