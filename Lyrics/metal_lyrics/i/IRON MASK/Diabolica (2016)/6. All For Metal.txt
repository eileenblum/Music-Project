Children of the night,
I am your voice
The rite has just begun
I will be your guide
till the end
Through your torments
I will share your life
I will possess your body and soul
You'll never detach from me
United we are strong and we'll remain
ourselves forevermore

All for Metal,
All for Rock
It will always rule my world
We belong to the night,
we will rock till we die
All for Metal,
All for Rock

Feel the danger,
hear the loudness
Like a blazing thunder storm
Your heartbeat is now going faster,
you can't escape
you're in my hands
Now, you delivered from all sins
and stand true to our believes
The path where all think it's so dark
for us it's brighter than a thousand stars

All for Metal,
All for Rock
It will always rule my world
We belong to the night,
we will rock till we die
All for Metal,
All for Rock
It will always rule,
All for Metal
All for Metal
All for Rock
