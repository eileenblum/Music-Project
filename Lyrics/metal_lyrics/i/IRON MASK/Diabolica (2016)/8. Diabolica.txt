Madness, Decadence
Is there still mercy?
This world has gone to hell,
this planet lost control
And I can't stand this life anymore
None is innocent. Everything slowly dies
We'll never get back faith anymore

Diabolica, Diabolica
Diabolica, Diabolica

Children, raise your fists
Don't let it all fall apart
How can we be so blind?
Insanity and lies.
And this must end,
an eye for an eye
the evil hides so well,
the beasts have shown their face
Now, we must fight fire with fire

Diabolica, Diabolica
Diabolica, Diabolica
Oh oh oh Oh oh oh
Diabolica, Diabolica
Diabolica, Diabolica
