I've always been this guy
who believes in his dreams
But sometimes life doesn't take
the expected way
The sacrifice I made, I pay it every day
Playing with fools
They'll take the eyes of a blind man
Only the wealthy strive
In this world of despair
But I will face it till the end

I don't forget, I don't forgive
I won't regret, my life has to go on
I don't forget, I don't forgive
I won't regret, I will be free

You speak with fancy words
but I can see your game
Using your best cards
still the ace is in my hands
You tried to break me down
with all those ugly lies
But I will smash you like an ant

I don't forget, I don't forgive
I won't regret, my life has to go on
I don't forget, I don't forgive
I won't regret, I will be free
