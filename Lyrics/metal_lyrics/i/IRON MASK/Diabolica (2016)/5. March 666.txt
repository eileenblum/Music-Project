In a time of war and throw
In a land where madness ruled
The devil's hand was pulling the strings
Uniting them all
Hypnotizing with his speeches
Behind the mask of the nation's pride
Then he raised a furious army
To hide his lies

Oh oh oh March 666
Oh oh oh March 666

He used fear as his biggest weapon
There was no mercy in his eyes
Follow his word and you'll be safe
For the sake of the race
The troops of death were marching on
Gathering women, children and men
Orders to kill, orders to torture
Die for the Reich

Oh oh oh March 666
Oh oh oh March 666
