Galileo Galilei was his name
He was born in the renaissance
A stargazer soul with an open mind
A lifetime staring at the skies
Watching Jupiter and its moons,
the heavens have no secrets for him.
He revealed the Earth was not the center
in God's cosmic design

Galileo, forgotten genius locked in a cell
Galileo, prisoner of Rome, he lived in hell
Galileo, they tried so hard to tame his mind
Galileo, one day the world will see he's right

In Pisa, on the tower
He proved his science and theories
The law of the pendulum made his fame
Then he built his own mighty telescope
And told us the truth about the solar system
But he died as a heretic
Blind and sick, the books he wrote stupidly banned

Galileo, forgotten genius locked in a cell
Galileo, prisoner of Rome, he lived in hell
Galileo, they tried so hard to tame his mind
Galileo, one day the world will see he's right
