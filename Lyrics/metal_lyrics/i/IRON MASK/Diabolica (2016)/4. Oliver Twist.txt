An orphan English boy,
so fragile and so young
A life of poverty,
he stayed in a workhouse since he's born
No comforts and no food,
he had to beg for more
The beadle was no good man
and gave the kid away
He had to face their hate,
he had to face their violence

But one day he striked back
and escaped for London
to meet his destiny

Oliver Twist, innocent lad
There's only one way to survive
Oliver Twist, you might get smashed
You have to struggle for your life
Oliver Twist, don't cross the line
There's only one step to the crime
Oliver Twist, better watch out
Child of the street, keep up the fight
Oliver Twist's always on the run
Oliver Twist's always on the run
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

So naive, full of hopes,
he met honest folks
Then he lived with Fagin
and his gang at Saffron Hill
In the pickpockets lair,
ensnared he had to steal
Again mistreated,
he had to obey or he'll be killed
Surrounded by evil souls,
just one man believed him as his son
Fagin was arrested,
Condemned to the gallows
The kid found his family

Oliver Twist, innocent lad
There's only one way to survive
Oliver Twist, you might get smashed
You have to struggle for your life
Oliver Twist, don't cross the line
There's only one step to the crime
Oliver Twist, better watch out
Child of the street, keep up the fight
Oliver Twist's always on the run
Oliver Twist's always on the run
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
