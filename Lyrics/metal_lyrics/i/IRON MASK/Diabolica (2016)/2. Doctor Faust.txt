You have reached the very end
of everything you learned
Pushed by your excessive pride,
you want the secret knowledge
With the help of magicians,
you summoned the devil
Falling deep into the arts
of unholy magic rites

Two angels appeared, the good and the bad
Will you be wise? Will you be strong?
One by one they spoke, will you leave the lord?
Mephistopheles wants you
It is too late and you have made your choice
You striked a deal with the prince of hell
What will be, shall be, there's no turning back
For twenty four years you will get
all what you need

Doctor, Doctor Faust
Have you lost your soul?
Doctor, Doctor Faust
Have you sold your soul?

Now the pact has to be sealed,
your precious blood as ink
The wound was divinely healed
but you refused God's help
You've been warned,
you are so blind to your own salvation
Lucifer showed you the truth,
seven deadly sins
You took your oath, the evil has won
The road to hell is all you've earned
And you are old, you've spent all your life
Waiting for answers you never had
The messenger fooled to you, as sinner you'll die
His only master was Lucifer
For twenty four years
You had all what you want
The damnation devils have torn
your body assembly

Doctor, Doctor Faust
Have you lost your soul?
Doctor, Doctor Faust
Have you sold your soul?

Two angels appeared, the good and the bad
Your mind wasn't so bright in the end
The demon has won, you did the wrong choice
You played with fire and your soul is lost
