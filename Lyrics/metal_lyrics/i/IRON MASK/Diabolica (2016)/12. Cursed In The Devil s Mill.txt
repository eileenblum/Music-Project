Follow the of your master
Only he decides who dies
You are in the hands of darkness
You made your choice
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Every day you have to grind
Every night, Black arts apprentice
You will learn the evil spells
But death wants his share
Under the new moon, they all obey
One of them has to die
To keep the master forever young

Like the raven, fly
You're forever
cursed in the devil's mill
Like the raven, fly
You're forever trapped
In the devil's den

Now you realized the magic
Can't be undone, he is too vicious
He will tempt you, He will fool you
Never shake the demon's hand
Only love could break this curse
Only this girl with her heart
Never pronounce her name
Or the master will take her soul
But death wants his share
Every year, one of them has to die
And you all dig this grave
Everything in this world has a price

Like the raven, fly
You're forever
cursed in the devil's mill
Like the raven, fly
You're forever trapped
In the devil's den
