Flying high
through clouds and the storm
Hunting down enemies
Aces of aces,
he'll get them all
He has no fear in his heart,
no regrets and no remorse

Flying Fortress,
Always fearless
Flying Fortress,
In the skies forevermore
Flying Fortress,
So relentless
Flying Fortress,
You will fight forevermore

He will defend the island
Sending them right to hell
Hero of War, Bravest of all
One by one they are falling,
He has to fly to feel alive

Flying Fortress,
Always fearless
Flying Fortress,
In the skies forevermore
Flying Fortress,
So relentless
Flying Fortress,
You will fight forevermore
