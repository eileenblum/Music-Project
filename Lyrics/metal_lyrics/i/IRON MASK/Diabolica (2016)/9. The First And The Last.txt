A life full of sorrow.
A broken heart of glass
You saw the light
when all around was just black
I came into your world,
you healed my deadly wounds
Two Lonely wolves met,
now the hunt can begin
after the rain and the storm.
You helped me up from the ground
There's no more pain,
no more cries
I will reach for the sky

Let me be the first and only
Let me be the last and only
Let me be the one to hold you
As long as I live, your guiding star
Let me be the first and only
Let me be the last and only
As long as I live,
I'll be your guiding star

Is it our destiny?
I know we're meant to be
The frozen winter's gone,
together we are one
After the violent thunder.
After so many wars.
I've stopped to bleed,
I start to live
The limit is the sky

Let me be the first and only
Let me be the last and only
Let me be the one to hold you
As long as I live, your guiding star
Let me be the first and only
Let me be the last and only
As long as I live,
I'll be your guiding star

No Gods, no demons, no men.
None could break this bond
Forever side by side,
two wild wolves running free
