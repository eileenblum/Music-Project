Morning Star, your light has gone
You can't take over God's throne

Fallen Angel
From the kingdom of Heaven, you're exiled
You have lost your holy wings
now and forevermore
In a realm of flames and sorrow
you hide eternally
Sometimes light turns out in darkness

Now the flesh and blood you rule
Mortal Kings forever doomed

Fallen Angel
From the kingdom of Heaven, you're exiled
You have lost your holy wings
now and forevermore
In a realm of flames and sorrow
you hide eternally
Sometimes light turns out in darkness

[Spoken:]
"I will ascend to heaven, I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit on the mount of assembly on the heights of Zaphon; I will ascend to the top of the clouds. I will make myself like the Most High. I will take over heaven. I will be God."

Fallen Angel
From the kingdom of Heaven, you're exiled
You have lost your holy wings
now and forevermore
In a realm of flames and sorrow
you hide eternally
Sometimes light turns out in darkness

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
The rebellion of Lucifer.
The light fades in the dark
The rebellion of Lucifer.
The perfect angel dies
The rebellion of Lucifer.
You'll never wear that crown
The rebellion of Lucifer.
Now your soul's on fire
