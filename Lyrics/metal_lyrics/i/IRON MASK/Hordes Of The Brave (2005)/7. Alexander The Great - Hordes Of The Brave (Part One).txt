He was the son of one Phillip The King, ancient lord on the dawn of time
Olympias, his mother was a witch, dedicated to the rites and spell
She killed the king and he became the master, Leading hordes of Macedonia
furious army of barbarians, taking Greece and all cities of Zeus.

In the eye of the storm, Athena gave him strength and power
No mercy for the enemies, king of kings, he was the strongest man on the earth.

On the wings of the war, there's no limit for the bravest reign
Through the wilderness and on trails of sand
He was conquering the Persian throne, the vision of a life.

Alexander The Great, you'd been chosen by gods
Alexander The Great, glorious power and golden lord

With many thousand men and chargers, his campaign set off to the east
Taking Gaza and the fortress' gold, reaching roads of Babylon
Battle after battle, his territory (was) growing on
When he arrived at the pyramids, the holy land was gift.

In the eye of the storm, Athena gave him strength and power
No mercy for the enemies, king of kings, he was the strongest man on the earth.

On the wings of the war, there's no limit for the bravest reign
Through the wilderness and on trails of sand
He was conquering the Persian throne, the vision of a life.

Alexander The Great, you'd been chosen by gods
Alexander The Great, glorious power and golden lord

[acoustic/spoken:]
On the shore of the Egyptian sea, building the city of Alexandria.
And in the oracle of Zeus-Ammon, the old priest told him
You're the chosen one, the son of god

In the eye of the storm, Athena gave him strength and power
No mercy for the enemies, king of kings, he was the strongest man on the earth.

On the wings of the war, there's no limit for the bravest reign
Through the wilderness and on trails of sand
He was conquering the Persian throne.
On the wings of the war, there's no limit for the bravest reign
