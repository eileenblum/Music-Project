Do you see all this violence?
Do you feel this suffering in your heart?
All this bloodshed on TV screens,
It makes me think that hell is just here on earth
Could we be all united?
The endless wars are killing the innocents
Are you going to let them do it?
Don't you see that our children are still crying?
Dying in the bombs flames in eternal pain

Oh Lord forgive me!
This is my last good bye
How can I fight the enemy?
I'm close to crystal tears

What's the meaning of our lives?
I try to find the answers so many times
I feel the madness of a decadent world:
We are all searching for something
Nowhere to be found
Is it the end of the story?
Can I live without this evil rule?
Are you going to let them do it?
Don't you see that our children are still dying?
Hear the thunder roaring in the dead of night

Oh Lord forgive me!
This is my last good bye
How can I fight the enemy?
I'm close to crystal tears
