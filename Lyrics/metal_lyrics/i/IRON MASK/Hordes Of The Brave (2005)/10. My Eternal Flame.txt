I've always been searching for the guiding star in the night
Through smoke of fire winds and the winter's cold
Now I feel so bad
Emptiness in my heart
I just want some peace and calm
Before the shadow comes,
Before the night falls

Dreams of you,
Light up the night
You're still in my heart,
You're still in my soul
One more ordinary day,
Without your love
Without the light of angels

My eternal flame burns forever.

Look at the rising sun reborn eternally
Look at the beauty of the world that lay beneath
But all seems to be so black
I am forever lost
I just wanna see the light
Try to find the way
And darkness all around

Dreams of you,
Light up the night
You're still in my heart
You're still in my soul
One more ordinary day
Without your love
Without the light of angels

My eternal flame burns forever

[Solo]

Dreams of you,
Light up the night
You're still in my heart
You're still in my soul
One more ordinary day
Without your love
Without the light ofâ

Dreams of you,
Light up the night
You're still in my heart
You're still in my soul
One more ordinary day
Without your love
Without the light of angels

My eternal flame burns forever
