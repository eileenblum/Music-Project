After the storm, after the war
Far from the light you never saw the sign
So plain to see who wins the game
Don't ever cross my way again
Lost in the darkness you will pay the price
The final day has come for you
And now you're standing on the battlefield.
You'll never take the crown
As your blood spills on the holy ground.

Oh-ooh, we fight so hard for independence
We will fight until the end, freedom's blood

Close prophecies, warnings fulfil
Touching the sky, we will be glorious
You wanted struggles But we are much too strong
Now here we stand right face to face
There is no choice you won't get out alive
Your time has come, there's no place to hide.
And now you're lying on the battlefield,
You'll never take the crown
As your blood spills on the holy ground.

Oh-ooh, we fight so hard for independence
We will fight until the end, freedom's blood
And now you're dying on the battlefield
You'll never take the crown
As your blood spills on the holy ground.

Oh-ooh, we fight so hard for independence
We will fight until the end, freedom's blood
