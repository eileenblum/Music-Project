You choose to follow evil
You think your life is so pure
I know you've lost your mind, prisoner of illusion
In the name of god you're killing,
You will be king in heaven
You preach the bad words to the children of this world
I just want to be free
I'll always be the master of my life and destiny
Your heart is so black; committing all these crimes,
You stab a knife right in my back

Holy war, Holy war
Tell me what you're fighting for
Do you want to fight eternally?
Holy war, Holy war
You won't find what you're raging for
The whole world is your enemy.
(Holy War)

You are the mask of Satan, the sword of evil on earth
Invasion is your first wish, leading all these fools
And I just want to break you
You are the force to be stopped
Don't ever cross my frontier; I will hunt you down
I just want to be free
I'll always be the master of my life and destiny
Your heart is so black; committing all these crimes,
You stab a knife right in my back

Holy war, Holy war
Tell me what you're fighting for
Do you want to fight eternally?
Holy war, Holy war
You won't find what you're raging for
The whole world is your enemy.
(Holy War)
