High in the sky your time has come,
Only the strong will survive
Don't ever try to rule my life again
Before the attack you have already lost
You're just a fool and we shall win this war.
You will burn in hell
You know the rule,
You've cross the line and you will pay the price
Never get our souls,
You're such a clown; don't think you are the king
We will show no mercy!

In valleys, on mountains and high in the sky
We stand as one for god and country
In valleys, on mountains and high in the sky
Defend our land until we die, high(high) in the sky.

High in the sky, you've lost your mind.
Not king but a pawn is your part
I will tear you into pieces and we'll laugh
Then you understand what you have done
I will disabuse you and I make you see
Pray for your souls!
You know the rule.
You've cross the line and you will pay the price
Never get our souls.

In valleys, on mountains and high in the sky
We stand as one for god and country
In valleys, on mountains and high in the sky
Defend our land until we die, high(high) in the sky.

In valleys, on mountains and high in the sky
Defend our land until we die, high(high) in the sky.
