Walking in the streets; all alone in the dark
Crossing the line, where the beast makes the rules
My journey begins through this city of sins
Lords of the white dust will watch over me
I see this entire people. They suffer each day
Reach for the light in an illusive world
Try to be free, Don't believe this lies
In the end death wins the game
Find your own way with the power of your soul,
You can be so strong.

Demon's child, infant of evil
Demon's child, ruler of madness
Demon's child, longing for my soul
Demon's child and I will defeat you, demon's child

Don't cry for mercy cause I'll give you pain
Crime is your mission, the sense of your life
You're sailing to nowhere with hundred of fools
You chose to ignore me, now go burn in hell
Try to be free; you're nobody's slave
In the end death wins the game
Poison in your veins commanding your brain,
You must be so strong

Demon's child, infant of evil
Demon's child, ruler of madness
Demon's child, longing for my soul
Demon's child and I will defeat you, demon's child
