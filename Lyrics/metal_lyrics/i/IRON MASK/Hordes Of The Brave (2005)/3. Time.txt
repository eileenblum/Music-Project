I was born in a winter's night
Now it seems it's so far away
And I scream like a lion roars, bringing my love to life
Born a rebel, Born of fire, forever wild. Forever free
And I scream for my passion(s), defending them so hard
Is it the end of the road? No one can stop me now
Years are passing so fast but I will dare till the end

Time, time to live your life
Before the night falls, before we die
Now it's time (choir time).
Time to live your life
Before the night falls, before we die

The hourglass of the damned waits
Showing that our time is short
I live for love; I want to be strong.
Alone in this dark world
No wasted years, no time to loose
I feel the need buried deep within
In a mysterious life we survive. Forever lost in doubt

Is it the end of the road? No one can stop me now
Years are passing so fast but I will dare till the end

Time, time to live your life
Before the night falls, before we die
Now it's time (choir-time).
Time to live your life
Before the night falls, before we die
