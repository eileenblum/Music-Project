The night begins to fall and I'm looking to the sky
I cannot see what I feel but I get it in my heart
Emptiness of our lives, I believe in what I am
A reason to live in this world could be my request
Infinite universe, Infinite dreamers
Suffering eternally can we find a better world?

I want to fly beyond the stars;
I want to find another sun
Transcending shadows of my mind,
I want to fly beyond the gates of god
The invisible empire
Far beyond the stars, you'll feel the invisible fire
Far beyond the stars, you'll feel the invisible empire

I believe in something we will never understand
Do we control our fate? Or are we just his toys?
Could you imagine where it starts and where it ends?
Eternal silence, cosmic visions in my sleep
Infinite universe. Infinite dreamers
Suffering eternally, can we find a better world?

I want to fly beyond the stars;
I want to find another sun
Transcending shadows of my mind,
I want to fly beyond the gates of god
The invisible empire
Far beyond the stars, you'll feel the invisible fire
Far beyond the stars, you'll feel the invisible empire
