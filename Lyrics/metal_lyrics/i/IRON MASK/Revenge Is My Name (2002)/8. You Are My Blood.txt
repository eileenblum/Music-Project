I dedicate this song to my son Anthony Petrossi.
I love you so much!

A star was born in the dead of night
An angel came from heaven, pure as the lamb
The snow was falling, we'll never forget this day
Now you're growing up, destiny of a king
The child will be a man
Take my life, your soul is my soul
You're my precious gift, father's love will never die
After darkness, a new day will rise
Forever in my heart
You are my blood, my soul and my child
You are a miracle of life
Stronger than eternal love
You are my blood, my soul and my child
You are a miracle of love, you are my son
In the sky, I saw the sacred sign
Life is hard, you'll have to be the strongest one
Try to believe, greatly in yourself
Life's not a game, you'll need to win this endless war
And fight until the end
Take my hand, you are my promised land
In your eyes, I can see the holy light
Proud and glorious, your throne you will find
Forever in my heart
You are my blood, my soul and my child
You are a miracle of life
Stronger than eternal love
You are my blood, my soul and my child
You are a miracle of love, you are my son
