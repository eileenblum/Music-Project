Spaceships, galactic hordes of war
Reaching for the light of a brave new sun
Alien nation in the sky, unknown dimension,
Mysterious twilight
In the night they spy on the world we live
In their eyes, the thirst of victory
Will we die, do they bring war or peace?
End of time, my visions will fulfill
Alien, alien pharaoh
Coming from beyond the stars
They don't need to talk, we know their thoughts
Manipulating our brain and mind
No fear in their heart, no more hope
Annihilation is their final goal
Human cries, innocence of the child
Pray your gods, now we will have to fight
Aliens rise, we will defend our blood
Black or white, understand we are all the same
Alien, alien pharaoh
Coming from (far) beyond the stars
