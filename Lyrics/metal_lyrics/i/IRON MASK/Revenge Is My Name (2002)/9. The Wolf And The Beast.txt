I now will tell you a story, the tell of a man and his fear
It was in the heart of a forest,
In a land ruled by spells and crimes, he said:
Ooh, Lord give me strength to survive.
Hunters of the night are keeping watch over me
Ooh, Lord, trapped by the kiss of death
I become the Wolf and the Beast
Carpathian wolf, Transylvania's beast
Forgotten by the Lord, hidden in the shadows and mist
And now my dreams are visions,
(the) hand of evil commands
There's no more light in my life.
The Reign of terror has come
Ooh God give me strength to resist
How can I kill the girl that I truly loved
Ooh, God my thirst is burning me
I will take her blood and her soul
Carpathian wolf, Transylvania's beast
Forgotten by the Lord, hidden in the shadows and mist
In the night, l slay a thousand times
Shadows of my victims will haunt me forever
I feel remorse, I know my time has come
They will take my soul and my blood
Carpathian wolf, Transylvania's beast
Forgotten by the Lord, hidden in the shadows and mist
