Another door is there, another way
To find the destiny of my life
You've got to understand
That life is just a hard reality
We pay the price.
Let me dream of a brave new world
Let me dream of a heart without fear
I don't wanna be prisoner
I will break this masquerade of life
Now, I can feel free.
Hold the light, dance into the fire
Hold the light we will fly much higher
Hold the light, dance into the fire
Hold the light we will fly much higher
Another chance to win, believe in yourself
Just try to stay alive and you'll be so proud
You've got to find the key
And try to realize that the other side
Will be so nice.
Let us dream of a brave new world
Let us dream of a heart without fear
We don't wanna be prisoners
We will break this masquerade of life
Now we can feel free.
Hold the light, dance into the fire
Hold the light we will fly much higher
We will break this masquerade of life
Now we can feel free.
Hold the light, dance into the fire
Hold the light we will fly much higher
