Follow my glorious ride, children of sorrow
Army of braves, vengeance will be our quest
Fighting for honour, die for your sons
And the light will always be our pride
Demon's eyes will never bright
I will find you, I'll spit on your grave
Revenge is my name, Revenge is my name
Killing this evil reign, Revenge is my name
Running through fire, running for cover
Into enemy lines
I am the predator, you've gone too far
Now you will pay the price
Do you think you are the chosen one?
King of chaos, king of straw
I will catch you and you'll taste my blade
Revenge is my name, Revenge is my name
Killing this evil reign, Revenge is my name
Face my anger, face the truth
King of chaos, king of lies
I will kill you, I spit on your grave
Revenge is my name, Revenge is my name
Killing this evil reign, Revenge is my name
