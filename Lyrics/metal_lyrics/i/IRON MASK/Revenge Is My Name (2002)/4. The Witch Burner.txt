The ritual begins, the rite is the taw
No escape, her magic is much too strong
Now is the time to welcome the night
The moon is bright, she needs to sacrifice your son
Run, I'm the hunter, the witch burner
Burn, I'm the hunter, the witch burner
Run, I'm the hunter, the witch burner
Burn, I'm the hunter, the witch burner
My sword will avenge her crimes
She'll be back in hell
My wisdom will break down her spell
The night of the witch, glory of death
Your soul is black, poison is your blood
Darkness of your mind.
You're the child of the damned
You try to possess my heart and my soul
I will show no mercy, could you pray for your death
Run, I'm the hunter, the witch burner
Burn, I'm the hunter, the witch burner
Run, I'm the hunter, the witch burner
Burn, I'm the hunter, the witch burner
My sword will avenge her crimes
She'll be back in hell
My wisdom will break down her spell
The night of the witch, glory of death
