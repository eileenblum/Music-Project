After seven bloody years of war
Mercenaries enforce the law
We will search for the kingdom's crown
Only a few people know the truth:
With a rebel heart we'll rise
We will search for the dragon's throne
Breaking the chains of misery,
Killing this life of agony
They will taste the power of our steel
No one can't stop my destiny, eternal glory
Holy march of victory
Under the spell of the magic rose
Under the spell of my magic stone
Liars will die, heaven guides my soul
Victorious poison, beware of my black rose
March of victory, black rose's spell
In the rage of the battlefields
We are hunting the shadow's king
See their face with the demon's horns
Half of a human, half of a beast,
Invasion of the damned
We have to burn the evil's den
Beyond the gate of the golden sea,
We have to find the promised land
I will be the master of my dreams
No one can't stop my destiny, eternal glory
Holy march of victory
Under the spell of the magic rose
Under the spell of my magic stone
Liars will die, heaven guides my soul
Victorious poison, beware of my black rose
March of victory, black rose's spell
Breaking the chains of misery,
Killing this life of agony
I will be the master of my dreams
No one can't stop my destiny, eternal glory
Holy march of victory
Under the spell of the magic rose
Under the spell of my magic stone
Liars will die, heaven guides my soul
Victorious poison, beware of my black rose
March of victory, black rose's spell
