Impulses swirl downward
Give birth to speculation
Dark matter, transforming
Becomes determination

Time and history was never meant to be
After the bang, it will re-collapse again
Time and history was never meant to be
After the bang (bang), it will re-collapse again

Mystic forces of creation
Left behind a curse
A superhuman constellation
Called the universe, called the universe

So many dimensions
No man could ever count
Entropy observers
Are still constantly astound

Time and history was never meant to be
After the bang, it will re-collapse again
Time and history was never meant to be
After the big bang (bang), it will re-collapse again
Mystic forces of creation
Left behind a curse
A superhuman constellation
Called the universe, called the universe
Time and history was never meant to be
After the bang, it will re-collapse again

Mystic forces of creation
Left behind a curse
A superhuman constellation
Called the universe, called the universe

Called the universe
