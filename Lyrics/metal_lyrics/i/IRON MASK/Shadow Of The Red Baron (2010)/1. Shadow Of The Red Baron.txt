The air battle stages in front of my plane
A combat of squadrons
With led bursting guns I'm in for heaven's destruction
The sun in my back and the target below
My tactic's a nose-dive
I fire at will - them bullets granting reduction

Airborne I am, out in the skies
Up and down I cut the clouds
Courage has wings, see how it flies
Only one thing gives me doubts

Phantom striker, shadow of the Red Baron
Heightbound hiker dying all alone
Shadow of the Red Baron
Shadow of the Red Baron

A legion of eagles we're looking for kills
Well practiced manoeuvres
The prevailing wind allows a swifter attacking
I'm fully aware of the risk which I take
I hope that I meet him
The best of us all - is gonna bleed for the wrecking

Airborne again, out in the skies
Up and down I cut the clouds
Courage has wings, see how it flies
Only one thought gives me doubts

Phantom striker, shadow of the Red Baron
Heightbound hiker, dying all alone
Shadow of the Red Baron
Shadow of the Red Baron

Yeah!

Airborne again, out in the skies
Only one thing gives me doubts

Phantom striker, shadow of the Red Baron
Heightbound hiker, dying all alone

Shadow of the Red Baron
Shadow of the Red Baron
Yeah!
