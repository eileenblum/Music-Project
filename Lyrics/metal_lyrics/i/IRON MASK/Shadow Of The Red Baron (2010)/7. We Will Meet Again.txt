Time to say goodbye
Time for letting go
All the tears I cry
Cannot bring you back
Depression comes slowly
Aware of thoughts unholy
Salvation, I pray for
Down on my knees I pledge allegiance (so help me God)

We will meet again
Somewhere in the other world
You gave me life but how you're gone and I've to carry on
We will meet again
Someday on the other side
Death can't do us part we'll re-unite

Silent is the room
Silent is my heart
Bitter hours loom
Things remain unsaid

Repression comes slowly
Won't care for thoughts unholy
Sensation, excites me
Down on my knees I pledge allegiance (so help me god)
We will meet again
Somewhere in the other world
You gave me life but now you're gone and I've to carry on
We will meet again
Someday on the other side
Death can't do us part we'll re-unite

Yeah, we will meet again
Somewhere in the other world
You gave me life but now you're gone and I've to carry on
We will meet again
Someday on the other side
Deaths can't do us part we'll re-unite
We re-unite, yeah, on the other side
We re-unite, yeah, on the other side
Yes, we will!
