Cthulhu, unnatural
Prodigious claws attacking
Belial, chimeras
That shall not bridge abysses
Amorphous confusion
Absurdly grotesque angles
Colossal and monstrous
- Blasphemy with glaring eyes.

Ah...
Hail thy resurrection
Legend rising from the ashes

Quiet shocking these night-gaunts
Unpleasant horns curved inward
The dagons and deep ones
The dark shades of expression
Amidst them sheer horrors
Dwell those who have no name
Things elder, membraneous
- Malignancy with bloodshot eyes

Ah...
Hail thy resurrection
Legend rising from the ashes

Ah...
"T is not dead that which
Can eternal lie,
But yet with strange aeons
Even death may die"

Hail thy resurrection.
Legend rising from the ashes
Hail thy resurrection
Legend rising from the ashes
