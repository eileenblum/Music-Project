Summer spells passed by
Winter spreading out
No matter how I try I fail
Without a ray of hope
Warmth turning to cold
I have to cope with this great loss

For my angel is gone
My angel is gone, my angel is gone
My angel is gone

Mother, lady, saint
(The) rock on which I built
Walls came right tumbling down on me
You made that little boy
The man I am today
Though not with joy I say farewell

For my angel is gone
My angel is gone, my angel is gone
My passionate one
My angel is gone

My angel is gone
My angel is gone
My angel is gone
My angel is gone
My angel is gone
