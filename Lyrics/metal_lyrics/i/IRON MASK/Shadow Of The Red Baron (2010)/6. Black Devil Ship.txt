Lost at sea, no homelands
Rain comes down, night close at hand
Mariners, unsaved souls
Caught between hull, spars, and bolts

Due south or north, east and west
On searching the way to ol' Davy's own chest

Through the storm, lightning hits
Oceans deep, bottomless pits
Bloodred moon, starsea skies
Bowknot tied the pirate flag flies

Due south or north, east and west
On searching the way to ol' Davy's own chest

From the mastheads to keel
She's a vessel surreal
It's one hell of a trip
On the black devil ship, aye!

From the mastheads to keel
She's a vessel surreal
It's one hell of a trip
On the black devil ship
From the mastheads to keel
She's a vessel surreal
It's one hell of a trip
On the black devil ship, aye!

Aye!
