Romeo and Juliet
A love affair to wake the dead
Prince charming with a mandolin
So beautiful, a perfect scene
Once upon, nowadays
The turn of time knows many ways
If we had done what lovers do
I would not wish to start anew

Dreams come crawling out
Seems like losing ground

In my dreams, it's you and I
We are face to face and side by side
One sacred night
In my dreams, I realize
We will have to wait for paradise
One sacred night

Paris stole thee Helena
It caused a war with all Sparta
They found a trick to loot his town
Then mighty Troy was burning down
Once upon, now and here
A slightly different atmosphere
With pounding heart yet gone for good
I want to do what lovers should

Dreams come crawling out
Seems like losing ground

In my dreams, it's you and I
We are face to face and side by side
One sacred night
In my dreams I realize
We will have to wait for paradise

One sacred night
One sacred night
In my dreams, it's you and I
We are face to face and side by side
One sacred night
In my dreams, I realize
We will have to wait for paradise
One sacred night
