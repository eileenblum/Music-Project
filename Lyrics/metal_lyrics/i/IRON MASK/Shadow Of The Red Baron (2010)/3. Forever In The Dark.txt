Vivos voco, mortuos plango
Fulgura frango, oho-oho-oho
Vivos voco, mortuos plango
Fulgura frango, oho-oho-oho

Do you believe in heaven
Deliverance and forgiveness
The christening holy water
(Is) freezing when saviours falter

Forever in the dark, forever in a world as cold as ice
Forever in the darkness
Forever in a world of pain and cries
I'm forever in the dark, ooh yeah (I'm forever in the dark)

Vivos voco, mortuos plango
Fulgura frango, oho-oho-oho
Vivos voco, mortuos plango
Fulgura frango, oho-oho-oho

Ready to meet the maker
Whenever he's keen to see me
A prodigal son of Eden
Returning the king of heathens

Forever in the dark, forever in a world as cold as ice
Forever in the darkness,
Forever in a world of pain and cries
I'm forever in the dark, forever in the dark, ooh yeah,

Forever in the dark
Ooh yeah yeah
Forever in the dark, forever in a world as cold as ice
Forever in the darkness,
Forever in a world of pain and cries
I'm forever in the dark, forever in the dark, ooh yeah
Forever, forever in the dark
