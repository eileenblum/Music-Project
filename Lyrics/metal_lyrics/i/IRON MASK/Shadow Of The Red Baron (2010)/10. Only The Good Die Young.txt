With my own eyes I saw the purity lie bleeding
With my bare hands I touched the innocence itself
Since darkness falls
The threatening shadows keep on rising
How can I stop that cycle
(I'm) just a humble servant of the Lord

Only the good die young, the evil live forever
Only the good die young, the evil live forever
Only the good die young

One day, I trust, then I will really understand it
One day however there might be peace of mind agreed
In roaring silence we pretend to listen closely
So all we hear is but a whisper in the hurricane of sound

Only the good die young, the evil live forever
Only the good die young, the evil live forever
Oh, only the good die young

Since darkness falls
The threatening shadows keep on rising
So all we hear is but a whisper in the hurricane of sound

Only the good die young, the evil live forever
Only the good die young, the evil live forever
Only the good die young (only the good die young)
Darkness falling, death is calling, purity lies bleeding
Shadows rising, evilizing
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
