A goodbye I can't believe
Taken away too soon from me
You stand in my heart and soul
Love is stronger than death

You were my father, my best friend
But you left without farewell
I just hope it's not the end
Do you feel my endless pain?
Only memories remain

One day I can't forget
You were so lonely, I've been so late
You stay my father, my best friend
In Heaven, we'll all meet again

You were my father, my best friend
But you left without farewell
I just hope it's not the end
Do you feel my endless pain?
Only memories remain
