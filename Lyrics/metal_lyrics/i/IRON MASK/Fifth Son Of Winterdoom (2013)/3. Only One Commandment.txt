In this world of madness
Where sharks and predators rule
We have to be united
We'll never kneel to anyone

Only one commandment
Burning every book of rules
Listen to your heart and soul
Only one commandment
Go against the crowd of fools
Listen to your heart and soul

Raise your fist, we stand strong
Every nations, hear this wild call
Don't give in, claim your ground
We all carry the rebel flag

Only one commandment
Burning every book of rules
Listen to your heart and soul
Only one commandment
Go against the crowd of fools
Listen to your heart and soul
