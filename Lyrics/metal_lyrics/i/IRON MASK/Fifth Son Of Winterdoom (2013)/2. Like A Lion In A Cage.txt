Another time, another place
Where evil reigns
Killing and terror rules
The innocent always pay
I can't stand this world
No one seems to care
I wanna leave all this far behind
Is there a sense of honor/
Why don't we all live like brothers?

Like a lion in a cage
I just don't know who to praise
Like a lion in a cage
Nowhere to go, my silent rage
Like a lion in a cage!
Like a lion in, like a lion in
Like a lion in a cage!

I will prevail, the iron bars won't hold me back
Victorious, I'll break free out of my mental jail
We are born alone, as we'll die alone
Only the strong will survive
But hold the weakest's hand
Why don't we all live like equals?

Like a lion in a cage
I just don't know who to praise
Like a lion in a cage
Nowhere to go, my silent rage
Like a lion in a cage!
Like a lion in, like a lion in
Like a lion in a cage!

I can't stand this world
No one seems to care
I wanna leave all this far behind
Is there a sense of honor?
Why don't we all live like brothers?

Like a lion in a cage
I just don't know who to praise
Like a lion in a cage
Nowhere to go, my silent rage
Like a lion in a cage
Nothing seems to cure my pain
Though my roars are real
I'm a wounded beast with scars that never heal
Like a lion in, like a lion in, like a lion in a cage!
Lion in a cage!
