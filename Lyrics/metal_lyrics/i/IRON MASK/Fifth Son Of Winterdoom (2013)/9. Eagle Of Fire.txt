When the sadness invades your heart
Always listen to your inner voice
When the pain tries to rule your soul
Let no one steal your precious goal
Forget and forgive and reach for the sky
Destroy all your fears to unchain your mind

Fly with the eagle of fire
Reaching through clouds and the storm
Rise as the eagle of fire
And watch the world from above
Reaching for better and more

When you feel weak and lonely
Let no one bring you down
Don't be scared to get burned
Dare to dive, you're invincible
Release yourself from regrets and guilt
Believe in your strength to fulfill your dreams

Fly with the eagle of fire
Racing through clouds and the storm
Rise as the eagle of fire
And watch the world from above
Reaching for better and more
