Coming from the hill
A farmer looks for help
He needs warriors, he seeks a valiant soul
Only one man heard his call
They will find six other brave samurai

They come to help, teaching art of war
Battle for honor, protecting lords
They come to fight and to set them free
Marauding bandits will know defeat
Seven Samurai

Training paysans to kill enemies
Rising wall of spears to defend their life
Fortifications block the strike
Many assailants die while crossing the moats

They come to help, teaching art of war
Battle for honor, protecting lords
They come to fight and to set them free
Marauding bandits will know defeat
Seven Samurai

Now, the village is free, fearless and proud
Robbers perished in the flames of revenge!

They come to help, teaching art of war
Battle for honor, protecting lords
They come to fight and to set them free
Marauding bandits will know defeat
Seven Samurai
