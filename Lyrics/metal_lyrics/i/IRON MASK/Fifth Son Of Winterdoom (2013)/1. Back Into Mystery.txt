Do you believe in a life after death?
Is there a hope in the dark?
Do you believe that we'll all meet again?
Reaching the skies of a brave new world
Silence and pain
Silent sadness

Back into mystery, back in the origin of life
No more pain, no more cries
Now, he's back in the angel's arms

My destiny was to open that door
My destiny is to suffer much more
Facing reality, facing the truth
One day I'll never forget
Silence and pain
Silent sadness

Back into mystery, back in the origin of life
No more pain, no more cries
Now, he's back in the angel's arms
