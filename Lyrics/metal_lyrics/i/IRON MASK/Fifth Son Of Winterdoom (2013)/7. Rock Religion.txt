Open your eyes, don't trust what they preach
God never wrote, any human books
You have to believe in the strength of our soul
No one can steal your fate and dreams
We are born to rock this world, we are children of the night
With an iron heart we'll fight, with a rebel yell, we're proud!

No prophets, no leaders
Escape from the illusions
No more lies, one nation
Follow my rock religion!

Walk your crusade, lead your own life
Don't be afraid, to be part of the dark
They don't decide what is wrong what is right
We'll blow them away with this powerful sound
We are born to rock this world, we are children of the night
With an iron heart we'll fight, with a rebel yell, we'll rise!

No prophets, no leaders
Escape form the illusions
No more lies, one nation
Follow my rock religion!
