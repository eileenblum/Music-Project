A pretty girl, the sweetest face you've ever seen
You thought you dream but that's in fact your worst nightmare
The poison's in her veins, on your soul she will feed
Don't listen to this siren's chant
No mercy till she brings you down!

Angel eyes, demon soul
Beauty but beast inside
Angel eyes, demon soul
Behind the mask, the perfect traitor

Vicious words, that gorgeous smile fools the world
She plays with you like a puppet, you will lose your mind
Don't look into her angel eyes, her heart is just a piece of ice
Don't listen to this mermaid's cries
She'll kick you once you're on the ground

Angel eyes, demon soul
Beauty but beast inside
Angel eyes, demon soul
Behind the mask, the perfect traitor
