Glory and honor for God and country
Jesus saves, I keep faith
For my country and the crown, with the blade in my hand
I will lead the reconquest
Driven by the prophecy
Victory at Covadonga!
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Reconquista, Reconquista, Reconquista
In the name of God and my Holy Land
Reconquista, Reconquista, Reconquista
In the name of God and my Holy Spain
Hail, hail, hail Reconquista
Hail, hail, hail, reconquer
Hail, hail, hail Reconquista
Hail, hail, hail, reconquer

Glory and honor for God and country
Middle ages, darkest tales
Christian kingdoms reconquered
Jesus saves, I will pray
All invaders must be out!
We will never pay again
For the right to believe in our own Lord

Reconquista, Reconquista, Reconquista
In the name of God and my Holy Land
Reconquista, Reconquista, Reconquista
In the name of God and my Holy Spain
Hail, hail, hail Reconquista
Hail, hail, hail, reconquer
Hail, hail, hail Reconquista
Hail, hail, hail, reconquer
