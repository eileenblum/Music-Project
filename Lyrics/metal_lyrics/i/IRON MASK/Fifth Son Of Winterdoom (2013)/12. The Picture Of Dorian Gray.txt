The mirror shows a beautiful good man
He has the power to seduce everyone
He made his cruel own world based on deceit
One stroke of his hand removes all innocence
But the picture is the evidence of his dreadful crimes and sin
The day Basil introduces him to the maleficent Lord Henry
He forever changed his way to live never ending pleasures and lust
Dark is the soul of that decadent man, don't ever meet this Devil's son

He will live forevermore, he will stay forever young
The painting shows his hidden face
A portrait of a tortured man
He will live forevermore
He will stay forever young
One last kill could end this game
Dorian's soul is doomed to Hell

He has to face Sybil's brother's avenge
No one can kill him, poor James ends up dead
But the man in the picture grows more and more hideous and old
Dorian stays the same, unchanged, nothing haunts him, no regrets
Basil saw the horrible truth, asking Grey to pray for forgiveness
In response, Dorian murders him, dark is the fate of that wicked man

He will live forevermore, he will stay forever young
The painting shows his hidden face
A portrait of a tortured man
He will live forevermore
He will stay forever young
One last kill could end this game
Dorian's soul is doomed to Hell

He resolves to amend his life but he can't confess his crimes
In a fury, he picked up a knife to destroy his evil painting
The servants found the portrait, unharmed, showing Dorian as a young lad
And an old ugly rotten man with the knife plunged into his heart

He won't live forevermore, he won't stay forever young
The painting showed his hidden face
A portrait of a tormented man
He won't live forevermore
He won't stay forever young
One last kill could break the curse
Dorian's soul is now in Hell.
