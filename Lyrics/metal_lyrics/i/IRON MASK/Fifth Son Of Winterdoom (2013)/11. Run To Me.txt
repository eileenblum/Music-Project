Feel the heat, feel the beat
Of a heart that slowly dies
Take my hand and follow my lead
Running wild, running free
Now it's time to say good bye
Come with me, you'll conquer the world
Do you fear the unknown?
Relief your thirsty soul
No matter what you've left
You have to break the spell

Run away, you've got to run away
Run to me, I am your destiny (Run to me)
Run away, you've got to run away
Run to me, forget your loneliness (Run away)

Spread your wings, fly away
till you find the promised land
Now it's time to fulfill your dreams
Trust (in) your fate, it's not too late
You and me are meant to be
No more tears, I'll be there for you
Do you fear the unknown?
Relief your thirsty soul
No matter what you've left
You have to break the spell

Run away, you've got to run away
Run to me, I am your destiny (Run to me)
Run away, you've got to run away
Run to me, forget your loneliness (Run away)
