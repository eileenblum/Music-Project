I won't give up, I still believe in my dreams
Do we deserve to suffer so many years?
Heaven can wait, there's yet a price to pay
I know Hell is here; I see your bloody tears
When you think you've lost it all, just hold on
When the sun no longer shines in your life
Keep the faith and try to climb the highest mountain

Feel the Fire, Feel the Fire
Keep the flame alive, don't ever let it die
Feel the Fire
Feel the Fire
Keep the flame alive, don't ever let it die
Feel the Fire, Feel the Fire
Feel the Fire!

I face my fate, unholy destiny
I face my pain, I saw the agony
Don't lose your mind, I promise you someday
Someone will break those chains around your neck
When you think you've lost it all, just hold on
When the sun no longer shines in your life
Keep the faith and try to climb the highest mountain

Feel the Fire, Feel the Fire
Keep the flame alive, don't ever let it die
Feel the Fire
Feel the Fire
Keep the flame alive, don't ever let it die
Feel the Fire, Feel the Fire
Feel the Fire!
