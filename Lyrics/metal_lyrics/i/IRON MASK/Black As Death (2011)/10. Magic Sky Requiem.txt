There's nothing we can do;
Life's too short, many have gone
This morning is the same, tomorrow never changes,
My pain is still burning in my heart

Oh, can you feel the Holy Sun?
Can you see the Holy Light?
Thousand millions miles from home
But I know you are with me
Oh, can you feel the Holy Light
Of a far and magic sky?
Thousand millions miles away
But your soul is here with me

There are only old memories
Time flies fast the ship is empty
All our loved ones, already on that side
Be our angels, the glow in the dark
We are missing everyone so much

Oh, can you feel the Holy Sun?
Can you see the Holy Light?
Thousand millions miles from home
But I know you are with me
Oh, can you feel the Holy Light
Of a far and magic sky?
Thousand millions miles away
But your soul is here with me
I know your soul is here ....
