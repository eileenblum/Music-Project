From Father to son, relate to me your past
You were a lonesome orphan child
No one is innocent, don't listen to their complaints
You left everything behind, just to find a better land

I'll heal your broken heart, I need you here by my side
Relieve your lonely soul, don't be a broken hero
.... broken hero

Like a little boy, I imagine your life
You survived poverty and war
You were seeking for justice and freedom
Facing the frontiers machine guns
You left all you loved behind just to find a better place

I'll heal your broken heart, I need you here by my side
Relieve your lonely soul, don't be a broken hero
.... broken hero
