Maledictio, Cito, Longe, Tarde
Anima Mortis, Abyssus Abyssum invocat

No matter if I pray, no matter if I cry
Black, I am black

Black as Death, fallen angel
You took my heart, you took my soul
Gone too soon, a part of me is now with her
I'm Black as Death, fallen angel
You took my heart, you took my soul
Gone too soon, a part of me's forever lost

Maledictio, Cito, Longe, Tarde
Anima Mortis, Abyssus Abyssum invocat

No matter if I bleed, no matter if I die
Black, my soul is black

Black as Death, fallen angel
You took my heart, you took my soul
Gone too soon, a part of me is now with her
I'm Black as Death, fallen angel
You took my heart, you took my soul
Gone too soon, a part of me's forever lost

Black, black, black

Black as Death, fallen angel
You took my heart, you took my soul
Gone too soon, a part of me is now with her
Black as Death, fallen angel
You took my heart, you took my soul
Gone too soon, a part of me's forever lost

Black, black, black as death
Black, black, black as death
