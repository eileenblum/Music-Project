Friday the 13th of October 1972
Air force flight 571, Andes disaster
Forced to a dangerous manoeuvre due to an inclement weather
This fatal move changed our fate forever
Dipping into the cloud while still over the mountains
The plane soon crashed on an unknown peak
Now, it's time to pray

Blizzard of Doom
Deadly Howling of the wind
In a land of Ice and Snow,
No one wants to die now but only few survive

Glacier of Tears
Deadly freezing of the Wind
Lost behind a misty wall
No one wants to die now but only few survive,
In the dead of night!
It's the spirit of the frost and cold
Blizzard of doom will get our soul
Blizzard of Doom, Blizzard of Doom

Faced with starvation, frostbites and dehydration
Another eight were killed by an avalanche
There's no more choice
We have to eat dead human flesh
Deceased passengers preserved in the Ice
Eyes burned by the sun
Aircraft parts to protect our eyes
After 11 days, the search is cancelled
Time to pray

Blizzard of Doom
Deadly Howling of the wind
In a land of Ice and Snow,
No one wants to die now but only few survive

Glacier of Tears
Deadly freezing of the Wind
Lost behind a misty wall
No one wants to die now but only few survive,
In the dead of night!
It's the spirit of the frost and cold
Blizzard of doom will get our soul
Blizzard of Doom, Blizzard of Doom

Oh oh oh Blizzard of Doom
Eyes burned by the sun
Aircraft parts to protect our eyes
After 11 days, the search is cancelled
