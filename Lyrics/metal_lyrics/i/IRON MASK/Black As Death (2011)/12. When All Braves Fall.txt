I left my home today
In foreign soil I'll land
Tears on my children's face
Will I see them again?
Alone my soul is crying
Alone my heart is dying
I try to live without you
It's just another day in hell

When All Braves Fall
Mainkind's madness
Where is your God?
We are all lost in the darkness

When all Braves Fall
In the line of fire
Is this worth to be a hero in the grave?
When every brave fall
When every brave fall

The time has come for me to fight the enemy
I will protect my nation and I'll free my country
I know we are all meant to die
How could I change my destiny?
I know my life will end in this eternal hell

When All Braves Fall
Mankind's madness
Where is your God?
We are all lost in the darkness
When all Braves Fall, in the line of fire
Is this worth to be a hero in the grave?
When every Brave Fall
When every Brave Fall
