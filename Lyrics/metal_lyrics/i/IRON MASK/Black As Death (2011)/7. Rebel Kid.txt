Just a child, a little boy...
A hell ride has begun
They looked at me, they think I'm bad;
A loner's born
Climb up the mountains, to reach the sky
I'm running wild, forever free
I was young, I was wild, just a lonely rebel child

No one ever understood what I feel in my heart

I was young, I was wild, just a lonely rebel child
And I won't regret the past and the mistakes of my life
I'm forever a Rebel Kid
The world has changed, the clouds are black
Can't see the light anymore
But I remember the true facts, I don't need their lies
I faced the fire, Nothing to lose
I'm running wild, Forever free

I was young, I was wild, just a lonely rebel child
No one ever understood what I feel in my heart
I was young, I was wild, just a lonely rebel child
And I won't regret the past and the mistakes of my life
I'm forever a Rebel Kid
