He is the undead you fear and you crave
In your dreams, the forbidden hand
Caressing your neck
Only a woman breaks his spell
He's the sin she has never confessed
He is the fire that warms and devours
Revealing himself in the night

Nosferatu, Nosferatu
Bloody Prince of the Dark
Nosferatu, Nosferatu
Symphony of horror
Nosferatu, Nosferatu
Who will stop you
Phantom of the night?!

He sailed cross the ocean to find his true love
The damned crew is dead
Vermin infested the hold
No God, nor holy light
To save her soul from the tomb
She gave herself to the master of doom
He sucked her life with a Kiss of death

Nosferatu, Nosferatu
Bloody Prince of the Dark
Nosferatu, Nosferatu
Symphony of horror
Nosferatu, Nosferatu
Who will stop you
Phantom of the night?!

Salve, Regina, Salve
Protect me, Virgin Mary
Salve, Regina, Salve
Protect me, Virgin Mary

Nosferatu, Phantom of the night
Nosferatu, who will stop you now?

Nosferatu, Nosferatu
Bloody Prince of the Dark
Nosferatu, Nosferatu
Phantom of the night
Nosferatu, Nosferatu
Symphony of horror
Nosferatu, Nosferatu
Who will stop you?
Phantom of the night!
