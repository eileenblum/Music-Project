Day after day, I can't believe you have gone
Night after night, I am trying to carry on
Silent crying and sufferings, I can't hide this anymore
All the love you gave me lives forevermore
But In this world I slowly die

Why should I still live without you?
Feels like all the light is gone
Now you're far and I'm so lonely
On this cold and frozen road
Heaven is your home

Time's not healing my pain
Nothing could relieve me
The rain of sadness is still falling on my life
I am praying for you
I must accept my destiny
All the good times we had are still in my heart
In this world I slowly die

Why should I still live without you?
Feels like all the light is gone
Now you're far and I'm so lonely
On this cold and frozen road
Heaven is your home
