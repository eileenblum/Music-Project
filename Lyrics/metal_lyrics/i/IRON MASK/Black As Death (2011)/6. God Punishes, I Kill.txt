Lacrimosa, Lacrimosa
Man of faith, on a mission divine
Ready to deliver the coup de grace
Inside the Louvre, my victim will die
But first the secret must be unveiled

Are we all sinners or are we all saints?
I see no reason to spare you, you're the Devil's mate

God Punishes, I am in command
And I will kill, till the last one will fall
God Punishes, I am in command
I have to kill, till the last one has fallen
God Punishes, I Kill

Holy Monk, assassin at night
I show no mercy, but I'll pray for your soul
A life of pain I will endure
For the cross I carry; no compromise
Are we all sinners or are we all saints?
I see no reason to spare you, you're the Devil's mate

[Repeat chorus]

Lacrimosa, Lacrimosa
Are we all sinners or are we all saints?
I see no reason to spare you, you're the Devil's mate

[Repeat chorus]
