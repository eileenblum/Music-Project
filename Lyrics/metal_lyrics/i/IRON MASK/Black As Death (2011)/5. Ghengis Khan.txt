Wild child
Born with a blood-clot in his fist
Lead us to the ends of the Earth and sea
Wild man
Born to be king, unite all tribes
Clansman, extend your lands
And your Mongols' Conquest

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Genghis Khan, Genghis Khan

Warriors, ruling the world
United in death
Nomads, on the path of the glorious reign

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Genghis Khan, Genghis Khan
