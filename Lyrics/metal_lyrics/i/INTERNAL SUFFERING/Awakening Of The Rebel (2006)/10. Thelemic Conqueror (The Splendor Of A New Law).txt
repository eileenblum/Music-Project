In search of the rightful orbit... a star in the universe!
The paths to... supreme knowledge!

HAD! THE MANIFESTATION... OF NUIT!

At the Gates of a New Aeon...

Representing the endless possibilities of the Universe... HADIT!
Strength, courage... RA-HOOR KHUIT!
Intense, extreme desires, behaviors... BABALON! THERION!
Contained energy... HOOR PAAR KRAAT!

Reaching the orbit through the vast universe... the infinite space!
Toward the accomplishment of the Great Work...

IT IS OUR WILL... THELEMA!!!

I'm the center of the Sphere, I'm the... SORCERER!
Giver of live, knowledge of me... KNOWLEDGE OF DEATH!

Wretched &amp; weak... stamped down &amp; crushed

Reaching the Splendor of a new Law...

I'm the THELEMIC CONQUEROR...
CONQUEROR!!!
