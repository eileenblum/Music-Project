Mighty serpent ... Bringer of wisdom
Torch carrier ... Enlightenment force!
TIPHERET... rising in the individual's heart
First rebel... ascending towards Godhead
Defying what stands against individual Phosphorus...

The infinite... possibility of existence!

Precursor of the full blaze of the noon-day sun...
Divine wisdom emerges!

Standing on the threshold of Dawn and Dusk...
Symbol of Thelemic power!

THE AWAKENER!
MORNING STAR!
RISE UP!
[X3]

Awakening before the others... longing for universal knowledge
I call ye forth! Fallen seraphim... ARISE!
Inhabiting on the subconscious levels of the mind... Daemonic atavisms!
Rising forth, ascending, evolving!

Supreme fountain of Astral Magick... red fiery Dragon!
Channeled and aligned with the minister of Hoor-paar-kraat:
Fully balanced... united to be complete!
Forgotten spirit, sunk deep within the subconscious... DA'ATH!!

THE UNIVERSE SHALL BE OURS...
AWAKE!

Thelemic individual... blessed unto myself
Enlightened to travel the path to knowledge... Faustian key!
Towards spiritual immortality... self-godhood!
The time has come ... the powers shall be mine!

THE AWAKENER!
MORNING STAR!
RISE UP!
