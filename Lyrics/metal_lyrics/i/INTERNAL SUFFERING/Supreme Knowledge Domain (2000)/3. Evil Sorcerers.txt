Race of men - somewhere east beyond the mountains - Evil Rites
Spoken in an unknown tongue - charms chanted on the tops of temple
Built to reach the deepest cavities of HADES - great delight at their shrines...
Of loathsomeness! - lands of farmers ravaged by evil spells

Scorched black by flame and burning embers that descend from the sky
The Sign that they have been there, where the earth is black and charred
And where nothing grows or lasts - fire comes from the heavens
Panic and terror among the people - terrible cries yelled upon their gods to appear...

"A sword appears in the sky... a signal to the Ancient Ones
That one of Theirs has escaped... entered into this World!

Great destruction of everything... fire rains from the spheres
Seas of blood spilled on the ground... powerful uprising of the Old Ones!"

IA!

Cults of Death - call them forth from the lands beyond Time
Comets in CAPRICORNUS - cults rejoice - spells increase
Comets in SIRIUS - Cult of the Dog - grows fat
Comets in DRACONIS - Cults of the Dragon - Rise up!
