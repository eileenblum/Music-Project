For they dwell beyond the Gate
They have to be summoned
When MARDUK's not watchful
And sleeps,
When he has no power
And the Great Bear hangs
From its tail...
TIAMAT_s restless!

Preparing the bowl of TIAMAT
The shattered bowl of the Sages
Then, the DUR of INDUR
The lost bowl

Summoning the FIRIK of GID
And the lady SHAKUGUKU
The Queen of the cauldron... ENKI's afraid!

Reciting the conjuration IA ADU EN I
And building the fire therein
Calling GBL when I dost
After his manner and form

Then, may I rise thine Dagger
Summoning the assistance of NINKHARSAG
The horned Queen NINKASZKI
And NINNGHIZHIDDA, the Queen of magic Wand

When I have accomplished this and the proper sacrifice is made
I call whichsoever of the offspring I mayest after opening the Gate

"I set the time of the closing of the Gate
And the return of the spirit therein
I remain there, waiting until the
Spirit comes back and the Gate gets closed..."

I Summon Thee, Ancient Ones!

HUMWAWA appears, Lord of abominations of the south winds
PAZUZU, his brother, Lord of all fevers and plagues, Dark Angel of the four wings
Calling upon AZAG-THOTH, he is Lord of Chaos, rendered sightless in the Battle
Worshipping CTHULHU, the Sleeping Lord, the very Fire of the Earth!

The times for the sacrifice are the same times as the sleeping of MARDUK

...When he joins with the Abominations of the sky, TIAMAT'll once more rule the earth!!!

Preparing the bowl of TIAMAT
The shattered bowl of the Sages
Then, the DUR of INDUR
The lost bowl

Summoning the FIRIK of GID
And the lady SHAKUGUKU
The Queen of the cauldron... ENKI's afraid!

Reciting the conjuration IA ADU EN I
And building the fire therein
Calling GBL when I dost
After his manner and form

Then, may I rise thine Dagger
Summoning the assistance of NINKHARSAG
The horned Queen NINKASZKI
And NINNGHIZHIDDA, the Queen of magic Wand

When I have accomplished this and the proper sacrifice is made
I call whichsoever of the offspring I mayest after opening the Gate
