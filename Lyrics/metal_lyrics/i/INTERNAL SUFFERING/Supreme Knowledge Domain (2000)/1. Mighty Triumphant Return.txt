The Ancient Ones wert...
The Ancient Ones art...
The Ancient Ones shall be...

The Ancient Ones wert...
The Ancient Ones art...
The Ancient Ones shall be...

Out of the earthly plane - They rule
They remain waiting to cross the big Gate

NYARLATHOTEP will pronounce the word...

The Great Old Ones shall rise
And CTHULHU with his legions
Will return to the earth
And his Kingdom shall last eternally...

At the beginning of time, in HAOSTOSH
They lied in absolute equilibrium
Until the first race of mortal men appeared...
They profaned and committed barbarous deeds
So the Gods punished them for the sacrilege...

HASTUR... the voice of the Ancient Ones - avenger and destructor
Who inhabits within the dark cosmic spaces said it...:

"The Old Ones will rule the World in all their magnificent splendour..."

Out of the earthly plane - They rule
They remain waiting to cross the big Gate

NYARLATHOTEP will pronounce the word...

The Great Old Ones shall rise
And CTHULHU with his legions
Will return to the earth
And his Kingdom shall last eternally...

Listen! Oh you mortals! The Great Sign!
Since men will render wild beings
And will blaspheme to those who destroyed them forever!!!

At the beginning of time, in HAOSTOSH
They lied in absolute equilibrium
Until the first race of mortal men appeared...
They profaned and committed barbarous deeds
So the Gods punished them for the sacrilege...
