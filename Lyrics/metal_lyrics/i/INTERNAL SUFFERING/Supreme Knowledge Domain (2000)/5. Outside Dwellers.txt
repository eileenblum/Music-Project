The hour was night... when the star called my attention
I hadn't seen it before... since it was covered by a large rug
Finally, I saw it was a star of five points of big size
Decorated with ornamental designs... kind of cabalistic drawing!

Then, I took a chalk and copied carefully the whole design
I sat within it and expected something to happened...
So I recalled invocation rituals but nothing took place...
...several minutes later I remembered the words and spoke them gravely...:

"PH'NGLUI MGLWINAFH CTHULHU R'LYEH WGAH'NAGL FHTAGN..."

Instantly, the most astonishing phenomenon occurred...:

"I found myself looking upon a nocturnal landscape...
...desert vegetation... sandy rocks... the place was spare-of caverns... snow capped mountains
...a landscape that couldn't have been found anywhere..."

Life seemed to be going on within this weird aliens world...

Rattlesnake crawling...
Sharp-eyed hawk soaring overhead...
The Gila monster!

In the meanwhile, bats came out of the caverns' mouth
... then, a kind of human being made its appearance...:

"Rough of skin - emaciated...
abnormally eyes and ears...
ribs showing through its skin..
Outside Dwellers!!!..."

Little by little an enormous creature appeared... at first a tentacle, then another - half a dozen!
An eldritch head showed dimly...:

Horror!...ghastly travesty head
Neckless body... mass of jelly flesh!

Horror!...ghastly travesty head
Neckless body... mass of jelly flesh!

"I realised the thing had a great perception
for it saw me from the beginning, fixed its eyes
upon me and began to move rapidly towards me
through the darkening landscape... total paralysis...
was this the ultimate illusion...?"
