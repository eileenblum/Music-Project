Upon the road whence no return, where bowls of clay are heaped upon the Altar
To the Land of Queen ERESHKIGAL, where sleeps the dread CTHULHU, I set forth!

NINNGHIZHIDDA! Serpent of the Deep! NINNGHIZHIDDA!
Horned Serpent of the Land of CUTHA...

NINNGHIZHIDDA! Plumed Serpent of the Black Earth
Open the Door that I may enter!

I will raise up the Dead! I will cause
The Dead to rise and devour the living...

Open the Gate!

[ERESHKIGAL:]
Go, watcher of the Gate. Go, NINNGHIZHIDDA, open the Gate!

[SORCERER:]
NETI! Loose the bolt from the hatch and let darkness fall upon me!
Dark waters... Rise and carry me to the Realms of the Night!

[WATCHER OF THE GATE:]
If that is thy will, I shall allow Thee to... Enter!...

...into the Darkly Shinning World where the ABSU lies in Dark Waters and CTHULHU sleeps and dreams,
the Abyss that lies beneath the World, reached by a descending Ladder that has Seven Steps,
reached by a descending Pathway that has Seven Gates, where is established
the Throne of the Most Evil and Fatal Force, for from the cavities of the World leaps forth the Evil Daemon!

Enter the Gate of the Dead!

I will raise up the Dead! I will cause
The Dead to rise and devour the living...

Open the Gate!

[ERESHKIGAL:]
Go, watcher of the Gate. Go, NINNGHIZHIDDA, open the Gate!

[SORCERER:]
NETI! Loose the bolt from the hatch and let darkness fall upon me!
Dark waters... Rise and carry me to the Realms of the Night!

[WATCHER OF THE GATE:]
If that is thy will, I shall allow Thee to... Enter!...
