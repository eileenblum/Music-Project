...I expect for the arrival of my beloved Fullmoon
She... who inspires me for my bloody battle
Against all my enemies

I trace the five pointed star,
The four elements symbol, the pentagram
And consume my ritual

I evoke the greatest NIFELHEIM deities
When HECATE lays in the heavenly sky

And summon my deepest thoughts in darkness
While I walk through the mystic fog

The Fullmoon Night is close,
The night of the Impaled

They shall be Impaled...
They shall be Impaled...
They shall be Impaled...!!!

"... and with his dark dress He came down riding on his black horse,
holding a fearsome mallet in his hands...

Heads - smashed without taking a breath
Nobody escaped - from the strength of his malevolent hatred

None christian race, children, women, or elder would run away from the sacrifice

Thousands - He shattered...

...their bodies would be prepared to be pierced by pointed stakes"

...In several Fullmoon nights I carried out my sacrifices. Today, they adorn the Valley of The Impaled...
