Several sliced bodies were found
at that house out of the village
for eight days they were there rotting
the intense smell put the neighbors on alert
astonished by the atrocious murders
investigations were ordered but after a long while
nothing was found so no actions were takenÂ 

That malign man
collector of antiques
dwelled in the house
he took possession
of a mystical, strange object,
which was stolen from the museum
it was a small box made of the finest wood
which had ancient Sumerian inscriptions on it,
the most terrible maledictions &amp; invocations.Â 

"Death shall come &amp; take apart the soul of
the one who possesses the box".Â 

Several sliced bodies were found

astonished by the atrocious murders
investigations were ordered but after a long while
nothing was found so no actions were takenÂ 

Macabre attitudes â Ancient Gods' orders.Â 

Aggressive Impulses â Lunatic Attacks
Distortioned Brain â At the edge of MadnessÂ 

Emaciated â Decrepit
His flesh was consumedÂ 

The man injected morphine to relieve his pain
then he drugged the servants
when they were sleeping,
stabbed 'em with a sharped knife
and tore their flesh apart
Immediately he sprayed hydrochloric acid
on them, sliced their bodies
&amp; slashed all the animalsÂ 

That malign man
collector of antiques
dwelled in the house
he took possession
of a mystical, strange object,
which was stolen from the museumÂ 

At the midnight he went out of the house
possessed by his madness
proceeded to spray gas all over his body
and laughing set himself on fireÂ
