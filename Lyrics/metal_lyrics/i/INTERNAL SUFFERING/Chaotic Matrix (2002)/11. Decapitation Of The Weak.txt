Fuckin' idiot believers
You deserve nothing
but to be killed unmercifully
All your non-existing idols
Are just the only thing
You have in your senseless livesÂ 

Fuckin' idiot believers
You deserve nothing
but to be killed unmercifully
All your non-existing idols
Are just the only thing
You have in your senseless livesÂ 

One by one â decapitated with our axes
All your weakness â finally exterminatedÂ 

There's no place for you here â die!
Your irrational existence â ends now!Â 

Decapitation of the weak â There'll be none left
Decapitation of the weak â cease to exist!Â 

Evil hordes, cutting off your heads
While vultures devour your putrid bodies
The time has come for your "Saviour"
Who happened to be just a fuckin' lie!Â 

Beg for your life â stupid servants of Christ
Kneel on your knees â bastards of the light
Decapitated slowly â infernal suffering
Ancient Ones â ready to take your soul apartÂ 

Decapitation of the weak â Brutality &amp; chaos rule
Decapitation of the weak â We shall reign supreme!Â 

Evil hordes, cutting off your heads
While vultures devour your putrid bodies
The time has come for your "Saviour"
Who happened to be just a fuckin' lie!
