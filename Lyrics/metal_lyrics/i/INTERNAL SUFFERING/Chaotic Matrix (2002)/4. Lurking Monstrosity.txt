Lying in the deepest oceans
Down in the abominable R'Lyeh
Hidden in green, swamped crypts
Stands crowned by a monolithÂ 

Shinning evil eyes â enormous white mass
Infernal beast of the depths
Anthropoid creature of darkness
Abnormal, menacing, pavorous presenceÂ 

Under the sea in its dwelling place
Waits impatient for his return
To lay waste all that crosses in its path
and rule the universe once moreÂ 

Bloody rituals â Human sacrifices
Offered to the malignant effigy of stoneÂ 

Emerging beneath black thunderous seas
To lead the oozing Babylon of elder daemons
Convocating the evil hordes
To restore the majestic ancient empireÂ 

Release of sinister figures from lightless stars
Hellfire's Dominion â Eternal DamnationÂ 

"Cthulhu Fhtagn", "Cthulhu Fthagn"Â 

Lying in the deepest oceans
Down in the abominable R'Lyeh
Hidden in green, swamped crypts
Stands crowned by a monolithÂ
