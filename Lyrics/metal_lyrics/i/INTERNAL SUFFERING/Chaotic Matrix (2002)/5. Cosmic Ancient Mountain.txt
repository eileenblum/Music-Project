KUR-GAL!... where earth and sky meet
An-Ki... the Universe... emerged from the primeval waters in the AbyssÂ 

AN...KI... United!Â 

Tree of Knowledge... Grow!
Climbing... attain Immortal Life!Â 

White crystal stretches... roots!
Toward the deep... central place of the Earth... surmounted by... the vault of
heaven!
Imprisoned in the Underworld by... INNANA!
Must pass... Neti!Â 

Entering the tunnel...spheres of the Tree!
Combating the Ruler of the Underworld and... Ereshkigal!
Oh!... rising into birth!
Upper world life returns to the... wasteland!Â 

Lords of the Trees... stand as twin pillars...
At the entrance of the Great Abyss... Gate of Eternity!
road of no-return... MASHU!Â 

Sun... Moon... Stars... all moved in an ordered and observable... Path!
Super human level of supreme overseers... kingdoms in the sky!
Man... powerless shadow standing in the heavy darkness... of Hell!
follow your death.... miserable reflection of the life on earth..
High virtues &amp; knowledge... only for us... the privileged onesÂ 

AN...KI... United!Â
