Defeaning hellish roars
Pounding blasting drums
Terrible inhuman yells
Relentless powerful attack
Outrageous evil horde
Paroxysm of aberration
Hybrid creatures emerging
Crawling, growling
Causing havoc, killing
&amp; exterminating all forms of life
Blood - Flowing all over the plain
Nature - Completely desolated
Believers - Brutally mutilated
Vultures - Disgorging their rotted corpses
Black force devastating
Everything that lays in its path
Bloody revenge of the
Mighty Ancient Ones
Human Race - Totally annihilated
Weak Ones - Crushed &amp; Destroyed
Elder Gods - Finally Dethroned
Chaos &amp; Destruction - Reign once more
