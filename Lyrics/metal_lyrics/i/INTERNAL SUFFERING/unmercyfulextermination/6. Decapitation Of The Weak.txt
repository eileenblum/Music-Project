Fuckin' idiot believers
You deserve nothing
but to be killed unmercifuly
All your non-existing idols
Are just the only thing
You have in your senseless lives
One by one - decapitated with our axes
All your weakness - finally exterminated
There's no place for you here - die!
Your irrational existence - ends now!
Decapitation of the weak - There'll be none left
Decapitation of the weak - cease to exist!
Evil hordes, cutting off your heads
While vultures devour your putrid bodies
The time has come for your "Saviour"
Who happened to be just a fuckin' lie!
Beg for your life - stupid servants of Christ
Kneel on your knees - bastards of the light
Decapitated slowly - infernal suffering
Ancient Ones - ready to take your soul apart
Decapitation of the weak - Brutality &amp; chaos rule
Decapitation of the weak - We shall reign supreme!
