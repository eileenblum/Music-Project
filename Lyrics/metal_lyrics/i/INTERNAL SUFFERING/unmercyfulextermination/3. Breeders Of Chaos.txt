The Ancient Ones emissaries are already here
Demons and Beasts have established
Strategic Places they've pointed out
In order to begin the Invasion
Battlefields have been built up
Where human beings lay hungry
Torture Places
In which their disgusting bodies
Are torn apart bloodly
Gas chambers were created
To annihilate thousands of people
Humanity have been enslaved
By the most evil minds
Lots of dead bodies
Became into reanimated beings
Used for sinister purposes
Sent to create violent battles
Where thousands of humans are skinned
Their heads decapitated - brains suctioned
Internal Organs dissected
Their principal objective is to
Exterminate the damned christian race
Extirpate it from its womb
And destroy its creator
