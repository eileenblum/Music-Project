The sun bleaches out of the horizon
I see stars in a crimson black
Fiery eyes of the monster I see in me
I know I have to win

The sound of the nature
You hear as the bird's clamor

Bringing down to the symphony of bliss
flowers bloom with a morning kiss

Rise ! Rise! My soldiers rise !
Rise! Rise! till The dried leaves fall
Rise! Rise ! feel the victory in you !
Rise ! Rise ! And all turns so evergreen
