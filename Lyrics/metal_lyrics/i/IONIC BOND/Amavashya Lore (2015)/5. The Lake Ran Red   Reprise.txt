It was so cold when the breeze froze me
I waited till the midnight came
The moon showed its somber beauty
Welcoming you from hell

You wore a blood soaked gown
I held the black rose, a resembling of your face
The perfume that you wore
Spellbound my or our desire

I saw the silhouette of her darkness
as the lake ran red and wild
I broke the thousand streams
and the night turned so vile

The wolves had started howling for me now
But I could not run anymore
I had to see you rise again
from the bed made of rock

I would call for the ravens
and they would fly, above the sky
wings recovered my body
as I, unearthed you

Fluorescence of my angel
come back to portray
the world where I live
recall me back, to life or death
