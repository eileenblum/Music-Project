Silent kill! A nationwide
A lullaby of matricide
Takeover takeover, overruled!
Corporeal punishment ensued

The klaxon deaf ears to blood
Riot strikes, in a flare
Under black we march
Smokes and gun powders in the air!

Hear me, I call you
I bring the tide of vengeance
I bring the bolts of power
Bequeath hatred and fear

[Chorus:]
(Doomsday knock at your door
Repentance nevermore ! )

Terrorize the city
bomb roads, blast thunders!
I am the bolts of Jove
I am the hell-fire !

I am bring the wrath of God
and you will run for lives
This is the Judgement Machine

Ready for impact

Kill !
Kill the killer
Murder!
Murder the murderer
Rape the rapist
Rule the ruler

Glory overthrown
with bolts of fucking power!
