[Alter-ego:]
let the parasite speak
out of the womb of sleep

[Narrator:]
The weak had been born when a darkness spawned
a brainchild of schizophrenic who was dispatched prototyped synthesized
the flux in cortex synapses fail and relapse
the dogma of sickness and remedy collapse

[Ghosts:]
Surgeon slowly burgeon chemical memories and electronic truth
What the fuck means all now.

[Narrator:]
nerves numb psychosis unleashed
a symptom of killing spree

[Alter-ego:]
Welcome to my hell.
silence endeavors climax
surgery is made to surgeon
fuck you I am the fluid

[Ghost:] blow your head with my bludgeon

[Patient:]
Death was before me
I had to cheat to survive
The bed and the chair was all that I feared

[Dying patient:]
Behind the bars of madness and lunacy
It was my life and this fucking fallacy

[Soul:]
I fly and fly away
out of the misery
extraterrestrial stories
and brainless melody

[Chorus:]
[Vengeful Soul:]
Raped and fucked in thresholds of time
whores and bastards in my breeding rhyme
fuck you are mine your death be like a swine
welcome to the hell of my cyborg mind.

[Demon:]
Raped and fucked in thresholds of time
Whores and bastards in my breeding rhyme.
Fuck you are mine your death be like a swine
Welcome to the hell of my cyborg mind.

[Me:] Motherfucker!
