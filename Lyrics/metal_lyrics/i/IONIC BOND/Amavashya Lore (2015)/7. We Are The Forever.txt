I knocked her door one day
She though I was her pizza man
But No I crashed and I crashed in so deep
Her young eyes were two galaxies to me

Death cannot do us apart
Eternity will be us
We are the Forever!

and I entitle you
The queen of my heart

We are the forever!
End is never to come

The Lake ran red and cold
who cares for it anymore?
The day has come with a new sun
My angel knocks at my door

Don't take my gravity of anger
I will rip out all the walls
between us if it does
dare to stand

Sweeter than the winter
A light in the dark
I morph myself to her
A newborn me arise

We are the forever
Forever and Ever
End is never to come
We are eternal!

We are the forever
End is never to come
Together as one
We burn the rest of the world
