Democratic law has bound the world in peace.
A peace of scattered deaths
On father's shoulder rise
The coffin of his child

Smiles and kites blurred,
into a air strike

Indecent government had to reveal
Innocent living beings in bigoted civil kill

Reach out to fight to rise from the ending days that are beneath veil of clockwork
Coming out of fear to win your land from torments that are done by the despot

Milhemat Sheshet Ha Ya Mim
Six days had plundered voice of the weak
A Thunder that torn
Asunder singular black flag
Again a sarcastic world
Peace sustained in stains

We see the fireworks in view of their night
But not of celebration which was a heinous genocide

Reach out to fight to rise from the ending days that are beneath veil of clockwork
Coming out of fear to win your land from torments that are done by the despot

This silence. Soothes. Away
As I had wondered what we are really fighting for.
Why humanity is ignored.
The children cry why don't you hear?
The ethereal watcher is here, why don't you fear?

we are the fallen,
in this world alone.
Reunite once again,
to crush the iron dome!
