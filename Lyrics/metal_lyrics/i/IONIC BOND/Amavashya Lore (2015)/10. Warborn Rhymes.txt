Days are drawing closer
Chariots galloping, marching horses
We are legions not of the darkness
We put the evil the in the harness

One of them was stung by our venom
Black lips annexed, served the klaxon which
slowly roars

Oh no the damned cant fight us
see arrows !

Looking at the dusty sky
And breaching as we fly
our ships are abandoned
as we fight with our souls

The king has lost his kingdom
countless might-fooled wisdom
in chase of his life
he plays the chess of lies

We were charged for the arson
Burning memories of foul and landlords
Strike the firestorm
Crowley damned and cursed to hell

Gates are open, resurrecting martyrs
of flesh and blood, skull and bones
covering them with shields and blades
Now they die for glory or be subdued

Holding the axe of war
I fight to defeat the evil one
Only one song that will be means to save the whole world
Till the end of war!
