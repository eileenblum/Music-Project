They wipe us out they rip us out
One by one in the dead of the night
Fight for the land fight with bare hands
The auctioned human rights are scorned
Defiance and resistance
Conspiracy fortified
They kill us one by one
and dance in the dark of the night

The ambivalence, a double perception
A massacre or a suicide mission

Searchlight kill on the night
Horrors of our motherland
History or mystery play
Obscure, oblivion

Searchlight kill!
Searchlight kill!

Idealists, leaders are erased
families were emptied
East and West this mutual blood shed
Truthful lies, textbooks are to be fed

Searchlight kill on the night
Horrors of our motherland
History or mystery play
Obscure, oblivion

The vultures are calling
They are heroes we were the might
The combing affect our treasures
In the dreadful night.
