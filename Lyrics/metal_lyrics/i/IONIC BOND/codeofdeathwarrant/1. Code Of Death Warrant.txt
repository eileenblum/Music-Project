I, can, feel, so, much pain
All the bloods are going out, through my vein
Vision, has, become, Blurry n deam
Skin is burning like I'm, in a laser beam;
Vultures, are, circling me, in the sky
I, can not stand, I, can not cry
God has chosen me to, enter hell
To, wake up Satan, ring his bell

[Pre-chorus:]
I've followed the code of death (code of death)
Risking my life having no faith

[Chorus:]
Death warrant, Is now, In my hand
Forcing Me, To Die, In the sand...

I'm, now, buried, in the sand
Late memory buried, holy land,
My, deeds have broken, my soul
Deadly consequences is, to call..
