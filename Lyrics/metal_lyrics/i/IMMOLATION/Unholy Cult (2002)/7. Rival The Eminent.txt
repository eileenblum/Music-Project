Not all of us choose to believe
Some of us choose to live
Not all of us follow so blindly
And accept all that we hear

Maybe you're not so smart
To look outside yourself
Maybe you've chosen unwisely
In the God you've made your own

I'll be my own leader
I'll be my own saviour
I'll be the strength that carries
I'll be the light that guides...me
I will make you see
Your devotion is in vain
I'll be the one left standing
When all of you are kneeling
And smiling, so content
I'll wipe the smiles off your faces

Don't you dare pity me
I've made my choice and I'll prove you wrong

My voice will thunder through the heavens
And my flames of hatred burn
I believe in me and only me
And I bow to no sovereign
