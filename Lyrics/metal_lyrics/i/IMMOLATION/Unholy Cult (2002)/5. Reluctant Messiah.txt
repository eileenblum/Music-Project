Reluctant messiah, show us the way
Don't let us down, we have no one left
Your unwillingness to prove, what we believe
The signs you won't leave, we still seem to find

Such distance between us, but we know you are here
We feel your presence, it guides us along
But why won't you answer or send us some hope
We'll just keep searching for what we know is there

Why has our day not yet come
We've sacrificed our fathers and sons
We spill blood but shed not a tear
Our anger grows, but so does our fear

Speak to us...
What have we done wrong
We just want to believe In something larger than life itself
Speak to us...
Let us know your voice
We just want you to see
Our faith is true
We just want you to see
Our faith is true

What more can we do...
He must feel our devotion
Will he know the righteous from the fallen...
Will he know we're the first in line
Save us from our fate...
Save us from our faith
