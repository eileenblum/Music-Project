The kingdom falls and with it goes the darkness of the world
It's malignant soul had burned so bright in the glory of it's day
Wars were fought in it's name and life was cast aside
So many lives were sacrificed to keep the kingdom strong

The kingdom falls and with it goes the shadow that it cast It's king alone,
to stand in shame, a symbol of the past
The pulse that beat for centuries had died out long ago
And now divided the people see the truth behind the show

Watch them scramble for cover
Watch them try to hold it together
Frantic to stop it's collapse
But change has finally come

Divided it will fall
It's fabric rips and tears
The beating of it's heart
Will never again be heard

Foundation built on the flesh of the past
Twisting it's purpose through years of neglect
Conflict of power, true soldiers are scarce
A kingdom divided will not stand

The kingdom falls and with it goes the arrogance it reeked The darkness
that was hidden deep now on the surface flows
Humbled now before the world it shows its ugly face
Tear this cancer from the world and purge it from our lives
