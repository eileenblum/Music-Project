I am the one
Leader of promise
Stalking lost souls
Rabid for the taste of faith

Pull you close to me
I will make you see
Spit my fears into your hearts
Feed your minds with my disease

I'll make them doubt themselves
I'll make you loathe yourself

I am the one
Creature of moves
Sending my pack out into the world
Those loyal to me grow like a plague

They'll bow in praise of me
They will be slaves to me
I will bring them to their knees
Devoured soul by soul

I'll make them fight for me
I'll make them die for me

You'll feed me your young and I take them with pride
I'll offer you some guilt and a lifetime of lies
Let me tease you with wonders and surround you with me
For I shall be your life, and your life shall be for me

I'm your world, I'm your light, I am all the answers you seek
You'll walk throughout your empty lives, but never challenge me
For I am god, I am every God, I'm whatever you wish of me
I'm the beast you've created, and I'm the beast you'll serve
