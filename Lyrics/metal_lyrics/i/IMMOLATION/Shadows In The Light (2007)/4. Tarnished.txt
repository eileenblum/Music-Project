Spoil the soul, Spoil the flesh
Inhaling sin to survive
Leaving grace behind

Feel the dirt under your skin
Feel the filth work it's way in

Long gone is the purity
Lust and indulgence thrive
Your heart's now black and dark

Feel the dirt under your skin
Feel the filth work it's way in
Feel the steel piercing your flesh
Feel the surge taking your breath
Feel the blood pump in your veins
Feel the rush that drives you insane

Fouled by your selfish ways, Fouled by your arrogant bliss
Fouled by the mistakes you've made, Fouled by the poison you take
Banished by the ones you loved, Banished by the ones you trust
Banished from your house of faith, Banished by the God you praised

You are the guilty
You are the shamed
You took the good
Threw it away
Destroyed your life
And those you've betrayed
You have been tarnished
A life now tarnished

Desperate now to cleanse your soul, Desperate now to save your soul
Fallen down you've lost control, Fallen down you've failed them all
Tortured by the envy that grows, Tortured by the anger that flows
Hurt is now all you will know, Hurt is now your only absolute

You are the guilty
You are the shamed
You took the good
Threw it away
Destroyed your life
And those you've betrayed
You have been tarnished
Forever tarnished
