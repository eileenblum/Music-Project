See what they've done
Imagine what's to come
Already inside
They've come to take it all away

Moving in shadows
Masking their rage
A violent breed
Bringing the world to it's knees
Deep in our soil
Spreading their seed
They'll never give in
Until we are all in our graves

Hiding among us
Harvesting death
Turmoil ensues
The world, runs frantic, with war

Building their walls, to entrap us all
Architects of ruin, imprisoning all

Spreading the fear, to further their cause
Messengers of light, crushing all

Waiting in shadows, for the time to strike,
Dormant empire, growing strong

Inch by inch, mile by mile
Silent legion, the world will fall

Don't close your eyes,
Or all will be lost, ...forever
