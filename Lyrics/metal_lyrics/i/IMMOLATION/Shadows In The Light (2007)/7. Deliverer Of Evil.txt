Shadow
Soldier
Silent
Predator

Take down the master
Take down the throne
Bring them their heads
Send a message to the world

Sinister
Warrior
Faceless
Killer

Take out the king
Take out the kingdom
Paralyze their power
Send a message to the world

Gave you the power
Gave you control
Fail the people
And you will fall

Faiths collide, social unrest
Clear the air, force the change
Dusk will bring the serpent's kiss
Never see another dawn

Take down the master
Take down the throne
Bring them their heads
Send a message to the world
