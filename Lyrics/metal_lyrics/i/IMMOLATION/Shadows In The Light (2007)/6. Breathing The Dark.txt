It lets no light in
It feeds on my pain
I try to feel something
Numbness is all that's left
With every breath
Another piece of me is gone
As if life is leaving me
Leaving nothing behind

Try to hold on
My spirit is gone
Panic runs through me
Fighting the suffering

It spites me
Entices me
It leads me on
Then crushes my dreams
It leaves me hollow
Pulling me deeper
It has no compassion
It wants full control

Try to hold on
My spirit is gone
Fighting to overcome
But every battle is lost

Breathe in the dark
It's all that's here
Breathe in the loss,
Awaken the fear
In this dark place
Tasting my tears
Ripping my mind
Now madness becomes me

Take this sickness away
It drains me, it aches me,
It pulls all hope from me
Like walls it surrounds me
It towers above me
Keeps drawing me in
Showing no love,
but loving my sin

Breathe in the dark
It's all that's here
Breathe in the loss
Awaken the fear
In this dark place
Tasting my tears
What once was is gone
Now misery becomes me
