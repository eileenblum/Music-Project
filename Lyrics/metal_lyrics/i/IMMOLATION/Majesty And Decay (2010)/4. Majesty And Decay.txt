A plague of madness will change the world
A gripping siege brings down the land
Worn away by years of conflict
Endless plains of crumbled stone

A vile disturbance will move us all
Its will is iron, a blackened soul
Innocent blood will fill its need
Watch you faith turn and flee

The rousing of giants, the suppressing of spirit
Majestic in presence, a guise to betray
Loosening the noose while tightening the chains
A race for victory, erase humanity

All you have is all you've taken
Crushed and silenced a people are broken
Maniacal vision is brought to life
March for victory, the beginning of the end

Mortal element corrodes
Thrown into the fires

Banners of hate for all to see
Massing hordes, command by fear
Menacing decree, inhuman state
Towering sorrow, choking every soul
