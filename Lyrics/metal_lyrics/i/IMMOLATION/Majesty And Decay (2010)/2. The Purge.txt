More and more, growing and growing
Spreading and spreading, taking and ruining
The cancer is growing, the cancer is spreading

Purge the world, remove them all
Purge the world, remove them all
Reaching out further, absorbing the earth
Ever expanding, never stop breeding
No room to move, no room to breath

Human scourge
Consuming it all
Filing ourselves
Soon there will be nothing left

Wipe us all out, it's what we deserve
Cleansing this planet from our disease
The world we've created is choking us all
Unchecked and rampant, wicked and vile

Purge the world...of our curse
Purge the land...of our mess
Take us out...with one swift blow
Take us down...with crushing force

Purge the world, remove us all
Purge the world, remove them all
Purge the world
