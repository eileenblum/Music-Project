Rank with hubris, scar the world
Watch the helpless weep and run in fear

Cast the fire, scorch the earth
Punish them and rip the ground away

Storm with vengeance, leveled plains
Leave them nothing and lay the land to waste

Force them out, a drastic act
Executing all even if their own will suffer

Winds of terror will crush their world
Flames of hatred shall shake their souls

We liken ourselves to Gods
Leaving lifeless regions of ruin
Generations before it all heals
We serve our time in hell
