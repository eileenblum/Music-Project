You've left me in the filth
You've left me here to die... Why

Look at how you've broken me
Can't you see what you have done
Is it the devil in you
Or just a selfish heart

So much loyality
But devotion had a price
I carried you, I held you up
But you tried to drag me down
All the fatal blows you've thrown at me
You rubbed it in my face
Now you are dead to me
Your death will set me free

Miles I've walked for you
But you've given not a step
Remember all I've done
How quickly we forget
You've taken me away
So far from who I was
And almost pulled my soul
Right out from under me

You've cast a thousand lashes
I never said a word
Another thousand lashes
Left me screaming at the world

Free
Now I'm free
You're dead to me
Now I'm free
