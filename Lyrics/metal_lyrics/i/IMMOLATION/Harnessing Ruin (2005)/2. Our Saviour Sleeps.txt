Child of promise
Where are you now
Our savior sleeps
Awake for us

Your miracles are needed now
Carry us out of harm's way if you can

His children weep
And cry his name
Our savior sleeps
Why won't he rise

Carry us as you said you would
Through the dark that clouds our world

We trusted you
But you did not come through
The suffering you left with us
Will torture our lives forever

Child of promise
Where are you now
Our savior sleeps
Eternal night

Carry us as you said you would
Through the dark that clouds our world
