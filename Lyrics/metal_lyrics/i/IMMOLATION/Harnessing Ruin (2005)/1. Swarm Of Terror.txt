Call us the Devil
But it's you who holds the darkest heart
Call the weak to arms
Savage words to your savage world

Abusing control... Menacing all

Call yourself the victim
But it's you who walks a vicious path
Call them to the mayhem
For you they'll lay down with the dead

Rabid conviction... uphold the threat

A swarm of terror
Across the land
Spreading sickness to curse the world

Punishing judgment
Will bring the end
Cast the nightmare to take down mankind

A swarm of terror
Across the land
Spreading sickness to curse the world
