Miles to suffer
So much before us
Confusion follows
Fills the air

The struggle ahead
Will change us all
Shock our conscious
Test our strengths

Walk through the fire
Force our steps
Weaken our hearts
With chilling screams of death

Death is creeping ar our backs
We dread to think what lies ahead
Hysteria exploding all around us
Flames that touch the sky
Numbing fear takes over
Prepare yourself, for the worst is yet to come

Cascading down like rain
Our blood, our hopes, our being

Learn to breathe
The agression in
It thrives in you
Must forge on
We believe
This must be done
Embracing madness
We must forge on
