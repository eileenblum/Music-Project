Feeding ourselves to the structure
Striving for all that is wrong
Crying for all the wrong reasons
Living without any souls

A sense of perversion surrounds us
Its crafted perception is fading
More obvious now is the threat
The writing is breaking the wall
Feel it all spiraling down

Slowly rising...
This ominous power...
Beast of deceit...
Creeping towards us
Ready to show its teeth

Kingdom of conspiracy
Knowledge now contained
Building up our weakness
Subduing us with awe

Watching us play their game
Watching our freedoms fade
A crescendo of unheeded cries
Now cries of the persecuted

Feel its presence expanding
Swirling gently around us
Looming like a predator
Its putrid maw will devour us all
No one but ourselves to blame
No one but ourselves to shame

Watching us all from above
Watching our freedoms sink
Branding us for life
It's all gone horribly wrong
