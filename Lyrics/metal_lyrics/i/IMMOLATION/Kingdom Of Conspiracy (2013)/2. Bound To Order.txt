ubiquitous and ever seeing
your every move, your every word
fear, dominance and control
enforcing the code on all
protection for the good of the land
sentinel of the righteous, commands
invade you to control you
no dissent will be allowed
obey, follow and conform
condemning those who oppose
opression for the good of the land
soldiers of the eminent descend
coralled and conteined like cattle
to feed this dispotic appetite
tagged and numbered, bound and tethered
now you'll never be out of our reach
fading glory, worn and vicious
guilty or not, they will all comply
submissive masses sterilized
move in lockstep to the beating of our drums
projecting comfort while administering terror
they take the bait while we take the prize
the order must be upheld
understand, with safety comes a heavy price
monitor you, rule you
your every move, your every word
fear, dominance and control
enforcing the code on all
protection for the good of the land
our iron rule now stands
