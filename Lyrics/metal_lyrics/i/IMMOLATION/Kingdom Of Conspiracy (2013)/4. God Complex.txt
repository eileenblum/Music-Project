sowing the seeds of extinction
replicating the natural order
pandemic scourge of humanity
now growing to its fruition
breeding disease and weakness
creating a world of dependence
planned for mass intake
ingesting the fruits of malignant design
man becomes god
manipulates life
poisons the world
cultivates death
mass genocide, human revenue
sprinkling misery into their bodys
feeding their hunger, feeds our agenda
don't ever let them know they're slowly dying
man becomes god
manipulates life
poisonst the world
no chance of survival
