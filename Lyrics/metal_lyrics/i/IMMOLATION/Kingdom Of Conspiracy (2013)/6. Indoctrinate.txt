Ready the youth 
For this culture of madness 
What a terrible time 
To be brought into this world 

Indoctrinated 
By a parasitic rhetoric 
Engineered to spread 
Like a fever amongst the innocent 

Make them see what you see 
Make them be what you are 
Indoctrination of the young 
Insures your cause will always thrive 

Catch them while they're young 
Embed your venomous sting 
This hidden abscessed splinter 
Leaking deep inside them 

Flowing through callow minds 
A soothing toxin of promises 
Altering their thoughts 
Infecting those within their reach 

Make them see what you see 
Make them be what you are 
Indoctrination of the young 
Insures your law will always thrive 

Bowing their heads in loyalty 
Bowing their heads in shame 
The rituals of conditioning 
Repeated, over and over 

Legions of disciples 
Soon legions of soldiers 
Innocent now 
A dormant threat waiting to mature 

A lifetime playing host 
To this lunacy 
Held fast 
By the barbs of faith 

Mad and blinded 
Beyond reason 
A haze of twisted morals 
Clings to them all 

Vessels for their war machine 
Vessels for their way of life 
This ravenous piracy 
Of human minds 
Designed to assure 
Our ultimate downfall 

The sadness of wasted life 
The sadness of silenced dreams 
Sorrow for these unwary victims 
Witness the loss of all identity 

Make them see what you see 
Make them be what you are 
Indoctrination of the young 
Insures your rule will always thrive
