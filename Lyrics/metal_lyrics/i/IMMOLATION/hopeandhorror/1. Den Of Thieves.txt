Twist what's right to make it wrong
Flip our minds, drag us along
Leach on our morals, lead us to pain
Then rob us of all you can

Bludgeon the masses, with propaganda
Stealing our sons, stealing our lives
Hungry for power, to battle they go
Fire in their eyes, and rage in their souls

Den of thieves
Rule with greed
Steal our faith
Watch us bleed

Keep us in the dark and blind
Steal the thunder and the night
Steal the power and our might
Leave us only scraps to find
Take and take it all like swine
Take our lives then own the world
Leave the weak and burn what's left
Then let them starve among the ashes

Conspire ways, to bring us hate
Spreading lies, like the devil's plague
Make their crusade, our world's fate
Death in their eyes, now blood on their souls

Den of thieves
Rule with greed
Steal our faith
Watch us bleed
