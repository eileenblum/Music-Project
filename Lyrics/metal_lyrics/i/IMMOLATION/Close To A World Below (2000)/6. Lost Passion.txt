Lay your hands...Your healing hands
Upon my flesh...My sinful flesh
And heal this soul...My tormented soul
For I am lost within this place
The light I've seen for my entire life
Won't guide my way...It's failing me
You're failing me...And soon I'll see
That with your death this passion dies
My devotion to you was complete
I've carried the weight of your cross
The burden of life presses me
These nails are in too deep
My passion suffocates me
Jesus you suffocate me
Help me down
From my cross
I'm dying here
My faith it fades
I've suffered long
My passion
Lost in prayer
I lost my soul
Lost my way
I followed you
you led me deep
Into despair
Where there was hope
Gloom was waiting
My devotion to you was complete
I've carried the weight of your cross
The burden of life presses me
These nails are in too deep
My passion suffocates me
Jesus you suffocate me
