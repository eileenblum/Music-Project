Bless me father
For you've sinned against me
It's been one week
since you've raped me
holy Father, your spirit inside me
Holy Father, robbed my virtue
Holy Mary, mother of Christ
The fruit of thy womb has poisoned me
Father, you're not a father
Rapist, selfish taker of youth
The fires you cast out
I promise you for eternity
Our father who aren't in heaven
Inside of me, my soul is lost
My manhood, so miniscule, was stolen
The Rosary has gripped tight around my neck
I hailed Mary...Over and over again
You've failed Mary
You've raped Mary...Over and over again
You've walked beside me, but I was alone
You've walked on top of me, crushing me
My innocence and my emotions
Were wiped away and you didn't care
You just hid behind your collar
The hardest time, I was helpless
And it was too late, much too late
Touch me I'm warm, but not alive
Feel my hot breath, but I'm not living
Dead inside, Alone forever
Father why...Father why
Father, you're not a father
Rapist, selfish taker of youth
The fires you cast out
I promise you for eternity
