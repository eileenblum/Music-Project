I know this is my chosen path
To believe in no one but me
I know this is my chosen path
You've always kept the promise
You've always kept the faith
Well I never will and never had to
I've sinned and sinned
I've sinned and I will again
According to your higher standards
For this I'll go to hell
You hypocrite, you never did
Your truths are lies
Your lies are so pathetic
I'll never give up my soul for you
I've sinned and sinned
I've sinned and I will again
To you I am darkness
To you I have no soul
The smoke from the flames
Will rise up forever
Put my hand in the fire
Put my head in the flames
I can believe
I know it hurts
My skin is melting
I know its real
My skin is melting
And it feels so right
To you I am darkness
To you I have no soul
the smoke from these flames
Will rise up forever
