Sky of fire... Ground of dust
Flames around me... Heaven has lost

A world of faith... Brought a world of hate
Lust for power... Brought a world its fate

Faith... Lust... War... Death

Bending our knees to your illusions of love
Breaking our hearts with your passion for ruin
Drawn into devotion, we never looked back
We vowed our lives to your promise of hope and glory

Pitted against ourselves
Determined for conflict
Campaigns of death
Cast into war for their visions of greatness
Our faulty convictions
Our towering judgments
Have brought towers of fire
Incinerating us all

I see it now
The lies have all been burned away
We've fallen our last time
Nothing left to save

Hate... Fire... Ash... Dust
