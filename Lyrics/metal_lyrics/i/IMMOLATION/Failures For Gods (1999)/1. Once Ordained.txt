A world in chaos, a people lost
Days of sorrow, days of bedlam
Anticipate it's coming, world upheaval
The darkness upon us, soon to come
At the coming of the dawn
No one hears our dying cries
Our somber vigils nevermore

From humble beginnings comes the one
To lead us blindly into the night
Obscure and prophetic, his rise to God
many will perish in the wake of this savior

As we near our final days
Will we see beyond the dark
Has our blood been shed in vain

You will all be fooled
You will all be fooled
When he reveals himself
When he reveals himself
You will all be fooled
You will all be fooled
He sees withing your hearts
He sees within your souls

A people divided
Turn on each other
No one shall rival
Our new found messiah

And all shall follow
And heed his calling
Ensure his reign
Will span the heavens

He'll rise...
We'll fall...
His rule...
Our end...

At the coming of the dawn
We've seen into the dark
In the shadow of the beast
We'll close our eyes one final time

You will all be fooled
You will all be fooled
When he reveals himself
When he reveals himself
You will all be fooled
You will all be fooled
He sees withing your hearts&lt;
He sees within your souls
