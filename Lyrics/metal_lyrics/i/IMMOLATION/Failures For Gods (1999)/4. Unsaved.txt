Shining with hues of magnificent splendor
Leading the way, revere him
The righteous, the saved
hand in hand, poised in rapture
Blissful delusion, believe in forever
Choirs of angels strike chords of transgression

How you are like your savior
With souls impure and vile
Rescued from our presence
your fall will be divine
Behold, the days of righteousness are coming
For wicked are the hearts of men and gods
Cleanse yourselves, step out of the light

Purge me of Christ...empowered, unsaved
Humble before him...the price for their saving

Don't pray for my soul for I'll rise above you
My hatred is my strength and through this I'll conquer
The fear and the weakness I see in your eyes

Touched by the divine
They hide in the light
Adorn me with his crown
