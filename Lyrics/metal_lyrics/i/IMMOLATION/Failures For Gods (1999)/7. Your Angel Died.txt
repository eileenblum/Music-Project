Angel of beauty
Angel of the spirit
Come down and walk among us
Let the spirit die within you
Shed your ties to God
Shed your holy grace
Come down and walk among us
Be tempted b the flesh

Denounce he who keeps you
Turn away from his light
Let your eyes feast upon
The debauchery that awaits
Indulge in your desires
Taste the fruits of sin
Angel of the spirit
Become one of the flesh

I will tempt you
Child of light
Show your weakness
Child of God

Revolted by it's weakness
So easily corrupted
Let us plague you with perversion
You've become what you abhor&lt;
No longer will you know
The raptures of the heavens
But instead what you will see
Is the sickness of the world

Taste the sweetness of the flesh
Let it feed our vestal needs
Taste the sweetness of desire
Your wings will burn and turn to dust
The flesh is crude, this flesh is evil
Forever banished to flesh and blood
Abandon he who commands the light
forsake the holy spirit

You will feel the charms of lust
Know the pain of loss
Envy what's not yours
And covet with selfish greed
Now flesh of my flesh
Open to my hunger
Permeate your pureness
With the corrupted seen of humanity

I will tempt you
child of light
Show your weakness
child of sin
