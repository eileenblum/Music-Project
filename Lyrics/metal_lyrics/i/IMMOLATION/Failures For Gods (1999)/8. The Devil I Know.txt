Cold and empty
His essence malign
This absence of light
Casts out and condemns...
God's will

His soul, his essence
Lives inside us
This wretched mark
Has stained our souls...
Forever

Through us his war is won
Victorious over God and his son
Persuasive and dominant his presence
Shall break the strongest of wills
The devout can't endure his storms
Grant passage into our world

His shadow will consume his storms
Grant passage into our world
His shadow will consume and feed
Upon your blessed trinity
Cripple and erase it's curse
Bring upon the end of faith
Until your savior comes again
To prove his death was not his end
He'll come alive through our beliefs
We hear his laughter through our tears

His cries of glory as we stray from the light
Defeated and shamed, chastised and silent
Angels, and Saints, and God forgotten
The path to heaven ends at conception
Our souls will fall far below the clouds

Through us his war is won
Victorious over God and his son
Persuasive and dominant his presence
Shall break the strongest of wills
The devout can't endure his storms
Grant passage into our world
