Will the love of God shed it`s grace
Upon the evil side of man
Symbolic throne begins to tarnish
Poisoned with impurity
Clouds of darkness start to thicken
Dominate the tranquil skies
Frigid Earth, devoid of light, begins to rot
And die

Angels fall, their wings decayed
Their hymns of praise sung from the graves
Unspoken prayers, cease to comfort
The objects of His rage...

Into everlasting fire

Judgement passed, now conclusive
The appalling truth reveals itself
Our tragic end was procured
By our own deceitful ways
Once created in His image
Now destroyed in His fury
A disregard for our lives
His people now condemned

Denouncement of all who`ve sinned
Their blackened hearts ripped from their chests
Forgiving God, exalted high
"Please forgive our sins!..."

Into everlasting fire

Blessed in life... flourish in death
Children of God... destitute
Embrace of love... misconceived
Tears erupt... fall to hell
Caressed by fear... we die as one

Mourners of a dying world
Too late to reconcile
Into everlasting fire
Can`t You see it`s Satan world
