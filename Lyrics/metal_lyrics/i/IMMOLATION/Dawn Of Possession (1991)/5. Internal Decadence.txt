Digression to an unknown fear, mortified
Soul embraced in a darkened grasp, path to hell
Infiltrate the weakened mind, succumb to death
Waste away, convulse in pain, dissolve within...

Twisted brain
Abstract world of pain
Anguish of the mind
Tortured afterlife

Bodily entombed... beckons internal grave
Paralyzed with fear... internal decadence
Submit to parasitic thoughts, drown in a mental haze
Extraction from reality, feelings now devoured
Dimension in hell, rotting mind, wastes away
Desire life, fade away, suffer endlessly...

Twisted brain
Abstract world of pain
Anguish of the mind
Tortured afterlife

Exiled from sanity... never to return
Mental paralysis... internal decadence

Twisted brain
Abstract world of pain
Anguish of the mind
Tortured afterlife

Bodily entombed... beckons internal grave
Paralyzed with fear... internal decadence
