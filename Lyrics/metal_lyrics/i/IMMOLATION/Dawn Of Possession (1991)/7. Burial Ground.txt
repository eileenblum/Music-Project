War has evolved, in a world bound for death
Trails of blood
Lead to our corpses
Liquids of life, have taken to the Earth...

Man destroying man...

Mankind a corpse, with man`s insanity
The Earth is now a burial ground
Destroying humanity
A world made of shit! Now in endless pain

Man destroying the Earth

War has evolved, in a world bounf for death
Trails of blood
Lead to our corpses
Liquids of life, have taken to the Earth...

Man destroying man
