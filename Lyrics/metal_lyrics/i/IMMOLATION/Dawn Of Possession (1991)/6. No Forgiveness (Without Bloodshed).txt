Noble ones perverse
Fulfillment of their lusts
Seeking innocence
To satiate their needs
Children for their pleasure
Abducted from the world
Adopted into hell
Punished for their births

(Circle of) Maniacs

Rules of their existence
Insane immortal laws
Desires are forbidden
Lusting for their flesh
Sickened evil minds
Manipulate to death
One hundred and twenty days
Sodom redefined

(Circle of) Excrement

Kneel down before the Lords
And taste the filth awaiting You
A noble feast for those enslaved
Enticing vows of defilement
Unholy palace of perversion
Embellished with depravity
Embrace Your life, for now
It slips away

(Circle of) Blood

Commencement of their final trial,
Upon their final day
Trembling naked figures slowly
Marched into the courtyard
Tender flesh is seared and ripped,
Tides of blood released
The Masters watch in ecstasy
The orgies of the damned

A sacred ground of tragic deaths
Breeding decomposition
Spirits rising from the dead
Seeking retribution
Abandoned futures never seen
By those of youth and innocence
Inevitable demise
The circle now is sealed
