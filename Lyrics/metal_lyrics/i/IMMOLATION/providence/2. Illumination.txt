I will become your world 
All you see and all you feel      
So followâ¦â¦â¦..

I am the way                        
I am hope
I am the dream
I am the one you seek

Creating the illusion, groom you for my cause
I will break you no matter what it takes 

Cradling your sorrows while draining your strength
Rear up in revulsion but now itâs too late

Together in madness weâll proclaim our intent
To raze this world in resounding deceit

Bending your minds with my tongue
Entangled in my web like flies
Wear my love around you like a noose 
A perfect world for those I have chosen

I am contempt
I am deceit
I am betrayal
I am the one to fear
