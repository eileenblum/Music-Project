Spread the word, selling faith
Cleansing souls while spreading hate

Inciting wars, bringing death
A mental plague to undo us all

Countless souls
Spiraling down 
Now millions more
Must come down

Pour yourselves, into your folly
Hollow hearts are never true

Speak the poison, from faithless lips
Spreading venom with every word

Countless souls
Spiraling down
Now millions more
Must come down

Come down to earth
And see the truth
Your hunger for dreams 
Only feeds deceit
This flood of menace
Still drowns our world 

Murder over soil   
Murder over power 
If truly the will of gods 
Then all the gods should be punished

Gods of war
Gods of death
Lose your gods
Find peace again
