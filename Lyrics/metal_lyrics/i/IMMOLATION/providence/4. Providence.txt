Watch the skies blacken, 
Can you hear their thunder
On majestic wings of death
The swarm will cast its shadow

Like demons spewing fire
Raining death upon us
Their crushing blows of judgment
Reduce our world to ashes    

Descend for the kill         
Time is standing still           
Numb to the screaming havoc
Living through this nightmare

Pounding our world 
Shaking our souls
Beating the earth
Like a hammer from the gods

Flames that scorch the heavens
Hurricanes of fire
Making tombs of cities
Burn your way through us all

Phoenix of perdition
Erasing life and light
Miles of blackened ruins
Make the devils proud
