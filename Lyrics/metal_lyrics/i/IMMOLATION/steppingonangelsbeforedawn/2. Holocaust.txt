A mushroom cloud in the distance
Marks the end of your existence
A matter of seconds to destroy all nations
The end is here annihilation

Lighting the fuse for spontaneous combustion
Missiles are launched to bring forth destruction
Mutated creatures roaming the wasteland
Kill all survivors dying by their hand

Hundreds of years to recover and rebuild
Cause everything's wiped out and everyone's been killed
Survive nuclear winter and the holocaust
Your old life is gone, everything's been lost

[Chorus:]
Nuclear blast, death is fast
Billions killed, feel the chill
Total death, in peace you rest
Obliterate, a world of hate

Go through the desert elude the acid rain
Mutants embark on their tyrannous reign
Furious battleground for mutants and humans
Fight in the wreckage, fight in the ruins
