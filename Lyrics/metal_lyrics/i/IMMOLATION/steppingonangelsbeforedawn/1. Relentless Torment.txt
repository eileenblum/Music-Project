City in fear, tyrannical king
Rules by the dark side, terror he brings

Darkness has settled
Streets are all clear
Night guards are watching, your living in fear

Break the reign of the tyrants
We must form an alliance
Withstand the king and show defiance
Time has come for deathly violence

Rebellions the talk, amongst the crowd
Better keep quiet, don't talk too loud He rules from the throne, castle on the hill
All who oppose are tortured and killed

[Chorus:]
Relentless torment time to rebel
Overthrow the king
Break away from his hell

Ignorant fools, can't you all see
Unite and destroy and we'll all be set free
