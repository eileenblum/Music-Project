Rebirth, Born absent creation.
Re-manifest to Descended Existence, Where light shall not seep.
A Imperfection of Evolution Expires, A Treacherous God Has Awoken,
Manifested from Ascended Life.
Revocation, Of Mankind, Prometheus, Shall Arise.
Deformed of Formless Presence, Formed of a Physical Body.
Bearing an Eternity of Entombment, Suffering and Purgatory; Exhumed from Contortionism
Bearing a Void Of Creation, Bearing a Void Of Punishment
Bearing a Void Of Creation, Bearing a Void Of Punishment
"The Collective Souls of Life I Sacrificed Myself To Create"
"Used to Rebirth me, A existence of torturous embrace"
Exiled to the Abyss.
Destroyed, Reformed A Repeating Cycle of my Existence.
Of, Life, Of, Death
A Gift A Curse, Immortality, Aeons of Repeating Death, Death
Deformed And Destroyed.
