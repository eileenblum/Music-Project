I am not your brother, sister
Father, mother, just a blister
I am not your anything

Overwhelmed dream catchers sewn
Nightmares swarm, alone
Separating soul from bone
Torn apart before my gravestone

Exit me
Limb from limb
Agony

Overwhelmed dream catchers sewn
Nightmares swarm, alone
Separating soul from bone
Torn apart before my gravestone

Save me from mutilation, suicide, premonition
Save me from mutilation, suicide

I've long been dead
How can you save the dead?
