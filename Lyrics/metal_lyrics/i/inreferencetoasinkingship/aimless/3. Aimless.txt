(I am the only one left)
Relieved beyond belief just to call someplace home
Relieved beyond belief not to be on my own
But there will never be anyone there for me
So bite down

Transient as it may be
Not as transient as me
Looking up above me, I see no stars
Immobile as I am, with the soul cut out

My life is caving in on itself like a smoker's lung
Each breath shorter than the last (than the last)
And it's hard to have ambitions
When all I want to be is dead

An eternal wanderer of the earth
But dead is dead is dead is dead
Life eternal

I am the only one left
