You look like yourself
You make my eyes sick
Even when I wake
You embody torture
You look like yourself, you sadist
You make my eyes sick, these visions
Even when I wake, relentless
Don't take one more step, you pervert

You embody torture
Let me rest in peace
Away from -
You destroy periphery

Man with razor blades for teeth
Devil's brain with surgeon's means
Useless prayers (hands together)
On wounded knees

Unspeakable
Incisions make it so I can't forget
Dead eyes flutter
Memory I cannot reset
Father of time, you nail me down

Crooked rests your barbed wire crown
Crooked rests -
Closed eyes mean nothing
Open eyes are empty
