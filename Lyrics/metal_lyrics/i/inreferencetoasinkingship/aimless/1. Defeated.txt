Nothing can make me stronger
Nothing can save my soul
Wipe the blood from the stone and repent
But you will never be forgiven

I am numb
I don't feel a thing (I don't feel a thing)
The damage has already been done
You have ruined me

I will not forgive
I will never forget
I struggle for air
In a sea of regret
