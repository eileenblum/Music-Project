You twisted, unintentional engineers
Of the apocalypse you're trying to survive
Prayers fall upon the deaf ears of man who believe they're alive

Knives, knives in the backs of -
Knives, knives in your back
Knives in the back of your missionaries
The king of kings is the king of neglect

And we're all unwilling marionettes
Controlled by your apathy, chained by regret (enslaved)
And we're all unwilling marionettes
A life on our knees and look what we get (enslaved)

Our throats are all sore from desperation
Our souls are all dead and he's waiting to collect
Our souls are all dead

And we're all unwilling marionettes
Controlled by your apathy, chained by regret (enslaved)
And we're all unwilling marionettes
A life on our knees -
Enslaved
