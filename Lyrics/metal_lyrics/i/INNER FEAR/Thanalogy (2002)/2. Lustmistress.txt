I'm floating trough bloody sky,
this blood from my tighs
Drowning in my pain of loneless and silent
Burning veil I ve got but compressed am I
I wish once in my life to find my wistful heart

Tell how strong must be delusive passion
That can decide your own being...wasted creature
Tell how strong is delusive passion
That can decide human being...deep inside

Welcome in the realm of us
Where demons and nymphs are in your minds
We make fate all the time
So, invoke the Lady of your lies
