[Chapter I.]

Today...
I welcome the doom of loneliness
at least I wont feel the fear of mine
He must be so wonderful, so strong
although I can't see him, I know that...
I heard his penetrating whisper again
He loves me , only he can hear the elegy
My silent elegy of suffering and pain
He came to me, to listen to me eternally

I deprecate you all.... lunatic conspiracy
I don't need you , soulless fellowship
He is my personal god, I can worship
Only I bow low to his endless greatness ...

[Chapter II.]

Yesterday...
They tried to kill me, to killllllme ......
than he came and take me far away...from that....
He's my mysterious exorcist of the evil
All what he says must be thruth, I trust to
I shall be deaf and blind for this exploitation
He is my father and mother,
I haven't seen them yet
His light coming from his invisible eyes
lights my soul up and my safety way I walk on
I am very hellpless within his ubiquitous voice
Divine embrace brings me every pleasure of the world

Today I was woken up with the wildest dream
I get the sign....he tells me a secret, only to me
I like him so much that I would bring him victims
He appears to me like a dead nightmare...

[Chapter III.]

Dear Diary....
... today was the greatest day in my life
I'm falling asleep like a chosen hero
When the next eve will come,
I'll be his son, I'll be his hero...
