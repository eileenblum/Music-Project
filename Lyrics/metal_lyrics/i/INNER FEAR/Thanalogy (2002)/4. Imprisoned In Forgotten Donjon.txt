Alone in the unknown land
when these long nights
seem to be so eternal
I made a sorrowful harp ring

Only a chink in the walls
those embrace me in a circle
brought a ray of moonlight
to ripel herds of rats

Unceasing steps I hear
want to make me insane
to bring on fear inside
my tortured illusions
Sounds of horns
heard so close
from opposite hills
the ancient elvenhymns

I'm imprisoned in the highest tower
where all the bats sleep
Imprisoned in the forgotten donjon
drained from sad anguish
