Upon the grave of guilt she lay
Engulfed with fear of what may lay beneath
A fragile shell of emotions
Oh...so dark within a mortal coil
Enshrouded in silence she screams
Falling through the vortex (of scattered thoughts)
Tortured by confusion and fear...
of what may breed within her heart

...Vulnerable soul exposed to the dark
...A faint illusion of humanity in decline

The vault of horrid memories
Revealing the fundamentum naturae of man
Painful groan leaves her lips
A pervertion of psychogenesis
Revealing the fundamentum naturae of man
Private sickness of wicked dreams
The qualities only flesh is heir to
A malevolent pleasure of inhumanity

Clad in a cloak of sheded tears
A phantasmal scene in the dark
...sensation of the worst nightmares
something has broken down deep inside
A regression deep into the utmost pain
The ultimate callapse of conscious mind
The needs that make the beast of man
The passions far beyond the sane

Devoured by feeling of absolute exhaustion
The fear crawls atop her clandestine flame
Chimeras of entwined figures...(so obscene)
The Inner Fear of what might not have been
In quest for relief of mental affliction
Desperately drowning in abject despair
An immolation of futile morality
To the principles of ecstasy...

Clad in a cloak of sheded tears
Ravenous soul embracing the dark
...sensation of the worst nightmares
Blood drops on the tip of her tongue
An experience of the utmost pleasure
The ultimate delight of horrid crimes
A malignant grin on the face of sin
The sense of vicious ravishing
The scent of Inner Fear fills the night

The sanity drowns in pleasure of pain
Delirious laugh thrills the debris of mind
The needs that make the beast of man
Sheer ecstasy...akin to spasm
The Inner Fear that still burns inside

Never before she felt such alleviation
Such a reconciliation with what she was
As the entire life drains from cleft veins
Wetting the ground she once walked...
