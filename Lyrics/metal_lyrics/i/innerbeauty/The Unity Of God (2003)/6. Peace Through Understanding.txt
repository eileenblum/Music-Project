When I read a words that it told me
It made me sad this lack of self control I fear is never ending as long of my life
I'm trying to get up that great
Big hill of hope for a destination I realized quickly when I knew I should that the world
That the world was made up of this, so...
I cry sometimes when lying in bed
Then I start feeling a little stranger
To get it all out what is in my bed
So.. I wake in the morning I step outside take deep breath
I get real high than I scream form the top of my lungs
What's goin'on I try all the time
In this institution I pray
A every single day
For a revolution.
Peace through understanding in to existence
May to be always
Peace through understanding

Moving from within
And clothes at my breast
