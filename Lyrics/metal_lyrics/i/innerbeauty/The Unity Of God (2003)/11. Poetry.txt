If you read this poetry Remember..
That I am wherever you will go
My memory will always to a company why you betrayed me..?
Whereas I will always to faithful, may be this dying music would be escorting
Show me love, so much more I wanted to give love for you
But the happiness not for you nor me and nor otherwise,
I wish I didn't fell for you anymore...
To die of broken heart would be eternal memory,
I would be lie a bed in love paradise,
Forget if you think,
I feel ashamed Never..
Felt.. Sorry for anything.
