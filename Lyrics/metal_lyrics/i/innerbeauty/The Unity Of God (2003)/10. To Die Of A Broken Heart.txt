In my hands of memories I can't saying my name... I can't see in your smile
There is nothing silent now
Around the world high a laughs
Your not going on in my life...
In my sadness in your eyes I can't
Saying good bay... This is not our farewell
A never got this day.
You swim in secret oceans
You smell is incense burning
Your touch is silken yet
It reaches through my skin
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
I only hear you breath But you will go on
I wake from slumber Your shadows disappeared... Your breath is just seamiest
Surrounding my body.
I'm working through the daytime
But when it's time to rest... I'm lying in my bed
Listening to my breath.
