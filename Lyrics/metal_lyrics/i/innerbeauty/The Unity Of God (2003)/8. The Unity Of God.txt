I cannot blind you to die you alone master side your fix
But surrender to me and talk of your death
Your death show be eternal memory,
My altar a wish, your sacrifice.
Do not fear to bear your memory show be the mortal you must come to me sup posting that you die there
And death would be the wise a peace
In mortality show be yours
But surrender to me and talk of your death who liver of the lifes, after fact full forever my corner gazing who wish be your name fuck your storm!
Fear in the heart
.....
You don't know to feel in mortality because I have to know everything
Eternal...
If you want... You're nothing never mind
If I'll to wish all completely destroyed all life in the world...
I will to end continuously.
