[Music: Manolis Varouhas, Lyrics: Elvira Mitraka, Manolis Varouhas]

Into the dark of the night
As I walk on the road
I hear a voice inside me saying
"You'll never be free, you'll always be mine"
But all that I want is go away
"Don't be afraid of what you are
And don't be scared of what you'll be"
He seems so sure and so mature
But I could never be alike
"Come out, come out wherever you are"
Screaming louder my name
"Come out, come out wherever you are"
Leave me alone, go away
"Come out, come out, you'll always be mine"
Driving my life to the end
"Come out, come out wherever you are"
Sending my soul to the flame
A day like this where life begins
I feel the darkness in my heart
I can't imagine what I am
Cause I've never wanted all this stuff
The blood in my veins is now so cold
The passion I felt is also gone...
There's nothing left inside but hate
A hate for me, for you, for all...
"Come out, come out wherever you are"
Screaming louder my name
"Come out, come out wherever you are"
Leave me alone, go away
"Come out, come out, you'll always be mine"
Driving my life to the end
"Come out, come out wherever you are"
Sending my soul to the flame
