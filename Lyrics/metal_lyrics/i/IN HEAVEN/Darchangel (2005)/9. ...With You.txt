[Music: Manolis Varouhas, Lyrics: Manolis Varouhas]

I sing the words you want to hear
I dream of you when you're not near...
I dream of you, your touch, your skin
I feel your breath when you are here...
My heaven is with you my dear
My heart is back when you are hear...
My hug so warm when you're inside
My smile so bright when you're in sight...
Take me into your arms, Hold me, we're one now
Get me into your heart, Love me, we're one now
I sing the words you want to hear
I dream of you when you're not near...
I dream of you, your touch, your skin
I fell you breath when you are here...
I want to be with you around
When I'm with you my mind goes round...
I feel so blessed to be with you
And I'm in love with every you...
Take me into your arms, Hold me, we're one now
Get me into your heart, Love me, we're one now
We've been through a lot of things, but you're here to make me smile...
Nothing else completes my arms... All I want is you, all I want is you...
Never felt so warm before, every time you breathe I'm you...
Now I close my eyes and dream... All I want is you, all I want is you...
