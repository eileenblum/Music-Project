[Music: Manolis Varouhas, Lyrics: Elvira Mitraka]

You hurt me, I loved you and I start to weep,
Night falls, the stars come out, I go to sleep
Dreaming and wanting and waiting for you
Come to me, close to me, take me with you
There you are standing, your arms open wide
I fall for you, adore you, all through the night
Pleading with the light to stay out long
All of my sanity is long lost and gone
Lie to me and say you want me
Lie to me and kill me slowly
Lie to me and say you love me
Lie to me, lie to me...
Lie to me and say you need me
Lie to me and don't you leave me
Lie to me and say you love me
Lie to me, lie to me...
Black as the night thus my soul has become
A life full of joy that has just gone undone
A heart full of scars that falls in your hands
Take it or leave it, this option now ends
You left me alone though a long time ago
I cannot forget you 'cause I want to know
Where you are, I need to hear your voice
Searching your soul and I give you a choice
Lie to me and say you want me
Lie to me and kill me slowly
Lie to me and say you love me
Lie to me, lie to me...
Lie to me and say you need me
Lie to me and don't you leave me
Lie to me and say you love me
Lie to me, lie to me...
Crawling before you for one word of you
Submitting, surrendering, forsaking my truth
Your wish will be done and we won't be together
Beckon me for once and I'll be yours forever
Don't want to awaken in this world so cruel
Let us stay into this kingdom to rule
The end now is nearing, door closes my dear
Don't let me awaken to my biggest fear
