[Music: Manolis Varouhas, Lyrics: Elvira Mitraka]

"I lost to you, the essence of me
I'm gone in your arms and you won't hear my plea...
I give up to you, my last rays of hope
You've bound to you with unbreakable rope...
For freedom I beg, but also I need
That you keep my heart from my love to feed...
The pain that you give me is all that I need"
