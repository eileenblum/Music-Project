[Music: Manolis Varouhas, Lyrics: Manolis Varouhas]

"Do you still believe... there's life after death..."
Watching myself fade to this death, watching you lie I can't forget
This ain't real so neither it will, can you feel... Can you feel?
I can't believe that you are gone, This is the end and that is all
I believe that we will meet, somewhere else I know we will
Do you believe that death is, the final destination
Willing to find the end, to this glorious life damnation
I am wondering if this is right, I do forgive and say goodbye
Now I wish my heart would heal, I will be damned to breathe your air
Now is the time to face the truth, See what you've done see what you won't
As you die I pray to God, pray for me to find your soul
Do you believe that death is, the final destination
Willing to find the end, to this glorious life damnation
Do you believe? Will you believe? How can I live without you?
Do you believe that death is, the final destination
Willing to find the end, to this glorious life damnation
