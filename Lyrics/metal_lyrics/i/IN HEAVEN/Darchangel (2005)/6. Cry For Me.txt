[Music: Manolis Varouhas, Lyrics: Manolis Varouhas]

If I was wrong... you would be full of lies
If I was wrong... You wouldn't cry, nor dream
But now it's done... and I feel so damn-empty
If I was wrong... I wish I was wrong!!!
Pray for me! My soul is dying, Cry for me! My body's gone
Now I'm dead, your heart has broken. Die with me, cause I am you...
I can remember... my life was full of memories
And I can see... your pretty face smiling
If I would be... all that you ever wanted
If I would be... I wish I would be!!!
Pray for me! My soul is dying, Cry for me! My body's gone
Now I'm dead, your heart has broken, Die with me, cause I am you...
Never be dying, My soul will be flying
And you will live in my heart, forever...
