[Music: Manolis Varouhas, Lyrics: Elvira Mitraka, Manolis Varouhas]

See the moon up in the sky tonight
Please believe that we will never cry
I cannot forgive myself...
I just can't pretend no more
You will take your place among the stars
You shall live inside the warmest arms
You can never leave...
You won't leave my heart
Look at me, I think I'm falling down
Staying with you, my mind goes round and round
You are now apart from us...
And my heart has broken down
As you feel the end approaching you
As you feel that time has come for you
Please believe in us...
And please never cry
Never meant to fall, never meant to fall...
Do you see the stars up in the sky?
You'll become one of them tonight,
You are one of them,
And one with us...
Never meant to fall, never meant to fall
Never meant to fall to earth, nor you're meant to leave...
All I need is standing by your side, always wanted you to be alive
I can't dream no more... I can't breathe no more...
One last breath is floating to the sky
This is it our final last goodbye
As I try to hide the tears...
Hide the pain that you will cause
You don't need to be afraid no more
Feel the peace that fills your mind and soul
You don't need to fear...
You don't have to cry
Could we freeze this moment of the time
I just want to stop this pain of mine
And I wish I could hold on...
Wish that you won't be alone
Looking up I see you smile at last
You have been forgiven for your past
Now go on in peace...
Rise above the sky
