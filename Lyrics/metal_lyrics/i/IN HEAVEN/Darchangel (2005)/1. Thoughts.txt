[Music: Manolis Varouhas, Lyrics: Manolis Varouhas]

I thought you were too much for me, the air I'm breathin'
I thought you were the world to me, daydreamin'
I thought you were the one I love, but life is cheating
I wish someday you'll understand, and feel as I did
But I was wrong I was too much for you
You are nothing you'll see
Maybe one day you'll get hurt
And you'll be all alone screaming
But I was wrong... You are nothing...
