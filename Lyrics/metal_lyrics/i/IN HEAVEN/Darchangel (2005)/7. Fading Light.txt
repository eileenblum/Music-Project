[Music: Manolis Varouhas, Lyrics: Elvira Mitraka]

Creeping fast, nothing will last, this earth condemned to end up bend
In front of you, beyond of you, kneeling down they kiss your crown
You will rule and be so cruel, between the worlds so much it hurts
Forever bound, a screaming sound, a tree that burns and splits the ground
Roaming through the skies on the wings of fate
Looking down to earth a place that's full of hate
Roaming through the skies... Roaming through the skies...
The world will die and they will cry, to be saved and not enslaved
By the will they beg and plead, they have to show just one good deed
A locked up door they stand before, a raging war a falling star
They try and fight a fading light, it shows the way but they can't stay
Roaming through the skies on the wings of fate
Looking down to earth a place that's full of hate
Roaming through the skies... Roaming through the skies...
