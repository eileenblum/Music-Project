[Music: Manolis Varouhas, Lyrics: Elvira Mitraka, Manolis Varouhas]

Watching you behind a door, standing in the shadow of a dark tree...
Looking as you walk away, I am there but you can't see
Don't worry I will keep you safe, I won't let the world come inside...
Willing to be what you desire, it's time to forget the tears you've cried
Tell me that we won't be apart, tell me that we will be together
Tell me that we will be in love, tell me that we will be in heaven
Inside your arms I want to be, feeling that I am inside heaven
Inside your heart I want to live, destined to be with you together
Close to me you're in my arms, in my basement, endless days...
Tried to make you mine for so long, I can't count no more the ways
I only want to hear you say, make believe that you will be mine...
Your are light, my shadow, my dark, you'll be here until the end of time
Tell me that we won't be apart, tell me that we will be together
Tell me that we will be in love, tell me that we will be in heaven
Inside your arms I want to be, feeling that I am inside heaven
Inside your heart I want to live, destined to be with you together
"heaven is only a thought... heaven is only a state of mind..."
