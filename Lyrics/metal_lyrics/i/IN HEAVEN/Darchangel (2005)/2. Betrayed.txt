[Music: Manolis Varouhas, Lyrics: Elvira Mitraka]

Don't cry my love it's over now, I know you'll live again somehow
The day so full of life begun, but now the clouds cover the sun
We've lost ourselves over the time, until today I was so blind
I couldn't see the truth in you, and now there's nothing left to do
Don't let go and hold me tight, don't leave me out of sight
Your tears begin to fly, drowned by them and by my wrongful
Choice I can't hold on, my breath floats to the sky
That I betrayed you once before, it eat's you up goes down you core
Forgive my fault I beg you please, the only that my pain can ease
You whisper softly to my ear, you are my only love my dear
For one last time a joyful wave, pulls me for short out of the grave
Don't let go and hold me tight, don't leave me out of sight
Your tears begin to fly, drowned by them and by my wrongful
Choice I can't hold on, my breath floats to the sky
Don't let the river of my eyes, Blind you for someone else's eyes
Don't let go and hold me tight, don't leave me out of sight
Your tears begin to fly, drowned by them and by my wrongful
Choice I can't hold on, my breath floats to the sky
