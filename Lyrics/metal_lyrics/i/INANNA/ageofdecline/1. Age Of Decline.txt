Souls being sanctified within the debris
The scorched soil, expelling stifling winds
Living beings possessed by desolate spirits
Constructions of your past, corroded

Your eyes don't see the outraging power
Ages will fall forever into oblivion

Wars of anger, overwhelming terror
Masters of futile doctrines shall perish
Treacherous marks written in dying fire
Feeding civilization with complacency

Your eyes don't see the outraging power
Ages will fall forever into oblivion

Follow the worms into your endless sleep
Existence degraded to the lowest plague
Unworthy be the ones tied down to denial
The sunset of Men's era
All of you hear, the call of fate
It's the decline of your puny tragedy
Your primal weaknesses are revealed
Your flesh will burn away 'till the end of times

Perpetual wandering
To find your salvation
Times of suffering have begun
To crown your useless pride

Clinging onto the void, away from human hope
You must confront decadence, the putrefying act of God

There are no more aborted creations
Humanity inflamed in deceit
Spectral forces, swallowing entities
The decline of a thousand ages within
