[music &amp; lyrics: M. Neira.]

Hatred rise from the ash
Demons cross the gates of an ancient realm
Hidden underworld
Domain of tormented souls
An unseen power will take all life
Agony itâs in their eyes
From the skies, fall the scourge of the Nameless
All is lost

Merciless spirits of the dark
Feast upon lacerated beings
Damnation and suffering
The pain has arrived
Within the minds of the tortured ones
Fear lives endlessly
Waiting for the eternal shadow

Unearthed from nothingness
This day has revealed the doom of mankind

I summon the dead from their sleep
Rising the hordes of the undead
Forces of the abyss
Answer to thy call
Winds of pestilence in the air
This world will fall by this unholy plague
Punishment for the faults of Humanity

We are the condemned to suffer for eternity
Exterminated by the hand of extinction
Feel the anguish
And rot away
Fate is now revealed
Your meaningless life is ruled by Satan's pride
See all your fears
Confrontâ¦ reality!!

The afflicted souls are back from the grave
Cold winds of insanity
The traveler of endless dimensions
Has arrived!!

Torture and mutilation
Disgrace has taken your soul and mind
There's no salvation
No compassion, no dignity
All of you are dead now
Exterminated
Now begins the eternal sorrow
Don't defy this one doom 

We are the condemned to suffer for eternity
Exterminated by the hand of extinction
Feel the anguish
And rot away
Fate is now revealed
Your meaningless life is ruled by Satan's pride
See all your fears
Confrontâ¦ reality!!
