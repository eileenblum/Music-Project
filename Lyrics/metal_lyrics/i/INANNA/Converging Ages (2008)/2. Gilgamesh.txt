[music: C. Fuentes. / lyrics: M. Neira.]

Blood of men was once spilled, run through the walls of Uruk
Oppression and rape rests over the throne of King Gilgamesh

In tyranny, souls are slaughtered during the endless age
Hear our pleas, almighty Anu, unleash all your power on Earth

Out of the clay, Enkidu has risen, shepherd of the steppe
Dweller of the mountain, your anger will break all the injustices

Six days and seven nights
The whore gave you knowledge and power
Not a savage anymore
Go to the city, for wolves and lions
Are already dead

Fight was hard, might of titans was shown
The king has lost, but his dreams have spoken

We are marching now to face Humbaba the Destroyer
A sacrifice needed to end with the grief of the empire

The beast defeated, purification fulfilled
Your old life was cleanse
The vengeance of Ishtar

Eternity was granted to the gods, your will is nothing but dust
âThe thorns gave me the breath of life, which I'll share with my peopleâ
Go back to Uruk, clean your soul and hang your old armor
All is lost, you must leave this world as a mortal
King Gilgamesh!!
