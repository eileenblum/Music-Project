The scorn of a lost belief
To the void of endless fears
Hidden paths to obscurity
Revealing wrath or the Elder Ones

Death was defeat
Chaos is unveiled by an ancient spell
Seer of the darkest of abysses
âI summon thee, Ereshkigalâ
Unveiled existence

Evil seals in emptiness
Shall be fall beneath the earth
Nameless
Terror is unleashed

Melting in pagan blood
I pay for my revelation
Thereâs nowhere to hide
Crawl to eternity

I fall in the dark
This decadence was complete
Pain is taking me
To the ending of a race
Ancient wisdom, within darkness
Call the spirits of human sin

The scorn of a lost belief
To the void of endless fears
Hidden paths to obscurity
Revealing wrath or the Elder Ones
Memories of a cursed prayer
Dancing through this void
A battle in sadness
Tears turn into ash

Death was defeat
Chaos is unveiled by an ancient spell
Seer of the darkest of abysses

Rise in front of you
Destroy this tribulation
Show your crying spirit
âI summon thee, Ereshkigalâ
Unveiled existence
