The voice of madness
Leads me to the starless night
The way of suffering
Insane affinity
Inspired by solitude
(I) create the image of misery
Dissolving in emptiness
(I) engrave the form of terror

Come with me into the night
Without a shade of fear

The way so cold
Into the night
With no hope within
Astray inside
My mental pain
In the torment of life

The pain is ...........
Within my blinded eyes
Infesting my consciousness
Invading to nothingness...

Come inside my dreams of fall
When there's nothing to lose

The void within
Destroys my mind
Devastating my dreams
The way so cold
Through the starless night
Is the essence of pain
