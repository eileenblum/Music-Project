When you light will fade
From my hopeless soul
I will come into the land
Of the dreamless sleep

From elation
Of the reckless pain
Comes the dread
Of the silent dusk
In the depth
Of the broken soul
Shine the sparks
Of the painful remembrance

Tear the pain
From my wounded heart...
Separate me from my madness...
Take my soul
Full of the frozen tears
And take you from my remembrance

When you light
Fades
I bleed
In this cold night
Within this
Sick
World of my dreams
Forsaken and lost

Agonizing within
The maze of despair
I whisper your name
In the sea of the broken hopes...
In the night where I lost myself...
