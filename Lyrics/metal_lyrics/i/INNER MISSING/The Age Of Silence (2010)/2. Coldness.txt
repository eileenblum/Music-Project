Silence falls
Through the coldest of nights
It covers (the) earth
With the mist of winter
I am gone
To detachment of the cold
Just to stay apart
From the ignorance of light

Leave me
In this cold delusion
Let me die
Within the maze of silence
I have your light
Your faked purity
I pray the coldness
To be my salvation
In asylum of the wind
I hide my damaged soul
In insanity of tempest
I will rise...
Sleeping with the eyes
Closed for the light
Dreaming with the cool
open in the dark

The pain
Is frozen within
My exhausted soul
The winter loses me
For I am
Fading to cold
