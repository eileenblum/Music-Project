Astray in the night
Of endless grief
Lost in the shadows
Of senseless hope...
I will wait for the light
For the light of your eyes,
For a touch of your skin,
For you to come into my dreams

In my sickened soul
The seed of pain arise
I fade into the dusk
Through the hollow skies

Fracturing my mind
Distress takes me
Descend to me
You will never
For your light I will
Destroy my faith
My world will die
Ruined by your breath

A-slumber in cold
Of velvet night...
A dream of demise
In silent pain...
I will wait for the light,
For the light of your eyes,
For a touch of your skin
For you.....just a dream

In this cold abyss
Of my despair
The memory of your light
Will dwell forevermore
