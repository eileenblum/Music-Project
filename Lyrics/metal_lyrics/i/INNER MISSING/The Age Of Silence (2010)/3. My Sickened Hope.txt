In silent rest
Of hopeless despair
I cannot forget
Your voice...
In reckless trance
Of my sickened hope
I cannot escape
From this
Pain comes
From the mental decay
I nailed my hope
To the cross of despair

Within the light
I suffocate in agony
My feeble faith
Has turned into insanity
See me ruined
By the light
Of the fading dream
Still, I am lost
In this pain
In this lunacy

When you come
Into my dreams
I feel the breath
Of heaven
And I deserve
To stay inside
And awake never

Until the pain
Collides my soul in nothingness
You'll stay within my memory
Inside the dreams of suffering
In despair
I fall
To oblivion
Come to demise
For my pain
For my sickened hope
