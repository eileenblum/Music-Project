You had taken all the pain
From my distracted soul
You had become
The silence in my veins
I tried to understandâ¦
I failed in understanding
The sadness of your smileâ¦
Your fading smile

My heart is a sore
Pierced by cold
Needle of your stare
Glitter of your eyes
Embraced with your warmth
I fade away
Immersed to painless coma

By the flickering way
Of the trembling stars
We pass through the stillborn night skies
I slowly burn in endless faith
As you are injected into me

Closeâ¦so close to God
I am with you
I fall to agonyâ¦
When I fall into you

Holding your handsâ¦
Touching your skinâ¦
I cannot control myselfâ¦
I cannot control myself...

You are the light
Incinerating me
You are a dose of sanctity
Burning my soul to dust

Closeâ¦so close to God
I am with you
Your flesh is made of reveries
And a smell of white dustâ¦
I am just a substance
Of your dreams to realize
I am just a fiction
Of your silence to bleed

I cut my soul
To make you free
From me

When the nighttime breeze
Will touch your face
You will hold me in
Your sincerity
My drained mind
Will never be
Free from the spell
Of withdrawal pain
