The water of your sea
The water of your sea
The water is frozen within my very eyes
The stillness of your sea
The stillness of your sea
The stillness will scream
Inside my head

I will never break
The distance
Between your lashes and my sores
I will never shine
I will never catch the stars
For youâ¦for you

I tried my best
To overcome
The sweetest charm
Of your laughing eyes
Iâve wrest you away
From my bleeding mind
And now your kiss
Asunders me

I will never break
The distance
Between your lashes and my sores
I will never shine
I will never be alive
For youâ¦for you
