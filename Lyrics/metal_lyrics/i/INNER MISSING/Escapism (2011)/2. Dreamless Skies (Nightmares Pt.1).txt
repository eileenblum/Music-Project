On the edge of leaden skies
On the threshold of the sleep
A clot of eternity
Holds you in its jaws
As youâre drowning in reveriesâ¦

Envoys of heaven
Torment you
In celestial fire

Let her fleeâ¦
Please, let her fleeâ¦

You burn in your insanity
But Iâll still be near
I will hold your hands
I will dry your tears
I will be with you till you wakeâ¦ till you wake

I will tear my soul to pieces
But I cannot tear you from the claws of terror

Come with meâ¦I wish to die for youâ¦
I wish to take all your pain.
Come with me and see the light
In your dreamless skiesâ¦
In your dreamless skiesâ¦
