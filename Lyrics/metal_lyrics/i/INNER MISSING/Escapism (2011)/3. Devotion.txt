â¦The last drop of faith has fallen
I hold your broken body on my broken armsâ¦

On the meadows
Of serenity
We used to walk
In our azure dreams
We used to be so beautiful and still
We never thought of fate
That haunted us.

We were chained
By delusion of our lust
And engaged
By the rain of autumn
We danced
In the silver moonlight
We danced
Entwineâ¦

How could it all be lost?
How could it all be broken?

I ask the skies
Why they bereaved
You of me
I crave
On my knees
But they donât hear
My devotionâ¦

The skies are indifferent
To our pain and tearsâ¦
Tearsâ¦they will fall
With the rain
To my woundsâ¦
