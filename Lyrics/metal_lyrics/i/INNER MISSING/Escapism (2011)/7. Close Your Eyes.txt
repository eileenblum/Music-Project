The elusive wind
Which caressed
Your hair
I inhale
And I merge
With its mellow breath

Close your eyes
Donât get out
From your dream
I will praise
I will chant you
In every slumber tear

In every slumber tearâ¦.
In every slumber tearâ¦.

Truly devoted
Entirely insane
Completely dissolved
In psychotic hazeâ¦
Now Iâm goneâ¦
But do you think of me?
Do you reflect upon me?
Do you dream of me?

Close your eyes
Iâll take you away
I will kiss you until
You keep me in your dreams
