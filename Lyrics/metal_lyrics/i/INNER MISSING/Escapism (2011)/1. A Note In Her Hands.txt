I stand above
Her prostrate body
Beholding the deathly pallor of her face
And a note in her hands

With shivering and wounded hands
She asked to forgive herâ¦
The light is dead in her eyes
The light is deadâ¦

When the fear became so weak
Facing the hopelessnessâ¦

She sighed with desperate calm
And fade to winter wind
Rejecting life, neglecting all your wordsâ¦
A step into the silenceâ¦

The fierce wind embracing her
With piercing pain
Exhausting all the life from herâ¦
The last seconds
Of agony and fear
Alone
Alone
Alone

On her wrenched wings
She flies away
To the burning in the sunrise horizon
Her body is still here, full of beauty
And even angels envy her escape

I see it in her lifeless eyes-
The shining of ecstasy
The silence is calling for meâ¦
The silence is callingâ¦
