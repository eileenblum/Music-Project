Walking
In the dying forestâ¦
Speaking
With the sleeping treesâ¦
Wandering the night
Without a chance
To return
And see the light again

I am nailed to my bed
Paralyzed by the lethargy
Drowning in a cold sea of fear
Suffocating in the night

Beneath the thin membrane
Of my decaying mind
The monsters of my memories
Disjoint my hope
The demons laugh at me
For Iâm condemned to insanity
By myself

Comeâ¦Oh, come..
Please, awake me
I entreat
But no one hears me
This grey void has killed my voice
Iâm immured behind the wall of sleepâ¦
