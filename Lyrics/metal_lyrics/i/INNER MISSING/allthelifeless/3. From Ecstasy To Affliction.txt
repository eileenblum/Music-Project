all the lifeless 
dreams
lurk within the night
all the empty 
souls
burn within 
the light

the godless prayers
in lust and consternationâ¦
in solitudeâ¦deserved!
in painful exaltation
i crush my own mind
and liberate the darkness
the soul will slowly die
and silent is the night

see the rising
dusk
hear the songs 
of  twilight
in the crushing 
gust
in the mournful
silence

in mental affection
the agony is so chasteâ¦
sophisticated suicideâ¦
exquisite soulâs torture
in mental affectionâ¦
from ecstasy to afflictionâ¦
the soul will slowly die
and silent is the night
