through the murky gates of the night
blizzard comes inside
the empty soulâs abyss
eradicating your light
try to find the only way
when your fears collide with storm
forsake your silly wish to stay
in this carrion, corrupted world.

solemn is the light of the dying sun
so are the ruins of your deceptive dreams
liberate your pain, as you come into demise.
surrender to the storm which will terminate the pain.

strive towards the mortal end
exert for the sake of nothing
astray in the mist of delusion
you try to come within
the dumbest soul, so deaf to your screamsâ¦..
yearn and crave for deceaseâ¦.
a touch of the storm will damage your dreams
