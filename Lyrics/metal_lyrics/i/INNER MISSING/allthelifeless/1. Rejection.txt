rest my eyes from this miseryâ¦
my hate will rise from the maze of affliction
shatter the walls of vain hopes
design of my mind is desintegration
wounds of my soul had gone
but the pain still lingers
as tide of mourn falls down
abhorrence will rise from the depth of mine.
i spite in the eyes of the sky â 
it cannot give me a piece of your mindâ¦.
a part of your soul

sentence me to anguish
bring me to afflictionâ¦.
rotting dreams in silence 
turn to lifeâs  rejection

so, betrayed and doomed to solitude
i fall into the gust of madness
love will turn into decomposition
tenderness will turn into disgustâ¦
anger grows within
all the control is lost
the pain will remain forever
detestation to you is my flame

i hate the infinite beauty
for it cannot be mine
for it cannot live in my sick soulâ¦.
