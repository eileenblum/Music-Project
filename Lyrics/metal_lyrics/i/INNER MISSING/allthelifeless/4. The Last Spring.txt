take me away from this deception
from this disgusting dream of mine.
lost in emptiness
in suffering
in the night so dark and hollow
lost in solitude
and withering
flowing in the cloudy stream of lust    

the breath of spring so fair, so silent
a sickly image of my dreams
from the murderous skies 
the rain of tears
falls into the land of sorrow.
from the emptiness of mine
the silent scream
invade into the twilight

behold the rise of grotesque visions
coming from insanity of mine.
obsessed by venomous dreams 
i gaze into despair,
descend into the maze of sorrow
oppressed by the breath of spring 
i dive into the gloom
without a ray of hope.

one moment of springâ¦â¦.a moment of pain
filling my heart.
one dream for the deadâ¦â¦a dream for the lost
falling apart.
in the silent domain of  flowing tears
waiting for you.
in the sorrowâs embrace, sick and insane
bleeding to death.
