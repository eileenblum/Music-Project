Stay with me for a while
In the sea of grey
Feel the wind scattering the leaves
Itâs time to say farewell...

The wind casts the spell upon me
And I canât resist its call
But how can I ransom my soul
From this drab captivity of walls

This tangled labyrinth of hazy streets
Draws the victims into its ghastly arms
Charmed by its perverted beauty
They slowly rot in their self-built cages

â¦Deception
Let me your secrets to unfold

Ailing faces and northern constellations
Are reflected in the murky streams
Lofty spires nail the sick souls
To the width of grizzled skies

Adopt me
You, damp monster
For I have lost my soul
In you
Inspire me
Saturate me with your cold
And let me dissolve
In your pallid fog
