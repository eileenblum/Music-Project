romance In a shadeâ¦
In the morning shadeâ¦
With the stranglehold on your neck
You are saved

Donât be so shy
Wheeze and resist
Till convulsions ceaseâ¦
Till convulsions cease

I will save you from the sticky hands of ignorance and lies
I will save the sublime chastity of your eyes
Sleep, my angel
Sleep, my angel still
The affliction grimace 
Will no more distort your face

We were parted by
The senseless laws of life
But in agony
You are only mine

In this concise moment, 
Almost living, in my hands
You are twitching and I am 
Almost dead, almost dead
Sleep, my angel
Sleep, my angel still
In your gentle bed of
Never ending childish dreams
