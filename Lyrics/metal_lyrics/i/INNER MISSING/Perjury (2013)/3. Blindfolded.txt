From the heavens
Of frail placidity
We are expelled 
To walk the scorched earth
Reckless bearers
Of deific spark
Artists without
The eyes to see

Who can say
How can we
Take away
The veil from our eyes
My Lord, have mercy on me
Show me the wayâ¦

Distant memories
Distort the sleepless mind
Weird anticipations
Are burning in the sight

Ride the wind 
And celebrate your boldness
Your freedom 
Is grinning ahead
You will break your limbs
And liberate yourself
I will liberate myself
With a rope

Fascinated by demise
Like butterflies by fire
We are the bastard sons 
Of the insane god

Who can engage the starlight in a night
Who can restrain the tempest
Who can divert the avalanche
And who can stop us on our way?
