Conflagrating me
From inside
The remembrance 
Is smouldering

Isolate me
Please
Isolate me

From the darkest corners
Cloaked in blood-stained rags
Loathsome beings come
To take control

Disguised in haze
They crawl
To overwhelm

The dagger in my hand
Burns my skin
I cannot disobey
Its command

The predacious instinct
Is leading me now
The feverish pulse
And the scent of the victim

The white gown
Of crystal winter
Will be soon
Dyed in red

How long have you been
Waiting for the steps
Which are piercing now
The calm of the park
How many nights
Youâve spent in sordid dreams
Shivering with lust
Shivering with fear

I desired 
To cut your flesh
You deserved
To be flayed

One by one
The blood drops fall
My work is done
And your eyes are closed forever

From the distant skies
Frigid stars behold
The appalling sight
That you present now
The prickly wind
Will cover you with a quilt of snow 
And youâll become as cold
As one of them

No one will find your trail
No one can leave the path of blood and snow
