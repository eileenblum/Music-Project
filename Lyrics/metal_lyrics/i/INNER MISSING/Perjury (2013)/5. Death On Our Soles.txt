Casting no shadows
We float across the skies
Carrying death 
On our soles

Crippled hands
Canât hold the weapons
Unarmed we go
Into the final fight

The earth is red with our blood
There is no need to spare our lives
Our wings are blazing in the flames of war
That cannot be ended

The snowflakes slowly fall
Upon the scarps of our flesh
Beheaded we lie
Unarmed, but undefeated

Falling stars
Valiant fools
Knights of the make-believe empires
Staunch until the end
Finally betrayed
Diamonds in the crown of the Lord of Lies

One blinding flash and all is gone
Without regret weâve burned ourselves
Regardless of the envious stares
And vanishing without a trace
