Staying motionless
At the lorn crossroads
We were dissolving in
The fey music of the rain

Under the scudding clouds
I held you tight
Under the scudding clouds 
The rain was beating in our faces

I promised you 
To fall down with the rain
I threatened 
I will fall
Fall with the rain if you leave me

Now the illusions are squashed
By the millstones of time
I have no power to live 
And no power to die
And no strength to continue the fight

Under the scudding clouds
The gale is tearing my mind
Under the scudding clouds 
Once again I vow Iâll redeem my promise

I promise you 
To fall down with the rain
I promise, I will fall with the rain
Fall with the rain
Fall with the rain
