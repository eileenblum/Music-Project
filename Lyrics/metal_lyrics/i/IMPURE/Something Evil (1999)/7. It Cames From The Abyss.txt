Last night the demon spoke to me
last night the demon spoke 
last night the demon spoke to me
last night the demon spoke
Abysmal beings will eclipse the sun
they will rise in tornment
abysmal beings will eclipse the sun
to rise in tornment 

Human soul covored in flesh
now listen carefully
your truth lays before me
drawn in blood she is 

For your defeat
I lie in wait
gall sweating
and vermented 

I saw your beginning
the fleshrace was born
I've watched all the bleeding
and tasted that sweet gore
to absorb all living
that never should be given
I lie in wait
to rise my claws in agony
from the abyss
from the abyss 

Yes, it cames from the abyss
