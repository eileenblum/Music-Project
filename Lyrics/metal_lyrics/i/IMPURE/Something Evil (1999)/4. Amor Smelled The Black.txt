Amor smelled the black
you read the book of laws
and in your prigishness
you believe to control
the game with the great unknown
amor smelled the black
the sun shall never rise
for you 

With mind embraced by fire
I call the summon thee
mighty ones behind the barriers
lurking in the astral spheres 

Cut my soul in half
take this gift from me
spawn of the unlight
you are blessed
knowledge sealed the lips
of prayers 

Amor smelled the black
you read the book of laws
and in your prigishness
you believe to control
the game with the great unknown
amor smelled the black
the sun shall never rise
fuck you...
