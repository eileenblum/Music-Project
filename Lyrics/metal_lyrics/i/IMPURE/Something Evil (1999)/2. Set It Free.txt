Set the dead free
cause its my deliverance
in this void
unspoken and unnamed
only time knows well
where I exist
centuries over centuries
in this awful emptiness
the gods left this place
this palace of pain
my private hell
hell.... 

Set the hate free...
all the hope I eat
and in my sweet misery -
I grew in agony
centuries over centuries
thousands souls I've raped
the cursed ones left in space
I've dreamed the sufferance

Set it free !
Set it free !
in that hot steam
the angels bleed
Set it free !
Set it free... 

Set the dead free
cause its my deliverance
dwell in blasphemy
cursed are thy crapulas creeds
that makes the profane blind
I've dreamed their sufferance
