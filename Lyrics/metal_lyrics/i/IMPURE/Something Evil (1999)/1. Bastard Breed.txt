Watching at man fucking race
they're livin' their lifes
like parasites
wormlike crawling through the dirt
they devour what brought them out
And the world - that is given to them
is a world they've build from blood

From....blood 

And the gods they are praising
are the impotent ones 

But you'll see
flesh is weak... 

Yes it will be true
you shameless ignorant beings
the worthless bastard breed
mankind ends putrefied
and yes you fools believe
you're the most perfect of creation...

Human race what will you be
cursed for all eternity
