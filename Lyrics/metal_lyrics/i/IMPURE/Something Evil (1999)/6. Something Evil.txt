Adrenaline pushed up the body
confused mind is flooded with pictures
targetless and restless I'm running
I don't understand -
what happened 

Something evil bit me 

With every move she made
she winged my fantasy
with every word she had spoken
she set my anger free
I felt it growing strong
I felt it
it devoured 

And through my brain
a stabbing pain pulsated
yeah, it animated
then something snaped in my head
and the murdering started... 

Red stream begun to flow
over her head - down to the neck
as my fist fucked her face
a demon in me took control
and her face - new formed
dead body collided with the wall
again and again
sweet headcrusch symphony 

Nervosity crawls in me
as I look down to the blood
nervosity crawls in me
as I look down
to the blood
