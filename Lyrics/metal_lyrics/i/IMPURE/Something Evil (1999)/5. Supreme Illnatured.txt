Cast your flaming spell
you supreme illnatured
flesh may fade away
blessed are the intrepid 

Gaze into the emptiness
illnatured human being
walk behind the barriers
all answers could be found 

ALL ANSWERS COULD BE FOUND 

You call the names
written in infinity
to you they shall aparture
the secrets buried
that buried deep
in malevolence
that buried deep
in malevolence 

Cast out the blind
away with the gods so unsignificent
Banish the blind
all answers you`ll find 

The answers you'll find
all born of purgatory
is the hot steam that flows
and the focus of calamity
that may enlight
the spirit of the arcane
devil who reached the abyss
our grave full of pain 

Cast your flaming spell
you supreme illnatured
flesh may fade away
blessed are the intrepid 

You call the names
written in infinity
to you they shall aparture
the secrets buried
that buried deep
in malevolence
that buried deep
in malevolence
