166 ways to kill and you choose this?!?
You wear sadism like a glove
Sitting there in you suffering chair
Watching your love joke on it's own blood
Have you no concept of regret?
I know you can pretend you do
A thousand times you've rehearsed those lines
But you still fumble the last delivery:
"I'm sorry"....
Your black eyes betray your heart
No amount of eye shadow will hide you
Not 'the you' I've come to know and hate
Run away from me again and hide
Maybe someday I'll stumble across you
Then I will be sure to bury you
So you can lie in the unmarked plot beneath my feet.
