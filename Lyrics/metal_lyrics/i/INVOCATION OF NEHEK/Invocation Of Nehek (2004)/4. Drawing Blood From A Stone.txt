Sometimes I wish the shadow I hide in would smother me
Slowly rip the breath from me and set it aflame
Burn away all my self-consciousness and fears of lies
Then, maybe, I could fade away like the nights fog
Thick and haunting, I could hide from everything and engulf all
Then fade away with a gentle whisper from you
Only to lay down and bleed in my gutter alone
Looking up to see you spit and walking away
It that you stopped trying
Turn around and walk away from this cloud
That lie has turned black and it's looking for blood
Occasionally it's better to seek solace and forget
It seems you've sought and found your place to hide.....
