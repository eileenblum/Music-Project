Today is the last day I'll stare at the sun
It reminds me too much of you
Burning bright and destined to fade from my sight.
God, you were always the most beautiful of us.
Holding your head high is dangerous and brutal
Careful those low hanging sickles, they devour
Will memories drown me in you tonight?
I can always cut them out with a leaf
I MISS YOU ALREADY
Don't make me beg, I'm far below that point
I see you walking away from me slowly
Leaving a bruised earth at your heels
I love you so much it kills me to say,
Maybe you'll be happier without me.
