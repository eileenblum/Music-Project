Made pale by putrid light and shadow
Your face reminds me of the dead
Just a little less beautiful with twice the rot
I guess I'm seeing through that facade of yours
A little more makeup should hide that scar
You are perhaps the worst of all frauds
A lie from the inside out and back again
If only you were dead..........
Save me the trouble, my sweet angel
And quit while you are ahead
One more wrong step and you're in for the fall of a lifetime
Landing far below where I once held you
All alone in the dark and steeped in horror,
THIS IS THE TRUEST YOU HAVE EVER BEEN.
