Is this the day I forget you face?
Or maybe tomorrow when we ride the breeze of steel pins
It's never as easy as I remember
Burn everything that bears my name
And let me drift away from you
Forget those nights of twisted obsessions and bloody tears
And these scars of serial killer lust
It's those words I wrote to you that scream in disbelief
A wayward glance and a forgotten smile
I've seen this paradise die before...
Walking between our end and the crashing surf
My regrets disappear with the cherubs
Unbind my hands from razor wire guilt
This drowning man sees what burns behind your eyes
Watch me grow and wither in those dreams of yours
Sleep tight and awaken to my absence
I certainly haven't forgotten your face
And I don't think I ever will...
