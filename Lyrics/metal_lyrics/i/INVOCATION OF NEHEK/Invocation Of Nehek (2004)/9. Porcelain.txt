Take this phrase and bury it beneath you
No more battered faces and forgotten tongues
It seems you've renewed my faith in hate
I'm not as exacting as I once was
I've forgotten what those words meant to me
And your face looks a little dirtier now
Face down in this puddle presents breathing problems
Looks like you're not so righteous now
Just one more minute, that's all I ask
Then you will resurface and wipe away that masquera
A razorblade smile for all those tears
An ear-to-ear grin must have found it's home on you
Porcelain white skin wrapped in bloodstained carpet
Maybe this river will wash away all your demons
Maybe they will stay to hurt you until I come to meet you
Then I will have the chance to do it all over again...
