Shattered your words, broken in meaning
Fallen from grace on high
My heart is still bleeding
Centered in your hate
A fine night to walk in the shadows
Letting darkness fall over my face
The silhouettes ahead look familiar to me
I can tell it's you by the light in your eyes
Standing there with wings spread and arms out
Black hair hung over timeless brown eyes
Reach for me and I'll take your hand
Together we will stride through the murk
Fog curling around your heels
Gone, all of these days we have shared in hopes of love lost
In my heart I will find the truest feeling
All that has been, has been so right to me
The streetlights beyond pale in comparison to your eyes
I've been lost in them since first glance
Waiting for a sign to sink in forever
Look at me get lost in them all over again
