[Lyrics: Patrik Rimmerfors]

Fager stod elden i brand
pÃ¥ stenar fÃ¶rsjunkna de fanns
TidlÃ¶s var natten sÃ¥ skum
slÃ¶jor vid vattnet skyler dess glans

HÃ¤nfÃ¶rd var blickar mot eld
i mÃ¶rkret en skepnad av liv
Sinnen de flyktar sÃ¥ svÃ¥rt
bitter var kampen fÃ¶r den som sov

FÃ¶rgÃ¤nlig var lÃ¤nkar av blod
rÃ¥dande tystnad av sorg
TÃ¤rande lÃ¤ngtan om tro
svidande Ã¶gon nÃ¥r ej mer fram

Handen mot marken sÃ¥ tung
spillror av tiden bidar djupt
FÃ¶rgÃ¤ten var Ã¥ldern de levt
enig var fÃ¶ljet vid eldens sken

[English translation:]

Fire

Fair stood the fire lit
on sunk stones they where
Timeless was the dim night
Veils by the water hide its splendour

Enchanted were gazes towards fire
a guise of life in the darkness
Minds fly so eagerly
Bitter was the battle for the one who slept

Perishable were links of blood
reigning silence of grief
Consuming longing of faith
Smarting eyes does no more reach there

The heavy hand against the ground
splinters of time wait deeply
Forgotten was the age they lived
united was the company at the light of the fire
