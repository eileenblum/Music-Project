["Midnight Clear: A Solid State Compilation" (2014)]God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came; 
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises, 
All you within this place, 
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace; 
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy.

God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy, 
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Of comfort and joy
Of comfort
Of comfort
Comfort and joy
Comfort and joy

Of comfort
(Of comfort and joy)
Of Comfort
(Comfort and joy)

Whoa oh!
