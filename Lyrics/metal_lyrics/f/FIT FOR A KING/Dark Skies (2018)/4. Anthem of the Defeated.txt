Rage; the feeling flows through me
Pain; it keeps my heart beating
Hopeless; there's no end in sight
If I don't fix my life I could die tonight

The disrespected, the angry at heart,
I feel your pain, I feel your hurt

Hatred; it comes in waves,
Tear me apart, then what's left to save?
Monster, I see your face when I close my eyes
Monster, I see your face
And there's no where left to hide

Rage; the feeling flows through me
Pain; it keeps my heart beating
Hopeless; there's no end in sight
If I don't fix my life I could die tonight

Rage; the feeling flows through me
Pain; it keeps my heart beating
Hopeless; there's no end in sight
If I don't fix my life I could die tonight

The disrespected, the angry at heart,
I feel the pain, I feel the hurt

Hatred; it comes in waves,
Tear me apart, then what's left to save?
Monster, I see your face when I close my eyes
Monster, I see your face
And there's no where left to hide

Rage; the feeling flows through me
Pain; it keeps my heart beating
Hopeless; there's no end in sight
If I don't fix my life I could die tonight

If I don't fix my life I could die tonight
