Light the match
Set my body ablaze
There's nowhere left to hide
When your mind is stuck in a cloudy haze
Pressure pushes its way inside
No room to move,
Now where to hide
I can't find the strength within myself
The weight of life has pushed me to a living hell
Endless misery
Lack of sympathy
I don't trust the voice inside of me
Inside of me

No trust
I always put myself out there
But it always ends the same
No trust
If words are words
Then I'm the only one to blame

Backbreaker
Sever all the ties
Sever all the lies
Backbreaker
Reach inside and see if I'm living

Light the match,
Set my body ablaze
There's nowhere left to hide
When your mind is stuck in a cloudy haze
Every good intention turns to dust
Where do your loyalties lie
When there's no one to trust?

Backbreaker
Sever all the ties
Sever all the lies
Backbreaker
Reach inside and see if I'm living

Backbreaker
Sever all the ties
Sever all the lies
Backbreaker
Every fear consuming

The world is watching
Their eyes are piercing me now
I feel the pressure
This will be my end
