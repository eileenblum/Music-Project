Make me a memory

How do I make my life something to remember?
Give me a purpose, raise me through the smoke
I'm on my knees, oh God
I'm losing direction
Give me a purpose, show me my place

Hear me
Fighting eternity
Hear me
I need more time to find my place

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
Will you reach out?

In the darkness, we're divided
Tearing at the seams
Burning bridges, lets the light in
It shows us who to be
Will I stay a memory?

I keep falling further, further from the answers
Will this monument fall when I surrender?

In the darkness, we're divided
Tearing at the seams
Burning bridges, lets the light in
It shows us who to be

In the darkness, we're divided
Tearing at the seams
Burning bridges, lets the light in
It shows us who to be

Hear me
Fighting eternity
Hear me
I need more time to find my place
Though my heart is torn
I don't feel hopeless
I am not afraid
I am timeless

In the darkness, we're divided
Tearing at the seams
Burning bridges, lets the light in
It shows us who to be

In the darkness, we're divided
Tearing at the seams
Burning bridges, lets the light in
It shows us who to be

Will I stay?
Will I stay?
Will I stay a memory?

Make me a memory
