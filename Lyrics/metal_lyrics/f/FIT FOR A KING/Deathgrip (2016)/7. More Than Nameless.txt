I will survive. I had it all figured out
A career, a future, I had no doubts
I was never a stranger to substance
I never thought it would end up like this
Watching the best of your life slip through your hands and pass you by
Constantly reminded that you've clipped your wings and can no longer fly
Time wasted on hearts of stone and stares that cut my flesh
Please tell me there is more to this

Lift me up so I can see
Past the darkness inside of me
Show me who I'm meant to be
I know that I'm worth saving
Lift me up, 'cause I'm worth saving
Show me hope and lift me up
This is my cry

This is my cry, let me feel cared for
This is my cry. Let them see who I really am
The world needs to know that I'm more than just failed aspirations
I am more than nameless

I've been spit on, I've been cast away
I am more than decay
You'll never hold me down
Rise up. I'm not nameless

I was once a great man with so much to gain
But now you call me scum, with nowhere to turn
I don't care what you say
I will pick myself up and survive today
