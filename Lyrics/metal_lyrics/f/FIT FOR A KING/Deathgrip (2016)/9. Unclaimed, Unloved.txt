Tell me, how can one live when all they hear is useless, worthless, give up?
Defeat coursing through a shattered heart
Will he ever find love again?

And then I heard your voice

Time won't change the way I feel
Changes. They're telling us to trust what's real

Show us what is real

Once unclaimed, once unloved
This is where we make our stand
Nothing can hold me back

I've met my father
I've met my maker

Left alone at birth
Wanting to feel something real
Bearing the scars to show that abandonment won't be his ending
He met his father

Time won't change the way I feel
Changes. They're telling us to trust what's real.
