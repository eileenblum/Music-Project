Foundation cracks
The wounds are bleeding 
The end is calling
The end is here

You're in a deathgrip [2x]
Deathgrip
Death will know my name 
You're at the world's end [2x]
World's end
I will be the last one standing
I can see the end
It's staring right back at me
I brought us here
A place spent to waste my humanity

The storms destroy
The quakes awaken
The end is calling
The end is here

You're in a deathgrip [2x]
Deathgrip
Death will know my name 
You're at the world's end [2x]
World's end
I will be the last one standing
I can see the end
It's staring right back at me
I brought us here
A place spent to waste my humanity

In a life of choice I chose to deny
Through all of my sins, I chose to die
There will be nothing when I've lost it all
Please God, let this end painlessly

My memories are like a noose around my neck
I could never let go of all the regrets

Deathgrip

You're in a deathgrip [2x]
Deathgrip
Death will know my name 
You're at the world's end [2x]
World's end
I will be the last one standing
I can see the end
It's staring right back at me
I brought us here
A place spent to waste my humanity
