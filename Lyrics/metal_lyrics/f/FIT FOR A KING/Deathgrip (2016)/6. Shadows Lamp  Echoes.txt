What brought us here?
Living life inside the lines
Vision impaired
We can be so short sighted
I would rather watch us fall
Than be so passive
I would rather watch us fail
Than be stuck at the start
What happened to our heart?

Are you happy now?
Watching your feet sink into the ground

The silence was it worth it?
To show them you are nothing
Won't you tell me about your heart?
Won't you tell me just what that means?
I've been living in shadows
And hearing these echoes
As they follow me

Walk the line or society will swallow us whole
Fall behind and let the hate consume you

The strong they stand up for their sons and daughters
The weak they flee from the sight of martyrs
We are the fire that won't burn out

Breaking through the veil
Placed over weaker minds
We live in a time where vultures feast
And logic dies

Won't you tell me about your heart?
Won't you tell me just what that means?
I've been living in shadows
And hearing these echoes
As they follow me

Won't you tell me about your heart?
Won't you tell me just what that means?
I've been living in shadows
And hearing these echoes
As they follow me

Won't you tell me about your heart?
Won't you tell me just what that means?
I've been living in shadows
And hearing these echoes
As they follow me

I've been living in shadows
And hearing these echoes
As they follow me
