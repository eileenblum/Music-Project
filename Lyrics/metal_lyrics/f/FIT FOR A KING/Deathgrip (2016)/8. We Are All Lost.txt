I reached out my hand, but you let me fall to the deepest depths
Where I could never be found, where I could never be heard

I built my foundation with the fragile hands of fellow men
I believed that I was the key and that you were only there to help me when I needed you

How quick I was to forget your love
Save me from the hell I'm in
Let me fall apart and repair me again
Fix me, I am broken, let my heart burst 'til my chest is open

Where do you go?
Where do you run to?
When you took this from me
You had it all, you let the world go
Now I'm lost and shaking

Every breath I took, was another promise of my betrayal.
Where do you go? Where do you run to?

We're all lost and sick

We can't fix the past, but with an open heart life can be changed forever.
Pull me up, show me that this life's worth living
Tear me down, tell me all the hurt I'm causing
I spent my whole life thinking faith was dead
But now I realize I never had trust in You, I had faith in me

Every breath I took, was another promise of my betrayal
Where do you go?
Where do you run to?
We're all lost and sick

We're all sick.

Take me home
Take me home to a place where my heart is full and I'm surrounded by grace
Take me away from this world and everything that I've craved
