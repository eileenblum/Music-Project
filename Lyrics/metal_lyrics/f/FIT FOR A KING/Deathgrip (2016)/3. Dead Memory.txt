[feat. Jake Luhrs]Fifteen years since you walked away
No goodbyes, no apologies
What's a kid supposed to do
When He dies inside
What's a heart supposed to do
When you've bled it dry

I won't let you in!

This is the last time I put my trust in anyone
This is the last time I sit back for you
This is the last time I put my trust in you

Would you even notice if my world was falling apart?
Would you even care if my heart stopped beating, my heart stopped beating?

I chose to make amends to let you back in
But you did what you did once again
I chose love in a moment of death
And this is how you repay me?
Ripping trust away
I will let you rot, waste away
Return to the ground for heaven's sake
And now you will know my misery

Your tongue tells lies
Your eyes deceive
Your touch, poisonous
You're nothing to me

Would you even notice if my world was falling apart?
Would you even care if my heart stopped beating, my heart stopped beating?
Would you even notice? Would you even notice?
Would you even care, would you even care
Would you even notice if my heart stopped beating, my heart stopped?
Would you even notice if my world was falling apart?
Would you even care if my heart stopped beating, my heart stopped beating?
