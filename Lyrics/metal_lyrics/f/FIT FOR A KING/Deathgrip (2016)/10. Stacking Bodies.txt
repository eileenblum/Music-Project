[feat. Levi Benton]He lives among us
Stacking bodies piled to the sky
No one sheds a tear when the faceless die

The clouds of smoke cover the stench of rot
Returned to the dirt just to be forgotten
I hope you see their misery

We live in a place where five-hundred thousand people disappear without a trace
No funeral, no regard
Just another number in the body count
He lives, he lives among us
The serpent, the serpent numbs us to their pain

When the sun sets and the devil leaves his hole
Stacking bodies over bodies just to steal your soul
When the lights out bodies burning up the land
Letting evil sit upon its corpse throne

This world is turning to the fires of hell
We bow our heads to the lawless one
He lives, he lives among us
The serpent, the serpent numbs us to their pain

No more peace, no more light
We've destroyed this world
Darkness fills the sky.
