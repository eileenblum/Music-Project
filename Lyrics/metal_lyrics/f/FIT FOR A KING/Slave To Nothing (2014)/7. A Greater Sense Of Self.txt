Save me from myself

Was the price I paid not enough
to prove my devotion to you
My body is bruised and broken
from being a faithful servant

Use me or let me go
This is too much to take
Move me or let me fall
Relieve me of this burden

Have more faith in me
I'm not guided by ways
that will lead to nothing
Have more faith in me
I grow this garden
But it's dead around me (around me)

Make me see
That this isn't all for gain
Make me see
That there is more waiting at the end
Don't You see that I do this
All for you
So save from myself

If I'm not left abandoned
Why do I feel like less of a man
Than the one I was before
Teach me how to grow

If I'm not left abandoned
Why do I feel like less of a man
Than the one I was before (I was before)
Teach me how to grow

Don't live for yourself
You'll lose it all
The reward is worth nothing
It all will fall
I have realized that
the prize is life step aside
I will be heard

There will be change
I will make a difference
There will be change
It's not about the things I've gained
Or the path I've chosen
I'm giving up everything I've made
Breaking free or false intentions

Use me or let me go
This is too much to take
Move me or let me fall
Relieve me of this burden

Have more faith in me
I'm not guided by ways
that will lead to nothing
Have more faith in me
I grow this garden
But it's dead around me

Have more faith in me
I'm not guided by ways
that will lead to nothing
Have more faith in me
I grow this garden
But it's dead around me
