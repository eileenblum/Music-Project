Lose yourself and the ones you love
Throwing stones at the bones.
setting fire to homes
Lose yourself and the ones you love
Throwing stones at the bones, don't end up alone
Terrified, at the thought of losing myself again
years of doubt and hate have led me to flee to your gaze
I'm prepared to lose it all
and as the skies turn pale, blood pours upon me
Bring your wrath
Let it wash over me
I just want to let go
Your venom flows through me
The worst is yet to come
Like a parasite you digging into my soul
Spirit filled these lungs, make me whole
Released from the prison of my doubt, a worn mind is opened to a truth it can't live without
I was never prepared to lose it all
But the broken will always fall
I looked to you as a friend
Save me from my end
