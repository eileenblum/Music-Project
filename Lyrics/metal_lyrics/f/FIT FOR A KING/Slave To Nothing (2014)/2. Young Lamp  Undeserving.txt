You took him away
without a trace or tear, erased from the story
Hate fills these bloodshot eyes
He was gone with no warning

I cry for peace, but none is lent to me
I pray for relief, just pull me closer, please let me sleep

Only in dreams, so blindly you follow
Only in death we come to amends
This bitter pill I'm left here to swallow
or will I see you in the end?
Why won't you answer me?
Have you turned your face away
answer me
Is it heaven or hell where will he stay?

I'm done wondering where he went and how a good man lives to die
Desperate to hear your voice of reason
Speak up
speak up and let him sleep

Only in dreams, so blindly you follow
Only in death we come to amends
This bitter pill I'm left here to swallow
or will I see you in the end?

Give me a reason
Why you took my friend
Is it because he lost his way, I'll only know in the end
I just need to know why
I'm lost on the inside

Replace the happiness that left this empty heart
Erase the death that now haunts my every though
Erase the death
Let him walk the earth again

Only in dreams, so blindly you follow
Only in death we come to amends
This bitter pill I'm left here to swallow
or will I see you in the end?
