Let's look back, back to the moment when I followed sin with every step and every breath
I wanted what I couldn't have, it was never enough
Forgotten innocence, just a shadow of who I was meant to become.
Is this who I was meant to be?
Why can't I save me?
In pursuit of flesh, I was rotting in my own
A broken soul, searching for home
Alone and forsaken
Take me back to the days when I was young
Take me back to the days when I could feel anything
Take me back to the days when I was young
Take me back to the days, take me back to the days when I was not afraid to die
Each and every star will fade, but every night brings a new day
I can't see what's in front of me, oh help me find my way
Seeing all the right and wrong, hoping that I will stay strong
The fire in the sky will light my way back home
What are we afraid of? The past is gone, leave it behind
What are we afraid of? Resurrect the man who died inside
Words can't bring back the way that we used to be
We need guidance
We need action
When the road ahead looks bleak and the scars on our hearts have slowed our breathing
Don't let the darkness define you, step out from the shadows
Don't let the darkness define you, you are not alone
Don't let the darkness define you, you will find your home
