I've filled my veins with poison
And silenced my voice just to take another breath
I've broken my vows to you a thousand times before
I'm losing myself, sit back and watch me die
How can I say that I'm scared of death
When I spend each day sprinting towards my eternal grave
Every move that I make, every step that I take, crawling to my eternity
These words are my plea
show yourself and rescue me
Kill the pain, from the curse of myself
Kill the pain, show me the way back home
Kill the pain, guide me back to you
Guide me back to you
I've let these demons bleed me dry (hollow and cold, lost and alone)
Screaming these words to the sky
Kill the hate within me
When I'm at my darkest I crave for light
but when your hand reaches out, I abandon you
Begging for death with every breath that I take
pull me from my self made shallow grave
