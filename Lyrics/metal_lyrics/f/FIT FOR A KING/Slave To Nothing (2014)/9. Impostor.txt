Selling hope to the hopeless, ready to bleed them dry, and take their dignity
So get up on your stage and say they need what you have,
when your words mean nothing to you or me
We know that you're faking it
You may have them fooled
Will they see it's just a trick
We can see straight through you
We'll see if you can save yourself
A liar in Heaven makes an angel in Hell
There is no substance in what you sell
And now the world see you for who you really are
Impostor
You may have them fooled, but we can see straight through you
Don't bow to liars
Don't bow to liars.
