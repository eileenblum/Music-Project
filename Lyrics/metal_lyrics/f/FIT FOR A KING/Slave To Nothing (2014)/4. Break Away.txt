Burn me alive and take my life back, I don't deserve this body
Every day is another battle, and I'm tired of fighting
The devil grabs my throat, and now I know that I'm not the only one to blame
Years of empty bottles and broken needles have lead me to the flames
If we know that Hell wants my body
but Heaven wants my mind
How can I come to grip with all the choices in my life?
Break away, break away
From the choices you've been faced with
you just need to let it go
Free yourself and let it go
When all hope had abandoned me, I looked above
Holding on to what's left of me, I've had enough
Serpent, burn in Hell
We are constantly being pulled under by chemicals that brings us to and end
There will be no day without a struggle, no task without payment
I've been dancing around my demons
Thinking I could heal it all alone
In pain I found myself but I've been missing You the most
Take your life back
I won't rest until I see this serpent burn in Hell
Serpent, burn in Hell
