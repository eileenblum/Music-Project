[feat. Jeremy Gray]Step up and fight through this, this sickness that keeps us silent. Step up and fight through this. The end is in our hands. I'll be the one standing there with the end in my hands. I'll be the one standing there with the truth in my heart. It's time to step outside these comforts that we've built to seek the faces of the weak. I want to live for what life's meant for. (I want to live this life). I want to live the way You've shown us. Live with their lives on the line. Live to speak the truth that is in you. I'll be the one standing there with the end in my hands. I'll be the one standing there with the truth in my heart. With blood filling up my bones its my time. With breathe filling up my chest its my time. (My time to move). Step up and fight through this, this sickness that keeps us silent. Step up and fight through this.
