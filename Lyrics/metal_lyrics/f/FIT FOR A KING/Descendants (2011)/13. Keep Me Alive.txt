[2013 Re-release Track]Keep me alive
Break!

Never once has self loathing fixed the challenges we face in this life
Leaning towards defeat is not a mindset that will ever suffice
Stand strong, stand firm, and have some faith
You will be brought to safety
Rest your weary head

When I let this in, that all hope is gone
I let these demons make bed in my home
When I let this in, that I've lost it all
My life is theirs for the taking

Death will not become me
Death will not become me

For nothing in this life has been given that you can't face
For every heartbreak there is an embrace
Search for safety, you will make it home
Rest your weary head

When I let this in, that all hope is gone
I let these demons make bed in my home
When I let this in, that I've lost it all
My life is theirs for the taking

You're the one who let these thoughts come in and devour you
You're the one stressed to the point of wondering, is there anything you can do?
There is nothing holding you down but your own doubt
Break free and believe
Death will not become you

When I let this in, that all hope is gone
I let these demons make bed in my home
When I let this in, that I've lost it all
My life is theirs for the taking
When I let this in, that all hope is gone
I let these demons make bed in my home
When I let this in, that I've lost it all
My life is theirs for the taking

Keep me alive!
