I must destroy this crippling skin. I must deny these wayward thoughts. A prisoner to myself, this grip is suffocating. I need out. Remove this flesh, hollow out my eyes. Remove this flesh, shed the scab, and hollow out my eyes. A prisoner to myself, this grip is suffocating. Its wrapped around my neck, its devastating to see these walls cave in. Its wrapped around my neck. Its devastating me. This is the reaping. You will reap what you sow! I'm casting this down. I'm casting down my idols (cast this down). I'm putting down everything. I'm ready to be moved and set aside. I'm ready to be moved, be moved aside. I'm broken for You. Seeking only You. I will not be shaken. I am cleansed from the inside out.
