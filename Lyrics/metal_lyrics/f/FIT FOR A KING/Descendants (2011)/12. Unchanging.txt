Adaptation is what we've settled for. (We've come to carry you so far away). I open my eyes and all I see is the walking dead. The only thing that keeps me going is knowing this will end. Will you be my exit? I breath life into this world. Tear down my faith tear down these walls I've built to keep You out. We've come to carry you far away from here. We're all about to run, but everything you say hurts so much. We'll turn and run from everything we knew. Because I have the key that leads to you. I won't let this go. Waking up I won't be here. You have taken me and shown me that there is so much more then this world. We will run so far from here, you've given us the key. We will run so far away from here, so that we can make it through. We've come to carry you far away from here. I won't let this go, my worthless hands have let you down. I won't let this go. My worthless hands have let you die. I won't let this go, waking up I won't be here.
