You brought your hell to Earth. They are the ones that you called demons, the one's that you called wicked. Our time has come to reclaim this world. Bring down your reign. We are descendants of the Almighty. The weak will fall and the strong will be set free. We are descendants. If I told you I was falling would you run to me or catch me in your grasp? The arms of the broken can only hold you up for so long. Ignorance is no excuse when you are faced with eternal damnation. Watch as the seas of this world are turned to blood. We are descendants.
