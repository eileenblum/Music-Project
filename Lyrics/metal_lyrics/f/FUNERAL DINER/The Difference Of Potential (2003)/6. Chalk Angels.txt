Safe inside still immortal my memories have no skies standing on chalk angels drawn in sidewalks building cities in dirt nothing ever made sense pressed up against the fence staring at the cars go by waiting for the bell to ring playing in the rain big yellow raincoats nothing could hurt me falling off the slide sliding on concrete skinned to the bone adventures in empty fields childhood was never long enough
