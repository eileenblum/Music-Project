Enlightened by the storm that feeds the depression the play fell from our eyes build a confession laugh as the sky falls shadows within shadows you see it's not there remember the steep streets none were silent all were frayed I can't sleep in silence it's warm beneath the flames with my torn black sheet looking up to see the bottom too dark to see the gray flames in my hands my nightmares are in color build the towers to the skies I've died trying hide between the cinder blocks and loose gravel when did I become transparent fade in and out between the frequencies never asked to live forever hollow and unfair jump to see if you'll live the story has no ending it just finishes here released from reality and forced into dreams sleep well sleeper the liars wait for the morning then they'll come for you
