out again humming that same monotony knowing yet again that familiar feeling that torn chance dream held together by just that little bit by that tiny spec of something promised can you see it yeah well maybe you'll reach it one day along with that calm pool because in this pool it's sink or swim but you're caught doing the dead man's float i wish i could give you something different but i'm lying in the water face down beside you
