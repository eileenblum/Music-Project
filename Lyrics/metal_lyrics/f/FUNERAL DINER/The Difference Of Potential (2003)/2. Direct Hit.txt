Can't make the pain stay forever days are gray and the sky is always within reach remember when the past was tomorrow don't burn or bury me push me away I'll fade can I have your nightmares don't know why this moment hasn't passed hollow tipped words through quick shallow breaths remember the day she passed away slip and fall shatter like glass this cruel existence misleads you everyday there is no tomorrow today wasn't supposed to be always looking to the past never saw the future coming I'd rather burn in the night then feel the false comfort of masked sincerity with broken promises and nightmares coming true signal the others let them come and see
