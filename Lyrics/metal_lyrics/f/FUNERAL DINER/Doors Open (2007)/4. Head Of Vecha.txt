Place this and perceive, fulfilled this need crossed this line. Take this and live, there is no more to regret. I can see the door, and the birds are more clear than ever. No failing, no falling, no apprehension. So much more, so much clearer, and the world has felt these feet and will again. These miles are nothing. Wearing thin carries very little weight. See to it that you are with me, purposeful and steadfast, new and unflinching. Take this and live and more.
