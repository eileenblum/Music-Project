Breathe in, close your eyes. This is a safe place, and easy to be alive. Held to higher standards and led along. the greater the capacity the greater the reward. And the view into the infinite the touch of always that comes to us all in time, or all at once. Believe me this time, but dont be afraid anymore. Breathe in lay back. As dark as we are the change is bright and forever, and on. Put it all together, we are more and complete. There is more to this story. Breathe in, we are more. Dissolve this and still we move, the change is clear and welcome, and i'm going home.
