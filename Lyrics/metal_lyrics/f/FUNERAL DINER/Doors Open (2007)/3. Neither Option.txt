Embrace this falling never ending the parchment tears at the slightest touch, and days stretch to months more easily than you could imagine. And this continues longer than you could ever believe, until the end, closer than you could see. As the signs were clear in front of everyone. We found the true end here and it was in between. We were wrong again. Just out of sight. And still it comes down, and still it falls. No end, no change. We are left to this sky.
