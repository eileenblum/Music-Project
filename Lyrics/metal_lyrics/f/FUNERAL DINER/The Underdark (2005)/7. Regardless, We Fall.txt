And it comes for us all, creeping, drawn out, or so quick you feel nothing at all. This seems to be the only way out, the only option against aiding and abetting. This is what it has come to, how far we have fallen. All it seems that is left for us is to fall further, into our own desires, further still from those we once might have called friend. As the actions taken by the masses implicate us all. We all have blood staining our hands. Lying to yourself or killing your conscience may ease the guilt. But that's not enough, they will never wash clean.
