Plans made to be executed at a later point in time. "The truth is what we make it, not what you see, so ask no questions." And derisive comments, disregard, and humiliation are what we reap from trying to change. They know now exactly where they stand and kneel. Mostly the latter, it's been building up to this all along. Every meticulous step. And it was missed by all of us. Walls built out of self righteousness will keep us apart, and now we are easier targets. So those in favor take note to exploit every weakness that we show you, almost as if we want to be destroyed. Yes, we do have a deathwish. So do your worst.
