The darkness sorrounds you. The darkness shrouds everything. Movement is apparent and the movement is dangerous. All around the walls are crushing, looming as if to threaten the collapse. But this is home, the dark, the warmth. This is still home, and you know you can't leave. So welcome the terrible weight of failure and our own arrogance. It hangs heavy in the air, with the smoke and the fire we create (there is no safe place here). Resign yourself to this, resign yourself to the dark. So never sleep too deeply, but most importantly, never get caught. None of us belong here in the darkness but it seems as if we have no choice. Our path was chosen for us and now there is no way out. But nobody feels trapped, as we become accustomed to this night with no end, and no end in sight.
