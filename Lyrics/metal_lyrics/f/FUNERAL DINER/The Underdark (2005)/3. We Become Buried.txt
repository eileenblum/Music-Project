Colors shift, airwaves move and shape themselves into a perversion of what's right, how we were all fooled. And it continues to never add up. With options disappearing fast, the pacing voice and the burning hate-filled eyes make themselves out to be the only possible choice and truth. So long live the hate and long live the self serving destructive "ideals" that led us to this closed existence in the first place. Trust becomes an ugly word equated to weakness and a foolish path to better ourselves. Tired of deception from every angle and the constant fear (you must stay afraid). Fighting back becomes more difficult and we resign ourselves to existence in the dark (you must stay afraid). And the hate only gets worse. Hidden in the low light the hate only gets worse.
