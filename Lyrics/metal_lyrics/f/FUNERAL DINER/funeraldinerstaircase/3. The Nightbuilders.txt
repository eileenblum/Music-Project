take down the clouds and burn the town just leave me a boat so i can escape, it's too late i have no intention of calling this off this is where we'll die and wake to black and white dreams with our fists hidden behind lies tomorrow won't come the nightbuilders pulled down the sun with shackles and sleepy eyes touch your last morning forget i ever existed
