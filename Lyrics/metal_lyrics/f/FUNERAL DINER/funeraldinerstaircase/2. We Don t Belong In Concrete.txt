outgrown these shoes long ago, standing taller shooting better the perspectives have changed cant be this way forever the new is tired and old fresh faces showing their lines lives have started and finished. watch them pass everyday watching them fall always a mystery when a face disappears don't want to be here but the roots run too deep we don't belong in concrete but where else will we go
