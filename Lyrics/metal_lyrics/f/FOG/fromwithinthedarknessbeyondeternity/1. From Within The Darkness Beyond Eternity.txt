I long to see, the look in your eyes
As I take your life, away...
Into the ground you are east. Cease to exist.
I shall live on, for eternity

Perform the dark arts,
Rise above mortality,
Feel the power of unholy darkness consume...

Gain the knowledge,
Strength of elder gods,
Given his gift of eternal damnation.

Drawn into my vision, 
Kingdom of the damned, 
I shall fulfill my destiny, 
To become one with darkness, I quest...

Forever...

Beyond the sky, endless... black infinity...
Deep within the darkness, beyond eternity
Majestic beauty unknown, to earthly flesh,
A blackened oracle looming. Beyond...

A journey shall lead us into the everlasting darkness...
Into the promise land unfulfilled.
Into the heart of the nights blackened soul,
The answer lies within...

Give praise to the nightsky,
Royal guard of this mighty kingdom, ever flowing...
Cold and dark forever...
Endlessly...

Gateway to parallel worlds of black,
Linked by power beyond mortal comprehension,
Absorbed...
From within the darkness beyond eternity.
