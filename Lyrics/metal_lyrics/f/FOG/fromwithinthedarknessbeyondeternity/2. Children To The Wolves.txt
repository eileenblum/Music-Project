We must rise and Slaughter the weak,
Abolish Innocence from the face of the earth.
Destroy the kingdom of god.
Children to the Wolves.

Sodomize the Innocent,
For we are the tyranny of all that is Evil!
Within the shadowed veil of death,
Vengeance upon thee.

And there shall be No Mercy!
Infinite our legions of death.
Far from the light of salvation.
As the chosen, we arise!

Lamb of God must be slaughtered.
Foreign the world into chaotic change,
Into the fiery blaze of war.

The power of darkness
now infecting the blood of this world.

We must rise and Slaughter the weak,
Abolish Innocence from the face of the earth.
Destroy the kingdom of god.
Children to the Wolves...
