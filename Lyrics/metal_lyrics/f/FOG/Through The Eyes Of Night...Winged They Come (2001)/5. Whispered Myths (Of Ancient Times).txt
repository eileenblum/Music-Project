Deep in selcusion
Away from the light
Amidst the beasts
Of this forest of darkness

Forgotten slumber
Enthroned in stone
Remembered not
Lost in time

In eternal slumber
Forbidden agony
Enchanted echo of time long ago
Existing still

Whispered myths
The whaling of this forest breeze
Lost souls of long ago
Never to return

The sun extinguished
Never to rise again
The sleepers will awaken
