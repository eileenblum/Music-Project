I can sense the changes occuring in me
Ever so slowly running it's course
I can feel it's venom
Burning within my blood

Crawling through my veins
Consuming my soul
I can feel it

Crawling through my veins
Consuming my soul
And I know with the seasons change
So shall I

As the memories of my life fade away
With each pasng moment
I am losing my mortality
My being my mind
Overcome by unquenchable thirst
And so it shall be

Granted the gift of immortality
With the passing of a single touch

The leech now assumes control
I can fell it
I am the one with darkness

Inflitrating my body
Binding us together forever
Blending us together forever
Blending who I am
With the parasite inside

Emotions die as the thirst grows stronger
Driven now by the instinct to kill
To satisfy the hunger

Passed through generations
Since the beginning of time
The lurker in the shadows
Waiting to strike

Unholy bonds of evil
Meshed with human flesh
Impure creation of the night set free

I can sense the changes occuring in me
Ever so slowly running it's course
I can feel it's venom
Burning within my blood

Not of this world
From dimensions unseen
A greater power
Of ancient knowledge and wisdom

The leech from a far has planted it's seed
I have been chosen

The first taste of crimson
Begins the craving
The hunger insatiable

Now overwhelming to the point
Of this mortals insanity
We are one
We are one

Tenthousand years have passed
In What seems to be an infinate instant
Bound and chained in shallow grave
Waiting for this moment to be reborn

The first taste of crimson
Begins the carving
The hunger insatiable

Now set free unholy resurrection
Satanis powers granted unto me
Extracting secrets
Known only to the dead
To sharpen the skills on necromancy

Killing to sustain infinate life
Blood is the power eternal
