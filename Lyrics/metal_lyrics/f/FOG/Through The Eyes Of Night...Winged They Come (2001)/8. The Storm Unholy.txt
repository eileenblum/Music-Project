Dark and endless stare of sister moon
Looking down from upon her throne
Ablaze in full and majestic bloom
Burning cold

Weeping tears of blood wrath and vengeance
Seething destructive embrace of fury
Elders od silent knowledge awaken
Lusting for war craving destruction

Unholy hordes will rise to destroy
Within the bitterness of freezing winds
Sister moon her halo ablaze
Looks upon the frozen wasteland

Winterspirits breath drives the snows of the storm
The darkness spreads her wings

Greezing flames
Scorch and consume
Marching armies
Of cold demonic hate

Mirrored image
Frozen celestial gaze
Astral constellation
Of darkness and doom

Unlocked are the gates of time and space
Sister moon rides upon her warthrone

Warm serene embrace of death
Calm the eye of the storm
Swirling vortex of infinate souls
Tormented forever now set free

The storm unholy

Dark and endless stare of sister moon
Looking down from upon her throne
Ablaze in full and majestic bloom
Burning cold

The storm unholy
