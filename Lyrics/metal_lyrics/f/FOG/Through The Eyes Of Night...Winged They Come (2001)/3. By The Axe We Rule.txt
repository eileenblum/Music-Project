Arctic cove which breeds our hidden lair
Across the sea of thousand swords
Wolven clan prepare for war
Wanderers of thy outer darkness
Set sail

All shall fall unto me
By this axe I rule
Frostbitten fury
As we cross the winter sea

Conquest on every shore
No armor fends our steel
Swords and axes bloodstained red
Legions of iron and steel
