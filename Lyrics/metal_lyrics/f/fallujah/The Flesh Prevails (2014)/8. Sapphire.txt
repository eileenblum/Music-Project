Iâve wanted this all along
A concrete beating heart
A landscape I can bleed up-on
This dark city my breeding ground

Nails within the darkened sand
Artificial light ascends
Clarity of vision breaks
The shackling of days ahead
Taken from the solace of home
Veins reclaimed by hardened stone

Take me from my solace
This dark cityâs mine again

Iâve wanted this all along
This dark city [2x]
My breeding ground

The streets are whispering

The hope is in my veins
Clawing &amp; deprived
A hopeful heart will waste
Every moment of precious time

Helpless as I watch my dreams divide

Iâve wanted this all along
A concrete beating heart
A landscape I can bleed upon
This dark city my breeding ground

Artificial light ascends
The path of which my heart accepts
