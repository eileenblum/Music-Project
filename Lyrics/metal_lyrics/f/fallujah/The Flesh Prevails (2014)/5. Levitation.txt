Drift off out of sight
Out of my mind
No hope
We need more time
I need more time

Scathing, breathing
For too long alone
Dreaming deeply far from hope

Will you levitate with me?
Face to face
Our nerves lost
I fear the nights ends

Nerves lost
Severed from limbs
Fearing daylight
Fearing the nights end
Consume me
Embrace me
Light breaks
White with fear
Pull me up from death
Pull me up to meet my end

Here suspended in air, entwined
Buried souls scathing light
Abandoning words lost to time

I pray for [2x]
Above the surface entwined
Just you &amp; I tonight
Wither away with me tonight
Levitate with me tonight

Scathing, breathing
For too long alone
Dreaming deeply far from hope

Will you?
Nerves lost
Severed from limbs
Fearing daylight
Fearing the nights end
Consume me
Embrace me
Light breaks
White with fear
Pull me up from death
Pull me up to meet my end

Here suspended in air, entwined
Scathing light
