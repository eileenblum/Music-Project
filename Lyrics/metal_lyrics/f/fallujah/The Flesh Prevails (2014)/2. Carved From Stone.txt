Drenched in sweat &amp; caged in the steel
Fall from grace temptress surreal
Skin carved from stone
The lust inside her bones

A damsel so content
The child of excess
Her skin in my control
Ignited all alone

As helpless as vermin swallowed whole
The pain ignites her
&amp; every desperate lustful bone
[2x]

Hold your tongue
Youâre mine tonight
Your flesh &amp; blood are
My prize

Skin carved from stone [4x]

Iâll control you if you like
Does it make you feel alive?
Does it numb the pain inside?
Does it make you feel alive?

Iâll control you if you like
Does it make you feel alive?
[2x]

Skin carved from stone [4x]
