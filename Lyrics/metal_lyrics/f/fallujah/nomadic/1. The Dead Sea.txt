Im breathing yet I fight for air
This tomb you've pulled me down
A nomad in this barren land
Your binds ahold of my desperate hand

The light that projects
Forth from your eyes
Sucks out the life that life that lies within mine
Somber and weak is heart of a slave
Emerge with dispirited hate

Bring me to my feet my rash lioness
Wash away all my pain
The hunger for more forced you out of that place
I was the light you would need

The light that projects
Forth from your mind
Sucked out the hope that lied within mine

I was the light you would need

Wanderer upon the dead sea
Nomad in this barren land.
Worlds away, my heart is gone
Take my desperate hand

Captive in self-loathing calm
A semblance of revenants haunting my thoughts
The temptress you were
The air between your bones is desolate and cold

I was breathing yet I fought for air
That tomb you pulled me down
You were falling to a dark abyss
I should have let you drown
