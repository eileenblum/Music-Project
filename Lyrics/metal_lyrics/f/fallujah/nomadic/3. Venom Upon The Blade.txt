Tempting my veins
With the venom upon the blade
The heart commanding the mind as a slave
Searching for hope in this desperate place
Can anguish control my fate?
Does the hatred inside numb infectious pain?
Hope is the myth of the weaker man's dreams
Searching for comfort and peace

Tempt my flesh
Take my breath
Wishing everything away
Take the venom from my veins

Wishing for death
To suffer in hell

I'd deny the gates
If they welcomed me

We are safely told
Believe in warmth of touch
We trust in others words,
But they are not ours

Whispers in the air
Bargaining for the soul
The venom upon the blade
Breaks the voices hold
