Ascension to Martyrdom

Descendant from the divine lineage of the gods
A bloodline of Merovingian origin
For the powers of thy father have all but gone stale
Awaken from dormancy I will be thy wrath
Manifest I will the all being power of my place
Masonic influence and bilderberg common race
Crucifixion of all the dissenters stands in the face
Of the incarnation of the thy gods body and breathe

Embrace the scorn of the earth

Ravage flesh of mother gaya, brings thy holy lords salvation
Ravaged flesh of mother gaya, be thy holy lords salvation

Prevail
Thralldom of those who the serpent claims
A prison, my domain
Passion, is this reign

Illuminate, my campaign
Divine right, of the kings

Servitude I manipulate the puppets in place
Of my blood, the masters descend
Podium, the kings lays his throne above all
Serfdom to the weak
This nation will be embodiment of thy lord
And with it shall his wrath unearth the gates of Babylon
The nations of the world will lay their heads on the ground
One world I command one world under god

Be thy serpentâs wrath

Formulate a treacherous plan
A curtain veils the indoctrination
Innocents blood spilled for the crusade
A symbol of progression brought to its knees
A horrific image
Depravity of the human race
Embodiment of the serpent, pointing the hand

Continental demoralization
Masonic sub-control
Perdition reigns upon Judas
Slain begets the wrongful kings
Service of the serpent condemns a peasant race to mind control
Implantations are the network for the silent peonage

Murder the rebellion of which I convict

Murder

Worship
