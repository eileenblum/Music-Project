Into eternity reborn, are those sacrificed to the gods.

Rid of the flesh god as delivered unto
It's vulagarities conjure on the 5 points of summoning
In the relics of the past is it's banner upheld

A demon from which the slave is bound to

Thirst quenched the demon sleeps
Cultivate my soul in it's dreams
And shall the demon feed
Cultivate immortality

Souls, plead for sacrifice to their lords,
And from the darkness where the Ancients spawned

Out of the darkness
Were the ancients spawned
Thirst, quenched the demon sleeps
Cultivate my soul in it's dreams
And shall the demon feed

Cultivate immortality
