By the guidance of the stars
I am Reborn
Said to beborn alive
Become one with the source of flourishment
Complex is acceptance of death

Conjuring my spirit forms. The devil becomes that of primitive importance
God is it's alpha to omega

Transcend
Become one with the source of flourishment
Become one with Acceptance of death

Filled with abhorrant precognition
Reform, an entity free in judgement
An architect of his own dominion
Irrelevant is the earthly logic of the supernatural
in the realm of my apparition

I become one with the universe

Spirit channeling. Possessed through the external self. Enlightenment can be felt
