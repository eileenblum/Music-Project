A breeding of coercion
Swarming hallucination
and the future of Eden overgrows

Formation of material hatched from organic creation
incubating the warmth of it's core for the Earth reborn

Atmospheres procreate the landscapes

Organic life forms spawned

Existence a hallucinated vision
Prosthetic and somatically flawed
Ritual sacrifice of Gaia's birth

Existence a hallucinated vision
Prosthetic and somatically flawed
Ritual sacrifice of Gaia's birth

Taming of the Earth
The forest's oxygen
[?]
Set the bloodlines for the demise of itself
Industrial contamination withheld

Born, the eccation of god
severed from the head of the exiled
[?]
