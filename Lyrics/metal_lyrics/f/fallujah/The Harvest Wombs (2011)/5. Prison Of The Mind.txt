Hold mastership
Harvested sight and perception
Fallen slave to hypnosis
Shapeless genesis

Allegory of
The cave

Darkness procreate
Uliminated Silhouettes

My god
Born in fire

Legend allegorical

I lay suppressed by this
Curse of warmth

True indulgence nevermore

Burn the
Stake of the subjugated

Live your life by the flame

Give
Into the restraint
Breath in the light
Of the demension

Formed in the
Light of creation [2x]

Live your life
By the flame

Give into
The restraint

Nowhere exists this
Macrocosm

Servant to it's
Light

Boiling of
Pale flesh

First sight of
An unknown

Do I indulge in new demensions or be a slave
To the walls I've accepted

Unforeseeable
Deviation

Harvested sight
And perception

Of the true world
In unknown darkness
