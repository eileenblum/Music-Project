You speak in your sleep
Tell me everything you feel

I promised you
But I must abandon you alone
I don't know where I will go
Can love carry us home?

The beauty in loss
Tragic thoughts in disguise
I'm worlds away from you, saving you
Reclaiming you

Failure as father
But I go where you can't follow
Eden is not a myth
Life of despair is something we can't accept

The stars will guide my path
To the soil's next breath
For now you must accept
I wander alone at no one else's expense

I must abandon you to the squalor
Starvation and sorrow

You speak in your sleep
As I set free every tear in me
Time has come and gone
But I'll always recall everything you were
