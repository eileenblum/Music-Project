Finally I've found my faith
Belief in the cause of your warm embrace
Now I have all that I want
But I can't help that I'm
Wishing I could change today
And all that I had hoped to gain
I'll meet you where land goes to end
I hope to find you there

Knowing I can't change today
You know that I was desperate
I'll meet you where land goes to end
Will you remember me?

Give me back my thoughts
Can I keep just this one?
Dig in your hands, I know what's done is done

What feels like lapse in time
Was when you were mine
Our souls collide in
The lessons and the strife

We move like ghosts
Fade into my arms

I watched this tragic love of mine
Dissolve and divide
Before my desperate eyes, running out of time

What feels like lapse in time
Was when you were mine
Our souls collide in
The lessons and the strife

I had found my queen
But she's forgotten me
