Our lust is face to face
Hearts beating with rage
You burned with pride with your skin in chains

Hearts beating far from death
How the nerves come alive in such decadence
I'm grasping harder with every breath

Alive again from the adrenaline
How does it feel in someone else's hands

She shrieks and speaks in tongues
Pure sin within her lungs
Narcotic rush in her submission

I'm acquiesced in full
Pleasure untellable
I'm the next sin that you indulge

I am a weapon [3x]
Built for sin

Begging for the punishment
Paradise within my hands
Alive from the adrenaline
In the paradigm of sin

Alive again, from the adrenaline
How does it feel in someone else's hands

Revel in the sacrilege
You're my goddess of blasphemy
Paradise within my hands
Alive from the adrenaline
