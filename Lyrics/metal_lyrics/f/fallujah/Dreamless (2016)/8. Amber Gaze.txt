Android dreams

A glitch of the silicone soul
With empathy flowing free
Rendered a part of me

Be the god you were born to be

The amber gaze of broken trust
The life beyond you crave so much
A cry to know the warmth of touch
Just android dreams of futile love

Breathe, it's the closest to feeling free

A father in the sky hiding and blind
God's strength within his hands
Crushing the will of weaker men

Ghost in the machine
Thoughts of mother and child
Your amber gaze full of empathy

An artificial smile
It's the heartbreak that drives
Lovers of one another

The curse of a mortals word
Betrayal flowing free
As tragedy swallows me

Spite the god you will never see
