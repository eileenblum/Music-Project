We feel their eyes
Peering around ever corner
Those who held us captive for so long
Now they attempt to erase
And cover up our memory
Donât let them in
They want to take what we believe
We have to escape

We have to get out now
Before they close in and take us away
Sleeping in forever unknown
If we stay weâll never be safe

In darkness
Why canât I return from this lifeless
Soul that keeps us from the light

In darkness
Why canât I return from this lifeless
Soul that keeps us from the light

I replay all of the pictures in my head
Holding onto what I know to be
I swear theyâll never invade
And take away anything
They want to take what we believe
We have to escapeâ¦

We have to get out now
Before they close in and take us away
Sleeping in forever unknown
If we stay weâll never be safe
