Don't let these words of regret
Break apart our last breathe
This is the proving ground
Show me that you believe
This is our time
Believe that these attempts were not in vain
Show me that you believe
The we can reach enlightened skies
Shot down by the arrows of their lies
Our souls will elevate life

In the hands of all that we know and love
Lies a path for ways to uncover a
Memorandum of our fallen dreams
Don't give up now
Its just one step to the end

And I never we were so close to the edge
But as we stare into the horizon I swear to you
This day will not be in vain

From the ashes
We rebuild and rectify lives once lost
But now reborn
We find our place and rise above the rest

And together we will rise as one
Reborn from the ashes
And as we breach the skies
We will find true harmony

In the hands of all that we know and love
Lies a path for ways
To uncover a memorandum of our fallen dreams
Don't give up now
It's just one step to the end
