All around, there are never ending barriers surrounding
But I choose to search for any sign of you

I'm losing hold on my faith
As the distance between keeps growing
I'm torn between my belief and reality
Pulled down, bound by gravity
I attempt to free myself
I will see the end of it,
All this suffering
Purging all the pain inside me
Looking out upon the Earth
I hear your voice calling me into the seaâ¦

Diving into darkness,
Leaving everything behind
Through the depths of many waters,
I won't stop until you I find.

All around there are never ending barriers surrounding
But I choose to search for any sign of youâ¦

No where else to runâ¦
So I dive down into darkness
Leaving everything behind
In the depths of many waters
I won't stop until you I find
