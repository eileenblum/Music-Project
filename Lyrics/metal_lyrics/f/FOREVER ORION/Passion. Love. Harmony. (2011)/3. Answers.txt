Wait for daybreak,
And it will swiftly come at last
The storm will calm
And in the stillness
Arms open wide
To the prospect of new light

Falling away
The sands of time disintegrate
Through the hourglass
Leaving a trace of the answers left be

How can I awake
With no promise of tomorrow?
This portrait world I view
Can't be all there is to see

So I wait for a crack in time
To open up and consume me
With darkness as my guide
Bringing a path to light

The echoes of voices now resound
(I hear a familiar cry)
Cut the ties that bound us to...
(Memories that bind us)

Wait for daybreak
And it will swiftly come at last
The storm will calm
And in the stillness
Arms open wide
To the prospect of new light
Leaving a trace of the answers left behind
