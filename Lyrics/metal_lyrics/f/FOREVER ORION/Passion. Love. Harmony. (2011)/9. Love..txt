Arrows fall
Showering over our blinded eyes
The promise of tomorrow
Forgotten and unkempt
But in our darkest hour
Light shines through
The curtain of our souls

Give our eyes to light,
Sunlight brings new motivation
Bring our hearts to life,
And awake us from our own temptations

Let the sky fall down to Earth
Cleansing away all this fury
Free your mind now this day is gone
A new foundation,
A chance to start again

Let it shine through the night
Donât let it fall away
In your sights, hold on tight
Keep it close until the end

Bring me back to dreams I once knew

Give our eyes to light,
Sunlight brings new motivation
Bring our hearts to life,
And awake us from our own temptations
