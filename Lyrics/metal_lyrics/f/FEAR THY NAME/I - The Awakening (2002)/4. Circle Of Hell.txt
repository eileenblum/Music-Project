[Music by: FEAR THY NAME]
[Lyrics by: FEAR THY NAME]

Can you feel the misery?
Can you hear the pain inside?
Open your eyes to watch the world
Coming down towards the end

Only pain is real
The dreams are alive
A confused mind is trying to rise
Deep in the woods there is the answer
The secular tree
Our glorious star...

Immortal life, eternal wish
As years go by we fall into the abyss
And when the mist rises in the sky
We shall watch the night conquers the day
To complete the final circle
The circle of hell...
The circle of hell...
The circle of hell...

They are seven deep inside
Seven demons under my eyes
When the keys are in the place
We will open the gates
To unleash the power within

Astral pentagram will show us the way
To complete the last and supreme art
Of world domination
By the nocturnal powers
An army of death
Will conquer... everlasting... Earth...

Immortal life, eternal wish
As years go by we fall into the abyss
And when the mist rises in the sky
We shall watch the night conquers the day
To complete the final circle
The circle of hell...
The circle of hell...
The circle of hell...

By the sign of the pentagram
We are under the circle of hell!
