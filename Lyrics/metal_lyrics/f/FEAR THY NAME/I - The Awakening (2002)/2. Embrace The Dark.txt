[Music by: FEAR THY NAME]
[Lyrics by: FEAR THY NAME]

Magic trees of mesmerizing wisdom
Are the witnesses of pagan ceremonies
Ancient ruins of glorious days
Summoning the secrets of yesterday
In the dark forest at night
Petrified voices roar
Statues of beings once alive
Undead creatures waiting for you!

Angels are falling
By the lightning of your black eyes
Shinning like the blood of the unlight...

Reincarnation is a mirage
As your soul burns in hell
Everything that was alive
No longer lives, all is dead

I feel and cannot touch...
I hear and cannot see...
Astral possession gathers in me
From this day to eternity
Connecting two worlds
With a single wish
Eliminating the weak
With his bestial sword

Angels are falling
By the lightning of your black eyes
Shinning like the blood of the unlight...

Reincarnation is a mirage
As your soul burns in hell
Everything that was alive
No longer lives, all is dead

Your darkest past is alive
Full of truths and misery
Put your life to an end
As you search for a new me
Start the engine of eternal life
Bring death to your knees
The bottomless pit is spiting fire
As your soul knows it's free!

We shall betray the light
Giving night a new start
A path to the unknown land
We shall embrace the dark...
