[Music by: FEAR THY NAME]
[Lyrics by: FEAR THY NAME]

Riding wings of fire
Through the blazing shadows
Burning souls of the unbelievers
Taking heaven granted
They're expecting death
But it's already coming
And will reap your head!

As you listen to me
It will rape your mind
You can feel, but you won't see
The unholy flames of thy...

A dark silluette
In a midnight fog
Comes out of the dark
Long velvet vests
Inside a secret room
An ancient soul behind
The true spirit of the night

As you listen to me
It will rape your mind
You can feel, but you won't see
The unholy flames of thy...

The door is open
And there I can see
The true essence of thee
A beautiful and a perverse site
Full of hopes and dreams
Of men's life...

While your wicked souls are still crying in despair
The only spectral passage remains open in its lair
In the wings of damnation you will look for me
To find the pure evil among
The mist of Avalon...
