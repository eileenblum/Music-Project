Here - there is no light
Here - there is no hope
Here - no birds sing
To be cursed a thousand times
Down here...

Here - the flowers rot
Here - the shadows dance
Here - you walk alone
To be cursed a thousand times
Down here...

Kiss the rotten hand of death
Forever you shall wander this earth
Down here it is so beautiful
