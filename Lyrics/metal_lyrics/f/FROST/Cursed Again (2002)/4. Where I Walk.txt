A valley of death
is where I walk
I feel the shadows
rake my spine
Rape of the dying
There is no life here...
many souls had been dragged
Screaming into the
bottomless depths

Curse where there names
Written in hell
There is no life here
I see the church, an old rotten church
Unused for centuries in this forgotten land
Rituals had taken place, and so many sacrifices
Untold by man, a valley of death is where I walk
(Darker than Satan...whiter than god!)
The moon laughs at me
From empty spaces
Lost times come
The unholy flame flickers in the wind
