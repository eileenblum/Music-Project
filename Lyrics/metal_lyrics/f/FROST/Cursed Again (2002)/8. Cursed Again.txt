Once again a glimmer
of hope burns away
Another part of me
rots again,  dies again
Back into the darkness
so lonely, I survive
Cursed again to wander,
to wander the shadows
So...so...so mysterious
I am blind, but yet I see
everything
One day I will rise
and pluck the thorn from my side
One day I will be laughing
laughing at you
Once again a glimmer of hope burns away
Back into the darkness...so lonely...I survive
