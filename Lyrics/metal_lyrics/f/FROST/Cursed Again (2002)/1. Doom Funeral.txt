A year has passed since the funeral
The smell of rotten earth
A blackened space and time
Write my name around a circle of fire
...In a pace of shadow

Take my black heart
It is a heart I never had
Fill me with the dust
Of a time long gone
In a place of shadow

A year has passed since the funeral
The funeral of doom

The air is rotting
