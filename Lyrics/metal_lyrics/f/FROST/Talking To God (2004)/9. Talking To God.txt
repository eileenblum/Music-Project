Dies erae
A falling star
Red like fire
Ripping the sky
Speaking in electric pulse

A voice within

Dies erae
Broken static energy
In a dreaming daze
Yet the eyes are awake
The waves, distorted
White noise harmony

Missing time
Talking to god?

I understand this code
An imitation of life
An imitation of nature
Show me the sign

Missing time
Talking to god?
