Visions
Of the apocalypse
A deep red vortex
Burned the sky
And mankind lies dying
And ten beasts arise
Waging eternal war
Forevermore

"From the sea he rises
Creating armies on either shore
Turning man against his brother
Till man exists no more"

The blossom all faded
The mountains quake before me
The hills melt to dust
And run into my spine
Where life has no value
Where you are forever alone
And the misery of life drowns you
One last time

When you are forever alone
Forever
