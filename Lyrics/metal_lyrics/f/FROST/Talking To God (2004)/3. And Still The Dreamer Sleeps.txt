A mind of a chaos machine
An ocean of thought
Forever churning
To live ,to dream to aspire

Wake up
Shouts the world of demise
Wake up
And still the dreamer sleeps

See the sleeping man
With the burning dreams
A thousand shadows soared
Up and out from his world

Polluted with madness
Polluted with demons

A mind of a chaos machine
An ocean of thought
A thousand shadows soared
Up and out from his world

And still the dreamer sleeps
