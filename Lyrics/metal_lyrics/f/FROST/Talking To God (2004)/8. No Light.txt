A dirty storm cloud
A murky darkness
Disaster
Grief

A whole ocean of tears
There is no counting them

And no light
Brothers will kill brothers

The misery, infinite

And no light
Brothers will kill brothers

A whole ocean of tears
The misery, infinite

And no light
Brothers will kill brothers

A dirty storm cloud
A murky darkness
Disaster
Grief
