From our mouths comes fire
The last star has fallen to earth
The sun has turned black

The sky is painted in shadow
The animals lay rotting
All life is dead

At the end
The end of earth
The final breath of life
Has faded

Locust storm like thunder
Our sea turns to poison
Fire eats the earth

The rivers run dry
The cry of mankind roars
As it slips into the abyss

At the end
The end of earth
The final breath of life
Has faded

Crossed over into shadow
Where evil never sleeps
It lurks, waiting

The final cold twist of a knife
A rope around your neck
A betrayal
The final splinter through your heart
The return to beyond

At the end
