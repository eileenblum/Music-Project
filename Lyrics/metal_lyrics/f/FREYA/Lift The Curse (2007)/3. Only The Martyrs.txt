Beneath a boiling sky
Tears stream from upturned eyes
The day for which I prayed
All doubt is swept away

Wrath of the almighty
Through red clouds judgment pours
Angels draw gleaming swords
As they descend

[chorus:]
No more forgiveness
No more reprieves
Only the martyrs
Will be received through heaven's gates

Plagues, wars, and disasters
Preludes to the horrors
The screams from the abyss
Echo our own
Now nothing lies concealed
Every vicious act revealed
The fallen condemned to writhe in the flames
