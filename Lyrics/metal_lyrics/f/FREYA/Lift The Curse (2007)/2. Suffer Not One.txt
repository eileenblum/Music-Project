Crushed to dust
Beneath the hammer pulverized
Under time's wheel
Creations all crumble
Bloodlines end down through the ages
The deeds and names are the only
Things that will ever sustain

[chorus:]
Suffer not one
Demon to live
Punish with steel
It's the way of flesh

The wolf age
The wind age

All hail the end
