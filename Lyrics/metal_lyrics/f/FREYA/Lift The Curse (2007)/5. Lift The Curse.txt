God in Heaven
Let me die or let me win
Straws upon straws
Won't break beneath the weight
What's the lesson
Of all this suffering
A test of will
To be endured
Till the day that the gauze
Peels from my eyes
Lift the curse from my life
Free me from this misery

Scars upon scars
Blood dries across my wounds
