Each life a miracle
Created by the divine
Breathed into existence
For a destiny perfectly designed

[chorus:]
With the freedom to decide
Which of the paths to take
From this world they lead
Into the next and on into
To eternity
For the unity of souls
Or the unending torment
That waits within the flames

Kindness and fairness or the
Misery of the selfish and vicious
In the end each reap what is sown
Eternal reward for unending sorrow

[chorus]

Weave or cut
The threads of life
