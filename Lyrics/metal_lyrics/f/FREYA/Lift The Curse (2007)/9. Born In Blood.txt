Born in blood for Ragnarok
Into the world beyond the womb
In the light of the first moments
I know that I'll live well
Each trial I outlast
My soul passed every test

I am the sum
Of all the struggles that I've overcome
Draw strength from them
Push ahead until I've won

A heart beat from
My soul's release
In the halls of my fathers
At last at peace

Born into eternal life

Born in blood for Ragnarok
Into the world beyond the tomb
In the light of the shining moment
I know that I lived well
Each trial I outlast
My soul passed every test

Born into eternal life

Valhalla shimmers through spectral light
