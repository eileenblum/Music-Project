Strands ripped from the web of life
Broken tangled and torn
Threatened from the first breath we draw
Starting the day we are born
In haste and in avarice
The defenseless are left overpowered
No way to flee from the murderers
That hunt us relentlessly

One by one
Erased out of existence
As fast as we can swim
As deep as we can dive
The waves above are
Boiling with our blood
Among the few
Who survive

Panic to terror
Sorrow into rage
Killing us down to the last
Down to the very last
