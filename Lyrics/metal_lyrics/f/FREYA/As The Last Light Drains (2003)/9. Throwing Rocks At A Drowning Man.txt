Won't kiss the mouth that mocks the pain that's inflicted
Though that I could trust but I was tricked instead
Won't embrace the one who burdens me until I snap
Left to languish bleeding caught inside this trap
Throwing rocks at a drowning man
Everyone should try it
No point to struggle anymore
The one weapons that sharpens every time it's used
That venomous tongue is always eager to abuse
When everything around me starts to tip and fall
Vicious when I'm down winds up to kick me when I crawl
Throwing rocks at a drowning man
Everyone should try it
No point to struggle anymore
It's all just useless now
I can't keep it up
It's just useless now
Drains my energy
I won't waste my time no
