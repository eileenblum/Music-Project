Glasseating smile
Stretched on mouth
Have to learn to accept all the pain
It never matters
How hard that I struggle
All my efforts seem in vain
Swallow the shards
Fate takes a hammer to my dreams
Swallow the shards
Every try just ends in flames
Make a wish and watch it smashes to pieces
Get so close to fall straight down
All my hope is fading
Contemplate what follows
Emptiness and sorrow are all that waits
Ahead for me
