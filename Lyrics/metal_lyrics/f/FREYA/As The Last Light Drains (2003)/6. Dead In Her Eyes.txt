The wounds decay inside my soul
Pain harsher than any that I've known
Realized it simply is what it is
There's just no way to win
This is what it is to yearn
To struggle
To stumble
TO crawl
No miracle comes to save me
Misery consumes and chains
I fought for as long as I could
With my back against the wall
Doesn't matter what I try
I'm dead in her eyes
Takes and takes and never gives
Drinks so much blood that I barely live
Of A vampire I am captive
Within her spell
No way to win
