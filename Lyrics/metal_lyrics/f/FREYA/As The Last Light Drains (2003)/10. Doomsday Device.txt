Let there be lust if there's no love to feel
Let there be war if there's no peace that's real
All sentiment drains from my consciousness
The agony boils through my veins
Fight to keep my hopes alive
The despair starts to crush them
Bloodshed and pain
No justice but my own
All reason lost and dissolved
In the madness
Axe age, sword age
Until the world is smashed
