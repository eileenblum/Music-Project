Consequences if I do
Consequences if I don't
Maybe I should roll the dice
What's the difference anyway
No matter which of the path I choose
It feels like I am damned to lose
I risked it all just on the chance that I could win
Negative infinity
Swallows down my soul
There's nothing that can hurt me
Nothing anymore
I lose again
Torn into forever more
No peace inside or past the door
Disconnect and push away
Further and further everyday
The coldness sinks into my bones
Accept I'm doomed to be alone
Hanging from my fingertips Until I slip into
Negative infinity
Swallows down my soul
There's nothing that can hurt me
Nothing anymore
