I'm trapped under the weight of what is not
Tortured by what can't be changed
Never feel the way that I feel
Just a step away
But there's a million miles of distance
Just thought when I awake in my mind
When I walk alone I can see her when I close my eyes
Just to have her haunt my dreams
I am crushed under the weight of what's not returned
