Down in flames
It all falls
Everything that I fought for
Proceed with abandon
What's inside is all that's left
The reward for my sacrifice
It's scron and a fist full of crumbs
Gave everything that I had and more
Despite it I am still denied
Run Away
Get as far from the wreck
as I can get
Waded through
Broken glass
As the garbage rains on me
Watch as the serpents smile
From shadows they leer at me
On my lifes blood they thirst to feed
Refuse to fall despite my wounds
Now my sorrow turns to something else
