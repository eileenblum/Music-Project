The frozen ground beneath me
To mortal wounds I succumb
All of the pain is ending now
The fallen surround me
I'm lifeless in the scarlet snow
My place beyond is now assured
Send her down to me
Grant this final wish
May she claim me for her own
As the last light drains
Looks into my eyes to see
That the time here is over
Sees all my worth and draws me near
She whispers softly to me
The halls of what await you
Cross the bridge of light into eternity
Drink down the details
Hold them in my heart
Shapphire eyes
Flaxen braids
She is my salvation
As the last light drains
