This misery that holds me under
Won't let me get away
One day you'll see that this could be perfect
So I'll hold on
Can feel it waking up inside of me now
It would be so easy just to bring it to life
I always wanted for this to happen
Now you'll finally see that I'll always be the one
Is there a chance
Don't get my hopes up
But it seems it's finally here
Could light break through the grey
Can my wish be coming true
Could this be real or is it all just in my head
