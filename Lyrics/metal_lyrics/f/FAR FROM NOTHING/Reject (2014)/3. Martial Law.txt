[feat. Steven of Watchers]This is martial law
Your time is over
I will see you fall
Ashes to ashes
This is martial law
Death is coming for you
Coming for you

Can you hear them marching along?
Their stomps are shaking the Earth
Do you see
The light behind the mountain?
Behind the mountain

You know you'll never pull me under
As long as I stand strong
I've been waiting forever to kill you
To kill you

I see you wandering in the dark
Extermination

Brothers &amp; sisters deceased
Bodies lay by the street
Rest in peace

[Steven]
If you want me you'll never take me alive
Beg for mercy as I gouge out your eyes
Empty promises make a broken nation
Hope was given but was never received

I can hear them trudging along
One Earth shaking stomp after the other

Do you see the light behind the mountain?
Behind the mountain
Smell the scent of burning flesh

You know you'll never pull me under
As long as I stand strong
I've been waiting forever to kill you
To kill you

Extermination

This is martial law
Your time is over
I will see you fall
Ashes to ashes
