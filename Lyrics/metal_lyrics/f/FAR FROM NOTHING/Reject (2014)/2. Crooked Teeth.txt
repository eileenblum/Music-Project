These crisis cries for this holy cleanse to rid this world of your filth
I am here to make amends my sick thoughts request in blood
I'll take that bitch that lies below shackled in chains
Her punishment is death, claimed by the blade
Off with her head I scream at the top of my voice
The stage is ready for the fucking show

Lead the liar to the guillotine
Place her head between the wooden beams
&amp; pull her hair &amp; make that bitch scream
Pull the rope &amp; let the blade release

I watched her head roll from her body
I watched her twitching limbs
Her lifeless corpse arouses my amusement
I watched her head roll from her body
I watched her twitching limbs

I hope he was worth a fuck
Because everyone I gave you, you used up
You fucking bitch

I hope you rot in Hell [4x]
You fucking bitch
