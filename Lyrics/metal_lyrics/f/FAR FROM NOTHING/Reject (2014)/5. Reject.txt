I hate the memories these streets leave every night
Every night it's the same damn lies
It's about time that I fucking leave [2x]

I hate this place
I lay in this bed wasting away

Thinking of you
Every God damned day
Thinking of you

I got my head down in the back ground
I'm trying to fucking fade out
Cause I don't belong here
I don't belong here
&amp; my hands are free &amp; my heart hurts
&amp; when you speak it just makes things worse
This space in the bed will be empty forever
When you're here it's supposed to feel better

How many friends do I have to fucking lose
Before I jump off of this chair attached to a noose
How many friends do I have to fucking lose
Before I lose you
How many friends do I have to fucking lose
Before I lose it all [2x]

I'm done with this place
With this place
[2x]

I hate the memories these streets leave every night
I hate the memories you left me with
I hate the memories these streets leave
I hate you [3x]
I hate this place [4x]
