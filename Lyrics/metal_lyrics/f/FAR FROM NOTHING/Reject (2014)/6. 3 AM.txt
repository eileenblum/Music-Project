Nothing can save you now
You are a swine
In a dog cage
Dog cage
When you're face down
Face the facts [2x]
I am your Hell

Tonight you'll fucking pay
This is what you get for lying to me [2x]
Cut the source of the damned disease
This is what you get for lying

I believed in all the lies
You are a swine in the dog cage
To the butcher's house
I hope you don't mind he will take this knife
To carve your face
While you're awake

Keep screaming
"Don't leave me alone"

&amp; I love the way
You scream
Like someone's listening
Or even cares

Keep screaming [3x]
No one fucking cares [2x]

I am your Hell [2x]
I'm in your head [2x]
