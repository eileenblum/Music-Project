Don't push your bullshit on me
How would you feel if I pushed my beliefs on you?
You'll never understand my pain
So shut the fuck up

If the Devil was real
He would have claimed me a long time ago
&amp; God if you're there
Hear me whenever I scream for help

Bow down
Let your crown hit the ground
Nothing can hide you from these lies you kept inside
So give me a reason
Not to call you out on your bullshit lies

How could you feed lies to a broken mind
Look inside the mirror
Take a deep breath

We are all alone
When your judgement comes
You will burn

Enslaved, get off your knees
Betrayed, you'll never take that to your grave

If you live here
You die here
You live here
You live in Hell
So fucking dig your grave

Bow down
Let your crown hit the ground
Nothing can hide you from these lies you kept inside
So give me a reason
Not to call you out on your bullshit lies

Bow down
Let your crown hit the ground
[2x]

You fucking push your beliefs upon me
But I will not conform to you ways
Your conniving &amp; judgement gets me nowhere
So back the fuck off

How could you feed lies to a broken mind
Look into the mirror
Take a deep breath

If the Devil was real
He would have claimed me a long time ago
&amp; God if you're real
Hear me whenever I scream

Call me the Antichrist

Fuck
