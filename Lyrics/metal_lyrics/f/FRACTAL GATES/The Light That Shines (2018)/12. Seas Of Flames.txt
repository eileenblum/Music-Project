Nothingness from this place of no return
These are the remnants of a realm left forgotten in demise
The days unread, fading all memories from above (far above)
Merging the sides of another world
Nothing left of me
This prison falls for a last breath
Now I understand, now I am One with Them
Towards these halls of Life I dwell within
Reaching the fields of forsaken knowledge
Breaching through the secrets of Time
Breaching the streams of Time

We were the same, sharing the seeds of a newborn sun
Circular scriptures written on the visions of Past

We strove the same
We wandered alike through the Seas of Flames
Last pieces of fear
Restraining our mind in our inner Self
Into this maze of ruins
Feeding the air of horizons red
Feeling the edge of Life, of Another Self

Beneath the waves, away from this tide
Believing our fate was the link to a lightless star
Deep within lies our realm of a distant sign
Leading our Self burning through the night

We'll breach our lifeless pain
Leaving all fears behind
We'll reach the Seas of Flames
Unleashing the dream once left to die
