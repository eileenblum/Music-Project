Wherever hope fades, we'll embrace it with strength
Still the future is ours to regain
Whoever shall drain the power of your will
Remain on the shores of tomorrow's fate

Our reign will erase their trails
Erase all their trails

Across the distance
Relieving from our pathway within this maze
Above the oceans searching for an answer to be displayed
We dive ablaze

Infinity will lead our way
Into the flames of a new day
Fields of psychic waves feed our dreams
With the seeds of our veil
Infinity will be our name
Revealing projections of all beings
(Revealing perceptions of all beings?)
Hollow forces as our destiny
Reaching a new tale

So different is this light beyond
Where refractions seem to cast a shine on their own

Infinity will lead our way
Into the flames of a new day
Fields of psychic waves feed our dreams
With the seeds of our veil
Infinity will be our name
Revealing perceptions of all that remains
Hollow forces as our destiny
Reaching a new tale
