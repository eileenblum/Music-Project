Oblivion upon us
Delirium breaking through the flaw
Lost into the abyss
Held within nocturnal laws
We aim to set free

Gathering our will
Deepening our might
Hope left burning
Consuming our mind

Incinerating what we all defined
Rebuilding the stream
Revealing who we are
Obliterating all the lives we lied
Refuting the dream
Revealing who we are

Everdrifting away
Dreams apart

Revealing who we are
