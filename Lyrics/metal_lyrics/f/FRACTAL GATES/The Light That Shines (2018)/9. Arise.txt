Drill to ascend
Reveal the unknown
We're free beyond death
This will breeds tomorrow's fall
We storm our reign
Haunting from beyond
Feed the unveiled
Inhaling from the core, find our pulse

Drowning until the end
Forlorn state of mind
Burning deep within
Seeking the wind that binds

Above the abyss
Thriving through our time
Beside the solace
Yearning for a sign

We will arise
For the age to come

We'll leave these rays for another rain
We'll lead the streams of tomorrow's fall
Forever following the realm defining our core
Motionless fates marching to our call
Relieving within the Seas that Drown
