Within the circles of euphoria
The signs are moving over and over
Burried are the seeds of utopia
Blurred are the fates of our night

Forlorn fields a new dawn will rise
Burning fully, reaching closer

Fallen all the way
Reaching the outside

Chasing the line
Freeing our minds
Achieving the stream of a new day
Reading the sight
Riding our path
Bringing life to a new state
