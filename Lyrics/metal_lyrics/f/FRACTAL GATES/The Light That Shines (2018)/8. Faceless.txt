Right when the winds end howling
Revealing the maze
Unfolding a realm born ablaze
Drilling through the winter's gloom
Before this dull bright mist covers me
Is insanity calling me ?

Growing under relentless fall
I see their faces
Receeding in dismay
When the cold seems to fade
Where the storm yet remains
Hidden within, risen as one
Releasing the I

From this distance I found you
From this distance I sense the beats of your heart
Still frozen into the veil, untied to time
Faceless yet in flames
Igniting eyes of the tide
Dwelling through the chimera
Staring at the stream of life

Shapes of the Living
Marching towards our new dawn
Reaching the shores of tomorrow
Where there's nothing left of us
Nothing left

Merging with our fate, faceless
Faces of Flames
