On the edge of life I lay
So high afar

Falling over
Upon the distance of another day
Soaring stronger
Rebuilding the fields of hope that failed
Rememberance, defining the living we'll stare
Forever perceiving the limitless waves

One shadeless night for another day
Riding on the signs
Flashback of their call
We are under way
Wandering within storms
Before the sunrise, before the dawn will evade
Striving on this side for another day
Far beyond their core we are not the same
We know the way
We share the same Breath of Life

Recalling their cold
On our way to behold a new strain
Feel the shimmer rays
