Believing the reason
Forgetting the truth
Unleashing the after
Together under
Concealed forever
Drown in the distance
These overwhelming reflections unknown

We see the rythm get through
Within a burning thunder
Reveals the magic of their ruins
We feel the power all on us

Down in through the Ancient world
This is where we all sink
On the outer shores
Reaching encounters
We are the ones
Dwelling faceless

Within a burning thunder
Gathering still while I stand
One last time
Released unsunken
Within the dreams of solace
Dawn erased our daylight rays
One more trail
Reborn we enter

Behind this silence where life soars
To relive our healing All as I
Behind this silence where life soars
To relive our healing
Bound by time
