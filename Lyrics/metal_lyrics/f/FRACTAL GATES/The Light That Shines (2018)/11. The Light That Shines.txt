The place we live in
The change we drain on again
Persue the becoming
Behold the tale that they all sustain
I've been looking through me
Senseless, they would prevent the wake

Is this the end of our fate
Or a newborn dawn
Is this the end of our faith
On the tide of another fall
I whish I could remain stronger
Where the tide is gone
I whish I could wander deeper

I dive, bound to the core
I soar, burning further
Perceiving at last the light that shines inside of us
I dive, bound to the core
I soar, burning further
Perceiving at last the light that shines inside of us
