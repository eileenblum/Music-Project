With this rain, they called me
Repulsing their streams right onto my way
These fields are turning to grey
Inside my own veins

These sights of illusion
Overwhelm the state of mind we were in
Reaching the borders for another journey to find
These drops of deliverance
Lead our wings, lead our might
To new horizons
Transcending far away
Reaching to collide

Somewhere behind, somewhere tomorrow
On the edge of delusion
Somehow the will flows
We feel the afterglow

This is the end of all things, of all time
All what's left has fallen, turned to dust

Solar dreams ignited
Far beyond
Solar fields enlightened
Drifting to the shores ablaze

We are the ones
We are the ones who dream
Lost within, drowning inside
Stuck in this life falling appart

Reborn, unbind
Stuck in this realm, dreaming of life
