The day is turning to night 
Burning rays drown in ashes 
In the skylight figures shade 
The prophet was right, it's the End 

The mountains are trembling 
The seas boil in rage 
Heavens glow crimson haze 

The light is starting to fade 
The pale erases the wounds of my mind 
The pulse is rising around me 
The waves of life drain and fuse in my heart 

I'm enthralled by the Reverse Dawn 

On my side, the sun clears to black 
On my veil, fire exhales 
Overwhelmed in serene daylight 
I leave wide alive 

On my trail, the storm is of rain 
Drops of freedom defining my timeline 
I'm gone in the strains of solace 
To arise 

On my side, the sun clears to black 
On my veil, fire exhales 
Overwhelmed in serene arrays 

The Gate is closing behind 
Morning rays burst the vastness 
To the skyline I remain
