Dark days
Sanity gone
Still it tries to drain my soul
Am i the one insane?
a call from above
follow the delphian skies !

blood rains
the birth of our fall
fatality death (the) only observancy
bow to your newborn gods
follow the delphian skies !

it came out of the night
out of the night
to save me
shivering my brain

bitter taste
so many haunting cries
rebellion

one day one night
striving in the sunless skies

one way one might
you are the chosen one

one day fighting it through my way to feel the prize of our true inception
one night only one way to break the circle...... of their programmed extinction

Its the sign !

This bloody curse
feeds my mind
Still it seems to plague while its reaching by
i'm hypnotised ?
now i'm dead ?
(its) the message
follow the delphian skies !

i barely try
so many die
it came to quell from the nightside star
how could this be while we learnt the liiies
we are born to survive ?

it came out of the night
out of the night
to save me
shivering my brain

bitter taste
so many haunting cries
so many haunting cries

one day one night
striving in the sunless skies

one way one might
you are the chosen one

one day fighting it through my way to feel the prize of our true inception
one night only one way to break the circle...... of their nighttime raaaage

its the sign !

Dark ways
Sanity gone
Still it tries to drain my soul
Am i the one insane?
a call from above
follow the delphian skies !

blood rains
the birth of our fall
fatality death (the) only observancy
bow to your newborn gods
regeneration in the delphian skies
