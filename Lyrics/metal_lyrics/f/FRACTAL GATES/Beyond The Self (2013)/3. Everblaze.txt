Feel the blaze afar 
Open your mind 
Reobtain what you once were 
Tear your hate apart 
Untrust your might 
Unleash your abiding rays 

Drown me out 
Bring me down 
Free us all, burn us into the moonlight 
Be our reign of flames 
Blow me out 
Take me down 
Only yourself can save us from blinding 

Be our day, our new life 
Retrieve the sense of our realm 
Arise, stream our trail 
Revive the source of tomorrow 
Spin the rail of our soul 
Behold the dreams of the afterglow 

On the shores of reliance 
Lies a brighter state of slumber 
Across the veil of our own existence 
Alive yet silent 
Rain flows in our veins 
Seething in the heart 

Feel the blaze afar 
Open your mind 
Reobtain what you once were 
Tear your hate apart 
Untrust your might 
Unleash your abiding rays
