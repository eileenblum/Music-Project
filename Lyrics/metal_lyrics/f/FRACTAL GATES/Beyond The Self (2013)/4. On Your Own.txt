Some pray to appease desires 
Imploring some mercy 
Others simply cease to hope 
And drown in false control 

To feel the messiah 
Shall not make you cross the sign 
So fierce, so relentless 
But it shall not raise you out 

Purity is in yourself 
Don't seek it, don't trust their lies 
Believe in your sense, not their lines 
This flame that burns in your heart 
The answer is in yourself 
Don't dream it, don't close your mind 
Live on your own 

On your own, follow the tracks you long 
Don't care where the others go 
On your side, create your own defiance 
Answer the call 

Find the stream, find your own way 
All alone 
Wherever glooms are blowing 
Step beyond 
Underneath tomorrow, lies your core 
Hear the call 
Align the seeds of your strain 
On your own 

On your own, follow the tracks you long 
Don't care where the others go 
On your side, create your own defiance 
Answer the call 

Purity is in yourself 
Don't seek it, don't trust their lies 
Believe in your sense, not their lines 
This flame that burns in your heart 
The answer is in yourself 
Don't dream it, don't close your mind 
Live on your own 

Some pray to appease desires 
Imploring some mercy 
Others simply cease to hope 
And drown in false control 

To feel the messiah 
Shall not make you cross the sign 
So fierce and relentless 
Yet you shall not raise the night
