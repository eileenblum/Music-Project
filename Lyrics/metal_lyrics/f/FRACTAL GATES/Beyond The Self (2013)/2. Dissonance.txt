No sign of humanity 
In these evil might 
Unconscious minds possessed by hate 
Our leaders are baffled blinds 
Translucent oligarchy exempt from all kind of mercy 
A compromise of harshness and recklessness 
Justice as part of their lies 

Deicide and tyranny are our common shrine 
We cannot sustain any more of this 
Bound in allegiance to drown, they rule like a plague 
Stuck in seeds of desire 

Hypnotized by broadcasting, false claims 
Mesmerized by dull ideals made of grey 
Scenes of crowd to pretend we're dwelling democracy 
Synthesized self-heralded government 

No sign of humanity 
In these evil might 
Unconscious minds possessed by hate 
This is the time to arise 

The seasons are losing their sense 
In faceless rhyme 
Crimes are invading each place 
From north to south it feels the same 
Our sun falls behind clouds of haze 
The millennium is casting its night 
So will their tidal reign 
Scheme of deny, screams of a million who rise 

Our march is on its way, our march yells side by side 
Reunited in rawness 
In the trail of morale and faith 
Dreaming of hope for Mankind 
We will reap your empire of pain 
Repeal your reliance on war and gain 
We will raze your design 
And erase your demise 
Hear the sound of dawning 

Hypnotized by broadcasting, false claims 
Mesmerized by dull ideals made of grey 
Scenes of crowd to pretend we're dwelling democracy 
Synthesized self-heralded government
