Scarlet stains the nightfall 
Bright rays, elusive 
Fearless power behaviors drift by my side 

Dream or real, it's not clear 
But the scare drills inside of me 
Outlines still my motions 
And drag me to the clouds 
An arcane source of energy stirs in my soul 

Is this the place where we all die 
Or are revived? 

The creatures seem to foreknow me, literally 
Since I was born 
In a psychic way we even communicate 
Their reasons are mine 

Resources depleted 
Forests and wildlife disentrailed 
Compassion disproved 
Somehow we lost the trail 

Invariably we choose to break the natural harmony 
We never wonder why so many cry 
Solitude spreads like a plague 
To the realm of organic strains we are parasites 
All we long turns grey, all around... 

Losing my name, purified 
Into the realm of a greater life 

Invariably we choose to break the natural harmony 
We never wonder why so many cry 
Solitude spreads like a plague 
To the realm of organic strains we are parasites 
All we long turns grey 

Losing my name, unified 
Into the realm of greater days
