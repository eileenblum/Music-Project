So we part ways 
Turning our source and our regrets 
Reaving our might 
This tide recalls our soul down by the sea 

We were lonely drops in a reverse wave 
Pretending our life was innocent 
Deceived by our eyes, all we knew was pain 
Sinking aside 
This pulse in our heart should have warned us then 
And showed us no one was sovereign 
Perceiving a war like a vital state 
Justice was blind 

So we just fade 
Into profound glooms of cyan 
Where the stream binds 
This side covers our soul down by the sea 

Last signs of fire drift and bounce 
Behind our trail 
Blazing rays vanish in red glows 
Blown by forces unknown 
We dissolve 

Will the flows of time strand the fields of our realm? 
Will Ether bewitch us? 
Perfection's gone, but our season still stands 
Burnt yet alive we are 
When I'll join your mind in the reach of our fate 
Within strains of daylight 
Absolve your past, no reprieve shall die vain 
Merge, shine beyond 

So we remain 
Into dismal blooms of cyan 
Safe in our shroud 
This ride was our last impulse by the sea
