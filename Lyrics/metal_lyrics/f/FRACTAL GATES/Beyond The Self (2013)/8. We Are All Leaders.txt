You decide for our fate 
You decide for our fall 
We decide to stand and disobey 
You determine who knows 
You determine who sees 
We decide to leave your prophecy 
Your embrace is a lie 
Your discourse, unwise 
You completely breath insanity 
Haunted by gain 
Controlled by your aim 
You're nothing more than a plague 

Inside of me, I now hold a way to behave 
Deep, inside of me 
I have found a stable force to behold 
Don't pretend to save me 
Your crimes are the source 
When you'll cloud yourself 
The circle will be complete 

Reverence, dignity 
Your sense of acting is gone 

For we are no more blind 
We are awakened 
Your cycle of disgrace 
No longer thrive 
For we are unified 
We are all leaders 
We shall take back our world 
And blow you out 
Before the dawn 

You define who lives, judging in silence 
Hidden behind luxurious dreams 
You crucify your fears, burning innocence 
Insensitive, unaware 

Power, influence, disease 
The equation lies still 
No matter how strong you are 
In the end you drown 
Honour, reliance, glory 
The fire will never decrease 
This is the path you engage all 
Your rage is inborn 

No place to flee us now 
Your once empire's drilled 
Your gatherings done 
Your gallows are on the line 
For we are unified 
We are all leaders 
We shall take back our world 
And blow you out from our ground
