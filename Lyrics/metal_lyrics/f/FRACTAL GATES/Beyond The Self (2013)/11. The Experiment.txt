A pale shivering Hunter 
Seeds my fearsome hurt 
Pours in my gaze 
Nightmarish hate 

Far from Earth 
Lost in the Abyss 
Plague from Hell 
Sole in the Unseen 
Raped from Her 
Slight in the Mighty 
Far from Sun, we lurk Here 
Evil and myself 

A pain came from nowhere 
Feeding my inner blur 
Mourning in my veins 
Apathetic state 

As I dare reopen my eyes 
A long, thin metallic arm 
Descending straight towards my neck 
On its end stands a sharp spear 
That drills my skin 
Then inserts in my spine a frozen mist 
Insane situation when the hangman says: 
"Don't be afraid of what you can't explain." 

A pale calling glimmer 
Heals my fading nerve 
Maybe the end 
Of the Experiment 

For What? 

Strained to feel 
Full of void 
Blended with 
Dust of loss 

I wake back, somewhere near my dwelling 
Wishing that it was just another dream 
I cross my hand on my nape fleetingly 
Will my fingers touch a wound or a virgin skin?
