On the reach of the night 
Beyond your sense 
On the stream of your mind 
Your Kind we're watching 
Your wars lead you to a sure destruction 

You're the seeds of your own demise 
Within yourselves 
Can't you see your homeworld in fire? 

Reason shall rise 
Once you soar in its sunset 
Your prison could fall apart 
Grey won't drown 
Heal the sane, cherish the sharing 
The moving abides to thrive 

Where timeless falls in motion, 
Standing life and dawn 
Become the sons of instant 
Untie your soul 

On the reach of night 
Beyond your sense 
On the stream of your mind 
Your Kind we're watching 
The closure deeply lies within yourself 
Come, come into the Grail 

Where timeless falls in motion, 
Standing life and dawn 
Become the sons of instant 
Unbind your soul
