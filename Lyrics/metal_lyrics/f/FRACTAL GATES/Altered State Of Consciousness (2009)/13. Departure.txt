Still cold air
No motion
No pain

Frail sense we are longing
Pale sound, be my breath
Lone souls, we behold
Where you'll go

Where we're gone
I can't see anymore
Where we're gone
I can't feel anymore

Afraid to suffer
I can't be
Afraid to slumber
I can't leave
There forever
I can't be the same since I'm gone
Since I'm dead
