Stained of my norm
Forlorn name
Motion mourns
Words unsaid

Lies

Soil my fate
In her hands
Voil mt veil
Inertia

Silent bliss
We are to feel alive
Orphan leaves
We are to feel alike
Hollow shield
We have no inception

Lies
Soil my fate
Ignorance
Lies
Void my veil
Inner End
