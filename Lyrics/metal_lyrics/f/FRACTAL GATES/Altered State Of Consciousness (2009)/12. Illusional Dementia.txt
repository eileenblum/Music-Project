Blood stains coming through me
The fallen preacher's words
Bizarre reverie
Burning phoenix
Shoxn in seven stars
Dark visions
I fall

Blindness, I'm breathing
Delirium so They say
the same lies of living
The same cries of (the) fallen
The sacred stars of dominion
Descent for crowning
Twelve planets lead the way

This kingdom doest not die !
Mysteries...
...of Splendor

I saw Them
Turning around, strangely coming to me
This pale sight
Departure
To find my way in this maze of litany
Deceiver

[Chorus]

Some things seem clear to you
But these invocations open a pathway
When you think you are wide awake
You dream and they walk away

Till the end
Visions... of a distant life
Till the end...

Blood stains coming through me
The fallen preacher's words
Bizarre reverie
Burning phoenix
Shoxn in seven stars
Dark visions
I fall

[Chorus]

Dementia
Illusional Dementia
Illusion, illusions...

Suffer
And witness
The fall
Till the end
Illusional... Dementia
