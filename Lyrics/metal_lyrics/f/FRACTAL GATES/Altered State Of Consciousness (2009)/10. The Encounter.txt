Upsetting falling Force
Under unusual overcast skies

Fearfully your eyes follow the oddness
Disappearing behind menacing hills
Silently approaching
Feeling your quivering heart
Four emerging shapes from the  mist
Your trembling gaze they contemplate

Why are you there
In your paralyzed self
And the reason you lay amongst Them
Shall the blood flowing through
Their sorceries be yours ?

Reborn in this lie
Bewitching vanishing force
And now you believe in God
