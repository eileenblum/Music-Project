A vast inner sea
Devoid of life
A moonless night leads
My steps to the white

Save me
From these senseless days
To flee

Bring me
To behold the morning star
To reach...

To reach the skies of Orion
Through the lightening
Our farewell
To a bleak past
Orion... Our farewell
To be alive

One way
two lines
One name
Two aeons

To realize the fact that we are Here
tofind in life a path to live
Constantly
To unveil the rules of misery
To force a mind to strive by fear
Endlessly

A vast inner sea
Devoid of life
A moonless night leads
My steps to
A large wavewall sealed
On Time Portal
By the Guardians
Of Infinity

Save me
From these senseless days
To flee

Bring me
To behold the morning star
To reach...

To reach the skies of Orion
Through the lightening
Our farewell
To a bleak past
Orion... Our farewell
