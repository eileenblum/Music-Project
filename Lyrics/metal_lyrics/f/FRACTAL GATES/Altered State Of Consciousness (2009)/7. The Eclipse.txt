Searching for roads
In those dull days
I try to clarify
The odd stage I'm in
Plains in the glow
Seem to hide
From your sky blaze
As I blind

We drown in a murky realm
Chained storm
We drown into blurry hills

My eyes burn the eclipse
To the night is my soul
Blown in solace
To outshine I'm gone

Seal my fate, enter my fall
Leaad my sense, enter in my source
Flow in my dream
Be my flame, enter in my cold
Still my gaze, enter in my core
Flow in my dream

How can you feel when you are just a ghost
How can you be when you are just your own... shade

We pay for every life we take
We pay for every lie we say
We die to foresee

My eyes burn the eclipse
To the night is my soul
Lone in solace
To outshine I'm gone
