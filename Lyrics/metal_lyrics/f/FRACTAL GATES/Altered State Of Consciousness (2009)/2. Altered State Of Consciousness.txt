The sky is red, falling apart
Burning Fields stroke my way
The rage inflames, yelling afar
Shall I be consumed by War ?

Ablaze in fear

Searching signs to escape
Under starlit nightmare
Millions of fighting men
Yet just a few are real

The raining plague silences time
Unleashing ghosts of hate
Appalling names, yearning a scar
Cruel demons of decay
Shapeless face, murderinrg dawn
Ethereal faded stead
Stateless pain, learning to star
Altering my mind

How long for Signs ?

Help me to cross the line
To fly away from decline
Take me
To angels of undying end

Altered State of Consciousness

The rising veil slowing my heart
Freezing void sets my way
Erasing flames,  bluring my past
My future is mine
