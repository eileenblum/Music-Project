The coming oblivion
The sound of thunder
I can feel'em calling me... but why ?
The visions highlight to me a way
It's time to beg forgiveness or die

Memories
You feed the portal
With your mistakes You'll feel it crawling
Until the end

For me 
Screamless I can feel its (bitter) might
Maybe what all is left are illusions
Screamless I can feel this cold

Night of all fears
You see'em coming
Leading to this way
The gate awaits as you portray
Stellar sciptures
Of the unknown traveller
The fate seems to be carved
On the symbols of
Abhorrent truth
Of cosmos and sorcery
Struggling and fading away
Screams can't stop (the) might

Opening gates
Unleashing ritual
The gate opens wide
To outer worlds
In the abyss the astral eye
To be dematerialised

Memories
You feed the portal
With your mistakes You'll feel it crawling
Until the end
Crawling
In the fall

In the fall
Gateway of all fears

In this emptiness
The dreams of the false prophecy
You drown
A feeling
All of which you think is reality

Screamless I can feel its (bitter) might
Maybe what all is left are illusions
Screamless I can feel the immortality
To Nebula
