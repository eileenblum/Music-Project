Unleashed from Earth
Sullen signs
Berserk waves
Wild flows
Dark water wall

Immersion
An ancient drowning
To leave a void Hell
Atlantis reign
Where Legend meets Curse
Euphonic suffering

Rash or unfair 
Reach each time the same mess
Right and unsaid
Seas each time eradicate
Human race, planetray parasite
Sons of Depths, we missed the stars...
Proud or insane
Live inside the same tale
Swift and late
Die under another realm
Again, the Sun we have fooled

Immersion
An ancient drowning
To leave a void Hell
Atlantis reign
Where Legend meets Curse
Euphonic suffering

Brave warlike souls
Burnt in rage
Their final breath
No civilization will ever be immortal
Flood the ash, spill the Ages
To reinstate men in forgotten yarn

Immersion
Behold the Blame
Immersion
Beyond the End

The day Mankind crossed the line of lunacy
The curtain of once a mighty force fell
Unforeseen outcome
