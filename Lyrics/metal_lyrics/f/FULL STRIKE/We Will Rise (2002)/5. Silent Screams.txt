Wishing my eyes were closed, and the night has taken me away.
Flowers above my head and its leaves will bring me east of the dawn.

So there is just nothing I fear more than love,
and the angel that once was my heart, and the light that once was my soul.

Silent screams from the innocent voice of my heart.
There are oceans of pain, whispering my name in the dark.

I'm dancing in reverie, wishing well that the paint
was colored in light.

Silent screams from the innocent voice of my heart.
Tears in black rain whispering my name in the dark.
Silent screams, there is nothing I fear more than tears
lost in black rain, I'm walking through life all alone.
