Out of the night and in to eternety we fly the wings of a unicorn, through fire, ice and storm.
Across the seven seas we fly to find the eye of the venoms crown, there's the point of no return.

Back from the past we're chasing the holy path, through incarnation we will rise again.

Wild horses storming through the night and in to infinity.
Wild horses storming through the sky and in to a Mandrakes Dream.

Lords of the dark in the shade like distant faces in the grave, now banished into the void.
All the signs now carved in stone, among theshadows of the night and there's the point of no return.
