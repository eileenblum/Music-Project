Time only wasted.
This is my belief.
Days all like twins all the same.
What can I do to bring life back to me?
Searching my soul and I see. Will this always be?

This is the way I'm walking through life and on every day,
I sure don't know if there could be
any way that different - but how could it be?

When will I know - what this will bring me?
When will I see - why can't you tell me?
When will I know? I can't believe that this is the way it should be.

How will this end? I can see what is wrong,
Shadows are passing all over.
In my disguise it shows to my eyes.
How can I take any more, when I'm knowing what it's for.

This is the way, walking in life it won't be the same.
Could this be over now? This is the day.
Step by step it can't go on
