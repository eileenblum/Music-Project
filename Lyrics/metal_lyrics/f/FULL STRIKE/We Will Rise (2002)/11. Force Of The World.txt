There was a time when they were strong, we were living in the dark.
They thought that we wouldn't know, but our visions will never die.

We were just going on and on, in a haze full of lies.
With sorrow and cold despair, living in a masquerade.

We're standing together, watching all the world.
We're living forever, this is the time and they should know.

We are the force of the world, and the legends
all for one and we're all going on and on standing up strong.

Now is the time when we are strong, and the night has turned to dawn.
No madness no rage at all, try us you'll see that!

We're standing together, watching all the world.
We're living forever, this is the time and they should know.
