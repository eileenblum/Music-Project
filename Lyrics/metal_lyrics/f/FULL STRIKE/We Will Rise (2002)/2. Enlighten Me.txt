War plundering the land, murder and death.
There is slavery and greed.
Laws protect the wealth through lobbying in the halls.
But we can see all the lies written in histories witnessed testify,
greed beyond control. Insanity.

Then they brainwashed the people with politics.
They created consumers in pain.
Now in need, sophisticated slaves.

Enlighten me? I read the space between the lines!!!
Enlighten me? About the truth in hidden lies!
Enlighten me? Through numbers and letters in histories fake theatre.

Now they're killing the earth, polluting the oceans and poisoning the air.
Grief above all shares, profits and some gold.
