I just closed my eyes.
Everytime lightning pierced my mind.
I don`t feel the pain no more.

It will never end.
We will face it all again where they crossed our way.
We will stand for all and we will fight!
We will make it all the way.

We will rise and burn them to hell and we all will return fighting to the end and they will fall.

In the fields we stand and we are waiting for their strike.
Will they try again?
We will stand for all and raise our swords and cut the silence of the sky.

We will rise and burn them to hell and we all will return
fighting to the end and they will

To the dungeons of insane.
It will never be the same
