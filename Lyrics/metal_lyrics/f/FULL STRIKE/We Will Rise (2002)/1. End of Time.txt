Don't you see the future is now, and your turn has come to an end.
You can say that the world now will die and the devil will take you to hell.

We never believed in you and we always had our faith.
We never thought that you were, getting things out of your mind like.

End of time, (of time) your a fool walking in haze.
End of time, (of time) can't you see you're losing your faith.

Suckers like you, you thought you would win, I realized that long time ago.
It lays on your head, it's now what you give, you wish that I never would know.

So why don't you let it out to see what is real or what's not.
You're living in fantasy, that no one ever seems to find out.

End of time, (of time) your a fool walking in haze.
End of time, (of time) can't you see you're losing your Faith.

Stick: Time to wake up to see all the truth all around,
they're ripping you of, is that what you wanna to find?
