This is the final station of my sinful life
Praying for mercy, afraid for the life
Dignity, honesty floating through night, over the graves
No one can help me now

Behold the white light on the end
Escaping from the dark
Dead people all around me
They are sculptures of salt

I don't know where I am now,
Maggots are all around
Snakes creep through the rotten goats head
It shed the evil sound
Turbid light fills the space
The shadows on the wet wall
They're dancing a faggots dance
They're afraid of Satan's fall

Scatter my robe of immortality
Destroy my robe of immortality

Resisting their religion refusing all of it's shine
Now I am a wise man I know there is no shine
Satan can't touch me now afraid of my cross I wear
Fucking macabre demons laughing
