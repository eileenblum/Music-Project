Die by my hand, another night another day
The curse goes on and on
Those who live by the sword, they'll die crushed by the horde
By revenge by the word.

Hail

Can not understand, these prophetic words are planned
Inspired by the cosmic hand
Transform force into light, red sun bites the night
Dark side is out of sight

Hail

All hail the wise
Afraid upon, upon his sight
Dead inside, fighting for the blood
Commandments you'll find
