I look at the sky, it's reflecting your miserable face
Sound from your mouth, below, the envy ornated with lies
Where are you now, You said you're better than me
Now is your chance, show to me your supremacy

Try to break me with your filthiness,
Try to break me with the lies
My confidence is rising, far away in the sky
Deep under your reflection
Deep under your hollow eyes
You are drowning in pain and suffering
You realize who you really are

Trying to prove, but your innocence is false
I'll give you some advice
Don't look at the past
Correct your mistakes or you will be standing under the pillory

You are living with your face in the sand
Eternal darkness is coming to grab your hand
Black curtains around, surrounded with loudness of cries
The flesh without form, your casket is place in the ground

Six feed bellow, atrocity,
Nowhere to go,
This is the end of your empty world

Trying to prove, but your innocence is false
I'll give you some advice
Don't look at the past
Correct your mistakes or you will be standing under the pillory
