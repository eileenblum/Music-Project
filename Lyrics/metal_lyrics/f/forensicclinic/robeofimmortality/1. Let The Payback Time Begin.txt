There is no light, they live in the night
In the night and silence, and out of sight
Evil god below, good god above
About their existence, you'll never know
It's time to go, black spirit's float
Through land and air, to cut your throat
My pestilence, a bringer of death
Your rotting body, you will be dead

You will be dead

Feeling atrocity, no it's not conspiracy
Like you're trapped in concrete, victim of hypocrisy
But it's not yet complete, you must pay for your sins
That you did to me, let the payback time begin

Turned inside out, what's life about
About running, to the grave in the ground
You can not scream, like bloody dream
Worthless dog, without a dream
Black spirit's flow, you have to go
With the bringer of death, now you are dead
Your faith is gone, it shall be done
Bitch go to hell, bow to his throne

Your spirit is free like the finest portrait, I see it passing by
First autumn mist it's falling on me, walking down the street
The seclusion is dead when you're with me, can feel it on the skin
Like a leaf on the breeze flowing over the road, please don't talk to me

Please don't talk to me
Like leaf on the breeze
Hear your voice is free

Die, in hell you are lost, let it be
Fight on and on, he is near,
The bringer of death, feel the fear,
Spread it's wings, feel the fear

Feeling atrocity, no it's not conspiracy
Like you're trapped in concrete, victim of hypocrisy
But it's not yet complete, you must pay for your sins
That you did to me, let the payback time begin
