Unbound the aerial sylphe ascends.

From all-devouring abyss to the upper world.
Soars - to infinite spheres unseen.
Seraphically finger's towering tree-tops.
Divides all the blackened skies.
Turns past the everlasting eclipse.

To the sun - the source of life.
Spirits &amp; senses - drag me up
Amidst your breath.
