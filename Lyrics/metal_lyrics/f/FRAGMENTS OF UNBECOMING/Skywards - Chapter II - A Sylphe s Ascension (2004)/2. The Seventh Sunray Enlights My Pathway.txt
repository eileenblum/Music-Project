...Restless I seek
For unfathomable spheres of invisible light.
Sombre sources lead me astray,
Allure me into the night.

"The exhausted vagrant on his path to perdition"

Echoes of my past life I despise.
The cycle of seasons on this surface motionless lies.
Away - relieve me from the origin!
A breath - apart from smothering wilted skin.

A celestial voice:
"The seventh sunray enlights your pathway.
You feel drifted in a squall - a blast,
Ascending from where sylvan meadows last..."
