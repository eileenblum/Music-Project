On high!
Impassioned like svelte sylphes we fly.
Carried by perpetual circles of seasons.
Aside to wind and breath - the archetype symbols.
Now dispersed we are.

Up to the solar shrine - to pass the archways divine!

One cold inhale to leave the pale - the ephemeral.
Set ablaze our sensory pleasure.
Now scattered to the four winds we are.
