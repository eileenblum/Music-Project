Down below in the desolate depth,
As far as the eye forgathers with the dreadful curse,
Horizons open and split the earth.
Spectral sombre lights envisage their rebirth.

I sense the arrival
Of pernicious invisibles,
Of entangled whispers in the depth.
A plague of unborn emerges out of summoned tides.
A never dying fever?
A vision crystal clear?

Thousand tongues burst my veins.
My arms open wide,
To embrace the dead,
The unborn child.
