Arriven under a frigorific sun.
Nebulae cause a sudden inroad of cold weather.
Here I stand on a scar's edge to infinity.
Merely one step afar.
Winds - seize my spirit - set me free.
Never-dying I will be,
Dewdrops down along my finger-tips I see.

Decennaries left behind,
When I behold my unconscious mind.
I left my lurking-place to follow the luminary.
I am now at loss for words and enter sanctum,
Not another decennary.
