Faces - hidden faces,
Be sure - no one hears your cries.
I was born in times of hatred,
Moments - hours regret lies.

My insane hate inside is growing.
No regression [I foresee].
Fear breeds in your scent of dying.
Fear - my hatred is your destiny.

Silence whispers now in thousand voices.
As you're crawling - as you're falling.
Farewell of life the only choice is.
A horrid dimension for you opens to drown in.
