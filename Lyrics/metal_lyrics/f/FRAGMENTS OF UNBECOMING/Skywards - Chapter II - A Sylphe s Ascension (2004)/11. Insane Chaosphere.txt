Mesmerized - hidden inside.
Fallen through endless corridors
Until finally black turned to white.

Descended aeons after aeons
Nigh to the end of all life cycles.
Passed portraits,
Memorials of reflective times.
Creatures manipulating prophetic signs.

A scythe for the final harvest!

All around seems almost sear
Within this insane chaosphere.
