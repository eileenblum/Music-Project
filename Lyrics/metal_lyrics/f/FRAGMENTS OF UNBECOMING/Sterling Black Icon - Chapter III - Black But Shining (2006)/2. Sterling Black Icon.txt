A dark force is calling me, the black sun enlightens the scenery.
The horizon is filled with clouds so pride,
In a time when silence is not only a word or a feeling.

I'm on my way to march the fields of disbelief,
A certain thought, my senses disappear.
To see will never again be to believe
I'm dying for the chance to be!

I'm gonna be the one who tells his son
Not to do what I have done.
A time to mourn, a time to pray,
There are so many words to say.
Is this all I can sway...

Misery strikes fear into those left behind,
Horrible phantasy's erased from my mind.
The lost souls will be missed by none!
When night has passed and turned into light,
Sorrow in my eyes, in silence my tears flow.
Light of day replaces the darkened light,
Here I am among the ones (insane) dreaming, screaming...
They tried to take my life.

I'm on my way to march the fields of disbelief ..... [repeat]

You don't even know what you've become (in your life),
I feed my weakness with pathetic lies (I am blind).
Paranoid thoughts so close yet not to find,
So here I stand with tears in my eyes.

You don't even know what you've become ..... [repeat]

I'm gonna be the one who tells his son ..... [repeat]

Misery strikes fear into those left behind ..... (repeat]
