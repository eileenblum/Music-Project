[Ever since the very beginning ...
Far beyond, outlands forlorn
Resting drowned in tidal ground
What once was lost, was lost forever
What once was lost, got never found]
Trails alongside darkened waters
Wrapped in conjuration's haze surrounded by sonorous silence
Whispers from an ancient maze
Scattered fragments carry faces
Soughing winds like moaning sins
Impervious enigma razes the chasm into chasms sinks
Predicted - elected - infested
[The] second coming leads us to release
Predicted - afflicted - convicted
[The] second coming leads us to relief
Step into unlighted vastness
Vanish! bid farewell to life
Cross the passage to perdition
The guards are soon to rearise
Step into unlighted vastness so far you are, so far you're mortal
Crossing passage to perdition
The passage through perdition portal
[From now on ...]
Praise the blackness infinite to welcome mastery yet unborn
Turn glory into purgatory
Down ... down with the dawn!
Down with the dawn!
At last the inner self's defeat
Darksome forces are oncoming
With burning breath, no strength to speak
It's all about a new becoming scattered ...
Ever since the very end ...
When time is no longer passing by unraveling the spell seems to be nigh
When false divinity pretends
And blazing deathlessness descends
When life deforms, obscureness reigns
On highest peak the great one of a kind remains
But if timelessness turns into tense
Undying forces will arise
And all of us should realize
[That nothing ... nothing really ends!]
Step into unlighted vastness
Vanish! bid farewell to life
Cross the passage to perdition
The guards are soon to rearise
Step into unlighted vastness
So far you are, so far you're mortal
Crossing passage to perdition
The passage through perdition portal
