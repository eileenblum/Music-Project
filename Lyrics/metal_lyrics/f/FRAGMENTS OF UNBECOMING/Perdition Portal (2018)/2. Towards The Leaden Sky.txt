Aroused by whispers of the shattered ones, the withered souls - entangled behind all light
Fear the ones, who claim to serve the lord
With hypnotizing tongues so sweet
In cold embrace of mendacity
Involuntary forced servitude
Truth or dare no matter they abuse
What they receive
Marching onwards, towards the leaden sky absent of mind in weeping woods of isolation
Exposed to their dismissive stare behind bleeding masquerades.
That pierces their existence ...
Merciless and grotesque
Hamstringed in a coma of disillusion
Absorbed in a thousand lakes of lies
Obscuration takes [the] sight
As they raise their tired heads
Dust hurts inside empty eyes
Killing the truth they have believed in their dreams lurking in their frozen shapes
Across the absence of radiance - towards, towards the leaden sky
Ophthalmic shadows, onwards - towards, towards the leaden sky
The illusions they've lived - towards, towards the leaden sky
Ophthalmic shadows, onwards, forwards - towards the leaden sky
Their mind has been murdered by bloodstains of alienation
Staring quietly and motionless at the scars of creation fear the whispers of the shattered ones,
The withered souls - entangled behind all light
Fear the ones, who put their lives in wicked, forgotten hands of deceit marching.
Onwards, towards the leaden sky
Absent of mind in weeping woods of isolation
Exposed to their dismissive stare behind bleeding masquerades that pierces their existence
As they raise their tired heads
Dust hurts in their empty eyes killing the truth they have believed in their dreams
Lurking in their frozen shapes ...
Merciless ... it's grotesque
Hamstringed in a coma of disillusion absorbed in a thousand lakes of lies
Obscuration takes the sight
Across the absence of radiance - towards, towards the leaden sky
Ophthalmic shadows, onwards - towards, towards the leaden sky
The illusions they've lived - towards, towards the leaden sky
Ophthalmic shadows, onwards, forwards - towards the leaden sky
