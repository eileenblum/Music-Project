With stabbing pain awoken
Swallowed up by sorrow
Inside a thousand silent screams world escapes in endless nights
Ashen phantoms, desperation
Obeyingfear and blindness
Oh withering hope
Dismal, dismal - disheartening to hear! abysmal! dismal, dismal - disheartening to see! abysmal!
Descendants of creators crown of thorns
Testimony of savage greed
Blood on their hands and death in their breath just waiting for an end of deathlike silence
Bereaved of tomorrow
O leaders of blackened wastelands
When night will fall in an empty cosmos, a spiral in black illuminating [this] path of the damned ... of the damned
With stabbing pain awoken
Swallowed up by sorrow
Inside a thousand dismal dreams
Dismal, dismal - disheartening to hear! abysmal!
Dismal, dismal - disheartening to see! abysmal! world escapes in endless nights
Ashen phantoms, desperation
Oh withering hope descendants of creators crown of thorns
Staring at their mountains of grief blood on their hands and death in their breath
