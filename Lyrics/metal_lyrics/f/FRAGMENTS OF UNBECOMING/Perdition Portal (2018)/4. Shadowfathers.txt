Under sorrow sullen skies a withered sun draws relentless waters
To deepen the traces of all evil
To extinguish our individuality
To unleash our greed
Deceit revealed to their eyes
Disguised in pretended consternation lead: enrich promises of sanctuary
Made by false leaders, shadowfathers chorus
False solemn promises were made by false leaders - shadowfathers
With hypnotizing lies so sweet, darkening of desires
Were breathing their rope of sand, enchanted by their empty words
False prayerful exhalations unfurl, in the silent face of night
In the silent face of night
That darkness behind their light
False solemn promises were made by false leaders - shadowfathers
With hypnotizing lies so sweet, darkening of desires
Ill-nurtured by echoing monuments of perversions and fears
Did you really believe their words of dust?
Its's just all smoke and mirrors
Under sorrow sullen skies a withered sun draws relentless waters
To deepen the traces of all evil
To extinguish our individuality
To unleash our greed
Deceit revealed to their eyes
Disguised in pretended consternation
