Hollow echoes of oblivion
Illusions of blinded minds
Dissolving traces leading nowhere
Empty eyes gazing at the barren sky
Awaiting the end to come
Listen for the silentness
Their soughs a timeless mourning, an endless grief, an endless grief
Whispering leaves crumbling beneath their feet
Seas of shade-grown funeral flowers blown away lives of faceless precursors
All light swallowed, all light swallowed down within the void
Disassociated from what was left to them
All light swallowed
A dreadful wound that never heals
They wreathed among the soil, they kneel
Soulless masses, drifting shapes
Streaming through asphyxiation
Grasping their desperate essences
Multiplying their silent screams
Taking from them what was never theirs
Erasing their mark
Grasping, multiplying, taking - erasing their mark
Hollow echoes of oblivion
Passing the last frontier
None of them saw the signs
Ignorant in despise
All light swallowed, all lightswallowed down within the void
Disassociated from what was left to them all light swallowed
Their dreadful wound will never heal
They wreathed among the soil, they kneel
Behind them graves of generations
Streaming through asphyxiation
