Seeds of obscureness, shadows coiling up in dust
Age of desperation, mankind drifting in floods of war
In the name of the divine for fame and greediness
Unsatisfiable primitive ignorance
Neverending confusion, a passage of dashed hopes
Crestfallen purity of pure despair
When darkened winds do blow and it creeps into their hearts
There's darkness along the road, where shadows in circle in silence
Dissolving in silence
Led by blindness along the road
Dissolving in silence
... In silence ... in silence
... In silence ... in silence
Mesmerized by demise
[Their] primitive instincts rise again
Primitive instincts rise again
Mesmerized by demise paralyzed in agitation
Stunned by [its] morbid divinity
Circling voices in an echoing loop demanding pleasures, empty - headed
A soulless whispering, brilliance full of lies
... Of lies!
