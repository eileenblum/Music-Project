Amongst wuthering black coal deserts
Feeble shapes passing the trail of dying lights
Uncanny echoes unfold by master's command
With invisible strength forevermore
Bleeding sanctimonious eyes
Grotesque enthrallment of the blind
Horrified voices from afar
Groan with pain
To golgotha!
Frozen minds imprisoned in black
Nurtured by obsidian lies, which have darkened their desires salivating with pleasure
Their morbid greed a pointless act
That blazes its trail through generations
Why cry for bliss and salvation?
Give in to the promise of a golden victory
Praising the twilight saint's prayerful exhalation
Invocation of collapse at the very end [at the very end]
Barren landscapes deserted and left to decay
Eternally blessed by the grace of the master's lies
Golgotha!
Inverted light
Gathering shadows descend
Painful susurration from afar
Oh golgotha! oh golgotha! repeat &lt; uncanny echoes unfold by master's command
With invisible strength forevermore
Bleeding sanctimonious eyes
Grotesque enthrallment of the blind
Horrified voices from afar
Groan with pain
To golgotha! to golgotha! frozen minds imprisoned in black
Nurtured by obsidian lies, which have darkened their desires
Salivating with pleasure
Their morbid greed a pointless act that blazes its trail through generations
Why cry for bliss and salvation? give in to the promise of a golden victory
Amongst wuthering black coal deserts feeble shapes passing the trail of dying lights
