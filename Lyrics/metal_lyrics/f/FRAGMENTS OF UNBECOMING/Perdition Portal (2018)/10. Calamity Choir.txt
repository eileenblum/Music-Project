It feels like drowning in sadness
The emptiness the fear the pain in my mind
About a decade of anger in my frozen soul
Will I ever get old?
Calamity ... calamity trapped in my body
Couldn't ever get out
At the horizon is fading a perpetual sound
A depressive season with no end in sight
A mental cage like a grave
With nowhere to hide
Thoughts driving in circles through my brain
On and on and again and again
When the night has come
I am the lonely one
Alone with me and myself
With my restlessness
At the point of no return of my live ... calamity there is still the time to set my mind free ... calamity
Leaving all the fears threw them away ... calamity
Falling forever - can you hear the cries of dismay?
Calamity ... calamity choir ... calamity
Did I deserve this?
What have I done?
A deeper slumber
And the tears are gone
Sinking down from heaven above
Like a leaf from a tree
All hope is gone
The candle burns
A light I can see
This is how its used to be
The rain is over
The pages are turned
The lessons of life
That I have learned
Calamity ... calamity ... calamity ... calamity
