Sacred guards of blindness are on their path
While bleakly rises the shrouded night bewildered minds wreathed in doom
Scattered ashes of ghastly gloom
In a world that they designed
Like a dark and lonely dream
Masqueraders and pretenders of illusion and confusion
Hear their whispers, breathe their breath
Gazing at this voiceless mass
Tragedies repeat themselves
Where lies insist on obedience there is no time left to pray and kneel
So rise! ablaze with light!
And see! unfurl the deepest hollows!
Go ahead and face your fear!
Monsters among us in manic agony
With constant hunger and constant thirst
Won't their greed ever end?
Oppressive behavior of pointless absurdity
The abyss is here
Fear walks beside the abyssphere
Fear walks beside the abyssphere
Fear the abyssphere the abyss is here repeat
