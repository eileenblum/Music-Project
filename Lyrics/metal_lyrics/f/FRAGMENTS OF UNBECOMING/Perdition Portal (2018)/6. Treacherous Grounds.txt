Dimly falls the gloaming black
Like a curtain on the night
Bewildered voices all around
Enchanting tongues and restless sounds
Shallow waters whisper trembling luring souls while the wind blows cold
Tantalized and tortured
By so many faceless fears
Countless years, their eyes turn old
Bitter cold winds freeze tears that fall
Kept in never-ending thrall
No redemption for them all
Hounded along starless slopes
Dazzled by false views and hopes
No path in sight, no way to follow, when all beliefs emerge as hollow
Anesthesia
Drowning in a sea of fears
All that is left are bitter tears
Oh anesthesia
All that is left - a convulsive gasp for breath
Grounds leading astray
A quiet witness on the way, the only one who stay ...
On treacherous grounds leading astray ...
Dimly falls the gloaming black
Like a curtain on the night
Bewildered voices all around
Enchanting tongues and restless sounds
Shallow waters whisper trembling
Luring souls while the wind blows cold
Tantalized and tortured by so many faceless fears
Countless years, their eyes turn old
Bitter cold winds freeze tears that fall
Kept in never-ending thrall
No redemption for them all enclosing trepidation - closer comes the realm of death
A last terrified whisper, a last petrified breath, their fate, their doom, they must abide
Sink or swim but do not hide
Embarked on the stream once more
Drifting slowly away from the shore so close but out of reach
Enclosing trepidation - closer comes the realm of death a last petrified breath
Hounded along starless slopes
Dazzled by false views and hopes
No path in sight, no way to follow, when all beliefs emerge as hollow anesthesia
Drowning in a sea of fears
All that is left are bitter tears oh anesthesia
All that is left - a convulsive gasp for breath
Treacherous grounds leading astray
A quiet witness on the way, the only one who stay ... on treacherous grounds leading astray ...
So fuel the flames of frozen fire untie the chains of suppressed desires
Give birth to thoughts hidden in secret chambers
Not to preserve the ashes but to fan the embers!
Fuel the flames!
