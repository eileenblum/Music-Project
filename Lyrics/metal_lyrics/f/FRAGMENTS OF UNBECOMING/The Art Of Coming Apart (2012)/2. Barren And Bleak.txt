(Drawn) into the muteness of denying the self
The cold breeze of a moment of stillness is blowing grim and frightful, irreversible and iron-clad
Just for one second, again...
Motionless,static,frozen up breath, my thoughts-drifting into endless spheres of relentlessly burning fears
Into my secret consolation-my apparent desperation
Into my secret consolation-fragmentation of creation

Alone, legs weak, with fear-barren and bleak
Traced by somber, sighing shadows and roaring dust
I am waiting while the star of sadness is standing still under this sinister red clouded skies,
Where all tears are wept in silence

Captured in a locked room...
Shady grey shadows cover an icy wilderness, inside this madness,
Inside bowels of dark endlessness, within this trembling abyss
Motionless,static,frozen up breath, my thoughts-drifting into endless spheres of relentlessly burning fears
And I am waiting while the star of sadness is standing still under this sinister red clouded skies,
Where all tears are wept in silence
