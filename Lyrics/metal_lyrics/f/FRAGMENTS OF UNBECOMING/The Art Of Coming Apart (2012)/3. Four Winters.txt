The days to come seemed so clear
Another (ephemeral) flickering of bliss, Gleaming light like a kiss to mortal given
They walk the treacherous trail and find themselves alone
GO! Walk!
Cause they're sinking down on knees when they close tired eyes and lips
Nobody knows that they're down and out
No one will ask what they need, although they bleed... although they bleed...

SECOND WINTER

Abandoned, regnant helplessness
Over and over forced to hide sorrows many times
Only the wuthering silence in that solitude overshadows this burning, breathing blackness
Four winters are coming!
Augury of commemoration's whithered flowers
Four winters are drawning!
Augury of commemoration's frozen flowers

THIRD WINTER

The hollow, The absence, Close to the tides of sadness
Swallowing, dissolving into restlessness
What remains is the shadow of themselves
A bitter delusion, a shattered illusion disavowing itself,
Turned out to be a distorted retrospection of bare existence

FOURTH WINTER

Just for one moment they felt the healing hand
But the sunlight's blaze never reached (them)
Hypnotized by burning fevers,
Feeding the suffering Oblivious dreams devoured consciousness
Soul absorbed...soul absorbed...soul absorbed...

Four winters are coming!
Augury of commemoration's whithered flowers
Four winters are drawning!
Augury of commemoration's frozen flowers
The hollow, The absence, Close to the tides of sadness
Swallowing, dissolving into restlessness

What remains is the shadow of themselves
A bitter delusion, a shattered illusion disavowing itself,
Turned out to be a distorted retrospection of bare existence
