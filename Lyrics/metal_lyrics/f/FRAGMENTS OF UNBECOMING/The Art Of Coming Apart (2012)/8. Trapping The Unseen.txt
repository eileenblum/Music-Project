(In the year) 2078, far beyond earth
Fatal mission: Trapping the so far unseen
A short glance at the setting,
Focusing on embattled field:
Am I standing on its stamping ground
Staring at the remnants of my predecessors?
They sure once tried to hide in vain inside these walls,
Waiting for the yet unidentified

A still present tragedy: Imprisoned in a stranger's place
A shade, a dreadful sound uncanny
Yet fearless, longing for decisive trace
After all I'm chosen...

After all I'm chosen, placed amidst this fatal scene,
A long way off on deadly mission:
Trapping the (so far) unseen!

Cold and damp, the musty smelling reek
Rises from the shadowy path ahead
Somehow... Weird... A ghostly welcome
Unreal masks witness its every single step,
Surfacing without a sound

Now! Prepared to face the enemy...
Defend-Deface-Defeat!
Strong-willed, cold-bloodeness is my hope
Deform-Defy-Delete!
This creature with a single stroke

After all I'm chosen, placed amidst this fatal scene,
A long way off on deadly mission:
Trapping the (so far) unseen!

A short glance at the setting,
Focusing on embattled field:
Am I standing on its stamping ground
Staring at the remnants of my predecessors?
They sure once tried to hide in vain inside these walls,
Waiting for the yet unidentified

A still present tragedy...
Everything seemed so far away...
Perhaps it's only yesterday?
