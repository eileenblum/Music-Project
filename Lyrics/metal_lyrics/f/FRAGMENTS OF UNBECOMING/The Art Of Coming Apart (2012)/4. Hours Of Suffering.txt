What comes around unbound,
This glorious feeling makes me oh so proud
I'm still alive-yeah that's right
Let's start a war, we'll win this final fight
This is my tribute to the dead i hail
I am your key to the underworld
Cleanse my soul make me free from sin
Welcome to the hours of suffering

Hang 'Em high!
Their rotten bodies up to the sky
Beyond all imagination on the edge of pure damnation
Extreme hatred-forget, forgive, no time to live
The dead come back, turn my world to black
A cold embrace buried in flames

I'll bring your nightmares that will never end,
My veins are injected with hate my friend!
No forgiveness you can find in my eyes
See the shadows of those... those who died!

Staring into the empty sky
When thoughts of death cross my mind
Only forward never back
Fear is just around, I'm not afraid

Mass immolation, destroy the world-a new creation
We'll never live together in harmony
Listen to the sweet sound of my killing symphony

Hang 'Em high!
Their rotten bodies up to the sky
Beyond all imagination on the edge of pure damnation
Extreme hatred-forget, forgive, no time to live
The dead come back, turn my world to black
A cold embrace buried in flames
This is my tribute to the dead i hail
I am your key to the underworld
Cleanse my soul make me free from sin
Welcome to the hours of suffering
