Here I march on the fields of forever,
Back to where I once belonged
I am in trouble, it's the same situation
My flesh is weak but my will is strong

This is the mask of all my fears,
A never-ending torture has begun
All the lost souls together-one by one
Can you hear the crying winds?
Monarch of my sin-this monument of hate shall begin!

Beneath the burning sky,
The clouds are shattered by the sun
Into this blackened night, in a world beyond eternity
Beneath the burning sky,
The clouds are shattered by the sun
Into this blackened night-a silence dressed in black

Useless I was laid to rest,
Haunted by the future of the past
It's just the beginning!
No hope is lost-in a time when autumn turns to frost

Sorrow and pain, It's driving me insane
At the end of the world, nothing will remain

Beneath the burning sky,
The clouds are shattered by the sun
Into this blackened night, in a world beyond eternity
Beneath the burning sky,
The clouds are shattered by the sun
Into this blackened night-a silence dressed in black

Here I march on the fields of forever,
Back to where I once belonged
I am in trouble, it's the same situation
My flesh is weak but my will is strong

This is the mask of all my fears,
A never-ending torture has begun
All the lost souls together-one by one
Can you hear the crying winds?
Monarch of my sin-this monument of hate shall begin!
