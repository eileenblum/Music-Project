Hear the whispering of a slumbering cry
You were never just a word in my life
You were full of burning passion, a passionate longing for me
A deep ocean of difference remained (once more),
Just seas of ashes full of stabbing pain

With the crowns of Thorns in my hand, memories in brilliant black,
And the crown in my blood, so real what seems forlorn again
All the sorrows in my mind will be passing these grey days
And for what we've lost, for what we've never found,
I will pray!

Embraced by the rising of our black sun
Illuminating all days at frigorific dusk
In spectral coulours of tears reflecting memories all circling inside of me
For the will to be, For the will to be, yeah for the will to be
I can see, I can see through reality
(I can see, I can see) circling inside of me
Multiple monstrosities

Evanescence forevermore, dissolving ember,
It will ablaze once more

I've seen these fading hands,
Searched for the missing element

Hear the whispering of a slumbering cry
You were never just a word in my life
You were full of burning passion, a passionate longing for me
A deep ocean of difference remained (once more),
Just seas of ashes full of stabbing pain

With the crowns of Thorns in my hand, memories in brilliant black,
And the crown in my blood, so real what seems forlorn again
All the sorrows in my mind will be passing these grey days
And for what we've lost, for what we've never found,
I will pray!

Evanescence forevermore, dissolving ember,
It will ablaze once more
