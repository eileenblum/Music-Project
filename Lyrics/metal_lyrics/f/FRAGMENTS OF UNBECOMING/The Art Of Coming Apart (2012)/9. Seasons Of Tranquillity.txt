Eye for an eye, the battle rages on,
Darkness shall arise!
After all these years of nothing,
What are you waiting for?
Split wide open, the point of no return,
Reflections of my inner flaws
Traveling into nowhere, together,
Distant voices (still) can be heard

Hard to breathe, Forever gone
The will so strong-(In) Seasons of tranquility
Domination-Infiltration-Devastation
Seasons of tranquility

First, feel the pain (you) never realized
The final hours has arrived
The truth beyond, the mirror of my soul,
Through flesh and mind I roam
A stab in the back, never to forget, Shadows of the past
Now the time as come, but your time is done
You shall not weep, but you shall bleed

Hard to breathe, Forever gone
The will so strong-(In) Seasons of tranquility
Domination-Infiltration-Devastation
Seasons of tranquility

Uninhabited final resting place,
Terrifying screams filled with immortal hate
Sorrow takes control of lonely moments
I walk through closed gates never missed,
Never opened

Demonic souls on their way to hell,
A farewell to all evil
I damn the day when you were born,
Your face will turn to stone!

Are you afraid to hear the truth?
I am the one, the same, the one insane
Can you feel the blade (that) slowly tears your veins?
I'll create cruel nightmares in your brain

As I escape through the past-below the lights,
When the deadly light touches my skin,
My illusions are lost in broken mirrors
I'll hide the truth behind my innocent eyes

Demonic souls on their way to hell,
A farewell to all evil
I damn the day when you were born,
Your face will turn to stone!

Eye for an eye, the battle rages on,
Darkness shall arise!
After all these years of nothing,
What are you waiting for?
Split wide open, the point of no return,
Reflections of my inner flaws
Traveling into nowhere, together,
Distant voices (still) can be heard

Hard to breathe, Forever gone
The will so strong-(In) Seasons of tranquility
Domination-Infiltration-Devastation
Seasons of tranquility
...tranquility
