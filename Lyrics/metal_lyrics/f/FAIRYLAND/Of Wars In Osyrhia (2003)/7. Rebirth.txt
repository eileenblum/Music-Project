In the shade of willows and elms
A cold wind blows and carries my tale
A tale of rebirth, a season's change
And spring will shine again

An early flower fragile and shy
A ray of sun celebrates it's bloom
The gentle colors of winter's end
This poetry lights my heart

For a thousand years to come
Will the flight of dragons fill the clouds
And the shine of spring will lighten again
On the king and on his land

The leaves are dancing under the wind
The songs of birds are filling my head
A taste of heaven, a magic play
The return of better days

The last trace of snow melts away (the last trace of snow will melt away)
The dance of seasons is following it's course
The circle of life closes again
And spring prepares it's reign

For a thousand years to come
Will the flight of dragons fill the clouds
And the shine of spring will lighten again
On the king and on his land

For a thousand years to come
Will the flight of dragons fill the clouds
And the shine of spring will lighten again
On the king and on his land

In this silence, the storm as gone away forever now
Deep in my heart, a shining spring will bloom here and explode
