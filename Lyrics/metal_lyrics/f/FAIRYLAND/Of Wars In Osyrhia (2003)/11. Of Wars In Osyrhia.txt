Cenos, prince of evil now your march is almost done
Your mighty forces gone
Swallowed by our gods
Dragons and elves now faithfull to our quest
Their forces will join us
And banish you of our lands.

Troubled was our battle
The odds deserted us
But in this chaos gathered we would stand

Now you can feel terror for those you dedained before
Our souls where never lost
Hope witheld our swords
Surprised you'll be
When the storm falls on thee
Then back to your grave you'll sleep
For a thousand years

Raise your sword, the evil awaits
We are the lords of victory

What I have dreamed of first was revenge
But now I accomplish my destiny

Flame of the battle, eternal fury
Lead us beyond the call of revenge
And for my kingdom I'll fight for ever
Magic spreads all around.

Lord I saw the ending
The final set for all
And deep this vision remained in my heart

Raise your sword, the evil awaits
We are the lords of victory

Ho when dark is gone
Whispers my heart
The voice of freedom will scream
Forever

What I have dreamed of first was revenge
But now I accomplish my destiny

Flame of the battle, eternal fury
Lead us beyond the call of revenge
And for my kingdom I'll fight for ever
Magic spreads all around.

Darkness comes and darkness goes
"my kingdom will never fail"
But we cannot fight forever
"king of us all, fight with us all"
I am tired of all this madness
"Evil will vanish one
Day of our freedom when twilight will come"

Son of the twilight lands
Your fight is not over yet
Many things are waiting to be done

Flame of the battle, eternal fury
Lead us beyond the call of revenge
And for my kingdom I'll fight for ever
Magic spreads all around.
