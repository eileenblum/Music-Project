There is a place lost into space
Where live mystic legends mitsy tales
Open your mind to fantasy
You won't believe, won't believe what you will see
Magic and evil innoncence and lies
The wrong and the right and all that stands behind

What do I see
Within my dream
Deep in the corridor of time

We ride away
To the journey to the deep
At magic tales of fantasy
Sorrow brings tears to my heaven
Then goes far away
Sorrow brings tears to my heaven
And then goes far away

Now that we are riding, riding with the sun
To the land of the miracles
To the land of the free

Now that you've seen dragons in dream
Be aware for the legend begins
Ride with the sun across the seasons
March with the light as father and son
And as the spirit of five thousand men
The strenght in your heart will burn like a flame.

What do I see
Within my dream

We ride away
To the journey to the deep
At magic tales of fantasy
Sorrow brings tears to my heaven
Then goes far away
Sorrow brings tears to my heaven
And then goes far away

Sorrow brings tears to my heaven
And then goes far away
