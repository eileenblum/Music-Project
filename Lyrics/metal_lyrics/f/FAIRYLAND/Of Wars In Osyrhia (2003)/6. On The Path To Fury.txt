Climbing the mounds
I can feel the pain inside me
Riding alone searching for
A reason to live

The wave of destruction
Took my soul away

Force of the wind
Fury never seen before
The sound of your laughters
Remain in my heart

On the field the sky is burning
Taking shades of a wintery night
I can see a thousand sparrows
Drawing a figure into the light

I'll take my force
In the darkness of your eyes
And seal my fate
By the cold steel of my sword
And before a long time
My rage will be free

Lost in the shadow was my heart
My mind was thorn in flames
And by the sacred magic stones
I'll see the light again

On the field the sky is burning
Taking shades of a wintery night
I can see a thousand sparrows
Drawing a figure into the light

On the field the sky is burning
Taking shades of a wintery night
