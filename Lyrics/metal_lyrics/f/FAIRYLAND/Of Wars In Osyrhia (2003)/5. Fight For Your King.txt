Now I pledge alliegeance
To my all mighty king
My sword will serve thy majesty
Armies of the dark, servants of hell preparing to fail
No turning back, not even death could change my mind

As the world will fall in war again
All of mankind will gather and fight (and fight again"

The scream of revenge burns in my heart
We'll fight together and see another day again

"Search for altars of gods around the world" he said
To find them is the only way
Altars for the stones, guardians of hope created by gods
United now to face the dark and evil throne

The scream of revenge burns in my heart
We'll fight together and see another day again

Carved in the stones lies my tribute to universe
My words speak in vain for a silent poetry
Hear me all mighty I ask for your wisdom
Your path will be mine when I reach eternity

Armies of the dark, servants of hell preparing to fail
No turning back, not even death could change my mind

Is that what I feel deep in my heart
The stones now scream and say mighty one fight for your king

Mighty one fight for your king

As the world will fall in war again
All of mankind will gather and fight

The scream of revenge burns in my heart
We'll fight together and see another day again

Carved in the stones lies my tribute to universe
My words speak in vain for a silent poetry
Hear me all mighty I ask for your wisdom
Your path will be mine when I reach eternity
