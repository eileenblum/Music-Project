Death followed his path when first he came
The coldness of his mind was that of steel
Desease was his fortune, chaos his name
His words disillusions, for blood he came

The world was in terror, plague and chaos reigned
But in this darkness was a light

In the name of innocence, in the name of holly light
For the glory of the ancient gods, and for freedom we
Will fight

Eager for revenge,(the) traveller is back
Defeated once before, but stronger now
The fight may be harder, blood must be shared
But hope is on our side, we'll fight again

To save our kingdom, in the name of light
We'll fight untill the end of time

In the name of innocence, in the name of holly light
For the glory of the ancient gods, and for freedom we
Will fight

Somewhere above, a kingdom in the clouds
The wisdom of elders guide our swords
Together as one, the light is on our side
The holly fire burning in our hearts
