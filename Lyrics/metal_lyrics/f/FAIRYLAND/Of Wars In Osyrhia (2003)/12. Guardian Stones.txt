Seven gems of light,
A gift from gods to save our lands
United we'll fight
Facing hate and lies we scream for revenge

Guided by their light
Our power glows together we stand
Gods are on our side
United we'll fight, war comes to an end

Asleep for years, in the silence they wait
The hour when chaos will come
The stones of freedom

One for every land
For a thousand years their power awaits
Now it will soon rise
For Osyrhia's freedom will shine again

Asleep for years, in the silence they wait
The hour when chaos will come
The stones of freedom

Guardian stones,
True defender of the holly land
Sacred fire of a divine hand
Servants of humanity
Save us

Guardian stones,
Mystery sent by a twilight god
Resting on seven altars of gold
In the whisper of the wind

Somewhere in time
The call of gods will thunder
And awake the servants of light.

Seven gems of light,
A gift from gods to save our lands
United we'll fight
Facing hate and lies we scream for revenge

One for every land
For a thousand years their power awaits
Now it will soon rise
For Osyrhia's freedom will shine again

Guardian stones,
True defender of the holly land
Sacred fire of a divine hand
Servants of humanity
Save us

Guardian stones,
Mystery sent by a twilight god
Resting on seven altars of gold
In the whisper of the wind

Somewhere in time
The call of gods will thunder
And awake the servants of light.
