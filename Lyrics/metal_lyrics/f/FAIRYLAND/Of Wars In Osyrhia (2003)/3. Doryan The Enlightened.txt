Majesty I've seen the fate of your lands
Visions of hell invaded my dreams
Believe me I am your only chance
I will serve the peace of your land

To protect and save my beloved world
King Morick there's no time to waist
By mounds and plains I'll destroy the enemies
Eleandra will shine once again

Young Doryan we have heard your call
Prophecies will become reality
By mounds and plains you'll destroy the enemies
Osyrhia's light will shine once again

Gods of war, lands of freedom
On my way to battle
Lend me your force

I won't fight for gold or glory
I don't need no fame or pride
I will take my sword to veil upon my land
The victory is in my hands

Pain and torture, all I caught in my sight
The visions of terror have burned my heart

I won't fight for gold or glory
I don't need no fame or pride
I will take my sword to veil upon my land
The victory is in my hands

We won't fight for gold or glory
We don't need no fame or pride
We will take our sword to veil upon our land
The victory is our my hands
