Far from all reality, lost in the furies of time
A place of magic eternity where stories and tales never die
Landscapes of eternal light drowned in the wisdom of gods
Where all beeings have a cristal heart and ignor the meaning of war

Near by the lake, shadows await for me

I came here to find a key, an answer to what I demand
Here in this country of majesty, the power to defend my land

Far, deep in the outter
Where dragons will fly forever
And twilight will always shine
Magical landscapes of freedom

Open the gates for me, my heart is a brave one
I'll get my victory and then show you who I am (The flame of hope will burn your misery)

Nok matoi nofer ei scharten nereimoliro "victoria Osyrhia"
Anon nekef setek baikei en schoor anon

You of the eternal light
Believe my words as I speak
For my true meanings are not of war
And freedom is my destiny

I came here to find a key, an answer to what I demand
Here in this country of majesty, the power to defend my land

Far, deep in the outter
Where dragons will fly forever
And twilight will always shine
Magical landscapes of freedom
Before my eyes

And all over the land, the angels will sing your name
And all over the earth, honor and pride will be your name

Open the gates for me, my heart is a brave one
I'll get my victory and then show you who I am

"In the shadows of these lands,
The forces of evil followed Doryan and are lurking in the dark
Their blood thirst is breaking the balance of the sanctuary
And their screams fill the earth"

Far, deep in the outter
Where dragons will fly forever
And twilight will always shine
Magical landscapes of freedom
Before my eyes

Open the gates for me, my heart is a brave one
I'll get my victory and then show you who I am

Now I can save my land...
