Now we've reached the land, such a dreadful sight
What can be expected from these cursed shores?
We've got a remote chance, we will try it out of spite
Find a better end, meet a better end?

Hulls against the beach front for another fight
Men await their freedom call from a crimson tide
We've got a remote chance, we will try with all we've got
Find a better end, here we stand

We have traveled all the way on a journey perilous
Fighting back the waves, feeling glorious
Now that we stand right before the evil shore
Reaching out in the dark to the friends taken five centuries before
