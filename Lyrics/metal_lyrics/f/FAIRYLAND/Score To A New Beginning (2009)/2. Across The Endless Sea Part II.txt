Here we watch the horizon while the waves come crashing by
To complete our desires, in the darkest of thunder we follow the one
Feel the waves of the ocean as Edoran carries his voice
Five centuries have now gone by, for the love of our peers we will sing and rejoice

On the shore one stands for all
Will it ever be... my own enemy?

Today we sail across the endless sea, to a place where all were left behind
To the island over the sea, no one will be left behind this time
In the darkest of thunder we follow the one...

Have the blessing of all our gods, they will protect all the ones we hold dear
Behind each man you can see their light, they will protect all the ones we hold dear
Right over the deep we sail to Duna, invade the wretched land
Brothers waiting for their salvation
Sons of the twilight land, your fight is not over yet
Many things are waiting to be done

Here we watch the horizon while the waves come crashing by
To complete our desires, in the darkest of thunder we follow the one
Feel the waves of the ocean as Edoran carries his voice
Five centuries have now gone by, for the love of our peers we will sing and rejoice

On the shore one stands for all
Will it ever be... my own enemy?

Today we sail across the endless sea, to a place where all were left behind
To the island over the sea, no one will be left behind this time
In the darkest of thunder we follow the one...

Today we sail across the endless sea, to a place where all were left behind
To the island over the sea, no one will be left behind this time
In the darkest of thunder we follow the one...
