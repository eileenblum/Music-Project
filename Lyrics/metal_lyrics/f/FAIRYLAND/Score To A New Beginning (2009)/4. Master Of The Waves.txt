The mist is rising over the ocean's waves
Together we leave the shores of hell behind us to find our destination
The sun is hiding behind the horizon, leaving its realm to the endless night
Right under the ocean's waves the Leviathan will rise

Technomancia, the dark creation of a wicked soul
Brace yourselves for the fury of the ocean wants it toll

Under a crimson sky the danger is revealed
What evil stands behind these eyes?
It's in the wind, the feeling of sudden death awaits as the Leviathan rises

We were not meant to travel the open seas
Now we are reminded of its mortal nature by this dark creation
The safe way to the shore is denied, leaving no choice but to stand and fight
The issue of this confrontation carries through the night

Technomancia, the dark creation of a wicked soul
Brace yourselves for the fury of the ocean wants it toll

Under a crimson sky the danger is revealed
What evil stands behind these eyes?
It's in the wind, the feeling of sudden death awaits as the Leviathan rises
Under a crimson sky the danger is revealed
What evil stands behind these eyes?
It's in the wind, the feeling of sudden death awaits as the Leviathan rises
