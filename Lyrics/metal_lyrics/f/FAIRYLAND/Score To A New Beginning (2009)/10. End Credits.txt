At the end of their journey
Our children awake
With the welcoming sight of a new day to come
A new kingdom of heaven, a future to make
Now the free men are finding their way home

To the far horizon a new dawn awaits
For a world united to cast the night away
And the winds are blowing all over the land
With a world now rejoicing to see another day

On the far horizon a new dawn awaits
While the world rejoices to cast the night away
And the winds are blowing all over the land
On a world united to greet another day

At the end of their journey
Our children awake
With the welcoming sight of a new day to come
A new kingdom of heavens, a future to make
Now the free men are finding their way home

On the far horizon a new dawn awaits
"We were lost and now we rise"
While the rejoices to cast the night away
"Proudly stand"
And the winds are blowing all over the land
"And the winds are blowing again"
On a world united to greet another day
"Greeting another day"
