The gates of Morken lay in sight, this war is coming to an end
Behind the walls of the darkest place we'll see the Angel fall from grace
Witness the end of flowing tears, the final chapter of our dreams
This lonely figure charges still, revenge fire within

We are so close we feel their pain these brothers lost won't remain the same
On wings outraging we must slain, win our freedom again
We came so close we feel their pain, we are so close they feel our return

This is our time, our brothers were left behind, a silent and broken race
Shall we prevail in fight, we'll turn the wrongs into rights
The Angel will fall from grace

Fire, burn in the dark winter sky, this madness will come to an end
Endless bliss for the children of Light, the Giants will rise and defend

Each fallen calls a thousand more, a frantic carnage with no end
Behind the walls of the darkest place we'll see the Angel fall from grace

Close your eyes, feel the dreams are fading: The Godsent supremacy
Close your eyes, now the dreams are ending: Let's embrace our legacy

The gates of Morken lay in sight, this war is coming to an end
Behind the walls of the darkest place we'll see the Angel fall from grace
Witness the end of flowing tears, the final chapter of our dreams
This lonely figure charges still, revenge fire within

We came so close we feel their pain, we are so close they feel our return
This is our time, our brothers were left behind, a silent and broken race
Shall we prevail in fight, we'll turn the wrongs into rights
The Angel will fall from grace
