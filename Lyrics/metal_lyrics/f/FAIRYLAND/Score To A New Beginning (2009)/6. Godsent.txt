For so many years now I've longed to see my home
But despite all I've done so far I walk my path alone
I've always tried to hide the tears, be strong and shake my fears
They wanted me to guide them but fate was after me. Truly fate was after me

"And we shall hunt the sun until it shines no more.
Then all will fear my name for I am the true master of this world"

I could have lived another way

I'm just a mortal man caught in the events of my time
The Gods of Heaven control my destiny
I'm just a mortal man caught in the events of my time
I truly hope I am the one in charge of my destiny

The dreams were meant to save and yet they seldom guaranteed
The issue wouldn't be lethal, the win so clear
In times of need and chaos a defender awaits
And so it had to be me, a hero out of hand.
A hero out of hand

"And we shall hunt the sun until it shines no more.
Then all will fear my name for I am the true master of this world"

I could have lived another way

I'm just a mortal man caught in the events of my time
The Gods of Heaven control my destiny
I'm just a mortal man caught in the events of my time
I truly hope I am the one in charge of my destiny
I'm just a mortal man caught in the events of my time
I truly hope I am the one in charge of my destiny
