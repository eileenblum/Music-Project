My love I Hail you from a faraway place,
The words that I lay down are painful to write. And now I'm done,
I'll be leaving to a forsaken land... and my life will come to an end.

I've marched with my brothers for a long, long time, we carry the hope for those
Days to come. But still I long the embrace of the one I call mine
That's the only thing I'll miss when I die...

So far away from this place of mine, so long overdue is a kiss to my love
Feeling her skin under this roof of mine, I wish I had more time

I see the old days in the ripening fields, the joy to be with you and become as one
But now it's gone, though I'm sure we will meet again
In this world or the next

So far away from this place of mine, so long overdue is a kiss to my love
Feeling her skin under this roof of mine, I wish I had more time

To be with you, I'd give it all. To grow old with you, I'd give it all
Fate has decided otherwise, my sister of the Light

My love I Hail you from a faraway place.
"Remember by face"
Words that I lay down are painful to write.
"Don't fear, my love"
And now I'm done I'm entering a forsaken land...
"I will always be there"
My life will come to an end.

So far away from this place of mine, so long overdue is a kiss to my love
Feeling her skin under this roof of mine
I wish I had more time

Now as I stand on the battle field my hopes are all going to our only son
He shall be strong and never yield, he is what the future will bring...
