Once was a time, in the white desert cold
And a place she could call her own
Then came the darkness, fear, grievance and hate
From the hands of Gods, it's gone forever now

The dream of a man, and whisper of tears
all gone with the wind
Black endless night, in the shadows of hell
The fearful disk stood before the sun
so the lights of her father God shined not upon her land
In her castle of frost she swore for revenge

[bridge:]
Far to the north, the call of retaliation
Open up, wide the gates of Havenrod

[chorus:]
Solan has called the help of the one
over the frost where the white mountains lie
What will future be, in the shadows of a word?
To be a queen: an oath upon the sword
and a tale..
And the tale carries on

The ghost of a word, a promise unsaid a whisper away
For the helpless we left our homes behind
And to our destiny, we carry one
The dark clouds are far and yet I'm so cold
it seems that we've reached the end of the world

[bridge]

[chorus]

For the twilight we'll take our swords
and to Eldergrave we'll fight our way
Our fathers and brothers are dying in vain
but this is our oath: we'll get our revenge

[bridge]

Solan has called the help of the one
over the frost where the white mountains lie
What will future be, in the shadows of a word?
To be a queen: an oath upon the sword
and a tale..

[chorus]
