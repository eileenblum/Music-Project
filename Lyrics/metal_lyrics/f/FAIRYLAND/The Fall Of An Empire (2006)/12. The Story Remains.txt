Deep in our hearts
By this time, we've crossed so many lands
So many friends we've lost
So many bitter ends
By these days of anger, traitors and disguise
Gods have always been here by our side

[bridge:]
Once again, we'll see the morning sun
Once again
Yet the memories remain

[chorus:]
Never again the shadows in my heart
They're gone forever now
Before the light celebrate the return of many better days
Our world has the blessing of the Gods
These glorious times will be ours
And the story remains

[bridge]

So the time of peace will be back
And our love for the Gods is strong

[chorus]

For the light, we'll cross the endless sea
We'll face the evil one
and carry out the fear
So the day we've waited for so many years
finally comes
and our kingdoms will be free

[bridge]

[chorus]

And the story remains
