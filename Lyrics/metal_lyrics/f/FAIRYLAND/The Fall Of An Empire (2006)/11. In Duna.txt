Silently black winter comes
tears of pain deep in our hearts
and the sun forever gone
while the shadows fly high
Night has come in shades of gray
light is gone forever now
and the Gods blind to our prays
leave their sons in the dark

[bridge:]
Will the angels from heaven carry hope to our kind?
Shall we then keep our faith in the light?

Many tears and many cries for the friends forever gone
by the sword so many died
many never went home

[bridge]

[chorus:]
Far from our kingdom where shadows can never dim
over the valleys and mountains we cry
Far on the water island of pain
last stand of Cenos where fathers and brothers are dying
Dying...

Many tears and many cries
for the friends forever gone
by the sword so many died many never went home
Night has come in shades of gray
light is gone forever now
and the Gods blind to our prays
leave their sons in the dark

[bridge]

[chorus]
