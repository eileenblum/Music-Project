Suffering no more today
Not today!
Believe in us, we are now on our way to your jails
Leave your past suffering behind
Freedom awaits so you must raise your head to the stars
And believe in yourself once again
And tonight...
The walls of Laemnil fall
Raise our fate to the hands of Gods

[bridge:]
The walls are falling to the trampling of our men
And the walls of Laemnil fall at last
The dark lord in his castle fears for death tonight...

[chorus:]
One for all, on our march to Eldergrave
And the walls of Laemnil fall
To the stomping of a thousand men
One for all, on our march to Eldergrave
And the walls of Laemnil fall
To the stomping of a thousand men

Down to the hall we recovered the all-mighty stones
and the power of Gods will beours
We left the shadows far behind
leave the shadows far behind and stand
To win the freedom of all man
Freedom awaits so you must raise your heads to the stars
And believe in yourself again
And tonight...
Solan can witness our fight
And tomorrow leave the world in harmony
And tonight...
The walls of Laemnil fall
Raise our fate to the hands of Gods
And the walls of Laemnil falls at last

[chorus]
