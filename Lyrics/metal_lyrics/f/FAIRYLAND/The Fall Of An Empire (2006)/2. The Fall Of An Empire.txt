So much of our battle
and the freedom of Osyrhia
The darkness laid upon us
could never be undone

By the way of shadows from a thousand years
We'll see our kingdoms fall into darkness
Yet I tried relams now long forgotten
and the woods and plains of Siridian

All that was long beloved will be turned to dust when time comes by
The visions dance into the darkness of my mind
Thus will end our battle
and the freedom of Osyrhia

The dark lord undefeated
at least will get his time
What for all the fights and promises we've had
Have Gods deserted us, or was it the light?

[bridge:]
By my words I'm asking for Gods to guide me through the dark
I'll stand for all
The darkened dreams have called a freedom cry
as I've tried, and i tried

[chorus:]
The shining tears of sorrow fallen in these dreams
Were never mine
The fall of an empire raise a thousand screams
that never die
The shining tears of sorrow fallen in these dreams
Were never mine
The fall of an empire raise a thousand screams
Screams that never die

Since then we've marched through a desert of hope
and yet our passion remains
The longing will for the kingdoms we've lost here
The voice of heroes thunders again
through the land of our freedom, our land

Courage of all, and the shining of Light
But still the empire falls

[bridge]

[chorus]
