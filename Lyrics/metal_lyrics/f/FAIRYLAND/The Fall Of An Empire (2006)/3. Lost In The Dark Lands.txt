The power balance has failed
and death is stronger than us
The dark lord finally returns to Eldegrave
The nightmare came with that evil lord

The shadow falls on Osyrhia
We fighted with out might
No anger for the light
The shadow falls on Osyrhia

The endless walk through the night
where we belong at last
We're doomed to slavery
no one can save us now

Enter the kingdom of terror

[bridge:]
Till the end we will stand brave

[chorus:]
Lost in the dark lands where no one resists
The free men are enslaved, no light
Betrayed by chaos when hope turns to dust
The armies of freedom are lost

What will be our fate at the end of our path?
Will we be reduced to mere memories?
There's nothing now but despair
our lives were gambled and lost

The tower of destiny will decide our fate
The nightmare came with the evil lord
The shadow falls on Osyrhia, We fight with our might
No anger for the light

The shadow falls on Osyrhia
Blessed are the ones who died
for them all this is over
This pain is our price
for serving all we've loved

And shadow falls on Osyrhia
The kingdom is lost in the sands of time
Never turn you back on me again
Never turn you back on me again

Forlorn and lost
Suffering all day
The slaves forever bound to Eldergrave
Darkened shadows, fears unspoken

Thousand men lost in the dark lands
On the path to hell so many died

[bridge]

[chorus]

Never turn your back to see the lost friends on the field
They're lost...

[chorus]
