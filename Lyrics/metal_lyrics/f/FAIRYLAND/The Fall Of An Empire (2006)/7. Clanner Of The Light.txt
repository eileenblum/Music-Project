Light will come and shine on me again
Wake up!
Broken my chains, along the walls of Eldergrave
I run to my freedom, alive and strong once more
Time has passed
Deliverance for all
My call will strike the end
The curse is gone forever more
The call of revolution roars beyond the gates
Cry out of the dying men, the desolation, persecutions
ache inside my heart, but I shall swear for revenge

[bridge:]
Light will come and shine on me again
Yet it shines through the clouds
On the day we'll all be free again

[chorus:]
Clanner of the Light
The shine and your force deliver hope for all
Clanner of the Light
The sword in your hand strikes for all

Beyond these walls of pain a better world awaits
So hold onto your freedom call
I'll bring the kingdom come to find a greater light
So hold onto your freedom call
Gods I've seen the ending, the final stage for all and shadows drift upon my skin
as the night will fear from us all

[chorus]

Light will come and shine on me again
Wake up!
Broken my chains, along the walls of Eldergrave
I run into my freedom, alive and strong once more
Time has passed
Deliverance for all
My call will strike the end
the curse is gone forever more
The call of revolution roars beyond the gates

[bridge]

[chorus]
