Take him down, take him down, take him down, take him down
Fight for your life, hear the call
No shadows there to be seen
Visions fade and your heart is released from pain
Time to be freed of your chains
The shine will never be killed
Then from heaven's gate the nightmare ends at last
The shadows are gone
Mysted in betrayal and lies
Under the sign of the dark
Darkness and oblivion fall when your children rise
Rise from the ashes and stand
forever free, forever proud
proud time has come and our victory is at hand
The foolish and the weaked
Cannot stand
The visions of their fall
It's gone forever now...

[chorus:]
No more betray, the end of war comes at last
We will brighten your souls
Through shades of gray
the light's age will come at last
We will never get lost in the dark
To our freedom we joyfully ride

Hold my hand, don't wander in the dark
just keep the fear inside
the light fantastic guiding your way
Now the time to rise has come
a reason to go home
and give an end to darkest of days
no more betray, tonight
Never had a chance to turn away
The sea is calling now, over the bay
where all brothers lie

[chorus x2]

No more betray, the end of war comes at last
we will never be alone
through shades of gray, the light's age will come at last
