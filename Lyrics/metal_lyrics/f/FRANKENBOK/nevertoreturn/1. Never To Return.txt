In with the new
Mask of virtue
I see through you
Veil of mistruth

In this life there are no guarantees
So don't spend it on your fucking knees
Eat a dick and suck it up son
It's just a game and it's there to be won

Betrayed - never look back
In flames - the nightmare lies behind you
Only memories can haunt you
Wake up - seize the fucking day
Pull back - the horror that consumes you

No more lies

No more blindness, sickness, darkness
Blood-let fucking God
Free from weakness, sickness, darkness
Blood-let fucking God

Fist to face of fucking greed
Crushing the skull of pain
Desire to succeed
Cutting the mental chains

No rest for the wicked
Straight as an arrow shot
Never to return or come down
