[Lyrics: Tim Miedecke, music: Frankenbok]

So I started a cult
We played rock and roll
And took a lot of love
It's amazing what people will do
When they think you're the one
So if you wanna join up
Are you desperate enough?
Is there a gaping hole in your heart
I can fill up with my love?
So I started a cult
Gave the homeless a home
Promised them salvation
And then took em straight to hell
In a hail of bullets
Burned to death en masse in a barn
Took my wives out one by one
When the cops came to ask: "What's going on?"
So I started a cult
I fucked everyone involved
Promised them closure for all their woes
And they all followed me straight to hell!
