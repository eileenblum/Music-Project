[Lyrics: Adam B. Metal, music: Frankenbok]

Kicking and scraping in battle
Dying to uphold forgotten lore
Searching for truth as the honest are silenced
Searching so hope can remain
We are at fault
We are to blame
You will not take this triumph from me
The scars from this war are increasing
Showing the passion these soldiers hold
Fighting and spilling their blood for the cause
Fighting so hope can remain
