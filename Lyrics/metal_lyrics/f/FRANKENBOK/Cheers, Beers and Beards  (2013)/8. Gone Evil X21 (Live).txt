Soul lost soul, your god has long forgotten you
Lost soul, you're gone but not forgotten
And the stigma I speak, unspeakable
The souls I reach so unreachable
Thinking it's enough to be solid as one
Until they bring you down
Gone evil by 21
Gone sour down to the roots sprung from a demon seed
Broken beyond help right from the soul I bleed
Scared half to death by things you do not understand and you never will!
I don't know what to feel, I don't feel your pain
I don't hear you 'cause I've gone evil now
With enough rage to upend the world
With enough hate to destroy oneself
