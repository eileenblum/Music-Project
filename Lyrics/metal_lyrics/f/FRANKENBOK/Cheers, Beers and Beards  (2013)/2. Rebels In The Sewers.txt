[Lyrics: Tim Miedecke, music: Frankenbok]

Cold and calculating
Staring at the bottom line
Understanding nothing
About burning, burning fire
Popular opinions
Lowest common denominators
Are setting standards I just cannot endorse
And yesterday's rebellion don't seem to matter anymore
Damn the wants and needs
Of pedantic control freaks
Who don't know what they want
With confusion that's contagious
Blood suckin' leeches
All stalking something
Brow beaten, bleeding
Moving slow towards oblivion
All of us mutated
Sabotage the bottom line
Corrupting your children
Makes us feel justified
