[Lyrics: Tim Miedecke and Dan McDougall, music: Frankenbok]

We had a deal
All cop and feel
A place to stick the knife
And a bullet between the eyes
Cut the rope and watch me fall
To save yourself but damn your soul
Cut the rope and hear me call
Your name in vain the whole way down
Damned in an avalanche
Buried up to my neck
Abandoned and left for dead
And you call yourself a friend
Cut the rope and watch me fall
To save yourself but damn your soul
Cut the rope and hear me call
Your name in vain the whole way down
Neglected, rejected
Bonded by blood no more
Dejected
My brother - betrayer
My brother my betrayer
You looked me right in the eye
Cut the rope and watch me die
Lost cause - we are no more
You cut the rope and lost your soul
Betrayer - my brother no more
No more
