[Lyrics: Tim Miedecke and Dan McDougall]

Give me your medication
Time for annihilation
Look in my eyes they are full of
Self determination
Instant gratification
All thoughts of termination
I've got it all sewn up 'cause
I am all I need
Bottom feeder
Proud to be a
Fucking lost cause
Proud to be a
Bottom feeder
Betraying the cause
I am degeneration
No need for obligation
My mind is all fired up for skullular
Obliteration
I am no new sensation
Destruction brings creation
We have this all sewn up for
We are the new breed
Bottom feeder
Proud to be a
Fucking lost cause
Proud to be a
Bottom feeder
Betraying your lost cause
