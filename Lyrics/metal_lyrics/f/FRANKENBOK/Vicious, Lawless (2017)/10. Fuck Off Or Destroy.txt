[Words: White, music: Frankenbok]

We're here to stay and we've got nothing to lose
The drinks are flowing and the music's loud
We're here for one thing so we've gotta get it right
The stage is home and our hearts are beating
This hell that we're in
Is one of unity and pain relief
A sense of purpose and integrity
The stage is set so let's tear this place down, down down
Let's tear this place down, down, down
Something's coming over me

There is a war within this pit
Step aside from the weight of the crushing depth
We are the same
No sense, no feeling
No room for your ego trip
No time for your politics
We have no time for your shit
So won't you fuck off or destroy

In the pit to survive
It is try or fall, it is do or die
Kill or be killed
And now we're gonna tear this place down, down, down
Let's tear this place down, down, down
Something's coming over me

There is a war within this pit
Step aside from the weight of the crushing depth
We are the same
No sense, no feeling
No room for your ego trip
No time for your politics
We have no time for your shit
So won't you fuck off or destroy

So let me see you raise your fists
Let chaos erupt in this pit
And tear this place down, down, down
Let's tear this place down, down, down, down

There is a war within this pit
Step aside from the weight of the crushing depth
We are the same
No sense, no feeling
No room for your ego trip
No time for your politics
We have no time for your shit
So won't you fuck off or destroy
