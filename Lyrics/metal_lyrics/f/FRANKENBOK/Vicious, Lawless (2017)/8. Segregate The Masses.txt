[Words: White, music: Frankenbok]

I, the chosen one with marks upon my flesh
Inflicted by sadistic human filth that you call...
I don't need your God
Don't want to be a slave to anyone
Or anything that needs to control me

We're taught who we should follow through manipulation
You control the population through segregation
And deprive us of the knowledge and information
To hold us back evolving and expanding our minds
Now we lose ourselves
We're drowning in our shit
And yet we still
Eat from the hand that is feeding it
You're chosen one
These marks upon my flesh
Remind me of the reason why I'll never join your cause
Your cult
Your religion
Your attempt to control freedom

We
We can tell you
That we know all too well that control leads to fear
That's not what we want
What do you think you're providing?

You just think we're pawns
Put here to follow rule
Each scar you make ensures your own demise
Once we're purified
Brainwashed of all our sins
The damage done
Will make us seek revenge for what you've done to us
For your religion
For your need to control freedom

We
We can tell you
That we know all too well that control leads to hate

It's the darker days we leave behind
Too many times we have tried and failed
You want us to seek forgiveness and beg for mercy
Our pain is a telling tale
Now if you can't see what you have done to...
And you've made us bleed, now we'll make you

We the chosen ones
You've cut and scarred or flesh
Each day you breathe brings you closer to death
