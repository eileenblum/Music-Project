[Words: Miedecke, music: Frankenbok]

Hollow and beyond help
That's for sure
Peering down this vortex
To no end
My life flashes before my eyes and I don't care
I think I fear you might be next

They won't tell you this
When you come in here
But that's the starting line
Drawn in the sand

I hope
You run a damn fine race
And take every chance I never had

When every choice you make
Twists like a knife in your side
And every life you take
Kills that sparkle in your eye
The fluid momentum of the downward spiral
Seems like the ride of your life
Only when you reach the bottom
Do you realise you've lost your mind

They won't tell you this
When you get thrown in here
But that's your grave
Dug in the sand

I hope
You run a damn fine race
And take every chance
I never had

I never had

I hope
I hope

I hope
You run a damn fine race
And take every chance I never had

I hope, I hope
I hope, I hope
I hope
