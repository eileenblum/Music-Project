[Words: Miedecke, music: Frankenbok]

Arrested, apprehended, blind-folded
Held without charge
Under suspicion of sedition
Thought crime of the highest treason
I am at large?
Whisked away, balls in a vice, kept in a cage
Interrogated, questioned again and again
Confession coerced
But I'm not guilty

I'd admit to anything
Crying uncle was the only way
Faceless, torturers wanna make the suspect fit the crime

No friends
Abandoned
In the house that
That justice destroyed

Kangaroo court. Corruption.
Trumped up, rigged, on the block
Primed for the guillotine
Guilty 'til proven innocent
But heads started rolling the other way
Now I am bent and twisted out of shape
Like the guy accused of being in the first place
Injustice, rage, medication, therapy
Taking up arms made perfect sense to me

I'd admit to anything
Crying uncle was the only way
Faceless torturers wanna make the suspect fit the crime

No friends
Abandoned
In the house that
That justice destroyed

Couldn't hold down a job
Until some guys that built suicide bombs
Recruited me and my PTSD
To be the wheel man
If you know what I mean...

No
Abandoned
Justice destroyed
No friends
Abandoned
In the house that
Justice destroyed
You animals
