Stalker, stalker
What is your problem? Track me down on the Internet
Stalker, stalker
I'm your obsession
Hide behind your computer screen
Keyboard warrior
Find me, stalk me on social media
And dissect my life
Sifting, searching, always watching
What can I do? Find me, stalk me, lie about me
Stalker, stalker
What is your reason? Track me down on the Internet
Stalker, stalker
I'm your obsession
Appearing normal on the outside
Pure deception
Find me, stalk me, violate me
Bitter, angry for no reason
What lies beneath?
Twisted lunatic that's seething
You're wasting, you're wasting, you're wasting time
On my life, on my life are you insane?
Stalker, stalker
I think I see you
Track me down to my home address
Lurking, peeping and bottom feeding
Faker, fraudster, bunny boiler
Go get some help
Find me, watch me, plotting sickly
Hiding in the shadows waiting for me to pass
Find me, catch me, pull the trigger
You're wasting, you're wasting, you're wasting time
On my life, on my life are you insane?
You're wasting, you're wasting, you're wasting time
On my life, on my life
Are you insane?
How was I your victim of choice?
What made you want me?
Who is the person you seek?
Am I their scapegoat?
Who do you want me to be?
Do they look like me?
Who is this person you seek?
What did they do to you?
Stalker, stalker
I'm your obsession
Track me down to my home address
Stalker, stalker
You have a problem
Lurking, peeping, bottom feeding
Twisted lunatic that's seething
Always watching, pull the trigger
