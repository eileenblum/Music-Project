[Words: Miedecke, music: Frankenbok]

Asunder, run amok
And power corrupts
It's the gateway to hell
Where that earth opens up
Power corruption
It's set in stone
We are fed from the trough
Our flesh stripped from the bone

You can count on us
We are coming and we don't stop
All you build we'll raze
Kill!
Cull!
White knuckle break
Break!

Provocateur, you are not
Ain't know lie
With a mouth sewn shut
There's still truth in the eyes

We got it ... all
But we wanted... more
A glutton, interred
In a tomb of solid

Asunder, run amok
And power corrupts
It's the gateway to hell
Where that earth opens up
(Of solid gold.)
Power corruption
It's set in stone
We are fed from the trough
Our flesh stripped from the bone

Trip wire, fail-safe
No malfunction or mistakes
Out from mud we're born
Army of skeletons
We're all stalked by... death

Death

Provocateur, you are not
Ain't no lie
With a mouth sewn shut
There's still truth in the eyes

We got it... all
Madness
Power
Corruption
But we wanted... more
And we just can't get enough

Got it all, wanted more
Tombs of solid gold
Got it all. wanted more
Fallen
Rome

Provocateur, you are not
Ain't know lie
With a mouth sewn shut
There's still truth in the eyes
Provocateur, you are not
Ain't know lie
With a mouth sewn shut
There's still truth in the eyes

Asunder
Run amok
