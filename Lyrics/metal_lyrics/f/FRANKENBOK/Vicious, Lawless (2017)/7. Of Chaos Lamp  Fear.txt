[Words: White, music: Frankenbok]

It's a brand new day, and I'll take it as comes
Do I lay it on the line or put the mask back on?
It's not as simple as it seems to keep the demons breaking free
And the mind can't trust what the eyes can see

We all walking in an illusion hiding what we really are
It's the death of our convictions and the fear that we instate
From the lying and the bitching and faÃ§ade that we create

Because God forbid we show ourselves for what we really are

It's time we stopped this living lie
The illusion dies the more we try
Can we break the cycle, can we all survive?
Or is it far too late to even try?

We adhere to your rules to keep pretending we are free
But the chains on our backs keep us living on our knees
Our minds aren't strong so we keep the masks on
And still accept the abuse as if it's nothing we can stop

There's a line in the sand that we know that should be crossed
The sentiment is real but the words are all wrong
Degradation, so frustrating, smiling through humiliation
And a deadpan look with a high gloss sheen

It's time we stopped this living lie
The illusion dies the more we try
Can we break the cycle, can we all survive?
Or is it far too late to even try?

It all seems crazy to me
(So fucking crazy to me.)
To hide from what we really want to be

It can't destroy us, we are much stronger than we think

So damning what we do to each other
But knowledge will be the key we use to save us from ourselves

It can't destroy us
We are much stronger than we think
So hear me when I say
It all seems crazy to me

We're not tearing at the fabric of our precious vanity
To break down our obsession and the things that we don't need
Our constant need to follow is the downfall of mankind
So when will we destroy what's been created to control us and manipulate our minds?
