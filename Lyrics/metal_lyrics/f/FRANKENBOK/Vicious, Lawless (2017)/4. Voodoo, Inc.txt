[Words: Miedecke, music: Frankeknbok]

First they make you do things
Then they get inside your mind
Do thy rotten bidding
Even if it's not your style
They're crawling all over
Jabbing tendrils in
Spreading soul eating corruption
Rebellion, forbidden

Pushing pins
Into your eyes
They only unwind the vice
When you go and do what they like

Corporation Voodoo
Corporation Voodoo

First they make you like it
Then they make you dependent
Dangle carrot stick
Leave you hallowed without a hit

Sticking needles
Into your balls
They only switch on the orgasmatron
When you go and fuck who they want

Corporation Voodoo
Corporation Voodoo

Queue jumpers
Bean counters of the lowest denomination
But you don't hate them
As much as you wanna be one of their flock
So sayeth the Shepard
So sayeth the flock
So sayeth the Shepard
So sayeth the flock
So sayeth the Shepard
So sayeth the flock
So sayeth the Shepard
So sayeth the flock
So sayeth the Shepard
So sayeth the flock
So sayeth the Shepard
So sayeth the flock
