[Words: Miedecke, music: Frankenbok]

Drive it in

Too much? Not enough?
Searching but sanity unfound
Resourceful pauper and
Upper echelon
That cannot live without
Drive it into the ground
Soul fracking, metaphysical gold mine
You cannot plunder my mind

Drive it into the ground
Drive it home
Drive it into the ground
Drive it home
Drive it in

Can you or can you not
Get by with precious little?
Or are you held hostage
By the delusion and the material?
Drive it into the ground
Soul fracking, metaphysical gold mine
You cannot pillage my mind

You wouldn't wanna live a little
Let alone, give a little bit more
You can't take it with you
In a coffin with an AK-47
And an untaxed fortune

Drive it into the ground
Drive it home
Drive it into the ground
Drive it in
Drive it into the ground
Drive it in

Drive it right here
Over the edge
Pull out the pin
And let it rip
Drive it in
Drive it right here
Over the edge
Pull out the pin
And let it rip
