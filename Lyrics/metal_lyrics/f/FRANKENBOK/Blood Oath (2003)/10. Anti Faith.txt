Blind, your blind, you cant see your flaws and mistakes
A waste this time has been spent
Lies, all lies! I'll spoil this reflection cause
I will not destroy all that's left
I'm falling back to where I lay now I will sleep
The line has been drawn. The ball's in your court now
And don't you waste a second of time
Try, just try! Excuses will not be excused, you'll lose again, lose again
My anti-faith!!!
I'm falling away, leading astray, now I will fall where I sleep
