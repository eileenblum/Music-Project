I've got such a rage, burning up inside
More than I can take now
Here it comes, eclipse the sun, you cannot stop the blackest rush
I've got such a rage burning deep inside
More than I can take, this is my hate
Heart is cold where blood don't flow
Flame on burning rage, for the deepest scars
Glowing ember hate, bleeding those pitch black hearts
