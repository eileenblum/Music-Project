It cannot be erased, what was lived and said
It cannot be erased, the life, the soul, the agonising wait
You think it's all ok? Why does everything die?
I've dealt with this pain now I will carry on
Keep on pushing keep on surviving the fight
Keep on pushing it, I dare you to levitate
Keep on pushing it, pushonup, pushonup
Knew it would come to this, so unprepared for the guilt
The outcome came at the most inopportune time
Not ready for the hardship, but I'm not to decide
I must accept this draw, I've dealt with this pain, now I will carry on
