Behold, I've fallen down, ripped out of my head
Once alive, now more or less dead
A doomed control freak has lost it all
I just want to feel alive and run the gauntlet one more time
Centre attention, corpse at the requiem
Lost all hope with my only friend
Now he has turned his back and said never again.
