I don't want your problems, I'm so sick of this
Cause all I see is dirty green hands
You can't believe what you think you see
The understanding is that we are the victims!
You say what you want then leave the pieces
Hey we are the victims! [x3]
We'll pick up your pieces
I don't want your problems, I'm part of it
The reason your kicking and screaming like a bitch
Rather watch you suffer, watch you drown inside
The hatred and the shame you project into our eyes
