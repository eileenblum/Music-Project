Safe, welded shut in this mould so secure
The lowest common denominator has lost its allure
Behind every man, there is a silicone chip
Behind every wall, they're all pale, weak and

SICK! PROCESSED, CONSUME THE FORCE OF MAN

You, you can't shape me, i'm self aware. You, you can't change me

Tell me are you human? Do you even care?
This humanoid machine is lost sometime, somewhere
Do you even care? I'm unaware that you're a slave
For you're PROCESSED.
