Got to take the cause of the flaw and attempt to
remedy it. It's best you take this fall on your
own. I can not pretend to be lord to man or anti-
judicial...

Just hang your fate and abort...

Once in a little while while you'll feel dunce for
the little miles you stroll, and dunce for every-
thing that you can't mould...
(makes no or little difference to those...)

To feel is flaw?

Got to take the cause of the flaw and attempt to
remedy it. Yes I fear the grain and anti-
properacy. I have all along.

Bless me with the vision that I want to be...

Dunce with denial...
