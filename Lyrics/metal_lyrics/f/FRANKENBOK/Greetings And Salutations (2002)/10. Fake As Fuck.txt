I see the clear not distorted and you're as fake as
fuck as fuck there is a smear in your case and
it's as fake as fuck I could not ever assort you
from the fake and funk there's that smirk in
applause that makes it fake as fuck rehearsed
and fake as fuck...

There's that smirk in applause that makes it
fake as fuck I shepherded my pride that I'm not
as fake as fuck cannot find sincerity in the fake
and funk...

Panorama &amp; personas and you're as fake as
fuck yet nothings you forge I have lost the count
of all the many you they're often acts and social
pains impressions that don't last a day so cake
on the fake and kill truth so cake on the fake
and charade well I find time to be shifty and
stray take on flavour fake as fuck and typical...
