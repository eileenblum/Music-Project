In truth I clone for a compensation for it's a
means to adhere to foes...
But it's feeling great to date and I clone you
but Mines not mine to mime!

Bungle Jazz funk combinations always see
applause, but the plagiarisation is the flaw and
I'm compared to him...
Yes I did dub him and mines not mine to mime.
You gotta forge for all to see.
The P.Cloned fraud in me
the lack of originality
The P.Cloned fraud that's me
(a Mike Patton wanna be!)
I don't need complications of out being heard
before, I don't need no cunt to say I just wanna be Mike...
