He feeds human puppies
From the paternal tit
The symbiotic bond keeps
The fantasy alive
They're weened and you're gone
Alone in your shame
There to begin the new cycle of repeat

You will never learn
A disappointing, shit talking fleeting friend
You will never learn
You're God's gift to no one
A junkie to ego
Sometimes in life
You get pissed on
And fucked in the face
To control your own fate
You must first learn from your mistakes

Living in a fantasy
Stuck on repeat
Again you run home
To escape your deceit

It buries it's head into it's own arse
That stinks so good it hides the rotten fact
That it's a liar - now a pariah
Cast out in shame to begin the new cycle of defeat

You will never learn
A disappointing, shit talking fleeting friend
You will never learn
You're god's gift to no one
A junkie to ego
Sometimes in life
You get pissed on
And fucked in the face
To control your own fate
You must first learn from your mistakes

Living a fantasy
Stuck on repeat
Again you run home
To escape your deceit

Gods gift to no one
Gods gift to no one
Gods gift to no one
You're dead to me son

No tear will fall
On the suffering stench
That lay in a heap
As I walk from prison to freedom
Dive for the noose
Dive for the noose
Dive for the noose
They cycle will be complete
Will you ever learn?
You will never learn!
Will you ever learn?
You will never learn!
Will you ever learn?
You will never learn!
Will you ever learn?
Not fuckin' likely
CUNT!
