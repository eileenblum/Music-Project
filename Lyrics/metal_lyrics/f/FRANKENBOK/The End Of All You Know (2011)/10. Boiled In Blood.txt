Are you feeling afraid?
Do you need someone to blame?
Is free speech compromised
When you don't agree?
Rage over-flowing
Ideas in your brain are congealing
Does the thermometer in your ass
Have mercury rising?

Boiled in blood
Are you feeling enraged?
Are you happy, afraid?
Do you live broken hearted
And full of pain?
Follow the leader with someone to blame
Lynch mobs and pied pipers
Running haywire, at large
Insane

Boiled in blood
