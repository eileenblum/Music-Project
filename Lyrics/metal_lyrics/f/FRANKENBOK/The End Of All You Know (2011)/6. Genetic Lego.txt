It's alive!
Labs teaming with mad scientists
Playing jigsaw puzzles with genetic experiments
Round pegs and square holes just don't seem to fit
So we rip, tear and shred
And create some horrible new shit
And I wonder: are we God?
Creating mongoloid babies and incurable disease
NO!
We've created a monster that has slipped the leash

So concerned about whether or not they could
That they never stopped to think if they should
Cannot see the forest for the trees
Another eco-system with missing links and out crawls disease
And I wonder: are we God?
Creating mongoloid babies and incurable disease
NO!
We've created a monster that has slipped the leash

And I wonder: are we God?
Creating mongoloid babies and incurable disease
NO!
We've created a monster that has slipped the leash
