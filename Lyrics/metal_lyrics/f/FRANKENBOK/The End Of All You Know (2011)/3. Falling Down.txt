Today was a day like no other day
I put my feet down and screamed "I've fucking had it!"
I have had it with this sad hypocrisy
And what is meant to be a civilised society

NO MORE!
I won't back down again
A great way is raging in my mind
Ignore what I used to think as reason
And bear the brunt for all mankind
I've fallen down and I'm never getting up again
Apocalyptic HIGH
Laid to waste are all my mortal enemies
I drowned 'em all in a sea of rage and hatred
Losing all was the key to my epiphany
Set free from my over-bearing apathy

NO MORE!
I won't back down again
A great war is raging on in my mind
Abhor what I used to know as reason
And be the saviour for all of mankind

APOCALYPTIC HIGH

I have fallen down again
I am never getting up again
I have fallen down again
I've fallen down again
I am never getting up again
Apocalyptic high
I've fallen down and I'm never coming back again
An eye for an eye

No more
Great war
No more
To live for

Spewing forth are all these thoughts of anarchy
I can't stop it it's eating up my insides
Raise my fist to destroy this weak democracy
And build a one man autocracy

NO MORE!
I won't back down again
A great way is raging on in my mind
Abhor what I used to know as reason
And be the saviour for all of mankind

Apocalyptic high
I have fallen down again
I am never getting up again
I have fallen down again
I've fallen down and I am never getting up again
Apocalyptic high
I've fallen down and I'm never coming back again
And eye for an eye

No more
Great war
No more
To die for

The truth has spoken
Spirit unbroken
Today outspoken
I just want to see God
I just want to play God
I just want to be a God
