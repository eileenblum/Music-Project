All guts and glory
We'll make you pay this time
Re-write the story
Repent now for your crimes
Break you down
Destroy you
We'll bleed you fucking dry
Bring you down
Dissect you
Feed you your empty eyes

This is the end of all you know

We are strong in number
United by one goal
Our lightning and thunder
We'll cast down on your soul
No longer fit to rule
The time has come to relent
Pathetic creation
Tear down and re-invent

This is the end of all you know
All you fucking know

This is the end
Of all you know

No more false prophets 
We'll burn them one and all
Powerless to stop it
We'll have complete control
Take you down
Despise you
And show you no respect
Smack you down
Defile you
What else did you expect?
This is the end of all you know
