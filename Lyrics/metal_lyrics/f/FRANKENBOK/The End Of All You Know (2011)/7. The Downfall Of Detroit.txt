DOWNFALL!

Decaying monument to human greed
Assembly-line shut down - rotting decree
The jewel in the crown of our western beliefs
Now plays the dead hand of false democracy

This is the natural order of things
As goes Detroit - then so goes the world
Artificial obsolescence - true essence
So say goodbye to the American dream
Driven to the end of the line
BLEED!
All our resources dry
The end is nigh
So long Detroit, and so long the world
Global madness
Spreading your disease all over the earth

Back to nature
Lord and master
Feel my rapture
This is the natural order of

Industrial waste-land so rank and obscene
A civilisation corrupt to the core
Tear it all down and wipe the slate clean
This is our new fight - this is our war
Dead arsenal of capitalist greed

As goes Detroit - then so goes the world
Artificial obsolescence - true essence
So say goodbye to the American dream
Driven to the end of the line
BLEED!
All our resources dry
The end is nigh
So long Detroit, and so long the world
Global madness
Spreading your disease all over the earth

Back to nature
Lord and master
Feel my rapture
This is the natural order of things

This is the natural order of things
As goes Detroit, then so goes the world
This is the natural order of things
This is the natural order of things

DOWNFALL!
The writing is on the wall
Downfall
Downfall

Back to nature
Lord and master
Feel my rapture
This is the natural order of things
