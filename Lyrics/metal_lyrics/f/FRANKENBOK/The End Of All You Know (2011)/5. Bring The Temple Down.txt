Howling like lunatics in this place we live
Contraband flowing free
Amongst the spiteful, nose-less faces
Of the dead reigning supreme

Join our cult
We won't negotiate
Or listen to reason
We'll kill ourselves and hold you to blame

Our ancestors
Each mongoloid generation
Will hold a grudge through centuries
And teach vengeance and hate
Our polluted blood line
A gene pool tepid, sterile
Bring it down, turn our home
Into a grave with a fuck you tombstone

Join our cult
We won't negotiate
Or listen to reason
We'll kill ourselves and hold you to blame

Oh, masters of your domain
We're using your utopia as a cage
We'll bring the temple down on our own heads
Just to kill you our own way

A revenge taking 50 years
You can't forbid us - we're already here
While you graze and congratulate
We're fattening you up like prey

Join our cult
We won't negotiate
Or listen to reason
We'll kill ourselves and hold you to blame
Oh, masters of your domain
We're using your utopia as a cage
We'll bring the temple down on our own heads
Just to kill you our own way

Join our cult
Join our cult
Join our cult
We'll kill you all
