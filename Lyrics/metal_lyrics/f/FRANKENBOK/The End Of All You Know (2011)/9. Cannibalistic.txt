Belly full of flesh
And blood and bone
I've had it all
But I want some more
Colossal feast
A black mass
And a god that takes his prayers in pounds of human flesh
Carnivorous, lunatics
Witch hunts, voodoo
And man eating freaks
Carnivores, apocalypse
Auto cannibalistic

Carnal-lunar-frenzy
Lord of the flies, lonely
Kingdom come, starving
Eat your heart out baby!

Ritual
Blessed tradition
Only once devoured can you be delivered
Belly full of flesh
Guts over flow
Black mass of bodies
Regurgitated souls
Carnivorous, lunatics
With hunts, voodoo
And man eating freaks
Carnivorous, apocalypse
Auto cannibalistic
Blood dripping from your lips...

Carnal-lunar-frenzy
Lord of the flies, lonely
Kingdom come, starving
Eat your heart out baby!
