Push the button
It's time to push the button
Destroying the gap
Between the pauper and the glutton
Crush the atom
Oh God - unleash destruction
Eat the turgid squalor of this creation

In a flash
A blinding white flash
Eliminate the epidemic
Of sentient trash
In a flash
Let all the markets crash
This downfall will lead
To the ultimate clash

BURN! Burn it all down
Down to the ground
Reclaim the crown
Tonight we dine in hell

GET DOWN! We've come for your kingdom
STAY DOWN! Hand over the keys
GET DOWN! Won't take no for an answer
Get down there you fuckâ¦
DOWN ON YOUR FUCKING KNEES!

It's the ultimate violence
It's the ultimate show
You must pay for the crime
Of us needing to grow
There is no one solution
To this shit consequence
We now have to attack you
It's our only defense

BURN! Burn it all down
Down to the ground
Reclaim the crown
Tonight we dine in hell

BURN! Burn it all down
Down to the ground
Reclaim the crown
Tonight we dine in hell

BURN IT ALL DOWN
