Digging... for human bones
Digging... on my own
Dig: hole in my head
Things falling in
I never hear no splash
...It's like a dead fall with
NO END... but I keep digging
Digging... skulls and bones
Digging... decompose
Crawling over a dead fall of
Human bones - the blood is
BACK in the light of the moon
Crawling, falling on them bones
The blood is black down in this hole
Digging... get this into ya!!
Digging... in the dead of the
Night
Digging... the pale moon light
ON MY OWN
