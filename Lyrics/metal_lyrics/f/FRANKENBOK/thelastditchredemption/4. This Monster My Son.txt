Dear Son,
where did we go wrong? Could this have been stopped? This monster, my son, what is going on? Where did we go wrong?
This monster my blood.
Why could you never ever stop? This monster my son. This monster my blood! Where did we go wrong? Couldn't it be stopped?
This monster my only son.
Where did we go wrong? When you were born? I thought you were the sweetest thing of all... Then you deformed...
WRONG. WRONG. WRONG!!!
I just couldn't love you anymore.
Your Mother.
