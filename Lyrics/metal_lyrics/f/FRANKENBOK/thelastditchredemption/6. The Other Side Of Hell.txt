This is
The other side of hell
No more dark clouds
No longer without light
No longer sinking
On this side of hell
Snake charmer from a slithering world
To be half as noble
Would surely make you whole
The other side of
God Damn Mother Fucking Hell
Eyes blood shot like road maps of the soul
Destroyed
Rebuilt
Beyond hell and on the way home
