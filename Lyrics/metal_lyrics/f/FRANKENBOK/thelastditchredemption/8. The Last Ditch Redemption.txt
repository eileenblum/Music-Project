Take all you're worth in pounds of flesh
Before you sink back down to hell
Every soul you can save
Could stop ice pumping through your veins
Or the past might eat you up
I see demons every shape they come
Last ditch redemption
Brave souls who can face the dark
Get one last ditch redemption
Under bombardment block the gauntlet
I fear no consequence
Reaching down preventing innocence
Descending into self destruction
Through broken stain glass of your soul
I see them, every shape they come
All those who forget the past are
Condemned to repeat it
Brave sould who can face the dark
Get one last ditch redemption.
