Open your wings and fly with angel of virtue
I am becoming something more than servile
I have this will to aspire
That don't concern you
I have some other things but I'll write!
Open your wings and fly
Through the cut open slit of desire
Open your wings and just try to
Trait convert to some other things
Did I suffer motherfucker?
Deeds are the things that hold structure
With me and it hurts people
This is where I belong
This is where I'm omitted
This is where I can go
As there's work to be done
now that I'm free
It hurts people!
