Every night we are on the road
To push aside tomorrow
Chasing more of the liquid gold
No use for guilt or sorrow

Then there's always that wise-ass guy
Getting straight into out face
Tells us stuff like know your place
We are a hopeless case

So tired of your tale, every day the same old tune
We won't quit anyway and we don't care 'bout your stand
Leave us alone, we are the fellowship of the boon
All we need on our last trip, put a bottle in our hand

As the night and drinks go on
We continue wasting time
Doing nothing but having fun
This is our night to shine

We strut around like we own the place
And put the nice guys on the shelf
We will take care of all your girlfriends
They will enjoy themselves

So tired of your tale, every day the same old tune
We won't quit anyway and we don't care 'bout your stand
Leave us alone, we are the fellowship of the boon
All we need on our last trip, put a bottle in our hand

Get us more Jack
We're starving here
Move your ass darling, else we destroy the place
Just bring the bottle... and get out of our way

So tired of your tale, every day the same old tune
We won't quit anyway and we don't care 'bout your stand
Leave us alone, we are the fellowship of the boon
All we need on our last trip, put a bottle in our hand

Need just one more round
Like the man said: death or glory
