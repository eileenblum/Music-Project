I've been a wild rover for many a year
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
And never I'll play the wild rover no more

I went to a shanty I used to frequent
And told the landlady my money were spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay,"
Saying, "Customers like you I can get any day."

And it's no nay never
No nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more

I drew from my pocket ten sovereigns bright
The landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
Saying, "I have the whiskey and wine of the best
And the words that I told you were only in jest."

And it's no nay never
No nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more

I'll go home to my parents, tell them what Iâve done
And hope they will pardon their prodigal son
And if they will do as so often before
No never I'll play the wild rover no more

And it's no nay never
No nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more
