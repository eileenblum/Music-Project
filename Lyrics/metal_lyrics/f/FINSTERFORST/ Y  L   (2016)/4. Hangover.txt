Last night I just went for a beer
A quick one â after work relaxing
Sat there, nothing on my mind
Enjoying my hard earned break

The doors swung open
And here
They stood in the shining light
All of my boys
They're looking thirsty
And asked "Are you ready to go?"
Oh no

Hangover â left all my cash behind
Hangover â amnesia and no regain
Hangover â the perfect day to die
Fucking hangover â I'll never drink again

One shot â heard around the bar
The kick-off to a boozy journey
One shot â resolutions's end
Bar-hopping from dusk til dawn

Bring us the bottle
Let's waste no more time, let's waste ourselves
No tomorrow boys
Fuck the last order
So here we go again
Again

Hangover â left all my cash behind
Hangover â amnesia and no regain
Hangover â the perfect day to die
Fucking hangover â I'll never drink again

Damn, this is going to end bad
Hangover

Hangover â left all my cash behind
Hangover â amnesia and no regain
Hangover â the perfect day to die
Fucking hangover â I'll never drink again

Damn hangover â feels like I'm going blind
Hangover â who's gonna clean those puke stains
Hangover â who is this guy besides?!
Fucking hangover â will never drink again
Fuck, give me that goddamn beer
