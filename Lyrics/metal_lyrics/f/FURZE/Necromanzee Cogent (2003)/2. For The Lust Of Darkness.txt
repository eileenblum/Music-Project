Thereâs a plague in my soul
Can you help me reach my goal
Is it for the light to come
So say it is right
Thereâs a shade by my soul
I saw...
And did hear your (gruesome) howl
Tell me more
And I could
-at least-
Gleaming predictions
Know forever more
Exposure of fright
For the illusions of might
Drowned by night
All life we must fight
