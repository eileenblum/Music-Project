1) they burnt... the now
They burnt
The now...
Is a rotten
Flower

2) scolopendraarise
The relics
Merry ohâ merry
Feed by the throne
Of great hypocrisy

3) as-if zaredoo
Be-Carnal
MUST tide their autumn
To reap, reap.... reap
REAP!

4) transist
The new
Inquisistion
As-Of devakasha
To reveal

5) âsathanas
Say-red-do
(final fall)
Be-Cause
Itâs too lateâ

6) be
Cause
Be-Cause
Be-Cause
Be..(a part of thy past)

7) reap...
Reap...
Reap...
