[Lyrics are by Woe J. Reaper. Winter 2005]

I am the Bonedrum
I am very careful with my words
If the need in seeing the unknown
Is the unknown speaking
...you can talk to me
Dance
Make the word grief in lust...

Wildfire must
Lance of owner
Ain't it loner's boom in need of doom
Ain't it blooming
To hit the drum
Before you die
Answered in owner's conscious fire-water
Drowned to earth
Pleased by pleads' mirrorsysytems
Or coherently keep drumming
All night...
