[Lyrics are by Woe J. Reaper. January 2009]

When is shaped the true golden age of furze?
Black holes in the middle of galaxies
A monstrous death creator
Is firmly standing tall crowning
It's ultimate great lifeforce...
"Stars obey to shine"
Life and death walks hand in hand?
Something (that's) started
A riding wheel
Eternally anything that eternally didn't

Death's true trademark and wisdom

May penetrate all that (which) starts and ends...
If one keeps remembering
That which never started nor ever ends
To work like mirrors to all mortality
When is shaped the true golden age of furze?

Overlord to all religious answers
Seems never producing the one question
For him to participate in time and space
(to ride) as the king he really is...
