[Lyrics are by Woe J. Reaper. 2008]

So proud...
So proud should the god Wotan
Be on the behalf of paganism
For knowing he does not stand
Side-by-side with The Reaper

This is the picture of the

(1) thing
(2) god-thing
(and all other half eternities included)
(3) The Eternal Reaper

Essential wait
Essential wait
For knowing in the moment

Essential wait
Essential wait
Glimpses while waiting for the moment
