[Lyrics are by Woe J. Reaper. August 2007]

To choose or not to choose what moves me
To choose that it moves me
Or to choose to move it
That resistance that has to be chosen
That makes a flow reach;
'Oo Ra
High above day, to it...
Alone in the night hall
Like no-wall adopted to shell shores

To choose or not to chose
What moves me
May be the power
That makes me write...

Like if the moon shines on my house
In the forest when
It can nearly see half the truth therin
And a mandrake reaching
Out of the corner of the house
To chose a sight with the burning moon flame...

The burning moon flame
