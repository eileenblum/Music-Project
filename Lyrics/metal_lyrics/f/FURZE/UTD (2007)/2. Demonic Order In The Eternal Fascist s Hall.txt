[Lyrics: April 2003]

The Demon with a Way to dwell
Haunting, final and tear appart on an Unnoticed wealth
Flamelife insect, ghastly walks on souls
Pens write and Lick in the airtouch

Darkness in gore-like stench
Incarnated for a Hatemission and for a Madness
Sharing around in the garden of this planet
Shadowcast; the very hat of it

To Torture Them Beyond Death Is The Heaven They Deserve
Shadowstench, Deathpace; we're on course!
On the behalf of Eternal Pride; I shadowcast the Very Map of it
