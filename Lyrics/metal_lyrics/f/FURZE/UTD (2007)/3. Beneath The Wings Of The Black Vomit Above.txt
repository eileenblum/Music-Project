[Lyrics: Summer 2004]

No 1 Asks at the Known End's Edge it's clearest answer
No 2 Temporarily controls No 1's fear of No 3
No 3 Strays out away from all relations
No 1 Names No 2 "HALF-ETERNITY"
No 2 (don't) reply to that
No 3 Will sometime be pure

No 1 Must think of No 1 as No 1 in action and end
No 2 May have replyed but also eventually made that question...
No 3 Is the Only one at last; No 1 and No 2 blindly related

They blindly related, for some (knew)...
For Black is the holy Unholy...is this the call for existence
Stimulating the unrelated Woe.  Sold as one as Everything.
