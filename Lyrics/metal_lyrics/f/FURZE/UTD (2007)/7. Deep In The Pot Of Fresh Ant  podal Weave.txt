[Lyrics: April 2004 - shortened version]

On course, my pentagram
Describing the course
The direction enforce -
Sharp and Dark

Starface Enlightened

Love the Vibe
Cold untold
Pen is grasped
Blood unmasked

the upper left, the horn of reflection
thought down in dark subconscious

Daemonium furtherings
Swimming letters, runic headshores
The upper right, the horn for throwing reflection
Precise at goal here in the dark

For a clear thought is born!
which is down left
crossing to the quantum of receivings
- and where thereof

There when (you) know when
There when (it is) now (the) fully encircled
It Is Here Again
