I raise or I fall; time, fate, fear â
-letâs not any longer bother there âehhaeh!??!
Well, well, devacamo have dakasha â
Devacamo â davacamo in dakasha â
Even clearity disappears in certain pictures â
Dakasha remains silent death-pictures â
âas also you are the element
-as silent star as-
That which beyond witching rooaaar
New new new new new echo old caw ââ
My furze come(s) in pain
Brings light over leizla
Confused minds possess black
Pentagram
Reveals our plane when
The trident draws the circle
