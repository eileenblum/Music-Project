Chanting the wide drape
The char and the moment
Of the holy church
World at his feet
Avail the autocrat of evil
That which evoke euthanasia
To inform your mind
-as child-
Again to channel power;
Avail the autocrat of evil
âto live this second
So abnormously clear
That life as an aeon
Whispers but faintly
-disappear-â
âto be the actual
Comet in the sense
Of the star
That life transforms into when death is
-born-â
Avail the autocrat of evil
In the moment of
Sour earth
And the flowers growth up there
-now-
