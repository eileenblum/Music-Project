The crucifix...
At the graveyard of a single corpse
Made by to bloody bones and a gut
The soul of a whore had been cursed
-as the existence-
Zaredoo knives â endows thy sight
Zaredoo knives â endows thy sight
Of this graveyard...
In which this
Chilly picture
-unknown deseCreator-
Are the Only (timeless existence)
Zaredoo knives â endows thy sight
Zaredoo knives â endows thy sight
âThe creation of the crucifix
Her mark of death
-Cursed her soul
Second is forever
-frozen pictures
Seen by burning eyes...â
