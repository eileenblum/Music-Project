Coming forth like the Spring the consciousness dwells 
Knowing the self but hidden inside it's own shell
The Dark Soul crucified inside a piece of flesh
Crucified for the sudden Springs and the sudden Deaths

Crucified to hate Jesus Christ and falseness
Standing against mankind perceptions gone make-believe
Soul is hungry for Black Metal stimulation
Gout Cyclus...

It urges for the flesh to revel and suck out
Juices of the Night...
Wanting to bath in the time of the mandrake beyond
the rays of the moon flame,,.

Ghosting at the heart mother
Invades the house of the hybreed father
Baphomet calls you - helpless you are
Lucifer strides within you next Winter
Now it's time to seal the rime...

The creator needs life, it's give and take
to keep young he must have your blood back...
He gave you life - life on evil terms,
Now you must fulfill the plan - Now you must fulfill the plan!
for The Return...

Goat Cyclus...Goat Cyclus!
