Support the Devil
Support the Metal
Support the Fresh Tea from the Underground

Support the Devil
Support the Metal
Support the Fresh Tea from the Underground

Chronical gates are waste
Senses are black with hate
Three branches in wait
For a coming that is endlessly late

Support the Devil
Support the Metal
Support the Fresh Tea from the Underground

Support the Devil
Support the Metal
Support the Fresh Tea from the Underground

If you encounter each direction
and choose a fiction
You return to flower the seed
that was already planned as unholy weed

One Night before the Other...One Night before the Other.

[Lyrics: May '14]
