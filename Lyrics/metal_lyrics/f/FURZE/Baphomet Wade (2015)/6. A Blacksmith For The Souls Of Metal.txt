The Power of the Goat of a Thousand Young
What's within the soul
Steady roller coaster syndrome
The Moon has a reserved spot in any painting
The sound of the Moon..
To rise a fate
So true it can't be realized "here"
Distillation of reality
With the new moon a new glimpse
A blacksmith of the Metal seed
The Caw...
up bursts lightening between our minds
United by hatred!

A blacksmith for the souls of Metal 
A blacksmith for the souls of Metal 
...souls of Metal...
A blacksmith for the souls of Metal 
...for the souls of Metal!

[Lyrics: December '12/January '13]
