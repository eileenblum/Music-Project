Woe to you...
I was born dead
It was three nights and three hours before fullmoon
I am The Reaper

There has been found away to brew the pot of Armageddon
When times tell you this it answers to make it happen by wish
Pragmatic the reflection of a Woe, in waters of wisdom and hate, by time
One does (...) make misty eyes winged but now also penetrating
within the Golden Walls
Man
I see you've got an hypnotic stench
-within your mind
-soul
Strangled, Burnt, Buried and Drowned
Would I let you like the way to spirit any kind of a 
"One Last Word"?
Are you preset to sacrifice?
Are you preset to sacrifice?
