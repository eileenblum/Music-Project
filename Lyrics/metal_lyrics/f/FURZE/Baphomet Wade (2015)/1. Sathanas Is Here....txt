Here one night I was given the disturbance
of Sathanas, in a dram physically in twilight,
of the subconscious; He appeared

Strange yet a feeling (of something) deeply familiar
,of existence; was flickering with my perceiving,
like a thick needle touching my brain...

One "part" felt missing after the occurrence
but I can tell you He spoke without speaking
like a direct Power...

-it was not just a dram
This is Satan's land
Realize it now as the horrors shake
it's rock'n knuckles all around!

Sathanas' here. Sathanas is here

(I saw) He was the one walking on two cloven hooves
Horns on head, His robe in which was the last thing
He let me remember; it wasn't black, but red on the outside.

And the days since then 
Have been filled like a...
Potion!
