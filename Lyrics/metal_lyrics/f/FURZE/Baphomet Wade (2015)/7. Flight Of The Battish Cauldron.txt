Don't hunt the Wolf
I tell you, don't hunt the Wolf
Crystallizing gaze from the dark realms
from beneath the heart of the pure instinct
I met a man, the monster was not present
He held a crossover speech howled up to for Millenniums 
He was the wolf-man
Nature Wisdom Incarnate 
Yet beside him was this abstractly large cauldron
boiling with ascending powers of...
Satan!
Satan!
Hunt down the wolf-hunter
Let us foresee
Let all winged masters ask us
through the fog
So that alien or not 
Reality can uncover
Thy Half-Eternal Glory

[Lyrics: 14/3-2014]
