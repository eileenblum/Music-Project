In a bucket of blood the brew was made
upon an altar as ancient as (the perceiving of) time...
No crown on head
perished was blood thru holes down, by desert wands
Fog and brain collapse distilled reality

Put Force by Satan's Command

(just as) the Thriller of the holy trinity, founded
yet pleasures of deseCreation is an ancient ritual for Power
- it still has a deep unseen
Those who are ready to make crop circles, maybe...
The mermaid in the depths, oh tiny tastes...
-the Wind of the entire nature's laws
pushed forward by rapid rolling apples so alien
that no storm will ever (even) be seen
the hybreed so grotesque that the crumbling altars of madness
will lose it's hold on the bucket of blood
when the appearing angels of Destruction takes a sip from the box
buried beneath the desert sand...
Ready to go on with our world they open up the center of earth to
Sacrifice it's heart to rebuild
a Power with the materials we never even knew we had...

The Wind of the entire nature's laws
may very well be ONE element; 
When the ancient alien powers return to propose a Toast to their neighbors at war...
