Father of victory
My life I lay down to thee
Steep me in majesty
And forth send thy Valkyries!

Father of victory
My sword I offered unto thee
Crown me for eternity
In Valhalla now welcome me!

Father of victory
Behold! Your true son am i
As einherjer I stand
In your honor for to fight!

Father of victory
Thou who reigns supreme
Ride wild a hunting
O'er fires on the battlefield
