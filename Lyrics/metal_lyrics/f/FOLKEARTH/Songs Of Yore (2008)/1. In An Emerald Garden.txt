Come my love, we'll leave this here land-
I'll take you far by paths no mortal knows
In an emerald garden, under new-born stars
And there my love we could be as once before...

I'll make you a gown of lilies and pearls
To wear on the day we exchange vows
In an emerald garden, under an azure sky,
There my dear child we could love as before...
