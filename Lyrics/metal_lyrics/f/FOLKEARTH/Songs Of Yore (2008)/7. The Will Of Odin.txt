Stars a' glimmer in a valley sheer,
Steel is drawn and shines in moonlight
The heavens quake then pour heavy rain
Thunders announce the bloody battle's eve...

The wheel of the sun is carved on my shield
And so are the runes of Thor on my sword!
Odin's blood has blessed my spear
Invincible I am

Dare stand in my path!

We crossed the sea in a dragon-ship
We braved the fury of the waves
We've come here for war, we bring woe
Fires that shall burn high and rise to the sky!
Odin ride forever by our side

Thy will is grim but it will be done!
Tyr embrace in thy might your sons

Freyja weave thy spell of magic...

The wheel of the sun is carved on my shield
And so are the runes of Thor on my sword!
Odin's blood has blessed my spear
Invincible I am

Dare stand in my path!
