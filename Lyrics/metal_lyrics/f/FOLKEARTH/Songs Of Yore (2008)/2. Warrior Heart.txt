He who alone faces thousands,
He who stands when all kneel,
He who walks where few dare,
He whose voice speaks the truth...

Is a true man of honor,
A spirit unbowed;
And in his chest is a'pounding
A warrior's heart!

He who holds virtue sacred,
He who loves the Fatherland,
He who fights for his people,
He who surrenders to none...

Is a true man of honor,
A spirit unbowed;
And in his chest is a'pounding
A warrior's heart!

He whose soul has no price,
He whose eyes are not dark,
He whose sword brings justice,
He whose name is put to song...

Is a true man of honor,
A spirit unbowed;
And in his chest is a'pounding
A warrior's heart!
