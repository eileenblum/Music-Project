Vikings blood brothers
Fighting in the name of Oden
This song celebrates your glory

Vikings masters of blood
Feared by all their enemies
This is your anthem

Looming from the mist
Drakkars messengers of death
Thousand of spears
impaling the innocents
Raining blood
On the battlefield

Looming from the mist
Drakkars messengers of death

Vikings blood brothers
Fighting in the name of Oden
This song celebrates your glory

Vikings masters of blood
Feared by all their enemies
This is your anthem
