Never to surrender, never to turn and flee,
That is the creed, thus is the law!
Always to fight, always to stand even when all is lost,
That is the code of the warrior!

Never to betray, never a coward prove,
That is the creed, thus is the law!
Always to draw steel in the pallid face of death,
That is the code of the warrior!

Never to fear, never to yield or give in,
That is the creed, thus is the law!
Always to be brave, sail for the hither shore,
That is the code of the warrior!

Never to cry, never to miss the joys of life,
That is the creed, thus is the law!
Always to uphold, shed your blood for kin and land,
That is the code of the warrior!

Never to father, never to be found weak,
That is the creed, thus is the law!
Always to be strong, ready for Valhallaâs hall,
That is the code of the warrior!

Never to keep silent when the truth is assailed,
That is the creed, thus is the law!
Always to stand up and be counted with the bold,
That is the code of the warrior!
