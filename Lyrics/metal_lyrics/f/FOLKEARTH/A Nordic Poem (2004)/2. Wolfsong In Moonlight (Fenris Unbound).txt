Child of atrocity - Progeny of Hel
Son of maiden fell;
Bound in dwarven chain
Helpless roar in rage!

Time for stars to fall
Ragnark's inaugural call!
Odin holds the prophecy scroll.
Release the beast!

Fimbul winter comes
Fires dying fast!
Wolf-song rides the gale
Frost whips with hail.

Release the beast!
Gluten maws in bloody feast
