"And Io, do I see my father
And Io, do I see my mother
And my sisters and my brothers
And the line of my people,

Back to the beginning...
And Io, they do call me,
In the halls of Valhalla
Where the brave may live forever!"

From death's embrace I awaken
Clutching the sword my life had taken;
Roofs thatched with gold
Songs of warriors old
In Odin's court

My eyes behold splendor untold!
What be this place?
What maiden brought my sould herein?
These are the halls
Of glorious Valhalla!

Step forth ye hammerheart,
Blessed champion of the Gods!
Heimdall will guard it
Vidar will welcome

In Odin's court our Einherjer brethren!
Come o beloved of the Raven,
Feast on flesh and mead;
Forever and all time

'Till Ragnarok arrives!
These are the halls
Of mighty Valhalla!

Heimdall will guard it
Vidar will welcome
In Odin's court
In Odin's court

I return to the ancient tree;
What was, shall forever be
Every nche resounds eternally
Warlike triumphant song
There in Odin's court!
