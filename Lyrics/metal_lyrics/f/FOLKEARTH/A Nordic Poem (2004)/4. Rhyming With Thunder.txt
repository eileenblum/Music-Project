Great God of the storm, Ruler of the skies above,
Mighty ever-warrior Thor
Thy name we call

Descend to Midgard
Great God of the gloom,
We summon you!

Rhyming with thunder, chanter the holy Galder!
Modi, Thruder, Magni - Thor!
Master of the tempest, lord of wintry call,
Modi, Thruder, Magni - He is Thor, one and all!

Swing thy holy hammer
Warriors revel in the sight
With swords upraised
To hail the pouring rain

I greet thee chariot rider,
Frost giants bane!
Never fall, always uphold this battle hymn of old!

Mortal kinsmen die,
As crops wither and subside
Wealth is passing by.
Yet eternal remains a glorious deed's name!

A legacy of honor, legend for tomorrow!
For what glory warriors await
Once their heyday goes under
Save a skald's praise, rhyming with thunder?

Swing thy holy hammer
Warriors revel in the sight
With swords upraised
To hail the pouring rain

I greet thee chariot rider,
Frost giants bane!
Never fall, always uphold this battle hymn of old!

Rhyming with thunder, chanter the holy Galder!
Modi, Thruder, Magni - Thor!
Master of the tempest, lord of wintry call,
Modi, Thruder, Magni - He is Thor, one and all!
