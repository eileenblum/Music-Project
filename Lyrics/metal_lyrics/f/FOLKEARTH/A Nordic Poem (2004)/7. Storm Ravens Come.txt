Hammers of thunder temper a storm
Wailing the wonds descend from the North
Dragons awaken in their sanctums of frost
Three hundred berserkers strong

Sail a' Viking ere the break of dawn!
Plunder in the East
Raze village - burn monasteries
Wicked thralls of this pale Christ

"In our heart we know no fear
In our eyes swells no tear.
Should death we meet today
Let it be so...

Crowned in glory we shall fall!"
Storm Ravens sweep me away
Howl blood to the wintry sway
In Valhalla for me Odin shall await!

Call beyond the nigthly sky
The brave who lost their lives
Howl blood to the wintry sway
In Valhalla for me Odin shall await!

Feel the rage of the Aesir and die!
Storm Ravens come
With swords blessed by the Gods
Raging and furious

In battle they stand victorious
Twin ravens soaring high
Feel the rage of Aesir and die!
Storm Ravens come
