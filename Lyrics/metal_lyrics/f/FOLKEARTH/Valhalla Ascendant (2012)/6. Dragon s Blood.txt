A furious blizzard rages
Forcing the pines to sway
Under its wintry whims
On the barren mountainside

A dark caver yawns wide,
Ancient pillars frame the gate
The statues of elder kings
Stand guarding riches withinâ¦

See the warrior coming out
From the depth of the Earth,,
Sword in hand, his armor torn
But with victory in his eyes!

His blade is stained with blood
And it drips on the virgin snow:
Crimson crystals on white â
Dragonâs blood feeds the ground!

His lips are red, his gaze shines â
He drank the dragonâs blood
And ate the beastâs very heart:
Thus now immortal he stands!

Dragonâs blood dripping down,
Golden flowers spring from snow:
Of all the treasure a chalice is enough
Filled to the brim with Dragonâs blood!
