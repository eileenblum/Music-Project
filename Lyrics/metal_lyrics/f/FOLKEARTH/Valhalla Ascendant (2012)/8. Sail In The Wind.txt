With sails in the wind
Our hearts overflow with a wish:
To cross the oceans wide
And in the horizon fade!

With sails in the wind
A new journey begins -
To lands far away
With stars to shine on our way!

With sails in the wind
Drakkars tear through the mist:
No curse to hold us back
No Kraken bars our path!

With sails in the wind
Weâll brave the coils of the beast,
This Leviathan of the deep â
And onwards weâll head

With sails in the wind
Our hearts overflow with a wish:
To cross the oceans wide
And in the horizon fade!

With sails in the wind
New skies await â
Strange stars and exotic winds:
Our journey begins!
