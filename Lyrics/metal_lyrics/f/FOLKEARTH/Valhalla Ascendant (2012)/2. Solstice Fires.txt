The moon waxes full
A spell of eclipse
Summoned by the orb
That welcomes winter rites!

A circle of stones
Stands silent on the hill - Brooding
Forlorn
Upon the ancient brow

The shadows of midnight
Grow longer - unreal
At the hour when the gods
Doth descend on the earth!

Odin shall see
Our fires at solstice!
Thor will be warned
By our fires at solstice!
Flames rise high 
Burning gold and a' glow
To please the gods
And welcome solstice!

The wolves in the woods
Howl a symphony
And race under the pale
Ghoul-ridden sky

I'm standing between
the granite monoliths
No fear in my heart
As a son of the night!

Odin shall see
Our fires at solstice!
Thor will be warned
By our fires at solstice!
Flames rise high 
Burning gold and a' glow
To please the gods
And welcome solstice!
