Far beyond the land of ice,
Where dragons haunt the skies,
Over the rainbow bridge
Lies the realm of Thule

Where the ice crown thaws
And the song of birds
Resounds from the polar pit â
There my heart shall forever be!

On the wings of the dragon
By the magic of old,
Where legends become real:
There, in the caverns of Thule!

The hidden sun shines upon
The hills beneath the hills â
Oceans church unseen
At the end of the arctic sea!

Spells imprison the light
In crystalline towers high â
Citadels of primordial stone
Guarded by the Hyperborean battle gods!

On the wings of the dragon
By the magic of old,
Where legends become real:
There, in the caverns of Thule!

And when the seal of ice doth break
And the mighty icebergs melt into the sea
Then the gates of Thule shall yawn wide
And the pale legions of death march forth
To conquer with steel and a fire that freeze
The corrupt and fallen world of mortal menâ¦
