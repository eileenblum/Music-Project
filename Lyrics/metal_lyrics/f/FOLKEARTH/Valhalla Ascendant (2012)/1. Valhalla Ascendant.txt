Above the realm of death
beyond the crimson clouds
out of the winter's reach
Valhalla lies - the golden hall

It's there I shall ride
with my battlebrothers
by my side - in honour 
forever there to reside

Above the plains of pain
beyond the dark of night
At the end of the rainbow
Valhalla lies - the golden hall

It's there I shall ride
with my battlebrothers
by my side - the glories
Of Odin shall be mine!

Above the realm of men
Beyond the rays of the sun
At life's bloody breaking
Valhalla lies - the golden hall

t's there I shall ride
with those who died
By my side - like kings
For eternity we shall dine
