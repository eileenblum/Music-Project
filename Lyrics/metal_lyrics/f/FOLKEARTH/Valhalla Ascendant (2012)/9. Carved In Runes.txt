Carved in runes,
Sung by swords â
Praised by Skalds,
The glorious names
Of the honored dead!

We will never forget
Our comrades in arms:
Weâll carve it in runes,
Their fame and their deeds
The legend they wrought!

Carved in runes,
Sung by swords â
The tales of glory
And warriors old,
That never fade!

I would gladly give up
My life for a moment
Of life as they lived it,
To walk in honor, not shame:
To stand proud, never to crawl

Carved in runes,
Sung by swords â
The sagas yore,
The heroic odes:
Are never forgotten
In Valhallaâs hall!
