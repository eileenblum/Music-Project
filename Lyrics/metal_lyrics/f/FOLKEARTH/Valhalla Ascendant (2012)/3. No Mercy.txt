In the distance
Dragon prows push through the oceans
Carrying the troops of frozen vastness domain

The rulers of the sea
Follow the lead of their elders
No fear in their eyes
Only Hardness on their faces

When we enter the forest
We brandish our swords
We gather one's courage
and resolve to defend our homes

In the distance
Resounds a distress signal
Invaders have shored
and are getting ready to defile our land

Villagers are must enter into fight
the tension is high

The rulers of the sea
Follow the lead of their elders
No mercy in their eyes
Only coolness on their faces

When we enter the forest
We brandish our swords
We gather one's courage
and resolve to defend our homes

In the distance
A thousand spears are moving forward
Trembling ground is freezing our confidence

In the distance
No one can hear our cries
Falling one by one and wiped out
By Odin's descendants

No fear in their eyes
Only hardness on their faces
No fear in their eyes
Only coolness on their faces

When we enter the forest
We brandish our swords
We gather one's courage
and resolve to defend our homes
