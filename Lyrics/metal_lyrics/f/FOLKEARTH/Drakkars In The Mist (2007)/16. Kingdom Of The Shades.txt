[Bonus track]

I see the wolves gathered on the hill
And the carrion birds that fly
Etched against the (witching) moonâ¦
I was a string in Apolloâs lyre
I was the sword in a warriorâs hand
I was the crown on an emperorâs brow
I was the seal on a sorcererâs heartâ¦
I saw the glory of Atlantis fallâthe jeweled spires that would gleam no moreâ¦
I saw the grandeur that once was Greeceâits crumbling walls I now call my homeâ¦
I see a woman crying on my moundâshe has been lover and homeland to me:
Alas! I know I will not see her againâthe kingdom of the shades is my homeâ¦
Where the Sidhe play mournful tunes
Where the sea is black, without a shore
Where meadows are strewn with ash
