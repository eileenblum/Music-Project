The secrets of the wind
Are whispered to the leaves
The song of hidden creeks
In the bronzing Autumn light
-elven dance in the twilight...the riddles of the sea
Raise a murmur to the shore
O mermaid,answer me!
Where's now the hero
Did he stand or did he fall?
I yearn for the tide
When long ships arrive
Underneath the amber sky
Wherein Odin's ravens fly!

Rolling thunder in the distance
A heavy rain begins to pour
I welcome the chariot of Thor
The wrath of heavens above
-full of pride I raise my sword!
The dying sound of battle horns
The screams subside on the field
The creek I knew so long ago
Now red it foams and rolls
Carrying my blood to Valhalla's hall!
I yearn for the tide
When long ships arrive
Underneath the amber sky
Wherein Odin's ravens fly!
