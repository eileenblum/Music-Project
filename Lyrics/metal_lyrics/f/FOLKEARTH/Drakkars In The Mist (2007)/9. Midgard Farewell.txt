So I take my leave
Brothers farewell
My forefathers voice
I hear their call
I now take my place
In the great hall
Together weâll feast
When your time has come
On Midgardâs plains
Our days are long gone
In the heraldâs song
Our deeds live on
By the fire at night
Our tale can be heard
And with the wind
Our names will fly
