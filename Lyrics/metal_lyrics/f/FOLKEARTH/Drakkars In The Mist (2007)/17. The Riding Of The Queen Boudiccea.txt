[Bonus track]

Under grey clouds rides the victorious one
Leading the Norfolk and the Britain tribes
(To) An uprising against the Roman Empire
Spurring her leadership
And her attacks!
A song for a Dark Queen whose face was stained
With dark paintings and her enemies blood
No mercy, no prisoners, sacrifice âem all
âI talk in the name of the Gods of warâ
Blessed by the wrath the Dark Queen led
Their armies towards the battlefields
And then a new age so glorious will rise
And then we will feast the Fall of the Empire
A song for a Dark Queen whose battle was lost
Their was painted were faded with their blood
Her spirit died and was buried by time
And the hopes withered away forevermore
The fateâs stone rolls downwards and then breaks
The name Iceni is lost in the winds
For the memories are written for those who won the wars
And a restless spirit rides her chariot throughout the woods
