Break thy silence o gray, turbulent sea!
Impart thy secrets, whisper tem to me
My eyes are focused out of this world
Where three hundred voices sing of glories old
Drakkars in the mist
Vikings are sailing to plunder in the East!
Drakkars in the mist
With sails full of wind, come, let us take to the sea!
I journeyed back in time
When offerings were rich on the shrines
Of Freyja and Odin alike
And runes were still young on the monoliths
âBlood we spill in the name of Thor, and the roar of thunder is our delight
We are the sons of battle, warriors of heathendom
Our hearts are made of steel and our swords of iron!â
Drakkars in the mist
Vikings are sailing to plunder in the East!
Drakkars in the mist
With sails full of wind, come, let us take to the sea!
But long years have gone by and all that remains is a darkened sky
I begged the waves to breathe a mist
So the drakkars may return anon one day!
