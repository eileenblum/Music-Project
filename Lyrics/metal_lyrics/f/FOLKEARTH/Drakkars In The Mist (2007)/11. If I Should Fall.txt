The long ships are awaiting me
Iâm setting sail to fulfill my destiny: for the rising sun hath promised me
That the blood of foes shall anoint my sword!
I heed the call of Fatherland
Sung to the tone of battle horns!
By Odinâs spear I swear this day
Iâll make them fear the sound of my name!
âMy Fatherâs Gods will welcome me
To Valhallaâs halls if I should fallâ¦
And there Iâll feast as Einherjer
Until the dawn of dread is comeâ¦â
âAway, away! To Asgard fly
With Valkyries in the vanguard
Across the sky and over clouds
The furious host doth hunt tonightâ¦â
