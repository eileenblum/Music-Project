The skies burst and lo!
I Perseus, hasten forth
On wings divine from above
In answer to her pleading cries!
The skies sing and lo!
I Perseus, hasten forth
On wings divine from above
To vanquish horror from her eyes!
Sword and shield
(Clash with kraken teeth)
The waves are whips
Their spray a deadly stingâ¦ like Hermes on the wing
Swift and deadly is my blade
To claim a heroâs victory
And my Andromeda set free!
Such pale beauty in despair
Eyes wild, framed in raven hair
Envied by the goddess of love
Andromeda lies chained to the crag
