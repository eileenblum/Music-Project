Rend the sky
Lash the clouds
Thor, bring down
Fire arcane: they thunders of war!
Fight to die
Stand your ground Son of Odin
Unleash thy thundersâthy thunders of war!
String and proud
A horn doth sound!
Valkyries sing
Of glories steeped inâ¦thy thunders of war!
Iron runes
Etched in blood
Aâ glimmer âmongst
The endless starsâand the thunders of war!
Thunders of war
From the sky to the shore!
On thunder of war
Rides the chariot of Thor!
