The whole world wide, every day
Fly Hugin and Munin
I worry lest Hugin should fall in fight
Yet more I fear for Munin
[Taken from Grimnismol:] Four wings spreaded in the northern sky
Sent out everyday to gather knowledge
Far beyond the glance of dawn
Return with the shadows to the land of the norsemen
And over the Odenâs shoulder
Tell what their eyes saw
And over the Odinâs shoulder their ears
Become Odinâs ears
All-father I flown to the west and I saw
The dragons sail, beats of the waves
All-father I flown to the west and I saw
Woods and fjords beyond the nine worlds
Father of the god of the thunder
Whose Mjollnir guards our folk
We will ride the skies of the whole world wide
