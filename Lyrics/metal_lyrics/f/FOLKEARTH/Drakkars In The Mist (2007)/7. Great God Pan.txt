Once upon a time when mythic creatures thrived
My land was pure, the forests primeval still
And pagan reels would stir the crooked boughs
Surrendering them to the whims of the whispering windâ¦
There flowers sprung beneath the cloven hoofs
Of an elder being-far more ancient than the Olympians themselvesâ¦
The ancient trees know him by the nameâPan, what lust runs through thy veins!
The Dryads alone yet sing his fameâPan, thy music the Gods entertains!
Ten score Satyr squires
With nymphs sought delightâ¦thy flute is divine
O Pan, our music inspire!
Teach us thine art
The tunes that would win
The hearts of a nymph!
The ancient trees know him by the nameâPan, what lust runs through thy veins!
The Dryads alone yet sing his fameâPan, thy music the Gods entertains!
Pan, great god
Spread panic in our enemyâs ranks!
We invoke thy name
In moonlit glades-grant us the gift
Of arcane prophecyâ¦
The ancient trees know him by the nameâPan, what lust runs through thy veins!
The Dryads alone yet sing his fameâPan, thy music the Gods entertains!

[Orphic hymn to Pan excerpt:]
âI invoke the brawny Pan, the sky and the seaâI invoke earth, the sovereign queen and immortal fireâ¦
O friend of Echo, thou who dances with the nymphs, thou who knowest everything, bearer of light, the true horned Zeusâ¦â

I can hear the rivers lamenting and the willows weepâ¦
Pan, our forests doth miss youâ¦
For now a loathsome Christ has dubbed you Satan
And cast thee in exileâ¦
But your shrines are not forgottenâthere are those who still utter thy name
To restore thy glory and behold thee, Horned god, enthroned once more!

[Orphic hymn to Pan excerpt continued:]
âThou who changes the nature of every thing with thy predictions and guides the race of men upon this vast earthâ¦
But come o blessed one, thou courtier of Bacchus, come o inciting one, come to our holiest of sacrifices and grant us a good lifeâs ending by dispersing the frenzy of panic unto the four corners of the earthâ¦â
