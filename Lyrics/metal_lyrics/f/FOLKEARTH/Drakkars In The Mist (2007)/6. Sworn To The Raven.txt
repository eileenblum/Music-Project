The Viking blood in me
Runs through my veins afire
Hearken to the voice within
That promises of immortality!
Sworn to the raven
The hammer and the sword!
Father Odin hear my call
Oâer brooding mountains tall!
There can be no defeat
When I charge the battlefield!
There can be no death
For those who dwell in the Golden Hall!
Sworn to the raven
The hammer and the sword!
Father Odin hear my call
Oâer brooding mountains tall!
Impaled on Saxon spears
Ran through with a sword: born without having fear my shoulder shield-slain god
