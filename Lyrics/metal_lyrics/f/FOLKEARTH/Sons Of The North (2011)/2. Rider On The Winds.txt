Rider on the winds,
Master of the skies:
Thor! Menace from above,
Thy hammer raise aloft!

Beneath the punding wheels
Of your chariot,
We'll stand in steadfast lines!
Beneath the thunder bolts
Shooting from thy eyes
We'll charge the field of war

And raise the battle cry!

Rider on the winds,
Master of the skies:
Thor! Menace from above,
Thy hammer raise aloft!

Swords on shields collide
Spears in flesh are lodged:
The din of havoc deafens me
As my heart starts beat berserk!

We fall upon the foe -
Like a tide of steel and woe!
Thirsty for the fruit
Of carnage blood and gore!

Rider on the winds,
Master of the skies:
Thor! Menace from above,
Thy hammer raise aloft!

Thor, warlord of the world
Bless our blades this dawn -
For you are like we are:
A warrior next to none!
