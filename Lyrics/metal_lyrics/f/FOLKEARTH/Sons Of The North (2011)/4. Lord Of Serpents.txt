I am the lord of serpents and Trolls,
I am the bringer of death and of woe!
I am the scourge of the immortal Gods,
My name is a curse - I am Loki!

Entombed and silent,
In the bowels of the Earth -
My minions slowly gnaw
At the root of Yggdrasill

In the darkest cavern,
Forgotten by time
And hated by all -
I await the time to come
For me to rise again,
And rule upon the Earth!

So it is written
And so it shall be done -
That on the day of days,
On the dawn of Ragnarok,
I shall muster my hordes
And bring the Aesir to their knees

I am the lord of serpents and Trolls,
I am the bringer of destruction and death!
I am the enemy of man, the foe of the Gods,
My name is a curse - I am Loki!

I am the lord of serpents and Trolls,
I am the general of Naglfar's host!
I am the punished bastard son,
My name is a curse - I am Loki!
