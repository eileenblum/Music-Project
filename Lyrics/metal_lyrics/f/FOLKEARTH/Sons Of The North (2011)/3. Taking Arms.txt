Lift up your swords
Drive off the enemy!
Take arms
Protect our homes!

This sacred land is forever ours,
Inheritance of the legendary Viking gods.
This stretch of frozen forest
and beyond Hov. as far as the eyes can see,
are the birthplace
of our holy civilization.

Preserve the Viking's legacy at all costs
Slay without guilt! Die without fear!
Our victory is already written in the runes

Lift up your swords
Drive off the enemy!
Take arms
Protect our homes!

The blood flowing faster through our veins
Is awakening our inner ruthlessness
Elated by surrounding death
we uncover the true Viking nature
confusing and fazing our opponents

Lightning, resounding victory is ours
Make no prisoners! No remission!
Slay without guilt! Die without fear!
Elated by surrounding death
we uncover the true Viking nature

Lift up your swords
Drive off the enemy!
Take arms
Protect our homes!
