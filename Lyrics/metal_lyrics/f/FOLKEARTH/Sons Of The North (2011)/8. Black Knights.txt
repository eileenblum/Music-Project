When the day doth break
It shall not remember the night
Save for an ebon speck in the sky:
Our banner in the wind caught high!

Cravens wished they could forget,
Traitors tried to bury our fame -
But our true glory doth shine
Across the oceans of time...

Panthers of steel growl
As they approach the field -
Black Knights all around
Fight and know no retreat!
Proud and strong, warriors all,
The drum of thunder rolls - 
High above the enflamed sky,
To victory or Valhalla it calls!

When we march to the front
It's not our weapons you should fear,
But the Devil himself who rides on our side!
We will laugh at each step, as we trample the foe!
Wherever we pass, castles shall fall and cities shall burn
And we laugh at each step, as we trample the foe!

When we return, you will know our songs
You will fear the point of our spears -
When the legionnaires enter the Fatherland
Hailed as victors, heroes returning at long last!

Panthers of steel growl
As they approach the field -
Black Knights all around
Fight and know no retreat!
Proud and strong, warriors all,
The drum of thunder rolls - 
High above the enflamed sky,
To victory or Valhalla it calls!
