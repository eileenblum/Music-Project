Sacrifice to the winds
Sacrifice to Lord Njord -
Pray our sails be full of wind,
Pray the stars fix our course...

When the sun doth rise
Men, bid ye farewell
To your children and wife -
And come, let's catch the tide!

To Vinland we sail,
The ocean calls our name!
To Vinland we sail,
To conquest, as is our fate!

Like monsters at sea,
The waves are a' rising
Threatening to devour
Our dragon-headed prow...

We lost many a brave
To the depths of the abyss,
We'll miss many a sword
When the battles begin...

To Vinland we sail,
The ocean calls our name!
To Vinland we sail,
To conquest, as is our fate!

After long months of brine
And whipped by the winds,
Through the fortress of mist
We beheld land in the East...

A glad song was on our lips,
Our eyes were alight
With the joy of the few
That have seen certain death,
Laughed in its face
And lived to tell the tale...

To Vinland we sail,
The ocean calls our name!
To Vinland we sail,
To conquest, as is our fate!
