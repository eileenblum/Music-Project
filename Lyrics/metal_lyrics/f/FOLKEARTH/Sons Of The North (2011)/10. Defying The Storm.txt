Defying the storm, the lash of the waves,
Our Drakkars are advancing
Fearless upon the raging seas we sail!
Our Dragon prow is emerging
From the mist of a winter's morning
Or the dying gleam of day:
Upon the fury of the ocean we ride
With the wind caressing our hair
And the brine biting into our eyes,
The frost that invades
The warmth of a heart...

Defying the storm, the lash of the waves,
Our Drakkars are advancing
Fearless upon the raging seas we sail!
The standard of the hammer
Atop the mast we hoisted high
A talisman of Mjolner
Around our neck we hung:
To invoke all Fates benign
And offer sacrifice -
To Njord, the sea-faring God,
A mariner across the stars
That through the night
Us mortals guide...
