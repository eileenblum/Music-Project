Forth! Northmen, forth!
Odin wills it -
Into the red embrace of war,
To fight and die for the Gods!
We are the crusaders
In a pagan holy war;
We are the sons
That battle bore
In her blood clotted womb:
We fear no man,
Giant or beast...
Forth! Northmen, forth!
Odin wills it -
Into the red embrace of war,
To fight and die for the Gods!
We are the crusaders
In a pagan holy war;
We are the heirs
Of the slain on the field -
Their destiny ours shall be
And glory everlasting
We will share in the hall
That lies overhead,
Where heroes sit and drink
Awaiting for us all...
