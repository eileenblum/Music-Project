At last the flaming arrows
Fall like heavy rain upon me

And I am sailing towards
The vastness of the endless sky...

In Valhalla I will dine tonight
Like all heroes in the sky!
In my dreams, a Valkyrie
To take me to the sky!
There is no death tonight
I'm a hero in the sky!
Don't let my mother cry
I'm a hero in the sky

When the enemy spears
Formed lines full of thorns
I fell without a tear
I lived and died by the sword

In Valhalla I will dine tonight
Like all heroes in the sky!
In my dreams, a Valkyrie
To take me to the sky!
There is no death tonight
I'm a hero in the sky!
Don't let my mother cry
I'm a hero in the sky

Red on white across the vale
Blood on the snow is spilled
My battlecry did win the day
By my hand a king was killed!

In Valhalla I will dine tonight
Like all heroes in the sky!
In my dreams, a Valkyrie
To take me to the sky!
There is no death tonight
I'm a hero in the sky!
Don't let my mother cry
I'm a hero in the sky
