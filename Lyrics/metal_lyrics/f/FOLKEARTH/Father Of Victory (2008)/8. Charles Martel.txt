Charles Martel, the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to charge!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all...

And when the sound of battle horns
Shall keenly fill the air anon
We'll rise with pride our banner high
And answer to our king's call!

Charles Martel, the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to chrage!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all...

Even when the horns of war
Shall echo in the fields no more
When in tatters hangs our flag
And empty be the throne of Franks
We'll still keep watch by night to see
Charles Marterl return again!
Rest now my king but light be thy sleep
Thy foes still covet thy crown...

Charles Martel, the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to chrage!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all...
