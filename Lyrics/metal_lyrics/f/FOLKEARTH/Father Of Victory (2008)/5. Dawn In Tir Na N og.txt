Clouds lined with silver
Soon to be parted
By the spear of lough

The dawn draws nigh... Tuatha de Danann
Awake! Seize the day!
A new sun doth rise
O'er Tir Na N'Og... sing me the song
My heart's yearning for

Play now the tune
That would bring me back

Back to your ring
There to dance with thee
And see the day break
In the otherworld!
Follow the sidhe through the lake
Icy waters flanked by hills so green
Unravel a path of mystical sheen
To undying lands let me now awake

Guardian at the gates
Of Tir Na N'Og
I fear now your sword!
Stand back, let me pass to the lands of my folk!
