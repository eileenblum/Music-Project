My eyes are glazed and fixed on skies
Wherein thy ravens fly
One-eyed father on your throne up high
Know thy son has died
Who will recall my name?
None will be left to say
The tale of the one who now steals away
As autumn leafs are born on winds astray

To Waelhalle the Valkyries call!
To Waelhalle my legend doth go!
I am immortal, the right hand of Tyr
I'll see you my brothers upon thy return to Waelhalle!

But here on this night I refuse to lay down my sword, I fight!
I fight for a legacy, I sing for what cannot yet die
A hymn to the Gods of starlight
And headed for eternity
I take to the wing

To Waelhalle the Valkyries call!
To Waelhalle my legend doth go!
I am immortal, the right hand of Tyr
I'll see you my brothers upon thy return to Waelhalle!
