One darksome raven riding the Northern wind
One black crown to wake the Aesir
And underneath the waning winter moon
The wind swept cedar forest stirs

Where darksome ravens dwell
There in the ancient glade

Where royal eagles soar
There in the storming skies
Will I set my shrine
And hail the Gods on high!
Where fearsome ravens dwell
Underneath their ebony wings
Where wise owls sing
Underneath their stare
Will I hallow my weapons
At night before the fight!

Where darksome ravens dwell
There in the ancient glade

Where winged Fairy sweep
There by the enchanted creek
Will I in solitude pace
Before battle I embrace!
In raven haunted forests I reign
Where all is quiet, all is tranquil
I am the crowned, lonely king
