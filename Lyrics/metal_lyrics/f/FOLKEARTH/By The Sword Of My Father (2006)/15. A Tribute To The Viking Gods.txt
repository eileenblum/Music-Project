Listen, son
I'll tell you now how Vikings die
With a bloody axe
An arm so strong and sword held high
That's how a Viking dies
We die in battle cry
Trust in the Gods
Trust in the Runes and in your steel
Life and death
Live a never ending wheel
At Odin's table, we meet again
Heroes meet again
I sailed across the seven seas for fifty years
I conquered all the continents with fire and steel

A tribute to the Viking Gods
A tribute to the Viking Gods
A tribute to the Viking Gods

Now I'm old and in my next fight
I'm going to die
I meet you again in Odin's hall
No need to cry

A tribute to the Viking Gods
A tribute to the Viking Gods
A tribute to the Viking Gods
