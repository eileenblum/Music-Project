Where now is the hero
Where is thy singing sword
That spelled the bane of dragons
And sent the Ogress to Hell?

Beowulf, these lands will miss you!
Never again to Denmark shall you return
Beowulf, the Valkyries doth kiss you!

The fire has left his eyes
Then rain afterwards came
To gently wash the blood away
His noble features so pale to lay

Beowulf, these lands will miss you!
Never again to Denmark shall you return
Beowulf, the Valkyries doth kiss you!

In the end he overcame
Victory for the brave
Glory, majesty - eternal hail!
