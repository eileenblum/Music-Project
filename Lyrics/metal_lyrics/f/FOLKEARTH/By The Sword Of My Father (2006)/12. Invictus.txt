Come O' twilight
Gently caress the gleaming snow
As weary I rest beneath the oak
Mystic paths unravel before my sight
Leading to dreams and hope
Once my time on earth is done
I will pass on with the heroes
Behold Valhalla's golden-green meadows
Feast with All-father and my Gods
At night in the banquet of lords!

Now I die free
And my heart cries victory!
I ride the everlasting dream
Lightly taking to the wing
Invictus, the champion see!

Death benighted my eyes
Silently bequeath thy frosty tides
Wound scared and worn
This body will lay here forlorn
Upon my mountain-throne
Forever I shall dwell
King carved in stone
Return is lost forevermore
Mourn now for me my love!
Sing an epitaph of glorious deeds
Sing to the setting of the sun
Of valor, the fearless might
Cast your sweet spell of magic!
Farewell, I kiss thee on the wind
Come O' twilight
Let us unite
And on into the night!

Now I die free
And my heart cries victory!
I ride the everlasting dream
Lightly taking to the wing
Invictus, the champion see!

Fly my banner to the sky
Raise a final sword salute
Drink the ceremonial wine
Then my pyre set alight!
With the youthful dawn cry no more
For mighty was the one now gone!
Beaten yet never defeated
Towards oceans unknown I sail
I am the captain of my soul
The master of my fate!
