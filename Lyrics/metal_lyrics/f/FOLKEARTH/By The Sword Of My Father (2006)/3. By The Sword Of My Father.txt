By my father's deathbed I sit
With a grim countenance to fit
He's headed now for the Land Beyond
A vengeance and his sword he he left unto me
Father, tell me what you dream
Up there in the sky
Are there mountains like the ones you loved?
Are the valleys of the heavens evergreen?
Do crystalline rivers flow in their midst?

By the sword of my father...
This day avow!
By the sword of my father...
Revenge shall bejewel my crown!

My son take heed
Remember my creed
Hyperborean steel
From the the stone cromlech drawn
Etched with glyphs of power
Draconian, strong!
Let them behold thy scepter of war
A royal flag from enemies torn!

By the sword of my father...
This day I avow!
By the sword of my father...
Revenge shall bejewel my crown!

Leave behind this deathbed of mine
Carve on their hides a warning for all!
