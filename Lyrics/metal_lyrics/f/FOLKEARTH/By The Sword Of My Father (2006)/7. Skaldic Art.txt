By the fire's gleam
The skald lies asleep
But still his tales dance within the flames
He told me of time long gone
Of warriors proud in legendary shroud
By the fire's gleam
The skald lies asleep
But still his tales dance within the flames
Tales Of Gods and fairy folk
Forgotten now from all

Tell me skald
Praise with thy fiddle
All the things you saw
When in Viking times
Dragons ruled the North!

In the Viking times
Thor's silver chariot
Rode on clouds sky-borne!
By the fire's gleam
The skald lies asleep
But still his tales dance within the flames

In the Viking times
A tale now unfolds
So keep it in your heart
Least it may go!
In the Viking times
Upon the rainbow's end
Heimdall I met
The guardian of Bifrost!

In the Viking times
A tale now unfolds
So keep it in your heart
Least it may go!
In the Viking times
And far, far away
In the North of yesterday
Singing with the boreal gale!

Tales Of Gods and fairy folk
Forgotten now from all
