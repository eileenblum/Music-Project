Breaking waves announce the end
A tempest born of Charybdis' maws
Giants of frost, serpents and trolls
Allied to bring death to us all!

Naglfar sets sail
From the infernal quay!
Flames take Valhalla's hall
As Ragnarok foretold

The Aesir take up their swords
The Vanir sound their glorious horns
To face the underworld's horde
Naglfar laughs at the aligned enemy host
Maggots and worms
Pestilence and war
The plagues of hell upon ye all!

Naglfar sets sail
From the infernal quay!
Flames take Valhalla's hall
As Ragnarok foretold

Cast out in fire
Axes honed by ire
Black is the flag he raised
To the wind of the dead
Naglfar opens his sails

Naglfar sets sail
From the infernal quay!
Flames take Valhalla's hall
As Ragnarok foretold
