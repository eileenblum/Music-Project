As if in a dream she approached me
Her beauty beyond all compare
Three melodies were her gift to me
My harp strung by her golden hair
The joys of life and wonders to come
The piercing pain of lost love

The lady gave her gift to me
Those otherworldly melodies
That brought my maiden back to me
The river-elf's lost love

Out of the mist he appeared
So fair but so cold
Drowning in turbulent dreams
Her grief knowing no bounds

The lady gave her gift to me
Those otherworldly melodies
That brought my maiden back to me
The river elf's lost love
