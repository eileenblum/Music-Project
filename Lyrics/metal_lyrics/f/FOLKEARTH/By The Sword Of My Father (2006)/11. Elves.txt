Have you ever seen the beauty of an elven rose in spring
Picked by a mortal lover
As the first to his fairy paramour?
I could never love another as I loved thee once before
In this secret garden
Freyja's arms bound me to thy breast
Look into thy glass and tell me
What will cruel tomorrow bring
Mine was the beauty of yesteryear's
That made pearls out of my tears...
