I was born on the drow of thunder
And an icy takes I slaked my thirst
For blood from corpses torn asunder
Odin has placed a sword in my fist

I am fire!
And in battle I burn higher!
I am fire!
To kill is my desire!
My soul is aflame with Odin's fire!

Know my name, Berserker!
As I sate the sword
Scream my name berserker!

Cry havoc, the wolf is in the fold!
See them run like fucking sheep
From jaws of steel that seek to rend
My delight is in this bloody deed

I am fire!
And in battle I burn higher!
I am fire!
To kill is my desire!
My soul is aflame with Odin's fire!
