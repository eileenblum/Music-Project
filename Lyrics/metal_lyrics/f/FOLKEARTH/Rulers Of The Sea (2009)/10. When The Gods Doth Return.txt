Look up to the stars
The deep velvet black
Of a primordial night
Etched with dying lights...

If your eyes be keen
And they can perceive
ÐÑ shall see them coming
The lords of celestial empires

When the gods doth return
The dragon will be put to death
When the gods doth return
The land of light shall welcome them
When the gods doth return
Songs forgotten and arcane will be heard

See the comet's trail
That bizarre cyan blaze
A fleet is on the way
To save us from the apostates

Take up your sword
And none it the moonlight
Brother chose your side
In the fight of all time

When the gods doth return
The dragon will be put to death
When the gods doth return
The land of light shall welcome them
When the gods doth return
Songs forgotten and arcane will be heard

When the gods doth return
The sound of joy will fill the air
The rightful rulers of this earth
Shall be enthroned once again

When the gods doth return
Fear of the dark will be no more
When the gods doth return
Thy shadows shall vanish forevermore
