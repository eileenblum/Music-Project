Only ravening chaos was there at first
Wherein enthroned sat it's overlord
Kronos the terrible immortal god
Ruling with a malignant iron heart...

Then came the fire giving shape into Gaia
The immortals took their place on the peak
Of mighty Olympus and in Erebus deep
The sky unfolded wings and night came creeping in...

How wonderfully shines the living light
The first daybreak at the dawn of time
On anvils divine a mortal world is forged
Cosmogenesis, the mystic maelstorm

The valleys evergreen crossed by rivers crystalline
Became the palaces of Nymphs
The mystic wind that first blew through the woods
Taught the Satyrs to sing...

And in the depths of the sea, in chambers of ebony
Cyclopses and Titants dwell, held in thrall by Zeus
Hail the fathergod that would raise the progeny of Chaos
Into the light, away from tyranny and into the day!

How wonderfully shines the living light
The first daybreak at the dawn of time
On anvils divine a mortal world is forged
Cosmogenesis, the mystic maelstorm
