By the rune stone he stands
A lone wanderer from afar
Wolves gathered round in packs
Poetry he chants
Weaving magick strands

Lord of the spear
Welcome to our land
Our hospitality for a god
Pray tell us where you've been
Storyteller wise one

(And the Raven god recounts many a saga)

Under a roof of gold
With the rainbow forever in sight
Dwell warriors bold
They taste the mead of the wind
Always loud they sing

When in the sky
Wild thunder strikes
Thy ravens come again!

One eyed god, father mighty of all
With swords upraised to the crystal dome
Of a sky wherein thy ravens fly
We're so proud so strong, forever free!

God of poets, god of magic
From your breath the four winds blow
From your eyes the eternal flame flows
From your lips the oath of fire is sealed

Wodem, I am your true son and heed honor's call!
I fight for thee and in thy name shed blood and bane!
Vidurr the destroyer â master of havoc, unrivaled warrior!
Hnikarr the inflamer â rde above the sea dragon slayer
Sigford, father of victory â thine gifts I seek on the battlefield tonight
Yggr â terror of Frankia and eastern men
Conquer all the world

In this star enarmored night
We raise our horns â salute the sky!

When in the sky
Wild thunder strikes
Thy ravens come again!
