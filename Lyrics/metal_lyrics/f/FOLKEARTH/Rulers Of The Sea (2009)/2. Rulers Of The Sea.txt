Far from these relentless shores
Beyond these mountains tall
Shine the stars diamond bright
And light our path cross the churning sea...

A haunted wind fills our sails
Driving us through the foam
Pull hard on the oars ten score leagues
To cross before we greet the dawn!

For Odin and for Thor
For Balder and for Tyr
We're sailing the sea!
By conquest and steel
By the right of our might
We're the rulers of the sea

We see the sun that rises
Bloody behind the horizon
It's reflection in our eyes
Eager for the storm of swords!

Our voices take up the song
Of courage, fearless ar war
We're stronger that before
The berserkers are marching on!

For Odin and for Thor
For Balder and for Tyr
We're sailing the sea!
By conquest and steel
By the right of our might
We're the rulers of the sea
