Ye blood brothers of Sava
The clarion calls:
Lay down lutes and psalteries
And take up your swords!

Tzar Lazar the glorious
Heading the charge:
His breastplate and shield shine
With the holy crossâ¦

Voyvoda Stefan rides at his side,
The mighty king Vukashin,
Goiko and Uglyesha â 
Staring proudly into the sun,
Defying the fire, scorning the foe:
Freedom or death is their oath!

Ye sons of the Empire
The sun doth rise black:
Nowâs the time to dye hands red
But let your souls be white!

Tzar Lazar has fallen
Under Turkish sword:
Avenge him to the last man â
Freedom or death!

Voyvoda Stefan bleeds by his side,
The mighty king Vukashin.
Goiko and Uglyesha â 
Staring proudly into the sun,
Defying the fire, scorning the foe:
Freedom or death is their oath!

Must thou go my noble Tzar?
Would that I were cold with those
That laid their lives in the holy cause
At the feet of the Serbian eagleâ¦
Would that the blade that sealed thy fate
Be lodged ten times into my breast
Than to see our only hope failâ¦

Our dead call revenge:
Remember Kosovo!
Left alone to brave the night.
We stood for our Homeland,
God and the Tzar â
On the fields where we fell
Now the Amaranths bloomâ¦
