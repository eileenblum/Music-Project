Set sails to conquer!

Braving the storm with confidence!
We follow our path.
No matter how many of us will die!
Landing on an unknown land.
Axes and swords yearning for blood!

Giant monsters decimate most of our troops.
Thor is on our side and Mjollnir wracks will breaks out our opponents!

Braving the storm with confidence!
We follow our path.
No matter how many of us will die!
