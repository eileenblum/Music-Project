By the rune stone he stands
A lone wanderer from afar
Wolves gathered round in packs:
Poetry he chants
Weaving magic strands.

Lord of the spear
Welcome to our land
Our hospitality for a god;
Pray tell us where youâve been
Storyteller, wise one.

(And the Raven God recounts many a saga)

Under a roof of gold
With the rainbow forever in sight
Dwell warriors bold
They taste the mead of the wind
Always loud they sing:
When in the sky
Wild thunder strikes
Thy ravens come again!

âOne eyed god, Father mighty of all,
With swords upraised to the crystal dome
Of a sky wherein thy ravens fly
Weâre so proud, so strong, forever free!â

God of poets, God of magic
From your breath the four winds blow
From your eyes the eternal flame flows
From your lips the oath of fire is sealed!

âWoden, I am your true son and heed honorâs call! I fight for thee and in thy name shed blood and bane! Vidurr the destroyer â Master of havoc, unrivaled warrior! Hnikarr the inflamer â ride above the sea dragon slayer! Sigfodr, father of victory â Thine gifts I seek on the battlefield tonight! Yggr â Terror of Frankia and Eastern men, conquer all the world!â

In this star enarmored night
We raise our horns â salute the sky!

When in the sky
Wild thunder strikes
Thy ravenâs come again!
