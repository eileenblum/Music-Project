Many roads we have traveled,
Many skies we have seen:
Only to the stars we have yet to be,
There, where our hearts will forever beat!

Homecoming sweet will be:
Having braved the endless seas
To see the green of Uppsala's hills,

Homeward bound I be!
Brothers let us sail to the North,
Back to the land of our Fathers,
Where the Gods of thunder and war
Await our ship to reach the shore!
Homecoming sweet will be:
Having braved the endless seas
To see the green of Uppsala's hills,
Homeward bound I be!
