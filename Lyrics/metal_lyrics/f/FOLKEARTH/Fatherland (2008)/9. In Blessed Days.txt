Gather round and listen close
I'll now sing you a song
Of blessed days gone by
As sung once upon a time...

Close your eyes and fly away
To blessed days
'Ere the Elves fled this world,
'Ere dwarfs turned to stone...

The world was fair,
The mountains tall, the sky clear â
The rivers run crystalline
'Ere the dryads turned to willows...

Close your eyes and fly away
To blessed days
'Ere the Elves fled this world,
'Ere dwarfs turned to stone...

Sing with me and dream
Of the beauty that once was â
Of the deep woods wherein
The Faery folk did dwell...

Can you remember at all
The blessed days
When knights roamed the land
And dragons slain lay in their caves?

Can you recall
The name of the one
The hero that put the giants to the sword
And was hailed by all in a continent afar?

Close your eyes and fly away
To blessed days
'Ere the Elves fled this world,
'Ere dwarfs turned to stone...
