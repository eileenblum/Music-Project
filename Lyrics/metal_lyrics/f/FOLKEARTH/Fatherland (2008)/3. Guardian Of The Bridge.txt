Guardian of the bridge
Between the realms
Of gods and mortal men,
Stand your ground and scan
With thy keen eye the far
Horizon wherein only thou can see â
Look for the end of days,
Look for the coming
Of dreaded Ragnarok...
Grasp the hilt of your mighty sword,
And sound the charge on Gjallarhorm!
Guardian of the bridge,
Call the Gods out of their halls â
Bid Odin leave the golden walls
And ride ahead, leading the Aesir forth
Into one final war â for the glory
Of the eternal and everlasting
Fame of a warrior who fought
And died on the side of light
Whereon rides the day-bringing God...
Guardian of the bridge,
Between the sky and the sea â
Heimdall, son of Odin,
Thee I call! Descend from above
And guard what is most sacred for me:
My virtue and my honor
In times of death, fire and war...
