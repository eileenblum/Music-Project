Hark! The great bells tolls
In a frantic tone of distress;
A menace has come forth â
Drakkars from the mist...

Bestial prows lashed by waves,
Can't you hear their silent howl?

Terror from the sea â
Flames consume the monastery...

They left their mark on Normandy,
Ruins and carnage, women that weep;
Demons berserk, on the foe they press,
The thirst of hate, the storm of swords,
God is never there when they come
In the black of night or early morn...

Terror from the sea â
Give up hope, turn and flee!

The flames shall dance high,
The vultures feast like kings;
What prayers in vain,
What tale of strife,
The messenger doth bring?
Where their swords may reign
Wolves and worms be fed!

Bestial prows lashed by waves,
Can't you hear their silent howl?

Terror from the sea â
In blood they take their fee!

Ashes rain softly down,
Like gray, scorched snow...

"This is the Devil's work!"
The Abbot will solemnly say;
"This is the doing of Beasts!"
The knight appalled declares;
"Had I warriors like those!"
The king doth exclaim...

Terror from the sea,
Drakkars emerging from the mist!
Terror from the sea,
The Vikings are sailing to the East!
