We must live within ourselves as we progress from the past. Leaving
behind the traces of mistakes and regrets and everything we once felt. Let me
stare into your eyes, for it shall be the last time I shall gaze upon them and
would not leave with regret. As to simply forget your beauty, a calling in life
I cannot disregard. So to you, I wish to return. Please do not forget me. Our
love is everlasting. One more look back as I place my foot upon the war path.
The scent of flames tames to the essence of your choice perfume. This last
goodbye spoken softly into your ear, words of passion, now I must let go. But
when I return on top of the world, I will have you take my hand to stand beside
me. Departure leaves me breathless as I take to my arms. The weight of a war
now reigns down into my soul. Many to perish at my side, for we are to forfeit
our lives Or just survive. So to you, I wish to return. Please do not forget
me. Our love is everlasting. I shall endure.  And this memory of what we have
shall carry me through the darkest of my days. By blood and steel I promise
thee. I shall endure. And this memory of what we have shall carry me through
the darkest of my days.
