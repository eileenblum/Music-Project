There was a time when you were on your own. No one to guide. No one to keep you
strong. So I carried your weight upon my back. Never would I let you fail. I
should have known it would become your chopping block. Your words would reside
behind my back. But my kindness will not be played for weakness. This could be
the last time that we ever talk. Two timer, serpent tongue. I stand so that you
may fall. Your words have deceived us all. You two timer with your serpent
tongue. All will know, all will be sung. My weakness is judgment for I am a
fool to think that you d be so worthy. I don't care for the words that will
surely fail you. For the lies you shall speak will never really guide you. I
don't care for the words that will surely fail you, never guide you. I hold
within myself the value that people are worth more than how they may come
across.
