Feverishly I awoke from a slumber so deep. Sweat glazed
over my pale skin. For within these days I find myself retreating to my dreams.
Here is where you've become my nightmare. Fearful of sleep now and the torment
it has shared. Pound upon my skull, erase these memories, the frame work for my
insanity. Dream no longer the voices call unto me. But now she stands burning
before my eyes. Must this repeat? Must this repeat before my burning eyes? My
love misplaced, now doused in pain. Death now claims you eternally in my mind
and this is my fault, my failure to save a love in my life. Your memory has
become my purgatory pouring into my endless dreams. I ll burn for you my dear,
for a lifetime or eternity to save you of that day. Fateful framed events now
leave us so shallow, struggling to live life just another day. But I m on my
way back to you wondering where our love will take us in the afterlife. Until
then I ll dream of you and of our last day and pray death frees me of a life
spent without you. Death free me of this life spent without her. Burn for me.
Fateful framed events now leave us so shallow, struggling to live life just
another day. Burn for me my dear.
