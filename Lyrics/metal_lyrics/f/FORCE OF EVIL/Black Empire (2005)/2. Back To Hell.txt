Back to Hell!!!

Resurrected from the dead
Vengeance keeps on driving him
You take a bullet in the head
Cut you up, limb by limb
He was betrayed by the force
Behind bars among the thieves
Smashing down the prison doors
Badge of evil never sleeps

He will hunt till Armageddon
Won't stop before the deed is done
Coming for you, coming for me
Time to set the sinners free

In the night, in the moonlight
From the shadows he will avenge
In the night, in the moonlight
He's waiting for revenge and he will drag you
Back to Hell

Another shift of mayhem
Killing in the streets
Revenge of the damned
On the blood of guilt he feed
With the right to remain dead
And arrest without a trial
Stone cold, killing pet
While the world is in denial

He will hunt till Armageddon
Won't stop before the deed is done
Coming for you, coming for me
Time to set the sinners free

In the night, in the moonlight
From the shadows he will avenge
In the night, in the moonlight
He's waiting for revenge and he will drag you
Back to Hell

[Solo: Denner]
[Solo: Shermann]

Coming for you, coming for me
Time to set the sinners free

In the night, in the moonlight
From the shadows he will avenge
In the night, in the moonlight
He is coming for you
In the night, in the moonlight
He's waiting for revenge and he will drag you
Back to Hell

He will drag yo back to Hell
Back to Hell
