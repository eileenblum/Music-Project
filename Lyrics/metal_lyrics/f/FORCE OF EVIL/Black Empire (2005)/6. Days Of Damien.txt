Wild winds are blowing in my face
Something has changed in this godforsaken place
A distant thunder roars in the horizon
Dark clouds are closing in, closing in from Zion
Burning omens flashes like a warning
Bloody Ages approaching a new dawning
If you listen closely to your heart
It's no surprise the earth is falling apart

Days of Damien - coming down the hall
Days of Damien - see the writings on the wall
Days of Damien - oblivion calls when darkness falls
Days of Damien

As we look into the black abyss
Another race blessed with the Devil's kiss
Winter snow will cover everything
Time has come for the crowning of a new king
Crossing oceans fast as a shark
Something evil is hiding in the dark
Looking straight into the eyes of the wild
The curse is coming disguised as a child

Days of Damien - coming down the hall
Days of Damien - see the writings on the wall
Days of Damien - oblivion calls when darkness falls
Days of Damien
Days of Damien - coming down the hall
Days of Damien - see the writings on the wall
Days of Damien - oblivion calls when darkness falls
Days of Damien

Nations will crash, dust will be dust
When the Master arise here tonight
All hope is lost and we will burn
As the Empire rises from within
Just by looking in his eyes
The Devil in disguise, a little boy and his lies

You must accept Christ as your savior
You must take communion
Drink the blood of Christ and eat his flesh
Only if he is in you can you defeat the son of the Devil
Only through Christ can you fight him
Accept the lord Jesus and drink his blood
And drink his blood
The beast comes alive in the night
A fight between darkness and light
Darkness and light

When the Jews return to Zion and a comet ripe the sky
And the holy Roman Empire rises, then you and I must die
He who will not be saved by the lamb will be torn by the beast
Go to the city of Megiddo and see Bugenhagen before it's too late

Days of Damien - coming down the hall
Days of Damien - see the writings on the wall
Days of Damien - oblivion calls when darkness falls
Days of Damien
Days of Damien - coming down the hall
Days of Damien - see the writings on the wall
Days of Damien - oblivion calls when darkness falls
It falls on the world

Save us father, for the wicked one
Save us father, for the wicked one
Save us father, for the wicked one
