A ghost trail of revenge
Against Hell there's no defence
Vohees' revenge, Vorhees' revenge

Down at Crystal Lake
Evil spreading like a plague
Nightfall is here to stay
You are the chosen prey

The Crystal Lake Massacre
Vorhees' revenge
The Crystal Lake Massacre
Vorhees' revenge

A ghost trail of revenge
Against Hell there's no defence
Adding up another kill
A vicious mind, a vicious will
Another Friday, another kill
Execution on the hill

The Crystal Lake Massacre
Vorhees' revenge
The Crystal Lake Massacre
Vorhees' revenge

Drinking at the river of blood
As he cuts down another slut
The last murder episode
Maybe one more for the road

[Solo: Shermann]
[Solo: Denner]

Buried deep in the ground
A heart of evil will always pound
Hell be the judge, he'll be the jury
The return of Jason's fury
Another Friday, another kill
Execution on the hill
Flames of evil burning strong
Dying to the funeral song

The Crystal Lake Massacre
Vorhees' revenge
The Crystal Lake Massacre
Vorhees' revenge
Fire, fire at the Crystal Lake
Fire, fire Vorhees' revenge
