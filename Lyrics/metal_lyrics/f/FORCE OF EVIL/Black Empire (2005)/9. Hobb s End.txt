It started out as a horror book
But what a wrong turn is surely took
Sitting here in my prison cell
Waiting for the monsters from Hell
A twist of my reality
Written pages of my destiny

Inside the walls of an iron church
Releasing the dogs from Hell
I couldn't believe my own eyes
Trapped in a conspiracy of lies
The becoming of a dark event
You'll find it all in Hobbs end

In the mouth of madness
In the mouth of madness

Another puppet in the show
Chosen to bring mankind deep below
This is the Devil's work
Only one man, only one king

Inside the walls of the iron church
Releasing the dogs from Hell
Behind the gates commanding the end, Hell awaits
The becoming of a dark event
You'll find it all in Hobbs end

In the mouth of madness
In the mouth of madness

Paid to investigate
Creating his own fate
Revealing the biggest scam
In the town of the damned

[Solo: Shermann]
[Solo: Denner]

He's the one who pulls the string
Corrupting my mind and my soul
The becoming of a dark event
You'll find it all in Hobbs end

In the mouth of madness
In the mouth of madness
In the mouth of madness
In the mouth of madness
In the mouth of madness
In the mouth of madness
