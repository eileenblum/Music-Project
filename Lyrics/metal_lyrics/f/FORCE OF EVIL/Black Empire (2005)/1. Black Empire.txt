I welcome you all to my world
A journey down to my true soul
And maybe you don't like what you see her
I welcome you all to the home of the Black Empire
Black Empire

The abandoned house of insanity
Twisting your mind forever remains
The castle of pain
Eventually we all will burn
And evil will rise from the dust

Enter the gateway - annihilation of all the light
Enter the gateway - and the Black Empire
Enter the gateway - dogs of Hell will rule the night
Enter the gateway - and the Black Empire

Beyond the darkest room, the invisible hell
Ghost in black will attack
Evil rising up high, children of the damned
The unholy kingdom will slaughter all

Enter the gateway - annihilation of all the light
Enter the gateway - and the Black Empire
Enter the gateway - dogs of Hell will rule the night
Enter the gateway - and the Black Empire

A godforsaken house
Possessed by Satan's Breath
It's a long walk in the dark
The path to insanity lies ahead
Built on poisonous soil and dirt
Once again the cursed grave
Will awake the corpses from beyond
And the holy church will burn

From the dawn of time the fire burned in man
In every one of us hides another face deep inside
The beast is asleep but soon it will reappear
Demon eyes awaits in the dark

[Solo: Denner]
[Solo: Shermann]

The abandoned house of insanity
Twisting your mind forever remains
The castle of pain
Eventually we all will burn
And evil will rise from the dust

Enter the gateway - annihilation of all the light
Enter the gateway - and the Black Empire
Enter the gateway - dogs of Hell will rule the night
Enter the gateway - and the Black Empire
Enter the gateway - annihilation of all the light
Enter the gateway - and the Black Empire
Enter the gateway - dogs of Hell will rule the night
Enter the gateway - and the Black Empire
