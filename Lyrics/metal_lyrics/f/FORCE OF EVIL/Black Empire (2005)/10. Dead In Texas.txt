On a road straight into the dark
Branded with the devils mark

On a Teaxs desert highway
Mutilation to your dying day
In a house in the middle of nowhere
Cutting flesh and bone without care

Leatherface, Leatherface
Awaits behind the door
Leatherface, Leatherface
The man with the chainsaw
Leatherface, Leatherface
Grandfather still swings the axe
With the devils mark

Dead, dead in Texas
Dead, dead in Texas

Blood runs in the family tree
A murder ballad, a ballad of misery
Storing corpses in the basemen
Mutilation written in the testament

Leatherface, Leatherface
Awaits behind the door
Leatherface, Leatherface
The man with the chainsaw
Leatherface, Leatherface
Grandfather still swings the axe
With the devils mark

Dead, dead in Texas
Dead, dead in Texas

[Solo: Shermann]
[Solo: Denner]

Like a thousand worms eating meat
Evil claws scratching in the street

Separating body parts and skin
A new doll for the baby kin
Hammering heads and smashing skulls

Leatherface, Leatherface
Awaits behind the door
Leatherface, Leatherface
The man with the chainsaw
Leatherface, Leatherface
Grandfather still swings the axe
With the devils mark

Dead, dead in Texas
Dead, dead in Texas
Dead, dead in Texas
Dead, dead in Texas
Dead, dead, dead, dead in Texas

Slaughter waits behind the door
A road straight into the dark
Branded with the devils mark
