Creator of the Dead Zone
Turn our minds into stone
Grandfather of Misery
He's the storm of the century
Tales from Castle Rock
Brings the nation in chock
From the flames of Carrie's hate
To the Pet Sematary gate

Like a silver bullet speeding the night
Last man on the graveyard shift
Goes beyond your fear when he appear
Takes you on a sinister flight
The cast and the crew, the God with the gift
From the Shining to Christine

Disciples of the King
Pure evil he will bring
Disciples of the King
His legacy sill scream

[Solo: Shermann]

Sometimes they come back
The sleepwalker will attack
The Dream Catcher sleeping though
Fire starter is coming for you
The Green Mile on death row
The Creep show and the Cujo
The curse of the clown
The sickest one in town

Like a silver bullet speeding the night
Last man on the graveyard shift
Goes beyond your fear when he appear
Takes you on a sinister flight
The cast and the crew, the God with the gift
From the Shining to Christine

Disciples of the King
Pure evil he will bring
Disciples of the King
His legacy will scream

[Solo: Denner]
[Solo: Shermann]

Disciples of the King
Pure evil he will bring
Disciples of the King
His legacy will scream
Disciples of the King
Pure evil he will bring
Disciples of the King
His legacy will scream
Disciples of the King
