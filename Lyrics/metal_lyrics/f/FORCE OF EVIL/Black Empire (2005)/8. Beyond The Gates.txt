Ave new world, a better place for you
Stand in line, a darker point of view
Stan's breath will lead you the way
Immortal life, one with judgement day

Master
Of the underworld, the dark abyss
You will get the devil's kiss
Angel in black, Lucifer's attack

Beyond the gates
Where Hell is home
Beyond the gates
Down in the thunder dome
Beyond the gates
Where Hell is home
Beyond the gates
Way down in the thunder dome

Dear old friend goes by many names
The Diablo spreads his wicked games
Murder and guilt, every drop is spilled

Beyond the gates
Where Hell is home
Beyond the gates
Down in the thunder dome
Beyond the gates
Where Hell is home
Beyond the gates
Way down in the thunder dome

[Solo: Denner]

Like the early morning light
You will feel it when it bites
It's nice to have a family
Even if it's Lucifer's

[Solo: Shermann]

The hammer of Hell will smash the holy man
Choose your path, you got to make a stand

Power to give
A new way to live

Beyond the gates
Where Hell is home
Beyond the gates
Down in the thunder dome
Beyond the gates
Where Hell is home
Beyond the gates
Way down in the thunder dome
Beyond the gates
Where Hell is home
Beyond the gates
Way down in the thunder dome
Beyond the gates
Where Hell is home
Beyond the gates
Down in the thunder dome
Beyond the gates
Beyond the gates
Beyond the gates
