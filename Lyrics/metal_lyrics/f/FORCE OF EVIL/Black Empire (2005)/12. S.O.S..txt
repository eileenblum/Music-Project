Father, hear my prayers
Give me courage in the final hour
I will strike down those of unbelief
And I shall serve you till the end

Men dropping in the dirt
See it in their eyes that it hurts
It's the last unholy crusade
We are the legions of hate
Legions of hate

Waiting at the border
To bring on the slaughter
Getting ready to engage
Surrounded by filth and rage
Holding hammers up high
On the signal chant or die
Pounding the symphony of doom
As the creature crawls out of its tomb
Devastating troops at the frontline
Armed with unbreakable steel from Hell

Battleground 666
Battleground 666

[Solo: Shermann]

The storm will soon be unleashed
Armageddon in the west and the east
Dark union, loyal till the end
In need for blood and quick decent
Down to the creator of the lost
We will attack at any cost
Penetrating sound of metal through skin
Man the canons, let the war begin
Devastating troops at the frontline
The judgement flag swings in the wind

Battleground 666
Battleground 666

Sons of Satan will never fall
Sons of Satan will conquer all
Sons of Satan will never fall
Sons of Satan will conquer all
Sons of Satan will never fall
Sons of Satan will conquer all

Our enemies will be way out numbered
As we march straight into the afterlife

Sons of Satan will never fall
Sons of Satan will conquer all
Sons of Satan will never fall
Sons of Satan will conquer all

[Solo: Denner]

Standing at the gate to Armageddon
I've been here before and I will be here again
Standing at the gate to Armageddon
I've been here before and I will be here again
Standing at the gate to Armageddon
I've been here before and I will be here again
Standing at the gate to Armageddon
I've been here before and I will be here again
