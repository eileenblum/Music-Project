Miles and miles just for you
Through storms and rain, that's what we do
Another jet, another bus
Our on the quest, just for the rush
Way up high in the clouds
Of thunder, lightning strikes down under
Waiting hours all the time
On the ground the arrival is all that counts
We're coming down just for you
We're taking this town

Evil comes alive
The Force has returned
Evil comes alive
The Force has returned

Crashing in the hall for the night
We are waiting for the devils flight
Blood and wine, that's what we bring
All for the crowd, loyalty is what it's all about
Blind pilots in the sky looking closely into the magic eye
You're the speed in our veins
Trashing trains and hammering airplanes
We're coming down just for you
We're taking this town

Evil comes alive
The Force has returned
Evil comes alive
The Force has returned

[Solo: Denner]
[Solo: Shermann]

We're coming down just for you
We're taking this town
Expect the best, we stand the test
The darkest fest and you are the guest

Evil comes alive
The Force has returned
Evil comes alive
The Force has returned

Evil comes alive
Evil comes alive
Evil comes alive here tonight
