I have chosen this path of loneliness
From within my soul is poisoned with emptiness
I sold my flesh for personal glory
And I ended up in another demonic story

Death comes crawling
Can't you hear the force is calling for you
Death comes crawling
Can't you hear the wolves are howling tonight

Slowly I feel the force consuming my mind
There's a price to pay for what I left behind

Death comes crawling
Can't you hear the force is calling for you
Death comes crawling
Can't you hear the wolves are howling tonight

It's dying time for the slaves of the night
Trapped in a tunnel with no ending light
Marching through blood to fulfil his command
Burned in the skin the pentagram in my hand

Doing business with the dark master of sin
He's the one, the savior that took me in
Now I'm condemned to walk alone
Alone in fear

Death comes crawling
Can't you hear the force is calling for you
Death comes crawling
Can't you hear the wolves are howling tonight

The devil is waiting in the dark

My life and my fate belongs to him now
No matter where I go, he is always right behind me
Till the day he chooses to collect

Serving only one real god that tears me apart
Blood for blood and pain for the insane
Serving only one real god that tears me apart
Blood for blood and pain for the insane
Serving only one real god that tears me apart
Blood for blood and pain for the insane

Like a curse coming from the old Egypt
Like a curse coming from the old Egypt
Like a curse coming from the old Egypt
Like a curse coming from the old Egypt
