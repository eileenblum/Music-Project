Stung to death as punishment
Eternal years of torment
They took the arm with a saw
Judged by their own marshal law
Nightmare printed on the wall

Be my victim, be my crime
Sweets to the sweet

Candyman - his name is
Candyman - you blame the
Candyman - here comes the
Candyman

Shadows from the dark corridor
Dreams will never be, be like before
Hear me whisper in your ears
Come along and I'll show you fear
A demon with many names

Be my victim, be my crime
Sweets to the sweet

Candyman - his name is
Candyman - you blame the
Candyman - here comes the
Candyman

[Solo: Denner]
[Solo: Shermann]

Behind the mirror, the man with the hook

Be my victim, be my crime
Sweets to the sweet

Here comes the
Candyman - his name is
Candyman - you blame the
Candyman - here comes the
Candyman

Cabrini Green is where he lives
A fairytale of slaughter
Cabrini Green is where he lives
A fairytale of slaughter
Cabrini Green is where he lives
A fairytale of slaughter
Cabrini Green is where he lives
A fairytale of slaughter
