Coming from beyond, from deep down below
The curse is on you everywhere you go
Darkness to bring the demons to rise
Bewitched by the damned, mankind's fall
The final demise

Force, the Force of Evil
The curse is coming your way
The Force, the Force of Evil
The curse, the calling

Enslaving the world with a deadly spell
Claiming the throne, the hunters from Hell
Up from the grave, united at last
The horsemen return
Awake the beast, a strike from the past

Force, the Force of Evil
The curse is coming your way
The Force, the Force of Evil
The curse, the calling

Rise up, rise up
The legions of the dead
In Hell, in Hell
We will meet again
Rise up, rise up
The legions of the dead
In Hell, in Hell
We will meet again

Coming from beyond, from deep down below
The curse is on you everywhere you go
Up from the grave, united at last
The horsemen return
Awake the beast, a strike from the past

Force, the Force of Evil
The curse is coming your way
The Force, the Force of Evil
The curse, the calling

Come to get you
It's the calling
