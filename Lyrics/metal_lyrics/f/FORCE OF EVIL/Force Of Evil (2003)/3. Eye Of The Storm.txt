Can you hear the calling
The Force is reborn
God's angels falling
In the eyes of the storm

Can you hear the calling
The Force is reborn
God's angels falling
In the eyes of the storm

They are coming at night
You better run for your life

The demons are hunting again
Black shadows of death
Ghostriders of doom
Sent to destroy by the Devil
All sinners must pay
Eternal hell and decay

In the eye of the storm
Eye of the storm

We are serving the dead and we like it

Everywhere you go
Everywhere you turn
When the moon is full
Your soul will burn
Evil from ancient times
Has risen from the grave
The beast is loose again
And it's coming for you
Coming for you

Speak old priest
Before I cut your tongue
I'm the almighty Beast
Coming for the young

If you look closely into the magic eye
The truth will reveal who's the next to die

Can you hear the calling
The Force is reborn
God's angels falling
In the eyes of the storm

Can you hear the calling
The Force is reborn
God's angels falling
In the eyes of the storm

You can hide at the sea
You can hide in the sky

You will hang from the old tree
That's how it's gonna be
You'll see it's gonna be
Misery, eternal Hell and decay

In the eye of the storm
Eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
Eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
