Tonight my soul belongs to Lucifer
And I will obey

Tonight the demons are gathered
A masquerade for the evil ones
They celebrate the master, Lucifer
He who gives and he who takes
They all know that he is the one
The Beast, the angel in black
An outcast of God in Heaven
Majesty in the kingdom of pain

Trick or treat, my little friends
Nice and sweet, we will descend

It's halloween again
It's halloween, my little friends

It's time to start the freakshow
Down below where the fire burns
Can you feel the hate from the abyss
Satan's flames are everywhere
Out of the dark comes evil
Sneaking up from behind
The sign is clear, damnation has returned
To dominate and we will all get burned

Trick or treat, my little friends
Nice and sweet, we will descend

It's halloween again
It's halloween, my little friends
Halloween

The time has come
When the clock strikes midnight
The child belongs to the dark side
The blood of Christ is dying on the cross
The curse has come

The cradle crying in the night
The war is won by the beast in the fire
To rise as one, mighty legion go higher
The church is damned by the dead and the slaughter
One king will create a new world order

Come and take my hand
Someday you will understand, I know
Come and take my hand
This is the masterplan
Let it grow

It's halloween again
It's halloween my little friend
It's halloween again
