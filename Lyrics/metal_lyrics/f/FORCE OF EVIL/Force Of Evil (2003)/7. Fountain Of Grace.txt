Like the smallest raindrop
From a mountaintop
When it falls it never stops
As a river towards the sea
Like you and me
In that we rush trying to be

Fountain of grace
It flows and embrace
Fountain of grace
Flow and embrace

Still I will be reaching out
Still I will be holding on

As the rain from above
In the boat we shove
Watercolors
The tiger and the dove
On the surface of time
The sun will always shine
Break or bend, the vapor line

Fountain of grace
It flows and embrace
Fountain of grace
Flow and embrace

Still I will be reaching out
Still I will be holding on
