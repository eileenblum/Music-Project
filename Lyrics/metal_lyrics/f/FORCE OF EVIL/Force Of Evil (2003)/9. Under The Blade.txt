In 1799 when the moon started to shine
Bodies in the open ground
Their heads were nowhere to be found
It's a haunted place out there
The people no longer care
All the evil ancient seed
Feeds peoples deadly greed

A ghost coming from the grave
No one here is surely safe
Twenty years has gone by
Now everybody will die

Under, under the blade
Under, under the blade I'm going
Under, under the blade
Under, under the blade

Out of the old oak tree
Love of carnage is the key
Riding on a horse so black
The bloody blade is back

Under, under the blade
Under, under the blade I'm going
Under, under the blade
Under, under the blade

Traffic on the graveyard
Everybody's going down
The killing has begun
Deep in the western woods

You're under the blade
The Devil's crusade
The legend has returned
You're under the blade
The Devil's crusade
In fear you will burn
You're under the blade
The Devil's crusade
The legend has returned
You're under the blade
The Devil's crusade
In fear you will burn

Under, under the blade
Under, under the blade I'm going
Under, under the blade
Under, under the blade
I'm going under, under
