There is no one to blame
Everybody is born to die
And no one gets out alive
You can't run from the devil
Your faith won't save you in the end

They promise you Heaven and Hell
Trying to break the spell
Seven sins inside you and me
Will I ever be set free

We are damned for eternity
It's our destination
We are struggling for survival
In the paradise of pain
We are damned for eternity
Suffocation
I can not breathe the air in here
Is there no way out of here

Nations are burning
Thousands are dying
It gets worse every day
I am an unbeliever
The me God is pure illusion
And we're all alone

They promise you Heaven and Hell
Trying to break the spell
Seven sins inside you and me
Will I ever be set free

We are damned for eternity
It's our destination
We are struggling for survival
In the paradise of pain
We are damned for eternity
Suffocation
I can not breathe the air in here
Is there no way out of here

We are damned for eternity
It's our destination
We are struggling for survival
In the paradise of pain
We are damned for eternity
Suffocation
I can not breathe the air in here
Is there no way out of here
