Slaughter pushed in your face
Disorder in the human race
Violence breathe down the neck everywhere I go
Beaten down by the government
Helltown, every penny spent
Punishment, the final hours of pain
Alone on death row

Offspring of the wicked one
Unholy sacrifice
Mankind is facing armageddon

Hell on Earth - we're burning
Hell on Earth - your destruction
Hell on Earth - death angel
Hell on Earth

Warfare, the bodycount is high
Nightmare, are you ready to die
The Antichrist will soon arise
We will all be colonized
Bloodbath thousands will fall
Gods wrath, we overheard the call
Damien sent from the dark
Son of Satan will terrorize

Offspring of the wicked one
Unholy sacrifice
Mankind is facing armageddon

Hell on Earth - we're burning
Hell on Earth - destruction
Hell on Earth - death angel
Hell on Earth

Look in the eyes of the lion
It reflects what is real
Look in the eyes of the lion
It's too late now you've made the deal

Offspring of the wicked one
Unholy sacrifice
Mankind is facing armageddon

Hell on Earth - we're burning
Hell on Earth - destruction
Hell on Earth - death angel
Hell on Earth
Hell on Earth - we're burning
Hell on Earth - destruction
Hell on Earth - death angel
Hell on Earth
