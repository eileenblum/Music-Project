Seems like the walls are closing in on me
But in the end I know that I'll be free
Burning all the bridges along the way
I'm facing Hell every single day

I am the misery man
Drowning in the sands
I am the misery man
No one will understand

All the things I've said and all the things I've done
Put me in this place, nailed to the gun
Sorrow and despair rides along with me
I'm raising Hell, it's my destiny

I am the misery man
Drowning in the sand
I am the misery man
No one will understand

I feel the rope squeeze around my neck
I look around and see a world that makes me sick
Another day with endless slavery
I draw the line, I've reached my dying day

I am the misery man
Drowning in the sand
I am the misery man
No one will understand

Seems like the walls are closing in on me
In the end I know that I'll be free
Burning all the bridges along the way
Facing Hell every single day
Seems like the walls are closing in on me
In the end I know that I'll be free
Burning all the bridges along the way
Facing Hell every single day
Seems like the walls are closing in on me
In the end I know that I'll be free
Burning all the bridges along the way
Facing Hell every single day
