Everything is torn
All we had is lost
You manipulate
You discriminate me
Try to break me down
With your psychotrip
If you violate
Your soul will desecrate

You will burn
In your own private hell
You will burn in hell
You will burn
In your own private hell
You will burn in hell

You can not control
My head anymore
I will not be used
Never be seduced again
Your tricks no longer work
Your lies have no effect
So get out of my mind
No more Mr. Blind

You will burn
In your own private hell
You will burn in hell
You will burn
In your own private hell
You will burn in hell

I don't know what's going on
And I can't figure out what is wrong
It seems like a mental breakdown
A suicidal crazy shake down
I don't know what's going on
And I can't figure out what is wrong
Inside your twisted head
Inside your twisted head

Everything is torn
All we had is lost
You manipulate
You discriminate me

You will burn
In your own private hell
You will burn in hell
You will burn
In your own private hell
You will burn in hell
