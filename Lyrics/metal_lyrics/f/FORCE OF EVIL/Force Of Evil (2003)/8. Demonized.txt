Walking on the trail of tears
Chained to the other side
Facing all the darkest fear
No one leaves tonight

Why are all my dreams so bloody red
Evil nightmares burning in my head
The agony only one can fix
His number is 666
Raised by a jackal in the night

Demonized Evilized
Die in the name of misery
Demonized Evilized
Lost in the forest of agony

Born under a black star
Left all alone in the snow
But I've made it so far
A hand from the abyss below

Why are all my dreams so bloody red
Evil nightmares burning in my head
The agony only one can fix
His number is 666
Raised by a jackal in the night

Demonized Evilized
Die in the name of misery
Demonized Evilized
Lost in the forest of agony

Child of the damned is growing in me
The Master of Darkness will soon be released
Child of the damned is growing in me
The Master of Darkness will soon be released
