Believe it or not the notes are trying to talk to me
I've got to applaud such valiant efforts
It's not always the party that it seems to be
It can be a complete debacle
This is not the most routine 9-5 you see
There are some occupational hazards

Perhaps you'll try to save my spot?
Just until the album drops
Then I'll be at the Capri shop
Adjacent to the graham L stop

Believe it or not we're not the ideal guys to date
So I guess I'm a risky decision
But you did not write me off, you knew that I could change
So I'm studying my guide to safety

It's so hard to tell if this is an artistic achievement
Or am I singing for obligation
When all I want is to feel my heart rate
Accelerate, and we accelerate
