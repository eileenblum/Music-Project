We all have things to hide. We know what has been tried. The hard part
That we find is putting pen to paper. I know I should expose everything
That's inside. But the question that plagues us is can we open our
Lives?

I lay it out on the line, for all to see
This is how we strive for greatness.
Let's share our dark sides, this has to be our time.
This is our time.
I'll open my door with this I let you in.
Come one come all.
This is our world, feel free to come along.
Come one come all

Robotic full of doubt
Lets get our frustration out
This microphones a weapon in conjunction with my mouth.
