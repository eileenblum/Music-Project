Always a spectacle, it's a public show,
Unimpressed so it's time that I let you go
Reputations from these antics
I may not be pure but I'm not all that toxic

Now I'm checking out and enlisting for stable living
So let's drop the act, I've found something that's more appealing

All this dependence on modern machinery
Come for the weekend and you'll stay for the scenery
Tear down the building, bludgeon the architect
Biased opinion from outdated intellect

If I wanted to make a comeback would kids receive me
Unemployment, I've been ruined by young hands clapping

And we keep sailing, with a fear of failing

Listen while they say your name
Sail on (Josh)
We hang our heads and take the blame
Sail on (Josh)
A daggermouth is in control
Sail on (Josh)
These chemicals will take your soul (Brian)
Sail on (Josh)
