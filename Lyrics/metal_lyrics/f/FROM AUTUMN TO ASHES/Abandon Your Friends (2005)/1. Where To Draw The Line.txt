Lay it down one last time, let this be the last time,
I have seen the sunrise just one too many times.
With open arms and minds.
Stay with me till I find,
What it is we search cause I know we want more.

On earth as it is in a dime store. For all the amateurs that you've
Knelt before.
Breaks my mind in two.
They surrounds us.
One more night without you.
They surrounds us.
Take my will with you.
They surrounds us.
Break my mind into.....

One, breathe in to be free
Two more time and you'll see
Three, it will numb all the pain
How hard is it to be sane?

Won our will to be seen
Raise our hands and we'll scream
Speak your mind and you'll see
What it is like to free

One breather in to be free
Two more times and you'll see
Three it will numb all the pain
How hard is it to be sane?
