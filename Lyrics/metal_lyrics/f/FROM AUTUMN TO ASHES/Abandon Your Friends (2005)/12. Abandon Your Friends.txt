Young women and young men
Forgive us if you can
Abandon your best friends
It's demanding and filled with detriment

Leaving your lover home waiting
Putting much faith in her patience
Don't fool yourself it's not endless
Phone calls are poor consolations

We've abandoned our best friends

Thanks to the_bastard_child for correcting track #7 lyrics.
