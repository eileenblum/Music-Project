It's not a far commute to access the company of brighter pigments
Administer abuse, detach then release a pixilated statement
Recessive paper weights in training, school children infiltrate the brainstem
Sexual organs start exchanging
It feels like I'm in a Darger painting, Henry must have been lonely

Van city's got a wide array of suspects
They're not afraid to do whatever you suggest
Seems to be no shortage of the excess
So let's dive in, let's dive in

A contraceptive verse, deceiving, so no one figures out what I mean
I'll harvest my tongue, negating lyrical parasites in waiting Zip driven amputee
Frustrated, can't seem to get a clear connection
You may have hit eject, impatient, feels like this room is going to cave in
And it could happen this instant

Submerged in an amber grave, that's not how you'll calculate your worth
Don't consider it a waste, cannot keep from moving in reverse
Don't question me about the content, I'm not in the mood for explanation
So figure this out for yourself
