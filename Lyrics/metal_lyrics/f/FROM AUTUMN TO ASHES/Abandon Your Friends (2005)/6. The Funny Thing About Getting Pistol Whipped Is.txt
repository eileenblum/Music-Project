Extraction, no one moves
Aggravation is the current mood
Closed accounts, prosecute
Dressed in these outdated suits
Transmission incorrect
Is there anyone that's competent?
Dismissal but I can't vacate
Forcing my seeds to germinate

Like history in the making
Can we please blur the edges
Of this past memory

This will make for a great story that we will never repeat
So nod your head and tap your feet
Because that's the only review I need

The capillaries ball into a fist
I tuck it safely away inside my pocket
How can I be more obvious
Blazers are worthless when you cant produce a hit

And I hope to be the biggest disappointment
