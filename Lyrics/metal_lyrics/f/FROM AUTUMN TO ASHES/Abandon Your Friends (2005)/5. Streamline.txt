I see and empty space next to the yellow bumble bee
That could be the perfect place to park my broken down ten speed
Just tell me when you get off work and where you'd like to meet
Then we can pedal up and down the crowded New York streets

My shoes are worn out, because the breaks don't function
I just put my feet down and let them drag on the pavement

When our legs get tired you can pick a spot to eat
Evelyn's so elegant and Nikolai's right by her side

Under one umbrella, just talking and joking
And I knew that I'd love you, for as long as you'd let me

And I haven't caught my breath since the moment that we met

We can be alone and not feel lonely
I've been drawing these robots with the pen you sent me
