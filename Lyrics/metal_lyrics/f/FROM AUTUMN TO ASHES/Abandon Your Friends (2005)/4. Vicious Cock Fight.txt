Twice as arrogant as I am talented
Inspiration has been diluted
I'm dependent on this solution
Thank you Tennessee for your contribution
Keep conspiring towards my reduction

There's a nervous breakdown building beneath
This calm exterior but no one seems to notice
Not exactly a charismatic speaker with rising demand
I just get buried deeper

I think it's time I let you know
That my rope ended miles ago
When progression bottoms out
You must consider another route

Anthematic patrons that practice masked identity
For the socially anxious stop the acting
I'd rather navigate the peaks and valleys of unchartered
Headspace
