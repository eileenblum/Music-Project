Dismiss the telegram
This is no exhibition
A pile of papers that are bound and tethered
We know the end of man will stem
From stale tradition
Relaying opinions
Changing like the weather

And this will never be and this will never be reversed
An installation
Sending an open invitation
To all the pioneers driven by suspicion
The old world is gone and
We keep wishing for a new frontier
To sink our teeth in and
Forget what you thought you believed in

The plans we execute are far between and few
But I'll go around the world just for something to do
Existence is fleeting
You spend your life dreaming
The shores are exhausted
The time is receding

And this will never be a
And this will never be reversed
An installation
Sending an open invitation
To all the pioneers driven by suspicion
The old world is gone
And we keep wishing for a new frontier
To sink our teeth in
And forget what you thought you believed in

And those who resisted
Were dragged out form their homes
This necklace was fashioned out of their teeth and bones
And those who resisted
Were dragged out from their homes
This necklace was fashioned out of their teeth and bones
Their teeth and bones

To all the pioneers driven by suspicion
The old world is gone and
We keep wishing for a new frontier
To sink our teeth in
And forget what we thought we believed in

Resistance is fleeting
Resistance is fleeting
Resistance is fleeting
Resistance is fleeting
