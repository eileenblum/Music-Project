You might be just what I need 
No I would not change a thing 
Been dreaming of this so long 
But we only exist in this song 
The thing is, I'm not worth the sorrow 
And if you come and meet me tomorrow 
I will hold you down, fold you in 
Deep, deep, deep in the fiction we live 
I break in two over you 
I break in two 
And if a piece of you dies 
Autumn, I will bring you back to life 
Of course I see you 
I do.
