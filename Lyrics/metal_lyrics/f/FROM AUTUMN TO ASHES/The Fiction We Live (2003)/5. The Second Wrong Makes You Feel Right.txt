Begin, present, fade out,
Judgement please don't fail me now,
This time, this time
A lesson learned is a picture burned,
You're a memory to me,
Upon ignition come bear witness to the greatest therapy,
Just begin, present, fade out,
Judgement please don't fail me now,
This time
That was the day I put your picture aside.
Swallowed the fact that our dream had died.
Every time you close your mind,
You should be seeing me.
Every time you close your eyes (at night)
Every time you close your eyes
You should be seeing me.
As you lay in bed at night, I'll be there in your dreams.
So sorrows in, is that what you heard?
You can't cash in on what went wrong. 
Helpless isn't the right word but it's the first that
comes to mind, 
There's worse things than being alone, 
I think in time I'll get by
That was the day I put your picture aside.
Swallowed the fact that our dream had died.
Every time you close your mind,
You should be seeing me.
Begin, present, fade out,
Judgement please don't fail me now
You're to die for.
Life means more.
Out of sight.
With no light.
