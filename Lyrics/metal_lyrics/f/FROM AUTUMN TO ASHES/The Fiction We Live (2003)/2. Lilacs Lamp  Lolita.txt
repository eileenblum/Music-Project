So I'm sorry, 
as two hands open doors. 
So I'm sorry, 
Something serene to steal my life away. 

Climbing on the way up, 
Sizing up the competition, 
Waiting for the right time, 
Strike a chord and change your life. 

Don't you ever think for one-second that 
i will forget the reasons that i cried. 
You are no more potent than words that choke me 
I sit and ask you two words. 

This is not a product, 
We're not in a competition,
Waiting for the right time, 
Strike a chord and change your life. 

Regret's how i spell your name. 
In light of what you have done. 
How can you not feel the same? 
My love will fade with the sun. 
As days go by, shed a tear. 
I hate your face more than life. 
I'll fake a smile for (you) my dear. 
So turn away. 

Climbing on the way up, 
Sizing up the competition, 
Waiting for the right time, 
Strike a chord and change your life.
