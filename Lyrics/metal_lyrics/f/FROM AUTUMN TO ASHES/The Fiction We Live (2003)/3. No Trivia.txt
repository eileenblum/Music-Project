M, 4, V, T, C and H
Might need to provide this number at the gate
Steady pilot because I'm half afraid
I can't believe youd ask me that
Of Course I dont believe in fate
Would you be depressed?
If I attend that wedding, but only as a guest
Such an unfaithful bride draped in dress
Spun with threads of my regret
Sing it loud to drown out the feeling
When you're feeling much more odd (even)
And half as true as dishonored seamen
We'll breathe Pacific and fight our demons
Would you be depressed?
If I attend that wedding, but only as a guest
Such an unfaithful bride draped in dress
Spun with threads of my regret
So arch your back
And flip your hair
Make eye contact so you know I care
You know I care
But only as a guest
Such an unfaithful bride draped in dress
Spun with threads of my regret
