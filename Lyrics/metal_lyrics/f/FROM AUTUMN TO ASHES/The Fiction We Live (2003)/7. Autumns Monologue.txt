Oh why can't I be what you need? 
A new improved version of me. 
But I'm nothing so good 
no, I'm nothing... 
just bones, a lonely ghost burning down songs
of violence, of love, and of sorrow. 
I beg for just one more tomorrow! 
Where you'd hold me down, fold me in 
deep deep deep in the heart of your sins. 

I'd break in two over you 
I'd break in two 
and each piece of me dies 
and only you can give the breath of life! 
But you don't see me. You dont. 

Here I'm pinned between darkness and light, 
bleached and blinded by these nights. 
Where I'm tossing and tortured till dawn 
by you, visions of you, then you're gone. 
The shock bleeds the red from my face, 
when i hear someone's taken my place. 
How could love be so thoughtless, so cruel? 
When all, all that i did was for you... 

I'd break in two over you 
I'd break in two 
and each piece of me dies 
and only you can give the breath of life! 
But you dont see me. You don't. 

I'd break in two over you 
I'd break in two 
and each piece of me dies 
and only you can give the breath of life! 
But you don't see me. You don't. 

I'd break in two over you, 
I'd break in two over you! Over you 
I'd break in two, 
I would break in two for you. 
Now you see me, now you don't. 
Now you need me, now you don't.
