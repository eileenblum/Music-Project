In you I see further.
Can it last forever?
Identify your patients, XY configurations
Words are lost in your eyes.
One thought inside my heart.
Drop addicts in the mixture, falcons have blown the fixture
Think of me as days pass us by.
Shards of glass
Skin of gold
Steal my breath
Blood runs cold
Violet waves
Oceans blue
All my love
Lost in you
In you I see further.
Can it last forever?
Sinkhole that we would frequent,
White heels safe from extinction
Words are lost in your eyes.
One thought inside my heart.
I said that I don't need you, but I'm a liar, I swear I do, I do
Strip away
Vanity
I do
Just as you
Consume me
I do
Broken smile
Starless sky
I do
Save it all
Say goodbye
You're out in left field, and lacking interest
You fight the boredom but it makes no difference
Your mental health kid, that's what's in question
Keep acting obscure, we'll keep them guessing
The moment ideas are conceived,
They'll be out of touch, obsolete,
They're faking champions hand picked,
And all the fights have been fixed,
You wake to suffer through the day,
Trade a dream for the pay,
Well here's the fact I hope it sticks,
You're just alive out of habit
Shards of glass
Skies of gold
Steal my breath
Blood runs cold
Violet waves
Oceans blue
All my love
Lost in you
Strip away
Part of me
Just as you consume me
Broken smile
Starless sky
End it all
Say good-bye.
Think of me as I say good-bye.
