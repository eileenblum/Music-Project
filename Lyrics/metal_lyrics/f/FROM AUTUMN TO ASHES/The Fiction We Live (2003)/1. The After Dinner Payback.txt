I'm not wishing anymore
I'm not writing songs for you
I sleep better in the dark
I'm not doing this for you

This is because of you I don't believe
Tongue tied an institute of my relief
You're my, my reason to shame
(my reason to shame)

I'm not wishing anymore
I'm not writing songs for you
I sleep better in the dark
I'm not doing this for you

This is because of you I don't believe
Tongue tied an institute of my relief

One wish that this is over
You are all I waste today
(discarded worthless throw it away)

Will it tear you apart?
Will it?
Will it tear you apart?

(When I turn and walk away
abandon, its not worth the effort
When Stalling means
Too fucking scared to create
abandon, its not worth the effort
When stalling and too scared)

One wish that this is over
You are all I waste today
(discarded worthless throw it away)

Will it tear you apart?
Will it?
Will it tear you apart?

When I turn and walk away
I'm not holding onto this
I'm not wasting words on you
I sleep alone in spite of it
I'll do anything for you

This is because of you I feel relief
Tongue tied to investigate what I believe
You're my, my reason to blame (my reason to blame)

I'm not holding onto this
I'm not wasting words on you
I sleep alone in spite of it
I'll do anything for you

This is because of you I feel relief
Tongue tied to instigate what I believe
You're my, my reason to blame (my reason to blame)
