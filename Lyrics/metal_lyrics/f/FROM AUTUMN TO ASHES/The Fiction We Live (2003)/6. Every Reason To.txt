I thought about the end today
The final chapter
The last scene
Ending what is here and what is now
And all there is to come.
No hope for tomorrow, for today.
Through all this talk, on how numb.
There's one just out of reach.
On how numb, and you bet it shows, you bet it shows
Shake downs like these get old,
So now I take my heart in hand,
Bleach out the shades of detriment,
Branded with names that I resent,
Worship on your knees again
Wear it upon my sleeve the end
Ending what is here and what is now
And all there is to come.
No hope for tomorrow, for today
Through all this talk, on how numb.
There's one just out of reach.
On how numb, and you bet it shows, you bet it shows
Shake downs like these get old,
And you bet it shows, you bet it shows
In your eyes I can see
Tomorrow out of reach.
This is detachment
In your eyes I can see
Tomorrow beyond me
