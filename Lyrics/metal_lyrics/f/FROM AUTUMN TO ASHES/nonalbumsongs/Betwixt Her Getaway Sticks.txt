[Ben screaming a line]

I'm not so, so puncturing and cynical

[Ben screaming a line]

Side effects risk severing umbilical

[Ben screaming a line]

Interupped by every individual

[Ben screaming a line]

Homesick wish list, pathogenic populace
You're dead weight, some say, guess that's what you make of it
But I've got brass fists, think I found a catalyst
But there's no perfect, it's all hit and miss

Don't try to disinfect my personality
I like my edges rough, I like offending
Maybe I'm full of shit or full of envy
Maybe I'm growing up, I guess we'll just wait and see
One day you'll stare at me but not judgmentally
An antiseptic sound is just what bores me
I'll show you just how difficult I can be
But my opinion might be the enemy

[Ben screams his chorus]

I'm so surrounded by this urban pharmacy
It gets the best of you, it got the best of me
It always piles up when I thought I was done
I feel like Hunter S, I just don't have a gun
One day you'll stare at me but not judgmentally
An antiseptic sound is just what bores me
I'll show you just how difficult I can be
But my opinion might be the enemy

[Ben reprises his chorus]
