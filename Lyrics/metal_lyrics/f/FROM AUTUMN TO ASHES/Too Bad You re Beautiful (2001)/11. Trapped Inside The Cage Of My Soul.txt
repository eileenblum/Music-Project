[Demo Version Bonus Track]

Inside me.
Empty.
Is how you left.
Confused scared alone, I am confused.
I am scared.
I am alone.
I am without you.
You are heartless, without compassion.
I will watch you die.
I will not cry.
Haze clouds these translucent eyes.
Sweat creeps down callused hands.
The lies outside, I cannot feel.
The pain inside burns.
And as tears slip she does it again.
Rips out my brittle heart.
Scarred, bruies and broken.
To the ground in tears I fall.
Adness locked inside me.
Time ticks by, and soon I realize life won't end, it can't end.
Not like this, not with sorrow and not with fear!
I know you are scared, cause I am too.
And as tears slip she does it again.
Haze clouds these translucent eyes.
Sweat creeps down callused hands.
The lies outside I cannot feel.
The pain inside burns.
I know you cared.
Why did you leave?
From my knees I now stand.
Bleeding for you from my heart.
Now cage.
Now praising life for what I was given.
From my knees I now stand.
Bleeding for you from my heart.
Now hating life for what was taken from me, by you.
