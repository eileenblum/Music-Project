I felt you slip away
Far away from me
Further from me
I felt you slip, away
Caught myself, wishing you back,
As I try to catch you
Anger swells inside me
I see me, frowning, in your eyes

(I see the fear in you, where no one should ever be, I'm here for you, as I try, to guide through)
I see my reflection
And the pain, inside me,
As I find...
As I try, catch you
From
Everything hurts me less and less until I feel nothing!

Anger swells inside me
I see me, frowning in your eyes
Slip away
Far away from me
Further from me
You seem to drift far away
Caught myself wishing you back
As I try

(let's go!)

She said, it's not that, I don't love you anymore, it would be so much more accurate to say, I never loved you in the first place,
Never in the first place,

I put the fear you should ever be
Nothing to me, everything you
Nothing to me, everything you
Nothing to me, everything you
Nothing to me, everything you

(I can't take it anymore when I'm with you I feel like I'm nothing, I feel like I'm nothing, that's why I don't like it when you touch me, that's why I never touch you, that's why I never even think about you, 'cause when I start it reminds me that I'm just not good enough)

You're nothing to me
You're nothing to me
You're nothing to me
You're nothing to me
