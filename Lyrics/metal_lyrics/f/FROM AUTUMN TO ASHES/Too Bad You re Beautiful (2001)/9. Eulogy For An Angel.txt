In a world of despair, our lives will end
Some without warning, while others die by design
Under watchful eyes, we tread on evil ground,
With jaded eyes around us each step is scrutinized
(in the pouring rain, we speed this car, I try so hard,
Wish I was more prepared for this time, you shouldn't have passed before me)
In this life we lead, a choice will be made
Where we go from here, when our time is done
At the gates of heaven, angels stare at us
May they lead you home to where you'll live in peace?
You take without warning
(I'll shut myself up and black out the windows)
As we sit and wait
(it's best to consider me dead as well)
Breath in take a life
(I'm hoping in time I'll get over)
Breath out, cleanse your soul
(I might be fine when I get older... no way)
You took her life
I gave you mine, to ease the pain of my soul, to show you how much shes meant to me
I will fight for our lives and take them to our graves
In a world of despair, our lives will end
Some with out warning, while others die by design
Under watchful eyes we tread on evil ground,
With jaded eyes around us, each step is scrutinized
I will defy you
The evil from above
Open my mind
Let you in
I will not forgive the sins you made
You took her life from me.
