The sound of my breath flutters past your ear
Tearing down fear
Grasp your heart strings by their frayed ends to choke down the feeling left inside
The sands of time slide down your cheek in the form of liquefied dreams
Each one stands for more than the next
You give yourself to all but you
To take all you had and give all thats left
How could you have been so blind?
The shallow waters that you come upon, show how empty your life truly is
You look into the vast nothingness to see something that is not there
You try to discern where to go from here
You try to make sense of this confusion that you have inside (your heart)
And how you can get there.
(this van is on a one way trip we'll rock it straight to hell,
Our Crue is Motley and our theatres filled with pain,
Across the creek and into your home,
Be there by eight because she doesn't want you any other way)
But by a force unknown (held back)
Deep inside you, your veins tied in knots
Bind your blistering hands
To keep you in this world forsaken
As you leave your wilting soul behind.
