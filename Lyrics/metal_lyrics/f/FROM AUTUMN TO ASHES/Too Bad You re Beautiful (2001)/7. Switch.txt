Darkness chokes my emotions
Your breath numbs my soul
Stand with me, by my side
Take my hand and lead the way
Out from the shadows and into the real world
Show me how to live a life owned by regret
My blood runs cold, lifeless in shame
Now is the time, to right the wrong
Inside my veins, poison words lie
Within a mind as guilty as yours
Take what is left inside of me
I've no use for it
Stained with thoughts uncaring, open and let me in
(it spun my head when I thought you were talking to me,
I guess I'm just a fool for thinking your thinking of me,
And now, I press my fist to the pillows wishing it was your teeth)
Show your world, deceit
Let me live as you, Need not to feel
Emotions rain down
Drowned by innocence, thoughts escape me
Harsh words spit blindly and open paths of life
Take all that is me, a lifeless somber soul
Curse the day you wake as solace sets in
Darkness chokes my emotions
Your breath numbs my soul
Stand with me, by my side
Take my hand, and lead the way
Out from the shadows and into my world
(My soul is not for you to own)
I will not live life to see your face anymore.
