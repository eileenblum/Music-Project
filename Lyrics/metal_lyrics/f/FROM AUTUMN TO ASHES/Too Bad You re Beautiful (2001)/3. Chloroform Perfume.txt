The end result of so many meetings
At late night dinners with no one eating
We sit in corners and sip burnt coffee
Count the tiles upon the ceiling
Skip this pretense and cut straight to dying
Don't pick me to keep your eyes from crying
You said so much without ever parting your lips

It's past 3 am and I'm still far from sleep
This is a habit that I can't break
You're my only company
I'm skipping stones

Street lights flicker like this match in my hand [x3]
Begging to strike [x2]

And I keep repeating, but this payphone tele stopped receiving
Flat out of change now I'm sure you won't accept the charges
It's all the same cause by the morning I'll be halfway to Colorado
Or some place like that

You said so much without ever parting your lips
It's past 3 am and I'm still far from sleep
This is a habit that I can't break
You're my only company
I'm skipping stones down a south suburban street

She keeps on asking "do you think it hurts much to die"
"It's hurting so much more to stay alive now"
She's gonna find out how much it hurts to die
She laced her perfume up with death
Feel it in my lungs
So I'll pull in the deepest breath
And drop my head
