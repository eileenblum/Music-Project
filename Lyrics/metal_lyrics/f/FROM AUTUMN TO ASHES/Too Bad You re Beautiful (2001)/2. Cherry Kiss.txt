Creation imperfect
Do you defy this?
Could you and your swollen ego fit into my master plan for failure?
I take the shame to heart and lock it away in a place thats sees not the light of day
I will use it when I see your face again
(your head in your hands and this is my cue,
If three words could heal you I would only speak two,
Your eyelids grow heavy and this is my cue,
If three words could heal you I'd only speak two)
How could you think after all you put me through
And all you put on my shoulders that I would answer your cries for help?
(How could you think after all you put me through
And all you put on my shoulders that I would answer your cry for help?)
Unleash the rage built up (in my throat)
Show how you hurt me and hopefully you see
You have the power to destroy my will to live
