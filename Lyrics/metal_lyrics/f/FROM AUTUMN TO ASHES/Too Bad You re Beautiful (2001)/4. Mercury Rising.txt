Every breath that I exhale is a sigh -
Every breath that I exhale is a sigh of exhaustion.
[repeating throughout]

How sad - this is what your life has been reduced to - a single room apartment containing no more than a mattress.
How sad when the strings have been removed from the blinds and all the outlets have been painted over.
And the television screen is streaked with blood smeared from your knuckles as you were trying to punch it out but you underestimated its strength, or maybe you just weren't trying hard enough.
Startled by a knock at the door you rise for the first time in two days to answer, but you can only greet the visitor with one short statement.
Hello my first name is
Distance and I really don't care if I never wake up again.
Hello my name is
Distance and I really don't care if I never wake up again.
Hello
I really don't care if I never wake up again.
I really don't care if I never wake up again.
