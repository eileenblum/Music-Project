[Demo Version Bonus Track]

A Lie will always defeat the truth.
Weight leaves in anger from my shoulders.
Words of wisdom crush hope.
What is real?
I thought I knew.
How could I lie to someone, I cared for?
How could you lie to me, your words pierced me.
The tremble of your soul injects fear into my heart.
I will stand alone.
This gentle mind, the one inside me will never hurt you.
Actions speak louder than words will ever.
So I will show you my sincerity in the shape of my still beating heart.
