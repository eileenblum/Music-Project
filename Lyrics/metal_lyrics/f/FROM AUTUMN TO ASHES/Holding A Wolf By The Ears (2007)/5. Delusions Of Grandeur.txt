Pressing on about our business
Comfort is getting too expensive
Hot shots for the pigeons with a death sentence
Your something like a pistol that's been polished bright
But if it never leaves the holster it can never save your life
I need a meaning I can get behind
To be alone is to be alive
A better message to subscribe to
To be alone is to be alive
Set sum I'm an hour older
Mile markers punctuate the shoulder
Harboring delusions of grandeur
Your something like a canvas that's been stretched and primed
You can become something priceless
Or you can be a waste of time
I need a meaning I can get behind
To be alone is to be alive
A better message to subscribe to
To be alone is to be alive
This is the best time to be alive
To be alone is to be alive
Consider where complaining gets you
To be alone is to be alive
Were living much too
Were living much too comfortably for me
Keep drifting
Keep drifting aimlessly
Stay with me
Stay with me
We'll stay busy
Stay busy
On endless trips to anywhere
To end up where we'll be
I need a meaning I can get behind
To be alone is to be alive
A better message to subscribe too
To be alone is to be alive
This is the best time to be alive
To be alone is to be alive
Consider where complaining gets you
To be alone is to be alive
