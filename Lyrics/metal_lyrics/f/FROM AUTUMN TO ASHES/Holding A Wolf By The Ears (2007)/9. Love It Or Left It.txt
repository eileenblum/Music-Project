These are the keys
These are the keys
To a pulse that Ive been monitoring
She loves to dream
She loves to dream
But dreamers chase and never obtain
A victory
A victory
A vicious hand on a violent streak
Learn to run
Learn to run
I'll never be right for anyone
The more it gets suggested
The more I'm uninterested
Strength for now
Nothing later
Love it or leave it ya
Hated and left it
Trying to outgrow that phase
I'm drifting further away from
My element
My element
My element
These are the keys
These are the keys
To open minds and to empathy
She loves to dream
She loves to dream
Its better then her reality
A victory
A victory
I'm not as old as I used to be
I will not run
Today's the day
The wheels are back on the motor arcade
The more it gets suggested
The more I'm uninterested
Strength for now
Nothing later
Love it or leave it
Hated and left it
Trying to outgrow that phase
All of my ammunition
Is for the wrong weapon
Ive got the worst intention
And question no question
To keep it on offensive
General admission
For when you feel protected
I'll make you regret it
Love it or leave it
Hated and left it
Trying to outgrow that phase
Love it or leave it
Hated and left it
Trying to outgrow that phase
Just let me
Just let me
Just let out of this
