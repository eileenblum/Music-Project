This is a progression
And you would prefer
The obsolete so leave
Expired
Make room for shorter teeth
You caught me
Sulking and feeling sorry
But this boy
This boy has everything
This boy
This boy has everything he needs
Give yourself over to time and decay
Caged by the freeway
This a progression
You would prefer
The obsolete so leave
Give your self over to time
And decay
And decay
Give yourself over to time
A worse negation of life then death
Is that you'll never want what you get
But failing is just as sweet as success
I've tried them both
And have no preference
So open your eyes and scan the horizon
Pick a direction and don't stop driving
Recounts and recollections
Arguments and objections
Make a connection
Open your eye lid
Scan the horizon
Waking to dream with the brave and defiant
Give yourself over to time and decay
Caged by the freeway
This is a progression
You would prefer
The obsolete
So leave
Give yourself over to time
And decay
And decay
Give yourself over
My self motivation
This scar this badge of honor
My self motivation
This scar this badge of honor
My self motivation
This scar this badge of honor
My self motivation
Is here
