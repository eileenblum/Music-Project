I have everything I need
Innocent victims they don't exist
Who told you this
Outfit the nation with a blindfold and a crucifix
Infinite wisdom
A bullet for the pacifist
Improving methods to cripple the populace
In keeping up with the font stampede
I have a choice
I could keep retreating
But I let it run me run me right into the ground
In keeping up with the font stampede
I have a choice
I could keep retreating
But I let it run me run me right into the ground
I have everything I need
We have no knowledge of the cause and cause and effect
Our fathers leaped behind the ugliest
In heritance
Innocent victim
Its every kid who has a wish
Oh god your in for the greatest disappointment
In keeping up with the font stampede
I have a choice
I could keep retreating
But I let it run me run me right into the ground
In keeping up with the font stampede
I have a choice
I could keep retreating
But I let it run me run me right into the ground
The ground
The ground
The ground
Ground
I let it trample me
I let it trample me
I let it trample me
I have everything I need
I have everything I need
I have everything I need
I have everything I need
