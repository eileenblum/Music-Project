On your honor
On your honor
Le me explain my behavior
On your honor
On your honor
I swear I was trying to save her
Who's the liar
Who's the killer
As I was doing a favor
When I fell upon her by way of a merciful murder
With every warning you wonder
Don't have to tell the truth
Just have to keep remaining mute
And I'll still think for my owner
Yes I know what Ive done and what I'm gonna do
Don't have to tell the truth
Just keep reaming mute
Yes I know what I've done and what I'm gonna do
No witness
No weakness
Don't buckle under the pressure
A servant
A self saint
For all those who suffer
Were caught in a current of confusion
But whats  been suggested and whats be proven
With every warning you wonder
Don't have to tell the truth
Just keep remaining mute
And I still think for my owner
Yes I know what I've done and what I'm gonna do
I am only what you made me now
I am a reflection of your wealth
And if you think think you hate me now
You only hate yourself
Every warning you wonder
Don't have to tell the truth
Just have to keep remaining mute
And i still think for my owner
Yes I know what I've done and what I'm gonna do
