I felt you slip away, far away from me, further from me.
You seem to drift.
I caught myself wishing you back.
As I fight to catch you.
Anger, wells inside me.
I see me, frowning in your eyes.
I see, the fear in you, where none should ever be.
I am here for you, as I strive to grab you.
I see my reflection and the pain scripted across my face, set in stone.
Anger, wells inside me.
I see me, frowning in your eyes.
Far away from me, further from me.
You seem to drift (Far away).
I caught myself wishing you back.
As I fight to catch you.
Slap me, punch me, stab me, kick me, burn me, crucify me, kill me.
Fuck you, hate you, love you, hate myself.
You are nothing to me.
I am everything to you.
You are nothing to me.
I put the fear in you where none should ever be.
I am everything to you.
