Weight leaves in anger from my shoulders.
Words of wisdom crush hope.
What is real? I thought I knew.
How could I lie to someone, I cared for?
How could you lie to me, your words, pierced me.
For good, this was done.
In the end the truth will shine.
To instill truth in your heart, I beg and plead for you.
A lie from your lips will make me cry out in pain, as I wish for you to go away.
How could I lie to you? I cared for you.
How could you lie to me? Your words pierced me.
The tremble of your soul injects fear into my heart.
I will stand alone.
The gentle mind, the one inside me will never hurt you.
Actions speak louder than words will ever.
So I will show you my sincerity in the shape of my still beating heart.
