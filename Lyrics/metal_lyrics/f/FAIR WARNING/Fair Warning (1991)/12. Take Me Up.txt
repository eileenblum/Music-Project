So here we are just you and me
Love's refugees again.
Girl, it's been so long
But still you are so close
I guess the way we're feeling,
Still remained the same.

So there they are the memories
Bringing back the dreams we learned to hide.
And as we're looking back
Love is walking by
Leaving just a blossom
For all the tears we cried.
Take me up just for one more time
High above the shadows, of those long, lonely nights
Hold me tight, just for one more time
'Till the new morning's breaking.

Two burning hearts that's all we are
Turning back the time for just one night.
But as we're moving on
All our dreams remain
Like a secret promise
Before we said goodbye.

Take me up just for one more time
High above the shadows, of those long, lonely nights
Hold me tight, just for one more time
'Till the new morning's breaking.

'Till the new morning's breaking
'Till the new morning light ...
