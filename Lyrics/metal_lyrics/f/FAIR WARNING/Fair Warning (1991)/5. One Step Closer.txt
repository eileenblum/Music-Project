There's a voice in my head
And everywhere I go
It is telling me to come home.
And I know what it means
I'm a million miles away
From the smile that makes me live again.

There's a ringing in my ear
And it's telling me to listen
To the words my heart will always say.
I can fell all the pain
You are going through since I've been away.

It's the call of your heart I feel
It's the call of our love taking me night by night.

One step closer to you every beat of my heart
Every move that I make brings me
One step closer back home- 'cos I know you'll be there
Still waiting for me, waiting for me.

I've been out on the road
Every day and every night
Just to hold you in my arms again.
I've been loosing my mind
Every lonely night grows colder
When the light of your love's far away.

It's the call of your heart I feel
It's the call of your love taking me night by night.

One step closer to you every beat of my heart
Every move that I make brings me
One step closer back home- 'cos I know you'll be there
Still waiting for me.

[Solo]

One step closer step by step
One step closer to you

One step closer to you every beat of my heart
Every move that I make brings me
One step closer back home- 'cos I know you'll be there
Still waiting for me, waiting for me.

It's the call of your heart I feel
It's the call of your love taking me night by night.
It's the call of your heart
The call of your heart I feel.
