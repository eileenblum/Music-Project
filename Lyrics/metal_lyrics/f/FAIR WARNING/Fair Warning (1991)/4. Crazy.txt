She's ain't shy I'm in love
Going crazy
'Cos she's everbody's darling
It's partytime, as soon she's around.

Rings me up late at night
Never lazy
Now I'm acting like a perfect fool But still I can't turn her down.

My temperature is rising,
Each time she is in sight
I know I'm cracking up
One night.

She's driving me crazy way beyond belief
She's the kind of love, that tastes so bittersweet
- No matter what I'm trying
She gets me on the run.
Grabs me in the evening
Rocks me 'till the dawn.

There's a look in her eyes
Spells like trouble
But I know she's got a magic touch
That feels like heaven on earth.

I don't know, where she'll take me
I don't know where I've been
The only thing I know's
She wins.

She's driving me crazy way beyond belief
She's the kind of love, that tastes so bittersweet
- No matter what I'm trying
She gets me on the run.
Grabs me in the evening
Rocks me 'till the dawn.

[Solo]

She's got the magic touch that's what I need

She's driving me crazy way beyond belief
She's the kind of love, that tastes so bittersweet
She's driving me crazy night by night
I guess I got to quit her, to make it out alive

Crazy I guess I'm going crazy ...
