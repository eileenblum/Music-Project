There's a girl down the street
Works at the Five-and-a-dime.
Just lives her life ain't sugarsweet
But she is doing allright.

Friday night she goes out
Just for dancing the night away.
When she moves with the crowd
Makes her heart beat, and that's okay.

But deep down inside those eyes
A fire is aching each night
She's dreaming the dream of breaking free
Can't get enough
She's longing for love

Out on the street no one can see
What she's been hiding so long.
Ain't giving up she's hanging in
One day she'll coming on strong.

Friday night she goes out
Just for dancing the night away.
Just to move with the groove
Makes her heart beat, and that's okay.

'Cos way deep inside those eyes
A fire is aching each night
She's dreaming the dream of breaking free
Can't get enough
She's rising up high, so high
It's bound to come true, one night
Just look in her eyes
She's longing for love

She's longing for love love

[Solo]

'Cos deep down inside those eyes
A fire is aching each night
She's dreaming the dream of breaking free
Can't get enough &lt;
She's rising up high, so high
It's bound to come true, one night
Just look in her eyes
She's longing for love
She's longing for love

She's longing for love downtown girl
Love downtown girl
She's longing for love downtown girl
Love downtown girl
She's longing for love downtown girl
Oh love downtown girl
