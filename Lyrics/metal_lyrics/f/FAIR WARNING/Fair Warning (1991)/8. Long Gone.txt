The rain melting the city lights
Is bringing back your face sometimes
Memories of a thousand nights long gone.

And as I feel the night go by
I still can see your shining eyes
I can feel my heart still holding on.
We didn't even want it
When we found that love was gone.
We never found the reason
But our time went by, and time's never wrong.

Wherever we go, whatever we find
We never made it to the morning
Whatever we do, we cannot deny
Believing in love we felt too strong long gone.

The waters of the turning tide
Come rising with the morning light
To wash away those footsteps in the sand.

And as I see them rising high
I turn away to close my eyes
I guess one day my heart will understand.

We didn't even want it
When we found that love was gone.
We never found the reason
But our time went by, and time's never wrong.

Wherever we go, whatever we find
We never made it to the morning
Whatever we do, we cannot deny
Believing in love we felt too strong
Now it's gone and we find ourselves
We walk the road alone
As we're wishing back a time long gone.

[Solo]

Wherever we go, whatever we find
We never made it to the morning
Whatever we do, we cannot deny
Believing in love we felt too strong
Now it's gone and we find ourselves
We walk the road alone
As we're wishing back the time we knew long gone.
