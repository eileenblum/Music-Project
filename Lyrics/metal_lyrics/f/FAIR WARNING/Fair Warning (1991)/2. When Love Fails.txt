It's too late to turn back
And you say that there is no other way.
But what I see makes me sad
And my heart gets colder day after day.

Now you can't tell me,
What's wrong or right
You don't know what it means,
To start the fight.

When love fails it's too late to stop
When love fails words won't be enough
Now that the last hope is dying in hot desert sand
Can we stop, will it come to an end
When love fails.

It's no game and I hear
Old men telling the same lethal lies,
And who cares for all the tears
It's tonight another lonely one cries.

Now you can't tell me,
What's wrong or right
You don't know what it means,
To start the fight.

When love fails it's too late to stop
When love fails words won't be enough
Now that the last hope is dying in hot desert sand
Can we stop, will it come to an end
When love fails.

[Solo]

Now you can't tell me,
What's wrong or right
You don't know what it means,
To start the fight.

When love fails ooh when love fails
When love fails

When love fails it's too late to stop
When love fails words won't be enough
Now that the last hope is dying in the hot desert sand
Can we stop, will it come to an end
When love fails ...
