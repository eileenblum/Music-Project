Midnight all around
Clouds of smog creeping through.

Acid rain pouring down
It's a nightmare come true.
Faces pass dreaming blind
Drives me mad blows my mind.

Take a look at the future the time is running
Take a look at yourself
Watching the world going down
Take a look at the future our time is coming
Can we hold the wheel of time, can we turn it round.

Down south scenes of war
People starve, people die.

Got no chance got no rights
Just the will to survive.

Wasted lives wasted land
Don't you see, where it ends.

Take a look at the future the time is running
Take a look at yourself
Watching the world going down
Take a look at the future our time is coming
Can we hold the wheel of time, can we turn it round.

[Solo]

There's a place out in space
Used to be paradise
Now the time's running out
Just to keep it alive.

Take a look at the future ...

A spell lies hard on this world
We got to break it
If we start changing ourselves
We're bound to make it.

[Repeat]
