Walking cold and lonely
Through the streets at night
Fears and worries going through my mind.

Though I feel you're with me
It's an endless fight
Keeping up the promise, that I made
This time

Can you hear the call of my heart
Can you hear it screaming your name
Can you hear the call of my heart
Don't let it be in vain.

There's a world about us
Fighting to survive
It's a task our hearts just can't deny.

Through these times of changes
We're bound to fight
Taking up the challenge, that we face
This time

Can you hear the call of my heart
Can you hear it screaming your name
Can you hear the call of my heart
Can you hear it

[Solo]

Can you hear the call of my heart
Can you hear it screaming your name
Can you hear the call of my heart
Like a voice you can't deny
And it's rising up like a flame

Can you hear it yeah, yeah, yeah
Can you hear it, can you hear it.

The call of the heart don't let it be in vain
The call of the heart.
The call of the heart don't let it be in vain
The call of the heart ...
