Walking on the streets
Restless in the heat
Looking for a way to go.
And the night is coming slowly
Bringing the emotion.

Coming to a fight
On the other side running for a mile or two.
Still I'm running onto nowhere
Captured by emotion.

A fire burns me up in the night
The heat of emotion
Only your love can make me survive
The heat of emotion.

And you got me by the neck
And took my breath away
Then you told me  cool it down .
'Cos if love is going nowhere
You're a victim of emotion.

A fire burns me up in the night
The heat of emotion
Only your love can make me survive
The heat of emotion.

The heat of emotion ...

[Solo]

'Cos if love is going nowhere
You're a victim of emotion.

A fire burns me up in the night The heat of emotion
Only your love can make me survive
The heat of emotion.

Heat of emotion
Heat of emotion
