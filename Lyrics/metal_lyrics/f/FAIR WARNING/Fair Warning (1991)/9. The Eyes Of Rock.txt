Moving out through the Co-Co night
Coming down for the show
Waiting for the news, that's nothing new.
On the leave when you caught my eye
Are you ready to go
I can feel the power coming through.

No one can tell, what we will find
Who's to deny, my friend, we're far too young to die.

Are you ready for the freeway
For the cold wind of the night-
Can you move it, to the heartbeat of your soul.
Are you ready for the good time,
Can you stand out to the eyes of Rock'n Roll 0

The eyes of Rock, the eyes of Rock
The eyes of Rock'n Roll
The eyes of Rock, the eyes of Rock

Empty faces and sleepy eyes
They can't stand in our way
Got no time, we've heard it all before.
No one knows, how to live ours lives
We demand our say
We don't make no compromise no more.

No one can tell, what we find
Who's to deny, my friend, we're far too young to die.

Are you ready for the freeway
For the cold wind of the night-
Can you move it, to the heartbeat of your soul.
Are you ready for the good time,
Can you stand out to the eyes of Rock'n Roll

The eyes of Rock, the eyes of Rock
The eyes of Rock'n Roll
The eyes of Rock, the eyes of Rock

[Solo]

No one can tell, what we find
Who's to deny, my friend.
We're far too young for giving up tonight.

Are you ready are you ready
Are you ready the eyes of Rock, the eyes of Rock
Are you ready the eyes of Rock'n Roll
Are you ready the eyes of Rock, the eyes of Rock
Are you ready the eyes of Rock'n Roll
