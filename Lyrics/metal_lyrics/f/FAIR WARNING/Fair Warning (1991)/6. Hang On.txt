It's a lazy lie, that you're telling me
But girl, I can read in your eyes.
You've changed your ways, ain't hard to see
And your eyes offer no compromise.

When the night falls,
And you're all on your own
Can you keep up your dreams and illusions
Will your heart call
For the morning to come
When all that you find, is a lie.

Why don't you hang on hang on a minute
Why don't you hang on,
Because you're breaking my heart.
Hang on hang on a moment
Before the dawn tears a curtain apart.

There's an evil wind, in the streets out there
And like poison it crawls through your mind.
Put's you fast asleep, and you just don't care
As you're wasting the chance of your life.

It's so long gone,
We trusted in love
Can we find our way back to the daylight
Can we hold on
To the call of our hearts,
Facing the eyes of the night.

Why don't you hang on hang on a minute
Why don't you hang on,
'Cos you're breaking my heart.
Hang on Hang on a moment
Before the dawn tears a curtain apart.

[Solo]

Why don't you hang on hang on a minute
Why don't you hang on,
'Cos you're breaking my heart.
Hang on Hang on a moment
Before the dawn tears a curtain apart.

So don't break my heart.
