Shall you be the one
The one whoÂ´s always strong
Aimed for perfection so truely
Beware of the best
For the best of us have failed the test
And trade compassion for victory
Come all you prophets
So sure to succeed
Blind to the world
Your victims will bleed
When weÂ´re sailing home
The truth will be shown
The promise we made
Puts us to the final test
When weÂ´ve sealed our fate
Will glory await
The homecoming brave
Will eyes turn away in shame
You rise from the east
YouÂ´re the angel or the beast
Seeker for wisdom or glory
Set out for the west
Spread the holy word to make it last
You last your vision in fury
Come all you prophets
So sure to succeed
Blind to the world
Your victims will bleed
When weÂ´re sailing home
The truth will be shown
The promise we made
Puts us to the final test
When weÂ´ve sealed our fate
Will glory await
The homecoming brave
Will eyes turn away in shame
Come all you prophets
So sure to succeed
Blind to the world
Your victims will bleed
When weÂ´re sailing home
The truth will be shown
The promise we made
Puts us to the final test
When weÂ´ve sealed our fate
Will glory await
The homecoming brave
Will eyes turn away in shame
Sailing home
The truth will be shown
The promise we made
Puts us to the final test
When weÂ´ve sealed our fate
Will glory await
The homecoming brave
Will eyes turn away in shame
Sailing Home
Make your choice itÂ´s up to you
Sailing Home...
