Morning light is breaking
Distant sky's alight
Melting down the shadows of the night
I find myself still dreaming -
As I open up my eyes
To the beauty of new day come alive
For the times they are a-changing -
I can feel in the air
And wherever they will drive me -
I don't care -

I follow my heart -
Down the road I'm riding
Led on by the sun to a new days shine -
So don't call me back -
To those lost horizons
I follow my heart -
I follow my heart this time

I'm singing to the sunshine -
Laughing at the rain
Guided by the whisper of the wind
And down the road of night-time -
When evening's come again
I'll be waiting for a new day to begin

And the worries 'bout the future -
They are fading in the past
For the love that I am feeling -
It will last -

I follow my heart -
Down the road I'm riding
Led on by the sun and the fire inside
So don't call me back -
To those lost horizons
I follow my heart -
I follow my heart tonight yeah, come on...

I follow my heart -
Down the road I'm riding
Whatever may come or be - shall be
So don't call me back -
To those lost horizons
I follow my heart -
And one day I'm breaking free...
