Cold as steel - darkness calls
Forborn is your heart
The way you feel - wasted love
Just tears you apart

Bridges are burned - lost is your home
The tides they have turned
A soul all alone - alone

Remember the dreams that you had
When life was still kind
Now see and do never look back
And love you will find

Come dance with the angels of heaven
Just reach out your hand
There's a new promised land
May forgiveness be strong

Come dance with the angels of heaven
Forget all the past
You can make love last
Ooh you can't go wrong

Hope is gone and you believe
That you can't go on
Be good to yourself
This fight can be won - be won

Remember the dreams that you had
Before life got rough
Now see and do never look back
There's more than enough

Come dance with the angels of heaven
Just reach out your hand
There's a new promised land
May forgiveness be strong

Come dance with the angels of heaven
Forget all the past
You can make love last
Ooh you can't go wrong

Come dance with the angels of heaven
Just reach out your hand
Together we'll stand
Ooh you can't go wrong

Come dance with the angels of heaven
Forget all the past
You can make love last
May forgiveness be strong

Come dance ooh yeah
Look out - come and dance
Come and dance - look out
For the angels of heaven....
