Give me a moment
I know youÂ´re feeling down tonight
And the visions of your dreams
They are fading with the wind
I know it ainÂ´t easy
When your heartÂ´s still tied
To the memories of the past
Deep within
DonÂ´t keep me waiting for too long
DonÂ´t let me stand here
Â´Til the dawn is coming on
All on your own - in this night
Tell me what you wanna prove
Chasing shadows on your own
All on your own - you can fight
But the meaning of it all
You wonÂ´t find - all alone
The moon of the night-time
ItÂ´s rising with a golden wing
Turns the secrets of our hearts
Into tales from yesterday
Hey, look at yourself, girl
ThereÂ´s a new begin
Just as long as you let love
Find a way
DonÂ´t let them tell you that itÂ´s wrong
DonÂ´t push it back now
Â´Til your heart has turned to stone
All on your own - in this night
Tell me what you wanna prove
Chasing shadows on your own
All on your own - you can fight
But the meaning of it all
You wonÂ´t find - all alone
All on your own - in this night
Tell me what you wanna prove
Chasing shadows on your own
All on your own - you can fight
But the meaning of it all
You wonÂ´t find - all alone
All alone
You wonÂ´t find it, girl
All alone - no, no - you wonÂ´t find it, girl
