The dream of love - it fades away
And now i greet the silence as a friend -
Too many words - and all they say
WeÂ´re standing at the crossroads where it ends -
But still i feel the fire - that burns my soul
I guess itÂ´s just a feeling - i canÂ´t control
If this is love - the way you want it
Take it all, make it live and let it shine -
If these are dreams - the way you need them
Find a better love for all the tears you cry
The leaves of fall - theyÂ´re dry and worn
And now we see them
Drifting with the wind -
No looking back - weÂ´re moving on
And soon we wonÂ´t remember where
WeÂ´ve been
But still i feel the fire - that burns inside
I guess itÂ´s just rejection - to live a lie
If this is love - the way you want it
Take it all, make it live and let it shine -
If these are dreams - the way you need them
Find a better love for all the tears you cry
Ooh, no find your love
If this is love - the way you want it
Take it all, make it live and let it shine -
If these are dreams - the way you need them
Find a better love for all the tears you cry
That you cry -
That you cry, babe
