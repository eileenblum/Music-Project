Man, it's been a long time
Since you walked into this night - never easy
Straying down a thin line
Relying on your eyes - never wrong

You have chained yourself -
To the game of fame
But you never were true
You have given up - in the name of love
But it never was you

Man on the moon - trust in yourself -
Wait 'til the night goes by
It will never be easy - but time moves on
And love survives

The torch you kept like nothing
It's coming down burning low -
As you're drifting
Come on and let it shine now
There's just one way to go - for your kind
You've known it all the time

Man on the moon - trust in yourself
Wait 'til the night goes by
It will never be easy - but time moves on
And love survives
Love will survive

Man on the moon - trust in yourself
Wait 'til the night goes by
It will always be different -
And love survives

Love survives

Break through teh circles of time
Rise on and light up the skies
Fly - shine on your light
