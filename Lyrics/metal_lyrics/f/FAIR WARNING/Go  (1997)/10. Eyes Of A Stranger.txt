Tears running down
From the face of the silence
Into the dreams of my night
Open my eyes
Â´Til the wake of the grey morning light
See how we walk down
The roads of illusion
Cautiously pacing in line -
Soldiers of fate
On our way through the deserts of time

Seeing myself with the eyes of a stranger
Making my way through this land
Watching me rise from the past to the future
Laying my soul in your hand -
In your hand

Travellers appear
From the coastlines of nowhere
Crossing the rainbows of light
Guiding our way
On this lonely crusade through the night

Seeing ourselves with the eyes of a stranger
Making our way through this land
Watching us rise from the past to the future
Laying our souls - laying our souls -
In your hand

IÂ´ve seen myself stumble and fall
Into this life
Finding no place where i belong
You picked me up - eased up my mind
I will be there
When time has come

Seeing myself with the eyes of a stranger
Out on the fields of this land
Watching me rise from the past to the future
Laying my soul - laying my soul
In your hand -
In your hand
