Time is running out, man -
Slipping through your hands
Anger and confusion in your eyes
Your ticket for the big time -
Down the drain it went
And now you find it hard to compromise
Your vision, it pushes you on -
You just canÂ´t let go
But now that it all seems gone wrong -
ItÂ´s this you should know

Wherever you are - whatever you do
When lifeÂ´s got you down -
And dreams donÂ´t come true
DonÂ´t give it up - trust in your heart
When nobody else will care -
I will be there

Shiny wheels of fortune - never standing still
Turning on the wise man and the fool
But when youÂ´re left with nothing -
You can see whatÂ´s real
And all you got to doÂ´s keep your cool
The clockwork keeps pushinÂ´ you on -
ItÂ´s driving you mad
You find yourself all on your own -
But donÂ´t you forget

Wherever you are - whatever you do
When lifeÂ´s got you down -
And dreams donÂ´t come true
DonÂ´t give it up - trust in your heart
When nobody else will care -
I will be there

Wherever you are - whatever you do
When lifeÂ´s got you down -
And dreams donÂ´t come true
DonÂ´t give it up - trust in your heart
When nobody else will care
Whatever may come - iÂ´ll be by your side
Way out in the storm -
Deep down in the night
Guarding your heart, guiding your way
I will be there - i will be there...
