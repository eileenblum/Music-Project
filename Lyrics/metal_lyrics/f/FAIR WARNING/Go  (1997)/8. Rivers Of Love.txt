There she stands in the rain -
In the neon light
Cast away on the oceans -
Of the night
Left out in the cold
Of the grey morning light
Another day of heartache
Right before her eyes
And she cries

Soaked up by the crowd -
Just a face in time
IÂ´m turning back like a stranger -
To this life of mine
But still her eyes -
They are haunting my mind
Is this the life i wanted -
A donÂ´t care paradise

And the rivers of love - so close
Such a little step away -
Are we really just too blind to see
Do we run through this life - blindfold
Turning circles in the dark - never free -
Free

Just a face in the crowd -
That youÂ´ve seen before
Reaching out through the darkness -
We donÂ´t see no more
But the loneliness around us -
That weÂ´ve learned to ignore
ItÂ´s waiting in the backyard -
Knocking at our door

And the rivers of love - so close
Such a little step away -
Are we really just too blind to see
Do we run through this life - blindfold
As weÂ´re searching for the light -
To be free

And the rivers of love - so close
Such a little step away -
Are we really just too blind to see
Do we run through this life - blindfold
As weÂ´re searching for the light -
To be free

Rivers of love - flow through my heart
Open up these eyes -
Show me how weÂ´re meant to be
Rivers of love - tear these chains apart
Set my soul on fire - set me free
