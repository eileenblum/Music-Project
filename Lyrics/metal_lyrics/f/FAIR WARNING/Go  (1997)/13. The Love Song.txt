Stars floating by in the distance -
Cooling the pain in my eyes
IÂ´ve seen them rising a thousand times
Down in this heart of the night -
In this night
WeÂ´re roaming the oceans of sorrow -
And whisper our dreams to the wind
But down in our hearts
ThereÂ´s a cry for truth -
Waiting for life to begin
But what shall we do - without love
Where will we go - without love
ThereÂ´s no way at all - without love -
This time
The prophets of hate
In the twilight -
Still ruling this planet of blue
But deep in our hearts
ThereÂ´s a light of hope -
Calling the truth to come true
For what shall we do - without love
Where will we go - without love
ThereÂ´s no way at all - without love -
This time
Our heads theyÂ´re working overtime
Just amking up what we canÂ´t find
But lonely we wonÂ´t make the day -
Together we will -
Together weÂ´re finding a way -
But what shall we do - without love
Where will we go - without love
ThereÂ´s no way at all - without love -
In time, this time
Where will we run - without love
Just as we fail - without love
ThereÂ´s nothing to find - without love -
In time, this time
Without love...
