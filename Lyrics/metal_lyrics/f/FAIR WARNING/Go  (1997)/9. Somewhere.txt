Once upon a time, girl
I was drifting with the wind
I chased my own reflections
Through the whirl that i was in
I turned around now
I made up my mind

The hunger for the freeway
It is burninÂ´ in my blood
It pushes me to the limit
I can never get enough- love

The way i feel - it blows my mind
And i can feel the turn of time
Somewhere out there - i see it shine
Just like a rainbow
Somewhere out there - cast in the sky
Just like a sign
Somewhere out there - thereÂ´ll be a time
When weÂ´re together
Somewhere down the line

The open road before me
Like a neverending stream
It takes a new direction
To a world iÂ´ve never seen
The nights of sorrow
They fade away
And i can feel the break of day

Somewhere out there - i see it shine
Just like a rainbow
Somewhere out there - cast in the sky
Just like a sign
Somewhere out there - thereÂ´ll be a time
When weÂ´re together
Somewhere down the line
Somewhere down the line

And if my heart goes down in circles
One more time
I know the answer in my mind

Somewhere out there - i see it shine
Just like a rainbow
Somewhere out there - cast in the sky
Just like a sign
Somewhere out there - thereÂ´ll be a time
When weÂ´re together
Somewhere down the line
Somewhere down the line
