The wind blows cold through the heart of the silence
I dream of you - youÂ´re still on my mind
Â´Cause since youÂ´re gone
IÂ´m lost in the darkness
Roaming the circles of time
Here i am -
On the way to the truth of my heart
Just a man -
Holding on to a dream torn apart
Way down in this heart
I lost my head in the heat of the moment
Caught in a rage - denying the truth
I lost my head -
Now iÂ´m learning the hard way
I just canÂ´t move on - without you
Carved in my heart -
The days of the summer
Your shining eyes - the wind in your hair
But now the rain is blinding my window
ItÂ´s just a fate i canÂ´t bear
Here i am -
On the way to the truth of my heart
Just a man -
Holding on to a dream torn apart
Deep down in this heart
I lost my head in the heat of the moment
Caught in a rage - denying the truth
I lost my head -
Now iÂ´m learning the hard way
I just canÂ´t move on - without you
I lost my head in the heat of the moment
Caught in a rage - denying the truth
I lost my head - now iÂ´m longing for shelter
And nothing to save me - making it through
Without you - without you - without you
ThereÂ´s nothing to save me -
Making it through
Without you
